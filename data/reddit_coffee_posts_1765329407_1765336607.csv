1pirnlq,https://www.reddit.com/r/coparenting/comments/1pirnlq/there_are_no_words/,There are no words,"I never thought I’d be in this situation.  So 4 months ago, I caught my ex cheating we have a 2 year old together. 

He got into a relationship with someone almost immediately. Introduced our daughter to her after a month. Moved in with her. Made my daughter a room at her house 2 months in and I’m just trying to manage my own grief as a stay at home mom suddenly turned into a single mom. But also learning how to co parent fairly with a person whom I was building a family with and betrayed me.

Well the new girlfriend is desperately trying her hardest to be my friend, I’ve tried telling my ex to keep things about my daughter but they have offered to co sign on a place for me, sending me housing links, offering to send me extra money, offering to help me find work.

And her, she has offered to “kidnap me” to take me for a road trip, offered to have dinner with me, keeps offering support emotionally. I offered to sit down and have coffee after I refused the dinner because it felt like too much at the time, but she kept saying “I know this awkward I know this is hard” and I was like screw it let’s have coffee and try to smooth over some things and she bailed.. 

All the while I’m just sitting here trying to manage this new life, and just thinking what the heck is this. 

I don’t know what I’m asking or needing but I’ve never been so exhausted by something and yes, I understand the importance of being civil to the new partner since my child is with her and trust me I am but holy fudge. This feels unorthodox. ",1,1765335891.0,coparenting,2,1.0,False

The boots that thunder in belong to Casey—tall, calm, paramedic badge flashing—and the second his blue eyes land on my crotch-snaps and pacifier clip, something shifts: professional concern melts into a quiet, possessive warmth I’ve never felt from a man before.



He kneels, murmurs, “I’ve got you, babygirl,” voice pitched low, and I swear the pain dims like morphine already dripped straight into my heart.



On the ride to Memorial he tucks my stuffed cat under the blanket, shields my onesie from gawking neighbors, texts later: You’re not broken—this Little thing is brave.



I text back trembling emojis; he answers with groceries, shower chair, Thai take-out, patience wrapped in Daddy energy.



Wound checks turn into couch cuddles, cartoon marathons, his hand covering mine on the satin edge of my pink blankie while he calls me good girl.



Under Mr. Whiskers watching from the headboard, I taste apple juice on his tongue.



God, I actually get a Daddy in every cloud has a silver lining.



————————



Abigail



The opening theme of Bluey plays for the third time tonight and I'm exactly where I need to be.



My apartment is dim except for the glow of the television. I'm curled up on my oversized bean bag with Mr. Whiskers tucked under one arm and my favorite pink blanket draped over my legs. The pacifier between my lips bobs gently as I watch Bluey and Bingo play their game, and something tight in my chest finally starts to unwind.



This is my space. My safe space. The place where Abigail Goodwin, CPA, doesn't have to exist for a few precious hours.



I shift and the bulk of my diaper crinkles softly beneath my onesie. It's pale purple with little stars on it, worn soft from washing, and the snaps at the crotch press gently against my skin through the padding. The sensation is grounding. Comforting. A physical reminder that right now, in this moment, I don't have to be the competent professional who spent fourteen hours today reconciling a corporate client's absolute disaster of a tax situation.



My phone sits face-down on the coffee table. Fourteen missed calls from work. Twenty-three emails that came in after I left the office. All of them can wait until tomorrow because it's nine at night in mid-April and I have officially clocked out.



Well. I've clocked out in the adult sense. Right now I'm clocked firmly into being small, and my biggest concern is whether I want apple juice or chocolate milk before bed.



On screen, Bandit is being a good daddy, playing along with his daughters' imagination game even though he's clearly exhausted. I watch with something like longing curling in my stomach. Not for a father, I had one of those and he was wonderful before the accident took him and Mom when I was nineteen. No, the longing is for something else entirely. Someone who'd understand this. Who'd see me like this and not run screaming.



I've tried dating. Regular dating. The kind where you put on real clothes and makeup and pretend you're a functional adult who has her together. It always ends the same way. Three dates, maybe four, and then I start feeling the walls close in because I can't be myself. Can't explain that sometimes I need to come home and color in a coloring book for two hours while drinking from a sippy cup. Can't admit that my bedroom has stuffies lining the shelves and a whole drawer full of onesies and pull-ups.



So I stopped trying. It's been two years since my last relationship, and honestly? This is better. Easier. No one to disappoint when they realize I'm fundamentally broken in a way that makes normal relationships impossible.



I let the pacifier fall from my mouth, letting it dangle from the clip attached to my onesie, and reach for my sippy cup. The apple juice is cold and sweet and perfect. I take three long gulps before setting it back on the coffee table, already thinking about what snack I want.



My stomach growls. Goldfish crackers, maybe. Or the fruit snacks shaped like cartoon characters that I definitely did not buy in the kids' section of the grocery store while avoiding eye contact with everyone.



The fruit snacks are on top of my refrigerator. I put them up there this morning in a fit of organization, thinking I'd grab them later when I wanted them.



I unfold myself from the bean bag, my legs a little stiff from being curled up so long. The carpet is soft under my bare feet as I pad into my small kitchen. The light above the stove casts everything in a warm glow, and I can see my reflection in the microwave. Messy bun on top of my head, pacifier dangling against my chest, onesie stretched across my hips.



I look ridiculous. I look perfect. I look like me.



The fruit snacks are just out of reach, even when I stretch on my tiptoes. Of course they are. Because I'm five-foot-three on a good day and apparently past-Abigail thought she was a giant this morning.



My desk chair is right there, the one with wheels that I usually push under my desk in the corner of the living room where I sometimes work from home. I drag it over to the fridge, not thinking much about it beyond getting my snacks and going back to my show.



The chair rolls easily across the laminate floor. Too easily, maybe, but I'm already climbing onto it, one knee on the seat, then the other foot finding purchase. I rise up, steadying myself with one hand on top of the fridge, reaching with the other.



My fingers brush the box of fruit snacks.



The chair moves.



It happens so fast. One second I'm reaching, the next the chair is rolling out from under me and I'm falling. My hip clips the counter on the way down and then there's the coffee table, the corner of it, and my leg is bending in a way that legs should not bend and then there's a sound.



A crack. Sharp and horrible and wet.



I hit the floor and the pain is immediate and blinding and wrong. So completely and utterly wrong that for a moment I can't even process what's happened. My brain is just screaming wrong wrong wrong while my body tries to curl in on itself.



I can't curl. Something is wrong with my leg. Very wrong.



I make a sound. It's high and thin and animal, nothing like my regular voice, and it echoes in my small apartment. My vision swims and I think I might throw up. I force myself to breathe through my nose, in and out, trying to get control while my nervous system does its best to make me pass out.



Don't look. Don't look at your leg. Just breathe.



I look.



My left leg is wrong. The shin is wrong. There's a bump that shouldn't be there and oh god, oh god, there's something white poking through my skin and that's bone. That's my bone. I can see my bone.



The scream that comes out of me is raw and terrified and makes my throat hurt. My hands are shaking. My whole body is shaking. The pain is like nothing I've ever felt before, radiating up from my leg in hot waves that make my teeth chatter.



I need help. I need help right now.



My phone. Where's my phone? Coffee table. I'm on the floor next to the coffee table. I twist, gasping when the movement sends fresh agony through my leg, and grab blindly until my fingers close around my phone.



Nine-one-one. I need to call nine-one-one.



But I'm wearing a onesie. I'm wearing a diaper. There's a pacifier clipped to my chest and Mr. Whiskers is three feet away, staring at me with his button eyes. My living room is full of evidence. The coloring books on the coffee table. The sippy cup. The episode of Bluey still playing on the television, Bandit's voice a cheerful backdrop to my nightmare.



I can't. I can't have strangers come here and see all of this.



Another wave of pain rolls through me and I sob, the sound ugly and desperate. My leg is broken. Badly broken. Compound fracture, some distant part of my brain supplies helpfully, the part that took anatomy in college. The bone is through the skin. This isn't something I can just walk off or wrap in an ace bandage. This is hospital-level bad.



My fingers are slick with sweat as I unlock my phone. The screen is too bright, the numbers swimming in front of my eyes. I tap nine. I tap one. I tap one again.



The ringing seems to last forever.



""Nine-one-one, what's your emergency?""



""I fell."" My voice comes out thin and shaky, small in a way that has nothing to do with how I was feeling ten minutes ago. ""My leg. I think it's broken. I can see... there's bone. I can see bone.""



""Okay, I need you to stay calm for me. What's your address?""



I rattle it off, the numbers and street name coming automatically even though my brain feels like static. The dispatcher's voice is professional and soothing and I cling to it like a lifeline while she asks me questions. Can I move? No. Am I bleeding? I don't think so. Am I alone? Yes.



Yes, I'm alone. I'm always alone. And now I'm alone and broken on my living room floor wearing a diaper and there's a box of fruit snacks somewhere near my head that I'll never be able to look at again without wanting to die.



""Paramedics are on their way. I need you to stay on the line with me, okay? Don't try to move.""



As if I could. The pain is making me light-headed now, a dizzy rushing feeling that makes the room tilt. I let my cheek rest against the cool floor and try to focus on breathing. In through my nose. Out through my mouth. Don't think about what I'm wearing. Don't think about what they're going to see.



But that's all I can think about.



My little space. My private, safe, sacred space. About to be violated by strangers who will take one look at me and know. They'll know everything. They'll see the onesie and the diaper and the pacifier and they'll know exactly what I am.



Shame burns hot in my chest, competing with the pain for dominance. This is my worst nightmare. This is every anxiety spiral I've ever had made real. I want to crawl out of my own skin. I want to wake up and have this be a terrible dream.



But it's not a dream. It's real. My leg is shattered and help is coming and there's nothing I can do to hide what I am.



""Abigail? Are you still with me?"" The dispatcher's voice cuts through my spiraling thoughts.



""Yeah. I'm here.""



""Good. The paramedics are close. Just a few more minutes. You're doing great.""



I'm not doing great. I'm the opposite of great. I'm broken and exposed and about to be humiliated in front of medical professionals who will probably put it in their group chat later. You'll never guess what we walked into tonight.



I close my eyes and try to pretend I'm somewhere else. Anywhere else. But the pain won't let me drift. It keeps me anchored to this moment, to this reality, to the sound of sirens getting closer.



The television is still going. Bluey's theme song plays again and I almost laugh except it would hurt too much. This episode will be ruined for me forever. This whole night will be ruined forever. This might ruin everything.



The sirens are loud now. Right outside. The dispatcher is saying something about them being here, about how I can hang up now, about how they'll take good care of me.



I end the call and let my phone fall from my hand.



There are voices in the hallway. Heavy footsteps. Professional, efficient sounds of people who do this every day and have seen everything.



They haven't seen this.



I grab the edge of my blanket and try to pull it over myself but it doesn't reach far enough. Doesn't cover the onesie or the obvious bulk of the diaper or any of the dozens of ways this apartment screams what I am.



There's a knock on the door. Firm and authoritative.



""Paramedics!""

I averaged around 5 a day, and now I’m down to just two with hopes to go to 1 or just 0 next week…currently one at noon and one around 4:30. The biggest breakthrough for me was uncoupling it from my morning coffee ritual. Once that link was broken, something shifted. I started to realize I didn’t actually want it anymore; it was just a story my mind had been telling me.

It’s wild how the brain works. For a while, that little voice kept whispering, “just one more,” as if it were doing me a favor. But once you recognize that voice for what it really is…nothing more than a chemical signal your brain is subconsciously firing …you suddenly gain this strange sense of power over it.

It’s almost like meditation: when a thought comes up, you acknowledge it without judgment and let it drift away. I’m learning to treat the craving the same way. Instead of fighting it, I watch it rise and fall like a passing cloud, and not let it alter my overall mood. And the more I do that, the more I realize there’s nothing waiting for me on the other side of that urge…no reward, no peace, just another loop.",1,1765335858.0,QuittingZyn,1,1.0,False

First off a bit of background. I’ve been roleplaying off and on for over 10 years now. I write exclusively in 3rd person, and I tend to write A LOT haha. I also  can reply several times a week. I also enjoy a decent amount of OOC chat and bonding with my writing partner.

Onto my idea! The other day I was at a 7Brew coffee (one of the drive up coffee places), and they always have a chatty college aged gal there that talks with you for a few minutes as they make your coffee. I’m a sucker for roleplay where strangers fall for each other so I wanted to combine these two ideas. Maybe it just so happens that I come the days that you work and we really start to hit it off. We can throw in days where we don’t match up too (I don’t get coffee or you arnt working). Maybe it progresses to getting your number. I just like the idea that the connection forms over a series of these smaller interactions. Maybe the conversations get more personal despite other coworkers and patrons in their car being around. Maybe there’s drama in one of our lives. There are a lot of ways we could play this out but the main elements are strangers to lovers and also focusing on building that connection in those short bursts rather than hours longs talks or dates.

If you are up for it I’d love to talk it out! ",2,1765335639.0,Roleplay,0,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

My and my now ex (both 20) met last year at University and started formarly dating on December 26. Everything went amazing, but on August ive sensed something was off and we went for a coffee and she told me there were certain things about me she didnt like, like I wasn't paying mich attention to her, we werent seeing each other a lot (mind u we saw each other EVERY DAY AT UNI and talked and texted all the time) and i wasn't affectionate enough and that.

  
So the next MONTHS i started to do things. Bought her coffee, we went on dates, birthday parties, even went to the cinema and HAD SEX. So everything was great right?

So a week later she broke up with me because of the same things,  its as iif even thoughI tried she couldn'tsee my effort. She told me she didnt want someone with 'those qualities' in her life, but she told me she loved me and wanted to stay in,touch and with my family and all. This was October 3rd.

  
The next month I was feeling like shit. I texred her crying every 2 days and couldn't even work properly, i was honesteoy bedrotting. Later that month SHE INVITED ME to a coffee and talking and i told her i couldnt be her friend and I wanted to improve and she told me ""me too, i cant see myself not being your partner"". On november SHE INVITED ME to a show she was signing at and i went and later she toldme about how it was best for us to stop talking. I told her I wont see her again until next year and she said ""Well maybe we can see each other before December ends"".

  
I dont understand her.

  
After some pretty rough days of watching her Instagram I decided to block her. That was 2 weeks ago. I texted her telling her that and that I was gonna wait until end of January to see what we would do. She started talking A LOT about how there was nothing to talk about and her mind was made up day 1 (A LIE LOL) and even if I promise her i wont change cuz i was too late to change things. I told her ""Im gonna change for me, goodbye"" and she satarted yapping about ""yeah i know u can"". What a full of shit.

  
In the past weeks i started going to therapy, reading, meditating, adnd honestly I'm still thinking about her a lot. I dont understand cuz she says shes done but then she did all those (and many more) weird things. Some part of me still wants her back, but not as in October, idk its kinda weird now. 

  
What i get really mad about is how she couldn't see all the things i did for her and many more when she told me about them. Its like she is blind for what I did at the begging and everything else, she just cant see it. Im scared she's 100% made up cuz idk I still think we can work it out if she wasn't so closed off. She just doesnt trust me  idk.

Idk some part of me still thinls she will get around, she has to, but ifl anymore. And as I dont have any way of communicating or knowing what shes doing, lately ive been getting to the conclusion that WE ARE DONE SHE HATES ME ILL NEVER GET HER SHE FORGOT ABOUT EVERTRHING WE HAD, and idk its tiring man

so we got coffee and the date lasted around 2 hours. at the end, he asked if I wanted to get coffee again. we got coffee the next day and the date nearly lasted 3+ hours. we both mentioned we had told our friends/families. keep in mind he's paid for everything. in-between the days we were not seeing eachother, we were texting/calling. I had an event I went to, and I sent him some photos of me dressed up in which he called me stunning.

on saturday, we finally went on our date. he came and picked me up at my place. we ended up going to lunch at a really nice place and once again, he paid. we had a good time and he took me back to mine, even helped me grab some stuff for my party later that evening. he gave me a small kiss at the end, and we continued to talk into the evening. on sunday he offered to cook dinner at his, in which I accepted and he said he would come pick me/get an uber.

we got coffee this week on Tuesday and he mentioned a holiday networking event. he asked me to be his 1+ and said we would pregame with his friends beforehand. I accepted the offer.

overall, I really like this guy. I think he is super sweet and defiantly want to know him more. I've had some really bad expiecnes in dating/men, and have never had a boyfriend. just a few questions.

1.) does it seem like he is looking for something casual? because based on the 1+ it does not seem that way.

2.) do you think he is lovebombing me? I personally do not think he is.

3.) is it too early for him to be asking me over? so far, we have gone on atleast 4 dates.

1pirfq6,https://i.redd.it/64ygm7f4ka6g1.jpeg,Asus ROG Swift PG32UCDMR has arrived,"Had an LG 38GL950-B ultrawide for more than 5 years. It is a great monitor with a single flaw that I cannot tolerate, which is the active fans inside it. Over time it had become a high-pitched whine which I am quite certain was giving me headaches, to the point I'd put headphones on my head just to drown out the noise. Couldn't deal with it any more so I had to find a passively cooled monitor. I figured that OLEDs had gotten to a point where they are safer long term investments so it was time to upgrade.

I was hoping for a larger 4K UHD OLED model with a decent bump in refresh rate, but also one with some half decent connectivity as a guy who often works from home. So the combination of 90W PD, a built-in KVM and some nice protection features for the panel itself,as well as DP 2.1, was enough to convince me to go for this model. I got an absolutely crazy good deal from a local computer parts reseller, so I think I got lucky.

Can say I'm very impressed, setup was easy as was the firmware updates. I'm a fan of uniform brightness for doing productivity work during the day and I really like the proximity sensor. Seems to do a good job of figuring out that I'm making a coffee or whatever and turns itself off. 

This felt like a pretty good compromise as far as performance vs. convenience. Even the software you get is pretty good.",3,1765335275.0,OLED_Gaming,3,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1pire3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1pire3j/im_curled_in_my_purple_star_onesie_diaper_snug/,"I’m curled in my purple star onesie, diaper snug, paci bobbing while Bluey sings, when the chair wheels out and I hear the crack—my tibia pops through skin like a horror movie.","I dial 911 through tears, praying the strangers won’t see the sippy cup, the coloring books, the baby me scattered across the living-room nest.



The boots that thunder in belong to Casey—tall, calm, paramedic badge flashing—and the second his blue eyes land on my crotch-snaps and pacifier clip, something shifts: professional concern melts into a quiet, possessive warmth I’ve never felt from a man before.



He kneels, murmurs, “I’ve got you, babygirl,” voice pitched low, and I swear the pain dims like morphine already dripped straight into my heart.



On the ride to Memorial he tucks my stuffed cat under the blanket, shields my onesie from gawking neighbors, texts later: You’re not broken—this Little thing is brave.



I text back trembling emojis; he answers with groceries, shower chair, Thai take-out, patience wrapped in Daddy energy.



Wound checks turn into couch cuddles, cartoon marathons, his hand covering mine on the satin edge of my pink blankie while he calls me good girl.



Under Mr. Whiskers watching from the headboard, I taste apple juice on his tongue.



God, I actually get a Daddy in every cloud has a silver lining.



————————



Abigail



The opening theme of Bluey plays for the third time tonight and I'm exactly where I need to be.



My apartment is dim except for the glow of the television. I'm curled up on my oversized bean bag with Mr. Whiskers tucked under one arm and my favorite pink blanket draped over my legs. The pacifier between my lips bobs gently as I watch Bluey and Bingo play their game, and something tight in my chest finally starts to unwind.



This is my space. My safe space. The place where Abigail Goodwin, CPA, doesn't have to exist for a few precious hours.



I shift and the bulk of my diaper crinkles softly beneath my onesie. It's pale purple with little stars on it, worn soft from washing, and the snaps at the crotch press gently against my skin through the padding. The sensation is grounding. Comforting. A physical reminder that right now, in this moment, I don't have to be the competent professional who spent fourteen hours today reconciling a corporate client's absolute disaster of a tax situation.



My phone sits face-down on the coffee table. Fourteen missed calls from work. Twenty-three emails that came in after I left the office. All of them can wait until tomorrow because it's nine at night in mid-April and I have officially clocked out.



Well. I've clocked out in the adult sense. Right now I'm clocked firmly into being small, and my biggest concern is whether I want apple juice or chocolate milk before bed.



On screen, Bandit is being a good daddy, playing along with his daughters' imagination game even though he's clearly exhausted. I watch with something like longing curling in my stomach. Not for a father, I had one of those and he was wonderful before the accident took him and Mom when I was nineteen. No, the longing is for something else entirely. Someone who'd understand this. Who'd see me like this and not run screaming.



I've tried dating. Regular dating. The kind where you put on real clothes and makeup and pretend you're a functional adult who has her together. It always ends the same way. Three dates, maybe four, and then I start feeling the walls close in because I can't be myself. Can't explain that sometimes I need to come home and color in a coloring book for two hours while drinking from a sippy cup. Can't admit that my bedroom has stuffies lining the shelves and a whole drawer full of onesies and pull-ups.



So I stopped trying. It's been two years since my last relationship, and honestly? This is better. Easier. No one to disappoint when they realize I'm fundamentally broken in a way that makes normal relationships impossible.



I let the pacifier fall from my mouth, letting it dangle from the clip attached to my onesie, and reach for my sippy cup. The apple juice is cold and sweet and perfect. I take three long gulps before setting it back on the coffee table, already thinking about what snack I want.



My stomach growls. Goldfish crackers, maybe. Or the fruit snacks shaped like cartoon characters that I definitely did not buy in the kids' section of the grocery store while avoiding eye contact with everyone.



The fruit snacks are on top of my refrigerator. I put them up there this morning in a fit of organization, thinking I'd grab them later when I wanted them.



I unfold myself from the bean bag, my legs a little stiff from being curled up so long. The carpet is soft under my bare feet as I pad into my small kitchen. The light above the stove casts everything in a warm glow, and I can see my reflection in the microwave. Messy bun on top of my head, pacifier dangling against my chest, onesie stretched across my hips.



I look ridiculous. I look perfect. I look like me.



The fruit snacks are just out of reach, even when I stretch on my tiptoes. Of course they are. Because I'm five-foot-three on a good day and apparently past-Abigail thought she was a giant this morning.



My desk chair is right there, the one with wheels that I usually push under my desk in the corner of the living room where I sometimes work from home. I drag it over to the fridge, not thinking much about it beyond getting my snacks and going back to my show.



The chair rolls easily across the laminate floor. Too easily, maybe, but I'm already climbing onto it, one knee on the seat, then the other foot finding purchase. I rise up, steadying myself with one hand on top of the fridge, reaching with the other.



My fingers brush the box of fruit snacks.



The chair moves.



It happens so fast. One second I'm reaching, the next the chair is rolling out from under me and I'm falling. My hip clips the counter on the way down and then there's the coffee table, the corner of it, and my leg is bending in a way that legs should not bend and then there's a sound.



A crack. Sharp and horrible and wet.



I hit the floor and the pain is immediate and blinding and wrong. So completely and utterly wrong that for a moment I can't even process what's happened. My brain is just screaming wrong wrong wrong while my body tries to curl in on itself.



I can't curl. Something is wrong with my leg. Very wrong.



I make a sound. It's high and thin and animal, nothing like my regular voice, and it echoes in my small apartment. My vision swims and I think I might throw up. I force myself to breathe through my nose, in and out, trying to get control while my nervous system does its best to make me pass out.



Don't look. Don't look at your leg. Just breathe.



I look.



My left leg is wrong. The shin is wrong. There's a bump that shouldn't be there and oh god, oh god, there's something white poking through my skin and that's bone. That's my bone. I can see my bone.



The scream that comes out of me is raw and terrified and makes my throat hurt. My hands are shaking. My whole body is shaking. The pain is like nothing I've ever felt before, radiating up from my leg in hot waves that make my teeth chatter.



I need help. I need help right now.



My phone. Where's my phone? Coffee table. I'm on the floor next to the coffee table. I twist, gasping when the movement sends fresh agony through my leg, and grab blindly until my fingers close around my phone.



Nine-one-one. I need to call nine-one-one.



But I'm wearing a onesie. I'm wearing a diaper. There's a pacifier clipped to my chest and Mr. Whiskers is three feet away, staring at me with his button eyes. My living room is full of evidence. The coloring books on the coffee table. The sippy cup. The episode of Bluey still playing on the television, Bandit's voice a cheerful backdrop to my nightmare.



I can't. I can't have strangers come here and see all of this.



Another wave of pain rolls through me and I sob, the sound ugly and desperate. My leg is broken. Badly broken. Compound fracture, some distant part of my brain supplies helpfully, the part that took anatomy in college. The bone is through the skin. This isn't something I can just walk off or wrap in an ace bandage. This is hospital-level bad.



My fingers are slick with sweat as I unlock my phone. The screen is too bright, the numbers swimming in front of my eyes. I tap nine. I tap one. I tap one again.



The ringing seems to last forever.



""Nine-one-one, what's your emergency?""



""I fell."" My voice comes out thin and shaky, small in a way that has nothing to do with how I was feeling ten minutes ago. ""My leg. I think it's broken. I can see... there's bone. I can see bone.""



""Okay, I need you to stay calm for me. What's your address?""



I rattle it off, the numbers and street name coming automatically even though my brain feels like static. The dispatcher's voice is professional and soothing and I cling to it like a lifeline while she asks me questions. Can I move? No. Am I bleeding? I don't think so. Am I alone? Yes.



Yes, I'm alone. I'm always alone. And now I'm alone and broken on my living room floor wearing a diaper and there's a box of fruit snacks somewhere near my head that I'll never be able to look at again without wanting to die.



""Paramedics are on their way. I need you to stay on the line with me, okay? Don't try to move.""



As if I could. The pain is making me light-headed now, a dizzy rushing feeling that makes the room tilt. I let my cheek rest against the cool floor and try to focus on breathing. In through my nose. Out through my mouth. Don't think about what I'm wearing. Don't think about what they're going to see.



But that's all I can think about.



My little space. My private, safe, sacred space. About to be violated by strangers who will take one look at me and know. They'll know everything. They'll see the onesie and the diaper and the pacifier and they'll know exactly what I am.



Shame burns hot in my chest, competing with the pain for dominance. This is my worst nightmare. This is every anxiety spiral I've ever had made real. I want to crawl out of my own skin. I want to wake up and have this be a terrible dream.



But it's not a dream. It's real. My leg is shattered and help is coming and there's nothing I can do to hide what I am.



""Abigail? Are you still with me?"" The dispatcher's voice cuts through my spiraling thoughts.



""Yeah. I'm here.""



""Good. The paramedics are close. Just a few more minutes. You're doing great.""



I'm not doing great. I'm the opposite of great. I'm broken and exposed and about to be humiliated in front of medical professionals who will probably put it in their group chat later. You'll never guess what we walked into tonight.



I close my eyes and try to pretend I'm somewhere else. Anywhere else. But the pain won't let me drift. It keeps me anchored to this moment, to this reality, to the sound of sirens getting closer.



The television is still going. Bluey's theme song plays again and I almost laugh except it would hurt too much. This episode will be ruined for me forever. This whole night will be ruined forever. This might ruin everything.



The sirens are loud now. Right outside. The dispatcher is saying something about them being here, about how I can hang up now, about how they'll take good care of me.



I end the call and let my phone fall from my hand.



There are voices in the hallway. Heavy footsteps. Professional, efficient sounds of people who do this every day and have seen everything.



They haven't seen this.



I grab the edge of my blanket and try to pull it over myself but it doesn't reach far enough. Doesn't cover the onesie or the obvious bulk of the diaper or any of the dozens of ways this apartment screams what I am.



There's a knock on the door. Firm and authoritative.



""Paramedics!""



My heart is beating so hard I can feel it in my throat. This is it. This is the moment where my carefully constructed walls come crashing down and there's nothing I can do to stop it.



Another knock, more insistent.



""Abigail Goodwin? Paramedics. We're coming in.""



The door opens.

Fast forward this year early 2025 I helped my parents to move in a new village and I saw him! I was like shocked because it turns out he's our neighbor. I was like walking one time and I saw him with his friends. I feel like he looks at me and I messaged my friends haha like I'm delusional. Then later that night I was so freaking nervous and shocked because he approached me and asked my name the rest was history. However we didn't end up because his emotional traits didn't match with mine then we didn't see each other again even though we're just neighbors. Then I went back to my city since vacation is over and I manifested him for many months where his emotional characteristic matches mine but I feel like nothing happened. Then yesterday I went to the city again to get my parent's presents for me then I stopped by at coffee shop and I saw him there with his big bike! He looks at me and I stare at him back. He was about to leave the coffee shop then he went back again but that's it lol he didn't even say hi to me. ,1,1765334877.0,Manifestation,1,1.0,False

I would like to see Lunar New Year added back. It's celebrated internationally, not just local to a single country, and also celebrated by a large portion of the US and Canada, as well.     
Salted egg yolk could be an interesting seasonal ingredient, or red bean (adzuki bean) as a sauce base. Lantern 🏮 shaped tomato, fu (福) 🧧or chun (春) shaped pineapple, and maybe gold coin 🪙 or dumpling 🥟 shaped fish.     
Some decor could be couplings (lucky red papers put in windows) with cheese or pepperoni pizzas on them (because they are LNY colours). A round table with a lazy Susan in the middle would be cool, too. And there could be a sign in event where you get a red envelope every day with things like gems, money, a free item, 2x tips, etc. 

Another event could be Children's Day. There could be toy themed items, such as: building block counter, toy cash register, etch-a-sketch type tablet case, doll house counter item, baby bottle tip jar, clunky plastic colourful tables, and cute window stickers. 

Grandparents' Day could feature things like doilies for the tables, an accounting book in place of the register, a cookie tin tip jar, a cup of tea or coffee as counter decor, rocking chairs, repurposed sewing machine tables, etc. 

Too make room for adding more/different events and holidays, they could alternate how often new material is made for the major holidays. Christmas 2025 has new material, so to free up artist time to do LNY, Christmas 2026 could have just a re-release of previous Christmas items, plus maybe new topping skins or a log in event.

Once I got everything into my car, one of the milkshakes slightly over in the drink holder and spilled very minimally, still fine to deliver. As I turned off the lot, that same shake popped out of the holder and onto the floor. I went back to the store to have it remade and the workers were incredibly kind about it. They gave me a bunch of napkins so I could clean up my car and quickly remade it, no charge. I messaged the driver to let them know I was going back and why, then messaged them again when I was on the way. I drove very carefully there and even kept a hand on the drink holder to make sure it stayed in place.

Now before I go into the wildest part of this story, let’s talk about the packaging. I’ve delivered many of beverage-only/multi-beverage orders and have never had any issues. Most places package multi drinks and just drinks in general very well. Each shake was in the ordinary shake container, and each placed in a disposable coffee cup, and each placed inside your standard drink carrier (think BK or Taco Bell). These cups were pretty thick so didn’t fit all that securely in the carrier. On top of that, the very large hole of the milkshake lid is covered with a round sticker that doesn’t fully seal/fully make contact with the entire open circle, and then there are tabs on the side of the sticker circle that stick onto the side of the cups. Not a great design and already pretty flimsy as the worker accidentally ripped a tab as he sealed the remade drink and had to grab a new one.

Ok. Now to it. I get to the house 10 minutes after the original drop off time which I was already stressed about even though I had already informed the customer of. I double checked the orders to make sure I was delivering the shakes to the right place. As I’m doing this, one of the shakes pops out of the container and hits the floor… milkshake EVERYWHERE. Then, another one pops out and hits the floor. Then, the third one pops out and hits the passenger seat. WHATTTTT?!? I was literally mortified and so lost on what to do. Cancel the order? That would mean I’d be canceling both and didn’t want to inconvenience yet another customer. So I called the customer, explained the situation and let them know I’d still deliver since I was literally in front of their home, but that they’d want to call Door Dash to receive a refund and have a new order made. He seemed ok enough about it, I’m sure this was upsetting but he didn’t react in a bad way. I then  delivered the next order and closed out for the night. I only did 3 orders tonight but I just had to end after that. What a night🫠",2,1765334464.0,DoorDashDrivers,1,1.0,False

This is surprisingly hard to search for, as Googling ""coffee travelers"" brings up coffee recommendations for people traveling to Seattle, and different places have their own terminology. What I've found so far is:

* Obviously **Starbucks** does their 96oz travelers, both caffeinated & decaf, for $20
* **Cafe Vita** does a 96oz ""Joe To Go"" box, caffeinated only, for $50, need to order 30 minutes ahead
* **Diva Espresso** does coffee caddies, price not shown online, need to call it in 48 hours ahead

The Starbucks travelers are the most common, but I'd love to mix things up and also support local spots.

For consideration - I mainly use nunchaku variants of models for image generation, haven't messed with video at all (though may some day want to mess with it), and LLMs I generally use either my Perplexity or Gemini Pro subscriptions. So my main concern is image generation.

I currently have a 3090 build with 64gb ram and a i9-11900k. I have the ability to buy an Alienware x16 r2 laptop with a rtx 4090, core ultra 9, and 32gb ram for $1,500.

Will I take a hit in image generation or performance? (with nunchaku variants - I know with the 16gb vram I won't be able to load the larger models I can on my 3090, but even 24gb isn't enough for many models)

The main reason I am considering this - I hate being tied down to my desk. Being able to go to a coffee shop, out on my couch, or anywhere else sounds very appealing. But if there's a hit to generation times, etc, I wouldn't like that. I am here asking as ai says the Alienware would be as fast or faster than the 3090 PC I have in regards to nunchaku models...and I don't know if I believe that.

41M just moved to Burnaby near Metrotown and is looking to create a group of 5 to 7 close friends, a mix of M and Fs.

Although I'm not new to Greater Vancouver, I haven't had a sense of a friend group since I left Edmonton or Toronto years ago. You know the intimate circle of 5-7 people, where you had all-nighters working to finish that class project, or all joined the same athletic club, or a set of people to get coffee with during the breaks to talk about why the ending of Lost was \[horrible/amazing\].

I think ideally:

* East Asian group (b/c similar enough culture)
* English speaking
* 30-45 (b/c similar generation, stage of life)
* Male and Female (when else can you get the opinion from the opposite sex)
* Stylish, confident, fun (gotta find people similar to myself, am I riiiigght?)

The entire group doesn't have to do everything together. I would encourage smaller clusters (e.g., ""The gamers,"" ""The Protein Shakes,"" ""The hikers,"" ""The ones who bake,"" ""The coffee duo"") to meet 1:1 or 2:1.  This is where depth is maintained. Ultimately, it would be the monthly Dim Sum ritual that would hold us together, or a replacement group gathering for seasonal events throughout the year.

It's essential to have a platonic group of friends who are confident and value having a life outside of their relationship, so you always have a fresh story or two that your partner wasn't there for. I believe that committing to building strong bonds with new people will likely increase your longevity, be a good time for reinvention, or give you a good laugh or two.

I have a whole basket of medication on a strict schedule, and supposedly it will start working ""eventually"". In the meantime, I'm stuck in bed. Can't sit or stand for more than 3 min without pain, and only if I've been laying down for hours before hand. My mom has to make my food and do my dishes/laundry, among other tasks that require more than 3min of standing. I'm spending an absurd amount of time lying down, as it's the only position that doesn't hurt. I have been getting up every couple hours and walking around, took a shower and made coffee today, sat in a chair while my mom cleaned out my fridge. 

I've been slowly working up to this level up pain for about a month, so I've already spent a month or so resting and staying home when I wanted to go out and taking long walks every couple days and at least short walks every day. No more walks for me now. With ""insignificant"" MRI results, I've exhausted my medical intervention quota with Kaiser. 

This is all to say... I'm fucking bored. 🥲🥹

For context: I grew up in rural Tennessee, had a great childhood and love visiting my family back home, they make a lot of remarks about wanting me to live closer but I’m simply not built for *southern living (*the unbearable heat and humidity). 

I lived in Atlanta for a couple years, DC for three more, and recently relocated to Pittsburgh. I’m enjoying the “small town” city vibe here, the relative walkability, and the people…it just doesn’t feel quite like home. 

I’ve always loved the coast and New England, and would like to explore that area for my next move in search of my “forever home”. I work remotely, so I have full flexibility as far as location goes and I make decent money — can afford $3k up to $4k in rent. I’m open to anything from Maine down through Connecticut. I’ve got friends in DC and New York, and it would be nice to be able to hop on a train to see them (train rides from Pitt are ~8ish hours). 

A few considerations that are top of mind: 

- Walkability is crucial, I want to feel safe walking around my community, to coffee shops, restaurants, bars, and ideally the coast, or a short drive from the coast. 
- A solid local food and brewery scene
- Doesn’t have to be a huge city, I’m happy with medium and even small towns so long as I’m near enough (~1 hour) to a decent dating pool. 
- Outdoor activities are another draw, so nearby trails, parks, beaches, etc. 
- I visit friends and family often, so being within reach of a good airport with direct flights is a big plus. 

Cities I’ve been considering include Portsmouth, Portland, Providence, Salem, Boston, New Haven, Newport, and Milford. 

Are any of these areas a strong contender in your opinion? Or vice versa if one of these is not worth it (high crime, poor food scene, etc). Any towns or cites I’ve missed that I should visit to get a feel for the place? ",3,1765333646.0,SameGrassButGreener,2,1.0,False

1piqpkr,https://i.redd.it/c3imr2uvda6g1.png,I finally stopped failing at huge goals by switching to 5-minute Micro-Habits. Built a simple app to automate the process.,"I've been a lurker here for a while, constantly feeling overwhelmed by all the amazing habits people seem to maintain. Every time I started a big goal (like ""work out for an hour"" or ""write a chapter""), I'd fail by day three. Sound familiar?

That's why I started experimenting with the **micro-habit** method, and it truly changed everything. My main challenge became remembering to do the tiny things consistently.

# 💡 What I Did Differently

1. **Tiny Steps Only:** Everything became 5 minutes or less (e.g., ""10 push-ups,"" ""write 3 sentences,"" ""drink a glass of water"").
2. **The Anchor Habit:** I tied new habits to old ones (e.g., *After I pour my coffee, I open the habit app*).
3. **Built an App for It:** Since existing trackers felt too complex, I spent the last few months developing [stopTimetrxy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stoptimetryx.app) specifically to handle this simple, consistent routine building.

# 🚀 What My App Does (And Why I Think You'll Like It)

* **Routine Flow Builder:** Instead of just a daily list, you build a *sequence* of micro-habits that flow logically through your morning, work, or evening.
* **Zero-Friction Completion:** Designed for one-tap completion. The goal is to spend less than 30 seconds *in* the app per session.
* **Simple Stats:** Tracks your **consistency streak** without overwhelming you with complex charts.

I’m really proud of how it turned out and how much it’s helped me stay on track.

Please purchase this novel as the way I describe things are not at all close to the level of detail found within

Several kills were added:

Another Employee at the Institution where Victoria was held is killed after Victoria and Art let the patients loose, which proceed to mob and kill him

Victoria calls a Food Delivery guy over and kills him to feed Art, who was starting to rot sitting in the chair for so long

Sienna's Psychologist is interrogated by Art and Victoria, she dies after the two begin digging into her brain after they slice off the top of her skull.

It's implied that Art kills the women he nearly runs into at the beginning of the bar scene, as he follows them down a dark alley and the scene cuts away.

The Mall Santa is now a buff guy named Bill. He's actually a replacement because their usual Santa didn't show, that Santa of course being the one Art murdered for his suit. Art attacks him in the bathroom with the Liquid Nitrogen sprayer and slices his face off to wear.

Santa's Elf also goes to check on Mall Santa in the bathroom and is stabbed in the face by Art.

After the mall explosion, Art goes to a coffee shop and kills everyone there after they notice blood on his face and freak out. After this he goes around killing people to replace what he sees as an ugly Nativity Scene, replacing the plastic statues with real corpses.

He winds up in the Historic District and kills a man offering people horse-drawn tours by snapping his neck. He then proceeds to use the horse  and buggy as a weapon and runs over a bunch of people.

Art arrives at the Frat Christmas Party and kills an annoying Serial Killer fanboy named Zach by ripping his stomach and intestines out through his mouth. Zach also bothers Jonathan near the beginning of the book by trying to get him to talk about the murders and claims he's Allie's distant cousin to try and bond since they're both ""victims"" of Art

Jonathan comes across Cole and Mia's corpses in the shower and found that they were additionally mutilated as they'd been mashed together as one after their deaths and were impaled on the showerhead.

Other assorted Facts:

Sienna has a dream/vision where she sees the prior victims of Art as children, including a child Tara from Terrifier 1. They're in a classroom/daycare and Tara mentions that a nice man they call Pop-Pop comes in to check on them from time to time and tells them that soon a beautiful angel will take them to the ""The Light Place"". Sienna can see outside the window in this dream and notices the sky is blood-red. Suddenly, the kids get excited as ""Pop-Pop"" appears outside the window. he's described as a Man of Middle Eastern descent with a beard and long hair, wearing a robe (Jesus??). He disappears after this. Notably, among the children she sees one that vaguely looks like Jonathan, but she can't 100% confirm it's him.

She also sees her father during a hallucination, who appears as a burning figure, and he makes sure to tell her: ""I am always with you."" During Jess's death, she sees the same burning figure (Michael) and he says something to her which seems to calm her down. It's noted that Art and Victoria don't see the Burning Figure or react to its presence.

  
Jonathan also has a dream where he talks to his Mom, she looks normal and says that she's visiting him from the other side. She says that Dad would visit him too, but he's ""busy"". She tells Jonathan that he needs to be strong, stronger than ever before. She finally tells him that she loves him before Sienna's phone call wakes him up. It's a touching scene.

During the final fight after Gabbie and the sword fall in the hellhole, Sienna thinks that her and the sword are one in the same and that she'll be able to track it and find Gabbie.

It's implied that Art is going to kill the woman reading the 9th Circle at the end as he pulls out a hacksaw on the bus.

The story about the kids being killed and buried under the house that Art and Victoria rest in is confirmed to be true.

To make the Liquid Nitrogen gun work, Art utilizes a tooth given to him by Victoria to power it. She just pulls her tooth out and Art uses it to power the weapon, which he internally dubs ""The Frostbiter"".

Over the course of the book, Victoria/The Entity has pet rats, one specifically named ""Pestilent"" that she ends up killing after the construction of the crown of thorns. These rats and The Entity have a psychic connection.

Art was able to find Jonathan because he ate a piece of his flesh back in Terrifier 2. This is also how he was able to find Victoria after she was admitted to the mental hospital.",5,1765333218.0,terrifier,4,1.0,False

**BLURB**

Lifelong Queens cabbie, Herbert Pretty, inherits a small-town diner from a longtime passenger. He plans to stay just long enough to flip it or let it fail — either way, no harm done. His wife and son remain in the city; a few hours feel like two universes away.

But Caitlin’s Kitchen won’t let him leave unchanged. With a skeleton crew of misfits and a town caught between yesterday and tomorrow, Herbert discovers some places don’t serve food, they offer alternate routes. And an understanding of how what once was, need not always be.

  


**CHAPTER ONE**

Rain stitched the city together in gray thread.

It slid down the windshield in crooked veins and turned Queens into a wet reflection of itself. Herbert Pretty kept one hand on the wheel and the other resting near the heater dial he never quite trusted. The cab smelled faintly of old coffee and vinyl. His smell. His life, condensed into upholstery and routine.

Ms. Caitlin Grammer sat behind him, purse folded neatly on her lap, coat buttoned all the way to her chin. She rode with him like always, quiet at first, watching the rain crawl across the glass like it might tell her something new.

“So,” Herbert said eventually, easing into traffic. “Rain’s got opinions today.”

She smiled at that. “It always does.”

Their conversations were like this: small, unassuming, built from years of repetition. Weather. Traffic. The price of coffee creeping upward like it was trying to escape. Sometimes she’d ask about Ginger. Sometimes about Ethan. Herbert never asked much about her beyond polite shapes of curiosity. Some people carried their stories close. He respected that.

They waited at a red light beneath a flickering pharmacy sign. Ms. Caitlin shifted in her seat.

“Herbert,” she said.

“Yes, ma’am?”

She reached into her purse and took out a white envelope. Plain. No writing. No weight to it that he could tell beyond paper and whatever meaning she’d folded into it. She leaned forward and slid it between the two front seats.

“I’d like you to keep this.”

Herbert glanced at it, then back at the road as the light turned green. “Am I allowed to ask what’s in it?”

She considered that. “You’ll know when to open it.”

He huffed a small laugh. “That sounds like the beginning of a bad movie.”

She smiled the way she always did. Wise, not condescending. Someone Herbert’s late father would call ‘a real lady.’

He eased the envelope into the glove box at the next stoplight but didn’t close it yet. The rain intensified, loud against the roof. He glanced at her in the mirror. “You planning something, ma’am?”

Ms. Caitlin looked out the window as if the answer might be written in water on brick. “I’m seventy-six, Herbert,” she said gently. “I plan to plan nothing.”

Herbert nodded, pretending that made complete sense.

The rest of the ride passed quietly. When he dropped her off, she tipped him more than usual and rested her hand on his arm for just a moment longer than necessary.

“Drive safe,” she said.

Herbert nodded and watched all the way as she entered the building, unaware that something had already been placed out of sight, politely waiting for the moment it would finally be opened.

  
\---

Rain again.

It fell softer today, steadier, the kind that soaked through collars and seams without making a fuss about it. A handful of umbrellas bloomed in dull colors across the small cemetery: black, navy, one tired red that looked accidental rather than deliberate.

Herbert stood at the back.

He didn’t know where else to stand.

The service was modest. No grand speeches. No swelling music. Just a few rows of folding chairs, the quiet murmur of acquaintances who had known Ms. Caitlin in narrow, everyday ways; across counters, through morning coffee, over decades of ordinary transactions. The priest spoke gently. Someone sniffed. The rain kept time.

Herbert kept his hands folded in front of him, head bowed more out of uncertainty than reverence. He hadn’t known her well, not really. He knew her voice ordering destinations. The rhythm of her small talk. The exact way she said his name.

Herbert.

He felt oddly exposed, standing there among strangers who had known parts of her he never would.

A man in a dark suit approached him quietly from the side during a pause in the service. Late forties, neat hair, expression soft with practiced professionalism.

“Mr. Pretty?” he asked.

Herbert nodded.

“I’m Larry Earnshaw. Ms. Caitlin’s lawyer.” He offered a restrained handshake. “We’ll need to talk later.”

Herbert’s chest tightened for reasons he couldn’t yet name. “Later when?”

“Soon,” Larry said, kindly but firmly. Then he stepped back into the folds of the gathering.

That was when Herbert noticed the young woman.

She stood apart from the others near a crooked maple at the edge of the cemetery. Blonde hair pulled into a severe ponytail. Black coat too thin for the weather. Her posture was attentive but withdrawn, like someone waiting for instructions no one was giving her. She smiled occasionally when someone approached her, but she never initiated. Not once.

Their eyes met briefly.

He nodded, following established protocol.

She clocked that. Did not nod back. Looked away.

As I read the words, they echoed in my mind.
She is perfect.

The handwriting was neat. Careful, almost gentle. That made it worse.
I kept staring until the letters blurred together. Each time I blinked, I saw the flash of the camera again, white and violent behind my eyes.

My sister was still asleep in the other bed, face pressed into the hotel pillow. I didn’t want to wake her. I just needed air. I know I wouldn’t be able to sleep.

The sun was barely up when I found myself back at the coffee shop. Habit dragged me there before reason could stop me. I needed fuel. I couldn’t rest and needed some sort of pick me up.

The bell above the door chimed the same way it always did. Same stale smell of beans and sugar. Same barista behind the counter. Mark, I think. The guy who always remembered my order, asked about my day, laughed at the dumb jokes I made. It was nice to see a friendly face. 

“Rough night?” he said, smiling. “Haven’t seen you this early in a while.”

I forced a grin, slid a few crumpled bills across the counter. “Yeah. Something like that.”

He wrote my name on the cup, like always. The pen scraped lightly against the cardboard. The sound piercing my ears as if I was hungover from emotions.

As he made his way over to the counter to hand me my coffee he slid the money back to me. 

“This one is on the house. Hopefully a nice start to a perfect day.”

That word. That god damn word. 

“She is PERFECT.” Those 3 words ringing in my head again.

I let out an uncomfortable laugh as I said “Thanks, man.”

He slid the coffee over to me. My name on the cup in red marker. 

The handwriting, it looked familiar. I had seen this before. Was I just being delusional? I’m not sure. But I FELT like I had seen it before.

“She misses you, you know.”

I slowly began to look up.

“What?”

“Your niece, I’m sure she misses you.”

What was happening? The news, he must have seen it on the news. The case was getting a lot of coverage over the last 24 hours. 


“Yeah,” I said, clearing my throat. “It’s… it’s been rough on everyone.”

Mark nodded, still smiling that same easy smile. But something about his eyes didn’t match. They were focused, like he was studying me.

“She came in here with you that one time.” He said softly. “Hot chocolate, extra whipped cream. Cute kid.”

My stomach tightened.

“You remember that?”

“Of course. I remember everyone who walks through that door.”

“Listen, I should…”

“You left this here last time.”

Mark reached under the counter and slid a small paper sleeve toward me. A corner of glossy paper peeked out.

My chest tightened. I pulled it free just enough to see the image and everything inside me went still.

It was my niece’s school photo. The same one that hung on my sister’s fridge. The same one I kept in my wallet, behind my badge.

“Where did you get this?”

Mark smiled, kind and unbothered, like we were talking about the weather. “Your sister should really lock her windows.”

The coffee shop noise seemed to fade, replaced by a dull ringing in my ears. My hand drifted instinctively toward my holster.

“Don’t” he said quietly. “If you pull that thing out, you’ll never see her again.”

My throat went dry.

“Where is she?” I managed.

He leaned forward, elbows on the counter. His voice softened, almost pitying.
“You told me all about her. Her name. Her school. The way she scrunches her nose when she laughs. You even showed me this picture yourself.”

I tried to remember. I didn’t want to believe it but I could hear myself doing it. Talking too much over coffee. Filling silence with small talk.

He slid the photo closer. My name was written on the back in red ink.

“She’s perfect” he whispered. “Just like you said.”

The bell over the door chimed behind me. Someone came in for their morning latte. I blinked and the photo was gone. Just my cup of coffee, cooling on the counter.

I looked to Mark. 
 

“If you don’t want her to end up like the others,” he said, barely above a whisper, “you’ll listen to exactly what I say.”

He didn’t blink. He didn’t raise his voice. He just stood there, calm, like we were still two regulars talking about the weather.

My pulse was hammering so hard I thought everyone in the shop could hear it.
“What did you do to her?”

Mark tilted his head slightly, almost disappointed.

“That’s not the question you should be asking.”

A woman behind me laughed at something on her phone. The milk steamer hissed. Life went on, like the world didn’t notice what was happening right in front of them.

“You’re going to go home” he continued. “You’re going to act normal. You’re not going to tell anyone about this conversation. Not your sister, not your detective friends. You’ll hear from me when it’s time. If you do anything stupid, she’ll end up like the others.”

He said it so simply, like it wasn’t a threat just a fact.

I stared at him, waiting for a tremor, a flinch, something. But he just smiled that same polite smile he gave every customer.

“Have a good day, Officer.”

He turned toward the next person in line.
And just like that, I wasn’t a customer anymore. I was a hostage.

I walked out before he could say anything else. The bell over the door chimed behind me, the same cheerful sound I’d heard a hundred times before, but it felt different now, hollow, mocking.

The air outside hit cold against my face. Morning rush hour had started and people were crossing the street with their coffees, laughing, living in a world that hadn’t been flipped upside down.

Mine had.

I stood there on the sidewalk, gripping the cup he’d handed me. The cardboard was warm against my skin, but my hands were shaking. I kept telling myself to breathe, to think, to do something. Call the precinct. Call anyone.

But his words kept replaying in my head.

“You’ll listen to exactly what I say.”

It wasn’t the threat that scared me, it was the certainty. He said it like he’d already won.

Caveats:

Only locally-owned please - no national chains.

We’d like to stick to Austin proper, but if there is one we absolutely cannot skip in the ‘burbs, toss it in for consideration.

We both live/work north/central (think Burnet and North Loop areas) so bonus points for places in that area as we would be able to access them more often if they became a favorite, but I’m also not above buying beans and brewing my espresso at home if my favorite turns out to be far south/north.

1piqdk0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1piqdk0,A Japanese Self Defense Force Ration (and my 26th country!!!),"Hi folks!

What we have here, other than my 26th country, is a 2021 JSDF ration with a best by date of March 2024. No worries on that date as everything was of sound quality!

This was a very small ration, consisting of only about 775 kcal between the 3 items. It's also pretty bare bones in terms of frills, including an eating tray and spork along with the 3 meal items, that's it (see pic 4). No drinks, no desserts, no coffee, no snacks, no gum. That being said, it was a great experience and each food item was great!

Pic 1 shows the rice topped with the scrambled eggs! I added some crushed red pepper just to kick it up a notch! Look at how gorgeous that dish looks!

Pics 2-7 show packaging and contents including English translations so you all can know what was inside!

Pic 8 shows the scrambled eggs! Yes, it looks terrible,  but I assure you, once you get a whiff, you're gonna be very interested. It almost has a somewhat Smokey aroma. The texture is quite soft (this was heated in boiling water for about 12 min) and they are definitely portable!

Pic 9 shows the rice dish. This had a great aroma as well and absolutely fantastic texture! This was made to receive that egg mixture over it like in Pic 1. A great combo that was actually quite hearty. 

Pics 10-11 show, what I'll consider to be, the star of the show! This is pasta,  plain and simple, but, it's some of the best I've ever had in a ration and it came from the Japanese military! Now, I will admit, this sauce is thick and very flavorful, but it's actually quite sweet as well, and I think that will throw a few folks off. The pasta was very soft, but not mush. And those little sausage slices shown in Pic 10! Fantastic! Couldn't believe how many of those slices were in there! It also had a bunch of mushrooms in it, but I strongly dislike mushrooms so they went to doggo, who loved them!

This ration was a big surprise! That pasta blew me away, and that rice/egg dish looks like it may have come out of a restaurant! What an experience!

My 27th country will be next month and will most likely be a 24hr ration from Denmark!

Take care folks!",9,1765332355.0,MRE,0,0.85,False

**I had a Franceshi Gesha from Datura recently and it was one of my favorite coffees of 2025.** I don't think it was the exact same lot, but at minimum very similar.

Btw, I think Tanat has to be losing money on this calendar. I said before, but I think this is just a gift they're giving to serious coffee nerds. I can't believe these beans. The Datura Franceschi was $42/100g. The DIGNA NUÑEZ LOT 196 that's coming up on Day 18 is $65/100g. And so many others are $$$$ too. **What a treat.**

**Because of the ""GW8"" I'm assuming this one is the Carmen Estate Gesha Washed Lot 8.**

**Brew Guide:**

**I brewed** the Datura Franceschi at 1/18 ratio, Origami or V60. Grind Medium/Medium fine (600 microns-ish - 4.5 on a Timemore 078), Hoffman better 1 cup.

Rogue Wave recommends: Pourover: 1:16-1:17, 92C-95C

**Tasting notes for that bean:**

**Hydrangea:** Plum, Peach, Soft Florals

**Archers:** orange blossom, bergamot, white peach, nectarine, honey

**Rogue Wave:** This washed Geisha is vibrant and sweet with notes that remind us of: Guava, Lime, Botanicals, Pear, Melon, Grape



**Carmen Estate Notes from Archers**: Established in the Paso Ancho district by Efrain and Carmen Francheschi in the 1960s, Carmen Estate boasts a decorated history in the annual Best of Panama, frequently with multiple coffees counting among the top auction lots across the different categories — Geisha Washed, Geisha Natural, and Varietals.

2023 granted Carmen Estate its greatest accolade to date, 1st Place in the Geisha Washed Category, alongside top ranks in Geisha Natural at 9th and 10th, and Varietals at 10th, crowning years of a continuing winning streak.

In 2024, the estate, represented by Jean Paul Langenstein, not only sustained a place within the fiercely competitive Top 10, but secured three spots in the Top 5, 2nd and 4th in the Geisha Natural category and 4th in Varietals.

For more than half a century, the Franceschi family has harnessed the advantages of their farms’ elevation, microclimates, and proximity to the Chiriquí Viejo River to cultivate coffees of remarkable quality and distinctive cup profiles. Their steadfast dedication has positioned Carmen Estate among Panama’s finest, leading the charge in reinforcing the country’s place at the pinnacle of the global coffee industry as a cornerstone of excellence.



**Farm notes from Datura**: The roots of Franceschi Coffee go back to the 1800s, when the Franceschi family emigrated from Corsica (France), to Panama. Over generations, they were involved in farming, cattle ranching, and shipbuilding. In 1950, Carmen Franceschi suggested starting a coffee farm with her husband Efrain, an idea that led to the creation of Carmen Estate, a farm we all know and love.

Carlos Aguilera Franceschi, their grandson and a third-generation coffee producer, carried on the family legacy by embracing innovation and focusing on quality. After selling Carmen Estate, Carlos launched a more personal and artisanal venture: Franceschi Coffee.

Together with his partner Jean Paul Langenstein, Carlos now cultivates Gesha on small plots of land in the Volcán region. They also collaborate with local farmers, sourcing the finest cherries and applying precise processing techniques to bring out the best in every bean.

Franceschi coffee represents the next chapter in a long-standing family tradition, focused on craftsmanship, experimentation, and the relentless pursuit of quality!

1piqaka,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1piqaka/black_dogs_by_liam_vickers_p7/,Black Dogs by Liam Vickers p7,"Chapter 7

Upon entering, Haze’s room, I was instantly greeted by a blast of cold, stagnant air, like something out of an office space. A printer beeped softly in the corner, several binders worth of paper loosely scattered around the central table in the common space. A small dog collar was lying crumpled atop a leather arm chair.

I flinched at this.

One of the rooms was clearly the Governor’s, a pressed suit lying unused atop his bed, which also seemed untouched. The other room, however, was slightly less empty. Casual attire clothing lay discarded on the floor next to a sewing machine. Lining the closet and walls, however, were formal attire suits. Everything else appeared strangely out of focus.

My eyes flashed to see a vacuum cleaner propped up against the far corner.

“Welcome,” Haze’s eyes remained fixed on me.

I nervously tried to steal another glance into her room before she walked over to the door herself, closing it and narrowing her eyes.

“Better not go in here,” she looked nervous, “Nothing for you to see.”

She slipped in through the door and began rummaging around inside.

I took the opportunity to look around the space. Hung beside the entrance door, a framed picture showed the house’s foundation prior to being fully constructed. The grainy black and white photo was hard to make out . . . and strangely unnerving. I softly lifted the picture off the wall to get a closer look before I heard Haze’s door open again. Metal clicked.

I frantically put the picture back on the wall.

I paused when my eyes flashed back to her room. She was nowhere to be seen.

“H- . . . er, Haze?” I stammered, taking a step forward before my foot crunched on glass.

I looked down only to freeze in place. I had stepped on a picture frame, the one I could have sworn I had just placed on the wall. The glass was shattered . . . one of the shards clenched in my hand.

'Why was I holding this shard . . . and why did I feel like I was about to need it? Why did everything suddenly feel wrong?'

“Haze?” I spoke again, a bit more frantically, moving faster across the space to peer into her room. I felt my hand clench tighter on the makeshift blade, hot blood gently slipping down my fingers as I snuck a glance inside. My nerves were thundering blood through my veins, skin prickling with unease.

The space was littered with clothes, but strangely enough, most of them were placed with strange . . . precision. As if covering something up. Many were draped on the wall, others piled in heaps that were a bit too controlled to be random.

'Just what was she doing in here? What was she hiding?'

I steadily walked inside, holding the shard in front me more like a shield than a weapon, calling one more time for Haze before spotting a sweater dead ahead on a dresser. A piece of paper poked out just beneath it.

My hand cautiously reached forward to lift the clothing. My eyes narrowed as I pulled back the fabric, seeing that the paper was littered with text, as if a message to-

“You’re not going to attack me with that, are you?” Haze spoke calmly, directly behind me.

I jumped, whirling around and barely even realizing I had slashed the shard forward before Haze caught it with her wrist, wincing as blood speckled her face. The glass stopped inches from her forehead.

“Oh shit!” I immediately fell pale, letting the shard drop to the ground and backing up in terror, “Oh fuck, fuck, fuck! I’m so sorry!”

“It’s alright,” Haze dropped her arm before her eyes narrowed, “Just drop it.”

I was stunned for a second before my eyes flashed to see that I was still gripping the shard tightly - so much so that flesh was scrapping from my own fingers.

“What?” I flinched, again splaying my fingers to let the object fall, shaking my hand in panic. The glass was stuck in my skin, flesh stretching like putty, yet refusing to release the imbedded object. My movements grew frantic before –

CRACK! Haze spun to kick with unreal force, my hand splitting backwards as her heel snapped against it. I rolled to the ground like a ragdoll, the shard impacting the far wall as bone fragments speckled the carpet.

“I didn’t mean to-” I gasped, rolling in agony, “What is . . .
What the fuck is happening?!”

Haze lowered her leg, steely eyes narrowed in distrust. From her pocket, she brought up a dog collar, the same one from the chair in her living room.

She looked at me as if this was supposed to mean something. I just continued gasping for air, blinking heavily before finally catching a bit of breath and trying to curl back my fingers.

“Wh- . . . what the hell is that?” I gagged, staying on the floor as I watched the leather collar swing back and forth.

“Okay, good,” she finally released her chilling gaze, letting out a relieved exhale, “Welcome back.”

“B- . . . back?” I shuttered, getting back to my feet with ungodly amounts of effort, careful not to get too close to her, “What just . . . I’m so sorry I almost . . . you just broke my hand!”

“Don’t touch anything,” Haze just nodded, strolling out of the room, “Let’s talk.”

I nervously followed after a long pause, the world still swimming through my vision as my hand burned with agony. Despite the immense pain and ghastly bruising, my fingers appeared to function just fine, and the more I looked, the less I seemed to notice the discoloration.

Haze plopped onto the living room couch as I stepped outside. She dropped the collar against the coffee table before looking up to me, gesturing to the other couch.

“Stay a while, will ya?” She nodded, “Now is when things get interesting.”

“Umm, I’m not so sure,” I began walking over slowly, stealing another glance at her room, “I really don’t know- I swear I didn’t break that picture on purpose, I don’t- . . . This is all a misunderstanding. I have no idea what the hell just happened.”

“No one ever does,” Haze rolled onto her back, holding up the collar to the light before throwing it back into the armchair, “But I believe you didn’t mean to. You probably think I’m crazy.”

“You do have your . . . quirks,” I nodded in fear, stiffly standing by the couch opposite her, “I guess I’m slowly learning this. You just ‘Jujitsued’ my hand across the room.”

“Oh it gets worse,” she giggled to herself at my response, looking to me and smiling.

“That’s not . . . comforting . . .” I hesitantly spoke, still standing awkwardly, “Why are you being so . . . nonchalant about all this?! Does stuff like this usually happen or something? I mean, what the fuck!? Do you always act this way around people?”

“Well that’s how it usually goes,” Haze laughed, “People only notice something’s weird when everything else is the same.
Without getting too existential on you here, John, do you really think you wouldn’t feel alone in the presence of others even if no one remembered you?”

This last question had a bitter taste to it. The air chilled in a strange way, her eyes scanning my response.

'Was she . . . was that directed at me? Was I supposed to remember something?'

“That would be . . . lonely,” I finally nodded carefully, sitting down watchfully, “And . . . super fucking weird . . . but it would definitely suck.”

The pain in my hand was all but gone.

“Well, first world problems, I suppose,” she laughed with an air of fakeness I only remembered hearing when we had first talked at the rally. That clearly wasn’t the answer she was looking for.

“In regards to your hand,” she rolled back onto her stomach, holding out her hand and gesturing to mine, “Can I see it?”

I paused, carefully extending my hand towards her, not exactly sure what she was going for.

“I see you’re not nervous anymore” She grasped my hand delicately and gazed at my palm as if about to paint my nails, “Do you even remember what you’re talking about? Or are you going to start talking about the observer expectancy effect?”

“What? Er, right, looking for information to fit the hypothesis you gave,” I carefully nodded, “Even if it doesn’t quite fit. That’s all I remember from science fair, actually, haha. Is . . . that’s not what your actually expecting though, right? The spirit box thing?”

“Oh, but it is,” her eyes dropped as she licked her pointer finger. “Something like that.”

She brought her finger to my hand, beginning to absentmindedly scrub at the writing she had scrawled.

“I must escape.”

“Whoa, er, okay, didn’t like the message after all?” I had to sit awkwardly to extend my arm far enough, “Haha, it was kinda
sinister, I guess.”

She paused for a second before weakening slightly and glancing up to me.

“I just don’t want you to be confused in the morning,” she
wiped at her eyes with her other hand, “Maybe . . . what would you. . . what would you like instead? I’m a bit of an artist.”

 “Hmmm, for a temporary pen tattoo?” I pondered, unable to
keep myself from smiling, “I don’t know. I kinda like jellyfish.”

 “You would,” she sniffled, nearly yanking me off the couch as
she pulled my arm closer, uncapping a pen on the table with her mouth and getting to work diligently, “You fucking moron.”

I waited for several seconds before trying to steal a glance at her handiwork. Her hand pressed against my head, weakly pushing me away as she bit her lip.

“Get out of town,” she blinked away hot tears, slowly getting back to work. I laughed to myself.

“There,” she slumped, “This one isn’t . . . very . . . good.”

Her hands slowly loosened their grip and I formed a confused smile before turning my hand towards myself and stifling an excited laugh.

“Goodbye” was scrawled in clean handwriting. 

“Awww, that’s amazing,” I giggled, “It’s so cute!” Haze just stared at the floor, teeth clenched.

“I’m going to miss this,” she spoke slowly, making me look up. 

“Right, haha,” I grinned, “I, I mean, yeah, me too. Um . . . but?”

 “Shut up, you fucking pattern,” she gritted her teeth, “This was always my favorite part. The first time we sat in this room together I felt . . . I don’t know, this is one of the only happy memories I have. I don’t even think it’s real.”

“De- . . . decision?” I was still trying to focus her words, “What do you-”

“I said SHUT UP!” She snapped, before breaking down again, “I’m not waiting for you any longer. Do you get that? You’ll
fucking ROT here!” Her eyes again narrowed through her tears. 

“I mean . . .” I finally spoke slowly, “I guess . . . I guess I
appreciate you being so open, and you have a weirdly good ability to look at your own flaws . . . so thanks for being so honest, that . . . that can’t be easy.”

“It’s stupid,” Haze slowly stood up, shaking, “Isn’t it? Part of me still wants another animal, maybe two dragons this time . . . but what’s the point anymore, right? I feel safe here in this moment, I always have. It’s what gets me through the horror of it all, but it’s all pretend isn’t it? Haha, how pathetic am I? I’ve been pretending for so long, looking forward to this each time…but you’re not really here, are you? I’m talking to a tape recorder.”

“But I guess, and maybe I should feel bad about this,” I
continued, saying the words as I found them, “But I really didn’t care about any of that, the bad things, I mean. You seem alright to me, and you’ve been nothing but nice to me . . . so, like, I don’t know, is that weird? I can’t really forgive you for things you did to other people, but I can still be your friend right? I personally like you.”

“I thought you might say that,” Haze bowed her head, tears hitting the carpet as she walked across the room.

“Goodbye John.” She whispered softly, closing the door behind her.

“So, I guess that’s everything on my end?” I slowly put out my hand for the pen, “I don’t really know where that puts us, but . . . would you like an animal as well? I don’t know if I can make something quite as good as this beauty, but I’m willing to give it a shot.”

Silence.

The lights above me flickered.

The slightest trail of blood ran down my arm as several divots softly formed. Haze was nowhere in the room, everything faint and dull.

“So, I guess that’s everything on my end?” I slowly put out my hand for the pen, “I don’t really know where that puts us, but . . . would you like an animal as well? I don’t know if I can make something quite as good as this beauty, but I’m willing to give it a shot.”

The lights above me flickered.

The slightest trail of blood ran down my arm as several divots softly formed. Haze was nowhere in the room, everything faint and dull.

I looked around in confusion before staring at my empty hand.

'What was . . . something wasn’t right.'

My stomach knotted up, my legs softly brining be up from the couch as I blinked heavily.

“H- Haze?” I spoke slowly, quickly seeing that she was nowhere in sight. I took one peek into her room, eyes narrowing on the strung up clothes before thinking better of invading her privacy. I moved back to the front door, creaking it open and peering outside into the manor.

Snow softly drifted from the rafters, blood squelching beneath my feet as I stepped outside. The lobby was entirely empty, save for the piles of snow accumulating on the railings. Moonlight highlighted pale flesh scattered in ribbons across several spine filled craters in the floorboards.

Suddenly, however, a faint glint caught my eye, the same thing I steadily made my way down the stairs toward.

Its dirty copper sheen flickered in the faint moonlight, clanking softly as I picked it up to examine it.

The windup clock.

'How the heck did it get out here?'

Thankfully, Aunt Cheryl was just up ahead in the lobby, turning around at my approach as I help up the clock in confusion.

Her lonely form was out of place and haunting in the darkness, her paper pale skin appearing almost grey if it weren’t for the ghastly tear marks beginning to leave her midsection to spill gore to the ground. Her crusted eyes were ringed with dead black, her tired gaze filled with death.

""Two nights, is what Mr. Borden's agent said,"" She looked like she was trying to remember, mouth unhinged as if broken, ""But you can't tell anyone that, okay?""

""Huh, what?"" I slowly came to a stop, limbs faltering as I felt a weight relieve itself from my right side, ""Oh, right, okay . . . I mean, security reasons, I guess probably. Well, it's a big manor, lots of rooms with lots of different people. I'll be fine . . . Unless I'm cleaning her room.""

My arm slopped to the ground with a loud squelch, stretched elastic skin splitting like ribbons at the bite mark.

""Maybe, maybe not,"" Cheryl grinned a smile that ruptured past her broken face, before jutting to her feet as her phone went off. ""Yes?"" She answered hastily. Her torso began to slide from her lacerated midsection, massive bite marks like a great white shark revealing themselves as blood spilled to the floor.

The dead skin of her wrist flayed like paper in the wind, her ghastly bones breaking through the rotting flesh, phone not even in her hand as she walked towards the front door and haphazardly waved me goodbye, ""It's about time! Yes! Of course there's a lot of luggage! Yes I need both of you!""

I breathed heavily, walking up the master staircase to the second floor. I took a few seconds to marvel at the massive glass chandelier dangling precariously above the lobby, as I did every time I walked up the steps.

Tonight, its grand, elegant form appeared particularly mocking. 

The clock in my pocket ticked softly.


Chapter 8

A knock on my door woke me up with painful difficulty. My eyes groggily opened with searing pain as I checked my phone.

5:00

It wasn't even light out yet. I had probably slept less than an hour. The wind-up clock on my dresser had stopped midway through the night.

""Come on.” Aunt Cheryl promoted from the other side of the door, ""You already had your day off, Mr., let's get to it.""

""S- . . . Sorry,"" I rubbed my eyes, sitting up and wincing, ""My alarm . . . The clock in my room stopped running.""

""Take it to Royce,"" she responded, ""Once you've had some breakfast. Your schedule is on the service counter.""

""Right,"" I nodded to my empty room, ""Thanks Cheryl."" 

""Sure thing,"" she cheered, ""I'm talking to contractors all day
today, so if you or anyone else needs me, you'll have to wait until after 6. Or just text me.""

""Gotcha,"" I responded, swinging my legs off the bed and getting to my feet, ""See you later then.""

Her footsteps receded away from my door, but the sounds quickly muted away as my eyes caught my hand.

“Goodbye” was scrawled across it in clean handwriting.
I hesitated to stare at this for some time, turning it every which way to figure out if I remembered putting it there. The handwriting didn’t look like anything I recognized . . . how long had this thing been there?
 
Taking all of my willpower to convince myself that it must have been Syliva or Royce, and that I would ask them later, I jammed a toothbrush in my mouth and hurriedly searched for my winter coat.

It looked cold out today.

The towering mountains daunting the manor were being choked out by grey mist, a light constant drizzle tapping fingers at the glass of my window.

I had plenty of time to grab my coat, placing my gardening gloves into my pocket before casually strolling towards the door.

At the last minute, I also grabbed the clock, nodding to myself as a congratulations for remembering it. I went to open the door before pausing.

It was layered with scratches, almost as if someone had tried to claw their way out.

'But that wasn’t quite it. They were almost more like . . . tick marks?'

I paused for several seconds of sheer silence before blinking heavily to watch them disappear. I frowned, rubbing my eyes in disbelief and glancing around the room to see if something was wrong with my vision.

After confirming to myself I had apparently just experienced a strange temporary hallucination, I cautiously turned back to the door and opened it.

The hallway was empty.

But more than that . . . It somehow felt . . . cold.
I paused for some time. The wall mounted lamps flickered softly with occasional pulsing, the carpet beneath my feet catching my shadow as it stretched long across it.

'Strange. With multiple light sources in the hallway, such a strong single shadow was . . .'

I turned to look behind me. A mirrored version of the hallway receded into infinity, deafening silence seeping from it to block even the sound of my own pulse. A faint, murky fog languidly drifted across some unseen barrier, curling softly upwards.

I didn’t turn around, but rather the reflection became my new orientation, the master staircase coming into view as I leisurely walked across the carpet. Nothing appeared particularly strange about the worldly distortions, the only thing gnawing at my heart an unshakable sense that something was missing.

I finally reached the top of the staircase, my hand softly landing on the railing as I moved to put the clock in my pocket.

“Okay, one last time, you fuck.” A voice suddenly spoke, “You better fucking thank me.”

A pale hand suddenly snatched the windup clock from my grasp like some kind of ninja. I whirled around only to come face to face with Haze Borden. My cheeks flushed red immediately, confusion splitting across my face.

Her hair was tied back, glimmering earnings dangling softly by her pale neck. She seemed strangely comfortable in her pink dress, the design some weird mix of skimpy and business formal that almost made it appear like she was getting ready for an awkward high school prom.

“I get it, you’re attracted to me,” She hissed, “Stop being a
blabbering idiot. You’d think after these years of the literally the same exact shit over and over you’d learn to make a fucking move, you limp dick piece of shit.”

She kissed me with an action that felt more like a slap. My heart stopped dead, convinced reality had just broke as my hands splayed out.

“Don’t think about that too hard,” she followed up with a snap, “I get that moved fast for you, not like I give a shit. As much as I enjoy this conversation and variations of it, I wanted to try something else with you. Again, it may seem strange, but it might be helpful.”

“Uhh . . . wait, Mrs. Borden,” I tensed, unable to keep myself from backing up as she approached way too close for comfort, “This is some kind of setup, right!? What the actual fuck is-”

“You have my pen,” she spoke softly, pointing to where a pant pocket may have been on her dress.

My eyebrows cocked, my hand moving to mirror her movement and check my pant pocket. I reached inside with growing confusion to produce a small black ink ballpoint pen.

“You’ll rot here,” She whispered softly as she grabbed it from me, tone shifting to something completely out of nowhere, “If you forget everything, remember this. You can be conscious without breaking it.”

Her forehead clacked against mine as she looked down and grabbed my hand. Her pen rapidly scratched across the back of my palm, writing directly over “Goodbye”

“I Must Escape”

The ink was scrawled and hasty, yet clearly legible.

Suddenly, she twisted my wrist back on itself before slamming it against the wall with a hard crack.

I flinched and nearly yelped, horrified confusion invading my face. She finally let go and I wrenched my hand away.

'What the hell was that?! Such a weird thing to do out of nowhere!'

Her face slowly knitted in flushed embarrassment as she quickly did an awkward dance move as if forced to do so by an invisible hand controlling puppet strings.

She wiggled her hands like someone who had never even attempted to find rhythm in their life, the entire routine frighteningly bad.

'This wasn’t her character, what the hell was happening? Where had I seen this before?'

After spinning around with a horrid lack of grace, she finally caught her breath and gave a thumbs up to mask her cherry red face.

“Do you remember yesterday?” she finally spoke as if nothing had just happened, standing upright and recapping her pen. She gazed at me curiously, continuing, “How’s your arm?”

“Yest- . . . what the heck was that?” I certainly wasn’t in any danger of laughing, my only reaction confusion and concern, “What the heck did you just do?!”

'I was definitely having some sort of psychotic episode. Was I still dreaming?!'

“Come on,” Haze responded, face slowly giving way to despair, “Not after all that . . .”

“Yesterday . . .” I tried to humor her in my concern, “I mean, yes? I remember meeting you and doing some things around the manor . . . what was that about my arm? Aside from the fact you just slammed it against a wall . . .”

“John, PLEASE,” she looked like she was about to break, “I came back for you. Even after I promised I wouldn’t. You have to give me this.”

Something in the distance howled. Haze extended her arm to offer the pen to me, holding her ground as her grip tightened in fear.

I stared at the ball point pen, a prickling sensation itching at the back of my eyes.

The lights above flickered.

“How . . . how did I have that before?” I staggered, “I- . . . Are you sure that’s your pen? How was that in my pocket already?”

“Oh, alright,” she nodded solemnly, “Listen, John, I’m sorry about that, I like to mess with people sometimes. I don’t get many chances to let out weirdness, can you hold on to this pen?”

She extended her arm to offer it to me.

I stared at the ball point pen, a prickling sensation itching at the back of my eyes.

The lights above flickered.

“You . . . Already offered me . . .” I staggered, “I- . . . Are you sure that’s your pen? How was that in my pocket already?”

“Oh, alright,” she nodded solemnly, “Listen, John, I’m sorry about that, I like to mess with people sometimes. I don’t get many chances to let out weirdness, can you hold on to this pen?”

She extended her arm to offer it to me.

“You . . . gave that to me yesterday . . .” I staggered, “I- . . . Are you sure that’s your pen? How was that . . . you already did this.”

We already did all of this.

A spark of orange left a bulb overhead to split to blackness.
Everything went dark. Silence reigned for what felt like an eternity before a hideous sound cut through the darkness like shattering bone.

The room fluttered, blood speckling my shoe before I glanced to my arm in horror. A ghastly wound had spread up my arm as if punctured by a great white shark. Blood dripped down to my shoe just like before.

'. . . Before? How many times had this happened?'

“Just yesterday!” A faint voice shuttered in the distance, Haze’s silhouette shakily warping, looking wrong in my peripherals as dark liquid spread through the air like water, “Focus on yesterday, don’t attract attention!”

My eyes finally jittered to look at her, widening in panic as I saw scars forming across her collar bone and throat like a necklace of razor teeth.

The wound looked just like mine.

Her pale flesh was quickly swamped by red, an image that slowly blurred to nothing as I closed my eyes and flinched away. Her corpse collapsed to the floor. Blood thundered through the air around me like a swarm of drowning insects.

“Yesterday . . .” I tried to block out the noise and searing visuals, refraining from looking at anything or anyone.

The dead light overhead inexplicably stuttered back to life like a fake candle. Scuttling resounded as if just out of view, rotten fingers peeling back floorboards.

“We . . . I talked to you yesterday,” I spoke aloud almost to check if I could still hear myself through the overpowering hysteria, “. . . about this. About this clock. But you said you
wanted to fix it, something about it was paranormal. We talked in your room, we . . .”

My mind flashed back to the drawing on her hand, my heart shuttering wildly against my ribs.

""A dragon eating a lion.'

A jagged, painful memory played through foggy vision, Haze grinning softly as I drew a Jellyfish on her hand. Then a mongoose, then a pelican, then flashes of hundreds . . .upon hundreds of animals. Her appearance didn’t change each time, except to slowly decay further as if a decomposing corpse, the room around us falling into deterioration as if rotting flesh itself.

Bai’s death penalty was upheld, confirmed by China’s top court, and carried out this morning in Tianjin.  
  
Bai accepted over $156 million in bribes while approving shady financing deals and inflated project acquisitions between 2014 and 2018.   
  
As head of a major state-run asset firm, he funneled public money into private pockets in exchange for payouts.   
  
The court said his actions caused “exceptionally significant losses” to both the state and the public.  
  
In most countries, a guy like Bai would be sipping coffee in a cushy white-collar prison or negotiating a book deal.   
  
In China, he meets with his family, then he’s executed.  
  
Bai’s former boss, Lai Xiaomin, was also executed in 2021 for taking even more - $253 million.  
  
This is all part of Xi Jinping’s years-long crackdown on corruption in finance.   
  
Big names keep falling: the ex-chair of the Bank of China got a death sentence with reprieve, and the former head of Everbright Group is doing 15 years.  
  
In China’s financial sector, it’s not just about falling from grace. It’s about falling fast, hard, and for good.

1piq5x4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1piq5x4/what_would_be_the_right_medical_term_for_this/,What would be the right medical term for this stomach feeling? And what can I try for it?,"I am US-based 50, F, in okay health, normal weight, post-menopause, everything is good, retired Professor, kids grown, etc. but have a very weird stomach or GI feeling for a few months and can't figure out 1.) what to call it or 2.) how to calm it down. I will explain the feeling in a moment, but first:

History: I did have my gallbladder removed in 1999, no symptoms at all at the time, it was noticed I had cholesterol stones during pregnancy during an unrelated ultrasound, and do have some occasional problems still so I eat very well normally, avoiding fats, but I do get episodic extreme pain after eating with diarrhea. I take digestive enzymes and try to not skip meals. 

I don't know if it's related. It doesn't really feel like that. 

The only other thing I can think of to mention is that I travel a lot but don't recall having food poisoning.

Symptoms: for a few months, I have a constantly weird, bad feeling in my stomach and intestines. It feels like they are churning and I am about to vomit but am not nauseated. I feel weak, shaky, and a few times I have vomited. It also makes me feel jittery, as if I were very anxious -- like when you have stage fright and your stomach is bottoming out -- except I am not anxious at all. I am having a lot of diarrhea but not the sudden kind like with my post-gallbladder issue where I ate too much fat or fiber, but just like I am going to the bathroom 15 times a day and then I still have a bad stomach after that. It could be my intestines rather than my stomach. I can't tell. But it's also making me weak feeling and like lying in bed. 

What I have tried: I already go to therapy, I already meditate, I already watch my diet. I have also tried fasting, eating really plain things like boiled carrots and oatmeal for days, walking, deep breathing, hot water bottle ony stomach, massaging my stomach and intestines (they feel somewhat sore), Pepto-bismol, hot tea, no coffee or tea, no fats, all kinds of dietary restrictions, Tums, beta blockers, Valium, caraway seeds, and loperimide. I think that's everything.

I have an appointment with my primary care doctor but not until February. I would like to explain what the thing I am feeling is (I would think it has a name? Upset stomach, but with a sense of jittery weakness plus diarrhea and I want to vomit but am not queasy, but it's incredibly impossible to ignore and feels like waves and waves all day). I would also like to know what I might try OTC if I am overlooking anything.

My medical care is not especially good and I have noticed my doctors think everything is anxiety, perhaps due to my age and gender, so I would like to be as clear as possible when I go in. Until then, I would like to just cope and will try basically anything. Also my insurance requires a referral which will take another many months. Meanwhile I feel like staying in bed, near the toilet, and weird sort of butterflies in my stomach (you can feel churning if you put your hand on my stomach or abdonen too... it's gurgly).

**The Premise**

Capacities aims to help us externalize the way our brains naturally process information and apply the same heuristic process to our note taking.

This is addressed in the official getting started video when the host explains why the app is built around Objects rather than ""files"" like most other note taking apps are.

This is a brilliant take on things because we hold information in our minds clustered as attributes of a defined entity (object).

Capacities brilliantly lets us define the attributes of the entity that matter to our cognitive process and put them front and center.

It also brilliantly addresses the ""web of knowledge"" metaphor through the graph visualization and the links that can exist between objects.

It's an absolutely beautiful aesthetic implemented in an incredibly user friendly way, given the complexity of the taxonomy in terms of human cognition.

**The Issue**

The problem with this taxonomy is that what matters in the cognitive process, in learning, in practical knowledge, is not *just* the objects, not the objects *plus* the relationship between them, but the entire ***knowledge domain*** (*semantic sub-domain)*.

We juggle multiple knowledge domains which we ""register"" in our minds through the *object-like entities* Capacities uses so elegantly, but a practical knowledge domain is made up of a variety of objects -- notes, tweets, files, images, ideas, all interconnected, not simply through backlinks and a visualization, but as a conceptual category.  
  
When someone works with multiple overlapping knowledge domains which effectively stack and compliment one another, it becomes very difficult to filter and sort this information using an object-based approach.

Indeed, my own Space is filled with images of memes, car parts, pictures of places I've been, napkins with notes on them, etc. Same for my ""Pages"" object type, or my ""Files""... they become an unsightly mess within a matter of days.

**Why Tags don't work**

To use Tags to cluster objects into knowledge domains *might* work, but it would almost be reducing them vulgar folders which no one wants.

Tags should be reserved for a very specific type of filtering: they should be used for the purpose of connecting objects which have *some* useful conceptual relationship but are not connected in a relevant way. For example, ""blueprints"" or ""assembly diagrams"" would be valid Tags which would allow you to quickly find images of a certain nature without remembering specifics of the attributes we put in.

Now you may say that for this, we shouldn't use Tags but rather *collection*s and you'd ALMOST be right.

We could use collections, but collections are nested within an object, so it's impossible to have a domain knowledge, for example ""Coffee machines"" as a collection which contains instruction manuals as files, diagrams as images, various notes, etc, so back to tags it is.

The issue, however, is when you have important knowledge *sub-domains* and even worse, when several overlap.

Imagine you're a corporate lawyer who collects notes not only on legal matters, but also on matters of human psychology and on economics.

For each one of these three topics, you might (like I do with my professional knowledge stack) have multiple sub-domains such as ""Books"" ""Diagrams"" ""Other people's posts that made me think"" ""Draft publications"" ""Ideas"" ""Concepts I'm working on""... Imagine the amount of tags you'd have to juggle to correctly categorize a professional-grade taxonomy.

Now imagine how much worse it is, when I have to add ""Tags"" to each ""Page"" to explain that it simultaneously belongs in the category of draft publications, and law, and my own specific law practice, and behavioral psychology and is affected by economic principles.

Since tags cannot be nested, this burden quickly becomes very, very heavy for the humble tag to bear.

This is further aggravated by the fact that the tag management UI is considerably less optimized and attractive than object type management UI, which is so sleek that it almost borders on being a generative work of art.

**The simple fix**

One simple fix might resolve this: move collections out from *under* objects and place them outside objects.

Collections can already be nested within one another but can still operate loosely.

A ""Page"" can belong to multiple collections and completely resolve the issue I've outlined above in basically the *perfect* way -- except for the fact that collections being bound to object types, it is impossible for me to use them as *knowledge domain* labels that would encompass multiple object types.

If Collections were moved up hierarchically and Tags were allowed to *augment* the data classification for filtering purposes, instead of playing defacto folder substitutes, the entire taxonomy and ontology model of the application would map almost perfectly to how the minds of high-performing professionals work without sacrificing absolutely any workflow that currently exists.

If someone is worried about Collections being ""too broad"", then it should be possible programmatically to define what can be inside a collection based on where it is created (nested or root level). It should even be possible to make this a configurable attribute of the collection, where the user can specify where the collection should ""appear"" visually for navigation purposes, and what ""objects"" are allowed within it.

The one last bit that would have to be added to truly make Capacities ""god tier"" would be to drastically enhance the ""views"" of the ""Tags"" and ""Collections"" so that they are richer with information and more visually appealing, just like the object-based views are.

I sincerely hope that this post helps the developers take Capacities to the next level, because they have done astounding work, and I genuinely believe my suggestion aligns with their vision and mission in the best possible way.",6,1765331604.0,capacitiesapp,3,0.87,False

1. Durability while being neglected. For example, if I leave a coffee or wine stain on it for a week, which will be harder to remove later (black granite vs white artificial marble)? How about oil stains?
2. Longevity. I know granite can last 30 years while looking still new because I had granite countertops before. But can recent engineered stone tops last 30 years without yellowing or getting sunburns?

Other than that, I see that the synthetic marble is not scratch resistant at all, but I expect if can be easily re-polished every 10 years or so, right?

Here’s a **raw, vivid, cinematic 500-word story** — intense, emotional, and gripping:

---

## **🔥 *“The Deal That Wasn’t Mine” — A 500-Word Story***

The alarm went off at 5:17 AM—three minutes before I actually needed to wake up. I didn’t hit snooze. I never do. Not in this industry. Not in this city. Dubai doesn’t wait for anyone, and the market sure as hell doesn’t either.

I sat on the edge of my bed for a second, letting the silence settle. My eyes were open, but my mind was already running—calculating, rewinding, replaying yesterday like a highlight reel I didn’t ask for. The calls. The viewings. The clients. And the two deals I **should’ve closed**, but someone else snatched right from under me while I was out grinding.

Coffee didn’t taste like coffee this morning—it tasted like bitterness. Like the kind you can’t add sugar to.

By 6:00 AM, I was in my car, staring at the skyline that looks like ambition carved out of steel. Everyone loves the glamour of real estate—the cars, the suits, the views from penthouses. No one talks about the parts that leave your jaw clenched all day. The competition. The fake smiles. The sudden “Sorry, we went with another broker” texts that feel like punches in the ribs.

I drove to my first meeting. Another client who said they were “just browsing.” Browsing is code for “I’ll call your competitor after you leave.” Still, I gave it everything. Not because I wanted to… but because this game forces you to.

By noon, the heat was swallowing the city. Sweat on my back, dust on my shoes, phone ringing nonstop. My friends think being a broker means you sit in offices and negotiate deals. No. You *hunt*. You chase leads that vanish. You chase clients who lie. You chase your own sanity half the time.

And the worst part? You can do everything right and still lose. Just like I did yesterday.
Two deals. Two.
Weeks of effort.
Gone behind my back.

But the thing people never understand about me is this: I don’t break. I sharpen.

In the afternoon, I stood on a balcony overlooking the marina, fake-smiling for a client who kept changing their mind every two minutes. Inside, I wanted to scream. Outside, I stayed calm. Because the city respects composure more than anything.

As the sun started to sink behind the towers, turning the sky into this deep orange that looked almost violent, something shifted in me. Not anger. Not defeat. Something colder. Something clearer.

I realized that the deals I lost weren’t signs of failure—they were signs that I was getting close. Too close. Close enough for people to start cutting corners to beat me.

That means I’m a threat.
And threats rise.

By the time I drove home, I wasn’t thinking about what I lost anymore. I was thinking about what comes next. Dubai doesn’t reward the soft. It rewards the relentless.

And tomorrow at 5:17 AM, when my alarm rings too early again…
I’ll still be awake—
because I’m not done yet.

The replacement for OG severed lime! The secret to the InFizz is the cap that allows slow release. It can carbonate anything without spewing over thanks to the special carbonating cap that offers a slow release option. Everything else would make a mess with agave and the lime crystals. Guys, not that you want to, but you can carbonate anything. Juice, milk(gross), and even coffee. But I’m just in it for the water. The lime and lemon are good, gonna try the orange and grapefruit too.

Fill the bottle to min line
Add desired agave, for me I just eyeball it, but maybe 1-1.5tsp.
1 packet of citrus crystals
3 1-second CO2 pumps
Slow release (middle option)

It's been a bit tough meeting new people recently, and I'd love to connect with someone genuine.

I'm currently looking for one of two things or hopefully both:

1. A New Friend: Someone to grab coffee with, explore a different neighborhood, check out a festival, or just chat about life, movies, or maybe play some board games. I'm generally pretty easygoing and open to trying new things.

2. A Cuddle Buddy: For those nights when you just need some cozy, platonic, low-pressure physical affection. No strings attached, just comfort and good vibes.

If you're interested:
Please send me a DM and tell me a little bit about yourself, which of the two connection types you're looking for, and what your favorite thing about Toronto is!

Looking forward to connecting! 👋

1pipxqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/hondashadow/comments/1pipxqr/honda_shadow_stuck_on_a_trailer/,Honda Shadow - Stuck on a Trailer,"Hey there! I had just picked up my first bike (a 97 Honda Shadow Spirit vt1100) and after many hours of driving to go get it (dead bat, had been sitting, tanks clean af) I take a small break, then work on the dismount.

After unstrapping the bike and rolling it back, I realized that I had forgotten to put the kick stand up -- but I pulled another mistake on top of that. The trailer has ""grooves"" and while rolling back I felt the front wheel ""slip"" over one of them -- nudging the front wheel to a slight angle as I was backing up (altering trajectory) and causing a peg to slip over the side as I was moving back (rapidly becoming familiar with the rear brake in the process).

I've got to return the truck + trailer tomorrow and I'd rather not muck her up before I even try to derust anything.

I just don't have anyone available at current to help me get the bike moved forward to get her rear end off the trailer's ramp, so I figured I'd shoot for crazy. Current crazy notion is ""WD40 + Sledge vs Peg"" in a very dramatic fashion. Sorry for the poopy image. Its cold af out there.

tl;dr: I have a highway peg stuck on the side of the trailer and the kickstand on the other. I put some straps in place just to keep her from slipping off if that peg comes free but..yeah..looking for ideas no matter how farfetched. This is why I need infinite coffee.

We woke up early, eyes straining at the rising sun casting its’ glare into our room. I made us coffee while Steph made her famous egg and sausage brekky as we prepared for the day ahead of us. We felt we had a moral obligation to help search for Stephen, since we had attended the same high school together and shared mutual friends such as Lachlan and Mat, who organised the meeting we had with SES. Mathew Sullivan, or “Sully” as Lachie liked to call him, was a dropout who chose small gigs and volunteering in order to stay on benefits. I never interacted with him as much as Lachlan, but from what I could tell, him and Stephen were close. That day, he had looked like he barely slept, with dark eyebags seared onto his unshaven face. We donned bright, orange, high-vis apparel as we searched the southside mountains of our little coastal town. Driving onto the old road that connected the mountains together before searching with an operator on foot. It was to our surprise that Sally joined as well, hopping out of Lachlan’s dark Camry also dressed in uniform.

“Oh- hey- I wasn’t expecting you to be up here today too. I hope you’re doing alright” I said.

“What’s it matter to you?” she snarled. Her dark eyes piercing me as her glare focused on me to a fault.

“C’mon, can you girls not do this today? Please?” Mat said dejectedly. His voiced was flat and monotone as his hair drooped over his eyes. Steph whispered into my ear once the operator caught Sally’s, Mat’s and Lachie’s attention.

“Best to leave her be.”

The SES operator gave us a rundown on how the search would go, we were expected to join other volunteers near the bottom of the mountain, since we had driven to near the top of the mountains. Lachlan asked if he could go back up the mountain since he took his car, offering us a ride if we wished to stay a bit longer. He cited that if we split up, we could cover more ground. Though another reason was so that Sally and I would be separated throughout the ordeal. While the operator did not approve of this request, he did not deny us either. As long as some of us were at the base of the mountain as the sun started to set, we could have free reign as long as we let him know that we were safe and off the mountain by nightfall.

We got grouped together randomly, with Sally, Lachlan and the Operator going down one path, with Mat, Steph and I heading down another. Mat held a small radio in case we found anything, The path we took was relatively steep, with us slipping a few times on loose stones and woody debris. Those tall, familiar trees instilling a strange, indecipherable feeling that made my hairs stand on end.

“We haven’t been on these mountains in ages.” I said.

“Yeah, not since we were kids, your leg doing alright Claire?” asked Steph, who was using a thick branch to help her descend the mountain.

“Yeah, it’s doing okay. Surely there’s no holes here-“

“Holes? What holes?” Mat asked curiously.

“Oh, the holes on the mountains, we fell into one when we were younger, ended up breaking my leg, I thought we told you?”

“Yeah nah, I’d remember something like that. Did you guys fall in one around here? We should look there in case Stephen had something similar happen-“

“Claire, are you okay?”

\-

I felt those memories flooding back to me. Of the old mines scattered across the mountains. They are isolated deep in the mountains for the most part, with many trees and rusted fences concealing them. For one reason or another, those mines were abandoned, at least presumably so. Though remnants of them still exist today, we were unfortunate enough to find one for ourselves.

“Hey, have you ever been over there?” Steph asked one morning. She pointed to Cardy Reserve, situated between and separating Mount Presley and Mount Osborne.

“Uh, I don’t think so? Mum doesn’t let me go out that far usually.”

“Why don’t we go explore it!”

I protested a bit, but it was hard to not be curious and share her excitement. She had always been the more adventurous type. It seemed like nothing could stop her. I eventually gave in and we headed first to her house for supplies. Where I waited outside, before we both headed back to my mother’s home. Located roughly seven kilometres away from hers, it stood at the cap of a small hill looking out to the sea, with a small garden that we used to play in. She warned me not to go up the mountain, but I could only imagine it had something to do with what my father did up there. Since he worked on a project up there many years ago.

“Mum, what exactly did Dad do in the mountains?”

She was sitting in her armchair, her brunette hair and dull baby blue clothes still exuded that warm, maternal love that soothed me. Yet her eyes closed and her face almost winced in pain. A small tear could be seen shining under the yellow tinted lights of a nearby lamp as she took a deep breath.

“He was a consultant dear; he would check to make sure everything went according to plan…” Her voice trailed off, I can remember seeing her stare off into the void as her next words came quietly from her lips.

“But something happened, they said it was a leak, something in the air. Something they couldn’t see… It caused him to… to deteriorate- the way he did.” Tears gently hit the floor as repressed memories flooded forth.

“I’m sorry Mum, I wanted to know more about him and-“

“No- no it’s alright-“ She wiped her eyes underneath her glasses as she leaned in close. She took a sip from her favourite porcelain cup, the soft embers from the wood fire heater revealed a number of small wrinkles on her cheeks and eyes.

“He was very talented, and it hurts me to think that they didn’t tell him what would be down there…”

Steph grew uncomfortable on the topic of my Dad. I wanted to steer the conversation into a different direction, figuring we could reminisce on the few positive memories we had of him together. Although the man she knew was long gone, his impact and absence still weighs heavy on us. So, I asked her about him, what he liked, what he did when he was younger. Each question I asked left a bittersweet smile on her. Eventually we looked through old pictures of us when we were younger, telling us of how they met at a seaside café, of my baptism and how I would annoy them with the pool safety slogan every time the ad come on the old box television.

*“Fence the Pool, Shut the Gate, Supervise, Watch your Mate, and Learn how to Resuscitate.”*

“Can we go up to the Cardy Reserve, Mrs Wilson?” Steph asked, she looked down at the ground with her hands behind her back. She gave my mother the biggest puppy dog eyes I had ever seen. She was clever, and her pleading would grow only stronger and more effective with age.

“Mm, alright, but you both stay within the reserve and turn back at the trails’ end. Be careful of snakes and spiders, it’s best to stay-”

“Yes Mum, and we’ll be back before nightfall.” I added, as I knew it would be the first thing she asked.

“Mm, You two be careful out there alright? If anything happens, call me okay?” She hugged me tightly, and we set off shortly afterwards. Full of joy and optimism as we voyaged out into the unknown. Our excitement quickened our pace and we quickly found ourselves running on the sidewalk. The sun hanging high in the sky as it beamed strong heat upon us. With Steph’s bag rattling with each enthusiastic step.

The Cardy Reserve held a large number of coastal Wattle and Banksia species, plus a few non-native flower species. The numerous entrances were guarded in fleshy stems and flowers running above the dirt paths, providing edible yet bitter leaves. Deeper inside was a walking track that looped around, providing a number of unique flowers that varied wildly in colour, shape and size. Until returning to the wide expanse of the sprawling town and coastal estuaries.

“Hey! Look at that one!” Steph pointed to a small shrub, covered in thin, round leaves and tiny, purple flowers.

“I think this one is a pea bush!” She picked at one of the flowers and held it up for me to see. It had irregular petals and a large keel that vaguely resembled origami. Her attention on the purple flowers diminished as small, red, bell-shaped flowers caught her eye.

“Honey suckles!” she picked up one of the non-native flowers, and without hesitation, started suckling at the stem. Many brightly coloured butterflies could be seen landing and feeding from the flowers as I tried one for myself. The stem was sweet and hollow, leaving enough room for a drop of honey-like nectar.

“Mm, the nectar is safe to eat, but the berries aren’t.”

“How do you know all this?” I asked, but before I could answer, she was pulling out a large botany book from her bag. The cover showed many types of flowers and plants; in a professional font it read *‘Flora of Coastal New South Wales.’*

Despite being forbidden from the mountains, we would often sneak up to Mount Osborne for a little bit, only traversing the foot of the mountain. Trees were sparse and large areas was covered in rocky outcrops. Mount Presley was much shorter, but it provided us more opportunity to hang out after school and on the weekends. Until that day, when we ventured all the way up Mount Osborne. Ignoring the warnings dotted around the many decaying fences. As we had found a gap between the wire and the posts.

Our trek up the hiking trail proved as exciting as it was exhausting. The path was made of dirt with roots running along the trail, forming natural steps up the mountain. Twigs and leaves littering the forest floor as patches of clearing would sprout up occasionally allowing us to sit and rest. A large steel pylon reclaimed by foliage marked the near entrance.

“Hey Claire! Check this out!” She pulled from her bag a large dive torch. It had a dark wrist strap and three large bulbs protected by a thick layer of glass. As she turned it on, the intensity of light blinded me for a short duration.

“Ow! That’s really bright!”

“Sorry! Sorry! You like it though yeah? I borrowed it from my brother.”

I rubbed at my eyes, still seeing spots linger with each blink.

“Does he swim with it?”

“Sometimes, he takes it when he swims at night. It just sits on his table. It’s really heavy, feel it!”

She handed it to me, I put out one hand and quickly used the other to hold it up. It must have been five or six kilograms.

“Wouldn’t he sink if he carried this?”

“His jacket keeps him up, you should have a look, he presses a button and it blows up!”

“Woah, can it pop?”

“Maybe, I don’t think he wants that though, he keeps saying it cost a lot when I touch it.”

We would walk and talk about her brother, the topic drifting from school bullies like Sally to new songs that we would hear on the radio. Our trail lead us in circles, and during our second rotation, we spotted another path up ahead, leading between large moss-covered boulders into a thick, forested area. 

We would eat the small wild strawberries that dotted the trail concealed by bushes and shrubs. The faint calls of Black Cockatoos could be heard in the distance and seen flying from tree to tree as we ducked under branches. Further up was a small, concrete structure with a rusted metal door and bars standing stoically in a small clearing.

“Go on, take a look”

“Nuh uh! You should!”

“I can hold your hand if you’re afraid.” She cooed teasingly.

 I would move cautiously expecting for someone, or something, to jump out at me. Instead, there was only the sound of Green Katydids and distant Kookaburras as I got closer.

\-

\-

\-

“BOO!”

“AHH! Don’t do that.” I instinctively smacked her hand away that she used to grab my shoulder, giving way to an onslaught of giddy, belly laughter. The birds that were perching in the trees would fly away from the commotion.

“You should’ve seen your face. So scared\~” I scoffed at her, which caused her giggle more.

 Looking down revealed stairs that have collapsed with rock and age. The lock was strong as it was rusted. The metal steps leading down have crumbled under the weight of rocks above it as a cool waft could be felt drawing beneath our feet into the hole. Steph brought out the dive torch and shined it down, casting the bright light on the many boulders that blocked the stairway.

“How deep do you think it goes?”

“As deep as those rocks I’m guessing.” I replied, before feeling Steph wrapping her hand around mine..

“Huh?” I looked at her, taken aback. She looked at me for a moment then sheepishly looked up at the trees. I sighed as I let go, as I grabbed a heavy stick that laid near the path. Using it to strum at the rusted bars, as orange flakes fell like feathers onto our feet. Before dropping it outside as we moved further up.

The day seemed to pass so quickly, as the sun that once hung high in the sky now beaming from just above the clearing. The shadows beginning to grow as the golden flecks of dusk grew weaker with the setting sun. The weeds and bushes tugged at our clothes, almost attempting to preserve our innocence from what laid ahead. We played and chased each other amongst the bushes, until Steph disappeared from view…

“Steph?! Where are you?!” I looked around, now alone. I could feel my heart racing as I looked up and down the path, I was about to walk back before a voice cut through the sudden silence.

“Claire! Don’t move!” Her voice came from beneath me, but before I could even respond, it was too late. I heard a loud thud, so I assumed she must have tripped on a loose root or a small boulder. It wasn't until I heard her muffled cries from below that the ground crumbled beneath my feet. Causing me to tumble down into a dark, rocky hole. I hit my leg bad on the way down, a loud, wet crack echoing around us before my body made full contact with the ground. I came to feeling searing hot pain, causing my head to throb while Steph looked down at me in horror. My leg felt wet, sticky and hot, I traced my hand down my thigh to my shin, feeling something sharp sticking out. In the dim light, I could vaguely make out my tibia sticking out of my shin, bright flesh and yellow fat hanging loosely from the open wound. Nurses later confirmed that I had suffered a compound fracture. I still have the scar and limp to prove it.

The concealed entrance we fell down from was too steep to climb up. Trying resulted in scratches and cuts, and the foliage that covered the entrance was ill equipped to support our weight. We would patch ourselves up with the band-aids we were given, and wash some of the dirt off with a few drops of water. But even back then, we knew that our injuries required medical attention.

“Call your mum!” Steph cried. I looked over at her. Her leg was bruised and cut, as mine bent unnaturally as tears ran down her cheeks. The sunlight above us made the surrounding moist rock walls a hellish shade of red, almost every surface around us was covered in a thin layer of biofilm, slimy and foul smelling. Steph helped me up, despite being in a much better condition than I was, still had visible cuts and bruises covering her. The panic was setting in, and I managed to drag myself to my feet, draping myself over Steph's shoulder as we hobbled in the dark. Steph's phone was snapped in half on the way down, mine was shattered, though still working. We attempted to call 000, but there was no signal down there in the dark. We could only hope they roughly knew where we were based on our attempts to contact them. She nervously brought out the heavy dive torch, which was still turned on from earlier. The light growing dimmer from overuse as it ignited the ceiling in a fragile light.

“No! I forgot to turn it off properly! I can’t believe…” She sobbed meekly. “I can’t believe.. I was so stupid-“

“No! you aren’t. You didn’t know, I didn’t either-“ I took a deep breath, trying to calm myself, the searing pain in my leg making me feel nauseous. I continued quietly-

“You should save the torch Stephanie… We don’t know how long we’ll be in here for.”

“Okay…” She sniffled as she wiped her face with the cleanest part of her arm.

 

 

The little confidence she had when she pulled the light from her bag quickly faded as she packed it back inside. I turned my flip phone around to barely illuminate the cold tunnel in a green hue. Faint dripping could be heard from the moistened surfaces. A few small poles sat in the middle of the chambered, each wrapped in thin, worn strands of black and yellow striped tape. The roof of the outer cave was illuminated by thin slivers of the setting sun that slid between the canopy above us. Evidence of human activity remained on the hard and rough stone floor. Stephanie stuck close to me, her breathing slowing as we moved closer and through the passageway. Man made foundations and railings in combination with chicken wire netting draped over portions of the walls. There were markings leading down deeper, with a steel railing descending into the darkness.

None of us spoke a word, as we stayed silent while we continued our descent. Supporting her with my shoulder as we delved down into the darkness. The frail light from the flip phone would reveal the end of the railing. Ceasing at a foreboding door that was worn with age. From above the door a dark fluid would drip down, forming a puddle below as it stained the coat from an aged white to a muddy brown colour. On the other side of the door, a choice was to be made. On our right side, there was a gravel pile leading up into a narrow burrow that seemingly lead to the surface. In front of us slightly left, was a fenced off mine with a barred gate. The fence had an old white sign that read-

“*Danger, Risk Area. This section has been closed and may be unstable. Do not go beyond this point*.”

Written over was a message in black marker. It looked to be written haphazardly, barely legible in a style of writing I could not begin to interpret. The phrase was accompanied by a symbol. A large eye, in the shape of a diamond. Drawn with thick lines on each side, and down the middle. Sharp edges on each corner. With lines radiating from it like a star. Below thick, wavy lines on top of it. As we shone lights through the fence, we noticed strange marks covering all the walls. We peered through the wire mesh and saw the same indescribable writing in small scribbles covering every centimetre of the blocked tunnel. Accompanied by their own sets of strange, cascading symbols.

 

“C’mon Steph, let’s get out of here…” I checked my phone; the battery was still high but there was no reception this far down. I didn’t want to call her, even if I could. Not just yet. I still thought there was a chance where I could help Steph get home first. We were reckless. The faint sounds of running water, rocks falling and shattering on the cave floor echoed from beyond the gated area. Stephanie rummaged in her back and brought out her dive light again and shone it down into the fenced area.

The area lit up, further down was a series of tunnels leading further down into the earth. Large stalactites, stalagmites and columns dotted the large, hollowed area with remnants of mining equipment littering the numerous entrances. One of which had a stream of water running down into one of the dark tunnels. Faint scribblings were etched into some of the cool, moist walls. Leading further down until smothered by shadow. We stopped when we heard the wet, sloppy sounds of sodden steps. Staggering from deep inside the stygian tunnels. Just as we were listening, a loud crack could be heard above. A large piece of rock had slipped out of the overhead netting, which caused us both to shriek in unison. We quickly darted together to the gravel that lead into an extremely tight crawlspace. The jagged edges of rock scratching us as we wormed our way through.

It felt like we would never get out, as if the earth itself attempted to swallow us whole and refused to spit us out. We used rocks to dig out soft dirt to provide support as we climbed. Speeding up in tandem, using our small, dirty hands to rip away at the overgrowth that covered our exit. I made it to the surface, but she was still down there. Steph was at an awkward angle, Her hand so close to the surface. She jumped and I gripped her hand as the sound of bloody bone popped and echoed in the hole. I fell instantly as tears and snot ran down my face. I screamed and screamed until I vomited on the damp grass.

The rest was merely a blur, where I can only remember fragments of our painful trek down the mountain. The sun was slipping away further as night slowly but steadily approached. The air around us cooled quickly as the fragments of daylight showed how dirty we both were. Covered head to toe in small cuts, hands almost black, hair frayed and frizzy. Stephanie was breathing rapidly as I tried to aid her the best I could. Stephanie looked at me with a gaped mouth, both in pain and shock. I pulled out my phone and dialled the landline. I really did not want to, but it was the right decision.

Holding onto her as we made our way down the mountain. Any noticeable landmarks on the way up has since disappeared in the dark of night. Stephanie’s torch lit up the path ahead as we made our way through a vague trail that we had hoped lead to the familiar dirt paths.

We made it through the clearing of the trees, quickly running down as fast as we could. Our shoes sliding on the dirt with us falling over a few times. We passed the concrete structure, then the pylon. We could rest a little as we knew we were on the home stretch. Making our way around the structure, the light from Stephanies torch began to flicker and lose strength. We slowed down and came to the rusted entrance, still locked and bound as it were before. We passed through the moss-covered boulders and thin trail. With my mother’s headlights illuminating the small parking bay at the trails entrance. She stood near her white Pickup with a worried, angry look, her gaze on her phone before looking up to see both of us come down the mountain as her eyes widened. She reached out for a hug that I quickly reciprocated. I was taken to the hospital shortly after, where I stayed for almost a week as my leg was operated on. Every time I was put under, I dreamt of being in those caves and tunnels once more, swimming through as they flooded, leaving me with small air pockets to gasp for breath.

I felt shapes swimming quickly around me, only able to catch them in my peripheral vision. Long, thick shapes that darted above and below, side to side. Circling me from every conceivable angle as vulnerability struck me from every direction. I saw a soft hue that strengthened into a dull glow, as it revealed dark cyclopean monoliths and crystalline peaks that spread throughout the stoney passageways and tunnels. Below me I felt a great presence, yet I could not describe what it was. It felt huge, pulsing, at first I thought it was my heartbeat. But the thrums and vibrations ran violently around me. It was guttural, shaking my body from the inside out. I felt my chest being pushed around and my body trembling at the tremors. I would awake every time with my heartrate monitor beeping like crazy, until they gave me anesthetic and attempted surgery while I was conscious.

\-

We had made it to the bottom of the mountain, with no signs of Stephen Preston anywhere to be seen. Mat wanted to stay and search longer, but both Lachlan and the SES operator convinced him to go home, promising that they would go for an unofficial search another day. From the corner of my eye, I spotted Sally walking down a dirt path leading to the road, still wearing her high-vis vest.

“Hey, do you guys want a lift back?” he offered.

“Isn’t your car back at the top of the mountain?” I replied.

“Well- yeah, but it won’t take me long to get back and drive down.” He said rather quietly, he seemed shaken, but I didn’t question it. I figured he just didn’t want to go back up the mountain alone. Despite our home being closer, and our walk there taking less time. We agreed to head up with Lachlan back up the mountain. By the time we reached our apartment, our feet were red raw, skin tough and aching as we shared a hot bath together.

“Hey, how’s the weather looking for tomorrow?” I asked Steph, as I helped her shave while she reached for her phone from near the sink.

“It looks hot, 41 and almost no wind. Perfect for a dive.” She said, as our gear hung from the bathroom door. That was the last normal day we had together…",1,1765331161.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

Upon entering Haze’s room, I was instantly greeted by a blast of cold, stagnant air, like something out of an office space. A printer beeped softly in the corner, several binders worth of paper loosely scattered around the central table in the common space. A small dog collar was lying crumpled atop a leather arm chair.

I paid this no mind.

One of the rooms was clearly the Governor’s, a pressed suit lying unused atop his bed, which also seemed untouched. The other room, however, was a cluster of strange and unrelated items. Casual attire clothing lay discarded on the floor next to a sewing machine. Lining the closet and walls were formal attire suits and technological anomalies looking like something out of a stereotypical 80’s hacker’s room. Among these already strange outliers, a frighteningly disorganized tangle of red yarn interwove between tacked up pictures and the computer screens themselves.

It truly looked like something out of a serial killer’s paranoid dungeon.

My heart squirmed with unease, my eyes flicking to see a shovel propped up against the far corner, a flash of blurriness showing its handle coated with blood before my eyes readjusted to reveal it as nothing but regular wood.

“Welcome,” Haze gestured around before wrapping up a
Cheetos bag on the counter and placing it in the room’s safe. I nervously tried to steal another glance into her room before she walked over to the door herself, opening it wide and grinning. 

“Better not go in here,” she giggled, “I’m a bit of a mess. Another secret between us.”

She closed the door before rummaging casually through the room’s contents, eventually reappearing with the clock in hand. She again closed the door behind her as she walked back into the main space.

She plopped onto the couch, laying down on her stomach across its entirety. She dropped the clock against the coffee table before looking up to me, gesturing to the other couch.

“Stay a while, will ya?” Her haughty tone was almost endearing at this point, “Now is when things get interesting.”

“Uh sure,” I began walking over slowly, stealing another glance at Mr. Borden’s room, “Um, Mr. Borden? He’s not . . .”

“Not here . . . ever,” Haze rolled onto her back, holding up a piece of paper to the light before beginning to scribble on it with a black pen, “You might be slowly figuring this out, but I’m actually alone probably 97 percent of the time.”

“You do have your . . . quirks,” I nodded in lighthearted
agreement, stiffly sitting on the couch opposite her, “I guess I’m slowly learning this.”

“Oh it gets worse,” she giggled to herself, looking to me and smiling before sliding the paper down to the table. She moved the clock to sit atop it.

“So that’s why the whole . . . paranormal thingy . . .” I slowly leaned forward to look at the paper, “To pass the time alone?
Weren’t you just at a fundraiser or whatever? I bet there were a ton of people there.”

Scratched on the paper were the words, “Pattern Item 14 – The Wind Up Clock.”

There was more text beneath the clock itself, though I couldn’t quite read it.

“Well that’s how it usually goes,” Haze laughed, “Alone forever until suddenly surrounded by people. Though creepy old men are never much company. Without getting too existential on you here, John, do you really think you wouldn’t feel alone in the presence of others even if no one remembered you?”

This last question had a bitter taste to it. It seemed general enough, but the air chilled in a strange way, her eyes scanning my response.

'Was she . . . was that directed at me? Was I supposed to remember something?'

“No, you’re right, that would be lonely,” I finally nodded carefully, “I’m . . . yeah, no, that definitely sucks.”

“Well, first world problems, I suppose,” she laughed with an air of fakeness I only remembered hearing when we had first talked at the rally. That clearly wasn’t the answer she was looking for.

“So, er, what exactly are we doing?” I tried to readjust my weight, looking at the clock, “What’s your plan here?”

“We wait,” she spoke, looking leisurely at the ceiling,
“Paranormal stuff is kinda like fishing. Half the fun is not catching anything.”

“Haha, alright, well I like fishing, I guess,” I nodded, looking around the room and sinking slightly further into the couch, “Are we like . . . testing anything, though? Like, what do you expect to happen?”

I looked again at the clock. It certainly seemed innocent enough. Its grungy, faded glass poorly reflected Haze’s silver eyes as she looked at me and smiled.

“If I tell you what I’m testing, it will throw the experiment off,” she rolled back onto her stomach, holding out her hand and
gesturing to mine, “Haven’t you heard of confirmation bias?”

I listened carefully, simultaneously extending my hand towards her, not exactly sure what she was going for.

“Or the observer-expectancy effect?” She grasped my hand
delicately and gazed at my palm as if about to paint my nails, “If I tell you, for example, that the clock is a spirit box and vibrates when the departed try to communicate through it, you’ll have a mental breakdown if the clock so much as shutters when I kick the table.”

“Right, looking for information to fit the hypothesis you gave,” I nodded, “Even if it doesn’t quite fit. That’s all I remember from science fair, actually, haha. Is . . . that’s not what you’re actually expecting though, right? The spirit box thing?”

“Oh no, of course not,” she laughed, licking her pointer finger, “It will seem much more insignificant than that.”

She brought her finger to my hand, beginning to absentmindedly scrub at the writing she had scrawled.

“I must escape.”

“Whoa, er, okay, didn’t like the message after all?” I had to sit awkwardly to extend my arm far enough, “Haha, it was kinda
sinister, after all.”

She paused for a second before smiling and continuing to scrub, glancing up to me.

“I just don’t want you to be confused in the morning,” she giggled, “Maybe . . . what would you like instead? I’m a bit of an artist, you know.”

“Hmmm, a temporary marker tattoo?” I laughed, unable to keep myself from smiling, “I don’t know. I kinda like . . . jellyfish?”

“You would,” she giggled, nearly yanking me off the couch as she pulled my arm closer, uncapping her pen with her mouth and getting to work diligently. “What a weird animal to like.”

I waited for several awkward seconds before trying to steal a glance at her handiwork. I suddenly felt my bones nearly break, Haze’s eyes narrowing to snake-like sickles as she snapped my wrist towards her.

“Get out of town,” she hissed, tongue sticking out slightly as she quickly got back to work and I felt the pen more hastily carving against my skin. I laughed to myself.

“There!” She finally made an overzealous final stroke before her expression rose in sheer joy and she grasped my skin harder with both hands, “I think I’m getting good at this! Best one yet!”

Her hands slowly loosened their grip and I formed a confused smile before turning my hand toward myself and stifling an excited laugh.

It was just short of a kindergartener’s scribblings, a single half circle with three wiggly lines jutting out bellow.

She had worked at it for nearly 2 straight minutes. “Awww, that’s amazing,” I giggled, “It’s so cute!”

She beamed, proudly shrugging. She seemed to nervously extend the moment before her face fell slightly, her eyes steadily flicking away.

“I’m having fun right now,” she spoke slowly, making me look up from the jellyfish as if there was a big “but” coming.

“Right, haha,” I grinned, “I, I mean, yeah, me too. Um . . . sooo
. . .”

“Well, I just, I don’t want to confuse you again by doing
something weird,” she looked trapped, “I don’t want to ruin this.” 

She sighed, shoulders slumping slightly.

“Listen,” she breathed carefully, looking extremely uncomfortable in this sudden vulnerability, “Let me preface this by saying this isn’t as sad and lame as it sounds, and I’m praying you’ll understand that soon . . . but the fact is . . . you’re the first person I’ve connected with in a long . . . long time.”

I was unsure of how to respond to this. I partially opened my mouth to respond, but she wasn’t done.

“Shut up.” She seemed unconcerned with me, “Don’t take that as praise. I talked about how alone I felt alone in my daily life, and that doesn’t mean whatever you think it does. The fact is it’s . . . so much worse now. I don’t know how much longer I can take it. I know I’m being punished for the things I did before, things I regret every day.”

“Hey, whoa . . .” I tried to interject, “It’s okay, what are you-”

 “Everyone hated me for the things I did,” she just shook her
head as if knowing I would still miss the mark if I said anything, “But I still liked it. More than that. I loved it . . . because they were talking about me.”

Her eyes flashed to me, as is holding me as some ghost of Christmas past.

“I know you want to ask me,” she now wouldn’t release my gaze, “about the rumors. Whether I lied about things, whether I’m as bad as they say.”

“I wasn’t . . .” I shook my head, “It doesn’t really-”

“Yes you were,” she barely even gave my words a passing thought, “Unfortunately you can’t lie to me. I know what you’re going to say before you do. And it’s okay. It doesn’t matter to me much anymore, but it should to you. You should want to know. After all these times I refused to answer you directly.” 

She fidgeted softly, uncapping and recapping the pen.

“It’s all true,” she spoke to the floor, her eyes staring at her heels, “Everyone hates me and I’m pathetic. I’ve been alone my whole life, and there’s no one to blame but me. I went to a private school, but the teachers were too afraid to fail me, and the students were too afraid to assume they could talk to me. So, naturally, I started making things up so people would have to acknowledge me.”

She sighed, before quasi-shrugging and looking back up to me. 

“It got worse the further in I dug myself,” she spoke as if
presenting a well-researched argument, “my initial cry for attention and sympathy when I was just a kid soon became attention for the wrong reasons. I got older and people realized I had been lying, but to me it didn’t really matter, I would take anything over the loneliness . . . and soon I was almost expected to have a new scandal every week. People loved to hate me, and I loved to be on people’s minds.”

The manor creaked silently, not a single sound penetrating Haze’s confession as she now sat quietly. Her eyes appeared calm, but I could tell she was having difficulty maintaining her gaze.

“So . . . so that’s the understanding of myself I’ve come to,” she finally finished off, “That’s the whole story. I have nothing else to say in defense, I hope I answered any questions you might have.”

“I . . .” I stuttered, blindsided by this, “Uh . . .”

“Oh, also I’m sorry,” She quickly intercut, “I know it may not have personally affected you, but it may still sway your decision to know that I do realize what I did was wrong. My own personal problems don’t justify wrong behavior.”

“De- . . . decision?” I was still trying to focus her words, “What do you-”

“Well sure,” she looked like she didn’t quite know what to do with her hands, “Whether or not you forgive me . . .”

Silence fell again before she quickly added, “Oh, and don’t let the fact that I said you’re the first friend I’ve had in a long time sway your decision. I know I said it was a preface, but it was more of a manipulation tactic to force your hand. I’m sorry, old habits.”

I was stunned for several more seconds, watching her again almost interject before thinking better of it and simply waiting nervously.

“I mean . . .” I finally spoke slowly, “I guess . . . I guess I appreciate you being so open, and you have a weirdly good ability to look at your own flaws . . . so thanks for being so honest, that . . . that can’t be easy.”

She blinked cautiously. Her hands were folded neatly in her lap. 

“But I guess, and maybe I should feel bad about this,” I
continued, saying the words as I found them, “But I really didn’t care about any of that, the bad things, I mean. You seem alright to me, and you’ve been nothing but nice to me . . . so, like, I don’t know, is that weird? I can’t really forgive you for things you did to other people, but I can still be your friend right? I personally like you.”

Her eyes had a blank look as I could almost see the gears churning, letting out a lot of line and fighting to reel back in a response.

“Right, that’s fine, right?” I tried to help her out, but was almost more so talking to myself, “It’d be like if your best friend was actually a murderer the whole time, you’d feel really weird and conflicted, but if they were always nice to you – okay wait, that’s a bad example, you should probably call the police anyway . . . but I mean, it just sounds like you were a scared kid, and what kid isn’t a giant douche liar? I mean, right? Just thankfully most kids don’t get broadcast on TV. Forget the metaphor, it doesn’t matter, none of it matters. I believe that you’re sorry, I mean, that’s a dick move to people who actually have leukemia for example, but I just can’t hate you.”

I gritted my teeth.

“But like, you seriously don’t actually have leukemia, though, right?” I cringed out.

“I do not.” She spoke.

My instant, overpowering relief felt clouded over by extreme guilt for feeling it.

“So that, for example, is weirdly more relieving than angering to me,” I nervously looked away, “I’m having fun with you, and maybe it’s selfish of me, but that’s all I really care about. That, and probably don’t do stuff like that again . . . obviously. I don’t know why my opinion matters to you, but I think you’re cool.”

Haze’s eyes looked at me, and if she was capable of showing true emotion, I imagine there might have been something groundbreaking there.

After a strangely long and monumentally uncomfortable period of eye contact, I finally looked back to the jellyfish on my hand.

“So, I guess that’s everything on my end?” I shakily put out my hand for the pen, “I don’t really know where that puts us, but . . . would you like an animal as well? Some activity to, er, diffuse this weirdness? I don’t know if I can make something quite as good as this beauty, but I’m willing to give it a shot.”

“Naturally,” she smiled, slowly placing her hand into the one I had extended for the pen, before suddenly looking as if she had been shot. She lurched back.

I flinched as well, watching her nervously read my reaction between frantic eye darts to her wrist. She again licked her finger and scrubbed furiously at her own skin. She did this to both her wrists.

“Sorry,” she tried to save face as her finger smudged with black ink, “I write notes to myself. Motivation quotes, check lists . . . things I won’t say that are way more embarrassing than either of those two examples.”

She flushed, before grinning and lowering her hand into mine again.

“No need for you to see that,” she snickered, pressing the pen into my other hand and leaning over the table uncomfortably far before frowning. She huffily blew a wisp of hair from her face before half rolling half crawling over the table, the clock shuttering beneath her.

“Okay, er, alright,” Immediately went from 0 to overwhelmingly flustered, moving stiffly aside as she slumped beside me, “What . . . er . . . what do you want? Jellyfish as well? Pacific Sea Nettle are pretty cool looking actually, haha . . . Don’t know why I know that.”

“Dragon,” her eyes lit up, smile reaching her ears, “A big ‘ol toothy one. Make it eating a lion.”

“Haha, alriiiight,” I chuckled, feeling instantly better with her outward excitement. I cocked my head and turned her hand a few different directions. “Dragons are cool . . . but I’m not sure if there’s exactly enough room for-”

“It can be a small lion,” she shrugged, “So long as the dragon is big comparatively.” Her eyes sunk slightly then, fingers curling faintly.

“And thank you,” she muttered almost under her breath, face flushing, “For that . . . the words and stuff.”

“No, no problem, really” I felt a hot flash. I cautiously put the pen to her skin to avoid looking at her, “Er, here we go . . . I can’t say I’ve drawn a dragon in a while . . .”

“I think you got it,” Haze just pressed closer, “And don’t look now . . . But your so called broken clock is ticking again.”

“Wha?” I went to move my head before she physically put her other hand up to block my view.

“Dragon first,” she pressed, though her eyes remained fixed on the table, “It’s not going anywhere. Yet.”

“Er, okay, alright,” I sped up considerably, her intense focus making me nervous. I watched her eyes dart from the table to the front door, and then back again.

'Just what was she waiting for?'

I trailed the dragon’s tail down onto her wrist before my pen stopped dead on her flesh.

Where she had smudged away, I could still faintly make out the faintest of drawings.

It wasn’t writing . . . certainly not an inspiration note. It was a Pacific Sea Nettle.

“Victory Cheeto fulfillment any second now,” Haze just brimmed with excitement, not meeting my gaze as I looked up to her in confusion, “Here we go . . .”

Her eyes were now flat out staring the front door. She didn’t break even to blink.

I pushed the faded drawing out of my mind for the time being, narrowing my eyes slightly as I scribbled in little drips of blood coming from the limp lion in the dragon’s mouth.

“Alright,” I breathed out with the last line, actually smiling slightly at how it turned out, “The poor lion didn’t stand a chance.”

Haze finally broke her gaze from the front door as she lifted up her hand and I finally used the opportunity to gaze at the clock.

Sure enough, the second hand trembled around the dial, looking like some kind of mechanical zombie.

“Fucking awesome!” Haze giggled, poking at the ink and grinning widely, “Holy hell, this is actually really excellent.”

“Aw, thanks,” I flushed, “I’m useless in most other aspects, but ya know . . .”

“Okay, maybe it needs some time alone,” Haze glanced back to the clock and then the door, “I’m . . . I was so certain this was the one . . . We might be stopping the pattern from completing by being in here . . .”

Her eyes actually seemed to deepen in worry with that last sentence.

“Come on, let’s take a walk,” She jumped up with a smile,
whirling around and extending her hand to me, “And I don’t think you’re useless, but you’re going to have to fish for better compliments than that if you want me to go further.”

“That wasn’t,” I frowned, then laughed as I grabbed her hand and she yanked me up with frightening strength, “That wasn’t fishing for compliments, I was saying that genuinely.”

“As was I,” she grinned, making her way to the door, “I’m just saying, if you’re baiting me . . . might as well go for broke and say something ballsy like, ‘Oh, man, Haze would never like, totally make out with me or-”

Her words died out as I grabbed the clock and we both stopped dead, for entirely different reasons.

My mind was racing over her words, going a mile a minute.

'Was that . . . what the hell?! Was she making fun of me or . . .'

Haze, instead, seemed to fall into a shattering realization.

 “You . . .” She slowly spoke, continuing to move to the door
carefully, but putting out her hand to stop me, “You’re the pattern.”

A sudden sound softly echoed from a distant place as if in a dream. It sounded almost like a . . . howl.

Haze paled beyond ghost white, pointed finger landing directly on the clock in my hand. My eyes flashed down to it in confusion.

'Wait . . . why did I picked it up?'

“It didn’t complete because I changed you,” she looked like she was going to be sick, “Okay, okay, just, I’m sorry, John. I’m going to leave you alone for a little bit now.”

“What wait?” I pressed forward, “What are you-” 

She slammed the door.

The lights above me flickered. The slightest trail of blood ran down my arm as several divots softly formed.

'What the hell had just happened? It was so damn impossible to put a finger on Haze. There was almost certainly something wrong with her mentally. I had no idea what affliction would cause such weird, psychotic bouts of detachment from reality, but she seemed so normal 80 percent of the time. Shouldn’t there have been some indication that something was wrong even during normal conversations with her? Instead her psychosis was like a light switch being turned off and on.'

I looked down at the clock in my hand, going to place it back down on the paper before seeing the text that had been previously covered up by the clock itself.

“There should be a metal windup clock from room 12 on top of this sheet of paper.” It read in impeccable handwriting, “If there is not, pattern cycle 2 has started, Return to B-5.”

'What the?'

My eyes flashed back to the closed door of Haze’s room, remembering the jumble of string and similarly styled papers that had been lining the walls.

I nearly took a step toward it before stopping myself, hesitating and looking at the clock in my hands again.

'Jesus Christ, this was- . . . this was CRAZY! There was something seriously wrong here, something seriously wrong with Haze. Maybe I . . . if she truly was staying alone here, obsessed with these delusional . . . patterns or whatever, just how far off the edge was she? Was she a danger to herself?'

I shakily stepped forward, not even sure if I had convinced myself I was doing it for a noble cause, or was just too damn curious. Her door loomed ahead, my hand softly resting on the cold knob.

I swung it open.

It was just what I remembered from my early glances. Countless paper scraps sourced from the living room made up strange letters and numbers, some connected by red string, others blank with large question marks beside them on sticky notes. Some string paths extended to several computer screens, taped to the glass itself.

The ramblings extended to the ceiling above, several pages of seemingly important documents folded into makeshift origami to spell large letters directly above the bed.

“Start With A-1”

My stomach churned.

'What was I looking at exactly? How had she physically put up this much material in just a day and a half? This set up looked like it took . . . years.'

I looked around the room to finally catch the combination
“A-1” physically scratched above the left wall. Everything seemed to be catalogued with this letter-number system.

“Look For Patterns: DO NOT BREAK.” Was written in more large letters above “A-1”. Countless sketches and pages of writing were strung together to apparently point out what I could only assume were whatever patterns she was talking about.

I went to investigate further, before something on her dresser caught my eye.

“E-17” was written above a duplicate of the paper out in the living room.

“There should be a metal windup clock from room 12 on top of this sheet of paper.” It read in the same impeccable handwriting, “If there is not, Return to B-5.”

My eyes flashed up to the ceiling, rapidly locating “B-5”
scrawled on the rafters.

My horror quickly grew as I tried to make sense of the nonsense below it.

“Pattern Item 14 - The wind-up clock” headed the sheet of paper. This was one of the few items connected by the red string, although a large question mark was sticky noted beside it.

The paper continued, “Origin Location – Room 12. This wind- up clock will stop the night of cycle Day 2 pattern at 2:38. Normal mode of location change, Pattern Character 12 to Pattern Character 4 at 5:30. Clock spends cycle Day 2 in Pattern Character 4’s workshop before being returned to pattern completion at 3pm.”

Another sheet of paper was tacked on below the question mark sticky note.

“Test 1” it read, “The wind-up clock is a possible contender for the key. I will remove the clock from Pattern Character 12’s possession prior to transfer. Pattern should account for change and return item to Origin Location to restart Day 2 cycle. Which pattern character will facilitate this, and if they are unsuccessful, will Day 1 Cycle start, or will the pattern be broken?”

“I don’t think this is a good idea,” A note beside this drew an arrow to the text in the exact same handwriting, “Let Pattern Character 12 return to origin after checking for key.”

“Impossible,” another note from the same author corrected this, “Other side effects are yet to be discovered, but minimal transfer of item results in strong pattern change. Pattern Item 14 is very likely to contain key, but retrieving it likely means breaking pattern. I must choose if I can proceed. Damage may have already been done.”

I blinked slowly, eyes narrowing in nothing but concern.

'Was this really all Haze? Was she so sick, writing to herself?'

The clock felt heavy in my hand, faintly ticking beneath my fingers.

'This was messed up beyond what I could comprehend, I
couldn’t understand these ramblings any more than I wanted to. But at the very least, Haze was defacing the walls of the room in her apparent hysteria. This was really getting out of hand. Someone needed to be told about this. This couldn’t go on, I had to find her.'

As my hand landed on the doorknob of her room, I realized that her side of the door was layered with countless scratches. More than I could count, almost as if someone had tried to claw their way out.

I shivered.

Upon exiting, the manor was cold and dead, lobby empty and lightless. Whatever patrons may have been there seemed altogether absent. The lights above shimmered slightly. A speck of blood dotted my shoe as I walked, it barely registering in my mind that my arm had begun to bleed yet again.

Thankfully, Aunt Cheryl was sitting in the middle of the lobby on a pile of suitcases, turning around at my approach.

Her lonely form was out of place and haunting in the darkness, her paper pale skin appearing almost grey if it weren’t for the ghastly tear marks beginning to leave her midsection to spill gore to the ground. Her crusted eyes were ringed with dead black, her tired gaze filled with death.

""Two nights, is what Mr. Borden's agent said,"" she looked like she was trying to remember, mouth unhinged as if broken, ""But you can't tell anyone that, okay?""

""Huh, what?"" I slowly came to a stop, limbs faltering as I felt a weight relieve itself from my right side, ""Oh, right, okay . . . I mean, security reasons, I guess probably. Well, it's a big manor, lots of rooms with lots of different people. I'll be fine . . . Unless I'm cleaning her room.""

My arm slopped to the ground with a loud squelch, stretched elastic skin splitting like ribbons at the bite mark.

""Maybe, maybe not,"" Cheryl grinned a smile that ruptured past her broken face, before jutting to her feet as her phone went off. ""Yes?"" She answered hastily. Her torso began to slide from her lacerated midsection, massive bite marks like a great white shark revealing themselves as blood spilled to the floor.

The dead skin of her wrist flayed like paper in the wind, her ghastly bones breaking through the rotting flesh, phone not even in her hand as she walked toward the front door and haphazardly waved me goodbye, ""It's about time! Yes! Of course there's a lot of luggage! Yes I need both of you!""

I breathed heavily, walking heavily up the master staircase to the second floor. I took a few seconds to marvel at the massive glass chandelier dangling precariously above the lobby, as I did every time I walked up the steps.

Tonight, its grand, elegant form appeared particularly mocking. The clock in my pocket ticked softly.",1,1765330893.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

I am a laidback nerdy dude who’s generally shy, but a real goofball around people I’m comfortable with. Raised Catholic, but not religious. I’m the type of guy who prefers chill meetups with a tight-knit group of friends as opposed to going out and partying. I play games on PC/Xbox/Switch, and my main rotation right now consists of helldivers 2 and dbd, and I just did my first playthrough of the last of us part 2. I am also very much into movies/tv/YouTube and some of my favorite franchises and things to watch include Star Wars, LOTR, The Thing, Alien, Futurama (my comfort show), and YouTubers like markiplier and explosions&fire. I’m also a big music guy and some of my favorite artists are Billie eilish, paramore, wallows, clairo (not performative I swear), tame impala, motionless in white, and my chemical romance to name a few!

I have a very bad/edgy sense of humor so you’d better be into getting spammed with shitposts and weird memes!! I’m also a cat dad to two lovely ladies who are my world and I love animals of all kinds (except spiders, sorry). I know this all makes me seem like I’m a homebody, which I mostly am, but I also love nature and would love to go on walks and nerd out with you about plants, fungi, rocks, or wildlife :3 And of course we’d go on food and coffee runs!

I am fortunate enough that I am able to continue my studies and that I can work on something I am passionate about after pushing past a lot of personal struggles I faced in my early 20s. I also lean left politically, I wanted to make that clear if my heavy science background didn’t. I have worked on myself a lot and I think that it is a testament to the type of person I am: resilient, deeply curious, hungry for knowledge, and loyal to a fault. I understand that some people would like someone more established with their career and such, and I respect that, but if there’s anyone who sees potential between us and is happy to grow along with me, I’d love to hear from you. I’d like someone I can laugh with, nerd out with, and whom is like a best friend to be with long term, maybe even lifelong if things go right.

Skill started. Everything was great for a few hours, done the quests when I could, tried charting, I liked that. The port tasks was good at first but the xp was really really bad. But then it got really boring and felt really slow. 

I later found out about the 10k xp reward. Got myself there excited to skip a few levels which was boring me. Got there to get 300xp. This was really shitty for the people that don’t watch streamers like myself this put my mood down more. Went back to port tasks.

Once i could do bounties, I got so excited because it what I was looking forward to the most. Upgraded my boat as much as I could and installed my cannon. Went and did a few tasks and my mind was. 
Well this sucks. It felt awkward and not fun at all. 
Took myself back to port tasks. 10pm came was so bored out of my mind I logged off and took myself to bed, my wife was confused because she thought I’d be up all night. Told her how it was over hyped and was not as good as i was hoping and wasn’t worth loosing sleep over. 

The next day: 
After reading posts on Reddit it made me feel better knowing I wasn’t alone with how disappointing sailing was. But I was going to train it to 99 whether I like it or not because I wanted my max cape back.

I tried out salvaging. At first it also felt slow but it was a change from port tasks so I stayed on it till I could do trails. After unlocking trails, I really enjoyed it. Learning the course was fun and frustrating but rewarding when I beat the times! Then I seen the xp getting a lot faster. But the problem was after a. Hour of marlins trails. My wrist was hurting and was getting bored going around in circles. Sailing started to feel like agility to me. Took myself for another early night.

3rd day:
I remember on the first day that I enjoyed charting, so I was going to take a break from trails and try enjoy this skill so I wasn’t moaning all the way to 99.
And I spent the next 2 days charting. The xp wasn’t brilliant, but I was enjoying sailing and the game. Did all the charting I could till I was locked out of it.

After charting:
I took myself to the 2nd trails course. Did swordfish and shark. Hated every second of it. I didn’t bother to try marlin the lag was unbearable. It was too frustrating, I was swearing. Logged out.

The next day:
I couldn’t do anymore charts. I didn’t want to do trails I went to salvage. I did this all the way to level 74? To unlock the areas that I couldn’t get to. Once I could I finished off charting and unlocked all the chests, loved the xp at the end but was still a way off to 99.

I heard about the crystal extractor. Got myself to the 3rd course. It did take me awhile to beat swordfish and shark, my wrist was hurting. So took myself to salvage.

I did so much salvage. I started to really enjoy it with the upgraded boats crew mates etc. I started to do late nights just watching lord of the rings while salvaging along. I did this all the way to 98.
( 1 barrel )

Got to 98 and wanted to try and get marlin time on the 3rd course before 99. So fully upgraded my medium boat. And marlin took no time at all. I actually enjoyed it and stayed there to 99! 

Post 99:
I wanted to fully upgrade my fishing/combat boat. But I ran out of gp and didn’t want to sell any of my pvm gear so I ironmaned it.
Spent about 4/5 days at frost dragons. Was awful before the update. Was fine after. 

After my boat was fully upgraded (apart from keel)
I took myself to sharks for the hook.
Well I hated it, I tried different spots, different ways to fight them. I didn’t enjoy it. Took myself to the safe spot till I got the hook ( went super dry ofc)

Vampire krakens I seen a video on YouTube about this safe spot. But by the time I got to them it was patched. But went to the spot anyways because I had the tile markers for the one that spawned. 

This is when it all changed. When I was at sharks I was commanding each crew to attack different sharks. But at krakens I didn’t, I had them both attacking my target. I prefer this so much more and wiggling the boat for when the target wasn’t in front of me. I went from hating it to enjoying it. Got my bottled storm and stayed for longer to try and get the ink. But got another bottled storm, sold for 50m each and sold the hook for 55m, went from 2m go to 160m+ gp. I did end up leaving to get the other clogs but I will be back for the ink.

So my thoughts on sailing;

Port task: love the idea, but needs better xp and reward imo.

Bounties: Never bothered with them after the 2nd day. Heard they wasn’t worth the xp and made no difference to drop rate. 

Salvage: i love it, it was so chill, I couldn’t complain. I  know a lot of Ironman will disagree but I don’t think barrel needs changing, even tho I only got 1 myself. They are so cheap for a 1/20k. They would be too cheap if droprate is changed.

Trails: They are frustrating but rewarding when you beat the time. I personally didn’t like it as a training method because of how boring it got and it hurt my hands.

Charting: This was the highlight for me. Loved it and hope they bring more in the future.

Trawling: please fit the xp rates. It’s farrr to low. I would have loved this to have been. Training method towards 99 sailing but it’s far too low for how active you need to be. Disappointing.

Combat: I learnt to like it, kind of, but I think it can be so much better. I really hope jagex make it more enjoyable before future bosses/raids. I don’t like the ui for it and commanding your crew to attack different npc was horrible for me. Maybe clicking on the cannon then the npc would have been better? If possible or something like that. Idk
I did think it was weird that you attack with mage/range while your crew is on the cannons while you attack and collect loot. It just feels off and awkward. 

Crystal extractor: This was an awful idea. I hated clicking on it every 60 seconds but kinda felt like I had too because it was there. It made me mess up at trails a few times and it didn’t make salv as afk because I was clicking on the 600xp button. It annoyed me that much towards the end I ended up deleting it.

Now that I’m maxed I will be aiming to go for all sailing clogs and back to pet hunting. 

Did I enjoy the skill? It was ok, wasn’t as good as I was hoping sadly. I think I had high hopes because I really enjoyed the rs3 new skills. Archogoly was fantastic! Nercomany was also brilliant. Both skills had me hooked from level 1 to 200m xp. Sailing did make me appreciate the rs3 devs abit more.

Would I vote for another skill? At the moment. No, but my mind could be changed, I’ll see what they do with the rest of sailing.

If you have made it this far thank you for reading :)

1pipsvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1pipsvu/i_contacted_her_again_to_only_share_the_positive/,"I contacted her again to ONLY share the positive and serious things that happened in the last 4 years, I feel so dumb...","I'm finishing my studies (and school FOR LIFE) this Thursday, so 1 month ago, I contacted my Nmom, saying I'm moving out far away from where I grew up and that I'm willing to share the positive things that happened over the years and some things I'm wondering over a coffee at a public place. I also wanted to know where my grandpa is buried and maybe have my Asperger's diagnosis and a ring I wore to my little finger when I was young. 

I didn't told her that I won't confront her about stuff she done or I learned she done, I don't want that. I NEVER wanted that

I only wanted to share with her what I had become, what I discovered that maybe she would be glad I did because we have that in common or because she knew the movie/book/song when she was young. I really hoped she would be proud of me. 

Before I went NC, she was calling me once in a while asking what I was doing, what my plans were, etc. and when I responded vaguely because I have a right to have a private life, she pushed things, demanding to be more precise, wich made me VERY uncomfortable. Those actions were the past straw that made me go NC.

She wasn't comfortable about meeting over a coffee, once so I can tell her my stuff and talk face to face. Non problem, I understand it's a lot to process. Instead, I chose to tell her over the phone, over multiple calls. After that, I wanted to carry on my own path because reconnecting and rebuilding our mother-daughter relationship is a bridge that has been burned.

Over 4 weeks or so, we talked on the phone twice, her birthday was during those 4 weeks, but I didn't text her so I don't give her high hopes, the 3rd call went fine, but the 4th...

For some context, on the first call, one of the first questions she asked was: ''You said you were moving out very far soon...WHERE is ''far''? '' in the same demanding tone she used to. I was comfortable telling her it was 3-4 hours away in the same province we are in.

SO, BACK TO THE 4th CALL...
I asked her how her weekend went, she tells me and asked me back. I told her it was great and I just finished unpacking from being back to my airbnb... She tells me ''I just don't understand why you won't tell me, just... WHERE if ''far''?!''...Good gosh, again? I reply ''Well, it's a small town 3-4 hours a little up north with a lot of gossip, that's what i'm comfortable sharing''.

Mind you, it's been 4 years since I went NC AND she broke my trust. There is no way she's entitled to know EVERYTHING about my PRIVATE life. I'm not entitled to know all about her private life too, she didn't have to share what she's not comfortable sharing. Juste because you tell me where do you live now doesn't mean you're int he right to know it too.

It seems like I released H.P Lovecraft's Kraken. She went ON AND ON AND ON AND ON about that at her age, people that half-talk to her, that don't say THE REAL THINGS, that only care about their apple core, it doesn't pass.

I asked her ''what real things?''. I talked to her about my relationship and break up with my abusive ex, was this not real enough?

I spare you the details, but she put me in a mental corner with her questions, played the victim car, the ''you forgot my birthday'' card, the ''is it TOO MUCH to say THANK YOU??'' (she implied saying thank you for making me go to specialist so I could go to regular school, even with Asperger's), the ''when you'll be a mother, you'll understand'' (yes indeed, I will understand when I'll be a mother, but it won't be the things you think I'll understand, you won't even think about it), the ''the world is small, everything ends up being known'', that it's important to confess to your family when things are bad, so we don't burn out (I told her it's a parent's job to make their child comfortable to feel safe with their parents and my dad and her shot themselves in the foot with their actions and words), that it's important to maintain contacts with my sister (she antagonized her and brainwashed so I thought that she was a bad influence and my mom would hate me like she hated her when we were young),  she asked about how's my sister doing, I told her that if she wants to know, the answer has to come from her mouth because I don't share info about people when they go NC with someone, she laughed nervously-passive-aggressive-ish and the cherry on the cake... By hearing what I said, she accused my sister and I to be insensitive, wondering if she raised us to be like this, we're ungrateful, playing tough like it's a game, ignored her when she needed help, I texted her 1 year and a half after her break up and that was a stupid decision...

Yeah, sure, while you were SURVIVING (like she says), I was FOR SURE living my best life in euphoria everyday!

I lost it. I knew that I lost it and that I shouldn't have, I shouldn't have told her about my antidepressants, the day she did something I had something important (couldn't fail that exam) and... I don't remember, I overshared and it's making me feel very stupid.

When I was done, all of a sudden she was ''calm'' and said ''ok, we're done for today, it's the last week of your internship, I don't want you to be deranged by me, so do your last week, we'll talk next week'' 

... she says she understands why we went NC my sister and I, but her actions clearly show that no, she doesn't. Can't wait for the ''next week'' call saying to her it's too late, I went NC because her actions and words burned my trust and how she acted last time were the same actions that lead me to NC.

I would've love to share things we maybe had in common, that she would be proud of me; even after nagging me again and again with her ex about my driver's license, she didn't even bat an eye when I told her I finally got it and it's way less scary than I thought.

I feel really stupid and naive and mad, but I tried and I won't have to live with the regret of never reaching out. In the meantime, I can finally sit with those feelings so I can process them.

There are other people who are proud of/happy for me. 
I also can't wait to break the cycle, even if postpartum and motherhood will be without the mother I wish I had, which is very scary for me. ",5,1765330803.0,raisedbynarcissists,4,0.86,False
1pipsor,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1pipsor/my_brothers_hello_is_starting_to_sound_like_a/,My Brother’s Hello is Starting to Sound Like a Question,"\[Entry 1 - August 3rd\]

My name is Claude. My parents are on a three-week cruise, a reward for decades of work and worry. They left me, the dependable son, in charge of the house and of Leo.

Leo is my older brother. Three years ago, a rupture in his brainstem—a cavernous angioma, a term my mother uses like a shield—left him in a persistent vegetative state. His mind is a distant lighthouse. The only signal it sends, the only proof that someone is still manning the light, is the word ""hello.""

My days have a rhythm, a liturgy of care that keeps the silence of this house at bay.

**7:00 AM:** The Krups coffee maker gurgles to life, brewing yesterday's grounds into something that tastes of bitterness and thin, metallic hope. I drink it black, standing at the kitchen sink. The coffee is stale by noon, but I keep the pot going, a constant, acrid presence.

**7:30 AM:** I climb the stairs. The fourth step from the top groans a specific, familiar note—a G-flat of worn pine and settling nails. I enter Leo's room. It smells of antiseptic wipes and the faint, cloying sweetness of the Ensure formula. The Respironics V60 ventilator hisses its steady, mechanical breath. Its LED display is a soft, eternal green. My first task is to check its settings: Tidal Volume 450ml, Rate 12, FiO2 21%. The numbers are a prayer for stability.

""Good morning, Leo,"" I say, my voice rough with sleep.

His eyes, the same sea-glass green as mine, are open and fixed on the ceiling. His mouth, slack around the ventilator tube, works for a moment. A soft, wet sound. Then the word, clear and placid.

""Hello.""

It's our ritual. For years, it's been a comfort. A tiny, consistent flare from the silent continent of his mind. I perform the rest of my duties with a nurse's detachment: suction his airway, check his diaper, wipe his body with a damp cloth. His skin is cool and waxy. I log everything in the blue binder on the nightstand: \*8:05 AM - Oral care completed. Vitals stable.\*

The days are long and quiet. I exist in the space between the hiss of the ventilator and the creak of the floorboards. Leo's ""hello"" is the punctuation mark of my day.

\[Entry 2 - August 7th\]

The first oddity was a sound. It was late, maybe 11 PM. I was in my room, directly below Leo's, reading. A *thump* came from above. Not loud, but solid. Dense. Like a heavy book falling on its face.

I listened, my breath held. The house settled. The refrigerator kicked on.

I crept upstairs. The fourth step groaned its usual complaint. Leo's door was ajar. The nightlight cast a soft glow. He was in his bed, perfectly still. Nothing was out of place.

""Leo?"" I whispered.

His eyes were closed.

""Hello,"" he murmured, the word soft and blurred by slumber.

I stood there for a long time. I checked the windows. Locked. I stood in the center of the room and stared at the ceiling, as if I could see the source of the sound through the plaster. It was probably a muscle spasm. A book falling in a neighbor's house. My imagination, stretched thin by the quiet.

\[Entry 3 - August 10th\]

The correspondence of sounds began two days ago. I’m trying to be logical about it.

I was pacing in my room, a restless animal. Three steps from the bed to the door, a pivot, three steps back. The floorboard by my desk groaned under my weight.

*Creak.*

A moment later, a similar sound came from directly above. From Leo's room.

I froze. Our houses are old. Wood expands and contracts. It was a coincidence. I took a hesitant step towards the window. The floorboard there was silent.

*Creak.*

From above. Another groan, this one mirroring the timing of my step, if not the location.

My heart thudded once, hard. This was… peculiar. I lifted my hand and, feeling foolish, rapped my knuckles twice against the wooden bedpost. *Tap. Tap.*

A beat of silence. Then, from upstairs, two taps. *Tap. Tap.* The same tempo.

A coincidence of acoustics? The house’s skeleton talking to itself? I stood perfectly still, and the house remained still with me. The only constant was the low hum of the V60. I decided to note it in the log, for my own sanity. \*11:14 PM - Audible settling noises from floor joists. Synchronous?\*

\[Entry 4 - August 12th\]

The ""hello"" is changing. I think I'm just tired. The lack of sleep is getting to me.

It's started to feel less like a greeting and more like a… placeholder. I'll walk into his room, and his eyes will seem to track me for a fraction of a second too long before he says it. ""Hello."" I was suctioning his throat this afternoon, a necessary, violent intimacy, and he said it around the plastic catheter, a wet, guttural sound. ""Hhhhellllo."" The sound clung to the inside of my skull.

My routine is fraying. I forgot to log his 2:00 PM meds yesterday. This morning, I found the coffee pot had burned dry, filling the house with the smell of scorched metal and failure.

\[Entry 5 - August 14th\]

The chattering started today.

I was changing his diaper. The room smelled of antiseptic wipes and Ensure. I had just rolled him onto his side when I heard it. A small, dry sound.

*Click. Click.*

I looked at his face. His jaw was trembling, the muscles twitching. His teeth were chattering.

""Leo? Are you cold?"" The question was automatic, pointless.

The chattering stopped. His jaw went slack.

""Hello,"" he said, perfectly calm.

\[Entry 6 - August 16th\]

It happened again last night. Louder. I was in the kitchen, the bread of my sandwich tasteless in my mouth. *Click-click-click-click.* A frantic rhythm from his room. I ran upstairs. He was lying there, peaceful, but his teeth were clattering like dice in a cup. It lasted ten seconds, then stopped.

""Hello,"" he said.

I called the long-term care provider. I tried to explain.

""Mr. Franklin, your brother's condition is stable. The V60 pings us for any physiological anomaly. We see no alerts.""

""But the sounds—the chattering—""

""Patients in a persistent vegetative state can exhibit myoclonic jerks. It can be distressing for family. Are you getting respite care?""

They are not coming. The system sees only green lights.

\[Entry 7 - August 18th\]

The third time, it… escalated.

It was the middle of the night. The sound wasn't just chattering; it was a grinding, a high-pitched squeal of enamel on enamel. I stood frozen at his door. The sound sped up, a frantic, mechanical rhythm. *Clickclickclick-grind-CLICKCLICK—*

It ended with a wet, sickening *crack*.

Silence.

A silence so deep it swallowed the world. The ventilator had stopped hissing.

I didn't sleep. At dawn, I went in. Leo looked the same. His jaw was not misaligned. There was no blood. But his ""Hello” was different now, slurred, the ‘H’ a soft, breathy exhalation. “’Ello.”

The ventilator was off. I checked the power. The plug was seated firmly in the outlet. The LED display was dark. I cycled the power. Nothing. A cold dread poured into me. This was a machine failure. A real, tangible problem. I ran to the basement, to my father's heavy, fireproof SentrySafe where he keeps all the manuals, warranties, and house plans. I fumbled with the combination. I needed the schematic for the V60, the emergency contact for the medical supply company, anything.

I found the house plans first, a thick roll of blueprints. I spread them on the dusty floor, my hands shaking. My eyes scanned the electrical layouts, looking for a dedicated circuit. And that’s when I saw it. The renovation. My room downstairs, and Leo’s room upstairs… they were perfect mirror images. The same dimensions, the same layout. The closet in my room was directly below the closet in his. The floorboard that creaked by my desk was directly below the one that creaked by his.

We were living in perfect vertical alignment.

Then, tucked into the plans, I found the patient file from the care company. A printout of the medication logs. My eyes, frantic, scanned the pages. And I saw it. A small, initialed signature for the nightly Clonazepam. ""C. Franklin."" My signature. But next to it, in a supplemental digital log, the same signature, ""C. Franklin,"" was listed for Leo’s administered dose. I am Claude. He is Leo. The names are different.

I called the care company, my voice a frayed wire. ""There's a mistake in the logs. The signatures are merged.""

The woman was patient. ""Oh, that. It’s a system-wide update for cost-efficiency. For siblings at the same address, the software can designate a 'Primary' and a 'Mirror' patient to streamline automated reporting. The Mirror’s data syncs with the Primary’s. It reduces administrative duplicate entries.""

A mundane, administrative subversion. A software update to save money. Leo isn’t just my brother. To the system, he is my mirror.

\[Final Entry - August 21st\]

The ventilator has been dead for three days. The silence it left behind isn’t empty; it’s a thick, fluid thing that fills the house, pressing against my eardrums until they ache. I am writing this from the kitchen table. My hands are shaking so badly the letters look like they’re vibrating off the page. The pot of stale coffee on the warmer has evaporated into a black, tarry sludge that smells like a burnt-out motor and something else, something sweetly organic, like rot.

I haven’t slept. The house doesn’t feel quiet anymore. It feels like it’s listening.

An hour ago, a new sound started from above.

A soft, dragging sound. A long, slow scrape of weight across the upstairs hallway floorboards. Then a pause, long enough for me to hope it had stopped. Then another drag. It wasn’t the sound of someone walking. It was the sound of something pulling itself, one painful heave at a time. It’s slow. Deliberate. It’s not mimicking my shuffle anymore. It’s learning to move on its own.

I was up there six hours ago. I had to be. The silence was worse than the sounds. I crept up, each step a lifetime, the fourth step groaning its familiar, traitorous note. I pushed Leo’s door open.

The room was freezing. The air was stale and motionless. Leo was on the floor.

He was halfway between the bed and the door, his body a tangled heap of pale limbs and the twisted hospital gown. His head was lolled to the side, his eyes wide open and fixed on the doorway. On me. They weren’t the sea-glass green I know. They were black, depthless pools, like wells that went down forever.

And then he moved.

His head tilted, a jerky, marionette motion, the vertebrae in his neck cracking like a string of firecrackers. It was the first voluntary, targeted movement I have seen him make in years. My breath seized in my throat. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t scream.

His jaw, the one that had chattered and cracked, unhinged. It didn’t just drop open; it sagged downwards, dislocating with a wet, tearing pop, stretching his face into a wide, dark O that was all wrong. From the depths of that black hole, past the ruin of tissue and bone, a sound bubbled up. It wasn’t slurred. It was clear and hollow, a voice from a deep well, and it was his, and in that moment of sheer, mind-shattering terror, I swear it was mine.

""Hello.""

I stumbled back from his doorway, my legs giving way, and scrambled down the stairs on my hands and knees, the splinters of the old wood digging into my palms. I haven’t been up since.

I didn’t hide. I didn’t run. I called the care company again, my voice a hysterical wire. ""He's out of bed! The ventilator is off and he's on the floor! He's moving!""

The triage nurse was a recorded message of calm. ""Mr. Franklin, without a physiological alert from the V60, we cannot dispatch an emergency team. Myoclonic jerks can be violent. He may have fallen. You should reposition him.""

""He spoke! He looked at me!""

""Reflexive vocalization is not uncommon. Please consult the pamphlet we provided on caregiver stress.""

I slammed the phone down. My next thought was the police. But what would I say? *My vegetative brother is crawling around his room?* They’d commit me. They’d take Leo away, and my parents would never forgive me. I failed to protect him once, by not being there the day he fell. I couldn't fail again. I had to fix this. I had to wait it out. He would exhaust himself. He would stop. This was my responsibility.

So I stayed in the kitchen. It was the strategic center of the house. The back door was ten feet away. The phone was on the wall. I had a clear line of sight to the staircase. I was not hiding; I was standing my ground. I was guarding him from whatever this was, and guarding the world from him.

The dragging continued from above. For an hour, it traced a path from his room to the top of the stairs. A slow, deliberate mapping of territory. And now it has stopped.

A new sound has begun.

A wet, rhythmic slap. A hand, I think, palm flat and slick, smacking down on the top wooden step to find purchase. A moment of strained silence. Then the thick, gritty drag of a dead weight following after it.

*Slap.* (a pause, the sound of tendons straining)  
*Drrrrrrrrag.* (the sound of denim and flesh over rough-hewn wood)

*SLAP.* (closer now, on the second step)  
*DRRRRRRAG.* (longer, heavier, a bone within the mass cracking softly under the strain)

My resolve is gone. The strategic center is a trap. I am frozen here, the professional caretaker utterly dismantled, leaving only a terrified child. The coffee pot on the counter has started to vibrate with the impact of each movement. A fine tremor runs through the table under my elbows.

*SLAP.* (The third step. It’s so close.)  
*DRRR—* The drag is interrupted by a sickening, wet snap. A sound that speaks of things tearing that should never be torn.

The fourth step from the top just creaked.

The sound was exactly the same as it’s always been. A G-flat of worn pine and settling nails. A homely, familiar sound that now feels like the tolling of a bell.

It’s on the landing.

My brother is coming down.

My phone has no service. The screen shows a stark, empty triangle where the bars should be. I tried to call 911 and the call failed. The landline is dead, too—a hollow, plastic dial tone that feels like a mockery. Maybe the storm last night took out a line. Or maybe it’s something else. The router’s lights are all dark. But my laptop, with its dying battery, still has a draft of this post open. This text box is the only thing in the world that still feels connected to anything. It’s my flare gun into the void. If I stop typing, the silence will eat me.

*Slap. Drag.*  
It’s on the stairs now. The fifth step? The sixth? I can’t remember how many there are. I’ve lived here my whole life and I can’t remember how many steps are on my own staircase. I think it’s thirteen. But that can’t be right, that’s too many, isn’t it?

The coffee pot. I just looked at it. The power is out, but it’s still warm. How is it still warm? I unplugged it hours ago. I think I did. Did I?

I have to be clear. I have to make you understand. He’s coming down and I can’t remember if I fed him today. Did I log his meds? The binder is upstairs. I can’t go up there. The V60 is dead but it’s blinking. I saw it blinking from the hallway. Green. Green. Green. Like a heartbeat.

*Slap. Drag.*  
Closer.

He said “Hello” and his jaw was broken. But when I ran, I looked back and he was smiling. I think he was smiling. His mouth was a straight line. No, it was a curve. A wide, dark O. I can’t remember. I can’t remember his face before the accident anymore. I try to picture him laughing and all I see is that dark O.

The dragging has stopped. Why has it stopped?

It’s on the landing. The landing is only ten feet from this kitchen. There is no door between us.

I can hear a new sound. A wet, clicking sound. Like a tongue against the roof of a mouth. Or like… like knuckles cracking.

He’s not dragging anymore.

He’s standing up.

I can hear the weight shifting. The floorboards in the hall are groaning under a full, standing weight. That’s not possible. His muscles have atrophied. He hasn’t stood in three years. The doctors said he would never…

One footstep. Then another. Slow, shuffling, but firm. Balanced.

He’s walking.

The fourth step creaked. But he’s already past the steps. He’s in the hall. So why did I hear it again?

I have to post this. The battery is at 3%. I have to let someone know. My name is Claude Franklin. My brother Leo was in a vegetative state. I think I might have forgotten to give him his Clonazepam last night. Or was it the night before? The log is wrong. The dates are all wrong in the binder. I saw it this morning. It says today is August 10th. But that’s the day the mimicry started. Isn't it?

The footsteps have stopped.

He’s just on the other side of the kitchen doorway. I can see a shadow stretching across the linoleum of the hall. It’s long and thin. It doesn’t look like Leo.

The shadow’s head is turning towards me.

I can’t look up. I can’t.

The laptop fan is whirring, it’s so hot. It’s the only sound.

“Hello,” he says. His voice is right here. In the room with me. It doesn’t sound hollow anymore. It sounds like mine.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

A few things about me and what I’m looking for

- I run an AI startup and I’m super connected in the Korean startup scene. If you’re into startups, design, or software dev, we’ll probably have a lot to talk about.

- but it’s okay if you’re not! I’m into a lot of different topics like music, food, travel whatever, so we’ll still get along just fine.

- If you’re learning Korean, I’m actually pretty good at teaching, so I can help a lot.

- I’m currently on a break from university, so I have a lot of college friends. If you’re a student too, we’ll probably get along easily.

- Open to all genders, though since I’m male, I might feel slightly more comfortable with guys.

- I love good food and coffee. I know tons of great spots in Seoul, so if you’re around, we could grab something together. (Korean pubs and bars are also great if you’re into that!)

I woke up the next morning in a cold sweat. Nightmares plagued me all night. I couldn’t get that image of Clara out of my mind. There was just no way she was a part of this. She would never want to hurt me, or so I thought.

The cabin was dark, not yet illuminated by the morning light. The woods outside slowly began to stir with life, announcing the sun’s ascent. The fire had died hours ago, leaving the room cold and shrouded in shadows. My arm was throbbing from where I’d slammed into the concrete during my struggle with Tom, an injury I barely remembered.

‘Was it all just a dream?’ I asked myself in my mind.

The adrenaline had wrapped a thick fog around the images in my mind, but I could still see Clara. I thought about Tom’s words, about the sacrifice, and why they needed the ritual. I wasn’t sure yet if what he told me was true, but I felt deep in my gut that this town had a very dark heartbeat, full of sinister practices and malevolent traditions. It was so easy for him to speak those words, but it felt nearly impossible to accept what they meant. There was just no way that it could be true. I knew what I saw was real, but my mind wouldn’t let me fully believe it. I needed to know more.

Clouds began forming on the horizon, blocking the sun’s warm embrace. A pale grey light poured into the cabin, making it feel colder inside. I sat up on the couch and grabbed my clothes. Taking stock of my surroundings, I noticed that the cabin was eerily quiet. Looking out of the main window, I could see that a light snow had started falling.

“Fantastic… That’s just what I need right now.” I said sarcastically.

I finished putting my boots on and sat for a moment, listening closely for any movement inside the cabin.

“Tom?” I called out. “Tom, are you here?”

There was no answer. I walked over to the far side of the cabin and knocked once on his door before pushing it open.

“Tom?” I asked as I stepped into the room.

There was no sign of him. His bed was made neatly with his clothes folded on the dresser. The black robe was nowhere to be seen, but then again, I wasn’t trying to find it either.

I forced myself out into the snow and the brutal cold. The town of Indigo Falls wasn’t the friendly haven I’d hoped for anymore. It had now begun tightening around me, pressing its entire weight down on me.

I took a deep breath and stepped off the porch, the cold air burning my lungs. There was no sign of Tom outside either, so I began retracing my steps from the night before as I set off on foot towards town.

I made my way down to where I left my truck. Thankfully, it was still sitting there untouched. I hopped in and started it up, sitting for a moment to debate my next move. I warmed my hands on the air vents as I considered my options. The smart thing would be to go home, get some warmer clothes, and hunker down for a while. The stupid thing would be going to see Clara. It didn’t take long to make up my mind as I threw the bronco in gear and headed toward the diner. I had to see her.

By the time I’d arrived at the diner, the snow had picked up, cloaking everything in an eerie white fog. I could feel that there was something wrong immediately. The parking lot was completely vacant, except for one car. Clara’s car stuck out like a sore thumb in the middle of the eerily deserted town. I’d never known this place to be empty, ever. Even in the blinding rain and snow, the loyal patrons lined the stools and chairs. It was of no concern to me, though, once I saw her car. Crowded or not, Clara was here, and I desperately needed to talk to her.

The bell jingled as I entered, giving away my presence. She was standing behind the counter as always, wiping the counter with an old white rag. She saw me and smiled, but it wasn’t like she usually did. This time her greeting felt cold and disjointed, as if she knew something was up with me.

She didn’t say a word as I approached. Her gaze drifted past me, as if searching for something or someone else. I shook off the cold and snow and walked over to sit down at the bar.

“I have to know,” I said quietly after she poured my coffee. “Why me? Why do they want me?”

She set the mug down with trembling hands. She knew that the veil had been lifted. She could no longer keep the truth hidden.

“You’re not from here. That’s enough.” She said, looking down at the counter.

Her eyes seemed to cloud over as if she could cry at any moment.

“But why, Clara? Fucking tell me!” I urged, slamming my fist against the bar top. “Tom told me everything. I know about all of it. The ritual, the sacrifice, the fucking “young and healthy” vampire bullshit. Tell me what is going on!”

I could see my words cut into her like a knife. Every word felt like I was lashing her with a whip. Seeing my words dig into her hurt me more than I thought it would. I calmed down and composed myself. I knew I wouldn’t get the answers I needed if I let my anger get the best of me.

“I just… I just need to hear it from you. Please, Clara.”

Without saying a word, she bowed her head and began crying softly into her hands.

“Fuck you, Elias! Fuck you! Why did you even come here!?” She screamed, sobbing uncontrollably and sending tears flying across the bar top. “None of this would have happened if you had never come here. It’s all your fault!”

She lashed out at me, tears flowing down her face. It hurt me to see her this way, but it also confused me. I just told her that I knew what was going on in town and asked for answers, and now she was dodging me. Her tears took me off the topic completely, derailing my hunt for answers, at least from her.

I was not expecting such an emotional response from her. I had seen her praying in the middle of that circle, chanting with all those people. Why was she crying about it now?

“What do you mean? I asked, desperate now, “I didn’t know about any of this! How is this my fault? I don’t want to fucking die, Clara. Why would I choose to come here to get murdered by a fucking cult, huh!? Answer me that one!”

“Just go, Elias. Get out!” She screamed, pointing to the front door.

She covered her face, sobbing into her hands, and ran into the kitchen.

“Clara, wait!” I yelled as I gave chase.

She slammed the door right before I could make it, locking herself in. I could hear her on the other side, sobbing uncontrollably, like she was hyperventilating.

“Clara, please, I need you! I can’t do this alone, I… I’m scared,” I slammed my fist into the door as tears fell from my eyes and onto the brown linoleum floor.

She didn’t say another word, choosing to torture me instead. All I could hear were her muffled cries through the thick metal door.

Discouraged, broken, and still looking for answers, I left her. I was still in trouble, and no matter how much I hated that I hurt her, I still needed to know what was going to happen to me. I decided to keep searching.

As I pulled out of Harlan’s, I felt fear start to grip me. I had gotten the confirmation from Clara, even if she didn’t say it exactly. I needed more help if I was going to make it out of this place. I couldn’t do it alone.

I tried to approach the townsfolk, looking for anyone who would talk. Each person that I tried to interact with felt more distant. The walls became thicker, and the silence felt more dangerous with each passing second.

I spotted Mrs. Hargrove as I walked through town. She was an older woman who ran the flower shop. She was always so sweet and welcoming to me.

“Maybe she knows something,” I muttered to myself. Either way, I knew I had to ask.

A tremor ran through the shop as I entered. Every bloom seemed to wilt under a sudden chill as if death had entered alongside me. Her gaze, sharp as shattered glass, locked onto mine as I crossed the threshold. Her hands, gnarled and bone-white, twitched and shook as she forced a raspy whisper from her lips.

“Oh, Elias, there you are.” She said in that same sweet voice, “You can't outrun it, you know. You never will. You will not deny us our gift.""

Before I could respond, she turned and shuffled toward the back of the store, her chilling warning hanging in the air like a cloud of smoke. She closed the door behind her and locked it, leaving me to stand alone in the middle of the store. It seemed I only had one friend in this town, if I could even call him that.

The sun was setting as I drove back to Tom’s place, hoping that he would be back there by now. I pulled into his driveway to see him sitting in a rocking chair on the porch, drinking a glass of whiskey. I put the bronco in park and stepped out. A million things flew through my head, the question of whether he would help me chief among them.

“I see you finally decided that I was telling the truth.” He said, rocking back and forth with a smirk.

“What choice do I have?” I asked.

Tom gave a sharp, subdued chuckle in response as he set his whiskey glass on the banister. He leaned forward in his chair, stopping just before he stood up to speak.

“You don’t.” He said, eyebrows raised, now with a full smile stretched across his face.

He stood up out of the chair, grabbed his glass, and waved his hand toward the door, ushering me inside.

“Come on in, son.”

Tom became my only anchor. Over the next several days, he showed me the hidden paths, the old symbols carved into tree trunks, sigils of protection, and others warning of what came if the sacrifice failed. He spoke of nights when the townsfolk’s faces twisted into something unrecognizable, their eyes burning with hunger and hate.

“The closer we get to the end of winter without a sacrifice,” he said, voice low and urgent, “the darker they become. Not just angry, but savage.”

He bowed his head and closed his eyes, preparing himself for something he wasn’t ready to say out loud.

“And son, it’s gonna start affectin’ me soon.” He said, his words fragile and strained. “I’ve tried to do this type of thing once before, about the time I got back from the war, and it almost killed me.”

His eyes clouded over as he looked at me, a calm seriousness filling his voice.

“You’re gonna have to do exactly as I say, or you’ll never make it out of here, understand?” He asked, looking to me for confirmation.

“I understand,” I said, not believing I really did.

Who was I to understand any of this? I was just an ordinary guy dealing with extraordinary problems.

The days went by in frightening silence. People stopped going to the diner, and all of the stores were empty. The town playground lay dormant, devoid of children’s laughter, killing any small piece of humanity this place still had. The place had turned into an apocalyptic nightmare. The only place I felt even remotely safe was my old rickety cabin, in which I could at least get away for a bit.

One night, a bone-chilling howl shattered the stillness. It wasn’t a wolf, nor any animal I knew. The sound was too primal and deep, made from something dark and awful. It echoed through the trees, seeping into the wood of the cabin, daring me to look.

The pressure finally got to me. I peered out my window, heart hammering in my chest, not sure I wanted to see what made the noises. Deep within the forest, I could see figures moving between the trees, jumping from one to the next. Shadowed shapes appeared in the moonlight, their limbs jerky and unnatural. As they swayed back and forth, I caught glimpses of their faces. They were pale, and their eyes were wild and black, filled with something that wasn’t of this earth. They looked desperate, hungry for their next meal.

They circled my cabin all night, screaming and yelling into the night. Tom had warned me that they would come. The townsfolk had begun to descend upon me, their bodies now turned to beasts in the night. I opened my bedside drawer and grabbed my revolver, holding it tightly to my chest as I lay in bed. I leveled the sights on the front door and waited, prepared for them to bust down the door at any second.

Thankfully, they didn’t. They stayed just outside the wood line all night. When morning finally came, I dropped the revolver on the bed and fell backwards, barely catching the pillow with my head. I didn’t sleep at all. The sounds of the townsfolk pacing around the cabin continued well into the day, but now sounded human, as if they had shed their beastly form along with the dark of the night.

It was just past noon when it finally subsided. My body trembled from the fear and cold. I never lit my fire in fear that the townsfolk might take that as an invitation to come in. The constant stress had produced a pool of sweat that soaked my bed, freezing on the sheet from the unrelenting cold. I had seldom ever thought about what hell might be like. I always imagined fire and brimstone, but now I knew that hell wasn’t like that at all. All of the books I’d read were wrong. Hell was cold… Full of snow and ancient trees.

The days blurred together. Sleep became a stranger. Every creak in the cabin or rustle outside felt like a threat. I carefully moved around the house so as not to alert them. I ended up patterning them. There were days when they were there all day and night, and then there were days that they never came. I used those days to my advantage, sneaking out into town for supply runs.

I stored my revolver in the Bronco’s glovebox in case I ran into a situation that I couldn’t run away from. They had blocked the entrance to town with six destroyed cars, preventing me from trying to escape. I was honestly too afraid to try.

The next supply day, I drove into town to grab food and supplies from the abandoned stores. If I were going to be stuck here until spring, I might as well be prepared. I was used to just grabbing food here and there, but I had pushed the boundaries on each run to see what I could get away with. I went store to store, stealing what I needed. There was nobody to stop me. They were all trying to kill me anyway.

All I could think about was Clara and how she was changing, too. She had become something else, unrecognizable from that first breakfast at Harlan’s. She was no longer going into work. My calls to her went unanswered. I was beginning to give up on ever seeing her again, until the night I pushed things too far on a supply run.

I had just performed a short supply run and was walking home through the woods, taking a new, shorter path back to the cabin. I used the darkness to my advantage, keeping to the shadows and covering any tracks that could lead them to me. A light snowfall added to my cover as I crossed Grist Mill Road, making sure that nobody was staking out the cabin’s entrance. I was almost back to the safety and warmth of the cabin. I stepped out of the woods and onto the path leading up the hill. As I did, I heard footsteps crunching through the snow behind me, followed by a voice.

“Elias.”

The voice was soft, Familiar. I knew it all too well.

I turned around, clicking my flashlight on, catching the face of the person who called my name. It was Clara. She stood there, face pale, lips pressed tight as if she were about to break down right in front of me and weep.

“I’m sorry,” she whispered.

Her voice pierced the cold night air, slowing time to a crawl. The snowflakes seemed to float in mid-air, forcing me to remember her beautiful face. I hadn’t seen her in so long. I had given up on seeing her again.

My heart jumped. She was all I had ever wanted, and even then, I still did. I let hope re-enter my mind for the first time in what felt like decades.

“Clar…”

Before I could even mutter her name, she lunged at me, arms outstretched, snarling like a wild animal. I barely dodged the knife she wielded, its blade catching the beam of the flashlight in its deadly glare.

“Clara! Why!?” I yelled, gasping and stumbling back.

“They need you,” she said, eyes lifeless and hollow. “It’s the only way, Elias.”

My heart broke as the woman I trusted, the only light in this shadowed town, had gone dark.

She paused for a moment, allowing me to study her face. She had tricked me. The beautiful face I once knew was all a façade, a twisted lie. Her eyes were bloodshot, her skin a sickly pale white. She looked like she had aged 10 years since I’d last seen her. She breathed heavily through gritted teeth, her breath rhythmically producing misty, white vapor that swirled into the cold night.

Before I could say another word, she screamed, lunging at me once more. I quickly jerked to my right, feeling the breeze from the blade passing just over my left shoulder. The momentum took her past me, sending her tumbling into a snow drift. She laughed softly as she pushed herself up to her knees.

“This is a fun game, Elias. You know you will never make it out of here. Why don’t you just let me take care of this? I’ll make it quick, I promise.” She said, laughing and smiling maniacally.

I turned and ran, adrenaline screaming through my veins. I was too far away to reach the cabin or the revolver in the Bronco. I was on foot and weaponless. I had to find a way to lose her in the forest and get back home.

Branches clawed at my skin as I pushed through the underbrush. I busted through a bramble bush and into a clearing that split into two directions. Feeling her presence growing close, I ran down the left path toward a black mass that looked like a grove of trees. As I ran into them, my foot caught a root, sending me tumbling to the ground at the base of a tree. As I hit the ground, I heard a loud snap, which instantly sent a sharp pain shooting through my wrist, all the way up to my elbow.

“Fuck me!” I muttered through gritted teeth, subduing the urge to yell.

My right wrist had shattered from the impact, now throbbing with searing pain. I could feel the bone pushing against the skin as I pulled off my glove to assess the damage. I withdrew my trembling hand, which had already started to swell and turn a deep red. I tried to force my fingers to curl, hoping to preserve whatever function I had left.

The forest grew deathly quiet as the adrenaline began to fade, the pain in my wrist growing worse by the second. Behind the unnerving silence, slow, steady footsteps arose, steadily crunching down the snow-covered trail.

They continued to get closer. I forced myself not to look at my broken wrist. For now, the pain had to wait. I was still being hunted.

“Eli, honey, come out please.” She said playfully.

I pressed my back against the tree as hard as I could, trying to shrink into the bark itself, every breath held tight in my chest. I watched as she walked past me. As she came into view, I saw her demeanor shift. The predatory aspect had faded, now replaced by something disturbingly childish. She began acting like a child, her lower lip jutting forward in an exaggerated pout, as if she had been denied a toy.

“You’re hurting me, Eli. Please come out.” She whimpered, her voice soft and trembling, full of sorrowful deceit.

She was hunting me. There was no doubt left, no more room for denial. I had never felt fear like this, so raw and pure. My heartbeat raced at the sight of her, replenishing the waning adrenaline in my veins and numbing the pain of my shattered wrist.

As she passed through an opening on the trail, I could see her face clearly. She was smiling widely as she walked, humming a tune I couldn’t recognize. She clutched the knife as she walked, her hands trembling around it from the cold, or perhaps the thrill of the chase… I couldn’t tell.

I stayed frozen in place until she drifted farther down the trail, her humming fading into the hazy darkness. Only when it finally disappeared altogether, and I could no longer see her silhouette through the snow-covered trees, did I dare to make my move. I slipped from behind the tree and rushed back the way I’d come, trying to follow my boot tracks through the snow. I had almost made it back to the road when I saw a flickering orange glow bobbing its way up the hill toward me. It was a lantern.

My stomach dropped. For a split second, my racing mind convinced me that it was her, that she had somehow doubled back and gotten the drop on me. Where the lantern came from, I wasn’t sure, but in that moment, I didn’t care either. I dropped into the snow for cover as the light swayed closer.

A silhouette finally began to take shape behind it, broad-shouldered and familiar, too large to be Clara. It was Tom.

“Tom,” I whispered. “Psst, Tom. Over here.”

The lantern swung quickly in my direction, its flame bathing the snow in trembling orange light.

“Elias? Holy shit, son, I thought you were dead.” Tom breathed, relief filling his voice.

“Not yet,” I muttered, still half buried in the snow. “Clara is after me, though, and my wrist is fucked up pretty bad.”

Tom stepped closer, lowering the lantern.

“Come on outta there, I got a place you can hole up in for a while… at least until we can figure out a plan.” He said in return.

He dragged me out of the ditch with surprising strength for an older man and guided me into an old, abandoned barn that stood at the edge of the woods. The door groaned as he forced it open, ushering me inside.

“Hide,” he whispered, tearing off a strip of his sweater and wrapping it around my bleeding hand.

He wrapped it tightly before pulling a small glass bottle from his coat pocket. He bit down, quickly popping the cork, and poured the bitter substance over the makeshift bandage. His movements were rushed and frantic. When I looked up, his eyes were wide, not with fear, but with a concerned focus.

“They’re comin',” he whispered, peering at me through a crack in the barn door. “I fear this might be the last night I’ll be able to help you. You’ve got to put a stop to this, Elias. Get the hell outta here.”

“But how?” I asked, panting from the chase as he pulled the door shut.

Yes. Will I spend thatttt much? No. Will I appreciate the machine to justify the bread? Not yet.

Whats important to me in a machine? Well quite honestly I don’t know! I’m totally willing to waste a bag of coffee or bags to get that perfect shot. I really enjoy latte, cappuccino, etc.

So here I am. I have been eyeing the Rocket Espresso Apartamento TCA. Why? Well it looks cool to start off. The steam seems to be very strong from the videos I have seen. Flow control seems cool, don’t know how I’ll use it. You get the idea, I have no clue beyond the basics of espresso. Weigh, grind, distribute, tamp, pull, froth milk, drink and toilet. 

For the grinder, Niche Zero seems to be no frills and gets the job done. Will last a lifetime. I really only drink this medium roast as this coffee roaster around the corner from me. Cannot stand light roasts. Is this a good option? Conical burr I heard is great for medium and darker roasts.


Ultimately, $3k budget seems healthy. Im a buy it for life person. Want to pull consistently good shots and make my daily dirty chai.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1pipgtx,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1pipgtx/i_accidentally_got_involved_in_some_candy/,I accidentally got involved in some candy operation at school PART 6,"So the website was basically running itself at this point.
Orders nonstop. Kids from random schools talking to me like we’d been friends for years. I couldn’t walk anywhere without someone trying to slip me a dollar or whispering a code word. It was kinda funny… and kinda exhausting.

But then things started getting shaky.

First problem:
A teacher — Mr. Hall, the history one with the coffee breath — started acting weird around me. He’d stop me in the hallway and ask random questions like:

“You’re popular these days, huh?”
or
“I’ve noticed a lot of students carrying… colorful snacks. You wouldn’t know anything about that, right?”

He said it like a joke, but his eyes weren’t joking.
He’d stare way too long.
Like he was putting pieces together.

Second problem:
Someone started selling candy at Westbrook.
Not one of our guys.
Just some random dude who made his own cheap website with ugly neon buttons and started undercutting our prices. Word got back to me fast.

Leo freaked out, of course.
He kept saying, “Bro, we gotta shut him down,” like we were in some mafia movie, but really all we did was watch his site and complain about him being annoying.
Still, it made things messy. Kids started comparing prices like we were Walmart or something.

Third problem:
The website was getting TOO big.
Like, too many orders to handle.
I was spending half of lunch writing names and meeting spots in my notes app like I was running an actual business. And we were getting close to the end of the year, which made everything feel unstable. Teachers were more alert, schedules were weird, and I swear every hallway echo sounded like someone saying my name.

And that’s when I met this kid — Mason.

He wasn’t some sketchy guy or anything. He was chill. A sophomore.
Kinda quiet, always listening more than talking. He showed up to one of our drops at the perfect time, helped distract a group of kids so we could finish, and then afterwards he just looked at me and said:

“If you ever need extra hands, I’m good at staying unnoticed.”

I didn’t know if I should hire him or avoid him forever.

The way he said it felt serious… but also kinda smart.
Part of me thought he’d be the perfect extra person to help, especially with the rival seller and Mr. Hall sniffing around.
But another part of me wondered if adding someone new this late in the year was asking for trouble.

While all this was happening, things with my girlfriend were getting deeper too.
Like, not wild or anything, but real.
We talked more — long talks, the type where you lose track of time. She trusted me with stuff she never told anyone, and I did the same without even thinking about it. We’d sit together after school, and she’d lean into me, tracing little lines on my arm while I rambled about the website being chaos. She’d kiss my cheek or sit pressed up against me during study hall, and it all felt natural. Not rushed. Just… us.
And honestly? She made all the stress feel lighter. When everything else was going crazy, she was the one calm thing I actually liked coming back to.

But end of the year was creeping up fast.
A rival seller.
A suspicious teacher.
A website that might explode any second.
And now Mason, offering to “help.”

I didn’t know what to do next — whether to expand, shut things down, or bring him in.

But I knew one thing:

Whatever was coming next ik
it wasn’t going to be boring.

Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Chapter 1

“Motherfucker” I mumbled under my breath as a drop of rain extinguished the flame on my very last cigarette.

I flicked my drenched, half-smoked cigarette into the cold, wet dirt. second half of my final under way; second half of failure.  I un-popped the collar of my worn-out, ripped leather jacket and made my way out of the large, cold November droplets, through the hall and  back into the classroom,  awkwardly passing through the other students that looked like they were doing just fine on the test and watching most of them point their faces away in disgust from my ashtray scented coat. I felt the little bit of nicotine leaving my body. One more puff and I would have been ok- been able to focus but now I’m back to light-headed and jittery.

How the hell am I going to focus on this test now?

The what is the powerhouse of the cell? I can’t remember.

The mita-something-mita… it’ll come to me.

The pit in my stomach started circulating into a tornado as I finally plopped myself down into my old, creaky wooden desk; pen in hand ready to fail the rest of this test.  A huge inhale through my nostrils as I prepared to answer the questions before me- questions I didn’t remember ever learning the answers to. My mind was a complete blur.

The mita- God what the hell is it?!

I can’t focus.  My mind empty. The nicotine cravings rushing their way through my body. I wanted out of this classroom. I had plans to grab a drink with one of my classmates after the exam as a way to destress after all the hours and days of futile cramming for this test but instead I just wanted to go back to my dorm and zone out with my roommate, Lucas- or be with my girlfriend, Jessica, who lives just across campus; but mostly, I wanted to smoke the other half of that cigarette.

When all was going to hell, Jessica was my rock. When my anxiety would send me into a whirlwind, her calming voice was enough to extinguish the wildfire of distressed thoughts blazing through my mind.  On top of that, she was absolutely gorgeous; beautiful dark brown hair and glowing, emerald green eyes that you could just get lost in- I could stare into her eyes for days.  Jessica definitely made what was mostly a terrible college experience, bearable.

I stared down at my exam, deeply, as if the answers would just reveal themselves.  I wrote down “mita” as the answer to the first question, hoping to get at least partial credit.  I struggled my way through the rest of the test; my head hurting more and more with each question.  I finally gave up and handed my test in to my professor. He stroked his graying goatee “finally finished Mr. Testa!” He exclaimed as he took the crinkled paper from my hands.  I scanned around the classroom; I hadn’t realized that I was the only one still there. I gave him a nod and a half smile with a shrug and showed myself out and made my way through the hall and back into the cold rain.

The drops of rain were now getting larger and heavier.  I combed my fingers through my long black sopping wet hair and out of my face. I popped my collar, pushed my shoulders up and shivered my way back to the dorms.

I was looking forward to a hot shower and just spending the rest of the evening with my roommate, Lucas while I waited for Jessica to finish class. We would hang out, smoke some weed, cook some ramen on the hotpot that he brought from home and I’d forget that damn test had ever happened.

I finally made it to the dorms. I passed my room and went straight to the showers in a tired haze. I made my way in and let the hot water soak my cold body.  It was just what I needed.  I wrapped myself in a towel and made my way down the hall to my room. As I exited the communal bathroom, I felt relieved. It was as if I washed away all of the anxiety and despair from the day with that shower.

I got to the door of my dorm and heard loud moaning on the other side. I really hoped my roommate wasn’t blasting porn in there. At this point I didn’t care, I just wanted to get inside and space out for the next hour or so. As I burst through the door to my dorm, it hit me like a ton of bricks- “chondria!” I called out “The mitochondria is the power house of the – Jessica?!”

I just stood there, mouth agape as I saw them in bed together. They just looked back at me in a shocked silence; Jessica’s piercing green eyes burning a hole through my soul. The seconds of silence felt like hours. I was frozen still as if there was an external force keeping me from moving a single muscle. I wasn’t even able to blink.  “Huh-how? Huh when?!” were the profound words that I finally managed to muster. “We uh- we- we thought you were going out.” Lucas stuttered moving his eyes off of me while still on top of my girlfriend. He quickly got off of her and covered himself with a pillow. “Look man, I’m really sorry.” He said while staring at the floor- a mixture of remorse and embarrassment plastered across his face.

I wanted to scream, yell, punch Lucas in his face, call my girlfriend- (I guess ex- girlfriend) every name in the book and let her know just how much she hurt me but instead I said nothing, put my head down and slinked out the door and into the hall. I slowly walked back down the hall in my towel with my soaking wet clothes balled up in front of me- devastated. I made my way back to the bathroom to change back into my wet clothes. The short walk felt like a mile as I processed what I had just witnessed. I put my jeans on and just plunked myself down on the cold, hard bathroom tile and put my head in my hands. My thoughts were racing. How the hell could they do that to me? How am I going to bring my grades up with only a month left in the semester? And what the fuck am I sitting in? I noticed my already damp pants getting even wetter as I sat in a puddle on the floor. I let out a sigh and got up off of what I hoped was shower water and finished getting dressed. The lump in my throat turned into a boulder as I replayed the heart-wrenching scene in my mind over and over again. I needed a cigarette. I needed a drink. I needed dry pants.

I bought a pack of cigarettes and made my way to a bar called The End which was the last establishment of the small strip of bars and restaurants near campus. I was hoping it would be empty where I could just sit at the bar in silence, wallow and drink myself into a stupor.

No such luck. I pushed my way through the large crowd of people in the dark, purple hued drinkery and tried to get to the bar. I found an empty stool and put a hand up hoping to get the bartender’s attention until my arm got tired and I finally put it down and rested at the bar and put my head down.

“What are we drinking tonight?” the bartender asked as she finally made herself over to me. I lifted my head from staring deeply into the mahogany and met her gaze. She had long, black hair, dark brown eyes and full, red-painted lips. “Whatever’s on tap.” I said and she filled a pint glass and brought it over.  I chugged it down in a single gulp. “hit me again.”  She filled another glass and placed it on the bar in front of me.

“Rough night?” She asked dryly as she handed me my second beer.

“My girlfriend cheated on me”

“Wow that really sucks but I’m sure you’ll find som-“

“With my roommate. I caught them in bed together.”

“Shit.” she said, as she grabbed my glass off of the bar and poured it into the sink. “After the night you had beer isn’t going to cut it. I know just the thing.” She pulled out a different pint glass and started pouring multiple liquors into and capped it off with some club soda and cranberry juice. “This should do the trick. It’s our signature drink, ‘The Bloody End’; on the house”

“What’s in it?” I asked.

“Everything!” She called out as she walked over to help another patron at the bar.

As the night wore on the patrons at the bar began to filter out. I was about 8 Bloody End’s in and could barely hold myself up on my bar stool. I hadn’t said a single word to anyone but the bartender all night. I stared down at the black stained wood bar and poured drink after drink down my throat. The vision of the scene projected onto the bar top in which I fixed my gaze on an endless loop; getting more and more vivid with each drink.

The bar was completely empty at this point. I chugged down what was left of my drink. “I’ll take another” I slurred. She came over with a porcelain mug and placed it in front of me. The hot steam wafted toward my face and made me feel a little more awake and a little less lethargic. “What’s in this one?” I garbled. “Coffee, genius.” She said playfully and pushed the mug closer to me.

We talked for hours as the night wore on. She told me her name was Delilah. I learned that we grew up and lived in the same town actually not too far from each other. She told me that she was taking the semester off to do some volunteer work at our local hospital and figure things out. Talking to Delilah kept my mind off of my problems, my failing classes, my cheating girlfriend, my betraying roommate and the fact that I didn’t know what to do about any of it.

“You’re in no condition to walk home, come on, I’ll give you a ride.” She said with a smile and without hesitation I followed her out. We continued talking as she drove me home. We finally arrived at the parking lot of the dorms.  I thanked her for the ride, gazed into her brown eyes and reached in to give her a kiss. “Not tonight, Romeo.” She said as she pushed me away playfully and tousled my hair “Get some rest, I’m sure you’re going to have one hell of a hangover tomorrow!” I smirked and exited her car.

As I stood at the entrance of the building all of the weight that left my shoulders for the night came crashing back. The pit in my stomach worsened. It felt as though someone was punching me in the gut from the inside.  I realized that I had nowhere to go. I couldn’t go back to my dorm, I couldn’t go back to the cold, wet floor of the bathroom all night; I was out of options. Even though the alcohol was still floating around my head, I had to get home.

I fished for my keys and made my way over to my red 2002 Toyota Camry.  I got in, put the key in the ignition and tried to turn the engine over a few times with no luck. I banged my head on the steering wheel. I tried one more time with fingers crossed. Success! I pulled my way out of the parking lot and made the forty-five-minute drive back to my parents.

As I drove with my hands at ten and two, gripping the steering wheel and looking at the lines on the road through one eye and trying not to swerve, the reel of Lucas on top of Jessica continued to play vividly in my mind. My sorrow turned to anger. I felt a fire blazing in my stomach. Once I got home, I knew what I had to do. I had nothing left to live for; I had to end it all.

I fumbled with my keys and struggled to get them into the lock of the door. I made my way to the kitchen, grabbed a half-drank bottle of white wine out of the fridge and started to slosh it down. At this point my head was spinning as well was my stomach. I felt angry and elated, anxious and soothed all at the same time. My life fucking sucked but soon it would be over.

I reached in the drawer for the pain pills my father had been taking for his injured back and starting popping them into my mouth like Pez while taking swigs of the bottle of wine. I kept going until both bottles were completely empty. The room was getting hazy now. The lights began to dim. I felt nauseated and lethargic. I violently crashed to the ground knocking over the chair by the kitchen table. The now empty bottle of wine lay shattered on the ground. The lights getting dimmer now. As everything faded to black, I had a sweeping realization that hit me like a truck- I shouldn’t have done this! I wasn’t ready to die!

Chapter 2

I awoke to the sound of my mother frantically yelling for my father. “Oh my God! What happened?! Jacob! Get in here! Hurry!”

What was all the screaming about?

Was everything that happened earlier just a dream?

Did I live?

I felt fine; not even a lick of a hangover. I guess it really was just all a bad dream. Thank God! I felt relieved for a second but fixed my attention back on the frantic scene in our kitchen. I looked over at my mother. “Mom! What’s wrong? Why are you screaming? Why are you crying? Mom? Mom?!”

There’s was no response I just saw her hunched over something in the kitchen, next to a broken bottle. I called out to her again but she didn’t respond. She was too hysterical to even notice me standing over her. It was as if I wasn’t even there.  I tried tapping her on the shoulder and called out to her again. The pit in my stomach came back.

Why is she crying?

Who is she holding?

I peered over to get a better look and that’s when I saw it. I was frozen. The rock in my gut multiplying into a quarry. I couldn’t move. I stood there stunned as I looked at the person my mother was holding and crying over; it was me!

I felt dizzy and fell backward. I plummeted to the floor and grabbed my knees and started rocking back and forth.

It couldn’t be.

I couldn’t have actually-

“The ambulance is on their way.” My father choked out through sobs while pacing nervously. It was surreal watching my parents cry over my death. I stopped rocking and took a deep breath.

Get it together.

There’s got to be a way to wake up.

I walked past my mother and watched her shudder as I made my way over to my own corpse.  Maybe there was a way that I could get back into my body and everything would be fine. I tried lying next to myself then on top but nothing. I was still a corpse- or a spirit. I had no idea what I was.

Red and blue lights and sirens came blaring through our window as the ambulance screeched up to our front door. The EMT’s ran in hooked an apparatus over my nose and mouth and began pumping. After numerous attempts to revive me they hauled me away in the ambulance with my parents quickly following. I wanted to follow them, to scream to them. To let them know that none of this was their fault but I felt as if I couldn’t leave the room.

I began to pace nervously back and forth. Infidelity and failing classes were the least of my worries now.

What happens next?

Am I stuck here where no one can see me? Where no one can hear me?

I’ve never felt more alone; more helpless. I wasn’t sure what to do next, but I knew I had to get out of here. Maybe make my way to Paradise Hills Hospital which is where I’d imagine the EMT’s were hauling me off to; hopefully there and not the morgue. I had to get out of here and see what was going on with my body. Is this it? Am I doomed to this kitchen for all eternity?

I opened the back, kitchen door to make my exit. I had to find myself, to know what was going to happen.  I was met with an intense heat. It was much too hot for November; sweltering. I peered my head out of the doorway and took a look around. What I saw looked nothing like my neighborhood at all: No manicured lawns, no soccer moms yelling at their children, no one walking their annoying, yappy dogs around the block.

What I saw were buildings all around me with graffiti and broken windows, many of them on fire. A red smoky hue filled the atmosphere. What was this place?

I continued to peer out my door. As I scanned the buildings, I noticed a man standing near one of the fires in a long black cloak turned away from me. I called out to get his attention. “Hey! Where am I?!” He slowly turned to me, his eyes had no pupils, white as snow. He said nothing and let out a wide smile, showcasing his long, blackened teeth and slowly motioned for me to come to him.

I shuddered and slammed the door shut. At least it was safe in my kitchen. I backed away from the door and plunked down into the tile. I promised myself I would never open that door again. My parents would hopefully be home soon, and I would hear their conversation and know what was going on.

The kitchen door slowly creaked open.",1,1765329731.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1pipelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/NinjaLuxeCafe/comments/1pipelp/issues_with_single_basket_bottomless_portafilter/,Issues with Single Basket + Bottomless Portafilter,"Hi everyone,

Like a lot of people I got a good deal on this amazing coffee machine and am getting started on the world of home coffee with it

a couple things happened before this week's coffee disaster that prompted me to join and post on this SR

we ran out of the beans we had and purchased a new bag - kimbo espresso crema intensa - and so far (4 days) the machine suggestions have been very hit and miss - we haven't had two days of really good coffee in a row which was the norm with the previous beans (a fidalgo medium roast)

also in the meantime I got a bit excited and got some accessories to try and get more consistency and a better flavor - a WDT, a puck screen, a small mirror and a bottomless portafilter (which I got yesterday)

my wife likes her lattes light - so I usually prepared her shot with the single basket on the included spouted PF. since the beginning the puck of her coffee has been more loose - vs the pucks on mine that are very firm and leave very little residue on the basket

to try to address this I switched to the bottomless to try to see if there are issues with the puck prep. and i guess there are cause oh my god almost every shot I have poured with the bottomless one has been a wild adventure of coffee spraying all over my counter / person / dishes lol

i have tried finer and coarser grinds - machine originally suggested a 18 but I have tried a couple in between 15 and 23 without success and the only result variance being the pour time as sometimes I get a very fast coffee mist sprinkle (lol - under extraction for the coarser grind) vs a long af over extraction hose of coffee (i have counted 40s for the whole thing to stop dripping)

I am considering giving up on the single basket and secretly giving more caffeine to my wife (since the double seems to be a bit more consistent) - but wanted to see if someone has some tips for me before my wife decides this was a bad purchase



thanks for reading

Anyway I got a wholesale order inquiry from a business email I didnt recognize. When I looked into it turns out its literally the owner of that other shop. She wants to buy 50 units monthly because apparently her customers keep asking for scents similar to what I make and she cant replicate them.

I had no idea what to do at first, like is this weird? But then I thought about it and honestly the extra income would be great especially since I've been trying to save up for better equipment. The margins on wholesale arent amazing but its consistent money and I can probably negotiate better terms since she clearly needs my product.

We met for coffee and shes actually super cool. Turns out she specializes more in the decorative/aesthetic side and Im better at the actual scent blending. She even suggested we could do some kind of collaboration for holiday markets.",118,1765329694.0,smallbusiness,24,0.98,False

As title.

Recently dipped my toes into the espresso machine world with what I understand to be a good enough, cheap, starter model.

I'm having fun getting to grips with the machine and getting some joy with the pulls as someone that isn't a fanatic about esppresso (yet!). (Bottomless portafilter on its way as the next step then my eye on a better grinder!)

Only noticed today after having used the machine several hours earlier, the lights are off (I'd turned off the machine with button on right side of machine), plug switched on at the wall (UK/Ireland plug socket), that the grouphead was still warm.

Is this just a par for the course for the machine, a standby mode? I had it in mind that as an EU model electric stuff tends to go into some kind of minimal current draw situation.

If it is continuoulsy heating, any idea of the standby wattage? Mainly I'm just a lazy sod that tends to leave my kettle/toaster/coffee grinder etc plugged in with the plug switch on relying on the appliances own switching. But wondering if I need to get into the habit of switching this thing off overnight/if I head away for a few days.
