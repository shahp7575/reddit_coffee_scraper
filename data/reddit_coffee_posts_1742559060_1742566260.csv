1jgho32,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jgho32,How to get clear skin??,"I've struggled with my skin for about 6-7 years now and it's never been clear clear and not oily for a while. Definitely others have it worse than me, but I can't seem to fix what's going on. For the last 3 months I've been using cetaphil gentle cleanser and vanicream moisturizer I picked these because I thought they were very gentle and better ingredients. I used to use foaming cleanser from cerave which I do like but I found cetaphil to be rated better. I also used to use neutrogena hydroboost but that's kinda expensive and vanicream seems similar and better ingredients. I started using Paula's choice salicylic acid 2 months ago at night and then about 1 month ago started the ordinary azelaic acid in the morning then after I use abib sunstick and sometimes need to use powder over it because it makes me look like olive oil. Just the other day my cheeks starting getting more bumpy than usual and a bit itchy so I stopped using everything but my cleanser and moisturizer for now. Is this a good routine? How can I get rid of the redness and bumps that are on my skin and get less oily skin and less visible pores? I usually don't get much pimples but as you can see I'm breaking out right now.. not sure why. How can I finally get good clear skin better texture and skin that's not reddish and not worry about it getting super oily also? I eat fairly healthy barely any junk food and mostly drink water and occasionally a coffee with milk and sugar but throughout day basically just drink water and I eat good fruits veggies and salmon and other healthy foods etc",1,1742566114.0,DermatologyQuestions,1,1.0,False

1jghmbl,https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/1jghmbl/family_is_hard/,Family is hard,"So my family lives pretty far away from both of our families. My family is like 10hr away and hers is like 5hr so we don't seem them very often. I am stuck at a job right now that requires a lot of travel. I can't quit right now because of immigration reasons and my wife also works. Obviously there is a lot of pressure on my wife. It's not fair what I ask of her but hopefully soon I'll be able to get a job at home. 

My family in my opinion is kinda that ""two faced"" accepting of my family. They're very religious and I'm divorced (she had an affair) so we feel like they wish I was  with my first wife still even though thats moronic. Plus we feel like we are never the priority. I remember when my daughter was born(first grandchild) my parents always pestered for photos/videos/FaceTime. But the second my sister popped out her kid all of that stopped. It took them visiting one time and my daughter being terrified of them for them to realize they gave up on trying to get to know her for a while. Then on my daughter's first birthday it was only my dad and sister who came but they left a day early so they could have an extra day drive down to Florida for vacation, they spent time ""exploring"" our town without us and we had breakfast for everyone the one day but they showed up an hourish late because they had to find the good coffee shop. Her second birthday was basically my parents mostly helping my sister/niece. If they needed to go down for a nap they'd drive back to the hotel and come back a few hours later. If it was their bedtime everyone left. One time when they were visiting my daughter wanted to hold grandmas hand to the car but she wasn't paying any attention to her because she was helping my sister. My family has really only helped one time; my dad and uncle came down to help us when I got severely injured. 

My wife's family is very judgemental and this is what kinda brings this all to a head. So we visit them kinda frequently. They don't seem to understand that being in a pretty strange place without all of your things on an unfamiliar schedule can cause your kid/kids to act up. You push bedtime back a bit so they get more time with the grandparents, you don't eat on the same schedule and nap is always hard because it's a strange place. The other thing they judge us for is trying to relax when the grandparents are around.  My wife hardly gets a break so it's understandable to rely on the grandparents at least a lot and for me I normally work stupid hours when I'm gone plus sometimes it's off shift so sometimes when we visit I'm on a nightshift sleep schedule trying to just survive being up during the day. 

Recently my wife visited her family without me and it did not go well.  My In-laws watch my niece like 4 days a week all day so they obviously have a better relationship with my niece than they do with my daughter and my daughter is getting to the age where she's recognizing favouritism. Her dad always said he wanted to be Grandpa to us, but to my niece he's their ethnic word for grandpa. He speaks to my niece in his native tounge so my wife described it as ""our daughter thought they had a special language"". But her sister judges her immensely, she took my wife aside to have a conversation where essentially she said some pretty harsh things. It started as her telling my wife ""I wish I had kids first so you had someone to look up to"" , then went into how she's a bad mom for whatever reasons, she called my wife mentally unstable, told my wife she needs to quit and just travel around with me which wouldn't work and most importantly she told my wife that she RUINED our daughter. From our perspective this is a mom who has 6 actively involved grandparents a husband that works from home and both of them make really good money telling a mom who's just trying her best until I can be home permanently. Plus you add all the immigration news going around there's the thought in the back of my head ""what if I just get deported"". I also feel guilty because truly everything is my fault. My being gone is what is causing all of these issues and all I want is to just be home with my family but I truly can't right now. 

I'm just sick of people making us feel less than. Less than other people or less than adequate and what really makes me sad is it's my daughter's who're going to suffer. Ultimately at some point they going to be made feel inferior, unwanted and unloved by our parents and there's nothing we can really do.


TLDR Both sides of our family make us feel inadequate and my SIL told my wife she's a bad mom.

I want to be friends with someone who I can hang out with weekly maybe every sundays and saturdays. I dont really want a friend who I only talk to every few months (I have enough of those). I need people who I can meet regularly for my mental health as well as happiness.

A few more things. Any thoughts or comments?

For many years I got a black coffee and got a refill an hour later. Easy-peasy. It's always when I have work to do and need to get out of the house. I assume I should just bring my own cup for now on 

1) the time I learned the new policy, the store didn't have venti (hot) or tenta (cold) here cups. Is this normal? What is the policy if they don't have cups?

2) since it's been years since ordering a coffee here or to go made a difference (it ALWAYS came in a paper cup). What's the default? Would I have to specifically ask ""for here""?

3) I'm assuming it's related to the whole ""3rd place /customer space"" issue. But, have you noticed a rise in stolen ""here"" cups? Plus breakage? I don't believe it will save any money. 

4)  ""with my own cup""... Is another odd policy - now they want my germs near your work area?!? (If you need proof that COVID is history). Heck previously, they often wouldn't even touch my first cup to throw it away!

5) I never really understood how they knew what size my cup is... It could be 25 oz, 28 oz, have a false bottom and only be 16oz. I can't believe it's worth arguing with the customer, ""sorry sir, that tumbler doesn't look like it's 16 oz, it looks like it's at least 20 oz""...Thoughts? 

6) this is an oddity in California. By law, ""hot to-go beverages"" were carved out of the sales tax calculation. All beverages for HERE must be legally taxed.  I always assumed that's why they stopped HERE cups. Now, are they properly taxing HERE hot items? 

More technical stuff... , cold beverages (i.e., frappacinos) or warmed food (I e , egg bites) are always taxed. But cold TO-GO food (I e , a scone not warmed) needs not be taxed. So really, a HERE brewed coffee should be more expensive by the sales tax rate. [In truth, a store can tax everything but must forward whatever is collected to FTB. Hence, I suspect they included tax with every item regardless. So nothing changes....  Although,I did notice a TarBucks added tax!  Double tax? 🤔",1,1742565929.0,starbucks,0,1.0,False

I’m 26 and from the eastern US. Like everyone else here, I’m hoping to meet some new people! Ideally, I’d love to connect with someone who enjoys real conversations and wants to form a genuine connection. I crave that, and honestly, it’s been far too long since I’ve had it!

I like to think that I’m a pretty easygoing and talkative person, especially when I click with someone. I have a naturally optimistic, glass half full outlook on life. Unless we’re talking about coffee, in which case my cup is always half empty and I absolutely need of a refill. Sarcasm is practically a second language for me lol. But at the end of the day, I’m just someone who loves getting to know and spend time with those around me. 

When it comes to hobbies and interests, I have a ton, and I’m always open to learning about something new! I certainly don’t think we need to have all of the same interests. I absolutely love urban exploring (I have some many pictures of places I’ve visited) and road trips. If it involves discovering new places, you can count me in. I also have a huge fascination with genealogy and history in general. Historical architecture holds a special place in my heart. I love to learn, in every capacity. 

I’m also a big sports fan! Football and hockey are my favorites, but I can definitely appreciate a good game no matter the sport. I have been wanting to get into UFC more as well. It’s so fun to watch, but I know next to nothing about it currently. Maybe you can help me if it’s something you like? When I’m not out exploring or watching a game, I love being in the great outdoors (when the weather cooperates, of course). I like camping, hiking, kayaking, and basically anything else outside. Thank goodness that the weather is finally starting to look up!

I will admit that I’m a homebody most of the time. I love to curl up with a good book and just relax. However, I will admit I’ve been slacking on the reading recently. Pleaseeee feel free to give me suggestions. If I’m not reading, I’m probably watching a movie/TV. Some of my favorites are Star Wars, Harry Potter, Interstellar, Psycho, Black Mirror, The Twilight Zone, Breaking Bad, OITNB, and Shameless. I also have a mild obsession with houseplants (and trying desperately to keep them alive lol). I love baking, but by no means am I an expert. I like some video games, but I haven’t played in a while as I have somewhat lost interest. Although, I’m always down to watch someone else play and get way too invested in their game hahaha

Anyways, I’ve rambled for far too long. If anything I’ve said resonates with you, please reach out! I’d absolutely love to talk and get to know you. If not, I hope you find what you’re looking for!

## Why Choose a 64 oz Water Bottle?

Before diving into the specifics of the Hydro Flask 64 oz, let's address the elephant in the room: why such a large water bottle? The benefits are numerous, particularly for those with active lifestyles.

   **Reduced Refills:** Fewer trips to the water fountain mean more time focused on your activity, whether it's hiking, working, or simply enjoying your day.

   **All-Day Hydration:** A 64 oz water bottle provides ample hydration for extended periods, ensuring you stay energized and focused throughout the day.

   **Convenience:** Perfect for long hikes, camping trips, or busy workdays where refilling is inconvenient.

   **Motivation:** Seeing a larger water bottle can motivate you to drink more water throughout the day, contributing to better overall health.

## Hydro Flask 64 oz: A Closer Look

The Hydro Flask 64 oz is more than just a big water bottle; it's a well-engineered hydration solution designed to last. Here's a breakdown of its key features:

   **Construction:** Made with 18/8 pro-grade stainless steel, the Hydro Flask 64 oz is durable, resistant to rust, and free from BPA and phthalates. This ensures a pure, clean taste with no flavour transfer.

## Hydro Flask 64 oz: Key Considerations and Features in Detail

Let's dive deeper into aspects of the 64 oz Hydro Flask that users often consider during their purchase decision.

### Size and Weight

The hydro flask 64 oz dimensions are a important factor to consider. while it provides a large capacity, it's also a considerable bottle. Weighing around 2 pounds when empty, and substantially more when full, it may not be ideal for situations where weight is a major concern, such as lightweight backpacking.

Though, the hydro flask 64 oz weight is a trade-off for its capacity and insulation. If you prioritize having ample water on hand and keeping it cold all day,the weight might be a worthwhile compromise.

### Handle Options

While the original Hydro Flask 64 oz designs lacked a dedicated handle, many users have found the need for one especially when the bottle is full. Hydro Flask offers the Flex Cap with a handle. Moreover there are many third-party accessories on the market such as paracord handles and slings that can be added to the hydro flask 64 oz.These accessories offer convenient carrying solutions, especially when your hands are full. Some users find that a hydro flask 64 oz handle is an imperative addition.

### Cap Options

The cap you choose for your hydro flask 64 oz can greatly influence its usability. The wide mouth cap is ideal for quick gulps and easy cleaning, while the flex straw cap offers convenient, one-handed hydration. Consider your typical usage scenarios when selecting the right cap. Do you need quick hydration on the go, or do you prefer a more controlled sipping experience?

### Color Options

Style matters, and the Hydro Flask 64 oz doesn’t disappoint. Available in a wide array of colors, you can choose one that reflects your personal style. From classic shades like black and white to vibrant hues like hibiscus and pacific, there’s a hydro flask 64 oz color to suit every taste. Many opt for a hydro flask 64 oz limited edition color to stand out.

### Price

The hydro flask 64 oz price can be a barrier for some. It’s a premium water bottle,and the price reflects the quality of materials,construction,and insulation. It's essential to consider your budget and weigh the cost against the bottle's benefits and long-term durability. Look out for a hydro flask 64 oz sale to get a better deal.

### Where to Buy

The hydro Flask 64 oz is widely available, making it easy to purchase. You can find it at major retailers like Dick's Sporting Goods, specialty outdoor stores, and online marketplaces such as Amazon. If you are looking to purchase a hydro flask 64 oz near me, running a quick search online can show you all local vendor options. Checking Amazon is also a great option to see variety and look for a hydro flask 64 oz amazon deal.

## Hydro Flask 64 oz vs. Competitors

The Hydro Flask 64 oz isn't the only large-capacity water bottle on the market. Let's see how it compares to the competition, particularly Yeti.**Hydro Flask 64 oz vs Competitor (e.g., yeti):** Both Hydro Flask and Yeti are known for their high-quality insulated water bottles. Though, there are some key differences.Yeti bottles tend to be heavier and more expensive than comparable Hydro Flask models. Some users find the Hydro Flask's powder coat finish provides a better grip. Additionally, Hydro Flask offers a wider range of colors. When it comes to insulation, both brands perform exceptionally well, but user preferences vary.

**Hydro Flask 64 oz Alternatives:** If the Hydro Flask 64 oz is too expensive, or its weight is a dealbreaker, there are other options to consider. Brands like Takeya, Iron Flask, and Simple Modern offer similar large-capacity insulated water bottles at more affordable price points. though, these alternatives may not match the Hydro flask's level of insulation or durability. It depends on whether price or the brand recognition is worth a small value decrease.

## tips for Using and Maintaining Your Hydro Flask 64 oz

To get the most out of your Hydro Flask 64 oz, here are some helpful tips:

   **Cleaning:** Wash your Hydro Flask regularly with warm, soapy water. Use a bottle brush to clean the interior and a sponge to clean the exterior.For stubborn stains or odors, try a mixture of baking soda and water.

   **Avoid Dishwashers:** While some Hydro Flask caps are dishwasher safe, the bottle itself is best washed by hand to preserve the powder coat finish and insulation.

   **Don't Freeze:** While the Hydro Flask is designed for hot and cold liquids, freezing it can damage the insulation.

   **Store Properly:** When not in use, store your Hydro Flask with the lid off to allow it to air dry completely.

   **Accessorize:** Consider adding accessories like a handle, boot, or straw lid to enhance your Hydro Flask experience.

## Is the Hydro Flask 64 oz Right for You?

Ultimately, the decision of whether to purchase a Hydro Flask 64 oz depends on your individual needs and preferences. If you value durability, exceptional insulation, ample capacity, and a touch of style, the Hydro Flask 64 oz is an excellent choice. However, if you're on a tight budget or prioritize lightweight portability, there may be better alternatives.

Consider your lifestyle, hydration needs, and budget to make an informed decision.

## Beyond Water: Other Uses for Your Hydro Flask

While primarily designed for water, the Hydro Flask 64 oz can also be used for other beverages.*   **Iced Coffee:** Keep your iced coffee cold and refreshing for hours.*   **Smoothies:** Perfect for taking your favourite smoothie on the go.

   **Beer (growler):** The Hydro Flask 64 oz Growler is specifically designed to keep beer cold and carbonated.

   **Hot Tea or Coffee:** Enjoy hot beverages on chilly days.

## The Hydro Flask Half Gallon Water Bottle: Synonymous with Quality

The term ""hydro flask half gallon water bottle"" is often used interchangeably with ""Hydro Flask 64 oz."" This is as 64 ounces is equivalent to a half-gallon. Knowing this can help you broaden your search and find the best deals.

## to sum up:

The Hydro Flask 64 oz is a top-tier water bottle that delivers on its promises of durability, insulation, and style. If you're an active individual, a health enthusiast, or simply someone who wants to stay hydrated throughout the day, this bottle is worth considering. While the hydro flask 64 oz price point has been a barrier to some, if the benefits outweigh any of the barriers, and you can find it on sale, it may be worth it.Just remember to consider its size and weight when making your decision. With the right care and accessories, your Hydro Flask 64 oz will be a reliable hydration companion for years to come.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1jghh5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndia/comments/1jghh5v/how_can_anyone_be_middle_class/,How can anyone be Middle Class?,"
First of all, forgive me if my estimations are wrong. I understand that economy is not very great and people are having tough times, this thought has occurred in my mind since 3-4 days so I am asking this.

How can anyone be Middle Class?

I see people complaining that they can't afford Rs 250 Burger or Rs 100 Coffee and all.

If you have your own family home, then Rs 30,000 to Rs 40,000 are more than enough for the family.

Food per month is 5000, electricity and utilities is 5000, Fuel per month 5000, eating out is 5000(still this is too much for eating out though), kids expense is 5000, insurance premiums is 5000. Still there are 10000 Rs left over every month.

If you don't have family home and are renting, then still you need less than Rs 50,000 per month for the entire family.

So how come everyone is middle class!

My calculations might be wrong, by God's grace I'm wealthy enough that I don't look at prices of anything before buying it. As I said, I don't mean any disrespect, I understand that everyone is struggling, but this thought was in my mind since 3-4 days so I asked it.

I’m sick and tired of being someone’s “you’ll do”. Someone’s compromise. Not quite someone’s fantasy or cup of tea.

And yes, maybe I’m someone’s theoretical mythical creature - but not the people *I* want.

Not the people I crave **SO** badly.

I’m not my friend’s “best friend” “ride-or-die”

I’m not my mother’s favourite child.

I’m not my crush’s dream girl.

Even when I’ve managed to “get the guy”, I’ve been some weird consolidation prize - never quite enough, yet always too much… too loud, too boisterous, too manic and sad… Not enough thigh, not enough mystery, not enough poise.

My teeth are crooked, my toes are webbed, and my brain is wired wrong enough to sabotage my senses. But I’m funny, and I can cook pasta and I will listen all evening.

And some nights I cannot breathe, for the suffocation of failing to be more of anything and less of nothing.

The overwhelming pressure of being just under the bar set for being extraordinary. I am merely just above average, nothing spectacular and nothing breath-taking. Simply simple, and blendable, but in all the wrong ways.

I want to be “that girl”; but it is just a hair’s breadth from being obtainable, and I am drowning in my own inferiority complex so much I forget my own name.

I am the one that has to jump to reach for the desired, and they have to stoop to settle for me.

For broken, exhaustible, unspectacular me.

And I am sorry, that once the initial shine of me wears down from constant use, you are left with nothing more but the grit, and the tears, and the shakes.

I am sorry that I cannot stay in one space, in one time, and that I will never be who you have hoped for so desperately in your own head.

I am sorry that I will always be a mild disappointment, a shrug and a sigh over a lukewarm coffee, on a Tuesday evening.

I am sorry that all I will be is the filler episode, the side character, the NPC.

I am sorry for not being enough, and being too much, and cancelling myself out into neutrality.

So I will stand on the edge, never falling.

I will try to scream your name, but only manage to whisper, for you to wait for me, as one mediocre tear falls down my incredibly average cheek. 

You’ll give me a closed lipped smile, as you semi-apologise through slightly sympathetic eyes, and I will accept that you will be another one that I failed to enchant.

I am the colour brown, a tepid pool, a slice of bread. 

I am always the rule, never the exception.

He sat two desks away, always wearing a crisp gray shirt, sleeves rolled up just enough to reveal strong forearms. He had this effortless charm—the kind that made people laugh without trying, the kind that made you want to impress him.

I wasn’t bold enough to flirt outright, but I found excuses to linger near his desk. Borrowing a stapler. Asking about a report I didn’t actually need help with. Stupid little things.

One afternoon, I caught him watching me. Not in a creepy way—just a quiet, thoughtful gaze, like he was studying me the way I had been studying him.

“Want to grab coffee after work?” he asked casually, like he hadn’t just made my entire week.

Of course, I said yes.

That night, we talked for hours. It wasn’t dramatic or cinematic, just easy. Natural. By the time we parted ways, I already knew—I was falling for him.

# Then he didn’t show up to work the next day.

At first, I thought nothing of it. People called in sick all the time. But when I messaged him, there was no reply. His desk remained empty the day after that. And the next.

By the end of the week, HR sent out an email:

**""We regret to inform you that Daniel Whitmore has passed away. Out of respect for his family, details will not be disclosed.""**

The words blurred together as I reread them. Passed away? Just like that? **We had coffee three nights ago.** He was fine. Laughing. Looking at me like we had time.

The office moved on quicker than I expected. His desk was cleared out within days. Someone new took his seat. It was like he had never been there.

But I *felt* him.

I’d catch myself glancing at his empty desk, half expecting to meet his eyes. Some nights, I’d pass the coffee shop where we sat, heart aching at the memory. And once—just once—I could have sworn I heard his voice behind me, soft and familiar.

But when I turned around, there was no one there.

And then, one morning, I arrived at my desk to find a single sticky note attached to my monitor.

It wasn’t in my handwriting.

When I finally got to taking out the trash, the cans by the front door were overflowing from the morning rush. Our store is quite small, so I found myself handling garbage mere feet away from customers waiting in line.

As I was removing and tying the first bag, I noticed a mother and her teenage daughter standing nearby, watching me. The daughter whispered something like, ""Ew"" and ""I feel bad/That's so gross,"" to which her mother responded, ""This is why it's important that you study so you don't end up here. Study, study, study.""

I didn't react, but inside, I was deeply hurt. I wanted desperately to inform them: ""Actually, I'm college educated! I studied diligently and still ended up here!"" But what would that accomplish? In their eyes, I'm just a struggling barista—which, to be fair, is technically true.

The audacity of that woman, speaking to her daughter as though working at Starbucks is somehow beneath them, is truly appalling. It reminded me of an issue I've encountered in every service industry position I've held—people assume that working in food service means you're inferior to them. Many customers clearly view us as lesser beings. You can see this reflected in the shocking stories you may have or that have been shared in this community: baristas being called unspeakable names over something as simple as **coffee**. Fast food workers having items thrown at them, being verbally abused, being treated with utter disrespect. It's actually disheartening. It feels awful. 

No, I don't need a golden star or a cookie for showing up to work, but basic empathy is and has been out the window for a while now. All I want is for people to leave the disrespect and judgement at the door. It honestly makes it so hard to come to work everyday when this is the norm.

First, a vinegar solution is great for disrupting their scent trails, while a baking soda and sugar mixture can lure them in and mess up their digestive systems. Essential oils like peppermint and tea tree oil are natural repellents, and food-grade diatomaceous earth works by dehydrating ants without harming your pets. Ground cinnamon and lemon juice can also be effective, masking their trails and keeping them away. If you want immediate action, a soap and water spray can break down their exoskeletons, while cornstarch is a sneaky way to ensure they can't digest it. Used coffee grounds can deter ants while enriching your garden, and chamomile tea can be a pleasant-smelling repellent. So, you got a lot of options to keep those ants at bay!

1jgh9yc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Male_Enhancement_Pill/comments/1jgh9yc/how_i_approach_random_girl/,How I approach random girl,"Let me tell you a story. A story about a young guy who walked past the same girl on campus every day. She had long, chestnut hair that swayed with every step, a smile that could brighten even the gloomiest day, and a way of moving as if she were the heroine of a romantic movie. And him? He was just one of many. A guy who dreamed but never acted. A guy who stood in the shadows while she shone like the sun.

His name is… well, it doesn’t matter. Let’s call his Tom.

Tom had a problem. No, it wasn’t that he was shy like a puppy on its first walk. It was that he was *convinced* he would never be good enough. And all because of one small but monstrously important detail. His… well, size.

Yes, I’m talking about his penis.

It wasn’t microscopic like a grain of rice, but it wasn’t impressive like a samurai sword either. And it paralyzed him. Every day, as he walked past that girl, his thoughts circled around the same thing, like a carousel he couldn’t get off: “What if she finds out? What if I talk to her, and then she discovers the truth?”

And so the days, weeks, and months passed. Tom became a master of excuses, a virtuoso of procrastination. “Maybe tomorrow.” “Maybe when I lose some weight.” “Maybe when I get a better job.” But “tomorrow” never came. Instead, all he got was another serving of loneliness and frustration.

Then one day, he stumbled upon “that thing.”

I don’t know how it happened. Maybe it was chance, maybe it was a pop-up ad online like an unexpected guest at a party. But he found this small, unassuming product. Something that promised not just enlargement but also… freedom from fear.

Tom was as skeptical as a cat eyeing a new toy. But what did he have to lose?

He ordered it. It arrived in discreet packaging, like a secret delivery for a spy. Inside was a liquid that looked like any other, but it smelled like the promise of a new life.

The first day after using it, Tom felt something he hadn’t felt in years: confidence. I don’t know if it was placebo or magic, but something changed. His posture straightened like a string, his voice gained depth, and his gaze—intensity that drew attention like a magnet.

And then he approached her.

Yes, that girl. The one he had been dreaming about for months, whose laughter echoed in his head like the most beautiful melody. And you know what? She smiled. They talked. They laughed. And then… well, the rest is history.

But that’s not the end.

Because “[**that thing**](https://www.omegle1.com/)” didn’t just change his size. It changed his life. Tom started approaching other women. The ones he had thought about for years but never had the courage to act on. And you know what? They responded too. One looked at him like he was a rock star, another invited him for coffee, and yet another… well, I don’t need to go into details.

Today, Tom is no longer the same guy. He’s as confident as a lion on the savannah, as brave as a skydiver, and as ready for new challenges as an explorer before a great journey. And all thanks to that one little product.

If you also feel like fear is holding you back, like you’re lacking confidence, I have a solution for you.

1jgh9f6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TattooRemoval/comments/1jgh9f6/hydration_tips/,Hydration Tips,"I'm not a dr and i don't think this is a one size fits all. BUT i have a lot of experience of electrolyte imbalance, dehydration and the negative impacts of it from have a super weird instance of AFIB and SVT during my pregnancy (with no prior heart conditions or a family history of any). So since May 2024 - now I've spent a lot of time going to drs for my heart, talking about blood flow, hydration, electrolytes...blah blah blah.

Which feels very relevant to my current tattoo removal journey - so I'd like to share some hydration tips for those of us struggling to get in 3 liters of water a day: 

1. get a water bottle with a straw- it encourages you to mindlessly sip.

2. the water bottle you get pay attention to the ounces - i have a 35oz yeti  and i try to do 3 of those a day.

3. replenish lost electrolytes in the morning - i have my first bottle in the morning with electrolytes in it. you get dehydrated when you sleep. So when you wake up, put moisturizer on your tattoo and make a water bottle! I try to have this one finished before noon (i'm usually up at 730/8 and will drink it alongside my coffee). I like the porpel hydration packets. its mean for a 16 oz bottle but I think it tastes better if you thin it out more. liquid IV is a good one, Costco carries one that's good too i can't remember the name of it. 

4. Hydration is tricky. Sometimes just plain water won't cut it. If you are peeing a million times and your pee is clear thats not a sign of hydration. It's actually a sign the water is passing right through you. SO throw a lemon in there, orange, lime (citrus is good for your kidneys and liver) it'll encourage your body to absorb the minerals and actually hydrate you. In a pinch i've done a little himalayan salt but thats nasty. 

For reference (because i think it matters) I'm in CT. A lot of this info came from seeing Drs. at Yale during my heart stuff. We were pretty picky about what hospital to deliver in even before I became a high risk pregnancy. The team at Yale was very informative and worked really hard to keep me and the baby safe. They cared about educating my husband and i on how to get to full term without another incident....and we haven't had another AFIB episode since that one may '24!

I would say we have a pretty normal and healthy relationship—not much fighting or bickering.

The issue started when we began our internships, and he met new friends. Through them, he got to know this girl. From then on, he started having lunch alone with her and began hiding his Instagram stories from me, saying he didn’t want me to get mad.

That’s when I started having a bad impression of them together. I told him that she made me uncomfortable and that I didn’t like her, but he kept defending her and got mad whenever I brought up the topic.

Even now, after finishing our internships, he still sees her occasionally. At first, he kept hiding it from me, posting pictures of them together while blocking me from seeing them. I felt like a fool when people asked me about her, and I didn’t even know those photos existed. Mind you, he has never posted any pictures of us because, in his words, he likes to keep our relationship private.

Last week, I had dinner with my friend, and so did he. He wanted to take the train to the city to avoid traffic. To get to the train station, he had to pass by my house, so I asked him for a ride. Since I finished dinner earlier than him, I told him I would head home alone. Some part of me wanted him to offer to go back together since it was already 10 p.m., but instead, he just said, “Okay,” and mentioned he was about to grab some coffee.

1jgh3mh,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1jgh3mh/my_confession/,My Confession,"Hello, friends. I want to tell you my story.

This is going to sound cliche, but, I’ve always been different. I noticed it when I was five, though, I couldn’t quite explain it then. People around me always laughed, cried, got angry, etc. I could mimic it well, but I never felt it. 

I remember one moment clearly. I was seven years old, sitting in the basement of a church. Our youth pastor, a dull-eyed man who reeked of coffee and sweat, asked a simple question, “Do you love your parents?”

Without hesitation, every single hand shot up—except mine of course.

I looked around in confusion. I didn’t understand the question. Love? 

I knew the word, of course. People in movies said it, books talked about it. But to me, it meant nothing. I had no frame of reference. 

I raised my hand slowly, carefully, because I knew I was supposed to. But that moment stuck with me. Why did they all feel something I didn’t?

That was the first time I realized there was something wrong with me. Or maybe, something was wrong with them. Regardless, I felt like I wasn’t human.

Most people are ruled by emotions–happiness, guilt, sadness. I wasn’t. Except for when I felt something extreme, I was numb. A void. And I hated that emptiness. 

But then, I found a way to fill the void.

It started with an accident.

There was this girl in my friend group—Sarah. She had a crush on me, always standing too close, laughing too hard at my jokes. It was annoying. Suffocating. I needed her gone. But I couldn’t just tell her to leave. That’d make me the bad guy, and I happen to value my reputation quite a bit. 

So, I found another way.

I’d sigh and say, Sarah was talking about you the other day… but forget it, I don’t want to start drama. I’d let their paranoia fill in the blanks. An eye roll when she spoke, a shift in tone when I mentioned her name. Soon, they were talking about her on their own. She’s so clingy. She’s always in everyone’s business. They turned on her without realizing it. 

It worked better than I expected. Within a week, they stopped inviting her to places. She couldn’t sit with us at lunch. No one spoke to her during study hall. The way she looked at me the last time we saw each other—hurt, desperate for me to stand up for her—was almost funny. She had no idea it was me.

That was the moment I realized what power felt like. The rush in knowing I caused everything, that I was the reason why she was alone, and that no one blamed me—not even my victim. It was intoxicating. One of the first times I had felt my emotions so intensely. 

And after that, I had no choice. 

It’s not like it’s my fault I was born like this. If I were normal, I wouldn’t have to resort to such tactics. 

But I’m not, so I do. 

After Sarah, it was easy. I picked my targets carefully—people who trusted easily, people who had something to lose, people who were lonely. I would become their friend, find their weaknesses, and then press just hard enough to watch them break. 

With one girl, I convinced her best friend she liked her boyfriend. The friend exposed her to the whole school, and soon she was known as a slut. A boy struggled with his grades—so I helped him get better, and then I spread rumors that he cheated. I made sure nothing ever traced back to me. To this day, I haven’t been caught. 

It only took the occasional rumor, an “accidental” slip of the tongue. People want to believe the worst when you give them the chance.

The best part was always seeing when they understood that they were truly alone. The confusion. The panic. The helplessness. They would try to fix it, stammer out explanations, beg their friends to listen. But no one ever did. It was amazing. 

And the most intoxicating part? The risk. The tightness in my chest when someone started asking questions. The spike of adrenaline when I was doubted by the occasional teacher. The knowledge that if I was caught, I would be punished. My reputation would be ruined. I would suffer the same fate I gave my victims. That thrill became my drug—and like any addict, I needed more.

But like all highs, it faded too fast.

So I escalated. The rumors became crueler. I wanted to see how far I could push someone. I made them cry. I made them beg. I watched as their misery deepened, testing how much a human could take mentally before they completely broke.

And then, when I was thirteen, I made someone die.

His name was Ethan. He was quiet, awkward, and lonely. The kind of kid who wore the same hoodie every day and flinched when people walked too close. He was perfect. 

I was crueler than usual—but I was going through puberty, can you really blame me?

I started the same way I always did, by spreading rumors about him—ugly, vicious ones. I told people things he’d never even thought of, things that made their faces twist in disgust. I made sure no one spoke to him, it got to the point where if he drank from a water fountain no one else would use it for at least two days. 

I convinced his only friend, some kid named Jake, that Ethan had been making fun of his lisp, something he was incredibly insecure about. Jake didn’t believe it at first, but after a couple more tries he stopped sitting with Ethan at lunch. Stopped waiting for him after class. The first time I saw Ethan sitting alone, staring down at his untouched food, I felt something light up inside me. 

Ethan tried to fight it at first. He confronted people, his voice trembling, his hands shaking as he denied the rumors. But the more he struggled, the worse it got. I’d see him in the hallways, his shoulders hunched, sobbing as his eyes darted around like an animal. It was pathetic. And I loved it.

Usually, I would’ve ended it there, but maybe because I was a growing boy, or maybe I was just bored. It wasn’t enough, so naturally I continued. 

Eventually, things turned physical. Of course, I didn’t participate—I was too smart for that. But I watched, oh did I watch. There was a group of guys, bigger, and meaner than me, who took things to a whole new level. 

They’d corner Ethan in the locker room right after gym, shove him into the showers fully clothed, and beat him until he couldn’t stand. They’d burn him with lighters, leaving marks on his thighs and stomach. Once, they duct-taped him to a chair and left him in the janitor’s closet for hours. I’d hear about it later, see the videos they recorded, and I’d laugh along with everyone else. 

But secretly, at night, I’d watch those videos in my room. Rewind. Play. Rewind. Play. His fear, his humiliation—it was intoxicating. I hoped it continue forever.

And then, one day, he just broke.

It seemed like he wasn’t even there anymore. He’d just take it, his face blank, his eyes empty, like he’d given up. He didn’t even cry anymore. It was almost disappointing, how easy it became. But it also made me want to push harder, to see if I could get any kind of reaction out of him. 

A week later, is when it happened.

Hung himself in his bedroom. His mom found him. 

I remember sitting in class when they made the announcement. A teacher with red eyes, students gasping in shock, a few of them crying. But me? I sat still, my pulse racing.

I felt three things.

I didn’t feel guilty, not then—not ever. I felt fear. I waited for someone to turn around, to accuse me, to say my name. But no one did. The second thing I felt was a strange sense of pride, like I’d won something. I’d pushed him further than anyone could’ve, sure, I didn’t physically torment him. But without me, none of it would’ve happened. It was nice knowing that I was the reason he broke.

The last thing I felt was irony. He was struggling. He should’ve reached out. He needed help. My classmates sobbed over him. Painted him as a tragedy, blamed the world, blamed each other. But not the culprit, not me. 

Never me. 

While Ethan was a great experience, he killed himself. I wanted to know what it was like to take a life with my own hands.

So I planned. It was going to be my gift to myself for my fourteenth birthday.

The victim had to be someone no one would miss—someone disposable. A runaway, a homeless person, a drug addict. I spent weeks watching, looking for the perfect one. Eventually, I found him. A homeless man who slept near the back of an abandoned gas station, Mid-forties, smelled like piss and vodka. 

Perfect.

I learned his schedule, what little of it there was. He scavaged dumpsters behind the 7-Eleven in the morning, begged outside the liquor store in the afternoon, pass out at midnight. He never spoke to anyone. No one ever spoke to him.

When the night came, my hands were steady. I brought a knife, nothing too fancy—just sharp enough to get the job done. He was asleep when I got there. I pressed the blade to his throat, crouching over him, watching his eyes flutter. 

The second he woke up, I pressed down.

He struggled. Not as much as I expected, but enough to make it fun. His fingers clawed weakly at my arms, but he was slow—clumsy. I felt his pulse jump under my hand, heard the wet gurgling noises as he tried to suck in air through a throat that was no longer working.

Then, the moment.

The moment his body seized, shuddered, and finally. Finally, stilled. 

Silence. 

I stayed there for a while, just watching. The blood was warm where it soaked into my clothes, and the smell was amazing—metallic, raw. But the best part was watching the stillness. The complete, perfect stillness of something that had been alive but wasn’t because of me. 

And then came the high.

I felt awake in a way I never had before. I felt weightless, untouchable, like I could do anything. The world seemed shaper—colors deeper, sounds crisper.

I couldn’t stop smiling.

I ran my fingers through my blood-soaked jeans, smearing it between my fingers. 

Sticky. Cooling. Proof.

There was no regret. No doubt. Only the rush, the heat, the absolute certainty that I had never felt more alive than in the moment I watched life drain from someone’s eyes. 

I got rid of the body and cleaned myself up then walked home slowly. Stretching out the feeling, breathing it in, I wanted it to last.

By the time I got home, the feeling already disappeared and I was back to my normal, numb, self. 

But I wasn’t disappointed, because I knew one thing for sure.

I was going to do this again.

The second time was easier.

Another nameless, disposable person. Another night spent watching the life drain from their eyes. And the high—it was just as good. Just as intoxicating.

For a while.

But then, something changed.

The third kill still felt good, but the rush didn’t last as long. The warmth faded quicker, the satisfaction dulled faster. The fourth was the same, the fifth worse. It was like using drugs, each hit weaker than the last.

I knew what that meant.

I had to do more.

Pain helped. Drawing it out, making them suffer. The longer they screamed, the more I felt it—that electric, skin-piercing euphoria. I learned how to prolong it, how to keep them on the edge of death. It made the high last, it made it stronger.

But even that started to fade.

So, I got more creative.

I tried different tools, different methods. Some worked, some didn’t. Some were too messy, some too quick. I learned restraint. I learned how to make them beg, how to keep them alive just long enough to see hope drain from their faces. The longer it took, the better the satisfaction.

Still, no matter how much I escalated, the high always faded in the end. It was never enough.

And maybe that was the best part.

So, that’s my story.

You’ve listened so patiently, like the good friends you are. Maybe some of you are disgusted. Maybe some of you are fascinated. Either way, you stayed.

Because, really, isn’t this the same? The thrill of telling you, of confessing? The risk? It’s exhilarating. That’s why I’m telling you this. Because sharing my deeds—confessing, even anonymously, gives me that rush.

1jgh16u,https://www.reddit.com/r/mounjarouk/comments/1jgh16u/first_month_results_and_experience/,First month results and experience,"Hello everyone! 

I thought I’d write about my experiences for any newcomers thinking about starting MJ or anyone who wants to hear. 

How much weight did I lose:

It’s been 4 weeks since I started MJ and I’ve lost 4.5kg//10 pounds which I’m super happy with because my BMI was 30.8 to begin with, and also it’s the most I’ve ever lost in a month tbh. 

Ramadan experience:

I started mounjaro about a week before Ramadan was to begin, because I was fasting im not sure how effective 2.5mg would have been for me if I was just eating normally. However in Ramadan I usually gain weight as it’s so hard with being invited to dinners and the food is usually not the healthiest, so I’m amazed I was able to lose this much in ramadan. Aside from being invited to family dinners, I would usually overeat before fasting because I’d panic that I won’t be able to eat until later, I’d also overeat after breaking fast and my cravings would be out of control. 

This Ramadan with the help of MJ I couldn’t overeat if I tried, and the food noise and cravings were gone, I was actually dreading dinner invites because I’d feel sick after eating just normal portions of oily fried food. For suhoor (meal before fasting), I’d have something very small or sometimes i’d skip food entirely and just have a milky coffee. 

Effects I felt on MJ:

Negatives-I did experience some constipation and headache and fatigue, I had sulfur burps when I ate baked beans one day for dinner and I still haven’t eaten beans since. Rennie helped me a lot with this! 

Positives-I had good appetite suppression, I was able to stick to 1200-1500 calories apart from the first 2 days I would eat around 800, but this evened out towards the end of the week at family dinners I would eat about 2000 estimated. More importantly, my food noise and cravings were gone, I could eat one chocolate thing twice a week in moderation without binging on it, but I don’t really crave junk foods anymore. The only things I’ve craved so far are peas, peanut butter (when I was on my period) and cherry Coke Zero! 

Monthly cycle effect:

So I actually lost the 10 pounds in the 3 weeks, week 4 was 2 days before and then during my period and I ate a bit more that week but didn’t overreat, I was worried I would gain but I was able to maintain luckily. I wasn’t fasting at this time so I wonder if I wasn’t fasting if I’d have lost as much as I did but at the same time, I usually eat more during this time so it’s not an accurate representation. Also did not feel any effect on my cycle, period came on time and lasted 4.5 days which is usual for me, light cramps the first 2 days same as always. I do actually think it was a tad lighter than usual, perhaps because I’m eating less? 

Exercise:

I did 10k steps about 3-4 days a week and that’s it, I usually try and do it 6 days a week but with not being able to drink throughout the day I’ve been inconsistent. 

Moving forward:

I’ve just taken my 5th dose with an insulin needle which was about 3.3mg. I’ll use this weeks dose to see how I feel with the side effects whether to go up to 5 next week, as that will fall on Eid week where ill be partaking in food gatherings and I do want to have a bit of an appetite for that day as not to bring attention to myself (I’m a secret jabber). 

Well that’s about it I think. I’m happy to answer any questions if you have any, I’ll possibly continue posting updates monthly. Thanks for reading and I hope you all have a lovely weekend! :) ",2,1742564333.0,mounjarouk,0,1.0,False

I come from a stat background, where I also learned linear algebra and the basis of linear programming. I am currently facing an OR problem: providing an algorithm for optimal job scheduling on the factory floor, in order to minimize total makespan.

The problem is the following:

* The product manufactured in this factory (food industry) goes through essentially only one processing stage in a dedicated machine;
* Once the material needed for that order enter the machine, the process should not be stopped (it will result in the loss of the batch) and the order cannot be allocated to another machine;
* This type of machine can process only one order at a time and requires cleaning after each order has finished;
* The cleaning time heavily depends on both the past and upcoming treated product (i.e. when the flavor of the order just processed is mint and the upcoming product is mint-based as well, the cleaning time is small; however if the upcoming order is let's say coffee-based, then it results in longer downtime);
* The cleaning matrix describing the cleaning time is known and deterministic, given exclusively by the flavor interaction;
* There are m available machines that can process any of the incoming orders;
* Each order has a different known process time, a given due date (but not a strict deadline) and a flavor;
* Machines may fault, hence the order in progress (if any) will require more time than established initially;
* The factory has up to 15 machines available and may process hundreds of orders each day;
* Orders to process are typically known at the beginning of a working day and are rarely increased or modified during the day;
* Ideally, the algorithm should adapt rapidly (within a minute) to sudden changes, such as new urgent orders or unforeseen halts of the machine.

Having just a basic understanding of the subject, I am seeking for suggestion on books, blogs and learning materials to aid me in the resolution of such problem.

Until 2 weeks ago, I was a complete beginner in the headphone world. Well, not completely, but I didn’t know much about current gear.  
At the moment, I have 3 pairs of headphones:

1. AirPods Pro 2 – mainly for phone calls or podcasts.
2. JBL Live 660NC – bought for wireless music listening. Very poor sound quality, which is muffled, lacking depth. Overall, I’m quite disappointed.
3. ISK HD9999 – wired headphones, bought many years ago. Of all three, they offer the best sound quality, but they lack clarity and depth. I use them for audio monitoring for podcast recording, video editing in DaVinci, and for listening to music when I’m at my desk.

In the past, I had Sennheiser Momentum 4 wireless headphones twice. They were the best headphones I’ve had, but after two claims for Bluetooth disconnections, the seller refunded my money. I’ll add that after setting the EQ in the app, I was very satisfied with the sound. They were a bit too bass-heavy, but with those headphones, I started hearing certain tracks in a new way, which was quite enjoyable.

I’m looking for headphones that will provide better sound quality than the Sennheisers. The headphones must be mobile, though that doesn't necessarily mean wireless. I’m considering wired headphones + Bluetooth adapter. When traveling, I can use the AirPods Pro.

The headphones must offer excellent audio quality while sitting at my desk, washing the car, gardening, walking the dog, enjoying my morning coffee in the garden, or listening to music before bed. So, open-back headphones are out of the question, as I don’t want to disturb my family’s peace (for example, before sleep, my wife often falls asleep before me, and I listen to music for an hour or two afterward).

There are no audio stores in my area where I can listen to how the headphones sound.

I’d like to stay within a $400–500 USD budget. The Sennheiser Momentum 4 is my reference point; I’d like something with slightly less bass, a cleaner sound, and more detail.

The best option would be wireless headphones with excellent sound quality, though ANC doesn’t need to be class-leading. The headphones must be able to connect via cable to a computer. This rules out JBL and ISK, leaving the AirPods as my headphones for work and YouTube. Wireless headphones aren’t suitable for quality video-to-audio editing because of the sound delay.  
I was considering the Focal Bathys (they cost $750 in my country), Noble Fokus Apollo ($725), B&W PX8 ($425) – I'm willing to pay extra for good sound quality. I think that mainly for wireless headphones, while wired ones seem cheaper, so I’m limiting the budget for them to $400.

Alternatively, if not wireless, I’d look for great-sounding wired headphones, but then I’d need to consider buying a Bluetooth adapter since I don’t listen to music in one place. In that case, JBL and ISK are ruled out as well.

Audio is played from my iPhone 14pro (I have a lightning adapter) or MacBook Pro – mainly from Spotify, sometimes YouTube – and that will remain the same. I realize I won’t achieve a hi-fi listening level, but that’s not my goal. I’ll just emphasize that I want better sound than from the Sennheiser Momentum 4.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1jggtmv,https://www.reddit.com/r/inlaws/comments/1jggtmv/boyfriends_sister_is_a_bully/,boyfriend’s sister is a bully.,"i’m so sorry for such a long post but there’s so much to say and this isn’t even all of it. any advice would be greatly appreciated and i’m so thankful for anyone that manages to read all of this!

my (23F) boyfriend’s (21M) sister (19F) is a bully and we’re not sure what to do about it.

just to quickly explain the living situation, it’s pretty weird at the moment. i never officially moved in with my boyfriend and his family (mum and sister), it just kind of happened over time (i don’t come from the best home — mine and my mum’s relationship is better when there’s some distance between us). currently, his mum has moved in with her own boyfriend, leaving just myself, my boyfriend and his sister in the house. we don’t have the money to move out yet, but we’re definitely trying.

so, it was kind of clear to me that his sister never liked me. before i’d even met her, she didn’t like me because of the places i shopped at and said stuff like ‘ew, that’s where all the pretty, skinny girls shop.’ a few months into our relationship, my boyfriend and i were on call playing video games and i heard him, his mum and sister talking about her birthday meal in the background. she said ‘she’s not coming.’ loud enough so that i could hear, even though i had no intentions of going anyway. her mum made her message me and apologise for this. a few months after that, she had an outburst whilst i was at his house and shouted ‘i don’t like your girlfriend’ and then went on to rant about me. his mum called me into his sisters room so we could ‘have it out’ even though i had no idea what was going on considering that everything seemed to have been fine. i started crying and ended up leaving because i’m not a fan of confrontation, and his sister proceeded to scream and cry some more saying ‘why am i always the bad guy?’ more recently, we all went on holiday together and she’d gotten into an argument with everyone and left the table crying, so i went to check on her. i let her vent to me and out of nowhere she brought up the fact that she prefers my boyfriend’s ex to me. it felt like she said this just to hurt my feelings, which seemed really spiteful because i was just trying to help her.

things have gotten much worse since then, and living with her is taking a huge toll on my boyfriend and i. she constantly leaves the kitchen in a state, she never helps out with the house, she uses things that we buy even after we’ve told her not to and ruins them / doesn’t replace them, she keeps trying to intimidate us by calling us names, slamming furniture and such, and is overall just very hostile. she also brings her boyfriend over a lot and they argue very loudly for hours. they slam things and threaten to smash the place up; it’s gotten physical between them and we have evidence of this in case we need to use it.

there was also an instance where it was mine and my boyfriend’s anniversary so we planned to have a movie night with snacks, etc. during this, she called and asked him to pick up her parcel from the post office, which he did (took around an hour in total). then, when she got home from work, she asked him if he would do her dishes for her so she could go to her boyfriend’s house. he said no because it was our anniversary and she just unleashed hell on him. she was screaming and crying and saying that he was a bad brother and that he never does anything for her. then she came upstairs and started on me too.

this is probably the worst part of it. one weekend, my boyfriend and i spent pretty much all of saturday and sunday deep cleaning and organising his kitchen. his sister got back from her boyfriend’s house on tuesday around 5:30pm, and she came upstairs to complain to me that my boyfriend and i need to walk their dog more. this is completely understandable, but since his mum left, we’ve had to take on all of her responsibilities from the house, including the dog — whilst his sister doesn’t really do anything to help out. if she thought that the dog needed to be walked more, it would be nice of her to take her out. my boyfriend doesn’t get back from work till around 6pm and i’m not able to walk her on my own (she’s quite a reactive german shepherd and i wouldn’t feel comfortable walking someone else’s dog by myself). she eventually left the room, complaining as she went, and went back downstairs. my boyfriend got back from work around 20 minutes later and she started on him as soon as he walked through the door, crying and ranting and saying that we don’t do enough. this was the final straw for me and everything that had been building over the three years my boyfriend and i had been together reached its limit. it hit especially hard considering that my boyfriend and i had been putting in so much effort to the house and the dog whilst his sister had been doing nothing at all to help out.

so i went to the top of the stairs and shouted down to her ‘well what do you do?’ and it took her around 5 seconds to scale the stairs and shove my boyfriend out of the way to get to me. she came with that much force that, as she passed my boyfriend at the top of the stairs, the coffee he was holding flew up the wall. she was screaming at me with her finger in my face, swearing and calling me names, all because i’d dared to stand up to her for once. even though she’s a few years younger than me, this girl is twice my weight and taller than me, and has a history of getting violent and threatening to ‘leather’ and ‘batter’ people (beat people up). so i pushed her to get her away from me because it looked as though she was about to hit me, and as a result, she grabbed my hair and would not let go. somehow, we both ended up on the floor and she finally let go. i left and went back into my boyfriends room and she went downstairs and was still screaming, ranting and crying. she was threatening to smash my boyfriends head in and squaring up to him, threatening to smash up the house, calling us pretty much every name under the sun. this went on for about an hour, until she finally left the house. we heard her continue screaming in the street at the back of the house.

after that, she went to stay at her boyfriends house for a month and my boyfriend and i finally felt comfortable and safe in the house. 

now she’s back and it’s starting again. she’s leaving her mess everywhere and we’re constantly cleaning up after her. she’s filling the bathroom bin to the point where it’s overflowing with her sanitary products and not taking it out. she leaves her dishes piled at the sink and doesn’t do them for weeks. she’s bringing her boyfriend back over and arguing with him again. she’s leaving her clothes in the washing machine so that we can’t use it, but if we take out her washing to do our own washing, she shouts at us. when i’m in the house alone, she often shouts abuse directed at me to try and intimidate me whilst i’m in the bedroom, including calling me a ‘stupid little f*cking rat’ even though i haven’t talked to her or even really seen her since the big blow up.

just this morning, my boyfriend and i had been awake for no more than 20 minutes (around 7:20am), and she was downstairs in the kitchen ranting and calling us ‘f*cking m*ngs’ (ableist term in the UK) because we hadn’t opened the curtains in the living room. we hadn’t even been downstairs yet. this is what prompted me to finally make this post.

what makes it worse is that in all of this, she views herself as the victim. she refuses to see it any other way. we have tried reaching out to his mum for help but nothing really comes of it, because she bullies her mum too. we’ve tried just ignoring her, but it’s not getting us anywhere because we constantly feel on edge whenever she’s in the house. i tried standing up to her, but that ended up turning physical. 

my boyfriend is currently on an apprenticeship and i’m studying full time at university, trying to find a part time job, so we probably won’t be able to move out for a little while. we feel really stuck.",3,1742563721.0,inlaws,1,1.0,False

Miami is a renown city which has been seen across countless pieces of media and is frequented with more and more volume by those seeking a retreat away from their day to day monotony.

For me? I have lived here my entire life. Age granted me the opportunity to travel and see countless other places but I have always returned back to my home.

Why am I opening a dating post with talk about my city? It's a core pillar in who I am.

I am first generation Cuban-American and a die-hard believer of my ancestral culture. We're talking the AMAZING Cuban food, cafecitos (Cuban coffee), music, cigars, our history, and so much more. The best part? This is only a fraction of what makes me, me.

# Cliff Notes

* 29 y/o (turning 30 in Q3 2025)
* Electrical engineer by trade (I work in the industry for one of the largest Radio Frequency/Microwave component manufacturers in the world)
* I adore Anime (I grew up on Dragon Ball, Naruto, Bleach, Death Note, Elfen Lied, etc. I am currently following Solo Leveling, Sakamoto Days, and a few other series week-to-week)
* I love playing video games (I own a stupidly nice gaming PC, PS5, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch) & I also play Path of Exile, World of Warcraft, OSRS, and more!
* I adore writing (mainly roleplay online or with whoever is my significant other)
* I train judo 3x/week (yellow belt, been training since early 2024)
* I use to train kendo and iaido (trained for about 2 years all-in back in late 2021 through mid 2023)
* I am a beginner guitar player (I pick up and put down lessons as time allows)
* I studied salsa dancing for about 3 months (then work caught up with me)
* I love cooking for my family (grilling, BBQ, baking, etc.)
* I am getting into making craft beer at home (It's quite fun!)
* I am a veteran cigar smoker (I smoke 1-2x/month, collect cigars, age them for years at a time, then host little smoke parties for my friends)
* I love mixing drinks (if I am going to drink 1-2x/week, those drinks better be the bomb)
* ... And so much more... (see my profile for additional information)

# A Few Other Items

* Politics - libertarian (minarchist ideologically, pragmatist in practice; one thing is on paper and another is in practice)
* Children - none, want 2-3 biological children in the future
* Most Active - day-time; morning person
* Sleep Style - hyper-sensitive light sleeper (noise, temperature, etc.), sleep \~10 PM EST, wake up \~5:30 AM weekdays (7-7:30 EST weekends)
* Work Schedule - Monday through Friday 8:15 AM to 5:00 PM (later sometimes)

* Orientation - demisexual, sapiosexual, bisexual (heavily leaning toward women)
* Relationship Style - primarily monogamous, open to ethical non-monogamy after establishing trust and rapport

# What Am I Looking For

* Someone based out of the USA (I am unable to travel internationally at this time due to work commitments and won't be able to until 2nd half 2026 most likely). If you are NOT based in the USA and STILL reach out, please keep this in mind so you know we won't meet in person for over a year and a half depending what country you are in. My line of work requires me stay out of certain parts of the world due to the intellectual property I work with and what it could mean if my work laptop is confiscated by a foreign government.
* Someone who shares a similar schedule to mine or is able to communicate during my availability/work hours. I have had issues lately with people working in healthcare, for example, because they work nights and sleep days so we basically never got to talk. Obviously, people get some amount of leeway just like people with unique schedules (don't think I've cut people off because they work nights as a nurse, it was more-so unwillingness to try and talk when possible that broke the string).
* Nothing in particular appearance-wise. I am looking for a partner to click with so appearance is heavily secondary to me
* A person who wishes to be a team/duo. To work together toward common goals or goals which drive us together and toward common goals.
* Someone open to challenging me when they believe I could be doing better. I am not looking for a ""yes"" girl.
* Someone who is not opposed to difficult conversations when it comes to the health of our relationship and one-another.
* Someone who understands how important family is to us latinos and that latino families tend to spend a lot of time together (and you will be included of course)

# Minimum Expectations

* Text every day with a voice/video-call once per day
* 1-2 ""dates"" per week (watching shows together, playing games together, etc.)",0,1742563552.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.5,False

In January, while my wife and I were drinking our coffee around 6am, we heard a scratch at the door. Thinking it was our cat wanting in I opened the front door. Low and behold on that 32° morning was a 2 year old female aiberian husky. She wanted inside like she had been living there her entire life. 
 We cautiously let her in, and she did very well. I notified shelters, vets offices that we had her in case anyone lost her. No chip, not spade and extremely friendly. After 2 weeks of no replies from anyone we decided to welcome her into our family. Got her to the vet, she is now chipped, spade, and shots are all up to date. Extremely healthy.
 Now, just this morning we had a very frightening incident involving her and our only other dog, Zelda, J.R./Chihuahua mix. Each morning they get their treat for their teeth. They know when we say each morning, let's go brush your teeth. This morning, however, our husky attacked Zelda, when handing them their morning teeat. Had Zelda by the throat causing me to stick my hand in her mouth to break the hold she had. My wife was also bit, but not from aggression, but instead trying to help separate them. Zelda is fine, zero injuries, but now I am worried this will happen again and could be much worse next time.
 We don't want to surrender her, since she is so freaking good with kids, cats, and other dogs in general. This is something like a freak incident and we are not knowing what to do. She has never shown any signs of aggression until today. Not sure what to do at this point. I have been reading about food aggression and dominance, but after a few months of her being here, how is this just now happening? I am now worried of what else ""could happen.""

1jggorl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seaofthieves/comments/1jggorl/idea_recreate_lloyds_cafe_to_offer/,Idea: Recreate Lloyd's Cafe to offer Privateer/Pirate Insurance + Escort Quests,"In real life, insurance as a concept started with boats/cargo in London.^^^1 The main place people went to secure coverage and hear the news about pirates, privateers, weather, etc. was a coffee shop named Lloyd's cafe.

Today, Lloyd's is a massive collection of insurance providers who offer some of the most unique coverage around, but it literally started as a coffee shop.

I think SoT would benefit from adding in some sort of boat insurance thing that lasted for X amount of time that you could buy and would return a portion of the value of the stuff on your boat during that time period.

They could also act as a place for people to sell their services to other players during specific voyages. If the other boat completes its voyage without sinking, you get paid and advance with Lloyd's or whatever they want to rebrand it as.

This sort of guns for hire in insurance is common. Even in modern times, a few years ago, a company hired war ships to protect its ships as they traveled near Sudan.

What do you all think?

---

1. First contract I've found that resembled insurance was out of Sicily IIRC, was for wool, and predated Lloyd's by a couple centuries, but that was an isolated contract. The Catholic Church viewed insurance as the same as charging interest/usury and didn't allow it, which is why an area that was not Catholic (i.e., London) created insurance.",0,1742563318.0,Seaofthieves,3,0.5,False

São Miguel Island is crisscrossed with beautiful trails of varying lengths, steepness, and difficulty, so everyone can find the perfect hike.  

Most hikes on this volcanic island involve some degree of ascent, but there are a few excellent routes with minimal elevation change and no steep stretches. We’ve compiled a list of our favorite routes, ranging from fun and easy walks to medium-difficulty trails featuring fascinating natural and man-made sights, as well as challenging hikes that lead to breathtaking viewpoints!

And don’t forget one of the best perks of traveling by campervan: you can park right by the trail, enjoy the hike outside peak hours, and freshen up with a shower as soon as you’re done!

# For Those Who Enjoy Easy Walks 

  
**Lagoa das Furnas (**[**PRC06 SMI**](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/portugal/azores/rota-circular-da-lagoa-das-furnas)**)**  

\- Category: Circular  

\- Difficulty: Easy  

\- Distance: 9.5 km  

\- Average Duration: 3h00  

\- Elevation Change: 140m  

The entire Furnas volcanic area feels like a vast botanical garden—locals don’t seem to have front yards; instead, they have parks! This trail takes you around the lake, where you’ll see the Chapel of Nossa Senhora das Vitórias, a stunning 19th-century Gothic construction. You’ll also pass by (or visit!) the Mata Jardim José do Canto garden, the Furnas Environmental Interpretation Centre, and the famous geothermal cooking site, where local restaurants prepare the traditional Cozido stew.  

The official trailhead starts in the town, requiring some uphill and downhill walking. However, if you prefer, you can skip this section and simply walk around the lake.

\- Category: Circular  

\- Difficulty: Easy  

\- Distance: 3.4 km  

\- Average Duration: 1h30  

\- Elevation Change: 175m  

This scenic route through tea plantations begins at the Gorreana Tea Factory in the northern part of the island. The first half of the trail climbs gently through forested and agricultural areas, but once you reach the highest point (just 150m above the starting elevation), a pleasant descent begins.  

This path was once used by workers during the tea harvest and winds its way down between the plantations, leading back to the factory. At the end of the hike, you can relax with a cup of tea (or coffee) on the large terrace, which offers stunning views of the plantations and the ocean.  

Gorreana is the oldest tea plantation in Europe and a great place to pick up meaningful souvenirs from the Azores.

\- Category: Linear  

\- Difficulty: Easy  

\- Distance: 2.1 km  

\- Average Duration: 1h30  

\- Elevation Change: 125m  

Despite being the shortest trail on the island, this route offers plenty to see, including three waterfalls and an abandoned hydroelectric power station. It’s fascinating to witness how nature reclaims structures once abandoned—huge rusted transformers covered in moss, crumbling walls, and wild trees growing over what was once a key part of industrialization.  

Since this is a linear trail, you’ll likely walk it back and forth. Starting from the lowest point allows you to climb up first and then enjoy a leisurely descent.

# Trails That Require Some Effort  

**Praia – Lagoa do Fogo (**[**PR02 SMI**](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/portugal/azores/prc02-smi-praia-lagoa-do-fogo)**)**  

\- Category: Linear (Roundtrip)  

\- Difficulty: Medium  

\- Distance: 11 km  

\- Average Duration: 4h00  

\- Elevation Change: 400m  

Lagoa do Fogo translates to ""Lake of Fire,"" but if the name makes you think of fog, you wouldn’t be entirely wrong—this volcanic peak is often shrouded in mist. Fortunately, you can check visibility from many points on the island: if you spot the tall antenna towers at the top, it’s a sign the weather is clear and it’s time to go!  

This trail begins on the southern side of the island and ascends to the lake, passing an old fiber production factory and following a levada (irrigation channel). The journey culminates in stunning viewpoints over the lake and the northern coast.  

https://preview.redd.it/drtklr18m1qe1.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=17d58b3e774067dbd43c7b8ade9aa126cd839ccb

  


**Rocha da Relva (**[**PR20 SMI**](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/portugal/azores/prc20-smi-rocha-da-relva)**)**  

\- Category: Circular  

\- Difficulty: Medium  

\- Distance: 5.5 km  

\- Average Duration: 3h00  

\- Elevation Change: 600m  

Rocha da Relva offers a perfect mix of hiking, historical sightseeing, and a beach day. Despite being close to Ponta Delgada, the island’s largest town, this old village has never been connected to the road network. To this day, transport relies on donkeys and off-road motorbikes.  

The trail descends about 600m to the sea, passing by wine cellars, houses, and vineyards framed by black basalt rock walls. In summer, fruit trees along the route are heavy with ripe fruit, but please refrain from picking anything—it belongs to the villagers.  

https://preview.redd.it/yenl5pr9m1qe1.jpg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=31f751d07506221ec8b849a18e364964c050ff4f

\- Category: Linear  

\- Difficulty: Medium  

\- Distance: 5.9 km  

\- Average Duration: 2h00  

\- Elevation Change: 350m  

This hike begins in a lush valley surrounded by emerald-green hills. The trail follows a creek uphill, leading to two beautiful waterfalls. Some sections are steep, but steps and railings make them manageable. On the way back, you can make a detour to visit Sanguinho, an abandoned village now restored as a charming tourism project. Here, you can relax with a coffee in a beautifully renovated old orchard.

\- Category: Linear (Round trip)

\- Difficulty: Hard  

\- Distance: 14 km  

\- Average Duration: 4h00  

\- Elevation Change: 600m  

Pico da Vara, the highest point on São Miguel, offers stunning panoramic views of both the north and south coasts. The most common trail **(**[**PRC07 SMI**](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/portugal/azores/prc07-smi-pico-da-vara)**)** zigzags through a forest of Cryptomeria japonica, with the breathtaking view reserved only for the summit. We would recommend you to take the alternative path from the side of Furnas, which goes along the rim and offers awesome views all the way. This trail is also better if you are travelling with a campervan for the convenient parking and better quality of the road.

\- Category: Linear  

\- Difficulty: Medium  

\- Distance: 15 km  

\- Average Duration: 5h00  

\- Elevation Change: 350m  

This is the longest trail on the island, stretching from Remédios to Água do Pau. It follows an ancient water route, passing old bridges, aqueducts, clay pipelines, levadas (water channels), and tunnels.  

Make sure to bring a flashlight for the tunnels, and pay attention to signs, as this trail intersects with several others. For those who love an extra challenge, since it’s a linear trail, you can always hike back the same way—doubling the distance for a truly intense workout!

**Mata do Canário - Sete Cidades (**[**PR4SMI**](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/portugal/azores/pr4-smi-canary-forest-and-seven-cities)**)**  

Category: Linear  

Difficulty: Medium  

Distance: 11.8 km  

Average Duration: 3h  

Elevation Change: 750m  

Sete Cidades is the island’s most iconic destination, featuring two picturesque lakes nestled within a volcanic crater. A charming village lies nearby, surrounded by lush green pastures and grazing cows. This scenic hike takes you along two-thirds of the lake’s perimeter, ascending from water level to the crater’s rim. Along the way, you'll be rewarded with breathtaking views of the crater’s interior, lakes, volcanic formations, and the island’s north coast.  

For those seeking an extra challenge, you can complete the loop by returning via the main road—just be sure to walk safely along the side!

I grab my pen, because I've got much to say.  
The blank page is staring, it's mocking my face,  
“Come on, dear poet, let us pick up the pace!”

**I ponder and pause, while my coffee grows cold,**  
Searching for rhymes, for stories yet to be told.  
“I'll write of the sun or a cat with a hat?  
Or perhaps a sandwich—now that’s where it’s at!”

**The lines that I scribble, I swear they ARE great,**  
But I read them again, and I'm filled with hate.  
“Why did I rhyme ‘moon’ with ‘spoon’ and ‘lack’ with ‘quack’?  
Lost in this maze, and I cannot find my track.”

**I play with metaphors, as deep as the sea,**  
But the sand in my hourglass slips carelessly.  
“Is it time to give up? To quit in despair?  
Or find some witty memes on the ‘net somewhere?”

**But then I am struck by a bright flash of light,**  
Inspiration and I find words that feel right!  
I scribble and giggle, I leap with a grin,  
'Til I check it and think, “Where do I begin?”

**So here’s to poets, both silly and wise,**  
Gently crafting verses, facing both lows and highs.

**Starting weight**

I was 121kg, 178cm in height so running a BMI of 38.2

This week, my weight has dropped to 117kg and a revised BMI of 36.9.

**Food intake**

I’ve made some conscious changes such as swapping out toast for a banana in the morning, no crisps, no sweets etc and I’ve felt better for it. I still have one vice that is diet fizzy. I don’t drink coffee, or tea but will still have fizzy juice and squash/diluting robinsons. 

My suggested calorie intake was to be 2108 per day giving me 14,756 for the week. I have consumed 9,400 (average of 1,342 per day). 

**Exercise**

I would only average 5,500 per day due to office working but I have managed to get this up to 8,900 per day this week. My plan is to get the consistent 10,000 steps as the weather improves. No other exercise done this week.

**Feelings after the first shot**

probably a mix of adrenaline in taking it and a bit of mind games telling myself that I’m paying for this - “you have to work hard with this”. For the first few days, I did feel full about 20-30mins after eating. One night I made chilli and maybe only ate half of what I usually eat. I lost interest halfway through it (and I make a good chilli as well!)

I also acknowledge that these first few doses are just to get your body ready for the 5mg and above doses, but it’s a good time to set the foundations for willpower. 

Second shot today so we’ll see how the next week goes.

My problem with cafes is not the price. I get it, they have more bills to pay so their coffee will be more expensive than at home. My problem is, I don't want a fucking milkshake when I order a cold coffee. I see people order like a cold hazlenut coffee or maybe an iced mocha. It's a fucking milkshake don't buy it from the cafe. This is a problem with almost every single cafe because of the fucking consumers. I'm looking at you guys too when I say this. Go drink milkshakes from keventers not from starbucks.

I'll never go to a cafe for a date unless my date enjoys me complaining about bad coffee. And god forbid they order a 'cold coffee', I'm never talking to them again.

1jgge3i,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jgge3i,Chongqing's Vertical Village: Cliffside Stairs Leading to 1900s Missionary Lamps 🔴🪜🟠,"Clinging to the Yangtze River cliffs like a architectural barnacle, the Mountain City Alley defies gravity and modernity. This 600-year-old stairway alley is Chongqing's only street named after the ""mountain city"" title. 



Its story starts in the Ming-Qing dynasties. In 1900, French missionaries set up lamp poles on the slope to light the path for travelers, giving it the former names Sky Lantern Alley and Sky Lantern Street. It was renamed Shancheng Lane in 1972.  



The alley itself is built against the mountain, climbing the cliffside through a cascading series of stone steps. Within its area stand historical buildings like:  

\- The original Catholic Benevolence Church  

\- Houlu (a mansion with distinctive style)  

\- The Changleyongkang Stone Gate from the Qing Dynasty... 



It's the best place to experience the culture of old mountain city. The combination and contrast between tradition and modernity create a strong impact.



As a local, this is one of my two favorite spots in central Chongqing (the other being Xiahaoli). What I love most is its chill vibes.



Normally ideal itinerary is Tongyuan Gate ➡️ Gulou Lane ➡️ Consul Alley ➡️ Mountain City Alley



It's all the way down, so it will be quite easy, after exploring the Yangtze River cliff pathways, remember ro reward yourself with a nice meal. 



It can be flexibly combined with other locations as well, like the Yangtze river night boat ride from Hongya Cave Port.

We would prefer if it's within an hour or two of Chiang Mai (so Chiang Rai is too far), and bonus points if we don't have to rely on our own transportation, but we could rent a car provided the road there isn't too dangerous. We are into activities like day-treks, relaxing with a nice view, vegetarian food, tribal cultures (no human zoo experiences, but it could be interesting to visit an actual lived-in village for a meal or a specific activity), tea and coffee, history, unique markets, and waterfalls.

- Chiang Dao
- Mae Kampong

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

First of all, my joints are MOSTLY good but my foot muscles/ligaments still cramp up. This is due to a very VERY small stress fracture but I thought this would have healed by now. Said stress fracture has been an issue that flares up for many years.

My blood pressure hasn't gone down, if anything it's gotten worse because....

My weight hasn't gone down.

When I did keto about 5 years ago (aged 31M) I lost like 12kg/26lbs in 6 weeks and went down a shirt and pant size.

This time around (almost 36M) I've barely lost 4kg/9lbs and my waist has only decreased 2cm (not even an inch).

I eat beef (both steak and mince), butter, tallow, and eggs and sometimes lamb and cheese when I make an omelette. Occasionally I'll eat chicken and fish. I've stopped the Greek yoghurt and lately I've opted to use ghee over butter so as to help with the diarrhoea I've been getting again. I drink black coffee but I also drink it with milk. Should I stop the milk?

I salt my food generously and take electrolytes when I need to. I'll take vitamin D3, zinc and magnesium but I rarely feel the need to do so.

I also drink PLENTY of water, sometimes up to a gallon (4ish Litres) a day depending on my activity level. It's most sparkling water though.

I got on this diet to lower my weight, blood pressure and borderline fatty liver.

What am I doing wrong here? I've heard of a ""whoosh"" effect that happens to some people, where their body just all of a sudden, drops a bunch of weight and recomposes itself. Will this happen? Has this happened for anyone?

ALL advice is welcome. This is the first time I've attempted this diet as diligently as I have.",1,1742562124.0,carnivorediet,16,1.0,False

1jgg7g0,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1jgg7g0/i_won_the_lottery/,I won the lottery.,"They say to be loved is to be known. 

Love comes in different forms but let me talk about the kind of love that has found me and stayed with me through my highest highs, lowest lows and everything in between. 

(1) Few days ago I might have randomly blabbed about how I've been craving for mangoes.

It's almost 9pm when I received messages asking me to go out of our house for a second and there he was, Friend1 holding a bag of mangoes he brought straight to our house from his out of province work trip. 

(2) It's around 8 in the morning, a gut wrenching news woke me up. My mind went blank, my heart sank & I mindlessly made that 
call. Friend2, on the other line answered and the only thing I got to say was a shaky ""Hello?"" his immediate response was ""Where are you? - don't go anywhere"". In a speed of a lightning, he's right there standing in front of me,he knew no words could comfort me that moment and all he could do is be there and watch over me. This happened years ago & I got the chance to ask him how come he just instantly showed up without me saying anything.

His response was - ""I know you, you hated calls. You watch your phone ring. So when I saw your name on my phone, I picked up my things ready to leave before I even picked up the call. (🥹)"" 

(3) I still get pictures of the moon, pretty skies, & sunsets from my friends coupled with messages -"" I instantly thought of you when I saw this"" ; ""took a photo cause I know you love the skies"" ; ""I saw the moon tonight, It reminded me of  you"" ; ""In case you missed it, the sunset looked great"" etc. (my heart 🥹) 

(4)  Hit a rough patch. - thankfully I had great support system, was able to talk about it through group call with my girlfriends. Few minutes after the call, someone was calling out for me, went out and saw Friend3 handing me my comfort food (jollibee haha). 

He pretended that he was on his way home and just thought of dropping by but he's bad at lying so I knew immediately my girls had informed him of the situation (he lived the closest) , I laughed while getting those teary eyes Hahaha. He then proceeded to tell me ""It will be alright"" no other dramas, just pure understanding between us.(aweee these fellas 🥹) 

(5) I can drive, so when hanging out with friends, I usually volunteer to bring my own 'service' or atleast drive for them but these gentlemen would always reject my offers. Their tagline is ""Hatid-sundo balikan kahit saan."" Always a battle between hyper independent girly & these gentlemen - even with gas money, it's a courtesy for me to atleast pay for it but they'll look at me dead in the eye & say ""Relax ka lang diyan."" (😂) 

(6) I like coffee, I love visiting cafes and yap hahaha my gfs - everytime they discover new cafes, they'd hit me up with ""Do u want to try this?"" ""should we go here?"" ""You'll like it here"". Etc. 

(7) I don't like pineapple on pizza (I don't eat pineapples in general). So when the only option is a pizza with pineapples, they'll remove all pineapples before handing me a slice. ( they don't have to do this but they do it like it's a form of habit haha) 

I can go on for hours and hours if I talk more of the countless times these people showed up for me with their unconditional love & care. Often times they'll tell me how grateful they are for our friendship but to me - they're gifts for my soul. We laughed and cried together, we've seen each other on different phases and versions, literally walked through life side by side, strengthened and tested by time. I love these humans so much 🥹

I truly won the lottery for having such soul tribe. ✨ 🤍

Always solid, no complaints there. But as any curry vet will tell you, that's just the absolute starting line for Japanese curry.

For example, CoCo Ichibanya's secret recipe is said to include a blend of different vegetables, fatty pork, and coffee sauteed and blended into a demiglaze to be mixed with the roux and spices.

My typical style is to use a box mix with plenty of grated garlic, ketchup (I usually use Heinz), worcestershire (Western style), hondashi or chicken broth, soy sauce for saltiness, and chu-no or tonkatsu sauce for fruit flavors and body.

1jgg4xa,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomenDatingOverForty/comments/1jgg4xa/why_we_dont_do_hiking_dates/,Why We Don't Do Hiking Dates,"You may have seen some of us on this sub discouraging women from accepting hiking dates and wondered why. Read on:

First off, I totally get why hiking dates might sound fun at first -- fresh air, beautiful scenery, and you get a chance to bond with your date over something active and outdoorsy. But honestly, if you're meeting someone from a dating app for the first time (or even the second or third or fourth, etc), hiking dates are a seriously risky choice.

Think about it: when you're out on a hike, you're often isolated, sometimes miles away from help or cell phone service, so if things start to go south -- whether it's because the guy you're with starts getting creepy or aggressive, or maybe because you realize halfway through the date that you're not feeling it -- it doesn't matter. You're stuck. It's not like you can politely excuse yourself and call an Uber or drive yourself home when you're deep in the woods or halfway up a mountain.

There are so many real life horror stories online that show just how dangerous hiking dates can be. Do a search on Reddit about this and you'll find tons of stories about women who've had terrifying experiences after agreeing to go hiking with someone they barely knew. Here's one that was just recently posted in the AskReddit sub; the thread is titled, [What's the most psycho date you have had on a dating app?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1jg24e5/what_was_the_most_psycho_date_you_have_had_on_a/)

u/Kamoe5 said:

> He wanted to go hiking on a first date I said no and we got coffee instead. He seemed like a normal guy but I had a weird feeling that something was off. Almost a year later he was arrested for murdering a girl he took hiking…

Terrifying, right? Kamoe5 was so smart to say No to that hiking date!  

And here's another story that you may have seen on the news about a young woman who not only traveled out of state to meet her online date for the first time (something else that we strongly advise against here on WDOF), she also agreed to go hiking with the man: 

[Woman Found Dead on Hiking Trail After First Date With Cop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG35VcePSro)

Neither of these women deserved to die, not on their first or any date! Remember: All it takes is once. You can be safe and sound for 15 first dates, but if your 16th date is on the trails and the guy turns out to be a rapist or murderer, it's game over for you. Just say no to hiking dates! Don't risk it.

Even if nothing violent or tragic happens, you could still end up uncomfortable and anxious while being stuck in an isolated place with a guy you don't know well or discover you don't like. Feeling uncomfortable after the guy gives you the ick or feeling unsafe for hours on end is just miserable and unnecessary. Your dates should ideally be casual, low-pressure, and in public places where you can easily leave if things aren't going well.

If you're really into hiking and want to share that experience with a potential partner, just save it for later dates once you've really gotten to know him better and are in a relationship. And even then, always let your friends or family members know exactly where you're going, who you're with, and when you expect to return. Better yet, try to make it a double date or a group hike so you're never completely alone.

Remember: your safety should always come first! Stick to coffee shops, restaurants, parks with plenty of people around—anywhere public where you have control over your situation and can comfortably exit if needed. Hiking can be awesome, but it's definitely not worth risking your life on a date with someone you've only just met online.",10,1742561672.0,WomenDatingOverForty,3,0.92,False

I noticed she was interested in me (she asked for my name, she asked if I was going to be there the next week, she invited me for a ride in her car, etc.), and we had a date one week ago.

It went well at first, but it was so awkward. We went to a coffee shop, and the table was so small that we had very little space. I had never been on a date before, so I was really nervous. I tried to make eye contact the whole time (but not in an awkward way), and we talked a little about our lives. However, I eventually ran out of things to say. When we left the coffee shop, we walked for about 15 minutes, and then I left her at the train station.

The farewell was a bit awkward because she told me it was getting late and that I didn’t need to wait for the train to arrive. So, I hugged her and later texted her that I had fun. I don’t know if I gave her the impression that I was a boring guy or that she was boring me.

The thing is, after a week, I’m going to text her and express my feelings because I’ve been waking up at 5 AM every single day and can’t sleep well because of this. This is the message I’m going to send her in about 5 hours:

Hi Maria, how are you?

I was thinking of waiting until April to text you since I know you're busy with your thesis and didn’t want to bother you, but I wanted to apologize because I feel like I messed up when we met, and I didn’t express myself well. I didn’t want to let too much time pass before telling you how I feel.

I really enjoyed talking to you that day, I mean it. I never meant to say I didn’t want to grab a drink, I just had in mind taking a walk with you to ease my nerves and express myself better. I feel like I messed up and maybe bored you or made you think you were boring me, but honestly, I loved the time we spent together and everything you shared with me.

I also want to apologize for ignoring you at the climbing gym. Please don’t think you bother me or that I don’t like you—it’s just that I didn’t know what to say, and I don’t feel comfortable in big groups.

I’ve been thinking about you a lot, and I just want to be honest—I really like you, and I’d love to get to know you better. You seem like such a wonderful and interesting person, and I honestly don’t want to lose you. Sorry for saying all this over text, but I was too nervous in person and didn’t know how to express it. Talking to people isn’t my strong suit, but for you, I’m making a huge effort because I truly like you.

No matter your response, I feel relieved to finally say this, even though it makes me really nervous. If you don’t feel the same way, that’s okay—just be honest. I don’t want any awkwardness between us. Just take it as a compliment and as a reminder that someone thinks you’re amazing. :)

Looking forward to your reply, whatever it may be. Sending you a big hug, and I hope your thesis is going well!

She said to me she eats everything in moderation (not fast food) and keeps her Gaviscon always in her bag. She calls herself the “Queen of Gaviscon”. Sometimes she takes PPI but she is not a fan of it. She is the life of the party, she has many friends, always doing activities, always occupied and always full of plans. She says that her stomach hurts almost everyday but she became used to it. It’s everything she has ever known. She did a PhD, became a teacher at the university, likes reading, traveling and helping others. Since she left the university she keeps herself occupied with charity. She drinks alcohol but she doesn’t drink coffee. She stopped smoking years ago, she says when she was young she would enjoy life without thinking too much about her condition. She bought an automatic adjustable bed for acid reflux and she says this saved her life. I could tell you so many more things. Listen, last month she went on a road trip by herself to Spain and Portugal to visit all her friends in these countries. We live in France. She went to Poland 2 months ago. She is my hero! People, hang on! May God and all the spiritual forces ease your pain and help you live a beautiful life. GI issues are complicated, I know it very well, unfortunately. Let’s keep the sparkle.

I used to just rinse my filter with cold water as I thought this was enough. Hell no. For some reason, it being hot and boiling absolutely changed my pour drawdown speed. This has resulted in a much more full flavor profile and my coffee is amazing again. Why does this happen?

Sometimes I think this insane coffee culture we have with people openly admitting and celebrating addition to a substance and the consumption multiple cups a day can't be regular. This is the kind of culture that's engineered, not the kind that springs up by itself from normal people. And sure the coffee industry makes a ton of money but that's not what I'm interested in talking about. Personally I've never noticed any effects in myself from coffee other than my tiredness going away. But I'm sure it's different for other people or else it could be doing things to me I don't know about (I don't drink it a lot, only about once a week).

I have seen a few studies that say a single cup of coffee reduces cerebral blood flow by up to 40%, which sounds mind-boggling and you'd think would be a bad thing, but anywhere I see this study it is simply stated as a fact, not negatively nor positively. Does anyone have more information on this particular fact? If it's true, how can that possibly be okay for the brain?

All in all I don't observe many effects from coffee consumption but maybe that's because it's so omnipresent that whatever effects it gives have been accepted as normal.

**Being Unapologetic in your views. Speaking up when the situation asks for it. (SR + Addiction removal) gives you this ability.**

  
**I went from being a hardcore conformist with a sheep mentality, people pleaser for 3 decades of my life to the biggest jerk in a mere 9 months of strict SR + dopamine fasting.** 

The best part about it? It made me *autonomous. The puppy dog inside of me evolved  into a Lone Wolf.*

Without a backbone, we are low testosterone, unconfident, codependent like dogs. I don't want to call people out but I've seen way more posts here than I could count saying  
""Its been \_\_ days and I haven't received any female attention, Is everyone exaggerating?""  
  
 Women prefer dominant sovereign leaders like **Wolves.** 

**Not a puppy Dog who listens to all her whims and commands rolls over and asks for belly rubs, when she says jump he asks ""How High?"".**

**They like backbone and courage.** 

Caring what others might think = FEAR.

And Fear castrates men. Courage liberates them.

Women talk about confidence being the #1 trait they find attractive. Its not confidence its courage. Courage is what separates an androgenous blob with no backbone from a man. 

Just like Steel Rods make a building stand several 100 meters in height against strong winds.

**Every man feels scared. Courageous men just overcome the fear and act despite it. Don't be a fool though and go into extremes. Use your head (the right head).**

Confidence is just being courageous 24/7.

Fear neuters men. 

**I'd rather be hated for who I am than put on a false pretense and be liked for an act. People respect their enemies more than they respect a nice guy.**

The serum of courage is semen. You are squeezing that liquid courage out.



I don't conform to societal norms anymore, neither do I let anyone brainwash me. I stand **firm** in my views. I don't impose it on others and don't let others impose it on me. I make up my own mind about things and have become very rational. 

I'd rather take and give the truth than be nice and accommodating for someone's feelings.

As a result of forming a very strong identity and SR. 

Pardon my cockiness but the fact is : Not only Women but men are ~~attracted to me~~  respect me. I went from never having any social life to an abundance of high quality friendships both male and females.

Its not just SR, you have to work with all that energy. Stop all the bad habits too. Transmute it all. Sitting on your PS5 while waiting for a long SR streak is not how its done. 

When people see you are an accolade collecting machine they want to be associated with you. They are surprised every 3 months by how much I've changed. Now I know they have their own interests in mind but that's how the world works. 

You stack small achievements upon small achievements and you slowly start becoming a popular guy. And guess what a popular guy has? The pick of the litter.

Let me tell you all a secret: Its commonly said that Men are pigs, they are very sexually overt. Only thing is women are exactly the same as men. There is just a slight difference: Women are pickier. 

Once you become popular due to accolades in your context (School, university, job, workplace, Instagram etc) you'll see how women can be discreet and sexually hound you just like men do to women.

In fact the majority of you have already seen how girls at your school were into the Popular jerks and athletes. Its exactly the same after school too:

Trigger warning : >!Instagram Models, high status women discreetly having entanglements with Male celebrities, NBA athletes, filming OF content with male sex workers.!<

Its exactly the same behavior we saw in school but at a global scale. Yet, we men are blind to it.

Once I crossed a certain threshold of attractiveness - (Simple obvious things like bodyfat %, grooming, muscles, Popularity due to achievements) ~~even~~ specially committed women started initiating small talk, touching me, talking about my fitness program. 

**Do not pedestalize someone else and dehumanize yourself.**

Treat and respect everyone according to their behavior not according to what's between their legs.

Now, I am a regular guy never had an attractive bone in my body my whole life. Its miraculous how much muscles + low body fat + wardrobe + grooming can increase your attractiveness.

When you stop customizing your virtual avatar in-game, you start customizing your IRL avatar. Its how men work. 

Don't work on Faux achievements on your Xbox, work on real life achievements. They is literally an epidemic of attractive men with a level head out there. Spoil yourself with sexual choice. See for yourself. Put in the work.



There are downsides to having a strong identity too. Some people will start being envious. That envy is actually admiration for you they cannot accept, so it transmutes to jealousy. 

A jealous person always appreciates you, secretly wants what you have. But all they see are the results, they don't know I've given up all my addictions, I've lost my mind to SR and transmutation. All they see is a lucky guy and they want what you have for themselves. They hate the spotlight of attention on you. Heck, with time even you hate the attention on you. It gets old really fast.

You start small. You win the small negotiations against your own reptilian brain. Those small negotiations stack up slowly. Within a month, those internal victories start showing through muscles, grades, your skin, face, hair etc.

People start noticing these things. But we are not doing it for the people, are we? **The attention from the external is just a milestone**. Notice it, be grateful for it and move on, keep going. We don't stop at every milestone, we keep moving until we reach the goal. Don't get attached when it oscillates between no attention and attention. Everything in the universe is vibrating. Winters, summer, fall. Women menstruation, animal hibernation, day and night.

Everything is oscillating. Don't get caught up here because you like summer more than winters. Observe, Detach and move on. Don't get out of your car, grab the milestone indicator and stay there.

*There's tons of infinitely better things waiting to happen to you.* 

***Replace your smartphone with a dumb phone.***

*This is literally the best thing you can do for yourself.*  
  
**Everyone is stunlocked by Instagram, tiktok. These are attention grenades that have a self perpetuating chain stun combo affect. You get paralyzed physically FOR HOURS without having a sense of time. SR helps you break that stunlock. It leaves you feeling empty by the end of the day.**

Now I am guilty of frequenting reddit because I like SR, stopgaming and decaf subreddits. But I give myself a hall pass because I am trying to genuinely help people and brush up my writing skills.

**DOMINATE YOURSELF FIRST. ONLY THEN CAN YOU DOMINATE YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES AND INCREASE YOUR INFLUENCE. Most people are here for women and thats fine. Whatever the reason, give 200% effort and do justice to yourself.**

TRIGGER WARNING AGAIN:

>!Women would rather date a trashcan with a backbone than a respectable nice guy. I've seen guys with muscles who are 6' 3"" with 12% bodyfat struggle with women because they are too scared and conform too much.!<

>!We are nice guys who are neutered. We will agree to anything and everything as long as something is quenching our lust for dopamine. We have no self-respect or dignity. No wonder we don't feel good about ourselves. We will sell ourselves and our semen for momentary pleasure in a heartbeat. Our going rate is very low.!<

Your Body reflects your PHYSICAL STATE.

You feel hungry because of a lack of PHYSICAL FOOD in your stomach

You feel lonely and desperate because of a lack of dopamine, micronutrients and Semen in your body.

Your Testosterone and micronutrients are constantly used up to make more Semen, there is no T left for the body for other functions when you are releasing it frequently.

Why would the body help you make more muscles when its getting fake sex with women who have fake body parts designed to fool your reptilian brain through the screen. Body is getting food, getting sex, getting air and water. Now its dormant. BUT THE MIND KNOWS. THE MIND KNOWS SOMETHING IS WRONG. IT TELLS YOU. IT IS DEPRESSED.

SR makes EFFORT FEEL GOOD. SR makes living FEEL GOOD. Euphoria. No headaches, deep sleep, you wake up really energetic, you sleep full of energy. Life becomes easier. Work becomes easier.

Take the initiative.

**I'm no doctor but Chances are SR and Dopamine Fasting will fix your depression.**

Now I don't know about you but my testosterone has increased because of SR. There are anecdotes in SR community that it increases T levels manifold and I've felt it too.



SR and Testosterone is the fluid of masculinity. The Very essence of MANLINESS.

When women transition to men, you know what they are given? TESTOSTERONE. 

Testosterone MAKES WOMEN MEN. 

Estrogen MAKES MEN WOMEN.

High Body FAT INSIDE YOU INCREASES ESTROGEN (Estradiol).  Google it. Don't be lazy. Research it and confirm it. Don't take my word for it.

  
Fitness and low bodyfat percentage is essential as a man. Take your masculinity back.

  
***""No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training""***  
***\~Socrates***



Every soap, every product, every chemical, every toothpaste, every processed food is attacking testosterone in your body.

Everything you consume with your eyes, is attacking your ability to produce HGH, to sleep deep, and your attentive ability. Blue light, LED light, Coffee, Social media, your water supply, gaming, plastic in products, plastic in food items everything is attacking either your Attention Span or Testosterone or both.

ALL OF THIS IS ACCUMULATING AND FUCKING YOU OVER. 

**The law of accumulation is how you improve AND ALSO HOW EVERY BAD HABIT SNEAKS UP ON YOU.**

GUARD YOURSELF. Guard your mind. Become aware. Become diligent. Become Proactive. 

*Everything and everyone is out to make you lazy and depressed. Keep you occupied in bad habits and giving you fake achievement medals.* 

They don't want any Revolutions. 

They don't want people growing a Backbone. 

Having a backbone is a threat to the slavery system they are building. 

Testosterone and SR is the precursor to BECOMING HARD MEN WHO WILL BRING THE GOOD TIMES BACK AGAIN.

1jgfmdk,https://i.redd.it/ermc4hwmd1qe1.jpeg,I replaced my BBE´s built in grinder with a Mazzer Philos,"Mainly posting this so people in my recent position, thinking about making this change, have a resource to rely on. That being said, please let me know if you have any specific questions or things i should have a look at. Has anybody else made this jump?

I decided on the i200D burrs as drink filter coffee 75% of the time. Love a good espresso though, that´s why i chose the Philos as an all-purpose grinder. I definitely will get the i189D as well in the future.

I have had the Philos for three days and only used it with one type of beans: a medium dark roast from a local roaster, medium quality (7€/250g) as well, so keep that in mind.
I do think about making a more thorough comparison post when i´ve had the chance to dial in some more beans, let me know if anyone would be interested in that.

My thoughts so far:

Taste: kind of similar actually. The Philos did manage a more round and balanced flavor though. More sweetness, less bitterness, less harshness, more pleasant acidity. But no huge difference. Taste-wise, the BBE´s grinder is quite capable with medium-dark roasts. I expect this to change with lighter roasts.

Texture: you might read online that the i200D burrs produce thin, watery shots. My experience definitely differed. The shots were silky and medium-bodied, much more pleasing than with the BBE´s grinder.

Consistency: night and day. ~0,1g retention vs ~1g even with single dosing mod. Nothing more to say. Most of the frustration of inconsistent dialing in is just gone.

Would i recommend the change so far? Definitely, if you have the money. 1000€ is a lot of money and i am pretty sure there are grinders that will give you similar results for a fraction of the cost. Especially if your only priority is espresso. For me, build quality, expected longevity and the ability do make fantastic filter coffee as well justify the price point.",41,1742560034.0,espresso,6,0.96,False

1jgflzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Breeze_MentalHealth/comments/1jgflzr/how_do_you_keep_a_gratitude_journal_and_why_do_it/,How do you keep a gratitude journal and why do it?,"One of the easiest and most powerful ways to improve mental health is to keep a gratitude journal. Every time you feel grateful for something in your life, write it down in a journal. 

Gratitude journaling can help shift your focus from what's going wrong to what’s going right, eventually boosting mood, reducing stress, and even improving sleep. 

What's more, writing gratitudes daily allows you to stop focusing on criticizing yourself and makes you more aware of small joys in daily life.

Author *The Thank-You Project: Cultivating Happiness One Letter of Gratitude at a Time* Nancy Davis Kho set a high target of writing fifty thank-you letters to everyone in her life, and she discovered that the habit helped her overcome difficult obstacles in life.

If you’re new to this self-care ritual, here’s a simple step-by-step guide.

Choose where you want to journal. It can be a physical notebook or a digital journaling app like the Breeze app. Or you can choose whatever feels easiest for you.

Then, set a routine and stick to it. Writing consistently is key here, or you will eventually ditch it. Pick a time that fits into your daily routine, morning or night. 

The best way is to write 3–5 things daily. These can be big or small, from a major life event to enjoying a good cup of coffee. Everything matters.

Be specific. Instead of “I’m grateful for my friends,” try “I’m grateful for my friends' support when I had a tough day, and they called me when I got home.” Add right there why it matters—it will deepen the emotional impact.

Feel stuck and don't know what to write? Use journaling prompts. Questions like “What made me smile today?” or “What’s something I take for granted?” can help when you’re not sure how to start.

Every week, read through past entries; the results will reinforce positive thinking and progress.

If you want to make gratitude journaling even easier, apps like [Breeze](https://breeze-wellbeing.com/): self-discovery app provide guided prompts, mood tracking, and habit reminders to keep you consistent. It is a great way to practice gratitude every day without having to worry about starting from scratch.Tell us three things you are thankful for today in the comments!",1,1742560001.0,Breeze_MentalHealth,0,1.0,False

1jgfjrs,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhiteWolfRPG/comments/1jgfjrs/a_small_metaguide_through_the_concept_of_a/,A small (meta)guide through the concept of a unified World of Darkness,"Since it's a topic I often see come up, I’m offering a small guide for those who want to reconstruct a unified cosmology of the World of Darkness (WOD).   
**Of course, this post is not directed at those who firmly believe that such a concept cannot exist.**

The approach of the writers changes with each edition. During th**e first and second editions, we have integrated and cross-splat writing**, where every book clearly refers to other splats. For example, in the *Book of Wyrm*, you find the Giovanni, the Sabbat, the Technocracy, and so on, and there are many manuals designed to be cross-over (*Under a Blood Red Moon*, *Rage Across Russia*, *Dark Alliance*, *Chaos Factor*, *A World of Darkness* 1st and 2nd edition, *Ends of Empire*...).

With the ***Revised*** **edition, a phase begins where many authors step back from the unified oWod** concept to focus on greater thematic purity. This is the time for the *Storyteller's Handbook* and many other manuals that, while mentioning other supernatural beings, become more cautious about creating unified cosmologies. The uncertainty about how each supernatural views the others increases. The editorial line clearly stated in the *Storyteller's Handbook* presents many exceptions (*Blood Treachery*, *Book of Madness*, *Dead Magic*, *Stargazer Revised*, the various *Changing Breeds*), but also *Kindred of the East*, *Hunter: The Reckoning*, and *Mummy: The Resurrection*, which, although being minor titles, are deeply designed for a cross-splat universe. At the same time, the *Dark Ages* editorial line continues the second edition’s tradition of incorporated cross-overs, to the point that certain manuals, like *The British Isles*, are approached from the perspective of all the splats.

**In 2002,** ***Demon: The Fallen*** arrives, which is not only the last splat to be added to the pile but, what makes it hated by many, **presents a unified cosmology from the corebook that touches on every single splat.** There’s room for everyone, from Gaia, who is revealed to be the Archangel of the Sixth House, to the Imbued of *Hunter*, who are revealed to be the last two angels of God, to a very detailed history of how the Skinlands were created.  
***Demon*** **proposes the so-called** ***Layers of Reality*** **mechanism, which is later adopted and adapted by the writers of** ***Mage: The Ascension*** **through the theory of the** ***Fractured Cosmos***, which you can find summarized here:

[https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Fractured\_Cosmos](https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Fractured_Cosmos)

This ties in with the approach of ***Werewolf*****, which heavily focuses on the concept of the dissociation of the realities and the identities of the Wyrm and the Weaver**.  
As the time of the end approaches, cosmologies begin to merge, to the point that ***Demon*** **provides, through the cryptic** ***Days of Fire*****, the most complete unified cosmogonic document of the World of Darkness.** The **various manuals of the** ***Time of Judgment*** **once again open to cross-overs** and also deal with how to integrate elements of other cosmologies into their respective apocalypses. In some cases, key metaplot elements are redirected to other cosmologies (**like the revelation that Caine is another name for the** ***Eater-of-Souls*** **in** ***Apocalypse*****, or that Caine is also the first Mage in history, and the killing of Abel created the fracture of reality and the consensus in** ***Ascension***).

The mechanism of the layers of reality is explained in this way in Demon the Fallen

““What was Paradise like?” Noah folded his hands and frowned.   
“You’re not very well equipped to understand it,” he said at last. “I don’t say that to be insulting. The world was fundamentally different back then. It was… more complex. Richer. It had layers that are simply absent, now.”   
“Layers?”   
“Yes… consider this coffee we’re drinking. It’s only coffee, right? It’s not anything else?”   
“I guess not.”   
“**In the uncorrupted world, this coffee could also exist simultaneously as a song or an aesthetic idea or even a sentient and helpful creature. Different things on different layers, all equally real, all similar, but each discrete** — even while they were simultaneously experienced.”   
Seeing Matthew’s expression, he continued ""I’ll give you a more relevant example. The first people: Were they Adam and Eve, a woman and a man, or were they the evolved descendents of apes?”   
“They were a woman and a man, as the Bible says.”   
“Correct. But they were also a multitude of ape descendents. **The universe was made in seven days, on one level, but that same span of time was billions of years on another level**. “Or consider the Angels of the Firmament. On some levels of reality they were conveying the life-giving breath of the Maker on a purely scientific level — they were, literally were, the process by which solar energy striking simple carbon molecules agitated them into forms of ever increasing complexity, until they became organic molecules, then primitive single-celled animals, then nucleated cells and so on, up to and including dogs, cats and humans. But at the same time they were crouching over the mouths of newly sculpted creatures of all types, breathing into their mouths to animate them.”   
“Are you talking about metaphor?”   
Gaviel chuckled. “Not yet, no. These contrary things really were simultaneously true in the young cosmos. It makes no sense to you because you’re used to living in this, the singular world. **But once you accept the idea of the multiple world, it clears up a lot of the problems you humans have with faith, miracles, the Divine Architect**—”

So in a **world made of broken worlds** you could have **the curious situation where language and technology developed thanks to human ingenuity, or they were tools of the Weaver, or a gift from Lucifer**. You could have the curious situation where there are many subjects with similar roles who are prisoners somewhere, and their imprisonment and anger are somehow destroying reality. It could be Cain, imprisoned by his own anger and his disappointment with God; it could be the Earthbound, imprisoned on Earth and furious over the failure of the rebellion; it could be the Neverborn, in their prisons within the labyrinth, or it could be the Wyrm, imprisoned by the Weaver. In all cases, something monstrous and ancient is held captive by a structure, and this thing causes terrible reverberations in the history of the World of Darkness.

I know I’m so early and in the thick of it right now, but I was wondering how people here were able to maintain consistent energy levels amidst the first few months. I work 8-5 and have been getting up for the “morning shift” to feed her/watch her at 5:30am. 

I used to use zyn (nicotine pouches) very heavily but quit about a month before this little guy came to into the world. I’m so happy I quit but they did at least provide that little artificial jolt of energy. I also noticed im just drinking way more coffee than usual to try to regulate and spike energy, which doesn’t feel good/is causing big crashes.

I know my situation is not unique- looking for dad’s advice on how to keep energy levels at least a little normal with a newborn and full time work.

MMC stalks the FMC. He breaks into her house when she’s not at home and when she’s sleeping. Touches her stuff, watches her, and takes his time getting to somno/dub-con/non-con, if he even gets to that at all. 

Dual narration because I want to hear a lot about the MMC’s thought process and obsession. 

Contemporary preferred.

No highschool/college setting (working adults, please). 

I have no triggers. No sex or lots of it, doesn’t matter. I’m more interested in the slow burn tension. 

I’m open to recommendations outside the DR genre, just really thirsty for stalker/obsession thrillers. 

I read a DR book a long time ago about a woman who works at a coffee shop and the son of the owners of the house she’s renting uses his key to the house to watch her while she sleeps. She gets increasingly paranoid. I think his calling card was leaving a piece of fruit on the kitchen counter. Does anyone know that title?

1jgfgpr,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1jgfgpr/if_i_could_only_stay_asleep/,If I could only stay asleep.,"Hey everyone

I'm on my umpteenth night with no sleep, fatigue throughout the day, visually haggard, sore, irritable and yeah, not great. I have been drinking a LOT of coffee recently. Up to 8 cups a day. On purpose. And it has been a nightmare. Previously I had been caffeine free for about 3 months and sleeping like a log every single night. Feeling steady, strong and in control. 

Recently, one of my all time favorite directors passed away. David Lynch was 79 when his emphysema (amid the California fires) caught up with him. 

David was known to drink up to 20 cups of coffee a day. Of course, in light of his passing I decided to revisit my old favorite series Twin Peaks. Shortly there after I was pursing my own ""damn fine cup of coffee"" to commemorate the great auteur. 

I decided ""stuff it, if that guy can have 20 in a day and still be fully functional, I can have one. Or maybe two. and who knows... maybe a few carefully timed morning coffees will help the David Lynch magic rub off on me??""

Coffee seems to have this aura around it. This mystery. The muse of a myriad of artists, thinkers and innovators. It is the drink that brought Europe into the Age of Enlightenment. These and all of those illusive ""health benefits"" that are dangled in front of me, yet, when I succumb to the temptations and think to myself ""it'll be different this time"" I'm greeted with the same old hollow despair. 

So off I go, back to my old ways. Figuring if I have a couple of cups before 11am that's PLENTY of time for the caffeine to leave my system and give me a good nights sleep. 

Wrong. 

I basically just lay there. Shutting my eyes was little more than a token gesture of sleep. Very little rest came of it. 

So what happens next? I decide to call caffeine's bluff... spend the next several weeks drinking as much coffee as I can. Surely if you drink gallons of the stuff, you can then taper off to a couple of cups in the morning and your body will have built up some kind of tolerance?

Not so much. 

I punished my body with excessive caffeine for 3 solid weeks. Week four I decide to wind it back to 2 cups first thing in the morning. 

Still no sleep. 

I'm more anxious and irritable than I was before it seems, and no matter how tired I get, sleep seems to be merely a token gesture. 

  
This was a ridiculous experiment in hindsight. I just... really like coffee. I love the culture, the shiny machines, the morning ritual. Ever since I was a child I loved the smell of it. In my teens I learned how great you can feel from drinking it. Emboldened, inspired and living life on my own terms. Only a sip away. That was the dream.

1jgfgey,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jgfgey/my_boyfriend_31m_and_i_29f_are_spending_less_time/,My boyfriend (31M) and I (29F) are spending less time together ever since I moved in with him and it’s giving me anxiety,"

I have been in a relationship with my bf (31M) for 2 years. I moved into his apartment 9 months ago. I have noticed a shift in our relationship ever since moving in and especially the last 4 months. Prior to us living together, my bf would always be open to doing things together, like going for walks, cafés and making dinner together. We don’t really have any shared hobbies, but it felt like that wasn’t a problem due to the fact that we always did different activities together. 

My bf loves gaming and that was never a problem for me. Prior to me moving in, he was sitting in front of the computer a couple of times a week. This changed about 4 months ago, when he started gaming daily for 8-9 hours at a time. We talk less and less and he rarely initiate to anything anymore. I would suggest going for walks which ends up with him saying he don’t want to do that or saying «only if it lasts for 5 minutes». 

I’m an introvert and love spending time by myself. I don’t mind not doing stuff together every day. I love my friends too. However, I love quality time together which I have expressed to him on three different occasions this year. He says that he will try and plan more stuff together and prioritize dating. Last month he booked a table at a restaurant, but then we don’t really hang out during the rest of the week and he never plans anything after that. I am usually the one initiating to hang out. 

He has never been a tidy person so whenever he’s gaming, I usually clean and tidy, make dinner etc. I have felt more frustrated with this due to the fact that we both work full time and I have said how much I appreciate him cleaning up after himself. He said that he would try to get better, but I have seen zero improvements. He usually tidies more for about 1-2 weeks and then it’s back to old habits. 

Prior to us living together, my bf would always shower, shave and tidy his apartment. The last six months I have noticed that he probably showers 1-2 a week and barely shave. He don’t even brush his teeth everyday. He smells bad sometimes and I feel uncomfortable when I sleep next to him at night. I feel like not having sex with him anymore due to this. I always shower before bed and put on perfume, to make him feel good. He has ADHD so I don’t know if he just forgets or needs reminders, but I feel like that is not really my job when it comes to taking care of personal hygiene.

I have asked him many times if everything’s alright and he says he’s happy in this relationship and that I make him better, but I don’t see any consistent effort or planning anymore. I have expressed to him that I don’t feel seen anymore and he says he Will do better and only game when I’m not home, but I don’t feel like he’s trying. If I don’t suggest or plan dates, we probably would never do anything. I am worried sick about the future and I’m questioning marrying him or even having kids with him which are things we have planned. I have felt super anxious for 3 weeks now and my sleeping pattern is really bad due to overthinking. I feel like I’m talking to deaf ears.

We are both usually working at different times during the week, which makes me want to make time for us at least a couple of times a week, even if it’s just drinking coffee together in the morning. My bf is going on vacation with his friends for a month starting tomorrow and I have never been more excited to spend time away from him which makes me feel bad.

I’m wondering how I’m going to communicate this to him again and if it is possible to fix it before it’s too late?
