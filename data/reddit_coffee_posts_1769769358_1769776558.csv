1qr44o3,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1qr44o3/boyfriend_m28_and_me_f26_having_regular_arguments/,Boyfriend (M28) and me (F26) having regular arguments during our first week moving in,"Assume girlfriend Person X wrote this until the boyfriend person Y says he is writing.

Person X: I have just recently moved into a flat with my boyfriend. On our 2nd day moving in, he said that his mum was going to have a coffee with him after work, he asked me if this was ok, I said yes. There was no explicit time he said it was going to take, however being our 2nd night together and the fact that he said we may also go to the cinema that night, his mum got him his medication and some housewarming gifts for our bed, and he made his way to her rather than her coming to our area for a coffee, he took a train and bus, had coffee with his mum round her house, then his mum offered to play a card game with him. Meanwhile at the flat we had moved into, my boyfriend had forgoten his keys although I have a spair and he was out, which meant he couldnt get back in unless i let him. i was worried that if i bang my head people counslt get to me quick enough. Him and his mum instead of going to a coffee shop, went back to their home, my boyfriend didnt text me to see if i was ok or give me any notification of the time they were going to spend. Keeping in mind that his mum has said she doesnt think its a good idea he should move in with me and his sister disapproves of our relationship. 

side note: his mother has wished us well, even in privately to my boyfriend, not tried to stop us from moving in together, got us gifts for the home and she is generally pleasent with me. 

I ring my boyfriend and explain i am hurt by this behaviour and want to break up. my bpd got triggered, i packed my bags, and i told him when hed get in that i want to discuss getting out of the tenancy contract. 

While he was at his mums house, I broke my own tablet case in anger. after calling him to express my hurt he stopped the card game with his mum and came home immediately. 

Person y: I felt surprised and hurt by her responses. she was extremely angry, upset and hurt. She said that I was selfish, didn’t respect her and have always displayed selfishness throughout our relationship. I felt panicky and worried and punished for her feelings. I felt over blamed for her feelings, and that changing plans with my mum didn’t warrant such a hurtful overwhelming response. I agreed that forgetting my keys was irresponsible and I would make an effort to remember them in the future. 

I felt pretty homesick and enjoyed spending an about 3 hours with my mum. I would have been ok if person X did this, but I understand that the first week or so after leaving the nest for the first time is sentimentally important. For both of us this is our first time moving out of our homes together.

Person x: The following day, his mother is texting him a lot through the day on our 3rd / 4th day having conversations with him and both of them wanting to arrange a phone chat, this is also considering its my first week moving in with my partner, and he will see his mum Saturday. I was going to visit my family on Saturday and said his mum can come round to our flat, my boyfriend said theres a possibility that they could end up in the area that he lives in again, and that if he did he could looking for a sofa / 2nd hand sofa in his original living area.

I come home after me and my boyfriend have seen a gory movie I didnt like. He left the cinema early for me and we went home, we walked into the kitchen, to make sausages and potatos which we agrees to cook earlier in the day. I started to wash the potatos to be helpful to my boyfriend, he then asks me if he can cut his potatos the way he likes them, I have a knife and plate in hand to cut the potatos for us, he then brings a chopping board out and starts to cut the potatos in essientially the same way I would have, he says, how would you like your potatos cut I can do it for you, just so you know i'm not going to have all of these potatos. 

Person Y: we didnt pre plan how we would cook this together. I feel that my partner leaves a very large number of daily responsibilities and decisions to me, which i am happy to take on, but sometimes i feel there is an environment where I can take charge and sometimes like here i step on her toes.

  
We know there's a lot here. We'd love outside input on this because we can't mutually settle our arguments and learn from them. We keep agreeing to disagree. Are we being unfair to each other?",1,1769776170.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

New symptom for me, curious if anyone else has had this: midcycle bleeding and back pain. Arrives on Day 14 (but I don’t ovulate, haven’t in years, I have anovulatory cycles) and looks like tiny clots/tissue, almost like red coffee grounds, little specs in the toilet. When I wipe it’s very light red. Barely anything on the liner. I will note that my cycle before this seemed on the lighter end so maybe I just had more to shed?   

This has happened to me for about 3 (non consecutive) cycles. Seems random. This month, it was preceded by breast tenderness, joint stiffness, and an overall feeling of inflammation. Now that it’s here, it’s just low back pain/crampiness.

1qr4159,https://i.redd.it/vfpuy1ucchgg1.jpeg,Maniac,"Wasn’t sure where to post this, but since we all trauma bonded with an excellent sense of humour, I figured there must be people here who can either relate or at least understand if only to a degree.

I’m sure some of you are familiar with Netflix’s Maniac. The deeper I fall into that hole, the more I relate to the show. Yesterday I realised the show perfectly pictures my life through multiple characters at the same time.

First time watching it, when Owen says ""it's that I don't matter"" it broke me completely into pieces. 

My good days are Annie days - we’re making it work. It’s shit, but stable. Grief, guilt, and the most ridiculous fear of abandonment. We dress, wash, and work because we have to. We don’t eat, tho - who the fuck needs food these days? Trauma is like a printing press for the mind. We’re addicted to things we shouldn’t touch. We avoid people despite the overwhelming loneliness. We replay the same stories in our heads on a daily basis. We love the mind torture. We’re detached from reality and simply don’t want to be vulnerable with anyone or anything. We obsess over people because we crave care and love, but we’ll never let anyone come close enough or even see us that way. We cry for a couple of hours in front of the computer screen at work, then go to the kitchen to make coffee and dance like the world is a perfect place and our heart has never bled.

Then the bad days come. Just like Owen. Battling something our whole life, something that seems like it will never go away. Loneliness. Feeling worthless. Watching scumbags be treated better than we ever have been by people we don’t even care about. We’re surrounded by everything and yet have nothing. Never able to fit in. Never accepted. Always different, always incorrect, wrong, not good enough. There’s a constant confusion we try to lessen, until we give up because there’s nothing we can do. We isolate ourselves, but we crave connection, real, deep connection, just to feel something other than the delusions created by our own mind. 

Our mind always finds a reason behind people’s bad behaviour and somehow it’s always hurtful. The world has always been evil and nothing will change that. We are meant to be alienated and alone.
The saddest part of all this is the feeling that there will never be anyone who truly accepts us. People want to mould us into their favourite version of a person, our body, our mind, until we’re impersonating someone else entirely. Someone they don’t even really know. And we let them, because we just want to be loved. We just want to matter.

So the question lingers: is it better to keep living in this dull, unrelenting pain that we know will last forever or to end it all and finally feel nothing? No fear, no longing, no disappointment, just silence.  That silence feels tempting you know, simply because it would be different from this. The problem is that we still want to BE. But we don't want to live like this and there are no exits to allows us to love better. ",2,1769775892.0,TrollCoping,0,1.0,False

In the 2 years me and her have been together I had never met him due to them having a conflict a few years before we met resulting in both of them catching assault charges in their own home. As im typing this out it seems very obvious I shouldn't have let him move in with us. Regardless of all the signs she vouched for him and I agreed to give him a home, and for the next two months till a couple of days ago he hasn't gotten a job, eats food like hes still in jail and would drink a gallon of milk daily if we'd let him. He was running us out of food constantly to where we'd have to buy some groceries almost twice a week, so it has been very stressful financially. There has been two times in the last 3 weeks where the cops were called over due to his behavior, the first time he was yelling at her over a disagreement and telling her he was going to kill himself and start cutting again, he has scars on his wrist ive seen from when he has cut before. It ended in him coming out of his room and looking like he was charging her to hurt her and he just wanted a hug supposedly. The second time, they went to the gym while I was working, they both have tch-a pens and hers was dead, and she asked to take a hit off his pen and he proceeded to loose his shit over it and ran away from the car before even going inside to work out. He started texting/calling saying he was going to kill himself and get hit by a train. So she called the cops to look for him, when I got home we both went out to look for him only to then realize once we got home he came back locked himself in his room while we were out. This was Friday and he had been holed up in his room with no contact with either of us till Tuesday.

Wednesday comes around

I woke a 6-3 job and when I have my routine when i come home, everything was fine till 9pm when I should have been going to bed for the next day at work. I was playing a game on my computer that involved blackjack/21 and he wanted to play the game so I got off my computer and pulled iut the cards. She had never played so I gave her the basics of this is the what each card represents and youre trying to make a total of 21. We started playing and he went over and for whatever reason decided to put his cards into a ""folding pile"" that just so happened to be in the spot where I had my face up card, I started getting upset because i was trying to tell him to stop putting his cards there cuz thats where my cards are and he was either not understanding or just doing it intentionally, in the middle of this he was trying to explain some rules ive never hear of before to her and she was getting frustrated cuz she didnt understand what he was saying, so she said she didnt wanna play anymore which was understandable because he was being a little pushy and made no sense. He stormed to his room out over a card game and started screaming at her and he had grabbed a knife at some point and was making a sound I didnt recognize and she was outside smoking real quick. When she came back she instantly knew it was a knife and he was going to cut himself so we went to his room to tell him to put it down and give it to us, which he didn't. So we busted in and went to grab it out of his hands and I got a finger cut a little bit not bad though, then he ran away. After looking back at the situation it was very dangerous of us to do that and we should have called the cops at that point. Then he came back for round 2 like 5 minutes later and she was looking any knives in his room till he tried to shut her out so I helped her get back in, low-key busted the door frame a little so the metal plate that holds it shut came out, then he started trying to throw punches at me and hit me in the face. Then I stepped away to hopefully help her de-escalate things and he flipped over our living room coffee table and ran away again. So... we called the cops, and just to mention he kicked both of my cars and left a dent in the 2006 Volkswagen Jetta which is in my dad's name that was lent to me so we would have two vehicles.

TLDR: My girlfriend's family has history of mental illness, he has had a verbal fight with her twice before this resulting in cops. Me and my girlfriend attempted to stop her brother from killing himself or cutting in general and I got lightly cut in the process, he ran away and came back then got punched in the face and he ran away again while kicking my cars and denting one and cops were called.

I'm at a loss for what to do now as he has been taken to a psychiatric hospital for a 72 hour hold, but his name is on our lease and I will not live under the same roof as him. Does anybody have anything helpful to tell me or ask me?",2,1769775766.0,LifeAdvice,1,1.0,False

**Blurb:**

**What does it take to turn your life around? Death, of course!** 

I died in this lame ass world of ours and woke up in a completely new one. I had a new name, a new face and a new body. This was my second chance to live a better life than the previous one. 

But goddamn it, why did I have to be a witch? Now I don't just have to be on the run from the Inquisition that wants to burn me and my friends. But I also have to earn a living? 

**Follow Elsa Grimly as she:** 

1. Makes new friends and tries to save them and herself from getting burned
2. Finds redemption from the deeds of her previous life
3. Tries to get along with a cat who (like most cats) believes she runs the world
4. Deals with other slice of life shenanigans.

**Chapter 95. For the sake of charm**

  
When I woke up, Lily and Smokewell still hadn't arrived. They'd been out all day yesterday since we parted ways at the station. I took a long bath, letting the week’s fatigue dissolve, then slipped into a simple gown and stepped out into the hallway.

Lenora was still in her room, probably poring over the witchcraft material we'd given her. When I'd returned from my negotiations with Mirabelle, Lenora had opened the door with one of my old notebooks in hand. She had given me a nod in greeting with her eyes still fixed on the pages and then quietly walked back to her room. I smiled wistfully as Old Elsa's memories of learning witchcraft as a beginner flashed in my mind. The obsession that sets in when you learn something new, something that would make you better at something.

These flashes of memories could be surreal sometimes. They snuck up on me like an unseasonal rain and made me nostalgic about moments I hadn't even experienced first-hand. Yet they were my memories now. And I felt them the way Old Elsa would've felt them.

As I made my way downstairs I remembered the vision of my past that I had in Noblegate. I hadn't remembered any of Old Elsa's memories as vividly as I did this particular one. And I still didn't know exactly what that meant. But I felt like it wasn't really a coincidence that I had such a vision only a little while after my eyes had been altered with corpse blood. If I could see and hear other people's abyss because of this alteration, it was quite possible that this ability of perception also affected me on some level in return. For now, this was just a theory. But certainly something to keep in mind for my progress up the echelons. Especially if it meant that I could remember something that might aid me in becoming more like Old Elsa. Or make me a better witch.

But that could wait for now. The worry of the current hour was food. I needed breakfast and I needed more of it than usual.

I cut several slices of bread, fried four eggs, several strips of bacon, then made four cups of coffee. Then I sliced an apple, a pear and some strawberries before tossing them together in a bowl to make a quick salad. Then I rushed back upstairs and stormed into Lenora's room. I hadn't been wrong, she was hunched over her desk, still immersed in the study of witchcraft. I invaded her private space like a four-year-old high on sugar and shut her books. I pulled her out of her chair and pushed her out into the hallway. “You are joining me for breakfast and that's an order,” I said.

Lenora yelped at my ambush but let out a chuckle before coming to the table with me.

“You should've called me if you were hungry,” she said as she sat across from me.

“And make you cook for me? Really, Nora? Who made you the housemaid again?” I rolled my eyes playfully and set a loaded plate of food in front of her. “Or are you implying that my culinary skills are lacking compared to yours.”

The woman's eyes went wide. “I would never–”

“It's just breakfast, Nora,” I said. “It's no big deal. Also, you need your calories. We don't want you passing out in the kitchen again.”

The woman looked down sheepishly before forking a piece of bacon into her mouth. We ate in comfortable silence for a minute before I said, “So, how goes the study of witchcraft?”

“It's difficult,” Lenora said without missing a beat. “And fascinating. That's the reason why I can't put the notes down.”

“Have you figured out your malice yet?” I said.

This was where Lenora hesitated, “I…don't.” She idly stabbed one of the eggs with her fork.

“Relax,” I said. “No one is rushing you to become an archmaster. Also, as amazing as witchcraft can be, it is also very dangerous. Not just to others but also the witch involved.”

Dangerous? her abyss perked up.

I quickly stopped the question before she could voice it out loud. “Dangers you don't need to face yet. You haven't even advanced to the lowest echelon. Which means you can still have fun with this new thing you discovered.” I remembered the conversation Lily and I had with Smokewell. I felt a shiver at the idea of having to rely upon an addiction to numb myself from the fear of malice illnesses. “You don't need to face anything that comes with being a serious witch. I mean, look at madam now. She is a cat and she still can't stop smoking.”

She nodded passively. I listened to her abyss. It still wouldn't hurt to at least be able to know what my malice is. Even if I don't advance to any echelons, I would like to know what's special about me.

I took a sip of my coffee. ""Have you done the Malice Divination Ritual yet?"" I asked, tapping into Old Elsa's memories from her early days of learning witchcraft. The ritual involved drawing a pentacle on a piece of cloth. At its center would be an empty cup. You had to focus on filling that cup with your malice. If the cup caught fire, your malice gave you physical powers. If the cup became transparent, your malice was something abstract. Those were the two categories that malice could be divided into.

Lenora pulled out a handkerchief and held it up. A pentacle with a cup at the center was drawn on it with charcoal. ""I'm trying to charge it but it doesn't work,"" she said with an annoyed huff. “I don't even know how to use my malice to charge a pentacle. Smokewell had pissed me off that time that allowed her to determine that I had malice in me. But even when I try to anger myself to charge the pentacle, it doesn't work.” She tossed the handkerchief on the table, frustrated.

“Maybe anger isn’t the thing that puts you in touch with your malice,” I said, shrugging.

The woman looked at me curiously.

“Yes, malice is the thing that we harbor within ourselves since childhood because of some bad things that happen,” I said. “That doesn't mean that we can access that malice only by making ourselves angry and sad. Look at me.” I leaned back in my chair and opened my arms. “My malice is knowledge. The way I draw upon its power is by being curious, trying to piece together the puzzles around me, trying to see what others miss.”

“But you can do that because you already know your malice is knowledge. You know you are getting better and more intelligent each time you do it,” she said, crossing her arms with a little pout.

“There you have it,” I said, going back to eating my breakfast. “Close the books and think. What was it that you did to ease your own suffering? When you answer that, you'll know how to draw upon its power.”

Lenora just stared at the food in front of her while I quietly ate mine. We finished our breakfast in the thoughtful silence of the dining room.

I spent a couple of hours in my room at my desk, making a few sketches in my notebook about an idea I had got since my little trip to Noblegate with Lily. The bottles lined with azure varnish sat on the window above my desk. I looked at the unnatural glow as sunlight glinted through their glass.

Azure varnish was the thing that necromancers used to polish skeletons with. It kept the essence of undeath bound to the bones, allowing them to walk around and do their master's bidding. It made sense to use something like that to contain abysses within jars.

A similar principle could be applied to something else maybe?

I kept making my sketches with notes in the margins about my ideas.

I got up from my desk sometime in the afternoon, got dressed and left the house to board the tram to Orowen.

\--

Asmod's Nook was as obscure as always by the sidewalk. I stepped inside. The deceptive greeting cards sat on their shelves, affecting my emotions as I let my gaze linger upon them without piercing through their illusion.

“Hello,” a voice spoke up.

I jumped with a start. Myrtle was standing behind me with a broom. “You scared me,” I said.

“I'm sorry,” she said nervously, “I was standing right here for several minutes but you didn't notice me so I decided to call out to you in the end. I didn't mean to startle you.”

“It's okay, I guess.” I sighed, putting a hand on my chest to feel my heartbeat that was almost racing.

“Hey there, Grimly,” another voice said.

I jumped again. Asmod had appeared by the opposite wall. “You guys need to stop sneaking up on me,” I said.

He looked at me, confused. “I didn't sneak. I was right here for five minutes. You didn't notice me so I–”

“Yes, I get it. I get it.” I sighed again. “It's okay.”

The three of us headed up the stairs to Asmod’s apartment. He was making us some tea while Myrtle and I sat in the small living room. I leaned back on the couch and said, “Tell me what you know about charms?” I said.

Myrtle perked up a bit but recovered quickly. “Um, a charm is an object that amplifies the effect of certain spells or runes.”

“That's the basic definition,” I said. “Tell me how many kinds of magical energies can a charm store within itself?”

“Three,” Myrtle said confidently. “Because more than that can make the charm unstable.”

I nodded. So I hadn't been too off the track with my idea. I pulled out my notebook and flipped it open to the pages where I'd made my sketches. I handed it to her. “Take a look at it and tell me what you think,” I said.

The dwarf girl went through the sketches and notes and raised an eyebrow. She examined the drawings and notes for several minutes, mumbling something to herself while nodding a little as if working out the logistics in her mind. By then Asmod walked over with the tea. I picked a cup and took a sip.

Myrtle put the book down and blew a soft breath. “I've never seen a charm that served this purpose,” she said. “Or one that worked on this principle.”

Asmod looked at me, intrigued. “What have you cooked up now, Grimly?” he said.

“Myrtle,” I said. “Why don't you explain it to him? So I'll know that you understand my idea and whether or not it is possible.”

“Okay, I'll begin by saying that yes, it is possible,” she said and turned to Asmod. “Miss Grimly made a design for a special kind of charm. It contains an abyss within itself. And a hex. Every abyss contained within the charm will serve its purpose for a fixed period of time. And then it will be extinguished by the inbuilt hex after that period.”

Now it was Asmod's turn to raise an eyebrow. “That sounds interesting. But what purpose is this charm going to serve?”

With a small smile, I said, “Communication.”

“Right now, the biggest hurdle that any business in Ravenwind faces is fast communication,” I said. “That's also the reason why a chain of outlets like our taverns couldn't work before. Gathering information about what goes on in every city is going to be the main purpose of these taverns. That information needs to be passed around quickly. This charm will help us in that.”

I could hear Myrtle and Asmod's abysses being both intrigued and impressed. That charm was nothing but an abyss powered mobile phone. And even though I was selling it as a faster means of communication, there were several other theories I wanted to test through this charm.

I looked at Myrtle. “Well, you know the concept. Now it's your job to craft those charms. And craft them quickly.” I turned to Asmod, “And it's your job to use your contacts and fix her with a good workshop and materials.”

Both of them perked up in unison and nodded. I sighed inwardly. To them, this probably looked like a small grind. From what I’d seen of her work, I could safely assume that Myrtle could craft a dozen charms without any problem in a couple of days. But neither of them knew the danger that I was facing. If I could destroy an abyss instead of liberating it, I wouldn't be making the Ruler of Abyss any stronger by being a puppet in her hands.

1qr3x1z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qr3x1z,"Recent Pickups. (ERD, Vetements, Acne, Margiela)","1. Acne Studios Long Sleeve Tee (Sage Green)

The Vibe: Clean, minimalist, Scandi-cool. Review: A solid basic. The color is a really nice muted sage/grey—super versatile and works well with both black and blue denim. The centered circular logo adds just enough branding without being obnoxious. It looks like a relatively lightweight cotton, good for layering. Pros: Great colorway. Subtle flex. Easy to style. Cons: It’s just a long sleeve tee at the end of the day. If the blank isn't heavy, it might not feel worth the premium price tag. Score: 7.5/10

2. Vetements ""Vengeful Spirit"" / Cradle of Filth Hoodie

The Vibe: Dark, edgy, oversize heavyweight. Review: This is a statement piece. The sun-faded/washed black effect on the cotton looks really authentic and high-quality. The graphics are incredibly ""loud""—distinctly Vetements style with the heavy metal typography and the pentagrams down the sleeve. It’s definitely not for everyone, but if you are into the opium/grunge aesthetic, this hits the mark. The skull print looks properly distressed. Pros: The wash is beautiful; it looks like a vintage band tee that’s been worn for 20 years. Cons: It’s very aggressive. Hard to wear in a ""normie"" setting without looking like you're trying too hard. Score: 8.5/10

3. Acne Studios Leather Collar Harrington Jacket

The Vibe: Retro, smart-casual, ""old money"" adjacent. Review: This is a classy piece. The contrast between the beige cotton body and the brown leather collar elevates it significantly. It gives off a vintage workwear vibe but with a modern, boxy cut. The snap buttons and clean placket keep it looking sharp. Pros: Timeless design. You can wear this to a nice dinner or just hanging out. The leather collar adds a luxury touch. Cons: The elastic waist hem can sometimes bunch up and make the fit look too round if you aren't careful with sizing. Score: 8.5/10

4. Balenciaga Convertible Camo Cargo Pants

The Vibe: Utilitarian, tactical, oversized. Review: These go hard. The grey/monochrome camouflage is much easier to style than traditional green camo. The best feature is clearly the zippers at the knee—turning them into shorts makes them a 2-in-1 piece, which justifies the purchase. The pockets look massive and functional. Pros: The convertible zip-off feature is a game changer. The fit looks baggy in the right way (classic Balenciaga silhouette). Cons: Lots of straps and drawstrings can be annoying in daily life. You have to be tall or wear chunky shoes to pull these off without dragging the hem. Score: 9/10

5. Nike Air Zoom Alphafly (Black/Red)

The Vibe: Pure performance, technical runner. Review: This is strictly a functional shoe. The exposed Air Zoom pods and the aggressive stack height scream ""marathon runner."" The black and silver with the red gradient sole looks fast. Pros: Probably the most comfortable shoe here for actually walking or running. Tech looks cool. Cons: Very hard to style casually. You can't really wear these with jeans or cargos (like the Balenciagas above) without looking like a gym teacher. These belong on the track or with activewear only. Score: 7/10 (10/10 for running, 4/10 for fashion).

6. Maison Margiela Replica GATs (Pink/Salmon)

The Vibe: Sophisticated, soft luxury, spring essential. Review: Beautiful pair. The German Army Trainer (GAT) silhouette is a classic for a reason, but this soft pink/salmon colorway makes it pop. The contrast between the suede paneling, the smooth leather, and the gum sole is perfect. These look buttery smooth. Pros: Unique colorway that isn't too bright. Extremely comfortable silhouette. High-quality material mix. Cons: Suede on light-colored shoes is a nightmare to keep clean. One drop of coffee and it's over. Score: 9.5/10 (My personal favorite of the lot).

7. Birkenstock Boston Clogs (Black Suede)

The Vibe: Cozy, essential, ""off-duty"" model. Review: You really can't go wrong here. The black suede Bostons are arguably the most versatile shoe in modern streetwear. They bridge the gap between house slippers and actual footwear. The suede texture in the photo looks nice and plush, not flat. Pros: Ultimate comfort. They go with everything—sweats, denim, the camo cargos from part 1. Cons: Suede maintenance. You cannot wear these in the rain, or they are ruined. Score: 9/10 (A wardrobe staple).

8. Acne Studios ""Stockholm 1996"" Tee (Faded Navy)

The Vibe: Vintage casual, subtle luxury. Review: Another solid basic from Acne. The ""Stockholm 1996"" stamp has that cracked, worn-in look that makes it feel like a thrift store find (but with better fit). The garment dye/wash on the blank gives it a nice depth—it’s not just a flat navy blue. Pros: The neckline looks tight and high quality (won't sag easily). Boxy fit is flattering.

I’m so tired tonight as Liz stayed over after the council meeting to talk .she just left 

But first it was an early morning another nightmare 0415 I awaken in a cold sweat 

this time a drazzan but the flower was my brothers face .I message Liz she came early still wearing bed cloths with swim suit in a bag .

I was shaking when she arrived

Liz telling me we meet Lilli at 1100 so your off work then . I’m with you all day calling me sis 🙂

I’m rambling tonight but don’t want to sleep .afraid of dreaming 

Back to this morning 

Well as normal we went swimming at daybreak . This time the pool to swim laps . 

Went to Chequers Aino and Marcus were there early . I guess Liz contacted them

Wednesday talked Aino saying he understands I’m going with Lilli today .

The n SM Sterrin walked in Asking how I was

He ordered a coffee then said I’m placing Torres at your place tonight .

I really like her

Went to my office Liz hanging out bothering me lol

Around 1100 hrs Lili arrived in a little EV Liz and I climbing in the back . Only taken a few minutes to get to the range

Lilli asking if we have used a firearm before I told her no

Liz smiled and lifted her shirt . I’m was surprised but not Lili she smiled saying well you are the General daughter . She ask Liz to see it . Liz gave it to her and Lili unloaded it placing it on a table .

I swear Liz was mad

Then inside for safety training

Took about a hour then we went to the range out back 10 m berms all four sides with a maze like entrance . Lilli said this is the handgun range was only 30 m . She said the other is 600 m

So Lili had bright out a looked like a cannon

I called it that Liz laughed Lili looked mad

We were doing target practice Liz giving Lilli two target one for me one for her

Mine was a pic of my asshole brother

Liz a Drazzan

We shot many mags from the service handgun .

It was quite heavy

Liz was hitting the drazzan saying the pattern is better than Wyatt’s . Mine was ok but this was my first time . And the ear protection feels weird along with the glasses .

Lilli ask Liz to use hers as Lilli brought it out when we started

Liz pulled out a new target it had a drazzan holding a little pig she empty one mag then out of nowhere she had another mag like magic empty it as well .Then placing it on the table she put a new target up another Drazzan but with the flower my brothers likeness

Then she put more boolits in the magazines saying your turn , It was not as big as the other one Fit my hand very well

Once done Lilli asked if Liz could get another . She laughed saying 10 here tomorrow and dad said no problem . we left the range it was after 14 00 hrs

Lili dropping us off at my hab

Went in took a nap 1700 Liz still here Seens she and Aino planned the meeting tonight

Aino , Myself , Liz , Marcus , Sterrin and Arhincho had a fish dinner Talks about Security and possible firearm training , Glass Works, Marcus the home by the Mansion

Liz saying everything going good with the kids No many fights this week or as normal boys and testosterone .

Aino making notes . Then everyone left but Sterrin and Liz

Sterrin “ gave me a hug “ saying it will be ok I need to leave and there will be Torres and one other here at the house . Sleep well your safe then left

Liz and I laughed I got a hug we talked then Liz looked at me and said tomorrow we tell Aino to contact Wyatt

I can’t contact him he will worry about Newtown

The dev board is intentionally simple and breadboard-friendly—it leaves 3 free rows on each side (more than even the Arduino Nano). 

The gerber files, and full source is available for download. Upload them to JLCPCB and you can get 75 boards for the price of a cup of coffee.

The CH32V006F8P6 (8KB RAM, 62KB Flash, 7 DMA channels, 12-bit ADC) is available from WCH's official AliExpress store at ~$0.26/chip (For 50). 

It's possible to put a working dev board together for under 50 cents a board!

The TSSOP-20 package is a fun soldering challenge without being too frustrating.

Last month, I was taking a walk in a park and noticed a girl. I almost fell for her at first sight. I really wanted to get to know her, but I hadn’t been in a relationship for a very, very long time, to the point that I honestly had no idea what I was supposed to do. In the end, I didn’t have the courage to go up and talk to her. That night, I couldn’t stop thinking about her. Over the next several days, I kept going back to that park, hoping I might run into her again—but unfortunately, I never did. Now I really regret it.

So what should I do in a situation like this?
Should I just walk up and ask for her number directly? I’m a complete stranger—wouldn’t that make rejection very likely? It also feels very goal-oriented, and I don’t really like that approach. Would it be better to ask if I could buy her a cup of coffee, get a basic sense of each other through conversation, and then ask for her contact information afterward? Or is that too old-fashioned? What if she’s busy and doesn’t have time?

And honestly, I don’t even know what to talk about. I feel like I don’t have any good topics. Just directly asking what she likes, what she studied in college, or what her job is feels really awkward. Or what if I try to talk about something, but she’s just not interested in me at all?

I really need help.🥺

It looks slightly heavier/more structured than the grey one. The ""mud wash"" effect is done really well here. Pros: Great color palette for fall/winter. The graphics give it a band-merch feel without being a specific band. Cons: Same as above—extremely distressed look isn't for every occasion. Score: 8.5/10

11. Supreme x Yohji Yamamoto x Vanson Leathers Split Jacket

The Vibe: Grail status, aggressive, high-fashion biker. Review: This is the highlight of the entire haul. The collaboration between Supreme, Yohji, and Vanson is legendary. The split graphic on the sleeves (the abstract/wolf design) looks incredible. The leather looks stiff and heavy, which is typical for Vanson—it will take a long time to break in, but it’s bulletproof quality. Pros: Insane flex. The construction looks top-tier. It’s a piece of art. Cons: Comfort will be low initially; Vanson leather is notoriously stiff. It’s also very loud—you need a simple outfit underneath to let the jacket talk.

1qr3tdd,https://www.reddit.com/r/burlington/comments/1qr3tdd/general_national_strike_reference_info/,General National Strike Reference Info,"Here is protest info for today (Friday, Jan 30). Most local businesses here can't stay afloat if they close, understandably. Jan/Feb are some of the slowest months of the year for them, and many had to close due to the weather already this week. Almost all of them do support these protests though- and many have decided to stand with us by putting up posters in their windows for tomorrow. **Let's give back to these local businesses** by supporting them, either today or throughout these tough months.

Some local businesses that are closing today that we should make sure to support:

* **Vivid Coffee** (just off Church Street) is donating a dollar for every coffee sold to Migrant Justice VT and is closing early at 2pm!
* **Smugglers' Notch Distillery & Vermont Distillers Tasting Room** is closing for the day I believe
* **Fear and Clothing** is closing for the day
* **City Market** is closing for an hour to allow for their employees to attend the protest

Feel free to shout out other businesses in the comments! I will try to make a list of businesses that I see with posters in their windows today so we can reference it as we try to keep our local businesses afloat through the rest of the winter.

The Vibe: Clean, minimalist, Scandi-cool. Review: A solid basic. The color is a really nice muted sage/grey—super versatile and works well with both black and blue denim. The centered circular logo adds just enough branding without being obnoxious. It looks like a relatively lightweight cotton, good for layering. Pros: Great colorway. Subtle flex. Easy to style. Cons: It’s just a long sleeve tee at the end of the day. If the blank isn't heavy, it might not feel worth the premium price tag. Score: 7.5/10

2. Vetements ""Vengeful Spirit"" / Cradle of Filth Hoodie

The Vibe: Dark, edgy, oversize heavyweight. Review: This is a statement piece. The sun-faded/washed black effect on the cotton looks really authentic and high-quality. The graphics are incredibly ""loud""—distinctly Vetements style with the heavy metal typography and the pentagrams down the sleeve. It’s definitely not for everyone, but if you are into the opium/grunge aesthetic, this hits the mark. The skull print looks properly distressed. Pros: The wash is beautiful; it looks like a vintage band tee that’s been worn for 20 years. Cons: It’s very aggressive. Hard to wear in a ""normie"" setting without looking like you're trying too hard. Score: 8.5/10

3. Acne Studios Leather Collar Harrington Jacket

The Vibe: Retro, smart-casual, ""old money"" adjacent. Review: This is a classy piece. The contrast between the beige cotton body and the brown leather collar elevates it significantly. It gives off a vintage workwear vibe but with a modern, boxy cut. The snap buttons and clean placket keep it looking sharp. Pros: Timeless design. You can wear this to a nice dinner or just hanging out. The leather collar adds a luxury touch. Cons: The elastic waist hem can sometimes bunch up and make the fit look too round if you aren't careful with sizing. Score: 8.5/10

4. Balenciaga Convertible Camo Cargo Pants

The Vibe: Utilitarian, tactical, oversized. Review: These go hard. The grey/monochrome camouflage is much easier to style than traditional green camo. The best feature is clearly the zippers at the knee—turning them into shorts makes them a 2-in-1 piece, which justifies the purchase. The pockets look massive and functional. Pros: The convertible zip-off feature is a game changer. The fit looks baggy in the right way (classic Balenciaga silhouette). Cons: Lots of straps and drawstrings can be annoying in daily life. You have to be tall or wear chunky shoes to pull these off without dragging the hem. Score: 9/10

5. Nike Air Zoom Alphafly (Black/Red)

The Vibe: Pure performance, technical runner. Review: This is strictly a functional shoe. The exposed Air Zoom pods and the aggressive stack height scream ""marathon runner."" The black and silver with the red gradient sole looks fast. Pros: Probably the most comfortable shoe here for actually walking or running. Tech looks cool. Cons: Very hard to style casually. You can't really wear these with jeans or cargos (like the Balenciagas above) without looking like a gym teacher. These belong on the track or with activewear only. Score: 7/10 (10/10 for running, 4/10 for fashion).

6. Maison Margiela Replica GATs (Pink/Salmon)

The Vibe: Sophisticated, soft luxury, spring essential. Review: Beautiful pair. The German Army Trainer (GAT) silhouette is a classic for a reason, but this soft pink/salmon colorway makes it pop. The contrast between the suede paneling, the smooth leather, and the gum sole is perfect. These look buttery smooth. Pros: Unique colorway that isn't too bright. Extremely comfortable silhouette. High-quality material mix. Cons: Suede on light-colored shoes is a nightmare to keep clean. One drop of coffee and it's over. Score: 9.5/10 (My personal favorite of the lot).

7. Birkenstock Boston Clogs (Black Suede)

The Vibe: Cozy, essential, ""off-duty"" model. Review: You really can't go wrong here. The black suede Bostons are arguably the most versatile shoe in modern streetwear. They bridge the gap between house slippers and actual footwear. The suede texture in the photo looks nice and plush, not flat. Pros: Ultimate comfort. They go with everything—sweats, denim, the camo cargos from part 1. Cons: Suede maintenance. You cannot wear these in the rain, or they are ruined. Score: 9/10 (A wardrobe staple).

8. Acne Studios ""Stockholm 1996"" Tee (Faded Navy)

The Vibe: Vintage casual, subtle luxury. Review: Another solid basic from Acne. The ""Stockholm 1996"" stamp has that cracked, worn-in look that makes it feel like a thrift store find (but with better fit). The garment dye/wash on the blank gives it a nice depth—it’s not just a flat navy blue. Pros: The neckline looks tight and high quality (won't sag easily). Boxy fit is flattering. Cons: It’s a logo tee. If you aren't a fan of branding, it might be too much text. Score: 7.5/10

9. Enfants Riches Déprimés (ERD) Text Hoodie (Grey/Taupe)

The Vibe: Grunge, depressive luxury, ""I slept in this."" Review: Classic ERD aesthetic. The wash on this is fantastic—it has that sun-faded, dusty taupe color that is really hard to replicate. The distressing on the hood and hems looks authentic. The simple serif font logo is understated but recognizable to those who know. Pros: The wash/color is unique. The crop on the waist looks good for layering. Cons: The price point for ERD is always controversial for something that looks ""destroyed."" The pocket distressing looks a bit fragile; be careful not to rip it further. Score: 8/10

some managers srsly need to stop judging people like me and give us an opportunity at the VERY LEAST. ik they need to achieve the best performance for their restaurant but give people a chance to excel???? there are some crew members who lack in a lot skills and i feel bad about it. they become desolate from others and in a sense it feels like its some sort of caste system.

A familiar scene greets those attending an Ethiopian coffee ritual: the scent of beans warming over heat and a quiet ring as porcelain meets tray, while at the table's heart sits a tightly coiled mesob, cradling rounds of injera layered beneath stews.

Each of these mesobs begins life as wild grass, gathered before dawn. Crafted solely by women, their making follows rhythms shaped over decades. Breathable strands form a surface that adapts to touch. Spirals may speak of one village, stars of another, and symbols rooted in place. Tools remain simple: fingers, time, and repetition. Plastic never enters the process. Machines play no role here. What emerges grows slowly, built strand by strand. Tradition isn’t added; it’s woven in from the start. Waste does not accumulate; nothing is rushed. Patience becomes part of the structure.

A quiet moment grows meaningful when small acts form connection between people. Though centered on brewing, the ritual values patience more than speed. Conversation flows where silence might have been before. Respect shows itself in gestures shaped by those who came earlier.

Curious about whether you've taken part in a buna event or come across those textiles up close. Maybe what caught your attention was the design work, or maybe it was the tradition behind them - could be something entirely different.

But in Med School, you find things you hate and you find things that are interesting.  You have to learn it all, so you don't study things you are interested in because you know it already, to get through United States Medical Licensing Examinations Step 1, 2, 2 CS, and 3 you have to know as much as possible, at least 70% but if you want to be a Plastic Surgeon, A Dermatologist, A Radiologist you have to be in the top 1% of your peers, but thats hard because your peers are all high achievers.

Herpes is absolutely fascinating because of how intelligent it is, yes, I believe its super intelligent, almost alien.  

People don't understand how advanced and unstoppable this virus is.  Have you ever seen the Borg on Star Trek?  Herpes works the same exact way.  It takes over the cellular machinery in your dorsal root ganglion , hijacks the entire cell process, is able to travel skin to skin contact no other pathogen can do that, most pathogens need an entryway,

It replicates when you are stressed... which causes PAID.  The borg from star trek do this, they essentially assimilate themselves into you by using your body for its own functions. 

If you have oral it sits in your trigeminal ganglion , if you have genital it sits in your lumbosacral ganglion the whole processing center of your peripheral nervous system the relay center of your nerves, this is how it causes physical pain, this is essentially the Sensory Pain pathway...   It can never be cured unless a scientist can invent a way to target its genes... the genes that activate it...    do you realize how expensive something like that would be?

After I graduated Med School I got a post doc in genetics (Behavioral Genetics) because I wanted to be competitive against all those nerds to get into Residency.   All I'm saying is that the only way a cure can be developed is through gene targeting.   

My dad was a senior executive for the company that created Valtrex.  (Borroughs Welcome which merged with Smith-kliene Beecham to became Glaxo Smithklein.   All that stupid drug does is target a replication enzyme the virus uses so it lessens the severety of outbreaks but its weak sauce, you think the virus cares.  The virus will just wait and wait and it will use Asymptomatic carriers to make skin to skin contact to jump over into YOU, and then make YOU SYMPTOMATIC.   

I dunno, I'm just saying there is no organism in life that can do this, its almost the perfect organism.   

I had shirts, coffee mugs and pens that all said Valtrax without knowing what it was. The pens were fkin awesome by the way, I would bring stacks of them for my classmates and teachers and they loved that shit. 

Lastly, I'm not going to talk about the Maternal to Child transmission because thats fucking depressing and you dont need some doosh constantly worrying and depressing you.  But i will just say, I feel your pain... esp those with outbreaks, pain is something in life you do not deserve to endure. 

Start advocating for the cure, don't let some Family Practice outpatient doctor gaslight you or talk down to you.   Mad respect to OB/Gyn's who don't do OB anymore, and focus on Gyn btw, they better know their shit about HSV HPV etc.  STD clinics are places of support and information.   

My fascination with Herpes stems from HIV patients I had in the Bronx, who had all sorts of severe shit because they were immunocompromised.  Back in the day, the Bronx was where you would see everything as a physician.   

Btw, a family doctor, assoiciated with a big city hospital, thats part of a learning institution will know their shit so well, so don't knock them either.  

And no I don't have Herpes, THAT I KNOW of, since I've never had a symptom, I've never been tested, but hey, I could be an asymptomatic carrier.  But be warned that blood IGG levels are completely inaccurate if you just take the test, the test is for suspected exposure.  You dont just do blood IgG's on random people there is NO POINT, its inaccurate...  ask the CDC.

The Vibe: Clean, minimalist, Scandi-cool. Review: A solid basic. The color is a really nice muted sage/grey—super versatile and works well with both black and blue denim. The centered circular logo adds just enough branding without being obnoxious. It looks like a relatively lightweight cotton, good for layering. Pros: Great colorway. Subtle flex. Easy to style. Cons: It’s just a long sleeve tee at the end of the day. If the blank isn't heavy, it might not feel worth the premium price tag. Score: 7.5/10

2. Vetements ""Vengeful Spirit"" / Cradle of Filth Hoodie

The Vibe: Dark, edgy, oversize heavyweight. Review: This is a statement piece. The sun-faded/washed black effect on the cotton looks really authentic and high-quality. The graphics are incredibly ""loud""—distinctly Vetements style with the heavy metal typography and the pentagrams down the sleeve. It’s definitely not for everyone, but if you are into the opium/grunge aesthetic, this hits the mark. The skull print looks properly distressed. Pros: The wash is beautiful; it looks like a vintage band tee that’s been worn for 20 years. Cons: It’s very aggressive. Hard to wear in a ""normie"" setting without looking like you're trying too hard. Score: 8.5/10

3. Acne Studios Leather Collar Harrington Jacket

The Vibe: Retro, smart-casual, ""old money"" adjacent. Review: This is a classy piece. The contrast between the beige cotton body and the brown leather collar elevates it significantly. It gives off a vintage workwear vibe but with a modern, boxy cut. The snap buttons and clean placket keep it looking sharp. Pros: Timeless design. You can wear this to a nice dinner or just hanging out. The leather collar adds a luxury touch. Cons: The elastic waist hem can sometimes bunch up and make the fit look too round if you aren't careful with sizing. Score: 8.5/10

4. Balenciaga Convertible Camo Cargo Pants

The Vibe: Utilitarian, tactical, oversized. Review: These go hard. The grey/monochrome camouflage is much easier to style than traditional green camo. The best feature is clearly the zippers at the knee—turning them into shorts makes them a 2-in-1 piece, which justifies the purchase. The pockets look massive and functional. Pros: The convertible zip-off feature is a game changer. The fit looks baggy in the right way (classic Balenciaga silhouette). Cons: Lots of straps and drawstrings can be annoying in daily life. You have to be tall or wear chunky shoes to pull these off without dragging the hem. Score: 9/10

5. Nike Air Zoom Alphafly (Black/Red)

The Vibe: Pure performance, technical runner. Review: This is strictly a functional shoe. The exposed Air Zoom pods and the aggressive stack height scream ""marathon runner."" The black and silver with the red gradient sole looks fast. Pros: Probably the most comfortable shoe here for actually walking or running. Tech looks cool. Cons: Very hard to style casually. You can't really wear these with jeans or cargos (like the Balenciagas above) without looking like a gym teacher. These belong on the track or with activewear only. Score: 7/10 (10/10 for running, 4/10 for fashion).

6. Maison Margiela Replica GATs (Pink/Salmon)

The Vibe: Sophisticated, soft luxury, spring essential. Review: Beautiful pair. The German Army Trainer (GAT) silhouette is a classic for a reason, but this soft pink/salmon colorway makes it pop. The contrast between the suede paneling, the smooth leather, and the gum sole is perfect. These look buttery smooth. Pros: Unique colorway that isn't too bright. Extremely comfortable silhouette. High-quality material mix. Cons: Suede on light-colored shoes is a nightmare to keep clean. One drop of coffee and it's over. Score: 9.5/10 (My personal favorite of the lot).

7. Birkenstock Boston Clogs (Black Suede)

The Vibe: Cozy, essential, ""off-duty"" model. Review: You really can't go wrong here. The black suede Bostons are arguably the most versatile shoe in modern streetwear. They bridge the gap between house slippers and actual footwear. The suede texture in the photo looks nice and plush, not flat. Pros: Ultimate comfort. They go with everything—sweats, denim, the camo cargos from part 1. Cons: Suede maintenance. You cannot wear these in the rain, or they are ruined. Score: 9/10 (A wardrobe staple).

8. Acne Studios ""Stockholm 1996"" Tee (Faded Navy)

The Vibe: Vintage casual, subtle luxury. Review: Another solid basic from Acne. The ""Stockholm 1996"" stamp has that cracked, worn-in look that makes it feel like a thrift store find (but with better fit). The garment dye/wash on the blank gives it a nice depth—it’s not just a flat navy blue. Pros: The neckline looks tight and high quality (won't sag easily). Boxy fit is flattering. Cons: It’s a logo tee. If you aren't a fan of branding, it might be too much text. Score: 7.5/10

9. Enfants Riches Déprimés (ERD) Text Hoodie (Grey/Taupe)

The Vibe: Grunge, depressive luxury, ""I slept in this."" Review: Classic ERD aesthetic. The wash on this is fantastic—it has that sun-faded, dusty taupe color that is really hard to replicate. The distressing on the hood and hems looks authentic. The simple serif font logo is understated but recognizable to those who know. Pros: The wash/color is unique. The crop on the waist looks good for layering. Cons: The price point for ERD is always controversial for something that looks ""destroyed."" The pocket distressing looks a bit fragile; be careful not to rip it further. Score: 8/10

10. Enfants Riches Déprimés (ERD) ""e r d"" Graphic Hoodie (Brown)

The Vibe: Punk, collage art, distressed. Review: I prefer this one over the text-only hoodie. The warm brown tone is rich, and the three-panel graphic gives it more visual interest. It looks slightly heavier/more structured than the grey one. The ""mud wash"" effect is done really well here. Pros: Great color palette for fall/winter. The graphics give it a band-merch feel without being a specific band. Cons: Same as above—extremely distressed look isn't for every occasion. Score: 8.5/10

11. Supreme x Yohji Yamamoto x Vanson Leathers Split Jacket

The Vibe: Grail status, aggressive, high-fashion biker. Review: This is the highlight of the entire haul. The collaboration between Supreme, Yohji, and Vanson is legendary. The split graphic on the sleeves (the abstract/wolf design) looks incredible. The leather looks stiff and heavy, which is typical for Vanson—it will take a long time to break in, but it’s bulletproof quality. Pros: Insane flex. The construction looks top-tier. It’s a piece of art. Cons: Comfort will be low initially; Vanson leather is notoriously stiff. It’s also very loud—you need a simple outfit underneath to let the jacket talk.

1qr3nfw,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheImprovementRoom/comments/1qr3nfw/i_practiced_flirting_with_women_for_30_days_and/,I practiced flirting with women for 30 days and here's what actually worked (and what spectacularly failed),"I've always been the guy who freezes up around attractive women. The guy who thinks of the perfect thing to say 3 hours later.

So I decided to run an experiment: 30 days of deliberate flirting practice. No pickup lines or manipulation tactics just genuine interactions with a specific focus on building romantic tension and expressing interest clearly.

What followed was equal parts humbling, educational. But by day 30, something had fundamentally shifted in how I communicate with women I'm attracted to.

Here's what I learned:

Days 1-7: The awkward phase

My first week was a masterclass in what NOT to do. In my head, I sounded smooth. In reality, I was a human cringe compilation.

Day 1: Tried complimenting a barista on her earrings and somehow ended up in a three-minute monologue about my aunt's jewelry collection. She looked genuinely concerned for my wellbeing.

Day 4: Attempted ""playful teasing"" with a woman at the gym. Called her form ""interesting"" during kettlebell swings. She thought I was a trainer about to correct her technique. When I clarified I was flirting, she just said ""Oh"" and walked away. After that I was considered moving to another country

Day 9: Had a conversation with a woman at a bookstore about the novel she was holding. Instead of trying to impress her with my literary knowledge, I asked genuine questions about what drew her to that author. The conversation flowed naturally for 15 minutes, ending with her suggesting a coffee shop nearby.

Day 12: The winning formula started becoming clear: curiosity + presence + patience = chemistry. I was learning that flirtation isn't about what you say but the energy you create.

Days 15-22: Earned confidence

By mid-experiment, patterns were emerging about what consistently worked versus what consistently failed.

What consistently failed:

Anything that felt like a ""line"" or prepared statement

Complimenting physical appearance as an opener

Trying to demonstrate value or intelligence

Any interaction where I was focused on the outcome rather than the moment

What consistently worked:

Genuine observations about something in our shared environment

Playful (but kind) banter that created emotional ping-pong

Light, brief touch at appropriate moments (like a touch on the arm during laughter)

Comfortable silence with maintained eye contact

The biggest revelation came on Day 19 at a friend's dinner party. I realized I was no longer ""practicing flirting"" I was just connecting with people while allowing attraction to exist without hiding it. My friend later told me that a woman had asked about me after the party, something that had rarely happened before.

Days 23-30: The outcome phase

The final week brought a profound insight: Effective flirting isn't a separate communication mode it's regular conversation with the volume turned up on certain elements:

More precise eye contact

Slightly more personal questions

More expressive reactions to their stories

More comfort with silence

More willingness to show vulnerability mixed with confidence

Day 26: Had lunch next to a woman at a café counter. Our conversation flowed from weather to travel to life philosophies without effort.

Day 30: Went to a social event and found myself flirting effortlessly with multiple women throughout the evening.

The true transformation wasn't becoming ""better at flirting"" but becoming more comfortable with myself in romantic contexts. The awkwardness never completely disappears (and honestly, a little awkwardness can be endearing), but the fear around it does.

Has anyone else tried something similar? What did you learn about yourself in the process? Well I realized women are also humans (lol) and that it's all a numbers game and it's all practice.",4,1769774792.0,TheImprovementRoom,1,1.0,False

I guess I just need to get it out somewhere.

A few weeks ago, I received a letter. No return address. No explanation.

Inside was just a short sentence — “You left more here than you think” — and a set of coordinates.

I recognized the place immediately.

A forest I used to go to years ago when I didn’t want to be around anyone. A place tied to a part of my life I try not to think about anymore.

I almost threw the letter away. I actually did, at first.

But I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I barely slept that night. So the next morning, I got in my car and went.

The drive felt wrong in a way I can’t fully explain. My phone lost signal earlier than it should have. My watch was a few minutes behind when I checked it. The forest was quiet — not peaceful quiet, just… empty. No birds. No wind.

That’s when I saw the cabin.

I don’t remember it being there before. It looked old, like it had been standing there longer than it should have. The door was already open. I stood outside for a good minute before going in, trying to talk myself out of it.

Inside, it was warm. Not cozy — just warm enough to notice.

There was a mug on the table. Coffee. The way I drink it. That alone should’ve made me leave.

Then someone spoke behind me.

I turned around and saw a man standing there. Nothing strange about him, which somehow made it worse. He looked normal. Calm. Like he belonged there.

He didn’t introduce himself. Didn’t ask why I was there.

He just looked at me like he already knew.

At some point, I said something I hadn’t planned to say.

“I never forgave myself.”

I didn’t even realize how true that was until I heard it out loud.

We talked for a while. I don’t know how long. Time felt… off.

We talked about things I avoid thinking about. About mistakes. About loss. About how easy it is to carry guilt for years and call it “moving on.”

Before I left, I asked him if any of it was real.

He just smiled and asked if it mattered.

When I stepped outside, the cabin was gone.

No tracks. No broken branches. Just forest. Normal forest. Birds, wind, everything like it should be.

I drove home feeling exhausted, like I hadn’t slept in days.

Nothing strange has happened since. No more letters.

Life went back to normal. Work, sleep, repeat.

But something did change.

For the first time in years, I sleep through the night.

No waking up with that tight feeling in my chest. No replaying old memories over and over.

I don’t know what that place was.

I don’t know who that man was either.

I just know I went there carrying something heavy —

and I didn’t bring it all back with me.",1,1769774648.0,Paranormal,3,0.67,False

More like:
A quiet work/study lounge with café drinks and reservable private pods for calls and isolation

A creative studio with big tables, sewing machines, 3D printers, and  niche craft spaces

You’d pay a monthly membership (like a gym), then just show up and use the space. Some specialty rooms/tools might be bookable.

Pros: The wash is beautiful; it looks like a vintage band tee that’s been worn for 20 years. Cons: It’s very aggressive. Hard to wear in a ""normie"" setting without looking like you're trying too hard. Score: 8.5/10

3. Acne Studios Leather Collar Harrington Jacket

The Vibe: Retro, smart-casual, ""old money"" adjacent. Review: This is a classy piece. The contrast between the beige cotton body and the brown leather collar elevates it significantly. It gives off a vintage workwear vibe but with a modern, boxy cut. The snap buttons and clean placket keep it looking sharp. Pros: Timeless design. You can wear this to a nice dinner or just hanging out. The leather collar adds a luxury touch. Cons: The elastic waist hem can sometimes bunch up and make the fit look too round if you aren't careful with sizing. Score: 8.5/10

4. Balenciaga Convertible Camo Cargo Pants

The Vibe: Utilitarian, tactical, oversized. Review: These go hard. The grey/monochrome camouflage is much easier to style than traditional green camo. The best feature is clearly the zippers at the knee—turning them into shorts makes them a 2-in-1 piece, which justifies the purchase. The pockets look massive and functional. Pros: The convertible zip-off feature is a game changer. The fit looks baggy in the right way (classic Balenciaga silhouette). Cons: Lots of straps and drawstrings can be annoying in daily life. You have to be tall or wear chunky shoes to pull these off without dragging the hem. Score: 9/10

5. Nike Air Zoom Alphafly (Black/Red)

The Vibe: Pure performance, technical runner. Review: This is strictly a functional shoe. The exposed Air Zoom pods and the aggressive stack height scream ""marathon runner."" The black and silver with the red gradient sole looks fast. Pros: Probably the most comfortable shoe here for actually walking or running. Tech looks cool. Cons: Very hard to style casually. You can't really wear these with jeans or cargos (like the Balenciagas above) without looking like a gym teacher. These belong on the track or with activewear only. Score: 7/10 (10/10 for running, 4/10 for fashion).

6. Maison Margiela Replica GATs (Pink/Salmon)

The Vibe: Sophisticated, soft luxury, spring essential. Review: Beautiful pair. The German Army Trainer (GAT) silhouette is a classic for a reason, but this soft pink/salmon colorway makes it pop. The contrast between the suede paneling, the smooth leather, and the gum sole is perfect. These look buttery smooth. Pros: Unique colorway that isn't too bright. Extremely comfortable silhouette. High-quality material mix. Cons: Suede on light-colored shoes is a nightmare to keep clean. One drop of coffee and it's over. Score: 9.5/10 (My personal favorite of the lot).

7. Birkenstock Boston Clogs (Black Suede)

The Vibe: Cozy, essential, ""off-duty"" model. Review: You really can't go wrong here. The black suede Bostons are arguably the most versatile shoe in modern streetwear. They bridge the gap between house slippers and actual footwear. The suede texture in the photo looks nice and plush, not flat. Pros: Ultimate comfort. They go with everything—sweats, denim, the camo cargos from part 1. Cons: Suede maintenance. You cannot wear these in the rain, or they are ruined. Score: 9/10 (A wardrobe staple).

8. Acne Studios ""Stockholm 1996"" Tee (Faded Navy)

The Vibe: Vintage casual, subtle luxury. Review: Another solid basic from Acne. The ""Stockholm 1996"" stamp has that cracked, worn-in look that makes it feel like a thrift store find (but with better fit). The garment dye/wash on the blank gives it a nice depth—it’s not just a flat navy blue. Pros: The neckline looks tight and high quality (won't sag easily). Boxy fit is flattering. Cons: It’s a logo tee. If you aren't a fan of branding, it might be too much text. Score: 7.5/10

9. Enfants Riches Déprimés (ERD) Text Hoodie (Grey/Taupe)

The Vibe: Grunge, depressive luxury, ""I slept in this."" Review: Classic ERD aesthetic. The wash on this is fantastic—it has that sun-faded, dusty taupe color that is really hard to replicate. The distressing on the hood and hems looks authentic. The simple serif font logo is understated but recognizable to those who know. Pros: The wash/color is unique. The crop on the waist looks good for layering. Cons: The price point for ERD is always controversial for something that looks ""destroyed."" The pocket distressing looks a bit fragile; be careful not to rip it further. Score: 8/10

10. Enfants Riches Déprimés (ERD) ""e r d"" Graphic Hoodie (Brown)

The Vibe: Punk, collage art, distressed. Review: I prefer this one over the text-only hoodie. The warm brown tone is rich, and the three-panel graphic gives it more visual interest. It looks slightly heavier/more structured than the grey one. The ""mud wash"" effect is done really well here. Pros: Great color palette for fall/winter. The graphics give it a band-merch feel without being a specific band. Cons: Same as above—extremely distressed look isn't for every occasion. Score: 8.5/10

11. Supreme x Yohji Yamamoto x Vanson Leathers Split Jacket

The Vibe: Grail status, aggressive, high-fashion biker. Review: This is the highlight of the entire haul. The collaboration between Supreme, Yohji, and Vanson is legendary. The split graphic on the sleeves (the abstract/wolf design) looks incredible. The leather looks stiff and heavy, which is typical for Vanson—it will take a long time to break in, but it’s bulletproof quality. Pros: Insane flex. The construction looks top-tier. It’s a piece of art. Cons: Comfort will be low initially; Vanson leather is notoriously stiff. It’s also very loud—you need a simple outfit underneath to let the jacket talk.

I’m a 24, living and working here. Life’s steady — tech, work, a close circle of friends, and a generally peaceful routine.

I’ve realised my social circle has been pretty narrow (5-6), and I’d genuinely like to expand it — meet new people, have good conversations, and hear different perspectives.

This isn’t a dating post or anything rushed. I’m just open to building genuine, respectful friendships, where things grow naturally and at an easy pace.

I enjoy thoughtful conversations, light humour, and low-pressure meetups — coffee, walks, food hopping, or just talking about everyday life, fitness, work, philosophy, or the random thoughts Bangalore traffic gives you.

Bonus: If you’re Marathi, enjoy philosophy, or like deep conversations mixed with humour — that’s an instant conversation starter (but absolutely not a requirement).

If you’re also looking to meet new people in the city and value clear boundaries, mutual respect, and easy conversations, feel free to reach out.

1qr3gcf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fibroids/comments/1qr3gcf/the_dr_dinos_experience_a_canadian_perspective/,"The Dr. Dinos Experience, a Canadian Perspective","⭐️ The backstory ⭐️

Like many of you, I was gaslit for years thinking that my pain and heavy, HEAVY bleeding were normal. I still remember in 2023, the FEMALE doctor at the hospital in Canada who, after 8 hours of waiting and testing, discharged me from the ER (with heavy bleeding and the most excruciating pain) telling me I “just have fibroids, it’s normal”. 

I’M not a doctor. Of course I believed what she said.  How was I to know how bad this really all was? 

It took several more ER visits, months apart, to finally have a doctor take me seriously and refer to me to the hospital gynecological clinic. MRI’s and CT scans revealed endometriomas and “multiple fibroids” and was then referred to a MIGS specialist at Sunnybrook. Months later, the referral declined and another referral made for a MIGS specialist at NYGH. The referral was accepted but the appointment wouldn’t be for another 8 months - May 1, 2025. 

In the meantime, I had my most debilitating pain yet and when I went to the ER, they suspected a burst cyst. Tired of waiting, I took an opportunity while on vacation in Korea to go to a hospital there on the advice of a friend. For $400CAD, I walked in, had an MRI and full consultation with the doctor within 60 minutes. He recommended UFE ablation, recovery, then excision a year later. While this seemed hopeful, it didn’t seem feasible, but it’s how I began my search outside of Canada for help. 

I found the same people you all probably found: Dr. Mitroi in Romania, Dr. Barton-Smith in London, EndoGlobal in Tijuana and Dr. Dinos in Greece. I reached out to every single one via email, as well as a couple of doctors at Cedars Sinai in LA and Dr. Vidali in NY. 

In the meantime, my appointment with my specialist finally rolled around, and it was not altogether hopeful. First of all, she confirmed my uterus being so bulky due to so many fibroids and endometriomas, that she would have to do a vertical incision and that it would be an all day surgery. Secondly, her wait times for surgery were upwards of 18 months. Lastly, and most importantly, she wanted me on Lupron for 3 months prior to surgery and 6 months post. Now, I’ve done my research on GnRH inhibitors and the long term side effects of that were more concerning than the fibroids themselves. I asked if I could decline the Lupron, and she insisted it was necessary at LEAST for the 3 months prior. 

⭐️ The decision ⭐️

So I decided to continue my search elsewhere and the decision came down to Dr. Mitroi and Dr. Dinos, mostly from a cost perspective. Dr. Barton-Smith in London is the only one of the group who agreed with the use of Lupron, which ruled him out immediately, not to mention he was the most expensive. And with tensions in the US, I didn’t want to risk going there. 

Extensive research on overall satisfaction with the procedure and care, I inevitably decided on Dr. Dinos who, thus far, had been the MOST responsive of any of the other doctors. 

Still I hesitated to book the surgery. But in September 2025, when my SIL’s best friend (a top retired gynecologist in Prague) looked at my imaging and asked me why I was waiting for surgery when my uterus was so “destroyed”, I booked with Dinos immediately - surgery set for Jan 26th, 2026. 

⭐️ Travel Prep ⭐️

Now came the stress of preparing for the travel, and where this group came in handy. 

We booked Global Protective Insurance for peace of mind. 

My husband, thankfully, used his airline points to book us both business class tickets to and from Athens. We looked at several Airbnb’s in Glyfada and ultimately settled on this one: (will include link when we leave) - it has 3 bedrooms (perfect because my BIL and their cousin would be spending some time with us) and a short 5-10min cab ride to the hospital, 18-40 mins away from Dinos’ office in Athens (depending on traffic).

Next the packing. Many prior posts already included:

\- the long cable to charge your devices, 

\- a converter, 

\- lip chap, 

\- Gas-X and peppermint oil capsules/tea, 

\- loose (preferably front closing) clothing, 

\- Ricola candies, 

\- Restoralax, 

\- slippers, 

\- heating pads, 

\- extra pain meds 

\- …and pads “just in case” (which I did because me period came with a vengeance during surgery)

But other things I purchased that I found came in incredibly handy were: 

\- a post-surgery (aka front-closing) bra (mine from here https://ca.boodywear.com/products/post-surgery-bra-black ), 

\- a peri bottle for washing up after (https://www.amazon.ca/Frida-Mom-Postpartum-Cleansing-Fridababy/dp/B0DMTRRQPX/ref=mp\_s\_a\_1\_1\_sspa), 

\- and post partum undies (https://www.amazon.ca/Frida-Mom-Postpartum-Essentials-Disposable/dp/B0DM6ZRD9D/ref=ast\_sto\_dp\_puis ) although I also found Knix brand period panties to be great as well! 

\- Lastly bought both silicone ( https://www.amazon.ca/Frida-Mom-C-Section-Silicone-Treatment/dp/B09QRLZQP4/ref=ast\_sto\_dp\_puis) and hydrocolloid strips ( https://www.amazon.ca/Hydrocolloid-Roll-Wound-Care-Size/dp/B0F2ZYHWL7/ref=mp\_s\_a\_1\_3\_maf\_2) for better healing because I scar very easily. 

⭐️ Surgery Prep ⭐️

My husband and I arrived in Athens on Jan 23. Glyfada is a beautiful area, with a main street full of shops, great cafes and convenience/grocery stores. 

On Jan 24, I was to start my liquid diet (broth, water and tea with “as much sugar and honey as you want”) and also have my pre-op appointment at the hospital in the morning as well as an appointment with Dinos at his office in Athens in the afternoon. 

At the hospital, I met my roomie - another fellow Canuck, and we immediately bonded over the failure of the Canadian health care system for women’s health. 

At the pre-op, they take your passport and you pay the €1000 deposit. They also draw blood, run an ECG and ask about health history/allergies, etc. This is also where they will offer you Xanax for the following day if needed. I took them up on the offer. 

Then I headed to Dinos. His office is located in a very non descript building, but the office itself is bright and spacious.

It was our first time meeting Marina, and I was surprised - she was younger than I expected, and extremely lovely. 

And Dr. Dinos - what a sincerely amazing human being. He radiates joy and light from the moment you meet him, and is extremely thorough. 

He did a vaginal ultrasound, with me facing the screen so I could see what he was explaining, with my husband there the entire time. He explained my problem was less about endo and actually the fibroids being the most problematic. Of all the fibroids, my largest one was roughly 10.6cm and occupying space on top of my abdominal aorta, so it was creating HUGE problems for me. 

He repeated what my surgeon back home has said - it would be a long surgery, because of the amount of fibroids and the bulk it created, and there was a chance he would have to do a vertical incision. He also asked other questions like if he found endo in your bowel/appendix/ovaries/tubes, how would you like him to proceed? He was extremely clear about the risks of everything and also very clear that he would not do anything unneccesarily. For example, I had told him that if my uterus was truly too destroyed, that a hysterectomy would be fine. He explained in detail that a hysterectomy is a much bigger surgery than an excision, and too many risks that he simply wasn’t willing to take. It was during this appointment that Marina also gives you the bag of goodies, filled with everything you will need post-care: 

The next day was just to be water and tea, again with as much honey and sugar as you want. This was hardest for me, as I’m a huge foodie. This was also the day to drink the bowel prep drink (green box above) - it wasn’t bad, actually. It tasted like chocolate, coffee and peppermint but with a chalky texture. It was actually the 1L of water you had to drink within 15mins after that nearly killed me. Marina said this drink could take up 4 hours to work, but it took only an hour for me. After that, I wasn’t very inclined to drink anything for the rest of the night (for fear of literally “shitting the bed” 😆)

⭐️ Eviction Day ⭐️

I was told to check into the hospital at 8:30 the following morning. At 9, I was brought to the room, and set up on my bed. 

A nurse came to put on the compression stockings, and I unpacked all my things. This is also when I took the Xanax (3-hours prior to surgery). My husband tells me it worked well, because I passed out shortly after and have little to no memory of my roomie coming back from her surgery, or being wheeled into surgery hours later (although he showed me a selfie took as I was being wheeled away 😅). 

When I woke up, everything was super fuzzy. I am extremely blind without my glasses, so it took me a while to realize I wasn’t in the room I was supposed to be in. But I was also too groggy to register anything. It turns out, I wound up in the ICU and it was 4AM the following morning. I was told my surgery had gone longer than planned (\~9 hours) and I was in the ICU for monitoring. The only thing I truly remember from being there is when they tried lying me flat on the bed, an incredible burning sensation rushed to my shoulders so painful, I was crying for them to stop. They gave me stronger meds to ease the pain. It was definitely very fuzzy for a few hours… a lot of staring into space, at least until 10-11am, when I really came out of it. The nurse there, Katie, was so lovely and you could tell she was happy to be there. My husband was finally able to come in around noon (visiting hours), where he and Dr. Dinos explained everything. Dinos called my surgery a “marathon”, told me how long it took and what he did,  but explained he was able to do it laprascopically! This didn’t really register until later on, but instead of a huge vertical incision, he was able to make 4 tiny cuts. He also mentioned he wasn’t able to get everything because of the time constraints of me being under anasthesia. He left a few fibroids, as well as the endo - which he said was so minor in comparison to the fibroids, and at my age (41), would not likely cause a huge issue as estrogen levels naturally drop after 35. He showed me a picture of the fibroids he had taken out, weighing 6.5lbs all told - basically the weight of a newborn baby. 

They made me do an hour of “physio” where they sat me up against a cushion and made me sit upright for an hour, and took another chest x-ray. After that, they checked my drain and I was approved to move down to the regular ward. I requested, and was lucky enough, to be moved to a solo room. Here, I was finally reunited with my things (glasses, cell phone… basically everything I brought that I thought would help me). 

I got my first meal (I use this word lightly - watery chicken broth with a lemon to squeeze into it, a jello cup and crackers). Dinner was the same, with a vanilla pudding cup instead of the jello. 

The room was SWELTERING, and I wasn’t able to open the window because they didn’t want to “risk complications of pneumonia”. Dinos came to check on me quickly after his last surgery, as did Marina… she helped me get up and walk for the first time. This is when I realized that I had gotten my period, but she was so kind and helped me clean up. She also removed the catheter and made sure I was set before leaving. I was encouraged to try and walk by myself during the night, as well as go to the bathroom. This proved difficult with so many IV attachments - so many that I developed an edema in my left hand from all the liquids built up during the 9hr surgery:

They gave me a compress to try and bring the swelling down, but it didn’t really work. It also made everything a little more difficult as I couldn’t really use my left hand. I did make one trip to the bathroom during the night, but it was such an ordeal with the drain, the IV’s and the catheter, that I was exhausted by the end of it. 

The next morning, I woke up with a nurse changing my IV’s and breakfast of tea with sugar and yogurt. Dinos came by to clean and change my dressings, check the drain and told me that if I could walk around more, I could be discharged. My husband came in and he helped me up to walk. The physiotherapist showed up, though I was already walking, and encouraged me to make laps in the hallway. Dr. Nikos came in to remove the drain. He told me if I passed gas, that meant in HIS opinion, I could eat whatever I wanted after. 

Lunch was provided shortly after, and it turns out I “graduated” to very dry chicken and plain, unsalted mashed potatoes, yogurt as well as another jello cup. 

We let the nurses know after lunch that I would like to be discharged in the afternoon (and learned the hard way that their definition of afternoon is actually evening), so it took texts with Marina to clarify that time with them. I requested before discharge that I get another compress for my hand, the blood thinning injection as well as requesting antibiotics for the UTI I got from the catheter insertion, and an extra pair of compressions as well as extra bed pads (as I had my period and didnt want to mess up the airbnb furniture), all of which I (eventually) received. We were told that blood thinning injections should be taken at the same time every day, give or take an hour. I was also told that I could just wear the compressions at night, as well as for the flights home. 

⭐️ Road to Recovery ⭐️

We left shortly after, paid our bill (\~€13,500), made a short walk to the pharmacy to get the antibiotics for the UTI (prescription received by email from Marina with a barcode for the prescription!), I got a banana, and we made our way home. I made sure to walk around the apartment a lot, and actually felt great! But the gas was UNREAL - my stomach was rumbling and vibrating nonstop all night long. We ordered food to the apartment via the Wolt app - I got a grilled chicken with plain rice, from a restaurant called Sourotiri…which it turns out I didn’t have much appetite for, but the antibiotic needed to be taken with food. 

My night however was miserable. I was so thankful for the bed pads, as my period was as heavy as it’s always been (having to change my pads every 1-1.5 hours) and I found myself so discouraged - hoping I didn’t go through all of this for nothing. But I also knew I was beyond exhausted, overwhelmed and clearly hormonal… aka in no real place to think rationally. I texted Marina about my concerns about the blood loss, as well as the possible effects of the blood thinner injections on my period, some time around 4AM. She responded sometime around 8 and assured me the injections had zero effect on my menstruation, but that I did not have to do them if I didn’t feel safe to do so as long as I “eat healthy”. 

She also recommended Duphaston - a daily pill which is a synthetic progesterone that helps with heavy periods by balancing hormones and stabilizing the uterine lining, which can reduce excessive bleeding and regulate the menstrual cycle - available from any pharmacy without a prescription (€3,40/box). On no sleep, I walked slowly to the pharmacy with my husband. I bought 3 boxes (as I have read the first 2-3 periods post lap can be a little intense). I took one pill right away. I also realized for the first time that the painkillers had probably all worn off and my whole abdomen felt bruised, so I was walking a little more cautiously than the day prior. 

On the way back, I had my first real sit down meal in days - scrambled eggs on sourdough toast from a restaurant called Oh Mama - and my first coffee in DAYS - it was glorious! Of course my appetite wasn’t back up to where I thought it was, so I picked at the toast and eggs and had maybe half of my cappuccino. But highly recommend this restaurant, so many choices for the post surgery diet!

I am taking it easier today than I did yesterday, because of the heavy flow and the painkillers wearing off, but I still managed a walk around the block. 

Post-op with Dinos is in 4 days, and we fly to Barcelona 2 days after, then finally  back to Canada (with a connection) 4 days after that. I will try to provide updates where I can. 

⭐️ Final Thoughts ⭐️

Even though I went to Dinos partially to deal with the endo and, in the end, just got fibroids removed, I couldn’t be happier. 

The part I am most amazed about with this entire experience are the accessibility and communication from Dinos and Marina. NOWHERE back home would you ever be able to text your doctor or nurse to get an almost immediate response all hours of the day, 7 days a week. Even the e-mail communications leading up to the surgery were so clear and quick! The difference between the health care systems in Canada vs elsewhere are astonishing. The number of times I was asked WHY I waited to have the surgery, as if I ever had a choice… even Dinos was incredulous that such a first world nation has such a broken system for women’s health care. 

If you are even thinking about going to Dinos, just do it. It’s worth the distance, and the dollars.

1qr3f9n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qr3f9n,"Recent Pickups. (ERD, Vetements, Acne, Margiela)","1. Acne Studios Long Sleeve Tee (Sage Green)

The Vibe: Clean, minimalist, Scandi-cool. Review: A solid basic. The color is a really nice muted sage/grey—super versatile and works well with both black and blue denim. The centered circular logo adds just enough branding without being obnoxious. It looks like a relatively lightweight cotton, good for layering. Pros: Great colorway. Subtle flex. Easy to style. Cons: It’s just a long sleeve tee at the end of the day. If the blank isn't heavy, it might not feel worth the premium price tag. Score: 7.5/10

2. Vetements ""Vengeful Spirit"" / Cradle of Filth Hoodie

The Vibe: Dark, edgy, oversize heavyweight. Review: This is a statement piece. The sun-faded/washed black effect on the cotton looks really authentic and high-quality. The graphics are incredibly ""loud""—distinctly Vetements style with the heavy metal typography and the pentagrams down the sleeve. It’s definitely not for everyone, but if you are into the opium/grunge aesthetic, this hits the mark. The skull print looks properly distressed. Pros: The wash is beautiful; it looks like a vintage band tee that’s been worn for 20 years. Cons: It’s very aggressive. Hard to wear in a ""normie"" setting without looking like you're trying too hard. Score: 8.5/10

3. Acne Studios Leather Collar Harrington Jacket

The Vibe: Retro, smart-casual, ""old money"" adjacent. Review: This is a classy piece. The contrast between the beige cotton body and the brown leather collar elevates it significantly. It gives off a vintage workwear vibe but with a modern, boxy cut. The snap buttons and clean placket keep it looking sharp. Pros: Timeless design. You can wear this to a nice dinner or just hanging out. The leather collar adds a luxury touch. Cons: The elastic waist hem can sometimes bunch up and make the fit look too round if you aren't careful with sizing. Score: 8.5/10

4. Balenciaga Convertible Camo Cargo Pants

The Vibe: Utilitarian, tactical, oversized. Review: These go hard. The grey/monochrome camouflage is much easier to style than traditional green camo. The best feature is clearly the zippers at the knee—turning them into shorts makes them a 2-in-1 piece, which justifies the purchase. The pockets look massive and functional. Pros: The convertible zip-off feature is a game changer. The fit looks baggy in the right way (classic Balenciaga silhouette). Cons: Lots of straps and drawstrings can be annoying in daily life. You have to be tall or wear chunky shoes to pull these off without dragging the hem. Score: 9/10

5. Nike Air Zoom Alphafly (Black/Red)

The Vibe: Pure performance, technical runner. Review: This is strictly a functional shoe. The exposed Air Zoom pods and the aggressive stack height scream ""marathon runner."" The black and silver with the red gradient sole looks fast. Pros: Probably the most comfortable shoe here for actually walking or running. Tech looks cool. Cons: Very hard to style casually. You can't really wear these with jeans or cargos (like the Balenciagas above) without looking like a gym teacher. These belong on the track or with activewear only. Score: 7/10 (10/10 for running, 4/10 for fashion).

6. Maison Margiela Replica GATs (Pink/Salmon)

The Vibe: Sophisticated, soft luxury, spring essential. Review: Beautiful pair. The German Army Trainer (GAT) silhouette is a classic for a reason, but this soft pink/salmon colorway makes it pop. The contrast between the suede paneling, the smooth leather, and the gum sole is perfect. These look buttery smooth. Pros: Unique colorway that isn't too bright. Extremely comfortable silhouette. High-quality material mix. Cons: Suede on light-colored shoes is a nightmare to keep clean. One drop of coffee and it's over. Score: 9.5/10 (My personal favorite of the lot).

7. Birkenstock Boston Clogs (Black Suede)

The Vibe: Cozy, essential, ""off-duty"" model. Review: You really can't go wrong here. The black suede Bostons are arguably the most versatile shoe in modern streetwear. They bridge the gap between house slippers and actual footwear. The suede texture in the photo looks nice and plush, not flat. Pros: Ultimate comfort. They go with everything—sweats, denim, the camo cargos from part 1. Cons: Suede maintenance. You cannot wear these in the rain, or they are ruined. Score: 9/10 (A wardrobe staple).

8. Acne Studios ""Stockholm 1996"" Tee (Faded Navy)

The Vibe: Vintage casual, subtle luxury. Review: Another solid basic from Acne. The ""Stockholm 1996"" stamp has that cracked, worn-in look that makes it feel like a thrift store find (but with better fit). The garment dye/wash on the blank gives it a nice depth—it’s not just a flat navy blue. Pros: The neckline looks tight and high quality (won't sag easily). Boxy fit is flattering. Cons: It’s a logo tee. If you aren't a fan of branding, it might be too much text. Score: 7.5/10

9. Enfants Riches Déprimés (ERD) Text Hoodie (Grey/Taupe)

The Vibe: Grunge, depressive luxury, ""I slept in this."" Review: Classic ERD aesthetic. The wash on this is fantastic—it has that sun-faded, dusty taupe color that is really hard to replicate. The distressing on the hood and hems looks authentic. The simple serif font logo is understated but recognizable to those who know. Pros: The wash/color is unique. The crop on the waist looks good for layering. Cons: The price point for ERD is always controversial for something that looks ""destroyed."" The pocket distressing looks a bit fragile; be careful not to rip it further. Score: 8/10

10. Enfants Riches Déprimés (ERD) ""e r d"" Graphic Hoodie (Brown)

The Vibe: Punk, collage art, distressed. Review: I prefer this one over the text-only hoodie. The warm brown tone is rich, and the three-panel graphic gives it more visual interest. It looks slightly heavier/more structured than the grey one. The ""mud wash"" effect is done really well here. Pros: Great color palette for fall/winter. The graphics give it a band-merch feel without being a specific band. Cons: Same as above—extremely distressed look isn't for every occasion. Score: 8.5/10

11. Supreme x Yohji Yamamoto x Vanson Leathers Split Jacket

The Vibe: Grail status, aggressive, high-fashion biker. Review: This is the highlight of the entire haul. The collaboration between Supreme, Yohji, and Vanson is legendary. The split graphic on the sleeves (the abstract/wolf design) looks incredible. The leather looks stiff and heavy, which is typical for Vanson—it will take a long time to break in, but it’s bulletproof quality. Pros: Insane flex. The construction looks top-tier. It’s a piece of art. Cons: Comfort will be low initially; Vanson leather is notoriously stiff. It’s also very loud—you need a simple outfit underneath to let the jacket talk.

She relied on her hands, her mind, her stubbornness, her faith that a person forges their own destiny — even when life throws cold stones instead of roads.

Her transitions were never easy. They were abrupt. Sometimes painful. Sometimes frightening.  
Yet in every change, she found opportunity. In every fear — strength. In every fall — a lesson.

She carried her home packed inside a single suitcase, and dreams too vast to fit into any.  
She changed cities, countries, languages, people. She changed her understanding of safety, success, happiness. But she never changed herself. She only expanded.

She learned how to begin from zero. How to smile when things were hard. How to clench her teeth when she wanted to cry. How to keep walking, even when the path disappeared into the fog.

And after all that — one ordinary moment.

She sat in a small café, tucked between the streets of an unfamiliar city. Outside, the sky was heavy. Rain traced slow lines down the window, and yellow leaves fell quietly, as if the world itself had decided to speak more softly.

People hurried past. Each carrying their own story, their own worries, their own dreams. Thousands of strangers — and yet, she had never felt less alone.

She held the warm cup of coffee in her hands and, for the first time in a long while, she did not rush. She did not think. She did not plan. She simply existed.

And in that brief moment, she found harmony — not among her own, but among the whole world.  
In noise, she found silence.  
In movement, she found stillness.  
In the unfamiliar, she found home.

Then she understood:  
A person does not find themselves in one place.  
They discover themselves in motion.  
In struggle.  
In falling.  
In the courage to continue.

And sometimes — in a cup of  coffee, while the rain tells the stories of all the lives moving around you.

Details:

* We connect well: dogs, gym, fitness, music. Progressed slowly: walks, coffees, longer hangs.
* This Saturday: great vibe, she started the kisses, I left late, no pressure/sex.
* Sun-Mon: normal texting.
* Tuesday onward: rejected all suggestions citing this week’s schedule (afternoon shifts + must be available nights for emergency surgeries (there aren’t always emergencies; lots of days there’s nothing to deal with.) + Saturday afternoon shift). Before she’s squeezed in short things during similar busy periods.
* Now 48h since my last casual message, no response from her.

I really like her and thought Saturday was a step forward. I’ve been trying to follow her slower, more reserved style (few compliments, takes things gradually), but I’m naturally more expressive and want to see her more often. Feeling confused why someone interested can’t send even a quick “hey, crazy week” or make 20 min like before. In these almost 3 months, we’ve probably only met up 5 times

Questions:

* Is this typical burnout from her job (vet with afternoon shifts + night on-call for emergencies + weekend work), or a pull-back after physical closeness?
* Could our different pacing (me more intense/affectionate, her calm/cool) be causing this distance?
* Should I wait until after her on-call week or message again asking about her communication when stressed?

Thanks for any perspective — trying not to overthink but it’s confusing me.

  


  
TL;DR: Casually dating 32F for \~2.5 months. Last Saturday she invited me over: dinner, cuddling on the couch watching a series, she initiated kissing (no sex). Sunday & Monday chats were normal. Since Tuesday she’s declined every single plan this week (afternoon shifts + night on-call availability for emergency surgeries + also working Saturday afternoon). Normally she’s open to short meets (quick coffee, 30 min) even when busy, but this week total distance + no messages from her. I sent a light “no worries, whenever you can :)” 2 days ago → no reply yet (now 48 hours of silence from her). She’s occasionally active on IG but zero outreach. I’m trying to match her slow, calm pace (she’s low on compliments, goes gradually), but I’m naturally more intense and affectionate. Is this just “vet exhaustion/on-call mode” or a fade after intimacy?",0,1769773992.0,dating_advice,2,0.25,False

My friend wanted to bring her teen daughters (15 & 12). I like her daughters but we are not friends. And there weren't gonna be any other kids/teens at the event.

So I politely declined explaining this but my friend got really offended. 

She said she doesn't understand why her daughters couldn't come when they're her family & I'm not even paying for everybody's food & drinks. She then suggested she & her daughters will come to the same place for lunch but will sit elsewhere.

The get together ended up not happening due to my illness and we since made up. 

But I'm curious to know your opinion. AITAH for not wanting teens I barely know at my birthday party?


Important to note: 

What is expected for/from birthdays varies depending on the context in my culture. 

Sometimes the birthday person pays at their party for everyone, sometimes they bring their own cake/sweets, especially at schools / at work. Usually they get gifts.

I wasn't in the position to pay for 10 ppl attending my get together. I really considered it more of a informal meet up like grabbing lunch with a friend than an ""official"" birthday celebration. I didn't want any gifts. I just wanted to see my closest friends and family. We did the same thing the year before.

1qr37yv,https://www.reddit.com/r/RomyJuradoBusinessLaw/comments/1qr37yv/from_employee_to_investor_how_to_make_the_leap/,From Employee to Investor: How to Make the Leap with the E-2 Visa,"Have you ever dreamed of leaving behind the daily work routine and becoming the owner of your own business? For many immigrants, working in the United States as employees can be an important step, but true freedom comes when you decide to make the leap from employee to investor. The E-2 Visa allows you to do just that: go from depending on a paycheck to building your own business path in the United States.

In this article, we will show you how this process works, the key steps to achieving it, and why the E-2 Visa may be the opportunity you have been waiting for.

# From Employee to Investor: Why Consider the E-2 Visa?

Working as an employee in the United States has its advantages: initial stability, work experience, and the ability to save. However, this path also has limitations:

* Your future depends on your employer.
* Your income is limited to a fixed salary.
* You have no control over the business’s strategic decisions.

In contrast, the E-2 Visa gives you the opportunity to invest in your own project, have full control over your finances, and open the doors to a prosperous future for you and your family.

# First Step: Build a Solid Financial Plan

Before making the leap, it is essential to evaluate your current situation. How much have you saved? How much capital can you invest?

The E-2 Visa requires your investment to be substantial, meaning sufficient to ensure the business can operate in a real and viable way. While there is no fixed minimum set by law, in practice, investments typically start at around $100,000.

This step is key to leaving behind the role of employee: you must shift from thinking about saving for the future to strategically investing in it.

# Choosing the Right Business

Becoming an investor does not mean jumping in blindly. The type of business you choose can be the difference between success and failure.

Popular options among E-2 investors include:

* **Franchises:** Proven models that reduce risk and offer training.
* **Restaurants and coffee shops:** Businesses with strong local demand.
* **Professional or consulting services:** Ideal if you have expertise in a specific field.
* **Technology or digital marketing businesses:** Expanding sectors across the U.S.

This is where your experience as an employee can work in your favor. For example, if you worked for years in a tech company, opening your own agency or consultancy could be a natural next step.

# Develop a Solid Business Plan

A business plan is not just a requirement for your E-2 Visa application; it is also your roadmap as an entrepreneur. This document must demonstrate that your business will be viable, profitable, and capable of generating jobs in the United States.

It should include elements such as:

* Market analysis.
* Growth strategies.
* Financial projections for 3–5 years.
* Hiring plans for employees.

Moving from employee to investor means shifting your mindset from that of a worker to that of a strategist and business leader.

# The Role of Calculated Risk

Being an employee offers a certain level of security: you know how much you will earn each month. In contrast, being an investor requires taking risks — but the difference is that you can learn to manage them.

By making the leap with the E-2 Visa, you are investing in your own future. The risk is balanced by enormous advantages:

* Unlimited income potential.
* Job independence.
* Building a legacy for your family.

# The Transition for Your Family

One of the most attractive benefits of the E-2 Visa is that it does not only apply to you, but also to your family. Your spouse can obtain a work permit in any industry, and your children can study in the U.S. without needing an additional visa.

This makes the E-2 Visa much more than a business opportunity: it is a vehicle to transform the lifestyle and opportunities of your entire family.

# Common Mistakes When Making the Leap

Many who try to go from employees to investors make mistakes that can jeopardize their application:

* Underestimating the required investment amount.
* Choosing a business without researching the market.
* Not seeking proper legal and financial guidance.
* Thinking like employees instead of investors.

Avoiding these mistakes is fundamental to succeeding in the process.

# Final Thoughts

Going from being an employee to becoming an investor may seem like a risky leap, but with the E-2 Visa, that leap becomes a real opportunity to build your own future in the United States. The key is to prepare financially, choose the right business, develop a solid plan, and take on the challenge with an entrepreneurial vision.",1,1769773503.0,RomyJuradoBusinessLaw,0,1.0,False

1qr35je,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1qr35je/my_family_sucks_i_went_no_contact_but_still/,My family sucks. I went no contact but still struggle sometimes.,"TL;DR ranting about family mostly; struggling with no contact despite my life drastically improving as a direct result of going no contact. 

It’s been one of the toughest things I’ve done. It’s such a weird experience to have when I’ve always known my family was never.. “normal” and by “normal” I guess I mean…happy? Functional? Normal?

I’ve done a lot of reflection since going no contact. I’ve also done a ton of crying too which feels wrong to do. I’m not sad I got out of my situation, I remember packing and excitedly waiting for the move out day. I wasn’t rude or mean, didn’t do any crazy “fuck y’all! I’m out!” or anything like that. It was just quiet, sort of like any other day till I left for the last time. 

Do I miss my family? Sometimes I do, most of the time I don’t. It’s hard to miss the people who both helped and hindered me my entire life. It was just harder to pretend everything was fine, then too hard to keep hearing about my family and their vices they downplay or pretend don’t exist at all. 

Do I want to talk to them? Not really. I know how it’ll go if I do. It’ll be equal parts pissed off at me for not giving them my new number or any way to contact me. Relief that I’m okay, then pissed off again. Or I get to be caught up on all the daily venting about my bum of a brother, my mom begging for money, or how she mixed her medicine again and nodded off on the toilet, my uncle taking pain pills again, my aunt drinking herself half blind. It’s all known things that have been happening for years but nobody cares enough to take action. 

I was the ONLY one paying rent and a separate bill to live in a dirty, dilapidated oversized doghouse when I did live at home. I like my clothes don’t smell like dogs anymore. I like not feeling like I have to go outside to have clean air to breathe. I LOVE the peace and quiet until I get a little paranoid and jump when the mail slot is opened and hear the mail hit the ground. 

It’s like I have my own little piece of forever with my man. I was SO TERRIFIED for him to see my family’s house, though he’s only been supportive and reassuring to me that it wasn’t my fault the house is like that and honestly I know there is NOTHING I could’ve even done to even clean it slightly. I still feel dirty sometimes. I still smell my clothes sometimes to make sure that the dog smell is really gone. 

I love being able to only worry about the small sink of dishes and cleaning is SO MUCH easier when you aren’t picking up after 4 able bodied people who just don’t want to contribute cause someone else will do it. :/ Yeahhhh… that’s what I remind myself of when I get sad. I was the maid, I’d cook, help keep the laundry caught up, helped feed and pick up after the animals. Oh and the best part? My family MAPPED out my entire pay schedule for the year to know EXACTLY what day I got paid while my brother didn’t pay a penny for MONTHS. 

I went from working full time five days a week stressing tf out, coming home to everyone sitting on their phones watching TikTok on max volume while the house stinks to high heaven, the double sink is piled up to the top as usual when I had just cleared it the day before.

Now I wake up and have coffee with my man, tell him I love him and hug and kiss him before he goes to work. I clean, get a shower, play games, walk to the store or something then just chill and wait till my man comes home then we have dinner and talk with our friends, watch a movie or something then go to bed and do it all over again the next day. 

I don’t have to constantly worry about coming home to my man child of a brother nearly 30 throwing a toddler tantrum over shit that could have NOTHING to do with us at all while putting holes in the walls, yelling and screaming, just being the shit-ass he’s always been and always will be. 

Honestly, if I did talk to anyone in my family It’d be to absolutely just lay into my brother and make sure he knows how much I’ve always hated him. I’d also tell him how he ruined my Christmas a few years ago when he OD’d but was brought back. 

Am I harsh? Yeah, but I could be much worse. But, y’all weren’t tormented by him the way my family and I been. He didn’t throw an absolute meltdown when you had to get a 30lbs cancerous tumor removed because it meant he didn’t have a ride to the mall. He didn’t say “can you hurry up and die so i can make your room a game room?” 

Idk. I’m sleep deprived as I type all this out but sometimes I still miss everyone else in my family. Ehhh.. sometimes. The holidays were hard but I knew they would be, I have support group of friends and my wonderful boyfriend to lean on but sometimes I kick myself because I left that environment but I’ve cried so many times. Just thinking about them makes me tear up. I just know truly there is nothing I can do or say to truly get through to them. 

They want me to shoulder all the family burdens but it’s too much for me and any solution I come up with gets WAY more excuses in response. Then I get exhausted trying to work around every 5 excuse per 1 or 2 solutions I’ve given previously so I just.. gave up. 

I feel like I’m rambling about all this but I’m glad it’s all out and hopefully I can sleep tonight because I didn’t sleep at all and it’s 6am now..🥲",1,1769773283.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

In September 2023 I (26F) went on a date with a really nice guy (33M). I was 23 then and he 31. I was a very late bloomer and had never been on a date before or done anything. So I was very pleasantly surprised when this man turned out to be very sweet, charming, intelligent and respectful. He was a high school teacher, teaching history, psychology, religion, philosophy… all which are interests of mine. On the same day we met he asked to kiss me and we slept together, he likely gauged my nervousness as he asked if it was my first time and I said yes. From the get-go I felt very safe with him and he wanted to see me immediately again the day afterward, and that made me giddy. He said he felt special being my first, and that he felt he had a responsibility to be gentle and careful with me. Everything was just better than I ever could have expected it to be. When we met I had, that summer, had a total mental breakdown and developed a lot of anxiety and panic attacks and dealt with loneliness. So, of course, when he came along I felt ”saved”, this is all I’ve ever wanted, I felt a spark for life. After about a month of seeing each other I sent him photos while attending my cousin’s wedding, and he responded with that that might be us one day. He said he felt relieved to have finally, finally have found The One. 



Fast forward to the beginning of January and he started a new job and worked full tile between three schools, one of which he vehemently didn’t like. Before this he’d enthusiastically asked about my week and when we could see each other again but this started to decline, and I found myself to be the one reaching out most of the time. I also got used to us having made plans and then his cancelling last minute, he said he was out with a friend and I’d say it’s ok and we could meet up later if he’d like? But he said no, it won’t be just a little while. And he’d always, before, encouraged me to sleep at his place when we met but now didn’t want me to. I felt sometimes he was in a hurry to get rid of me. I developed a lot of anxiety and fear of him losing interest and leaving me, and he’d become such an important figure in my life it felt physically life-threatening. One time I started crying over this and he wondered what was wrong, and I didn’t know how to say to him I felt like he was drifting away and that I am not enough so I made up a half-true story about a friend I was starting to lose. He went to many Palestinian protests and could cancel our plans to attend, and was saddened he didn’t ask me to come with him as I’d be happy to and when I asked he declined. I wanted to be involved in his life, wanted to meet his friends, wanted to support him in his interests, and was saddened he didn’t seem to want the same with me. He said he didn’t ask about my interests and that was my private thing. I said I didn’t feel involved in his life, and he said ”you’re a tiny planet in my vast universe” which hurt me because to me he was the Sun. He’d told me many times he couldn’t be my everything and I didn’t expect him to but I guess we had different ideas of what being a partner in life means. He said he needed a lot of ”me time” and that was also fine until I’d see him be out with his friends the same day I’d asked if he wanted to hang out. But I felt that I was probably being too much. 



When summer rolled around and he went on summer break I felt that all would be alright. If work is what has caused his lack of engagement then now we would have time for each other and mend what’s been fractured. But one afternoon as I was at his place I get a message on instagram saying that my boyfriend had given her an STD two weeks earlier. My stomach sank. I excused myself to the bathroom and read it again and again and wondered what to do. I went out and showed the profiles picture and asked if he knew who she was. He said no. I said ”Well, I got a very weird message from her just now” and showed it to him. He said ”what the fuck” and took the phone from my hands and I could see he was visibly shaking. But I couldn’t believe it, he was a responsible, sensible, honest man. He couldn’t possibly have. He’d told me many times before how there was people out there who only wanted to ruin him, who was jealous of him. I thought this must be one of those. So I told him to not worry because I didn’t believe her, but that I was curious how she knows about me and why she’d do this. He told me to block the account, that this person is dangerous, and he was worried about it leaking to his students. He was in a hurry to catch the bus to visit his mom so we had to cut it short. But he called me later and said he was coming over and that we needed to talk. 



As it turns out, he did cheat. He did a long monologue about it. He said when I came into his life I was like an angel (he called me that when we slept together the first time) and a gift from God. He spoke of many, many things; his upbringing in a Lebanese refugee camp and then coming to another country with only his mom, not knowing the language, not knowing anyone. His dad died when he was 2 and all his siblings are much older and live in scattered places around the world. I got the impression he had to grow up fast and take on a lot of responsibility, he picked up the language quicker and had to help her with bills and other official documents etc. He was bullied at school for his accent. The police were always hovering over them even though they did nothing. He failed many subjects in high school but then decided his life needed to take a turn; he started taking the gym very seriously, improved his grades later on and got accepted to university to become a teacher. Presently he is a very admired and looked up to person for his students, colleagues, friends. I was very empathetic and moved by his story. He said he doesn’t know why relationships turn out the way they do, that he has sat himself down and tried to write out his struggles etc. Many times but it’s all wound up in the bin. He said he feels that when he gets into a relationship he starts getting anxious, fearing he is gonna fuck something up. He said this woman wouldn’t stop contacting him and sending him pictures, that he’d block her and she would return on another account and then he caved in. He said she had ulterior motives, that she targeted him because he was Palestinian. He said he’d been under a lot of pressure. With my deep fear of abandonment and loneliness, we went back to his place that night and he hugged me, kissed my neck and said sorry, and I started crying mostly because he hadn’t treated me that sweetly in a long time and I wondered why it had to come to this for him to treat me like his girlfriend again. 



The days following he acted like nothing had happened. I said I can’t just move on that fast and he said he just wanted to cheer me up as he doesn’t want me to feel bad. I said well I do and it’s gonna take a while and there is still many questions on my mind so I’d need to talk about it some more just to clear things up. He said there was nothing more to talk about, that I shouldn’t ruminate on it, he is the guilty one so I should just let him suffer. And while on the surface it sounded noble but I really could not move on until I felt he was willing to lay all cards on the table and be honest with me and willing to answer my questions. His attentiveness toward me also didn’t last very long and I found we were back in the same place very quickly. I wanted him to fight for me but I felt, even then, it was me fighting for him. And I developed some ugly behaviors. I was very anxious and suspicious all the time, at night I’d call to say goodnight or I wanted to talk cause I wasn’t feeling well, and when he wrote back he was too tired to talk I’d get suspicious and spam call him until he picked up, I was afraid he was with another girl. I found myself driving to his place just to see if I could see something. I hate that I fell so low and I have a hard time to swallow it actually happened. He finally he broke up with me, but said we should remain friends. 



So we remained friends and though for about 8/9 months I tried to initiate to meet up for coffee or a walk he always had some excuse or other and eventually I stopped trying. He hit me up with occasional ”How are you?” but never wanting to meet or when I wrote back and asked how he was doing he mostly didn’t reply. I’d seen him around town with some other girl and got the impression they were moving in together. As he was moving into his new apartment he reached out and asked if he could use my employee discount at the place I worked, he needed new furniture. I said yes but explained how exploitative it felt, that he only wants to see me when he can get something out of it. He agreed and said that if that’s how I feel then we shouldn’t do it, so we didn’t. Last Christmas he hit me up at midnight and drove out to an abandoned parking lot to tell me he’d missed me, asked me to hug him, get on his lap, fuck him. I asked if he wasn’t dating anyone, he said ”a little” and I asked, ”what does that mean?” And he said ”Shh, don’t think, just fuck me”. So we did that for about a month until my conscience got the better of me and I reached out to the girl I thought I’d seen him around with. Didn’t mention his name or nothing, but asked only if I could ask a yearlong about someone she might know? She didn’t respond but my ex wrote back angrily that I was crushing his heart by reaching out to people with malicious intent, that he no longer wants anything to do with me, to never come near him or anyone he knows and if I do he’ll report me to the police. And he doesn’t want an explanation, I should just pretend he doesn’t exist, and that he will never forgive me. 



I’ve felt near suicidal since this happened about 1,5 weeks ago. I go back and forth between feeling I ruined everything and not knowing what I did wrong. I feel pretty utterly worthless as a person and wondering what the hell happened. All this time he’s been calling me the most beautiful creature he’s ever met to never wanting to have anything to do with him again. I am so very confused and hurt and I don’t have anyone so I feel very alone in this. I feel very powerless and in some childish way the ”loser” in this. Everyone loves him and admires him, he is accomplished in all he does, he is gonna be in a Netflix show. And I am all alone, no friends, barely getting by in school. He wrote a book about how one overcomes personal demons etc. Kind of a self-help style book which is anchored by what different philosophers say etc. And when he sent me the transcript I could hardly read it because all he preached was things I felt was missing in our relationship. I don’t know. And I’ve been flaying my back over and over with my many regrets and I’ve not eaten for a week cause I don’t feel I deserve it. I’ve been hurt but I can’t allow myself to blame him because I feel it’s gonna make me fall into a pit of pure bitterness and resentment. I wish I could explain to him I didn’t reach out to her with malicious intent but for clarity. I don’t even know how she knows it was he I was referring to as I mentioned no name. I may have been spoken of as a crazy ex, I don’t know. I know I’ve not been innocent in this but neither has he but I always find myself being the one sitting with all the guilt and having to apologize. When he was moving to his new apartment he got angry at me for keep asking him out for coffee (after we agreed he shouldn’t use my employee discount he said we should have a coffee instead that week, but he kept coming up w excuses again week after week) and said I had no understanding for him being exhausted from moving and all, and was hurting because of his herniated disc. I said but it’s like this all the time… he said I don’t understand him, he doesn’t want to see anyone right now. I said ok and like a day after I run into him and his friends. And he always said he couldn’t spend more than 1h with anyone, he needs to do something else, but that’s not how it was in the beginning and when he is with friends it seems he is away several hours at the time. I felt simultaneously very clingy but at the same time lied to and avoided. And then he is moving in with someone? How does that make sense? 



Incredibly sorry for this long text I’m just very stuck in this, I can’t get over it or him and I think I’m never gonna do better or meet someone I like as much as him again. I wish I would’ve hated and despised him so I could move on but I don’t. I’m afraid I’ve genuinely hurt him as well as I feel very used and worthless as a result. I don’t know. I don’t know. ",2,1769773246.0,relationship_advice,7,0.75,False

1qr31qn,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1qr31qn/that_time_i_fully_planned_an_offgrid_life_with/,That time I fully planned an off-grid life with zero survival skills,"One time, out of absolutely nowhere, I decided I was going to live off-grid. Like, not in a « cute fantasy » way. No. Full-on life plan. New personality. New destiny.

I bought a van. Bought a mattress for the van. Bought water containers. Survival gear. Tons of canned food. So much shelf-stable food. Stuff that doesn’t need refrigeration. Dried food. Powdered food. Vacuum-sealed everything. I was in full apocalypse / Into the Wild / survivalist mode.

I got a physical map. Drew my route. Started calling random places asking if I could buy a tiny piece of land in the middle of nowhere to live off-grid. I started sketching my future cabin. Watched endless videos about building shelters, filtering water, surviving in the wild, heating without electricity, compost toilets, foraging, all of it.

For about three or four months, this was my entire obsession.

I barely worked. Did the bare minimum of life stuff. And every single free minute, especially at night, I was researching, planning, calculating, comparing, dreaming, stressing, replanning. I barely slept. I worked maybe 15 hours a week max. The rest of my time? Off-grid life planning.

Now here’s the funny part.

I don’t even have a driver’s license.

I’ve never planted a single seed in my life. Not even tomatoes.

I gag when I see bugs or earthworms.

I’m deeply attached to comfort. Like, deeply.

And I’ve literally never gone camping. Not once. In my entire life.

Also… I live in Canada. Where winter lasts half the year and casually hits -20, -30°C.

Yet somehow, in my mind, I was about to become this rugged, self-sufficient forest woman living in a handmade cabin, filtering river water, surviving blizzards, and thriving.

Then, about four months later…

The idea just disappeared.

Completely gone. Like a switch flipped off. The van became just a van again. The food became groceries. The cabin sketches got shoved in a drawer.

And honestly, in my normal state? I absolutely do not see myself living off-grid. Ever. I love my comfort way too much. Hot showers. Heat. Beds. Electricity. Wi-Fi. Easy coffee.

But for those few months?

I was convinced. This was my calling. My destiny. My great escape.

The weekend’s doing that thing where it gives you too many wildly different personalities to pick from. You can go full treasure hunter at the Antiques and Vintage Fair, bounce into an 80s daytime disco, or let Al Murray say the bit you’re not allowed to say out loud.

Add a adults only skate night for anyone feeling brave, a stargazing session for anyone feeling dreamy, and a Vegananuary afternoon on Iron Gate for coffee, food, plus a creative workshop, and you’ve got plans that cover every mood from “I’m browsing” to “I’m on a dancefloor at 3 PM”.

📞 - 01332 985080

Set at Breedon Priory, this family run cafe has rooms, slick service, and a garden feel that makes you linger. Breakfast lands fresh and generous: eggs on sourdough, halloumi and avocado, or pancakes that mean business. Lunch keeps standards high with wraps, salads, and specials like braised beef or pork belly.

Afternoon tea is on too, with sandwiches, scones, and sweet bites. Vegan options included, kids and dogs welcome, and the cake cabinet is dangerous. Book ahead to dodge the hover and hope routine.

Old skool tunes, grown ups only, and a rink full of people suddenly convinced they used to be amazing at this. Turn up, pay on the door, sign the waiver, and glide around to classic R&B and soul with the confidence of someone who definitely stretched (they didn’t). Spectating is allowed if you prefer clapping from the sidelines and keeping your dignity intact.

Coffee is freshly ground, hot vegan food is on, kombucha and sweet treats are waiting, and there’s a creative workshop with Rachel and Mandy so you can make something with your hands instead of scrolling with your thumbs. Professor Leafybean is doing Veganism 101 from 12 to 2, keeping it friendly and easy to follow, plus there’s a small “vegraduation” moment for anyone taking plant based steps, big or small.

Hi folks! New to this sub, but wanted to get an idea of how people make decaf espresso (if you do at all) and how generally it differs from caffeinated espresso. I only really have time to make espresso drinks in the evenings so I haven't done much dialling in of regular espresso. I didn't see anything about this in the sub guidance and also happy to be signposted if this is commonly discussed too!

I'm quite new to espresso but my set up so far is:
Sage (Breville) Bambino
1Zpresso K-Ultra (until I can save enough for a good electric grinde). I use this for 80% of my pourovers generally too.
Plus a basic wdt tool, knodos self-levelling tamper and puck screen 

Ive been usually aiming for 18-20g : 36-40g in about 25s and unsurprisingly it runs much faster and end up grinding much finer than with regular coffee to get it into these parameters. More often than not I find it more on the sour side, but much smoother if I stretch the ratio out to something like 20g in : 42-5g out.

My questions are really - should I aim for the same kind of ratios as with regular espresso? I've seen/read in places that shorter ratios work better with decaf. And how quickly should these ratios actually run generally speaking?

We would say hurtful things and fight for 5 hours. That’s exhausting. We have been together for 3 years. Were looking for house to buy and have a huge trip upcoming. He loved me and I really loved him and supported when he had no money, when he started his business. I was the one putting more effort into relationship, always planned short getaways, small gifts for his achievements and all the things. Fights would always start from my side because I was asking for the same. To plan a date or take me to get coffee on a day off just to spend time together and for me to feel seen. 

Fast forward to last fight we had. He said he had enough and decided to leave. I was the one begging him to stay and think because it is fixable and no relationship is perfect. He stayed but those two weeks were the worst, he got cold and very conflicted inside, he cried, didn’t know what to do, slept at his friends etc. So finally I initiated the talk and he decided that he can’t continue relationship. I was crushed, cried, hugged him and wished him all the best in the world. He left, took his clothes from our house and went to live with his mom. 

Will he come back? How long will it take? What should I do? 

I love him with all my heart. It’s been a month since he left. We contacted a few times about logistics and he was very warm and caring. I said that I will change my behavior and that I hope we will meet again in the future. He said the same but i didn’t get any messages from him about reconciliation.

The first thing I noticed was the pace. Or the lack of it. On second day, we slept till 9 AM without guilt. Birds were louder than traffic.

Staying inside a large coffee estate made a difference. We spent a few nights at a luxury property run by EVOLVE BACK, and what stood out wasn’t the luxury itself, but the space. Private pools. Long walking trails. There was no pressure of work minds were so relaxed. One evening rain started while we were having chai on the verandah and we canceled our plans without a second thought.

Food was another surprise. Local Kodava dishes, slow breakfasts, and dinners that lasted hours. On one afternoon, we skipped sightseeing entirely and just read by the river. No regrets.

If you want nightlife or constant activity, Coorg may feel quiet. But if you want time real time with your partner, it works beautifully. For us, Coorg didn’t feel like a trip. It felt like a pause.",1,1769771407.0,u_Key-Badger5677,0,1.0,False

Free coffee, better job offers, dates that \*actually\* show up on time. Meanwhile, others are doing twice the work for half the reward. If you've ever felt that silent unfairness, you're not imagining it. This psychological effect has a name. It’s called \*\*pretty privilege\*\* and it’s way more real than most people want to admit.



This post is based on deep dives into behavioral research, psychology podcasts, YouTube lectures, and academic books, not shiny Instagram quotes. Because let’s be real, social media is full of people oversimplifying complex human dynamics to go viral. And that doesn't help anyone except the algorithm.

The good news? While looks do matter, they aren’t destiny. We can understand how attractiveness affects perception and learn what to do about it. If you’ve ever felt overlooked or underestimated, this is for you.



*Here’s what the research shows, and what you can actually do:*



\* \*\* **Attractive people are seen as more capable (even when they aren't)** \*\*



  \* The classic \*\*""Halo Effect""\*\* a term coined by psychologist Edward Thorndike, this explains how we tend to assume someone who looks good must \*also\* be smart, kind, and competent. This bias is unconscious and shows up everywhere, from job interviews to dating apps.

  \* A foundational UCLA meta-study backs this up: attractive people were consistently rated as more valuable employees and given higher starting salaries, even when their resumes were identical to less attractive peers.

  \* Harvard psychologist Nancy Etcoff, in her book \*Survival of the Prettiest\*, explains that our brains are wired to associate facial symmetry with genetic fitness, even if it doesn’t actually correlate with performance.



\* \*\* **Pretty privilege extends into legal systems, career paths, and daily life** \*\*



  \* A 2009 Cornell University study found that \*\*less attractive defendants were 22% more likely to be convicted of crimes\*\* than attractive ones, given the same evidence. Let that sink in.

  \* Economist Daniel Hamermesh, in \*Beauty Pays\*, calculated that over a lifetime, attractive people earn \*\*$230,000 more\*\* on average than their less attractive peers. Not due to skill. Just look.

  \* Even doctors aren't immune. Research published in the Journal of Applied Psychology found that patients rated more attractive doctors as more competent, even when they gave worse medical advice.



\* \*\* **But you’re not powerless. You can HACK the perception game** \*\*



  \* \*Presentation matters more than perfection\*  

    \* You don’t need model-tier beauty. Studies by psychologist Amy Cuddy show that \*\*people rate confidence, posture, and grooming\*\* as more important than raw physical features. Nonverbal cues like eye contact, open body language, and vocal tone can significantly shift how others perceive your ""attractiveness.""

  \* \*Warmth and competence are key, not cheekbones\*  

    \* According to Susan Fiske’s research in social cognition, two main traits drive first impressions: \*\*warmth\*\* and \*\*competence\*\*. Attractive people get a shortcut to both, but so do \*friendly people with purpose.\* You can train these traits. Think social calibration, not plastic surgery.

  \* \*Leverage the power of style and intentionality\*  

    \* The YouTube channel \*\*The Style Psychologist\*\* breaks down how intentional style (fit, color, personal branding) dramatically boosts perceived attractiveness. A well-fitted outfit with deliberate grooming can skyrocket how people treat you, without changing your face.

    \* This is also echoed by behavioral researcher Vanessa Van Edwards on the \*Science of People\* podcast: people respond to \*\*intentional energy\*\*. Show up looking like you care, and people mirror that perception back onto you.



\* \*\* **Self-perception influences public perception more than you think** \*\*



  \* Social psychologist Dr. Heidi Grant Halvorson explains in her book \*No One Understands You and What to Do About It\* that we constantly send \*\*""identity signals”\*\*. If you believe you're less attractive or unworthy, you unintentionally project that and others pick it up subconsciously.

  \* A Stanford study observed that when participants believed they were more attractive than average, \*\*they were rated as more attractive by strangers\*\*. Pure perception loop.



\* \*\* **Behavior speaks louder than bone structure** \*\*



  \* The “What Makes You Click?” study by OkCupid showed that while looks got initial swipes, \*\*profiles with idiosyncratic humor, confidence, and emotional openness got more long-term attention.\*\*

  \* Charisma is teachable. Olivia Fox Cabane argues in \*The Charisma Myth\* that things like presence, power, and warmth can be practiced and refined, even if you didn’t win the genetic lottery.



No, this isn’t about denying that attractiveness is a privilege. It absolutely is. But the worst thing you can do is internalize that and give up. There are real, powerful ways to influence how you're perceived without changing your face. Understanding the psychology is the first step. Intention and strategy are the next.",1,1769771251.0,MindfullyDriven,0,1.0,False

What actually causes this difference between us?","This particular matter has occupied my thoughts for an extended period because I cannot determine whether my current situation results from my lack of motivation or has actual validity.

My job requires me to work from 9 to 5 at a standard office position which demands no physical effort. I reach home from work and my energy level reaches total exhaustion. I possess just enough strength to prepare dinner which prevents me from going to the gym because all I want to do is rest on the sofa.

My colleagues return from work exactly at the same time as I do yet they continue their active schedules which include kickboxing and social activities and bar openings. I find it impossible to understand how they possess that level of energy.

My manager demonstrates this behavior because she operates at 45 years of age. She spends her entire workday at the office before visiting her children's soccer match. She will prepare an entire meal from basic ingredients after her workday ends. She mentioned that she attends pottery classes two times every week.

At 6 pm my body reaches a state of complete exhaustion which makes me want to sleep until the next day. The first option examines our dietary habits. I believe my eating habits belong to the normal range but my coffee consumption might be excessive. The second option examines our physical activity levels. The first option presents a workout problem which prevents me from exercising because I lack the necessary energy. The third option attributes the situation to genetic factors. The fourth option investigates whether I have a vitamin deficiency. The fifth option questions whether these individuals are telling the truth about their exhaustion levels.

The scientific explanation for this phenomenon shows why some people maintain their energy while others become completely fatigued. The system functions differently for me than it does for others because I require you to teach me your system. People who complete their second work shift need to be taught to me because I do not understand their energy level.",238,1769770968.0,NoStupidQuestions,119,0.98,False

1qr2dwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/CamGirlProblems/comments/1qr2dwa/3_month_streamate_update/,3 Month Streamate Update,"Hi all! I had issues getting back into my account so only just making my update now for those who wanted to know!   
  
*If you read my first update, I do write a lot. I'm sorry, I just personally like to read all of the nuances and I know some of you liked that too so apologies in advance for the essay - I'll try to bold the key info so you can skim. This isn't advice, just how it's been going for me.*

I think its just about been 3 months of camming now on streamate. I know **I'm still a newbie** but I thought I'd update on what I've learnt and has helped me personally so far and updates after the new tag was lost. 

  
**New Tag & Hourly Rate**

**I've got to put a big disclaimer here - I'm still a newbie. I haven't been in this for long enough to make any absolute statements and I can see that earnings can fluctuate so much so I would take all of my experience with a pinch of salt. Get your advice from the experienced girls. I possibly came into this when guys are spending more online too?**

  
**My first month** (new tag) (nov) I did $81/hr for 112hrs

**Second month** (dec) $100/hr for 75hrs

**Third month** (jan) $116/hr for 72hrs 

I get about 25% from gold and the rest is exclusives or exclusive blocks with maybe 2% privates. 

**80% ish is still from new people** but I've maintained and been gaining some more regulars recently for the remaining 20%. Generally, they'll come in clutch with the gold to save me on slower days haha. Really trying to build up the regulars. I switched up my schedule so lost some of the old ones after that first month and treated it like 'starting again.'   
  
**I try to just aim to hit my hours even if the money is slow** some days and if it's doing well I'll see if I can hang on for a little longer. I've reduced my hours now after the first month with the new tag as I couldn't keep them up that high with my schedule so doing 72-75 a month with my new schedule. 

I also increased my rate to **9.99 for exclusive** after the first 3 weeks of camming and put up my private to 13.99 to try and deter people as I feel much better doing 1:1 and would generally have people going private for 30s and then bouncing. Week to week I bounce between **35-41% time in paid** so I'm sticking with those rates at the moment I think. 

(I have dynamic rates on and I also have my block discount all set up and **have had quite a few 15-30min shows with the block rate**) 

  
**Equipment & Experience Etc**

**This is going to sound silly** but I found the videos from a guy called Yoshi on tiktok who sings '**do you want to pain of discipline or the pain of regret**' and I have him singing in my head before my streams when I'm feeling like I don't want to go on and it kicks my butt into gear. **Weirdly has been the biggest help for me out of anything to stay consistent!** I'd rather feel the 'pain' of getting onto cam when I'd rather chill than have that icky feeling of knowing I didn't hit my target hours when I could have done. And **regardless of the money I've made (yesterday I was WAAAAAY under my target hourly rate) I feel proud that I still got online and did it**. 

I use the **Logitech Brio 4k webcam** and have from the start and its been great so far. And I'm still only using the **1 ring light**. **Haven't got a dedicated mic**. Will only upgrade that when I can see I've stuck to this long enough and my earnings stay decent. 

**I have the Lush which is soooo worth it** as I've done quite a few shows that have made a lot of gold from the vibes and most days get vibe tips here and there throughout my stream in the free chat which all adds up. 

I have great wifi and was doing fine on it with consistent 'excellent' quality but then had one 'shift' totally fucked up by my wifi so immediately went out and got an **ethernet** and haven't had the issue again since. It's cheap and in all of the newbie info guides (**if you're a newbie reading this then read ALL of the guides first as that's where I got all of my info**) on here so definitely worth it. 

I keep some **extras to hand that have been requested regularly** now like heels and stockings and secretary type outfits so I can grab them quickly. I don't have a dedicated cam space so I just have a box for some things that I can pull out.

I was fucking up my knees sitting with them bent for so long so now I make an effort to **stretch them out during my streams** and find better positions to stay in!

I also **make myself a few glasses of water and a coffee** before each stream so I can keep going and stay hydrated as the mistake I made in my first few weeks was just going and going without eating or drinking and then feeling shit after and just crashing out. 

Now that I've been going for a few months, I've been able to get into the mindset that another show will come along. So if someone is suggesting something that I'm not totally feeling or would require a big set up that isn't going to work for me that day, **I feel better saying no because I trust I'll eventually get another show in.** Even if it isn't on that day, I'll hopefully pull a little more another day to even it out.

I generally **judge it by, if the clip ended up on the internet, how would I feel about that.** And weirdly I'd much rather have my naked body out there than me impersonating a dog so it's just figuring out your own boundaries really. But that's usually how I judge it if there's something new I hadn't considered before. 

I've now had a total of **3 people recognise me**. 1 I can confirm I knew and 2 were possible. I just act unbothered by it even if I'm feeling a bit embarrassed because I don't want them to feel like they've 'caught' me. 

**Clips of me are online now**. I went into this under the assumption that someone I know will find out and I WILL end up online so I made all of my decisions based on that. **I see a lot of marketing from agencies saying that you can do this and people won't know but I think it was literally week 1 that someone I know recognised me.** With guys most likely using VPNs more of the time because of the new laws, I don't know how you could geo block effectively.

Let us be clear: footpaths are public property, not private extensions of commercial establishments. Using barricades to obstruct citizens is not inconvenience; it is encroachment.

Cafés often project themselves as spaces of civility, education, and social awareness. Yet here we see the opposite - an educated customer base being normalised into accepting an openly unlawful act. When violations are committed confidently and in public, it signals not ignorance, but entitlement.

My question to the government is simple:  
Is it now this easy to bend the law in India?  
Can private businesses casually appropriate public infrastructure when they have money and influence while authorities look away?

I am teen living in Bengaluru, and even at this age it is evident that the real danger is not one café, but the message this silence sends that public rights are negotiable if you have money or influence.

Once upon a time, at the edge of our neighborhood, there lived a tree with a flair for drama. Unlike the other trees, who were content to sway quietly in the breeze, this one loved attention.","It stretched its branches proudly over the power lines, whispering to the wind, “One day, I’ll show them who really runs this street.”

 

That day came during a stormy evening. The tree shook with excitement as thunder rolled. With a sly grin (or at least, that’s how we imagined it), it leaned just a little too far. SNAP! Down went a branch, right onto the wires. Sparks fizzed, lights blinked, and suddenly the whole block was plunged into darkness.

 

The tree stood tall, triumphant. “Now,” it seemed to say, “you’ll notice me.” And notice it we did. Neighbors gathered outside, pointing flashlights at the culprit. Some scolded it like a naughty child, others laughed at its bold stunt. Kids cheered—no bedtime when the lights are out! Adults sighed—no coffee maker, no TV, no Wi-Fi.

 

But as the hours passed, something curious happened. Families lit candles, told stories, and played board games. Neighbors shared snacks and jokes. The mischievous tree had stolen our electricity, but in return, it gave us a night of laughter and connection.

 

When the power finally returned, the tree stood there, smug and satisfied. It hadn’t just caused a blackout—it had reminded us that sometimes, a little mischief can bring people together.

* Compares averages across all 8 metrics (deep, REM, light, continuity, regularity, duration, sleeping HR, HRV)

Each metric uses age and sex-adjusted benchmarks. Regularity uses a 30-day sliding window with outlier filtering (>2 SD removed).

# The ""SPR"" Factor: Why It’s Not Just Hype

We hear the word ""connectivity"" thrown around so much it’s lost its meaning. But in Sector 70, it’s the actual lifeline of your business.

The sector sits right on the **Southern Peripheral Road (SPR)**. Why does this matter? Because SPR is the artery that connects the posh Golf Course Extension Road to the busy NH-48.

Think about it from a customer’s perspective:

* Coming from Sohna Road? It’s a straight drive.
* Coming from Manesar? You avoid the internal city mess.
* Coming from Golf Course Road? You’re there in 15 minutes.

When your business is easy to reach, half the battle is already won.

# Your Customers Are Already Your Neighbors

The biggest nightmare for any new business—whether it’s a café, a boutique, or a clinic—is the ""ghost town"" phase. You open shop, and then you wait for people to move into the apartments nearby.

Sector 70 flips that script. The families are already here.

You are surrounded by fully occupied residential giants like *Tulip Orange*, *Tulip Ivory*, and *BPTP Astaire Gardens*. These aren't empty towers; these are thousands of families who currently have to drive 20 minutes just to get a good coffee or find a premium salon. That is a captive audience waiting for you to open your doors.

# Two Worlds, One Sector: Luxury vs. High Street

One size rarely fits all in business, and Sector 70 gets that. The inventory here is surprisingly diverse.

On one hand, you have **Elan Epic**.

This isn't just a mall; it’s a spectacle. With its central water body and high-end vibe, this is where you go if you want your brand to scream ""premium."" It draws the weekend crowd who want an *experience*, not just a transaction.

On the other hand, you have **Reach 3 Roads**.

This is an open-air, high-street complex that feels more like a neighborhood hub. It’s perfect for businesses that rely on daily footfall—grocery stores, gyms, or QSRs (Quick Service Restaurants). It’s the place people visit in their pajamas on a Tuesday evening, which is exactly the kind of consistency a small business needs.

# The Verdict: Is It Too Late?

Not yet, but the window is closing.

Right now, **Commercial Property in Sector 70 Gurgaon** is in that sweet spot where the infrastructure is ready, but the prices haven't fully hit the ""unobtainable"" levels of Sector 42 or 54.

If you are an investor, you are looking at steady rental yields because the demand is local and constant. If you are an end-user, you are getting a location that is future-proof.

The center of Gurgaon is shifting. You can either watch it happen, or you can set up shop right in the middle of it.

1qr22tt,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1qr22tt/leave/,Leave ?,"Some advice would be amazing sorry it it’s long and confusing I’m not the best at getting things across and I’m just typing free flow as I’m thinking .

I’m in a 14 nearly 15 year relationship.

Partner is 10 years older than me.

He has had an affair 6+ months  when our daughter was around 3 months she is 13 now. We have 2 other children.

He had a gambling problem resulting is rent debt and more he has stopped since November when I said our relationship was nearly at its limit.

He also at this time only just started to contribute financially a bit because of this also.

I’m not sure but I think he may be abusive ? He over the years has called me names, made me sleep on the floor when he wasn’t happy with things, taken money, thrown a plate at me in anger, poked me in bed when I wouldn’t give him money, if I go to the shops and am a bit longer than usual wants to know when I’m back what I’m doing, I feel on edge a lot of the time, I’m worried about his reactions or what he will say to things/opinions, if I brought him food back from a place and it was cold it would be a problem I didn’t walk fast enough etc, when I found out I was pregnant with all of my babies he just said congratulations and because he has children from previous relationships “he’s done it all before “ nothing ever felt special he didn’t come to appointments with me and would avoid being there  if he could.

He did the same kind of thing when my daughters ended up in a&e for different things too. It would be I’ll come later etc then the need for him to be supportive was gone because it was all sorted.

The affair was made easy by him telling me to go stay at my mums on weekends. I only found out because he tried to end it and she became angry. I was abused over the phone, sent explicit messages, shouted at in the street and more. After it was ended and I said I’m sorting this relationship out I found out he had gone on a drive with her to a beauty spot at they both took photos of a sunset. I found out by spotting the same image on fb on her profile and it matched his with her car in the background. He’s still admant nothing happened but I can’t be sure.

Often if he doesn’t get sex when he wants or certain things in that part of a relationship he gets moody and mean. I’m made to feel bad and I end up giving in.

He often can be quite cruel to the kids verbally and says it’s a joke or that he comes across angry but he isn’t.

I’ve told him there’s a fine line crossing into bullying behaviour.

Since I told him that I had a feeling to end it in November he has made some changes the gambling stopped he’s helping with bills. He did start doing more around the home as I literally did everything for him. He wouldn’t even make his own coffee or lunch if he was hungry. He would wait for me to come home to do it. And say where’s my coffee playing it as a joke but I know he wouldn’t be happy if it wasn’t done.

I also found when the relationship was In an unsecure place he went looking for sex on websites as he “wanted love and attention but didn’t know what to do” he said he just signed up and paid £3 something to read messages but it didn’t feel right and he just wanted me to be with him so he stopped.

I’m not sure how I feel about this it makes me think that it was only a week or so after I voiced it do you really need to be sexual with someone that badly.

He went over the top with Christmas presents for me and paid for all the kids presents. Usually I do most of it. He was over affectionate with massages etc. telling me he knows what he’s done and I’ve been taken for granted and that he’s ready to change. I believed he was and I think it being Christmas and him being so nice that i agreed to try make things work.

We were intimate and that slowly started to become like something that was assumed to be happening all the time. Where I had said I wasn’t feeling like I was interested sexually at the time. I kept trying to be in the mood but it’s become hard. I voiced this and I was told by him it was okay , then that I would have to do things for him so he isn’t getting nothing, on and off it’s been a problem then he changes and says it isn’t. It’s confusing and also off putting when someone is making comments about blow jobs and almost making me feel like I should be doing something.

The doing things around the house has slowly started to taper off and his behaviour slowly is going back to normal with him being demanding and mean with words. Swearing a lot and just being negative about things.

He tells me I’m his world and best friend etc but I just don’t know what to do. I think I love him but it’s not intense like he says he feels towards me. He said that he feels so strongly about me he wants to be one person and that it’s so intense how he feels.

I’m worried about the kids feelings. I’m worried about making a wrong decision. I feel like I’ve taken advantage of him giving me gifts but I kept saying he didn’t need to. He said that I have gone without for so long in our relationship I deserve it. But I feel bad.

He has numerous holidays, stag dos, nights out and trips with friends over the years. While I stayed at home and struggled. I didn’t even get to buy new clothes or shoes, get my hair done or anything without having to beg for them and even then it was a big deal. But he had everything and money to gamble with also. So I know what he is saying is right but I feel bad.

I love him but I don’t think I’m in love with him. Hes upset now because I don’t show him affection or want to cuddle or kiss. Im numb and just feel lost and alone. I feel trapped in my feelings.

I want to literally just have a cup of coffee at UDA. I just like their drinks honestly 🤣 because frankly even though I have a feeling they're gonna be full—that's okay I can find a table eventually.

I wanted to just have a ""friendly"" date for fun. Maybe we can play some games off my gaming laptop or watch some nerdy movie. Or we can watch an anime like Akira to remind us how terrifyingly crazy but significant that film was.

After being depressed for awhile, I'm going to dress up a bit better and really clean myself up. I want to look good and not take care of myself just because I've been depressed.

Anyways, here's some info about me:

- wants to get high on coffee due to being high on stress 🤣

- Yes, you know it—I'm a geek and I'll probably be playing video games today there.

- works a job that deals with numbers and understanding certain laws. A niche financial job considering we're in the Philippines.

- Want a good looking friendly date? Yeah, I can say I'm that. I'm chinito, a skin tone more akin to a Japanese per se, 6'1"", a little bit chubby but I'e been slimming down. I'm rated usually around a 7 or an 8. No, I'm not as good looking as like TOP from BIGBANG, I wish!

- I'll pay for one cup of coffee for you :)

About you:

- preferably someone who speaks English well enough. My Tagalog is not the best.

- kind, decent, not a douchebag, and has compassion because life sucks.

- working professional regardless of field. Yet it would be fun if it's an interesting one.

Options, but a good bonus:

- pretty and tall.....because that would be nice 🤣

- older than me, and can also intellectually challenge my brain in a good way through a topic about life, business, or something completely trivial

In the end, anybody is allowed to message. We can trade photos if you want. 

Happy Friday. I'll leave my house around 8 to 8:30. They close by 1am and stop making drinks at 12.",1,1769769665.0,singleph,0,1.0,False

Then, randomly, a friend dragged me to this UX/UI intro course and I swear something just *clicked*. For once, I actually enjoyed making stuff. It felt like I wasn’t wasting my time.

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

When I work from bed, without exception, one of my ragdolls seems to realise and is obsessed with getting into the bedroom and it's basically impossible to stop him.  If I do, he'll claw at the carpet outside and meow.  When I let him in I leave the door open so he can come and go as he pleases.  What happens then is that he'll make biscuits for a bit before just lying on my outstretched legs.  After a short while his brother will appear and do the same thing, curling up right up against my legs.

They will then just sleep there all day long.  If I get up and make a coffee or do anything, they'll stay there.  They will basically lie on my bed for the entire duration of my 9-5 work, even though they've only been up and about for about an hour at that point.

They have free access to go outside, and have a decent amount of space (large garden & field) to do as they please.  They would rather just lie on top of me though.  I feel like they should probably enjoy the sunshine instead of loafing on me?

Is it a problem if I allow them to sleep when they've already been presumably sleeping during the night?
