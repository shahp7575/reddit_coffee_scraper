1lpmmku,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffeeshopowners/comments/1lpmmku/our_future_coffee_shop/,Our Future Coffee Shop . . .,"Hello coffeeshop owners of Reddit.  I‚Äôve been reading here for some time, learning as much as I can.  I‚Äôm going to try to contribute, with a post on our coffeeshop plans.  It might be interesting, entertaining, horrifying to you in the know - any comments very welcome.

TL:DR buying a house to convert to commercial, to house my office and my daughter‚Äôs planned cafe.

My daughter wants to open a cafe.  Not exactly a ‚Äúcoffeeshop‚Äù; though it will start out as a coffeeshop, over time food will be added and become the main business - think a small cafe in France.  She‚Äôs worked in commercial kitchens since 16, from dishwasher to prep and line to running a kitchen.  However, her coffee experience is minimal, so she‚Äôll be working in a coffeeshop for the next year or so. 

We noticed a sizeable area of our city that has very good demographics, very walkable, lots of restaurants and bars, but only two coffeeshops, one is a chain store and the other is inconspicuous.  It is weird because this city is  otherwise infested with coffeeshops.  

So we started looking for space there, either very inexpensive retail space or space already with a commercial kitchen.  Nope.  Nada.  Nuthin.  I see why there‚Äôs so few coffeeshops here.  How would you open one?  Convert a parking garage?  

Among the way, I started getting frustrated at how much rent I‚Äôm paying for my own office - I have a business unrelated to the cafe plans.  So  we also started looking for a commercial building to house both my office and her cafe, with parking for clients.  Nope.  Nada.  Nuthin.

Well, sometimes fruit falls from the tree and hits you on the head.  I noticed an old multistory house for sale in a promising spot in that desired area.  With one parking space. Found the lot was zoned commercial.  Brought in an architect, spent days studying building and city codes, figured out what it will take to convert to a commercial building; cafe below, office above.  

In the purchase process now.  Then it‚Äôll take up to a year to do the work.  That‚Äôs a long time but there will be lots of sweat equity while tapping my business cashflow to fund both mortgage and construction costs.  Hoping for six months, preparing for twelve.  Then I will get to stop paying rent on my office and start collecting rent from my daughter‚Äôs cafe, and paying just the mortgage.   It‚Äôll be a relief.

So the coffeeshop/cafe part of this story won‚Äôt start until next year.  

For what it‚Äôs worth, we‚Äôve modeled out the cafe business in as much detail as we can right now.  Dayparts, customer traffic, purchase per customer, unit prices and gross margins, labor and related costs, costs for electricity and water, equipment maintenance and POS, business fees and insurance, etc etc.  

We‚Äôve run grim scenarios that I think are realistic for the first several months when she‚Äôs still getting her feet under her.  If she only gets 5-6 customers an hour and they buy a coffee and half a pastry on average, my model says she can barely survive - working the shop alone every day and just managing to make her part of the building mortgage.  Hey, she‚Äôs young and used to working 10-14 hour days on the line; she‚Äôll live.  As awareness and traffic grows, and she ramps up the food menu and staffs up, I think it will be a viable - not ‚Äúlucrative‚Äù but decent - business.  

The office part is easy to figure out.  My current office rent, going up 3% a year, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll ‚Äúmake‚Äù.  All told, I think the building will 
just barely pay for itself over time.  I may be retired or semi-so and not needing that much of an office by the later years of the mortgage, but the cafe can take over the upper floor and I can move into a basement office or slip into drooling old age.  Or she can convert my office to her own apartment.  Who knows!

What else is interesting.  I already have the necessary espresso equipment x3, thanks to a hobby of restoring espresso machines and picking up equipment from closing shops.  We‚Äôre going to put in a full commercial kitchen, which actually may not be the costliest part of the work.  There is a tiny garage that will be converted to roastery - and overflow baking, laundry, etc.  My model says roasting inhouse will be very helpful financially, especially as she‚Äôll have free labor installing, maintaining, and operating the roasting and packaging - that‚Äôll be me.

Ok, knock wood everything goes through, and then I‚Äôll be gutting the kitchen and installing HVAC while writing painful checks to contractors, while she gets experience as a barista and develops her menu, figures out food cost, and plans her social media presence.  

D‚Äôyou think we should do a Youtube or Insta channel about getting this off the ground?  Or is that just going to be a distraction from the actual work.",1,1751430100.0,coffeeshopowners,0,1.0,False

Someone told me to date a best friend, so here I am looking for someone to make great friends with. I'm looking for someone I can share my days with, someone I can spend my free time with. Me-time is great and all, but to commit my time for someone else gives that sense of fulfillment I'm looking for in life. To be vulnerable with someone is a feeling worth searching for.

Primary Complaint: cholinesterase inhibitor sensitivity

Duration: At least one year, probably longer

Not on any medication

Lost tolerance to alcohol after described incident, never smoked or used recreational drugs

I will have to abbreviate a lot here, including most of the details on how this happened, but the basics are this;

  
I was exposed to triphenyl phosphite(101-02-0) about a year ago.  There is no way of knowing the dose at this point, but it was a similar to what my colleagues had been exposed to with no effects beyond minor skin and respiratory irritation.  

After around a 15 minutes, I felt cold, even though it was a hot day, and a little spaced out.  By the four hour mark, I was in full on SLUDGE, and could not find my phone to call an ambulance, and I seriously doubt I would have been able to dial ""911"" if I had.  To give a rough idea of how bad the worst 30 minutes were, I decided to take a bath to warm up, but almost didn't make it out.  Symptoms were less severe by morning.  I am not saying this was a good idea(actually one of my worst mistakes), but I didn't see a doctor about it for months, so there is no cholinesterase test.   I just kind of went through the next weeks on autopilot.

In the following weeks and months, I had something similar to OPIDPN.  

There are two reasons I think this is cholinergic.  The first is simply going over my symptoms with several doctors.  I have a pretty detailed timeline, and they all seem to agree without any reservations that I am describing a cholinergic crisis.  The second is that thinking back, there were times that I was around other cholinesterase inhibitors, in even smaller doses that coincided with a few days of flu like symptoms.  In one case I handled fire retardant materials which used a little bit of triphenyl phosphate(115-86-6).  The symptoms went away when I started wearing nitrile gloves for that operation. I didn't think much of it at the time, but the pattern is really obvious in retrospect.  

  
Where this all gets complicated is the dose.  I don't know exactly what it was, but it was in a material at a concentration that is small enough to not even be mentioned on a SDS.  

The simple explanation that a toxicologist put forward was that I had weeks of exposure to AChE inhibitors leading up to the incident, and that is what pushed me over the edge.  He also said that there are other explanations that he will look into.  We both don't find that a satisfactory answer because of the question of ""why me vs. other people with the same exposure level?""

Other details about me;

\-Blood cholinesterase at 8 months was right in the middle of the normal range  


\-No general intolerance or distrust of ""chemicals""

\-I also react badly to coffee and tomatoes now

\-No unusual health history in family

\-Very little in the way of medical history in general.  I had a series of bacterial infections age 8-11, and I reacted badly to cefixime and metronidazole.",1,1751429783.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Around the same time, he and my brother were traveling, and my brother went to some outlet stores. He asked if I wanted anything. I told him yes‚Äîif he saw a handbag that was black, white, or neutral (not flashy), and preferably without gold hardware, I‚Äôd be interested. To help him out, I sent him a video of a bag I already owned to give a better idea of the style I liked.

He was really nice about it‚Äîwent to check, took photos, all that. He showed me a bag that I thought was black with silver detailing. I liked it, and even asked him to use a coffee cup for scale. Based on all that, I said okay, and he bought it for me.

He brings it back‚Äîand it‚Äôs navy blue. Like, clearly navy. The tag even says NAVY. And it‚Äôs super obvious when placed next to anything truly black (which matters to me because I wear a lot of black and I honestly, do not like the colour). On top of that, it‚Äôs a long-strapped crossbody bag, not the handbag style I asked for. There‚Äôs no way to shorten the strap either.

I got really upset and gave it back to him, telling him to either sell it or keep it because I really can‚Äôt stand navy and it‚Äôs just not what I asked for. He said it‚Äôs just ‚Äúone shade off‚Äù and that he won‚Äôt use it, and told me to keep it or sell it myself. But honestly, I don‚Äôt even want to deal with it.

Around the same time, he and my brother were traveling (I was back home and not with them), and my brother went to some outlet stores. He asked if I wanted anything. I told him yes‚Äîif he saw a handbag that was black, white, or neutral (not flashy), and preferably without gold hardware, I‚Äôd be interested. To help him out, I sent him a video of a bag I already owned to give a better idea of the style I liked.

He was really nice about it‚Äîwent to check, took photos, all that. He showed me a bag that I thought was black with silver detailing. I liked it, and even asked him to use a coffee cup for scale. Based on all that, I said okay, and he bought it for me.

He brings it back‚Äîand it‚Äôs navy blue. Like, clearly navy. The tag even says NAVY. And it‚Äôs super obvious when placed next to anything truly black (which matters to me because I wear a lot of black). On top of that, it‚Äôs a long-strapped crossbody bag, not the handbag style I asked for. There‚Äôs no way to shorten the strap either.

I got really upset and gave it back to him, telling him to either sell it or keep it because I really can‚Äôt stand navy and it‚Äôs just not what I asked for. He said it‚Äôs just ‚Äúone shade off‚Äù and that he won‚Äôt use it, and told me to keep it or sell it myself. But honestly, I don‚Äôt even want to deal with it.

I guess I can start by saying I have no freaking idea how I got here. I am not sure how or when the feelings I have for you developed but they are there and they are strong. What's crazy is that I don't really know you. The real you. I know work you. I know the kind of person you are at work. I know that you don't like cheese. You don't really like many condiments on your food. You're not much of a coffee drinker. You drink both wine and beer but prefer beer. That's it. That's all I know but for some obsurd reason that's enough for me to admit to myself that I have completely fallen head over heels for you or at least the version of you that I know.

Then I keep thinking, am I this delusional? Is this an obsessive thought that lingers through my brain 24/7? Is this what stalkers think about day in and day out until the police gets called on them
because they decided to act on their intrusive thoughts? Is this limerence as so they say? Again, I don't know.

I replay these interactions between us over the years to tell myself that there is absolutely no freaking way I came up with this idea on my own. I mean you flirted with me right ? You've held eye contact with me so long that it felt like you were trying to find out what my soul looked like through my eyes, right ? I mean C'mon it couldn't have just been me feeling this . There must have been some tiny part of you that felt an ounce what I feel. There has to be ! 

But then I remember Ive told you this before. Not in its entirety but a fraction of it. How
I cringe thinking about it. I was drunk after a get together with you and others. I heard that you were going out of your way to get your significant other something to eat. I wasn't jealous I was mad. How dare she treat you like that. Like your some delivery boy. And boom just like that I told you that I loved you. I don't think you believed me though. I apologized and blamed it on the large amount of alcohol I drank that day. Gosh that was stupid. Sadly never confessed your undying love for me that day. You just gracefully understood my inebriation & let bygones be bygones. 

So every year on 09/13 I tell myself, "" you're going to stop loving him. He doesn't love you. You're not his type. He has her and you have someone else. Just stop"". I haven't been successful yet. I am waiting again this year on 09/13 to try to let go of you let's see If I can do it. 

I even looked and applied at other jobs hoping that If I worked somewhere don't see you anymore this feeling will fade. 

I love you ""bee"" but I just can't do this to myself anymore. So i'm hoping that confessing to the million stranger on reddit will help me in my journey to forgetting you.

Anyways, here's my top 25 plays YTD. Overall I've logged 225 plays over 40 games solo. What are some of this year's hits for you? My quick recap:

Shelf of shame - Mage Knight and the Lost Legion expansion. I got them at the end of April knowing it would be a few months before I could play them, but for $90 delivery felt like it was a deal. 

Best new games (to me) of the year - even though I've only played it a couple of times, I really enjoy Ark Nova. Skara Brae is brand new but I've really enjoyed it as well. On the lighter side, I enjoyed a Dorfromantik campaign and found that to be enjoyable despite being so light. 

The heavyweights - Spirit Island remains my favorite game to play solo, but I'm almost exclusively playing two handed which I think makes games 3X longer. TES:BOTSE is massive, but it's such a time commitment I'm not sure how often it'll get to the table. Ezra and Nehemiah, Dune Imperium Uprising, and Ark Nova I've really enjoyed. 

Solo challenges galore - I've got a number of games that I'm trying to complete solo challenges for, some closer than others. Completed Hadrian's Wall and Dorfromantik earlier this year. Getting close on Under Falling Skies and For Northwood! Still a long way to go on Fliptown and It's a Wonderful World. Haven't even started Marvel Champions or The Anarchy yet. I've got my work cut off for myself the second part of the year!

Watch list - Unstoppable, Aeon's End, or Slay the Spire for deck building boss battlers, Vantage for a unique explorer game, and A Gentle Rain for a nice light travel game. Got plenty to keep me occupied for now though!",12,1751428427.0,soloboardgaming,0,0.88,False

The only sounds were the occasional coughs from one of the Mexicans who seemed to have a cold after a long trip. We finally made it to the jungle which was our halfway point to the temple. It was a lot louder now the sounds of birds chirping or something hissing were abundant.We were on the way on horseback so I quickly noticed when the coughing Mexican fell from his horse I yelled out and we stopped.The American man said ‚ÄúCheck his uncovered parts for bite marks‚Äù to the other Mexican man and as he expected he yelled out to me ‚ÄúJust a snake bite He's dead Let‚Äôs just keep moving‚Äù I had no choice but to listen to the man and just keep going.We finally made it and the temple was weirder than I imagined The voices of the people I killed still echoing in my head.Large stone eyes stared right at me the temples carving showed sacrifices and suns all over the outside walls the American man finally said ‚Äúbetter than I imagined well no point waiting let‚Äôs go into it‚Äù I hopped off my horse and tied it to a nearby tree I followed the Mexican and the American man into the temple. Inside it was dark with some bit of sunlight peeking through the cracks in the infrastructure The man lit a torch and told the mexican to walk forward I tried to follow the Mexican but the American man stopped me as I looked back to the Mexican I saw a arrow in his neck with red blood oozing from his wound it was as red as crimson under the torches light and the way he looked at me to help him made me feel like he was god judging me to hell for all of my problems the American man looked at me and said ‚Äúlisten he was dead weight and we are intelligent we can‚Äôt be letting people like that weigh us down he showed us which floor tile to not step on now all we need to do is continue our way down there I looked at him with disgust but I knew there was nothing I could do so I just said ‚Äúalright‚Äù.As he led me through the dark temple I felt uneasy like their was a dark force staring at me watching me judging me of all my wrongdoings.The American man lead me to the biggest room in the temple.there was an altar he moved me close and closer to the altar and said ‚ÄúJackson I‚Äôm gonna need you lay on that altar‚Äù I turned around and I saw him holding me at gunpoint and his mouth opened and I already knew what he was gonna say because I‚Äôve lived it in my dreams this was the part I kept forgetting.‚Äùthe rumours about you being a retarded farm kid way over his head were true‚Äù This is the altar of judgment,the scriptures that I have read told me that if I bring blood of a murderer to this altar that the god of this temple will grant a wish from my deepest desires. I stared at him in awe he was looking up at the statue but he seemed to be blinded by the wish he forgot what was standing in his way I quickly pulled out my pistol and shot him in the head.His Head was blown off his eyeball was on the altar his skull fragment ripped through the air and I stood there standing but still no silence not like the first time I killed but I looked on the altar and the eyeball was oozing blood, blood from a murderer.Before I could react I looked up and I saw it. It‚Äôs skin looked like it was stapled on, it stood at 10 feet staring down at me it‚Äôs skull shape made a crown on his head and the skin of it looked like it had been melted by the sun The long arms reached down and grabbed the eyeball and It took a bite and swallowed the its meal the thing was so skinny you could see the eye travelling down its neck into its gullet.Its of its grotesque teeth fell out from that one bite but new ones grew out of its disgusting gums.   I felt the air thicken as it started to lick its lips and my blood pressure rose with every action and in my final moments I knew I‚Äôd never see the sun again. It‚Äôs clear that is not a human that's a god.Before I knew it I woke up on the farm where I grew up where I had to relive the day I killed my parents.I walked to dinner waiting to relive the moment I heard the yelling from my pap as he beat my mom so I ran into the barn and grabbed the revolver and ran into the kitchen aimed the gun and fired it wasn‚Äôt a direct hit but it was a lethal one my father laid on the ground covering his neck which was pouring blood and walked to him I saw my mom laying there with her head half sunken in and wheezing. I aimed the gun at her head and fired. There was silence for once in my life and the silence calmed me.There were 3 bullets in that gun one for my mother,one for my father and one for me but I was too scared to pull the trigger back then. My only wish was for the silence to return so I could finally stop hearing my sorrow regrets but now my wish was fulfilled. I felt the silence once again as the god crushed down upon me with its righteous hand.

Over the last 12 years she had a few short-lived blips of sobriety after major events (losing her job because she blew positive at work, losing her ability to walk due to nutritional deficiencies (which she fortunately recovered through PT and pancreatic enzymes), periodically losing her ability to work due to bowel incontinence/GI problems, etc.). The drinking ended this time in December when I found her in withdrawal shakes and took her to detox/rehab a couple days before Christmas; this time really does seem different in terms of her drive to stop drinking. She's been sober for over 6 months now and is going to regular AA meetings, has a sponsor, etc.

That being said I think I expected her quality of life to increase dramatically post-alcohol and it hasn't and it's hard to watch. She still is pretty isolated overall, she's long divorced and lives alone, was fired from her coffee job \*after\* getting sober (probably because she was so unreliable as an employee while she was still drinking that she was belatedly dealing with the consequences of her absenteeism), and she has very few close friends now. In a manifestation of cosmic cruelty, my aunt (her younger sister) died unexpectedly of pancreatic cancer in March and we are all still grieving but especially my mom. I think my mom spends most of her time when she's not at meetings at home on her phone and watching TV shows. She has nothing to give her a sense of purpose, has long been diagnosed with depression, and concerningly has been sleeping for an increasing number of hours per day.

My mom was not an abusive person to me as a kid or as a young adult, and it's been harder for me to identify the ways in which my mom's drinking directly affected me than I know it is for many other people. (Acknowledging that I'm relatively lucky here). But reading through some posts tonight I'm coming to terms with how her emotional dependency on me has been higher than what's normal for a parent. This often took the form of her showing excessive emotion when my visits home were concluding and I was leaving to go back to college, then grad school, and now my life on the opposite side of the country. In the past, seeing her get weepy or clingy in these moments conjured a sort of ""disgust"" reaction from within me -- a feeling that in hindsight is telling me that something was inappropriate about what my mom was demanding from me, but that I hadn't been able to name.

So I guess the internal questions that I'm parsing through are -- what do we owe our adult alcoholic parents if they're now sober, if they aren't the sources of tremendous trauma and abuse, but if their lives are still ultimately unhappy and tragic because of THEIR own choices? Do I feel this level of obligation to intervene because I've carried the weight of my mom's emotional dependency on me since childhood, or is it appropriate in this case to think of my mom more as just an aging mom who needs more care from an adult child, as all elderly people do at some point in time (even if my mom has aged prematurely)? I have a partner, career, community, and overall full life on the other side of the country that I'm not planning on abandoning, so for now I'm pretty limited to visiting and calling more often and checking in more proactively with her to make sure she's staying on top of things, but I worry that I'm not doing enough and also anxious about the future (what will happen if her health abruptly declines? what if she needs more support and I'm called on, as an only child, to do much more?)

Anyone else been parsing through something similar and found anything to be helpful? ",2,1751428214.0,AdultChildren,1,1.0,False

There were plenty of open spaces, but I parked next to a shiny white SUV simply because it was shaded under a tree. I double-checked‚ÄîI was perfectly within the lines, not even close enough to touch her mirror if I tried. That‚Äôs when I heard it: the dreaded cough of confrontation.

""Excuse me,"" a shrill voice snapped. I turned to see a woman in oversized sunglasses, arms crossed, expression like she‚Äôd just sniffed sour milk. ""You‚Äôre way too close to my car. Are you trying to damage my property?""

I blinked. ""No, ma'am. I‚Äôm parked legally. There‚Äôs more than enough room.""

She took a dramatic step toward my car and gestured wildly. ‚ÄúThis is harassment. You're threatening my personal space!‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt help it‚ÄîI laughed. That was apparently the trigger, because she whipped out her phone like it was a weapon. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm calling the police,‚Äù she hissed. ‚ÄúYou people think you can just do whatever you want.‚Äù

You people? Alarms started ringing in my head, but I stayed calm. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not doing anything illegal,‚Äù I said, pulling out my phone and starting to record. Karen, as I started calling her in my head, stomped away, still yelling into the phone.

Fifteen minutes later, two squad cars pulled up. Karen strutted toward them like the queen of drama, her voice louder than ever. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the one! He threatened me, parked inches from my car, and started recording me without my permission!‚Äù

The officers walked over to me. I calmly showed them my license, registration, and the video I‚Äôd taken‚Äîfrom the moment she approached to her yelling about calling the cops. They watched quietly, occasionally glancing over at Karen, who was now pacing and fake-crying like she was auditioning for a soap opera.

After a minute, one of the officers asked, ‚ÄúDid you touch her car?‚Äù

‚ÄúNope,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt even breathe on it.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you threaten her?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot once. Just parked and tried to enjoy my coffee.‚Äù

They nodded and walked back to Karen, who instantly turned up the dramatics. ‚ÄúHe was aggressive! I feel unsafe! Arrest him!‚Äù

But instead of putting me in cuffs, they asked for her ID. She scoffed. ‚ÄúWhy should I? I‚Äôm the victim!‚Äù

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam,‚Äù one of the officers said, his tone shifting, ‚Äúyou made a false report. We‚Äôve reviewed the footage and spoken to witnesses. He‚Äôs not in the wrong.‚Äù

Karen‚Äôs face went pale. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre taking his side?!‚Äù

The officer repeated, ‚ÄúWe need your ID.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù she shrieked, and that‚Äôs when things escalated. She tried to walk away‚Äîfast‚Äîbut another officer stepped in her path.

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, don‚Äôt make this worse.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not doing anything wrong!‚Äù she screamed, pushing the officer. That was it. They warned her once, then placed her under arrest for obstruction and filing a false police report. Her screams turned into full-on shrieking tantrums as they led her to the car, onlookers filming with their phones.

I watched, sipping my now-lukewarm coffee, stunned and amused. One of the officers came back over, shaking his head. ‚ÄúSorry you had to deal with that. Some people think the world revolves around them.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúGuess parking too close to a Karen is more dangerous than I thought.‚Äù

He smirked. ‚ÄúAt least justice was served.‚Äù

I saw a neurologist a few years ago who diagnosed me with hemiplegic migraines. I'm fine most of the time with just b2/riboflavin supplements but recently started my own business. I have ADHD and would like to take Adderall again since I have a crazy work load.

Basically if I have any nicotine/caffeine/coffee especially paired with a lack of sleep, a day to three days later for about 20-40 seconds my right leg and arm will paralyze and it feels like blood is flowing through my eyes and ears super hard with a fish bowl effect. Thankfully I can feel my right side start twitching and give me about a 40 second heads up that I'm getting an attack.

Depending on the severity of it, it can leave me with really bad brain fog and emotional irritability, especially if I get multiple of them. I had a really bad one last year after a cup of coffee from barely sleep and was left feeling like I had a seizure after, confused where I was, all bad.

I'm looking to see if any medications I can kind of take as needed for the weeks I AM drinking/taking stimulants. Brain medications affect me differently due to my ADHD I guess. My first dose of Gabapentin kept me awake for 4 days straight.

I have GI issues too and in the past was prescribed tricyclic antidepressants but make me go fucking crazy and can't take them. I was on Remeron for two years and it completely destroyed my short term memory, emotions, and took another two years after getting off of it to feel normal again(with my memory garbage now) so I'm very hesitant on trying anything that messes with your memory.

Any medicine or treatments for this where I can actually drink some caffeine or take my medication again would be very appreciated. I'm extremely apprehensive about taking a daily medication due to my experiences with them and potentially losing my insurance with the current political climate if I am on something I need daily.

There is an explanation of this decision below. It is a long explanation, and we didn‚Äôt make it lightly","Researching this company makes a guy feel pretty helpless. Nestle is so hard to avoid it almost feels like you can‚Äôt and though AI can help with this, we were still uncomfortable promoting its use, so we went over to the R/antiai subreddit to get their thoughts, and here was the guidance we got from u/scamaltman (no really), while he was shitting at work:


‚ÄúWhy AI is ethically acceptable for this research:

AI concerns center on creative displacement - artists losing jobs to generative systems. Corporate accountability research is fundamentally different. You're using AI for data aggregation that would take hundreds of hours, not replacing human creativity.

The force multiplier is massive: AI can analyze thousands of documents, cross-reference brand ownership across 2,000+ products, and identify patterns in minutes that would take a research team weeks to uncover manually. When you're facing a corporation operating in 188 countries with sophisticated legal teams, this technological advantage becomes essential for effective accountability work.

Nestl√© operates AI systems across 15,000 marketers to manage reputation while committing documented human rights violations. Using AI for research against this technological imbalance isn't ethical compromise - it's defensive necessity.

The tool choice matters for ethical consistency: open-source models like DeepSeek R1 perform comparably to GPT-4 without funding potentially problematic AI companies. This means you're not paying OpenAI or Anthropic (who have military contracts and questionable labor practices) while investigating corporate misconduct. DeepSeek is developed by Chinese researchers and released freely, avoiding the hypocrisy of funding Silicon Valley AI giants while criticizing corporate behavior. For an anti-AI podcast, this distinction between corporate AI exploitation and open-source research tools is crucial for maintaining credibility.

Nestl√©'s documented violations span decades and continents:

Colombian union assassinations: Luciano Romero Molina murdered in 2005 after exposing expired milk use. Three more unionists killed in 2013, Oscar L√≥pez Trivi√±o in 2019. No executives held accountable.

Child labor: 1.56 million children in West African cocoa farms. Supreme Court dismissed cases from eight Malian child slaves in 2021. Source: Washington Post

Baby formula deaths: 10.87 million infant deaths (1960-2015) linked to Nestl√© marketing in areas without clean water. Source: Corporateaccountability

Water privatization: CEO called water rights ""extreme."" Extracts millions of gallons during droughts while communities lack access. Source: Lakotalaw

Strategic boycott targets by financial impact:

Focusing on high-impact, high-visibility products prevents vigilance fatigue while maximizing results. Asking people to avoid 2,000+ brands is overwhelming and leads to abandonment. Targeting 3-5 flagship products creates manageable, memorable campaigns that people can actually sustain. The psychological research is clear: specific, achievable goals generate more participation than comprehensive but impossible demands.

Most impactful: Water brands (Perrier, San Pellegrino), baby formula, coffee (Nescaf√©, Nespresso) - highest margins, daily purchase decisions, and maximum symbolic impact

Moderately impactful: Pet food (Purina brands - 20.2% of sales), chocolate (KitKat, Smarties), frozen foods

Least impactful: Condiments (Maggi), health products (Boost)

Strategic focus also amplifies media coverage. Journalists can easily explain ""boycott Nescaf√©"" but struggle with complex brand ownership charts. Clear, simple targets generate the reputational damage that actually changes corporate behavior.

Historical precedent shows boycotts work: The 1977 baby formula boycott forced WHO Code adoption and policy changes after Nestl√© spent $100 million fighting $3.5 million in boycott costs. Research confirms boycotts succeed through media coverage and reputational damage, not direct sales impact. Source: Wikipedia

Bottom line: Using AI to expose corporate crimes involving union assassinations, child labor, and infant deaths isn't just acceptable - it's morally necessary when facing sophisticated corporate accountability evasion systems.‚Äù

So, with U/scamaltman‚Äôs backing, we decided to suggest it. If you aren‚Äôt comfortable using ai for this, we understand, but if you feel comfortable using it to fight the power, this is a pretty damn good way to do just that.

1lplky0,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1lplky0/something_is_hunting_my_cattle_and_its_not_human/,Something is Hunting My Cattle and It's Not Human,"My name is Jebediah Stone. I'm makin' this recording because... well, because I don't know what else to do. I'm hopin' maybe someone out there, somewhere, has seen what I've seen. And can maybe tell me I'm not goin' crazy.

I‚Äôve lived on this ranch my whole life, just like my daddy and his daddy before him. We‚Äôve ranched this land since Texas was still a republic. My granddaddy taught me how to read the clouds, how to know the land so well you could feel it talkin' to you through the soles of your boots. It‚Äôs a language of its own‚Äîthe rustle of mesquite, the lowing of cattle, the sounds of the night. Or at least, it used to be.

That's where this all started. Not with the lights, not with the... things I found in my fields. It started with silence. About three years ago, the coyotes just... stopped singing. One night they were yippin' and carryin' on like always, a rowdy choir spread across the plains. The next... nothing. The whole prairie went dead quiet.¬†

For a few nights, I'd sit out on the porch after sundown, my coffee gettin' cold in my hand, just listenin'. The silence was so heavy it felt like a physical weight. My two heelers, who'd normally be sniffin' around the yard, would just lie by the door, whimpering low in their chests, their ears flat against their heads. They knew somethin' was wrong, too. The crickets were gone. The birds didn't sing their morning song the next day. It was just dead air. Like the whole world was holdin' its breath, waitin' for somethin' awful to happen.

¬†\-

At first, I chalked it up to the way of things. Nature is mysterious. But what I found a week after the silence started... well, that‚Äôs the real reason I'm makin' this recording.

It was a Tuesday. I was out in the truck, checkin' the fence line out by the north stock tank. It‚Äôs rugged country out there, all gullies and rock. I saw a dark shape down by the water, figured a heifer was just lyin' down in the shade. But she didn't move as my truck rumbled closer. My stomach tightened a bit. I got out, my rifle in hand just out of habit, and walked over.

It was one of my best Charolais heifers. And she was dead. My first thought was just a weary sigh, another loss to tally. But as I got closer, I saw it. The scene was... wrong. I circled her, lookin' for tracks. Cougar, wolf, bear... anything leaves tracks. There was nothing. Just my own bootprints in the dry dust.

Then I saw the body itself. There was no blood. None. The ground around her was clean as a preacher's collar, not a drop spilled. But her tongue had been cut out, right at the root. Her udder, too. Both gone. My stomach turned. I've seen what predators do. It's a messy, violent business of tooth and claw. This was‚Ä¶ clean. The cuts weren't torn or chewed. They were perfect circles, like they'd been made with a white-hot drill. I reached down and touched the edge of one. The flesh was black, smooth, and hard, like sealed plastic. It was cauterized.

I knelt there, the unnatural quiet of the field pressing in on me, my hand resting on the stock of my rifle, though I had a sick feelin' it wouldn't be any use against this. I've seen snakebites, anthrax, cattle rustlers, and droughts. I'm a God-fearing man. I was raised on the Good Book. I believe there's a Heaven above and a Hell below, and I believe the Lord has a plan for all his creatures. But I've read my Bible cover to cover, and there ain't a single verse in there that prepares you for somethin' that doesn't bleed.



The days after I found that first heifer were thick with a quiet dread. I did what any rancher would do: I called the sheriff. Old Bill Gillespie drove his dusty cruiser out, took one look at the carcass, and scratched the back of his neck. He‚Äôd seen a lot in his forty years of law enforcement, but he'd never seen anything like that. He talked about maybe some new kind of cult, took some notes in his little pad, and told me to keep my eyes open. I knew then that I was on my own. No lawman had a manual for dealing with something that left no tracks and used a scalpel made of heat.

The silence on the ranch deepened, and the animals felt it most. It wasn't just my dogs cowering on the porch anymore. The whole herd was spooked. They started staying in a tight, defensive bunch, their heads always up, always watching. They wouldn't go near the north pasture, not even for the good grass. One night, a noise like thunder woke me from a shallow sleep. The whole herd was stampeding, a wave of panic in the dark. I grabbed my rifle and jumped in the truck, my heart pounding, expecting to find rustlers or a whole pack of wolves. But when I got there, there was nothing. Just the cattle, wild-eyed and trembling, bunched up against the farthest fence line, staring back at the empty, silent fields. Something had been there. Something they could see, but I couldn't.

I started staying up later, unable to find sleep. I‚Äôd just sit on the porch, my rifle across my lap, watching the sky. The stars out here are a sight to behold, clear and bright. I was watching Orion rise one night, the air getting that sharp autumn chill, when I saw them lights.

\-

They weren't planes. They weren't satellites. They were three points of impossibly bright light, like someone had punched holes in the night, arranged in a perfect, rigid triangle. I watched, barely breathing, as one light vanished and reappeared instantly a few miles away. There was no streak, no travel time. Just gone from here, and there in a blink. Then, as one, they began to move. They pulsed, a soft, sickly green glow, and shot across the sky at a speed that made my mind ache. They made a perfect, ninety-degree turn, a maneuver that should be impossible, then accelerated straight up and vanished from existence.

I sat there for a long time, the wood of the rifle stock feeling cold and useless in my hands. My mind was scrambling, trying to find a box to put this in. It had to be drones. Some new secret project from the Air Force base over in Del Rio. It had to be. But my gut, the part of me that knew the land and the sky, was telling me something different. It felt ancient, and it felt wrong.

I knew I hadn't been dreaming the next morning. I took the ATV out to check on the herd after the night's commotion. I was cresting the big hill that overlooks the wide south pasture when I saw it. I cut the engine, the sudden silence ringing in my ears. The entire pasture, a field of tall, dry grass, had a pattern carved into it. It was a massive circle, a hundred feet across, and inside it were other circles and lines, a piece of geometry so complex and perfect it looked like a blueprint laid out by God himself.

I walked to the edge of it, my boots sinking into the soft dirt. The air inside the circle felt still and strangely warm. There were no tracks, no sign of any vehicle or person. I looked at how the grass was laid down. Every single stalk was bent over, about an inch from the ground, not a single one broken. They were woven together in a tight, swirling spiral. It was‚Ä¶ neat. Too neat. I reached down and touched it. It was like a machine had carefully ironed a message onto the land, a message I couldn't read, written in a language I didn't know. And I had the terrible feeling that I was the only one meant to see it.



After I found that circle, the nights got harder. Every night was a watch. I wasn't just spooked anymore; I was huntin' for an answer. I'd sit on the porch, rifle across my lap, and just stare out into the dark, waitin'.

A few weeks went by. It was a hot, still night, the kind where the air's so thick you feel like you're breathing water. I must've nodded off, 'cause I woke up with a jolt. Not from a noise, but a feelin'. A low hum, like a big engine idling way off, but I could feel it right in the fillings of my teeth. The dogs were gone, hiding somewhere, completely silent.

I stood up and looked out to the south pasture. And my heart just about stopped.

Hanging in the air over that field was a patch of sky where the stars just weren't. A blacker-than-black triangle, quiet as a tombstone. No lights on it, no windows. Just a big, perfect, three-sided shape that was somehow takin' up space where God's stars ought to be.

As I stood there, a pale green light, dropped down from the bottom point of it. It lit up one of my cows, and the poor thing just went stiff. Then it started to lift. No noise, no struggle. Just floated right up off the ground, limp as a dishrag, and disappeared into the bottom of that black triangle.

The thing just sat there for another minute. Then, in the blink of an eye, it wasn't there anymore. The stars behind it popped back into view. The hum was gone. The heavy quiet rushed back in. I stood there for God knows how long, my rifle feelin' about as useful as a screen door on a submarine. I'd finally seen the butcher up close.

\-

The next morning, the sun came up and tried to lie to me, like everything was normal. I was out fixing a trough when I saw the dust cloud coming up my long driveway. A black government sedan, crawlin' through my pasture like a beetle in a clean sheet. Two men got out. They wore dark suits and city shoes that were already covered in dust.

""Mr. Jebediah Stone?"" the tall one said. His voice was flat as a panhandle highway.

""Reckon I am,"" I said, leaning on a fence post.

""We're with the Department of Energy,"" he lied. ""Had reports of some unusual atmospheric phenomena in this sector last night. See anything yourself?""

I looked him square in the eye. I thought about the black triangle and my stolen heifer. I knew right then, lookin' at these fellas, that they weren't here to help me find a lost cow. They were here to see what I knew. To keep me quiet.

""Can't say I did,"" I said, slow and easy. ""Was a quiet night. Nothin' but stars.""

The two men just stood there. The tall one gave me a smile that never touched his eyes. It was a look that said, *We know you're lyin', and you know we know.*

""Alright then, Mr. Stone,"" he said. ""Thank you for your time.""

They got back in their car and drove away. I watched their dust trail disappear, and a different kind of fear settled in my gut then. A cold one. It wasn't just strange critters from the sky I had to worry about now. It was my own kind, too. And I was standing right in the middle of it all.



After those men in the black suits drove off, life got quiet again. But it was a different kind of quiet. A heavy kind. I felt like I was being watched, even when the sun was high and bright. The big, crazy stuff stopped for a while. No more circles, no more‚Ä¶ visitors. But the wrongness of it all, that stayed. It sunk into the dirt like a bad rain.

The seasons turned. Weeks, months... it's been about three years now. And little things started happenin'. On a dead-still night, I'll hear a sound. Not a critter, not the wind. A high, thin *ping*. Like a hammer tappin' steel way off in the distance. Just once. Other times, I'll see little lights, like fireflies, zippin' along my fence line, faster than any drone. They seem to be checkin' the posts. Watchin' the property.

I go to church on Sundays, same as always. I hear the preacher talkin' 'bout temptation, 'bout the Devil walkin' the earth. I pray on it. I do. But what I saw don't feel like a demon from a storybook. Demons are meant to be loud and proud with their evil. This is quiet. And patient. And‚Ä¶ mechanical.

Then I think, maybe it's just the government. Some new spy plane or weapon they're testin' out in the brush country where no one will see. But that don't add up either. Why the dead cow? Why the games? Why not just do your business and go?

So I'm caught. I got what the Bible tells me on one side, and what my own two eyes have seen on the other. And neither one makes a lick of sense of this thing. The not-knowing is a splinter in my mind, and I can't get it out.

That's why I'm makin' this recording. I'm tired of carryin' it alone. I know I ain't crazy. I know what I saw. But I feel like the only man alive who's seen behind a curtain he wasn't supposed to know was there.

So I'm puttin' this out there, however a fella does that. If you've heard that silence, if you've seen lights that move wrong, if you've found things on your land that don't belong to God's green earth‚Ä¶ I'd surely like to hear about it.

I'm just an old rancher in West Texas. But I can't be the only one.

Am I?

Please‚Ä¶ tell me I'm not the only one.

1lplj13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1lplj13/27_and_still_living_with_parents/,27 and still living with parents.,"Yes it's true I'm living with my parents. Never went to college, got my GED, and have worked a handful of different jobs. I went through about 8 years of drinking pretty irresponsibly. Just a total binge drinking type of alcoholic - not everyday, but at most 3 times a week. Usually after a day or two I'd need to recover and it got to the point where I was having 3 day hangovers. I got a DUI when I was 19 and that fucked me up. I didn't care about getting my license back and truthfully I was concerned I'd drink and drive again and didn't trust myself - even though when sober I'd cuss people out who tried to drive drunk and threaten to call the cops on them. Drunk driving is not cool. I quit drinking when I was 25. 

Ever since I got sober things changed a lot for me... Slowly. I still don't care about getting my license back though; I cycle everywhere and I love it. I plan on doing lots of bicycle tours around the country. I still live with my parents and I help out with rent and overall I'm a clean ""roommate."" Our town is super expensive to live in and it just keeps getting worse. I live in the PNW and if you look up the housing crap here, it's bad. Personally I just don't even want to attempt living somewhere on my own here because I know it's gonna be short lived and I'm gonna be back living with my parents again. 
I have my shit together now, I'm a totally different person. I work, exercise a lot, have hobbies etc. I'm as sober as you can get, I don't touch anything - not even coffee. I feel pretty good about where I'm at in life tbh, but I feel that me living with my parents in a somewhat spacious motorhome really puts a damper on my dating life and truthfully I'm pretty insecure about it. If we had a normal house I wouldn't care as much. Also I guess not having a car is seen as a redflad to most, but I LOVE riding my bike and wouldn't trade it in for a car ever. 

Anyway, that's where I'm at in life. Just working, cycling, lifting, eating really good, playing guitar, staying clean and living with my parents. I feel very grateful for what I have and haven't felt this good since I was a teenager. 

I guess I'm making this post to get feedback on where I'm at, and if there's anything you think I should be doing to be a better person or to help myself out. Or you can share the fact that you're living with parents in your 20s and trying to survive as well.

1lpliru,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lpliru,"Today I'm going to talk about something important, and since the topic is about family, I wanted to show you something about Ami and Hayato that will interest you","The first two images are from Chapter 27: A Different Summer in a Different Timeline. The chapter title tells us its importance and also shows us Hayato's daughter, a spirited teenager like Ami in her arc at the beginning. What a coincidence! Furthermore, Hayato's daughter mentioned her summer project and talked about summer stories with her mother, among other things, which means something important happened that summer for their relationship, and Hayato's expression confirms it.

Now we take two important chapters about Ami's arc and what happens in the summer and they are 157: confession and 158: vows which I will explain and one detail before I forget I got confused on chapter 157 in my previous posts and it was 158 and there are 5 posts about Ami's family's acceptance and Ami's family's blessing and it is the most recent one

Chapter 157: Confession
In this chapter, as many already know, Ami's sister gets engaged to her partner, but this isn't relevant to the chapter itself, only to what happens next. This isn't Ami's doing, but Hayato's. At first, it was to invite her to dinner, but then Hayato talked about Ami's family and grandmother, about whether she would stay with Eri and her partner, and then this topic comes up.
And Ami, with an innocent smile, told Hayato that she would feel relieved if she stayed, and Hayato confirmed it with a yes. He also said that (I would be lonely without you here) in the Japanese context, which means ""my well-being depends on you,"" meaning ""I love you."" And after that, they talked about Ami going to summer training, and Hayato said he would endure it, which meant he would wait for her until she returned, which meant Ami wouldn't give up on the coffee. And then Ami, as always, proposed to him.

Chapter 158: Vows
As I mentioned before, I dedicated five posts to Hayato's acceptance into Ami's family and her blessing. Now I'll talk about image 5, as Ami wishes to be strong in the future, but like a mother. Now, with chapter 202, the theme returns with a very strong connection. The author also constantly leaves hints about it.

Now explaining this, everything fits together, but if you need more context you'll have it when I explain the whole Ami arc, but this is enough to confirm that Ami and Hayato's relationship happened in the summer and its importance to this couple, and it also confirms that Ami is the mother of Hayato's daughter, since everything explained happened in the summer, the author already had the bases for the following chapters.

It's been a year since I've been out on a date, and before that I hadn't dated anyone in roughly 7 years (I've been working on my career and doing some emotional healing from some very traumatic relationships).

This year, I felt confident and wanted to get back out there. Since I'm not into the club/bar scene and my friend group is small, I decided to go the dating app route. Instantly, I matched with various guys, but there was one in particular who stood out. 

After about a week and a half of easy back-n-forth conversation, he asked if I wanted to meet for coffee that week. I said yes, but that I wouldn't be available until the following weekend. He said he'd be out of town that day, but he said we could touch base when he got back in town.

Another week went by and he came back to town, but didn't message me. I realize this could've been his way of demonstrating he was no longer interested, but I also figured he may have gotten busy with work because that's happened to me before. So, I just sent a quick, no pressure message saying that if he was still interested in meeting when our schedules align I was up for it, too. I got zero response. 

Now, this wouldn't be a big deal if this was a guy I was ""iffy"" about, but this guy was pretty close to what I'm looking for in a partner. And the fact that he has ghosted me (but strangely hasn't unmatched with me) sort of hurts and is upsetting because it has me questioning my judgement with men because he seemed mature enough to at least say, ""No thanks"" or something. It's ridiculous, but this situation is also bringing up uncomfortable feelings of rejection, and triggering me to overthink and wonder if I did something wrong.

1lpld43,https://www.reddit.com/r/NeuroMage/comments/1lpld43/beginning_your_journey_foundations_first_steps/,Beginning Your Journey: Foundations & First Steps Towards Becoming a Neuromage,"This post outlines the essential foundational mindset shifts and daily practices that pave the way for true mental sovereignty, along with the very first active Neuromancy skill you should focus on.

# Phase 1: Cultivating Your Foundational Mindset

Before diving into advanced skills, it's crucial to adopt a particular understanding of reality and your place within it. These beliefs aren't just intellectual; they must become deeply integrated into your perception.

1. **Understanding Subjective Reality:** Embrace the profound truth that your perception is the lens through which you experience reality. The external world is filtered, interpreted, and, in many ways, *constructed* by your mind. Recognizing this gives you immense power over your experience.
2. **Cultivating Detachment:** Begin to practice observing the world, events, and even your own thoughts and emotions without becoming entangled or overly reactive. This detachment is not indifference, but a state of calm observation that allows you to act from intention rather than impulse.
3. **Embracing Presence:** The present moment is your point of power. Most people's minds wander between past regrets and future anxieties. Becoming truly aware and present in the ""now"" grounds your consciousness, making it a far more potent instrument.

# Phase 2: Daily Practices for Building Core Strength

These are the foundational disciplines that build the mental and energetic capacity required for Neuromancy. Consistency here is paramount.

* **Deep Stillness & Void Meditation (Minimum 2 Hours Daily):** Dedicate substantial time each day to cultivating profound mental stillness. This involves quieting the internal dialogue, letting go of distractions, and experiencing pure being. Whether you achieve a ""void"" state or simply a deep, quiet awareness (perhaps by staring at a blank wall), this practice significantly enhances mental endurance, focus, and clarity.
* **Purposeful Physical Exercise (to Exhaustion):** Engage in physical activity that genuinely exhausts you. This isn't just for physical health; it builds an incredible baseline for discipline and resilience. Pushing your physical limits teaches your mind to persevere, and a strong, well-regulated body provides a more stable foundation for advanced mental work.
* **Absolute Discipline:** These practices are not optional. Commit to them daily, without fail. This unwavering discipline is the muscle that will allow you to consistently apply Neuromancy principles and see tangible results over time. It's the bedrock of mental sovereignty.

Commit to these foundational practices for at least 30 to 90 days. You will notice profound shifts in your mental clarity, emotional stability, and overall energetic state.

**Phase 3: Your First Step into Active Neuromancy: The Law of Assumption**

Once your foundations feel solid, you are consistently present, detached, and aware that your perception shapes your reality, you can begin to actively apply a core Neuromancy skill: **The Law of Assumption.**

* **Why Start Here:** This practice offers immediate, verifiable feedback, building your personal evidence base that your mind can influence reality. Starting with ""small"" things helps cultivate belief and precision.
* **How to Practice:**
   1. **Choose a Small, Specific Outcome:** For example, seeing a car of a particular, unusual color (e.g., a purple car), or receiving a free coffee.
   2. **Embody the Fulfillment:** Close your eyes and intensely *feel* the sensation of this outcome already being real. Feel the surprise of seeing that car, the warmth of the free coffee cup in your hand. Engage all your senses in this imagined reality.
   3. **Release Your Intent:** Once you've fully felt the desired outcome, release the thought. Detach from the expectation and go about your day normally.
   4. **Observe and Acknowledge:** When the desired event occurs, acknowledge it. Don't dismiss it as coincidence. Recognize it as the direct result of your focused mental intent.

Practice manifesting these small, everyday occurrences consistently. Each success strengthens your conviction in your mind's power.

# Your Path Forward

Only once you have these foundations firmly established, a deep understanding of your subjective reality, consistent daily discipline, and demonstrable success with basic manifestation through the Law of Assumption, will you be truly prepared to delve into the more advanced realms of Neuromancy. This solid base will allow you to explore dream states, psychic abilities, sensory control, and other disciplines with far greater effectiveness and safety.

  


  
**Picking Your Next Skills:**

* **Follow Your Intuition:** What areas genuinely excite you? Do you feel a pull towards dream exploration, sensory mastery, or psychic abilities? Your natural interest often points to where your initial aptitude lies.
* **Address a Specific Need:** Is there a particular challenge in your life that a Neuromancy skill might address? (e.g., if you struggle with focus, explore cognitive enhancement aspects of Sensory & Body Mastery).
* **Complementary Growth:** Consider skills that naturally support each other. For example, enhancing sensory control can deepen your ability to experience inner realms or visualize manifestations.

  
**Understanding Skill Difficulty & Progression:** Neuromancy skills vary in their ease of initial access and the depth of mastery required.

* **Entry-Level (Often Easier to Perceive Progress):**
   * Basic **Sensory & Body Mastery** (e.g., simple temperature regulation, pain modulation for minor discomforts, basic control over internal sensations).
   * Initial **Dream & Inner Worlds** (e.g., achieving basic lucid dreaming awareness, starting to map simple inner spaces).
   * Basic **Subconscious & Mental Programming** (e.g., targeted subliminals for habits, simple self-hypnosis for relaxation or focus).

**Intermediate (Requires More Practice & Consistency):**

* Advanced **Sensory & Body Mastery** (e.g., consistent hallucination control, sustained perceptual bending, advanced body map recalibration).
* Deeper **Dream & Inner Worlds** (e.g., establishing persistent realms, deliberate dreamwalking, interacting with complex thoughtforms).
* More complex **Subconscious & Mental Programming** (e.g., deep belief system rewriting, rapid habit deconstruction/reconstruction).
* Beginning **Energetic & Intuitive Practices** (e.g., basic Qi/Ki cultivation, developing more refined intuitive insights).

  
**Advanced (Long-Term Mastery & Often More Subtle or Challenging):**

* **Psychic Abilities** (e.g., consistent telekinesis, clear telepathy, reliable remote viewing). These often require profound mental focus and energy cultivation.
* Deep **Altered States & Consciousness** (e.g., navigating complex altered states at will, achieving profound states of non-duality).
* Highly refined **Conscious Reality & Manifestation** for complex, external situations beyond personal influence.
* Mastery over **Energetic & Intuitive Practices** (e.g., advanced channeling, comprehensive chakra mastery).

  
**Collecting Skills: The Synergy of Sovereignty:** Think of your skills as a collection of tools. While you might specialize, developing a range of abilities creates synergy. Enhanced mental clarity from meditation boosts all other skills. Improved sensory control makes visualization more potent. Understanding subconscious programming accelerates all forms of manifestation. The ultimate Neuromage is not just a specialist, but a master of the entire mental spectrum.

**Where to Learn & Grow:**

* **This Community:** The r/Neuromancy subreddit is a primary hub for shared experiences, insights, and questions. Utilize the specific flairs to find discussions relevant to your chosen skill.
* **Dedicated Guides & Resources:** Many topics have established methodologies. Look for ""Resources & Learning"" posts, and don't hesitate to ask for recommendations in ""Questions & Seeking Guidance"" posts.
* **Personal Experimentation:** Ultimately, your greatest teacher is your own disciplined practice. Keep a log, analyze your results, and iterate on your methods. Share your ""Technique & Experiment Log"" to contribute to our collective understanding.

Your journey into Neuromancy is deeply personal but supported by a community of dedicated practitioners. Embrace the challenge, commit to the work, and prepare to discover the true power of your mind.",1,1751426014.0,NeuroMage,0,1.0,False
1lplcyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lplcyl/something_is_hunting_my_cattle_and_its_not_human/,Something is Hunting My Cattle and It's Not Human,"My name is Jebediah. I'm makin' this recording because... well, because I don't know what else to do. I'm hopin' maybe someone out there, somewhere, has seen what I've seen. And can maybe tell me I'm not goin' crazy.

I‚Äôve lived on this ranch my whole life, just like my daddy and his daddy before him. We‚Äôve ranched this land since Texas was still a republic. My granddaddy taught me how to read the clouds, how to know the land so well you could feel it talkin' to you through the soles of your boots. It‚Äôs a language of its own‚Äîthe rustle of mesquite, the lowing of cattle, the sounds of the night. Or at least, it used to be.

That's where this all started. Not with the lights, not with the... things I found in my fields. It started with silence. About three years ago, the coyotes just... stopped singing. One night they were yippin' and carryin' on like always, a rowdy choir spread across the plains. The next... nothing. The whole prairie went dead quiet.¬†

For a few nights, I'd sit out on the porch after sundown, my coffee gettin' cold in my hand, just listenin'. The silence was so heavy it felt like a physical weight. My two heelers, who'd normally be sniffin' around the yard, would just lie by the door, whimpering low in their chests, their ears flat against their heads. They knew somethin' was wrong, too. The crickets were gone. The birds didn't sing their morning song the next day. It was just dead air. Like the whole world was holdin' its breath, waitin' for somethin' awful to happen.

¬†\-

At first, I chalked it up to the way of things. Nature is mysterious. But what I found a week after the silence started... well, that‚Äôs the real reason I'm makin' this recording.

It was a Tuesday. I was out in the truck, checkin' the fence line out by the north stock tank. It‚Äôs rugged country out there, all gullies and rock. I saw a dark shape down by the water, figured a heifer was just lyin' down in the shade. But she didn't move as my truck rumbled closer. My stomach tightened a bit. I got out, my rifle in hand just out of habit, and walked over.

It was one of my best Charolais heifers. And she was dead. My first thought was just a weary sigh, another loss to tally. But as I got closer, I saw it. The scene was... wrong. I circled her, lookin' for tracks. Cougar, wolf, bear... anything leaves tracks. There was nothing. Just my own bootprints in the dry dust.

Then I saw the body itself. There was no blood. None. The ground around her was clean as a preacher's collar, not a drop spilled. But her tongue had been cut out, right at the root. Her udder, too. Both gone. My stomach turned. I've seen what predators do. It's a messy, violent business of tooth and claw. This was‚Ä¶ clean. The cuts weren't torn or chewed. They were perfect circles, like they'd been made with a white-hot drill. I reached down and touched the edge of one. The flesh was black, smooth, and hard, like sealed plastic. It was cauterized.

I knelt there, the unnatural quiet of the field pressing in on me, my hand resting on the stock of my rifle, though I had a sick feelin' it wouldn't be any use against this. I've seen snakebites, anthrax, cattle rustlers, and droughts. I'm a God-fearing man. I was raised on the Good Book. I believe there's a Heaven above and a Hell below, and I believe the Lord has a plan for all his creatures. But I've read my Bible cover to cover, and there ain't a single verse in there that prepares you for somethin' that doesn't bleed.



The days after I found that first heifer were thick with a quiet dread. I did what any rancher would do: I called the sheriff. Old Bill drove his dusty cruiser out, took one look at the carcass, and scratched the back of his neck. He‚Äôd seen a lot in his forty years of law enforcement, but he'd never seen anything like that. He talked about maybe some new kind of cult, took some notes in his little pad, and told me to keep my eyes open. I knew then that I was on my own. No lawman had a manual for dealing with something that left no tracks and used a scalpel made of heat.

The silence on the ranch deepened, and the animals felt it most. It wasn't just my dogs cowering on the porch anymore. The whole herd was spooked. They started staying in a tight, defensive bunch, their heads always up, always watching. They wouldn't go near the north pasture, not even for the good grass. One night, a noise like thunder woke me from a shallow sleep. The whole herd was stampeding, a wave of panic in the dark. I grabbed my rifle and jumped in the truck, my heart pounding, expecting to find rustlers or a whole pack of wolves. But when I got there, there was nothing. Just the cattle, wild-eyed and trembling, bunched up against the farthest fence line, staring back at the empty, silent fields. Something had been there. Something they could see, but I couldn't.

I started staying up later, unable to find sleep. I‚Äôd just sit on the porch, my rifle across my lap, watching the sky. The stars out here are a sight to behold, clear and bright. I was watching Orion rise one night, the air getting that sharp autumn chill, when I saw them lights.

\-

They weren't planes. They weren't satellites. They were three points of impossibly bright light, like someone had punched holes in the night, arranged in a perfect, rigid triangle. I watched, barely breathing, as one light vanished and reappeared instantly a few miles away. There was no streak, no travel time. Just gone from here, and there in a blink. Then, as one, they began to move. They pulsed, a soft, sickly green glow, and shot across the sky at a speed that made my mind ache. They made a perfect, ninety-degree turn, a maneuver that should be impossible, then accelerated straight up and vanished from existence.

I sat there for a long time, the wood of the rifle stock feeling cold and useless in my hands. My mind was scrambling, trying to find a box to put this in. It had to be drones. Some new secret project from the Air Force base over in Del Rio. It had to be. But my gut, the part of me that knew the land and the sky, was telling me something different. It felt ancient, and it felt wrong.

I knew I hadn't been dreaming the next morning. I took the ATV out to check on the herd after the night's commotion. I was cresting the big hill that overlooks the wide south pasture when I saw it. I cut the engine, the sudden silence ringing in my ears. The entire pasture, a field of tall, dry grass, had a pattern carved into it. It was a massive circle, a hundred feet across, and inside it were other circles and lines, a piece of geometry so complex and perfect it looked like a blueprint laid out by God himself.

I walked to the edge of it, my boots sinking into the soft dirt. The air inside the circle felt still and strangely warm. There were no tracks, no sign of any vehicle or person. I looked at how the grass was laid down. Every single stalk was bent over, about an inch from the ground, not a single one broken. They were woven together in a tight, swirling spiral. It was‚Ä¶ neat. Too neat. I reached down and touched it. It was like a machine had carefully ironed a message onto the land, a message I couldn't read, written in a language I didn't know. And I had the terrible feeling that I was the only one meant to see it.



After I found that circle, the nights got harder. Every night was a watch. I wasn't just spooked anymore; I was huntin' for an answer. I'd sit on the porch, rifle across my lap, and just stare out into the dark, waitin'.

A few weeks went by. It was a hot, still night, the kind where the air's so thick you feel like you're breathing water. I must've nodded off, 'cause I woke up with a jolt. Not from a noise, but a feelin'. A low hum, like a big engine idling way off, but I could feel it right in the fillings of my teeth. The dogs were gone, hiding somewhere, completely silent.

I stood up and looked out to the south pasture. And my heart just about stopped.

Hanging in the air over that field was a patch of sky where the stars just weren't. A blacker-than-black triangle, quiet as a tombstone. No lights on it, no windows. Just a big, perfect, three-sided shape that was somehow takin' up space where God's stars ought to be.

As I stood there, a pale green light, dropped down from the bottom point of it. It lit up one of my cows, and the poor thing just went stiff. Then it started to lift. No noise, no struggle. Just floated right up off the ground, limp as a dishrag, and disappeared into the bottom of that black triangle.

The thing just sat there for another minute. Then, in the blink of an eye, it wasn't there anymore. The stars behind it popped back into view. The hum was gone. The heavy quiet rushed back in. I stood there for God knows how long, my rifle feelin' about as useful as a screen door on a submarine. I'd finally seen the butcher up close.

\-

The next morning, the sun came up and tried to lie to me, like everything was normal. I was out fixing a trough when I saw the dust cloud coming up my long driveway. A black government sedan, crawlin' through my pasture like a beetle in a clean sheet. Two men got out. They wore dark suits and city shoes that were already covered in dust.

""Are you the property owner?"" the tall one asked. His voice was flat as a panhandle highway.

""Reckon I am,"" I said, leaning on a fence post.

""We're with the Department of Energy,"" he lied. ""Had reports of some unusual atmospheric phenomena in this sector last night. See anything yourself?""

I looked him square in the eye. I thought about the black triangle and my stolen heifer. I knew right then, lookin' at these fellas, that they weren't here to help me find a lost cow. They were here to see what I knew. To keep me quiet.

""Can't say I did,"" I said, slow and easy. ""Was a quiet night. Nothin' but stars.""

The two men just stood there. The tall one gave me a smile that never touched his eyes. It was a look that said, *We know you're lyin', and you know we know.*

""Alright then, Sir,"" he said. ""Thank you for your time.""

They got back in their car and drove away. I watched their dust trail disappear, and a different kind of fear settled in my gut then. A cold one. It wasn't just strange critters from the sky I had to worry about now. It was my own kind, too. And I was standing right in the middle of it all.



After those men in the black suits drove off, life got quiet again. But it was a different kind of quiet. A heavy kind. I felt like I was being watched, even when the sun was high and bright. The big, crazy stuff stopped for a while. No more circles, no more‚Ä¶ visitors. But the wrongness of it all, that stayed. It sunk into the dirt like a bad rain.

The seasons turned. Weeks, months... it's been about three years now. And little things started happenin'. On a dead-still night, I'll hear a sound. Not a critter, not the wind. A high, thin *ping*. Like a hammer tappin' steel way off in the distance. Just once. Other times, I'll see little lights, like fireflies, zippin' along my fence line, faster than any drone. They seem to be checkin' the posts. Watchin' the property.

I go to church on Sundays, same as always. I hear the preacher talkin' 'bout temptation, 'bout the Devil walkin' the earth. I pray on it. I do. But what I saw don't feel like a demon from a storybook. Demons are meant to be loud and proud with their evil. This is quiet. And patient. And‚Ä¶ mechanical.

Then I think, maybe it's just the government. Some new spy plane or weapon they're testin' out in the brush country where no one will see. But that don't add up either. Why the dead cow? Why the games? Why not just do your business and go?

So I'm caught. I got what the Bible tells me on one side, and what my own two eyes have seen on the other. And neither one makes a lick of sense of this thing. The not-knowing is a splinter in my mind, and I can't get it out.

That's why I'm makin' this recording. I'm tired of carryin' it alone. I know I ain't crazy. I know what I saw. But I feel like the only man alive who's seen behind a curtain he wasn't supposed to know was there.

So I'm puttin' this out there, however a fella does that. If you've heard that silence, if you've seen lights that move wrong, if you've found things on your land that don't belong to God's green earth‚Ä¶ I'd surely like to hear about it.

I'm just an old rancher in West Texas. But I can't be the only one.

Am I?

Please‚Ä¶ tell me I'm not the only one.

If you have had success after 30-45 days please share your stories!

**Please do not comment with any advice to discourage me, it‚Äôs only a month so I don‚Äôt think this will be damaging. I know it is not sustainable long-term.**

*(BACKSTORY)*

I felt healthiest around 150-160lbs, which is where I was from age 19-23. I went through a lot of lifestyle changes at age 22-23 (moved countries, full time job, doing university classes), but I only noticed myself gaining weight around Oct 2023 after a doctor‚Äôs visit weigh in. I was at that point 180lbs. For some reason, I decided to avoid the issue entirely. I did not want to face the fact that I was getting so heavy again. By Aug 2024 I was 200lbs. I had not weighed this much since I was 16/17 years old. I still continued to avoid the issue. I struggled a LOT with body image issues and self esteem as a teenager, so I think I was probably avoiding it as a coping mechanism.

I really need to make a change. This is so hard for me to accept and follow through with. I will be 25 this August, and I don‚Äôt want to start this phase of life weighing over 200lbs. Especially since everyone always says after 25 it becomes a lot harder to lose weight.

*(5 WEEK KETO CHALLENGE)*

I am starting over this challenge July 1st. First attempt was May 27th, but due to various factors (lack of preparation on busy work days, my boyfriend's birthday, and trying to develop a healthy social life again) I fell off on week 3. I managed to get to 191.8 within the first 16 days, which was good progress to me. I believe if I prepare and stick to a plan, I can achieve good results. It‚Äôs 100% a mental challenge.

My intention is to use this as the starting point, and then follow a more sustainable eating plan at the beginning of August. I‚Äôm going to keep it very simple:

**Lunch**: 300-350g beef with broccoli OR 4 eggs with 4 slices of bacon

**Dinner**: 300-350g chicken OR beef with broccoli

**In between**: Diet sodas and black coffee

**Exercise**: Week 1 won‚Äôt be too active, but I am going to try to hit 10K steps most days, and eventually incorporate weightlifting and moderate/high intensity cardio.

I‚Äôm posting this now to keep myself accountable, but I will come back with updates!

1lplbhw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lplbhw,Himalayan Leather: A Detailed Comparison between Imported and Domestic Varieties,"Today, we will conduct an in-depth comparison between Singaporean imported Himalayan leather and domestic Himalayan leather through pictures, exploring not only the differences between them but also the differences in price. Let's start with the dyeing differences. Imported Himalayan leather has the following characteristics: First, the pores are extremely obvious, the color transition of the coffee part is natural, and the texture is three-dimensional. Due to the high price of imported leather, the selected leather embryos are of excellent quality, so the water dyeing process can be used, and the effect is natural and realistic, with the middle white part being milky white.

In contrast, domestic Himalayan leather mostly uses inferior leather embryos that are leftover after being screened abroad and can only adopt the spraying process. As a result, the middle white part will have a slight bluish tint, and the pores in the coffee part are not so obvious. In addition, there is a difference in hand feel between the two. Domestic leather feels sandy to the touch, the leather quality is relatively loose, and it is extremely prone to wrinkling; while imported leather is relatively firm.

For Herm√®s, Himalayan leather represents the top quality. Therefore, if you want to make related products, I strongly recommend using high-quality imported leather.",4,1751425871.0,RepladiesDesigner,1,1.0,False

Am I just over reacting?,"- Ive been seen my an allergist - I‚Äôm not seeking medical advice - 

I‚Äôve been to the ER several times this past month and saw an ENT, Endocrinologist and my primary physician before being referred to an allergist. I get severe throat and neck swelling when I eat gluten as of a little over a month ago. This allergy  is completely random so they thought it was my thyroid for 3 weeks until I discovered it swells when I eat gluten. 

Long story short, the swelling gets so bad that it‚Äôs hard to swallow and breathe, and feels like I‚Äôm being strangled! And the worst part is - gluten is in SO MANY THING that you would never even think of. My freaking SHAMPOO?? COFFEE SYRUP??? GLUTEN FREE FLOUR? 

So I have been getting exposed every day. And it gets worse and worse, and I am not supposed to take anti-histamines until my testing, but they didn‚Äôt give me an epi pen so I feel like I‚Äôm just a ticking time bomb! I called and asked them for one today and they said she ‚Äúmight‚Äù send one to the pharmacy üòÄ 

This new allergy is just terrible. I get body aches, throat and neck swelling, neck itching sometimes with a rash, and a sore throat after the swelling goes down a bit. 

I have prednisone for the swelling but it doesn‚Äôt really help until hours later, so I have to just suffer with the swelling and strangled feeling. 

I went to the ER and the ENT told me that I was overreacting and was just having a normal allergic reaction while I sounded like I smoke 4 packs of cigarettes a day from the swelling. C‚Äômon! They did nothing for me but prescribe me Benadryl and prednisone. But I‚Äôm not allowed to take the Benadryl. Ugh! 

I‚Äôm a nanny so I am terrified that I‚Äôm going to be exposed at work and go into anaphylactic shock and then the baby is just going to be alone and I‚Äôll be d*ad .

Do they only give you epi pens if you test positive? My test isn‚Äôt for another week. 

I guess this is more of a rant than any questions. 
I‚Äôm so scared of eating and drinking and showering and washing my hands and using ANYTHING.

*Jacques carter greeted me warmly at his bakery, offering a firm handshake dusted with flour. He apologized for the slight delay, mentioning that the bakery had been understaffed over the break due to VA week. He and a few others with no one else to spend their break with simply stayed at the bakery and had been diligently preparing the dough. Since the official end of the conflict and the reformation of the EU, business in the French capital had been flourishing once more. A veteran of the war, he caught my attention at a general assembly meeting of veterans of the conflict. As he shouts to his brother to take over the preparation of the dough he invites me to sit outside, pouring me a glass of coffee and offering me a cigarette before addressing me with some surprise laced in his voice.*

""I‚Äôm surprised you came to me first of all people. Someone in your line of work, I'd expect them to interview the generals or the heads of states,"" he proclaims as he lights his cigarette and takes a smoke. Several seconds later he puffs out smoke from his mouth as it forms a small smokey ring in the air which I avoid.

""Well you are one of the few who survived the war from start to end and the only one of those people I could currently find so I came to you. You clearly must have some story to tell"" I answer curiously.

The Frenchman shrugs as he takes a long drag and stares at the sky. The sight of a bird flying gracefully sky catches his attention.

‚ÄúHonestly, if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for you should ask the birds.‚Äù He says with a smile on his face.

‚ÄúThe birds?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, those guys got out of dodge even before the ministers and the journalists.‚Äù

‚ÄúCould you explain further?‚Äù

""Listen, it's not just the fact that I lost half my hearing and knee joints in that damn war. It's like it caused a short circuit in my brain. But one thing I know for sure is that those darn birds saw it coming,"" he remarked, exhaling the last drag of his cigarette. He then continues on somewhat exasperated.

‚ÄúOne day they were there. Then, about half a day before those squid things landed followed by the crabs and reptilians. They got out of dodge before anyone realized what was about to happen. For a whole day the sky was filled with flocks of them moving north, east, west, south, up and down. We knew something was up from that point on.‚Äù

‚ÄúTensions around the world were high?‚Äù

‚ÄúHigh? You‚Äôd drop a stack of boxes on the ground a bit too loudly and half the base would be jumping behind anything that seemed solid enough to take cover behind thinking we were getting bombed! Then, there's this guy who decides to light a candle in our chapel, and next thing you know, a part of it catches fire after he left! Before we could even dial up the firefighters, My staff sergeant yelled at me to grab my machine gun, lie down in the hallway, and be ready to fend off the Russians. Picture me, in my sport shorts and football jersey, all geared up with my plate carrier and helmet, tucked away in a dark corner, convinced Spetsnaz were about to storm the hallway in any minute.‚Äù He exclaims before continuing on.

""Russia had invaded Ukraine just a year earlier and then when little old Putin realized he couldn't square up the Ukrainians he began eying up the Baltics. A move that would have been stupid had he not signed a formal alliance with the Chinese and had guaranteed support from them. It seemed at any moment ww3 could break out. The issue was both Nato and the Russo-Chinese pact didn't exactly want to be the ones to throw the first punch.""

""That was in 2023 correct?"" The man then turns his head to my question some what annoyed I had cut him off before sighing and continuing his tangent.

""Yes, but little did we know, the storm hadn't even hit us yet. I remember that evening like it was yesterday. I was holed up in my room, binge-watching The Sopranos on my cursed laptop.  Suddenly, one of my comrades calls me out to the hallway. Late-night briefings were nothing new to us; our platoon commander often briefed us after his meetings with the higher-ups. Our lieutenant, fresh out of the academy at 24, had a name none of us could pronounce.

¬†

As I stepped into the hallway with my notebook and trusty foldable camping chair, I saw it written all over his face. Fear. He was trembling like a leaf. He ordered us to gear up for 72 hours straight. One guy was told to sprint to the ammunition depot and save us a spot in line before the other platoons swarmed in. Everyone was to grab their gear, drivers to bring the vehicles to the parade square, and the rest of us to rush to the armory and ammo depot."" He then pauses for dramatic affect and continues but not before letting out another cigarette puff.

¬†

""In those few seconds of silence, we all exchanged the same incredulous looks. 'Is this for real?' was written on every face."" He then lets out a cough before speaking again as I write down the information on my note pad.

""We were like deer looking at headlights. And then, that kid with two stars on his chest and five years of military academy experience let out his first genuine panicked yell in his entire career. In a flurry, we darted to our rooms, snatching up our gear, stuffing our backpacks with everything we might need. Amidst the rush, I stole a moment to shoot off a quick text message to my girlfriend at the time."" Jacques turns around to stare at his wife in the shop who‚Äôs overlooking the books.

‚ÄúSome crazy bastard once told me that the moment I knew I‚Äôd be getting into combat; that I should understand that I was already dead. That way I‚Äôd be less scared once the moment comes. Trust me, even with that I sat on one ass cheek the entire way to our TAA. My wife never forgave me for that message I sent her.‚Äù

‚ÄúTAA?‚Äù I asked.

""Tactical assembly area, where we gather before the action kicks off. The vehicle I rode in, a CV9035, had been prepped daily for potential encounters with the Russians. We had bought them a year ago from the Swedes. Despite the exhaustive technical checks and training drills, it was still a chaotic mess. The transition to the TAA resembled a Congolese farmer's market more than a meticulously planned military operation by the most formidable alliance in history. Vehicles left with tanks half-empty, ammo boxes vanished into thin air, and we discovered our infantry fighting vehicle had only half the water we needed because someone used our war stock to cook noodles during training. Then there was the German tank that accidentally flattened a parked military police car in route to the TAA. The craziest part? The commander didn't even bat an eye once he realized nobody was hurt; he just pressed on to join the rest of his platoon. Can't blame the driver, though‚Äîwe were all pretty distracted.""

‚ÄúBecause of the meteors?‚Äù I then saw asking the big question. The man nods and waves his hands in the air for an emphasis as he speaks.

""You should've been there to witness it firsthand. The footage doesn't do it justice. It all kicked off as we were scrambling onto our vehicles. Everyone hit the deck, seeking cover. It took a few minutes for us to realize we weren't in immediate danger and emerge from our tanks, basements, drainage pipes. Picture this: central Latvia, practically right under the impacts. Every few seconds, our tank would shudder from the sheer force of the explosions. The noise was deafening. No wonder the few survivors in the area ended up with tinnitus.

¬†Meteors, each weighing hundreds of tons, detonating kilometres above us, shattering as they broke the sound barrier. That's what I call shock and awe. Our first air casualties weren't from our or the Russian air defense firing blindly in the chaos; they were helicopters, fighter jets even two air liners unfortunate enough to be directly under those meteors transporting crabs. A buddy of mine witnessed an NH90 torn apart by the shockwave alone. Even the helicopters and jets that made it back to their airbases had to be grounded due to structural damage it inflicted.

As we left our base I had to see it, so there I was like a kid looking at the night sky. It was dark, but the meteors entering the atmosphere was like a second sun lighting up the surroundings. They exploded and became hundred of different smaller pieces each carrying god knows how many squids in them. In fact some of them I heard had the crabs in them though I don't exactly buy it as from what I heard the crabs came in the 10th wave though who knows what the alien attack plan was. Maybe they were crabs in the opening waves for all I know.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you and your platoon have any idea what was going on at the time?‚Äù I question.

""Not in the slightest, it was chaos. Radios blaring, everyone trying to make sense of the madness. Our lieutenant had to hotmic the radio at one point to restore some order. Initially, we thought it might be MIRV‚Äôs, Multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles. Nukes that separated into multiple different ballistics ogives that each could target a different city. Seemed like the closest match. But the meteors were not even 1/10 of the speed of those. And if they had really been nukes none of us would be here to tell the story, so we scrapped that theory.

¬†

When we finally reached the TAA, my vehicle commander, a sergeant in his early thirties, stone-faced as ever. You couldn't crack a smile out of him if your life depended on it. Ask him anything personal, and you'd get the driest response before he walked off. Guy smoked like a chimney and could outdrink anyone. He hailed from West Flanders, a real 'boer' as we called them‚Äîonly farmers lived there. Anyhow, he ditched his crew helmet, ordered us to hold tight, and bolted towards our platoon commander's tank. From where we stood, there was just one friendly Estonian battalion between us and the Russian border. Not that it mattered, since we were clueless about those falling squids all around us and landing from Kaliningrad to St Petersburg. 510 million square kilometers on earth and they somehow landed in the most heavily militarized region. And that was just in the first wave in the second wave they began to hit the United states and Mexico and then in the 3rd just a couple days later they landed in western Europe.""

As Jacques took a long drag from his cigarette, his eyes lingered on the scene unfolding in the park before us. His gaze followed the carefree movements of a child chasing a small dog across the lush green grass. The innocence of the moment and the gravity of his memories seemed to weigh heavily on him. In that simple interaction between the child and the dog, there was a fleeting glimpse of normalcy. It was as if, for a brief moment, he found solace in the simplicity of the scene. I gently wait for him to speak giving him the time he needs to compose himself before he once again speaks, this time more heavily.

‚ÄúUNKOWN CONTACT, 3 O‚ÄôCLOCK, 400 METERS.‚Äù ‚ÄúI heard one of the men just several meters away yelled. That scared shit out me, our sergeant had quickly switched his monitor on and looked at what the man several feet away was seeing. After what seemed like an eternity of switching camera modes he grabbed the handheld radio and radioed it in to our lieutenant. As he was trying to describe what he saw the meteors lit up the figures for a second or two. They had stopped moving and seemed to be watching us. He had to coordinate things with the lieutenant on the radio, the dismounted troops outside and with us inside.""

He then paused as he world seemed to slow, offering a momentary reprieve from the chaos of his thoughts. He once again continues

""You know, I still can't figure out who fired the first shot. It definitely wasn't us, and the dismounts on our left weren't the culprits either. I'm pretty sure it was that 1-5 vehicle on our right that kicked things off. Anyway, they let loose a burst, targeting one of them. Then BAM! The third high-explosive shell hit, and its whole body just cracked open like butter. The ones before barely made a dent, but that last one? It was a game-changer. I still get chills thinking about it. Even munching on shrimp brings back that memory like it was yesterday. Afterwards, the whole field lit up. Picture this: a hundred of those guys, armed with their makeshift blasters, around 4 or 5 per tentacle, all aiming in our direction. It was like a scene straight out of a space western. They were also massive. Like if you seen photos you know what I'm taking about. 5 meters tall at max and 2 meters at their shortest.

They weren't exactly the most precise bunch but they made up for it in coordination and overwhelming fire power because they could wield multiple of those things due to their tenacles. Half of them let loose their shots all at once, while the others waited for the first half to reload before firing. Even to this day me and my colleagues who survived think those were the first to land, their shock troops of sort. Precision wasn't their strong suit, but trust me, you didn't want to catch one of those 'geo thermal' blasts. It was like getting hit by a supernova in miniature form. The heat seared through tissue, wood and dirt like butter, leaving nothing but scorched earth in its wake. You could practically feel the ground tremble with each blast. A few shots hit our vehicle. Thanks to the armor we survived. They couldn‚Äôt take us out with those blasters as long as we where in the vehicle. Still it made me shit myself. I didn‚Äôt even know who I was fighting but I started blasting. But the dismounts outside were less fortunate. Some fitness freak right in front of our vehicle. She caught one in the thorax and she was split in two. And that was just a ricochet. The driver described to me how her upper half was jolted into the air.

I picked a target, fired a burst of HE shells. They were tough. Shrapnel from the HE shells didn‚Äôt kill them outright. I realized quickly I had to get a direct shot. As I blasted that cannon, I saw those sneaky crabs pop out of the field ahead, wielding their weird weapons. So, I adjusted my aim real quick, targeting the closest critter. When I let loose that first shot, it tore through the air, smashing those squids like they were made of glass."" He once again pauses as he gets a bearing on this thoughts.

""If you want to stop-""

""Its ok don't worry I'm fine"" He mutters before speaking again.

""When we envisioned aliens arriving on our planets we imagined them coming with shiny silver space ships. Those guys seemed like they used recycled materials for everything. It‚Äôs why allot of people believe this confederation of Aliens if you want to call it that, came from a distant collapsing planet, or that they had lost their home world to war and now were trying to settle here. Before I could even think on how I was going to take it down one of them they brought in their armor. It was this massive Tripod looking thing not to dissimilar to that from war of the worlds. The difference was it was made out of pure flesh. Its sides had these mouths snapping about and long tongues that dripped down and tried to grab at any infantry outside of their vehicles. The central and largest of the mouths had the ability to fire some kind of explosive projectile. There was a scream on the radio, someone inside was describing the flesh Tripod before screaming as the heat blast boiled them inside before the ammunition cooked of and sent the turret flying ten meters in the air. I blasted it with all I got. HE, APHE, APFSD. The HE seemed to shake it. But the armor piercing rounds did the trick. Despite it being made of flesh it was thick skinned if one wanted to saw. It was 15 meters tall and a terrifying site to behold.

When I say those thing were resilient I mean it. They traveled god knows how many galaxies or solar systems on meteors and somehow survived the landing and they came in waves. I was blasting it as I saw its mouth heat up. My sergeant, god bless him popped the smokes. We had smoke cannisters on our vehicle pointed at every angle. He saw it heat up and order our driver to drive forward five meters as the phosphorous smoke cannisters flew and exploded in the air. As we pushed through the smoke¬†I started unloading again. As I saw the cannon heat up, some brave bastard fired a rocket at it. I believe it was a Spike. A tv guided anti tank rocket that can pierce pretty much anything human made. It tried to stand tall for a few seconds again before falling in the mud. After that we high tailed it deeper into Estonia. We were one of the lucky ones. Entire battalions got encircled by accident that day or simply ran headlong into them while on patrol or maneuvers that night and in the morning.

Throughout the rest of the night and morning of the next day we bore witness to the carnage we managed to avoid just narrowly if you want to call it that. Their were no ""Front lines"" at this point and squid and our guys were simply running into each other. It was a strange game of cat and mouse were both the cat and the mouse accidently moved around without knowing what was going on until they came face to face with each other. As we drove along the quiet road, the only sounds were the hum of our engines and the gunfire and explosion in the distance. We drove by four destroyed M109 artillery vehicles and half a dozen utility trucks. All blown to bits and still burning. Some with its crew still smoldering in and outside of the vehicles. It‚Äôs hard to understate how critical the position the crabs landed in was.

In modern, peer to peer conflict. Your enemy doesn‚Äôt magically appear behind, above, left and right of you. You don‚Äôt have enemies parachuting in your back yard all of a sudden, that shit only happens in Hollywood movies. Had they landed on the Russian side, we might have had a fighting chance that week. I was on the turret, peeking out with that sergeant I told you about on the side. At first I thought it was a firefly because of the way it flew in the air. It peacefully glided in the air from ground with a weird flight path. That why I thought it was an insect at first. Until I realized it was at a distance and was coming straight for us. I barely had time to yell ‚ÄúGet inside!‚Äù that it exploded in the air into multiple fragments. It hit our convoy. My right hand was still holding the hatch handle and was exposed outside. The burn I still feel from time to time. I am lucky to still have control of the arm. I am even more lucky I managed to get the hatch closed. Second degree burns, I wept and felt like I was about to pass out from the pain. All while we fought our way out of that ambush. Thank god that ordnance didn‚Äôt take out our engine. I wept all the way to the border. Took me a few weeks to get my hand in order.""

He smiles as he finishes his cigarette and smiles.

I (27M) have had a rough week. I'm going to break this down day by day because I'm struggling and don't know what else to do at this point.

Thursday night- I played a few songs at open mic night, hopped on stage later with a few musicians and did some improvised stuff. Came home and watched a movie.

Friday- went great up until about 6pm. I was getting ready for game night at my friend's house. I was trying to straighten out my glasses and broke them by accident. I start driving to my friends house and I'm laughing about everything, past the point of anger and tears. My relaxed, loopy state continues at game night. It was all going fine until I had 4 beers and excused myself to go get some air. I went onto my friends porch and started sobbing. Friend comes out and we spend roughly 2hrs talking. It helped but something felt really off when I got home.

Saturday- shitshow at work, got yelled at for something that wasn't my fault. I went into Walmart optical after work because the website said they had walk in vision exams but was informed once I arrived that there were no openings for 2 weeks. 

I politely wish them a nice day and leave the store. As I'm driving home, the rage takes over. On the outside, I'm driving safely and normal but inside the car I'm screaming about how sick I am of living, how fucked up the world is, how I want to kms, etc. 

I get home and start using my arm as a cutting board, actively trying to unalive myself. It was at this point that I should have gone to the hospital but I don't have health insurance so that was out of the question. My dad called me and he wasn't very helpful so I said some shitty stuff and blocked him. I called into work for the next day. Later in the night, when I told friend from later what was happening, he came over and sat with me until 2am. Went to sleep feeling stable.

Sunday- I woke up around 10am, felt like dogshit so I went back to sleep. Woke up again around noon and went downtown. I got a coffee and walked 11 blocks straight both ways just absolutely miserable, feeling nothing and everything at the same time. Drove home and worked on some music, took a nap until 6pm. Woke up at 6, had a productive convo with dad, went to the store and then went to bed. Had another self harm episode because I couldn't sleep.

Monday- went back to work and felt terrible for the first few hours but slowly got better. Came home and slept until 7pm.

Today- went to work had a great day but once I got home the depression came back. I slept until 7pm, just got back from the store but on my way home from the store, some jackass in an oversized SUV honked at me for yielding to oncoming traffic. I keep driving, screaming at myself again, hitting myself. Home now, have to be up at 5:30 for work but since I slept until 7 I'm not going to sleep until midnight at the latest.

I need advice, support, personal anecdotes, whatever you've got that might help.",4,1751424642.0,BPD,3,1.0,False

6/17/25: **I‚Äôm feeling off today. I think it might be from not spending that much time with her today. She was offered a shift to substitute at an elementary school about half an hour from our home.**

**I‚Äôve been feeling off the whole day. I should‚Äôve kissed her goodbye. I say that since I‚Äôm not sure if I did give her a kiss.**

**I have work later in the day, which can suck. But she‚Äôs coming home after I leave for work, now that sucks.**

**So I figured it would be a good idea to do something Pre-Her. Pre-Her being my life before 2/14/25. It feels like a lifetime ago. I feel like life didn‚Äôt begin until now. Speaking of her, she was right about one of the reasons I was journaling because I was pretty lonely.**

**I‚Äôm temporarily lonely so.**

I woke up at 4:15 in the morning on 6/6/25. I‚Äôm glad that the first alarm woke me up, I‚Äôm sure that the next five would‚Äôve woken me up anyway. 

I could‚Äôve showered the night before, but I figured it would be better if I showered now. It would help me wake up faster, if it didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs why coffee exists.

I made sure to put a couple in the fridge ahead of time. I was only going to drink one of them, the rest for my brother who was dropping me off at MSP. He was gonna do it for me for free, so I figure that I would get him a little something in return. Especially since he had work later at 7. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he‚Äôs already up around this time anyway. He‚Äôs got a fucked sleeping schedule. There‚Äôs been times where he‚Äôd sleep for 12 hours during high school, so I can‚Äôt imagine the naps he must be having now.

I packed light. It‚Äôs not like I was going to be staying at Los Angeles for the night. If anything, I was going to be staying at that Sun Country flight for the night with my girlfriend. I‚Äôm flying to Los Angeles so I could fly with her to Minneapolis. I figured that‚Äôs nothing compared to what she‚Äôs doing by moving to Minneapolis. It‚Äôs a lot on her. I wanted to make it easy as possible for the transition. Why? Because I love her.

I brought my Switch 2 with me, I bought it the morning before on its release. I was going to wait in line until morning, but it‚Äôs for the best that I didn‚Äôt because I would‚Äôve had zero sleep for this trip. I got the bundle with Mario Kart in it. I probably could‚Äôve waited to make this purchase.

My brother got to my house a few minutes early, of course, I was still rushing to get ready. I wasn‚Äôt too worried about getting to the airport quick though. TSA Pre-check is going to make up for it. I realized my brother was willing to take me when he sent me on a mission to pick up cupcakes from LAX.

Yes, he wanted cupcakes from the airport. I assumed it was for his girlfriend. His girlfriend that I didn‚Äôt know much of at the time. He does go through lengths for his partners. He sent me on another mission while I was in Japan to get an exclusive plushie. Just for that relationship to wind up in the bucket sometime later.

We said our goodbyes and I said my thanks. I busted my ass through TSA, I‚Äôm happy that I didn‚Äôt end up getting groped this time. If I had placed the hand sanitizer in my bag instead of my pocket, I wouldn‚Äôt have been groped though. 

I played some Mario Kart 8 as I waited for my flight to be ready. I would‚Äôve played the new Mario kart but my stupid ass forgot to set my switch up properly. I also kinda regret bringing it since I had kids and babies around me. 

Now, I don‚Äôt hate babies. But being around babies in an airplane is something else! They‚Äôre like a ticking time bomb, but without the jihadist. It also doesn‚Äôt help how uncomfortable planes in general can be for me. The flight to Minneapolis from LAX was definitely easier since my girlfriend was there next to me. Well‚Ä¶ the extra roomy seats we paid for did help. I might have to actually do that more in the future.

I mainly did word searches throughout the flight and listened to LA music. I made it to LA at around 6 AM PST. It was nice to be back! Even though, I wasn‚Äôt really in LA, just in LAX. 

The problem is that my girlfriend wouldn‚Äôt be there until 2 pm-ish. Why? She was at work while I was there. I decided that I‚Äôll begin the side mission that my brother sent me on. I thought I was losing my mind since the fucking map from LAX was wrong. The fucking cupcake machine wasn‚Äôt in terminal 2! 

So I had to go across the airport to the international terminals just so I could get my brother some cupcakes. I wish I found the chipotle before I had this overpriced burrito that was the size of an iPhone 6. Like that burrito was so small that it barely managed to fill me up. I didn‚Äôt really mind though since   
an angel was going to bring me some in-n-out and jack in a box. That angel being my girlfriend.

I mainly chilled after getting those cupcakes since I was dying of boredom. It also didn‚Äôt help that my phone was dying. Had to sit my ass on the ground to charge my phone. Like I could‚Äôve walked back to the terminal I was in so I could charge it sitting down. But I couldn‚Äôt bother at all. I just wanted to sit my ass down.

I was pretty happy upon hearing from my girlfriend that she was on her way to me. I did also feel bad since she was practically rushing to get here after her shift. She was also rushing to get me some In-N-Out and Jack In A Box. It had been two years since I last had some of those tiny tacos from Jacks, and I‚Äôve been craving them for two years. And now those cravings are being fulfilled. It really meant a lot to me that she was going out of her way to not only hook me up with that, but that she is moving to Minneapolis with me.  

It didn‚Äôt take that long, but it felt long to me since I was awaiting this moment since April. The moment that I would see her again in-person. We had a pretty big hug like it felt so right when we embraced one another, it felt like something out of a movie. But this is real.

She had mentioned beforehand that she didn‚Äôt want for us to have PDA in front of her mom, which is fair. I‚Äôd just have to kiss her some other time. 

We then sat down once we caught up. (My ass was starting to hurt at this point for how much it‚Äôs been sitting down) But I didn‚Äôt care about my ass getting sore because my love had brought me a double double, animal style fries, and tiny tacos. We were about to FEAST. I savored every single damn bite out of that meal. I didn‚Äôt care if I was making a mess on myself or if I was eating too quickly or if I looked like Gollum. I felt bad cause I wanted to kiss my girlfriend, but I don‚Äôt think she would‚Äôve appreciated me smearing ketchup or mustard on her. 

After our Lunch, we had a mission. We had to rearrange her luggage to make sure that she didn‚Äôt put too much weight on them. The airport fees can be a bitch. But honestly, it was difficult trying to rearrange everything throughout all our luggage. I should‚Äôve brought a bigger suitcase or duffel bag. Like it got to the point where we were debating if we should just pay the fee. We made it work though. 

And once we made it work, they sent our asses out of the line‚Ä¶ They said that we couldn‚Äôt check in early into our flight. But that had me fucked up since we had spoken to another attendant beforehand who said that it was okay.. My girlfriend soon received a phone call from the airline that we could check in early, which is fucking great because we could now have some actual seating instead of the hard ass ground.

We just have to go through security first. My girlfriend doesn‚Äôt have a passport or have a Real ID, so I was worried when I had to separate from her in line. I wasn‚Äôt able to find her anywhere when she was behind me, TSA was screaming for people to go through the line. The X-Ray was the easy part. Im grateful that I didn‚Äôt get felt up. But holy shit, did it stress me out. I fucked up by not taking my girlfriends laptop out of her bag. So TSA pulled me out of line to inspect through the bag. Am I fucking happy that I no longer carry that knife in my keychain. TSA would‚Äôve made my day an actual shitshow. 

I was also able to find my girlfriend, that got me to calm down. I don‚Äôt like going through TSA. I don‚Äôt appreciate how they make my blood pressure spike up. I‚Äôm just happy that we had that shit over with. Got through the hard part, now we could just relax before the flight. We pretty much chilled for that time. I had already done a lot of walking, so I was cool with taking it slow. 

Like it was really busy when we first got there in the waiting area, but once everyone left, it was really calming how empty it was. There was an amazing view where you could see planes take off. It‚Äôs an even better view when you don‚Äôt have to hear them being loud as fuck, so we appreciated that. We even cuddled for a bit. 

We still had hours to go before the plane got here. I probably should‚Äôve taken a nap, I think my girlfriend actually had a nap now that I think about it. 

**I‚Äôm actually pretty upset at myself for not making journaling more of a habit since my girlfriend moved here. It would‚Äôve been lovely to have a little recording of our first days together, but I suppose that‚Äôs why we have each other to remember in our old age. Also she isn‚Äôt really my girlfriend as of writing this now. Well, she‚Äôs my fiance now! I thought about having it be a surprise when I wrote about proposing to her. I proposed to her in bed, I do think I‚Äôd like to throw a more ‚Äúformal‚Äù proposal later in New York since I do feel kinda bad. A lot of change happened quick, but of course that‚Äôs expected with a major change, I did write some ramblings of our days though.**

The flight back to Minneapolis was nicee. I‚Äôm happy that we got those extended legroom seats. I don‚Äôt usually go for that, but I understand why people put the money towards it. It‚Äôs just much more relaxing‚Ä¶ the seats felt more comfortable. It was my girlfriends (now finace‚Äôs) idea. We held our hands a lot, I really missed doing that. 

We didn‚Äôt have much trouble heading to MSP.  It was an overnight flight so we managed to get a few hours of sleep. Shit still left me sleepy after that. I don‚Äôt know how people can manage to get a full rest with a plane that can shake you awake. 

My mom was already on her way there to pick us up. It did take awhile for the luggage to arrive. I was hoping that the employees didn‚Äôt fuck up my girlfriends luggage up. I was worried that it‚Äôll explode and we‚Äôd have to frantically put her stuff back in there. I get flashbacks of what happened to me returning from LA a couple years ago. My suitcase slid out of the heavy luggage area with shit spilling out of it. Had a fucking anime figurine poking out of it.

Luckily, she didn‚Äôt pack any figurines so her suitcase didn‚Äôt explode. It‚Äôs actually the same suitcase I used for that trip. And when I mean she, I don‚Äôt mean the figurine. 

My mom picked us up. She was pretty happy to see us. I think she really likes my partner because of how much happier I‚Äôve been now due to her. We talked about the flight, the plans my partner and I have, and about visiting my mom soon sometime. (Soon already happened by the time of writing this. Shit. Coming soon had already happened by the time of writing this)

It was nice arriving at this time (6AM), the sun was still coming up. I felt like this day had a lot of ‚Äúmovie moments‚Äù. We went up to our bedroom. It‚Äôs nice no longer calling it my bedroom. We then held each other once more and drifted to sleep. Our lives begin now.

1lpks6f,https://i.redd.it/03lu1pqejdaf1.jpeg,MRE diet,"After seeing the previous attempt from XanzMakeHerDance unfortunately end early, I decided to take up the gauntlet and eat one MRE a day. After I‚Äôve tried every item from both menus I will contemplate continuing. Currently on day 4, will post the 4th review after I‚Äôve consumed it. My previous experience has been with Canadian IMPs and I will often contrast and compare as such. 

The first US MRE I tried was the chili Mac, and honestly it was overhyped a good bit. Came with orange drink, twizzlers, vegetable crackers (super good), jalape√±o cheese spread, and probably something else but I forget. Overall, felt like it was less food than a Canadian IMP, but it was good. The mini bottle of tobasco was cool, and I did not get one in the next two MREs. No coffee In this one. 

Second MRE was the Italian sausage, which was quite delicious. The snacks however were lack luster. Inside was trail mix with cranberries, almonds and beef jerky, peanuts, and dried cranberries. All of these were good on their own but when eaten together it was just one big trail mix and I would‚Äôve liked to see some variation. This one came with lemon sports drink I believe, 
which was not terrible. No coffee. Regular crackers are way worse than vegetable crackers, same with the plain cheese vs jalape√±o. 

Pepperoni pizza was my favourite of the three, purely because you can make an apple crumble with the dessert. Crushing the oatmeal cookie and adding it to the apple slices in sauce, along with the creamer and sugar pack turns it into an amazing dessert. This one did come with coffee. I was expecting the pizza to be worse, but actually reminded me of pizza I used to have for lunch as a kid. The chocolate shake was mid, the powder refused to mix nicely. I wish it came with peanut butter instead of cheese spread so I could add it to the shake (might use personal peanut butter in the future). The shake was very filling, and I comfortably was able to finish my day. 

Overall, pretty pleased with the MREs but none of them had sporks (spoons instead) and only one came with hot sauce. In Canadian IMPs all of them come with a sports drink and coffee, as well as a packet of franks hot sauce. The Lunch rat has 2 drinks which I don‚Äôt expect to see here. Disappointing to see this isn‚Äôt the same. The packaging in US MREs is very robust compared to Canadian MREs using a paper bag and still encasing most items in cardboard, requiring more field stripping when packing them. There‚Äôs other minor differences, like IMPs have tic tacs but I prefer the cinnamon gum in the MREs. Canadian IMPs do not come with the heater inside and must be sourced separately which is a nice change. 

For day 3, bowel movements are regular and energy levels are normal. I am also working out in conjunction with this and might start doing ruck marches to fit the vibe. Occasional supplementary Rip its or other energy drinks may be added on some days.  ",10,1751424219.0,MRE,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôm hoping for some advice and support. I weigh 235 lbs and am 5feet 6inches. I started my diet after fasting about a week ago. My supplements I take are BCAA, Electrolyte pills, MCT oil, a women‚Äôs multivitamin, sometimes Lipsomal Vitamen C, and my protein powders that I put in black coffee and water.

I am intermittent fasting by only eating in a 6 hour window. I‚Äôm not sure what that‚Äôs called, I think 18:6? 

I have terminal stage 4 breast cancer and some liver problems, and I am also obese. I started keto mainly for weight loss, liver repair, and to help fight my cancer because I‚Äôve heard from many people and research that it helps fight cancer.

Right now I‚Äôm having a hard time eating enough calories and fat each day. I do hit my protein goal and keep my carbs at 20g or under daily (I count total carbs, not net carbs), but my fat and overall calories are usually low. I exercise at least 30 minutes to an hour every day on a split treadmill that keeps pressure off of my joints because I have holes all over my body left from the tumors that have been eradicated successfully with chemo and some radiation.

I just finished a 48-hour water fast recently, supplemented with electrolytes, cream of tartar for potassium, and magnesium pills. Surprisingly, the fast was easy for me, and I‚Äôve already gone through the re-feeding process.

I want to make sure I‚Äôm doing this safely and effectively, especially given my health conditions. Does anyone have tips for eating enough fat and calories on keto when you just aren‚Äôt that hungry?

Well, I just wanted to share a small moment that really stuck with me.

Last Sunday, during one of our chats, I asked him:
‚ÄúDid you ever feel angry that no one in the family tried to learn ASL before?‚Äù

He paused. Then he smiled gently and signed:
‚ÄúNot angry. Just lonely. I always hoped someone would try.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever forget that.

That moment reminded me why this journey matters so much. ASL didn‚Äôt just give us a way to communicate it gave him something he waited a lifetime for: to be seen and understood.

1lpkp6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/1lpkp6z/im_50f_still_angry_about_a_fight_with_my_husband/,I‚Äôm (50F) still angry about a fight with my husband (52M) because it‚Äôs the same topic that keeps coming up. How do we get to a different outcome?,"I work 3 days a week but long shifts (12hr) so on my two work week days off I do shopping and cook for the days I‚Äôm not around at dinner. I also manage all the family finances (making sure bills are paid etc), organize everything for the kid‚Äôs‚Äô activities and needs (sports, doctor‚Äôs appointments etc). While my husband and family will ‚Äòhelp‚Äô, it is not unless I specifically ask. Garbage overflowing? No one sees it until I ask someone to take it outside. Collection of dishes in their rooms? They were just about to take them downstairs to the kitchen. Cat puked on the white tile floor while I was at work and is now dried to the floor like cement? Oh they didn‚Äôt see it. 

Yesterday was a ‚Äòday off‚Äô so my schedule is packed with things I need to get done along with an appointment (not sitting sipping mai tai‚Äôs or whatever the kids think I do). I do all the cooking (the topic isn‚Äôt whether I should be, I‚Äôm fine with that part) and the kids wanted tacos so I was checking supplies we would need. The kids prefer soft tortillas (which I never eat) so I keep both the small taco size and larger wrap size in the fridge. I was pretty sure I had lots but when I took out the bags, both had been put back unsealed so they were all dried out and useless, about 20 wraps in total. They come in ziplock type bags which are a bit flimsy so I checked both bags for tears and that the zippers worked. The bags were fine.

I take them out of the fridge and toss them on the counter, and ask my husband and daughter (son was asleep) what the plan for dinner will be now? I don‚Äôt eat these things, and since I do all the cooking hubby does all the putting away of leftovers. Hubby says he doesn‚Äôt eat them either. Daughter says nothing. I ask again- who will fix this now? I‚Äôm not only mad that food was wasted but the expectation will be that I fix it. So I said I am not fixing it, and not fixing anything or doing anything for anyone for the next week. And I left. 

Got back late morning to grab lunch before my afternoon appointment and wanted to talk to husband. He works from home and I started to tell him that I‚Äôm so frustrated because I don‚Äôt expect accolades for the things I do, I just don‚Äôt want people adding to my responsibilities and my mental work load because I literally have all the mental load. And when I ask him to do something (like book a day to get the car‚Äôs oil changed since he works from home and the car sits in the driveway if he doesn‚Äôt need it, so makes sense for him to book a time when he can pop it over) he will often ‚Äòforget‚Äô until I remind him. So I still carry the mental load. 

I start having this same old conversation when he says he understands I am mad but is too busy to talk right then. I said fine, but I‚Äôm not doing anything anymore until he tells me what a solution will be so this doesn‚Äôt happen again. Work day for him ends and the dogs want to be fed. He is ignoring them jumping around until I say ‚Äòsorry dogs I guess you aren‚Äôt getting fed today‚Äô. Hubby asks why not. I told him that me doing nothing means just that- nothing. He didn‚Äôt have time to talk before so I will continue to do nothing until we do. And I walk away and spend the rest of the night in our bedroom. I had some leftover Halloween chocolate in my room so ate that for dinner.

At one point he comes in the room and sits at his work desk. I ask if he needs to do more work tonight because I‚Äôll go if he does. He says no, just needs his phone charger. He takes it and goes. Three hours later I turn off the light and go to sleep.

I‚Äôm typing this as I sit in my car at 7:25am. I need to be at work for 8am. Got here at 6:30am because I couldn‚Äôt sleep. Hubby hasn‚Äôt tried to call or text. I won‚Äôt be home until after 8pm. I‚Äôm always the one who starts the conversation again after we fight, but not this time. So since there is coffee inside I‚Äôll go in now and maybe come up with an idea for tonight but would love some suggestions. Thanks!",7,1751423970.0,relationships_advice,5,1.0,False
1lpkocy,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1lpkocy/my_29ffianc√©_25m_has_been_excessively_fighting/,My (29F)fianc√© (25M) has been excessively fighting with me pregnant and it‚Äôs making me feel like it was a mistake.,"The title says it for the most part. I found out I was pregnant 6 weeks ago. I was in shock, as it was unexpected. I already have two children and have been separated from their father for 5 years. My new fianc√© and I talk often about kids and we both wanted another one but agreed that in 1-2 years we‚Äôd begin trying to grow our family. It happened sooner than we thought and overall were feeling happy about it. I was very nervous due to just getting accepted into Stanford to complete my degree (and it‚Äôs my dream) but I decided to take a gap year, focus on the pregnancy and enjoy it as much as possible before sending myself off to school next fall. 
Recently all we do is fight. Over minor issues, and I mean minor. Yet somehow they blow up from 0-100 within a matter of 30 minutes and we‚Äôre screaming at each other until I start having a mental breakdown and crying. I‚Äôve tried explaining multiple times that I‚Äôm having a hard time handling my emotions while being pregnant. Im sick every day, have crippling exhaustion, and just don‚Äôt feel like myself. It‚Äôs been hard to say the least considering I was an avid gym lover and active mom. It‚Äôs getting to the point that we are just both extremely defensive and angry. It‚Äôs making me feel resentful, especially because it‚Äôs such a vulnerable time for my emotional state as my body goes through these changes. I‚Äôll tell him I need space or that I can‚Äôt talk, but that makes it worse and things always escalate to us screaming at each other. It‚Äôs now gotten to the point that he just tells me how awful I am and how I‚Äôm not doing enough. How I don‚Äôt give him enough reassurance, how I‚Äôm not there for him, how he feels alone, that he doesn‚Äôt know how he ended up with a woman like me, that we can just figure things out with the baby. Let me also tell you that I‚Äôm have also said these same hurtful things. At this point it feels like verbal warfare and I feel lost. Prior to pregnancy I‚Äôve always been the level headed one, and try to stay emotionally sound. Since becoming pregnant, I just feel like dogshit and am constantly crying and feel so depressed. I try my best to be there for him but can‚Äôt help that I‚Äôm nauseous all day long and have no energy. I just lay in bed and cry. I hate how that‚Äôs taken as im not loving anymore and that I don‚Äôt do enough. We‚Äôve tried having calm conversations multiple times. They usually end pretty well, but things go right back to normal. The other day we were fighting because he got to my house and texted me that he arrived but my phone was in my bag and I had taken the kids to get a muffin from a coffee shop at the corner. I left him waiting for 15 mins until I had arrived back home and he stormed inside and gave me the silent treatment, then told me he was going to the gym without me (we had planned on going together) this made me angry and I asked why he was acting that way. I had only just run a quick errand with the children. That fight blew up to an extreme and we ended up fighting for literally the next 12hours.
I feel emotionally defeated. Depleted, mentally exhausted, depressed, alone, and fearful of the kind of environment im going to bring my child into, or even how he‚Äôll be treating me the rest of pregnancy or postpartum. I don‚Äôt have family where we live, as I moved across the country at 18. I just want to know if I‚Äôm being irrational for thinking that parting ways is for the better.  Please no harsh comments. I‚Äôd love some sound advice or suggestions on how to be better. How can I be better? How can I fix this? I know I‚Äôm not the easiest to deal with being emotional and pregnant. But I‚Äôm also feeling so lost and alone. I love him with my whole heart but feel like I can‚Äôt keep doing this. I‚Äôm leaving many more explosive arguments out of this post due to it being so long, but just know that 99% of the time, they‚Äôre over something that I personally

#‚Å¢ Basic Inquiry: Cost-Effective ArtfulExplorations‚Äå materials

ArtfulExplorations,a term we'll use to encompass ‚Å§creative endeavors driven by exploration,experimentation,and‚Äç personal expression‚Äå rather than strict adherence to customary techniques or expensive supplies,thrive on ingenuity and resourcefulness. The beauty of this approach lies in its accessibility: ‚Å§a limited budget shouldn't be a barrier to artistic expression. Instead,constrained resources can foster creativity and innovation,pushing artists to‚Å£ find‚Å¢ new uses for everyday objects and to re-evaluate what truly constitutes ‚Äúart supplies.‚Äù This ‚Å¢article delves into the realm of cost-effective materials for ArtfulExplorations, providing practical guidance‚Äå and insights to help individuals‚Äå and educators alike cultivate‚Äç creativity without breaking the bank. We will explore readily available resources, affordable‚Å£ substitutions, and techniques for maximizing the value of budget-friendly options.

**The Importance of Cost-Effectiveness in ArtfulExplorations**

Exploring artistic mediums ‚Å¢and developing individual artistic styles can be a challenging journey, especially when financial constraints loom large. by embracing cost-effective ‚Å§materials, individuals can liberate themselves from‚Å£ the pressure of expensive supplies and focus fully on the creative process. This allows for more experimentation, risk-taking, and ultimately, a deeper understanding of their own artistic potential. Moreover, cost-effectiveness‚Äç promotes sustainability by encouraging the reuse of materials and ‚Å§reducing ‚Äçwaste, aligning artistic endeavors with environmentally conscious practices. For educators,utilizing inexpensive ‚Äãmaterials makes art accessible to a wider range‚Å¢ of students,nonetheless of their socioeconomic background,fostering inclusivity and equal opportunity‚Äå in creative learning.

**Foundational Drawing and Sketching Materials on a ‚ÄåBudget**

Drawing and sketching form the ‚Äçbackbone of many artistic practices, ‚Å£and fortunately, quality results can be achieved without‚Å§ emptying your wallet. A simple graphite pencil set,‚Å§ ranging from‚Å£ hard (H) to soft (B) grades, provides‚Äå a versatile foundation for sketching,‚Äå shading, and creating detailed drawings. Avoid overly expensive brands; student-grade pencils often perform admirably.

A crucial companion to pencils is the ‚Äçright paper.Instead of investing in premium drawing paper for initial explorations, consider using inexpensive sketchbooks or even repurposed paper, such as office paper that has only been printed on ‚Å§one side. Newsprint is another remarkably inexpensive drawing surface ideal for swift sketches, gesture drawings, and practicing techniques. Remember that the purpose of these initial forays is experimentation and skill-building, not necessarily the creation of finished masterpieces.Erasers are also essential.‚Äå A ‚Å§kneaded eraser ‚Äåis ‚Äãa versatile‚Äç tool for lifting graphite and creating subtle variations in tone, while a ‚Äãsimple pink rubber eraser provides a more ‚Äãassertive erasing capability. A‚Äã plastic‚Äå eraser ‚Äçcan ‚Äåalso be very useful.

**Paint Alternatives: Exploring Affordable Options**

while professional-grade paints can be costly,several affordable alternatives offer ample opportunities for artistic expression. tempera paints, also known‚Å§ as poster paints, are a budget-friendly option ‚Å§ideal for beginners and large-scale projects. They provide‚Å¢ good coverage and are easy ‚Äåto clean ‚Äãup with water. Although their colors may not be as vibrant or permanent as acrylics, they offer excellent value for experimentation and learning color mixing‚Äå techniques.

Another surprisingly ‚Å§versatile and cost-effective option is watercolor paint. Start with a student-grade watercolor set, wich typically includes a range of colors in pan or tube form.Watercolor techniques can be‚Äã mastered through patient practice‚Äã and experimentation, leading to gorgeous and expressive results. Watercolor paper, though slightly more expensive than sketch paper, is essential for ‚Äåpreventing warping and allowing ‚Å£the paint to flow smoothly.

For a more durable and permanent option, consider acrylic paints. While professional-grade acrylics can be pricey,student-grade versions offer a good balance ‚Å£of quality and affordability. Acrylics are incredibly versatile and can be used on a variety of surfaces, including canvas, ‚Å£paper, wood,‚Äç and even fabric.

Homemade‚Å§ paints offer another highly cost-effective and experimental‚Äã avenue. Natural pigments‚Äã can be derived from ‚Äåsources such as berries, spices, soils, and even coffee grounds. while the results ‚Å§may be less predictable and permanent than commercially produced paints, the process of creating and using homemade pigments can be a rewarding and educational experience, fostering a deeper connection to‚Äã the materials and the surroundings.

**Sculpting and 3D Art on a Shoe String**

Sculpting and three-dimensional art forms don't have to be expensive to explore. One of the most readily available and cost-effective materials for sculpting‚Äã is paper mache. Made from simple ingredients like flour, water, and newspaper, paper mache allows for the creation of lightweight and‚Å§ surprisingly durable sculptures. The process is also incredibly accessible and can be enjoyed by people of all‚Äç ages‚Äã and skill levels.

Another readily available material is clay. Air-dry‚Å£ clay is an affordable and mess-free option for beginners. It requires no firing and hardens on its own, making‚Å§ it‚Å¢ convenient‚Äå for creating small sculptures and prototypes. While it may not be ‚Äåas durable as fired clay, it‚Äå provides a great introduction to the basics of sculpting and‚Äå form ‚Äçmanipulation.

Recycled materials offer‚Å¢ a wealth of‚Å§ possibilities for sculptural ‚Å£exploration. Cardboard boxes, plastic bottles, bottle caps, and other‚Äç discarded items can be transformed into imaginative and thought-provoking‚Å£ sculptures. This approach not only reduces waste but also encourages creativity and‚Å£ resourcefulness, challenging artists to see the potential in everyday objects.

**Alternative Surfaces: Thinking Outside ‚Äãthe Canvas**

While stretched canvases can be a significant ‚Äåexpense,there are numerous affordable alternatives that offer ‚Äãunique textures and visual appeal. ‚ÄçCardboard, for example, provides a‚Å¢ sturdy and readily available surface ‚Äåfor painting and mixed ‚Äåmedia projects. It can be primed with gesso to create a smooth surface or left unprimed for ‚Äåa ‚Å§more textured and raw aesthetic.Wood panels, available at most hardware stores, offer ‚Å¢another durable and affordable option. Plywood‚Å§ or even reclaimed wood can be cut to size and sanded to‚Å£ create a smooth surface for painting. Alternatively,the natural texture‚Äã of the wood can be incorporated into the artwork for added visual interest.

Fabric scraps, such as old clothing or bedsheets, can be stretched over a frame or adhered to a ‚Å£surface to create a unique and textured painting surface. This approach allows for experimentation ‚Å§with different textures and patterns, adding depth and dimension to‚Äç the artwork.

**Finding Free and‚Äå Discounted Art Supplies**

Beyond material choices,access can be increased by knowing where to look for accessible or discounted supplies. Thrift stores and‚Å¢ flea markets are often treasure troves of discarded art supplies,offering‚Äã paints,brushes,canvases,and‚Å£ other materials at significantly reduced prices. ‚Å§Online marketplaces and community groups‚Å£ are also great places to find deals on used or unwanted art supplies.

Building relationships with local businesses can also be beneficial. Many businesses discard materials that can be repurposed for art, such as cardboard boxes, ‚Å£scrap paper, and fabric remnants. By simply asking, artists can often gain access to a steady supply of free ‚Äãor low-cost materials.

**Conclusion: Embracing Constraints and Fostering creativity**

Cost-effective materials‚Å£ for ArtfulExplorations are not simply about saving ‚Äçmoney; they are about fostering creativity, resourcefulness, and sustainability.By embracing ‚Å£the‚Äã limitations of a budget, ‚Äåartists can unlock new possibilities, experiment with unconventional materials, and develop a deeper recognition for the artistic process. Ultimately, the most crucial ingredient for‚Å§ successful ArtfulExplorations is not expensive supplies, but rather a curious mind, a willingness to experiment, and a passion for creative expression. By‚Å¢ focusing on these core values,individuals and educators alike can cultivate a thriving artistic community that‚Å£ is accessible,inclusive,and environmentally conscious.financial constraints should not be artistic limitations, but rather creative‚Äç catalysts, proving that true art ‚Äãcan be created with minimal resources.

With the approval of Mr. Rags, I'm going to do just that. I'm not the greatest of writers and I'm sure that sentiment will be reflected here over the course of my stories, so please bear with me. As long as I don't divulge our precise location, I'm in the clear. A big thank you to Mr. Rags, if he ever does read these. Anyways, I should start with a little background to get you up to speed.



I grew up like a lot of lower-middle class families. My dad was a carpenter for a few different companies, bouncing around to wherever the work went, and my mother was a stay-at-home mom, though she made some money on the side selling fresh breads and baked goods. The house always smelled like confectionaries, to the detriment of my slow metabolism. At 18, following High School, I decided to follow in my father's footsteps and joined a trade school while working as a runner for a construction company. They had a 'jack of all trades' kind of track that I selected, giving me a little bit of knowledge in most home repair services, along with basic handyman business acumen. Unfortunately while I was away, my parents both passed. It was a tragic highway accident, heavy rain and low visibility, so it wasn't anyone's fault. After the funeral, it took a couple months to get their affairs in order and sell the family home. I'm an only child, and I couldn't imagine living in the house without them, so I decided to take the profits and move out west, something my dad and I had talked and dreamed about on plenty of occasions. It's weird, but if they had never passed, I wouldn't be here now at The Complex. I also wouldn‚Äôt have been abducted and implanted and‚Ä¶ well we‚Äôll get to that soon.



I had a used Subaru that was older than me by 10 years. It was usually fit as a fiddle so buying a new one seemed asinine at the time. Looking back, I feel like a bit of an idiot, though that‚Äôs almost a daily occurrence now. I'd taken it on a few road trips with nary an issue, but this time was different. I was making my way West starting in Maine, traveling through the Appalachia's over to the great corn seas of the Mid-West, down to Texas and then up heading towards Colorado. I'd made it to New Mexico and was driving for about an hour or two when the engine started to make a horrendous noise. It sounded like something akin to a shotgun blast followed by two pieces of sheet metal rubbing ferociously against each other in the fiery throes of passion. The car shuddered, lurching forward in stop-and-go patterns until finally came to a end, dead in its tracks. I was at least 2 or 3 hours from anywhere remotely populated, or so I thought, and of course I had no cell signal in the slightest. Took some time and tried looking at the engine but it never was my forte, so it ended up being a fruitless endeavor. I resigned myself to sitting in the front seat, all the doors open with the flashers on, sweating my ass off. While I was weighing my options, I leaned the seat back and decided to doze off, an attempt to cure a headache brewing over the frustration of my situation.



Upon waking up, I realized the hairs all over my body were standing like pins and it felt like I was on the verge of having a panic attack. My heartbeat pounded and it felt like a lead weight sat in my stomach, beads of sweat now covering my forehead. It was darker now, much darker, the inky black of night only barely giving way to pinhole stars in the sky. I scrambled up in my seat and tried taking in my surroundings. Something was watching me, I could feel it. I checked all the mirrors and looked out every window. Glancing around frantically, something in the rear view caught my eye for a split second. Next to a couple of tall cactuses about 50 feet from my car, stood something short and white-ish, completely still, staring right back at me. It tilted it‚Äôs head slightly, almost quizzically. I pressed my brakes to try and make the rear lights flare up, but they weren‚Äôt working. I turned in my seat to check it out through the back window, when I caught a flash of it darting towards a large rock pile right next to my car. I think I screamed, hurrying to shut the doors and windows. I rag dolled myself through the interior of my car to get everything closed without going outside. 



I completed my task, sweating and nearly hyperventilating, and for a moment, the feeling of safety slowly crept back. I went to check the cars clock but nothing was working. I tried turning the key, honking the horn, turning on the radio, but nothing worked. I checked my phone for any signs of life. 11PM flashed back at me. I was sleeping for... at least 12 hours. I thought, ""There's no way. I would've woken up before then, I would've needed to drink or eat or..."" my thoughts stopped in their tracks. As I was sitting there, reeling at how I could've lost hours of the day like they were nothing, the car began to vibrate. At first it was slow, almost rhythmic, but quickly became a fast buzzing feeling, like a giant bee was sitting on top of it. I got ready to hop out of the car, but before I could, there was a flash of white light, brighter than the sun. Technically it's still the last thing I remember from that night still, but there‚Äôs a reason for that.



I woke up some hours later to a pair of headlights coming towards me from down the road. I spun my head around again and saw nothing by the rock or the cactuses, but quickly realized through sudden movements that my head was pounding and my entire body felt like I had ran a marathon. My thoughts of the entire debacle were happily replaced by the sounds of a white T-top Trans Am barreling towards me. It passed me in the car for a moment, then stopped, tires screeching on the pavement leaving long black rubber lines. He revved the engine, put it in reverse, shining bright red taillights into the night, and tore ass right back to where I was sitting, rolling down the window as he shouted.



""Hey buddy! You're lookin a little worse for wear! You like, stranded out here or something? Ain't too safe along the roads here at night."" he said in a valley boy type of accent.



I looked around at the vast nothingness before looking back to him and sarcastically answering, though with an abundance of caution in my voice. ""Yeah I‚Äôm alone out here.. I think. Hey you're real right? Did you just see that huge flash? Like the sun just exploded here on Earth?""



""Uhh no, no I can't say I saw that tonight man, but I do know what you're talking about. You feeling okay? Skin doesn't feel too hot, you're not throwing up your bloody guts?"" he asked.



""I... no? I don't think so. I feel fine other than my head. I think I hit it or something, I don't know. I've been stranded out here for hours. Do you know how far the next city is?""



He laughed, and offered me a ride into town, saying it's only a short drive up the way.



""What town?"" I said. ""There's nothing on my map here, and my planned route doesn't have another place with people for a couple hours.""



""Oh man, no need to worry about that. No worries! Maps don't always show ya the big picture you know? I'll get you right as rain my man. Actually, I know just the guy to get you feeling straight shooting again A.S.A.P! Just hop on in and I'll take you to see the big man himself, the big man on campus. I'm sure he'll like you, cause I already kind of like you!"" he chortled and patted the poorly aged passenger seat.



I laughed nervously, bending down a bit to get a better look at the guy and his ride. He seemed nice enough and gave the aura of a guy plucked right out of 1984, neon sunglasses and all. I looked back at my car and took a deep breath.



""Hey dude, once we get back to The Complex, I can totally get a mechanic to come grab your ride. I promise, not a soul out here is going to touch it. Pinky promise!""



Against everything my brain was telling me, I grabbed my duffel bag and other belongings, threw them in the back seat of his hot rod, and strapped myself in. He gave me a huge grin and extended a paw my way. ""Heck yeah man! Names Ray, and yours?""



""Uh yeah, I'm Zach, nice to meet you man. I really appreciate your help, not sure what I would've done if you hadn't stopped.""



""Not a problem at all dude, I believe a good deed done is a good deed in the bank, so maybe I'll score something big next time at the swap meet!"" he laughed as he pushed in a cassette and turned up the volume. We tore off towards his town blaring 'All Night Long' by Lionel Richie. I took a deep breath and stared out the window, wondering how the hell the night was going to end up.



It only took about 20 minutes to reach the edge of town, though I'm not sure you could really call it a town. As we pulled into the gas station (Rays office/sleeping arrangements/full time job) I realized there were only 5 buildings. The gas station, lit up like a cheap motel on the strip in Vegas, a small mom and pop looking store with a few parking spots out front, an even smaller windowless thing with one door, which turned out to be a maintenance building/den or horrors. Then there was the church about 100 yards from it, and directly across from the church was the main attraction. Standing tall was a 10 story tower resembling something more like a large government building than an apartment complex. It was an all tan brick facade with plenty of windows wrapping around it, a couple of pillars out front with the entrance steps, but nothing else. It looked very out of place in the middle of nowhere New Mexico. Ray threw his car in park and hopped out in one swift motion, gesturing for me to follow. I couldn't believe my luck that a total stranger actually picked me up and didn't take me to some far off shack to harvest my organs. By the time I got out, he was already halfway to the large buildings entrance. The lights out front illuminated most of the road, to which the neon lights of the ""The Station"" made up for the rest. The Church had a modest set of lights by the front door, but they were easily drowned out by the others.



""Hey man! You coming or what? I think we can still catch Mr. Rags if he's awake! Let's go!"" I started towards him, still a little weary of the situation but I didn't have much of a choice. Once I caught up to him, we were both standing at the entrance to the building. ""Alright man, this here is called The Complex. Mr. Rags owns and runs it. Yes that's his name, and no I don't know if that's his actual god given one. He's really chill as long as you don't mess around too bad. I mean like really mess around, hurt someone or something ya know? Just be real cool with him, and I bet he'll help you out, no sweat!""



Before I could reply, he reached over to click the large button labeled ""10"" on the intercom system. The whole thing looked lavish, emblazoned with bronze numbers and filigree around the edges, clearly sticking out against the drab tan bricks around it. Ray just stood there, bobbing his head to some tune I'm sure was stuck in his brain, quietly humming along. He reached out to ring it again, but just before his finger hit the button, a voice came through the intercom.



""Yes Ray, how may I help you this evening?"" The voice sounded kind and older, with a slight British accent. I figured someone would be irate being called at this time of night.



""Yeah! Hello there Mr. Rags sir, I'm real sorry to bother you tonight, but I found a friend in need here. I think he saw the you-know-whats and is pretty out of sorts. Could you maybe take a look at him real quick? He can crash at my place after, not a worry there sir!"" Ray said, looking nervous but excited.



""Oh is that so? Well, I can't in good conscience turn someone away like that now could I Ray? You know what they say, a good deed done is a..."" Ray chimed in with him to finish the sentiment. ""A good deed in the bank! Yeah Mr. Rags exactly, that's exactly what I say. I knew you'd be able to help! I'll send him on up if that's okay?""



""Absolutely dear boy, just send him up. I'll be waiting."" The mic cut off as Ray nudged me forward.



""Alright man, best behavior. Just in the front doors here, straight back to the elevator and click the only button for floor 10. That's where Mr. Rags lives, right up on top. I promise, he's a real cool guy even if he's a little creepy. Just have him check you out then I'll be waiting over at the station for ya!""



I thanked him, Ray reaching out for a fist bump before trotting down the stairs towards his place. I looked back at the double doors, hesitant to enter. I inched towards them, and as I did, they unlocked through what sounded like a series of electronic deadbolts. The doors opened silently, perfectly in sync, revealing a spacious interior adorned with vintage chairs and pots full of luscious greenery. I walked past it all, peeking around at the other doors. One side looked like it contained a large dining room and kitchen, the other housing a laundry room or utility area. Making my way through to the elevator, I realized the entire area smelled like fresh cut flowers, though there were none in sight. The elevator doors opened with a 'ding' as they moved, beckoning me inside. I got in, found the number 10, and pressed it. The doors hissed this time, closing like they were a part of a pneumatic system, sealing me inside as if I were fresh meat being packaged in an airtight container. It dinged one more time before lurching upward towards my destination.



The elevator seemed to only take 2 or 3 seconds to reach the top of the entire building. The doors hissed again, opening to a very dark corridor. I called out, ""Mr. Rags? Sir?"" to no response. The elevator shuddered, then chimed something more akin to an alarm beep than a pleasant ding, urging me to disembark. Stepping inside the corridor, there were a few wall lights that turned on, though only enough for a dim glow to ooze over the few things inside the room. A velvet waiting chair and matching loveseat, a few very old but still lovely end tables and a larger matching coffee table, and an ancient looking piano on the other side to even everything out. At the end of the room stood a large maroon door, adorned with brass or bronze inlays all across it, yet with no discernible shape. I swear, as I drew closer to the door, the inlays were moving, or squirming into different designs. Taking a few shallow breaths, I pressed my knuckles into the door, three times. As soon as my skin touched it for the third time, the door slowly opened without a sound.



Inside, it looked like any other apartment setup, albeit with a large open concept. A nice dining room set like a retro diner, a few stylish newer couches around a larger old radio, a kitchen set from the 1970‚Äôs; every thing a different age of creation from the last. I took a few steps in and closed the door behind me. I turned my head for maybe 2 or 3 seconds to do so, but when I looked back into the room, Mr. Rags was sitting on the edge of the sofa seat.



‚ÄúOh Jesus, sorry sir. The door just opened when I knocked and I figured maybe..‚Äù he held a hand up to stop me. Not just ask me to stop, but somehow he made me stop talking, like it all got caught in my throat.



‚ÄúYou‚Äôre alright, I wasn‚Äôt waiting long.‚Äù He spoke, almost jovially, a soft smile on his face. ‚ÄúApologies for the scare, I just like to keep an eye on the door. She can be finicky at times, picky even on who she lets in, never mind whether I want them to or not.‚Äù He looked over at the opposite couch, nodding for me to join him.



‚ÄúFor us to continue this conversation, I need you to extend to me a great amount of trust. I know it seems silly, dangerous even, to do so for someone you‚Äôve only just met, but it‚Äôs of dire importance. You need to answer me entirely truthfully. Did you happen upon a creature in the desert? Possibly lose time or see a bright light?‚Äù he leaned towards me, almost floating on the couches edge.



‚ÄúUh, yeah exactly that. My car broke down completely, I fell asleep and woke up to something just watching me. The car began shaking and there was a flash of light and then‚Ä¶ nothing. I can‚Äôt remember a single thing besides Ray showing up and bringing me here. How in the hell would you know about this? I‚Äôm starting to get nervous.‚Äù



Mr. Rags nodded thoughtfully, staring at me a few moments, before slowly standing up and walking over to me. I recoiled slightly, my fight-or-flight kicking in. He stopped briefly in front of me.



‚ÄúAgain, I know this is an immense amount of trust to put in a stranger, but I need to fix you up, so to speak. If I‚Äôm unwelcome to do so, you may experience more of these events, and eventually you may not be around at all. I‚Äôm afraid I would also need you to leave our town in the event this doesn‚Äôt work, or you decide to forgo it entirely. I‚Äôll give you a moment to think about it while I get things ready.‚Äù he walked past me, down the hall into another room.



I watched and listened as he entered what looked to be a bathroom, things clanging as cupboards opened and closed. My heart was racing and my mind was clouded by a million thought streams, every one slightly worse than the last. Am I going to be murdered? Is he getting ready to take my kidney and throw me on ice? I was only 22 years old, I felt like there was much, much more in front of me I wanted to accomplish and experience. Before I could gather myself, Mr. Rags came waltzing out of the door, gliding down the hall towards me.



Standing up from the couch, I asked him, ‚ÄúWhat exactly are you going to do to me? I swear, I won't call the cops, I won‚Äôt tell anyone you‚Äôre here if you just let me go.‚Äù



He chuckled, then stared me dead in the eyes. ‚ÄúDear boy, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to call if you tried. Your phone is dead and the nearest working one is across the street in the shop. You have no idea where you are and no working vehicle. I don‚Äôt say these things to scare you, but to implore you to see reason. I shall not bring you harm, in fact, it‚Äôs to be quite the opposite. You have something inside you that needs to be removed. Something that, if left unabated, will cause you much more turmoil in the future. Your head must feel like a storm is raging inside it, yes?‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ Is this about the things in the desert?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI feel like a bus hit me. Whatever you need to do, just please, don‚Äôt hurt me.‚Äù



‚ÄúI would never. Please, look forward.‚Äù



I felt a small pain on the back of my neck. I craned my head back to find Mr. Rags smiling down at me, a scalpel in his hand.



‚ÄúWhat the fuck? Did you just?‚Äù I felt the back of my neck with my hand, a small smear of blood covered my fingers as I did.



‚ÄúI do profusely apologize, but yes, the ‚Äòoperation‚Äô was a success.‚Äù he air quoted with his hands, ginning sheepishly. ‚ÄúHere, a bandaid for the small incision, and this.‚Äù he raised a small glass vial, dumping in an even smaller grey piece of metal. ‚ÄúI know, I know, you have many questions. In due time, I will answer all of them. For now, you need to get some rest while I deal with this.‚Äù he gestured to the vial. I felt sick, covering my mouth to try and hold back the upheaval from my insides. Mr. Rags rushed around the couch, helping me lay down on one of the ornate pillows. He nodded at me before walking off, as I fell into a deep sleep.



The next morning I woke up at Rays place, a half inflated blow-up mattress and musty smelling pillow keeping me afloat, and an old sleeping bag wrapped around me. The headache was gone and the wound on my neck was already healing, as was my fatigue and my appetite. It felt like I hadn‚Äôt eaten or drank in days. I leapt out of bed, ravenous for anything to shove down my gullet. Luck had it that Ray already thought ahead. He burst through the door to the guest room, fresh crispy bacon and eggs in tow. He threw it down on an old TV tray that was set up nearby.



‚ÄúOh man! You‚Äôre awake! I knew Mr. Rags was gonna get you all set, I knew it. Here, you‚Äôve gotta be starving yeah? We got some eggs and bacon, some toast and OJ man. Well, it‚Äôs not real OJ, it‚Äôs Sunny D but, you get it. I‚Äôm so stoked it all worked out. How was he? All ominous and stuff? That‚Äôs usually like him, but he‚Äôs really nice man. You get the thing out? You‚Äôll be sporting a cool little scar like this I bet! he said, gesturing to the back of his neck. Sure enough, there was a small scar, not more than an inch in size, exactly where Mr. Rags had cut me last night.



‚ÄúYeah man, it‚Äôs happened to a lot of us here. Depends on how you get here I think, but I know I‚Äôve got one, the Watersons and McDaniels have them, Dr. Rheem has it, they‚Äôre all over. But, we‚Äôre all good now thanks to Mr. Rags!‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat the hell happened? This is like something out of a book Ray, and it‚Äôs starting to freak me out. Can I use your phone when we're done?‚Äù I asked.



‚ÄúAh jeez, I mean yeah I would totally let you use mine, if I had one. Just no need out here, there‚Äôs no service you know? There‚Äôs phones in The Complex though, I‚Äôm sure you could use one there! Eat up though man, stuffs gettin‚Äô cold and I know you‚Äôre hungry!‚Äù



He was right, I was incredibly hungry and I couldn‚Äôt stay away from the smell anymore. I think I finished the meal in 3 minutes flat, polishing it off and finishing it with a nice cold glass of Sunny D, just like when I was a kid. I talked with Ray a bit more, helped him clean up the dishes and headed to The Complex.



‚ÄúHey man, just don‚Äôt do anything that would get Mr. Rags all angry okay? He‚Äôs a good guy, and the folks around here are real nice too. Just don‚Äôt want you gettin hurt is all!‚Äù he said with a dismissing wave as I walked down the street.



Walking towards it, I noticed that Mr. Rags was already outside, sitting on the steps of the Complex, talking to two suited men. He glanced my way, nodding in my direction, alerting the men in suits that I was headed that way. They seemed to exchange a few more words, then headed off in the opposite direction. They walked down the road in unison, steadfast and unwavering. As I made it to the steps, they were still walking towards‚Ä¶ nothing. Just down the road, left foot after the right. I turned to Mr. Rags who was looking at me with a slight smile.



‚ÄúGood to see you Zach, I trust you slept well? I know Rays arrangements may have not been the best but you were safe there. He‚Äôs a good guy, if a little‚Ä¶ simple,‚Äù he laughed.



‚ÄúYeah thanks, Ray‚Äôs been a life saver. What was that all about though? Those guys there, they‚Äôre just walking away now. Like.. there‚Äôs no discernible reason they should be walking that way. This is all getting way too weird for me. Is there any way I could just get a ride back to my car or.. into the next town? I don‚Äôt mean to be rude, I just feel like I‚Äôm going crazy.‚Äù



‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm sure I could arrange that, but your car isn‚Äôt in any shape to be driven, and the mechanic won‚Äôt be back this way for about a week. The next town doesn‚Äôt have any motels or hotels, and they‚Äôve not quite fond of visitors, so I‚Äôve heard. I have a proposition for you though. We‚Äôve recently lost our maintenance man, Jerry. Poor soul got caught up in one of the storms that pass by here every once in a while. I believe you have the same capabilities he possessed, correct?‚Äù he glanced up at me, an eyebrow raised.



‚ÄúY.. Yeah. I can probably do those kind of things. How did y..‚Äù he cut me off with a raised hand.



‚ÄúExcellent, excellent! Here‚Äôs my thought. I‚Äôll have the old chaps apartment cleaned up and renovated, post haste. It shouldn't take me but a day or two, and there won‚Äôt be a trace left of his existence. In the meantime, you can stay with Ray, possibly have him show you the ropes around here and get you acquainted with a few of our other residents. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll want to have you for one of his ‚Äòlegendary pizza parties‚Äô or whatever he calls them. While you stay here, you could look into a few mechanical disturbances we‚Äôve been having since Jerry‚Äôs departure, as a means of paying it forward. Does this seem like a mutually beneficial arrangement Zach?‚Äù



I mulled it over a moment. He was right, I wasn‚Äôt going to be getting anywhere fast in my car, as broken down as it was, and for all of the weird shit that‚Äôd happened to me in the past 24 hours, I was oddly intrigued by the entire event, if you can call it that. I still had so many questions I wanted answered, and it‚Äôs not like I had a real plans for my near future. Technically, I had made it out West. This could be a fresh start of sorts.



‚ÄúOf course, if you happen to appreciate your new abode, I‚Äôd be happy to hire you on staff, full-time, benefits and all. You could carve out yourself a new life here, a fresh start of sorts, yes?‚Äù I looked at him puzzled, like he had just read my mind.



‚ÄúYeah, alright Mr. Rags. I‚Äôll take you up on that offer. As long as the mechanic can be here within the week, I‚Äôll stick around and help out. It‚Äôs the least I could do really. I appreciate it, sir.‚Äù



‚ÄúSplendid, splendid! If you‚Äôd like, you can wash up in Jerry‚Äôs bathroom, apartment 6A. He was a clean man so I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs spotless,‚Äù he said, holding up a brass key, 6A etched onto the surface. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you tonight in the Complex dining hall for dinner tonight, 6:30 PM sharp. I believe the Stevensons are cooking up something special!‚Äù he licked his lips at the idea.



‚ÄúOkay, thank you Mr. Rags. Could we possibly talk this evening after dinner?‚Äù



‚ÄúAbsolutely, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve got quite the list of questions for me, and I‚Äôll do my best to answer them all. Have a good afternoon Zach, and welcome to The Complex.‚Äù He turned away and walked inside, the doors opening on their own accord to admit him.



So that was it. That‚Äôs how I made my way into the weirdest towns I‚Äôve ever been in. Officially, this town has no name. You won‚Äôt find it on any map that you can find, and you‚Äôre not likely to pass through it just driving down the road. I‚Äôm glad I decided to stay that day, it‚Äôs made for a plethora of insane, unbelievable and out of this world stories. Until next time, I‚Äôll tell you how a bit of the day went after accepting the offer. As Mr. Rags made his way inside, I followed him. We both rode in the elevator in silence, him clicking the buttons for our respective floors. The doors opened to the 6th floor, two side of the building each an apartment, 6A and 6B. He gestured to the door with a smile and I got off.



I walked over to it, hands shaking a bit as I went to unlock it. I got the key into the deadbolt, when the elevator dinged. I looked over as the doors opened to see an infant standing there. When I say infant, I mean something that looked maybe 3 or 4 months old, far too young to be standing. It was there, bow legged and looking confused, wobbling a bit as it looked around, its head bobbing a bit back and forth like it was too heavy. I muttered something along the lines of ‚Äúwhat the fuck?‚Äù in it‚Äôs direction. As soon as I did, it locked eyes with me, opening it‚Äôs mouth, almost unhinging it at the jaw sockets. The sound that came out of it‚Äôs bowels can only be described as a low, guttural rumble, like an alligator mating call. I nearly shit my pants, turning the deadbolt and door handle to get myself inside as fast as possible. The door popped open and I threw myself inside, kicking the door closed from the floor. I rushed up to my feet and relocked it. Heavily breathing and practically seeing stars, I waited for something to happen. As I backed away from the door, I heard the elevator ding again, the mayhem and low rumbles of the infant waning, as silence eventually took its place.

My supplements I take are BCAA, Electrolyte pills, MCT oil, a women‚Äôs multivitamin, sometimes Lipsomal Vitamen C, and my protein powders that I put in black coffee and water.

Right now I‚Äôm having a hard time eating enough calories and fat each day. I do hit my protein goal and keep my carbs at 20g or under daily (I count total carbs, not net carbs), but my fat and overall calories are usually low. I exercise at least 30 minutes to an hour every day on a split treadmill that keeps pressure off of my joints because I have holes all over my body left from the tumors that have been eradicated successfully with chemo and some radiation.

I just finished a 48-hour water fast recently, supplemented with electrolytes, cream of tartar for potassium, and magnesium pills. Surprisingly, the fast was easy for me, and I‚Äôve already gone through the re-feeding process.

I plan on fasting at least once a week for 24 hours and I hope to work up to longer fasts if I can figure out how to get this right. 

I want to make sure I‚Äôm doing this safely and effectively, especially given my health conditions. Does anyone have tips for eating enough fat and calories on keto when you just aren‚Äôt that hungry?

1lpkjpn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kefir/comments/1lpkjpn/my_recent_ferment_went_bad/,My recent ferment went bad?,Okay so I've been doing kefir for about a month now maybe a little over a month. I have been doing it with a double coffee filter with the open part of the Mason jar screwed on top of it for air. It's been coming out pretty thick and the last batch smelled exactly like sour cream and tasted like sour cream and had the consistency of sour cream. This most recent jar that I did I put a lid on it airtight. It's very thin and it smells like sour milk and not the good kind of sour milk. It smells like the milk has turned. Is this normal when you put an airtight lid instead of the filter on it? Because I'm scared to drink it and I'm thinking I should probably strain my grains and rinse them with fresh milk and just do it with the coffee filters like I have been. Also we recently got an air conditioner in the kitchen so the apartment is a lot cooler than it was. Could that also be the reason why it smells like sour milk this time? I'm kind of new to this so I'm not sure exactly what I'm doing I'm just going by what the pamphlet said for me to do. Thanks in advance for the help.,1,1751423495.0,Kefir,2,1.0,False

Right now I‚Äôm having a hard time eating enough calories and fat each day. I do hit my protein goal and keep my carbs at 20g or under daily (I count total carbs, not net carbs), but my fat and overall calories are usually low. I exercise at least 30 minutes to an hour every day on a split treadmill that keeps pressure off of my joints because I have holes all over my body left from the tumors that have been eradicated successfully with chemo and some radiation.

I just finished a 48-hour water fast recently, supplemented with electrolytes, cream of tartar for potassium, and magnesium pills. Surprisingly, the fast was easy for me, and I‚Äôve already gone through the re-feeding process.

I want to make sure I‚Äôm doing this safely and effectively, especially given my health conditions. Does anyone have tips for eating enough fat and calories on keto when you just aren‚Äôt that hungry?

I regret that so much. I don‚Äôt have Twitter or Facebook or any social media outside Reddit but please feel free to share. 

Ugh so long story short. Canyon group started making robes again. I was stoked. For Black Friday they had a 35% off deal. So I jumped at it and bought the infamous heart robe. They promised a 6 week turn around as the robes were made o order. After a hot minute they apologized and said the volume was higher than they projected and offered me $100 off. Which I came here to share and some poor soul took me up on it; I‚Äôm sorry it that was you. I meant well. Well it‚Äôs been 214 days since I‚Äôve ordered and I‚Äôve yet to get a robe. We‚Äôve emailed. They made excuses and apologies. But no change. As of 2-3 weeks ago we were promised it would come out in the next batch. I‚Äôve seen one person say they ordered their robe after me and receive it but still super late. I‚Äôm absolutely done. I‚Äôm a small business owner myself so I tried to be patient but this is just beyond. Do not order from this company. Just go to eBay. At least you will get the robe. Which is what I did for the fight club coffee mug robe. Got it brand new in the box is 5 days. I‚Äôm so sorry to those of you who might have seen my post and ordered. I meant well and had faith. If you ordered and have yet to receive your robe, please message me. I can and will make legal waves. I refuse to be ripped off for hundreds for a damn robe. 

Years ago I had a small company take forever to send me an item. But they showed me verifiable proof their warehouse and manufacturing facility literally burnt down. They also kept me up to date all on the deals and new companies they were trying to work with. This company might as well have told me every time they sneezed‚Ä¶.that‚Äôs how well their management did with communication.  Canyon group hasn‚Äôt done anything outside of two lame ass emails.
