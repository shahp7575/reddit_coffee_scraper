1q4kdkf,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1q4kdkf/i_started_planning_sober_hangs/,I started planning sober hangs,"Hey everyone, just wanted to share something that's been a total game-changer for me. For ages, I was kinda stuck in this rut... waiting for invites from friends and then every single one felt like it was gonna involve booze. Like, all my old hangouts were just bars or parties where everyone was getting wasted. It felt super isolating trying to stay dry, bc I couldn't really find anyone who just wanted to *do* stuff without alcohol being the main event. So I'd just sit around feeling pretty bummed, waiting for someone else to kick off a sober activity, which almost never happened. Then it hit me: I was treating my social life like it was something that just *happened* to me, not something I could actually control. So I flipped the script.

What I mean is, instead of just waiting, I'd actually block out time in my week specifically for social planning....kinda like meal planning. It was THAT stressful but also important to me. I'd brainstorm actual activities I wanted to do with friends like grabbing coffee, going for a hike, trying a new museum, even just a SOBER board game night. And then I'd actively reach out. I'd text old friends, try to connect with people from sober groups, even look for local interest groups. It's been wild how much easier it is to find awesome sober hangs when you're actually proactive about it. It kinda connects with that whole mindful drinking vibe, where you're just more mindful about everything you do, not just what's in your glass. Total shift in perspective, and honestly, it's made staying sober so much more fun.",1,1767615974.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False
1q4kctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1q4kctp/3_months_and_7_interviews_later_still_no/,"3 months and 7 interviews later, still no acceptance/rejection","Please bear with me for the long story but I felt it was important to show just how much I was put through.

I was an international student in the US who graduated in December 2024. I already knew being an international student made my job search that much harder but the process also made me realise how much people can take advantage of you and treat you with no respect. I had gone months without interviews or callbacks and was spending most of my time reaching out to alumni from my school who were also international students as I felt they would understand my position and be more open to a referral or even just some good advice.

A coffee chat with one alumni led to a series of weekly calls all through the month of August 2025 where they taught me more about their company and team. Eventually they mentioned their team was looking to expand and they would like to interview me for the role that they had yet to start recruiting for. (This is a dream situation right? Referral directly from the team manager before they even start interviewing other people?!)

I had 3 virtual interviews scheduled over 3 days with different members of the team that I thought went pretty well and I was told the feeling was mutual. They then wanted to continue the recruiting process formally so I was asked to come in to the office which was about 2 hours away from me, for a full day of more interviews and a case. (This was scheduled for 2 weeks after the virtual interviews so mid September. Also I was never given a role title, job description, salary range or any other such information so I assumed when I went on site I’d have a conversation with HR too.)

In order to get to the office, I had to rent a car and drive 2 hours out. I had 3 more in person interviews with different people on the team and an hour long case study to do after which I had another unplanned interview as well (this interview threw me off because of its nature and questions that didn’t really feel relevant to the role.)

 

I felt good about everything except the last unplanned interview and got some feedback about that a couple of days later. I connected with the individual that referred me and was criticised by them for how I performed in the unplanned interview and found myself justifying my responses. They seemed content with putting me on the spot one last time and mentioned that they were glad I could express these thoughts and would get back to me soon with an answer. 

Unfortunately for me, this happened to be the very same day that the new $100k per visa rule came out. Although there was a lot of chatter that the rule did not apply to students already in the US, the company decided to pause my application and mentioned they would be happy to consider me if any official communication stating that students are exempt from this rule came out. Until then, they were only looking to hire people who weren’t on any kind of visa. It was completely fair but really destroyed my chances. Two more weeks passed with no clarity on the rule and my visa time rapidly running out. I made the extremely difficult financial and emotional decision to leave the country that I worked so hard to come to. 

The day I was at the airport, new news came out that students were exempt from this rule. I immediately reached out to the person at the company and sent them official links explaining the situation and I was super excited because they clearly mentioned they’d love to take me in if the rule was clarified.

I did go home thinking it was only temporary and had radio silence for another week. I reached out again (last week of October) and was told “we’ve actually started officially hiring for the position and the team wanted to see if they could get someone who had more experience, but don’t worry the team still loved you and have a great impression of you. We’re planning to wrap up this hiring process quickly - by end of the year (not sure how 2 months is quick but okay) and if we don’t find a candidate that’s suitable we’d still love to have you!”

Obviously now the end of the year has passed, I’ve heard absolutely nothing from this company. I’ve run out of visa time and will not be able to return to the US. 

So just to summarise: this entire process started at the end of July and has yet to officially end and I have had 7 interviews and a case over the course of 2 months for an entry level role where I quote they “wanted someone with minimal experience so they could train them.”

I know that in the current market, entry level candidates like myself have the least power but I would think that just a little bit of respect or empathy wouldn’t be too much to expect. Guess I was wrong :)",1,1767615909.0,recruitinghell,0,1.0,False
1q4kcgq,https://i.redd.it/0tnyef4fuibg1.png,How A Creator Built Passive Income Selling AI-Generated Stock Videos,"Eight months ago, I was a struggling freelancer making $300/month from sporadic video gigs. A reality check came when a client paid $180 for 20 seconds of stock footage, more than I earned from 6 hours of editing work. That moment changed everything.

**The Beginning**  
I discovered AI video generation and decided to test it. My first creation was an 8-second coffee steam clip using Runway's free tier. Time invested: 20 minutes. Four weeks later, it sold for $8 on Shutterstock. That small win proved the concept was real.

**The Strategy**  
I committed to a simple daily routine:

* **Morning block (2 hours)**: Create 5-8 videos using AI tools
* **Monthly budget**: Just $55 for AI tools (Runway ML, Pika Labs, ChatGPT Plus)
* **Focus areas**: Business/office content, lifestyle, food, and nature

My approach was straightforward: simple concepts beat complexity. ""Person working on laptop in bright coffee shop"" sold better than artistic abstracts.

**The Reality**  
My monthly progression:

* Month 1: $23
* Month 2: $87
* Month 4: $456
* Month 6: $1,234
* Month 8: $2,823

**Current breakdown:**

* Shutterstock: $1,976 (70% of income)
* Adobe Stock: $564 (20%)
* Pond5: $283 (10%)
* Monthly expenses: $113
* **Net profit: $2,710**

**Key Lessons Learned**

**What worked:**

* Consistency over perfection, upload daily
* Simple, commercial content beats artistic
* Specific keywords matter more than generic tags
* Quality control: I reject 30% of what I generate

**Biggest mistakes:**

* Trying to be too creative (40% approval rate)
* Ignoring keyword strategy
* Uploading everything without filtering

**The Numbers**

After 8 months:

* 487 videos on Shutterstock (82% approval rate)
* 450-650 monthly downloads
* 30% of uploads generate zero sales (that's normal)
* Best sellers took 2-3 months to gain traction

**Key Takeaways**

✅ **Start small, think specific**: One quality video beats ten mediocre ones  
✅ **Patience pays**: Success took 4 months, not 4 weeks, stay consistent  
✅ **Commercial beats creative**: Stock buyers want usable content, not art  
✅ **Tools don't require big budgets**: $55/month in AI tools built a $2,800 income stream  
✅ **Rejection is normal**: Started at 60% approval, now at 82%  
✅ **Action over perfection**: Create your first video today, refine as you learn

  
This isn't get-rich-quick. It's a legitimate path to passive income using AI tools, creativity, and consistency. The opportunity exists because most people still don't know this is possible.

LOVE espresso, cappuccino.. brand new to trying this at home [Budget : $600-$700]","Greetings fellow espresso aficionados, huge espresso fan here.  Up until now, I've always gotten my espresso from either a Mom and Pop shop, or a corner Starbucks, if it's convenient.  I prefer supporting small businesses, especially those that know how to make good espresso and / or cappuccino.  This past Christmas, a friend of mine got himself a espresso grinder / brewer (all in one).  He's brewed me a few cups, and I've really enjoyed the coffee and conversation.  

Enough that I've decided to invest in a little espresso setup myself.  I have a list of the things that I have ordered, and I would greatly appreciate any advice or suggestions you folks might have.  I've done a little reading up here and there in the blogosphere of espresso , and I've come up with this potential little setup which I hope is a good starting point for me.  From grinder to bean, here's the list **\[Budget : $600-$700\]**

Grinder:  Turin SD40S single dose grinder

Espresso Machine:  Breville Bambino Espresso Machine BES450BSS.

Tamper:  Normcore V4 Coffee Tamper 53.3mm - Spring-loaded Tamper – Barista Espresso Tamper with 15lb / 25lb / 30lbs Replacement Springs

Scale:   TIMEMORE Black Mirror Nano (Black Mirror V2)

Starter Beans:  Death Wish Coffee - Whole bean espresso roast; Lavazza Super Crena Medium Roast

As I said earlier, advice and opinions would mean a great deal to me.  If there's anything I need to return, I haven't even unboxed the items yet, so no problem there.  Thank you guys so much in advance for the advice!  I look forward to becoming a regular here.

My original results were in 2023 getting from 75kg-64kg (165.4lbs-141.1lbs) and the way I did it was like this…

No sugar unless in fruits

At maximum 2000 calories in a day but aim for 1500-1800

No coloured drinks aside from coffee, tea and hydration drinks. Energy drinks are allowed but in fair moderation and as long as they aren’t coloured or contain sugar.

No saturated fats and stuff like that so no chocolate, no Pringles, no fried chicken, nothing like that

Go on walks, preferably a 30km walk atleast once a week. Even better if you aim for higher like 40-60km, during these walks you are allowed to treat yourself to one unhealthy snack like a roll of mentoes.

This diet does seem tough and when I first did it I remember how tough the first month was, however once I was done with it, I knew it was one of the best things I had ever done, and so  despite only being 5/59 days in I’m feeling very optimistic.

If I have an issue he’s always by my side, except I’ve noticed a pattern of not sticking up for me when I feel uncomfortable with his coworker. She takes advantage of him by using his second in line authority to get off early, come in late, etc. She doesn’t report to him directly, but his position and title has authority. She knows she can get away with things by reaching out to him versus her direct manager. 

Things I’ve gotten upset about that I’m curious is overreacting:
- Texting late at night about her arrival at work and being later than normal. Often times giving too much information as to why and this will be at 11 pm. Can’t it wait? 
- Their messages on their work platform have included winky emojis, their whereabouts, weekend plans, banter etc.
- There was recently a freeway shut down and she texted him asking how his drive home was. 
- Will bring him his favorite pastry and coffee just because. 
- Has our CC on file for work purchases even though we get reimbursed I don’t like that someone, especially her having that info. 
- Reached over text about something that anyone of significance in her life could’ve answered instead of him. She could’ve texted her family and gotten an answer but decided to go to home. 

All that to say, I’ve confronted him and he’s definitely changed his tone towards her but I’ve found things that still blur the lines. He says he’s tired of being monitored but I’m tired of monitoring, especially when I find things that blur the lines right after telling him and him agreeing it would not happen again. He also withholds telling me details about her that before me raising concerns he would share frequently. I also find on his search history interests that I know they’ve talked about or she’s shared and he’s actively looking into it. 

Even when I confront and we work through it, there is something I can’t shake.

My perception of others' emotions is an external data processing task, and my respect for this data is contingent upon its procedural logic; for instance, grief is a logical response to material loss, but its transition into a chronic state is a system efficiency failure that I cannot accept or respect. My social relationships are managed through a matrix of strict rules; a breach of any rule results in the **immediate and irreversible collapse** of that person's functional value in my world, even if it causes acute, real-time physiological pain. This pain, despite its intensity, lacks duration; it terminates with the physical event because my nervous system does not retain the emotional charge of the past due to my condition of **total Severely Deficient Autobiographical Memory (SDAM)**.

This malfunction in episodic memory explains the absence of long-term ambition or the inability to complete my novel; there is no cumulative value for meaning, and half-memories appear as foreign data detached from my personal identity. I exist in a **""continuous present,""** experiencing the day as an isolated, real-time act. My care for animals is a functional commitment as long as they are within my visual field, whereas their impact vanishes entirely upon the absence of their physical presence. What may appear to others as cruelty or coldness is actually a **""biological flexibility""** that respects the human entity as a category without becoming involved in empathy that transcends the moment.

The nightmare of this state lies in **""temporal blindness""**; every routine act, such as entering a coffee shop in Baghdad, is a technical challenge lacking the certainty derived from previous experiences. I understand the rules theoretically, but I lack the procedural ""memory of confidence"" that is usually recalled during the act of ordering, causing me to experience it as if for the first time. Conversely, this system grants me a **""superhuman"" ability** to constantly reprogram my traits and update my personality ""code"" to reduce stress, coupled with a high capacity to read external patterns with surgical precision, even though I remain susceptible to repeating procedural errors due to the absence of a narrative log of failure in my memory.",1,1767615417.0,SDAM,0,1.0,False

My family love him, we have had a great 3 years together and I hope that we can be together forever. We talk about marriage and kids. I'm so proud of the man he is and has become. 

That being said we have been together for 3 years and living together for 1 year, we are currently buying a house, and afterwards, plan to get married.  

He works like no tomorrow,12 hour days, 6 days a week usually, ( he's a builder )and on his days off he uses this time to do laundry, get a haircut, and come grocery shopping with me. He sometimes makes comments that because I'm not drowning in work like him, I have too much time to complain and stress about things I shouldn't be stressing about. 

  
An example of this would be the lack of sex we have, usually 4 times a month. I explain that would like to have it more, or perhaps dress up for him but that comes with rejection because he's too stressed or has to much to think about. And has made comets about me being an ""addict"" , my emotional needs are not being met therefore would enjoy for my sexual needs to be met. It seems like neither are a priority to him. When I do bring this up, he says "" we are buying a house that needs tones of work so I need to plan and work my ass off so that this can be done, I promise once this is done, we can go on holidays and enjoy ourselves"" I honestly feel like he's trying to sell me dreams. 

I've asked for quality time, he is busy, and when hes home, hes on the phone to his cousins, sister, friends and then doom scrolls. Ive explained what quality time looks like for me ( watching movies together, talking, going on a walk, going for coffee ) those kind of things but hes not made an effort to do them.

1q4k4p2,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/1q4k4p2/my_contractor_started_acting_like_my_house_had/,My contractor started acting like my house had “open access” during a remodel and I had to shut it down,"

I hired a contractor for a basic bathroom remodel in my house, replace the shower, fix some water damage, new tile, nothing fancy. He came recommended and the estimate meeting was normal. Once the job started though, he got weirdly entitled about my space. Day one he asked if his crew could use my kitchen table to lay out paperwork and measurements. I said okay, thinking it would be quick. Instead it turned into their default hangout spot with coffee cups, receipts, and tools spread out like it was their office. Then he started making little comments like I should keep a cooler of water available because “that’s what good clients do,” which rubbed me the wrong way. A few days in, I came home and found boxes of tile and bags of mortar stacked in my living room without anyone asking first. I told him I’m fine with materials being on site but I want them in the garage or the hallway, not blocking my only main space. He acted like I was being unreasonable and hit me with “remodels are messy, you have to be flexible.” Fine, but it kept escalating in small ways. He wanted to leave a key “for convenience” so the crew could let themselves in if I was at work. I said no, I’ll unlock when I’m home. He got annoyed and said I was slowing the schedule down. Later he told me they might start arriving around 6:30am to “get ahead of the day” and asked if they could just come in through the back door if I wasnt up yet. That was the moment I realized he didn’t see this as my house anymore, just a job site he could access whenever.

The last straw was about materials. I paid for extra tile and grout so we’d have enough if something cracked or a box had bad pieces. Toward the end he casually mentioned he was going to take any unopened extras because “that’s standard, contractors keep leftovers.” I told him absolutely not, I bought it, it stays with the house for future repairs. He argued with me like I was stealing from him, then tried to tack on a fee for “client interference” because I wouldn’t give him a key and wouldn’t let him store everything wherever he wanted. I ended up telling him to stop work until we had a clear written agreement about access hours, storage areas, and what happens with leftover materials. He acted offended, but honestly I wish I had set those boundaries on day one.

I moved to this charming country from Spain seven years ago. Since then, I’ve managed to study, land a job in the NHS, and I’m really happy—I even own my own home now. I live in Doncaster. My girlfriend is British; we met three years ago and I love her dearly.

I have Portuguese friends that I meet up with for coffee, and Romanian friends who have invited me over to their houses.

However, I only have one British friend: a 40-year-old guy who plays League of Legends. Sometimes I go over to his place to play LoL and we have a couple of beers.
As for the rest of the Brits I’ve met... nothing. Not once. They haven’t even invited me for a drink after work. I’m not sure if it’s just my personality, but nobody has ever said, 'Hey, do you fancy a drink?' or 'Want to grab a coffee?'

My girlfriend’s friends are exactly that—her friends. I hang out with them, but we don't really share the same interests. When the boyfriends come along and we all meet up, it’s fine, we’re just there as a group.
I don’t consider myself shy, nor do I find it hard to make friends—at least, I never did back in Spain, and I haven't had any issues with other foreigners here in the UK.
Am I being too intense? Or am I expecting to be invited out when that’s just not how things work in the UK?""",10,1767615121.0,AskABrit,22,1.0,False

1q4k2x7,https://i.redd.it/t25jom33vibg1.jpeg,First and probably final setup,"I have had this setup for a few months now. I can safely say that La Marzocco was the best decision for my home. I have seen a lot of posts lately asking whether to go with Mini or Micra. Honestly, if you have the space and budget, definitely Mini (reasons: BBW, timer, ability to pull multiple milk shots in a row when hosting). I have low cabinet clearance and Mini would be too big. Micra’s build quality is great, it can easily pull 6-8 espresso shots in succession without quality drop (I’ve tried that when making multiple espresso martinis lol) and, well, it looks beautiful. If you love light roasts though I would not even think of it unless you can easily plumb in for pre-infusion. Even then I’d pick  something with flow control. I will definitely plumb-in if at one point I decide to renovate the kitchen but I love my medium and dark roasts, and the machine does beautiful with those. Who knows, maybe I’ll master lighter roasts eventually too on it but I suspect it would be easier to dial those in with flow control and pre-infusion.

Zerno Z1 is growing on me but I am not as happy with it as I expected to be. The static is insane, you HAVE to RDT otherwise grounds spray everywhere. There’s definitely a degree of retention and I have to tap the top of the grinder pretty strongly to make sure all grounds have been ground and all the coffee ends where it’s supposed to. The clearance under the chute is too low for grinding directly into the portafilter. I got their PF holder and it sucks lol. ESP since with the amount of static you need to put the funnel on and it becomes extremely annoying to get the PF out. I switched to the Weber blind shaker (I hate to say it but it is better than the MHW bomber one) and it works well though the magnetic base really argues with the magnetic base of the shaker. Putting a silicone mat under has helped but it’s not perfect. 

Obviously the quality is great, the coffee is delicious (Mazzer burrs for dark roasts, SSP HU for medium), and it is small which is one of the main reason I picked it over the new Lagom grinder. Sometimes I even wonder if I should have gone with a GBW grinder like Eureka or Fiorenzato but I’m going to give this a full year before making any changes to my finally mastered workflow haha.

Everyone looked at me, then at each other, then back at their phones. Nobody acknowledged the call or walked towards me, so I placed the takeaway cups on the bench and turned back around to grab the next ticket from the square printer.

Next I began making a large soy latte and while I was frothing the little orange coloured jug half filled with creamy soy milk, I looked out the window again to see if Carol was approaching for her drinks.

She was not. Nobody was.

I called out her name again, this time with more urgency and a hint of impatience.

Same blank faces looked around then back to their phones.

This is the point where I become irrationally annoyed. Not because she hasn't arrived, but because of my aversion to repeating myself more than twice.

So I call out once more.... CAROL, ORDER FOR CAROL

Then a confused looking teenage boy takes 2 steps towards the window and asks in a shy German accent ""ist das mine?""

I blurt out the 2 drinks are for Carol, flat whites

He asks if that is his hot chocolate 

I ask if he is Carol.

He says ""gunther""

Then for some stupid reason I tell him, in front of many waiting customers, that ""Carol is a womans name""

He looks confused and goes to grab one of the drinks. Not both. Just one.

By the look on my face, he realises that this was a wrong move on his part.

At the same moment, the jug of soy milk being frothed boils over and onto my hand.

The perfect storm has just aligned. 

Not only have I become triggered, I feel the burning pain of 70 degree soy bean fluids that are also spilling over the counter and floor.

I place the jug down on the bench without turning off the wand. So steam then scalds my forearm.

Houston, we have a problem! 

I turn back around to unleash my fury onto the gormless looking German boy and with a raised voice I ask him ""what is your order, what did you order""

He looks both stunned and afraid, like a deer in the headlights.

It is clear he doesn't understand what I've asked.

I repeat it again, louder.

Now he appears terrified and embarrassed.

I become cognizant at this point that there is something on his head. Some kind of device on his ear.

TL;DR: he was wearing hearing aides. The poor kid was literally deaf. I just raised my voice and got angry because he couldn't hear me. I'm such a bad person!",0,1767614825.0,tifu,2,0.4,False

1q4jzac,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleep_Problems/comments/1q4jzac/shift_work_is_brutal_here_is_a_biohackers/,"Shift Work is brutal. Here is a biohacker’s protocol to minimize the damage (Light, Caffeine, and ""Anchoring"").","Hey everyone, Alex here.

I usually write about curing insomnia, but the mechanism behind Shift Work Sleep Disorder is the same, just extreme: your internal clock is at war with the sun.

If you work nights or rotate shifts, you aren't just ""tired""—you are functioning in a state of permanent jet lag. While we can't fully trick millions of years of evolution (we are diurnal creatures), we can use biology to make it bearable and protect your long-term health.

Here is the ""Survival Protocol"" I put together based on the latest circadian science (2025/2026):

1. The Commute is Critical (Dark Therapy) 🕶️

Light is your brain's ""Wake Up"" signal. If you drive home at 7:00 AM in full sunlight, you just dosed yourself with cortisol right before bed.

 The Fix: Wear dark, wrap-around sunglasses (or blue blockers) on your drive home. Your bedroom must be a tomb. 0 Lux. Foil on windows if you have to.

2. Caffeine Half-Life Logic ☕

You might feel like you need coffee at 4:00 AM to survive the shift, but if you plan to sleep at 8:00 AM, that caffeine is still blocking your adenosine receptors.

The Fix: Strict cutoff 8 hours before your intended sleep time. Switch to cold water or light movement for alertness.

3. ""Anchor Sleep"" for Rotating Shifts ⚓

If your schedule flips constantly, try to keep 4 hours of sleep overlap every single 24-hour cycle (e.g., 04:00 AM to 08:00 AM). This ""Anchor"" keeps your circadian rhythm from completely free-running into chaos.

We’re now looking for **early users who are willing to test it and give honest feedback**.

The platform explores a different way of connecting people. Instead of profiles, feeds, or swiping, everything revolves around **queries** — short posts where users clearly state what they want to do or what they’re looking for.

Examples:

* “Anyone up for a coffee or walk?”
* “Looking for a tennis partner”
* “Offering / looking for paid services or work”
* “Searching for or offering accommodation”
* “Travel buddies or local meetups”
* Romantic or non-romantic connections

The core idea is **intent over performance**: connections based on what people want to do, not how they present themselves.

* where do you hesitate or get confused?
* what feels unnecessary, missing, or unclear?
* which possible fixes would you propose?
* does this actually solve a real problem, or not?

Trust and safety are central to the project:

* identity verification
* no bots or fake accounts
* basic moderation and security checks
* designed to feel calm and respectful

This isn’t monetization-driven — it’s a learning project built voluntarily and out of passion and love for people and genuine connections, and feedback matters more to us than growth at this stage.

Even yelling at white employees but no actions against African American employees for blatant company violations.

I (33M) have been working for this company for 7yrs. Just a shipping warehouse, moving pallets, loading trucks, stacking boxes and what not. The nightshift crew i work with consists of 7 people and 1 supervisor. 3 coworkers who are noticeably lazy, examples being extended breaks and lunches, not doing extra tasks or assignments, disappearing for 30 plus minutes at a time. The other 4 of us seem to do everything. The supervisor only will seek us out for extra tasks and work. I myself am already filling at least 3 different roles. When us four have questioned the supervisor about why the 3 employees do not have to do extra tasks, his response is always thing like ""I can't tell anyone to do anything. I don't think that's their responsibility, they did this task by themselves (even though it was the bare minimum of their job)"" just excuse after excuse. Last night really hit a tipping point.

The end of the week, we clean the warehouse. Now the 3 frequently will do little to nothing. The worst of the 3, spent 30 minutes in the office b.s.ing around with the supervisor about football making coffee while the rest of us were working. The supervisor comes out and want everyone to machine wrap pallets for a load. A few of us recognize this is a wild waste of time. We have 1 wrapping machine. So at anytime at least 3 or 4 people are waiting around doing nothing. 

1 of the guys who is a hard worker decided to help me start cleaning so we can get done. The coworker that hung out in the office started yelling and complaining that he wasn't helping wrap pallets. He goes to the supervisor and the supervisor immediately and almost literally runs out to the floor and starts yelling at the guy helping me clean. The guy is very calm and tried to explain that there were to many people on that task and this was just a better use of time. Supervisor got louder saying how he runs the floor, what he says goes (contradicting earlier statements). The guy calmly said that he is just doing part of his job and that it's not like he's goofing off in the office. Supervisor gets even madder and lies saying no one has been in the office. The supervisor stormed off yelling about how he's going to the manager on Tuesday. 

Now. It does happen that the 3 guys who do nothing or very little are African American and us 4 are the 3 white and a Middle Eastern man. The occurrences are an everyday thing and we all agree more or less that the supervisor who is white, is showing favoritism to the African American guys.

I have my psych appointment tomorrow. It is my first one in six months.

I am in Australia and in my early 30s. I was prescribed Fluoxetine 10 mg in June to take with my Vyvanse as a booster. I did not tolerate it well. I tried it for about three boxes and hated it. My anxiety became worse and I felt nauseous every second day. I currently take Vyvanse 40 mg, which works reasonably well but tends to wear off by mid afternoon, especially around PMDD time.

In early October last year, my grandfather passed away and within the same week my father was hospitalised for four weeks. During that time, I forgot to take the Fluoxetine (but kept taking Vyvanse) as I was very busy caring for my dad. Surprisingly, I managed okay by moving my coffee to the afternoon as a small booster and exercising more to create some me time. 

I am not sure how best to ask about an afternoon booster that is not an antidepressant. It feels like a strange question and it is the first time I have felt stuck on how to approach this.

I also have a V60, Aeropress and a 1ZPresso J-Ultra, but I usually keep this in my coffee travel kit at my office. The J-Ultra is a really fantastic grinder. I’d never usually conical burrs before and now I am a conical convert, having recently added the Pico at home. 

I don’t miss the Atom at all, even though it was a fantastic grinder. The retention was a lot compared to the Pico, it was loud (although quiet compared to my old Rocky) and very annoying to switch from espresso from pour over and back again, to the extent that I simply did not do this. 

I don’t really know why I’m sharing this here. I guess I just want attention. But if you have specific questions about these products let me know. There is, unfortunately, not a lot of information about the Pico out there. ",1,1767613971.0,espresso,0,0.67,False
1q4jpkt,https://i.redd.it/js9b2a58ribg1.png,Upgrading from instant coffee after years — is this a good start? ☕️,"For basically my whole life, I’ve only been drinking **instant coffee** (mostly Nescafé).  
Usually **black coffee**, sometimes **cappuccino**.

Now I finally want to **upgrade my coffee game** and start drinking *real* coffee.

I’m thinking of buying:

* **AGARO Classic Moka Pot (240 ml)**
* **Blue Tokai Vienna Roast (dark roast, ground coffee)**

This feels like a big step for me since I’ve never used anything other than instant coffee before.

My questions:

* Is a **moka pot** a good choice for someone coming from instant coffee?
* Is **Blue Tokai Vienna Roast** a good first coffee, or should I try something else?
* Any beginner mistakes I should avoid?
* Should I change the grind/roast, or this is fine to start?

Would really appreciate suggestions from people who made a similar switch 🙏

1q4jpft,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKMounjaro/comments/1q4jpft/woe_is_me_or_am_i_just_stupid/,Woe is me or am I just stupid!!!,"A little tale - I started in March 2024 at 18st 3lbs with BMI 47. MJ really was magic for me within an hour after starting. No more food noise, total satiety and pretty steady weight loss. I also abstained from alcohol as recommended to reduce chances of pancreatitis. (I'd been teetering on the brink of alcohol dependency up to that point.)

By Sept 2025 I'd lost 7.5 stone of my 8 stone target, BMI in the overweight category and finally fit into size 14 clothes woohoo. And so much more active feeling good, bar the dry skin and balding head lol. MJ was the answer to all those wasted years of struggling with my weight since being a toddler! All good so far?

But...of course as someone who has self-sabotoged all my life even magical miracle MJ wasn't enough to stop me doing it again!  I got complacent, I missed the social element of having a drink, I was dealing with stress, blah blah blah. The new slim me deserved a bit of fun.  So as well as not logging macros and cals (worked for me) from April 2025, then later in the year I started risking an odd glass of wine. But still kept my weight below 11 stone, happy days, 15mg MJ was still working phew. 

So perhaps a few more glasses of wine. A few more biscuits, bits of cake, CRISPS argh.Well no surprises my weight crept up a bit and then December arrived. Boom, complete pre/festive food and drink overload. I'd actually already planned a few weeks break from MJ early December when I was due to socialise a bit more. First time I'd done this on my journey and had never thought it was a good idea, so should listen to my own advice!!! 

Well mid December I had a night out, great food drink and then rounded of the evening at home making some espresso vodka martinis. (Espresso coffee, vodka and kahlua - delish.) OMG, next day though I had so much pain ULQ, took a few days to subside but not so bad that I thought it was too serious. No A&E, manageable at home. I was initially diagnosed with gastritis by our nurse practitioner and am still on the prescribed Omeprazole.

However having recently chatted to my new GP he's concerned I have a few red flags for liver/biliary/pancreatic involvement. (I have some other health issues such as bile malabsorption.) So I'm waiting on some bloods and then looking at having an MRCP MRI of those bits of my poor old body.

In the meantime time I have been told to:
- Stop alcohol completely — no “a few glasses”
- Avoid high-fat meals
- Avoid caffeine
- Keep hydrated
- Continue Omeprazole for 2 more weeks
- Stop using Questran 
- Stop using peptobismol 
- No further rapid weight loss (haha)
- Not restart Mounjaro until properly assessed, and then under strict medical guidance

I've joined a load of pancreatitis/gastritis groups on FB and scared myself senseless on Dr Google. Got some books ordered at the library too. 

I am determined to get sorted in 2026 once and for all. I feel like a cat with not many lives left!! But this is a really serious wake up call. I might get lucky one more time, but I might not. My continued weight loss journey without MJ is a toughie but if I did this to myself then I am definitely an idiot of the highest order! I'm not here for sympathy btw and I'm sure you don't have any either lol.

I'll keep you posted in a few weeks time once the NHS can hopefully squeeze me in. Idiots should be at the back of the queue eh?!

But I'll still be modding and looking forward to more good stuff on the sub.

So if you know me or follow me, you know that every year for the last twelve years, I start off the first week of the new year doing a fast with my church.

We only eat fruits and vegetables for a week. Nothing else, no sugar, no coffee, no soda, nothing but fruits and vegetables and water. Now I always go further even if no one else does in church. I don't watch TV. I don't do any social media except for posting my blog which for that week is about God and the lessons I am learning. 
I don't listen to secular music, I only read the bible and I go to church every night. Now that may sound radical to some people and hey, I'm not asking you to do it. This is my gift to God. I do this to thank him for all he's done in the previous year. I am also giving thanks in advance for what he is about to do in this coming year. This is not a lot to ask of myself after all he's done and continues to do in my life. 

I am giving him this first week to be one with him. To give all my time to him fully,  and not to be distracted with this crazy world. This clears my mind, my body and my soul for the upcoming year. This kickstarts the new year with the right mindset. That it's all about him, that he is first and that he is important enough to give up what I love for this first week.

I am living proof of all he's done in my life. Don't believe me, then read my book The Blessing in Disguise Revealed and you too won't believe what he has done. I am a living testimony of what can happen if you believe.

So today my friends, as we are all making our new years resolutions, we need to take the time out to give thanks for our blessings. To honor whoever we believe in and to start off this new year right.

Ghost stories are a pivotal part of American culture from movies to books and video games. They are also a huge part of our personal lives. How often do we see that pile of laundry at the end of your bed and think it's some kind of ghost or demon? Growing up I'd always turn the hallway light at the end of the night and race down the hallway to get to my room before the evil spirit caught me. I can remember hanging out with friends and swapping stories of shadowy men in trench coats, hunting skin walkers, and I shit you not elves. That's what I'm here to do. To share mostly ghost stories (hence the title of the story). I mostly want to share my own and some details like names and specific locations will probably be changed for obvious reasons but with all that being said lets get into our first story.

So when I was about 13 years old my family moved for the first time. I can remember we went from living in a rental house in the middle of town to living in a trailer park in the mountains. Safe to say it was a little bit of an adjustment but with that being said those were some of the best days of my life my little brother and I were homeschooled at the time and when we were done we'd go out and explore the trailer park and then go to the pool which since it was connected to a hot spring we could go all year long. There was a big gravel hill that had a trail on it that led to a sort of DIY dirt bike trail. We'd go out and walk and see what we could find which was usually not much other than the occasional deer and coyote. This one time I was at the trailer finishing my chores when my little brother came to the trailer freaking out because he saw a dead deer carcass. We had read about an invasive species of wolves that were eating cattle in different parts of Idaho so he was worried that there was possibly a pack of wolves nearby. My parents assured him it was probably just coyotes and there was nothing to worry about. I wanted to see said deer carcass for myself so as soon as I was done with my chores I went up the trail and followed the directions my brother gave me. I never saw the deer my fault for trusting the directions of a ""traumatized"" nine year old but as I was wondering around I did see what looked to be a man in a Canadian Tuxedo walking in a very small cicle around near the end of the bike trail just mumbling something I'm not sure what. It freaked me out though so I just started running down the hill. Looking back it was probably just some drunk or maybe even a crackhead this is southern Idaho so neither are all that uncommon. That being said it was weird and really creeped me out as a kid so I thought I'd include it here. One thing that was weird is that when I went back the next day I didn't see any footprints anywhere.

Not sure if this is really a ghost story but it is weird (I swear I'll get to an actual legitimate ghost story.) We used to have this cat named Francis who as you can imagine was quite an explorer. We had a little window on the side of trailer he'd jump on just enough to where he'd hang on the window sill and peak through the window; this is how he'd let us know he wanted back in he also had a very unique meow like some cats that he would do if he saw another cat or a bird or really just another animal. One day Francis went missing. My Mom was at home with us and my Dad was at work. My brother and I went out multiple times looking for the cat. We never found him, when my dad came home he explained that someone had hit him and Dad found him on the side of the road. He went out to bury him that night and I remember crying and the next morning I woke up and waited to hear the sound of him scratching on the door but it never came. The weird part to me is that the day prior we had come in to eat and I heard that scratch but he wasn't there, we then heard that unique meow and went to see if we could find him. We heard it multiple times before Dad got home but never saw Francis to this day I can't really explain it.

Ok now for the ghost story whenever I was alone in the trailer I always felt uneasy like I wasn't really alone and for that reason whenever my parents weren't there my brother and I would go to the owners of the trailer park and see if we could play with their kids I was so desperate to get out of that trailer I'd go play with the mormon kids my brother would do it out of boredom he never really believed the ghost stuff. Sometimes at night I would hear footsteps all around the camper mixed with the sounds of coyotes. The camp spots were covered in gravel so each step made a distinct sound and I could hear as it slowly went to one end of the camper go around then got louder as it went by where I slept. It would always go away by the time my Dad woke up to get ready for work. I would tell him about it and he'd go out and explain that there was no one there. When winter came I thought I'd finally be able to prove that the footsteps that robbed me of my sleep were real, I remember it was very snowy that winter but would usually melt by the morning which did'nt leave behind a whole lot of evidence but one night it was snowing and my Dad said,

""It's looking like the snow's gonna stick. That'll be a bitch to drive in the morning."" To be honest my Pop's problem meant nothing to me cause it meant that I'd had the proof I was looking for night came and so did the footprints but instead of being scared all I could think was I got you this time. Morning came and I was up. My dad came out to watch TV with me like he always did before work since I was usually awake while my brother slept like a rock.

""Morning kid."" He said with a cup of coffee in his hand. ""I heard them again!"" I blurted out ""Last night someone was walking all around the camper I swear!"" My dad sighed and said ""If someone was there they would've left footprints in the snow. Stay inside and I'll look."" He goes out for a couple minutes and comes back in.

""There's nothing there."" I could not believe what I was hearing. ""What... are you sure I heard them Dad.""

""That's just your mind playing tricks on you. Now go get dressed and get ready for whatever assignments your mom has for you.""

I went out later that day to look around and he was right there was not a single footstep.

Child abuse upsets me and I prefer not to see it in my reels, so I clicked on the triple dots and selected “Not Interested”. This was, apparently, a huge mistake because it was not long before I saw another anti-vax reel and another and another and another and another. Each time I clicked “Not Interested”. Then I saw an anti-LGBT reel. I am a member of the LGBT community, so naturally I clicked “Not Interested”. Guess what happened. That’s right, more of the content I actually wanted to see started  getting replaced with anti-LGBT content, but not the anti-vax stuff, obviously.  Next came a reel featuring evangelical christian batshittery. As someone who was raised evangelical and barely made it out alive I have no desire to see that content, so I clicked “Not Interested”, telling myself that if I just kept telling it that I was not interested it would eventually stop showing me the content I’m telling it that I’m not interested in. Then general far right culture war propaganda reels started coming in and I once again told facebook that I was not interested. It doesn’t affect anything. I saw a reel from a coffee shop selling Charlie Kirk merch. Clicked “Not Interested”, scrolled past one more reel and was immediately presented by a different reel from the same company, showing off the same merch.

From what I can tell the “Not Interested” button seems to be functioning in the exact opposite manner that’s it is supposed to, at least for me. In the matter of maybe half an hour my reels went from mainly sketch comedy and animal videos to an unending torrent of hatful, fear-mongering, politically charged content which seems to be explicitly targeting aspects of my identity and I really just want to know why.

1q4jj5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1q4jj5p/my_winter_break_part_1/,My Winter Break part 1,"CHAPTER ONE 
Arrival
I always imagined winter break would feel cinematic; soft snow, cozy sweaters, maybe a tasty mug of cocoa held with both hands like I was in a holiday commercial. And honestly? When I stepped out of the car in my faux‑fur coat and rhinestone earmuffs, the snow falling in perfect little flakes around me, it did feel cinematic.

If you ignored Rowan.

“Are you done posing?” he asked, slamming the trunk like it owed him money.

“I wasn’t posing,” I said, which was a lie. “I was appreciating the moment.”

He rolled his eyes so hard I thought they might pop out of his face. “Right.”

Classic Rowan. Always ready with a comment, always allergic to joy. But this trip was supposed to be different. A chance to reconnect, according to my mother, which meant she was tired of us “bickering” and wanted to outsource the problem to a cabin in the woods.

The cabin itself was cute in a rustic, “I hope the Wi‑Fi works” kind of way. Wooden beams, a porch dusted with snow, warm yellow light glowing through the windows. It looked like the kind of place influencers rented for aesthetic content, which I appreciated. If I was going to be emotionally tortured by my cousin for a week, at least the backdrop was nice.

Inside, the air smelled like pine and cinnamon. I immediately claimed the bigger bedroom.

“Obviously,” Rowan muttered.

“Obviously,” I echoed, tossing my bags onto the quilted bedspread. If he wanted the bigger room, he should’ve walked faster. Or been nicer. Or both.

For a few hours, things were almost… pleasant. We made cocoa. We played a board game. Rowan even laughed once, which felt like spotting a rare animal in the wild.

I let myself believe this trip might actually work.

Then the knocking started.

A soft, deliberate tap‑tap‑tap on the far wall.

I froze. “Did you hear that?”

Rowan didn’t look up from his phone. “Hear what?”

Tap‑tap‑tap.

“That.”

He shrugged. “Old cabin. Relax.”

Relax. Sure. Because nothing says “relax” like unexplained knocking in a remote forest.

But I let it go. I was determined to be normal. Calm. Unbothered. I wasn’t going to let a little noise ruin my perfect winter aesthetic.

Not yet.

The next morning, I woke to the smell of coffee and the sound of Rowan humming, which was suspicious on its own. He was standing at the stove, wearing the same hoodie he’d worn for three days straight, stirring a pot like he was auditioning for a cooking show he didn’t want to be on.

“Morning,” I said, rubbing my eyes.

“You look like a raccoon,” he said.

“Thank you,” I replied sweetly. “I try.”

We ate breakfast. A sloppy plate of eggs and corned beef hash, fresh from the can! We joked. We planned a hike later in the day. For a moment, I felt something I hadn’t felt in years: hope. Maybe we could fix things. Maybe we weren’t doomed to be the family’s favorite feud forever.

I got ready for our hike after breakfast. Pink boots, pink backpack, pink bear mace. Fashionable AND practical. Because of the snow we didn’t go too far but just enough to see the beautiful view from the cliff. The sun glowing off of the crystalized lake below. The trees painted with sheets of white snow. A few snide comments from Rowan, but nothing as bad as the usual torment he put me through. 

Growing up, Rowan always treated me cruelly. Whenever I’d tell on him or whenever any of our parents even saw what he put me through, it’d always be the same response… “Boys will be boys”. I hated that statement. It was just a way to excuse them being horrible. Once we got older he learned how to do more harm psychologically and emotionally so it wouldn’t be as noticeable. The worst part was, that, he was good at it. He knew what to say to really get under my skin like a parasite. My mother forced me to go on this trip hoping we could make amends. I’m hoping so, but I don’t have much left. 

That night, the knocking returned.

Tap‑tap‑tap.
Pause.
Tap.

I sat up in bed. “Rowan?”

No answer.

I stepped into the hallway. The cabin was silent except for the wind outside.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

This time, it came from the living room wall.

“Hello?” I whispered.

The knocking stopped.

I didn’t sleep the rest of the night.

Over the next two days, the cabin grew stranger.

A mug I left on the counter appeared on the floor.
A window I closed was suddenly open.
My reflection in the bathroom mirror seemed… delayed, just for a heartbeat.

I told Rowan.

He laughed. “You’re being dramatic.”

The words hit me like a slap. He’d said them my whole life. Whenever I cried, whenever I stood up for myself, whenever I tried to explain how his teasing actually hurt.

“You always make things up,” he added. “It’s exhausting.”

I swallowed the sting. “I’m not making anything up.”

“Sure,” he said, already walking away.

I hated how easily he could make me doubt myself.

That night, I dreamed of someone standing at the foot of my bed. When I woke, my bedroom door was open.

I was sure I’d closed it.

On the fourth night, I woke to a whisper.

“Lila…”

My eyes snapped open. The room was dark, the air cold.

“Rowan?” I whispered.

No answer.

I stepped into the hallway. The whisper came again; soft, coaxing, almost familiar.

“Lila…”

It drifted from the living room.

I followed it, heart pounding.

“Who’s there?”

Silence.

Then a shadow moved behind me.

I screamed.

Rowan burst out of his room. “What is wrong with you?!”

“There was - I heard - someone was here!”

He stared at me with a mix of annoyance and something else. Something like fear.

“You need to calm down,” he said. “Seriously.”

But I couldn’t. Not anymore.

The next morning, Rowan confronted me.

“You were in my room last night,” he said. “Standing over me.”

“What? No, I wasn’t!”

“I woke up and you were just… staring.”

My stomach dropped. “I don’t remember that.”

“Sure.” he said coldly. 

I went back to my room to try and relax and settle my confused and scared mind.

The day spiraled.

I kept losing time.
I’d blink and find myself in a different room.
I’d hear whispers that stopped when I turned my head.
I felt watched, even when I was alone.

By evening, the knocking had become pounding.

Rowan snapped. “I’m done. I’m leaving.”

“You can’t!” I cried. “The roads are iced over!”

“I don’t care. I’m not staying here with you like this.”

He shoved past me toward the door.

And then everything blurred.

A shout.
A slip.
A crash.
Snow swirling in the open doorway.
Silence.

When I came back to myself, Rowan was lying motionless outside, half‑buried in snow.

My breath fogged in the air.

“Oh,” I whispered. “Oh no.”

But even as I said it, something inside me felt… quiet. Peaceful.

Like the knocking had finally stopped.

CHAPTER TWO 
Aftermath
I didn’t cry right away.

People expect you to cry when something terrible happens, especially something “tragic,” which is the word everyone kept using, like they were all reading from the same script. But when I stood there in the snow, staring at Rowan’s still body, the cold biting through my coat, I didn’t feel anything.

Not shock.
Not horror.
Not grief.

Just… quiet.

Like someone had finally turned off a noise I didn’t realize had been blaring in the background.

But I knew how I was supposed to react, so I did. I screamed. I ran to him. I called for help with a trembling voice. I let the panic rise in my throat like a well‑rehearsed monologue.

And everyone believed me.

Why wouldn’t they? I’d always been good at performing.

The next few days blurred together; police questions, medical examiners, my mother’s frantic phone calls, Rowan’s mother’s sobbing. I floated through it all like I was underwater, watching the world move around me in slow motion.

I kept waiting for someone to look at me differently. To tilt their head and say, “Something’s off.”
But no one did.

They all saw what they wanted to see: a grieving cousin who had witnessed a terrible accident.

I didn’t correct them.

The funeral was small and cold, the kind of cold that seeped into your bones and made you feel hollow. I wore a black coat with a cinched waist and a tasteful veil. Understated, elegant, appropriately somber. People whispered that I looked “so composed,” which was apparently a compliment.

Rowan’s mother hugged me so tightly I could barely breathe. “He loved you, you know,” she said into my shoulder.

I nodded, because that was what she needed. But the truth was more complicated. Rowan loved me the way a cat loves a laser pointer… fascinated, annoyed, and always ready to pounce.

When the service ended, I stood by the car while my mother talked to relatives. Snowflakes landed on my gloves, melting instantly.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

I froze.

It wasn’t real. It couldn’t be real. It was just the memory of the cabin, the echo of a sound that had followed me for days. I told myself that. I repeated it like a mantra.

But the tapping didn’t stop until I got in the car and shut the door.

Back home, everything felt too loud. The heater hummed. The refrigerator clicked. The house settled with little pops and creaks. Normal sounds, everyday sounds, but they all felt amplified, like the volume had been turned up without my permission.

My mother hovered constantly, offering tea, blankets, emotional support, and unsolicited advice. “You need rest,” she said. “You’ve been through so much.”

I nodded and smiled and let her fuss over me, because it was easier than explaining that I didn’t feel tired. I didn’t feel anything.

Not really.

At night, I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, waiting for sleep that never came. The house was quiet. My thoughts were not.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

I sat up, heart pounding.

It wasn’t the walls.
It wasn’t the floor.
It wasn’t the wind.

It was inside my head. A memory, a rhythm, a pulse.

I pressed my palms to my temples. “Stop.”

The tapping stopped.

I lay back down, staring at the ceiling until morning.

A week after the funeral, my family insisted on a “healing dinner.” I didn’t want to go, but refusing would’ve caused more drama than attending, and I was too tired to deal with that.

The dining room was warm and bright, filled with the smell of roasted vegetables and the sound of forced cheer. My relatives talked in soft, sympathetic voices, like I was a fragile ornament that might shatter if someone spoke too loudly.

“How are you holding up, dear?” my aunt asked.

“You must be traumatized,” my uncle added.

My mother squeezed my hand. “She’s strong. She always has been.”

Rowan’s mother sat silently at the end of the table, eyes red, staring at her plate. I avoided looking at her for too long. Something about her grief felt too heavy, too real, too close.

I focused on my food instead, cutting my chicken into perfect little pieces.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

My fork hit the plate.

My mother looked up. “Sweetheart?”

I smiled. “Just thinking.”

After dinner, I slipped away to the bathroom and locked the door. I stared at my reflection in the mirror; flawless makeup, smooth hair, calm expression. I looked like someone who had everything under control.

But my eyes… my eyes looked tired. Not physically tired, but emotionally drained, like I’d been holding something heavy for too long.

I leaned closer to the mirror.

“Are you okay?” I whispered.

My reflection didn’t answer, obviously. But for a moment,  just a moment, it felt like she was studying me. Like she was waiting for me to admit something.

I turned away.

That night, I couldn’t sleep again. I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, listening to the quiet hum of the house.

“You did what you had to,” a voice whispered.

I sat up, breath catching in my throat.

It wasn’t a ghost.
It wasn’t Rowan.
It wasn’t anything supernatural.

It was me.

A part of me I had never let speak before. A part that had been silenced by years of being told I was dramatic, too sensitive, too much.

A part that had finally snapped free in the snow.

“You don’t have to let them hurt you anymore,” the voice said.

I exhaled slowly. “I know.”

I wasn’t afraid of the voice.

I wasn’t fighting it.
I was listening.

And that was the part that scared me… or should have scared me.

But it didn’t.

Not at all.

CHAPTER THREE 
The House I Grew Up In
I didn’t plan on staying at my parents’ house for more than a few days, but somehow a few days turned into a week, and then two. My mother insisted it was “for the best,” which was her favorite phrase whenever she wanted me to do something I didn’t want to do.

“It’s just until you’re feeling more stable,” she said, smoothing my hair like I was a child. “You’ve been through so much.”

I didn’t argue. Arguing never worked in this house. It was like trying to shout into a snowstorm where the wind swallowed everything before it reached anyone’s ears.

Besides, I wasn’t sure what “stable” meant anymore.

My father barely acknowledged me when I came downstairs for breakfast the next morning. He sat at the head of the table, reading the news on his tablet, his coffee steaming beside him. He didn’t look up when I entered. He didn’t say good morning. He didn’t ask how I was doing.

He never did.

My mother fluttered around the kitchen like a nervous bird, placing a plate in front of me. “Eat something, sweetheart. You need your strength.”

My father turned a page on his tablet. “She needs routine,” he said, not looking at either of us. “Structure.”

My mother nodded quickly, as if he’d said something profound. “Yes, of course. Routine.”

I cut into my toast. “I’m fine.”

My father made a low noise, not quite a laugh, not quite a scoff. “You always say that.”

I didn’t respond. There was no point. He didn’t want an answer; he wanted the last word.

He always did.

Growing up, my father’s silence was the loudest thing in the house. He wasn’t cruel, exactly - just cold. Detached. Like he was observing us from behind glass. My mother tried to fill the space he left, but she was too soft, too apologetic, too afraid of upsetting him.

She apologized for everything.

If I cried, she apologized.
If I got upset, she apologized.
If I asked for attention, she apologized.
If my father ignored me, she apologized for him.

“Your father’s tired.”
“Your father’s stressed.”
“Your father doesn’t mean it.”
“Your father loves you in his own way.”

I used to believe her. I used to think love could look like silence, like distance, like a closed door.

Now I wasn’t so sure.

That afternoon, my mother asked if I wanted to help her decorate the living room for the holidays. I didn’t, but saying no would’ve led to a whole conversation about “healing activities,” so I agreed.

We hung garlands. We arranged candles. We placed a wreath on the mantle. My mother hummed softly, the same tune she always hummed when she was trying to pretend everything was fine.

“You know,” she said, adjusting a ribbon, “your father has been very worried about you.”

I almost laughed. “Really.”

“Yes,” she insisted. “He just… he doesn’t know how to show it.”

“He never has.”

She flinched, just slightly. “He tries.”

“No,” I said, more sharply than I intended. “He doesn’t.”

My mother’s eyes darted toward the hallway, as if my father might appear and scold her for letting me say such a thing. “Lila, please. He’s doing his best.”

I stared at her. “Is he?”

She didn’t answer.

She didn’t have to.

That night, I lay in my childhood bedroom, staring at the glow‑in‑the‑dark stars still stuck to the ceiling. I’d put them up when I was ten, convinced they made my room look magical. Now they just looked sad; little plastic lies pretending to be something bright.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

I sat up.

It wasn’t the house.
It wasn’t the wind.
It wasn’t the cabin.

It was memory.

It was the sound of Rowan knocking on my bedroom door when we were kids, begging me to come play. It was the sound of him tapping his pencil during homework, driving me insane. It was the sound of him flicking my shoulder at family dinners, whispering jokes that made me laugh even when I didn’t want to.

It was the sound of him teasing me until I cried.
It was the sound of him apologizing afterward, awkward and insincere.
It was the sound of him growing sharper as we got older, learning exactly how to hurt me.

It was the sound of him falling in the snow.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

I pressed my hands to my ears. “Stop.”

The tapping stopped.

But the quiet felt worse.

The next morning, my father finally acknowledged me. Sort of.

He stood in the doorway of the kitchen, arms crossed, watching me pour cereal. “Your mother says you’re not sleeping.”

I shrugged. “I’m fine.”

“You’re not,” he said, in that flat, matter‑of‑fact tone he used for everything. “You look exhausted.”

“Thanks.”

He ignored the sarcasm. “You need to get yourself under control.”

I froze. “Excuse me?”

“You’re letting this… situation consume you.”

“This situation?” I repeated. “You mean Rowan dying?”

He didn’t flinch. “Accidents happen.”

I stared at him, waiting for something; empathy, concern, anything. But his face was unreadable.

My mother rushed in, placing a hand on his arm. “She’s grieving,” she said quickly. “She needs time.”

“She needs discipline,” he said.

I set my bowl down. “I’m not a child.”

He looked at me then, really looked at me, and for a moment, I saw something in his eyes. Not anger. Not disappointment.

Fear.

It was gone in an instant.

“Get some rest,” he said, turning away. “You’re not yourself.”

But what if I was?

What if this was the most myself I had ever been?

That night, I dreamed of the cabin again. The snow. The cold. The open door. Rowan’s voice calling my name — not accusing, not angry, just… sad.

When I woke, my pillow was damp.

I wasn’t sure if I’d been crying or sweating.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

I didn’t tell it to stop this time.

I just listened.

CHAPTER FOUR 
Cracks 
I woke up the next morning to the sound of my parents arguing downstairs, quietly, of course. They never fought loudly. Loud fights meant acknowledging something was wrong, and my parents were allergic to that.

I lay in bed, listening to the muffled voices drifting up through the floorboards.

“She’s not herself,” my father said, his voice low and clipped.

“She’s grieving,” my mother whispered back. “She needs support.”

“She needs discipline.”

There it was again. That word. Discipline. Like I was a misbehaving dog.

My mother’s voice trembled. “Please don’t start.”

“I’m not starting anything,” he said. “I’m stating facts.”

I stared at the ceiling, feeling the familiar tightness in my chest. This was the soundtrack of my childhood…  my mother pleading, my father dismissing, both of them pretending everything was fine as long as no one raised their voice.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

I closed my eyes. “Not now.”

The tapping faded, but the tension didn’t.

When I came downstairs, my father was sitting at the table with his coffee, pretending to read the news. My mother stood at the stove, stirring oatmeal like it was the most important task in the world.

“Morning,” I said.

My mother turned, smiling too brightly. “Good morning, sweetheart. Did you sleep?”

“No.”

My father didn’t look up. “You should try harder.”

I blinked. “Try harder to sleep?”

“Yes.”

I waited for him to elaborate. He didn’t.

My mother shot him a warning look. “She’s doing her best.”

He set his tablet down with a sigh. “Her best isn’t enough right now.”

I felt something inside me tighten, like a thread pulled too taut. “What exactly do you want me to do?”

“Get control of yourself,” he said, as if it were the simplest thing in the world.

My mother stepped between us. “Please, both of you—”

“No,” I said, surprising myself. “Let him talk.”

My father’s eyes narrowed. “You’re being dramatic.”

There it was. The word that had shaped my entire life. Dramatic. The ultimate dismissal. The ultimate silencer.

I laughed, a sharp, humorless sound. “Of course I am.”

My mother flinched. “Lila—”

“No,” I said again. “I’m tired of pretending.”

My father stood up slowly, like he was preparing for a confrontation he thought he could win. “You’re tired? Your cousin is dead.”

The room went silent.

My mother’s hand flew to her mouth. “Please don’t—”

But he wasn’t finished.

“And instead of processing that like an adult, you’re making everything about yourself.”

I stared at him, stunned. Not because he said it, but because he meant it. He genuinely believed I was the problem. That I always had been.

Something cold settled in my chest.

“I’m not making anything about myself,” I said quietly. “I’m trying to survive.”

He scoffed. “You’re always trying to survive something.”

My mother stepped forward, voice trembling. “Please stop. She’s hurting.”

“She’s unstable, a spoiled, narcissistic little bitch!” he yelled.

I felt the air shift. My mother’s eyes widened, as if he’d crossed a line even she couldn’t ignore.

“Don’t call her that,” she whispered.

“Why not?” he asked. “It’s true.”

I didn’t realize I was shaking until my mother reached for my hand. I pulled away.

“I’m going for a walk,” I said.

My father shrugged. “Fine.”

My mother whispered, “Take a coat.”

I didn’t.

The cold hit me like a slap when I stepped outside, but I welcomed it. It felt honest. Clean. Nothing like the suffocating warmth of the house.

I walked down the street, past the neighbors’ holiday decorations, past the bare trees, past the places that used to feel familiar. My breath fogged in the air, each exhale a little cloud of proof that I was still here.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

I stopped walking.

It wasn’t coming from the houses.
It wasn’t coming from the street.
It wasn’t coming from anywhere outside.

It was inside me.

A pulse.
A memory.
A reminder.

“You don’t have to let them hurt you,” the voice whispered.

I closed my eyes. “I know.”

“You don’t have to be small.”

“I know.”

“You don’t have to be quiet.”

My breath hitched. “I know.”

The voice softened, almost gentle. “Then stop pretending.”

I opened my eyes.

The world looked the same. Gray sky, quiet street, cold air,  but something inside me had shifted. A tiny crack widening. A truth I’d spent years avoiding finally pushing through.

I wasn’t the problem.

I never had been.

When I returned home, my mother was waiting in the foyer, wringing her hands.

“Sweetheart, please don’t be upset,” she said. “Your father didn’t mean—”

“Yes,” I said, brushing past her. “He did.”

She followed me into the living room. “He’s just… he’s scared.”

“Of what?” I asked. “Me?”

She hesitated. “Of losing control.”

I turned to her. “Of me losing control, or him losing control of me?”

She didn’t answer.

She didn’t have to.

That night, I lay in bed, staring at the glow‑in‑the‑dark stars again. They looked different now, not sad, but false. Like everything in this house. Like everything in my childhood.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

I didn’t flinch.

I didn’t cover my ears.

I didn’t tell it to stop.

I just listened.

And for the first time, the tapping didn’t feel like a warning.

It felt like an invitation.

CHAPTER FIVE 
 Spreading 
I started waking up before dawn.

Not on purpose. My body just decided sleep was optional now. I’d open my eyes to the faint blue light creeping through the blinds, the house still and silent, the world outside frozen in place. It should’ve been peaceful.

It wasn’t.

It felt like the moment before something breaks.

I’d lie there, staring at the ceiling, listening to the quiet hum of the heater and the faint ticking of the hallway clock. Normal sounds. Familiar sounds. But they all felt… wrong. Too sharp. Too close.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

Sometimes it was soft, like fingertips on glass.
Sometimes it was louder, like knuckles on wood.
Sometimes it was inside my head, pulsing behind my eyes.

I didn’t tell my parents. They wouldn’t have understood.

Or worse, they would’ve pretended to.

My mother tried to keep things normal. She made breakfast every morning, humming the same nervous tune she always hummed when she was trying to hold the world together with sheer optimism.

“Eat something,” she’d say, placing a plate in front of me. “You need your strength.”

I’d pick at my food, pushing eggs around the plate until they looked like abstract art.

“You’re not eating,” she’d say, voice tight.

“I’m not hungry.”

“You need to try.”

“I said I’m not hungry.”

She’d flinch, like I’d slapped her. “Sweetheart, please don’t be upset.”

“I’m not upset.”

“You sound upset.”

I set my fork down. “Maybe I’m just tired of being managed.”

Her eyes filled with tears instantly, my mother’s superpower. “I’m only trying to help.”

I sighed. “I know.”

And I did know. She wasn’t the enemy. She was just… weak. Soft. A woman who had spent her entire life smoothing over cracks instead of fixing them.

But cracks don’t disappear.
They spread.

My father, on the other hand, didn’t bother pretending.

He watched me like I was a problem he needed to solve. A puzzle missing pieces. A malfunctioning appliance.

One morning, he cornered me in the hallway.

“You’re avoiding us,” he said.

“I’m taking space.”

“You don’t need space. You need stability.”

I laughed. “You mean control.”

His jaw tightened. “Your mother is worried.”

“She’s always worried.”

“She has reason to be.”

I crossed my arms. “Why? Because I’m not performing grief the way you want me to?”

His eyes narrowed. “You’re being dramatic.”

There it was again. The word that had shaped my entire life. The word that meant “stop feeling,” “stop talking,” “stop being inconvenient.”

I stepped closer. “Maybe I am dramatic. Maybe that’s who I am.”

He didn’t move. “It’s who you choose to be.”

“No,” I said quietly. “It’s who you made me.”

For a moment, just a moment… something flickered in his eyes. Not guilt. Not regret.

Fear.

Then it was gone.

“Get some rest,” he said, turning away. “You’re not thinking clearly.”

But I was.
Clearer than ever.

That afternoon, I found my mother crying in the laundry room. She wiped her eyes quickly when she saw me.

“Oh-hi, sweetheart. I’m fine.”

“You’re not.”

She forced a smile. “It’s just been a lot. For all of us.”

I leaned against the doorframe. “You don’t have to stay with him, you know.”

Her face crumpled. “Lila, please don’t start.”

“I’m not starting anything. I’m stating facts.”

“He’s your father.”

“And you’re my mother. Don’t you want more than this?”

She shook her head, tears spilling over. “I can’t leave. I wouldn’t know how.”

“You could learn.”

“I’m not strong like you.”

I almost laughed. Strong? Me? The girl who couldn’t sleep, who heard tapping in her skull, who felt like she was unraveling thread by thread?

But maybe she was right.
Maybe I was strong.
Just not in the way she meant.

She reached for my hand. “Please don’t be angry with him. He’s trying.”

“No,” I said softly. “He’s not.”

She looked away.

And I realized something then, something small but sharp, like a splinter under the skin.

My mother didn’t stay because she loved him.
She stayed because she was afraid of what would happen if she didn’t.

Fear was the glue holding this family together.

And I was starting to come unstuck.

That night, I couldn’t sit still. I paced my room, the glow‑in‑the‑dark stars watching me like tiny, judgmental eyes. I opened the window, letting the cold air bite at my skin. I closed it again. I sat on the bed. I stood up. I lay down. I stood up again.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

I pressed my palms to my temples. “Stop.”

The tapping didn’t stop.

It grew louder.

Faster.

Like a heartbeat.

Like footsteps.

Like someone knocking on a door that didn’t exist.

I squeezed my eyes shut. “Please.”

The tapping stopped.

And then a voice; soft, familiar, almost gentle whispered:

“You don’t belong here.”

My breath caught.

“You never did.”

I opened my eyes.

The room was empty.

But I wasn’t alone.

1q4jh83,https://i.redd.it/vehznmoyoibg1.png,Choosing the Right GPU for V-Ray: What Actually Makes a Difference,"The first time I saw a V-Ray GPU render finish in under a minute, I genuinely thought something was wrong. Same scene. Same materials. Same lighting. The only thing that changed was the GPU. According to Chaos’ own benchmarks, moving from an older mid-range card to a modern RTX GPU can cut render times by 2x to 4x. Sometimes more. That’s not a small improvement. That’s the difference between waiting and iterating.

I felt the shift immediately after upgrading my own setup. Before, hitting render meant mentally stepping away. Coffee. Email. Maybe something else entirely. After switching to a newer RTX card, rendering stopped being a “come back later” moment. Adjust a light, re-render. Change a material, re-render again. You stay in the flow instead of constantly breaking it.

That’s the part people don’t talk about enough. Faster GPUs don’t just save time. They change how you work. You try more ideas because the cost of being wrong drops. You iterate instead of settling. And once you experience that, it’s very hard to go back.

So let’s talk about what actually matters when choosing a GPU for V-Ray, which cards make sense right now, and where the hype doesn’t line up with real-world results.

**What actually changes your day**

* **Render feedback stops breaking your focus:** When test renders finish fast enough, lighting and material tweaks feel immediate instead of disruptive.
* **Interactive rendering becomes usable:** V-Ray GPU really shines when you can leave IPR running and adjust scenes live instead of guessing.
* **Noise clears faster without aggressive denoising:** More GPU power means more rays, cleaner results, and less reliance on heavy denoisers.
* **Larger scenes become practical:** With enough VRAM, you stop stripping detail just to make scenes fit.
* **Dead time disappears:** Renders stop dictating your schedule and start fitting into it.

**Why GPU choice matters more than people think**

V-Ray GPU isn’t just a faster version of CPU rendering. It behaves differently. It relies on massive parallelism, CUDA cores, RT cores, and most importantly, VRAM. When your scene fits comfortably in memory and the GPU has room to breathe, render times don’t drop gradually. They fall off a cliff.

That difference shows up most during look development. CPU rendering encourages batching decisions. Change a few things, render once, wait. GPU rendering encourages iteration. One tweak, one render, repeat. That feedback loop is where productivity really changes.

Of course, GPU rendering has limits. VRAM is the big one. If your scene doesn’t fit, performance tanks or fails outright. Some legacy features still favor CPU. And throwing a powerful GPU into an otherwise weak system won’t magically fix everything.

But for most modern V-Ray workflows, especially interiors, product visuals, archviz previews, and client-driven iteration, the GPU is often the real bottleneck worth fixing.

**If your hardware is already sweating**

Even with the right GPU, V-Ray can start feeling slow when scenes grow large or deadlines pile up. Heavy textures, complex lighting, animations. That’s where laptops and older workstations hit their limits fast.

This is where [**Vagon Cloud Computer**](https://vagon.io/cloud-computer) changes the equation. Instead of upgrading hardware immediately, you can run V-Ray on a remote workstation with high-end RTX GPUs and serious VRAM, while your local device simply streams the session.

It feels like suddenly borrowing a top-tier rendering machine whenever you need it. Heavy scenes stay responsive. Test renders finish quickly. Long animations don’t lock up your local system. And your laptop stays quiet and cool.

A lot of artists use Vagon to test whether a GPU upgrade is actually worth it before spending the money. Others use it to handle render spikes, animations, or deadline crunches without committing to permanent hardware.

Either way, it removes the guesswork. You see how your actual scenes behave with more GPU power, not how a benchmark chart claims they should.

1q4jgzf,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZIndia/comments/1q4jgzf/a_solo_trip_turned_sour/,A Solo Trip turned Sour,"I’m 26M. I don’t live in India for the majority of the time but whenever I do come back, I tend to get out and explore fresh places. This is from a few months ago. At that time, I had gotten out of a long-term relationship and was not really open to anything.

I went on my second solo trip- this time Nainital, to get my mind off a few things. My journey began by me driving off solo to Nainital from my home near Delhi. I managed to reach there by night, and for the first time in my life, I ended up staying in a hostel. Overall I had a very good experience, I met some quality people and had lots of fun.

Day later, I was taking a leisure walk alone down the valley when I came across this cafe. They served me a delicious hot coffee with an even more amazing view. As I was soaking it all in, I was joined by another female solo traveller. They took a seat beside me, and after a few sips of the coffee, the conversation began. I won’t disclose much of her personal details here but only the fact that she was a seasoned solo traveller. The fact that she has been to many places in India, which were on my bucket list, and that too solo, was really impressive to me.

Then as the evening was coming to an end, we headed to take another leisure walk but this time, we were both in each other’s company. During the walk, our conversation steered towards discussing all the weirdness going around in today’s world in terms of dating and relationships. I chose to withhold from her the fact that I recently had a breakup. She was really suspicious of me at first, as she thought I must have been the type of guy who chase after hundreds of girls. This was all as per her previous experiences in Delhi NCR. The reality was quite different, my personality is very poised and I don’t fall for anyone easily. At my core I am a very emotional person, but for me to show that side it takes a lot of time and trust especially after how my last relationship ended.

As the conversation progressed, and she got to know me a bit better, she proposed to visit a nearby destination- Mukteshwar. I agreed and then we had dinner together. At the end of the night, I walked her down to the hotel. She casually invited me upstairs, but as it was getting late and my hostel was still an uphill climb from there, I chose to decline respectfully.

The next morning, I came to pick her up and we both drove off in my car towards our destination. Everything was fine until we were 30 minutes away from our destination. I don’t know what it was, but I started observing a stark change in her personality.

She tightly grabbed my arm as I was driving and started leaning on it. At first, I thought she must have been tired from the journey and chose to ignore it. Later she started enquiring about my sexual preferences, what position I prefer, am I a morning sex person, or a night sex person, Do I like it rough or sensual, etc. Although she disguised it as a fun conversation among new friends my suspicion of her grew. Given the fact that I hardly connect with people on a regular basis, I chose to ignore it and I really shouldn’t have.

Here is when the real problem began. When we reached our destination, we had no idea of where we were going to stay and it was already late in the evening. I thought our best option would be to stay in a good place, preferably something like a big chain resort.

Since I earn in USD, I was more disconnected from the ground reality than any other person can be. Something that sounds affordable to me, can actually be a bit on the higher end to people earning in INR. In this case, the room that was being offered to us in the said resort was priced around 150 USD, while in her view it was around the 13,000 INR mark.

Since it was the biggest room they had and was actually quite spacious, we both ended up staying in the same room. I was really exhausted from the long drive it took to reach this hotel, and all I wanted was to crash and get some shut eye for some time. The bed was very big, and if we both were to sleep on the other ends of it, we would have never even noticed that the other person is there. But I guess, it wasn’t meant to be that way.

As soon as I lay down, she started getting closer to me in bed, first by accident touch of hands and then legs, and then progressing to pressing her entire body towards mine. I was fully aware of everything that was going on, but in that moment, I kind of just froze. I wasn’t expecting anything like this to happen. After a few minutes of her attempting to rub her body against mine, I finally broke the silence and said I’m really tired and sleepy.

She rushed to her end of the bed. In the night, we both had dinner in the hotel restaurant. By this point I had already requested an extra bed for my room so we both can sleep with ease at night. They never delivered it.

As we were both laying in the same bed again, I was hoping that she must have understood I wasn’t into her and that everything should be fine now.

She tried again, this time more aggressively and she was verbal about it. This time I clearly stood my ground and I broke it to her that I wasn’t into her and didn’t think of her in the same way. She got up to the balcony, was really upset and then came back to sleep in the bed again. I was awake for a few hours after that, just distracting myself by working on my laptop.

What if today was the only one you got?

I used to dismiss the phrase “live every day like it’s your last” as cliché, something made for coffee mugs or dentist office posters. But life has a funny way of proving those lines true. The older I get, the faster time moves, and the more I realize how easy it is to rush through days without really living them.

If this were your last sunrise, would you spend it stressing about what won’t matter in a month? Or would you slow down, breathe deeper, and actually see the people around you? Living fully isn’t about chasing thrill after thrill. It’s about presence, the quiet joy in noticing what you already have.

Drink your coffee while it’s still warm. Look someone in the eye and really listen. Tell the truth. Laugh longer. Love wider. Life isn’t waiting. It’s happening right now, and it’s too precious to rush through.",1,1767612888.0,Word_of_The_Day_Affir,0,1.0,False

1q4jab3,https://i.redd.it/ffwyl053mibg1.jpeg,My fragrance collection so far (2 months in). Feedbacks welcomed.,"Top Row (Left to Right)

* **Ajmal Yearn** \- opens fresh and aquatic with bright citrus notes of lemon, immediately giving a clean, energetic sea-breeze feel. The drydown has notes of blackcurrant and musk. Decent summer fragrance for daily gym wear. Projection and performance are below average.
* **Rayhaan Pacific Aura -** It's a clone of LV Pacific Chill (which I have never tried). The opening feels energetic and splashy, with a cucumber-and-orange freshness that wakes you up immediately. As it settles, the scent transitions into a smooth basil that feels clean. Dry-down is amber and fig. The mint is a bit overpowering in the beginning. Projection is strong in the first couple of hours, and longevity easily hits 6+ hours, which is impressive for this style.
* **Dolce and Gabbana The One EDP -** Ah, I instantly fell in love with this one. Opening notes are tobacco and amber. Middle note is citrus with a touch of spice. Drydown is woody/floral which makes it even sexier. Excellent scent. This is a date night fragrance. It’s soft, smooth, and effortlessly attractive. The scent is warm and cozy. Also, the bottle looks very sexy. The projection is around 5-6 hours, but no evening date needs to last more than 6 hours. Better if only worn at night.
* **Rasasi Hawas Ice -** First spray? Yeah… not great. The opening can be rough and very clone-ish, but give it time, and the dry-down absolutely redeems it. Once settled, it smells fresh, bubblegummy, sweet, clean, and very addictive, and then slowly moves into a warmer, amber dry-down. Projection and Silage are pretty good. A lot of folks have told me it's a great gym fragrance, but I don't think I'll use this in gyms because, at the end of the day, it does have that synthetic feel.
* **Creed Aventus -** This is the perfect summer fragrance in my opinion. Citrus, fruity, green, sweet, and woody all smashed together in the most recognizable way possible. To my nose, it smells like grilled sour pineapple with sweet lemonade, sprinkled over slightly burnt wood. Very sour-sweet, a little smoky, and super uplifting. The scent is not complex or dark. Very straightforward and a solid summer scent.
* **Bleu De Chanel Parfum -** It's straight-up gorgeous. This is what happens when a blue fragrance grows up and gets depth. It’s easily the blue aromatic fragrance for me. The opening hits with bright orange, lemon zest, and bergamot, then settles into a beautiful signature musk with soft woods underneath. Performance is fantastic, quality is top-tier, and versatility is almost unfair. It just fits anywhere and anytime. This is a 100% blind-buy safe fragrance. 10/10 for me.
* **Fraganote Alpha Spade -** opens with lavender and pear notes that feel comforting from the start. There’s a soft vanilla-like sweetness that blends into cinnamon nuances as it dries down. The dry-down is smooth. Performs for around 3 hours, with moderate projection. The scent is very light on the nose despite being sweet. Best worn during evenings, casual outings, or cooler weather when you want something comforting rather than attention-seeking.
* **Ajmal Kuro -** This is the first perfume that got me into this expensive habit lol. It's a clone of Dior Sauvage EDT, but on steroids with extra spicy-ness. The opening is very synthetic and sharp, like soapy detergent. But I like the drydown. If you are looking for the Sauvage clone, this is not the one you should buy, but the scent DNA is very mass appealing due to it's resemblence to Sauvage EDT.

Bottom Row (Left to Right)

* **The Body Shop Strawberry Body Mist -** opens with a bright, sweet strawberry note that feels playful and youthful. It stays fairly linear, remaining fruity and light until it fades. The dry-down is soft and sugary but very close to the skin. Performance is light, usually 2-3 hours. Best used for home wear. 8/10
* **Nike Up or Down EDT -** opens with crisp citrus and green notes. The scent remains fresh and straightforward, drying down into a light musky base without much complexity. Performance is limited, around 3 hours, with soft projection and minimal sillage. It’s not meant to impress but to refresh. Best worn for gym sessions and casual daytime wear.
* **Khamrah Qahwa by Lattafa -** had me worried at first because everyone kept calling it heavy and suffocating, but turns out that was dramatic. Yes, it’s dark and rich, but it’s also sweet, smooth, and surprisingly enjoyable. Opens up with a nice Coffee-ish scent with a hint of ginger. As it settles, the sweetness rolls in gently, blending boozy vanilla and warm spices without ever becoming too much. Very rich scent (could be polarizing for some), and performance is also crazy. Great for winter nights.
* **Maison Alhambra Alpine Homme Sport -** Dupe of Chanel's Allure Sport (never used the OG, but reviews say it matches 75-80% to the OG). Opening notes are Citrus, but settle into a sweet-musky scent. A great everyday scent for summer. Longevity and performance are mid, but since it's cheap, I can re-spray.
* **Dior Homme Intense -** Initially, I didn't like this one, but man, this one grew on me. Iris and Lavender are the undisputed stars here, but what makes it special is how it keeps changing personalities as the fragrance develops. The dry-down is just chef's kiss. Performance is excellent at 8-10+ hours, often lingering on clothes into the next day. It's a very complex scent. Great for a date night.
* **AXE Black Cherry EDP -** opens with notes of apple and a slight hint of coconut, which gives it a creamy feel, almost dessert-like vibe right away. In the dry-down, vanilla and amber take over, turning it into a warm, cozy, candy-like scent that sticks close to the skin. Performance is surprisingly decent, around 5 hours, with moderate projection early on and a soft, sweet sillage afterward. Best worn in the winter.
* **AXE Cocoa Gold EDP -** The opening has slight hints of bergamot, but it quickly changes into buttery and creamy chocolate. A lot better than AXE Dark Temptation, but a lot is left to be desired. Mid performance and projection.
* **AXE Midnight Oak EDP -** a surprisingly solid freshie. It opens clean with mint and lavender, giving it that cool, just-showered feel right away. As it dries down, cedarwood and patchouli take over, adding a soft woodiness. There is a black pepper note listed in the middle, but it’s very subtle and barely makes any noise. Projection is mid, and it stays fairly close after the opening. Overall, it’s an easy all-rounder that works for casual wear, daytime, or whenever you want something fresh and uncomplicated without trying too hard.
* **Skinn By Titan (Tales Rio EDP) -** It's a fresh aquatic scent that really shines in the summer. It opens with bright bergamot and marine notes that instantly give off cold, freezing water vibes. As it settles, patchouli comes through softly, adding a bit of depth without killing the freshness. Performance is modest, especially outdoors, which honestly makes it perfect for the gym or quick daytime wear. Light, cooling, and easy to enjoy when the heat is doing too much.

That's all, folks. Have a great year ahead. :)

I used to take a rennie or gaviscon and jus get on with it.

I noticed over the last few years, I would get chest infections alot and would require antibiotics and steroids on top of my steroid inhaler.

In april of 2025 is where things got considerably worse, I couldn't catch my breath, inhalers done nothing, serious reflux, only mild relief from antacids. Serious stomach issues, pain from drinking and eating everything.

The doctor thought I had  H pylori even tho my last test a few years ago was negative, he still put me on the double dose antibiotics for 2 weeks and things went from bad to worse. (I was taking my mums omeprazole to deal with symptoms so I couldn't take a h pylori test at the time)

I had lost serious weight, maybe 15kg at my lowest. And the health service at the minute is on it's knees so it too me til october this year to get a my endoscopy and colonoscopy done. 

I'm still waiting on the biopsies results but the scan found moderate candida in my esophagus. So I thought to myself thank God, we have the answer.

I started the next day on 14 days of fluconazole 200mg, after that 14 day period I knew it still wasn't clear so I was put on another 7 day fluconazole. I finished  the tablets for 1 week and symptoms returned. Another trip to the doctor with a fresh round of blood tests and another 2 week course, with the same result, felt slightly better but all my symptoms returned. 

Doctor then ordered a HIV test which has came back negative and was put on another 2 week fluconazole 200mg with nystatin to take after it finished. I took the fluconazole and jus felt shitty while taking it, started the nystatin and did see some benefits.

Yesterday was my last dose of nystatin so I made my appointment with the doctor this morning and showed him my mouth and again it is the usual white tongue and breathlessness everytime I eat. It hasn't cleared. I dont want anymore fluconazole and it wasn't offered, I was giving more nystatin and basically told to make an appointment with another GP in the practice as he doesn't know what else to do and 2 minds are better than one.

Am I missing something here, is this usually so hard to clear, I just don't know what to do anymore about it, is it ever going to clear? Ami going to be able to eat anything proper again. Is this me and morning coffees over. (I haven't had one in months)

Any advice is welcome.

I have everything  going for me apart from this. New business, new totally understanding girlfriend, I just need this issue put to bed,

Any help or insight would be great. Should I try a new antifungal, I want to give my organs a break for a few weeks anyway because of all the fluconazole. ",2,1767612342.0,Candida,2,1.0,False

      I'm thinking about how people misinterpret this  quote, and it in general. It's turning my stomach. I'd like to believe the stork brought me here at this point. I've been up since 4am. I still don't feel well, but I dragged my ass into the shower and am in my work clothes already. Cat scrubs for good vibes, because I need 'em. I'm exhausted even though I haven't done much of anything. Yesterday I did three loads of laundry, cleared off my bed, and put clean linens on complete with a fresh comforter. I paid my back rent, current rent, and I think like $20 extra. 

I think it might be the first time I've seen my whole bed in four months or more. Half of it was covered in all kinds of crap (books, clothes, trash without food waste like empty cups and bottles.) I would just change the flat sheet inside and fold it lengthwise like a sleeping bag. It didn't bother me nearly as much as it should have, but depression is like that. The sides of my bed are still surrounded with crap I need to throw out/put away/move. But the cats are so happy to have their space back. They love chilling with me on the bed (and without me.) 

I think I just got so fucking angry something inside my head snapped. Throughout my entire life the people who were supposed to be there for me either outright abused me or took advantage of me. My life is being affected by this mess and it was never ""mine."" This mess, all of it, is trauma made visible. I got sad thinking about how much cooking I did when I lived with P. I do none right now because everything is such a mess I haven't accessed my kitchen sink in over 6 months. 

I just don't know how to explain to ""normal"" people it can get this bad. My boss asked what was up with my documentation turn around time and I flat out told her ""I have severe depression that I'm not covering well anymore. I'm Autistic with ADHD. I'm not doing well. It's me."" What I really felt like telling her was ""just fucking fire me. Give me an out. Give me a reason. Let me give up."" I'm tired, man, so bone tired. 

But it felt nice to sleep in a clean bed with relaxed kitties by my feet last night. My goal for this week is to have my kitchen clean enough to make a cup of tea at least. I have a Dolly Parton tea kettle ""pour me a cup of ambition 🎵"" I haven't been able to use because my range is covered with dishes. I made endless cups of tea for P and for Z.  I prioritized having clean space to do so. I deserve the same care and comfort I give others, at least. 

I told ___ where to go the other day. I didn't want to, but I cried more in the few days of contact with him than I have in months. God doesn't want me confused and he certainly doesn't want me sobbing over someone who can't make up their mind to be decent. He wants me to have peace and stillness. As angry as I am with him (___), it still made me happy to see his team won last night. What the fuck is wrong with me? 

Well, I'd better get going. I'm bribing myself with coffee to go into the office early. You know what a clean bed means? Plenty of space to spread out and read. Now if only I can do that without feeling guilty for not cleaning.  The tea should help.

I come with an important announcement that absolutely no one asked for.

I am 24M, tech job, living in this city for years — and somehow still single.  
Which is shocking because I clearly have everything going for me:

• I don’t drink  
• I don’t club  
• I am vegetarian  
• I like quiet cafés  
• I enjoy long walks  
• I overthink professionally

Basically I am a walking “green flag” brochure but life said: *nah*.

My daily routine is elite-level boring:  
office → home → café → walk → suddenly questioning existence at a signal → sleep.

Dating apps?  
HAHAHAHAHAHA.  
What a concept.

You talk nicely.  
You reply on time.  
You crack jokes.  
Then suddenly — silence.  
Not even “seen”.  
Just spiritually gone.

At this point I feel apps are just practice for handling emotional damage politely.

So I’m here on Reddit doing what every sane person does — **publicly announcing my availability** like a limited edition product.

What I’m looking for:  
A girl who laughs easily, enjoys calm things, and doesn’t think fun only happens after midnight. Bonus points if you also judge cafés and hate loud places.

What you get with me:  
– Calm energy  
– Dry humour  
– Will listen properly  
– Will share food without fighting  
– Emotionally available, not emotionally dramatic

If you’re a girl reading this and laughing instead of cringing —  
congratulations, you are exactly the target audience.

No pressure. No expectations.  
If you feel like talking, DM.  
Worst case: one funny chat.  
Best case: coffee, walks, and a very stupid “how we met on Reddit” story.

# Questions

I didn’t expect my aunt to show up unannounced the next day.

She’d barely spoken to me since the funeral, which made sense, considering her son was the one who died. I assumed she needed space. I assumed she didn’t want to see me. I assumed she blamed me, even if she never said it.

Turns out I was right.

She arrived on a gray afternoon, the kind where the sky looks like it’s holding its breath. My mother opened the door, startled, and immediately launched into hostess mode.

“Oh-oh my goodness, come in, please,” she said, ushering her inside. “We weren’t expecting—”

“I need to speak to Lila,” my aunt said.

Her voice was calm. Too calm. The kind of calm that made my stomach twist.

My mother hesitated. “Of course. She’s upstairs. I’ll go get—”

“No,” my aunt said. “I’ll go to her.”

She brushed past my mother and climbed the stairs with a determination that made the house feel smaller.

I was sitting on my bed, staring at the glow‑in‑the‑dark stars again, when she walked in without knocking.

“Hi,” I said, because I didn’t know what else to say.

She closed the door behind her. “We need to talk.”

My throat tightened. “Okay.”

She didn’t sit. She stood in the center of the room, arms crossed, eyes sharp in a way I’d never seen before.

“They finished the autopsy,” she said.

My heart skipped. “Oh.”

“There were… inconsistencies.”

I swallowed. “What kind of inconsistencies?”

She studied me, her gaze unblinking. “Bruising that didn’t match a simple fall. Marks that suggested he struggled.”

My breath caught. “Struggled?”

“Yes,” she said. “As if he was trying to get away from something.”

Or someone.

I didn’t say it.  
 I didn’t have to.  
 It hung in the air between us like a storm cloud.

I forced myself to breathe. “What are you implying?”

“I’m not implying anything,” she said. “I’m asking.”

Her voice didn’t shake. Mine did.

“I didn’t hurt him,” I said.

She didn’t blink. “Are you sure?”

The room tilted. Just slightly. Like the floor had shifted under my feet.

“Yes,” I said. “It was an accident.”

She stepped closer. “Then why did the medical examiner say the injuries were… unusual?”

“I don’t know.”

“Why did he say Rowan’s hands had defensive marks?”

“I don’t know.”

“Why did he say—”

“I don’t fucking know!” I snapped.

Silence.

My aunt stared at me, her expression unreadable. Not angry. Not grieving. Something else. Something colder.

“You were the last person with him,” she said softly.

“I know.”

“You were the only person with him.”

“I know.”

She took a slow breath. “If there’s something you’re not telling us—”

“There isn’t.”

“Lila—”

“There isn’t.”

She studied me for a long moment, her eyes searching my face for something I didn’t want her to find.

Finally, she said, “I hope that’s true.”

Then she turned and left the room.

She didn’t close the door behind her.

I sat on the bed for a long time after she left, staring at the open doorway. My hands were shaking. My breath felt too shallow. My skin felt too tight.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

I pressed my palms to my ears. “Not now.”

The tapping grew louder.

“You don’t remember everything,” the voice whispered.

I squeezed my eyes shut. “Stop.”

“You don’t know what you did.”

“Stop.”

“You don’t know what you’re capable of.”

My breath hitched. “Please.”

The tapping stopped.

But the silence felt worse.

My mother came upstairs a few minutes later, wringing her hands like she always did when she was anxious.

“Sweetheart,” she said gently, “your aunt is upset. She didn’t mean to—”

“She thinks I killed him.”

My mother flinched. “No. No, she doesn’t.”

“She does.”

“She’s grieving.”

“So am I.” A lie that I felt cracking.

My mother sat beside me on the bed. “She’s looking for answers. That’s all.”

“There aren’t any answers,” I said. “It was an accident.”

She nodded quickly. Too quickly. “Of course it was.”

But she didn’t look at me when she said it.

And that hurt more than anything my aunt had said.

My father didn’t come upstairs. He didn’t check on me. He didn’t ask what happened.

But later, when I went downstairs to get water, I heard him talking to my mother in the kitchen.

“She’s fucking lying,” he said.

My mother whispered, “Please don’t say that.”

“She is.”

“You don’t know that.”

“I know her.”

My mother’s voice cracked. “She’s our daughter.”

“She’s unstable.”

I froze in the hallway.

Unstable.

The word echoed in my skull, bouncing off the walls of my mind until it didn’t sound like a word anymore, just a truth I’d been trying to outrun.

My mother whispered, “She needs help.”

“She needs control,” my father said.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

I pressed my hand to the wall to steady myself.

“You don’t belong here,” the voice whispered.

I closed my eyes.

“You never did.”

I didn’t sleep that night.

I lay awake, staring at the ceiling, listening to the house breathe around me. Every creak felt like a warning. Every shadow felt like a memory. Every thought felt like a threat.

I wasn’t afraid of my aunt.  
 I wasn’t afraid of the autopsy.  
 I wasn’t even afraid of my father.

I was afraid of myself.

Because the truth was simple and terrifying:

I didn’t know what happened in the snow draped cabin.

Not really.

Not fully.

Not anymore.

And if I didn’t know what I’d done once…

What else didn’t I know?

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


# CHAPTER SEVEN 

# Things That Shouldn’t Be There

The next night, things started to get worse.

I started seeing things in the corners first.

Not full shapes; just movement. A flicker. A shift. A shadow that didn’t belong to anything in the room. I’d turn my head, and it would be gone. I told myself it was exhaustion. Stress. The aftermath of grief.

But the shadows kept coming back.

And they were getting bolder.

The first time it happened, I was brushing my teeth. I leaned over the sink, foam gathering at the corners of my mouth, when I saw something behind me in the mirror.

A figure.

Just a blur. A silhouette. A shape that didn’t match mine.

I spun around.

Nothing.

When I looked back at the mirror, my reflection lagged,  just for a second… like a video buffering.

I laughed, because the alternative was screaming. “Great,” I said to my reflection. “Now I’m haunted by bad Wi‑Fi.”

My reflection didn’t laugh.

It just stared at me, a fraction too still.

Later that day, I walked into the living room and froze.

Snow was falling.

Inside the house.

Tiny white flakes drifted down from the ceiling, dissolving before they touched the floor. I blinked hard. Once. Twice.

The snow kept falling.

I reached out a hand. A flake landed on my palm, cold, real, and melted instantly.

Then my mother walked in.

“Sweetheart, can you help me—”

She stopped when she saw me standing in the middle of the room with my hand outstretched.

“What are you doing?” she asked.

I looked around.

The snow was gone.

The room was normal.

I lowered my hand. “Nothing.”

She frowned. “Are you feeling alright?”

“Never better.”

She didn’t believe me.  
 I didn’t believe me.

That night, I dreamed of the cabin.

Except it wasn’t a dream.

I woke up standing in the hallway, staring at the front door. My hand was on the doorknob. My breath fogged in the air, even though the house was warm.

I didn’t remember getting out of bed.

I didn’t remember walking downstairs.

I didn’t remember anything.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

I turned slowly.

The sound was coming from the kitchen.

I stepped toward it, heart pounding, feet moving on their own. The tapping grew louder, faster, more urgent. When I reached the doorway, I saw…

Nothing.

Just the dark kitchen. The silent house. The faint hum of the refrigerator.

But then the room shifted.

The walls darkened. The air grew colder. The floorboards creaked under a weight that wasn’t mine. And for a moment, just a moment, the kitchen wasn’t a kitchen.

It was the cabin.

The same angle. The same shadows. The same cold.

I blinked, and it was gone.

I stood there, shaking, gripping the doorframe so hard my knuckles ached.

“You’re losing it,” I whispered.

But the voice that answered wasn’t mine.

“You’re remembering.”

The next morning, my father cornered me in the hallway again.

“You were walking around the house last night,” he said.

My stomach dropped. “What?”

“I heard you.”

I forced a shrug. “Couldn’t sleep.”

“You were talking to yourself.”

I froze. “No, I wasn’t.”

“Yes,” he said, eyes narrowing. “You were.”

My mother appeared behind him, wringing her hands. “She’s grieving,” she said quickly. “She’s just—”

“She’s unstable!” my father snapped.

My mother flinched. “Please don’t say that.”

“It’s true. How many times do we have to have this same argument dammit!”

I stepped back. “I’m right here.”

He looked at me like I was a stranger. “Are you?”

Something inside me cracked.

Not loudly. Not dramatically. Just a quiet, delicate fracture.

Like ice splitting underfoot.

That afternoon, my aunt called.

My mother answered, but I could hear every word from the top of the stairs.

“I spoke to the medical examiner again,” my aunt said. “There were more inconsistencies.”

My mother’s voice trembled. “Please stop.”

“I can’t stop,” my aunt said. “Not until I understand what happened to my baby boy.”

“You’re hurting her.”

“She was the last person with him.”

My mother whispered, “It was an accident.”

“Was it?”

The silence that followed was suffocating.

My mother finally said, “Please don’t come here again.”

My aunt’s voice was cold. “I’m not done.”

The call ended.

My mother sank into a chair, covering her face with her hands.

I stood at the top of the stairs, gripping the railing so tightly my fingers went numb.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

I looked down.

For a split second, the stairs weren’t stairs.

They were snow.

White. Endless. Cold.

And at the bottom, half‑buried, was Rowan.

I blinked.

The vision vanished.

But the cold stayed.

That night, the hallucinations escalated.

I saw Rowan in the hallway… not as he was when he died, but as he was when we were kids. Eight years old. Freckles. Gap‑toothed smile. Snow in his hair.

He stood at the end of the hall, watching me.

“Lila,” he whispered.

I stepped back. “You’re not real.”

He tilted his head and gave a sinister smile. “Aren’t I?”

I blinked, and he was gone.

I pressed my back against the wall, sliding down until I was sitting on the floor.

“I’m losing my mind,” I whispered.

“No,” the voice said. “You’re finding it.”

I covered my ears. “Stop!”

“You’re remembering.”

“I don’t want to.”

“You have to.”

The tapping started again — louder, faster, relentless.

Tap‑tap‑tap‑tap‑tap!

I curled into myself, shaking.

“Please,” I whispered. “Please stop.”

The tapping stopped.

And then I saw it.

A flash.

A memory.

Snow.  
 The cabin door.  
 Rowan’s face twisted in fear.  
 My hand reaching for him.  
 A scream swallowed by the storm.

I gasped, clutching my chest.

It was only a second.  
 A fragment.  
 A crack in the wall of my mind.

But it was enough.

And I wasn’t ready.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


# CHAPTER EIGHT 

# The Cabin

I didn’t mean to remember.

I didn’t want to.

But memories don’t care what you want. They come when they’re ready, or when you’re too weak to hold the door shut any longer.

It started with the tapping.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

Not in the house this time.  
 Not in my head.

In the snow.

I was standing in the hallway when it happened, or I thought I was. The walls dissolved, the floor tilted, and suddenly I was back at the cabin, the cold biting through my clothes, the wind howling like something alive.

I blinked, and the present vanished.

The past swallowed me whole.

We’d been arguing.

That much I remembered even before the memories hit. Rowan and I always argued. It was our love language, our curse, our inheritance. But this argument was different. Sharper. Meaner. Something raw underneath it.

“You’re impossible,” he’d said, pacing the living room.

“And you’re predictable,” I’d snapped back.

He’d rolled his eyes. “You twist everything.”

“You provoke everything.”

“You’re being dramatic.”

That word.  
That cursed word.

I felt it like a slap to the face.

But the memory blurred there… the edges softening, the sound warping, the room bending like heat over asphalt.

Then it snapped back into focus.

Rowan grabbed his coat. “I’m done. I’m leaving. Have a great fucking vacation!”

“You can’t,” I said. “The roads are iced over.”

“I don’t care.”

He shoved past me toward the door.

And that’s where the memory used to end.

But not anymore.

The memory sharpened, colors too bright, sounds too loud. I could smell the pine. The cold. The faint metallic tang of winter air.

I followed him to the door.

“Rowan, stop,” I said.

He didn’t.

He yanked the door open, and the wind roared inside, scattering snow across the floor.

“Get out of my way,” he said.

“No. You don’t get to just torment me our entire lives and then when I try to resolve things between us you just get to leave and abandon me in the woods!”

He turned then - really turned; and for the first time, I saw something in his eyes I’d never seen before.

Fear.

Not of the storm.

Of me.

“Lila,” he said slowly, “you’re scaring me.”

The memory fractured there — a bright, painful crack — and for a moment everything went white.

When it cleared, we were outside.

I didn’t remember stepping out.  
I didn’t remember following him.  
I didn’t remember the first few seconds at all.

Just snow.  
 Wind.  
 Breath fogging in the air.

And Rowan backing away from me.

“Stop,” he said. “Just stop.”

“I’m not doing anything.”

“You are.”

His voice shook.

“You don’t even see it, do you?”

The wind swallowed my answer.

Another fracture, a jagged tear in the memory, and then:

Rowan slipped.

Or stepped wrong.

Or…

The memory blurred violently, like a film reel burning through.

I saw flashes:

His hand reaching for my arms.  
My hands reaching towards him.  
His eyes wide.

His body going limp.  
The world tilting.  
Snow exploding upward with a thud.

Then-

A blank.

A complete, blinding blank.

A hole in the memory so deep it felt like falling.

When my vision returned, I was kneeling in the snow.

Rowan was on the ground.

Still.

Silent.

The snow underneath him growing red like syrup on a snowcone.

The wind howled around us, erasing everything; footprints, sounds, the shape of the moment.

I reached for him.

My hand hovered over his coat.

Another fracture.

A distortion.

A moment I couldn’t - wouldn’t - see.

Then the memory snapped shut like a trap.

I gasped and stumbled backward, slamming into the wall of my bedroom. The present rushed back in a dizzying wave, the glow‑in‑the‑dark stars, the hum of the heater, the faint smell of laundry detergent.

But the cold stayed.

The snow stayed.

The truth stayed.

I slid down the wall, shaking.

“I didn’t mean to,” I whispered.

The voice inside me, the one that had been tapping, whispering, pushing, went quiet.

Not gone.

Just waiting.

Because the truth wasn’t finished.

Not yet.

There were still pieces missing.

Still fractures to fill.

Still a moment… the moment that my mind refused to show me.

But I knew one thing now:

Rowan hadn’t just fallen.

Something happened between us.

Something I wasn’t ready to see.

Something the memory was still hiding.

And the tapping…  
the tapping was getting louder.

  


# FINAL CHAPTER 

# Becoming

The last piece of the memory came to me in the middle of the night.

Not with a scream.  
Not with a hallucination.  
Not with the tapping.

With silence.

I woke up sitting upright in bed, the room dim and still, the glow‑in‑the‑dark stars fading in and out as my eyes adjusted. My breath was steady. My pulse was calm.

I knew, before the memory even arrived, that this was the moment.

The truth was ready.

And so was I.

It began the same way as before.

The cabin.  
 The snow.  
 The wind swallowing our voices.  
 Rowan backing away from me, fear in his eyes.

“Stop,” he said. “Just stop.”

“I’m not doing anything.”

“You are.”

His voice shook.

“You don’t even see it, do you?”

Then the blank.

The blinding, merciful blank.

Except this time, it didn’t stay blank.

The memory sharpened.

Rowan stepped back.  
 His foot hit ice.  
 He slipped, but he didn’t fall.

Not yet.

He grabbed my arm to steady himself.

And I-

I pulled away.

Not hard.  
 Not violently.  
 Just enough.

Enough to let gravity decide the rest.

Enough to let the moment happen.

Enough to let the truth be what it was.

Rowan’s eyes widened.

“Lila—”

Then the snow swallowed him.

And I stood there, breath fogging in the air, watching the storm erase everything.

Not horrified.  
 Not panicked.  
 Not broken.

Just… quiet.

The same quiet I felt now.

The same quiet that had been waiting for me to remember.

When the memory ended, I didn’t cry.

I didn’t shake.

I didn’t collapse.

I just breathed.

Slow.  
 Steady.  
 Free.

I whispered into the dark, “I’m not sorry.”

And for the first time, the voice inside me didn’t answer.

Because it didn’t need to.

We were the same now.

I went downstairs at dawn.

My mother was already in the kitchen, stirring oatmeal with trembling hands. My father sat at the table, pretending to read the news. They both looked up when I entered.

My mother’s face softened. “Sweetheart, you’re up early—”

“I remember,” I said.

The spoon clattered against the pot. My father’s jaw tightened.

My mother whispered, “Lila… please don’t—”

“I remember everything.”

My father stood. “Sit down. We need to talk about—”

“No,” I said. “You need to listen.”

He froze.

I’d never spoken to him like that before.  
 He’d never heard me like this before.

I stepped closer.

“You spent my whole life telling me who I was allowed to be. Quiet. Polite. Controlled. Manageable.”

My mother’s eyes filled with tears. “We were trying to protect you.”

“No,” I said. “You were trying to protect yourselves.”

My father’s voice hardened. “You’re being dramatic.”

I smiled.

“No. I’m being honest.”

He opened his mouth to argue, but I kept going.

“You never loved me. You barely tolerated me. And she—” I nodded toward my mother “—spent her life apologizing for both of us.”

My mother sobbed softly. “Please don’t say that.”

“It’s true.”

My father stepped forward. “You’re unstable.”

“No,” I said. “I’m awake.”

He stopped.

For the first time in my life, he didn’t know what to say.

Good.

My aunt arrived minutes later as if summoned by the tension in the air. She walked in without knocking, eyes sharp, grief hardened into suspicion.

“Lila,” she said. “We need to talk.”

“No,” I said. “You need to hear the truth.”

My mother gasped. “Sweetheart, don’t—”

“I’m not hiding anymore.”

My aunt’s voice trembled. “What did you do to Rowan!?”

I met her gaze.

“What I had to.”

She staggered back, breath catching in her throat. My mother sobbed harder. My father stared at me like I was something he’d never seen before.

Maybe I was.

I didn’t stay long after that.

I went upstairs, packed a single suitcase, and came back down. My mother reached for me.

“Where are you going?”

“Away.”

“For how long?” she whispered.

“Forever.”

She broke. My father didn’t move. My aunt watched me like she was trying to memorize my face.

I walked to the door.

My father said, “You can’t run from this.”

I turned back.

“I’m not running,” I said. “I’m leaving.”

He didn’t understand the difference.

He never would.

“And one last thing, fuck you.”

I crossed the threshold, stepped into the cold morning air, and felt something inside me settle.

Not peace.  
 Not joy.  
 Just truth.

I walked to the car, opened the door, and paused.

There was one last thing to do.

I whispered my new name into the quiet.

A name that wasn’t theirs.  
 A name that wasn’t tied to the cabin.  
 A name that wasn’t built on fear or performance.

A name that belonged to me.

I said it again, softly, letting it settle into my bones.

Then I drove away.

And I didn’t look back.

  
  
  


# EPILOGUE 

# After the Snow

The bus crossed the state line just after sunrise.

I watched the “Welcome” sign blur past the window, the letters dissolving into streaks of white and gold as the morning light hit the glass. The world outside was unfamiliar; new roads, new trees, new sky. But for the first time in my life, unfamiliar didn’t mean unsafe.

It meant mine.

I leaned my forehead against the window, letting the cold seep into my skin. It felt clean. Honest. Nothing like the suffocating warmth of the house I’d left behind.

I didn’t think about my parents.  
 I didn’t think about my aunt.  
 I didn’t think about the cabin.

Not with fear.  
 Not with guilt.  
 Not with regret.

Just… distance.

A closed door behind me.

A chapter I’d finished writing.

At the next stop, I stepped off the bus and into a small station that smelled like coffee and old wood. People moved around me: tired commuters, families, strangers with their own secrets… but no one looked twice.

No one knew me.

No one expected anything from me.

No one had a script for who I was supposed to be.

I walked to the counter, the strap of my bag cutting a familiar line across my shoulder. The woman behind the desk smiled politely.

“Ticket and name please?” she asked.

For a moment, the old one hovered on my tongue — the one tied to a family that never saw me, a cousin who tormented me, a house that tried to contain me.

But that name wasn’t mine anymore.

I inhaled slowly, letting the truth settle in my chest.

“Vesper,” I said.

The woman typed it in without hesitation. “Last name?”

I paused again — not out of fear, but out of possibility. A blank page. A clean slate. A life I could shape without anyone else’s hands on it.

“Vale,” I said.

Vesper Vale.

It felt right.  
 Sharp.  
 Quiet.  
 Unapologetic.

The woman handed me my ticket. “Welcome to town.”

I smiled — a real one, small and steady.

Outside, the air was crisp, the sky pale blue, the world wide open. I walked down the street with no destination, no plan, no past tugging at my heels.

The tapping was gone.

Not silenced.  
 Not defeated.  
 Just… integrated.

A rhythm inside me instead of a warning.

A heartbeat instead of a haunting.

I wasn’t running anymore.

I wasn’t hiding.

I wasn’t pretending.

I was becoming.

And as I stepped into the sunlight, the last remnants of snow melting beneath my boots, I whispered my name again. Not to remember it, but to claim it.

“Vesper Vale.”

A new beginning.

1q4j3op,https://www.reddit.com/r/GroundedMentality/comments/1q4j3op/its_not_you_the_real_reason_adult_friendship_is/,It's Not You: The REAL Reason Adult Friendship Is So Hard & 3 Science-Based Ways to Make It Easier,"Spent the last 6 months deep diving into why making friends as an adult feels like dating on hard mode. Read through psych research, listened to like 50 podcast episodes, talked to actual friendship researchers. The answer? Our brains are literally wired against us, and society set us up to fail.

Here's what nobody tells you: friendship formation requires something called ""repeated unplanned interactions"" and ""shared vulnerability in low stakes environments."" Basically, you need to accidentally run into people while your guard is down. College gave us that constantly. Dorms, dining halls, random Thursday nights. As adults? We commute alone, work in cubicles, go home and collapse. The average American hasn't made a new friend in 5 years. Not because we're broken, but because modern life eliminated the conditions friendships need to form.

Dr. Marisa Franco (psychologist who literally wrote her PhD on friendship) calls it the ""liking gap."" We consistently underestimate how much people like us after meeting them. That person you had a great conversation with at the gym? They're probably home thinking you found them boring, while you're thinking the same thing. Both of you want to hang out again, neither reaches out.

The biology is working against us too. After 25, our brains start prioritizing efficiency over novelty. Making new friends requires cognitive effort that our brains are like ""nah we're good with the two people we already know."" Add in that most of us are dealing with some level of chronic stress or anxiety, which makes our nervous system default to isolation instead of connection.

 1. embrace ""weak tie"" friendships and stop waiting for soulmates

We've been fed this narrative that real friendship means deep, ride or die, 3am phone call relationships. That's setting the bar so stupidly high that we reject perfectly good connections.

Robin Dunbar's research shows humans can maintain about 150 relationships total, but only 5 super close ones. The other 145? Still valuable as hell. Those ""weak ties"" (acquaintances, gym buddies, the person you chat with at the coffee shop) actually correlate MORE with happiness and life satisfaction than close friends in some studies.

Platonic is this app that's basically designed for friend dating. Zero romantic undertones, just ""hey I also like hiking and think The Bear is overrated, wanna grab coffee?"" Sounds cringe initially but honestly it removes so much of the awkwardness. You both know you're there to make friends. No subtext to decode.

The researcher Gillian Sandstrom found that even brief interactions with weak ties (barista, neighbor, coworker you don't know well) significantly boost mood and sense of belonging. Stop filtering for ""friendship soulmates"" and just start stacking small positive interactions.

 2. make the first move, then make it 6 more times

Here's the part that sucks: you have to be the one who initiates. Consistently. For months.

Franco's research found it takes roughly 50 hours of time together to move from acquaintance to casual friend, 90 hours to become real friends, and 200+ for close friends. But here's the thing, that time needs to be structured. You can't just log hours at the office.

After meeting someone and vibing, you need to initiate the next hangout within 72 hours while you're still fresh in their memory. Text something specific: ""That thing you said about Dune 2 had me dying, wanna catch a movie next week?"" Not ""we should hang sometime"" because that dies in the group chat graveyard.

Then you need to initiate again. And again. Roughly 6-8 times before the other person starts reciprocating equally. Not because they don't like you, but because of that liking gap thing. They're assuming you're just being polite.

The Friendship Formula by Lydia Denworth breaks down the actual science of bonding. Pulitzer nominated science journalist who spent years researching this. She explains how proximity, frequency, and duration are non negotiable. You can't shortcut the time requirement, but you can be strategic about creating the conditions.

One trick that actually works: instead of trying to schedule one on one hangs constantly (exhausting), invite new friends into existing routines. Going to the climbing gym Tuesday nights anyway? Invite them. Weekly grocery run? Make it a thing. You're not adding tasks to your calendar, just filling empty slots.

 3. optimize for ""third places"" and shared activities

The sociologist Ray Oldenburg identified ""third places"" (not home, not work) as critical for community formation. Coffee shops, parks, climbing gyms, book clubs, whatever. Places you show up repeatedly with no agenda except existing there.

The magic is in the repeated exposure without pressure. You're not ""hanging out"" you're just both… there. This is how those unplanned interactions happen. After seeing someone 5-6 times in the same yoga class, saying hi feels natural. Grabbing smoothies after becomes easy.

But here's the key: pick an ACTIVITY based third place, not just a location. Shared activities create what psychologists call ""collective effervescence,"" basically the buzz you get from doing something with others. Way easier to bond over a hard yoga class or beating a climbing route than forcing conversation over coffee with someone you barely know.

Meetup remains lowkey solid for finding activity groups. The barrier to entry is so low because everyone there is explicitly seeking the same thing. Book clubs, hiking groups, whatever weird niche hobby you're into.

The Art of Gathering by Priya Parker basically rewired how I think about bringing people together. She's a professional facilitator who worked with organizations worldwide. Main takeaway: gatherings need purpose beyond ""we should hang out."" Host a monthly dinner where everyone brings a recipe from their culture. Start a mini film club. Create structure around the gathering so there's less pressure to perform socially.

Also consider coworking spaces even if you work remote. Spaces like WeWork aren't just for entrepreneurs, they're basically adult playgrounds for meeting people. You're around the same humans repeatedly, working parallel, natural conversation emerges.

The research from the University of Oxford found that group physical activities (running clubs, sports leagues, group fitness) create bonds 2x faster than passive socializing. Something about shared suffering and endorphins speedruns the bonding process.

Look, I'm not saying this is easy. It's awkward as hell initially. You will suggest hangouts that don't happen. You will have surface level conversations that go nowhere. But the alternative is sitting home wondering why you're lonely while doing nothing about it. Modern life made friendship hard, but it didn't make it impossible. You just have to be more intentional than your parents' generation ever had to be.

The science is pretty clear: friendship is a skill, not a personality trait. You can get better at it through repeated practice. Start small. Smile at the regular at your coffee shop. Join one group that meets weekly. Text one person you've been meaning to reconnect with. Stack enough of those small actions and suddenly you look up 6 months later with actual friends.",1,1767611851.0,GroundedMentality,0,1.0,False

# Arrival



I always imagined winter break would feel cinematic; soft snow, cozy sweaters, maybe a tasty mug of cocoa held with both hands like I was in a holiday commercial. And honestly? When I stepped out of the car in my faux‑fur coat and rhinestone earmuffs, the snow falling in perfect little flakes around me, it *did* feel cinematic.

If you ignored Rowan.

“Are you done posing?” he asked, slamming the trunk like it owed him money.

“I wasn’t posing,” I said, which was a lie. “I was appreciating the moment.”

He rolled his eyes so hard I thought they might pop out of his face. “Right.”

Classic Rowan. Always ready with a comment, always allergic to joy. But this trip was supposed to be different. A chance to reconnect, according to my mother, which meant she was tired of us “bickering” and wanted to outsource the problem to a cabin in the woods.

The cabin itself was cute in a rustic, “I hope the Wi‑Fi works” kind of way. Wooden beams, a porch dusted with snow, warm yellow light glowing through the windows. It looked like the kind of place influencers rented for aesthetic content, which I appreciated. If I was going to be emotionally tortured by my cousin for a week, at least the backdrop was nice.

Inside, the air smelled like pine and cinnamon. I immediately claimed the bigger bedroom.

“Obviously,” Rowan muttered.

“Obviously,” I echoed, tossing my bags onto the quilted bedspread. If he wanted the bigger room, he should’ve walked faster. Or been nicer. Or both.

For a few hours, things were almost… pleasant. We made cocoa. We played a board game. Rowan even laughed once, which felt like spotting a rare animal in the wild.

I let myself believe this trip might actually work.

Then the knocking started.

A soft, deliberate tap‑tap‑tap on the far wall.

I froze. “Did you hear that?”

Rowan didn’t look up from his phone. “Hear what?”

Tap‑tap‑tap.

“That.”

He shrugged. “Old cabin. Relax.”

Relax. Sure. Because nothing says “relax” like unexplained knocking in a remote forest.

But I let it go. I was determined to be normal. Calm. Unbothered. I wasn’t going to let a little noise ruin my perfect winter aesthetic.

Not yet.

The next morning, I woke to the smell of coffee and the sound of Rowan humming, which was suspicious on its own. He was standing at the stove, wearing the same hoodie he’d worn for three days straight, stirring a pot like he was auditioning for a cooking show he didn’t want to be on.

“Morning,” I said, rubbing my eyes.

“You look like a raccoon,” he said.

“Thank you,” I replied sweetly. “I try.”

We ate breakfast. A sloppy plate of eggs and corned beef hash, fresh from the can! We joked. We planned a hike later in the day. For a moment, I felt something I hadn’t felt in years: hope. Maybe we could fix things. Maybe we weren’t doomed to be the family’s favorite feud forever.

I got ready for our hike after breakfast. Pink boots, pink backpack, pink bear mace. Fashionable AND practical. Because of the snow we didn’t go too far but just enough to see the beautiful view from the cliff. The sun glowing off of the crystalized lake below. The trees painted with sheets of white snow. A few snide comments from Rowan, but nothing as bad as the usual torment he put me through. 

Growing up, Rowan always treated me cruelly. Whenever I’d tell on him or whenever any of our parents even saw what he put me through, it’d always be the same response… “Boys will be boys”. I hated that statement. It was just a way to excuse them being horrible. Once we got older he learned how to do more harm psychologically and emotionally so it wouldn’t be as noticeable. The worst part was, that, he was good at it. He knew what to say to really get under my skin like a parasite. My mother forced me to go on this trip hoping we could make amends. I’m hoping so, but I don’t have much left. 

That night, the knocking returned.

Tap‑tap‑tap.  
 Pause.  
 Tap.

I sat up in bed. “Rowan?”

No answer.

I stepped into the hallway. The cabin was silent except for the wind outside.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

This time, it came from the living room wall.

“Hello?” I whispered.

The knocking stopped.

I didn’t sleep the rest of the night.

Over the next two days, the cabin grew stranger.

A mug I left on the counter appeared on the floor.  
 A window I closed was suddenly open.  
 My reflection in the bathroom mirror seemed… delayed, just for a heartbeat.

I told Rowan.

He laughed. “You’re being dramatic.”

The words hit me like a slap. He’d said them my whole life. Whenever I cried, whenever I stood up for myself, whenever I tried to explain how his teasing actually hurt.

“You always make things up,” he added. “It’s exhausting.”

I swallowed the sting. “I’m not making anything up.”

“Sure,” he said, already walking away.

I hated how easily he could make me doubt myself.

That night, I dreamed of someone standing at the foot of my bed. When I woke, my bedroom door was open.

I was sure I’d closed it.

On the fourth night, I woke to a whisper.

“Lila…”

My eyes snapped open. The room was dark, the air cold.

“Rowan?” I whispered.

No answer.

I stepped into the hallway. The whisper came again; soft, coaxing, almost familiar.

“Lila…”

It drifted from the living room.

I followed it, heart pounding.

“Who’s there?”

Silence.

Then a shadow moved behind me.

I screamed.

Rowan burst out of his room. “What is wrong with you?!”

“There was - I heard - someone was here!”

He stared at me with a mix of annoyance and something else. Something like fear.

“You need to calm down,” he said. “Seriously.”

But I couldn’t. Not anymore.

The next morning, Rowan confronted me.

“You were in my room last night,” he said. “Standing over me.”

“What? No, I wasn’t!”

“I woke up and you were just… staring.”

My stomach dropped. “I don’t remember that.”

“Sure.” he said coldly. 

I went back to my room to try and relax and settle my confused and scared mind.

The day spiraled.

I kept losing time.  
 I’d blink and find myself in a different room.  
 I’d hear whispers that stopped when I turned my head.  
 I felt watched, even when I was alone.

By evening, the knocking had become pounding.

Rowan snapped. “I’m done. I’m leaving.”

“You can’t!” I cried. “The roads are iced over!”

“I don’t care. I’m not staying here with you like this.”

He shoved past me toward the door.

And then everything blurred.

A shout.  
 A slip.  
 A crash.  
 Snow swirling in the open doorway.  
 Silence.

When I came back to myself, Rowan was lying motionless outside, half‑buried in snow.

My breath fogged in the air.

“Oh,” I whispered. “Oh no.”

But even as I said it, something inside me felt… quiet. Peaceful.

Like the knocking had finally stopped.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


# CHAPTER TWO 

# Aftermath



I didn’t cry right away.

People expect you to cry when something terrible happens, especially something “tragic,” which is the word everyone kept using, like they were all reading from the same script. But when I stood there in the snow, staring at Rowan’s still body, the cold biting through my coat, I didn’t feel anything.

Not shock.  
 Not horror.  
 Not grief.

Just… quiet.

Like someone had finally turned off a noise I didn’t realize had been blaring in the background.

But I knew how I was supposed to react, so I did. I screamed. I ran to him. I called for help with a trembling voice. I let the panic rise in my throat like a well‑rehearsed monologue.

And everyone believed me.

Why wouldn’t they? I’d always been good at performing.

The next few days blurred together; police questions, medical examiners, my mother’s frantic phone calls, Rowan’s mother’s sobbing. I floated through it all like I was underwater, watching the world move around me in slow motion.

I kept waiting for someone to look at me differently. To tilt their head and say, “Something’s off.”  
 But no one did.

They all saw what they wanted to see: a grieving cousin who had witnessed a terrible accident.

I didn’t correct them.

The funeral was small and cold, the kind of cold that seeped into your bones and made you feel hollow. I wore a black coat with a cinched waist and a tasteful veil. Understated, elegant, appropriately somber. People whispered that I looked “so composed,” which was apparently a compliment.

Rowan’s mother hugged me so tightly I could barely breathe. “He loved you, you know,” she said into my shoulder.

I nodded, because that was what she needed. But the truth was more complicated. Rowan loved me the way a cat loves a laser pointer… fascinated, annoyed, and always ready to pounce.

When the service ended, I stood by the car while my mother talked to relatives. Snowflakes landed on my gloves, melting instantly.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

I froze.

It wasn’t real. It couldn’t be real. It was just the memory of the cabin, the echo of a sound that had followed me for days. I told myself that. I repeated it like a mantra.

But the tapping didn’t stop until I got in the car and shut the door.

Back home, everything felt too loud. The heater hummed. The refrigerator clicked. The house settled with little pops and creaks. Normal sounds, everyday sounds, but they all felt amplified, like the volume had been turned up without my permission.

My mother hovered constantly, offering tea, blankets, emotional support, and unsolicited advice. “You need rest,” she said. “You’ve been through so much.”

I nodded and smiled and let her fuss over me, because it was easier than explaining that I didn’t feel tired. I didn’t feel anything.

Not really.

At night, I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, waiting for sleep that never came. The house was quiet. My thoughts were not.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

I sat up, heart pounding.

It wasn’t the walls.  
 It wasn’t the floor.  
 It wasn’t the wind.

It was inside my head. A memory, a rhythm, a pulse.

I pressed my palms to my temples. “Stop.”

The tapping stopped.

I lay back down, staring at the ceiling until morning.

A week after the funeral, my family insisted on a “healing dinner.” I didn’t want to go, but refusing would’ve caused more drama than attending, and I was too tired to deal with that.

The dining room was warm and bright, filled with the smell of roasted vegetables and the sound of forced cheer. My relatives talked in soft, sympathetic voices, like I was a fragile ornament that might shatter if someone spoke too loudly.

“How are you holding up, dear?” my aunt asked.

“You must be traumatized,” my uncle added.

My mother squeezed my hand. “She’s strong. She always has been.”

Rowan’s mother sat silently at the end of the table, eyes red, staring at her plate. I avoided looking at her for too long. Something about her grief felt too heavy, too real, too close.

I focused on my food instead, cutting my chicken into perfect little pieces.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

My fork hit the plate.

My mother looked up. “Sweetheart?”

I smiled. “Just thinking.”

After dinner, I slipped away to the bathroom and locked the door. I stared at my reflection in the mirror; flawless makeup, smooth hair, calm expression. I looked like someone who had everything under control.

But my eyes… my eyes looked tired. Not physically tired, but emotionally drained, like I’d been holding something heavy for too long.

I leaned closer to the mirror.

“Are you okay?” I whispered.

My reflection didn’t answer, obviously. But for a moment,  just a moment, it felt like she was studying me. Like she was waiting for me to admit something.

I turned away.

That night, I couldn’t sleep again. I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, listening to the quiet hum of the house.

“You did what you had to,” a voice whispered.

I sat up, breath catching in my throat.

It wasn’t a ghost.  
It wasn’t Rowan.  
It wasn’t anything supernatural.

It was me.

A part of me I had never let speak before. A part that had been silenced by years of being told I was dramatic, too sensitive, too much.

A part that had finally snapped free in the snow.

“You don’t have to let them hurt you anymore,” the voice said.

I exhaled slowly. “I know.”

I wasn’t afraid of the voice.

I wasn’t fighting it.  
I was listening.

And that was the part that scared me… or should have scared me.

But it didn’t.

Not at all.

  
  
  
  
  


# CHAPTER THREE 

# The House I Grew Up In

I didn’t plan on staying at my parents’ house for more than a few days, but somehow a few days turned into a week, and then two. My mother insisted it was “for the best,” which was her favorite phrase whenever she wanted me to do something I didn’t want to do.

“It’s just until you’re feeling more stable,” she said, smoothing my hair like I was a child. “You’ve been through so much.”

I didn’t argue. Arguing never worked in this house. It was like trying to shout into a snowstorm where the wind swallowed everything before it reached anyone’s ears.

Besides, I wasn’t sure what “stable” meant anymore.

My father barely acknowledged me when I came downstairs for breakfast the next morning. He sat at the head of the table, reading the news on his tablet, his coffee steaming beside him. He didn’t look up when I entered. He didn’t say good morning. He didn’t ask how I was doing.

He never did.

My mother fluttered around the kitchen like a nervous bird, placing a plate in front of me. “Eat something, sweetheart. You need your strength.”

My father turned a page on his tablet. “She needs routine,” he said, not looking at either of us. “Structure.”

My mother nodded quickly, as if he’d said something profound. “Yes, of course. Routine.”

I cut into my toast. “I’m fine.”

My father made a low noise, not quite a laugh, not quite a scoff. “You always say that.”

I didn’t respond. There was no point. He didn’t want an answer; he wanted the last word.

He always did.

Growing up, my father’s silence was the loudest thing in the house. He wasn’t cruel, exactly - just cold. Detached. Like he was observing us from behind glass. My mother tried to fill the space he left, but she was too soft, too apologetic, too afraid of upsetting him.

She apologized for everything.

If I cried, she apologized.  
If I got upset, she apologized.  
If I asked for attention, she apologized.  
If my father ignored me, she apologized for him.

“Your father’s tired.”  
 “Your father’s stressed.”  
 “Your father doesn’t mean it.”  
 “Your father loves you in his own way.”

I used to believe her. I used to think love could look like silence, like distance, like a closed door.

Now I wasn’t so sure.

That afternoon, my mother asked if I wanted to help her decorate the living room for the holidays. I didn’t, but saying no would’ve led to a whole conversation about “healing activities,” so I agreed.

We hung garlands. We arranged candles. We placed a wreath on the mantle. My mother hummed softly, the same tune she always hummed when she was trying to pretend everything was fine.

“You know,” she said, adjusting a ribbon, “your father has been very worried about you.”

I almost laughed. “Really.”

“Yes,” she insisted. “He just… he doesn’t know how to show it.”

“He never has.”

She flinched, just slightly. “He tries.”

“No,” I said, more sharply than I intended. “He doesn’t.”

My mother’s eyes darted toward the hallway, as if my father might appear and scold her for letting me say such a thing. “Lila, please. He’s doing his best.”

I stared at her. “Is he?”

She didn’t answer.

She didn’t have to.

That night, I lay in my childhood bedroom, staring at the glow‑in‑the‑dark stars still stuck to the ceiling. I’d put them up when I was ten, convinced they made my room look magical. Now they just looked sad; little plastic lies pretending to be something bright.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

I sat up.

It wasn’t the house.  
 It wasn’t the wind.  
 It wasn’t the cabin.

It was memory.

It was the sound of Rowan knocking on my bedroom door when we were kids, begging me to come play. It was the sound of him tapping his pencil during homework, driving me insane. It was the sound of him flicking my shoulder at family dinners, whispering jokes that made me laugh even when I didn’t want to.

It was the sound of him teasing me until I cried.  
 It was the sound of him apologizing afterward, awkward and insincere.  
 It was the sound of him growing sharper as we got older, learning exactly how to hurt me.

It was the sound of him falling in the snow.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

I pressed my hands to my ears. “Stop.”

The tapping stopped.

But the quiet felt worse.

The next morning, my father finally acknowledged me. Sort of.

He stood in the doorway of the kitchen, arms crossed, watching me pour cereal. “Your mother says you’re not sleeping.”

I shrugged. “I’m fine.”

“You’re not,” he said, in that flat, matter‑of‑fact tone he used for everything. “You look exhausted.”

“Thanks.”

He ignored the sarcasm. “You need to get yourself under control.”

I froze. “Excuse me?”

“You’re letting this… situation consume you.”

“This situation?” I repeated. “You mean Rowan dying?”

He didn’t flinch. “Accidents happen.”

I stared at him, waiting for something; empathy, concern, anything. But his face was unreadable.

My mother rushed in, placing a hand on his arm. “She’s grieving,” she said quickly. “She needs time.”

“She needs discipline,” he said.

I set my bowl down. “I’m not a child.”

He looked at me then, really looked at me, and for a moment, I saw something in his eyes. Not anger. Not disappointment.

Fear.

It was gone in an instant.

“Get some rest,” he said, turning away. “You’re not yourself.”

But what if I was?

What if this was the most myself I had ever been?

That night, I dreamed of the cabin again. The snow. The cold. The open door. Rowan’s voice calling my name — not accusing, not angry, just… sad.

When I woke, my pillow was damp.

I wasn’t sure if I’d been crying or sweating.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

I didn’t tell it to stop this time.

I just listened.



# CHAPTER FOUR 

# Cracks 

I woke up the next morning to the sound of my parents arguing downstairs, quietly, of course. They never fought loudly. Loud fights meant acknowledging something was wrong, and my parents were allergic to that.

I lay in bed, listening to the muffled voices drifting up through the floorboards.

“She’s not herself,” my father said, his voice low and clipped.

“She’s grieving,” my mother whispered back. “She needs support.”

“She needs discipline.”

There it was again. That word. Discipline. Like I was a misbehaving dog.

My mother’s voice trembled. “Please don’t start.”

“I’m not starting anything,” he said. “I’m stating facts.”

I stared at the ceiling, feeling the familiar tightness in my chest. This was the soundtrack of my childhood…  my mother pleading, my father dismissing, both of them pretending everything was fine as long as no one raised their voice.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

I closed my eyes. “Not now.”

The tapping faded, but the tension didn’t.

When I came downstairs, my father was sitting at the table with his coffee, pretending to read the news. My mother stood at the stove, stirring oatmeal like it was the most important task in the world.

“Morning,” I said.

My mother turned, smiling too brightly. “Good morning, sweetheart. Did you sleep?”

“No.”

My father didn’t look up. “You should try harder.”

I blinked. “Try harder to sleep?”

“Yes.”

I waited for him to elaborate. He didn’t.

My mother shot him a warning look. “She’s doing her best.”

He set his tablet down with a sigh. “Her best isn’t enough right now.”

I felt something inside me tighten, like a thread pulled too taut. “What exactly do you want me to do?”

“Get control of yourself,” he said, as if it were the simplest thing in the world.

My mother stepped between us. “Please, both of you—”

“No,” I said, surprising myself. “Let him talk.”

My father’s eyes narrowed. “You’re being dramatic.”

There it was. The word that had shaped my entire life. Dramatic. The ultimate dismissal. The ultimate silencer.

I laughed, a sharp, humorless sound. “Of course I am.”

My mother flinched. “Lila—”

“No,” I said again. “I’m tired of pretending.”

My father stood up slowly, like he was preparing for a confrontation he thought he could win. “You’re tired? Your cousin is dead.”

The room went silent.

My mother’s hand flew to her mouth. “Please don’t—”

But he wasn’t finished.

“And instead of processing that like an adult, you’re making everything about yourself.”

I stared at him, stunned. Not because he said it, but because he meant it. He genuinely believed I was the problem. That I always had been.

Something cold settled in my chest.

“I’m not making anything about myself,” I said quietly. “I’m trying to survive.”

He scoffed. “You’re always trying to survive something.”

My mother stepped forward, voice trembling. “Please stop. She’s hurting.”

“She’s unstable, a spoiled, narcissistic little bitch!” he yelled.

I felt the air shift. My mother’s eyes widened, as if he’d crossed a line even she couldn’t ignore.

“Don’t call her that,” she whispered.

“Why not?” he asked. “It’s true.”

I didn’t realize I was shaking until my mother reached for my hand. I pulled away.

“I’m going for a walk,” I said.

My father shrugged. “Fine.”

My mother whispered, “Take a coat.”

I didn’t.

The cold hit me like a slap when I stepped outside, but I welcomed it. It felt honest. Clean. Nothing like the suffocating warmth of the house.

I walked down the street, past the neighbors’ holiday decorations, past the bare trees, past the places that used to feel familiar. My breath fogged in the air, each exhale a little cloud of proof that I was still here.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

I stopped walking.

It wasn’t coming from the houses.  
 It wasn’t coming from the street.  
 It wasn’t coming from anywhere outside.

It was inside me.

A pulse.  
 A memory.  
 A reminder.

“You don’t have to let them hurt you,” the voice whispered.

I closed my eyes. “I know.”

“You don’t have to be small.”

“I know.”

“You don’t have to be quiet.”

My breath hitched. “I know.”

The voice softened, almost gentle. “Then stop pretending.”

I opened my eyes.

The world looked the same. Gray sky, quiet street, cold air,  but something inside me had shifted. A tiny crack widening. A truth I’d spent years avoiding finally pushing through.

I wasn’t the problem.

I never had been.

When I returned home, my mother was waiting in the foyer, wringing her hands.

“Sweetheart, please don’t be upset,” she said. “Your father didn’t mean—”

“Yes,” I said, brushing past her. “He did.”

She followed me into the living room. “He’s just… he’s scared.”

“Of what?” I asked. “Me?”

She hesitated. “Of losing control.”

I turned to her. “Of me losing control, or him losing control of me?”

She didn’t answer.

She didn’t have to.

That night, I lay in bed, staring at the glow‑in‑the‑dark stars again. They looked different now, not sad, but false. Like everything in this house. Like everything in my childhood.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

I didn’t flinch.

I didn’t cover my ears.

I didn’t tell it to stop.

I just listened.

And for the first time, the tapping didn’t feel like a warning.

It felt like an invitation.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


# CHAPTER FIVE 

#  Spreading 

I started waking up before dawn.

Not on purpose. My body just decided sleep was optional now. I’d open my eyes to the faint blue light creeping through the blinds, the house still and silent, the world outside frozen in place. It should’ve been peaceful.

It wasn’t.

It felt like the moment before something breaks.

I’d lie there, staring at the ceiling, listening to the quiet hum of the heater and the faint ticking of the hallway clock. Normal sounds. Familiar sounds. But they all felt… wrong. Too sharp. Too close.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

Sometimes it was soft, like fingertips on glass.  
 Sometimes it was louder, like knuckles on wood.  
 Sometimes it was inside my head, pulsing behind my eyes.

I didn’t tell my parents. They wouldn’t have understood.

Or worse, they would’ve pretended to.

My mother tried to keep things normal. She made breakfast every morning, humming the same nervous tune she always hummed when she was trying to hold the world together with sheer optimism.

“Eat something,” she’d say, placing a plate in front of me. “You need your strength.”

I’d pick at my food, pushing eggs around the plate until they looked like abstract art.

“You’re not eating,” she’d say, voice tight.

“I’m not hungry.”

“You need to try.”

“I said I’m not hungry.”

She’d flinch, like I’d slapped her. “Sweetheart, please don’t be upset.”

“I’m not upset.”

“You sound upset.”

I set my fork down. “Maybe I’m just tired of being managed.”

Her eyes filled with tears instantly, my mother’s superpower. “I’m only trying to help.”

I sighed. “I know.”

And I did know. She wasn’t the enemy. She was just… weak. Soft. A woman who had spent her entire life smoothing over cracks instead of fixing them.

But cracks don’t disappear.  
 They spread.

My father, on the other hand, didn’t bother pretending.

He watched me like I was a problem he needed to solve. A puzzle missing pieces. A malfunctioning appliance.

One morning, he cornered me in the hallway.

“You’re avoiding us,” he said.

“I’m taking space.”

“You don’t need space. You need stability.”

I laughed. “You mean control.”

His jaw tightened. “Your mother is worried.”

“She’s always worried.”

“She has reason to be.”

I crossed my arms. “Why? Because I’m not performing grief the way you want me to?”

His eyes narrowed. “You’re being dramatic.”

There it was again. The word that had shaped my entire life. The word that meant “stop feeling,” “stop talking,” “stop being inconvenient.”

I stepped closer. “Maybe I am dramatic. Maybe that’s who I am.”

He didn’t move. “It’s who you choose to be.”

“No,” I said quietly. “It’s who you made me.”

For a moment, just a moment… something flickered in his eyes. Not guilt. Not regret.

Fear.

Then it was gone.

“Get some rest,” he said, turning away. “You’re not thinking clearly.”

But I was.  
Clearer than ever.

That afternoon, I found my mother crying in the laundry room. She wiped her eyes quickly when she saw me.

“Oh-hi, sweetheart. I’m fine.”

“You’re not.”

She forced a smile. “It’s just been a lot. For all of us.”

I leaned against the doorframe. “You don’t have to stay with him, you know.”

Her face crumpled. “Lila, please don’t start.”

“I’m not starting anything. I’m stating facts.”

“He’s your father.”

“And you’re my mother. Don’t you want more than this?”

She shook her head, tears spilling over. “I can’t leave. I wouldn’t know how.”

“You could learn.”

“I’m not strong like you.”

I almost laughed. Strong? Me? The girl who couldn’t sleep, who heard tapping in her skull, who felt like she was unraveling thread by thread?

But maybe she was right.  
 Maybe I was strong.  
 Just not in the way she meant.

She reached for my hand. “Please don’t be angry with him. He’s trying.”

“No,” I said softly. “He’s not.”

She looked away.

And I realized something then, something small but sharp, like a splinter under the skin.

My mother didn’t stay because she loved him.  
 She stayed because she was afraid of what would happen if she didn’t.

Fear was the glue holding this family together.

And I was starting to come unstuck.

That night, I couldn’t sit still. I paced my room, the glow‑in‑the‑dark stars watching me like tiny, judgmental eyes. I opened the window, letting the cold air bite at my skin. I closed it again. I sat on the bed. I stood up. I lay down. I stood up again.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

I pressed my palms to my temples. “Stop.”

The tapping didn’t stop.

It grew louder.

Faster.

Like a heartbeat.

Like footsteps.

Like someone knocking on a door that didn’t exist.

I squeezed my eyes shut. “Please.”

The tapping stopped.

And then a voice; soft, familiar, almost gentle whispered:

“You don’t belong here.”

My breath caught.

“You never did.”

I opened my eyes.

The room was empty.

But I wasn’t alone.

1q4j21d,https://www.reddit.com/r/spoonfulofreason/comments/1q4j21d/habits/,Habits,"In the field of healthy eating, research has shifted its focus from identifying ""healthy foods"" to studies aimed at better understanding the neurobiology and psychology of automatic behaviour. Scientists agree that behavioural changes aimed at improving health are based not on willpower, but on environmental restructuring and mechanical repetition of actions.

Health-related behaviour is highly complex and cannot be reduced to the popular notion that we form habits in 21 days. While simple habits may take only a few dozen days to create, complex health behaviours (such as regular exercise or a specialised eating plan) can take 150, 300, or even more days to form.

Scientists distinguish between the habit of ""instigation"" (a spontaneous decision to start an action, such as making a salad) and the habit of ""acting"" (actually making the salad). Depending on what we repeat, we can form a habit of instigation or the habit of action - or both. The first automatism—the thought that it would be good to do something—is more critical for long-term health-related goals and results. If such a thought does not arise automatically (and automatic thoughts come with no effort), the action may not happen at all. For the second part—the action itself—it is essential to prepare an action plan that ensures the desired result with an acceptable level of effort. Such preparation and planning should preferably be done in advance, rather than after the automatic thought has come. For the habit to last, the action must be performed mindfully; we should not aim to automate it. Therefore, the task you set yourself should be related to the thought you want to automate—e.g., ""When I get home from work, I will immediately put the cutting board on the table."" This automatic thought should evoke positive emotions—if you get used to feeling guilty, the thought of doing something will most likely not lead to action. A good example of positive reinforcement is cooking while listening to your favourite podcast or music; over time, you will associate this pleasant activity with cooking, and cooking will become enjoyable.

The research results also include ideas of ""precision nutrition""—any ""healthy habit"" may be psychologically or biologically unsuitable for a particular person, depending on their microbiome, metabolism, and psychological stress factors. This approach has been made possible by the ability to process large amounts of data quickly. It is now clear that the specific composition of a person's microbiome affects their behaviour; specific gene variations associated with obesity and fat metabolism can determine whether, for example, a keto diet is beneficial or harmful to a person. In addition, people react differently to the same amount of carbohydrates; for one person, eating a banana may cause a fairly steady response, while for another, it may cause a sudden spike and crash. Studies show that a personalised diet leads to long-term healthy eating habits.

The latest recommendations focus more on eliminating environmental factors that interfere with the chosen plan (the ""friction framework"") than on strengthening motivation. It is considered a more effective strategy. Even small changes in the kitchen or personal digital environment yield significantly better results than educational interventions. For example, if you have pre-washed vegetables, you are almost twice as likely to make a salad with them.

What can be done based on the latest research data?

* Link your habits together in chains—perform the action you want to turn into a habit after an existing habit, e.g., ""after pouring my morning coffee, I will pour myself a large glass of water.""
* Put more effort into the first half of the day – research shows that morning habits are almost twice as successful as evening habits, most likely because the psychological resources needed in the evening have already been used up.
* Try to find a solution that makes you happy, because inner satisfaction is the most excellent motivator and ensures the longest-lasting habits. For example, if you are developing the habit of eating healthily, look for healthy foods that you like, rather than forcing yourself to eat healthy foods that you don't like. I want to repeat this: healthy food must be tasty; otherwise, unhealthy tasty food is guaranteed to win.
* Use digital tools—apps and reminders — that make food preparation and cooking easier; review and edit your digital content channels so you don't see incentives to eat heavily processed foods.
* Monitor progress, not results – monitor how often you repeat the desired action. By monitoring progress rather than results, the desired behaviour lasts more than a third longer.

If you’re reading this, you probably know that specific kind of aching silence. The one where you’re sitting right next to the man you love, but he feels a thousand miles away. The laughter is gone, the texts are shorter, and you’re left wondering, ""What am I doing wrong?""

I saw this happen to my close friend, Neha. She was with William a guy who used to remember her coffee order and text ""I miss your voice"" every single day. But then, it shifted. He stopped noticing her. He stopped trying. She tried everything: romantic dates, giving him space, even pretending she didn't care. Nothing worked.

One night, she found something that changed the entire game. It’s called the ""Hero Instinct.""

Now, before you roll your eyes—this isn't about him being a superhero. It’s about a man’s biological need to feel essential, valued, and trusted. Neha realized that in her attempt to ""fix"" everything herself, she was accidentally telling William, ""I don't need you."" And for a man, feeling unnecessary is the fastest way to lose interest.

She started using small ""emotional triggers"" and a specific communication style (often called the 12-word text) to flip that switch in his brain. Within days, the wall between them started to crumble.

I’ve put together a full breakdown of how this psychology works and how Neha actually used it to save her relationship from the edge. It’s not a ""miracle fix,"" but it’s the most honest look at male psychology I’ve ever seen.

1q4izis,https://i.redd.it/2cdess6dkibg1.jpeg,Sultan select royal hajori directly from oman,"The absolute best frankincense in the world. It's medicinal grade and it's often used for it's medicinal properties rather than used as incense but many still use it as incense. I do both. I make a frankincense infused water. Just put a medium sized tear in a bottle of spring water and set it in the fridge over night. Then in the morning I take it out and drink a quarter of it and then drink the rest as the day goes on. Sometimes u can even take out what's left of the tear and reuse it for another infusion. It's best to drink it on an empty stomach. It's important to note that I'm not a doctor or professional and I'm not saying it's a cure for anything. However there are multiple sources including Omani locals that use this on a daily basis. Hajori frankincense is such a huge part of their culture. I like to make an frankincense oil infusion as well. U grind it up really fine and u get a carrier oil like jojoba oil or MCT coconut oil and u get a mason jar. Put the frankincense in the jar and then pour the oil in and make sure it's fully covered. U can either do a warm infusion or a ""cold"" infusion. I like to just do a ""cold"" infusion by just letting it sit in a cool dark place for like 2 months. Stir it everyday to make sure it's thoroughly being infused. U can do a warm infusion by doing a double pot method or u can use a crock pot on low heat for a few hours and stir every 30 minutes or so. Then u get a clean jar and a either a coffee filter or a cheese cloth for straining. Put it over the jar and pour the infusion into the new jar. Make sure u squeeze it all out. If u want a really potent infusion u can do this process all over again using the already infused oil and pouting it over new frankincense and repeat the process. The oil is absolutely great for putting into cosmetics and homemade skin care products. It helps with wrinkles and it makes your skin feel so soft and it smells so good. Many cosmetics and skin care products already use frankincense in them. Now u can have your very own high quality oil. My mom uses it and it makes her skin really soft and helps with her dark eye bags. Also there is great research on the boswellic acids that is in the frankincense for helping pain and other things. However u must understand that frankincense essential oil does not contain boswellic acids. It is a light chemical that is lost during the distillation process. This is why the oil infusion works the best because u get ALL of it. Not only do u get the essential oils from the tears but u get all the other beneficial compounds that are in it that are lost in distillation.",3,1767611452.0,Incense,0,1.0,False

After we go for a walk on the local canal. We hold hands and talk about the future. How many kids we might have and how we'll grow old together.

Later that evening we have passionate sex, he envelopes me and I feel the full depth of his love and desire for me, and I for him. 

We cuddle after for some time, his strong arms wrapped around my tiny, fragile frame.

Then we take a shower together and he soaps my body sensually and with care, as I do the same for him, running my hands over his beautiful chest and muscles.

I cook dinner for us and lay the table. I put out candles, scented, the ones he said he likes.

We eat and chat. 

Later we throw on a movie and settle into the couch with a blanket over us. 

Then we go to bed and we gently drift off to sleep in each others arms. As my ego melts away we become one, together, greater than the sum of our parts.

There is very limited authentic information about Dhumavati available in books. Even the most knowledgeable experts have spoken very little about her. That may be why figures like Rajarshi Nandy rarely go into detail, and why platforms like the Sadhana App only provide general information about the Mahavidyas.

Dhumavati is not something that can be openly described in detail. If that were done, you would see YouTube Shorts and misinformation videos everywhere. Even the videos that mention Nahar Singh mostly recycle basic information taken from such sources.

Nahar Singhs are real, and sadhanas for direct Nahar Singh manifestation do exist—manifestations where the entity can physically appear before you. But such sadhanas are extremely dangerous. Period.

I’m sharing only a few small fragments of experiences related to Dhumavati. Interestingly, a person I met who practiced for 17 years had nothing concrete to share about her experiences. Still, I’ll list some observations here for the public to read.

1. Your eyes stop blinking normally. You can keep them open effortlessly for hours—maybe blinking only 7–8 times a day. To appear normal in public, I consciously blink more often.
2. You might pay someone ₹100 for coffee or food, and they return ₹500 as change—without realizing it.
3. People who try to harm or insult you end up facing accidents, humiliation, or setbacks. Small actions bring small consequences. Dont imagine what the bigger actions *wale* get. She prioritizes you intensely and protects you fiercely—you become precious to her.
4. Entities don’t attack easily. If you enter someone else’s domain, they often come first to communicate, asking you not to interfere, explaining how the situation is a result of that person’s own karma.
5. You begin to act without overthinking. She works fast. Your subconscious becomes far more efficient and responsive.
6. Her energy is extremely dense. Even a fraction—0.000001—can induce deep meditation in others. Many people cannot tolerate the intoxication of her name or presence. *Naam ka nasha* is so powerful that even hardcore drug users can abandon addictions.
7. You gain access to memories from childbirth to the present—events you never consciously remembered before. Not going to past lives or stuff in this post.
8. With her grace, you can stay awake for days without exhaustion.
9. Your body becomes resilient to extreme weather and harsh conditions.
10. Your tongue can detect the true nature of food. Even freshly cooked food prepared with negativity or unhealthy intent—something others cannot sense—becomes immediately apparent.
11. Diseases don’t linger. Even minor fevers or coughs disappear within hours.
12. Exams and studies become easier because the mind remains largely free of unnecessary thoughts.
13. There is much more. I may write a detailed post someday and edit this with more experiences. I’d genuinely like to connect with others who are her sadhaks.
14. When you stop asking the deity for things and simply do mantra japa, many good things start happening automatically. When I say I can see her with my physical eyes, I mean it literally. The first time I saw her, I was lying on a cot outside one afternoon and suddenly thought, *What the hell—something just passed across the sky?*

This is why people don’t openly talk about what actually happens during Dhumavati upasana. I’ve been connected to her for almost 13–14 years—not as a formal sadhana, but simply because I love taking her name and doing her mantra japa.

100 stars only entitles me to regular cup of coffee or a baked good.

For a brand that charges so much, you'd expect their rewards to be better than this. Even Mc Donald's which charges very little and have thin profit margins still offers far more than this.

I got a large cup of black coffee at Mc Donald's for $1 with an in-app deal. Got 100 points in return. Even if I used a Starbucks gift card for double points, the value of Mc Donald's points exceeds Starbuck's stars by far.

So, with Starbucks, not only do I pay premium prices, but they are stingy on rewards too!

As for the Starbuck deals in-app, they are even more pathetic. Two years ago, I'd get offers for $2 craft drinks or BOGO craft drinks once a month. Now? I'm lucky to get **one** every six months.

All of those changes the new CEO made to the workers outfits and the writing on the cups? I don't see them at my local Starbucks anymore.

Here to find a meaningful connection and try ace dating! I’ve only dated allosexual people in the past but with me coming to terms with my asexuality and being more open about being aegosexual I’ve realized it’s just not working. Dating heterosexual men has been draining (the consequences of my actions smh) and I’ve thought about just giving up on dating but I randomly remembered this subreddit exists so I’m giving it a shot!!

I still feel romantic attraction and am a hopeless romantic at heart (I blame rom-coms and wattpad) so aesthetic attraction is important. My DMs are open but you’ll have to share a pic of yourself if we start chatting.

About me🙋🏾‍♀️: 
I’m a 3rd year biology PhD student. Height is not that important to me but for others I’m 5’8. I LOVE to read (romance, fantasy, historical fiction), watch anime, travel (at least once a year internationally), and explore museums, bookstores, and coffee shops! When my social battery is full, I like a night out at restaurants, wine bars, movies, comedy shows, and when my battery is empty, I prefer a night in watching YouTube or reading. This year I’m trying my hand at more hobbies like journaling, learning to draw, and kickboxing! 
Personality wise, I’m funny, like to joke around, introverted and extroverted(INTJ-A) depending on my social battery. My political views are very leftist and I expect my partner’s to be the same (this is a non-negotiable). 

Things I value in a relationship💗: 
emotional intelligence, thoughtfulness, loyalty, kindness, compassion, and ambition.

1q4irdc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eurostar/comments/1q4irdc/eurostar_hostess_ignored_me_during_paid_meal/,Eurostar hostess ignored me during paid meal service. what would you do?,"Hi everyone,
I wanted to share what happened to me today and get your thoughts.

I was travelling from Gare du Nord to London with a Plus ticket. At the beginning of the journey, I fell asleep in my seat. When I woke up, the hostess was serving meals in my row. She served everyone except me, even though I had paid for the meal just like the others.

After that, she walked up and down the carriage several times offering coffee, tea, or water to people around me, including the person sitting right next to me but she completely ignored me, even though I was awake and clearly there.

In the moment, I didn’t say anything because I felt embarrassed and was scared of being brushed off or causing a scene. I know that might have been a mistake, but I genuinely struggle with speaking up in situations like this :(.

In the end, I didn’t receive anything I paid for, and the whole situation made me feel quite humiliated. I’ve already submitted a complaint through Eurostar’s website in the hope of getting a refund, but I don’t really know what kind of response to expect.

Has something like this ever happened to you with Eurostar (or another train company)? How would you have handled it, speaking to the hostess or a supervisor straight away, or doing what I did and complaining afterwards? I’d really appreciate any advice, just to know whether I’m overreacting or if this situation really was as bad as it felt.

It was sudden and I was blindsided. I had been there for almost a decade and thought I was safe. I wasnt.
The thing is I never told my wife or kids. I just couldnt.

 My wife had just quit her job to stay home with our youngest and we had just bought a new house and I was supposed to be the stable one. The provider. I couldnt look at her and say I lost my job.
So I didnt.

Every morning for six years I get up and put on my work clothes and kiss my wife goodbye and drive to a coffee shop across town. I sit there on my laptop applying to jobs and doing freelance work and pretending everything is fine. I make enough from random gigs to keep the bills paid but just barely. Ive drained most of my savings and cashed out my retirement and were one bad month away from losing everything.

My wife thinks we have a healthy savings account. She thinks Im getting promoted soon. She talks about vacations we should take and renovations we should do and I just smile and nod and die inside.

My kids think their dad has this impressive career. My oldest is in college now and picked his major because he wants to be like me. He has no idea what im actually doing every day.

Ive gotten close to telling her so many times. Once I actually started the conversation and she looked so happy and trusting and I just couldnt do it. I changed it to something else.

I know this makes me a horrible person. I know Ive been lying to the people I love most for six years. I know when this all falls apart and it will my family will never look at me the same way.

He just rolls over and turns them off.

I (27) am unfortunately a morning person. I typically wake up anytime between 0530 to 0630. In my previous job, I could roll out of bed at 0700. I like to take the time in the morning to have my breakfast & do some knitting in order to prepare myself for work. I work in health & social care which is very emotionally demanding.

My partner (29) works IT for a bank, and WFH. He's always struggled to get up as his sleep has always been crap. He takes melatonin to help, but often times he ends up falling asleep late in the night which makes it hard for him to get up in the morning. Half the time, he has to get up in the night because of his blood sugar levels (he's a T1 diabetic) which, again, affects his sleep.

In my previous job, we were just \~7 minutes walk to my office so I could leave quite close to 0900 and it'd be fine. I often left before 0830 just to give me some quiet time before the hubbub so I could go through emails/spill over work from the day before.

Half of my partner's team is in a different timezone so by midday, half his team is off as it would be the end of the day there. He also consistently says that he's ""forgotten about"" so doesn't actually have any work to do. He mostly plays video games/watches YouTube when he's got nothing to do.

Now I've got a new job and it's at least a 40 minute commute on the bus, and the start is also earlier. I'd have to get up at 0600 latest if I want to maintain my morning routine and be out the house by 0715.

My partner has also consistently said that he wants to wake up earlier in the mornings as he feels better/more productive when he does.

If I continue to try and help him get up, it will eat into my morning routine so I won't get to have the easy start to my mornings which can leave me out of sorts.

WIBTA if I don't want to help my partner get up in the mornings around the same time as me? He regularly asks me to make coffee to help him get up, but even then, more than half the time he's back to snoring.",7,1767610520.0,AITAH,20,0.9,False

Which worked well for me, life changing. But this past month or so I have noticed the positive effects dwindle and all I am left with now is anxiety and the feeling of having drank too much coffee. Previously it made me feel calm, energised and focused. I felt more social and relaxed around people and more 'myself' it actually killed my anxiety and any depressed/dread feelings. Now, when I take it I feel jittery, stomach full of dread and anxious. This is making me very distractable, self conscious and not social at all. I can't focus on my work and have lost most of my motivation to do anything. 

What could be going on here? I'm on the combined pill, so I dont think this is hormonal and no signs of peri-menopause etc. I just feel shit and i've tried a day or two not taking them and feel the same but less anxious, just depressed and lethargic. I feel devestated at this sudden shift, I will try and get an appointment with my Doctor to discuss but its really difficult and may need to wait some time.

**A 19-year-old trainee barista at Hampstead’s popular eaterie The Coffee Cup was fired by his manager on Sunday afternoon, after adding cocoa powder froth in the alleged shape of swastika to a Jewish customer’s coffee.** 

Speaking to *Jewish News*, the 45-year old man from north London, who wishes to remain anonymous, explained that he “went out for breakfast this morning with my family. We decided to try and find somewhere to have a snack. We didn’t have a booking but managed to get into the Coffee Cup. I know it very well. They were very, very helpful and got us in.”

My wife ordered a cappuccino, and “when it landed, I saw that and said, ‘surely that is a swastika?”

The father of two “didn’t want to make a scene, though, normally I would, but I did call the manager over and said: ‘Listen, we’re Jewish, maybe visibly, so to me, that looks like a very obvious symbol, and we’re not okay with it.’ Fair to him, he was mortified.”

The general manager, Bekim Haradini, “took a picture of it himself, and he went into the kitchen, came back and said, ‘Listen, I’m absolutely sorry. I don’t think the intention is there at all. There was no intent there. We’ve got a trainee barista. He’s a 19 year old kid. He says he doesn’t even know what a swastika is himself. He was trying to do a swirl. We’re terribly, terribly sorry.'”

The customer adds: “That was the end of it, to be honest with you but it just goes to show how quickly something can escalate when it’s symbols like that. I didn’t necessarily need the kid fired, but I wanted him to at least acknowledge that it was not OK, which he did: very, very quickly. The management were great about it.”

Confirming the incident occurred today, general manager Bekim Haradini told *Jewish News*: “This has never happened before. I was really upset. I fired him. He’s young, and he started to cry and was shaking, but I got so upset. I fired him. He’s no longer working here.”

The young man, called Mesut, working at the venue on weekends, told his boss he didn’t know what he had created, with Haradini claiming: “He said he didn’t know. I said, ‘What do you mean you didn’t know?’ He said, ‘I swear I didn’t do it.”

*Jewish News* has reviewed the CCTV footage of the coffee being prepared and found no evidence that the swastika was created deliberately.

The manager, clearly upset, added that he wanted to demonstrate to Jewish customers how seriously he had taken the incident.

“I did take immediate action. He was lucky, because I got so upset and I’ve got a really bad temper. I kicked him out straight away.”

Haradini doesn’t believe the barista knew what he was doing “because it’s never happened before. I’ve seen him making flowers when he was doing designs in the cappuccinos.”

In a text to Mesut seen by *Jewish News*, Haradini wrote: “Because of this sign, you’re fired. I know you didn’t mean it, but I just can’t stand it.”

The Jewish father adds: “I didn’t see who made the coffee. Ultimately, if there was intent, then I’m glad he got fired. If there wasn’t, then it’s a really harsh lesson for the kid. Symbols carry weight whether we like it or not.

“I wouldn’t hesitate going back to the Coffee Cup. I don’t think there’s a problem there with antisemitism and I’d like to thank the management again for taking the matter so seriously.”

Hampstead High Street’s Coffee Cup was established in 1954.

1q4ico5,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostlove/comments/1q4ico5/the_next_morning/,The Next Morning,"For those that sent awesome messages, thank you. Upon request, this is about the first full morning she spent at my place after our second date. I know my timeline isn’t in order, but it works for me.

For Ashley

26 OCT 2008

We had gotten home around 2:30 a.m., buzzing from the night. I kicked off my shoes in the entryway, and while Ashley was in the kitchen grabbing water, I headed to the bedroom to change into more comfortable clothes.

I woke up to the weight I’d been dreaming about for nine straight months. She was exactly where she belonged: her head on my shoulder, one arm flung across my chest like she was staking claim, and her leg was thrown over me the way it would be thousands of more mornings.

The room smelled like her - that Japanese cherry blossom scent from a certain bodyworks store that I swear she owned stock in. It was her favorite and one I can still smell late at night when I swear I can hear her whispering to me - and something I still can’t name that was just Ashley being alive in my house.

She was still wearing my UGA T-shirt from the night before - the one I’d wore on that second date. For some reason she ended up in it that night. It had ridden up to her waist sometime in the night showing her, um, perfect athletic butt. Her dog tags would bump against me every time she moved.

Then she stirred, made this tiny half-sleep noise (part sigh, part growl), and burrowed closer.
Her first real words of the morning were muffled against my neck: “Five more minutes, the Army can’t have me back yet.”

I laughed so hard - for some reason I found that hilarious. She answered by biting my shoulder (not hard, just enough to say mine) and then lifting her head, hair everywhere, eyes still puffy and gave me the laziest, happiest smile I’d ever seen on a human being.

“Hi,” she whispered, like she was seeing me for the first time all over again.

“Hi yourself, soldier.”

She kissed me slow, sleepy, morning-breath and all, then laid her head back down exactly where it had lived in my imagination for nine months.
We stayed like that until the sun was high enough to paint gold stripes across her back.
Eventually hunger won.

She went into the kitchen in nothing but that T-shirt, opened the fridge, looked at the sad bachelor contents, and announced: “We’re fixing this today. Grocery store. Then Thai take-out. Then back to bed. Acceptable?”

I just nodded like an idiot. She made coffee (black, two sugars, exactly the way I like it without asking), handed me a mug, then climbed right back on top of me on the couch like it was the most natural thing in the world.

No missions. No countdown chains. No nine-thousand-mile lag on the phone. Just her heartbeat syncing up with mine, the dog sniffing her feet like she’d always belonged there, and the quiet, perfect realization that every letter, every “13 and a wake-up,” every dream of this exact moment had been 100% accurate. She was finally, undeniably, no-going-back home.

And that morning tasted like coffee, Thai takeout at 11 a.m., and the sweetest silence two people have ever shared.

I have very few issues getting to sleep, I’m more than aware my phone usage is the issue and I’m getting better about it. I can now get to sleep before 10pm.

My main issue is staying asleep. As soon as I’ve had my 30 minutes of deep sleep a night (I never seem to be able to get more than that) I will then wake up every 10 to 30 minutes, be awake for 10 minutes and then get back to sleep. It really messes with my sleep cycle.

I’m having so many interruptions I’m spending 11 hours in bed and only sleeping for 6 of them.

No amount of exercise fixes this, no amount of activity during the day helps. Mindfulness can go in the bin. I already avoid coffee and big meals. There’s no particular sound or sensation waking me up. I just can’t stay asleep no matter how exhausted I am.

This makes it so much harder to get up out of bed because I’m not rested.

I take a handful of vitamin and mineral supplements, 27, IS, on an opioid based painkiller which you think would help. I have autism, ADHD, CFS/ME, EDS, and PoTS/VVS. All of which could be contributing.

My mattress and bed are due to be replaced but they’re not that bad. I use blackout blinds overnight and a sunlight lamp in the morning.

1q4ibr4,https://i.redd.it/ylus356ndibg1.png,"Hello My Friend,","Hello my friend,

I don’t know if this will find you on a good day or a heavy one, but I wanted to send it anyway.

I know you’ve been through more than most people realize. I know there were seasons where just getting through the day took everything you had. If it doesn’t always feel like it now, that doesn’t mean you imagined it. It just means you’re finally starting to come up for air.

I used to think love would be louder. That healing would come with answers or a clear sign that the hard part was over. But I’m learning that the love that matters most doesn’t announce itself. It stays. It sits quietly beside you. It doesn’t rush you toward being “better.” It lets you be exactly where you are.

You survived by being gentle. By bending instead of breaking. By learning how to love in smaller ways when the big ones hurt too much. There’s nothing weak about that. There’s wisdom in it. You learned how to rest without quitting, how to stay soft without disappearing. Not everyone knows how to do that.

If becoming feels slow right now, that’s okay. Becoming often looks like unlearning. Like thanking old versions of yourself for getting you this far and finally letting them go. Growth doesn’t need urgency. It just needs honesty.

Some days, gratitude won’t feel like joy. Some days it will look like a quiet cup of coffee, or sunlight on the floor, or realizing your shoulders aren’t tense anymore. Peace doesn’t need to be earned after what you’ve been through. It just needs to be noticed when it shows up.

You don’t need to be more than you are to deserve rest. You don’t need to justify your limits or apologize for your softness. You are enough in your effort, in your pauses, in the way you’re learning to speak to yourself more kindly.

Healing isn’t linear. It loops back. It revisits old rooms. Sometimes it asks you to forgive yourself for the things you did just to survive. That isn’t failure. That’s practice. That’s being human.

If no one has told you lately, you’re doing better than you think. Even in the uncertainty. Even in the places that still feel tender. You’re showing up. And that counts for more than you know.

You are not behind. You are not broken. You are becoming.

And I’m really glad you’re still here.

With love,

1q4ia3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1q4ia3z/feeling_very_lonely/,Feeling very lonely,"Hi! This is a vent and a search for advice. Please excuse me if it is very long and a bit confusing, english is not my native language.

I'm 27TF, very shy and also neurodivergent, which makes it very difficult for me to socialize to the point that during my childhood the mere fact of introducing myself to strangers could make me nauseous. Over the years I have worked on that and today I can have somewhat of a normal life but I hardly have any friends, let alone a girlfriend

The thing is, last year my only two real-life friends got married (not to each other, hehe) and moved to different countries. While I'm happy for them, I won't deny that I've felt lonely, even abandoned. When I talk to them, I try to downplay it so I don't worry them or make them feel guilty. Of course, they're still my best friends, and we talk practically every day by text or videocall, but I no longer have anyone to grab coffee with, have dinner, go for a walk or anything like that.

I know the ideal way is to go out and connect with new people, but it's not that easy, not only because of my shyness, which doesn't help at all. I live in a relatively small city where there are hardly any queer spaces; there are only a couple of gay bars (none specifically lesbian), and besides, I don't like them. At 18, I went to a regular bar with some classmates, and the music, the people, the lights, everything, my neurodivergent brain couldn't take it anymore, and I ended up crying, plus, I don't drink alcohol, which doesn't help either.

And when you look for a get-together for a hobby or activity, there are practically none, or if there are, they're very closed off. My city has a bad reputation within the country for having very cold inhabitants, and it's not a lie. Because of this, approaching someone randomly on the street just doesn't happen, at best, they'll assume you want to sell them something and ignore you.

So my only options are to take a 3-4 hour trip to a bigger city to attend an event, which usually takes place in the afternoon and ends at night, and struggle returning by public transport since it gets scarce and dangerous after dark  (I don't have a car), or to suck up to my neurodivergence and go to a bar in my city, despite how much I would suffer through the experience.

And all this is just about making friends, I gave up on love a long time ago. I haven't been on a date in over seven years, damn, no one has ever tried to hit on me, like ever, and I'm too shy and a bottom to approach anyone myself I'd probably pass out, but I digress.

Anyway, thanks for taking the time to read my ramblings, and I would appreciate your advice",1,1767609067.0,actuallesbians,0,0.6,False
