Hey everyone. I’m 33 and born and raised in Michigan. I’ve never really posted here before, but I’m trying to branch out and meet new people to chat with, vibe with, and hopefully build some simple, genuine connections.

A little about me:
I’m big into anything outdoors when the weather’s good like  hiking, kayaking, camping, all that good stuff. Once winter hits though, I fully switch into homebody mode. Give me reading, good coffee, TV show binges, and warm cuddles with the right person and I’m set.

I’m a friendly, laid back guy who can get pretty goofy once I’m comfortable. I love sarcasm and I’m always down for good conversation, whether it’s light, funny, or deeper “talk for hours” type stuff.

If you’re looking for someone to chat with, get to know, share random thoughts with, or just build a chill friendship, feel free to message me.

Looking forward to meeting some new people.",1,1765404810.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,2,1.0,False
1pjg840,https://i.redd.it/qee9ms2kag6g1.jpeg,Tested the Adaptive v2 profile - what is your favorite Gaggimate Pro profile?,"I've been running the **Cremina profile** as my daily driver for a while now (mostly for classic darker roasts), but I finally decided to switch it up and test the **Adaptive v2 profile**.

**My takeaway:** The shot behavior is definitely distinct. The way it manages the pressure peak and then adapts the flow to handle puck degradation feels much more modern than the lever-style profiles but taste-wise i might still prefer the Cremina profile

I recorded the extraction and the real-time graph here if you want to see how the software handled the flow curve:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv2hQlJ3cV0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv2hQlJ3cV0)

If you fail an exam, you will be okay. You can re-take the class if you need to. Your professors will work with you.

If you can’t do the best presentation ever, you’ll still have a presentation! And you will be okay! If you need an extension, if you need to present the last day instead of the first day, they will understand (or I will fight them).

If you can’t get everything done right now it’s okay. You’ll be okay. 

You might want to see your family, you might not want to see your family, you will be okay. 

Everything won’t always be this stressful. You’ll literally look back like a week from now and sigh, smile, maybe drink a coffee or some tea, and relax. Everything will be okay!

I know people say that CAPS sucks, that’s why I didn’t go until I went the other day for the first time. If you need someone to talk to, if you need to cry for an hour, squeeze some sensory toys, they’ve got everything you need. Nobody will look down on you for visiting, and they won’t charge you. Taking care of your brain is just as much if not more important than taking care of your body.

Make sure you’re eating, make sure you’re sleeping, and give your brain some rest periods during your cramming. All over campus they’ve been giving out free coffee and hot chocolate, go walk around and explore a building you haven’t been in before.

The knowledge lab is a great place to de-stress, I love it there. You can draw, knit, paint, make a shirt, do whatever you’ve wanted to try but haven’t had enough time. It’s okay if you plan on studying for something for 16 hours, to cut an hour off and focus on yourself, what you want to do. 

College isn’t so make-it-or-break-it. It has its ups and downs but it’s alright, you’ve done everything you could up to this point (and it’s okay to miss some assignments, to get some bad grades, it’s human). 

You are a sack of meat and water and bones. All you’re doing is letting the bad chemicals in your brain get to you. 

Take some deep breaths, go get a coffee or a tea or something. You’re going to be alright.",4,1765404400.0,Purdue,1,1.0,False

First they made us wait an hour on the boarding line. It was because the plane is late, then it was because they were changing tires. After entering the plane, we were delayed yet another half an hour. This time they made up a story about a passanger forgetting a powerbank in the luggage. After a little longer, they said the flight is cancelled because Dusseldorf Airport doesn't work after 23:00. We left the plane and waited another half an hour or longer for explanation. They said they postponed the flight to 4:55, exactly 5 minutes before it becomes 8 hours delay :] so they don't have to give us accommodation or any reimbursement. They said they will take care of us, told us to follow. They said we can eat anything we want but we ended up at a fastfood area where they made a deal with the companies and we are only allowed to get the standard menu they agreed for :D When we asked to use lounge, they said ""what for? We gave you food, this is all you get"" I didn't even register the rudeness in that moment so I didn't say anything. But is this really it? I am supposed to sit 8 hours sleepless in the cold?

1pjg2bf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pjg2bf/a_rumrun_through_carcosa_log_2/,A Rum-run Through Carcosa: Log 2,"15th March, 1925

First Mate: Ulysses O’Neil

Time: Appears to be dusk

Location: Carcosa?

Vessel: *Outis*

Report:

  •Six souls onboard

•Engine destroyed

•All clocks stopped, the compass is spinning, and mercury is frozen in the thermometer

•Fog encircles the vessel, there is no current, and the temperature feels higher than 30℃ 

•One crewmember detained



Personal Notes:

Pyke did not explain his meaning when he said we were in Carcosa. After uttering the word, he returned to his own cabin. He held a reverence for the word, as if it were forbidden to even know it. It looked as if there was a physical atonement after having this knowledge brought back. His age showed; with a hunched back and bagged eyes, he went away.

I went to the bridge to write my account of the previous day, but I looked at the instrumentation first. The compass spun rapidly, and the clock on the wall read 3:03. I looked at the thermometer on the wall and saw condensation around the red marks. It was still marked at 3℃, but it was so cold it burnt the tip of my finger when I touched the glass. Hot enough to sweat, but cold enough to freeze mercury. Instinctively, I muttered a small prayer.

I wrote my first mate's report, in my head, trying to make sense of our situation and Pyke's unusual demeanor. It felt early in the morning, though by that point the sun showed through the now gray fog as if it were midday. I finished my report and went back down to the deck. Mr. Peter was on the deck, leaning on the side, smoking a cigarette, looking far less green than the last time I saw him. Sweat stains were under his Oxford shirt, his velvet red vest looked newly tailored. 

“Signore,” he said to me, “do you mind telling me why we are no longer moving?” his voice had a hidden danger in the simple question. 

“The engine is flooded.”

“Then unflood it.”

“We need to get the water out of the hull first.”

“Then get the water out.”

“I’m working on it, but the shipment may be delayed on account that I have no clue where we are.”

“Then figure out where we are, unflood the hull, and fix that engine.” Danger was no longer hidden from his voice.

“I'll see what I can do,” jaw was clenched, fist balled. I didn’t much appreciate his tone.

As I passed by him, Lee came out of the crew cabin, “Fuck, it's hot,” he said, cracking his back. His eyes centered on me, “Has Pyke talked to you?” 

“He has, ye?” 

“Something about being in Carcosa, whatever the hell that means. Once the engine went out, he told me to hit the bed. I would say he lost a screw if it wasn't hot as hell in March, dead calm, and your crazy ass didn't see a damn ghost last night,” 

“We can figure out what he means later. For now, wake Jim and John, we need to start getting the water out,” I wanted to focus on what I could control in the moment. 

“Oh, come on, I just woke up, Paddy. Don't your kind drink tea or something in the morning?”

“Wake them, Lee,”

“Fine,” he turned towards the door. “Fuckin' mick,” I heard him mutter under his breath.

“Would you like to repeat that, Mr. Lee?” My tone was controlled

He paused for a moment, not even turning to face me. With the pose of a scared cat, he returned back into the crew quarters. A little while later, he emerged with the others.

Water was up to my knees when I was in the hull. The crew knew how long of a day we were about to have, but we needed to work. I scooped water and passed it back to John behind me, who passed it to Lee on the deck, where Jim tossed it overboard. For hours, we went at it, my hands becoming raw and my back stiff. We took a break when the water was halfway, splitting two cans of salted meat and sharing burnt coffee. It took most of the day to get the water down to only a few centimeters. Pyke remained in his cabin, Mr. Peter watched like a guard over a chain gang, the sun stayed in the same place even after what had to have been nine hours. 

When we finished, I went to check on Pyke, while Lee went to make his initial assessment of the engine. Outside the Captain's quarters door, I heard what sounded like the ramblings of a madman.

“Dear lord… he who wears the yellow robe… he who calls for the lost ones…”  

Before I heard more, I knocked, “Pyke, the crew…”

“Leave me be!” A voice filled with boiling annoyance.

Recoiling as if slapped, I stared at the door. Never had I seen him yell like that, especially towards me. So I left him be and went for dinner.

“Mr Ulysses,” John approached while I ate canned beef on stale bread.

“Yes, John?”

“Lee told me… he told me the engine is dead. It took in too much water,” his voice cracked with nervousness. 

I looked at him; he was visibly scared but trying to hide it. “Thank ye, John, I'll see what we can do,” I said, hiding my nerves behind a real veil of fatigue. 

“Mr. Ulysses… where exactly is carcosa?,”

Standing up and forcing what I remembered to be a comforting small smile, “I don't know, but Pyke has been sailing since before I was born. I've sailed with him for nearly six years, I believe he surely knows what to do,” I said with a pat on his shoulder, “go eat something, it's important to keep your strength and wits,” with which I left him.

I found Lee in the engine room, yelling every expletive. 

“What do you mean she's dead?”

“The whore of a machine took on too much fuckin’ water,” he smacked the engine with his wrench and screamed in frustration. He then turned his head back towards me as we both remained crouched in the small room, “Has Pyke fuckin’ come out yet?,” 

“No, he told me to leave him be when I knocked on his cabin,” 

“What the hell is wrong with him? I expect that lazy wop to not help, hell even the darkie is doing work, but this is Pyke’s damn ship,” 

“Can't you go through one conversation without being an absolute bastard?”

“Oh no, touch a never Paddy? Sorry, didn't realize you had such a ‘delicate constitution’, learn to take a fuckin’ joke,”

I wanted to break his nose right there, “what did Pyke tell you on the bridge this morning?,” 

“I already told you, when the water went flat and the engine died, he just said that word and told me to leave him alone,” 

I nodded my head, “alright, just do what you can here,” I paused, “and Lee, I won't refrain from beating ye like a dog if I here ye talk bad about the crew again,”

 His eyes widened as I left the engine room.

Back on the deck I saw Jim fishing overside, John was eating on the deck, and Mr. Peter walked towards me, “Signore, why am I hearing the engine is dead?,” his voice was low.

“Cause it is,”

“Fix it,” 

“That's beyond my expertise, and Lee is the only one on here that knows anything about engines,”

“That cargo needs to be in Manhattan in two days,”

“It's appears that won't happen,”

“Make it happen…” 

“Unless if you know more about petrol engines than Lee, then we will remain stranded for the time being,” 

Mr. Peter then muttered something in Italian, most likely cursing my name, as he took his vest off, rolled up his sleeves and went into the hull. Turns out he did know more about petrol engines than Lee.

I counted our food supplies, two weeks of food and water, and could make it last four weeks with rationing. Jim had caught a blue gill and was cooking it on the stove in the crew cabin. I would rather not rely on the fickleness of a drunk fisherman though, and that doesn't solve our water supply. With the whiskey we could make the water last, but Mr. Peter doesn't seem like he would be up for us to take from his supply. 

After, I was smoking a cigarette on deck, the sun was finally setting, that's when Pyke left his cabin. He was stumbling, leaning on walls and rails, his glassy eyes and heavy breathing rang of drunkenness.

Jim just finished eating, John came out of the bridge, Pyke looked confused as he stumbled and spoke low to himself. 

“Sir, are you alright?” I asked with concern for the old captain's well-being. His eyes pierced with what looked like shock, fear and rage when he saw me. He lifted his drunken trembling finger at me. 

“Death! Take this crew before his hands grip our souls!” he turned to John, “for these are the innocent, and have no knowledge on the godless happenin's the King has brought upon,” he stumbled and I caught him, “his grip is closing on our souls… her song tempts, but has no love, he feasts for his hunger is eternal,” Lee and Mr. Peter appear from the hull hearing the commotion.

“The fuck is this?” Lee said with confusion,

Pyke stood up and looked at Lee, “Have you journeyed to the springs of the sea or walked in the recesses of the deep?” his voice boomed out. He then looked towards me, falling forward as he gripped my shirt, tears formed in the corners of his eyes as he stared at me.

“That seasoned veteran cursed by fate so long,” eyes then falling shut, “oh Ulysses, the unluckiest man alive,” his words drifted off.

John and I carried him into his cabin with no words passed, both silently agreeing it was drunken knownsense, but what he had said gnawed at me. Two emptied bottles of single malt lay on his desk with one halfway finished. His journal was open with scribbles of swirling symbols, fishmen, strange words I've never seen, sketches of an impossible city of swirls and organics, names like Dagon and “The King in yellow,”. That last one had a sense of distant familiarity, a title I've known without hearing.

We gathered on the deck, Lee and John bickered over Pyke's words. Mr. Peter watched with his now grease stained oxford as he smoked. Jim stood behind in silence. 

“Pyke is out for now. Lee and Mr. Peter, anything on the engine?” I asked.

“There might be some hope, we have the water out, but the plugs are shot… I might be able to find a solution.” Mr. Peter said in the tone of a soldier.

“Wait, are we not going to talk about what just happened?” John asked with disbelief.

“What is there to talk about? When he sobers we can ask him, but for now we need to focus on what is in our control. Peter please continue.”

Mr. Peter was about to continue before Lee spoke up, “woah who made you captain?” looking at me.

“With Pyke out I am acting captain,” I said to Lee, which made him scoff.

“Listen your type are made to take orders, let someone of the right stock actually take the lead,” 

I clenched my jaw, I was far too tired and frankly frightened to deal with his behavior at the moment, “We have an order of command Mr. Lee, I would advise ye follow it,” 

“You ain't in the king's army no more, anyway, aren't micks used to following a proper anglo-saxon, that is what your type is bred for,” he smirked, I lunged, we ended up on the deck. My fist landed on his eye, then his mouth. His lip busted instantly. He kneed my gut and punched my jaw. John pulled me off of him as Mr. Peter made sure to keep Lee on the ground with a .38 handgun he had hidden in his pocket. 

“Go fuck yourselves, I knew having a violent goddamned paddy onboard was bad luck!” Lee yelled up, Mr. Peter gave him a good kick.

“I recommend you remain silent Signore,” he said with a reserved distance, then he saw me with my heaving chest, “you should be smarter than that,” 

Before I could respond there was a thump on the deck behind us. Jim was on his back convulsing violently. His head slammed against the wood as his mouth foamed and his arms and legs flayed. John and I rushed to him. 

“Jim what's happening?” John asked. 

His head bashed on the wood, leaving arches of blood on each impact. I grabbed a life preserver and placed it under his head. Mr. Peter and Lee joined us surrounding Jim. I held his shoulders, unsure of what to do.

Jim stopped suddenly, he lay flat on the ground as his spit dribbled out of his mouth down both his cheeks and absorbed into his beard. 

“Jim?” Lee cautiously asked, “is he alive?”

 I knelt down and placed my finger under his jaw, I could feel a pulse. “He's alive,” I turned my head to look at the others, when I felt a hand wrap around my wrist. I turned my head back and saw Jim's eyes open. His face was etched in fury. 

“Where is she!” he yelled, his nails digging into my wrist, I felt blood trickle down my fingers.

“Jim calm down and let go,” I said, trying to pry his hand from my wrist. His grip tightened more and his other hand gripped my shirt. 

“THE WOMAN SINGING, WHERE DID SHE GO!?” he pulled my shirt till it ripped. John pulled me back by my shoulders, but Jim’s grip was too tight on my wrist. He then heaved and gagged, his eyes never leaving mine. A black bile shot from his mouth, covering my face, neck and chest. 

Lee kicked Jim’s chest, causing him to release his grip, sending John and I back. I fell on my arse while John caught himself on the side. Blooexplainrm, and when I looked up Jim was galloping on all fours as he charged toward Lee. He tackled him and started clawing at his chest, seemingly not feeling any of Lee's defensive blows to his face and ribs. 

Mr. Peter raised his pistol at Jim, I jumped to my feet and hit him in his gut before he could get a shot off, knocking the pistol from his hand after. I was not going to lose a crewmember. Jim had clawed through Lee's shirt and started leaving deep bloody marks with his finger nails on his chest. Not stopping after I hit Mr. Peter I used my momentum and flung my full body weight at Jim. My arms wrapped around his body as we clashed to the ground, I wrapped my legs around his knees, and put my arms under his arms and held his head from behind. 

“YOU'RE HIDING HER FROM ME YOU WHORE SONS!” Jim screamed as he struggled against my hold. 

“Rope!” I yelled at the others. 

John quickly grabbed the strands of rope we used on the door the day prior. Jim started to vomit more onto the deck, leaving an oily slick in front of him. Jim scratched my arms as I held him down, while Mr. Peter and John tied his legs together. I let go of my hold and pulled his arms behind him. We tied his hands behind.

“Oh Fuck, you queer sap!” Lee screamed as he laid on his back, “what the hell was that you fat blotto trash?” 

I stood above Jim, panting and looking down, “Jim! What was that?”

He stopped struggling against the bindings, and then started crying, “Why did you take her away… damn you all,” he then started getting choked on his sobs. 

Jim couldn't speak as his cries grew more and more. Carrying him to Pyke's cabin and setting him down on the deck. We dragged the still drunken Pyke from his bed, he rambled half awake as Lee took him to the crew quarters. Jim wriggled his body as we placed him on the bed. I grabbed Pyke's old Winchester model 1897 from the wall with four boxes of buckshot and brought it out with me. Mr. Peter grabbed one of the broken poles and jammed the door shut.

I filled a bucket with salt water and stripped down to my undergarments. I cleaned off putrid black bile from myself with a rag. Lee poured whiskey over his chest wounds and dressed them with bandages. I grabbed the bottle from Lee and poured it down my arm. It stung, but with the proof it should be enough to disinfect. I then wrapped my arm. Lee and I didn't say a word, a silent agreement that we have more pressing issues. I admit his swollen eye and split lip was a sweet catharsis.

John called me into the crew quarters, holding his nose shut when he showed me the fish Jim had eaten. It looked uncooked, bloated and a rotten gray to it. Bite marks were on its side, and small worms flicked out of the slush of its flesh. I tossed it overboard. 

The four of us gathered on the bridge, the sun seemed to hang at sunset for a few hours now, we were all exhausted. John smoked the first cigarette I've seen him smoke. I guess we all needed one.

“The fish was uncooked?” Lee said with disbelief, “I saw him cooking…” 

“I saw it when he caught it too, it was not dead, hell it was actually a good catch. Do we know if it was the fish?,” John interrupted. 

“It had to be,” I interjected, “it was the only thing Jim ate or drank that each of us hadn't,”

“What about Pyke? He was losing it last time we saw him,” Lee added, “and he ain't had no fish,”

“He seemed more loaded than anything, Jim wasn't quoting scripture or doing a christ in the temple act,” I puffed on my cigarette, “it must surely be the fish”
	
“Then what the hell is wrong with Pyke?” Lee said, his eye now a purplish brown.

“He knows something, I heard him praying to something…it didn't sound like the hate Jim had, and he didn't attack us.” I add, still defending the old captain.

“Diàvulu,” Mr. Peter said taking a drag from his cigarette, “Signores, lu Diàvulu has this ship in his eyes,” 

Lee threw his hands up, “The hell does devolo mean?” 

“He means the devil…and I wish we were so lucky,” Pyke's voice said from the doorway. 

We all turned toward him, he was tipsily leaning on the doorway, but the light in his eyes seemed to have returned. Crossing the room he joined our circle.

“Sorry for my absence, I just couldn't believe I was here again,” he said with a battered pain in his words. He let out a sigh and stood as straight as he could, “We are in Carcosa… this is a place both God and the Devil fear. This is neither Heaven, Hell, or the Earth,” stroking his beard, he chose his words carefully, “I've been here before, in ‘98, we were stranded while patrolling the Cuban shores… My captain was first to go. He said The King in Yellow had spoken to him, gave him the path home,” his jaw clenched, “described our destination as beautiful dread, harmful bliss… we thought he was mad, but then we saw him,” his eyes became distant, “faces on faces is how he looked, mangled flesh of tentacles of man. And he fought for us, fought for our eternity, as others joined the fray for our pointlessly drastic lives,” his voice dropped, “beings older than our world… older than the Lord. We are in Dagon's realm, we heed their calls for it's the only path we have,” he stopped and thought for a moment, “we wrecked upon land, or I had a wreck. I can't remember if the rest of the crew was alive or dead then. A great phallic monolith stuck from the reef on which I was stranded. Visages of changed people were carved on its length. Images of the Children of Dagon. Then it came. A titan of the sea crawled from the waters and slung its arms around the monument.”

Lee spoke up, “What are you talking about? None of that meant anything,” 

Pyke's face turned to rage, “If you don't listen to my words then your soul is already lost!” he then slowed, “The devil tricks ya, God loves ya…they take ya,” his eyes went over each and everyone of us, “hold onto ya soul, for ya body will fail, ya minds will madden, and ya heart may give in.” 

His rambling left us silent, he chortled low, “ya will see, for I remember being here, know I've seen them, they are called The Old Ones.” he sat down, “the problem however, when I bring back those memories I forget them. As if the mind makes you forget the terror, relegating it to a long forgotten nightmare.”

He sighed the looked around, “For now we have to find a way out,” his eyes landed on Lee, “how goes repairs?”

“We maybe able to fix it, Peter and I worked on it earlier, he gave same insight,”

“My name is Dante… I think we are past the point of aliases,” Dante cut in, “I have worked on tractors since I was a boy, and fixed engines during the war,” he said to nobody in particular. 

“Ya and Lee fix the engine, use whatever ye can,” Pyke turned to me, “how are supplies?”

“Four weeks if begin to ration now,”

“Good…Mr. John stay next to Mr. Ulysses, nobody is to be left alone,” 

“Yes sir,”

Pyke looked at us all, “Get rest now if ye 
need it, I'll stay up and make sure nothing happens,” 

I admit his explanation for where we are sounded so fantastical that it left a sour taste in my mouth. His words were nearly, if not wholly blasphemous. It sounded more like dancing around than a true answer. I kept my thoughts to myself, with the rest of the crew seemingly placid in his words.

The four of us shuffled into the crew quarters, we all settled into our hammocks. Sleep came quickly that night.

Rounds hit the ground around me as I ran across the shell battered field. Men were stuck up to their knees in mud as rounds peppered them. I passed a young man, his intestines poured out of him as he screamed for his mother. A man to my right in front of me was hit in his neck, an artery torn, a gallon must have poured out instantly as he tensed up and fell back to the ground. Private Stantoun ahead of me dropped like a bag of grain as his brain exploded from the back of his head. There was no time to concern myself with his death, with the death of a man I knew since I was a boy. Explosions sent limbs flying through the air, but I had only hoped to make it to cover. Men dived into craters with what looked like shallow water, but became engulfed into the mud, while anyone who attempted to help them got chewed by the Fritz's MGs. 

“For King and Coun…,” a man was blown to hell before finishing.
	
Screams of men charging, death rattles, the smack of lead tearing raw flesh. Snapping of bones when men got stuck in the mud at full sprint. Cries for help being silenced by the whistle of the officers behind. I only focused ahead. 

Running I saw the corpse of a rotting horse strung in barbed wire. I dove down just when I heard bullets hit the rotting side. I held my enfield to my chest as I tried to compose myself. The German line was close. To my surprise the lad had followed me this far. He was hyperventilating when he reached me, tears spilled down his face.

“I can't go… I can't go…I can't go,” he repeated over and over. 

“Just hang on, don't give into dread son…,” I gripped his shoulder, “slow your breath, panic won't save you. Courage lad, no panic, don’t hang back” 

He eased his breathing, and looked at me. His tear swollen eyes were far too innocent, “sorry sir… please excuse me…” he was so young, those eyes pleading for help. I was going to tell him he was going to be alright, he was going to see his home, but suddenly an explosion went off behind his back and I went out. 

I awoke in the hammock, sun light shined through the port hole, but there was no way to tell what time of day it truly was. I grabbed the Winchester and hung the strap over my shoulder as I stepped onto the deck. 

Pyke was yelling into the hull, he looked sober, “I don't care if it takes ya arm, just get that damned engine working!” he then heard me approaching, “Mr. Ulysses, go get Mr. Jim some food and water. And tell me if he continues to talk about that woman he heard,” I simply nodded and went back to the crew cabin. 

I woke John, got a can of corned beef and water, then stepped back onto the deck. To our surprise the Albatross was back, she now stood in front of Pyke's cabin.

“I thought you were telling fibs when you told of a bird that big,” John said, his voice filled with fascination.

It squawked at us, “I don't lie son,” I said, staring down the bird, “Go on!” I yelled at it, “ye get moving!”

When I stepped closer it clapped its beaks at me and held its wings out. How bright that sea bird's eyes were. Opening the can I tossed a couple pieces of beef. That made her move.

“Why didn't you just kick it or hit it with your gun?” John asked.

“It’s best not to hurt creatures that don’t deserve it, and I believe we best not make Neptune have any more disdain towards us. He tends to not take kindly to those who needlessly harm his creatures,” I said, handing John the food and water, then pulling the pole wedged in the handle.

Entering the room we were hit with the smell of rotting fish and human shit. Jim was still where we left him, but Pyke's bed was covered in his slick vomit. John audibly gagged, Jim let out a soft whimpered cry. 

“Is she back?” His voice was hoarse.

“Will you attack me if I untie you?” I asked.

“Are you still hiding her?”

“There is no her Jim,”

“LAIR!” he raged and he struggled against his bindings, his wrist were raw and chaffed.

“Jim settle down, we need ye to eat,” stretching out the can to him. When my hand neared him, he bit towards me. I pulled my hand back. 

“You keep her for yourself, you think I don't know what's happening?” Jim said, his lips black and chapped from his acidic upheaves. 

“Jim we need ye to eat,” I said again calmly, “I know you thought you saw a woman, but it's been the same people onboard,” 

He spit onto the bed, a tooth was with the dark snot, “do you not hear her? She calls for you, calls for your return,” his voice was a whimper.

“Who is she, Jim? Where did you see her?” I humored him.

“She was whispering in Lee's ear, before you attacked him. You wanted her, and your jealousy over took you, you needed her song in your ear,” 

“That's not the reason I attacked him Jim… please just eat,” I said with a pleading edge

He bit into his cheek then spit out the chunk onto the bed. His teeth now dark and crimson, “I NEED HER ODYSSEUS! I HEARD THE MUSE SONG. THE MUSE CALLING ME, CALLING YOU!” blood splattered with his spit. 

“Jim!” John yelled in shock

“SHE SUNG YOUR SONG! SHE TOLD OF A MAN WHO WENT TO WAR, AND LEFT HIS WIFE AND CALF BEHIND TO THEIR FATE!” His eyes narrowed on me, I felt punched in the chest, “TEN YEARS YOU SAIL FOR ITHACA! FOUR YEARS SHE CRIED YOUR NAME! AND NOW YOU SAIL TO HASTUR TO SPITE HER!” his voice was strained.

I backed away as the room started spinning around me. Cold water replaced my blood as I neared the door. 

Warmth, I needed warmth.

The throbbing of my heart filled my ears. I never told Jim of my past, I never even told Pyke about the boy. How did he know? I gripped the side of the vessel, my breathing coming in rapidly. What was happening to me? Why am I sweating? Why did my heart sound like the thud of artillery? Why did I shake from just words, why did this bring me back to dead days?

“Ulysses?” John said from behind, “are you alright?” 

I looked up into the gray sky, my breath coming in ragged. My eyes then focused on something. Something small, almost unseen as it came near me. A mite-sized particle, a weightless grain of sand.

“He was just talking applesauce, he's gone mad,” John tried to offer his reasoning, but my eyes followed this small object as it floated down. 

It floated down, passing my nose and gently landing on my knuckle. I brought it up to my face before it melted away.

Looking for a projector recommendation based on my needs. 

I do music in small spaces (think experimental stuff at small art galleries and coffee shops), and am looking to incorporate visuals like abstract patterns, color washes, etc. 

Given my needs, here are my priorities: 

1. Portability
2. Bright enough for a small art space 
3. Ability to cast on a wide variety of surfaces
4. Shorter casting length, if possible

As I am doing vague color washes and stuff in a variety of settings and lighting conditions, definition and clarity is much less of a priority. If people are able to see colors come in and out, that's all I need. 

Budget: ideally under 500, 800 tops. 

Please let me know if you have and suggestions. Thanks!

I mean I guess it's basically something I've kind of known my whole life but never put a name to. The only official diagnosis that I have is anxiety, but I'm pretty sure there's maybe something else going on.

  
I realized I definitely didn't think like other people when I was in an airbnb with 9 other people. The airbnb was a townhouse, so technically it could've been rented out as 2 separate two bedroom houses, an upper and a lower. I was staying on the upper.

  
We had all spent the whole morning together, which was already a disaster. I woke up at 5am, as I usually do, and the next person woke up at 7. Not a problem for me. In fact, everyone was up by around 8. But then. Nothing happened. For two full hours. Everyone just sat there. Chit chatting. Until 10 am. I had been up for 5 hours at that point. I was so beyond antsy. Picture 9 people sitting outside on the patio (and yes, they were all for some reason on the UPSTAIRS patio, my space), and me, inside in the kitchen, just waiting for some kind of movement to happen.

  
Then we finally go out, have breakfast, sitesee, shop, whatever. We get home around 3, and everyone starts cooking. At once. Upstairs and downstairs. I realized there was some kind of rhythm happening around me that I simply could not be a part of. All I could do was make sure that the upstairs kitchen and coffee maker was clean so that if nothing else, the following morning I could have my coffee.

  
Then someone suggested I go out to the nearby gas station and buy some drinks. And all I could think was ""there's madness happening all around and you want me to leave the situation and buy drinks""?? But I did and they were all so chill and they made lovely food and it all came together but I was so exhausted by the whole thing.

  
And honestly all I know is that I don't have ADHD. I've never even been to therapy, maybe it's better if I don't I feel like literally any other diagnosis is up for grabs and maybe I don't need to have a label on myself.

  
But how are people not constantly internally freaking out like I am??",2,1765404259.0,neurodiversity,0,1.0,False

1pjfx15,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1pjfx15/do_not_watch_this/,Do not watch this,"I’m writing this here now because I’m not sure when I’ll get another chance. I’m not sure I’ll live long enough to recount this event in its entirety. 

My name is Donavin Meeks. I’m 22 years old, and last month, I found a VHS tape. 

I had been rummaging through my attic, searching for some old Halloween costumes I could pull back out for old times' sake, just to get into the ol’ holiday spirit. 

I’ll preface by saying, much like many others, my attic was almost backroom-ish. 

The way the dust had collected amongst the clutter, and how the cobwebs seemed to decorate the beams that supported my roof, the atmosphere alone was unsettling enough. 

As I searched through box after box of old knick-knacks, photo albums, and stocking stuffers that nobody used anymore, I finally managed to find the cardboard box labeled “Halloween” with a little cutely drawn spider with a smiley face beside it. 

All hail the Gods of irony, because as soon as I lifted the box, the biggest black widow I’d ever seen came running out, its legs clicking against the hardwood.

I hate spiders, so this obviously caused me to jump backwards, tripping and falling over some other boxes and immediately flailing like a maniac in fear of a bite from the arachnid. 

Hopping to my feet and checking ferociously for any sign of the thing on any part of my body, I happened to glance down at the mess of boxes I had just created. 

Lying in the center of the scattered clothing and Christmas decorations, lie a VHS tape. 

Unlike the other items, the VHS tape was completely dust free, and seemed as though it had been watched to about the halfway point. 

I picked it up to analyze it and found that it had been labeled “Do Not Watch” in black permanent marker over white painters tape. 

Staring at the words, I couldn’t help but feel utter intrigue. 

Not only had I never seen the tape, I had never even OWNED a VHS player. 

I mean, I’m 22, honestly, what am I going to use one of those things for? 

The dams of curiosity broke within the first two minutes of my discovery, and off I went, down to the local pawn shop to find my VHS player. 

It cost me a solid $5.98. One of the perks of being obsolete, I guess.  Upon returning home, I was bewildered to find that the mysterious videotape was no longer on the coffee table where I had left it. 

Living alone, this turned out to be incredibly concerning to me. 

I began to rack my brain, thinking of how I could have misplaced the thing. 

I distinctly remembered placing it directly in the center of my coffee table. I mean, I checked under the couches, on the dining room table, my bedroom, bathroom, every room in my house had been checked. 

I began thinking that it was my mind that had been lost instead of that damn tape.

I stayed up into the early morning hours because the idea of something that distinct just vanishing like that; it irked me.

My mind already tends to wander and teeter on borderline paranoid schizophrenia, and this event did NOT help.

Once I finally DID choose to go to bed, my sleep was shakey at best.

I couldn’t have been asleep for more than an hour and a half when the abrupt sounds of what seemed to be footsteps awoke me.

I could have swore that I heard the sound coming from directly above me, yet, once I fully regained consciousness, they had stopped completely.

I had first put it off as a dream, a mere trick of the mind, similar that feeling you get when you’re falling in your sleep.

That thought gave me comfort, and allowed me to doze back into sleep. However, that comfort was quickly vanquished when the same sounds started up yet again.

This time I KNEW what I had heard, and I wasn’t about to just lay in bed defenseless.

I immediately threw the covers off of myself and grabbed the bat that I keep beside my bed in case of home intruders just like this one.

Being sure to make a lot of noise so the intruder KNEW that I was coming. I wanted them afraid, I wanted them to feel what I had been feeling.

I yanked the attic door down and began climbing the ladder, flashlight in one hand, bat in the other.

I hyped myself up as I ascended, preparing myself for whatever may lay within the plane of darkness which is my attic.

Once I got about 6 inches from the entrance, I called out.

“I know you’re up there! I hope you know I’m calling the cops, AND I’m armed. So just come on out please. Don’t make this any harder than it needs to be.”

I waited a few moments and received no response.

The silence was daunting, and cut through me.

The hot attic air seemed to grow chilled. A distinct drop in temperature that made me shiver.

“Just come on out, man. We can work this out just as soon as you come out and make yourself known!”

I waited a few moments once more, and once more, received no response.

“Alright, I’m coming up! I swear to God if I see any movement whatsoever from you, I am bashing your head in!”

I slowly began to ascend what remained of the ladder.

My right palm sweat profusely wrapped around the rubber grip of the bat, whereas my left hand shook the beam of the flashlight ever so slightly.

I began to scan the room with the beam, making sure light touched every surface possible from the attic entrance.

Everything seemed still. Calm. Untouched, if it weren’t for where the few boxes I had knocked over prior.

Though my light landed on no one, it did happen to fall upon a familiar plastic black rectangle, placed right back in the center of the spilled clutter.

“No fucking way…” I thought to myself.

Cautiously, I made my way towards the VHS tape, practically spinning in circles with my flashlight as I inched closer.

Still, no sign of an intruder.

I reached down and retrieved the VHS tape.

Just then, a whole wall of boxes came tumbling over from across the attic, followed by the sounds of swift footsteps that seemed to approach me at an inhuman pace, only to completely dissipate as soon as it was before me.

The flashlight and bat were both shaking wildly now as I spun around the room, sweating and petrified.

“COME OUT! COME OUT RIGHT NOW!” I screamed.

The attic was now eerily silent again.

As I stood there, shaking and on the brink of a panic attack, the sound of creaking floorboards scratched the back of my mind, and a deep, booming voice spoke from behind me.

“Boo.”

I flew across the attic at a speed I didn’t know I was possible of achieving,

I was down the ladder so fast that my foot ended up getting caught on the last rung, causing my ankle to twist, followed by a sickening POP that shot pain throughout my entire leg.

I had saved my videotape though, and this time, it wasn’t leaving my side.

I ended up having to spend the rest of the night and next morning in the hospital getting x-rayed and having my foot casted up.

I had ended up breaking my ankle, and all I could tell the doctors was I tripped while climbing out of the attic.

Anyway, I returned home as soon as I was cleared, anxious to finally watch this VHS that seemed to had randomly appeared in my home, as well as some sort of unwanted visitor.

I never really fed into the whole paranormal thing, but holy shit, man. The true horror that I felt in that moment up in that attic; it made me a believer instantly.

Well, I should say that it made me believe that things can be ATTACHED to objects. Whether it be holy or demonic. Attachments can happen.

And I believe that’s what the case was with this tape.

Once I arrived home, I was determined to finally view its contents.

Something that I had failed to notice upon retrieving the tape from the attic was that now, instead of being half way through, it was completely rewound to the very beginning.

Not only that, but the black marker had now been turned…red? It looked as though a completely new label had been placed on the tape. It looked…flashier. Like the CAUTION tag on a bottle of chemicals.

“DO. NOT. WATCH. THIS.”

Yeah, right. Who WOULD’NT watch this?

Arriving home, I found that my house had been completely trashed.

Cabinets were thrown open, couch cushions ripped off and strewn across the floor, pots and pans sat neatly across every counter top.

Luckily for me, my VHS player had remained untouched, and sat where it had been just below the TV stand.

Unbothered by the mess, unbothered by the clear red flags, I sat down in front of my television and popped the tape into the player.

Nothing happened at first. Just a black screen that lingered.

Suddenly, blasting white and black static came scratching across the display.

I jumped a bit, and felt my heart drop before steadying.

Slowly but surely, the picture began to become clear and smooth.

The first thing to come into view was a mailbox.

A mailbox that stood displaying my exact address.

My heart began to speed up again.

As the picture video became clearer, I was able to make out the sidewalk that led to my front porch.

Then my front door.

Then my stairs.

The attic door.

The ladder.

And then darkness as the person recording nestled into a dark corner within the attic.

The video then remained that way. Black stillness for an uncomfortably long period of time.

There was a sudden and harsh skip in the frames and now the camera was panned to the attic door from within the attic.

Distinct shadows could be seen through the cracks in the doorframe, shadows that seemed to be that of a certain 22 year old man, living alone.

There was another cut, and now the recorder appeared to be crouched in a new corner of the attic, filming as the door to the fell open and footsteps began to climb the ladder.

I watched in horror as my own head popped into frame, waddling up the stairs, completely oblivious, as I searched through box after box for a stupid Halloween costume.

The video then abruptly ended, right before the black widow came crawling out from under the package causing me to jump backwards and fall.

The next cut was a shot of my living room. It showed the camera slowly approaching the tape that lay on my coffee table.

Another sudden cut.

A hand was now in frame, pale and decrepit. It carefully placed my silver spaghetti pot atop the kitchen counter before patting it softly, then panning the camera around the room to reveal the mess that had been created.

The next and final cut revealed me, yet again, cautiously searching the addict with a flashlight. Eyes wide and apprehension painted clearly across my face.

I stared at the television in absolute dismay. Frozen. My jaw dropped cleanly to the floor.

I remained in a trance-like state for the remainder of the footage, broken only when the video abruptly ended, and was somehow replaced by live footage.

Live footage that showed a 22 year old man, who lives alone, sitting in awe, as he watched himself on the television.

My mind took longer than I care to admit for it to put the pieces together, but once it did, it was too late, and the sound of heavy footsteps began echoing from the television, and the live footage inched closer and closer to my spot on the sofa.",1,1765404006.0,stayawake,0,1.0,False
1pjfwbx,https://i.redd.it/4ebhuanc8g6g1.jpeg,Engage In New Ways And Reach Out To Even The Brain Washed.,"How about the developers and investment companies, bankers, and housing HOA’s start speaking up and recognizing that the tragic emergent consequences of their complacent participation—by being quiet—is doing harm to these hardest-working people who live in our towns? And this bullshit, which is the Nazi, racist infiltration into this federal government, which for the past 60 years was finally in a place where protections were obviously part of a broad understanding that minorities could be assured, “Yes, equality for all is built into the everyday experience here in AMERICA, because laws had to be bold and strong to keep white supremacy in check.”

BUT in one year—2025—and one huge beast of a racist President and co-conspirators, including the RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD IN THAT TIME (2025), having BOUGHT UP SEVERAL OF THE LARGEST COMMERCIAL PROPAGANDA TELEVISION DEVICE CONGLOMERATES to shape the narrative, and being appointed as the MASTER ANNIHILATOR, which was part of the secret-society supremacy goal, in one month shut down every major civil-rights institution that had been seen as a pillar of priority and hope. These institutions would have taken us into the future without compromise, in perpetuity—the cornerstone of years of enlightened and hard-fought legislation. A valued system that, for the majority of the world’s population, was seen as a champion to the world’s populous, and their governments, with the power of people and legislation offering equality to all regardless of cultural background, regardless of the color of your skin, regardless of your religion, and regardless of the content of your thoughts and political affiliations.

In one year, we have had—due to these factors, which are potentially still not legally legislated as far as the mass firings, mass layoffs, mass closures, and the mass ending of programs that were legislated by the U.S. Congress and completely shuttered by Trump and the white-supremacist agenda; protections that took 60 years to build up—created a racist-based federal government. This is a government that once had legislation against hate crimes so that citizens could be held accountable, and now the federal government is responsible for thousands of hate crimes a day against the civilian population.

So what I’m saying is: maybe the people who didn’t understand the severity of what these deciding secret plans would look like might want to start speaking up like yesterday. Hopefully, when they start realizing that unfinished business, unfinished homes, unfinished farming, causing economic failures and disaster to every corner of our country and the world, they’ll understand that the time was yesterday to fucking get something going. Waking up and realizing—no, what are you scared of?

At a time when technology and the fruits of our laborers as a world could be venerated and shown off for the universe of societies—as we see in sci-fi movies if there were ever other life forms that were sentient—we were on a path toward enlightenment. But because of the secret meetings and secret rooms that were dark and ugly, angry, white-power-driven agendas, with horrible-tasting coffee and angry, bitter old men pushing wild lies and sophisticated warped narratives toward the younger, impressionable minds, using brainwashing tools to vilify entire groups with very little truth, only damaging content to scare and create fear of what hopeful equanimity could look like, they gave rise to and emboldened a tiny sect of white-centric individuals.

Maybe the small, insidious, powerful, wealthy group that has hijacked our government and eviscerated all of these institutions has done it with the populace’s, or the civilians’, blessing because they were misled by propaganda. The civilians, for some reason, thought they were making some sort of sacrifice that would help them in the long run, but in fact, this group has single-handedly destroyed most of these people’s hard-fought protections and freedoms, and has cost them trillions in economic gains they might have seen over the last 60 years.

Leading up to this moment—now—this has been hijacked by the perpetrators of what has happened here in 2025, living up to their masculine dream of not sharing in the success of what has made America great for the past 40 years.

And now we have a Supreme Court that makes decisions based on the treasures and gifts deposited at their feet, the gold and jewels dangled among the power players, while the little people are thrown aside and don’t even recognize their participation in their own demise. The tiny, tiny, tiny group of hijackers that has taken all of this from billions of little people, because of propaganda, think they are part of the elite group making up this entire story of the powers that be.

It might not be too late. It might be, but it might not be too late if everybody shared this with ten people they knew. Even if only one, two, or three of those people shared it. There are not as many racists as the news makes it seem—because we are so shocked by their behavior that it makes content for all of us to look at. But I guarantee you, in all the people in my life that I have met, most of those people would never think this was something that was going to actually become the reality.

So if the people whose lives have been altered by this regime would start to speak up… because I’m surprised. It’s really bizarre to me that people aren’t more interested in protecting their future and not speaking up. It’s odd, because we are a government that, in its proclamation—our Constitution—starts out: “WE THE PEOPLE.”

And until my last dying breath, I am an American. And I am one of the “We” in this proclamation. And I will be damned if I’m going to let this regime take my voice away. Until I have no voice, I will continue to make an effort so that others have opportunities, no matter their race, no matter their culture, and no matter their political affiliation.",2,1765403958.0,EyesOnIce,1,0.75,False

1pjfv3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_One-Brilliant9136/comments/1pjfv3g/coffee_chat_journal_3_construction_management/,[Coffee Chat Journal 3] Construction Management Superintendent,"This coffee chat I had was with a professional in a field that was much more foreign to me: construction management. While in a virtual session, I still learned an immense amount from a construction management superintendent whom we will call CM for confidentiality purposes. Even though the meeting was held online rather than in person, CM’s confidence, clarity, and grounded presence made the conversation still feel personal and engaging. From the outset, CM emphasized the multifaceted nature of her role. She described herself as someone who has to “micromanage everything,” but not in the negative sense that the term usually suggests. In construction, micromanagement is less about controlling people and more about ensuring that nothing falls through the cracks or that things are placed back on track if they have fallen behind. With so many moving parts on a job site, such as delivered materials, safety protocols, subcontractor availability, weather delays, inspections, and evolving plans, overseeing details is simply part of the job. As CM explained this, it became clear that her level of attentiveness is not only expected but absolutely critical to keeping a project on track. Going into the meeting, I expected to learn about the daily responsibilities of a superintendent, such as how she manages schedules, coordinates teams, and oversees site operations. What I did not expect was how much the conversation would help me better understand my own strengths and preferences and how they might be fulfilled in a role like hers. As someone with a Type A, “get it done” personality who thrives on structure, productivity, and momentum, the more CM explained her work, the more I could picture myself fitting into the environment she described. Where others might feel overwhelmed by that level of oversight, I often feel most comfortable when I have a clear understanding of everything that needs to be done and a system in place for accomplishing it. Hearing that this is not only acceptable but essential in construction management made the role feel even more appealing. Collaboration was another theme CM repeatedly emphasized. She described her experience as the superintendent as the central communicator who keeps everyone aligned, from engineers and architects to subcontractors and laborers. Every decision, clarification, and adjustment flows through her. I have always been someone who likes to keep everyone on the same page, ask questions early, and take charge of organizing group efforts. My Type A drive means I naturally step into leadership roles in group settings, not because I want to control others, but because I enjoy helping create efficiency and forward momentum. Therefore, the superintendent role seems to reward exactly that kind of initiative. Even though our meeting was virtual, CM’s communication style stood out. She was patient, articulate, and straightforward. She used diagrams and real examples to walk me through her daily responsibilities. I could tell she takes pride in not only managing work but also explaining it. It made me realize that strong communication is not just helpful but essential in her field. When reflecting on my strengths, my own inclination to articulate expectations clearly and follow up consistently would be valuable in this kind of environment. Overall, my virtual coffee chat with CM helped me see that construction management is more than a technical field. It is a role that rewards initiative, attention to detail, leadership, and the drive to take action. As someone who loves structure, thrives under pressure, and takes pride in getting things done, this conversation showed me that the superintendent role could be a strong and fulfilling fit for my personality. One thing I learned from my coffee chat with her is that while I showed interest in this field and learned from her, I could have improved by redirecting the conversation to ask where she’d suggest I start gaining experience to work up to her level.

Today was the first time a guest ever asked me to make them a coffee. I’m not a barista, so internally I was like, “Uhh… what?” But I just smiled and said I’d see what we have. I ended up using the Nespresso machine and made something close enough to a cappuccino.


In a decade of doing this job, I’ve never once actually made someone’s coffee. I’ve directed people to the kitchen, sure. I’ve grabbed bottled drinks plenty of times. But this? Totally new.


No big deal! Just one of those random little moments that catches you off guard after years in the role.

1pjfu58,https://www.reddit.com/r/RPGdesign/comments/1pjfu58/do_you_think_that_managing_dungeon/,Do you think that managing dungeon crawling/exploration without a map but with a card system would be interesting or just ass?,"Hi everyone, while with the social and combat spheres I'm almost done, I was wondering how to make dungeons and ""mapped areas"" exploration more unique, without it being that convoluted to become lame. My game's system is based on tarot cards, with minor arcana for players to be used as a deck with skills, weapons etc, and major arcana for the master as a substitute d20, with various random tables, flavors and gimmicks linked to tarots' symbologies (and the master acts as a neutral fortune teller who just enjoy what fate brings to the world and its inhabitants). 

I was thinking about rendering dungeon maps procedural (or maybe formed by a list of rooms and things to be found, to be randomly mixed), but managed with the use of the major arcana deck, with cards drawn that in order determine room features, if it has other doors, if it holds treasures and/or enemies, and such things (such as quests and events from an external table to be triggered). I want to make exploration dark and eerie, with players that will discover challenges and fights almost out of nowhere, making the limited light radius palpable from the table. Imo having a map with tokens, when your objective is to make players' b.holes super tight, could be limiting, and I find kind of cute the idea of one player to take responsibility for active mapping for everyone (getting lost has to be an aspect of exploration, especially in a dark fantasy game). Movement is not important for my rule set, as long as it makes sense (you cannot run for a mile during a turn, but if an enemy is at a sensible distance I won't prevent you from reaching it because it's at 35fts and your movement is 30, yuck), this is why I was thinking about ditching the classic idea of map, and I also want to be able to make a game easily playable almost anywhere, even on a small coffee table with 4 people.

Do you think this kind of exploration approach could be well received, or is it too exotic and autistic (I can't just ignore this aspect of mine lol) to be enjoyable? ",0,1765403805.0,RPGdesign,2,0.5,False

Last Pick: **Jalen Brunson 7+ Asts❌ (ENDS 2-POTD WIN STREAK✅✅❌)**

Today's Pick: **Shai Gilgeous-Alexander O 42.5 PAR**

**$DKNG**: **-109**

Wager Amount: 2.18U to WIN 2U

League: Phoenix Suns vs Oklahoma City Thunder (6:30PM CST on Amazon Prime)

**Recap**: **Despite the trend and how much he covered this line, really didn't like that Brunson Asts prop, just not as much as I usually like my POTD, but wanted to go to Hot Key and take Nathan MacKinnon to have 4+ SOG (which he smashed and got 7 SOG), but I had to go to the game that had the most demand which was the NBA Cup games.** He did start out fine, but it was clear that he wanted to increase his shooting output in that Cup game.

**Matchup:** I wouldn't be taking this lines/odds if it didn't drop just now! The lines was sitting at O/U 43.5 on SGA PAR prop last nite and the lines dropped this morning. The odds have been flucuating between -109 to -122. I smashed it on -109! It's currently -114, a nickel price shouldn't be much of a deal breaker, but forget about the price difference, all that really matters if we think he covers this line which I strongly believe he does!

First off this is a NBA Cup game and they were so close to winning it all last season but was stomped by the Bucks in a blowout, they kno what they are capable of. They are defending champs and proved that they were rdy for the ship. This time they are rdy for the NBA Cup, but they have to get thru the surprising Suns to get to the NBA Cup championship again. I love his matchup vs the Suns. **He's been covering this line all season long, averaging 44 PAR per game.** This line is just way too short, IMO it should be hovering around O/U 45.5 in a NBA Cup game. **SGA has covered this line 5 of his last 6 games. He has also covered this line on his last matchup (37 Pts, 8 Asts, 3 Rebs on 11/28) against the Suns and 6 of his last 7 matchups against this team.**

[SGA has covered this short line in 6 of his 7 matchups vs the Suns and has covered this line 5 of his last 6 recent games!](https://preview.redd.it/w2hnd7ng6g6g1.png?width=889&format=png&auto=webp&s=e48c72e88913e8dafaa7004e86c459d448132e64)

I think the reason why this line is short is because Jalen Williams is back in this lineup, but if you look at the last time they face this Suns lineup, which was 12 days ago, J-Dub was in the lineup and SGA covered this line by a mile!

**Yesterday I mentioned I didn't like Brunson Asts prop despite the trend, today I love this prop bet and think this is way too low.** So much that I press for 2U play! This is a NBA Cup game and I expect SGA to get them to advance to the Semi-Finals!

**The Play & Prediction :** 2.18U on Shai Gilgeous-Alexander O 42.5 PAR (Pts + Asts + Rebs) on $DKNG. SGA scores 36 Pts, 5 Asts, 4 Rebs.

As the title suggests, I'm close to having fully recovered and I just completed a Hyrox (double) a few days ago without any symptoms. If anything, I feel even better now than before the race.

This has truly been a complicated journey. It took me 20 months to reach this state (15 months after finding this subreddit + Steve's guide and really starting my rehab).

Along the way, I have tried out many different things. Lots of failures, lots of ups and downs and frustration. I also managed to get another injury (IT band syndrome) at the beginning of my costo. So I had to work on that injury and costochondritis at the same time. Hopefully my experience can be useful to some of you

This is going to be a long post. Here's the layout of my post, in case you want to skip some of it

## Summary 
## General tips 
## Getting costo
## Healing history (phase by phase)
## What worked for me
## What else I tried

# Summary
Got costo with swimming and working out. Symptoms got better with backpod & co but stagnated. Significantly improved thanks to deep tissue massages, better stress management and not overdoing my rehab routine. 

# General tips
Don't over-stimulate your nervous system. You might be like me and foam rolling / using the back pod too often. The temporary relief might be nice but will keep you in a pain<>short-term relief cycle. 

Look for help and don't hesitate to change if it's not going anywhere. At the same time, be a bit patient and give a new process some time before tossing it to the thrash.

# Getting costo & symptoms
Everything started in early 2024 as I increased my training at the gym and got into swimming. Within 2/3 months of 4 weekly gym sessions and 2 swims with poor technique, I started to feel some popping and a nagging feeling in the chest.

After one swim session, I felt an immense deep tension feeling in the upper back, a constant 7/10. This lasted for over a week and only got better after getting a massage. But this wasn't enough of a warning. 2 weeks after, I tried swimming again. I probably stopped half-way through the session and  this deep tension came back again. Another week of hell ..

At this point, my back was **extremely tense**. I could hardly rotate it in any direction. **Deep breathing** or even **laughing** would make my symptoms worse. *Sneezing** was by far the worst. It would make my chest pop loudly. To this day, I'm still a bit anxious about sneezing even though my chest hasn't popped in many months.

In April 2024, I went to see a physio who diagnosed me with costochondritis. He explained the inflammation of the cartilage at the front and said that my back was ""hard as rock"". Weirdly he didn't really make the connection between the two ..

# Healing history (phase by phase)
Let's go over the whole journey which can be split into 5 phases.
1. **April to September 2024*"": work with my first PT with no improvements whatsoever

2. **September to December 2024**: purchased backpod and followed Steve's plan. Good reduction of symptoms

3. **January to March 2025**: worsening of symptoms after a flare-up and overdoing backpod / peanut ball

4. **April to August 2025**: new PT and updated routine put me back on the right track to progress. Slowly getting back to the gym with the help of a friend fitness coach. Healed ~ 80%

5. **September to December 2025**: updated routine again, continued visits with PT, added new deep tissue massages. Healed ~ 95%

## Apr-Sep. 2024 - No progress with first PT
That first PT diagnosed me correctly but was **absolutely useless** and I wasted months and I probably got worse with him

Even though my back was ""hard as rock"" according to him, he never really worked his hands on my back. Mostly did some very soft ""relaxing massages"" on the back and worked around my breastbone.

He also recommended me to continue working out but with lower weights. That was a crazy suggestion.

By August, I was desperately looking for solutions. While looking for steroid injections, I found out this subreddit, Steve's work and the backpod. I'm so grateful for that. 

## Sep-Dec 2024 - Good first progress with Steve's plan
I immediately **purchased the backpod** and started following Steve's plan. Daily use of the backpod, progressively going from 3 to 0 pillows. Then introduced **ballistic rotations, side and pec stretches**. Symptoms started to go down to a constant 4-5/10

Being me, I tried out a few times light works out and swimming. Work outs were not too bad but it was still clearly too early. Swims were definitely a no-go.

## Jan-Mar. 2025 - Flare-up and worsening of symptom
In January 2025, I had a big flare up after an excessive back bend that caused a lot of tension in the back. By trying to improve it, I just made it worse and more chronic. I was **over using the back pod and over stretching**. Another important thing. I moved in a new flat in January and the **new matress was very soft**. This definitely made things much worse. I was constantly waking up super stiff and always dreading about going to sleep. Those months were really hard.

During those months, I also went to see an osteopath who ""unblocked"" my back. The results were unbelievable. I felt so good that day. But as expected - ane explained by Steve - this was only temporary and my pain levels went up again the next morning.

## Apr.-Aug. 2025 - Good progress with new PT and routine

In April 2025, I decided I couldn't do this alone and needed help from someone. I found out this physio/osteopath (he has both certifications) with really good reviews especially with regards to back issues. Within a few sessions, he managed to significantly reduce my back tension. He mostly did **targeted massages with fingers and elbows around the spine** as well as dry needling. I'm saying ""targeted"" because he wouldn't go hard on all the different tissues but pressed on specific points alongside all the upper back spine. It did feel like he would always hit the ""right"" spots.

I updated my routine which I had detailed in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/costochondritis/s/VfKTlk0kIu) It consisted of a lot of back mobilisation/stretching, shoulder mobility work and postural exercices. The routine itself was probably a good one but it most likely too much for what my body could handle  

Regardless, I was progressing with this routine and started to go back to the gym with the help of a friend / fitness coach. We mostly focused on mobility drills and arms / legs exercices initially. Then eventually started introducing shoulder exercices and deadlifting.

I must also say that I'm a cyclist and that I hadn't completely given up on cycling. It didn't feel too bad at this point but **evidently slowed down my progress**.

By August, I could do **proper arm and leg machine workouts with no issues**. I was probably about **80% healed**.

## Sep.-Dec 2025 
At this point, I think my back joints were pretty well freed up. I was feeling tension in the back but it was probably more stiffness from so much time being locked, rather than the specific ""costo"" joints being frozen. 

So I changed a few things that I think were key to the success of these last 3 month

The first is I **better tension management**. Until now, if my back started to feel more tense, I would do more stretches and use more the backpod. While providing short term relief, this would usually aggravate things on the long run. Instead what I did was
- Reducing backpod usage
- Using ""back patches"" (e.g. heating patch or lidocaine patch). These are not a cure but they help alleviate symptoms and cut the urge to roll or stretch the bac
- Trying to consciously tell yourself that this is just temporary (stress management in other words
- Being more active if possible (e.g. walk more around)

In relation to this, I **increased the cadency of my visits to the PT** to 1x/week. This made sure if ever my tension was going up, I knew I would see my PT in a few days and just had to wait to see him to get better. This was really reassuring

I **completely stopped cycling** (should have done it before, I know).

I got a **harder mattress** and tried sleeping more on the back. I mentioned that my new flats mattress was super soft and this really worsened my symptoms. I had gotten a new one a few months after but that one was still a bit too soft. The one I got in September was really much better. 

I went to see a **new deep tissue massage therapist**. I saw this guy 4 times in 3 months and it helped a lot. Note that this was the third massage therapist that I saw and this one helped me much more than the others. He mostly worked on my back, a bit on the pecs and on the diaphragm. If you can afford it, it can be worth trying different therapists if one didn't work too well for you. 

I simplified my routine and **focused on the things that worked for me**. My routine was and still consists of 
- back pod 1-2x/day a few minutes 
- ballistic rotations (1-4x / day)
- windmill dumbbells (2-3x / week)
- thoracic rotations (1-2x / day)
- dead hangs with feet touching the ground (1-2x / week)


I also added a new **elevated foam roller back bend stretch**. I put the foam roller on a stepper for extra leverage and lay on it. This is probably quite advanced so don't try it at the early stage. But this felt really good and also gave me more confidence on my actual back mobility. (Found that online but can't find anything that corresponds exactly to what I mean, let me know if you want me to take a picture)

I also started going this [bodyweight back workout](https://youtu.be/JQeOhQoi3GY?si=HUTVLtDv2mjEykGJ) a few times a week. This was the workout that helped a lot some time go with another chronic back injury. Again, this is **more advanced** as you're lying on your chest and working out your back.

Finally, this was also the moment I started **getting back in running**. I mentionned I was also suffering from IT band syndrome that completely prevented me from running. Running never actually hurt my costo ( I know it's not the case for everyone) and slowly reintroducing running felt really good, at the least for the mind.

I continued with the gym. Started squatting (the barbell on the back can be a trigger if you're not well advanced in the healing journey) and working out a bit the back. I had signed up way back for this hyrox competition with a friend in December. At this point, I was still very unsure about doing it. End of October, I started to try out some of the hyrox exercices and surprisingly they all went really well and actually trained for it for the remaining month. So I decided I was pretty much ready to do it. I wasn't super fit but my training showed me that I could do it without hurting myself. And, in any case, if I started to feel something weird, I could always let my friend do most of the work. 

Turned out, I felt really good during it and we're actually very happy about the performance ! (Note that it was a double so you do 50% of the work)

# What worked for me
In this section, I want to highlight the specific things that worked for me. I'm not going to mention things that we probably all know such as the back pod or thoracic rotations. That doesn't mean they're not essential to recovery. 

**Pain management & not overdoing it**
Like many others, I wanted to do too good and overused the backpod / peanut ball and over-stretched. In situations of increased tension, it was better for me to *not* use the backpod and wait for the next massage and/or use back patches to help with the symptoms. 

**Correctly identifying triggers while maintaining non-triggering activities**
This is not my first chronic back injury and I completely tense up in the back of I'm not doing anything. A key aspect was finding what activity I could without worsening or slowing down too much my progress. As they say, if you don't use it, you lose it. At the same time, don't do anything that worsens it or just doesn't feel right. If it doesn't it's hurting more than you think.
Cycling was NOT one of those and I should have stopped way earlier. Running was something I could do without worsening my costo but with the IT band syndrome it took a while before I could get back to it. So for me, it was mostly walking and initially (and very progressively) arm/leg workouts at the gym. Obviously this won't be the case for everyone especially at a non advanced stage. 

**Building confidence in back mobility**
I think I underestimated the back mobility that I regained. It's only after some of the latest deep tissue massages and doing the elevated  foam-roller back bend that I realised it was better than I thought. Little by little I was confident in opening up my chest and moving more my back. 

**Finding the right therapist**
Easier said than done obviously. For me it's only the third massage therapist with whom I noticed a big difference. 

**Some different exercices that I used**
I'll just list here some less common movements / exercices that helped me. Most of these are more advanced.

• [Windmill dumbbells/kettlebells](https://youtube.com/shorts/D7clkf7Jf9E?si=QwzHOF-K8H38p2X1) : great for side stretching + thoracic rotation. Go very light initially (FWIW I use 12kg kettlebells now)

• kneeling side stretch: similar to [this](https://youtu.be/BrPSpz9abGA?si=X2nDfJ4Z0eQRtZHa) but slower and ass on the knees

• [around the worlds](https://youtube.com/shorts/Cp2QT8aUs3Q?si=6pzBMC6OMxqJcKd2): shoulder mobility + thoracic rotation. You can start with no weights and start using plates as you get comfortable (FWIW I use 4 kgs plates now)

• elevated foam roller back bend

• [dead hangs with feet touching the ground](https://youtu.be/XfqeLAfQuj4?si=OAJg7lLoJj0LThqV) : this is for thoracic extension. The benefits of having your feet touching the ground is it's a lighter stretch that you can maintain a longer time (e.g. 30-40s). You can also relax more than a regular dead hang

• [DB shoulder external rotation](https://youtu.be/mbdDt0c9bZY?si=MN7YTqCsb0CavuIN) : love this one, I feel my shoulder can better go bac


# Summary of what I tried & impacts 
I'll label everything with a label depending on the impact they had : high, mid (medium), no, can't say
 
| Item | Impact | Comments | 
|--------|:-------|-------:|
| Treatments  |  | | 
| Massage | High |   | 
| Dry-needling | Mid |   |
| Shockwaves | No | My PT tried it around the lats, no changes |
| back patches / tiger balm | mid | doesn't cure anything but helped with symptoms and prevented overdoing the routine |
| Acupuncture | No  |   |
| Food / Supplements | |  |
| Magnesium | Can't say | Still take it but probably didn't change much|
| Fish oil | Can't say | Same as above |
| No caffeine | Mid | Coffee would worsen my symptoms and significantly cutting it helped a bit |
| Miscellaneous |  |  |
| Hard mattress | high | Helped a lot (+trying to sleep on the back) |

# Conclusion
I'm still not fully healed. I'm still doing my routine nearly every day. My next steps are to progressively go back to chest training, (heavier) back training, swimming and cycling. That's still a lot to do, I'll take my sweet time but I think the hardest is past me. 

Good luck to everyone, and feel free if you want even more precision on my experience !

	•	Your chosen home country (real or fictional)

	•	A specialty (stealth, tech, diplomacy, chaos gremlin energy… whatever fits!)

	•	Cameo roles in the storyline me and my partner are telling

It’s like a shared universe — where your duo exists, but nothing is romanticized or used in ways you don’t approve.

If you want in, comment with:

	1.	Your preferred name / nickname

	2.	Your companion’s name

	3.	Which country or region your duo is from

	4.	Your vibe / specialty (example: tech analyst, stealth operative, medic, cryptographer, “feral gremlin in a hoodie,” etc.)

🇮🇪 AGENT FILE: TEAM BLUEFANG

(Primary Agents — Flagship Unit of CAAE)

Human Agent:

GRETCHEN “BUG” O’SHEA

	•	Role: Field Intelligence / Instinct-Based Tactical Analyst

	•	Strengths: Pattern recognition, improvisation, emotional intuition

	•	Known For:

	•	Making impossible judgment calls that somehow work

	•	Talking her way into (and out of) every situation

	•	Carrying three snacks and zero hesitation

	•	Weaknesses:

	•	Occasional spirals, cured only by coffee or cuddles

	•	Decision paralysis when presented with more than two sweaters

Companion Agent:

CALLUM “BLUEFANG” O’SHEA

	•	Role: Negotiator / Reconnaissance Specialist / Interrogation Expert

	•	Strengths:

	•	Psychological insight, threat reading

	•	Tactical planning

	•	Physical presence that intimidates 100% of criminals

	•	Known For:

	•	Calling Bug “pretty girl” over comms during missions

	•	Breaking expensive interrogation room chairs

	•	Going from scary to gentle in 0.2 seconds flat

⸻

🌍 Origin:

County Clare, Ireland

A quiet safehouse hidden between cliffs and forest.

Half the intelligence world knows the location.

None of them survive long enough to say it.

⸻

🐺 Team Codename:

TEAM BLUEFANG

Named after Callum’s “fang-and-rage-but-soft-for-Bug” energy

and Bug’s startling ability to tame monsters with affection alone.

⸻

🎯 Specialty:

HIGH-RISK INFILTRATION & PSYCHOLOGICAL OPERATIONS

When a situation requires:

✓ a clever human who sees through bullshit,

✓ a monster-coded negotiator who knows how to break liars politely,

✓ and a dynamic so tight they communicate without talking…

Bluefang gets the call.

⸻

🔎 Operational Notes:

	•	Bug leads field interactions. Her instincts have outperformed agency algorithms twice.

	•	Callum handles interrogation, hostage negotiation, and “scaring people straight.”

	•	They insist on working as a pair. Separating them reduces mission success by 82%.

	•	Their fox companion Saoirse (“Seer-sha”) is technically not an agent…

but she keeps breaking into HQ systems, so she’s listed as “Junior Operative.”

⸻

📁 Agent Assessment:

Compatibility Score: 99.4%

Risk Level: Low (unless someone flirts with Bug — then Callum becomes a hazard)

Recommendation:

“Do not assign to low-stakes missions.

They get bored and start flirting in the middle of operations.”

— Director Rowan, CAAE HQ

For the sake of privacy, I will not disclose where he is exchanging from, but it is a quite isolated country on the other side of the world from me. He asked me to coffee, we became fast friends, and then fell into it HARD. He is one of the kindest and most empathetic people I have ever met. 

The issue, then, is that he is only on exchange for a single semester, and this semester is quickly coming to an end. Although he is spending some of the winter break with me, fast approaching is the time when he has to go home (all the way across the world!) and I am unsure if I'll ever see him again. Needless to say, that rips my heart into a million pieces, even though we've agreed to stay in touch. I am trying not to grieve what I still have, and I knew that our time together would be limited from the get go, but I cannot help but think about how fleeting the time we have together is. I know I am young and naive, but I hold out hope that our paths will cross again. Now that I've had him in my life, I cannot bear the thought of not having him in my life.

I write today, more of a rant than anything else. All names have been changed. My (24F) best friends, Allie(22F) and Jenny(24F) decided to go on a trip to Belize over my 25th birthday and not tell me. 

  
For some other context, Ally & I have been friends since the sandbox, both of our mothers were single with two kids, and they became best friends. Around 2010-ish, Ally and her family moved to a different city, and we didn't get close again until she decided to enroll in the same university that I was attending in 2021. We had been attached at the hip since. Jenny and I went to college together and we knew of each other but were never close until we were working on a project together in 2023. Soon after, I had introduced the 2 and we became a trio. 

In early 2024, for Ally's 21st birthday, she wanted to go to New York for a weekend. It put a large financial strain on me, but this was my best friend, and you only have one 21st birthday so I picked up a side job to be able to go and celebrate her. Jenny had come along as well but stayed for a few days after to see some of her other friends. In late 2024, Ally had gotten an opportunity for an internship, and she moved to a different city, so it was just Jenny and I after. Early February 2025, Ally's birthday was on a Tuesday, so I couldn't be there in person but I knew she was getting a pedicure that day so I had asked her mom if I placed an order for balloons, some decorations and a cake, if she could pick it up and put it in her room while she is out so she can have a surprise when she gets back. Ally LOVES her birthday, so she was really happy when she saw the surprise.

Around late February 2025, my friend Valerie (21F) had invited the three of us to celebrate her birthday with her in New Orleans, which happened to be during Mardi Gras. Valerie, her two friends, and all three boyfriends went in one car, while I drove Jenny and Ally. On the way there, I said ""I'm sure I don't have to clarify, but since all the other girls have their boyfriends to take care of them, the three of us can take care of each other, the second one of you wants to leave, we all go."" They both agreed. Later in the night, while on Bourbon Street, Jenny and Ally decided they were hungry and told Valeries boyfriend to take care of me. Why they didn't directly tell me they were going to go get food is something I don't know. Valeries boyfriend motioned to me at some point and pointed downstairs, so I assumed they were moving downstairs, I close my tab, walk downstairs, and no one is there. I assume they must be waiting outside, since it was a little crowded. I get outside and see no one. It's around 1AM and I am alone on Bourbon Street during Mardi Gras. I look at their locations on my phone and I see they are at a restaurant on Canal Street. For reference, it is about a mile apart. I started walking to the restaurant they were at and I was so incredibly frustrated, I got to them, asked what they were thinking, they said they told Valeries boyfriend, I asked why Valeries boyfriend would keep track of me on her 21st birthday, they said they were sorry, I told them I would write it off as a miscommunication and move on, and I did. I never brought it up again.

In July 2025, some friends had invited me to a pool party, and I got a plus one, naturally, I invited Jenny. She said she might have other plans, but she would let me know. Morning of, I text Jenny and she said that there were no set time/set plans, but she wanted to be home at a certain time. We went to my friends, got along with them super well, but we ended up back at hers 30 minutes later than she had wanted, which I had apologized for the next morning when we met up for coffee, and she told me all about her night. After this, she kind of started to dodge me. In total, I had asked her to hang out 7 times within the span of 5 or so weeks, she made excuses for all of them. 6 out of 7 of those involved events with no alcohol (going for a walk, joining run club, coffee), since I thought that may be the reason she didn't want to hang out. I had asked Jenny at some point, if things were okay between us and she said ""we are okay not great, I am just really busy with work, and I have a trip to Germany coming up"". I told her I completely understood and hope life gets easier soon and asked her about her trip. She said it was a trip for work with some work friends; I said that I hope it is fun and that was it.

  
August of 2026 rolls around, I look at my Instagram and see a picture of Jenny and Ally in Germany. I was kind of thrown off by this since I had no idea they were going on a trip and, I wondered why I wasn't invited. I looked at my messages with Jenny again to make sure I read it correctly, since Ally and Jenny don't work together, and maybe I had read it wrong, but unfortunately, I was not wrong. Regardless, I moved on. 

  
It's now Mid-October 2025, I reach out to my friend Denise and asked if she would be free early November for me to come visit, since I hadn't seen her in a few years. I had introduced Ally and Denise to one another in 2021, and Ally lived close by, so we decided that I would make a trip to her and the three of us could hang out for a weekend. It was at this time Denise had told me that she was also planning for Ally and Jenny to hang out for a weekend on December 5, and maybe I could come again. I told her that I honestly wasn't sure if Jenny and I were friends. So I reached out to Jenny again, explaining that I was invited on this December 5 trip, and wanted to make sure everything was good between us. She said we were good, so I pushed and said something along the lines of ""I feel like I have been dodged by you any time I ask you to hang out, so I don't think we are fine. I had asked if this had to do with me getting her home 30 minutes later than she wanted in July and if it was, that I apologize again for disrespecting her time."" She responded saying that she had ""been doing some reflection and decided to take a step back from the friendship"", and that she was really busy since she was going to Belize in December. I responded asking why she hadn't brought this up to me sooner and for an explanation since any tiff we had before we always communicated and took accountability for. She never responded. 

I had asked Ally if she knew anything about it and she said no. I then asked if she would be able to come visit me for my 25th birthday because I had been talking about it for a year. She said she wasn't going to be in town. I then asked if it was because she was going to Belize with Jenny and she said yes and I said that I hope she has fun because I know it was a bucket list item for her. 

I go on the weekend getaway to visit Denise and Ally and it was great, but I knew that, because I preach communication. I had to tell Ally that I was a bit upset about her going on a trip with someone who doesn't like me over my birthday, it wouldn't be fair of me to be upset with her and not tell her. So I asked her about Germany and she said that she knew I had limited PTO and she didn't want to have me choose between Christmas with my family or Germany. I responded, ""Shouldn't that be my decision"", she said yes and she was sorry. I then asked if she planned on telling me about Belize at all, or if she was planning on me just finding out on my birthday over an Instagram post like I did with Germany. She said she knew Jenny and I were having problems so that is why she didn't tell me. I asked when she knew about the trip being over my birthday. She said that Jenny and 2 of her friends won an auction item for the 6 people to go to Belize so they all got a plus one, and she put the deposit down in June, and was told to keep October, November and December open. She explained that it was originally supposed to be over Thanksgiving, but someone had a conflict so it got moved back a week. Then someone else had a conflict and so it got moved to the second week of December. I asked why she didn't say she had a conflict because of my birthday and she said it is because she didn't know if I was doing something on the day of my birthday or something the day after. I asked why she didn't just ask me and all she said was sorry. I asked when she knew about it being over my birthday and she said before Germany. Which was before I even knew Jenny and I were having problems. Obviously, since it was about a month away from when she was supposed to leave for the trip, it isn't like I expected her to not go but I was pretty upset that I had to ask he about it instead of her just telling me.

Anyway, my 25th birthday is December 12. This is also the day I will find out if I passed the class that determines if I graduate or not. I'm just really upset, and I know it is stupid to be upset about a birthday, but I have a history of really bad birthdays, and this was a big one, so I have been excited for a year. I don't do things for my friends, expecting to get something in return, I would do it regardless, but sometimes I wish I had a friend that considered me the way I consider them.

1pjfelg,https://i.redd.it/theiqcp64g6g1.jpeg,6 Months with the Gaggimate Mod – My Honest Pros & Cons,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been using the **Gaggimate mod** on my Gaggia Classic for about six months now. I also started a YouTube channel ([@CoffeeXris](https://www.youtube.com/@CoffeeXris?subscribe=1)) where I’ve documented the usage and talked to others who are using it / thinking about installing it, and I’m currently working on a full ""Six Month Review"" video. Since I couldn't find a dedicated ""Pros & Cons"" article when I started, I wanted to share my raw notes here for the community before the video is finished. Hopefully, this helps anyone currently thinking about getting one!

# The PROS

* **Usability Overhaul:** The biggest win for me is simply using the machine. No more temperature surfing or guessing. You get precise control over temperature, flow, and pressure. It feels like a modern machine.
* **Installation is Manageable:** Compared to some other mods, the installation wasn't too difficult in my opinion. The documentation is decent (though it could be better), but there are video tutorials out by now which bridge the gap.
* **Solid Hardware/Software:** Generally, the system is stable. I’ve had very few issues. The touchscreen interface is responsive, and importantly, the **physical buttons still work**, which preserves that tactile Gaggia feel.
* **Shot Timer & Scale Integration:** I’m using the **Bookoo Themis Mini**, and the integration is seamless. Stop-by-weight works great.
* **Steaming:** Major improvement here. The steam pressure is much better sustained compared to stock.
* **Community & Open Source:** The code is open source, which is a huge plus for longevity. The Discord community is also very active and helpful people without the gatekeeping you sometimes see in tech hobbies.
* **Minor Bugs Only:** I've only encountered small hiccups, like an update cancelling itself or needing to restart the machine to reconnect to WiFi. Nothing that bricks the workflow.

# The CONS

* **The Intimidation Factor:** You are working with electronics and mains voltage. If you have never done this, it can be scary. There is a real possibility of breaking your machine during the install.
   * *Important Advice:* If you are uncomfortable opening up electronics or hesitant taking on a project, you are probably better off buying a finished off-the-shelf machine (like a Profitec Go or similar).
* **Safety & Liability:** This is a DIY project, not a certified appliance. There’s always that  thought of ""what if I messed up a wire and it starts a fire?"" I’m not sure how insurance covers DIY appliances, so for my own peace of mind, **I always unplug the machine when I leave the house.**
* **Maintenance & Reliability:** Things can break. I actually had a faulty PCB. Gaggimate customer service was super professional and replaced it, but it was still annoying to have to open the machine up again and swap parts. You become the mechanic.
* **Aesthetics:** I’m not in love with the screen design specifically the large bezel and the visible cable but it is okay.
   * *Note:* Since it’s a kit, you *can* customize this. I’ve seen people use different screens or route cables differently to make it look cleaner, but out of the box, it looks a bit ""modded.""
* **The Learning Curve:** Installing the mod doesn't magically make you a barista. You still need to understand the variables. In fact, having *more* variables (flow, pressure profiles) can make the learning curve steeper for beginners.
* **Cost vs. Value:** It adds up. 
   * *My breakdown with current prices where I live (EU):* Gaggia Classic (€450) + Gaggimate Mod (€225) + better Portafilter (€40) + better Basket (€20) = **\~€735 Total.**
   * At that price point, you might find a used dual-boiler or a machine that already has some of these features built in. So an important question you should ask yourself is what features do you want?

# Verdict (So Far)

We don't know how long the project will be maintained, but even if they never updated the software again, I’d be happy with the current feature set. That said, I heard they are working on some cool new stuff.

If you enjoy the project aspect, go for it. If you just want coffee without the hassle, go for something else.

**I’ll be dropping the full visual review on my channel soon, but let me know if you have specific questions I should cover in the video and what your experience with the Gaggimate mod is!**

**If this little review helped you, it would mean a lot to me if you check out my channel:** [CoffeeXris](https://www.youtube.com/@CoffeeXris?subscribe=1) ",7,1765402774.0,gaggiaclassic,3,0.77,False
1pjfduo,https://i.redd.it/fcx7xt9j4g6g1.png,Beyond the Percentage: Maximizing Restaurant Profitability with Contribution Margin,"**1.0 Introduction: The Strategic Shift from Efficiency to Profitability**

Modern restaurant financial management is a complex balancing act of quality, service, and rigorous financial control. For decades, the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) percentage has served as the industry's primary benchmark for operational efficiency, a quick metric to gauge how effectively a restaurant turns ingredients into revenue. While valuable, its limitations present a strategic blind spot, often leading managers down a path where perceived efficiency undermines actual financial health.

The central thesis of this white paper is that a strategic transition from managing by COGS percentage to optimizing for absolute dollar **Contribution Margin (CM)** is imperative for sustained profitability. In an industry defined by high fixed costs—such as rent, insurance, and salaries—focusing on a relative efficiency metric is insufficient. Profitability is not built on percentages alone; it is built on the accumulation of real dollars available to cover overhead and generate profit. A myopic focus on a low food cost percentage can lead to flawed decisions that sacrifice higher-priced, high-margin items in favor of ""efficient"" ones that contribute far less to the bottom line.

This paper will deconstruct the flaws inherent in a percentage-only management approach. It will define the superior analytical framework of Contribution Margin, clarifying its distinction from Gross Margin and its direct link to covering fixed costs. Finally, it will provide a strategic roadmap for implementing a CM-driven model, from foundational operational requirements to its application in data-driven menu engineering, offering a clear path for executives to build a more resilient and truly profitable business.

**2.0 Deconstructing Traditional Metrics: The Role and Limits of COGS Analysis**

To understand the need for a new framework, executives must first critically assess the traditional metrics that have long governed restaurant finance. The strategic importance of any tool lies in knowing both its utility and its inherent limitations. Cost of Goods Sold analysis is a foundational element of restaurant accounting, but its scope is narrow, and relying on it for broad strategic decisions is a critical error.

**Defining Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**

In the restaurant context, Cost of Goods Sold represents the direct costs of producing the food and drinks sold to customers. This includes the cost of all ingredients, beverages, and the packaging used to serve those items. It is a variable cost that is directly tied to sales volume; as sales increase, COGS rises in tandem.

The standard formula for its calculation is a function of inventory management:

COGS = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory

This figure is typically expressed as a percentage of total sales and serves as a key indicator of procurement efficiency, portion control, and overall operational integrity. For most restaurants, a healthy COGS is considered to be in the range of **28-35% of total sales**.

However, this general benchmark must be calibrated to the specific restaurant concept, as ideal ranges vary significantly. A more granular breakdown reveals distinct performance profiles:

* **Cafes and Coffee Shops:** 20-25%
* **Pizzerias:** 22-30%
* **Fast Food & Fast Casual:** 28-33%
* **Casual Dining:** 30-35%
* **Fine Dining:** 35-40%

**The Limitations of COGS Percentage as a Primary Strategic Metric**

While COGS percentage is an essential tactical metric, its strategic value is severely limited. The COGS calculation and the resulting Gross Profit (Sales - COGS) exclusively measure production efficiency. They completely ignore the impact of all other variable costs and, more importantly, the substantial fixed operating expenses that define a restaurant's financial structure. Fixed costs like rent, utilities, insurance, and management salaries are non-negotiable and must be paid regardless of sales volume.

A ""healthy"" COGS percentage, therefore, does not guarantee net profitability. A restaurant can achieve an exemplary 28% food cost but still fail if its rent is too high or its sales volume is too low to generate enough absolute dollars to cover overhead. Furthermore, COGS analysis can serve as an **early warning system** for deeper operational failures. Unexpected spikes often signal underlying problems such as inventory shrinkage, inefficient waste management, or theft, allowing proactive managers to address challenges before they critically impact profitability. Because it provides no insight into an item's ability to contribute to fixed costs, COGS percentage is an incomplete and potentially misleading metric for strategic decision-making.

This narrow focus on production efficiency can lead to specific and costly strategic errors, often trapping managers in a cycle of optimizing for the wrong outcome.

**3.0 The Percentage Trap: When Efficiency Undermines Profit**

The ""Percentage Trap"" is a common managerial pitfall where a relentless focus on maintaining a low COGS percentage leads to suboptimal decisions that sacrifice significant absolute dollar profit. This occurs when menu items are evaluated based on their relative cost efficiency rather than their actual contribution to paying the bills. An item with a high selling price may have a high COGS in both dollars and percentage, yet still be one of the most profitable items on the menu.

**The Trap Illustrated: A Comparative Scenario**

To illustrate this conflict, consider two common menu items that are, from a COGS percentage perspective, identically ""efficient.""

**Scenario: COGS Percentage vs. Dollar Contribution**

||
||
|Metric|Premium Steak|Standard Burger|
|**Menu Price**|$42.00|$15.00|
|**COGS Percentage**|**35%**|**35%**|
|**COGS (in dollars)**|$14.70|$5.25|
|**Gross Profit (in dollars)**|**$27.30**|**$9.75**|

**Strategic Implications of the Scenario**

A manager focused solely on the 35% COGS percentage is dangerously misled into viewing both the Premium Steak and the Standard Burger as equally problematic, as both are at the high end of the acceptable range. They might even favor the burger, noting its much lower absolute ingredient cost of $5.25. This perspective, however, completely misses the most important point.

The **Premium Steak** contributes **$27.30 in absolute dollars** toward paying fixed costs like rent, utilities, and salaries. The Standard Burger, despite being equally ""efficient,"" contributes only $9.75. In other words, every steak sold does the work of nearly three burgers in helping the restaurant meet its fixed financial obligations. Eliminating or de-emphasizing the steak based on its high COGS percentage would directly and substantially reduce the restaurant's ability to cover its overhead and generate net profit.

Contribution Margin is the metric designed to avert this trap by shifting the focus from relative percentages to the absolute dollars that truly matter for profitability.

**4.0 The Superior Metric: Defining and Calculating Contribution Margin**

Contribution Margin (CM) provides the financial clarity that COGS percentage lacks. Instead of measuring efficiency in isolation, CM directly quantifies a menu item's power to cover the business's fixed costs and generate profit. It answers the most critical question for any item on the menu: after accounting for all the costs that vary with a sale, how many dollars does this sale provide to keep the lights on and build the bottom line?

**A Clear Definition of Contribution Margin**

Contribution Margin is the incremental money generated for each product sold after deducting **all variable costs**, not just the cost of goods sold. It represents the portion of sales revenue that isn't consumed by variable expenses and is thus available to contribute to paying for fixed costs.

Its calculation is straightforward:

Contribution Margin = Selling Price per Unit - Total Variable Costs per Unit

**Differentiating Contribution Margin from Gross Margin**

The critical distinction between Gross Margin (or Gross Profit) and Contribution Margin lies in the scope of costs considered. Gross Margin is a narrow measure of production efficiency, while Contribution Margin is a comprehensive measure of an item's true profitability potential.

||
||
|Metric|Costs Considered|Strategic Focus|
|**Gross Margin**|Only Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)|Production & Procurement Efficiency|
|**Contribution Margin**|COGS + All Other Variable Costs (e.g., variable labor, packaging, sales commissions, delivery fees)|True Profitability & Fixed Cost Coverage|

Failing to account for third-party delivery commissions—which can consume 20-30% of revenue per order—can create the illusion of profitability, where in reality, every sale is eroding the bottom line. Because it accounts for more costs, an item's Contribution Margin will almost always be lower than its Gross Margin, providing a more conservative and realistic view of its financial power.

**The Importance of Average Contribution Margin (ACM)**

While knowing the CM of individual items is powerful, a restaurant's overall performance can be benchmarked by calculating the **Average Contribution Margin (ACM)**. The ACM is calculated by dividing the total contribution margin generated from all sales by the total number of items sold during that period.

This average serves as a critical performance benchmark. Any menu item with a Contribution Margin below the menu's ACM is, by definition, an underperformer. It is pulling down the overall financial performance of the menu and requires immediate strategic attention, whether through repricing, cost reduction, or promotion.

By defining profitability in these absolute terms, a restaurant can move from simply managing costs to strategically engineering its entire menu for maximum financial return.

**5.0 Strategic Application: Driving Profitability Through CM-Based Menu Engineering**

The true power of Contribution Margin is realized when it is applied as the core profitability metric in menu engineering. This data-driven process transforms a menu from a simple list of offerings into a strategic tool for profit maximization. By systematically analyzing each item's performance, operators can make informed decisions to promote high-performers, improve underachievers, and eliminate financial drains.

**The Structure of the Menu Engineering Matrix**

The foundation of this strategy is the Menu Engineering Matrix, a four-quadrant grid that plots every menu item based on two critical axes:

* **Popularity (X-axis):** The number of units sold over a specific period.
* **Contribution Margin (Y-axis):** The absolute dollar contribution of each item.

This visualization provides an immediate, clear snapshot of the menu's financial structure, categorizing each item into one of four distinct classifications.

**The Four Menu Categories and CM-Driven Strategies**

Each quadrant of the matrix corresponds to a specific category of menu item, and each category dictates a clear set of strategic actions aimed at boosting overall profitability.

* **Stars (High CM, High Popularity)**
   * **Description:** These are your most valuable items, the champions of your menu that are both highly profitable and widely loved by customers.
   * **Strategy:** Maintain their quality and consistency at all costs. Feature them prominently on the menu using design elements like boxes or callouts. Train service staff to proactively recommend them and use them in marketing campaigns to attract customers.
* **Plowhorses (Low CM, High Popularity)**
   * **Description:** These are the crowd-pleasers—popular and reliable but generating less profit than they should.
   * **Strategy:** The goal is to carefully increase profitability without reducing their high sales volume. In addition to small, strategic price increases or slight portion adjustments, recognize their strategic value in providing inventory stability and leveraging bulk discounts that optimize the CM of the entire menu.
* **Puzzles (High CM, Low Popularity)**
   * **Description:** These items are profitable on a per-unit basis but are undersold. They represent a significant untapped opportunity.
   * **Strategy:** Focus on increasing popularity. Improve their menu placement, rewrite descriptions with more appealing and vivid language, and make them a focus of server recommendations. Special promotions or offering a small sample can also entice customers to try them.
* **Dogs (Low CM, Low Popularity)**
   * **Description:** These items are neither popular nor profitable. They add complexity to kitchen operations and inventory management without contributing meaningfully to the bottom line.
   * **Strategy:** The true cost of a Dog is the **opportunity cost** it represents—the operational friction it creates and the resources that could be better applied to boosting sales of Stars or converting Puzzles. In most cases, these items should be removed from the menu to simplify operations, reduce waste, and free up valuable menu space.

By implementing this CM-based framework, a restaurant can move beyond guesswork and systematically optimize its primary source of revenue.

**6.0 Operational Imperatives for a CM-Driven Model**

Adopting a Contribution Margin-driven strategy requires more than a conceptual shift; it demands a commitment to investing in the specific operational and technological capabilities needed to ensure data accuracy and timeliness. Without a solid foundation of reliable data, any CM analysis will be flawed, leading to misguided strategic decisions.

**The Technological Foundation**

Modern restaurant operations generate a vast amount of data. Harnessing this data for CM analysis requires integrated systems that can communicate seamlessly.

* **Real-Time Recipe Costing:** Static recipe costing is a primary source of margin erosion. In a volatile market where ingredient prices fluctuate daily, a real-time, invoice-linked costing system is not a luxury but a fundamental requirement for accurate financial control. This ensures that the variable cost for each menu item is always current, making CM calculations precise and reliable.
* **POS and Inventory Integration:** A successful menu engineering matrix is impossible without the tight integration of Point-of-Sale (POS) and inventory/costing software. The POS system tracks popularity by recording the sales volume of each item, while the inventory and costing software tracks all the variable costs. The ability to automatically combine these two data streams is non-negotiable for generating an accurate and actionable analysis.

**Necessary Accounting and Procedural Rigor**

Technology alone is not enough. It must be supported by disciplined and consistent internal procedures to maintain the integrity of the data.

* **Accurate Cost Segregation:** The entire premise of Contribution Margin rests on the ability to correctly identify and separate fixed costs from variable costs in the restaurant's accounting. Misclassifying a semi-variable cost or incorrectly allocating an expense can materially distort CM calculations and lead to flawed conclusions about an item's profitability. This requires meticulous bookkeeping and a clear chart of accounts.
* **Consistent Inventory Management:** The accuracy of any cost analysis begins and ends with inventory. Regular, precise, and consistent physical inventory counts are the foundation for calculating the true cost of goods consumed. Without this discipline, the COGS component of the variable cost calculation becomes unreliable, compromising the validity of the entire CM framework.

A successful transition to a CM-driven model requires a dual commitment: a strategic willingness to embrace a new metric and an operational dedication to building the infrastructure needed to support it. This framework moves CM analysis from a retrospective metric to a forward-looking planning tool by enabling calculation of the business’s break-even point:

Break Even Revenue = Total Fixed Costs / Contribution Margin Ratio

**7.0 Conclusion: Adopting the Margin Mindset for Long-Term Success**

In the competitive and financially demanding restaurant industry, clinging to outdated metrics is a liability. While Cost of Goods Sold percentage remains a useful tactical measure of production efficiency, it is an insufficient guide for strategic decision-making. Contribution Margin is the superior strategic metric for maximizing restaurant profitability because it focuses on what truly matters: the absolute dollars each sale generates to cover fixed overheads and contribute to the bottom line. Adopting a CM-driven model moves management from a narrow focus on cost control to a comprehensive strategy for profit optimization.

To build a more resilient and profitable business, restaurant executives should embrace the following key takeaways and embed them into their financial strategy:

1. **Focus on Dollars, Not Just Percentages** Fixed costs like rent and salaries are paid with absolute dollars, not percentages. Contribution Margin is the only metric that directly measures the dollar contribution of each sale toward covering those non-negotiable costs and generating net profit.
2. **Embrace Comprehensive Costing** A true understanding of an item's profitability requires accounting for *all* variable costs associated with its sale. This includes not only the cost of ingredients but also other direct expenses such as sales commissions and third-party delivery fees, which can significantly erode margins if ignored.
3. **Leverage Data-Driven Strategy** Use Contribution Margin-based menu engineering as a recurring, data-driven process. This allows for the systematic optimization of the menu mix by enhancing profitable items, improving underperformers, and simplifying operations through the elimination of financial drains.

By shifting their financial perspective from the ""Percentage Trap"" to the ""Margin Mindset,"" restaurant leaders can unlock greater profitability and make more intelligent, data-informed decisions. Adopting the Contribution Margin model as a foundational element of financial strategy is not just an accounting change; it is a strategic imperative for building a business that is positioned for long-term success.",1,1765402724.0,DataDrivenRestaurant,0,1.0,False

1pjfbju,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_One-Brilliant9136/comments/1pjfbju/coffee_chat_journal_2_realtor/,[Coffee Chat Journal 2] Realtor,"Based on our surroundings and comfort level, we shape shift. My outgoing and openly focused personality diminished in my next coffee chat as I was overwhelmed by the personality of the realtor I met. For confidentiality reasons, she will be referred to as JC. From the moment JC stepped into the café we met at, she was moving quickly, speaking with purpose, and radiating an almost electric level of energy. I braced myself for an impact of personality, and she certainly delivered. She was pushy in a way that felt intentional and driven, making her presence impossible to ignore, and energetic enough to make even a slow morning feel fast-paced with her around. It was clear that her personality was not just a trait but a professional asset in her line of work. I began to understand how perfectly her characteristics aligned with the demands of the real estate industry. JC explained that a realtor has to move as their external forces move: her clients, the market, or another real estate agent. The life of a realtor does not unfold in a self-paced manner, but instead moves at a pace that can feel chaotic to those unprepared for it, or even those who are prepared. The reasoning for her personality made a lot of sense to me when she described that real estate is a career that rewards urgency. There is rarely time to sit with a decision or procrastinate on action that can still guarantee the same results. Listening to her describe her work so vividly helped me visualize the gap between what I imagined the real estate profession to be and what it actually is. Before the chat, I understood the idea of becoming a realtor someday as a job that facilitated flexible schedules, independence, and the opportunity to meet new people. While two of those things are correct, I learned from JC that a flexible schedule is constituted by many uncontrollable factors. A realtor's schedule is at the mercy of a client, buyer, or seller. Without them, no sale or action is usually made, and collaboration is key to a smooth and successful deal. Her personality and passion for her profession revealed that real estate is not just about selling homes, but also managing unexpected chaos with confidence, maintaining relentless momentum, and navigating constant emotional fluctuations from clients who are often under stress themselves. Most importantly, this conversation forced me to reflect honestly on my own working style. I tend to value stability and predictability. I prefer having time to think through decisions, organize my tasks, and approach problems with a calm and methodical mindset. The fast-paced environment would be ideal for me in this profession, but the lack of predictability and uncertainty surrounding sales or outcomes could be overwhelming for my personality. This realization didn’t leave me feeling disappointed. Instead, I felt grateful for her time and for sharing her insights. Understanding what kind of work environment is not a good fit is just as important as finding one that is. My conversation with JC helped me sharpen my self-awareness and avoid idealizing a profession without understanding its challenges. Now, I am always sure to ask every person I have a coffee chat with the question, “Is there anything about your job that might be a turnoff for others? (ex. Long hours, minimal vacation opportunities, too much travel, instability, etc.)”. In the end, the coffee chat was a valuable reminder that informational interviews are as much about self-discovery as they are about career exploration. JC helped me see that while I admire the passion and drive required to succeed in real estate, it may not be the right long-term path for me. ",1,1765402567.0,u_One-Brilliant9136,0,1.0,False

And if so, what will actually last?","Hi all. I have a four year old [Saeco Xelsis SM7684. ](https://www.usa.philips.com/c-p/SM7684_04/xelsis-super-automatic-espresso-machine/overview)It's been regularly cleaned, descaled, and lubed, but recently froze up. I took it in to Seattle Coffee Gear and it seems the air intake solenoid has broken and leaked water. The quote to repair it and do a full service is about $740 with tax.   
  
Given the machine was about $1900 new, I question if it make sense to have it fixed. It also had an issue with a control board about 2 years in that was replaced under warranty as well. It's worth noting seems Saeco has exited the US market and when I took it in originally, SCG wasn't sure if they could get parts to fix it.

We've really liked the machine otherwise, but my incination is just give up on the thing as frustrating as that is and buy a new machine. I'm hoping to get something actually reliable that will last 10+ years if taken care of. I have a Miele dishwasher and vacuum and have been impressed with their quality and Miele's position that their products should last 20 years. Jura is another option, though it seems they don't have removable brew groups on many machines so I wonder how that affects longevity.

What is the consensus? Does it make sense to suck it up and pay (given repair is still only 1/2 to 1/3 of an equivalent unit) and that most superautomatics tend to have issues? Or should I just give up and get another machine and if so, what is generally regarded as the most reliable option? Would love to hear thoughts.",1,1765402534.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

You can beat most of these people out here.

How do I know?

Just look at the emails you get sent, or LinkedIn dms you receive.

People are LAZY. 

They throw in to AI, “help me write a 3 step sequence on our product for (ICP)”.

Then fire it out there, and it gets barely any traction. 

And they complain, say crap like “cold email dead”, “no one is interested” and so on. 

But here is why it got no traction. 

And I want you to say it after me.

We. only. write. like. a. human.

Humans.

Emotion driven creatures who experience the world everyday.

We have kids.

We have problems. 

Our coffee ruined our best white t-shirt today (side note, this is why I wear mostly black especially with 2 young kids). 

Next time you create a sequence or an outreach message, inject it with emotion. 

For those of you non native English speakers, it will be hard for you. 

Someone with 20-30 years of writing and speaking in English, have an immense advantage in nuance in getting their message across.

But engross yourself in TV/Articles/Podcasts/YouTube and you will start to learn.

Anyway back to the point… emotion.

Be creative in how you write. 

Let’s say for example.

We have “Bob”.

“Bob” is a VP of sales in Nashville. 

Bob works in the marketing vertical.

We could say something like.

“Hey Bob, 

Have something that will make your life easier.

But quick side note

Saw you are living in Nashville? God, you must be sick of seeing cowboy boots! 

Or maybe you have 20 pairs? (I don’t judge either way) I recently went out myself in Nashville - what a place. Irish bar had great guinness. 

Anyway Bob, let me get to the point.

Are you sick to the teeth of watching your sales guys working those crap inbound leads from meta ads? 

We all know they are never going to buy, but you have quota to hit.

The stress is real, I felt the same before we figured out a better way. 

We have a way we can get you booked calls directly into your calendar, with your dream clients. 

Can I show you how? 

Josh

p.s. once you are closing these leads, are we going out for BBQ (Nashville is supposed to have a few killer spots)?
“
Is that the best first outreach? 

Probably not.

But is better than 99% of what is out there.

Yes.

And btw, rules are supposed to be broken.

Some people write super short emails and it works. 

Other write super long and it works. 

I like the longer stuff.

But not bible long.

Anyway.

Point of this entire post is this.

Write with emotion and be creative.

No more AI laziness.

And your reply rate will increase 🚀

We hired a professional, highly rated, 25 years in business, roofing company to fix our roof. We are paying them $20k for full shingle replacement and full decking upgrade. This is a legit company, with a high profile in our state.

The first day they were here working, I was enjoying my coffee looking out our back patio, when suddenly my view was one of the men peeing in my backyard. We are in the heart of the city, you can see the elementary school kids on the playground from my dining room, and he did not try to conceal himself in anyway. We are surrounded by houses and a school, my neighbors all work from home or are retired. I let my dog out to make our presence known, and they still continued this throughout the day. I have at least 3 of the workers pissing in my yard, and twice in our back neighbors yard. At one point they left for lunch, returned, and immediately when and peed in our yard. I could not speak to anyone because they did not speak English (not against this, just clarifying), no one asked to use our toilet and we are less than a minute drive to places like McDonald’s. I am also a disabled female who was home alone and did not feel comfortable. I understand having to go but I expect a company who does this 24-7 should have procedures in place.

Then once they had packed up for the day and were about to leave. I have one of them aggressively trying to pull out OUR 12ft ladder, from between our shed and boats. This ladder was buried under snow and not accessible. They banged our canoe all around while doing so, and thankfully the ladder was frozen to the ground. I cannot see any practical reason for them doing this, other than they planned on stealing it. Can anyone tell me if it would even be legal for them to use our ladder if they needed an extra? Or would this be against their own company insurance?

I did not contact the office because the job was not done and I was afraid they would cancel, right before an extreme storm. Now my husband says I shouldn’t say anything “because it’s done and looks good”. I am struggling with this because I have managed companies myself and I would want to know. But I am not a roofer, so this is where I come to you all. I was not planning on approaching this rudely. More along the lines of, we appreciate the work and love our new roof but you may want to know this is happening. The office and quote crew were locals, the laborers were not, and I don’t think the folks we set it up with likely have anything to do with the crews. If this was your company would you want to know?

I will also say I am all for peeing in the woods, we are avid outdoors people. But our home is in the city, and now there are multiple human piss spots where my kids and dog are supposed to play. Thanks everyone!",2,1765402452.0,WhatShouldIDo,1,1.0,False

Never thought I'd have to do this, but a series of very unlucky events have gone against me. Had falling out with my terribly greedy landlord 2 weeks back, and I've had to move houses all of a sudden. Landlord refuses to reimburse even a single penny of my deposit, and obviously had to pay a deposit to my new place, which is fine, had enough cover for that, and in process of taking LL to court.Unfortunately, got robbed here in my new town, and my phone, work laptop and bank card(s) got stolen

Other stuff has happened too, but long story short, my only option was getting these ridiculous payday loans, already had to borrow £300 and I really don't wanna go into more debt there and ruin my credit score. Would appreciate if anyone can lend me £100, which hopefully lasts me till 20th on which date i get my salary and can pay back, would appreciate and pray for the kind soul who can help me out in this predicament.

Neither William Vance nor I saw it coming.

Seven years of silence, broken by a chance encounter at the Riverton track.

He was as handsome as ever, though the years had smoothed his rough edges.

He watched me with a look that felt like a secret being kept.

“Elizabeth. It is been a long time.”

I gave him a curt nod from atop my horse.

Then I kicked my mount into a gallop, leaving him in the dust.

He stood there by the rail, and I could feel his gaze burning into my back.

The whispers around us grew louder.

“I never thought I would see the day the Emerald Syndicate boss and his ex-wife played nice.”

They had a point.

Our history was written in blood.

William’s bodyguards were twitchy, hands hovering near their jackets.

They looked like they expected me to pull a piece and paint the fence with his brains.

But he was just my ex-husband.

He was not worth a prison sentence.

…

I dismounted without sparing William a second glance.

I grabbed my coat from my security detail and turned to leave.

“Elizabeth... can we talk?”

He stepped in my path, blocking the sun just like he used to.

I smirked and slid my sunglasses on with deliberate slowness.

“The line to talk to me stretches all the way to France,” I said coolly. “What makes you think you can cut in?”

“Besides,” I added, brushing past him. “We are not exactly on speaking terms.”

I threw an order to my assistant over my shoulder.

“Get Anna on the phone. Tell her I am accepting her offer.”

People in Riverton did not waste time.

Thirty minutes later, Anna Salvatore was lounging in front of me, nursing a coffee.

“Well, look at you, Elizabeth. You turned me down flat before, so what changed?”

I stared at Mount Saint Julian, watching the sun bleed out over the peaks.

Finally, I blew a plume of smoke into the air.

“I want to burn the Vance legacy to the ground.”

She sat up, the languid pose vanishing.

“You are serious.”

I did not smile.

The Salvatore heiress did not look scared, though.

If anything, she looked entertained.

“So the rumors are true? You are still hung up on William, so you are going to destroy his family just to keep him in a cage?”

She recited the tabloid version of my life.

The childhood friends, the interloping stepsister, the heartbroken flight abroad.

Now, the vengeful return to reclaim the man.

I let out a dry laugh and flicked my ash.

The Riverton press certainly had a flair for the dramatic.

These sentences to summarize a lifetime of pain.

But no outsider could understand the tangled mess of love and hate that bound us.

1pjf36f,https://i.redd.it/x24bg59j2g6g1.jpeg,"7 Things You Need to Know Before Moving to Leonia, NJ","**Quick Summary:**  
Thinking about [moving to Leonia, NJ](https://www.movingofamerica.com/locations/leonia-movers/)? This guide breaks down the *seven most important things* future residents should know—from commute times to schools, community culture, and housing expectations.

# 1. [Leonia Is One of NJ’s Best](https://www.movingofamerica.com/blog/living-in-leonia-nj/) Small “Creative Suburbs”

Leonia has a well-known artistic and culturally rich history. The town hosts active arts guilds, theater programs, and community events that make it feel more like a tight-knit village than a typical New Jersey suburb. If you value **community, creativity, and walkability**, Leonia is an underrated gem.

# 2. The Commute to NYC Is Shockingly Easy (But Not Always Simple)

Located just over a mile from the George Washington Bridge, Leonia offers fast access to Manhattan.  
**But here’s the nuance:** route choices and peak-hour traffic can vary dramatically. Many residents rely on express buses to Port Authority or rideshare to nearby Fort Lee transit stops.

>

# 3. Leonia Has a “Resident-First” Traffic Policy

In 2018, Leonia became known for restricting certain shortcut streets during peak times to *residents only*—a response to navigation apps sending thousands of cars through town.  
This policy helps maintain quiet neighborhoods, but it also means new residents must stay informed about updated regulations and obtain required permits.

# 4. Homes Move Fast—And You Need to Act Fast

The housing market in Leonia tends to be competitive because:

* Inventory is limited
* Proximity to NYC drives demand
* The town’s quiet feel attracts families relocating from urban areas

Expect older charm-filled colonial homes, modest lot sizes, and higher price-per-square-foot than surrounding towns.

# 5. The Schools Are Small, Personal, and Highly Involved

Leonia’s schools are known for strong arts programs, diversity, and close teacher–student relationships.

  
Because the district draws from both Leonia and Edgewater (high school only), it offers more academic and extracurricular options than you’d expect from such a small town.

# 6. It’s a Walkable Town With a True Community Core

Broad Avenue is the heart of Leonia—lined with restaurants, coffee shops, local stores, and service businesses. This main street is one of the biggest lifestyle perks, especially if you’re coming from a walkable city and want to keep that experience.

# 7. Expect a Quiet, Residential Lifestyle (Not a Bustling Suburban Hub)

If you’re looking for nightlife, large shopping centers, or entertainment complexes, you’ll be visiting Fort Lee or Edgewater often. Leonia prioritizes **neighborhood charm over commercial expansion**, which is exactly why many people move here.

# Key Takeaways

* Leonia is ideal for people seeking a *creative, community-driven suburb* close to NYC.
* Commutes are fast geographically but depend heavily on timing and route choice.
* Traffic regulations are unique—great for locals, confusing at first for newcomers.
* Housing demand is strong, and walkability + quiet streets are major lifestyle wins.",1,1765402016.0,u_movingofamerica,0,1.0,False

I generally avoid the typical made in overseas trinket/cheap trash that gets peddled around at all the touristy spots all over the world.  But for Hawaii (specifically Big Island if anyone has better knowledge) wanted to see what stores/brands/areas sell actually locally made/authentic gifts/souveniors? 

I specifically can use another coffee/tea mug if anyone has good recs on that. I was looking at doing a coffee farm tour with Kona Joes and saw they include a coffee mug as part of their paid tour. I'm sure there are tons of your typical gift shops in Kohala and Kona area so I'd likely avoid the typical places (ABC store, Walmart, etc.) so wanted to see what are some places I get locally made things.

1pjew5u,https://i.redd.it/duc3nfc51g6g1.jpeg,Choosing Who Truly Loves Me,"My brother drowned trying to save someone, and the dive team wanted $30,000 to recover his body.
I finally worked up the courage to call my multi-millionaire boyfriend, who I'd been secretly dating for ten years, to borrow the money.
His cold voice came through the phone.
“Do you think money grows on trees? That I can just toss you thirty grand whenever you ask?”
“Look, I've got a meeting soon. I don't have time to talk about a measly thirty thousand dollars.”
Then he hung up.
And had his secretary send me another digital copy of the “Girlfriend Operations Manual.”
Staring at the PDF file in my WhatsApp chat, I let out a bitter laugh and called the man who was willing to give me his entire fortune.
“That offer you made… about giving me everything you own if I marry you. Is it still on the table?”
...
At the funeral, I looked at the black-and-white photo of my brother on the wall, then turned gratefully to the man holding vigil with me.
“Thank you. Thank you so much for helping me get my brother's body back.”
“Don't worry. Once my brother's funeral is over, I'll come home and marry you.”
A flicker of pain crossed his face.
“If you don't want to, we don't have to—”
I cut him off. “No, I want to.”
Why wouldn't I want to? It's been three days since my brother—my only family—died saving someone's life. Three days I've spent crying myself hoarse. The whole world knows my brother is gone.
The only one who doesn't is Jackson Cooper, the man I've been dating for a decade.
Our social circles were completely separate.
He'd never taken me to meet his friends, and he'd always scoffed at the idea of meeting mine.
Besides, Jackson was a multi-millionaire whose time was measured in thousands of dollars per minute.
He'd never deign to waste a second looking at my social media posts.
He didn't just not know that my brother, the only family I had left, was dead.
He didn't even know that I almost couldn't recover his body because I couldn't afford the recovery fee.
A sharp, trembling pain shot through my chest.
But at least Jackson and I would have nothing to do with each other anymore.
So, on the day of my brother's funeral, I texted Jackson and broke up with him.
An instant reply popped up on WhatsApp.
“Ms. Henderson, Mr. Cooper is traveling for business tomorrow. Please have two pairs of dress shoes, three suits, and their matching shirts ready for him.”
Reading the reply that completely ignored my message, my heart sank with a dull, frustrating ache. It was like punching a pillow.
Because the person who replied wasn't Jackson. It was his secretary, Sophia Stewart.
For the ten years Jackson and I were together, Sophia was a constant presence in our “love story.”
In her first year as Jackson's secretary, she personally drafted a “Girlfriend Operations Manual” for him.
She said that for the sake of efficiency, she hoped my relationship with Jackson could be as streamlined and professional as any other task.
In this manual, she specified that I didn't need to remind Jackson about our anniversary; she would prepare a gift for me on his behalf.
I didn't need to ask him about daily necessities; she would arrange everything for me.
Even if I wanted to see Jackson, I didn't need to ask him. I just had to submit a “date request” to her, and she would schedule it.
On top of all that, nearly every aspect of our lives—buying condoms, groceries, clothes, and everyday outfits—was handled by Sophia.
I hated the rules Sophia created and fought with Jackson about it countless times.
But every time, he would just look at me calmly.
“Harper, besides managing my personal life, Sophia also has to handle a ton of administrative work for the company. She doesn't have time for your childish tantrums.”
I used to be speechless every time he shot me down.
But now, I've accepted it.
It's true. Sophia is his right-hand woman. An Ivy League grad who can charm clients and run his company, his home, and even his girlfriend.
And me? What am I?
Just an insignificant employee in his company's operations department for ten years.
A girlfriend of ten years whose existence no one even knows about.
Since he admires Sophia so much, he can have her.
After all, my only brother is dead. I almost couldn't even get his body back. And when I asked him—a multi-millionaire—to borrow $30,000…
He, on Sophia's advice, told me to go through official company channels and file a formal request.
Chapter 2
A tremor of pain shot through my chest, but my fingers still shook as I texted Sophia back.
“Ms. Stewart, I don't have time to pack anything for Jackson. If you don't mind, you can go over to the house and get your boss ready yourself.”
“Also, according to your corporate handbook, I need to file a request seven days in advance to break up with Jackson. So, please log this officially. And tell Jackson as soon as you can that we're done.”
We were over. I typed the words with brutal force, biting my lip so hard I tasted blood.
Sophia's reply came instantly.
“Understood, Ms. Henderson. I've officially logged it.”
The pain in my chest came back, sharp and suffocating.
If my Uber hadn't arrived just then, I would have broken down crying in the rain.
I was so sick of this feeling—like punching a pillow, all my anger just getting absorbed with no impact.
I first went to my late brother's apartment to pack up his belongings. After shipping them back to our hometown, I finally made the trip back to the city, back to the home I shared with Jackson.
The moment I walked through the door, I saw Jackson on the sofa.
He was lounging against the cushions, his hair damp. Water droplets trickled from the open V-neck of his robe.
This used to be the sight of him I loved most.
I subconsciously pressed my lips together and started to walk toward him.
Just then, a flirtatious voice called out from the bathroom.
“Jackson, can I blow-dry your hair for you now?”
As she spoke, a figure in a red slip emerged from the bathroom.
I turned my head, and my eyes locked with Sophia's.
My grip on my suitcase handle tightened when I saw the bright red nightgown she was wearing.
That nightgown was the only present Jackson had ever personally bought for me.
I'd treasured it so much that I'd only worn it a single time.
I never imagined I'd see it on Sophia.
I took a deep breath.
“Sorry to interrupt. Looks like I came back at a bad time.”
As I said that, I picked up my suitcase and turned to leave.
But Jackson strode over and grabbed my arm, his voice tight with anger. “Harper, what the hell are you doing now? Sophia and I got caught in a storm while we were out checking on a project. That's all.”
God, I really tried to hold it in. I was supposed to be marrying another man in four days.
I was only back to quit my job and break up with Jackson for good.
I didn't care what he and Sophia did outside our home.
But I couldn't stomach him letting her parade around in my nightgown, in the house I'd thought of as ours, while we were still technically together.
“So, are you going to tell me those aren't your hickeys all over her?”
That's right. The nightgown was lingerie, more or less. It was sheer and cut low, so I had a perfect view of the hickeys she was trying to hide under the thin lace.
A flash of panic crossed Jackson's face.
But Sophia chose that exact moment to chime in. “Ms. Henderson, the marks on my body are my own private affair. It has absolutely nothing to do with you. You have no right to question me.”
“If you feel like my presence is a problem, I can stop coming to this house. But I really hope you'll stop storming out over every little thing. Do you have any idea how busy Jackson is? You put him through this constantly. He's a person, Harper. He gets tired, too.”
Spoken like a true Ivy League graduate. In just a few sentences, Sophia had painted me as the hysterical, unreasonable one.
Fighting back the ache that swelled in my chest, I opened my mouth to tear into Sophia.
But Jackson cut me off, his face hardening. “Harper, apologize to Sophia. Now. She's my assistant, not your punching bag.”
“I'm warning you, stop pushing my limits.”
My face was ashen as I looked at Jackson.
Of course. He would always, always protect Sophia first.
My chest was so tight I could barely breathe, but I spat each word back at him:
“Jackson, you want me to apologize to her? In your dreams.”
Chapter 3
Without another glance at Jackson, I turned and went back to my room.
But the moment the door clicked shut, tears started streaming down my face.
As if to punish me, Jackson didn't come to my room that night.
A bitter smile touched my lips at the thought.
I was his girlfriend, but I felt more like his mistress.
He could walk into my room whenever he wanted.
But if I needed him, I had to knock, and I could only go in if he said yes.
If he was in a bad mood, he wouldn't even bother with a simple “I'm busy.”
But right now, that worked for me. With the wedding just four days away, I didn't want much to do with him anyway.
When I got up the next morning, Jackson was already at the dining table.
He pointed to a sandwich on the plate at the spot next to him.
“I got up this morning and made this for you myself.”
This was always his go-to way of making peace.
In the past, just to give him an out, I would always eat whatever breakfast he made for me, no matter how upset I was.
Even though Jackson was a genuinely terrible cook and his food tasted awful.
But this time, I didn't sit down next to him like I usually did.
Instead, I took the seat across from him and called for Lucy.
“Lucy, could you please get me a bowl of oatmeal?”
Jackson's brow furrowed as he looked at me.
“All I did was ask you to apologize to Sophia last night. Why are you being so dramatic?”
“Sophia is my right-hand woman. You know I can't lose her. If you scare her off, how am I supposed to get any work done?”
My chest tightened instinctively as I looked into his deceptively gentle eyes.
Jackson and I had met during our internships. I didn't know the CEO back then, so when I was on a coffee run for the department one day, I asked him to hit the elevator button for me.
After that, flowers started showing up for me every few days, until a month later, when Jackson called and asked me to dinner.
We met for the first time at a five-star hotel. He was a perfect gentleman—knowledgeable, witty, and charming. I was completely won over on our first official date.
Six months later, I moved into his house.
The first year of our relationship was pure bliss.
He would bake all sorts of pastries for me from scratch. When I caught a cold, he would ditch his meetings and rush home to take care of me.
Because we didn't want to go public, he'd stay late at the office when I had to work overtime. Then we'd sneak around like thieves, eating late-night snacks and kissing in his office.
I'm sure of it—the old Jackson was crazy about me.
But ever since Sophia became his assistant, even getting a gentle look from him had become a luxury.
I forced a small smile and said coolly:
“If you can't live without Sophia, you should just marry her. Lock her down with a marriage certificate. Wouldn't that be the safest bet?”
His irritation was obvious. I didn't even have to guess; I knew he was about to tell me to stop being unreasonable.
So I cut in first.
“Jackson, we should break—”
Before I could finish, Sophia walked in from outside the house.
“Jackson, it's eight o'clock. We need to head to the office now.”
Jackson's face went cold. He immediately stood up, grabbed his suit jacket, and followed her out.
It was like landing a punch on a pillow.
It didn't hurt, but it was suffocating.
Chapter 4
Not long after Jackson and Sophia left, I grabbed my bag and headed to the office.
The moment I arrived, my boss called me into his office.
With a frustrated look, he slid a performance review across the desk to me.
“Harper, I'm so sorry. I really did my best. I was sure you'd be taking my spot after I left, but I never expected the higher-ups to veto my recommendation unanimously.”
Seeing the guilt in my manager's eyes, I just calmly pulled out my own resignation letter.
“Mr. Clark, it's okay. I've already decided to quit.”
Mr. Clark stared at me in surprise. “You're really quitting? You've busted your ass for this company for ten years. You've solved so many problems for us, and now you're just going to leave?”
A bitter smile touched my lips.
But that was exactly why I had to quit. I'd given this company ten years of my life, worked my fingers to the bone, and I still hadn't gotten a single thing I wanted.
Jackson once made me a promise: if I could just make it to Operations Manager, he'd take me home to meet his parents, and we'd get married.
I believed him.
I worked insane overtime; I fought to be the top performer.
But no matter how hard I tried, even when I had the best performance record and the highest review scores in the company, the Operations Manager position was filled again and again, and it was never me.
I'd fought with Jackson about it countless times, but he would always just give me this cold stare.
“Harper, if you can't get the position, it just means you're not capable enough. You should be reflecting on how to improve instead of coming to me to whine and use our relationship to get ahead.”
That was the first time I felt a true chill in my heart.
Because it wasn't just about marrying Jackson; I desperately wanted the recognition for all my hard work.
Maybe the pain in my chest was just too much. I couldn't hold back the tears welling in my eyes.
Not wanting to show my weakness in front of Mr. Clark, I shot to my feet. “Sorry, Mr. Clark, I need to use the restroom.”
Sobs wracked my body, muffled by the sound of a flushing toilet in the stall.
It was only then that I realized just how wronged and bitter I felt after ten years with Jackson.
And just as I was hiding in the stall, crying my eyes out, I heard voices from outside the door.
“Did you hear? Mr. Clark from Operations is leaving, and he recommended Harper for his job.”
“Ms. Stewart, other people might not know, but everyone in the admin office knows Mr. Cooper promised Harper they'd get married as soon as she became Operations Manager.”
Sophia let out a cold laugh. “As if an idiot like Harper deserves to marry Jackson. Don't worry. I stopped her from getting the promotion before, and I can do it again.”
“That idiot Harper is surprisingly persistent. I kept messing with her year-end bonuses, trying to force her to quit, but she just toughed it out.”
A massive wave of hatred surged through my chest.
All these years at the company, every other employee who performed well got a generous year-end bonus.
All the senior staff got raises based on seniority, but I was still stuck at an entry-level salary.
That was why I couldn't even afford to have my brother's body recovered—why I had to go crying to Jackson to borrow money.
I never imagined Sophia was behind it all.
Furious, I slammed open the stall door and rushed out. “Sophia! It was you, wasn't it? You've been shorting my pay all these years!”
“If you like Jackson, you could have just told me! I would have stepped aside! Why did you have to play all these dirty tricks behind my back?”
With that, I lunged forward and slapped Sophia hard across the face.
Rage instantly flared on Sophia's face.
Just as I braced myself for her to slap me back…
She suddenly dropped to her knees in front of me. “Ms. Henderson, I know you're Mr. Cooper's girlfriend! I can't afford to get on your bad side, so can't I at least get out of your way? I'll quit today! I'm begging you, just stop bullying me, stop hitting me! I know I was wrong, please, just let me go!”
I froze, completely stunned by her actions.
The next second, a cold, sharp voice came from the entrance of the restroom.

As you navigate through the intricacies of launching a successful business, understanding the essential components—licensing, rent, equipment, and client acquisition—will be crucial to your success. In this comprehensive guide, you will discover the vital steps necessary to transform your vision into reality. First, you'll need to familiarize yourself with the licensing requirements specific to your region to ensure compliance with local regulations. Securing an appropriate location is equally important, as rent can significantly impact your budget and clientele. 

Once your space is established, investing in high-quality equipment will enhance your services and create an inviting atmosphere for your customers. Finally, developing effective strategies to attract and retain clients will be key to sustaining your business long-term. This guide serves as your roadmap, offering insights and practical advice to help you navigate each stage of the process, empowering you to build a thriving hair salon that reflects your unique style and approach. Let’s dive in and explore the essential elements that will lay the foundation for your successful hair salon venture.

 

# Understand necessary licenses for compliance.

 

Navigating the various licenses required for your hair salon is essential to ensure compliance with local regulations and to avoid potential legal issues. You will need to research the specific requirements in your area, as they can vary significantly between states and municipalities. Typically, a cosmetology license is mandatory for you and your staff to legally provide hair services, along with a business license to operate as a legitimate entity. Additionally, you may need to acquire health permits and follow safety guidelines related to sanitation and hygiene.

 

It's also wise to stay updated on any changes in legislation that could impact your salon. Engaging with local business organizations or consulting with a legal expert in the industry can provide valuable insights into maintaining compliance. By taking these steps, you can create a solid foundation for your business while ensuring a safe and professional environment for your clients.

 

# Choose the perfect salon location wisely.

 

Selecting the right location for your salon is a crucial step that can significantly influence your success. Look for areas with high foot traffic, such as shopping districts or near popular attractions, as these locations can draw in potential clients who may not have been aware of your services otherwise. Consider the demographics of the neighborhood; understanding the local population’s preferences and spending habits will help you tailor your services accordingly. Additionally, assess the competition in the area. A bustling neighborhood with a few salons can be beneficial, but if there are too many similar businesses, it might be challenging to stand out and capture your target market.

 

Don't overlook the practicalities of the chosen site, such as visibility, accessibility, and parking options. A well-located salon with easy access can make a significant difference in attracting clients, particularly those who may have mobility issues or are in a hurry. Furthermore, evaluate the rental costs and ensure they align with your budget and financial projections. Balancing an ideal spot with manageable costs will support a sustainable business model as you grow. Ultimately, investing time and effort into selecting the perfect location can set the stage for a thriving salon that attracts and retains a loyal clientele.

 

# Invest in essential salon equipment wisely.

 

When setting up your salon, allocating your budget for essential equipment is key to ensuring efficient operations and client satisfaction. Prioritize high-quality tools that are durable and reliable, such as professional-grade scissors, clippers, and styling chairs. Investing in equipment that enhances the client experience, like comfortable shampoo stations and efficient drying units, can lead to repeat business and positive word-of-mouth referrals. While it may be tempting to choose the most affordable options, remember that quality often translates to longevity and performance, ultimately saving you money in the long run.

 

Additionally, consider the layout and flow of your salon when purchasing equipment. Ensure that your chosen items not only serve their purpose but also fit seamlessly into your space, allowing for smooth transitions between services. Create a budget that allows for both essential items and a few additional pieces that can elevate your service offerings, such as specialized tools for color treatments or products that cater to various hair types. This thoughtful approach to equipment investment not only equips you for success but also sets the tone for a professional atmosphere that clients will appreciate.

 

# Develop effective strategies to attract clients.

 

To successfully draw in clients, focus on building a strong online presence that showcases your unique services and personality. Utilize social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook to share high-quality images of your work, client transformations, and salon events. Engaging with your audience through tutorials, live Q&A sessions, and behind-the-scenes content can help foster a sense of community and encourage potential clients to choose your salon over others. Additionally, consider implementing a referral program that rewards existing clients for bringing in friends and family, turning your loyal customer base into eager brand ambassadors.

 

Another effective strategy is to offer limited-time promotions or themed events that create excitement around your services. Collaborating with local businesses for cross-promotions can also expand your reach and attract new clientele. Host special days where clients can enjoy discounted services or bundle packages, which can lead to increased bookings and introduce new clients to the quality of your work. By combining creativity with strategic marketing, you'll cultivate a vibrant atmosphere that not only attracts new clients but also retains them for the long term.

 

# Create a welcoming atmosphere for clients.

 

A warm and inviting environment can significantly enhance the client experience, encouraging them to return and recommend your salon to others. Focus on the sensory aspects of your space—ensure that the lighting is soft and flattering, the seating is comfortable, and the overall décor reflects a style that resonates with your target clientele. Playing soothing music can create a relaxing ambiance, while the pleasant scent of essential oils or freshly brewed coffee can evoke a sense of comfort and homeliness.

 

Additionally, prioritize exceptional customer service by greeting each client with a friendly smile and a welcoming attitude. Take the time to engage in meaningful conversation, making them feel valued and understood. Personalized touches, such as remembering clients' names and preferences, can go a long way in establishing rapport. Offering complimentary beverages or small treats can also contribute to a positive experience, transforming a simple appointment into a delightful escape. By fostering a welcoming atmosphere, you not only enhance client satisfaction but also cultivate a loyal clientele that feels connected to your brand.

 

In conclusion, starting your own hair salon can be an exciting and rewarding venture, but it requires careful planning and attention to detail. By securing the necessary licenses, choosing the right location, investing in quality equipment, and effectively marketing your services to attract clients, you can set a solid foundation for your business. Remember to stay adaptable and open to feedback as you grow, and don’t hesitate to seek out resources or mentorship within the industry. With dedication and passion, you’re well on your way to creating a thriving salon that not only showcases your skills but also builds a loyal clientele. Embrace the journey, and best of luck in turning your vision into reality!

1pjetpu,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1pjetpu/my_experience_with_gerd_and_looking_for/,My Experience with GERD and Looking for Alternative Help,"Hi everyone,
I’m 24 years old, and I’ve been dealing with what seems to be a family-related issue: my lower esophageal sphincter (LES) is weak and enlarged. Interestingly, I’ve never really had heartburn or strong acid reflux, but I’ve always struggled with bad breath, which doctors believe is probably related to silent reflux.

For the last few months, I went through a very stressful job situation with lots of anxiety for about 4 months. I finally changed jobs and things are much calmer now. The strange thing is that about one month after leaving the stressful job, when I expected to feel better, strong reflux symptoms suddenly started.

I began treatment with medication and changed some habits:
	•	I don’t eat anything 3 hours before bed
	•	I sleep with my upper body elevated
	•	I don’t drink coffee or alcohol (never have)

After 1 month of treatment, almost all symptoms are gone, except for mild regurgitation. It feels like the medication controls the acid, but once I stop taking it (I still have one more month to go), the structural issue with my LES will still be there and symptoms might return.

So I’m looking for stories from people who’ve seen improvement through alternative or complementary approaches, especially those who have a weak LES and not just temporary acid irritation. Today I started drinking homemade kefir to try improving my gut microbiome and see if that helps in any way.

If anyone has experiences with diet changes, stress-reduction practices, breathing exercises, probiotics, or anything that helped strengthen symptoms long-term, I’d love to hear your thoughts.",1,1765401409.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

So basically for a little backstory, I’ve known this guy (19m Jason) for like a year now. I asked him out a few weeks ago and he rejected me but we moved on and still hung out often and I lost feelings, gained them for someone else anyway.

For the math we’re taking, we have a final this week on Friday but I asked to take it on Wednesday (today, I’ve already taken it today) because I have a medical surgery on Friday. My professor was super nice and let me take it on Wednesday, clarifying to me that I’m not to share any info with anyone about the final (which I wouldn’t have done anyway). Jason found out about this because we were grabbing coffee on Monday and we were talking about the final, and I stupidly mentioned that I’m taking it earlier. He then started asking me to tell him what the questions are and if I have any answers (I’m better at math than he is but the class is super easy and he’s never been bad).

I told him I won’t share anything about the final because this is college and I’m not risking getting kicked out because he doesn’t wanna study. He started cursing at me, telling me I’m not a real friend and don’t care about him, and basically insulting me because I told him I wasn’t taking any chances, it was actually really unsettling to see how a switch flipped in him and how angry he got; I’d never seen this side of him. I assured him that it wasn’t personal and if it were high school, I would help him out, but this is not a risk I’m willing to take especially for a class that both of us are okay at. Our professor has offered after hour study classes to help as well, which he hasn’t gone to. He didn’t even respond properly, he just continued trying to guilt me.

I got up and left and he went radio silent on me. I haven’t reached out because I feel that he owes me an apology. I’m not necessarily mad that he asked me, I’m mad that he blew up on me and disrespected me. AITAH?

Edit/boring update: just wanted to say thank you to everyone for reassuring me and being supportive. After getting like 5 comments I blocked him, opened up my phone to over 50 comments!! I can’t reply to everyone but just know I’m reading as much as I can and appreciate everyone giving me advice and being respectful. I’ll let you know if there’s any further interaction with him at school or anything like that.",314,1765401144.0,AITAH,138,0.97,False

Starting your own hair salon can be an exciting and rewarding venture, especially if you have a passion for hairstyling and beauty. However, many aspiring salon owners feel daunted by the financial implications of launching their dream business. Fortunately, with careful planning and strategic decision-making, it is entirely possible to open a hair salon with $10,000 or less. In this article, we will guide you through essential steps to help you realize your vision without breaking the bank. 

You will learn how to identify the right location, source affordable equipment, and establish a unique brand that sets you apart from competitors. Additionally, we will explore innovative marketing strategies to attract clients and discuss how to manage your finances effectively to ensure sustainability. Whether you are a seasoned stylist or a newcomer to the industry, this practical guide will equip you with the insights and resources you need to embark on your entrepreneurial journey. By the end of this article, you will have a clear roadmap to open your hair salon on a budget, empowering you to transform your passion into a thriving business.

 

# Research Local Competition and Demand

 

Understanding the local competition and demand in your area is crucial when planning to open your hair salon. Start by visiting other salons to observe their services, pricing, and customer flow. Take note of their strengths and weaknesses; this insight will help you identify gaps in the market that you can exploit. Additionally, consider the demographics of your target market—age, lifestyle, and income levels can greatly influence the types of services that will be in demand. Engaging with potential customers through surveys or social media can also provide valuable feedback on what they look for in a salon.

 

Analyzing this information allows you to tailor your offerings to meet local needs effectively. For instance, if you notice a lack of budget-friendly options in your area, you might focus on providing affordable services to attract those customers. Conversely, if you find that high-end salons dominate the landscape, offering unique services or a welcoming atmosphere could set your business apart. Ultimately, being aware of your competition and the demand will empower you to create a business model that resonates with your community and enhances your chances of success.

 

# Understand the market to identify your unique selling proposition.

 

This understanding of the market is essential for pinpointing your unique selling proposition (USP). Your USP is what sets your salon apart from others, and it’s crucial for attracting and retaining clients. By analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of your competitors, you can identify what unique services or experiences you can offer that resonate with your target audience. For example, if you discover that other salons lack personalized service, emphasizing a client-centered approach with tailored consultations could become your signature feature.

 

Additionally, consider tapping into niche markets that are currently underserved. If your area has an influx of young professionals, incorporating trendy styles or express services might appeal to their busy lifestyles. Alternatively, if you're in a community with many families, offering kid-friendly services could distinguish your salon. The key is to ensure that your USP not only reflects your passions and skills but also aligns with the needs and preferences of your potential clients.

 

# Create a Detailed Business Plan

 

is also grounded in a comprehensive business plan. A well-structured business plan acts as a roadmap for your salon, guiding you through the essential steps to turn your vision into reality. Begin by outlining your business goals, target market, and marketing strategies. Consider detailing your financial projections, including startup costs, operating expenses, and potential revenue streams. This will not only help you stay organized but will also be an invaluable tool if you seek funding or partnerships.

 

As you craft your business plan, be sure to include an analysis of the local market and competitors, as well as a description of the services you intend to offer. Incorporating a clear operational plan that defines day-to-day procedures, staffing needs, and customer experience will further solidify your blueprint. By investing time in this planning phase, you position yourself for success and give your salon the best chance to thrive in a competitive landscape.

 

# Outline your vision, goals, and budget to stay organized and focused.

 

Establishing a clear vision for your salon is vital, as it serves as your guiding star throughout the journey. Visualize the atmosphere you want to create, the clientele you aim to attract, and the unique services that will set you apart in the market. Set specific, measurable goals that align with this vision, such as achieving a certain number of clients within your first year or generating a specific monthly revenue. Having these objectives in place will keep you motivated and ensure that you are making progress toward your ideal salon.

 

Equally important is developing a detailed budget that outlines your anticipated expenses and income. Break down your startup costs, including equipment, supplies, and marketing efforts, while also factoring in ongoing expenses like rent and utilities. Allocate funds wisely, prioritizing essential items that directly contribute to delivering a great experience for your clients. By maintaining an organized budget, you can monitor your financial health and make informed decisions, keeping you focused on achieving your goals without losing sight of your overall vision.

 

# Choose a Cost-Effective Location

 

Selecting the right location for your salon can significantly impact your overall success while keeping within your budget. Look for areas with good foot traffic, such as neighborhoods or shopping districts that align with your target clientele. It’s also wise to consider spaces that may be slightly off the beaten path but still have visibility and accessibility. By choosing a location with lower rent costs, you can allocate more of your budget to essential equipment and marketing, helping to establish your brand without overspending.

 

When evaluating potential locations, take the time to assess the competition and demographic trends in the area. Researching the local market will help you understand where your services are in demand and identify gaps you can fill. Additionally, consider collaborating with nearby businesses or services that complement your offerings, as this can encourage cross-promotion and attract more customers to your salon. By making a thoughtful choice in location, you set a strong foundation for your salon's growth and sustainability.

 

# Look for affordable spaces with high visibility and foot traffic to attract clients.

 

Identifying an affordable space that boasts high visibility and foot traffic is crucial to drawing in clients and establishing a loyal customer base. Locations near popular attractions, busy streets, or community centers can offer the exposure needed to capture the attention of passersby. Even if rent is a bit higher, the increased customer access may justify the cost. Evaluate the layout of the space as well; an inviting storefront with large windows can showcase your work and create an inviting atmosphere that encourages people to stop in.

 

Additionally, consider the potential for signage and branding opportunities in your chosen location. A well-placed sign that communicates your services effectively can enhance your visibility, while an aesthetically pleasing exterior can create a welcoming vibe. Think about the experiences you want to offer your clients from the moment they arrive. The goal is not just to attract clients but to ensure they feel drawn to return. A strategically chosen location can provide you with both immediate foot traffic and the foundation for a strong, recognizable presence in the community.

 

# Invest in Essential Equipment Only

 

Focusing on essential equipment is key to maintaining a budget while ensuring you provide quality service. Prioritize tools that are indispensable for your salon, such as high-quality scissors, clippers, blow dryers, and styling products. Investing in these core items not only ensures that you can perform a range of services effectively but also establishes a professional standard that clients will appreciate. Remember, you don’t need every tool available on the market; instead, select versatile equipment that can handle various styles and techniques, allowing you to cater to a wider clientele without overspending.

 

As your business grows, you can gradually expand your inventory to include more specialized tools or luxurious products. This approach allows you to manage your cash flow effectively, building your reputation first and giving you a clearer understanding of your clients' needs before introducing additional services or equipment. By starting with the essentials, you create a solid foundation for your business, enabling you to focus on delivering excellent service and building strong relationships with your customers.

 

# Prioritize quality tools that will enhance your services without overspending right away.

 

Investing in quality tools is essential for setting the foundation of your hair salon. When you select equipment that enhances your services, you’re not only ensuring a seamless experience for your clients but also reinforcing your brand’s commitment to professionalism. Focus on tools that offer durability and efficiency, as this will lead to long-term savings and reduce the need for frequent replacements. Look for customer reviews and recommendations to guide your purchases, which can help you identify reliable products that align with your budget.

 

By being strategic in your choices, you can avoid the temptation to acquire every latest gadget on the market. Instead, concentrate on acquiring items that provide the most value, such as multifunctional devices or products that can serve multiple purposes. This approach not only maximizes your initial investment but also sets you up for sustainable growth. As your client base expands and revenue increases, you can gradually introduce more specialized tools that cater to specific services, ensuring that your offerings evolve in response to your clients’ preferences.

 

# Market Your Salon Creatively Online

 

To effectively market your salon online, harness the power of social media platforms where potential clients are actively engaging. Create visually appealing content that showcases your work, such as before-and-after photos of hairstyles, tutorials, or client testimonials. Engaging with your audience through stories, polls, or live Q&A sessions can foster a sense of community and keep your salon at the forefront of their minds. Consistency is key; by maintaining an active presence, you build brand awareness and trust, which can convert casual viewers into loyal customers.

 

Additionally, consider collaborations with local influencers or businesses to broaden your reach. Partnering with fashion boutiques or makeup artists can create mutually beneficial promotions, increasing visibility for both parties. Offering exclusive online deals or referral incentives can also encourage existing clients to share their positive experiences with friends and family. By being innovative and interactive in your online marketing efforts, you can effectively attract new clients while nurturing relationships with your current clientele.

 

# Utilize social media and local advertising to build awareness and attract customers effectively.

 

Leveraging local advertising can significantly enhance your salon's visibility within the community. Invest in eye-catching flyers or posters to place in high-traffic areas, such as coffee shops, gyms, or community centers. Sponsorship of local events or participating in community fairs can create face-to-face interactions that help establish a personal connection with potential clients. Furthermore, consider offering special promotions or discounts to first-time visitors, which can entice passersby to book an appointment and experience your services firsthand.

 

Don't underestimate the power of word-of-mouth marketing; encourage satisfied customers to spread the word about your salon. Implement a referral program that rewards clients for bringing in new patrons. By combining both social media strategies and localized advertising efforts, you can create a comprehensive marketing approach that builds awareness and attracts a steady stream of customers, ensuring your salon stands out in a competitive market.

 

In conclusion, opening a hair salon with $10,000 or less is entirely possible with careful planning and strategic decision-making. By focusing on essential expenses like licensing, equipment, and a small but inviting space, you can create a thriving business without overspending. Remember to leverage your skills, network within your community, and consider creative marketing strategies to attract clients. With determination and a clear vision, you can turn your passion for hair into a successful salon venture. So take the leap, trust your instincts, and watch your dream come to life!

1pjencu,https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/1pjencu/homeward_bound_18/,Homeward Bound - [18],"More Krev, we get a follow up on what happened to the Jaslip Edward helped rescue and kitchen staff loose a perfectly good plate. Thank you to u/SpacePaladin15 for creating the NoP story.

**Memory Transcription Subject: Edward Hamilton, Human Colonist**

Date \[*standardized human time\]:* January 6, 2161

 

My thoughts drifted back to what happened a few hours ago, most of the time when I would get into scraps in the old settlement no guards were involved and a brief question afterward was enough to assuage any guilt.

But now, it was a different story.

With cameras on board the ship and with the Jaslip being carried by me, and the two Resket that probably ran off telling someone that a human and Jaslip attacked them. It left me on edge waiting.

The waiting for one of them, security or a staffer to barge in and accuse me of what happened last night. It just wouldn’t let me stop thinking about it, but it distracted from my usual thoughts.

‘Guess there’s a silver lining somewhere.’

‘Come one man, you found a Jaslip being attacked because of racial profiling. You were in the right for protecting him and those two pricks attacking him are the ones at fault.’

The thoughts helped a little before I started thinking about it again, Flin has a hidden compartment on the ship, medical supplies and has been here long enough to jury rig some sort of plumbing for running water.

It was suspicious at best and downright insidious at worst. He was hiding in there for a reason, he said that it was because it was safe, but why would it be safer there than maybe in his own bunk room?

‘Maybe he had a falling out with someone higher up than him?’

I tried reasoning with the idea, but it still didn’t make any sense at all, and what he said about the crest and Onmol being the breeding ground for the Jaslip rebels. I agreed with their plight, being bombed like they were and forced out of their home system, the Consortium should have helped set them up in their own world or maybe got them to do what we did.

‘Yeah, no, bad idea. You know what it’s like not having a true home.’

It was stupid thinking like that, I didn’t like the idea of up and leaving Earth, why should they be fine with it. The UN had survived the onslaught from the Federation, the Consortium should have fought against them as well.

‘Maybe I wouldn’t have had to leave Earth then if they did.’

I was nudged in the ribs, my thoughts being interrupted by Breeve sitting next to me in the booth eating at her breakfast as well as Cruth.

“Are you alright Edward?” Cruth asked, seemingly having asked multiple times from the look he gave me.

“Hmm, uh yeah, I’m fine what did you asked again?”

“The movie for tonight?”

“Oh um, yeah, just, just whatever is fine.”

Breeve threw up her arms at the reply.

“That’s a non-answer, why are all of you like this, each human in the group bar one is just going with whatever? Like, how did you guys ever make it this far when you can’t even decide to choose a movie?”

“I don’t know, like all the human movies we had from the vault I’ve seen before and I know next to nothing about your guys’ movies, except those that you showed me at your parent’s house.” I replied back finally eating some of the food on the plate, just some simple toast and coffee.

It didn’t escape my notice Cruth’s look between us.

“Why are you looking at us like that? You remember that time when we were at yours.” I pointed a half-finished bit of bread at him.

“At any rate, it’ll probably be a human film tonight, I think there was one being voted for a lot, something about a human that can run really far named… Forest?” She questioned at the end.

“Yeah, it’s a legacy movie, I think the both of you’ll like it.”

“But why Forest?” Cruth asked testing the name.

“Why not, people have been named weirder things before.” I spoke, the two of them staring at me to continue. “I personally know a guy with the name Benidren.”

“Benidrin?”

“Yeah, we just called him ben for short, that and the teasing about his name being close to something we have for cold medicine.”

Breeve blanched at the name while Cruth snickered, I didn’t think the name was bad, just unfortunate that the parents got the name from a bottle histamine blockers.

“So, Forest isn’t a bad name at all for someone.” I finished munching on the last bit of toast. Breeve was watching her pad again and Cruth was looking around occasionally eating the greens on his plate.

 My mind wandered again as I checked the time, it was maybe four hours since I left Flin alone and the nagging thought that something was about to happen plagued me.

I needed to get back to him to get some real answers of why he had a hidden alcove stashed away, but he’d need food by the state he was left in was anything to go by. I was about to get up and leave without thinking much, but the two other Krev with me made me stop. I needed to let them know where I was going, I couldn’t just leave them in the dark about this sort of thing.

‘Maybe we can all look out for him, if this is a case of extreme workplace bullying, but it would be more along the lines of assault.

“I’ll be right back, I need to grab something and after, I need to talk to the both of you.” They both looked at me seriously, both searching for why my demeanour changed suddenly.

I took my plate back up to the counter before ordering some meets and whatever was on the Jaslip side of the menu, having it placed on a plate before I took it back to the others.

“Your still hungry?” Cruth asked.

“It’s not for me, come on. I need to speak to the both of you in private.”

Walking out with a plate wasn’t the smartest thing to do, but I didn’t care. I didn’t walk back to the rooms, and I think the two of them got a little worried when I started down one of the halls I ran through last night.

“Edward where are we going?” Breeve asked concern in her voice.

“And why do you have a plate full of meat?”

“It’s about last night. I don’t want to talk about it here, let’s get going to where it’s a little quieter.” I didn’t know if the area Flin had his hideout was quiet right now, but it was better than openly discussing that someone almost bled out last night in front of other passengers.

We walked for a while, me trying my best to try and make my way back to the ventilation duct. Soon enough I was starting to see familiar sights, one being the large atrium from last night. It now bustling with humans some lounging and getting breakfast, but a few were giving us some stares as we passed through.

“Why was there only human’s back there?” Cruth asked as we rounded a corner making a bit of distance from the atrium.

“We’re in a different sector of the ship, I think this is one reserved for humans travelling back by themselves.” Breeve explained.

“Are we allowed to be here?”

“Should be, there’s no rules against it and Edward where are we actually going?” She asked turning to me

I was focused on directions, the hallway that I had taken the fire extinguisher from was closed off, a cleaning sign for wet floors being placed there. The crew must have found the blood from last night, I was thankful we hadn’t left a trail they could follow.

“It’s about last night.” I said walking on, noticing Breeve’s gaze linger on the sign pondering something before ripping her gaze away it and followed.

Flin was right, the place was quiet enough, maybe only passing by two or three crew members who looked confused by me carrying a plate of meat being followed by two Krev.

I must have stood out a bit to them, but I think they must have taken me for just a weird passenger being followed by exchange partners. I hoped they would forget it either way.

“Here.” I said ducking down another hallway, this time when I neared the vent I noticed a few droplets of purple blood dried on the floor. I used my boot to rub it away when Breeve approached a strange look on her face.

“Edward what happened last night? You’re acting strange with all this secrecy type stuff.” She grabbed my shoulder and held me there staring at me.

“Here hold this, I’ll explain.” I handed her the plate, making her release my shoulder as I pulled away the grate. I heard a gasp from behind me and saw that both Cruth and Breeve were staring at the vent, it wasn’t that shocking until I turned around to it.

It was covered in bloody fingerprints, no doubt my own. I was crouched down when I felt two claws grip the fabric of my hoodie, the claws digging slightly into the skin underneath the fabric before I was spun around and held in place more firmly this time..

“You are going to explain right now what’s happening, or so help me I will drag you back to our sector and keep you in your room and you won’t be able to leave.” I stared knowing that she would probably do it too, she’d probably stay with me the entire time under some sort of house arrest.

“Alright, alright. There was a fight last night, there were three crew members ‘fighting’.” I used air quotes at fight. “Two Resket were kicking the sh\*t out of a Jaslip in that hallway back there you saw.”

Breeve’s grip loosened staring at me long enough to be a bit awkward before relinquishing me.

“I told you to stay out of fights, why did you get involved, or did you?” She hastily asked, I couldn’t tell if she was worried or furious from the way she was looking at me. I risked a glance at Cruth who was looking up and down the corridor for people, a worried look on his face anyway.

“I had to get involved, they would have killed him if I didn’t intervene.”

“How do you know that?” She asked pulling at my hoodie harder this time.

“Because he almost bled out last night. I couldn’t leave someone like that.” I said back with a bit of aggravation in my tone, I was just, I don’t know, enclosed. Breeve backed away at that comment. “He was being beaten to death, I had to get involved or there’d be a dead crewmember.”

“Where are they now?” Cruth asked meekly seeing I was a bit annoyed. I just pointed to the ventilation and Breeve made a noise of what I could only describe as bafflement or shock at the situation, before looking at me worried.

“Don’t tell me you didn’t take them to a medical centre? Please tell me that you brought them to a medical centre?” She almost pleaded.

“I tried-“ Before I could even finish my sentence she threw her hands in the air before rubbing at her eyes in manner that seemed like she wanted to enact what she said earlier.

“They are not in there, are they?”

I step toward Breeve and looked her in the eyes and spoke my reasons.

“I tried to, they said that medical wouldn’t have treated them since they were a Jaslip, that if I did, they would rather be left there to bleed out.” I explained slowly for the Krev to understand.

She stared a while before looking toward the vent before taking a slow breath.

“Are they still alive?”

“Yes.” I didn’t know if they fell asleep and never woke up but I wasn’t going to get Breeve more worked up over it, that and I hoped to whatever was watching us out here that Flin was still breathing in there because it would be my conscious it would torment if he was dead.

She took a step closer and pointed a clawed finger at my face before speaking.

“You owe me for this one, I’m not going to tell anyone what happened and that this Jaslip is in there.” I could feel the tension in the air abate slightly before she jabbed the claw closer. “*But*, you *owe* me for this, big time.” She spoke with a finality that said it was for life before raising a paw to the top of my head, petting me before retracting it.

“I understand.” I said realising what I just signed away. I turned around and tried to remember the code, the purple prints on the key pad helping a bit as I punched in the code.

“I don’t like this.” Cruth spoke to my left moving his weight from one foot to the other glancing up and down the hallway. “Are you sure we should be doing this? What if they’re a stowaway?”

‘He has a point.’

‘But he was almost killed as well, and if they were a stowaway they could just be a run away looking for a better life.’

From the treatment I saw last night, I’d be looking for any chance to get out and thinking about it, I sort of have done this before.

“Stealing John’s sofa.” I whispered under my breath remembering the things I did to get out of working in the mines before.

“What was that?” Breeve stooped down next to me as Cruth tried to push himself further into the little alcove. I pressed the buttons correctly guessing the last two and the vent opened with a swish of air being pulled in.

Before I could even speak, Breeve’s holo pad started ringing, Cruth almost fell into the hallway at the noise and I was worried that Flin now knows I have company along. Breeve unclipped it fumbling with her claws before answering it and holding it close to her ear.

“Yeah… Uh huh… I’ll be there now?” She spoke before hanging up. “It’s the administration, there’s an emergency meeting being held.”

“Think it’s because of this?” I asked gesturing to the vent.

“I don’t know, they said just be there.” She spoke clipping the pad back to her belt before stepping into the corridor looking up and down before turning. “You be careful, and Cruth keep him out of trouble, I don’t want any of this to explode into something that could jeopardise getting to Earth.” She said giving me a glare before walking off leaving me and Cruth.

“Are you still sure about this?” He said shuffling into the alcove more now that Breeve was gone.

“Yes, look I’m just going to drop off some food for him and see how he’s doing, the vent looks big enough for you to fit as well.” I said grabbing the plate of food and entering the vent being met with a strong metallic smell, before turning around and asked. “Are you coming or staying here?”

He looked apprehensively around at the alcove before taking a step back and then two forward. I made room for him as he shuffled into the vent crawling on all fours behind me. We moved slowly forward the duct shutting behind us but doing nothing to stop the scraping noise Cruth’s scales against the metal.

‘If it keeps going, we’ll have the entire ship wondering who was using their nails on a chalk board.’

I could see light in front of me before stopping, a shadowy figure passing by the entrance to the larger portion. I heard a growl as the silhouette was half looking, half hiding on one side of the vent.

“Flin, it’s me Edward, I brought you some food.” I said crawling forward seeing the Jaslip move again, though now I was closer it was strained. As I moved forward, I noticed some rustling before I was able to crawl out of the vent cracking my back as I did so.

Flin was sitting back down on the bed I had left him on though this time he was definitely more animated.

“Good, it’s just you.” He said before eyeing the plate I brought with me. I looked him over placing the platter in front of him, seeing that the blood had clumped his fur together and the gel like substance I used hadn’t cracked so it must be a good adhesive

 “It wasn’t the plate making all that scraping, was it?” He asked carefully nudging a piece of, I think it was bacon around the plate before taking a tentative bite.

“No, I brought a friend you can trust.” I probably should have said that but the Jaslip shot up with a yelp before falling over, thankfully onto the bedding.

“It’s alright, it’s just Cruth, he’s good I trust him and so can you.” I tried to appease the Jaslip as the scraping noise got closer before the green scaled alien flopped out of the vent onto his front with a chuff.

Flin growled at him and I made sure to place myself between them incase he found the strength to attack him.

“How could you bring one of them here, do you know what you’ve do-“ he was cut of whimpering falling down again, the laceration from last night not healing yet.

“Everything’s ruined now, they’re going to find me, they’ll…” He cut himself off me looking at him curiously and I think Cruth as well before standing up.

“Is this the Jaslip?”

I wanted to respond with a little dry humour at how many other Jaslips are sleeping in the ventilation system, but it seemed unwise at the moment.

“Flin this is Cruth, Cruth this is Flin. The Jaslip I was talking about from last night.”

“Who else have you told?” He asked me directing his hate filled glare at me.

I wanted to say no one else, but he would find out later and it may lead to more problems.

“One other, but that’s it.” He growled again and seemed like he was trying to move toward one of the cabinets. “I know both of them since before this and they both promised me that they wouldn’t tell anyone about what happened last night.” He was trying to move toward one of the vents, straining himself and I could see the gel flexing, a little bit flaking away.

“It doesn’t matter anymore, they know I’m here, they know where I am, you ruined everything.” He growled at me, I glanced back at Cruth who was inspecting the room before seeing the amount of pain on the Jaslip’s face.

“Look, I know you can trust them, they won’t speak a word of this to anyone.” I grabbed his front paws wanting him to stop hurting himself. He tried nipping at my hands, I had let go not wanting to get bitten.

He wasn’t being reasonable right now, he just needed to calm down a little but with how worked up he was, it risked reopening the wound.

“Where are your parents?” Cruth asked stopping both of us. I Looked at Cruth, my head snapping toward the green scaled alien, and I think Flin did as well. Cruth’s stare wandered from the Jaslip faltering before looking down at the floor.

“Oh sorry, just, I haven’t interacted with that many of you, just… sorry.” He hung his head under the Jaslip’s glare.

“I don’t need them, I’m nineteen.”

 I didn’t expect that at all, that’s far too young to get kicked to death, and maybe too young to be part of a spaceship crew?

“Hang on a minute, your just nineteen? How are you even allowed to be on a spaceship are you a prodigy or something?” I regretted asking, as he looked at me like I was the dumbest person in the room, I didn’t know if there was an age requirement or some sort of certification you need to work on a spaceship. It just seemed a little young to be able to work on one of these.

He at least calmed down a bit and wasn’t trying to get away into another vent or something, he stayed quiet trying to stand on his own and failing. He dragged himself back to the bedding and flopped back down whimpering.

“Are you okay?” Cruth asked receiving only a whimper in return Flin turning his head away.

“I ran away, okay. I just, I don’t want to go back there, everyone is going insane, I don’t want to.” He whined to us or maybe himself, I couldn’t tell.

I just sat down across from the Jaslip thinking about what happened last night, the two Reskets kicking him intending on making sure he doesn’t wake up. I remember being in fights even before at his age and all of them were to show me a lesson or to make the other guy back down, never to kill.

It only made me angry, making me regret not hitting that Resket harder.

Cruth came over thudding down next to me and the orange box I saw yesterday clamoured to the floor, I picked it up and saw strange markings on it before placing it back where it fell from. Cruth watched me as I did so, keeping an eye on it before staring back at Flin who was still facing away from us whimpering.

So, he was a runaway then, Cruth was right in his assumption and his reason seemed solid enough especially with the tensions in the Consortium right now. We sat for a while, Flin’s whimpers dying out before Cruth decided to fill in the silence.

“That’s the Onmol enclave crest?” Flin didn’t respond for a few seconds.

“Yes.” He said dryly not turning around. Was this the best subject to bring up to someone running away from the enclave?

“Is it always daytime or night time there, I’ve heard that sometimes it can be either or for a few days at a time?”

“Both, there’s a few places like Qurey and Telern that it sets for months and sometimes stays in the sky for weeks never setting.”

The question must have done something since it seemed like the Jaslip was at least talking now and not trying to run away again.

“I don’t remember but is it the north or south it happens?”

“North… mostly.”

“I see, I’ve had a little experience with it before on Avor, I went on holiday when I was a child and we ended up somewhere where the sun never set for the time we spent there.” Cruth spoke while he got a faraway look in his eyes remembering his parents.

I can see what he was doing with the conversation either trying to defuse tension or getting a little familiar with the quadruped. Next thing I spoke I hoped it would at least help a little.

“Well at least you guys had a sky above your heads all your lives. All I got where streetlamps that never turned off unless the power stations went down and rock ceilings when that happens.”

The Jaslip looked at me like I had grown a second head and Cruth glanced at me.

“Is that why you look up at the sky sometimes?”

“Yeah, it’s a bit open to me really.”

“Not living without the sun or moon…” He pondered it before I heard a grumble coming from his direction, he glanced at the plate and back at us.

“It’ll get colder if you leave it longer, go ahead.” I said to him.

Without much more pushing he started eating the stuff on the plate, I looked at Cruth, he was just staring ahead before glancing back up at the box. I wonder what he was thinking about?

1pjenbm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/1pjenbm/evaporative_cooling_and_water_temperature/,Evaporative cooling and water temperature,"Hi everyone

Im trying to desing an indirect evaporative cooler, using the cooled water as refrigerant to a radiator, seemingly not the most popular design out there (maybe for a reason?). I have some questions about the air vs water temperature after evaporation.

In most of literature, the process is described as isenthalpic, getting all cooling power from absorbing heat from the surrrounding air to dump it into the water. I have the suspicion that this only applies when the evaporative process is done by the likes of spraying water mist with full evaporation efficiency, where there is no liquid water after the process. Psychrometric charts, if I'm reading them correctly, seem to assume so. However, we blow air on hot coffee or tea to lower the liquid's temperature, not the surrounding air. Also, we humans cool down by evaporation as well, and we don't do it to cool down the air, but rather our bodies.

Is there any way of knowing how much of the heat is provided by the incoming dry air and how much from the body of water being evaporated? Are there any equations I might be missing or is it a ""it greatly depends on the configuration of the system"" case?

I’m now trying to decide how long my coffee table should be. My issue is that if I keep a 16” distance between the portion of the chaise that I’d put my legs up on, then the other end of my coffee table would be creeping up to the edge of the non chaise section. Is this ok? Or do I need to keep symmetry so there’s the same amount of non chaise portion extending out from both sides of the coffee table? If I were to do this then my coffee table would have to be quite small because 16” on both sides would be 32” subtracted from 61” which would leave only 29” of length for the table.",1,1765400580.0,HomeDecorating,0,1.0,False

I’m a 24M  in Bangalore, and in my friend group there are two girls who are slightly older than me — like 1–2 years. Nothing dramatic, just normal “everyone met through friends-of-friends” kind of circle.

I’ve never dated before, and honestly I started taking this part of life seriously pretty late. Most of my days are the usual BLR combo of office → traffic → collapse, so meeting people organically is already rare. These two are among the few people I actually vibe with — calm conversations, similar humour, same “not into loud scenes” energy.

Now here’s the confusion:
Is it weird to ask out someone older? Are there any unspoken rules here? I don’t want to make things awkward in the friend circle, and I definitely don’t want to come across as childish just because I’m slightly younger.

If you were in my place, how would you bring it up?
Something casual like coffee? Or do I just keep it simple and straightforward?

1pjechr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amazontly/comments/1pjechr/how_does_an_over_the_sink_cutting_board_compare/,How does an over the sink cutting board compare to a countertop one?,"You've probably noticed your kitchen counter getting cramped when you're chopping vegetables or prepping dinner. That cutting board takes up valuable space, and you're constantly shuffling things around just to make room. This is where an over the sink cutting board might change your cooking routine.

**What Makes Them Different?**

A regular countertop cutting board sits flat on your workspace. It's the traditional option most people use. An over the sink cutting board sits directly over your sink basin, using that empty space above the water. The design usually includes extended edges or rails that rest on both sides of your sink.

**Space Savings**

The biggest advantage is obvious – you get your counter space back. When you're working in a small kitchen or apartment, every inch matters. You can keep your appliances, ingredients, and other prep materials on the counter while the cutting surface sits above the sink. No more moving the coffee maker three times just to chop an onion.

**Easy Cleanup**

Here's something practical: food scraps fall straight into the sink. You can sweep vegetable peels, stems, and trimmings right through the opening. No need to scoop everything into your hand and walk it to the trash. Some models even have built-in colanders, so you can rinse produce right where you're cutting it.

**Stability Concerns**

Countertop boards win when it comes to stability. They sit flush against a solid surface with no movement. Over sink models need to fit your specific sink dimensions properly, or they might wobble. You'll want to measure your sink carefully before buying one. A board that doesn't fit right can slide around, which gets annoying fast.

**Material and Durability**

Both styles come in wood, bamboo, or plastic. Countertop boards tend to be thicker and heavier since they don't need to worry about weight restrictions. Over sink cutting boards need to stay lightweight enough that the sink edges can support them without stress. This doesn't mean they're flimsy, but they're generally not as thick as premium countertop boards.

**Which One Should You Get?**

If you've got plenty of counter space and a large kitchen, a traditional cutting board works perfectly fine. But if you're dealing with limited room or want a more efficient prep setup, an over the sink option makes sense. Many people actually keep both – using the countertop board for heavy-duty tasks like cutting meat, and the sink board for quick vegetable prep and rinsing.

**Making Your Choice**

Think about your daily cooking habits. Do you prep a lot of vegetables and fruits? An over the sink cutting board speeds up that process. Do you need something super stable for cutting through tough ingredients? Stick with a countertop model.

The good news is you don't have to guess what works. You can check out different [over the sink cutting board](https://athomewave.com/over-the-sink-cutting-board) options to see what fits your sink dimensions and cooking style. Look for ones with non-slip grips and make sure to read the size specifications carefully.

Your kitchen setup should make cooking easier, not harder. Whether you choose an over sink design or stick with traditional countertop boards, the right cutting surface helps you prep food faster and clean up quicker. If you're ready to free up some counter space, browse through some [over the sink cutting board](https://athomewave.com/over-the-sink-cutting-board) models and see if one matches your sink measurements.

1pjebyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_One-Brilliant9136/comments/1pjebyl/coffee_chat_journal_1_asset_management_vp/,[Coffee Chat Journal 1] Asset Management VP,"It’s a popular yet time-consuming activity that college students and professionals in many fields engage in, which is coffee chats. Ranging from in-person to virtual, or simply over email, professionals and students share experiences and advice in homes that foster emotional or professional connections and insights. We never know what can come out of a coffee chat. It can be a fruitful or a fruitless endeavor, and that is what makes every experience different. Meeting different personalities, hearing different advice, and taking away different lessons about yourself or the profession a person might lead. Due to its unpredictability and time-consuming nature, we sometimes lack the capacity and energy to give our all or fully utilize the wealth of knowledge that surrounds us. But recently, I have been on a non-stop role to coffee chat to grow my network and understanding of potential careers that might fit me. First up, I met with a Vice President of a small-er and lesser-known asset management firm in southern CA. For confidentiality reasons, she will be referred to as DY. After agreeing to meet at a cute, local coffee shop, I prepared my general questions, based on what I hoped to learn from her, and used them as conversation starters. Upon arriving and meeting DY, she felt like an aunt. Very personable, friendly, and incredibly comforting. Throughout the session, I became more connected, as her persona was similar to mine. DY is driven, focused, and strategic with her career. She disrupted some of my planned life and career choices, and that wisdom of hers opened up my mindset to different possibilities. As someone like me who is young, I could get set in planning out everything for the rest of my life, but that’s not realistic nor always controllable. Conversations like these with DY gave me a glimpse into the unplanned surprises that come in life, which may disrupt a career one might be set on pursuing. The professional career talk evolved into life advice, showcasing her growing concern for my development as an emerging professional. While I entered this coffee chat feeling prepared and unsure of what the chemistry would be like, I ultimately left feeling enlightened, informed, reassured, and thankful for the time I spent with DY. Not only did it reveal the type of person she was, but after getting to know me, she also had suggestions for where she thought I would be a good fit. That was one of the more successful coffee chats I have experienced, and I certainly left with resources I didn't expect to know about when I arrived. It is a basic understanding of human interactions that not everyone gets along, regardless of their attempts to connect. With DY, there was a pretty immediate connection, and because of that, I opened up more quickly, and my prepared questions were barely referred to. The conversation and questions were being generated organically, and it was a conversation between two mutually interested people. I learned a lot from DY that morning over some coffee and realized that something like coffee chats is a practice that can produce tangible results or not, but at the very least, one can learn various skills about themselves to transfer to other experiences or simply the next coffee chat to come. While unpredictable, leveraging the alumni network of my school can often take you places or introduce you to people you would never have expected to meet otherwise. I see this experience like a blind box, because opening it can provoke both feelings of excitement and anxiety about what's inside and its impact on you.

I 26M am very sensitive and over love/overdo/over care. My sister (married) 30F came from Amsterdam to India for a 10 day trip. She wanted to spend time with my mom and me. My parents are divorced. She didn’t want to tell my dad and her inlaws because she only had 10 days. My sister and I have been living together almost all our lives before she got married two years ago. She has severe mood swings and needs a lot of space. She gets irritated, angry and lashes out at the entire family over any minor inconvenience. Everyone has learned to walk on eggshells around her. All my childhood and adulthood I had a MAJOR problem because both my parents wouldn’t confront her on her behaviour. I am very submissive and always keep the peace. For years and years I have been taking her disrespect. And nothing more pinches me than my mom and dad not correcting her on her behaviour. FF to this trip. I flew to mumbai to greet her at the airport. I managed to keep it a surprise and get her to surpise mom. I got her a lot of things from the home city. I slept on the floor, gave her my bed for 3 nights. I went shopping for her (blouse) because she wasn’t in the mood and lashed out when reminded to get one. (we had a pooja (temple ceremony) early morning the next day). I went to the store couldn’t find one in her size so my mom and me opened the seams to one of the blouses. She sent mom to another house because she needed space and apparently my mom had enough of her bs so she conveniently left. We had to leave early morning for the other house at 4am. I was exhausted and sleep deprived. Yet when i come home at 1am, mom is gone, she is fast asleep and unpacked. So I pack all her stuff, all her suitcases, her clothes for the next day, wake up the entire night, uber to the other house 4am with her and then go to the pooja. (I wasn’t needed there) 

 Post the pooja was over, Coming to the incident, post the pooja, everyone came home and were exhausted, Sleeping and my mom’s best friend calls me. She has been so fucking helpful to our family in unimaginable ways in the recent times. I invite her for coffee in the evening. My sister in the sleep snaps her fingers like she’s talking to a labourer and creates such a fucked up face and tells me not to call her. I told her you don’t have to meet her. She still insisted. I finished the call and gave her a piece of my mind. She involved my mom and mom sided with her.  I BLASTED. i have no clue what got into me. As soon as my mom started screaming at me asking me to KEEP QUIET, I LOST IT. I told my mom off by saying that you yourself came to this house because you couldn’t stand her. You never tell her anything. I disrespected both of them fully. I had had it. I told her what all i did (errands) in the past few days. How everyone around her constantly walks on eggshells and how i won’t tolerate her demeaning and disrespecting me. We fought for an hour with lots of crying and me leaving the house to the other house. My mother lost it and tells me I won’t tolerate you disrespecting her(my sister) because she’s a married woman coming to her house. My mother texts me this when I left.  -‘ You are free to go and live your life the way you want, lam out if it

4:06 PM

Disrespecting your sister who is visiting her mom's home is the last nail in the coffin, you May be a star in your friends eyes but you are zero in my eyes’

Funnily next day my mother’s best friend (same one) calls me that you need to come asap because my sister forgot her passport here and they had left for bombay from where the next night she had her flight to Amsterdam. I had to run around for 2 hours and get the passport express couriered.

My and my now ex (both 20) met last year at University and started formarly dating on December 26. Everything went amazing, but on August ive sensed something was off and we went for a coffee and she told me there were certain things about me she didnt like, like I wasn't paying mich attention to her, we werent seeing each other a lot (mind u we saw each other EVERY DAY AT UNI and talked and texted all the time) and i wasn't affectionate enough and that.


So the next MONTHS i started to do things. Bought her coffee, we went on dates, birthday parties, even went to the cinema and HAD SEX.


So everything was great right? So a week later she broke up with me because of the same things,  its as iif even thoughI tried she couldn'tsee my effort. She told me she didnt want someone with 'those qualities' in her life, but she told me she loved me and wanted to stay in,touch and with my family and all. This was October 3rd.


The next month I was feeling like shit. I texred her crying every 2 days and couldn't even work properly, i was honesteoy bedrotting. Later that month SHE INVITED ME to a coffee and talking and i told her i couldnt be her friend and I wanted to improve and she told me ""me too, i cant see myself not being your partner"".


On november SHE INVITED ME to a show she was signing at and i went and later she toldme about how it was best for us to stop talking. I told her I wont see her again until next year and she said ""Well maybe we can see each other before December ends"".
I dont understand her.


After some pretty rough days of watching her Instagram and Pinterest I decided to block her. That was 2 weeks ago. I texted her telling her that and that I was gonna wait until end of January to see what we would do. She started talking A LOT about how there was nothing to talk about and her mind was made up day 1 (A LIE LOL) and even if I promise her i wont change cuz i was too late to change things. I told her ""Im gonna change for me, goodbye"" and she satarted yapping about ""yeah i know u can"". What a full of shit.


In the past weeks i started going to therapy, reading, meditating, adnd honestly I'm still thinking about her a lot. I dont understand cuz she says shes done but then she did all those (and many more) weird things. Some part of me still wants her back, but not as in October, idk its kinda weird now.


What i get really mad about is how she couldn't see all the things i did for her and many more when she told me about them. Its like she is blind for what I did at the beginning and everything else, she just cant see it. Im scared she's 100% made up cuz idk I still think we can work it out if she wasn't so closed off. She just doesnt trust me  idk. And I'm scared she will think ""yeah he will never give me what i deserve, im happier like this"", idk it's just so childish.


Idk some part of me still thinks she will get around, she has to, but idk anymore. And as I dont have any way of communicating or knowing what shes doing, lately ive been getting to the conclusion that WE ARE DONE SHE HATES ME ILL NEVER GET HER SHE FORGOT ABOUT EVERTRHING WE HAD, and idk its tiring man

Today I saw her Pinterest  and saw she was posting some vision board and romantic stuff and it hurts I dont understand it. She has to text me someday right??

Just got my first paper accepted to AAAI 2026 (workshop on AI for drug discovery), but the reviews were... interesting. Both reviewers said the work is solid but ""not grounded in drug discovery"" and ""pure architecture paper."" They accepted it as a poster anyway, which is cool, but now I'm wondering if I should've aimed for a different venue.



The core idea is replacing transformer attention with spectral decomposition. Instead of O(n²) pairwise comparisons, you decompose sequences into learned eigenstates that evolve independently.



The basic math

Each timestep is a superposition of K eigenstates:



h\_t = Real part of \[ sum over k: c\_k(t) · v\_k \]



where v\_k are learned eigenvectors (complex-valued basis states) and c\_k(t) are amplitudes that evolve like:



c\_k(t+1) = λ\_k · c\_k(t) + β\_k(t)



The eigenvalues λ\_k = e\^(α\_k + i·ω\_k) control how each frequency component decays (α\_k) and oscillates (ω\_k). Low-frequency eigenstates naturally capture long-range dependencies, and high-frequency ones get local patterns.



Total complexity is O(n·K·d) where K << n (I used K=64 for n=2048), so it's linear in sequence length.



 What actually worked



The results on WikiText-103 were pretty close to transformers:



\- Transformer baseline: 16.7 perplexity, 892ms per batch, 16.8GB memory

\- My model (TEN): 16.9 perplexity, 112ms per batch, 1.8GB memory

\- Hierarchical version (HTEN): 16.4 perplexity, 98ms per batch, 1.6GB



So basically 8x faster with slightly better perplexity when using multiple scales.



On Long Range Arena, it beat Transformers by a lot (83.3% vs 54.4% average) and even edged out S4 (80.8%). This makes sense because long-range tasks should benefit from explicit frequency decomposition.



 Where I'm stuck



The reviewers had legitimate criticisms:



1. ""No experiments on molecular data"" - Fair, I submitted to a drug discovery workshop without any SMILES/protein/ADMET experiments. That was dumb.



2. ""Mentions quantum mechanics, I am puzzled why"" - I used the term ""eigenstate"" because it's literally spectral decomposition, but one reviewer thought I was just throwing in physics buzzwords. Maybe I should've stuck to ""learned spectral basis"" or something.



3. No Mamba comparison - I compared against transformers and S4 but completely missed Mamba, which is probably the most relevant baseline. That's a major gap.



4. Only tested at 42M parameters - Can't claim this scales to GPT-4 size when I've only tested small models.



Questions for you all



1. Is spectral decomposition the right inductive bias for language?



My intuition is that natural language has multi-scale structure (phonemes → words → phrases → documents) that maps naturally to frequency decomposition. But maybe I'm just seeing patterns that aren't there.



2. How do I explain this isn't just SSMs with a different parameterization?



People keep saying ""this is just S4 with learned basis"" which... isn't wrong? But S4 uses HiPPO initialization (fixed), I'm learning eigenvectors end-to-end. Is that a meaningful difference or am I splitting hairs?



3. Should I resubmit to NeurIPS/ICML or publish more experimental results first?



I have AAAI acceptance but it's a workshop. Do I need to scale this to 1B+ parameters before submitting to a main conference? Or is the theoretical contribution (universal approximation proof, Lyapunov stability) enough?



4. Am I solving the wrong problem?



FlashAttention exists. Most people seem fine with optimized O(n²) rather than switching architectures entirely. Is there actually demand for true O(n) complexity, or is this academic navel-gazing?



The honest concern



I built this because I'm working on SynthOS (AI training data validation platform) and needed something that could process extremely long sequences cheaply. It works for my use case, but I don't know if anyone else actually needs this.



The energy cost difference is real (15 kWh vs 35 kWh for training), but maybe that doesn't matter at the scale most people work at?

I'm presenting the poster in February. If anyone's going to AAAI and wants to grab coffee and tell me why this is fundamentally flawed, I'd genuinely appreciate it.

I feel that every year that goes by people suffer socially especially the younger generations. So many services are online now, it’s like humans are being phased out.

Later he joined me in a work-paid Airbnb, didn’t offer to pay for meals, and said a later trip “thanked” me for caregiving. Now he earns 2× my salary, uses our joint account for his purchases, and questions my small expenses. I feel unseen and financially controlled — is this normal, or is it time to leave?

Me (29F) and my partner (29M) have been together for 4.5 years. I need an outside perspective on whether his behavior around money is normal and whether I’m wrong for feeling deeply unsettled by it.

We met during our PhDs and earned the same salary. From the beginning, we used an app (Splitwise) to split shared expenses like trips, groceries, etc. It worked fine and never caused problems.

Six months ago, I graduated and temporarily moved into his apartment for two months to make my transition easier. At the same time, he was about to undergo a major surgery, and I moved in partly so I could help take care of him. I brought some of my furniture, and he helped me set up. I clearly told him I was not freeloading and was happy to contribute to rent. Without discussing it, he immediately added half the rent to Splitwise.

About 10 days later, he had his surgery and was hospitalized for a week. He couldn’t eat solid food. Every single day, his parents and I cooked soups and mashed food and brought it to the hospital. I stayed with him 6–8 hours daily, feeding him, giving his medications, helping him move, cleaning him, and supporting him emotionally. After he came home, I continued taking care of him full-time for about two more weeks. I did all of this without expecting anything other than basic appreciation.

At the end of that same month, the second rent came, and again, without talking to me, he added half the rent to Splitwise. This deeply hurt me. I was sleeping on a mattress on the floor (which is OK), and had just acted as his full-time caregiver. I was still getting paid that month, but it felt extremely cold and dismissive. I didn’t argue immediately, but I felt something was very wrong.

A few weeks later, I traveled to Italy for a conference. My lab paid for a large Airbnb. While I was there, my partner decided to fly to Italy too to “change scenery” while recovering. When he arrived, we went out for lunch at a nice restaurant — his first restaurant meal post-surgery — and he did not offer to pay. He also continued adding his groceries to Splitwise. At lunch, he didn’t order coffee because he “didn’t want it,” but then drank half of mine.

That moment broke something in me. I felt used — not because I helped during surgery (I chose that willingly), but because I felt completely unseen, unappreciated, and financially nickel-and-dimed even after everything I had done. He was staying in my free Airbnb, benefiting from my work, and still charging me for groceries and meals.

We had a huge fight. He accused me of being “transactional” for expecting gratitude. I wasn’t asking for money — I was asking to be seen and valued. Eventually, he admitted he had been ungrateful and took me on a 5-day trip in Italy, fully paid by him.

Then came the third rent month, when I was not getting paid at all. He repeatedly asked how we were going to “handle the rent.” I avoided the conversation because I felt it was absurd — I was broke, traveling between my parents’ home and conferences, while he was fully salaried. After another massive fight, he finally agreed I should not pay that month. I said I would be willing to pay 30–40% for the previous months, not 50%, given the circumstances. He refused and said, “You lived in the flat as much as I did.” He also said he had already thanked me with the Italy trip — as if my caregiving had been a debt that was now “settled.”

Fast forward to today: we moved to a new city and both now have stable jobs. He earns about twice my salary. We split rent proportionally to income, so I pay less. We also have a joint account.

But now I’ve realized that he never takes me out to dinner using his own money anymore. Everything is paid from the joint account. He also buys his own supplements from the joint account (yes, I use them sometimes too). Meanwhile, he frequently asks me to explain what I spent 30–40 euros on from the joint account.

this could be a totally separate issue but, for about the last 6 months before I quit I started having a lot of anxiety about sleeping and couldn’t sleep alone. just a side note. 

on nov. 9 I woke up after a night out of drinking and I took an adderall. felt fine. went to grab a coffee with my boyfriend and saw a homeless man legit dead on the walk there. then go our coffee and had a sip. after that I looked around and BOOM, first episode of derealization I’ve ever had. my whole word felt not real and I felt out of body. like I was on drugs. I ran home and tried to shower and lay down - then I had what was the first panic attack of my life, I called 911. 

since then, I quit vaping for 4 days and went home to see my family. after those 4 days when I started feeling a little better, I bought a vape. the vape made me feel a lot better too. I was able to go visit my bf and be okay for the most part, just basic anxiety nothing insane and the DPDR came in waves. but it was manageable. then I decided I needed to quit because I was having anxiety. so on the last day to see my boyfriend I quit vaping. went home and felt fine. went bsck to my apt in NYC and was doing a lot better. 

met with a psychiatrist for my anxiety. got prescribed lexapro. took it once and had the WORST anxiety and DPDR. another panic attack. haven’t taken it since. 

since quitting vaping and that, I have been extremely emotional. crying every single day. extreme brain fog, trouble sleeping, constantly feeling out of body and depressed. my anxiety is at and all time high. 

I went home from New York and began to feel better a few days ago. I just got back and BOOM terrible anxiety and crying all the time again. brain fog at work is so horrible. not sleeping well.

PREFACE: THE SILVER PLAGUE

They called it progress.

The CE-FAG catalytic system—silver, iron, carbon in precise ratios—changed everything. Energy became cheap. Abundant. Democratic. For the first time in human history, power wasn't rationed by wealth or geography. It was everywhere.

The factories hummed. The cities grew. The economy soared.

No one wanted to see the cost.

It started small.

Groundwater turned grey in the industrial districts. Crops grew stunted, metallic-tasting. Animals died without visible wounds—just grey veining in their tissues, like roadmaps to nowhere.

The reports were buried. Labeled ""inconclusive."" Researchers who pushed too hard found their funding cut, their publications retracted, their careers quietly ended.

By the time anyone admitted the pattern, it was too late.

CE-FAG particulates were in the soil. In the water. In the air we breathed and the food we ate. They reacted to everything—sunlight, electrical fields, friction, heat. The environment itself became unstable. Contaminated zones appeared overnight. People collapsed in streets, markets, metro stations, seizing as their cells oxidized from within.

The hospitals called it ""acute environmental exposure syndrome.""

Everyone else called it what it was: the Silver Plague.

The corporate response was predictable.

Palliative treatments. Expensive, patented, minimally effective. Protocols designed to manage symptoms, not cure them. Insurance policies that covered ""approved therapies only."" Regulatory agencies that moved slower than the dying.

The cure existed.

It had existed for centuries.

But it wasn't profitable. And it wasn't human.

Vampires had known about silver poisoning long before CE-FAG. They'd developed chelation therapies, antioxidant cascades, redox stabilizers—compounds that could halt oxidative damage before it became irreversible. They'd used this knowledge quietly, treating their own, occasionally saving a favored human in secret.

When CE-FAG turned the world toxic, they tried to share.

The pharmaceutical companies buried it. The energy conglomerates lobbied against it. The governments, already captured by corporate interests, classified it as ""unverified alternative medicine.""

Then they went further.

They declared vampire medical practice illegal. Unauthorized. Dangerous.

They weaponized the very poison that was killing everyone.

UV-enhanced rounds that turned vampire tissue black from the inside out.

Aerosol oxidizers that triggered cascading cellular collapse.

Tactical raids on underground clinics where the dying were actually being saved.

The official narrative was simple: Vampires are hoarding cures. They must be stopped.

The truth was simpler: The cure threatens the profit model. It must be suppressed.

And so two wars began.

The visible war: military forces hunting vampire ""insurgents"" in contaminated zones.

The invisible war: scientists on both sides—human and vampire, military and resistance—racing to build what their institutions refused to allow.

A cure that worked.

An energy system that didn't poison.

A future where survival wasn't a luxury good.

This is the story of that invisible war.

Of the medics who healed in the dark.

Of the scientists who defected.

Of the slow, desperate realization that predator and prey were dying together—and only collaboration could save either species.

It begins with a girl dying in the rain.

And a stranger who shouldn't have stopped.

But did.

They called it the Silver Plague.

But plagues end.

Monopolies don't—unless you burn them down.

The contamination economy was worth more than the energy economy it

had replaced. Medical treatments, environmental remediation contracts,

""clean zones"" for the wealthy, protective equipment, monitoring systems—

an entire industrial sector built on managed poisoning.

A cure would collapse the fastest-growing economic sector in human history.

Kael saved his first human in 1847.

Silver poisoning from a mining accident.

The treatment cost him three days of work and a handful of herbs.

Two hundred years later, that same treatment became a capital offense.

CHAPTER 1: THE COLLAPSE

The lecture hall reeked of stale coffee and the ghost of long-ago chemicals, fatigue pressed into carpet and warped wood. Mira sat three rows from the front—close enough to look attentive, far enough that Professor Venn wouldn’t call on her. Her notebook was already open, pen sliding across the page, lines forming out of muscle memory and the rote hush of repetition.

CE-FAG Exposure Protocol — Symptomatic Management.

Professor Venn clicked to the next slide, the mechanical snap echoing faintly. A graph climbed in a sharp, hopeless arc: exposure rates. A second line, flat and lifeless, showed survival. He didn’t mention the gap stretching between them. No one ever did.

“There is no cure,” he said, voice worn out by habit. “Only mitigation. Antioxidants are unproven. Dangerous. Corporate protocols exist for a reason.”

Mira’s pen stilled in her hand. She’d heard all this before—different lecturer, same slides, same words. Unproven. Dangerous. Corporate protocols. The patients still died. Everyone saw it. No one named it.

The girl beside her—Tessa, second-year, always with her hand up—raised it again, fingers white with effort.
“Professor, what about the Eastern District studies? They’re reporting—”

“Unverified.” He didn’t look at her. “Journal retractions speak for themselves.”

Tessa dropped her hand, underlining something twice in her notebook. Mira didn’t need to see it. She knew what it would say. The same words she’d written six months ago.

They’re lying.

But knowing wasn’t enough. Proof was everything—and proof meant disappearing.

Professor Venn flicked to the next slide: treatment timelines, drug costs, a labyrinth of insurance clearances. Mira copied each sterile bullet point, every flowchart, her pen dragging as if it were siphoning truth out of the air and turning it into waste.

The rain started during her shift at the free clinic. Not clean rain—the kind that left a greasy film over everything, made the concrete hiss, gutters running grey. Mira pulled her hood tighter and walked on, counting the blocks to the metro. Three blocks. She could make it.

She made it one.

It started as tingling in her fingers. Then her tongue thickened, lips numb. By the next corner, a wire seemed to cinch itself around her ribs, tightening with every breath. She paused, tried to steady herself, but the world narrowed at the edges. Streetlights smeared. The ground tilted, and when she reached for the wall, her hand met empty air. Knees slammed into pavement. Cold soaked straight through her jeans, rain biting her face like static.

Not here. Not now.

Her hands curled into rigid claws, impossible to unclench. Breathing grew sharp, every inhale a blade between her ribs. She tried to count—ten, nine, eight—the protocol drilled into her memory. Her lips refused to shape the words. The numbers dissolved before she could reach them.

The pavement smelled of burnt copper. Her chest locked up.

This is it, she thought, distant. This is how it ends. Not with a cure. Not with a fight. Just collapsing on a wet street, anonymous, forgotten.

A knee struck the ground beside her.
Hands, fast and sure, turned her gently onto her side. A voice, low and calm: “Count backward from ten. Stay with me.”

She couldn’t.

“Nine, then. Say nine.”

“N—” Her voice broke. “Nine.”

“Good. Keep going.”

Fingers found her wrist, then her throat—checking, not frantic, just precise. A paramedic’s rhythm.

“Eight,” he prompted, steady.

“Eight.” Her voice was barely a whisper.

Suddenly, cold bit into her forearm, sharp and deep. A needle. She gasped.

“Don’t fight it. Breathe through your nose.”

The wire around her chest loosened. Not gone, but enough. Thin, burning air slipped back in.

Vision cleared in pulses. The man crouched over her, face shadowed beneath a gray hood, black nitrile gloves on his hands. He lifted her eyelid, flashlight flickering. His nod was just a tilt of the chin.

“Pupils responsive. You’ll be nauseous for an hour. Don’t eat. Don’t drink alcohol.”

He stood.

Mira’s hand lashed out, clumsy and weak, closing on his wrist.

He looked down, still half in shadow. Tall, lean, older than her—maybe thirty, maybe more—weathered wrong for his age, a thin line of scars tracing his jaw. But his eyes, catching what little light there was, seemed too bright. Too still. Not quite human.

“What—” She couldn’t get the rest out.

“Quiet.” He snapped the penlight on again, checked her eyes a second time. “You’ll live.”

He reached into his coat, pulled out a small, folded paper sachet, and pressed it into her palm.

“Activated charcoal. Manganese stabilizer. Take it tonight, before bed. You’ll sleep badly. Better than dying.”

He started to leave.

“Wait—”

But he was already gone. Three strides, a turn, vanished down an alley before she could even push herself up.

She sat in the rain, hand tingling where the needle had gone in, pulse still a little ragged.

Chest rising, falling.
Steady now.

Thirty seconds ago, she’d been dying. Now she wasn’t.

Professor Venn said there was no cure.

But this man—this thing—had undone death with a needle and a whisper.

Mira looked at the sachet: plain, unmarked, folded paper, just a weight of powder. She slipped it into her pocket, finally forced herself upright. Her legs shook as she made her way home through the acid rain, not stopping until the apartment door clicked shut behind her.

That night, the sachet sat on her desk—small and impossibly heavy.

Her hands trembled, not from exposure, but from whatever was left behind. Adrenaline gave way to exhaustion. She should sleep, eat, report the incident. Instead, she opened her laptop and typed:
R-lipoic acid chelation CE-FAG exposure.

The first three pages were nothing but warnings. Unverified treatment. Not FDA approved. May cause kidney failure, neural disruption. She scrolled. Page four held a retracted study—significant reduction in acute CE-FAG toxicity with antioxidant chelation therapy. Retracted for “methodological inconsistencies.”

On page six she found a cached forum post, deleted:
If you know someone who knows, get the formula. It works. They don’t want you to know it works.

Her fingers hovered over the trackpad. She dug into the university database, searching again.

Forty-three results. Thirty-nine: insufficient evidence, not recommended, potential harm. Four said “promising results, requires further investigation”—all retracted.

Mira leaned back, chest tight, not from toxins this time but from the shape of a lie.

She glanced at the sachet.
Take it tonight before bed.

She opened it, poured the powder into a glass of water, watched it swirl into a faint grey suspension—smoke in oil. She lifted the glass, paused. This could kill you, she thought. Unknown composition. Unknown source.

He saved your life. The system didn’t. He did.

She drank.

It tasted of rust and old ash. She set the glass down and waited.

Three days later, she returned to the street where she’d fallen, asked a vendor if he’d seen a tall man in a gray hood, moved too fast. He stared like she’d grown a second head.

She walked a block, then another. Nothing.

On the fourth day, a woman selling chelation kits from a folding table paused when Mira described the man.

“You don’t want to find him,” the woman said.

“I do.”

“Why?”

Mira hesitated. “He saved my life.”

The woman studied her for a long moment, then exhaled. “Loading dock. Three blocks east. Red door. Don’t go during the day.”

“Why not?”

The woman just looked away, watching the rain.

Her head leaned against the window, feeling vibrations emanating from the train, getting lost in the clutter of its countless wheels. Ah, so many uncertainties, so many doubts. She felt the weight of her family’s issues on her shoulders, even if only partially.*

*“Maybe it’s not going to be that bad?” She thought to herself, glancing for a moment at an old suitcase she placed beside herself. “But when will I get to see them again? In months?” A sigh followed, a futile attempt at dispersing worries. Soon enough her new life would begin, yet what will it bring?*

**Greetings, everyone!**

*₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚*

Hope you're all doing amazing! 
I am aware that the sample above does not tell much about the actual plot, yet I wished to include it as an example of my writing (I can write more, depending on the situation in the roleplay itself ;).

But Frog, you may ask, what is this roleplay even about? Well, let me tell you:
Zofia, a 19 year old daughter of a financially-struggling family, is sent to work as a maid in a noble household, somewhere distant. My main goal for this roleplay is to explore how her new life would look like, everyday chores and challenges that her occupation brings, relations between her coworkers (both camaraderie and conflict) and other members of the household as well as perhaps events happening in the town they’d live in. It's a simple premise, but one that gives us so many possibilities! I'd love to hear your ideas as well ^^

A bunch of extra details:
- *Please know that even though I am looking for someone to GM this story, I’ll contribute as much as you wish. Be it brainstorming, playing some side characters, you name it. As someone who knows how it is to GM, I wish for you to enjoy the roleplay as well (＾-＾)*
- *While this roleplay is meant to be wholesome and cozy, there will be some more somber tones from time to time.*
- *Brainstorming and worldbuilding! Whether we decide to place it in our real world Victorian era, or perhaps a fictional setting, I’d appreciate it if we dedicated some time to setting up the plot, adjusting it and tailoring to our wants, deciding on the core themes as well as worldbuilding (the household, for example).*
- I’d love to capture the aesthetics of manga/anime, even with the ways we’d write our roleplay. Some exaggeration, tropes and so one are very welcome :D
- *I am open to romance, although only between two women ^^” I don’t mind it being a sizable part of our story, however, I don’t want it to overshadow everything else, nor feel rushed.*


*₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚*

**About me:**

*₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚*

Why hello! I shall introduce myself a bit, so that you also know who you’re dealing with. You may call me Frog. I’m a passionate, 18+ roleplayer from CET/GMT +1 timezone. However, I do not think those pose any obstacle in terms of writing, so don’t be deterred by that even if you’re from a completely different part of our space-roaming disc silly autocorrect, I meant globe :P. Besides that, I don’t have much to share about me, I reckon. I love cats though, that’s worth a mention!

The [X4Y] tag does reflect the gender of my characters, not my own. I prefer not sharing it. I hope you’ll understand <3

₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚

**About you:**

₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚

Here you’ll find a few requirements, so that we are sure we match.
- *Be 18+. Do not tell me your exact age or real gender, just confirm if you are 18+*
- *Be literate. I love writing, especially descriptions, which I find to greatly enhance the storytelling. I usually provide around 2-4 paragraphs per response and would ask for my partner to be able to match that. However, I’ve recently been hoping to try a short-length approach for conversations to make them more dynamic ^^* 
- *Be creative! Cheesy, I know, but hey, I don’t want to be the only one coming up with the ideas. This premise has so much potential for unique and intriguing tales, let’s brainstorm them together!*
- *Be excited! Yeah, another cheesy one. Yet, I find it so fun to see an enthusiastic reply!*

Alright, here’s the deal—I’ve been thinking it’s probably time to meet someone new. Someone who’s got a quick wit, can keep things light, and isn’t afraid of a little playful banter.

I’m in Canada, up in the mountains (Mountain Time Zone, if you’re wondering), where the sunsets are epic and the air’s always a little fresher than you’d expect. But since I work EST hours, I’m usually up early, catching the quiet hours before most people are even thinking about their morning coffee. So if you're into early morning chats or spontaneous convos, we might just be on the same wavelength.

**RED FLAG ALERT!! I'm married and looking for something strictly online, if this isn't your cup of tea totally get it.**

I’m not into small talk—I’m looking for someone who knows how to keep a conversation fun and interesting. If you can throw a little flirt into the mix, make me laugh, and keep things flowing, we’ll probably click pretty quickly.

I’m also a fan of spontaneous adventures—whether it’s tracking down some hidden gem of a restaurant or imagining our next getaway to somewhere totally unexpected. If you're into that sort of thing, we’ll probably get along pretty well.

To kick things off: If you could live anywhere for a year, no questions asked, where would it be? I love hearing about places people dream of—or even random ideas for places you think are totally underrated.

If that sounds like your vibe, send me a message. Tell me about a place that’s left an impression on you, or one you can’t wait to visit. Let’s see where this goes.

1pjdivu,https://i.redd.it/k8w09q1rrf6g1.jpeg,Genuine question about bus lanes,"Hey so just looking for some clarification here- I was turning out of the Starbucks drive through onto Douglas st, I turned right into the nearest right lane (in this case the bus lane). Excuse my lazy illustration lol 

The light at the intersection went red immediately after I turned right, so I stopped. A man to my left (centre-right lane on Douglas) rolled down his window and sarcastically yelled at me “are you a bus?” obviously indicating he didn’t think I should be in bus lane. But I was going to be turning right onto Speed Ave, which is within a block of where I currently was.

I didn’t have my right turn signal on (yet) because of that little connecting st that’s immediately after the light, as my driving instructor taught me never to signal right until you’ve cleared any other streets to your right before your intended turn, as to not cause an accident by making someone think you’re turning right onto the street they’re currently waiting to exit from (ie in this case make their right turn onto Douglas before I approached Speed Ave). 

Am I losing it here, or was he? Lol. I was always taught not to occupy or coast in the bus lane as it’s not an HOV lane, but that you’re allowed to enter bus lane if your intended right turn is within the nearest block. Which is what I did. 

It’d make no sense (and be illegal I think?) for me to have exited the Starbucks drive through and turn right into the right-centre lane on Douglas, and then make my right turn onto Speed Ave from the right-centre lane effectively cutting off the bus lane to my right in order to turn onto Speed Ave… right? 😅

My response to him was “yeah because I’m turning right you weirdo” then the light went green and I put my signal on and approached Speed Ave and made my turn, but I want to make sure I’m not the one losing it here because I’m doubting myself lol ",3,1765398375.0,VictoriaBC,20,0.62,False

1pjdd8z,https://i.redd.it/75qmffjoqf6g1.jpeg,All the details I caught during the re watch of the movie,"All the details I caught re watching the movie

Some are pretty well known, other I caught in later viewings, just a compilation:

\\- The Butterfly that is seen getting eaten by a Spider is a Monarch Butterfly. Is poisonous for spiders that eat it. Reze fell into the trap of love

\\- At the end, you see the board with the recommendations of the caffee, with the old menu erased and a new put in place. Reze erased the old menu, and put the options that Denji liked the most.

\\- In the Phone Booth, Reze was holding her choker, and had her other hand in her back pocket, the same that at the end reveals she had her knife in. She was about to kill Denji right then and there, but started laughing and crying cause she couldn’t once she saw his face, she fell in love

\\- The white flower Denji gave Reze is a White Daisy. It means innocence, love at first sight and fresh beginnings. The red flower that Reze is holding at the end and makes her go back to Denji is a Red Daisy, that means deep romantic love, passion, courage and vitality.

\\- When Reze sees Denji riding Beam, she burst out laughing, wheezing. It’s recurring that Reze can’t hold her laughter at any of Denji’s jokes. At the beach, she burst out laughing, and immediately copes out saying that all her actions were a lie. She was doing a desperate lie in an attempt to keep Denji away from her, safe. 

\\- Reze is shown to be a horrible liar. Even at the Special Division 2 Trainning Center, she couldn’t even put a decent performance to fool anyone. It ties to the end, that she couldn’t even hold the lie that she didn’t care about Denji, a fact that Denji immediately disputed and she couldn’t even back up.

\\- When Reze is singing her lullaby, it shows Makima drinking coffee, then looking out the window, and nodding her cup in rithim with Reze’s song. She was drinking coffee that late just because it was the same drink Reze gave Denji, and her nodding the cup was because she was listening to them.

\\- Reze cut Denji’s tongue mid kiss and after because she got jealous.  She confessed to Denji, and he rejected her. It was her first time experiencing love, jealousy and rejection, so she falled back on what she knew: violence and her mission. Even then, couldn’t contain herself of kissing Denji again. But she refrained to do it at the beach, cause it would have meant for him to get hurt (and then broke his neck lol)

\\- Reze arrived late at her work to the caffee despite being just a two minute walk away. A caffee thst is always empty, pooly managed, and she being a lousy waitress. It was her front, she wasn’t planning on coming back after killing Denji in the phone booth. She just kept coming because she wanted to keep seeing him.

\\- Reze is the only character in the entire movie to never call Denji Chainsaw. Even, in the entire series up to the manga, she’s the only one who not even once called him Chainsaw.

\\- When Denji is complaining about how everyone is after Chainsaw’s heart and not his, Reze immediately jumps to confirm to Denji that she was being honest about her love to him. And then doubles down when Denji mentions Makima, about “it wouldn’t have worked if her runned away together”, and visibly wimpers, somethin that Denji mockingly imitates. She was willing to do a lot, but not to have Denji have doubts about her feelings

\\- When she transforms at the trainning center and separates her body from her bomb self, she’s seen naked. But when she chases Denji in the car, she’s seen wearing white panties. So she was about to chase Denji, realised she was naked, quickly took a detour to get her panties from somewhere, and resumed the chase.

\\- If you zoom at her notebook when she’s studying, you can see she wrote Denji’s name a couple of times next to hearts

\\- When Angel tells Denji he can chose between letting Reze kill him or he kills her, he answers with “that choice is easy enough”. But before he told Reze he is “arresting her”, he said in the beach that it was worth it for him to be killed by her, and when he dragged her into the ocean, he disolved the chainsaws of his feet and turned his head away to avoid hurting her. 

\\- When they both fall into the sea, the memories we see of them in the pool are Reze’s. She even lays her head in Denji’s shoulder, the same thing we saw her doing when she hugged him in the beach. She was willing to die right next to him.

\\- It is muted by the audio, but when she spots Denji in the caffee and starts running towards him, she mutters “Denji-Kun”

\\- When Angel is explaining to Aki about the fable of the City and the Country Mouse, Aki is seem visibly shaken and doesn’t answer. In the flashback when Aki last saw his family, it’s show that his parents were reading his little brother that same fable in a book. It was the last thing they were doing before being killed by the Gun Devil",149,1765398015.0,RezeCult,19,0.99,False

Beta is open. Free to test. 🙌

Why we built Liqom.com ?

Managing finances in Morocco is honestly a pain.

Most tools you use today: •	Have zero idea what DGI compliance even means •	Force you to work in English •	Make you calculate VAT manually every single time •	Don’t support Arabic •	And waste you 10–15 hours a month just trying to make things work

We got tired of it. So we built something actually made for Morocco.

What Liqom does

Straightforward features that work for real Moroccan businesses: •	Create invoices in 2 minutes (DGI compliant, VAT auto-calculated) •	Work in French or Arabic — your choice •	AI extracts data from supplier invoices (no more manual typing) •	Convert quotes to invoices in one click •	Track payments and who owes you what in real time •	Everything in MAD. Everything compliant. Everything simple.

Try it out : No credit card. No tricks. No nonsense.

We need real businesses to test it — your feedback will shape the final product.

Throughout the entire match, Magnus heart rate stayed in the 80s and 90s (beats per minute) and Hikarus was consistently up in the 120s and 130s. This was despite both of them appearing calm on the outside. 

The interesting part is that Hikaru is known for his love of coffee, and he’s known to drink a lot of it, even appearing on channels like Coffee Chess and guzzling the stuff. While Magnus is known to never touch caffeine. 

While both of them compete at the very highest level successfully, I couldn’t help but marvel at the difference in resting heart rate. The icing on the cake was that of course Magnus won 😎

I hear it in my mother’s distant tone on the rare occasions we speak. I see it in the eyes of my friends who grew tired of hearing about my panic attacks years ago. I feel it in the way the cashier at Whole Foods smiles at him when he gently whispers: “It’s okay, honey, I’ve got it. I know you forgot your wallet again.”



Ethan is the Saint. I am the Burden. That has been our dynamic for five years. Ever since I lost my job at the marketing firm. Ever since my family stopped talking to me. Ever since I drove my car into that guardrail on I-95.



Ethan was always there to sweep up the glass.



Today is Thursday. Ethan is in Chicago for a conference. The house is quiet—a sterile, museum-like silence that I maintain religiously for him. When I spilled my coffee on his old laptop—the one he lets me use for recipes and Netflix—I felt that familiar hollow drop in my stomach. Pure dread. Not because Ethan would yell. Ethan never raises his voice. But because he would look at me with that gentle, crushing disappointment, stroke my hair, and say: “See, Sarah? This is why I have to handle everything. You’re just so... fragile.”



I ran downstairs to Josh, the guy in apartment 4B. He’s a tech guy who smells like stale vape smoke and energy drinks. I begged him to recover the data before Ethan got back.



""Hard drive is fine,"" Josh said after an hour. ""I put everything on a flash drive for you. But..."" He paused, rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly. ""But what?"" ""Does your husband write crime novels? or work for the CIA?"" ""He’s an architect, Josh. Why?"" ""He’s got some weird folders, Sarah. Really... detailed ones.""



I took the drive and went back upstairs. Curiosity is a flaw, Ethan always tells me. But fear is a much stronger motivator.



I opened the folder Josh had flagged. It was simply named: ""Project S."" I thought it was a house. A skyscraper. A stadium. I double-clicked. And my heart stopped.



They weren’t blueprints. They were records. File 1: A scanned PDF. An anonymous letter sent to the HR department of my old firm, five years ago. The letter detailed how ""Sarah Miller is selling trade secrets to competitors."" Attached were falsified chat logs. The letters danced before my eyes. I wasn’t fired for incompetence, as I had believed for years. I wasn’t let go because of bad luck. The letter was sent from our home IP address. From Ethan’s laptop.



I opened the next file. A set of photos of my sister, caught at a coffee shop with my ex-boyfriend. The photos were subtly edited, cropped to look intimate, damning. Beneath them, a draft of an email to my parents: “I thought you deserved to know what kind of daughter you really have...” I covered my mouth, stifling a scream. The estrangement from my family... their silence for three years... he engineered it. He severed the ties so I would belong only to him.



I was shaking. The air in the room felt thick, like syrup. There was one more file. Just one. Date: October 12, 2021. Two days before my accident. It was an invoice from a shady auto shop in New Jersey. Not for repairs. But for worn-out parts. A handwritten note, scanned, in Ethan’s neat, architectural block letters: “Bleed the brake line, but don't cut it. It needs to fail during a hard stop, not while cruising. I want a scare, not a funeral.”



I shut the laptop. The silence in the apartment wasn’t sterile anymore. It was deafening.



I looked around. At my perfectly curated life. The anti-anxiety meds on the nightstand—prescribed by the doctor he recommended. The SUV in the driveway that I’m too terrified to drive because he insists on driving me everywhere. The joint bank account I don’t have the password to because he handles the finances so I ""don't get stressed.""



I didn’t have bad luck. I wasn’t clumsy. I wasn’t broken. I was dismantled. Piece by piece, screw by screw, Ethan took me apart so he could rebuild me as a pet that couldn't survive without its master. He created the storms just so he could sell me the umbrella.



My phone buzzed on the granite countertop. Caller ID: My Rock. I answered mechanically. My voice sounded like it was coming from another room. ""Hello?"" ""Hey, baby,"" his voice was warm, a smooth baritone. ""I just got to the hotel. Are you okay? Did you eat? Don't forget to set the alarm.""



For a split second, I wanted to scream. To tell him I knew. To run to the police. But then I looked at the front door. The door he chose. Solid oak, heavy deadbolt. If I run, where do I go? No one believes me. I’m ""Sarah the unstable one,"" ""Sarah with the pills,"" the ungrateful wife of Saint Ethan. If I tell him I know, the game ends. And next time, he might want more than just a ""scare.""



I took a deep breath. I wiped the single tear tracking down my cheek. I smiled, even though no one could see me. A cold, sharp smile I hadn't used in five years.



""I'm fine, honey,"" I said, and my voice came out sweet, perfect. ""I was just thinking about you. I can't wait for you to come home.""



""Good girl. I'm glad you're safe. Love you.""



He hung up. I stood up from the stool. My hands weren't shaking anymore. Ethan wanted a dependent wife, a broken doll he could fix forever. Well, Ethan made one miscalculation in ""Project S."" He forgot that when you take everything a person has to lose, you also take away their fear.



I walked to the kitchen island and picked up the chef's knife to finish chopping vegetables for his favorite dinner. The blade felt heavy, sharp, and cold in my hand. I will play the role. I will be the perfect, scared, fragile wife. I will wait. A day, a month, a year. Until his guard is down. Until he makes a real mistake, not a manufactured one.



He built a perfect cage. He just forgot he locked himself inside with me.

So, I figured I'd review a favorite. Please keep in mind that I haven't tried the ""new label"" yet so your experience with this bottle may be different. Also, obviously, palates are different. 

Nose: coffee, chocolate covered cherries, vanilla, orange zest 

Palate: cherry, baking spices, espresso, brown sugar 

Finish: long, orange zest, baking spices, brown sugar, vanilla, coffee

Overall: this is a great bottle of bourbon imo. It has a nice balance of brown sugar, fruit, and spice but not too much spice. Sometimes, when I drink this, it's a nice reminder that good whiskey isn't that hard to find nor do you have to pay an arm and leg for.

1pjd9jn,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1pjd9jn/the_barista_mixed_me_up_with_someone_else_and_i/,The barista mixed me up with someone else and I just kind of.. rolled with it,"So this happened like two weeks ago and I’m still slightly embarrassed but also kind of amused at how long I kept the bit going. There’s this tiny coffee shop near my bus stop that I pop into maybe once or twice a week, nothing fancy, just good cappuccinos and a weirdly soothing playlist that’s probably just lo fi beats on shuffle. Anyway , I walk in one morning half asleep, hoodie up, absolutely not mentally present, and the barista goes “Hey, you’re back early today, Milan!” I froze for a second because that’s definitely not my name, but she sounded so confident and happy to see me that my sleepy brain just nodded like, yep, sure, Milan reporting for duty. She hands me a latte before I even order, says “the usual,” and I swear to god I have never ordered anything there often enough to have a usual.  

I figured it was a one time mix up and I’d quietly correct her next visit. Except when I came back two days later, she saw me and immediately lit up and went “Milan, want the same thing again?” And I panicked. Like an idiot I just said “yeah, same thing,” because apparently my brain was committed to this new identity. At this point I was wondering what kind of person Milan even is. Do we look alike? Does he tip well ? Is he lactose intolerant and I’m stealing his drink order. The funniest part is that the other barista started greeting me as Milan too, which means she’d told him about me, which means my accidental fake identity was spreading. I didn’t know how to undo it without making it super weird, so I just kept being Milan for another week. 

Eventually I finally snapped out of it when she asked how my “midterms went,” and I realized Milan is apparently significantly younger than me. I laughed and said “oh, I think you’ve got me mixed up with someone else,” and she did that mortified inhale people do when they’re embarrassed. She apologized like five times and I told her it's totally fine, I’m the idiot who answered to the wrong name all week. Now she knows my real name and still jokes “morning, Not Milan,” every time I come in. Honestly, it’s a pretty solid upgrade . ",70,1765397784.0,CasualConversation,2,0.96,False
1pjd94v,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1pjd94v/breakup_because_of_contract_abroad/,Breakup because of contract abroad,"Hi everyone! Me (29 M) her Martha (name changed- 31 F). We both were living in Poland at the time.

1. I will explain first how we met and what was going on.
2. How it came to the breakup
3. My thoughts and states during the process (it's still quite fresh)

**How we met and the connection**

So we first time met at the beginning of July 2025, during dog walk (we both have dogs). Somehow I started conversation i don’t really remember how. After 2-3 more bumps like that we exchanged contact. We went for 1 date, then 2nd date and 3rd date we kissed. And from that point onwards, everything was going well and it was developing into more deeper and deeper connection. And everything seemed perfect. Our love language was the same, overall direction of life was similar and our ambitions. I mean it was great, I never had connection like that with any woman before.

And the amount warmth that she gave me in that 4 months and the compliments i heard I think in my last relationship which lasted 5 years I didn't get that much warmth. So I felt content.

Now a bit of professional background (because it is VERY IMPORTANT):

Me - Working in a corporate job in Krakow

She - Professional, really high level acrobatic (don't want to go into details, because it might be too specific)

So when we started dating she was saying that she will probably need to go for the contract to the US for few months. Which obviously at the beginning I ignored, because I wasn't too sure where it's going so naturally I was a bit distanced, but that started changing at the beginning of September on my end. I started to treat it more seriously and matching her energy in terms of warmth and engagment, maybe sometimes exceeding her levels.

Basically it seemed like it was going into right direction I met her cousin and that cousin fiance as well has her brother. I never met her mom though, but she was also showing me pictures of her and her family when she was a child, so overall it looked to me that we are going into something serious.

**IMPORTANT**

When that contract became reality she was saying to me that she really does NOT want to go there and she would love to stay in Kraków, and open her own acrobatics school, but she does not have enough money and needs to go to earn some more. And just to be clear she was saying about the school very early when we started dating, so I doubt it could be smoke and mirrors just when the contract became real. And her big worry was leaving her dog with her family and she was struggling with that

**2. Start of the breakup**

**So her contract was suppose to start at the end of October 2025 and last till July 2026 and it was confirmed.** We have decided we will go for a holiday to Italy at the beginning of October and it was absolutely amazing. And when we came back on Monday I asked her, maybe she wants to meet my aunt next weekend. And she said ""Sure why not"".  
Fast forward to friday she stayed at mine, and in the middle of the night she said she wants to go home. So she went. On Saturday she send me a message that she won't join dinner at mine with my aunt, because she does not live in fairy tale anymore and she is worried how it will be during her contract and she prefers to meet her when she will be back. But after that message she started to distance herself.

On monday we met and we discussed that(**that was 3 weeks before her deprature to us)**. She said she is worried because we her exes she was glued to the phone and couldn't focus on work. And this time she place her career at first place and wants to be fully focus and present there and she is not sure if that's gonna work. But we managed at the end to come to conclusion that we will try to hold that relationship (and from that moment we started to actually call it relationship). but when she was leaving I double checked with her ""So we are together, trying to make it work and we waiting for each other, right?""  
She responded ""Yes, we are living our lives and waiting for each other, but when something will change we are saying that"". Alright cool.

The warmth was back, week before her departure we went to weekend trip to the mountains with our dogs (**She even took picture of us holding hands when I was driving**), it was super amazing, and even in her last week in Poland she spend 5 of the evenings with me. Which was obviously signal for me that she cares.

BUT

On the last day - Sunday, day before her departure we went for a coffee. She came to my car and I saw tears, but she was trying to hide that. When we actually went for a coffee I noticed a little distance, nothing big, but I noticed the difference. And when the moment that we suppose to say goodbay she didn't really kissed me in the way she used to.

**Departure and the Breakup**

27th October - flight to US. When she was boarding the plane i got a text ""I already miss you"" When she landed I just checked if she is okay.

The next days I was feeling a lot of distance, responses with one sentence or 1 word, I was feeling like I talk to completely different person.

30th of October - I cracked and decided we need to talk about it. Before the actual conversation she send me a long voice message basically saying that she is worried that she is not able to give me what I need, and doesn't to keep me in limbo, but she said we can call if I want. I decided let's go with call. And after that conversation i was saying something along the lines ""why you want to break good relationship only for maybes"", because her main argument was that she does not know what will happen to her life, she want to go with a career flow now and it might be that she will stay in US if that will be worth it. But at the end we AGAIN came to agreement we will try and instead of texting (because she was claiming busyness) we will send a voice messages instead. Again warmth came back for few days.

2nd of November - Evening. I sent her a very supportive voice message that I am really proud of her, that I am proud how she is handling current situation, how she pursue her dreams and how strong she is.  
She basically responded with a voice message immeditaly saying: I did not expect support like that, everyone was always saying I am fucked up that I am doing this thing. Thank you very much I don't deserve it.

**BREAKUP**

From that point despite what she said coldness started again

6th of November - I received a long voice message in the middle of the night, and I was awake so I listened. And it was basically a breakup voice message. Basically she was saying that she does not think that this relationship is going to right direction, she does not want anyone to miss her and espescially wait for her when she does not know what will happen to her life. She said she knows why I don't sleep, that she was in similar situation. She said I don't deserve a roller coaster I have with her and I deserve a woman that will be by my side. And she also mentioned that is not a case that she doesn;t feel anything to me, because if she wouldn't date me for 4 months, but maybe she was madly in love it would be different. And that she had too much fun in Poland and she realised that she needs to focus on her career and doesn't want any relationship in the next 10 years (which is an obvious bullshit). And she also said ""I know you will want to call and talk this through but I will not be able to tell you that over the phone""

I responded with some arguments and questions, but it is not relevant what I said there.

7th of November I got a short voice message from her: ""Hi, I just wanted to let you know that I am still processing all of that in my head. I hope you are well and I just wanted to tell that it was great to see you and your dog on insta stories. Please do it more often""

At this point I was happy because I thought I will get a response

9th of November - Whole day nothing and around 4pm my time and 10am her time I see insta story where she is laying by the pool with coffee. I didn't hesistate and send her a message ""Hey Martha! I hope you are doing well and you manage to process that topic. Do you have time today to call in talk that through"" **AND HERE I GOT GHOSTED**

BUT

13th of November - I got a reel from her with the breed of my dog, which i responded ""Literally \[my\_dog\_name\]"" and she responded something, then I. Silence

17th of November - I send her pic of my dog with some comment about the weather because he was wet on the pic. And we exchanged couple very lite messages that day.

From that moment we have complete silence. Only thing that happen **I got restricted on her insta** around 26th of november. And restiction means I can still see her profile and her posts, but I cannot see her stories and pinned stories. And she posts a lot of her stories because she has a few thousands followers and that's also part of her job/promotion

**States and Thoughts**

First 2 weeks was an absolute nightmare, because there was uncertainty. She was cold, then hot then cold again and I had no idea what is going on. And the breakup and ghosting was painful of course, but at least I know where i stand now. Luckily my friends gave me a lot of support.

Then about 3 weeks I was in spiral thinking what happened and why. There where I discovered attachement theory and I think she has Avoidant attachment, so that fact gave me some answers why she acted like that and she is not 1 in a billion who acts like that. But still many of question marks still stayed. I spend HOURS using gemini understand behaviours and asking questions about probabilities of contact/rekindling etc.

Now it is fairly okay, she is still on my mind everyday, but at least my mind does not bring back only positives. Actually now my mind remembers the negatives, however still fantasize about what she might be doing there, how is she feeling etc. Guys I love(loved) that girl and that's the problem. 4 months was enough.

But the biggest flaw in my mind is fact that I have hope we will reconnect when she will be back in Poland, I am trying to fight it, becasue I know it's toxic and prevents healing or looking for a ""better"" person, however my logic mind kicks in and I think I have pretty strong arguments why.

1. The relationship was in it's peak, nothing happened between us. We both seemed happy. She just cut it off like she switched masks when she landed in US
2. I believe if she wouldn't need to leave we will be happy together now
3. I don't know what to think about her school target, it seemed real when she was saying that, but she switched to narration she might try to chase career in US IF THAT WILL BE WORTH. However she still said the school is a main goal.
4. She have a dog here which she loves to bits so she will come back.
5. Despite she restricted me to not see her stories she is still watching mine (really quickly usually, but I post once a week or 2 weeks sometimes)
6. Right now she is in major US city so she has a lot of distraction and 1 of the best studios in the world to train in. From January till late July she will be on the ship, I think that will hit her mental energy hard
7. Right now I am out of sight, so probably out of mind (some people apparently can do it). But I think when she will be back nostalgia will hit her hard. I forgot important details above. We are living about 200m apart from each other

What do you guys think? Let me know if you have any questions I am happy to clarify.

Let’s be honest for a second. In our modern world, screens are *everywhere*. Smartphones in our pockets, tablets on the coffee table... and let's face it, sometimes you just need 20 minutes to cook dinner or take a shower without a tiny human clinging to your leg. 🚿🍝

The question I see constantly in forums and pediatric offices is: **""When can my baby safely watch TV?""**

Those colorful cartoons and catchy songs seem harmless, right? Well, the science is actually pretty nuanced (and a little surprising). I dove into the latest research and guidelines from the AAP and WHO, and here is the breakdown of what is actually happening in those little brains. 🧠

# The Short Answer: The 18-Month Threshold

If you are looking for a hard number, here it is: **For children younger than 18 months, screen media should be avoided.** 🚫

Why? It’s not just about ""too much screen time."" It’s about **cognitive limitations**. The infant brain processes information very differently than ours.

# The Science: The ""Video Deficit"" 📉

This is the fascinating part. There is a psychological phenomenon called the **""video deficit.""** Research shows that toddlers learn significantly *less* from a video than they do from a live demonstration.

If a toddler watches someone hide a toy on a screen, they struggle to find it in real life. If they watch through a window? They find it easily. 🧸

**Why does this happen?** It takes about **18 months** for a baby’s brain to understand that symbols on a screen represent real-world objects. Before that leap, cartoons are essentially just **sensory noise**.

* **The Orienting Reflex:** You know how your baby stares intently at the screen? It looks like engagement, but it’s often just a reflex. They are reacting to **flashing lights and quick cuts**, not processing the story. 😵‍💫

# The Risks of Early Exposure

I know, ""Baby Einstein"" videos promise to make our kids geniuses. But the evidence suggests the opposite might be true.

# Language Delays 🗣️

Studies have shown that for infants aged 8 to 16 months, **each hour of baby DVDs was linked to a vocabulary decrease.** They could know 6 to 8 *fewer* words for every hour watched.

# The Background Noise Problem

Even if the baby isn't watching, **background TV is harmful.**

* A parent typically speaks about **940 words per hour**.
* With the TV on? That number drops by **770 words**. 📉 Less parental speech means less ""scaffolding"" for the baby's language skills.

# Sleep & Attention 😴

Blue light messes with **melatonin**, and fast-paced shows can **condition the brain** to expect constant stimulation, potentially making real-life play (like building blocks) seem ""boring"" by comparison.

# Is There Any Exception? (Yes!)

There is one exception to the ""No Screens"" rule: **Video Chatting.** 📱👵

FaceTime, Skype, or Zoom with family is different because it involves **social contingency**. If Grandma waves and the baby smiles back, that is genuine interaction. This is distinct from passive consumption.

# So, What Should We Do? (18-24 Months)

Once they hit the **18 to 24-month transition**, you can introduce high-quality media, but with a catch: **Co-viewing is key.** 👨‍👩‍👧

Don't let them watch alone. Sit with them.

* ""Look, the dog runs!"" 🐕
* ""What color is that car?"" 🚗

You have to bridge the gap between the screen and the real world.

# Summary & Tips

* **Wait until 18 months** (except for video chats).
* **Avoid ""educational"" claims** for infants; they are mostly marketing myths.
* **Eliminate background TV;** if no one is watching, turn it off to boost language exposure.
* **Be a role model;** our kids mimic our phone habits!

I know this is a tough topic because screens are such a big part of our lives. **How do you handle screen time boundaries in your house?** I’d love to hear your strategies! 👇
