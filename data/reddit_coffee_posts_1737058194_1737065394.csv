If I were to quit vaping fully, I'd just start abusing something else. It is almost guaranteed. It could be alcohol, food, coffee - a consumable that makes me feel good has to be abused.  It's like quitting sex - if I were to stop having sex I'd end up masturbating like a maniac instead - it's inevitable. I can't, nor am I willing to quit all forms of stimulation.

I actually kind of quit vaping every time I run out of juice - I often don't vape for 1-5 days after that and I actually kind like the nicotine withdrawal feeling because for me it feels similar to the buzz. Once that ends I buy new liquid and the cycle repeats. So for me the process of quitting itself is easy, but the motivation doesn't exist.

So can someone give me a reason to quit? Or someone who's like me, what should I replace vaping with?",1,1737065039.0,QuitVaping,0,1.0,False
1i30n3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1i30n3s/are_any_of_these_symptomsbehaviors_familiar/,Are any of these symptoms/behaviors familiar?,"Hello ladies! I’m looking for some input for women diagnosed later in life. I’m almost 38, I have a good job that I’ve been at for 14 years, and I seem to function well enough. I had a psychologist give me some computer ADHD test years ago, and he said I focus better than like 98% of the population so I dropped it. However, I’m looking at going back to therapy, and friends keep pointing out that some of my issues may be related to ADHD, so here I am! Does any of this resonate with any of you? 

• I was a really good student until middle school. I have no idea how to study. My grades in high school and college were either As and Bs or Fs. Things that interested me or came to me naturally I usually did pretty well in, and anything that didn’t interest me or required effort always resulted in me failing the class at least once.
• My desk at work is immaculate, but my home is a chaotic mess. I can’t keep my house clean on a daily basis. It usually piles up, and then I break down and clean the house for like 6 hours straight. I always tell myself that once it’s clean I can just focus on maintenance cleaning, but that never works.
• Speaking of work, I’m really good at getting things done fast. Outside of work, not so much.
• I’m late to like 90% of events or work. Sometimes I make it on time, but I really underestimate how long tasks take (makeup, hair, stopping for gas, etc.)
• I have like 20 unfinished craft projects. I usually go pretty hard on a project for a couple of days or weeks and then it gets thrown in a closet somewhere. I started a cross-stitch pattern as a gift for my old boss in 2020, and I cannot for the life of me finish the stupid thing.
• My husband complains that I don’t ever listen to him, when in reality I’m working on something and am too focused to pay attention to what’s going on around me.
• I’m a smoker.
• Caffeine doesn’t seem to affect me. I’ve been known to drink coffee or energy drinks and go right to bed.
• My husband has ADHD and can lose anything within seconds of having it - keys, wallet, phone, clothes, etc. I, on the other hand, somehow know where everything is at all times. The only times I really lose anything are when my toddler picks them up and hides them.
• I love showers, but actually washing is too much work most of the time. I mostly just stand in the shower and zone out.
• I have pretty poor spending habits. 
• I have a pretty bad skin picking habit/compulsion. 
• I have a bad habit of dissociating when eating. I tried to focus on the taste/feel in my mouth a few weeks ago and it made me really uneasy/anxious. 
• I can have a bad temper at times. If something isn’t going the way I thought it should go and my plans get ruined, it’s a guarantee that I will lose my shit.
• Lists. I’m good at writing them but not following through. Also, grocery lists… my husband always gives me shit about this. I have to write the list based on how I go through the store and where items are located. Yes, I have the stores memorized. If I forgot to place an item in the right place in the list, I have to start over. I don’t like pencils, and I don’t like the way it looks to scratch something out or make notes off to the side, so I start a new list. 
• I’ve thought about pursuing a masters degree, but I’d rather have a root canal than write a paper. COMP II was a class I failed a couple of times in college. I’m not a bad writer, I just really can’t stay focused on writing for more than 5 minutes before I’d rather be doing literally anything else.

I understand that I could have multiple issues at play, but I just wanted to see if anybody else sees themselves in any of this.",1,1737064949.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

I’m a young, fun, and adventurous guy seeking a Dominant woman who is interested in a Female Led Relationship.

I’m 34, 5’11”, I live an active lifestyle, a bit nerdy, and can be a bit shy when first meeting people.

In my Vanilla life, I have my life together and work a full time job in Tech. On my free time, I love making art, playing video/board games, planning out travel trips, concerts, and hanging out with friends.

In the bdsm world, I’d love to find a dominant to serve. I love the rituals, giving up controls, and focusing entirely on my partner. I enjoy being caged, love bondage, following directions, pegging, body worship, and humiliation. I’m not into findom and am not interested in pro-dommes. I would like to develop a meaningful relationship with a power dynamic involved. I hope to meet a goddess to serve soon!

1i30jqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1i30jqn/does_anyone_else_prepare_their_sos_lunch/,Does anyone else prepare their SO’s lunch?,"
I (26F) have been together with my partner (31M) for 4 years, and we live together.
He works at the office 4 days of the week, and fortunately my work is pretty flexible so I get to work from home 2-3 days a week. A lot of times I prepare dinner for us and I don’t mind because my work is less stressful than his and I always finish work on time. He also doesn’t expect this from me, I just do it because I think it saves us time. 

However, when it comes to food at work (breakkie & lunch), I get a little burned out having to pack his lunch everyday… Now, he DOESN’T expect this from me at all!! He always says I don’t have to every time I start doing it. I don’t mind doing it when I’m preparing myself a lunchbox too, but when I don’t work from office, that’s when sometimes I’d get up and prep his breakkie/lunch when he gets ready.

The thing is, when I don’t pack him anything, most often than not, he won’t pack himself anything. Then, he’d end up eating nothing all day… He’d say “I can buy myself lunch”, but often than not at the end of the day he’d say he didn’t have time to buy any so he’d just live off coffee all day. And somehow, this drives me nuts knowing if he doesn’t have anything all day?! So I can’t help but end up packing his lunchbox anyway (tried so hard not to!)...

Anyone else has experienced this?


TLDR: partner often won’t pack himself food to work, he doesn’t expect me to, but it drives me nuts when he doesn’t eat anything all day so i end up doing it..

1i30jkt,https://www.reddit.com/r/YouKnowMeNowPod/comments/1i30jkt/episode_5_the_sweep/,Episode 5: The Sweep,"[https://www.youknowmenow.com/youknowmenowpod/9pb5d7q1mex0ozyiya6d53kslbh6tt-j77gr-726gm](https://www.youknowmenow.com/youknowmenowpod/9pb5d7q1mex0ozyiya6d53kslbh6tt-j77gr-726gm)

In this episode we’ll be discussing the controversial government policy of sweeps. If you are not familiar with the term, a sweep is the forced disbanding of a homeless encampment on public property. 

 The act of sweeping is typically performed by a combination of police, tow trucks, dumpster trucks, and any other needed government agency to accomplish the task. For example, when parks are involved, often the Parks Department is included. During a sweep all individuals, regardless of their circumstance or condition, along with all of their personal property are removed from the area.   This is fairly straightforward. Government removing people and belongings from locations where laws have made it illegal to reside. 

 Sweeps are often set into motion when individuals in business and residential neighborhoods complain that the laws are not being enforced. In short, homed individuals reach a tipping point and want something done.  This seems reasonable. I think everyone can sympathize with those that have been impacted by a homeless encampment either near their business, out front of their home, or in the park they enjoy. It is clearly unfair that the impact of homelessness should be felt by a few when it is in fact a larger community issue and responsibility. 

 However, sweeps as a solution have not proven to be an answer to, or even a path towards, addressing homelessness. Yes they provide immediate relief to those being impacted, but the issue itself is not being resolved by sweeping, only swept to a new location where another neighborhood is then impacted. There is a plethora of information around homelessness, including sweeps. Most of it comes in the form of collected data around programs, policies, services, resources, and budgets. What gets missed in all the data is the human being being swept. Nobody is measuring increased levels of trauma, or how many steps back are taken in what is already a difficult path to move forward on for those struggling with homelessness. It is accurate to say, sweeps are conducted to benefit the homed, not the homeless. 

***Excerpt from the episode:***  
*On a sunny August day I'm standing with Lilly on a skinny strip of land running north south, about three blocks long and 50 feet wide. To the west is a chain link fence with a wrecking yard and golf driving range behind. To the east is a green belt hillside buffer with a mobile home park above it. We are in north Seattle just off hwy 99. It's dusty and hot.* 

*Lilly is absolutely frantic. The whole scene is chaotic. Our conversation is interrupted nearly every other sentence as Lilly yells out to friends, checking in if they are okay, or asking what they need. People are desperately working on their vehicles trying to get them started. Lilly and I simultaneously move to the back of a car to help push it up onto a trailer as the guy there struggles to keep it from rolling backwards.*

*The police have a heavy presence. I am guessing in total 40, maybe 50 officers. Most of them are just standing and watching the chaos. I am wondering what they are thinking when they see all the upheaval of these lives. I’m assuming it must be difficult for them. Some officers are informing folks to come out of their RVs or tents, letting them know how much time they have left. A few are directing traffic as people use tow ropes to pull out non running vehicles.* 

*Tow trucks with flashing lights are towing derelict cars and RV’s through a narrow dirt road that runs all through this piece of land.* 

*There is a real sense of desperation as people try to salvage what they can of their belongings as the city workers break down the makeshift structures, throwing everything into piles to be put into the back of dump trucks.  A distraught man on a bike with his backpack goes by, undoubtedly containing all his belongings.*   

*Here and there are housed folks who belong to mutual aid groups and nonprofits. Some are talking to campers, bringing them coffee and snacks, and trying to figure out how they can help. I’ve seen this too many times before, knowing there’s not much help to be given other than being there emotionally for those you manage to connect with as the chaos goes on all around.*  

*One of the residents of this camp named Cuba planted a beautiful flower and vegetable garden along the hillside that will be torn up. In the grand scheme of things, it was a small garden, but for this community, it was a bigBIG deal.* 

*I try not to get sucked in emotionally. It’s hard. All these people being uprooted will have a very difficult time in the coming weeks. There is a deep sense of loss, a good many people had created a community, one that provided connection and safety. Now it was being disrupted and dismantled.*

*Coming back from visiting Cuba’s garden I find Lily again. She is leaning against one of the abandoned cars, visibly shaken and upset…*",1,1737064705.0,YouKnowMeNowPod,0,1.0,False

David Lynch was a fundamental force of the universe, a towering iconoclast who bent the entire artform purely with the power of his subconscious. 
I can’t even process reality without him. 
Without Lynch there’s no Twin Peaks, no X-files, obviously no Gravity Falls. 

(My Bill Cipher voice was just a crummy Lynch impression.) 

But he’s so much more than that. 

He wrote little books about Buddhism and did morning weather reports and abducted random abandoned woody woodpecker dolls on the side of the road, calling them his “friends” and then ditching them later because they had “dark energy.” 

When asked to explain his art he calmly replied “no.” Trickster weirdo genius legend.

1.YSL Libre - absolutely loveeeed by anyone around you. Intoxicating,Cozy,feminie BUT DO NOT SPRAY IT ON ANY WHITE CLOTHING🥲 Got way too many compliments for this.
2. MFK BR540- Does this need an introduction? Quite a lot of people are nose blind to it. But i feel once you understand the notes it’s easier to pick it up after spraying.
3. Musc Noir For Her by NR- this mayyy feel a bit masculine but it’s an overall great winter fragrance for women.
4. TF Cafe Rose - Ahh I LOVE THIS ONE. it’s deep,you get the rose quite prominent with hints of the coffee note. Got a lot of compliments for this specially from guys.
5. Gabrielle Chanel- very feminine,soft, white floral …great for summer time or like a day time fragrance.
6.Covet by SJP - this is also a floral fragrance which is quite similar to Burberry London for Her. Not so great lasting power.


I’ve reviewed a few😅😅😅 Let me know if anyone wants views on any of the others.

And I’d love suggestions on what other fragrances i can get 😋",2,1737064333.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,1,1.0,False

I recently had a scenario where a friend stayed at my home and brought their own ground coffee from the store. They didn’t want to fuss with my coffee setup, so I showed them my machine’s ""instant brew"" feature, which is designed to be simple—set it and forget it. I usually keep the water tank full, but they just wanted to make enough coffee for themselves. Without using a scale (as they’re used to doing it their way), they added coffee grounds and noticed the tank was full before hitting the instant brew button.

In situations like this, where the water basin is full, it would be helpful if the machine or app had a simple on/off toggle to control how much water to use with the 'instant brew' option. This would prevent using the entire tank, avoiding overly weak and excessive coffee for that one person.

I will also shoot an email to Fellow.

Thanks for considering :).

I'm surprised my fellow PMs don't have a *“what if I get fired?”* plan. Here 's mine:

1. **Update your resume.** I always have mine updated and review it once a month at minimum. Will share below on why.
2. **Go through ALL your contacts and get help.** Grab your phone and list *everyone* who can help you get a job. Your aunt, your cousin, that guy from the gym you nod at, Joe Shmoe from the golf club, etc. Don’t rule anyone out!
3. **Send them a message and follow up if it sounds promising.** Be chill but clear: “Hey, I’m looking for a role in \[insert your field\]. Let me know if you can help in any way.” Most people want to help and these are people that know you so its easy to reach out to them.
4. **Apply to jobs.** Spend an hour applying to jobs. TRY your best to find the actual decision-makers for the PM role (this is the person you'll be reporting into: most likely a Director, VP, or CIO/CTO). DM them, and pitch why you'll be the best PM they ever work with. Push for a coffee chat (which is basically your interview).
5. **Cert/Upskill.** You have been blessed with time, complete a relevant cert to get distinguished.
6. **Keep Networking.** I keep my resume updated even when I'm 'stable'. I keep applying to jobs and inmail people. Though I may not actually want/need the job, this helps me make a contact and grow my 'step 2' list.

To set expectations... all my PM contracts have been obtained by step 2 and 3. I have **NEVER** gotten a job via an application.

Which segues into my rant...

Recruiters are flexing about how they “only look at resumes for 7 seconds.” Like… what? They give 'tips' on how to stand out in those 7 seconds... we as a society have been degraded to a paper in a job search (...I still follow those tips but begrudgingly). Without a shadow of doubt I know they’re rejecting VERY solid candidates in their ""7 second"" scans. And I also think some job postings aren't even real.

I believe this because I apply to maybe 500/1000 jobs a year for the heck of it (and as a networking ploy). I kidd you not I get maybe 10-15 responses in total through this. The reality is that cold apps rarely work. All my jobs came from warm intros. That’s why steps 2–3 are **everything**.

Disclaimer, I’m not saying be mean to or ghost recruiters. Be nice, make them laugh, and keep it light. But know this: they’re not the decision-makers. Try to bypass them\*.\*

1i308z9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1i308z9/how_i_completely_healed_in_a_year_with_minimal/,How I Completely Healed in a Year With Minimal PPIs ,"Hi all! 

I've seen several posts on here from folks suffering / feeling hopeless and I feel like it may help if I share my journey. I experienced my first few symptoms in Jan. 24 and am currently eating / drinking / whatever I like (Save for capsule coffee but I will never drink that again). Below is my timeline and what helped me to heal. 

**January 2024.** Started feeling terrible stomach cramps and pains in my upper abdomen. It was like nothing I'd ever felt before and I Googled my way into thinking I had an ulcer, especially because I would feel the most pain after eating something.  Ultimately, I went to urgent care (I work in film and was on an assignment out of my normal town) and they gave me a prescription for PPIs and suggested I may have gastritis. I got the PPIs and started taking them immediately, only to get the WORST headaches of my entire life. So I stopped taking them pretty immediately. I also made an appointment with a GI, but couldn't see him until Feb.

**Feb.**  I found this subreddit and started learning about Gastritis. Omitted coffee, alcohol, and spicy goods from my diet. I tried to eat as bland as possible but it was really hard because I was working on a movie in a new city. I ate a lot of Cheerios, acai bowls, sweet potatoes, and bone broth but still occasionally ate out and tried my best to avoid foods that weren't on the Gastritis Healing List (I used the book) but it was almost impossible. I saw a GI and he made me an appointment with my Endo.

**March.** Finally had an endoscopy which confirmed gastritis and GERD. I was given carafate, a different PPI, and famotidine. I ended up trying the PPIs again and this time I didn't have as many side effects and they did mask the symptoms. I should also note I was already on Lexapro and had a Xanax prescription for OCD / depression. I would take the Xanax when I had terrible flare-ups and it helped immensely. (My gastritis was acute caused by NSAIDS, fyi!)

**March - May.** I was still working on set for the movie which made it very hard to stick to the strict Gastritis Healing Diet. My headaches from the PPIs came back so I tried to ditch them again — and it was like I was totally sick again. This was probably when I was most hopeless. I could barely eat anything, especially now that I wasn't on PPIs. I'm convinced they just masked the symptoms without allowing any true healing, but that's just my experience. 

**May - August. I** came from working on the movie and decided I would 100% commit to The Gastritis Healing diet (again, this is in the book).  I never cheated. I gave up sugar, gluten, and dairy. The only thing I didn't give up completely was caffeine—I had one hot matcha latte per day. My doctor said this was okay so long as I had it with oat milk, something to coat my stomach. Other than this, I was SO strict. I was still taking lexapro, famotidine, and carafate.

**July/August -** Around here, my symptoms all started to disappear. I went months without a flare-up but still kept strict to the diet. Again, save for matcha lattes (my one vice), I did not cheat.

**September -** I did 90+ days on the super strict diet, so I began introducing new foods. At the end of September, I went to Greece. By this point, the only foods I was still avoiding were coffee and alcohol, and even in Greece I managed to have a daily glass of wine SO LONG as it was on a full stomach. I was also eating a ton of olive and bread, which I think helped coat my tummy.

**October - Today.** When I came back from Greece, I was pretty confident I could have whatever I wanted. Now I drink iced coffee, have the occasional drink, and eat whatever I want (save for spicy foods!) My diet is not 100% what it used to be, but it's healthier and I don't really miss getting drunk and was never a huge fan of spice, so it works out for me :)

**Other things that helped:** I posted on social media about gastritis and two of my friends came forward. and say had dealt with it at one point. It was really nice having people I was close to share their wisdom. 

Slippery Elm powder! OMG. I mixed this with hot water so it formed like a jelly and added honey or maple syrup lol and had it an hour before lunch every day. It made my tummy feel so good. 

Bananas! Some people can't tolerate them but I started every day with one. It coated my tummy and felt like it set up for success. 

Rice + olive oil or ghee + liquid aminos. yum, yum. yum. coated my tummy and tasted so good. I could also add veggies when I was feeling better for nourishment.

**TLDR:** *DIET IS EVERYTHING!!!!* It sucks, but once you do a month of the diet, it gets so much easier. I found recipes and meals that worked with my diet and made the process less awful. 

Today, I had a chocolate protein shake and iced coffee w/ oat milk for breakfast and chicken tortilla soup for lunch. This past weekend, I had pizza and canned mocktails. Over the holidays, I had dirty martinis and french fries. This still shocks me because I was so sick for so long and never thought I would get better. But I did. And if I did, so can you :)

**Where/how do we think Nintendo is going to expect people to actually engage with that sensor?**

**-----**

Sure, tabletop mode would work...at a desk or table...but the vast majority of people play either Docked or handheld and I am sure Nintendo knows this....and if that is the case **...**

**Where do ya put the mouse to actually use it in Docked Mode then...?**

Plenty of people have a coffee table, or maybe a TV dinner tray to use...but many certainly don't.

Would they ship every console with a little board intended for lap usage? Or something quirky where the outside of the Switch 2 Box is built for a similar purpose? Maybe Mario Paint DX, or whatever, would ship with a mouse pad of some sort?

If there is no good solution...does this mean Mouse mode is doomed to have a similar fate to the IR camera? A cool idea, used for a neat handful of experiences, but ultimately underused?",3,1737063795.0,NintendoSwitch2,8,0.67,False

Lately, in the last year or so, my husband's oral hygiene has gotten really, really terrible. His overall hygiene has never been excellent, but it's really gotten unbearable. He doesn't brush his teeth every day, doesn't floss or use mouthwash etc...and getting him to go to the dentist is almost impossible. I finally got him to go to the dentist this morning because he had pain, and now we find out he needs $1600 worth of dental work. 

I'm Autistic with OCD (clinically diagnosed) and moderate sensory issues. I'm super sensitive to smells and tastes. My oral and overall hygiene are excellent; I've always taken care of myself in that regard. My husband is upset because I don't want to kiss him, especially intimately. His breath is awful, his teeth are yellow from drinking tons of soda and coffee and now he's got a gum infection. 

He tells me that marriage isn't about looking or smelling good, but to me, that's part of it. I always make the effort to look and smell my best for him, but due to my sensory issues, I can't kiss him with everything going on. He is now accusing me of being shallow and not loving him. I do love him more than anything..I just can't handle his lack of personal cleanliness.

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection, something close to a relationship. I’d like to find someone I can confide in, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older. Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I am single, and would prefer that you are as well. I’m not looking to change my situation at this time, but do crave a relationship-like connection. I’m not interested in anything solely or immediately nsfw in nature, I prefer to know a person quite well before that. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/zUFNfnA)

That’s just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages.

When this novel was announced it was met with skepticism here, but personally I enjoy Thorpe more than the average person here it seems so I was looking forward to this. Also I think Thorpe has a few excellent novels recently like Luther and Lorgar books and a few other decent things and his worst novels were at the start of the career so I was somewhat hyped for this book.  

And I am happy to say I really enjoyed this book and think it is pretty good and I finished it very quickly. It has very little bolter porn which is Thorpes weakness and instead focuses on world building and giving readers lots and lots of insight into the faction which is precisely what you want from the first novel for the faction. And it is delivered quite well through dialogue and the story instead of feeling like huge exposition segments. The main plot is also decent and so are the characters except one smaller plot thread and the character that it focuses on.   

 

Spoilers: 

 

>!The novel begins with the last stand of the High Kalh Orthanar of The Eternal Starforge Kindred against the Orks without much context. As he is about to be defeated he gives his champion Ironhelm a ring and his Oath and tells him to run to their main base ship which they call “holds”.!< 

>!Next we are introduced to our main character Myrtun Dammergot who is a leader of her prospect (which is an expedition sent from the main hold to get stuff) and her crew of which include her navigator of sorts which is Lutar an Iron Kin (robot clone and her kinda boyfriend) and Jordiki which is a grimnyr (psyker) that uses eCOGS which are drones of sorts that serve in the LoV for various menial tasks. She is busy boarding an almost defeated Tyranid ship to salvage it. We get a surprising amount of lore how the ships function and their parts – probably the most in any 40k novel. This takes a chapter or two and it pretty bolter porn heavy (LoV use bolters, plasma guns, plasma close combat weapons and rockets) and she meets up with the emissary from the hold ship telling her Orthanar is dead and she is to return to the main ship to be High Kahl.!< 

>!The next chapters goal was to describe various relations in that area of space. As Myrtun is going home a Chaos ship (which they called The Cursed Ones) attacks an Imperium ship. Myrtun operates in a sort of neutral zone where LoV and The Imperium coexist and they are allies, but the relationship is pretty cold. After they help they invite The Imperials onboard and it does not go well because of the various cultural differences they depart, but without any bloodshed showing they still care about the alliance.!< 
 

>!Myrtun arrives at the hold ship where we get a lot of lore about Kin being created clones, their customs like drinking Bru which is a sci-fi coffee, caring about punctionality, tradition, profit, sense of kinship and how a lot of their society is guided by the Vottan which are these ancient AI that communicate with starships using “fanes” which are warp based technology for getting cryptic advice from the Vottan. Myrtun becomes new High Kahl and her first duty is to meet petitioners asking to meet her.!<  

>!The first one is Leki who is an old diseased looking Kin that has to use an exoskeleton to move normally and he is a member of some sub-faction which is kinda like the AdMech and they maintain some of the tech on the hold ship (mainly the shields). This plot story is a bit weak imho as it creates conflict just by Leki not getting to talk with Myrtun and I think all the problems could be fixed by a 5 minute conversation and it feels forced. As he is about to start talking with Myrtun the champion Ironhelm arrives, interrupting Leki causing him to be angry and tells his story how Orthanar went to some area of space with heavy warp storms after a personal message from the Votann in search of something unexplained. Myrtun is presented with the option to follow which she wants to do because despite being a wise old Kin she still wants to be an adventurer, but it is a risk because the Kindred could lose another Kahl again. She is conflicted, but she is swayed by her advisors telling her how the Votann surely picked her because they wanted an adventurer Kahl.!< 

>!After traveling through the story they find an hold on the surface where Orthanar died and decide to go deeper. They find an active fane in it which reacts to Orthanars ring he gave to Ironhelm. The ring apparently gave psychic imprints to Ironhelm and guided him through the storm. Meanwhile the main hold ship is attacked by Chaos and the fight is looking bad for the Kin because they dont have the shields. Leki cant turn them on as he needs codes for it which he does not have because Orthanar/Myrtun owe his faction because his subfaction gave the ring which guided Orthanar through the storm to that hidden planet in the warp storm with Orks.!< 


>!The fane Myrtun discovered after being connected with the ring reveals it is very ancient tech from when Kin left Terra leading to an ancient Votann and that was the quest Orthanar was on. The ring is a mythical artefact that can serve as a fane itself and can be used anywhere instead of requiring a whole temple building for it. There is some bolter porn as Myrtun and her friends flee the Orks. Lutar appears to be killed, but his core is actually undamaged and he is crafted a new body. Leki manages to turn the shields on and the hold ship is defended as The Imperium guys from before answer their call for help.!<",8,1737063184.0,40kLore,2,0.9,False

After i had an endoscopy and the bravo 48 hour monitoring in November, i was sent to get an esophageal manometry and 24 hour ph test today. Idk why we were doing the ph monitoring since i did the bravo already (they said it’s more detailed but whatever). I was hoping it would be easy but it was awful for me. I have a weak gag reflex and throw up very easily. I threw up when they started showing me the tube at the thought of it, and then as they started putting the tube down
My throat i kept throwing up. I had a hard time holding off swallowing as well. I was able to complete it after about 40 mins. Next was the ph probe. Not nearly as bad to get it inserted but i was instantly so uncomfortable. After i left the hospital i went to Starbucks to get some breakfast and coffee to try and trigger symptoms and within 2 mins of eating solid food i threw up everything including the probe which i ripped out. I went back to hospital and returned it. I wasn’t able to get in touch with my doc but her PA said to not have them put it back in for now and that she’d let me know if the doc really needed it. I also got sick on the way home without the device in and threw up what was left in my stomach merely from the sensation i still felt in
My throat. 

I am so upset i couldn’t do the test. I didn’t even last an hour with the probe in. Everytime i turned my head my eyes watered and i sneezed or gagged with it in. Has this happened to literally anyone else or is something wrong w my gag relax too lol?

This will be a slow wander, with Poorman offering crafted invitations to engage the senses; the walk will include moments of sharing and reflection, and will end with a tea ceremony.
This is not a hike, but a slow meander through Goodwood's natural garden and forest-scape.

It is inspired by Shinrin-yoku, the Japanese practice of “Forest Bathing.” Please prepare and dress for the weather. Bring a bottle of water and snack as needed. Perhaps bring a small blanket or scarf to use to sit on the ground. Please wear footwear suitable for walking outside. This is a rain-or-shine event, as long as there is no lightning or severe weather; if the weather is forecasted to be wet, please dress as needed.* 10am/$30

Hi there! I’m Danny, a 30-year-old marketing professional who’s equal parts creative, curious, and driven. I’m here looking for someone special to share life’s little joys, big adventures, and everything in between. If you enjoy witty banter, meaningful conversations, and laughing until your cheeks hurt, we might just click.

What It’s Like Dating Me
	•	The Fun Factor: Whether it’s spontaneous day trips, movie marathons, or a hilariously intense board game night, I’ll keep life interesting.
	•	Master of Chill Plans: Cozy evenings with good food and even better company are my specialty.
	•	Storytime Pro: My life has been full of amusing, absurd, and downright ridiculous moments—I can’t wait to share them.
	•	Life’s Little Perks: Whether it’s discovering hidden gems, unexpected surprises, or just knowing the best restaurants, being with me means life feels a bit brighter.
	•	Your Steady Companion: I’m calm under pressure, dependable, and will always have your back (or your favorite snack).

A Bit About Me
I’m a blend of creativity and curiosity, with a knack for finding beauty in the ordinary. I’m happiest when I’m exploring a new city, diving into an engrossing book, or losing track of time in a great conversation.

Travel is a huge part of my life—I’ve visited Canada, the USA, Colombia, the Bahamas, and Mexico, and my wanderlust isn’t slowing down. Bonus: I speak Spanish, so we can plan trips to some incredible destinations!

When I’m not traveling, I’m immersing myself in art, music, and storytelling. Whether it’s swapping favorite songs, checking out an art gallery, or discussing life’s big questions over coffee, I’m all about connecting on a deeper level.

What I’m Looking For
I’m open to connecting with women from all walks of life—what matters most is that we bring out the best in each other. Here’s what I value:
	•	Laughter and Fun: A great sense of humor and a willingness to laugh at life’s quirks.
	•	Kind and Open-Minded: Someone who’s genuine, grounded, and ready to embrace new experiences.
	•	Emotionally Intelligent: Communication, empathy, and loyalty are the foundation of meaningful connections.
	•	A Little Playful: Life’s too short to take too seriously—let’s have some fun!

Why You Should Message Me
If you’re looking for someone who sees life as an adventure, values deep connections, and brings positivity to every moment, I might just be your guy. I’ll keep you laughing, surprise you with thoughtful gestures, and make even the mundane feel special.

Whether we’re discovering a new favorite spot, enjoying a lazy Sunday morning, or plotting a spontaneous getaway, I’m all in for making memories together.

Let’s Make Memories
I believe the best relationships are built on shared experiences, meaningful conversations, and a lot of laughter. Whether it’s exploring quirky art exhibits, hitting the road for a last-minute trip, or cozying up for a movie night, I’m looking for someone who’s as excited about the journey as I am.

Final Thoughts
Distance doesn’t scare me if we vibe—it’s all about building something meaningful. If you’re in your twenties or beyond, adventurous, grounded, and ready for something real, let’s chat. Tell me your favorite story, dream destination, or the last thing that made you laugh—I’d love to hear it.

Life’s too short for “what ifs”—let’s start something amazing.

This version aims to be warm, confident, and engaging, while highlighting your strengths and inviting connection. Let me know what you think!",0,1737062773.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.5,False
1i2ztbw,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1i2ztbw/my_collection_as_a_16_year_old/,My collection as a 16 year old! ,"Swedoft - Endless Happiness: 
This is a lovely gourmand vanilla, and cacao scent. Notes of tobacco and coffee are listed but not very noticeable. Just received this today so don't have much information on performance etc. Couldn't recommend more, the attention to detail in the packaging etc is crazy. Amazingly blended perfume.   I have only received this today, but i had a sample of it before and have tried it in store many times so i am familiar with the scent. 
£110 for 100ml at bloom perfumery 9.5/10 

Molinard - Vanille:
This is a very linear vanilla scent, but that doesn't mean bad. Has a slightly woody base, nothing more to it than that. Very realistic gourmand. £65 for 70ml at bloom perfumery. 7.5/10

Maison Margiela - Jazz club:
The first fragrance that sparked my interest for perfumery as an art, rather than to impress people. This has been reviewed many times, and some may say 'overrated' but i disagree. This is an incredible boozy scent, and i can't see myself not having a bottle of this in my collection anytime soon. I don't pick up on the tobacco notes so much, which is a shame because i'm a big fan of tobacco in perfume. 
£100 for 100ml 8.5/10

Bon Parfumeur - 802 pivione lotus bamboo:
As i've read in other people's reviews, this is a mix between an aquatic blue fragrance and a floral green fragrance , or a 'turquoise' fragrance. This is a very refreshing green watery fragrance, i received it today so i can't exactly tell you my experience with it. This was a blind buy, and i'm very happy with it. £40 at bloom perfumery at the moment for 100ml
8/10 

Issey Miyake - Leau d'issey pour homme sport 
This is a very citrus heavy fragrance with a slight spice to it and some wood notes at the heart. This is a very nice freshie which doesn't follow the same lines that most brands go down. This was the 2nd bottle in my collection, i believe i purchased it at Knock airport on the way back from visiting my family in the west coast of Ireland. £25 for 50 ml at the airport 6.5/10

I have other bottles in my collection (dior sauvage edt, montblanc legend spirit and prada luna rossa ocean) but i figured that they have been reviewed allot. I also have samples of Zoologist's hummingbird, elephant and penguin, Parfum prissana's mohagrot, Imaginary Author's a whiff of waffle cone, eight and bob's annicke 4 and nuit de mageve, franchesca bianchi's the black knight, pierre de valay's chou chou and floraiku's one umbrella for two. 

This is my first proper post so if you would like an in-depth review of any of the fragrances mentioned, or any of the samples then just let me know. Hopefully i will start posting more, depending on how this post goes. ",1,1737062749.0,fragrance,1,0.6,False

1i2zsah,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1i2zsah/an_ex_coworker_35f_keeps_talking_to_my_husband/,An ex coworker (35f) keeps talking to my husband (43m) even after I told her to fuck off. ,"2.5 years ago this woman (35f) started working with my husband (43m) of 13 years. I'll call her Jill and my husband John.
He kind of took her under his wing and they worked closely together. She was married with kids and I trust my husband, so it was a non-issue. After about working together for several months she invited him to go kayaking with her. He and I both bought kayaks and started kayaking with her every weekend, which we did throughout the summer and into fall. Her and I spent a good amount of time chatting while kayaking and became friends. We hung out with her family fairly often. Between her and my husband I found out her husband (I'll call him Jack) seemed jealous and controlling. I told him it wouldn't be long before Jack banned Jill from being friends with him.

John found a new job that fall, and less than a week later John told me that Jill wasn't allowed to talk to him anymore. My heart went out to Jill. Clearly she was being manipulated and controlled. I told John he could offer her and her kid a place to sleep at our place if she needed it. 
A year ago John said he and Jill were going to go for coffee. I voiced my concern about Jack's reaction to that, but he said Jack didn't know. This didn't sit quite right with me, but given the situation, I could understand. Jack came back from coffee and broke down weeping, saying he lost his friend. She was cutting ties with him. I was sad for John, but assumed that was the end of it. 

We continued on with our lives. A month or two later I was paying our phone bills and I noticed one number he was texting and calling multiple times every day, all hours of the day and on weekends. Giving him the benefit of the doubt I asked if it was someone from work. He was genuinely unsure for a while before a lightbulb went off and he said it was Jill. My stomach sank, I said I thought they weren't talking any more? He downplayed it, simply saying they started talking again. I told him he had broken my trust and needed to rebuild it. Once again, I assumed it was all over and done with. 

Late spring I was driving to work around midday, my route took me past his workplace and I saw him walking down the sidewalk with Jill! I was furious. I turned around to confront them. She left and he came to sit in my car and just sat there while I told him how he had broken the trust again and that I was absolutely not okay with his secrecy about his contact with her. I made it clear under no uncertain terms that he was to stop talking to her. I blocked her number on his phone. I sent her a message telling her I was not okay with their relationship and that she needed to sort out her own family situation and leave John alone. I was fuming but tried to be clear and concise, and told her to fuck off. She didn't respond for a few hours, but when she did, she mentioned her and Jack were separated, that she felt bad about the deceit, and she was sorry. 

In the following week John told me he had found his own place, that he needed some space to think. For context, he had been going to therapy for a few months after Jill cut contact the first time and he learned that he had unresolved trauma from childhood and it was a heavy weight he was carrying. So him needing space to heal made sense to me. I figured he'd take the time to heal and come back a stronger person. He only went there for weekends, weeknights he slept at home still. It was basically a cabin rental and it was beautiful, he brought me there several times and we'd spend the evening around the fire. 

Things cooled down, he shared a bit of what was going on with therapy, but he's never been very forthcoming so his hesitation to share was not new. At first the cabin felt like a positive change, but it wasn't long before he became very depressed. I was supportive, but unsure of what to do. Work was a huge strain and his family trauma was a huge strain. I was pretty sure he was suicidal and I was concerned for him. I still wasn't feeling good about the whole situation with Jill, but I didn't want to add more pressure to him when he was already struggling so hard. I figured we'd work on that once he'd sorted through other things and wasn't so depressed. 

Last week, 8 months after I saw them together on my way to work, we were sitting at home watching tv and his phone rang. I looked over and it was Jill. I lost it. Why was she calling?! I don't even remember the things I said, just how I felt. I was ready for a fight. She needed to back the fuck off and leave my husband alone. He didn't have anything to say about it. We ended up getting distracted by a small, unrelated emergency and spent the rest of the evening dealing with that.

Hi there! I’m Danny, a 30-year-old marketing professional who’s equal parts creative, curious, and driven. I’m here looking for someone special to share life’s little joys, big adventures, and everything in between. If you enjoy witty banter, meaningful conversations, and laughing until your cheeks hurt, we might just click.

What It’s Like Dating Me
	•	The Fun Factor: Whether it’s spontaneous day trips, movie marathons, or a hilariously intense board game night, I’ll keep life interesting.
	•	Master of Chill Plans: Cozy evenings with good food and even better company are my specialty.
	•	Storytime Pro: My life has been full of amusing, absurd, and downright ridiculous moments—I can’t wait to share them.
	•	Life’s Little Perks: Whether it’s discovering hidden gems, unexpected surprises, or just knowing the best restaurants, being with me means life feels a bit brighter.
	•	Your Steady Companion: I’m calm under pressure, dependable, and will always have your back (or your favorite snack).

A Bit About Me
I’m a blend of creativity and curiosity, with a knack for finding beauty in the ordinary. I’m happiest when I’m exploring a new city, diving into an engrossing book, or losing track of time in a great conversation.

Travel is a huge part of my life—I’ve visited Canada, the USA, Colombia, the Bahamas, and Mexico, and my wanderlust isn’t slowing down. Bonus: I speak Spanish, so we can plan trips to some incredible destinations!

When I’m not traveling, I’m immersing myself in art, music, and storytelling. Whether it’s swapping favorite songs, checking out an art gallery, or discussing life’s big questions over coffee, I’m all about connecting on a deeper level.

What I’m Looking For
I’m open to connecting with women from all walks of life—what matters most is that we bring out the best in each other. Here’s what I value:
	•	Laughter and Fun: A great sense of humor and a willingness to laugh at life’s quirks.
	•	Kind and Open-Minded: Someone who’s genuine, grounded, and ready to embrace new experiences.
	•	Emotionally Intelligent: Communication, empathy, and loyalty are the foundation of meaningful connections.
	•	A Little Playful: Life’s too short to take too seriously—let’s have some fun!

Why You Should Message Me
If you’re looking for someone who sees life as an adventure, values deep connections, and brings positivity to every moment, I might just be your guy. I’ll keep you laughing, surprise you with thoughtful gestures, and make even the mundane feel special.

Whether we’re discovering a new favorite spot, enjoying a lazy Sunday morning, or plotting a spontaneous getaway, I’m all in for making memories together.

Let’s Make Memories
I believe the best relationships are built on shared experiences, meaningful conversations, and a lot of laughter. Whether it’s exploring quirky art exhibits, hitting the road for a last-minute trip, or cozying up for a movie night, I’m looking for someone who’s as excited about the journey as I am.

Final Thoughts
Distance doesn’t scare me if we vibe—it’s all about building something meaningful. If you’re in your twenties or beyond, adventurous, grounded, and ready for something real, let’s chat. Tell me your favorite story, dream destination, or the last thing that made you laugh—I’d love to hear it.

Life’s too short for “what ifs”—let’s start something amazing.

I'm not a candle maker, so I hope it's okay to ask this here, but I've been trying and failing to find information about whether dried herbs or other plants can be used to scent wax melts. If so, what's the best way to incorporate them?

I use an electric wax warmer in my small room, and I usually mix up very small batches of melts using soy wax mixed with either dry coffee grounds or dry tea leaves, and both work well to scent the small space for a pretty decent length of time (many hours broken up over a few days). I was trying to find information about dried herbs or flowers, but I either find pages about using them as decoration or posts from people asking if they can use them in regular candles. I can only really find information about them being safe in wax melts, but nothing really on their effectiveness. Does anyone use dried stuff to scent wax?

I met a lot of cool people, many of which from all different places in the world. I got friendly w all my classmates and one of them (21M)  confessed to having a crush on one of our classmates (22F). He, we'll call him Casper, was asking for advice, since he knew i was pretty succesful on the apps because we'd often smoke a joint before i had something planned. 
In the previous weeks i had also gotten more friendly with the girl, we'll call her Beatrice, and so i thought i could help set them up.
I told Casper to send her a message to go out for a coffee. For a few times when i saw casper again I asked him how it was going abd he always responded with ""eh I haven't texted her yet"".
Some time later me and Casper went iceskating, after which we were having a coffee. We were talking about his crush for a bit and i told him to text her right now.
My guy went into the class groupchat and asked if ""anyone would like to join us"".
Beatrice responded she might, but after i texted in the groupchat that i would only be available until 17:00, cause i had other plans after (;  but that she could hang out with Casper (thats me trying to set them up yo) she kindly declined.
Over the next few weeks me and Beatrice grew closer, to a point where a lot of people in our year thought we were dating (we were actually swiping together on the apps, very fun, would recommend) eventually the two of us were hanging out with another mutual friend if ours and i bludly asked if she was into Casper and she seemed surprised by the question and said she wasn't.
We hung out a vit more, and the while school was convinced we were dating (we weren't, just casual filmnights). At a school party another girl came up to Beatrice and asked her is she could speak to her in the bathroom.
Beatrice seemed confused but we t along with her. When they came back Beatrice tild me the ither girl had heard that Beatrice and Casper were dating. Eventually he started spreading rumours that i was dangerous and abusive to her and started sending reaaally long messages and voice notes to Beatrice.

Edit: After a few more days i asked her out and we started dating, we have been for the past year or so.

We both have graduate/professional degrees with relatively high-paying jobs, but we have decided on a very limited ceremony at destination with fewer than a dozen people attending and the option for those who wish to watch to stream it live. We agree that a huge ordeal would be very stressful and expensive and that the money would be put to better use financing a house, paying off education debts, and saving for the future. 

But the commentary from the boomers has been relentless and downright rude. Both of our families have large spheres of people (many in that age bracket) who would expect an invitation. Using terms like “shotgun wedding” and “your elopement” doesn’t come off as cute as they think. They’re expecting a full on weekend of meals and open bars. 

These are the very first people to scoff at entitled young folks for spending money irresponsibly – what exemplifies that better than a professionally planned/serviced party for hundreds of people?? We’re mostly talking about the type who live in a financial/cultural bubble where the reason millennials don’t own homes is because they spend all their money on avocado toast and iced coffee. Everything is laziness and entitlement, except putting on a massive wedding. 

We’ve asked for no gifts or favors. I do realize the outrage created by the use of a link on the computer for those who wish to stream. But why do we take the heat for living in the economy they created while simultaneously being out of line for prioritizing a down payment on a house over a fancy party?

I had a Nissen Fundoplication in December of 2023, along with a sliding hiatal hernia repair. I also have Barrett's esophagus from 33-39cm. 

I was told that the NF is the gold standard for exactly my scenario, and that I could go back to a normal diet. 

For the first couple of months, I had some pretty intense nausea and anxiety, along with some vagus nerve irritation. I was told it would get better with diet and exercise. 

I started walking every day a month after my surgery, increasing my distance as I got stronger. 

I started biking. I can now ride 40 miles through a decently varied terrain without stopping. 

I had stopped drinking years before. I gave up nicotine a year before. 

I dropped 40 fucking pounds so that the insurance company would pay for the surgery and ive since kept most of it off. 

I stopped eating all fast food, ate more salads, avoided as many triggers as possible. Im eating more fiber and whole foods than I ever have in my life. I try to stick to low FODMAP foods as best I can. 

I just gave up coffee and chocolate a month ago. 

So why are my symptoms worse than ever?! Granted, it's no longer in my throat but now all confined to my stomach and intestines. 

I'm now back on omeprazole (again) and famotidine, which is new to me. The pain still exists.

I feel more restricted than ever! I feel lied to by my doctors and not listened to when I express these symptoms.

This keyboard is the black Raise 2 with wireless and tenting. The setup out of the box was easy and went well. By the tips that I read beforehand, I had no trouble with the software update. I made sure the switches underneath were turned off, used the short cables from the neuron to the sides, and the next longer one directly to the computer, and it went off quickly without a hiccup.

**The Community:** The community on Discord and Reddit has been very helpful in my journey to buying and using this keyboard. Dominique and Dygman’s videos and blogs helped answer the questions I previously had. Love the videos! The content is good and covers great topics.

After taking a 3-year break from daily computer work and I saw I was going to be getting back into daily computer work, I began searching and planning for a much better setup this time. I had learned that computer shortcuts are key for doing fast computer work so this led me to think about getting a programmable keyboard.

**Setup:** As per the attached picture, I went with a standing desk, BenQ 32” monitors that raised up and are easy on the eyes, (monitor arms coming sometime I hope), vertical mouse, and the Raise 2 split keyboard. It has all made quite a difference and been worth the money! I enjoy working on this setup each day. The keyboard has been the last thing to arrive and it’s been the best part, next to the heated coffee mug warmer I received for Christmas!

After a lot of searching, reading all the comments about different keyboards, and seeing the different designs, I’m very happy that I choose to go with the Raise 2 with tenting and wireless. I ordered clear back in April as soon as the preorders opened up so it’s been a long wait but worth it.

**Experience:** I’ve used the keyboard both wired and wireless but I like it wireless because I can easily move the sides around quite a bit depending on what I’m doing and which monitor I’m really working on. I don’t have trouble with them moving under my hands when typing and they are rock solid. I didn’t think I would want the mouse in the middle but after experimenting with it, it does work better overall since most of the time, I have my left hand on the keyboard and my right hand on the mouse. I can push the right keyboard farther out and just reach for it a bit when I need it.

**Adjustment:** Learning to type on the split keyboard has not been difficult at all! On a normal day, regular keyboard, I can type around 55 to 60 wpm. I’ve touch typed for years without looking and I’m comfortable with it. Now with the split keyboard, it hasn’t been much adjustment at all. I think after 2 days, it felt normal to type with my hands way apart and have had no problem typing on it. I just checked my typing speed again and it is right back where it was before. I’d say that overall, for just standard typing, it really wasn’t an adjustment.

The adjustment comes with programing the keys. This is where reading Discord and Reddit has been very helpful before getting the keyboard. I saw how Dygmates recommended not changing too many keys too fast. This helped me to just start using it and add keys as I need them. I draw house plans for a living now. When I decided to do this, I knew then already that I needed to have the number pad under my left hand for dimensions and my right hand on the mouse for the tools. I created a layer specifically for number entry and design work. That has worked very well! I’m not finished yet and still have some times I’m hunting for things but it has already improved greatly in 2 weeks.

Yesterday was the first day that I did some heavier Excel work on this keyboard. It didn’t go real smooth and my current layers are not set-up well for that. I’ll have to maybe create a new layer for that or tweak the one I have now.

**Details:**

For anyone that is trying to decide what keyboard to go with or what features to get, here is my short-term experience. The keyboard is a Raise 2, wireless, tenting, Kailh silent brown switches, along with extra white keycaps, black palm pads, and silent pink switches. I’m happy with all of it.

**Battery:** The battery life has been fine with the LEDs at 45% power, and only one for 1 minute for before turning off. True deep sleep kicks in after 10 minutes. I have the best luck waking both sides up by hitting the left ESC key and right number 7 key. With these settings, I’m getting 3 to 5 days out of the battery. I’ve only used it wirelessly via RF, not Bluetooth.

The only slight trouble comes when I need to charge because I have the sides so far apart the short cables both don’t reach to the Neuron. However, I just charge at night and move them closer together. No big deal. The cables are really nice and just wish the short cables were a little longer.

**Palm Pads/ Tenting:** The palm pads are the right amount of soft and very comfortable. I’m using the tenting at 10 to 15 degrees so far and it’s very comfortable. The greatest comfort comes from having them wide apart although the tenting only adds to the comfort.

**No Underglow:** I decided I didn’t need underglow and I haven’t missed it. It does add to the looks. For purely function and work, I can tell which layer I’m on by the color on the keys or by typing. I also use the setting in Bazecor to Highlight Layer Changing and that is a nice feature also.

**Switches:** I choose the Kailh silent brown switches and got the silent pinks as extras. I see now what people mean when they say that the Kailh silent browns are a bit scratchy. After pushing on the different switches in the Enhancement Kit, I wish I had tried the Gateron G Pro 2.0 Yellow switches. They feel really smooth and silent.

**Final thoughts:** If you are on the fence about spending this much money on a keyboard, there are 2 main factors in my mind that pay off. The first is that it is much more comfortable to type on without pain or getting to that point. With them split way apart, I can sit straight up in my chair, or while standing, and my shoulders can be back. It doesn’t require reaching forward and bunching up in front to type. It will save the cost of doctor bills in the future. Pay it forward.

Secondly, if time is money to you, this keyboard will pay for itself before long. It makes work much faster and easier to be able to move keys and shortcuts where you need them. With being able to have the left side in a comfortable place, I can more easily leave my hand on the keyboard for longer periods of time for quick access to keys and shortcuts while designing. I also can have the number pad under my left hand without having another separate number pad on my desk.

Thanks again to Dygma for this fantastic keyboard.

1i2zbdp,https://www.reddit.com/r/GestationalDiabetes/comments/1i2zbdp/feelings_around_testing_and_diagnosis/,Feelings around testing and diagnosis,"I've been reflecting on my experience with GDM and want to offer up my story, especially for those struggling with their diagnosis. It's a bit long, but I hope it can be a helpful perspective. 

I barely ""failed"" the one hour test. My OBGYN said it didn't matter if I fasted or not, and I don't get up early, so I was probably on a good 14+ hour fast. Numbers were only slightly out of range and I begrudgingly went in for the 3 hour. 

Again, BARELY failed (also is there a better word than failed to use?). 1 and 2 hours came back fine, only slightly out of range at 3 hours. I had SO. MANY. EMOTIONS. Fear for my baby. Shame bc of my high BMI (more on this below). Anger that no one warned me about the long-term risks of Type 2. And overwhelming dread at the thought of the dietary restrictions I'd need to implement. 

I have a history of disordered eating, and have worked so hard for years to get to a place of body acceptance and not dieting. I also have very severe IBS. I've had to go through so much trial and error to figure out what I can eat without flaring my symptoms, and now I'd need to cut down that list even further. Being in a constant feedback loop of eating/testing was suffocating. I hated having to eat so frequently. 

My nutritionist and psychiatrist were so valuable in helping me to process. My nutritionist validated that it's the placenta that causes the GDM, and that people of all sizes get it. She shared a story of a fellow nutritionist/dietician who is very fit and how she spiralled after being diagnosed, despite counseling so many of her clients that there is nothing to be ashamed of. She also encouraged me to focus on balancing carbs/fat/protein vs focusing on restricting. I held onto my psychiatrist's framing - this is data that indicates that something may happen down the line, and gives us a heads up to be able to monitor for that possibility. 

Started balancing my meals and tracking my glucose and my numbers were phenomenal. I used general targets for carbs per meal, but did not monitor daily carb intake. I grew increasingly resentful - I was convinced that the tests were wrong and that I didn't have it. That is, until my waking numbers started creeping up (around 34 weeks iirc). Just barely out of range, but they weren't responding to any dietary changes I was making. I was embarrassed to report the data to my endocrinologist, feeling like a failure. 

She gave me the choice of whether or not to start insulin. I really really didn't want to be induced, so that was a big factor when deciding. But I had to go into the hospital for some bad stomach cramps, and talked to my OBGYN who was very kind and direct - she guided me to think of the tradeoff between my glucose going low/concerns about induction vs the risk of stillbirth. That sealed it for me. 

I started insulin and it really wasn't bad (it truly hurts way less than the finger pricks). I only ended up at 7 units (minimum dosage 5), so again, right on that border. But I was confident that I was doing what was best for my baby, and gave myself time to truly accept that this was real, that I did have it, and that all of my feelings were valid. 

I went in to get my induction time at 38+6, and the doctor ordered another ultrasound since my 37 week showed her measuring big. They estimated she'd be 9lb 6 oz, and again I had a decision to make. At 10lbs they'd require a scheduled C-section, but it was up to me. For many reasons (happy to discuss more if anyone is curious), I decided to go with the scheduled C-section at 39+1. 

I was sooooo anxious, but honestly relieved that I wouldn't have to deal with pitocin or the challenge of laboring and then having a C-section like so many of my friends had. It couldn't have gone better. My favorite anecdote - before my husband came back, I asked if they could put some zen music on. They ended up on a ""coffee shop mix,"" playing Shania Twain which was not ideal but fine. Well, the next song starts up. . .and it's the thong song. The ENTIRE OR burst out into laughter. I adamantly said ""my baby will not be born to the thong song."" My husband said that when he came in he was so surprised that it felt like a party in the room. 

A few minutes in, I could sense some tugging, and asked if she'd started cutting. The nurse said nope, she's getting the baby. And just like that, she was on my cheek, and the waves of relief and joy just flowed over me again and again. I can't think of that moment without tearing up. She was finally here, and she was ok. It was all ok. 

She did end up being a big girl, 9lb 5 oz. I am so happy with the decisions I made along the way, while holding space for all of the very real and big emotions that I managed at each stage. 

I offer this up to anyone struggling to process, or thinking of trying to ""beat"" the test. If I hadn't been diagnosed, I wouldn't have had the data I needed to make the best decisions for myself and my baby. I might have gone to 41 weeks as a ftm. She could have been bigger. So many what ifs.

This is only my story and I know others have had very different experiences. But as I prepare for the one hour test for my second pregnancy, I feel such a sense of peace. What will come will come, and I will manage it. As Glennon Doyle says, I can do hard things. And you can too. ❤️",10,1737061444.0,GestationalDiabetes,1,1.0,False
1i2za0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianTeenagers/comments/1i2za0b/my_one_and_only_proposal_story/,My one and only proposal story!,"So there was this girl I had a crush on, for like 4 years. I never initiated talking as I used to get super nervous whenever she was around me. She had an idea that I have a crush on her, but she never knew it for sure, until my friend told her during the duration of preboards. I legit threw punches on him for telling her, but what was done, was done.

So after a few days, just before the beginning of class 12 board exams I knew it my heart that I need to propose to her. (Ye ask out for coffee wagera nhi aaya mere dimag mein). So I devised a plan that I'll propose her in like good old school movies type, full ghutne pe baith ke flowers wagera ke sath outside the exam centre when our 1st paper ends. But her father was there, so it got postponed.

As now I was getting restless, I told her to meet me in the school itself after the exam just infront of her exam hall. 

Here comes the main part guys-

After my exam ended, along with a bunch of my friends I waited infront of her exam hall for a few minutes which felt like eternity, but when she came out, godd she was looking so cute in that uniform. Anyways, when she came out I sat infront of her on one knee, I took out a small rose (I had smuggled it inside the board exams centre in a pouch), and said... Will you become my partner xxxx? 

(I was shaking like crazy, my friends were behind me and her friends were behind her in a corridor)

She took the rose, helped me get up, I thought if she accepted the rose she said yes, but then she whispered in my ear that she has a boyfriend😭

Bro I kinda knew that she has a bf, but I thought she had broken up with him... apparently she was saving me from the embarrassment I would have faced if she loudly would have said no.

As I was too engrossed in the moment, my friend told me that teachers were coming this way and we hurried out.

So yeah, that was my one and only proposal of my life. Never talked to a woman after that ever 😃

(Thodi si boring hogyi, but if you read it, I am thankful)

I recently invited her to go for pancakes and she said she wouldn’t be seen dead at the place I chose. The place I chose was high up on Tripadvisor and looks like a nice place. She said she went there as a kid and it’s too full of students… yet she got me to meet her at the most student, edgy genZ vibes cafe ever!

I feel like she’s just making excuses and just wants to be the ‘cool one’ in the group who picks the place. Either way I’m getting fed up of doing what she wants. I met her for ramen (I don’t particularly love ramen but I went to meet her), we went to that edgy cafe which was not my vibe at all but I just thought ‘coffee’s coffee everywhere’ and again my main focus was hanging out with her, we always go to her favourite cafe, she wanted to go to a small ice rink at the xmas market that took five seconds to skate around rather than the cheaper, bigger rink I suggested (luckily we didn’t get round to do that one but I remember the conversation). 

Maybe because I’m so easygoing - and maybe just a considerate person who doesn’t care what I do as long as I meet up with friends - she’s got used to me going with her ideas. Today when I mentioned the pancakes restaurant idea, she quickly put it down. But then afterwards she said she wasn’t available for a month or so anyway. So what was the point in putting my idea down? Did she really have to say ‘that place? Oh I wouldn’t be seen dead there’. If it were me being invited somewhere I really didn’t want to go, I would’ve just said ‘you know what, that place isn’t my vibe but you have fun.’ But she went full judgemental. Also what about going somewhere your so-called friend wants to go?! While we’ve been friends hanging out in the last year, I’ve always been the one doing what she wants apart from one time when I hosted afternoon tea at my place (but she likes afternoon tea so a lucky accident maybe?). I’m so done with her controlling what we do and putting my ideas down. I don’t have the mental energy to keep up with someone who has such niche taste and preferences. She definitely hasn’t tried to pick somewhere that I would like!

I thought I had high-class, posh taste. No, friends, this woman is in a whole other awkward category. It’s clear she only wants to go to ‘cool’ places, which apparently the pancake place I picked out was not.

","

























































































































Hi! I’m in Columbus Ohio and I’m looking for cool women to be friends with! I’ve realized I’m ace for a few years now.

About me: I’m 32, live in Columbus, Ohio, and I’m into all things horror and spooky. I like watching things about Bigfoot and aliens and ghost and unexplained mysteries. I also enjoy playing traditional card games and board games. I like football and I’m 420 friendly. I also am interested in religion and spirituality and I like watching and listening to things about those topics too. 

I’m looking for a friend to get coffee with, hang out with, have movie nights or game nights with, and maybe have some late night smoke sesh philosophical conversations with.

1i2yxtt,https://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/1i2yxtt/a_thread_for_commonpervasive_and_misinformation/,A thread for common/pervasive and misinformation or otherwise controversial advice given to singers,"Hi! I’ve spent years in private lessons with multiple coaches as well as vocal performance and pedagogy in college and a LOT of independent study (mostly with reading suggested by some of my coaches but also dabbling in scientific papers on pedagogy on google scholar) and if there’s one thing I learned, it’s that if you ask 10 successful voice teachers the same question, you’ll get several different (and sometimes contradictory) information. I want this thread to become a resource for singers beginning their journey, to know what kind of information they should be cautious of. I’ll start and I encourage you to not only add your own additions to the list but also discuss mine and each other’s claims for better understanding in the community as a whole!

Hydration: This may sound silly, but there’s a lot of things people don’t know or think they know about hydration. To start, it takes about 4 hours after drinking water for your body to produce the mucus that lubricates your vocal folds (it’s much faster if you breath the water, so steam or a humidifier can be your friend) make sure you hydrate throughout the day before singing because no amount of water on stage will help you aside from short term immediate relief (although that’s anecdote as far as I know). On the flip side, most of these substances that “dehydrate” you like alcohol and caffeine do so because they’re diuretics, they make you pee. As long as you’re consuming enough water, these substances are fine in moderation - even on performance days.

Tea, honey, lemon etc: A warm drink will encourage blood flow to your neck and mouth which is good for healing and relaxing, this is true of tea and also water or even coffee. If the tea is still STEAMING it could give a more immediate hydration of the vocal folds for reasons given above though. Honey has some anti-inflammatory properties, but it won’t coat your throat and neither will products like throat-coat tea. This is because your larynx is in your trachea which is reflexively blocked by your epiglottis when you swallow. Food and drink go down your esophagus, a completely different tube.

Completely changing the tone, let’s talk about “the baritone curse”. Your voice isn’t worse for being lower, simply different. But also, if the music you love is higher and thus you want to sing higher, that’s 100% attainable. Many baritones in both pop/rock and even theatre can “sing tenor”. Freddie Mercury, Ramin Karimloo, Maynard James Keenan, and Axle Rose are all baritones. I’m sure there are many baritones who train to sing tenor in opera, but I’m not well versed in opera singers outside of the big names. Lastly, vocal fach doesn’t really matter outside of opera (choir uses a different system called four part harmony, which splits baritones between tenor 2 and bass 1 and combines contraltos and mezzo-sopranos as “altos” (this is an oversimplification but I just want to remind everyone that different classification is used in different contexts and often don’t apply to popular music)

There’s a lot more information out there, but I’m trying not to write a novel! I’ll be in the replies, cheers!

1i2yxl2,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffeeshopowners/comments/1i2yxl2/wholesale_pricing_model_question/,Wholesale pricing model question,"Hello everyone!  I wanted to float an idea that I’ve been kicking around with a specialty roaster that utilizes my services. We’ve been exploring how to adjust pricing for this upcoming year, realizing that a significant number of our accounts are in more rural areas with lower cost of living and pricing that would put you out of business in a more urban area. As the C-market continues to ride high, we’re finding that the coffees we usually purchase are all creeping up in price to the point where we have to adjust prices. It’s been about two years since we’ve raised prices but it feels like many of these shops are feeling pressure from a cost perspective and while only 1 or 2 shops are on payment plans, we don’t want to put more strain on them. What we are kicking around is a variable pricing model, where we charge a varied price for single origins depending on what our fixed costs of production are. The benefit we see for coffee shop owners is that as coffee prices rise so will prices but as coffee prices fall so will our prices. We will make a bit less money from the gamble of purchasing green coffee and it will require a shift in our green coffee purchasing strategy, but as a coffee shop owner I’m wondering what your response to such a proposal would be. We currently offer free private labelling and are able to increase our volume without increasing our fixed costs, so if we suddenly got business that needed 1,000lbs a week, it wouldn’t cost substantially more in labor. Thank you in advance for your thoughts. Apologies for formatting, on mobile. 

TLDR: if your coffee roaster adjusted your coffee prices higher or lower based on the market and took less profit and risk for themselves to do so, would you be into it. Why or why not?",1,1737060457.0,coffeeshopowners,0,1.0,False

I'm looking to make a genuine connection (or as close as you can get from posting on Reddit since dating apps are just as much of a nightmare lol), so here's a little bit about me:

I'm an East Coast-based, city-dwelling introvert (25F, 5'1""). I'm a homebody who enjoys the simple pleasures and the freedom that comes with being childfree (non-negotiable)—doing what I want, when I want (even if that's nothing at all!): curling up with a good book, occasional gaming sessions, binge-watching shows, planning my next vacation spot, trying new recipes or perfecting old favorites, hanging out with my two cats, and taking quality naps. While I can be outgoing, I ultimately need my downtime to recharge. You won't find me camping, hiking, or running a marathon—I prefer my adventures in or near civilization with AC, tasty food, and a proper cup of coffee or tea.

So, that's a basic summary of me. I'm looking for someone (between the ages of 25-35 only) who understands the value of engaging discussions, can share their passions, and brings their own interesting perspectives to the table. I appreciate anything from deep, thought-provoking discussions to silly, lighthearted banter—as long as there's substance behind it.

1i2yu19,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i2yu19/aita_for_reporting_my_coworker_to_management_for/,AITA for reporting my coworker to management for touching and smelling my hair?,"So, I (28F) work at a tech company, and it’s generally a relaxed environment. Most of my coworkers are pretty chill, and I get along with everyone, including Tom (35M). We work on the same team, but I don’t interact with him too much outside of team meetings and casual office chats. That said, things have gotten really uncomfortable lately, and I’m not sure if I’m overreacting, so I need some advice.

About a month ago, I was sitting at my desk working, and Tom walked by and, without saying anything, reached over and brushed his fingers through my hair. I was stunned, but I didn’t say anything, just awkwardly laughed it off, assuming it was a one-off thing. But then it started happening more and more. Every time he’d walk by my desk, he’d touch my hair, sometimes lightly running his fingers through it. It started feeling weird, but I just didn’t know how to handle it.

Then, one day, it crossed the line. I was in the break room getting coffee, and Tom came up behind me and *smelled* my hair. He just leaned in, took a deep breath, and said something like, “Your hair smells so good. What kind of shampoo do you use?” I was completely horrified. I didn’t know what to say, so I just muttered a quick answer and walked away. I couldn’t believe it.

After that, it only got worse. He would sometimes stand a little too close to me when talking, and I’d catch him sniffing the air around me like he was trying to smell my hair again. He’d even comment on it, like, “Your hair always smells so fresh. I wish I knew what scent that is.” I tried to brush it off, but it felt more and more invasive every time.

Finally, a few days ago, after he did it again during a meeting, I couldn’t stay silent any longer. I felt grossed out and violated. I went to HR and explained the situation, including how Tom had repeatedly touched and smelled my hair without my consent. I told them I felt uncomfortable, and I had tried to ignore it, but it had gone on long enough. HR assured me they’d take care of it.

A couple of days later, Tom came to me, visibly upset. He asked why I went to HR and said, “I didn’t think it was a big deal. I was just complimenting you on your hair, it’s no different than someone saying they like your shoes.” I told him it wasn’t just a compliment, it was an invasion of my personal space, and I had asked him to stop before but he didn’t listen. He then said I was overreacting, that I was making things awkward, and that I should’ve just told him to stop instead of reporting him. A few people from our team have been talking about it, and some say I made a mountain out of a molehill, that I should’ve just handled it directly with him.

Now, I’m feeling conflicted. I don’t want to be the person who overreacts, but I also feel like his behavior was crossing serious boundaries. Was I wrong for going to HR? Should I have just told him to stop?

1i2yu12,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i2yu12/aita_for_asking_my_husband_to_spend_time_with_me/,AITA for asking my husband to spend time with me instead of playing video games?,"I 32 F and my husband 35 M got into a heated argument yesterday and I don’t know how to handle it. We’ve been married for 14 years and have one child 11 month old male. 

My husband has been going through a rough time with depression  since we had our child. He is currently a stay at home dad, his job is seasonal and he has the winter off. I work 38 hours a week at an urgent care facility which has slowly been sucking the life out of me. I long to be home with my family, but it’s not realistic as one of us needs to bring in money and keep health insurance.

My husband has started playing video games a lot lately. He had stopped playing for a year and a half with all our life changes and moving to a new house. He said that playing games was helping with his depression. He doesn’t play when he’s home alone with our son, but when I’m at home he plays while my son naps, for a couple of hours while he’s awake, and from the time I take him upstairs to put him to bed until anywhere from 2-4 in the morning. I’ve been missing my partner so much lately because even though this hobby keeps him at home, he’s not really here.

Cut to yesterday, my husband met a friend for coffee, came home and we talked for about an hour, then after breakfast immediately asked if I cared if he played games. I will admit I didn’t handle it well. I kind of huffed and said “if you really want to, I guess”. He immediately picked up on my tone and said he didn’t have to if I didn’t want him to. To this, I said if that’s what you truly want to do I don’t want to make you upset and take that away from you. But I do feel like I would like to spend more time with you. He had started playing already and was telling me we had spent time together the night before and already that morning. (Night before was an hour we watched an episode of a show together after my son fell asleep) I told him I didn’t feel like that was a lot of quality time and just wanted to be together as a family. 

From there things escalated. I asked him if he had spent more time playing games recently or with me, he admitted playing games. I told him I am feeling depressed myself and just want to spend time with my husband. He turned his game off, said I had ruined gaming for him making him feel like i was making him choose between the game or his family, so he would never play them again. He also threw his controller and broke it at that point. 

I have told him multiple times since yesterday that I don’t want to take away his hobby. I’m glad he has something he is passionate about, but I need him to have some balance with it. I miss my partner and I want to spend time together as a family. He will not be reasonable. He tells me that he only has fun when he’s good at the game and he can’t be good unless he plays more. He said that I have completely taken the gun out of it with our conversation yesterday and he will never play again. (All said with contempt like I have ruined his life)  today he is sulking and saying that he’s depressed, which I guess makes two of us. 

I don’t know how to handle this from here. I’m glad I’m getting my husband back, but spending time together is not enjoyable right now since I have taken his favorite hobby away. Still not the intent I had when we had our conversation. Any advice on how to handle this? Was I wrong for asking him to spend more time with me? 

He’s a great father and I appreciate so much that he stays home and takes care of our son. Is it wrong of me to ask for more time when he doesn’t get time to do what he wants most days? I work 4 days a week. Any body else ever been in a simile position? ",3,1737060197.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

(Extra points if it deals with grief, family or loneliness probably (idk just my guess at what’ll make me cry)) 🙏😂

Books I’ve read that made me shed a little tear:
1. A little life by Hanya Yanagihara. Became my favourite book for the single fact that it legit made me cry. 
2. The Berry Pickers by Amanda Peters (eyes got moist at the end)
3. The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini (same as above) 

Books I’ve read (and mostly loved) that did not make me cry but probably should have if I was a normal person:
1. Tomorrow x3 by Gabrielle Zevin
2. Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro
3. Soldier Sailor by Claire Kilroy
4. Shuggie Bain by Douglas Stuart
5 Know My Name by Chanel Miller
6. Wandering Souls by Cecile Pin
7. In Memoriam by Alice Winn
8. A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman
9. As Long as the Lemon Trees Go
10. My Dark Vanessa by Kate Elizabeth Russell
11. Lie With Me by Philippe Besson
12. Heaven by Miele Kawakami
13. Before the Coffee Gets Cold series by Toshikazu Kawaguchi
14. Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keys

The Dedica is my first machine and has been going strong for three years now, I use it with pre ground coffee but I have always been tempted by the breville express impress due to the integrated grinder and general good write up it seems to get from non coffee specific recommendation sites. My plan was to get a second hand one for around $500.

However, from lurking here and some further reading it seems that the grinder is not great and it may be better to get another combination. 

I am also not looking to get super into the hobby in terms of measuring shots etc but would like to get a slightly better tasting coffee.

My question is how best to spend the ~$500 without creating a massive sprawl of equipment and an overly complex coffee making process.
-Buy a grinder and keep the Dedica? 
-Buy the express impress?
-Buy another coffee machine such as the Bambino and a grinder?
-some other option?

Any advice is gratefully received!

1i2yjhi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1i2yjhi/our_therapist_said_things_feel_hopeless/,"Our therapist said ""things feel hopeless""","**TL;DR:** Everything seems broken. I (43M) know what probably needs to happen, but I'm too fucking scared to talk about it.

**Situation:**

* Me, 43. Wife, 43
* Married for 10 years, together 17
* Two kids, 8 and 6
* Constant criticism, negativity, and control issues for unknown reasons

I writing this to vent, get things out there, and just talk to other people who might have been in similar situations. It's probably going to be very long (1,600+ words). I'm sorry. If you read it, I appreciate you. (And yes, I should see a real therapist).

Anyway, I'm just feeling lost and hopeless about our marriage.

Like many, we've had our ups and downs over the years. But for the last few years, I feel like there is this constant undertone of negativity toward me: either questioning decisions I've made, invalidating opinions I have, criticizing something I've done, and a general lack of curiosity about anything I'm excited about.

Like, I honestly feel like my existence annoys the shit out of her. And all this happens in front of our kids. So, who knows what kind of message this sends to them.

Anyway, one pattern I've noticed over the years when we've had arguments is this sort of verbal jujitsu where any point I bring up needs to have detailed receipts or examples of what happened.

It ranges from stupid stuff like:

>Her: ""Why were you on the Peloton for 30 minutes? Now I don't have time to ride it.""  
Me: ""Grmsbbsdjkjsis"" (somewhere deep in my mind, I'm thinking that I was sure we agreed I could ride for that long... am I wrong?)

I am prone to getting emotionally flooded when I feel attacked or criticized (it's something I've worked on with past therapists), so it's hard for me to remember or bring up examples to justify my own points of disagreement, especially in the heat of the moment.

Because of this, it seems like any argument I had was therefore invalid and I always left these disagreements feeling like things were always my fault and maybe I am just crazy because I forgot this or that thing.

**Quick background: Financial infidelity**

In mid-2019, I committed a bit... err.. of financial infidelity. I essentially got caught up in the gamified approach to stock options trading that platforms like Robinhood provide.

A gambling addiction is probably a more appropriate analogy. I was obsessed and made series after series of very stupid bets. Ultimately, I ended up losing all the money in our shared savings account -- we're talking numbers that would make [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) people blush.

At the end of 2019, I hit rock bottom, broke down and came clean about how I lost all our money. ""Fortunately"", I only touched our savings. So, our day-to-day life didn't change. With our income, we could still pay for house, daycare, etc.

I went to therapy, sought treatment. She was mortified, confused, livid, all of that and more (and rightfully so). She also went to therapy because of this. 

Since then, we've been open about our finances though I think there's still trust issues -- I can't blame her for that (e.g., any bonus or stock grants she gets, she now keeps in her own savings accounts).

I've been trying to slowly pay her back as well.

But I've often wondered if some of this (what I perceive as animosity) stems from that still, nearly 6 years later.

**Journaling**

In early 2019 (!), I started keeping a locked note on my phone that logged whenever we had an argument or some other unpleasant experience that I felt wasn't necessarily fair to me or that I could reference later when we had some disagreement and I needed to prove that something actually happened.

Sometimes it's an entry every few weeks. Sometimes, it's a few times a day. Some are detailed journal entries, and some are just a few bullet points.

I usually have a specific date associated with the entries and it's stuff like:

>Older kid was apparently up from 1:30am to 3:45an last night. Wife got up to help her try to fall back asleep, but is a wreck this morning.

>I was thinking outloud and suggested that maybe we should talk to her pediatrician about pediatric insomnia or something and she gets snippy and annoyed with me and says, “OKAY YUP, I’ll GET RIGHT ON THAT!”

>And then heavily sighs and walks away. I feel like can’t even suggest things to talk to her about how we care for our kid without her feeling attacked or getting bitchy at me.

Sure, random small interaction. It's probably not worth noting, but I just feel like there is this pattern of invalidation toward me.

Or sometimes, I document my own frustrations with control issues:

>We get a fucking endless amount of boxes shipped to our house almost every day and I rarely ask about them or say anything or judge the purchases.

>I ordered a neat little Yeti coffee mug and made the mistake of opening it just now and wife saw and instantly questions me: “uhh, what is that, why did you get that, you already have coffee mugs, you don't need that, I don’t understand why you would get that.”

>I told her I wanted it and don't worry about. She gets annoyed, sighs heavily and walks out of the room frustrated with me.

Like, it's just constant dissatisfaction in anything I do! More stupid stuff like:

>We went to Target today. I parked in the first convenient spot I see (imagine -- it's basically in the exact middle of the row of cars).

>Wife sighs heavily. I know that sigh. I ask what's up. ""I don't understand why you can't just drive up closer?""

>I sigh, pull out and find a parking spot (NO JOKE) 6 spaces closer. ""There, is this okay now?"" I ask.

>""Great,"" she says. Great!

Another good one:

>We’ve been trying to be better about closing cabinets and things in the kitchen when we’re done. I noticed that for nearly all the days last week and this week, she would leave the microwave door open after making breakfast for our older kiddo.

>(I notice this, because I almost run into the damn thing when I put a dish in the sink and turn around.)

>So yesterday, I kindly asked her to please try to remember to close the door when she’s done.

>Instead of saying okay, she gets ridiculously defensive (which is rich, because she always calls me out for this) and says, “I usually do. You don’t see all the times I do close the microwave door when I use it cooking dinner!”

>So, this morning, she gets done with our kid's breakfast, and out of nowhere, aggressively closes the microwave door and says “See! I closed the door when I’m done!”

>So, even when I try to stand up and ask for something related to how I feel, I still get crap.

>\[DATE: Next day\]

>Hey... guess who didn’t close the microwave door today? Of course, now I can’t tell her this because she was just absolutely mean about it the first time I asked. So, now I’m in a no-win situation.

Anyway, I could go on and on and on with examples of what I've written.

But essentially it's just a pattern of criticism, or dissatisfaction, or invalidation of nearly everything I do. I just don't understand and I am at my wits end.

On a whim, I decided to copy and paste this note from my phone into Google Docs today. If I were to print this out at 12 point font, this journal is **70 pages long**. 70 pages! I am floored. And devastated. How did things get this way?

**Therapy**

In the past, I've asked for couples counseling, because I feel like we have significant communication issues.

Kudos to her, she reached out to a therapist and we spent a bunch of time with her last year. Things would sometimes get better and sometimes (often, really), we'd fall back into our normal rut.

At one point, our therapist told us, ""I am just going to put a word to this. Hopeless. I feel like things are hopeless right now.""

The therapist then asked me if I felt like I was giving up. I said ""Yeah, kind of. Everything always seems like my fault. I’ve tried changing and ended up getting nothing out of it. We quickly revert back to the same old - same old.""

We've recently been working with a new therapist on a roughly bi-weekly schedule. All the sessions are the same: be kind to each other, give each other grace, and remember to love each other.

Things go fine for a few days and then we're back to the same pattern of me feeling like I'm getting torn down and withdrawing because of it (which probably makes my wife even more annoyed and further contributes to this cycle).

**In the car**

This happens a lot: while driving somewhere together (even if it's like 5 minutes), she listens to a podcast the entire time. I can hear it coming through her AirPods. There is just zero engagement with me. She only pauses when she wants to tell me something.

If I want to talk to her, she is both visibly and audibly annoyed at having to pause when I want to say anything. The moment I’m done, she goes back to her podcasts.

No joke, this happens every single time we drive anywhere.

**Intimacy**

In terms of intimacy, we've had sex roughly once a week over the last year (err, yes, I tracked -- I want to know if maybe we aren't connecting the right ways).

It's fun, but not the most exciting thing, which bums me out. Mostly lay down, do the thing and that's it. There's lot's of foreplay (me to her) that she seems to enjoy, but very little (okay, absolutely none) toward me.

It's definitely led to frustrations on my part and I've brought this up and she's always surprised: ""Oh, I don't do enough? I thought I did.""

I've had to resort to the little blue pill on a few occasions, because I feel like I can't get excited enough sometimes. She immediately notices when I've taken it and wants me to talk to her before I take it again so we can agree (spoiler: it's been never).

So instead, it's these half-hearted attempts at doing the deed, getting her off, and little satisfaction on my end

Related to this: sometimes, when we do try to appreciate each other and use the tools our therapists have given us, I bring up stuff like, ""I appreciate all the work you do for the kids"" or ""Thank you for planning summer camp, I know it's a lot of work.""

All I get is, ""well, I really appreciate when you \[name of some sexual act\]""

Like, cool! But... anything else?

**Laundry**

Dude - I can't even do laundry.

One of the things our therapist pointed out was that my wife needs to loosen up and get comfortable letting go of control, and asking for help.

She has complained about all the laundry we have and how much time it takes. I've offered to help. ""No, you'll just mess it up. There's too many delicates.""

Okay, fine. I tried.

Side-note: Friends, I KNOW HOW TO DO LAUNDRY. I""VE DONE IT WHEN I LIVED ON MY OWN.

We both work from home, but she goes into the office about once a week.

When that happens, I sneak into our laundry basket and pull out all of my own clothes and do them.

My thinking is that I'm helping out because:

* A: it's my own clothes, so if I ruin them, it's okay (but I won't ruin them)
* B: it potentially lightens the burden of laundry she is doing

Anyway, she comes home slightly early one day and immediately hears some zippers clinking against the side of the dryer as it's finishing up.

""Ummmm, what is happening"" she asks, immediately suspicious.

I tell her that I’m doing some of my laundry. She immediately asks “what laundry, how are you doing it?”

I told her that I know how to do laundry and I’ve done a lot of laundry in my past. It’s okay. She asks why I sound so annoyed. I told her it was because she comes in and immediately starts judging how I do laundry.

She says:

“Well, I always do everyone’s laundry here and suddenly when you decide to do laundry, you only do your own laundry!”

And then walks out of the room, frustrated.

I figured if I can just do mine for like ONE moment, it’d be helpful. But no. It's not. It never is.

**Family Visits**

Last summer, my family (parents and sister) came to visit. It's a rare occurrence, so it's nice for them to spend time with the kiddos.

Anyway, they spent a lot of time at their AirBnb and didn't come over much.

After their visit, I was on a phone call with my sister and opened up to her about what our therapist had said.

My sister says, ""you used to be such a jovial and happy person and you’re not that way anymore — you’re very closed off and depressed all the time.""

Another thing related to my family:

Over the winter holidays, we were trying to coordinate an AirBnb with my family and my wife's family. My parents ultimately decided they didn't want to travel and bowed out of the trip.

I called my sister to complain and she told me the reason that her and my parents don’t like visit more often is because of my wife (!).

My sister said that she is too controlling about everything and high strung and it makes visits really stressful and unenjoyable.

Ugggggh.

**The end, maybe?**

So, here I am. Feeling like everything I do is a failure and that she legitimately doesn't like me. I know, I'm not perfect either. I can be better about communication, less sensitive to perceived criticism, and better about handling emotions.

And yes, I really do need to talk to her about this and how it makes me feel.

But it's hard because I know, with absolute conviction, it will be twisted around so that she is the victim and I am at fault and these feelings are invalid.

Because it always is that way. Maybe things are hopeless.

I'm a dad with 3 little kids, so coffee is kind of important to me.  My phone was near the drip tray so it rattles a bit - I should probably mute this thing next time!

Beans: some old medium roast Kenyan beans (bought at the grocery store a month ago). $12/kg so good to practice with and tweak settings.

Dose: 20g

Output: 40g espresso 

Time: 24 seconds

Temperature: 96C (205F). I usually drink light roasts so this might be a little high for these beans, meh.

Grinder: DF83 v3.0.  Stock DLC burrs. Declumper removed. Dial at 15 (hallway through the espresso range).  Instead of dumping the beans all at once I poured them in for 5 seconds. Maybe takes 7-10 seconds total time. If I dump the beans at once it takes 5 seconds to grind but I have to grind 3-4 notches coarser to account for more fines. Thoughts?

WDT: Yes, but instead of the stock 9 needles, I only use 3. With more needles I feel like I'm pushing the grounds instead of de-clumping and evenly distributing. Anyone else modify their WDT tool?

RDT:  No

Paper filters: just on top of the puck to keep the shower screen clean.

Other details:  using the Profitec bottomless filter with triple shot basket. 

Taste:  Decent amount of texture. Chocolatey. Not bad for cheap old beans! 

What do you think?  My usual go to is a light Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, but I need to mix it up with some darker beans from time to time. Variety is the spice of life. ",3,1737059236.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

How would you handle this as a couple?","My husband has a female friend who he also slept with/dated right before he met me. He met her in January 2023, matched with me on Tinder in January 2023, and he and I finally met up in early March. We got more serious in April. 

We hung out with her a few times. I attended her birthday party at a spa. We met up with her at a Pride event. We got coffee with her. And I had no idea they had started off as sleeping together/dating this whole time. He swears he told me, but I really don't think so. I'm very sensitive to exes, I wouldn't have forgotten that.

It finally comes out that they dated when she sends him a photo later in the year on Instagram that he just described to me as something I might find inappropriate. A sexy, fun photo with her girlfriend. He also said they kind of went back and forth a bit on if it was inappropriate to send him photos like that, etc. I was happy he disclosed this to me, but was distraught at finding out that they'd actually dated right before us. I told him I'm not comfortable with exes in general, and I'm bothered that she'd send him something like that, given that she knew about me. We go back and forth on it for a bit, and he agrees to not message with her any longer. This was December 2023.

Fast forward to today. We got married in June of last year. I'm now 7 months pregnant. Intentional honeymoon baby. We were coming back from our babymoon and I saw a text on his phone with a heart emoji. He quickly swiped the text away since I was looking at something on his phone with him. I decide I don't want to stress during the flight back, and I'll ask him later. I ask him about a week later, and it's her. He'd let her know previously not to stay in touch, but it turns out she reached out in October a couple months ago. They've texted a bit back and forth, and had a phone call. He let me see the texts last night. We've had a really rough few months of near constant fighting since early September. It feels like insult to injury that we're arguing, and they get back in touch. I wish he'd have shut it down.  
  
I'm really upset that he broke an agreement we had. And is now saying things like ""I want to renegotiate that agreement"" ""if you divorce me, or are angry at me forever over this, so be it"". It's making me wonder why he ever married me if he wasn't ready to prioritize me. Especially now while I'm pregnant. This has been so stressful.

A merry yeehaw to you! Funny enough I don't own any boots or cowboy hats yet. 

I'm Jay. I'm a 30 year old veterinarian for humans who partakes in picking up heavy objects and putting them down repetitively, drinking hot coffee year round and at any hour in the day, making food I see in those blazing fast recipe tutorial videos on social media, and getting lost in movies and games with cool lore. 

What am I here for? Same thing as many of you - it's just really cool to get to know new people. Of all the things in life, sharing a few laughs with a person is one of my favorite things of all time. So, I'm here to get to know you! 

If you're still reading, I've got a question or two for you: 
1. What was your favorite movie that you'd watch over and over again growing up? I could watch the old animated Robin Hood over and over - and I did. A lot.
2. What's a small inconvenience in your life that's become a pet peeve? For the, it's wobbly tables. I have to fix them or move tables.

I look forward to hearing from you!

TL;DR: If the bellows on the official Mignon single dose hopper does not work as intended, try to block the holes that are used to fasten the anti-popcorn holder.

Just bought the official single dose kit for my Specialita. I’ve heard some say that it leaks out of the gate, and some that say that it is okay if you close it before using the bellows.

I just tested the kit, and well, nothing came out, even though the grinder was running while I used the bellows. I kinda punched it and out came the last gram of coffee. For context, I used a simple 3D-printed single dose mod (made by antage_259715 on Printables) before which worked great.

I tried putting o-rings around the gate, but I also saw that the anti-popcorn fastening holes were leaking. I taped them up, put 0.3 g beans in, and now the bellows worked like a charm. Going to fill the small anti-popcorn holes with silicone tomorrow.",1,1737058817.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

I know, “The grass is always greener on the other side” but I honestly can’t shake this. Here we go.

1. I attended an early college high school. Graduated high school with an associate degree 

2. In college, my head was in the books. (Math and science, you can tell by my grammar).

While I was focused, the main culprits were my cripplingly low self-esteem and depression. One girl invited me on a fishing trip with her family. Another girl sat next to me in social studies and talked to me everyday. Another girl jumped on my back after school. The last girl dragged me to the dance floor to dance with her. I brushed them all off because of my self-esteem and depression. I wasn’t ready.

In college, I thought that if I just finished school and landed a sweet job, I’d lose my depression and be ready to date. I did mess around once, but it didn’t last between us.

3. Graduated college. Parents told me to move back in until I save enough money to buy property. 

I landed that awesome job, but I lived at home from 22-24. Not only was I depressed, but I lived with my parents now. No business going out on dates. Get my money up, get a place, figure out my mental health and then start dating. THE PLAN IS SET

4. At 24 I jumped into a mortgage I wasn’t ready for. I was house poor. Great. No money. And now I’m depressed and stressed 24/7. I have no business dating. 2 years of house poverty pass. 

5. In therapy, studying up on emotional intelligence. Dropped from 215lbs to 170 and fit. Got two raises and now income is steady and the bills are paid. In adult clubs (HOBBIES). This is it. 

The only problem is that I’m now 26 with no LTR  experience and my virginity regenerated because it’s been four years and it wasn’t even often with my last partner. I feel like “The right one won’t care about inexperience” pertains to 25 and under. Society has dictated that I’ve hit the age where it’s officially a red flag that I’ve never had an LTR. 

It’s giving me major anxiety, to the point where I can’t force myself to make a profile much less ask someone to get coffee in person. I feel like I’ve nailed every other aspect of my life and reached the end of a dark tunnel only to be told that I expired years ago. That nobody wants a dude who doesn’t know how to navigate romance at the age of 26. What now?

Just prefacing with a trigger warning for heavy themes of war and death. It’s Natlan, so I think its to be expected. But! Make sure you’re taking care of yourself if you’re not currently in the right headspace for these topics. It is a longer read, right around 5k words, so be aware of that as well :) 

Saffron stood at the entrance to the Stadium of the Sacred Flame. She sighed, *she hated that it was practically mid day and yet it looked as though it were midnight.* That stupid dark version of the Sun or whatever it was loomed above Natlan. Saffron watched as people ran around, running with supplies, food, weapons. Some were helping the wounded to get inside, and others were heading away from the Stadium and into the chaos. She had known that Natlan was a nation of war, but she didn’t think it would be *this* bad. She shook her head to clear her thoughts, and started her journey away from the Stadium. *She had to get back to the Scions of the Canopy- to her shop.* As she walked over the bridge, she spotted a messenger who appeared to have come from that direction. He was clearly from the Scions, and in a bit of a hurry. She raised her hand to wave and get his attention as he passed, mentally noting that she should be quick. “Excuse me! Hi!”

The messenger skidded to a stop, having nearly run past her. He seemed disheveled, and looked at her questioningly until she spoke. “Sorry to interrupt, are you coming from the Scions of the Canopy?”

The messenger’s face dropped into a frown. “Yes… I am. Why? You aren’t going there, are you?”

Saffron nodded with a pleasant smile. “I am. It’ll be a short trip, but it’s important. How bad is it?”

“You shouldn’t do that” He shook his head “It isn’t entirely corroded, but it’s nearly there. There are enemies everywhere. Everyone has already evacuated, there is no one left. It’s extremely dangerous”

Saffron smiled. *Not entirely corroded- there’s still a chance* “Thank you for the info! Good luck!” With that, she took off. She could hear the young man behind her calling after her, but she ignored him. She knew it wasn’t the smartest move to go back to the Scions, but in her eyes she had no choice. 

Earlier that day, when the abyss attacked, Saffron had fought alongside the Scions of the Canopy. That fight, however, was a losing battle. The longer that they fought, the further she had been pushed away from the Scions of the Canopy. Eventually, she helped to escort a group of people to the Stadium of the Sacred Flame, which is where she had been ever since. There was one large issue with this; when she had left the Scions of the Canopy, she had also left her shop. She left everything that she had worked so hard for over the last few years, everything that she had built. She had poured her life into her coffee shop, and she couldn’t just leave it behind. Fortunately for her, it was portable! All she needed to do was grab her belongings, and then get back to the Stadium. Simple!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When Saffron coughed into her arm, she made it as quiet as possible. The air here… it was *different* than it had been earlier in the day. It was heavy. No, not heavy, *toxic*. The journey to the Scions of the Canopy was taking much longer than it would have on any normal day. Currently, Saffron was hidden behind some bushes on the side of the path. Those abyss dog things- which she had been told were known as *rifthounds*- were patrolling up and down the path that she had been walking on. Saffron knew that she was perfectly capable of fighting them, she had fought them earlier in the day. However she also assumed that saving her energy would be more beneficial. Something about fighting abyss monsters was just so draining. They were different than anything that she had fought before. 

When Saffron assumed that the path was clear, she very quickly went back to making her way towards the cliff in the distance. She didn’t remember this path ever being so empty. It was eerie- usually there were people to walk past every now and then, most of them heading to or from the Stadium. She had even seen scholars from Sumeru on this path before, but not today. 

Finally, the world around Saffron turned from flat trails into inclines and cliffs. She had made it to the Scions of the Canopy. She smiled to herself- she had been right to make this trip. She had survived this long, and that was generally a good sign, right? As Saffron got to the top of her climb, she looked back towards the Stadium. All things considered, she had made decent time. Saffron’s eyes squinted as she saw a bright light ignite within the Stadium. It rose into the air, and almost looked like a new Sun against the dark sky. *What was that?* Saffron shook her head and turned back to walking. She didn’t have the time to try to figure out what it was. She just hoped that it was something good.

As Saffron made it closer to her shop, her coughs were more intense and more frequent. Every time it happened, she mentally cursed herself out for making noise- there were monsters patrolling everywhere, she needed to be more careful about being loud. The air here was just horrible. She wondered to herself if the fact that she had an anemo vision made her more sensitive to these things, or if it were the other way around and it protected her from the corrosive air. Either way, she realized that the stuffy air of the chasm was even preferable to this. 

Saffron smiled as she stood in front of the door to her shop. She had rented a small hut to run her pop up shop in, and it had served her well. She was only outside, but she could already tell by looking through the window that everything seemed to be as it was when she left it. That would make things way easier than she had anticipated. As she placed her hand on the door knob, she froze.

“HELP!” Saffron looked around, and then she heard another scream. This time, she looked *up*. She realized that *up* was the direction from which the scream had come from, up on the top of the cliff that the Scions of the Canopy rests on. Unfortunately, she also figured that it was extremely likely that a dozen other abyssal monsters had realized the exact same thing. She sighed and pulled her hand away from the door knob, readying her polearm as she ran to the source of the voice.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Earlier that Day**

“Why do *you* get to be the Traveler? You were the last time!” A young girl crossed her arms at the boy in front of her. They shared similar features, with dark hair and light green eyes. The girls hair hung neatly around her shoulders, and the boy’s hair was tied up into a bun with a bandana. It was clear to any onlookers that they were siblings at the very least, if not twins. 

The boy crossed his arms and smiled “Because *I* am better at being the Traveler than you are!” This promptly earned an eyeroll from his sister.

“The *last* time that you were the traveler, you walked us straight into a mud pit! And just so you know, I’m not actually Paimon, so I can’t just fly over it!” 

Saffron smiled from her seat as she watched the kids bicker. The young woman- who Saffron presumed to be their mother- sat across from her took a drink from her cup of coffee before turning to Saffron. “Are you sure that you didn’t give those two any caffeine? They seem more energized than usual”  

Saffron laughed and shook her head. “No caffeine, I promise. There wasn’t even coffee in it to begin with, just a smoothie made with bulle fruit” These people had been here last customers of the morning, and she always made it a point to enjoy a cup of coffee with her customers when the chances came. They didn’t happen often, but this just so happened to be one of those rare moments.

Just then, the little girl dragged the boy over by his ear. “MOM! He won’t let me be the traveler this time! He did it last time!”

The lady looked at the two kids in front of her- clearly this was not a new debate judging by the expression on her face. Just as she was about to tell the children to share, Saffron chimed in. “Have you two ever thought of playing as someone other than the Traveler and Paimon? They are absolutely amazing, don’t get me wrong, but maybe you could change it up this time” 

The girl tilted her head in confusion, and the boy finally wrestled her hand off of his ear. They both looked at Saffron, waiting for her to continue. “You know, the drinks that I made for you are from Fontaine, and there are some pretty amazing people there too that you could play as. They have amazing talents, and they helped to save their nation. The ones I am talking about are friends of the Traveler too, if I’m not mistaken.”

The boy instantly perked up “Friends of the Traveler?”

“Mhmmm, but if you’re both so set on playing as the Traveler himself, maybe I shouldn’t tell you two.” Saffron dramatically turned her head away, still looking at the kids from the corner of her eye. They both rapidly shook their heads. 

“No, tell us! Pretty please?” The little girl asked, tugging on Saffron’s sleeve. Saffron turned back to the children, smiling.

“I guess that I could tell you their stories” With that, Saffron launched into a retelling of Fontaine’s events, specifically highlighting Lady Furina and Monsieur Neuvillette. Of course, the story wasn’t 100% accurate, as Saffron only knew about what happened from the gossip in her pop up shop. She did know enough to keep the kids excited about what would happen next. When she reached the end of the story, she smiled. “So, what if you two played as Furina and Neuvillette? Saving Fontaine?”

The two twins looked at eachother, and then spoke in unison: “I want to be the Traveler!” They instantly went back to bickering about who would get to be the Traveler, but this time they did agree that they would be “saving Fontaine”. Saffron sighed and looked at their mother, who was quietly laughing.

“Thank you for trying” She said before getting up, her cup now empty. “They will sort it out eventually, don’t worry” 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Normally* when Saffron would reach the top of a cliff after climbing, she would take a moment to catch her breath. This time, however, her head was on a swivel to find the source of the scream. As soon as she was over the ledge, she held her polearm in her hand. Some distance in front of her, she saw two rifthounds hurrying over to a clearing. She took off after them- if they were rushing, they were *probably* heading in the same direction that she was. 

As they reached the clearing, Saffron slid to a stop. In front of her were several rifthounds circling a tree. Saffron looked at them, confused. They were circling it like sharks, but it was just a tree, right? Then Saffron saw them- in a low hanging branch, the two tiny “travelers” that had been in her cafe earlier. They looked terrified, clinging onto each other. Saffron’s heart sank- how long had they been up there?

Should she have thought of a plan before running into a fight? Should she maybe come up with some sort of strategy to efficiently take down *that many* enemies? Probably, yes. However, Saffron wasn’t especially well known for her impulse control or for her well thought out plans. Before she had even considered it, she was already charging towards the closest rifthound, spear in hand.

   The moment that Saffron’s polearm made contact with the rifthound, it howled and turned around. The other rifthounds turned as well to face what the commotion was. Saffron scowled and held her polearm defensively- “Leave them alone!” 
    
    What happened after that can only be described as pure chaos. Even though the corroded air burned at Saffron’s lungs, she didn’t let it hold her back. She fought with everything that she had, slashing and jabbing at the abyssal creatures. She took down one by one, noting to herself that she would have to go back to Liyue soon to thank her mentor there for teaching her to fight. That’s not to say that the abyssal enemies never got any hits of their own in, with one rifthound in particular getting a painful slash on Saffron’s right upper arm. She staggered back before landing a finishing blow that sent the rifthound promptly back to the abyss. 
    
    The fight went on for a long time. She could have sworn that they were multiplying. Finally, she sent her polearm flying like a javelin, and it finished off the final rifthound. Saffron stood there for a moment, doubled over trying to catch her breath. If you had asked her this morning if she could ever be more exhausted than she was after that damned capybara, she would have said no. Unfortunately, this fight proved her wrong. Her limbs felt like painful jello. As she thought of this, she had a sudden realization- *the kids!*
    
    Saffron whipped around to look at the tree they had been in. For a brief moment, she panicked- *they weren’t on the branch that they had been on!* She realized immediately after that they were just climbing down, and sighed in relief. She ran over, meeting them at the base of the tree.
    
    Saffron knelt down so that she was eye level with the kids. Not that she was especially tall to begin with. “Are you two okay? Are you hurt?” She looked at them both. Fortunately she didn’t see any physical injuries, they just seemed shaken up. 
    
    The little girl nodded “We didn’t know what to do, so we climbed the tree” Her voice was sad and quiet, and her eyes were jumping everywhere to scan the area. The boy was just staring at the dark sky. 
    
    Saffron mustered up a smile for the two of them, and rested a hand on their shoulders. “That was very smart, you two made the right choice. Why didn’t you guys leave with everyone else?”
    
    The boy stopped staring off and looked at Saffron.”We came up here to play, then it got really dark. We got lost, and then when we found our way back…” The boy’s voice trailed off, and his sister picked up his sentence for him “Everyone was gone”
    
    Saffron felt a pang of guilt in her chest. She had helped with the evacuation, how had no one thought of doing a head count? She really hoped no one else was left behind. “Well, you two did a great job. You’re both really brave”
    
    The girl smiled back before her face dropped. Her gaze fell behind Saffron. “Miss Saffron… What’s that?”
    
    Saffron turned her head to look behind her, and practically felt the color leave her face. A glowing purple structure had appeared a few feet behind her. She recognized it from earlier; an abyssal pylon. She watched as a few abyssal monsters spawned, not yet noticing Saffron or the kids.
    
    Saffron looked back at the twins, trying not to let the panic show on her face. Her voice rested barely above a whisper “Come on, we need to get to the Stadium, your tribe is there waiting for you. Stay quiet.” They nodded, turning to start walking towards the stadium. Saffron trailed behind, but that’s when she felt it- a tickle in her throat. *Oh no, this stupid air!*. Saffron buried her face into her elbow as her coughing fit came, but that wasn’t enough to silence it. Saffron looked over to where the pylon was, where just under a dozen abyssal monsters were now glaring at her. She glanced back at the kids “Get to the Stadium, I’ll be right behind you!” They grabbed onto each other's hands as they nodded and ran away.

Saffron went to grab her polearm, but realized it was still resting on the ground from her fight earlier. As the monsters charged towards her, her anemo vision glowed on her waist. She may not have a weapon, but she would *not* go down without a fight. She just had to last long enough for the kids to get further away, and then she would flee too. Then, she would get to go back to Sumeru. It would all be fine, right?

*Saffron knew that it wouldn’t be fine*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Saffron still wasn’t used to dreaming. She had dreamed as a kid, but like the rest of Sumeru, her dreams faded away as she had gotten older. The first night that she had dreamed as an adult was the night after her parents were arrested for distributing forbidden knowledge. It hadn’t been a pleasant experience- her dream made her relive the events of the day. That dream had plagued her often in the time since, but she always knew that it was just that. *A dream*.

Right now Saffron wondered if she was dreaming again. It was a strange feeling, almost like she was floating in some weird pool of darkness. It felt like a dream, but at the same time it felt so incredibly real. 

The sensation faded, and Saffron laid on the ground with her eyes closed. It was relaxing, she could feel a light breeze against her face. The air she breathed was fresh, the smell of grass tickling her nose. When she opened her eyes, the sky was dark. She looked around; she couldn’t remember where she was. As she sat up, she felt her hair shift around her shoulders. “Huh, weird” Saffron mused to herself as she ran a hand through her hair. The ribbon that usually secured her hair in a bun was nowhere to be found. It must’ve fallen out while she was looking for the kids.

…. Wait, the kids?

Saffron’s face paled as she frantically looked around. She was in Natlan, and there had been a war. She had found some kids in danger… but what happened after that? She shuffled to her feet, looking around.

Saffron quickly walked around the area, scanning any hiding places. Where did they go?! “Kids?!” Saffron spoke loudly enough that anyone close by should have heard her. *Wait, they had been in a tree, right?* Saffron hurried back over to the tree where they had been, passing the abyssal pylon. “Tiny Traveler and Tiny Paimon?!” Saffron would have laughed to herself if she weren’t stressed- Paimon was already a Tiny Paimon. As she glanced up at the tree, her heart dropped. They weren’t there either. 

Saffron froze as she heard a voice behind her; “They are okay, they made it far enough that a messenger found them. They’re probably almost to the Stadium by now” Saffron could hardly bring herself to turn her head. She swore that she recognized the voice, but it couldn’t be…

“Jabari?” 

Saffron turned around slowly, not ready for the person who would be standing there. Surely enough, when Saffron looked up, her eyes met two eyes that looked identical to her own. Her older brother looked exactly like how she remembered him- his green hair (slightly darker than Saffron’s) was tousled, dressed in clothes from Port Ormos, with tan skin to show for how much he was outside. He smiled at his sister. “You’ve grown up”

Saffron stood there for a moment before remembering that she did, in fact, have arms and legs. *It really was him.* She smiled and ran over, throwing her arms around him. “Jabari, you- you’re really here?!” Jabari nodded, returning the hug. Saffron held on for a long time, even if it wouldn’t make up for the four years of missed hugs. Eventually, Saffron pulled back when the shock wore off. “You said that they are safe? The kids?” 

“They’re safe, don’t worry. You made sure of that” Hearing her brother’s voice was calming. She knew that he was telling the truth. She smiled, feeling content. That is, until a rifthound floated by. Saffron gasped as she put herself between the rifthound and Jabari, expecting an attack. When it floated by, a confused look rested on her face.

Jabari chuckled at her reaction. “Don’t worry, it won’t hurt you”

Saffron was weary as she turned back to her brother. *That was odd, it should have attacked. They always attack*

“Come on,” Jabari lightly grabbed onto Saffron’s arm “Let me take you to where there are less monsters”

Saffron nodded as she let her brother lead her further away from the abyssal pylon. Further away from the Scions of the Canopy. Further away from the danger.

Eventually, Jabari stopped, finding a rock to sit on. He patted the spot beside him, and Saffron sat down. She was still confused, but she felt safe. She smiled as she looked at the view in front of them. In the distance, the Mausoleum of King Deshret stood tall above the sands of the desert. The siblings were still in Natlan, but all that they could see in front of them was Sumeru. Suddenly, a wave of sadness passed by Saffron. *She missed home*.

Saffron looked at her brother, who was peacefully looking at the landscape in front of them. “I can’t believe that you’re here” 

Jabari looked back at Saffron and shrugged. “Someone had to watch over you, y’know. You can be pretty stupid sometimes”

“Hey!” Saffron lightly elbowed her brother's side in defense “I’m not stupid!”

Jabari laughed “I didn’t say that you *are* stupid, I said that you *can be*. Those are two very different things.”

Saffron just smiled and shook her head. “Okay fine- I have smart moments too, though!”

“Of course you do, you’re related to me”

Saffron huffed, rolling her eyes as Jabari laughed again. He had missed messing with his little sister like this.

The two of them sat in silence for a moment before Saffron asked the question that had been playing on her mind ever since she had seen him. 

“How are you even here? I… “ Saffron’s voice trailed off. *She thought that he was dead.*

“Well, little sister, I would think that us both being dead would mean that you could see me”

Saffron’s breathing froze, and she felt like her heart was going to pound out of her chest- dead? No, she wasn’t dead, she couldn’t be! She had fought, and she had fought *hard*. She couldn’t be…. Right? She looked at her brother, a panicked expression on her face. She was looking for any sign that he may be lying. His tone had almost sounded like he was joking, but she could tell that he was serious about the whole *being dead* part.

Jabari noticed the look of fear on Saffron’s face, and his eyes softened. “Oh…” Jabari sighed “I- I thought you already knew- Saffron… I’m so sorry”

Saffron just looked at Jabari, the fears from earlier in the day rushing back. Before she could truly start panicking, however, she felt warmth wrap around her as Jabari pulled her into a hug. He felt guilty as he held onto his sister, he shouldn’t have said that so light-heartedly when he had no clue whether or not she was aware of the situation. Saffron had always been the more emotionally intelligent one out of the two of them. He rested his chin on her head as she cried into his shoulder. He hummed a tune that he used to when they were kids. He didn’t remember when he learned it, but he knew that when they were younger it was usually effective in calming his sister down.

They sat like this for some time until Saffron’s breathing evened out. Eventually, she pulled away, just staring at the desert in front of them. She wiped the moisture from her face. What would happen now? Would her friends find out? Worse, would they try to look for her? She thought about what Harukaze had said earlier- She had made a promise that she would go back to Sumeru, and he said that he would come looking for her if she didn’t. She didn’t want him to go through that. She sighed. *She couldn’t believe that she had broken her promise.*

“Stop that” Saffron was pulled from her thoughts when her brother spoke. She looked at him “Stop worrying, I know that it doesn’t seem like it, but it’ll be fine”

Saffron didn’t know how he did that, it was some sort of hidden talent. Anytime that he said things would be okay, even if she had doubts, she always believed it.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As time passed, the two siblings talked about many different things. They talked about Saffron’s travels, and the people she had met along the way. They talked about her shop, and Saffron expressed that she wished Jabari had been able to try her coffee. They talked about her time here in Natlan, and how many terrifying things had happened here. Between being captured in a box, the capybara, and now this; Natlan was certainly not Saffron’s favorite place. Not even in the top five. 

Saffron didn't notice when a blast of fire shot into the sky behind them, turning the sky back to its normal state. Jabari, on the other hand, noticed. He knew that he probably wouldn’t have much longer with his sister, especially if the leylines were restored. So he made sure that the time he had was spent smiling and sharing stories with his favorite person.

“I wish that I could have given you a tour of Sumeru City” Saffron said, a sad smile on her face. “You would have loved it there”

“I can tell” Saffron’s brother looked at Sumeru longingly “It seems like an amazing place”

Saffron nodded “I never thought I would find somewhere to call home after everything that happened. Even though I travel alot… Sumeru City will always be my home now” She smiled. “I just wish that we could go there. Together”

The two sat in silence, looking at the temple and at everything beyond it. 

Suddenly, Saffron was pulled from her thoughts as she looked around, confused. “Jabari, can you hear that?”

Jabari looked around before shaking his head. He couldn’t hear anything. “Hear what?”

“There are people singing… it’s quiet, but it's there. Are you sure that you don’t hear it?”

When Saffron looked back at her brother, he had a smile that didn’t quite meet his eyes. “That song is only meant for you, sis”

Saffron looked at him, confused. “What do you mean?”

Jabari shook his head “Nevermind that. Just promise me something,”

“Anything.” 

“Never stop doing the things that make you happy. Saffron, never stop living” Saffron laughed at the audacity of the last statement

“Jabari- I can’t do that, I’m not living” As her laughing slowed, she looked at her brother’s serious expression. He wasn’t kidding. “I don’t understand” That was when the singing got louder. “…You really don’t hear that?”

Jabari pulled his sister in for what he knew was one last hug. “I’ll miss you, Saffron. I’ll see you later, I promise”

Saffron was confused, but happily melted into the hug. She closed her eyes. The music got louder and louder, until it sounded like people were singing all around her. When she opened her eyes, that was when she realized that they *were*.

“Jabari?” Saffron looked around. She hadn’t realized that she had gone from sitting to standing. Her surroundings were completely different- and more importantly, Jabari was gone. She slowly spun around, taking in her surroundings. She was in the middle of the stadium, and so were many other people who looked equally as confused as she was. Surrounding them were people in the stands singing. That was when she realized it; she had been saved by the Ode of Resurrection. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When the singing died down, and the pyro archon had given some sort of speech (Saffron couldn’t tell you what had been said, she was too busy thinking about Jabari) she watched as families flooded into the middle of the Stadium to reunite with their loved ones. The crowd wasn’t exactly easy to navigate, but she eventually managed to get to the edge. As she was about to silently leave, she was stopped. Physically. By tiny arms wrapped around her legs. She looked down and saw the two kids from earlier looking up at her, their little green eyes absolutely shining. 

“Miss Saffron! We made it to the Stadium! Just like you said” The little boy looked so proud as he talked. 

“Oh? Well, you two did an awesome job. I’m sure the traveler would be proud!”

The little girl shook her head “No, I want Furina to be proud! We want to play like the stories you told us” The boy nodded in agreement. 

“Well, I’m sure that Lady Furina and Monsieur Neuvillette would be just as proud” Saffron said, patting their heads. The kids both smiled and laughed, until both of their faces turned into pure shock. Saffron felt a hand on her shoulder, but before she could turn around,

“OHMYGODITSTHETRAVELER” The kids let go of Saffron and started bouncing up and down, pointing and all together freaking out over the person who had just walked up. 

As Saffron turned around, Paimon chimed in “And Paimon- you know, his trusty tour guide? Paimon is here too” She smiled at the kids, and they completely ignored her. 

“MR TRAVELER I GOT TO PLAY AS YOU THE LAST TIME” The boy shouted.

“But I’M better at it!” The girl replied, and then just as they had in the coffee shop, they started bickering. This time, though, Paimon was in on it too, defending the fact that she would be just as fun to play as. 

Saffron just smiled and shook her head at the three of them. She was glad that the kids were back to normal.

“Hey, it’s good to see you again!” Aether smiled at Saffron, but his expression dropped into one of concern when she fully turned to him. Her hair that was normally tied up was messily pooled around her shoulders, but that was only the start of it. She was covered in scrapes and bruises, with splotches of dirt decorating her clothes. To top it all off, there was a large half healed claw mark on her right arm that had a slightly purple tint to it. “Wait… *No*… Are you okay?” 

Saffron looked down at her clothes and the state she was in. Huh, she hadn’t fully noticed until now. “I don’t know if ‘okay’ is a good word for it… maybe confused is a bit better” She let out a nervous laugh

Aether looked her over, his look of concern strengthening when his eyes landed on her arm. He gently reached out and lifted it to get a better look. Normally, Saffron would just pull away and say that she was fine, but she didn’t have the energy for that. “Saffron, what happened?”

She looked over and nodded towards the kids, who were still having a spirited conversation with Paimon. She lowered her voice to ensure that they wouldn’t overhear, “I went back into the Scions to save my shop, but… instead, I found them. I had to protect them” She looked back at Aether “You probably would have done the same. The only difference being that you would have actually survived it” She laughed, but her smile didn’t meet her eyes. If she was safe and now alive, then why did this feel difficult to talk about?

Aether gently lowered Saffron’s arm, and took a step back. “Stay still, alright?” Saffron gave a confused look as Aether lifted his arm directly in front of him, pointing it towards her. She didn’t know what he was doing, but she trusted him, so she didn’t move a muscle. 

Suddenly, a soft light appeared between Saffron and the Traveler. Whatever he was doing was working; Saffron could feel the energy returning to her. It was almost as though she had just drank the most amazing cup of coffee of her entire life, which was saying something. When the light faded, he lowered his arm and stepped back over to Saffron, lifting her arm to examine again. “Is that better? I think the scratches here had some abyssal corrosion” 

Saffron nodded “I don’t know what you did, but it is *much* better. Thank you. You are always full of surprises, aren’t you?” 

Aether smiled, looking a bit more relieved now that Saffron’s arm seemed better. “You probably should get that properly checked out, it’s still a wound even if there’s no corrosion anymore.”

“I will, don’’t worry. My first stop when I get to Sumeru will be the Bimarstan”

Aether’s smile faded back into a concerned look. “You’re going to travel through the desert with that? You should really get it checked out here first.” 

“I know, but… I don’t want to spend more time around here than I have to after this. It’s time to go home for a while. I promise I’ll make it a quick trip home, and then I’ll get checked out. Other people here in Natlan need those medical supplies more than me”

Aether sighed. He knew Saffron well enough to know not to argue when she had her mind made up. “At least go to Gandharva Ville instead of the Bimarstan. The Forest Rangers are better equipped to deal with more… *unique* injuries like yours than the hospital is.” Saffron nodded in agreement. 

“Well, I should get going if I want to pack up my shop before it gets dark. That is, I’m assuming that I can reach the Scions safely now, right?” 

Aether nodded. “You should still be careful, but the invasion is over. You won’t need to worry about the abyss now”

Saffron started to turn away, but then stopped to look back at her friend. “Aether… I really hope that you find your sister soon. When you do, make sure that you give her a hug, okay?” 

Aether looked at Saffron, stunned. That was random. But, the sentiment was appreciated. *Just what had happened to Saffron to make her say that?* “I will” He said, reassuringly. Saffron then turned and left, leaving Aether to go back over to his travel companion and the children. Saffron softly smiled as she left the Stadium behind her; She was ready for a new chance at life, because she knew that Jabari would have it no other way.
