My daughter (F20) has a new job at a popular coffee chain. She‚Äôs worked in coffee shops before, but the menu at her new job is really intense. She finished thorough online training and passed, no problem. But when she‚Äôs physically making the drinks her anxiety kicks in. She immediately starts to second guess herself and freezes. This is causing her even more anxiety as she stresses out about messing up constantly, even when not at work.

She‚Äôs asked if she can keep a print out of the drink recipes handy until she feels more comfortable (she‚Äôs 2 weeks in). Her manager said no, that she needs to memorize it. I suggested she make a little cheat sheet to reference that she keeps in her pocket. She doesn‚Äôt want to go against her manager‚Äôs wishes.

She wants to quit, but I‚Äôm worried about her job history, as she‚Äôs already bounced from job to job  and dropped out of school. (And started new schools) in the past 2 years.

We both have diagnosed anxiety disorders and receive excellent care from our psychiatrists and regular therapy. I‚Äôve worked REALLY hard to not let my anxiety rule my life. We often discuss that the best solution for anxiety is to ‚Äúdo the hard thing‚Äù.

I want her to feel successful and like she has the grit to withstand life‚Äôs challenges. She‚Äôs amazing. And ultimately she‚Äôs an adult and this is her life. I trust her to make her own decisions and am here to support her. Not financially, but with love and encouragement.

I am asking you, oh wise crowd, for your ideas.

The stock promptly took a nosedive‚Äîbecause, let‚Äôs be honest, in the wireless world, it‚Äôs not about how much money you make, it‚Äôs about how many friends you have.

Let‚Äôs break down why customers are suddenly ghosting T-Mobile:

* **Price Lock Promises? More Like Price Lock Picked!** Remember when T-Mobile swore your bill would never go up? Well, surprise! That promise lasted about as long as your New Year‚Äôs resolution to eat more kale.
* **Bait and Switcheroo:** T-Mobile‚Äôs latest magic trick: ‚ÄúUpgrade to this shiny new iPhone! Oh, but you‚Äôll need to switch to a new plan that costs more than your monthly coffee addiction.‚Äù Ta-da! Now you see your savings, now you don‚Äôt.
* **The Return of Taxes and Fees:** Once upon a time, T-Mobile bragged, ‚ÄúThe price you see is the price you pay!‚Äù Now, they‚Äôre adding taxes and fees back in, because apparently, nostalgia for hidden charges is back in style.

Under CEO Mike Sievert, T-Mobile has been morphing into an AT&T and Verizon doppelg√§nger. Customers are noticing‚Äîand not in a ‚Äúwow, you look great!‚Äù kind of way. With these new, less competitive plans (now with extra taxes!), some are wondering if Sievert‚Äôs gone full supervillain, twirling his mustache while plotting the end of affordable phone bills.

So, to sum up: T-Mobile‚Äôs earnings are up, subscribers are down, and customers are left wondering if ‚ÄúUn-carrier‚Äù now just means ‚ÄúUn-recognizable.‚Äù

Aaminin ko part of it was my fault. 

Soooo this is my first time here in Reddit and this is my first rant hahaha shuta. Kaya medyo magulo to, sorry agad. 
I was in a Yellow Dating App since 2019 and never ko dinelete account ko doon, tho if may partner ako nagdedelete ako app.
And dahil nga I'm single nanaman I chose to reactivate my Yellow Dating App kasi bored si aketch eh di syempre swipe here, swipe there. Until I match with TAM (let's just call him this way pero since andito din sya sa reddit for sure pag nabasa nya tong story malalaman nyang sya ito).

He's a Freelancer, chinito, di matangkad di rin maliit, sakto lang yung katawan. He was soooooo kind *nung una*.

We started talking last March, inaya nya ako for a coffee and we met. Cute nga ng first date eh yung coffee date naging movie date rooor. At wag kayo second meet sa bahay agad, ganun ako ka open sa family ko when I'm dating someone.
We continued dating and akala ko genuine sya sa lahat ng pinapakita nya. We communicate, we are trying to have a deep connections, akala ko he really understand me and all our deep conversations.Kaya si tanga nafall ng very slight kay TAM at kaya ko sinasabing part of it is kasalanan ko ay dahil sinagot ko sya para lang mabigay ko ang sarili ko sa kanya.
Yes, aakuin ko yung sisi dun kasi tanga talaga ako sa part na yun. 

I was so frustrated and stressed sa work and some part of my life at sya yung kasama ko for the past weeks. Kaya nung time na feeling ko sasabog na ako I asked him if papayag syang mag hotel kami at syempre pumayag sya *kasi yun naman pakay nya una palang*.
We checked in, naging kami and we had sx. May paghatid pang naganap that night and sweet exchange of convos pa.

Kaya lang after that night naging distant na sya hanggang sa sineseen nalang nya ako hahahhaa. At ngayon blinock na nya ako. Sabagay nakuha naman nya gusto nya. 
I cried not because of him but because I disappoint myself at pumatol ako sa fck boi lol. Ngayon ko napatunayan ang salitang ""Pag gusto gagawa talaga ng paraan kahit maubos pa ang credit limit"" HAHHAHAAHAH.

What direction should I head into?,"\*\*Posted this else where but removed by monerator, repharse it to post it here again. Apologize for those who seen it.  
  
Relatively young, 27yo, with nearly 4 years of experience in the automation industry. Joined first job as a PLC software engineer after my graduation, kind of by accident as I was gaslighted I will be doing C# control programming rather than PLC. The company was an automation solutions provider, but somehow I not even get near to do any programming here. Instead, I was posted outstation 80% of the time for machine validation. Due to client policies, automation lines built by vendor A must be tested by vendor B to prevent fraud, and I am the vendor B here. Work is worthless, read instruction, execute instruction, tick on the box and repeat for 8 hours a day...

I quit after 8 months and landed into a Automation Engineer job at a Japanese MNC manufacturing plant. Mainly responsible for PLC development here. Job is rather chill and straight foward compared to others company in same industry. Basically no OT, no on-call, no shift work, barely only 5% outstation and most of it is supporting our overseas plants. Its literally a ""Dream Job"" in plc field.

But the Japanese culture burnt me out. Micromanagement here is next-level. **--->Everything<---**  is controlled here. Let me list some example, they control your standing posture, sitting posture, hand posture, hair length, hair color, this is personal attire side. Office wise, your screen must be landscape and perfectly parallel to your desk by the end of the day, no orientation of screen allow, no coffee on desk, no calender, no notebook, nothing. The desk must be completely clean and only laptop is allow. And I havent even include the work procedure, and office politic part... (For those who guessed who I am, leave me alone pls...)  


For for past 2 years I had been casually browsing and interviewing for every oppotunity I came across, and most of the time I can get offer immediately. But almost all of PLC/automation job require me to either 24/7 on call, or night shift, or frequent outstation...I do understand its a common issue in PLC field, but I just no longer felt the motivation to go thru all these again...

So I started self-learning software development along the way while casually searching for job. I have a degree in mechatronics, so it wasn‚Äôt too hard to get started. But dispite all the effort, nearly 800 leetcode, get some meaningless cert, completed some project for my portfolio display, I still failed to break into software engineering. Interviewed by some of the big player like TikTok, SAP, Meta, you name it. But never really sucess break into this industry... and judging from how uncertain the software market and how competative it is, I also change my mind and think it might not a wise move to hop into this industry at the moment...  


Now I felt completely lost, not sure what to do anymore. Which direction should I headed into? In other sub I was recommended to give a try in system integrator. But upon researching I actually not really have any idea what this path is working about? Like integrating process automation for client? Or building MES system for client? Or BMS also consider as system integrator here? 

Other than this route, any other possible way I can head into?",1,1745596756.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False

I don't know how to format an entire conversation so will simply bullet point things from memory, paraphrasing often. 

On Travis Hunter

-Amazing player, best ball instincts in a long time. Good kid, humble. 

-Saw him as best WR in the draft, but not Chase or Jefferson. Olave/Garret Wilson type. Worthy of being top WR in the draft. 

-Internally divided on two way playing. Found it a bit unnecessary and a gimmick. ""Not really what we do, and would only really do it to appease him"". Culture demands a lot out of the players, and to have a guy see the field when not spending the same amount of time working in that position and with that group as the other players is not the message they feel they need. 

-Discussed him only as a WR, did not factor DB into the decision, treated him as just a WR. 

On Mason Graham

-Eyed him during the entire process. Fills an immediate need at a high level.

-Had him ranked above Carter by the end of the process. Meeting and investigation into Carter wasn't up to the standard they expected. Carter not being able to work out disappointed them. Mason Graham killed his workout and they loved being around him. 

-Graham fills a weak spot, teams found it too easy to rush up the middle. 

-Graham fits the division. Lamar and Henry you have to stop the running. Bengals are explosive in the passing game but are vulnerable on their OL. Pittsburgh wants to out tough you in the trenches and make it ugly, and now we have a bully to push back.

-Graham was only option if trading back, had offers from Jets, Bears, 49ers and Cowboys, but knew they could not get Graham there. Jacksonville was the only trade that would allow selecting Graham, and they overpaid for number 2. It was an easy decision and they are delighted across the organization. 

-Went back 5 years (since this administration has been in Cleveland) and only DT they found rated as high as Graham was Jalen Carter. Blows everyone else in that timeframe away. 


A couple side notes

On Sanders falling

-Surprised Dart went before him, but knew slide was coming. When asked why, ""Did you see that party they set up for Sanders? Basically things like that"" 

-Will not rule out taking Sanders if that's what the board dictates (doesn't sound like at 33 right now). Does think he has talent and fit, not totally comfortable with whats in his orbit. Find him completely different when meeting him one on one than when around members of his personal team.

On trading up for Ward

-Think extremely highly of Ward. Only immediate game changer QB in the draft. Tried to get a deal for 2 done predraft, then use those picks to offer Titans, Titans not interested. ",8,1745596748.0,Browns,3,1.0,False

A boost can has 70mg caffeine per 250ml.

A single shot of espresso generally contains 60-75 mg of caffeine varying on the used blend. Drinks made from a single shot such as Americano's, Latte's etc have the same too obviously.

Using the same examples for sugar:

26g of sugar in a small redbull.

11g of sugar in a 250ml boost.

An average pump of syrup is 5g of sugar. So an average flavoured Grande iced drink from starbucks off the menu has 3 to 4 pumps usually, so thats 15g to 20g. I use this example as teens are more likely to get the flavoured drinks as opposed to straight sugar free americanos.

My point being that, in terms of caffeine, an average high-street coffee shop is near identical to a canned drink from a supermarket, whilst sugar is harder to say given the diversity in coffee drinks it's very easy to get 15-20g with just some syrups and whipcream.

Would you be in favour of coffee shops requiring ID for caffeinated drinks? Would this not make sense if we're trying to be objective about kids access to instant unattended caffeine?

Way back then I was only interested in drinking  cocktails and not so much in making them myself.  I remember the drink was really good and so now that I have a decent home bar I tried to look up the recipe online to see if I could make it myself.

The only thing I find when I search for 'Cereal Killer cocktail' are abominations with milk and actual cereal in them.  This drink had neither.  While it definitely had a breakfast vibe going, it was not milk based and it did not have actual cereal in it.  The only ingredients I actually remember are Apple Jack, and a dash of cold brew coffee, with the latter seemingly added at the end where you could visibly see it at the top of the drink.  Unfortunately, that is all I remember.  I am hoping someone might be familiar with something similar that is not milk based.",2,1745596477.0,cocktails,4,1.0,False

After researching online, I decided to test several AI headshot generators to see if they could deliver quality results. Here's what I found after trying 5 different services.

# What I tried:

I tested Aragon AI, BetterPic, HeadshotPro, Dreamwave, and AI SuitUp based on recommendations from other users. For each service, I uploaded between 8-15 selfies and paid between $29-$59 depending on the package.

# Features that impressed me:

* Most services delivered results in 1-2 hours
* All offered multiple backgrounds and outfit options
* Most allowed some form of editing after generation
* The better services provided 40-100 headshots per order
* Several offered human-assisted editing for specific changes

# The pros:

* **Huge time saver**¬†\- no need to book a photographer, get dressed up, or travel to a studio
* **Cost effective**¬†\- paid around $30-60 compared to $200+ for a pro photographer
* **Multiple options**¬†\- got dozens of different looks from a single order
* **Convenient**¬†\- could do everything from home in my pajamas

# The cons:

* **Inconsistent quality**¬†\- some services produced unnatural results with weird proportions
* **Facial feature issues**¬†\- several struggled with accurate eye color, smile, and glasses
* **Body proportions**¬†\- some made me look unnaturally thin or gave me a ""lollipop head""
* **Privacy concerns**¬†\- most services reserved the right to use my images for training
* **Not all photos usable**¬†\- typically only 10-20% of generated photos looked natural enough to use

# My personal experience:

Aragon AI gave me the most realistic results overall. The facial features were accurate, and the lighting looked natural. About 15 out of 100 photos were good enough to use professionally. The rest had small issues with my eyes or smile that made them look slightly off.

BetterPic was also solid but tended to make me look like a slightly airbrushed version of myself. Their backgrounds were excellent, especially the coffee shop and office options.

HeadshotPro had great variety but inconsistent quality. Some photos looked amazing while others had weird issues with my neck or hair.

Dreamwave surprised me with how accurately it captured my facial features, and I liked their casual style options the most.

AI SuitUp was the most professional-looking but limited in creative options. Perfect for corporate settings but not much variety.

# What worked best for me:

After trying all these services, I'd recommend Aragon AI or Dreamwave if you want the most natural-looking results. BetterPic is good if you want lots of background options. If you need strictly professional, corporate-style headshots, AI SuitUp delivered the most polished look.

For women, I'd suggest being extra careful - several users reported issues with body proportions (particularly making them look unnaturally thin).

# Final thoughts:

These tools aren't perfect, but they're improving rapidly. For the price and convenience, they're worth trying if you need professional headshots quickly. Just be prepared to sift through many options to find the few that really work.

Wednesday I had 2 cups of coffee in the morning. I was sluggish in the afternoon and wanted to go to the gym, so I made myself a coffee. But thinking about how bad my sleep was lately, I said nah and just went without. Walking up the stairs to the gym I usually feel nervous. This time I still felt nervousness but it was lower than usual. Like to a point where I was ‚Äûhuh? This is unexpected‚Äú. 


So I did some research and boy my mind was blown. Could the years and years of anxiety, depressive episodes and even panic attacks come from my caffeine intake?? In the last years since I started working from home my coffee consumption skyrocketed. From 2 cups a day to sometimes 6. And during that period my anxiety, depression and insomnia got progressively worse. Interestingly enough, no doctor ever asked about my caffeine habits‚Ä¶

1k7o7gw,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1k7o7gw/messy_by_lola_young_is_a_horrendous_song/,‚ÄúMessy‚Äù by Lola Young is a horrendous song,"I currently work at a national chain that primarily serves coffee and breakfast items. One of the hallmarks of our store is our in-house radio station, that plays primarily top-40 hits from the past 15 or so years. Quite frankly, I find most of these songs to be terrible, especially the more recent ones, as I have no nostalgia as I do for the songs from 8-12 years ago. (Once I hit middle school, I stopped listening to top-40 whatsoever and cultivate my own music tastes, primarily based upon classic rock, thanks Dad.) One song, however, sticks out to me as being one of the most ear grading, goofiest tracks I‚Äôve heard in the past 5 years or so; said song being ‚ÄúMessy‚Äù by Lola Young. 

If you don‚Äôt know who Lola Young is, I do not blame you. For me, it seems like she popped out of nowhere one day and was on the top half of the Billboard 100. From what I gather, she‚Äôs a British singer-songwriter that, like most ‚Äúself made‚Äù musicians these days, comes from money. Her father and mother both have connections in the industry, and her Aunt is a famous children‚Äôs book author. Not as bad as say, being the daughter of a hedge fund manager, but still, an obvious industry plant. 

As for the song itself, it‚Äôs an up-tempo tune that pulses at your eardrums. Personally, I do not like the beat. I think it sounds too thumping and goofy and mechanical, while also being very monotonous and repetitive. The best way I can describe it is being like an autistic marching band, if that makes any sense. Sonically, the song seems to sound okay, but I‚Äôve only really heard it through shitty speakers at my work, so I honestly can‚Äôt really speak on how to sounds on a real stereo system. The chorus goes on for a bit too long for my liking as well. The verses are done in an off-tempo style, which is kind of neat, but it doesn‚Äôt enhance the song whatsoever. 

The lyrics are very much Lola blaming her partner for all of her shortcomings. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm too messy, then you say I‚Äôm too neat,‚Äù Lola proclaims in the refrain. Apparently, the song is supposed to be an ‚ÄúADHD anthem,‚Äù which makes sense being as us in Gen Z *love* to label ourselves with disorders we know nothing about to appear cool. As an actually neurodivergent person, rather than being relatable, the tone of the lyrics come across as whiny and obnoxious, to be quite frank. Look, I understand the struggles of being neurodivergent, but sometimes you need to take accountability for your own actions. But what REALLY makes me dislike the song is Lola‚Äôs horrible singing. She goes off key a LOT, and it doesn‚Äôt add anything to the song. It honestly makes it more whiny and irritating. Instead of sounding like Amy Whinehouse (a comparison I hear a lot), she sounds much too British (something I actually dislike greatly are female singers who ‚Äúsound British‚Äù), and has a bit of that ‚Äúindie girl‚Äù inflection that also adds to the annoyingness of the song. 

If I could go the rest of my life never hearing another Lola Young track, I would be very, very happy. ",3,1745595994.0,TrueUnpopularOpinion,1,1.0,False

1k7o6cg,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1k7o6cg/im_confused_about_my_local_roasters_pourover/,I'm confused about my local roasters Pourover recipe,"As of recent I'm starting to really get into Pourover coffee. At home I'm using the Lance Hedrick 121 recipe with a KinGrinder P2(want to upgrade very soon) which gives me pretty decent results. They are balanced, a bit muddy but also aromatic and very enjoyable to me.

Yesterday I went to my favourite coffee shop in my area, who make the best filter coffee I have personally experienced(the owner also happens to be a 2 time german brew champion). As I was really interested in how the barista made such great coffee I straight up asked and he shared a rough recipe with me:

18g coffee on 220ml and 93 Degree Water
30 second bloom with 50ml water(Im assuming the amount)

Fill up to 100ml

Then to 180ml

And finally to 220ml

He didnt give me specific times to wait inbetween pours and no flowrates, but from what I saw it was very consistent and looked to be around 3-5ml/s.

So I bought a coffee from him, went home, tried it and well... it just did not taste good. It was slightly bitter, had too much body(his coffee is really tealike) and had almost none of the aromas I experienced at the coffee shop. I tried several times, even applying the ratio onto my standard recipe and every single time it didnt taste particularily enjoyable. What do you guys think is the secret? Are they having water which perfectly suits this style of brewing and if so, what kind of water would that be. Or is it my grinder?

I even tried the recipe on a preground coffee bought from them and it still didnt work, it actually tasted worse. Honestly Im a bit stumped by this. Im replicating their recipe almost 1 to 1 and the result is so incredibly different from the coffee in their shop that I cant even think some decent improvements would get me there.

I would be really thankful for any help! Maybe you guys can also share another technique to get some great aromatic coffee, or a way to get there.

Cheers!

Maybe I‚Äôm wrong here,  it it feels like she definitely did more than have an emotional affair and feels like she misses the other people and has a hard time now being around me at times or wanting to be sexually active with me (we have not had sex since September of last year and now blamed it on menopause, which might be accurate).  

She definitely doesn‚Äôt act like she did when she was cheating and I don‚Äôt want to overthink all this.  But I feel like she compartmentalizes our relationship ship and our daughter and has that ‚Äúfamily‚Äù life with us, but she acts and is different around her coworkers.

Any have guy friends, but I know she‚Äôs talked bad on me to him and text him about the time she‚Äôs having whenever me and her are at my family‚Äôs house or at an event.

We did couples therapy.  I did therapy.  Shes still in therapy.  Shes on antidepressants.  Again, just feels like she‚Äôs having a hard time adjusting back to our marriage because she did something physically with someone else and almost is guilty or doesnt want to  touch me in that way anymore.

I have not even been to the arraignment yet therefore there is no conviction. He damaged 2 tvs and a coffee table. When the cops came I was trying to protect him and said I didn‚Äôt remember what happened and he took advantage and got me arrested. He is going to drop the charges he submitted a request. However, my son was sleeping in the back room and did not hear anything nor witness. There has been 3 other arrests on his part 2 of them were while my son was conceived. The first one I was pregnant. I dropped all of those charges so there are no convictions. The prior 2 investigations with CPA were closed and no findings of abuse or neglect were found. This case is different for some reason. The CPS worker wanted me to take anger management and contact the DV advocate and get services because he said he can see that the dad was the agressor and didn‚Äôt understand why I got arrested. I refused services as the rights and responsibilities says I have the right and he and another worker confirmed that right. However, He kept pushing for it. One day he got so mad after I asked to be able to have an attorney present he slammed the door in my face. So after that I reported him and asked to not be contacted again unless I have an attorney present. That made him mad and he took my son away citing there was domestic abuse and that even though there is a no contact order it‚Äôs not safe for my son. We had court and I was appointed an attorney. My attorney argued he can see that this was in retalitiations to my letters reporting him and asking for an attorney. The CPS worker also mentioned I had a gun in the house that is not in the safe. It is important to note. I just purchased it. I put it in a chest drawer that is 6 feet tall out of reach of my son in a room that he does not have access to. When he visited he said that it is in a place a 2 year old could not get to. He told me I should put the clip somewhere else and suggested under the mattress. Well in court he lied and said the gun was in reach of my son and that I put the click in an unsafe place but it was where he told me to put it. I have never been abusive to my son. He is well taken care of and happy. But since I refused voluntary services they took him. The judge wants a speedy reunification. Thankfully he is with his grandma but they are making me do supervised visits as if I am a danger to him. Also, I have taken proactive measures and scheduled the DV services, took an anger management before the shelter hearing, and I got rid of the gun, and I told them I am going to sign up for parenting classes for high risk co parenting situations and this was something they never asked from me. All to show I am trying. I havent had my meeting with the case worker yet so I can see what the requirements are now. The judge asked for speedy ruinification. I have a mediation on the 12th of May. Could i get him back then? I then have an arraignment on 5/21 2 days before his birthday. If I don‚Äôt get him on 5/12 will they give him back then as I will be in complete compliance and I will also be doing extra things. I know I have to admit that I put him in an unsafe position and explain the measures I have taken to not let that happen again which I will do. But I was told in the precall before case management that I may not get him as that may be too soon and my son‚Äôs dad attorney said that that might be true and to not get my hopes us so I am feeling discouraged. It is important to note that dad has not complied with anything he didn‚Äôt even talk to them but I have done everything they asked always answered timely but I declined the voluntary services. I just want to know someone‚Äôs opinion. If the judge wants speedy reunification and I am going above and beyond can I get him back at mediation or at the arraignment?",2,1745595745.0,CPS,3,1.0,False
1k7o3dj,https://www.reddit.com/r/denverfood/comments/1k7o3dj/dairy_and_soy_free_food_report/,Dairy and Soy free food report!,"First, thank you to everyone who gave me advice, it was very appreciated! Also, we loved Denver food. I read it wasn't a great food scene but we were really pleased with our visit! We were so appreciative that almost everyone had allergy information easily available, often on a printed sheet. It made ordering easy. 

Here's what worked, for anyone else searching or interested! Traveling with an allergic toddler and two tweens. 

Onefold - my toddler daughter loved her rice, beans  and guac but my tweens bacon fried rice was an absolute show stopper! The coffee was also wonderful after an early flight. 

Two Hands - they were great with the allergy and the burgersvand crispy fries were a hit with the kids. Itp wasn't mind blowing but it did the trick!

Jelly Cafe - their gluten free pancakes are also dairy free, which is a rare treat for my daughter! We had the blueberry lavender and it was great. My older kid loved the cinnamon roll pancakes.  My husband's burrito was decadent. 

Chook - everyone loved this one! I wish they had a location closer to us. My one child adored the soup and the other inhaled an enormous amount of rotisserie chicken. I loved the seasonal roasted carrot salad. 

Stowaway - so good! My maple coffee with oatmilk was decadent and my husband's waffle with rhubarb was amazing. The baby's coconut and wild rice porridge with mango was a sleeper hit! Everyone liked it. 

Edgewater public market - I had Konjo Ethiopian and my kids enjoyed their pizza. The baby inhaled some injera. I'm not sure if was the best Ethiopian I've ever had but it was a great safe option! 

Happy Cone - the coconut based vegan ice cream (we tried mixed berry) was a delight. So decadent.

Call Your Mother - tasty latkes, the maple and black pepper bagels were great, as were the zaatar. Coffee was only so-so. 

Kike's Tacos - another hit. Great birria and Spanish rice. The big kids took several trips to the salsa bar and the baby ate yet more guac, her favorite. 

Little Man Ice Cream - the only disappointment. I read it was vegan but unfortunately the only thing they had was soy based. My older kids liked theirs but the baby and I had to skip. 

In Colorado springs, we had very solid dairy free pupusas at Monses and BBQ at Cereberus Brewery. No complaints about either, especially since it was warm enough for the patio. 

Thanks again Denver! Despite all that hiking, we gained a few pounds of happiness üòÇ ",0,1745595713.0,denverfood,0,0.5,False

‚ÄúIt looks like everyone is here now.‚Äù Lucas‚Äôs voice rang out, cold and commanding, over the gathering crowd.¬†

‚ÄúToday, we gathered here to bear witness to the trial of Ella Fitzgerald, former protector to the Alpha and Luna of Redstone Pack.‚Äù

The murmur of voices filled the council chamber like the hum of an angry hive, emotions thick in the air‚Ä¶surprise, anger, disbelief. I straightened my back, my eyes locked on Lucas, the man who was once family. His expression was unyielding, a wall of disdain. He scanned the room, pausing briefly on each elder and warrior, before his eyes found me again, hard as steel.

‚ÄúDo you swear on the Goddess‚Äô name, Ella, that you will tell the whole truth during this trial?‚Äù His voice struck like an accusation.

Standing beside him was Dan, his new Beta. I felt his piercing deep blue eyes burn into me, a silent judgement hanging between us. A tingle ran down my spine, and I forced myself to meet his eyes.¬†

Could he be my fated mate? But if he was, why did he stand there, watching as if I were a stranger?

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said, keeping my voice steady even though I felt far from calm. ‚ÄúI swear.‚Äù

Lucas nodded, his expression unreadable, like a mask hiding his thoughts.

‚ÄúAnd how do you plead?‚Äù

For a moment, the weight of every eyes pressed down on me, my heart hammering in my chest. They all wanted to believe I‚Äôd failed, that I‚Äôd betrayed our pack. But I wasn‚Äôt guilty. I hadn‚Äôt killed the people I loved.

‚ÄúNot guilty,‚Äù I said, the words clear and firm.

The room fell silent, my voice lingering in the heavy air. Lucas‚Äôs jaw clenched, his expression darkening. Just as he opened his mouth to respond, my mind slipped spontaneously back to that terrible day‚Ä¶

\*\*\*Flashback\*\*\*

I remember that day vividly like it was just yesterday, every detail very clear in my mind. The howls and growls were roaring around us, and as I turned, I saw her, my Luna, pinned down by a ferocious rogue wolf. I tried to reach her, but the wolf guarding her struck me hard, sending me sprawling to the ground. Pain shot through my arm as I heard it snap, broken. I couldn't shift, and I felt helpless.¬†

Then I heard her scream. I looked up just in time to see the rogue sink its teeth deep into her neck. ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù I cried, trying to scramble up, but I was quickly surrounded by at least ten wolves. They circled, moving in closer, their eyes fixed on me like I was prey. My stomach clenched. I was trapped. The attack came in waves. I dodged the first few, but one sank its teeth into my leg, tearing flesh. I could feel myself growing weaker as they lunged at me from every direction, clawing and biting. I fell to my knees, beaten, barely able to fight back.¬†

Claws slashed my back, arms, legs. I knew I'd failed. I couldn't protect her, couldn't even protect myself. The words echoed through my mind: You failed. You were supposed to protect them.¬†

The Alpha and Luna of the Redstone Pack had been my family. I was a little girl when they found me at the edge of their territory, bruised and abandoned. Luna took me in, cleaned me up, and told the Alpha I'd be staying. They never officially adopted me, but they raised me as one of their own. They loved me like a daughter.¬†

Their son, Lucas, was three years older, and though we didn't always get along, we grew up like siblings. As teenagers, we trained together. Lucas, as the future Alpha, focused on pack responsibilities, while I excelled in combat. I decided I wanted to be a warrior, and by the time I was fifteen, I was the top-ranked female fighter in our pack.¬†

When I turned seventeen, Alpha and Luna asked me to be their protector. It was the highest honour I could imagine, a role I accepted with pride. For nearly nine months, I kept them safe, fending off minor threats, and everyone knew not to mess with me. Almost everyone in the pack was afraid of me, and I was proud of it.¬†

But on my eighteenth birthday, everything went wrong. We planned to celebrate with a run through the pack lands, my first with my newly discovered wolf, Melo. But as soon as we crossed the boundaries, I sensed danger. Rogues poured out of the trees, faster than I could react. None of us could shift, something I couldn't explain, and we were ambushed.¬†

I fought as hard as I could, but there were too many of them. They injured the Alpha first, and then me, pinning me down. I'll never forget Luna‚Äôs scream as one of the rogues went for her throat. The rogues left me alive, barely. They left me to feel the weight of my failure. When they found us an hour later, I was a mess, physically and mentally. The Beta and Lucas questioned me, but when I told them I couldn't shift, Lucas didn't believe me. It felt like an accusation.¬†

Once I recovered, I went to their graves, but even that moment of grief was stolen from me. Lucas and his Beta, Dan, dragged me away to question me again. Lucas, now Alpha, looked at me with anger and betrayal. They'd trusted me, and I hadn't protected them.¬†

\*\*\*Back to Present\*\*\*

A harsh voice jerked me back to the present, tearing me from the horror of that memory. Lucas glared down at me, his face twisted with contempt.

‚ÄúYour failure cost me the lives of my parents,‚Äù he spat, his voice dripping with fury. ‚ÄúAnd yet you dare claim innocence?‚Äù

Desperation flared in my chest, raw and desperate. I couldn‚Äôt let him believe I was guilty. ‚ÄúLucas, please! It was an ambush. I was outnumbered and overpowered. There was nothing I could do!‚Äù

My gaze shifted to Dan, my last hope. I searched his eyes, begging silently for any sign of compassion. But his face was unreadable, cold and distant. His motionlessness was like a dagger to my heart, and I could feel something break inside me.¬†

I kept on asking within me if he was my mate, the one the Goddess had chosen for me.

Why wouldn‚Äôt he defend me?

Dan‚Äôs voice broke the silence, detached and hollow.¬†

‚ÄúAlpha Lucas, I believe it‚Äôs time to deliver judgment.‚Äù

Lucas‚Äôs eyes gleamed with satisfaction as he stepped forward, holding a silver bangle in his hand. My stomach twisted in fear. I knew what that meant: a punishment that was worse than a life sentence.

‚ÄúFrom this day forward, you are stripped of your rank,‚Äù Lucas declared, his words cutting through me like a knife. ‚ÄúYou are nothing but an omega now. A disgrace to this pack.‚Äù

He snapped the silver bangle around my wrist, and I felt a searing coldness spread through my veins, weakening me and draining my strength. I bit down on a cry, refusing to give them the satisfaction of seeing my pain. But the sting of the silver was nothing compared to the betrayal, Lucas, my only family, was casting me out like I was nothing.

Dan stepped forward, his face unreadable as he looked at me. His voice was soft but laced with ice.¬†

""Ella, there's one more thing."" Dan paused and looked directly at me. The room fell silent, and I felt a painful emptiness growing inside me.

‚ÄúI, Dan Stafford, reject you as my mate.‚Äù ‚ÄúI can't accept you because I value my position as the new Beta‚Äù.¬†

I felt a sharp pain in my chest, so sharp that I couldn't breathe well again.

My heart felt like it was shattering into tiny pieces. I held my chest tightly and cried silently. It felt like the bond between us was breaking, like a delicate piece of glass.

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶No‚Ä¶No‚Ä¶‚Äù The word escaped in a broken whisper, barely audible through the agony ripping through my soul. Dan‚Äôs expression didn‚Äôt soften, didn‚Äôt waver. He simply turned, walking away without a single glance back.

Lucas leaned in close, his smirk like poison. His voice dropped to a chilling whisper.

¬†‚ÄúWelcome to your new life, Ella.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou're now one of the least people in this pack.‚Äù

My knees trembled and hit the cold stone floor as I collapsed, my heart pounding heavily, my vision blurring with unshed tears. The pain was consuming, wrenching, a crushing, unbearable weight of pain and betrayal that threatened to swallow my whole body.¬†

As the cold bite of the silver continued to weaken me, I whispered to myself, I‚Äôll rise from this. I‚Äôll find a way to make them all pay for what they‚Äôve done.

I was lost in thoughts; a chill ran through me as I realised something terrifying: my wolf was gone. Melo has.... vanished. Without her, I‚Äôm as vulnerable as a mere human, stripped of the strength and powers I once had.

Am I even a werewolf anymore if I can't feel her?

# Chapter 2

Ever since that day, the pack has been mistreating and bullying me. They beat, starve and make me clean the pack house day in and day out.¬†

Sarah Luke, Lucas' mate, has vowed to make it worse for me, not that I can't beat the hell out of her, but her mate, my brother, recently slapped my cheek because I ‚Äúmistakenly‚Äù did not make a mistake, I intentionally spilt a hot coffee on her. My soul left me the second time because of the heaviness of the slap. That was when I knew that there was no place for me here anymore; I couldn't fight this battle alone.¬†

I was scrubbing the kitchen as my knees were raw against the floor, and the bruise on my cheek throbbed.¬†

The front door of the pack house opened and my nose hit me with sandalwood and smoky lavender scents that always make my body shiver. I was having a peaceful day but it is like it is about to be filled with conflict.¬†

""You missed a spot,"" Sarah sneered, kicking over my bucket of water. ""Clean it again.""

My stomach growled. ""I haven't eaten since‚Äî""

""Shut up!"" Sarah grabbed my hair. ""Ungrateful omega. After what you did to Lucas's parents, you deserve worse.""

""I didn't do anything,"" I whispered, but she was already walking away, leaving me in a puddle of dirty water.

‚ÄúI need to leave this place‚Äù! ‚ÄúI can't do it anymore‚Äù! I yelled to myself.

During the night, I went into my tiny room beside the kitchen, grabbing the late Luna's old hoodie that she gave me. Her scent still lingered of vanilla and sunshine.¬†

""I miss you, momma,"" I murmured, touching the worn fabric.

My fingers traced the silver bangle on my wrist. Lucas's way of keeping me powerless and helpless.¬†

The memory of his voice rang in my ears: ""You'll never escape, little sister.""¬†

""Watch me, ""I whispered, slipping on my shoes.

The cold floor touched my feet as I tiptoed through the dark hallway. Each shadow made my heart skip. At the back door, I stopped to listen.

""Going somewhere?""¬†

My heart skipped as I turned round. Dan stood there, his face half-hidden in darkness.

""I..."" My voice trembled. ‚ÄúPlease let me go, don't tell Lucas.""

He stepped closer, and I flinched. But his eyes held something unexpected ‚Äì sadness?

I didn‚Äôt let it bother me. After all, he rejected and humiliated me in front of everyone. Why will I care?¬†

His silence was enough to be the answer.

Does he still want me as a mate?

""Go,"" he finally said. ""I'll say I never saw you.""

I hesitated. ""Why?""

""Because I..."" He looked away. ""Just go. Before I change my mind.""

The night cold air hit my face as I ran into the woods. Branches whipped my skin, roots caught my feet, but I kept running. Anything was better than staying trapped in this pack.

A deep groan stopped me in my tracks. I strained my eyes and saw a man covered with bruises. Although he doesn't look like any of us werewolves, he looks so different.

Despite his wounds, something about him made my heart race.

""Help..."" His voice was barely a whisper, but it sent shivers down my spine.

His piercing silver eyes caught mine, and slight tingles passed between us despite being strangers. Even injured, there was something magnetic about him, although it was not strong enough to know if he was my second chance mate. Maybe because of the bangle I can't fully access the bond.¬†

""What's your name?"" I knelt beside him, suddenly aware of how close we were.

""I .. ne..ed‚Ä¶.. blood,"" he struggled to say, his grip tightening on my hand.¬†

""You're... you're‚Ä¶.. m.‚Ä¶.?""

Without listening to what he was struggling to say, I bit my wrist hard. ""Drink,"" I pressed it to his lips. ‚ÄúI hope it heals you.‚Äù¬†

As my blood flowed into him, warmth spread between us. His eyes never left mine, and something primal awakened between us. His grip strengthened as life returned to his body.

""Thank you,"" he breathed, sitting up slowly.

I was wondering if I should ask him why he was all alone in the woods but before I started, he asked.¬†

""Can you tell me why you're in the woods so late at night when you have a pack?"" he asked, his voice soft but direct.

I turned away, feeling vulnerable. The memories threatened to overwhelm me. My hands moved instinctively to fan my face, desperate to hold back the tears.

""I don't know why I am feeling down like this,"" I burst out, frustration and shame mixing in my voice.

His hand touched my shoulder gently. ""You know, crying doesn't make you weak.""

Those words broke something inside me. Hot tears erupted, and years of pain and hurt poured out. I couldn't believe I was crying in front of a stranger, but oddly, I felt relieved to have someone ‚Äì anyone ‚Äì hear my pain.

He placed his hand lightly on my back, tapping repeatedly as the tears continued. His touch was comforting and steady.

When the tears finally subsided, I pulled back, embarrassed. ""I'm sorry,"" I mumbled, trying to compose myself. ""I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable.""",1,1745595601.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

1k7o0n4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1k7o0n4/a_story_about_the_uns_roosevelt/,A Story about the UNS Roosevelt,"I posted this as a reply to a writing prompt in r/humansarespaceorcs, figured I'd post it in its entirety for everyone to enjoy here.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

""Entering realspace in the Orion Beta system... warp complete. Navigation green, Exit point deviation within 1.5 light seconds.""

¬†

""Communications green. UNS Lima and UNS Monaco reporting in.""

¬†

""Passive sensors online, confirming Turaal fleet in high orbit over Orion Beta 5. Three contacts broadcasting in the asteroid belt... appear to be civilian mining vessels. No other contacts within 5 light minutes. Ready for active search on your command, captain.""

¬†

Captain Alyson Miles glared at the sensor board in front of her showing the planetary system and the few contacts they were able to identify. Smooth lines indicated the orbital path of the 7 planets in this system, a few moving ships, and would soon show her extremely small fleet's path. Having come in to the system above the orbital plane, they were able to bypass the asteroid belt and any stellar objects they chose to avoid, but would have to take a much longer, roundabout path to use a gravity slingshot to generate high velocity. Fortunately, this also meant none of the enemy ships would have that option, either. They'd have to chug along without any help to meet the UNS Roosevelt as she sailed in toward the large Turaal colony on Virtume, the fifth planetary body in the system.

¬†

""Negative, ensign. No active search yet,"" Captain Miles said. Then, more quietly, muttered, ""Not like they don't already know we're here.""

¬†

""Incorrect, Captain,"" piped up an incongruously warm and young voice from seemingly directly by the sensor table, and also everywhere at once. ""The radiation from the hyperspace bubble collapse will only be apparent to the fleet over Orion Beta 5 in 18.396 minutes. They cannot yet have noticed our arrival.""

¬†

Alyson switched her glare from the sensor table to the young woman standing (...floating?) next to it. Roosevelt, although she preferred ""Teddy"", seemed every bit as real as those standing near her, except for the light blue haze barely visible around all her edges, even the soles of her feet. They didn't quite make contact with the deck plating. They couldn't, as a hologram, make contact with anything, leading to the odd intrusive thought at the back of Alyson's mind about whether, technically, the AI spent all her time floating, no matter how perfectly she seemed to ""stand"" at attention.

¬†

Mentally shaking herself to banish the short wandering thought, Captain Miles elected to ignore Teddy's statement and instead announced, ""Half ahead, plot a course toward Virtume. When the Turaal fleet moves to intercept, send me the timeline."" After hearing an affirmative response, she turned and walked toward the meeting room starboard of the bridge. ""Teddy, call the XO and Space Wing Commanders for a meeting in the Bridge Ready Room in 5 minutes.""

¬†

""Aye, Captain,"" came the response from both behind Alyson, and in front of her. As she crossed the threshold into the ready room, Teddy already stood waiting next to the captain's chair. New sailors often found it disconcerting to walk away from a person just to see them waiting in the next room. Alyson had gotten used to it. Teddy would, in fact, be interacting ""live and in person"", or a close facsimile thereof, with literally thousands of personnel in multiple hundreds of locations throughout the ship, right now. Walking over to the dispenser, Alyson grabbed a cup of hot black coffee and sat down in her chair, looking up at the room‚Äôs only other current occupant.

¬†

The UNS Roosevelt's AI personality chose to appear as a young woman, despite her historical namesake's gender and the ship's age. Christened and starbound 48 years ago, the ship was still the pride of the fleet, having been through multiple refits and substantial repairs after having suffered what should have been catastrophic damage three separate times. Still, each time, she had managed to limp back home with many of her crew still alive. Instead of choosing an older appearance to go with her record, Teddy had elected to show small but noticeable scarring on her face and hands, the only areas of visible ‚Äúskin‚Äù she had, choosing to explain them as ‚Äúbattle scars‚Äù when questioned. Given the few minutes time of waiting, Alyson‚Äôs mind began to wander again, and she found herself wondering if AIs in general, or perhaps this one in particular, had a concept of vanity, and if given the choice herself as a human if she would choose to show scarring instead of the beginnings of crow‚Äôs feet around her eyes and worry lines across her forehead she saw in the mirror each day. At least she didn‚Äôt have laugh lines, she thought sarcastically. Her Executive Officer, Stuart Jeffries, walked into the ready room, banishing the less and less productive train of thought, shortly followed by Space Wing Commander Paul Fong, and his second, Deputy Space Wing Commander Marissa Tomlinson. A crisp salute followed, as the commanding crew of the UNS Roosevelt had yet to become quite comfortable with Captain Miles. Many of the crew, including her new captain and many of the commanding officers, had only recently been assigned to the supercarrier after her most recent year-long stay in a repair bay, and the new captain‚Äôs reputation as ‚Äúdemanding‚Äù had preceded her.

¬†

Dismissing pleasantries entirely, Captain Miles started right in. ‚ÄúWe have arrived in the Orion Beta system. Our mission is to pacify the Turaal fleet in orbit above Orion Beta 5, known as Virtume, with minimal losses, and no damage to the colony. Teddy, please explain.‚Äù

¬†

Teddy nodded to the captain and opened a display of the colony in question above the meeting table. ‚ÄúVirtume is a colony founded 72 Earth years ago by the Turaal in the Orion Beta system. Despite its initial founding by the Turaal, human infrastructure investment in the colony has been significant in the past 57 years, and the colony government at this point is mainly human. It produces valuable mineral exports and is home to an estimated 200,000 civilians of various species, mainly humans. Its position in the Orion Beta system places it in a gray area of the galaxy claimed by both the Turaal Astral Conglomerate and the United Nations of Terra due to proximity to both homeworlds. Despite ongoing hostilities, we are not currently at war with the Turaal Astral Conglomerate and are under strict orders NOT to fire first. We cannot be seen as the aggressor in this conflict. That said, we are authorized to defend ourselves if fired upon. UN Command has instructed us to make it clear that the Orion Beta system is under the control of the UN without giving the TAC cause to escalate the conflict.‚Äù

¬†

XO Jeffries frowned at this, asking the question on the tips of several tongues, ‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre supposed to pacify a hostile force, why have we brought so few ships? No offense to the Roosevelt intended, she‚Äôs a beauty, but an overwhelming display of force would be far more likely to keep the Turaal from engaging us in the first place. As it is, with so few escorts, it almost seems like we‚Äôre hanging ourselves out on a line as bait for the bastards to nibble on.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúLanguage, please,‚Äù chided Teddy automatically. ‚ÄúThe Orion Beta system is only one of many systems to which the UN has deployed forces. Overwhelming force in one system would leave many others with insufficient defense.‚Äù

¬†

Alyson watched Stuart Jeffries physically fight to keep from rolling his eyes at the seemingly canned response. He met her gaze, and she gave him a look that all but said ‚ÄúWhat did you expect from an AI built by the UN?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù Stuart continued, ‚ÄúWe must make do with what we have. The Lima and the Monaco are both reliable destroyers. Do we know what we are up against?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúIntelligence reports from Virtume indicate a fleet of no more than 11 vessels, including support ships, and a less than 15.3% chance the Turaal have deployed a carrier or battleship of their own to this system. If a Polaris-class or larger vessel is present, our probability of success in open conflict while still leaving the UNS Roosevelt mission-capable do not exceed 38.79%.‚Äù

¬†

Silence hung in the room for several moments as the three officers digested that bit of news. Captain Miles turned to CSG Paul Fong and asked, ‚ÄúPaul, you have experience with the Turaal, what are your thoughts on how we come out on top of this?‚Äù

¬†

Paul turned his head to the side and made a face as though he had bitten into something unpleasant before replying, ‚ÄúCaptain, I believe we are in a much worse situation than Teddy has expressed. Their ships aren‚Äôt incredibly fast, they don‚Äôt carry much in the way of short distance or kinetic weaponry, and they are certainly not built to withstand punishment the way ours are, but they are absolute monsters when it comes to communications disruptions. I was Deputy Operations Officer aboard the UNS Slate Barrier at the Hunter Nebula conflict, and the one thing I can tell you for certain is that our ships could barely communicate with each other from the moment they were in range of the Turaal fleet. The Roosevelt is a carrier, we fight at long distances with hundreds of small craft, which takes immense amounts of communication, so much so that we can‚Äôt even do it all ourselves. The Roosevelt herself organizes all flight paths around the ship to create efficient docking and undocking. Throw some communications jamming in there and our flight leads will be flying blind. None of those fighters carry the capital-class communications equipment needed to burn through heavy jamming. They‚Äôd have better luck shining a flashlight out of the cockpit than trying to communicate on the radio with us.‚Äù

¬†

Alyson narrowed her eyes as her Space Wing Commander went on. This was valuable information, yet it was also the last thing she wanted to hear. After a pause, she asked, ‚ÄúAnd our advantages?‚Äù

¬†

CSG Fong‚Äôs eyes widened as he realized he had completely failed to answer the captain's question, quickly adding, ‚ÄúSorry sir! We hit harder than they can, that‚Äôs a sure thing! Their weapons rely almost entirely on line-of-sight engagement, they barely use any tracking weapons due to the sheer volume of jamming they‚Äôre throwing out, and their defenses are based almost entirely on not being where we‚Äôre shooting, sir. If I understood what I overheard from the weapons officers, getting a lock on their ships without lighting them up with high-powered active sensors is nearly impossible, and they‚Äôre built light enough to move out of the way of regular kinetic rounds with little effort. If we can hit them with enough targeting power, we can hit them hard enough to disable them, sir.‚Äù

¬†

Captain Miles heard all the unsaid problems behind that all-important ‚Äúif‚Äù, however. Space is big, she knew. Very big. The UNS Roosevelt, a behemoth over 7km long and more than a kilometer wide, larger than nearly any other human-built spacefaring vessel, might as well have been a speck of dust in comparison to the vast emptiness of space. Aiming a line-of-sight weapon at normal engagement ranges was completely impossible without the aid of highly specialized sensors and a significant amount of computing power to calculate target and projectile velocities to ensure those actually met multiple minutes later and hundreds of kilometers away. It also meant that it was just as important to make sure that you weren‚Äôt exactly where the enemy calculated you to be, and the first step in that process was to not be identified clearly. Naturally, the easiest way to be picked out against the vast darkness of space was to be broadcasting anything, especially high-powered targeting radar. By targeting the ships in the Turaal fleet, they would be broadcasting their exact location. Alyson recalled something she had read in an antique military manual once many years ago; ‚ÄúTracers work both ways,‚Äù it had said. Apparently this game of ‚Äúsee and don‚Äôt be seen‚Äù had even been important back in the days of her ancestors. She wasn‚Äôt outgunned, but she couldn‚Äôt use those guns without inviting more return fire than she was willing to deal with. This was an unusual situation for a carrier to be in, for sure. Typically the Space Wing would take care of both targeting and engagement by deploying several wings at once with varying loadouts, but with the Turaal jamming all their communications, the wings would not be able to communicate once they left the carrier. Deployment and recovery would be slow, light craft would be unable to screen for heavy craft, and losses would be significant. Even if they came out of the engagement with a win, they would be poorly equipped to continue the mission of providing security to Virtume afterward. Alyson turned to Deputy Space Wing Commander Tomlinson. ‚ÄúTomlinson, thoughts?‚Äù

¬†

Marissa hesitatingly voiced a thought, ‚ÄúDo we have any way to avoid open conflict with the Turaal? Our mission parameters are to pacify, not outright destroy, correct?‚Äù

¬†

Teddy confirmed, ‚ÄúYes, our mission is to pacify the Turaal and provide security for the system without escalating the conflict. A diplomatic solution is within those parameters, if unlikely.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúAre the Turaal unwilling to negotiate?‚Äù inquired Fong.

¬†

‚ÄúThe Turaal are excellent tacticians and appear to rely a great deal on their own shipboard AI to compute conflict outcomes. If they believe they have the upper hand, they will pursue conflict until a positive outcome no longer appears more likely than a negative outcome. Unless specifically ordered to do so, they will not negotiate while they have the military advantage.‚Äù

¬†

At that moment, a chime sounded at the door. ‚ÄúEnter,‚Äù called out Captain Miles.

¬†

One of the communications officers walked in and announced, ‚ÄúCaptain, the Turaal fleet is moving to intercept us. Estimated time to one light second is 47.5 hours.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúThank you, dismissed,‚Äù replied Alyson. At the range of 1 light-second, nearly 300,000km, real-time communications were possible, but engagement was not. The fastest (in realspace) manmade object ever, the ancient Parker Solar Probe, would still take nearly half an hour to cover 1 light second, and it only reached those velocities through a series of gravity slingshots. Since she didn‚Äôt have a spare series of planets in her back pocket, she didn‚Äôt need to worry about anything in this engagement reaching those velocities. There was also no way to warp to the enemy; calculating hyperspace trajectories near a star system was like balancing on the edge of a cliff, and anything with a star-sized gravity well was that cliff. Get a little bit too close to something with that kind of gravitational pull and the warp exit point would simply ‚Äúroll downhill‚Äù into the star‚Äôs gravity well, and you‚Äôd pop out in the middle of the star. Supposedly. According to the math nerds who ran the warp bubble, at least. Nobody had ever actually come back out of a star after a failed jump and gone, ‚ÄúOops!‚Äù, but there were very strict rules about how close warp trajectories could be to a stellar object, and their exit point at the outskirts of the Orion Beta system was already at that limit. After the communications officer had left the room, Captain Miles looked at her team and said, ‚ÄúAlright, we‚Äôve got 47 hours to come up with a plan and implement it.‚Äù She looked at her wristpad and noted the time, the three other officers doing the same. She frowned at that motion, thinking, while the officers discussed their plans‚Ä¶

¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see why we can‚Äôt launch everything with a plan to engage. That sort of overwhelming firepower could deal with anything they throw at us.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúThe losses would be astronomical! With no communications, each wing, each pilot, would be on their own! Once they engaged, the wings wouldn‚Äôt even be able to stick together! You can‚Äôt just look out the window and see your allies out there in the black, it‚Äôs all on the pilot‚Äôs HUD.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúOn that note, it could only be human pilots. AI pilots require a constant datalink to operate, without it they‚Äôll just shut down or return to base. They‚Äôre very explicitly programmed to not engage targets without command target confirmation to prevent enemy override and re-targeting of friendlies. Even the localized drone wing supplements would be less than useless once no longer in physical contact with their corvette!‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúNot to mention the logistical nightmare! We have to prep munitions transport from storage at least 5 minutes before docking, and in order of docking, to even have a chance at redeploying craft quickly! If they can‚Äôt communicate their munitions expenditure before docking, each refit will take half an hour at best!‚Äù

¬†

Captain Miles tried to tune them out as she stared at her wristpad. She watched the local ship time, 14:32, tick upward to 14:33, still matched to a planet‚Äôs rotation an entire solar system away. Everyone on the vessel adhered to the same time, set by the local time of the UN headquarters back on Earth. It made it possible to rotate shifts effectively even when they didn‚Äôt have a star overhead to tell them when to get up and when to go to sleep. Why had watching her officers all look at their wristpads tickled her brain? What about it mattered? She‚Äôd learned long ago to listen to her instincts instead of ignoring them, and she needed to figure out why the time mattered. It was more than just telling her she only had 47 hours to figure out how not to lose a supercarrier, and probably her career, to what should be a minor engagement. Communications. She needed to have communications between her ships, and this tiny, low-powered communications device on her wrist held the answer, if she could just see it. She watched her wristpad tick up another minute. What did they used to be called? Watches? Alyson had learned in elementary history class about the early industrialization of Earth, and from what she understood, humans had even used these wrist watches back then, before they did anything actually important. They just told the time.

¬†

‚Äú‚Ä¶Captain?‚Äù CSG Fong repeated. Alyson startled, realizing the three officers had been quietly awaiting her answer to a question she hadn‚Äôt heard.

¬†

Allowing herself an unusual (for her) sly grin, Captain Miles elected not to ask for a repeat of the question, instead simply saying, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it. I‚Äôve got a plan. Have all available strike craft loaded and ready for full EWAR and capital ship engagement within 35 hours. Tell the flight crews to be ready for an in-person mission briefing on flight deck 13 in 45 hours, and immediate deployment following the briefing. Questions?‚Äù

¬†

Into the perplexed silence that followed, XO Jeffries finally asked, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the plan, captain?‚Äù

¬†

She held up her wristpad, and simply said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to communicate in a way that can‚Äôt be interrupted.‚Äù

¬†

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

¬†

‚ÄúT-10 minutes to communications range,‚Äù voiced a localized AI on the communications station. Captain Miles watched the Turaal fleet on her sensor board. They had been able to positively identify 7 of the 10 ships by this point, including the Turaal Battlecruiser TAC Demarcation. The presence of this heavyweight set the odds of the conflict firmly in the enemy‚Äôs favor. The bridge of the UNS Roosevelt was tense and quiet, save for the constant mutter of tight-band query and response from the nearly 1,500 deployed strike craft arrayed in a very loose wall formation around the carrier. The UNS Lima and UNS Monaco had pushed out a great ways, leaving an enormous amount of space for strike craft to fill in all between the carrier and them, and were also tasked with providing communications relays to the strike groups furthest out into the vast blackness, far past each destroyer. Having reached their place in the widely spaced formation, they all simply cruised along at a stately 1.5 m/s^(2) acceleration, matching the Roosevelt‚Äôs pace. They would be intercepted by the Turaal fleet far earlier than their last feasible deceleration point along their sweeping path toward Orion Beta 5, and could afford to continue at this acceleration point long past the point in time the fleets‚Äô intercept had been resolved. Relativistic to the Roosevelt‚Äôs group, the Turaal fleet was moving at a significant speed, as they had pushed a solid 5.2m/s^(2), approximately three quarters of the standard gravity of their homeworld, for the past 30+ hours, only turning to decelerate in the past 10 hours. Quick estimations put their speed toward each other upwards of 1 million km/hour. The Turaal would be able to use their existing speed to quickly engage past what they likely expected to be a light craft screen to hit the vulnerable carrier behind on their way past, but with full thrust they would be able to swing back around and re-engage with minimum downtime. ‚ÄúA solid strategy,‚Äù Captain Miles thought silently, especially with the communications jamming expected to prevent the human fleet from responding as a group or coordinating fire effectively. Unfortunately for these Turaal, the humans they were up against were playing by a different rulebook. Alyson sat silently, sipping at the long since cooled, bitter coffee in one hand, looked at her wristpad, and waited. She had set her plan in motion, and she had only one small part left to play.

¬†

Approximately ten minutes later, the communications officer announced, ‚ÄúIncoming comms! Turaal flagship Demarcation is hailing us.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúMain screen,‚Äù Captain Miles replied. Hanging above most of the command crew, a large projection of the Turaal flagship commander appeared.

¬†

The greyish, mottled skin of the Turaal species offset the rather garish yellow uniform the commander wore with clear pride. He puffed up his chest to make sure the insignia of his position was visible in the camera, and announced, ‚ÄúHuman vessels, this is the commanding officer of the TAC Demarcation, Captain Sooler. Your presence in this system is a violation of the territory of the Turaal Astral Conglomerate. Stand down immediately and prepare to be boarded. If you do not comply, you will be destroyed.‚Äù

¬†

Captain Miles remained seated, locking eyes with the commander of the TAC Demarcation. She replied, ‚ÄúHello, Captain Sooler. This is Captain Miles of the UNS Roosevelt. The Orion Beta system is within the territory of the United Nations of Terra. You are ordered to power down weapons and leave the system immediately.‚Äù

¬†

The Turaal on screen bristled at the order given by Captain Miles, shouting in his anger. ‚ÄúHow dare you! You will be destroyed if you do not power down your weapons, shields, and engines immediately!‚Äù

¬†

Alyson regarded Captain Sooler cooly before responding. ‚ÄúYou are hopelessly outclassed, captain. Do not throw your lives away meaninglessly. You believe you can jam our communications and prevent us from operating in unison, or targeting your ships. You are wrong.‚Äù Captain Sooler‚Äôs face, mottled to begin with, became more and more clear in its markings, and he looked nearly spotted with fury by this point. Captain Miles continued to speak, not giving him a moment to interrupt. ‚ÄúYou will be given this one warning. If you fire at any of our ships, you will be destroyed.‚Äù Just as the very first syllable of what promised to be a very colorful tirade came through, Captain Miles hit the ‚Äúdisconnect‚Äù button on her chair‚Äôs control pad. Turning to her bridge crew, she called, ‚ÄúSensors, status of the Turaal fleet.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúTuraal ships are ending deceleration burn and are turning to engage. Time to effective jamming range, 12 minutes. Time to effective engagement range, 19 minutes.

¬†

Captain Miles silently watched the two fleets draw inexorably closer on her board. ‚ÄúSix minutes,‚Äùshe thought, ‚ÄúWhat happens over the course of six minutes will decide the outcome of this conflict, and whether several thousand crew members live or die.‚Äù She looked down at the her wristpad, thinking of it as a simple watch on the hand of some long-deceased ancestor, bound to the surface of the Earth for their entire lives. ‚ÄúHow far we have come, and yet we are still completely helpless against the constant, unwavering progress of time.‚Äù She thought of over one thousand of her Starfighter pilots, out there in the black, expecting to lose contact with all friendly forces in the next few minutes, all of them watching the slow march of time on their own wristpads. She looked at them all, each wing indicated by a small green icon on her board, scattered around her ship.

¬†

Teddy ‚Äúwatched‚Äù as well, although she couldn‚Äôt actually ‚Äúsee‚Äù using the hologram. Her sensors littered the entire ship, including the bridge, so she could always see every inch of the place. Alyson noticed the hologram appear to focus on the sensor board, appear to screw up her face in consternation, and awaited the question the AI was taking the time to prepare for. ‚ÄúAre you sure this is the best course of action, captain?‚Äù Teddy finally asked. ‚ÄúWe could still send out the orders to move forward and engage at the first sign of enemy fire.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúNo, Teddy.‚Äù Captain Miles responded. ‚ÄúEven if we were to do that, even if we were to succeed, even if we were to still have the manpower and craft remaining to continue our mission, the cost of that battle in lives lost would be far too steep. If my plan works, we can accomplish our mission without a single shot fired.‚Äù

¬†

‚Äú‚Ä¶ And if it does not work?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúThen UN Command will get the justification for war they‚Äôve been looking for.‚Äù Alyson said darkly. Teddy resumed pretending to pay attention to the sensor board.

¬†

Several tense moments later, sensor icons began quickly dropping off the board. ‚ÄúSensors, status!‚Äù Captain Miles called out.

¬†

‚ÄúEWAR confirmed, losing contact with friendly forces. Lost track of all hostile forces. Working on compensating for the jamming!‚Äù the sensors team called out.

¬†

Captain Miles silently wished them luck, but knew it was pointless. They weren‚Äôt going to figure out how to ignore hostile target jamming in the next 6 minutes. Alyson looked at her wristpad. 5 minutes to go time. Far too close for comfort to the point in time the Turaal fleet would start firing. Worse, they wouldn‚Äôt even know they were being fired on until friendly ships started taking damage. Still, she couldn‚Äôt do anything yet, or she‚Äôd ruin the entire plan. ‚ÄúNo changes. Follow the plan,‚Äù she called out.

¬†

The bridge nearly hummed with silent tension as the crew watched the countdown on the overhead screen, occasionally checking the time on their wristpads. It was the same thing, of course. The Turaal knew their jamming was blocking all communications between the human vessels at this point, and at the very least they were able to identify large numbers of strike craft in the area, although they likely wouldn‚Äôt be able to pick them all out at this distance. Captain Miles assumed the Turaal ships were concentrating on the UNS Roosevelt as the biggest threat. It was the most tactically sound thing to do, after all.

¬†

‚ÄúTwo minutes to estimated engagement,‚Äù Teddy called out. Alyson checked her wristpad. One minute left. A single minute after that for the Turaal to switch their estimation of battle outcome from positive to negative. Nothing left to do but wait. The seconds ticked by, each seemingly longer than the last. Alyson wondered if the flow of time was really, really always exactly the same. It sure seemed to take its time (no pun intended, she assured herself) when a whole bunch of people were paying close attention to it.

¬†

Looking up, Captain Miles watched her ship‚Äôs internal timer tick down to zero. ‚ÄúWeapons targeting hot! Full power! Lighting them up, set to burn through jamming!‚Äù called out the sensors and weapons teams. Around her carrier, two massive destroyers and nearly 1,500 strike craft lit up in the vast dark, blasting targeting radar and jamming systems fit to rival the sun they were nearly facing. It was timed perfectly. Impeccably. So unnaturally simultaneously it could not possibly have been accomplished without communications between friendly ships. ‚ÄúWeapons locked! Ready to fire on your command!‚Äù came the cry from the weapons teams.

¬†

Captain Miles watched with bated breath, waiting for the expected hail from the Turaal battle cruiser. She knew he would be arguing with his shipboard AI right now. No matter how clearly it said it was impossible for the human ships to communicate through their jamming, all Captain Sooler had to do was look at the obvious coordination staring him in the face, and make the call. The human ships were jammed, and yet the human ships still operated as a unit. How did that affect the likely outcome of the conflict, if they could no longer count on a disorganized enemy? Moments ticked by painfully. Fifteen seconds to expected engagement from the Turaal fleet. Ten seconds. Five. Suddenly, comms called out, ‚ÄúCaptain! The Demarcation is hailing us!‚Äù then, from the other side of the room, ‚ÄúJamming is down! All friendly ships responding!‚Äù

¬†

Captain Miles was glad she was already sitting down. She was certain she‚Äôd be having a hard time standing after that relief washed over her. Taking a deep breath, she said in an unwavering voice, ‚ÄúOn screen.‚Äù As the image appeared, Alyson noted that Captain Sooler looked much different than he did mere minutes before. Where he had previously looked fit to burst with rage, he now looked vastly paler, the mottled pattern of his skin nearly blending into one seamless color. ‚ÄúCaptain Sooler,‚Äù she began, ‚ÄúI take it you have thought better of your course of action?‚Äù

¬†

Appearing to carefully consider his words, the Turaal commanding officer stated rather diplomatically, ‚ÄúIt appears we were‚Ä¶ misinformed of your capabilities. I have ordered my fleet to stand down and we are prepared to turn toward the orbital plane at full burn to avoid your fleet‚Äôs operating area.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúThat is acceptable,‚Äù replied Captain Miles. ‚ÄúOnce past us, you will continue to burn toward the outskirts of the system at full speed, and depart after you reach minimum safe distance to warp out. You may inform your command that the Orion Beta system is under the protection of the United Nations of Terra and that further trespassing of military vessels in this system will be considered of hostile intent.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúAcknowledged, Captain Miles. We will comply. Goodbye,‚Äù announced Captain Sooler, quickly signing off. Shortly after, sensors confirmed all of the Turaal ships were powering down weapons and were burning at full speed toward the orbital plane.

¬†

‚ÄúOnce they are past and out of engagement distance, end alert status and begin recovery of all strike craft.‚Äù Called out Captain Miles. ‚ÄúOnce completed, resume course toward Virtume and into high orbit. XO, you have the bridge,‚Äù she finished, nodding to Stuart standing by. Alyson strode out off the bridge and into the nearby ready room, wanting to be close by in case something changed and she was needed again.

¬†

Sitting down with a sigh of relief and a fresh cup of hot coffee, Alyson glanced up at Teddy, who appeared to be studying her. ‚ÄúYes, Teddy?‚Äù she inquired.

¬†

‚ÄúI am very impressed with the success of your plan, Captain Miles,‚Äù Teddy stated. ‚ÄúI did not expect the conflict to be resolved diplomatically.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúThank you Teddy,‚Äù Alyson responded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad it worked, too.‚Äù She looked at her wristpad. ‚ÄúTalk about an old-fashioned plan. I felt like an idiot up there addressing the strike crews, telling them they were going to have to turn on their active targeting systems at a specific time over an hour in the future completely without confirmation from any other friendly.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúIt also seemed unlikely that activating targeting systems, even in a synchronous manner, would cause the enemy captain to re-evaluate his tactical advantage so completely.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúI mean, wouldn‚Äôt you?‚Äù Alyson hedged. ‚ÄúImagine an entire sector of space suddenly lights up with intent to kill you all at the same time. If you thought you had things completely under control, the enemy couldn‚Äôt communicate or target, and all the sudden thousands of ships go and turn hot in sync, completely defying the idea that you had any control of the engagement? It would be insanity to continue the engagement without reassessing. And with all that firepower suddenly right in their face, even if Captain Sooler thought he could take us down, he knew for a fact that he wasn‚Äôt getting out unscathed, and probably not even alive. No battleship screens in the universe could handle that number of simultaneous incoming warheads. The moment he knew we were carrying the bigger stick and we could definitely hit him with it was the moment we won.‚Äù Alyson laughed, and Teddy looked at her in confusion. ‚ÄúBesides,‚Äù she continued, ‚ÄúI got that bit of the plan from your namesake!‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù asked Teddy.

¬†

‚ÄúSure! The aphorism widely attributed to the ancient political figure after which you and older ships of your line were named, Theodore Roosevelt; ‚ÄòSpeak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far.‚Äô‚Äù

*(I sat dad down and decided to record the stories he was telling to better transcribe them, and because even I was getting tired of ""my dad."" In fact, when I am referring to him, I'll just call him ""Senior"" The following was recorded after I got him a little tipsy and begged him to talk more about the life. He was hesitant at first but finally broke down and admitted he was happy to get some of it off his chest)*

. . .. Where did we cap off last time? Oh right, John The schmuck.

Yea they never found that poor bastard, Old Man Maroni was beside himself with grief. He always thought John had been taken out by a rival of his from across the river, course he could never prove it. That didn't stop him though, he was on a warpath, itching for blood.

Truth be told I think he was just glad for the excuse.

One day he pulls me aside and he says ""Frank, I need you to drive some friends of ours uptown, they need to make a payment up there.""

This would be the first hit I would ever be a part of, officially anyway- I don't count the carpet debacle as anything but. Was I nervous? Hell yeah.

Riding with me was Ricky Toro and Dex Finnegan. Ricky was made young, a somewhat controversial topic actually, and he had brought his childhood buddy to the top with him. Ricky was a top earner, some scheme or scam always rolling around in that thick skull of his. With that pale mutt Dex on his side, he could back up any swindle and come out on top. His big money maker was fixing fights, so it was a shock when I found out he had volunteered for the hit.

My guess is he was tired of the whispers, how he had never really stepped up for the family, yet they opened the books for him. I could see him in the rearview, on the surface he looked calm and collected. But the fidgety knee going a mile a minute told a different story. Dex though, pfft he seemed bored with it. I didn't know a lot about the guy-kept to himself only really hung around Ricky and his crew. He was a tall golem with a mop of fiery red on his head, I know that much.

The mood before we crossed the river was jovial, like soldiers given their first marching orders. It was weird, the second we hit Manhattan you could feel the mood wither and die. It was real all of a sudden. My old man had pulled me aside before we left. There was a hint of pride hidden behind that stoney face. He tucked something away in my coat, ignoring my protest. ""Just in case."" he kept saying. He was a careful man, Vincenzo. I'll always grant him that.

Finally, we pulled up to our target. It was quiet, though not unusually so. It was Sunday after all, and most of the neighborhood were a few blocks away paying their dues. The barbershop had tinted windows, but we could peer in and see the shadows of the unsuspecting mooks inside. We could make out at least six or seven human shaped blobs bobbing around in there, the biggest sitting down; getting attended to by a slim shadow with slicked back hair.

Now I don't know about Ricky and his bloodhound, but I pretty much shat a brick when I saw that oval shaped bastard sitting in there. Old man Maroni had scuffed the intel a little, inside wasn't just Carrisi's right hand, but Benito Carrisi himself.

I realize all these names are lost on you Franky, way before your time. I sound like a cranky old mule when I say, ""back in my day,"" but, well back in my day The Carrisi crew were the biggest scumbags across the river. They owned their little patch of land and fought tooth and nail to preserve it.¬† Benito was a miserable fat bastard, his gut spilling out of his button down. His breath reeked of week-old tuna and when he smiled you could see the toll years of decay had taken on his snaggled and jagged teeth. He was a vindictive son of a bitch, and he wasn't supposed to be there that day, or so we were told. We sat in fearful silence for a moment, each man weighing their options. Finally, Ricky pulled out glock-90 and slapped Dex on the back.

""Let's teach these pricks a lesson they'll never forget. Franky: I don't care if God comes by you do not move this car till, we come back."" His accent was heavy and hardened, determined to prove himself to the family. Dex nodded his head at me, saying nothing as he headed out. I kept the engine running, my foot nervously tapping the gas. I reach to my jacket pocket, reassuring myself it wouldn't be needed. I watched as Dex and Ricky positioned themselves, an unspoken maneuver between the duo. Ricky leered in front of the window; pump action firmly planted in his hands. Ricky readied himself by the door out of sight.

The denizens inside completely unaware of the carnage about to unfold. There was a nod between them, and Ricky pushed open the glass door. Heads turned as the overheard bell rang out, and before they knew it the tinted windows exploded inward, raining down shrapnel and buckshot. Ricky stayed halfway by the door, spraying and praying as he blasted inside. I could see the look on his face as he could barely hold onto his Glock, wild eyed and cold at the same time.

The Carrisi crew went down, and they went down hard. I could see Benito crawling on the floor over to one of his fallen men. He was wearing a blood-stained track coat and blue overalls. Three of his men had gone down in the first volley, two more blindly returning fire from behind makeshift cover. Shards of glass-stained blood littered the inside as shell casings dropped to the ceramic floor of the shop. I kept my head down at first, not trying to catch a stray.

I heard Dex cry out and stagger back, catching one in the shoulder. Ricky saw this and swore out, hitting the attacker dead in the head. I saw it all from the Vega, the first time I had ever saw a man die. His head snapped back on impact, blood spattering against the wall. He collapsed in a heap onto the ground like a pile of dirty laundry. It was instant, like someone had just flipped his switch and he was gone-¬†*Senior snaps his fingers*\- Like that.

Dex retreated to the Vega wincing as he studied his wound. Wasn't bad, but I could tell it hurt like hell. Ricky ran back to the car, providing covering fire. Which was really just him shooting up the storefront. He hit everything but the final man and Benito, who was getting up and staring us down from the inside. I could see that snaggle toothed puss snarling at us like a rabid animal. He grabbed a pair of scissors from the ground and hurled it at Ricky. It soared through the air, I swear to Christ Franky, and it hit Ricky right in the chest. He cried out and dropped his gun, clenching himself.

Benito charged out the door with a roar, grabbing him by the collar and slamming him onto the hood of the Vega, the whole care shook and groaned as Benito began pummeling him with his fists. I sprang into action, getting out the revolver my old man had tucked away from me. I felt like Dirty Harry waving that thing around. The final shooter inside took aim at me, and by sheer luck he missed. I took aim at the kid and fired away, the gun nearly jumping out of my hand; the recoil punishing me instantly.

I must have hit him, because he cried out in agony, and disappeared from view. Now it was just me and the ogre beating Ricky to death. I jumped out the car, adrenaline pumping through my veins like steroids, and aimed down on the hulking mass. Benito was so focused, tearing away at Poor Ricky's face. Ricky's face had already ballooned up into fracturing lumps of bruises and welts, like he was a pile of red clay Benito was working tirelessly to reform and disfigure.

""You dumb fucks come here, I'll have your whole family strung up and skinned for this!"" Benito raved at the top of his lungs. ""I'll send you back to Maroni in pieces, I'll march down to Jersey and raze the whole fucking state down!"" I don't know if he was talking to me, Ricky, or God; but he was too far gone in his lunacy to notice me. So, I unloaded on him, five shots right into his side. Smoke poured out of every hole and for a moment he seemed to tank every shot. He stopped in his assault, breathing ragged and choked. He slumped down onto the ground, fists clenched to his side. He took one look at me as he dragged himself across the pavement, eyes burning with hatred.

My eyes flicked to Ricky, barely conscious on the human shaped dent on the hood. He was wheezing and coughing up some crimson fluid, so I slumped him over my shoulder and threw him in next to Dex, still struggling with his shoulder, blood still flowing no matter how much pressure he applied. I scrambled to the driver's seat, sirens starting to wail in the air towards this massacre. I peeled out, burning rubber as I left Benito to bleed out on the sidewalk, hoping to cross the river before the streets flooded with cops.¬†

*-Senior takes a long pause and a swig from his drink. I was too stunned to speak at first. I stuttered at first, struggling to find the words-*

*(I thought you were just a driver)*

I was. At first. Overtime that role grew, and before I knew it, I was running my own little crew. It all changed that day, that first hit. I managed to give the cops the slip and head back into friendly waters. Got Ricky some help as soon as I could, dumped the poor prick in front of an urgent care and reported back to Old Man Maroni with Dex.

He was pretty pleased with himself, Benito's favorite hangout in shambles and five of his men dead. Total embarrassment and he just had to sit there and take it-

*(back up, I thought he was dead?)*

Benito? Nah all that blubber, it was like perfect insulation to take five slugs in the side. His boys whisked him off before the cops came, got him patched up. Dex came out of it with a pain in his arm every time he moved it, but Ricky? He had to have major reconstructive surgery. He came out with a scarred-up face and an eye welded shut. And he wore that mug like a badge of honor. No one said shit behind his back anymore, and he nicknamed himself ""Prince Charming"" some kind of ironic joke, I'm sure.

For my part in it I was praised for keeping a cool head and getting them back safe. I returned the revolver to my father without a word, and he never mentioned how it was empty. He simply patted me on the back and said to 'keep up the good work."" I didn't respond. It was finally hitting me what had gone down that day. How there were five confirmed dead-at least one of those souls following me to this day.¬†

I would later find out my old man ""knew"" what would happen. It was why he gave me the piece. The night before he had gone to his longtime¬†*comare*, a learned woman from the old country. Her name was Anastasia, and she claimed to know things before they transpired. Call it tarot, call it black magic, call it whatever you wanted. The truth of the matter was this Raven curled beauty had my father coiled around her finger, she would whisper prophecy in his ears and bed and my father would bark orders on her whim.¬†

*(You believe stuff like that?) - I laughed but Senior got a dead serios look on his face-*

Let me tell you Franky I saw some strange shit over the years. My old man was a believer for sure, but Paulie was REALLY superstitious. One time I'm driving him on a collection run; we stop in front of the grocery store. Nice sunny day, heat bearing down on us like nobody's business. Paulie was wearing a wife beater, I only bring that up because he looked ridiculous in it, just absolutely drenched in sweat.

Supposed to be the last stop of the day, he barely gets out and takes a long look at the roof-then he climbs back in, tells me to drive on. I ask him what the fuck, because this place was already short two weeks in a row. Paulie points up to the roof, and perched on it was a black crow. Largest bird I had ever seen, just basking in the heat. It was looking down at us, the Vega must have looked like a giant ruby to it. I go

""So what, a frigging bird."" Which earns me one of Paulie's patented smacks across the head.

""Don't be fresh. Them things are harbingers. We'll come another day."" he said firmly. Well, I knew better than not to argue so on we went. Not five minutes later we see to patrol cars barreling down past us. Turns out the joint was being robbed.

He never left his brownstone on the 13^(th)¬†of any month; he carried salt in his back pocket to throw past him if he walked by a graveyard. He skeeved black cats and birds, went to Church every Sunday, 8am on the dot. I don't know if he was simply OCD or what. I tell you this much, he never balked at an order he knew came from the mouth of the prophet.

There was this one time, I was hanging with my buddy Carlo down at Cindy's. Cindy's was a bit of a dive, but it was our dive. Sid, the pony-haired blonde who tended the bar was eyeing me from across the bar, a saucy look to her emerald eyes. Carlo was egging me on, until Paulie emerged behind me from the back, a cockblocking ape who reeked of cigars. He clasped me on the back, robbing me of my breath and suave attitude.¬†

""Come on Romeo. We gotta take a ride."" I heard him speak low enough just for the two of us. Carlo snickered and took a swig, drawing the wrath of Paulie. ""You too Mercutio.""¬†¬†

We drove with the windows down that night, the springtime Jersey air doing wonders for our lungs. Paulie explained on the way, one of Vinchenzo's ""accountants"" had up and vanished. Been about two weeks since he last kicked up, and the wall was starting to crack a little. His¬†*comare*¬†had told him ""Lawrence has been communing with someone he should not."" The old man took that to mean he was collaborating, though that didn't explain the disappearing act. It was pitch black when we arrived at the little slice of suburbia that Larry called home. Even in the evening the scent of freshly cut grass wafted in the air. In the distance a dog barked to the cheering applause of crickets. The lights were all on, an oddly unsettling sight this time of night. We jogged up the drive, eyes darting back and forth like we were bandits in the night.

Which hey I guess we were hahaha.

We went around back, porch light buzzing above us. Paulie had his piece drawn, and I was carrying as well. Carlo liked to carry around this butterfly knife he found in a Chinatown back lot. He claimed he could do all sorts of tricks with it, but I never saw him try it. But I digress.

For some reason, none of us thought it prudent just to knock on the door or even call out to Larry. I had this gut feeling we shouldn't be there, and I could tell by the strained look in Paulie's eyes he thought the same.

Finally, Carlo said, ""Fuck it."" and leapt towards the back door, pounding on it like a madman in heat. ""Larry boy open up, we're friends of the old man."" He called out to nothing and was met with such. The dead silence from inside was starting to get unnerving; Paulie was giving me the ""We should get the fuck outta here."" side-eye.¬†

Carlo knocked on the door once more, only for it to slowly swing open-a light breeze chilling the air in front of us. The door swung open, the naked back hall beckoning us. It was at this time I took my piece out as well; Paulie had put his hands in the air and started to walk back up the drive.

""You gonna tell the old man you walked away?"" I shouted at him. Paulie paused in his tracks.¬†

""Sunnova bitch."" he grumbled, shoulder checking me as he entered the dragon. He turned back and saw us gawking at him, a hint of the devil on Carlo's and I's face. ""Come on you cocksuckas lets go."" He bellowed, and we scurried behind him like rats leaving a sinking ship.

Larry's home was. . . I guess cozy was the way to put it. There was a lingering smell of rot wafting in from the kitchen, but other than that it was homely. The walls were adorned with old family photos, glimpses into past of our missing comrade. There was a decent sized cube of a tv sitting in the corner, through the frayed and grainy image I think I could make out replays of last week's Giants game. A leather-bound recliner sat upright in front of it. Next to it a dinner tray with a warm beer on it. I took a whiff and gagged, smelled like dried out skunk piss.¬†

""Ooh, come here a second."" I heard Carlo holler from the kitchen. I was met with both him and Paulie standing around a dining room table. It was filled with rotting food, flies buzzing around set plates with half eaten homemade cooking that devolved into colorful slop.¬† It stunk to high heaven, Paulie was stepping back with his shoulder to his face to keep from dry heaving. Carlo was leaning over it all, hand rubbing his chin like he was goddamn Sherlock Holmes. Finally, he came next to me to share his observations. ""I think whoever was here left in a hurry."" He mused out loud.

I swear to you Paulie rose in the air and flew over just to smack him in the back of the head because I blinked and suddenly Carlo was going ""ouch"" and rubbing his scalp.¬†

""Fucking¬†*stunad*."" Paulie grumbled, a hint of dry vomit on his breath.

¬†""Three plates out, he must had company. He had no wife or kids.""¬† I countered. Paulie begrudged me that one.

""Wife died giving birth a few years back, kid only lasted a couple hours after that. Breach. Tragic shit."" He pondered aloud. There was a hint of empathy in his voice, but only enough to give the illusion of caring. There was a cup of sour milk at the head of the table, looked like aged tapioca. Carlo leaned over and sniffed it, again thinking he was some great detective. Ignoring him I turned to Paulie, who was deep in pondering.

""This has gotta be retaliation for sumthing right?"" I whispered harshly to him, my mind flashing back to the carpet fiasco. Paulie shook his head.

""Larry wasn't heavy with anyone, well liked, kept to himself. Even if it was a message, we would have received it by now,"" He remarked under his breath. Carlo came up behind me, probably about to say something that would make Paulie throttle him when we heard it.

*thump.*

The three of us looked up at the ceiling in unison, like it was some macabre stooges' bit. I thought it was a one off at first, the wind had knocked over a vase or something. That was when we heard the pitter-patter of feet scuttling around up there, sounded like a wild animal was crawling around.

Paulie held his gun like a security blanket as he gave the ceiling a death glare. Carlo was cautiously making his way to the stairs. The only sound was the fuzz of the ancient tv playing as we tiptoed through the living room. I peeked up the stairs, a soft thumping noise echoing down them. It was like it was taunting us, daring us to come and see. Carlo looked past me, a cocky look on his face. He had brought his knife out; he looked like a greaser displaced in time. He brushed past me, planting himself on the first step.

""Larry is that you up there?"" He called up, his voice booming in the small case. Paulie pushed him, steam powering out of every orifice on his head.

""Are your parents fifth generation inbreds? Ya ever hear of the element of surprise?"" Paulie growled.

""Oh, like they didn't hear us stomping in here,"" Carlo complained, brushing Paulie's hands off him. ""Your fat ass couldn't sneak up on a deaf nun."" I got in between them before they tore into each other, putting a finger to my lips and giving them both the death glare. They put aside their idiocy for a moment, coming together to find whatever was stalking the second floor. We crept up¬†weapons drawn, our senses sharp as daggers.

There was a rank smell up there, different then the rot. This was a-a musk of some kind. Strong and willful, the rancid stench of a sulfur miner coming off a twenty-hour shift. We put up our noises at it and studied the upstairs. Two halls, a crossroad in the middle leading further. To the right a bathroom, nothing special. To the left an old bedroom, set up like some kind of nursery. My heart ached seeing that, Larry boy never got over it.

Down the middle the stench grew stronger, drawing us in. Naturally we followed the smell, unsure of what we would find at the end. Two doors on either side, window smack dab in the middle. Both doors were closed, but we could hear movement, loud and scattered. It was impossible to tell what room held our mystery. Paulie flicked me in the chest with the butt of his gun.¬†

""I'll go right, you and shark bait over there take left."" He commanded in a hushed voice. Carlo was about to pipe up, but I jabbed him with my shoulder, following Paulie's lead. I put my ear to the door on the left, and I swear I heard hushed whispers. I couldn't make out what they were saying, but the voice sounded like it was gargling rocks and spite. I gave Carlo the nod and we burst through the door, and I aimed my piece at-

Nothing.

The room was empty. We were met with an unkempt queen size bed and a hardwood floor filled with dirty laundry. A couple pictures hung on the wall Esque, like the room had been met with a localized Earthquake. We went in on high alert, still not sure if we were alone. Carlo went over the closet and tore it open, jabbing his knife in and out like a nutjob. After he was done stabbing Larry's nice suits he gave me a shrug. That was when I noticed Paulie was being awfully quiet.

I looked over to see him clutching the doorway with one hand, repeatedly making the sign of the cross with the other. His face was crunched up and contorted in horror, like he had seen the gates of hell open up personally. He was muttering something under his breath, but I couldn't make it out. My guess it was some variation of the ""Hail Mary"" with his own personal flavor added in.

I approached slowly, touching his shoulder. As soon as my hand touched him, he twirled around and shoved his gun in my face. I didn't even blink at first, but I think I did piss myself a tad. He lowered it almost instantly, a look of fear glazing over him, his breath shaky and pained.¬†

""Franky-"" He choked out, ""-we need to get the fuck out of here, right now."" He sounded horrified. He pointed to the room and then booked it down the hall, not even waiting for us. Carlo joined me at the threshold, and we peered in. It was Larry's study, his desk overturned and crammed against the lime green walls. Papers littered the walls and floor, scribbled with some unknown language or simply Larry's sloppy handwriting. Engraved-carved in fact- in the middle of the floor was a circle adorned with strange symbols. In the middle of the circle was a nine-pointed star-and a barrier of salt surrounding the whole thing. Melted candles were glued to the points, the remnants of some god forsaken ritual Larry had done.

The air inside that room felt wrong, a chilling breeze greeted us from nowhere, the hairs on the back of my neck flashing warning signs. I couldn't help but notice the salt-line on the carving was broken, salt bursting outward and glistening on the floor. I almost socked Carlor in the jaw, he startled me so badly whispering right in my ear.

""Jesus, Mary and Joseph,"" He muttered next to me. ""Kinda sick shit was this guy into.""¬† Before I could reply we heard a thunderous crash from downstairs followed by Paulie screeching ""MUTHA OF FUCKING CHRIST!"" and the blast of his pistol. We raced downstairs, calling out for Paulie. We were halfway when we saw Paulie standing in the middle of the living room, panting and waving his gun wildly. A shattered chair lay next to him. He saw us standing there like idiots, his eyes wide and crazed. He pointed his gun at the kitchen as he yelled his explanation.

""They threw a fucking chair at me; it laughed and said my name and everything."" He rambled. We approached him with open arms, but come on huh? I was gonna try and calm him down when a plate whizzed past my head and shattered into pieces. The rotted slop it had held fell to the shag carpet. I faced the kitchen, seeing nothing there but a now half empty table. There was a gurgling sound, a sort of dark clucking, like whatever had done it was mocking us. Well Paulie had enough of that and raced out the backdoor with us nipping at his heel.

He covered us as we ran out the back, though I don't know what he would have done. We caught our breath in the drive, hearts racing a mile a minute. Paulie was keeping busy; he rummaged around back and eventually came out with a half empty gas canister and a dirty rag. He forced it in our hands, ordered us to stuff it and light it. He searched his pockets and came out with a metal lighter. I dumped a little gas on the house as Carlo doused and lit the rag.

Before long flames were quickly devouring the back porch and we were retreating back to the car. Paulie was already there, watching the place quickly become engulfed in flames. The heat was intense; we could feel it all the way from the end of the street. The house made a groaning sound like a wounded deer. Least I hope it was the house.

From the street we could see the upstairs window, and I swear to you junior I saw a figure standing there, highlighted by the raging fire. A dark shadow with eyes like dancing embers. I knew it wasn't my mind playing tricks because I could feel the thing reaching out to me, trying to tell me something. What it wanted, I couldn't tell you. It just felt like evil clawing at my mind. None of us said a word on the drive back. Paulie didn't leave his house for two weeks after that, when I finally did coax him out, he looked so shaken and dopey eyed, like he hadn't slept since that night.

Eventually he reverted back to his old jovial self, but he refused to comment on that night. Carlo and I just stuffed it all to the back of our minds, making jokes about that haunted house we saw one time. The implications of it all never really hit us, I didn't want it to. The fire ended up reducing the house to cinders, taking any evidence of Larry and his whereabouts with it.

My father was furious when he heard what happened, ""How do you screw up a simple welfare check huh?!? If I send you idiots to pick up a pie, ya gonna shoot poor old Luigi and rob him!?!"" He screamed at us from his office. Me and Carlo just stood there, embarrassed to even explain what we had seen. Anastasia stood by my father's side, her mystic emeralds studying us. She wore this flowing crimson dress, I think they were going to some party after my father was done chewing us out.¬†

She leaned down as he was catching a breath, whispering something secret only for him. My father had a strange look then, like he had been caught with his hand in the cookie jar. He faced away from us, a deep sigh rumbling from him as Anastasia curled around his shoulders.

""You boys had a rough night, nothing we could do for Larry in the end, I suppose you did what ya thought was best. Get outta here, give Paulie my regards."" and that was the end of that. I never did find out what Ana had said to him, but I suppose that's none of my business.

*-Senior takes a long pause, not even drinking. I cough to regain his attention, and he eyes me, sorrow creeping on his face. -*

I remember the first time I met Ana. Vinchenzo and ma had an unspoken agreement; he would never bring business home-and she would turn a blind eye to flaunting his girlfriend. He would take her to lavish parties, He would bury her in jewelry and romance, while doing the bare minimum for ma, the sweetest woman in the world.

I began to resent all of them frankly, him for doing it and her for letting it happen. It had been a few weeks of collection pickups; I had just gotten the Vega actually. The old man thought it was gawdy but fuck em, he wasn't slugging around town for his cronies. One night he tells me I'm going to drive him to dinner. My heart drops, it's Saturday night, HER night.

In front of ma, he tells me this, like he's enjoying twisting the knife. I swallow my pride and go ""Sure pop, whatever you say."" He has me dressed in a nice suit, he's in this old-time black and white two piece, it's like he stepped right out of a photo with Capone haha.

He sits in the back and tells me the address. He's silent pretty much the whole time, save for one moment when he tells me to ""Slow down, this ain't the Kentucky derby."" I pocket that comment to bitch about later and pull up in front of Anastasia's place.

It's an apartment building, old by the looks of it. There's a goofy looking ad by the door for ""Madame Ana"" with a picture of a gypsy caressing a crystal ball. Corny shit, and since the old man was ancient even then, I expected some dolled-up call-girl with a hiked-up dress and a faux turban to stroll out of that building.

Imagine the donkey-faced look I had when out strolled Helen of Troy. She couldn't have been much older than me, late 20s, early 30s. She wore a long, flowing blouse that left little to imagine. My father flicked the back of my neck, gesturing to open the door for her. I scrambled to open the passenger door for her, and her hand touched mine as Aphrodite slide next to the prune.

She flashed me a smile, her eyes locked onto mine as she did. I thought nothing of it at the time. I tried to focus the road as I drove them to Bella's; this gourmet place the old man was in the middle of busting out, as they cozied-up in the back seat. It was revolting to even think about, much less sit three inches away from. Finally, we made it to the joint, if you've seen one Italian joint you've seen them all, and I got out to open the door for them. Vinchenzo¬†patted me on the back as he passed, barely looking me in the eye as he whispered, ""Drive round the block for an hour or so,"" Ana raised her eyebrows, pouting as she replied,

""I had hoped the young gentleman could accompany us tonight."" Her accent was thick, like she had just stepped right off the boat. Vinchenzo looked at me, grinding his teeth and already regretting dragging me along.¬†

""Sounds like a nice time."" The inside was crawling with the who's who of Jersey scumbags that night. We were tucked away in a private booth, but every few minutes it seemed some half-drunk goombah was coming back to pay their respects. There was Paulie of course, he never missed an opportunity to grovel. There was Old Man Maroni, held up by two cronies forcing a smile as their boss babbled like a drunken idiot. Prince Charming was there, pre-face lift of course. There was Nicky Valant, few guys from New York; Benny Barino, Louie Stacks, even the Irish from across the bay were coming over to kiss his ass, and my father fucking hated the micks.

He would make a big show of showing Ana off like she was a cut of prized veal or something. Made my stomach churn, and from the look in her emeralds she felt the same. Eventually things settled down and we put in our orders. Ana leaned in eager to learn all about me. How was I liking my new gig, what'd I study, what was ""Vinny"" like growing up? I swore I saw him blush at that question. I tried to be polite and answer honestly:

""It can be a drag but good money- English Lit till I dropped out- And Vinny has always been the same¬†*miserabe*¬†he's always been right pop?"" I flashed him a grin at that and was meet with all the sense of humor dead fish could muster. Ana laughed though, a giggling bray that could crack any wall.¬†

""Vinny has told me so much about you, he's glad you've finally shown an interest in the business."" Dad shot her a look but said nothing.¬†

""I wouldn't go that far, just been driving some friends around really."" I sheepishly replied, little red showing up on my face. Ana scoffed playfully, waving her hand in a mock fashion.

""*Mio Dio*, handsome and modest, such a winning combination."" I blushed and cleared my throat, trying to change the subject.

""So, tell me ""Madame Ana."" you really got a crystal ball."" I cracked

.""Hey, watch ya remarks Franky boy."" ""Vinny"" warned, though that was met with a horse laugh by Ana.

""So quick to anger my beloved, you should watch that temper, lest it watch you."" She warned.¬† Her eyes flicked to me ""You Americans love your assumptions about my trade, so I play into them-just a tad."" Pfft, now who was being modest.

""Us Americans? You hearing this pop?"" I feigned outrage. Vinny shook his head, like he'd heard that line a 100 times before

""*Madone*¬†don't get her started, she'll go on for hours."" He lamented. I saw a fire blaze in Ana's eyes; she clucked her tongue and snapped her head back.

""You boys- you play the¬†*soldatino*¬†when you've never felt the boot of Rome on your neck."" She scoffed. Vinny took a swig of his white wine and chuckled darkly.

""I didn't mean to offend."" I offered ""Just never met a-uh, eh fuck it mystic before."" I tell you junior you could have cooked an egg on my forehead I was so red hahaha.¬†

""My mother taught me much-but she envied the sight I was blessed with."" There was a hint of sorrow in her voice. ""I had to leave quite suddenly. It was-luck I suppose I met your father so soon."" She placed a hand on his thigh and flashed a smile.

Our food soon arrived, carried by a plucky waiter with an obvious combover. He laid down a plate of shrimp scampi for my father- a stake for me and chicken parm with noodles for the lady. It smelled divine, cooked to perfection. I heard Ana say ""*Grazie.*"" to the waiter as he walked away as Vinny licked his lips.

Ana dug in immediately, stacking her fork in a mound of pasta, twirling a big chunk and gulping it down in one bite. A touch of sauce dribbled down her chin as she moaning, savoring every single morsel. Vinny was about to take a bite as well when Ana suddenly pointed at him, wagging her finger like he was a schoolboy.¬†

*""No, √® avvelenato.""*¬†she said, muffled as she chewed her food. Vinny scrunched his face, not understanding a word of what she had just said.

""Don't talk with ya mouth full-"" He began.

""Do not eat that-it's¬†*veleno*. Poison."" She said that last part slowly, sounding each syllable out like she had just learned the word I chewed the fat piece of meat I had rolling around in my mouth as my father turned as white and cotton as his bedsheets. The old man was trying to compose himself, eyes darting around the smashed room as the snakes he called friends partied on.¬†

""Who-who would have the fucking gall, here of all fucking places."" He sputtered in a ushed voice.

¬†""The short one-Nicky something with the toupee."" Ana replied so casually, eating like nothing was happening. I was stunned by this bold admission, but I sure as shit wasn't gonna take a bite of the scampi to find out for myself. ""He's upset you passed him over for the pretty boy.""

""Wh- Ricky? Kid's a top fucking earner-four times what Nicky brings in."" Vinny grumbled. Ana simply shrugged, continuing to enjoy her meal.¬†

""Eat then, what do I care-keel over and vomit out your ass in this nice place."" She said with venom. Vinny stewed and mulled his options. Finally, he quietly excused himself, waving over Paulie with a snap of his fingers. He whispered something in his ear, and I saw bloodlust overtake Paulie, as he snapped his focus to Nicky's table. He was lost in the sauce now, two girls on his arms as he told some foul joke. Two men I hadn't seen before appeared behind him, grabbing him and quickly escorting him to the back. A gaggle of wise guys followed suit, assuring the other patrons that nothing was wrong and to go about their business.

There was a mummer of discontent but ultimately no one cared as they dragged the protesting little guy away. I was alone with Ana now, twiddling away embarrassed at the sudden show of force and in awe of the sway she seemed to have over Vinny.¬†

""You saved his life."" I finally admitted breaking the tension. ""How'd you know?"" I squinted at her like an idiot heh. She dismissed me with a wave of her hand.

""Pfft, please huh? Lil Nicky will not be the one to topple the wall."" She squared her face at me. ""You have so much hatred for that man.""¬†

""That's my father you're talking about."" I said in a lower voice.

""He flaunts his adultery to your face, how could you not. A sick wife at home and he galivants with a younger woman. I am no saint Franklin, but he should know better."" she grimaced.

¬†""Well, you aren't exactly blameless in that."" I spat, and I regrated that instantly- to this day I don't know why.¬†

""You think me a whore? I am-disappointed but not surprised. Your father is boastful, but he does not act."" She gave me a lingering look to think that one over. The look on my face must have looked like a toddler trying to figure out how two and two make five-because she let out a low giggle, clearly enjoying my befuddlement.

""So... If he aint-""

""He wants to. But he covets my sight more. I've been his paramour for-two years now. You've seen his rise."" She lingered on that last thought. I had always wondered what his edge was-and now she was smirking at me from across the table.¬†

""And I always thought he was some tactical genius."" I murmured to myself.

""Is it not-ah- Tac-tic-al- to use every advantage you have against the wolves at your door?"" She countered. I didn't answer.¬† She narrowed her eyes at me. ""You are-how they say- ""Not the fastest horse in the race"" yes?"" She laughed playfully. I cracked a smile at that.

""Good thing I'm handsome then huh?"" I rose my glass in a toast. Ana met it with her own glass and the clink rang out. We chatted a little longer about her life in the old country until Vinny reappeared with the rough clearing of his throat. He was standing by Ana's side awkwardly-his knuckles course and bloody. His cuffs were caked in red, but he didn't seem to care.¬†

""We should get going here. They found a rat in the kitchen, need to clean it up a bit."" He lied. As we were leaving- Without paying mind you- I couldn't help but notice some of Pop's goons escorting patrons out. Must have been one hell of a rat in the back huh hehe.

Ride back to Ana's was quite- drove with the windows down and just let that cool breeze wash over me. When we got back Ana leaned into the driver's seat and wrapped her arms around me. She smelt like lavender. She told me it was wonderful meting me and hoped we could see each other again. I couldn't see Vinny's face when she did that, but I can imagine the seething it might have held.

He walked her back to the door, holding her by the waist. He leaned into her ear, whispering something. Ana blushed but pushed him back, shaking her head no. Dad gave her a peck on the cheek good night, and gave me one last glance before disappearing inside. Dad slammed the passenger side when he came back-clearly disgruntled.

He didn't have to say shit- I started the car back up and sped off. He huffed and puffed back there, finally catching me staring at him. he forced some good cheer on his face as he leaned back.

¬†""Heh, she's something ain't she Franky? Would have told ya to get lost so we could uh-get some coffee but, well I guess she needs a break. I wear her out something fierce."" He proclaimed boldly. I held my tongue, and the old man seemed satisfied at that. ""She seemed to take a liking to you."" He spoke. Again, he was met with silence. "" Nah that's good, she's good people. Just uh-don't forget who she was friends with first.""

He didn't say anything for the rest of ride-didn't need to. Motherfucker.

*(I stopped the recording here. He was flustered and needed a break. Frankly I did as well, I had no idea how big of an impact the life really had on him. I also had no idea he believed in so much hocus pocus crap, I'll have to drill him for more on that. I did notice something though, when Senior was talking about that Ana woman. It was his eyes. They were filled with pain. I'll update as soon as I can-until then; I guess beware ghosts throwing chairs.*)",1,1745595259.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

I'm especially interested in roles related to animals, art, or plants, but I'm very open to other opportunities as well! I have a background in art (I hold an art degree) and a strong knowledge of tropical plants. Working in a greenhouse or plant shop would be a dream. I also have experience as a barista and would be happy to jump back into that if there are any openings in caf√©s or coffee shops.
¬†
In addition to paid work, I'm exploring volunteer opportunities with local animal organizations like the SPCA, which is why my Friday availability is tentative.

*(I sat dad down and decided to record the stories he was telling to better transcribe them, and because even I was getting tired of ""my dad."" In fact, when I am referring to him, I'll just call him ""Senior"" The following was recorded after I got him a little tipsy and begged him to talk more about the life. He was hesitant at first but finally broke down and admitted he was happy to get some of it off his chest)*

. . .. Where did we cap off last time? Oh right, John The schmuck.

Yea they never found that poor bastard, Old Man Maroni was beside himself with grief. He always thought John had been taken out by a rival of his from across the river, course he could never prove it. That didn't stop him though, he was on a warpath, itching for blood.

Truth be told I think he was just glad for the excuse.

One day he pulls me aside and he says ""Frank, I need you to drive some friends of ours uptown, they need to make a payment up there.""

This would be the first hit I would ever be a part of, officially anyway- I don't count the carpet debacle as anything but. Was I nervous? Hell yeah.

Riding with me was Ricky Toro and Dex Finnegan. Ricky was made young, a somewhat controversial topic actually, and he had brought his childhood buddy to the top with him. Ricky was a top earner, some scheme or scam always rolling around in that thick skull of his. With that pale mutt Dex on his side, he could back up any swindle and come out on top. His big money maker was fixing fights, so it was a shock when I found out he had volunteered for the hit.

My guess is he was tired of the whispers, how he had never really stepped up for the family, yet they opened the books for him. I could see him in the rearview, on the surface he looked calm and collected. But the fidgety knee going a mile a minute told a different story. Dex though, pfft he seemed bored with it. I didn't know a lot about the guy-kept to himself only really hung around Ricky and his crew. He was a tall golem with a mop of fiery red on his head, I know that much.

The mood before we crossed the river was jovial, like soldiers given their first marching orders. It was weird, the second we hit Manhattan you could feel the mood wither and die. It was real all of a sudden. My old man had pulled me aside before we left. There was a hint of pride hidden behind that stoney face. He tucked something away in my coat, ignoring my protest. ""Just in case."" he kept saying. He was a careful man, Vincenzo. I'll always grant him that.

Finally, we pulled up to our target. It was quiet, though not unusually so. It was Sunday after all, and most of the neighborhood were a few blocks away paying their dues. The barbershop had tinted windows, but we could peer in and see the shadows of the unsuspecting mooks inside. We could make out at least six or seven human shaped blobs bobbing around in there, the biggest sitting down; getting attended to by a slim shadow with slicked back hair.

Now I don't know about Ricky and his bloodhound, but I pretty much shat a brick when I saw that oval shaped bastard sitting in there. Old man Maroni had scuffed the intel a little, inside wasn't just Carrisi's right hand, but Benito Carrisi himself.

I realize all these names are lost on you Franky, way before your time. I sound like a cranky old mule when I say, ""back in my day,"" but, well back in my day The Carrisi crew were the biggest scumbags across the river. They owned their little patch of land and fought tooth and nail to preserve it.¬† Benito was a miserable fat bastard, his gut spilling out of his button down. His breath reeked of week-old tuna and when he smiled you could see the toll years of decay had taken on his snaggled and jagged teeth. He was a vindictive son of a bitch, and he wasn't supposed to be there that day, or so we were told. We sat in fearful silence for a moment, each man weighing their options. Finally, Ricky pulled out glock-90 and slapped Dex on the back.

""Let's teach these pricks a lesson they'll never forget. Franky: I don't care if God comes by you do not move this car till, we come back."" His accent was heavy and hardened, determined to prove himself to the family. Dex nodded his head at me, saying nothing as he headed out. I kept the engine running, my foot nervously tapping the gas. I reach to my jacket pocket, reassuring myself it wouldn't be needed. I watched as Dex and Ricky positioned themselves, an unspoken maneuver between the duo. Ricky leered in front of the window; pump action firmly planted in his hands. Ricky readied himself by the door out of sight.

The denizens inside completely unaware of the carnage about to unfold. There was a nod between them, and Ricky pushed open the glass door. Heads turned as the overheard bell rang out, and before they knew it the tinted windows exploded inward, raining down shrapnel and buckshot. Ricky stayed halfway by the door, spraying and praying as he blasted inside. I could see the look on his face as he could barely hold onto his Glock, wild eyed and cold at the same time.

The Carrisi crew went down, and they went down hard. I could see Benito crawling on the floor over to one of his fallen men. He was wearing a blood-stained track coat and blue overalls. Three of his men had gone down in the first volley, two more blindly returning fire from behind makeshift cover. Shards of glass-stained blood littered the inside as shell casings dropped to the ceramic floor of the shop. I kept my head down at first, not trying to catch a stray.

I heard Dex cry out and stagger back, catching one in the shoulder. Ricky saw this and swore out, hitting the attacker dead in the head. I saw it all from the Vega, the first time I had ever saw a man die. His head snapped back on impact, blood spattering against the wall. He collapsed in a heap onto the ground like a pile of dirty laundry. It was instant, like someone had just flipped his switch and he was gone-¬†*Senior snaps his fingers*\- Like that.

Dex retreated to the Vega wincing as he studied his wound. Wasn't bad, but I could tell it hurt like hell. Ricky ran back to the car, providing covering fire. Which was really just him shooting up the storefront. He hit everything but the final man and Benito, who was getting up and staring us down from the inside. I could see that snaggle toothed puss snarling at us like a rabid animal. He grabbed a pair of scissors from the ground and hurled it at Ricky. It soared through the air, I swear to Christ Franky, and it hit Ricky right in the chest. He cried out and dropped his gun, clenching himself.

Benito charged out the door with a roar, grabbing him by the collar and slamming him onto the hood of the Vega, the whole care shook and groaned as Benito began pummeling him with his fists. I sprang into action, getting out the revolver my old man had tucked away from me. I felt like Dirty Harry waving that thing around. The final shooter inside took aim at me, and by sheer luck he missed. I took aim at the kid and fired away, the gun nearly jumping out of my hand; the recoil punishing me instantly.

I must have hit him, because he cried out in agony, and disappeared from view. Now it was just me and the ogre beating Ricky to death. I jumped out the car, adrenaline pumping through my veins like steroids, and aimed down on the hulking mass. Benito was so focused, tearing away at Poor Ricky's face. Ricky's face had already ballooned up into fracturing lumps of bruises and welts, like he was a pile of red clay Benito was working tirelessly to reform and disfigure.

""You dumb fucks come here, I'll have your whole family strung up and skinned for this!"" Benito raved at the top of his lungs. ""I'll send you back to Maroni in pieces, I'll march down to Jersey and raze the whole fucking state down!"" I don't know if he was talking to me, Ricky, or God; but he was too far gone in his lunacy to notice me. So, I unloaded on him, five shots right into his side. Smoke poured out of every hole and for a moment he seemed to tank every shot. He stopped in his assault, breathing ragged and choked. He slumped down onto the ground, fists clenched to his side. He took one look at me as he dragged himself across the pavement, eyes burning with hatred.

My eyes flicked to Ricky, barely conscious on the human shaped dent on the hood. He was wheezing and coughing up some crimson fluid, so I slumped him over my shoulder and threw him in next to Dex, still struggling with his shoulder, blood still flowing no matter how much pressure he applied. I scrambled to the driver's seat, sirens starting to wail in the air towards this massacre. I peeled out, burning rubber as I left Benito to bleed out on the sidewalk, hoping to cross the river before the streets flooded with cops.¬†

*-Senior takes a long pause and a swig from his drink. I was too stunned to speak at first. I stuttered at first, struggling to find the words-*

*(I thought you were just a driver)*

I was. At first. Overtime that role grew, and before I knew it, I was running my own little crew. It all changed that day, that first hit. I managed to give the cops the slip and head back into friendly waters. Got Ricky some help as soon as I could, dumped the poor prick in front of an urgent care and reported back to Old Man Maroni with Dex.

He was pretty pleased with himself, Benito's favorite hangout in shambles and five of his men dead. Total embarrassment and he just had to sit there and take it-

*(back up, I thought he was dead?)*

Benito? Nah all that blubber, it was like perfect insulation to take five slugs in the side. His boys whisked him off before the cops came, got him patched up. Dex came out of it with a pain in his arm every time he moved it, but Ricky? He had to have major reconstructive surgery. He came out with a scarred-up face and an eye welded shut. And he wore that mug like a badge of honor. No one said shit behind his back anymore, and he nicknamed himself ""Prince Charming"" some kind of ironic joke, I'm sure.

For my part in it I was praised for keeping a cool head and getting them back safe. I returned the revolver to my father without a word, and he never mentioned how it was empty. He simply patted me on the back and said to 'keep up the good work."" I didn't respond. It was finally hitting me what had gone down that day. How there were five confirmed dead-at least one of those souls following me to this day.¬†

I would later find out my old man ""knew"" what would happen. It was why he gave me the piece. The night before he had gone to his longtime¬†*comare*, a learned woman from the old country. Her name was Anastasia, and she claimed to know things before they transpired. Call it tarot, call it black magic, call it whatever you wanted. The truth of the matter was this Raven curled beauty had my father coiled around her finger, she would whisper prophecy in his ears and bed and my father would bark orders on her whim.¬†

*(You believe stuff like that?) - I laughed but Senior got a dead serios look on his face-*

Let me tell you Franky I saw some strange shit over the years. My old man was a believer for sure, but Paulie was REALLY superstitious. One time I'm driving him on a collection run; we stop in front of the grocery store. Nice sunny day, heat bearing down on us like nobody's business. Paulie was wearing a wife beater, I only bring that up because he looked ridiculous in it, just absolutely drenched in sweat.

Supposed to be the last stop of the day, he barely gets out and takes a long look at the roof-then he climbs back in, tells me to drive on. I ask him what the fuck, because this place was already short two weeks in a row. Paulie points up to the roof, and perched on it was a black crow. Largest bird I had ever seen, just basking in the heat. It was looking down at us, the Vega must have looked like a giant ruby to it. I go

""So what, a frigging bird."" Which earns me one of Paulie's patented smacks across the head.

""Don't be fresh. Them things are harbingers. We'll come another day."" he said firmly. Well, I knew better than not to argue so on we went. Not five minutes later we see to patrol cars barreling down past us. Turns out the joint was being robbed.

He never left his brownstone on the 13^(th)¬†of any month; he carried salt in his back pocket to throw past him if he walked by a graveyard. He skeeved black cats and birds, went to Church every Sunday, 8am on the dot. I don't know if he was simply OCD or what. I tell you this much, he never balked at an order he knew came from the mouth of the prophet.

There was this one time, I was hanging with my buddy Carlo down at Cindy's. Cindy's was a bit of a dive, but it was our dive. Sid, the pony-haired blonde who tended the bar was eyeing me from across the bar, a saucy look to her emerald eyes. Carlo was egging me on, until Paulie emerged behind me from the back, a cockblocking ape who reeked of cigars. He clasped me on the back, robbing me of my breath and suave attitude.¬†

""Come on Romeo. We gotta take a ride."" I heard him speak low enough just for the two of us. Carlo snickered and took a swig, drawing the wrath of Paulie. ""You too Mercutio.""¬†¬†

We drove with the windows down that night, the springtime Jersey air doing wonders for our lungs. Paulie explained on the way, one of Vinchenzo's ""accountants"" had up and vanished. Been about two weeks since he last kicked up, and the wall was starting to crack a little. His¬†*comare*¬†had told him ""Lawrence has been communing with someone he should not."" The old man took that to mean he was collaborating, though that didn't explain the disappearing act. It was pitch black when we arrived at the little slice of suburbia that Larry called home. Even in the evening the scent of freshly cut grass wafted in the air. In the distance a dog barked to the cheering applause of crickets. The lights were all on, an oddly unsettling sight this time of night. We jogged up the drive, eyes darting back and forth like we were bandits in the night.

Which hey I guess we were hahaha.

We went around back, porch light buzzing above us. Paulie had his piece drawn, and I was carrying as well. Carlo liked to carry around this butterfly knife he found in a Chinatown back lot. He claimed he could do all sorts of tricks with it, but I never saw him try it. But I digress.

For some reason, none of us thought it prudent just to knock on the door or even call out to Larry. I had this gut feeling we shouldn't be there, and I could tell by the strained look in Paulie's eyes he thought the same.

Finally, Carlo said, ""Fuck it."" and leapt towards the back door, pounding on it like a madman in heat. ""Larry boy open up, we're friends of the old man."" He called out to nothing and was met with such. The dead silence from inside was starting to get unnerving; Paulie was giving me the ""We should get the fuck outta here."" side-eye.¬†

Carlo knocked on the door once more, only for it to slowly swing open-a light breeze chilling the air in front of us. The door swung open, the naked back hall beckoning us. It was at this time I took my piece out as well; Paulie had put his hands in the air and started to walk back up the drive.

""You gonna tell the old man you walked away?"" I shouted at him. Paulie paused in his tracks.¬†

""Sunnova bitch."" he grumbled, shoulder checking me as he entered the dragon. He turned back and saw us gawking at him, a hint of the devil on Carlo's and I's face. ""Come on you cocksuckas lets go."" He bellowed, and we scurried behind him like rats leaving a sinking ship.

Larry's home was. . . I guess cozy was the way to put it. There was a lingering smell of rot wafting in from the kitchen, but other than that it was homely. The walls were adorned with old family photos, glimpses into past of our missing comrade. There was a decent sized cube of a tv sitting in the corner, through the frayed and grainy image I think I could make out replays of last week's Giants game. A leather-bound recliner sat upright in front of it. Next to it a dinner tray with a warm beer on it. I took a whiff and gagged, smelled like dried out skunk piss.¬†

""Ooh, come here a second."" I heard Carlo holler from the kitchen. I was met with both him and Paulie standing around a dining room table. It was filled with rotting food, flies buzzing around set plates with half eaten homemade cooking that devolved into colorful slop.¬† It stunk to high heaven, Paulie was stepping back with his shoulder to his face to keep from dry heaving. Carlo was leaning over it all, hand rubbing his chin like he was goddamn Sherlock Holmes. Finally, he came next to me to share his observations. ""I think whoever was here left in a hurry."" He mused out loud.

I swear to you Paulie rose in the air and flew over just to smack him in the back of the head because I blinked and suddenly Carlo was going ""ouch"" and rubbing his scalp.¬†

""Fucking¬†*stunad*."" Paulie grumbled, a hint of dry vomit on his breath.

¬†""Three plates out, he must had company. He had no wife or kids.""¬† I countered. Paulie begrudged me that one.

""Wife died giving birth a few years back, kid only lasted a couple hours after that. Breach. Tragic shit."" He pondered aloud. There was a hint of empathy in his voice, but only enough to give the illusion of caring. There was a cup of sour milk at the head of the table, looked like aged tapioca. Carlo leaned over and sniffed it, again thinking he was some great detective. Ignoring him I turned to Paulie, who was deep in pondering.

""This has gotta be retaliation for sumthing right?"" I whispered harshly to him, my mind flashing back to the carpet fiasco. Paulie shook his head.

""Larry wasn't heavy with anyone, well liked, kept to himself. Even if it was a message, we would have received it by now,"" He remarked under his breath. Carlo came up behind me, probably about to say something that would make Paulie throttle him when we heard it.

*thump.*

The three of us looked up at the ceiling in unison, like it was some macabre stooges' bit. I thought it was a one off at first, the wind had knocked over a vase or something. That was when we heard the pitter-patter of feet scuttling around up there, sounded like a wild animal was crawling around.

Paulie held his gun like a security blanket as he gave the ceiling a death glare. Carlo was cautiously making his way to the stairs. The only sound was the fuzz of the ancient tv playing as we tiptoed through the living room. I peeked up the stairs, a soft thumping noise echoing down them. It was like it was taunting us, daring us to come and see. Carlo looked past me, a cocky look on his face. He had brought his knife out; he looked like a greaser displaced in time. He brushed past me, planting himself on the first step.

""Larry is that you up there?"" He called up, his voice booming in the small case. Paulie pushed him, steam powering out of every orifice on his head.

""Are your parents fifth generation inbreds? Ya ever hear of the element of surprise?"" Paulie growled.

""Oh, like they didn't hear us stomping in here,"" Carlo complained, brushing Paulie's hands off him. ""Your fat ass couldn't sneak up on a deaf nun."" I got in between them before they tore into each other, putting a finger to my lips and giving them both the death glare. They put aside their idiocy for a moment, coming together to find whatever was stalking the second floor. We crept up¬†weapons drawn, our senses sharp as daggers.

There was a rank smell up there, different then the rot. This was a-a musk of some kind. Strong and willful, the rancid stench of a sulfur miner coming off a twenty-hour shift. We put up our noises at it and studied the upstairs. Two halls, a crossroad in the middle leading further. To the right a bathroom, nothing special. To the left an old bedroom, set up like some kind of nursery. My heart ached seeing that, Larry boy never got over it.

Down the middle the stench grew stronger, drawing us in. Naturally we followed the smell, unsure of what we would find at the end. Two doors on either side, window smack dab in the middle. Both doors were closed, but we could hear movement, loud and scattered. It was impossible to tell what room held our mystery. Paulie flicked me in the chest with the butt of his gun.¬†

""I'll go right, you and shark bait over there take left."" He commanded in a hushed voice. Carlo was about to pipe up, but I jabbed him with my shoulder, following Paulie's lead. I put my ear to the door on the left, and I swear I heard hushed whispers. I couldn't make out what they were saying, but the voice sounded like it was gargling rocks and spite. I gave Carlo the nod and we burst through the door, and I aimed my piece at-

Nothing.

The room was empty. We were met with an unkempt queen size bed and a hardwood floor filled with dirty laundry. A couple pictures hung on the wall Esque, like the room had been met with a localized Earthquake. We went in on high alert, still not sure if we were alone. Carlo went over the closet and tore it open, jabbing his knife in and out like a nutjob. After he was done stabbing Larry's nice suits he gave me a shrug. That was when I noticed Paulie was being awfully quiet.

I looked over to see him clutching the doorway with one hand, repeatedly making the sign of the cross with the other. His face was crunched up and contorted in horror, like he had seen the gates of hell open up personally. He was muttering something under his breath, but I couldn't make it out. My guess it was some variation of the ""Hail Mary"" with his own personal flavor added in.

I approached slowly, touching his shoulder. As soon as my hand touched him, he twirled around and shoved his gun in my face. I didn't even blink at first, but I think I did piss myself a tad. He lowered it almost instantly, a look of fear glazing over him, his breath shaky and pained.¬†

""Franky-"" He choked out, ""-we need to get the fuck out of here, right now."" He sounded horrified. He pointed to the room and then booked it down the hall, not even waiting for us. Carlo joined me at the threshold, and we peered in. It was Larry's study, his desk overturned and crammed against the lime green walls. Papers littered the walls and floor, scribbled with some unknown language or simply Larry's sloppy handwriting. Engraved-carved in fact- in the middle of the floor was a circle adorned with strange symbols. In the middle of the circle was a nine-pointed star-and a barrier of salt surrounding the whole thing. Melted candles were glued to the points, the remnants of some god forsaken ritual Larry had done.

The air inside that room felt wrong, a chilling breeze greeted us from nowhere, the hairs on the back of my neck flashing warning signs. I couldn't help but notice the salt-line on the carving was broken, salt bursting outward and glistening on the floor. I almost socked Carlor in the jaw, he startled me so badly whispering right in my ear.

""Jesus, Mary and Joseph,"" He muttered next to me. ""Kinda sick shit was this guy into.""¬† Before I could reply we heard a thunderous crash from downstairs followed by Paulie screeching ""MUTHA OF FUCKING CHRIST!"" and the blast of his pistol. We raced downstairs, calling out for Paulie. We were halfway when we saw Paulie standing in the middle of the living room, panting and waving his gun wildly. A shattered chair lay next to him. He saw us standing there like idiots, his eyes wide and crazed. He pointed his gun at the kitchen as he yelled his explanation.

""They threw a fucking chair at me; it laughed and said my name and everything."" He rambled. We approached him with open arms, but come on huh? I was gonna try and calm him down when a plate whizzed past my head and shattered into pieces. The rotted slop it had held fell to the shag carpet. I faced the kitchen, seeing nothing there but a now half empty table. There was a gurgling sound, a sort of dark clucking, like whatever had done it was mocking us. Well Paulie had enough of that and raced out the backdoor with us nipping at his heel.

He covered us as we ran out the back, though I don't know what he would have done. We caught our breath in the drive, hearts racing a mile a minute. Paulie was keeping busy; he rummaged around back and eventually came out with a half empty gas canister and a dirty rag. He forced it in our hands, ordered us to stuff it and light it. He searched his pockets and came out with a metal lighter. I dumped a little gas on the house as Carlo doused and lit the rag.

Before long flames were quickly devouring the back porch and we were retreating back to the car. Paulie was already there, watching the place quickly become engulfed in flames. The heat was intense; we could feel it all the way from the end of the street. The house made a groaning sound like a wounded deer. Least I hope it was the house.

From the street we could see the upstairs window, and I swear to you junior I saw a figure standing there, highlighted by the raging fire. A dark shadow with eyes like dancing embers. I knew it wasn't my mind playing tricks because I could feel the thing reaching out to me, trying to tell me something. What it wanted, I couldn't tell you. It just felt like evil clawing at my mind. None of us said a word on the drive back. Paulie didn't leave his house for two weeks after that, when I finally did coax him out, he looked so shaken and dopey eyed, like he hadn't slept since that night.

Eventually he reverted back to his old jovial self, but he refused to comment on that night. Carlo and I just stuffed it all to the back of our minds, making jokes about that haunted house we saw one time. The implications of it all never really hit us, I didn't want it to. The fire ended up reducing the house to cinders, taking any evidence of Larry and his whereabouts with it.

My father was furious when he heard what happened, ""How do you screw up a simple welfare check huh?!? If I send you idiots to pick up a pie, ya gonna shoot poor old Luigi and rob him!?!"" He screamed at us from his office. Me and Carlo just stood there, embarrassed to even explain what we had seen. Anastasia stood by my father's side, her mystic emeralds studying us. She wore this flowing crimson dress, I think they were going to some party after my father was done chewing us out.¬†

She leaned down as he was catching a breath, whispering something secret only for him. My father had a strange look then, like he had been caught with his hand in the cookie jar. He faced away from us, a deep sigh rumbling from him as Anastasia curled around his shoulders.

""You boys had a rough night, nothing we could do for Larry in the end, I suppose you did what ya thought was best. Get outta here, give Paulie my regards."" and that was the end of that. I never did find out what Ana had said to him, but I suppose that's none of my business.

*-Senior takes a long pause, not even drinking. I cough to regain his attention, and he eyes me, sorrow creeping on his face. -*

I remember the first time I met Ana. Vinchenzo and ma had an unspoken agreement; he would never bring business home-and she would turn a blind eye to flaunting his girlfriend. He would take her to lavish parties, He would bury her in jewelry and romance, while doing the bare minimum for ma, the sweetest woman in the world.

I began to resent all of them frankly, him for doing it and her for letting it happen. It had been a few weeks of collection pickups; I had just gotten the Vega actually. The old man thought it was gawdy but fuck em, he wasn't slugging around town for his cronies. One night he tells me I'm going to drive him to dinner. My heart drops, it's Saturday night, HER night.

In front of ma, he tells me this, like he's enjoying twisting the knife. I swallow my pride and go ""Sure pop, whatever you say."" He has me dressed in a nice suit, he's in this old-time black and white two piece, it's like he stepped right out of a photo with Capone haha.

He sits in the back and tells me the address. He's silent pretty much the whole time, save for one moment when he tells me to ""Slow down, this ain't the Kentucky derby."" I pocket that comment to bitch about later and pull up in front of Anastasia's place.

It's an apartment building, old by the looks of it. There's a goofy looking ad by the door for ""Madame Ana"" with a picture of a gypsy caressing a crystal ball. Corny shit, and since the old man was ancient even then, I expected some dolled-up call-girl with a hiked-up dress and a faux turban to stroll out of that building.

Imagine the donkey-faced look I had when out strolled Helen of Troy. She couldn't have been much older than me, late 20s, early 30s. She wore a long, flowing blouse that left little to imagine. My father flicked the back of my neck, gesturing to open the door for her. I scrambled to open the passenger door for her, and her hand touched mine as Aphrodite slide next to the prune.

She flashed me a smile, her eyes locked onto mine as she did. I thought nothing of it at the time. I tried to focus the road as I drove them to Bella's; this gourmet place the old man was in the middle of busting out, as they cozied-up in the back seat. It was revolting to even think about, much less sit three inches away from. Finally, we made it to the joint, if you've seen one Italian joint you've seen them all, and I got out to open the door for them. Vinchenzo¬†patted me on the back as he passed, barely looking me in the eye as he whispered, ""Drive round the block for an hour or so,"" Ana raised her eyebrows, pouting as she replied,

""I had hoped the young gentleman could accompany us tonight."" Her accent was thick, like she had just stepped right off the boat. Vinchenzo looked at me, grinding his teeth and already regretting dragging me along.¬†

""Sounds like a nice time."" The inside was crawling with the who's who of Jersey scumbags that night. We were tucked away in a private booth, but every few minutes it seemed some half-drunk goombah was coming back to pay their respects. There was Paulie of course, he never missed an opportunity to grovel. There was Old Man Maroni, held up by two cronies forcing a smile as their boss babbled like a drunken idiot. Prince Charming was there, pre-face lift of course. There was Nicky Valant, few guys from New York; Benny Barino, Louie Stacks, even the Irish from across the bay were coming over to kiss his ass, and my father fucking hated the micks.

He would make a big show of showing Ana off like she was a cut of prized veal or something. Made my stomach churn, and from the look in her emeralds she felt the same. Eventually things settled down and we put in our orders. Ana leaned in eager to learn all about me. How was I liking my new gig, what'd I study, what was ""Vinny"" like growing up? I swore I saw him blush at that question. I tried to be polite and answer honestly:

""It can be a drag but good money- English Lit till I dropped out- And Vinny has always been the same¬†*miserabe*¬†he's always been right pop?"" I flashed him a grin at that and was meet with all the sense of humor dead fish could muster. Ana laughed though, a giggling bray that could crack any wall.¬†

""Vinny has told me so much about you, he's glad you've finally shown an interest in the business."" Dad shot her a look but said nothing.¬†

""I wouldn't go that far, just been driving some friends around really."" I sheepishly replied, little red showing up on my face. Ana scoffed playfully, waving her hand in a mock fashion.

""*Mio Dio*, handsome and modest, such a winning combination."" I blushed and cleared my throat, trying to change the subject.

""So, tell me ""Madame Ana."" you really got a crystal ball."" I cracked

.""Hey, watch ya remarks Franky boy."" ""Vinny"" warned, though that was met with a horse laugh by Ana.

""So quick to anger my beloved, you should watch that temper, lest it watch you."" She warned.¬† Her eyes flicked to me ""You Americans love your assumptions about my trade, so I play into them-just a tad."" Pfft, now who was being modest.

""Us Americans? You hearing this pop?"" I feigned outrage. Vinny shook his head, like he'd heard that line a 100 times before

""*Madone*¬†don't get her started, she'll go on for hours."" He lamented. I saw a fire blaze in Ana's eyes; she clucked her tongue and snapped her head back.

""You boys- you play the¬†*soldatino*¬†when you've never felt the boot of Rome on your neck."" She scoffed. Vinny took a swig of his white wine and chuckled darkly.

""I didn't mean to offend."" I offered ""Just never met a-uh, eh fuck it mystic before."" I tell you junior you could have cooked an egg on my forehead I was so red hahaha.¬†

""My mother taught me much-but she envied the sight I was blessed with."" There was a hint of sorrow in her voice. ""I had to leave quite suddenly. It was-luck I suppose I met your father so soon."" She placed a hand on his thigh and flashed a smile.

Our food soon arrived, carried by a plucky waiter with an obvious combover. He laid down a plate of shrimp scampi for my father- a stake for me and chicken parm with noodles for the lady. It smelled divine, cooked to perfection. I heard Ana say ""*Grazie.*"" to the waiter as he walked away as Vinny licked his lips.

Ana dug in immediately, stacking her fork in a mound of pasta, twirling a big chunk and gulping it down in one bite. A touch of sauce dribbled down her chin as she moaning, savoring every single morsel. Vinny was about to take a bite as well when Ana suddenly pointed at him, wagging her finger like he was a schoolboy.¬†

*""No, √® avvelenato.""*¬†she said, muffled as she chewed her food. Vinny scrunched his face, not understanding a word of what she had just said.

""Don't talk with ya mouth full-"" He began.

""Do not eat that-it's¬†*veleno*. Poison."" She said that last part slowly, sounding each syllable out like she had just learned the word I chewed the fat piece of meat I had rolling around in my mouth as my father turned as white and cotton as his bedsheets. The old man was trying to compose himself, eyes darting around the smashed room as the snakes he called friends partied on.¬†

""Who-who would have the fucking gall, here of all fucking places."" He sputtered in a ushed voice.

¬†""The short one-Nicky something with the toupee."" Ana replied so casually, eating like nothing was happening. I was stunned by this bold admission, but I sure as shit wasn't gonna take a bite of the scampi to find out for myself. ""He's upset you passed him over for the pretty boy.""

""Wh- Ricky? Kid's a top fucking earner-four times what Nicky brings in."" Vinny grumbled. Ana simply shrugged, continuing to enjoy her meal.¬†

""Eat then, what do I care-keel over and vomit out your ass in this nice place."" She said with venom. Vinny stewed and mulled his options. Finally, he quietly excused himself, waving over Paulie with a snap of his fingers. He whispered something in his ear, and I saw bloodlust overtake Paulie, as he snapped his focus to Nicky's table. He was lost in the sauce now, two girls on his arms as he told some foul joke. Two men I hadn't seen before appeared behind him, grabbing him and quickly escorting him to the back. A gaggle of wise guys followed suit, assuring the other patrons that nothing was wrong and to go about their business.

There was a mummer of discontent but ultimately no one cared as they dragged the protesting little guy away. I was alone with Ana now, twiddling away embarrassed at the sudden show of force and in awe of the sway she seemed to have over Vinny.¬†

""You saved his life."" I finally admitted breaking the tension. ""How'd you know?"" I squinted at her like an idiot heh. She dismissed me with a wave of her hand.

""Pfft, please huh? Lil Nicky will not be the one to topple the wall."" She squared her face at me. ""You have so much hatred for that man.""¬†

""That's my father you're talking about."" I said in a lower voice.

""He flaunts his adultery to your face, how could you not. A sick wife at home and he galivants with a younger woman. I am no saint Franklin, but he should know better."" she grimaced.

¬†""Well, you aren't exactly blameless in that."" I spat, and I regrated that instantly- to this day I don't know why.¬†

""You think me a whore? I am-disappointed but not surprised. Your father is boastful, but he does not act."" She gave me a lingering look to think that one over. The look on my face must have looked like a toddler trying to figure out how two and two make five-because she let out a low giggle, clearly enjoying my befuddlement.

""So... If he aint-""

""He wants to. But he covets my sight more. I've been his paramour for-two years now. You've seen his rise."" She lingered on that last thought. I had always wondered what his edge was-and now she was smirking at me from across the table.¬†

""And I always thought he was some tactical genius."" I murmured to myself.

""Is it not-ah- Tac-tic-al- to use every advantage you have against the wolves at your door?"" She countered. I didn't answer.¬† She narrowed her eyes at me. ""You are-how they say- ""Not the fastest horse in the race"" yes?"" She laughed playfully. I cracked a smile at that.

""Good thing I'm handsome then huh?"" I rose my glass in a toast. Ana met it with her own glass and the clink rang out. We chatted a little longer about her life in the old country until Vinny reappeared with the rough clearing of his throat. He was standing by Ana's side awkwardly-his knuckles course and bloody. His cuffs were caked in red, but he didn't seem to care.¬†

""We should get going here. They found a rat in the kitchen, need to clean it up a bit."" He lied. As we were leaving- Without paying mind you- I couldn't help but notice some of Pop's goons escorting patrons out. Must have been one hell of a rat in the back huh hehe.

Ride back to Ana's was quite- drove with the windows down and just let that cool breeze wash over me. When we got back Ana leaned into the driver's seat and wrapped her arms around me. She smelt like lavender. She told me it was wonderful meting me and hoped we could see each other again. I couldn't see Vinny's face when she did that, but I can imagine the seething it might have held.

He walked her back to the door, holding her by the waist. He leaned into her ear, whispering something. Ana blushed but pushed him back, shaking her head no. Dad gave her a peck on the cheek good night, and gave me one last glance before disappearing inside. Dad slammed the passenger side when he came back-clearly disgruntled.

He didn't have to say shit- I started the car back up and sped off. He huffed and puffed back there, finally catching me staring at him. he forced some good cheer on his face as he leaned back.

¬†""Heh, she's something ain't she Franky? Would have told ya to get lost so we could uh-get some coffee but, well I guess she needs a break. I wear her out something fierce."" He proclaimed boldly. I held my tongue, and the old man seemed satisfied at that. ""She seemed to take a liking to you."" He spoke. Again, he was met with silence. "" Nah that's good, she's good people. Just uh-don't forget who she was friends with first.""

He didn't say anything for the rest of ride-didn't need to. Motherfucker.

*(I stopped the recording here. He was flustered and needed a break. Frankly I did as well, I had no idea how big of an impact the life really had on him. I also had no idea he believed in so much hocus pocus crap, I'll have to drill him for more on that. I did notice something though, when Senior was talking about that Ana woman. It was his eyes. They were filled with pain. I'll update as soon as I can-until then; I guess beware ghosts throwing chairs.*)",1,1745595143.0,deepnightsociety,0,1.0,False

He was hesitant at first but finally broke down and admitted he was happy to get some of it off his chest)*

. . .. Where did we cap off last time? Oh right, John The schmuck.

Yea they never found that poor bastard, Old Man Maroni was beside himself with grief. He always thought John had been taken out by a rival of his from across the river, course he could never prove it. That didn't stop him though, he was on a warpath, itching for blood.

Truth be told I think he was just glad for the excuse.

One day he pulls me aside and he says ""Frank, I need you to drive some friends of ours uptown, they need to make a payment up there.""

This would be the first hit I would ever be a part of, officially anyway- I don't count the carpet debacle as anything but. Was I nervous? Hell yeah.

Riding with me was Ricky Toro and Dex Finnegan. Ricky was made young, a somewhat controversial topic actually, and he had brought his childhood buddy to the top with him. Ricky was a top earner, some scheme or scam always rolling around in that thick skull of his. With that pale mutt Dex on his side, he could back up any swindle and come out on top. His big money maker was fixing fights, so it was a shock when I found out he had volunteered for the hit.

My guess is he was tired of the whispers, how he had never really stepped up for the family, yet they opened the books for him. I could see him in the rearview, on the surface he looked calm and collected. But the fidgety knee going a mile a minute told a different story. Dex though, pfft he seemed bored with it. I didn't know a lot about the guy-kept to himself only really hung around Ricky and his crew. He was a tall golem with a mop of fiery red on his head, I know that much.

The mood before we crossed the river was jovial, like soldiers given their first marching orders. It was weird, the second we hit Manhattan you could feel the mood wither and die. It was real all of a sudden. My old man had pulled me aside before we left. There was a hint of pride hidden behind that stoney face. He tucked something away in my coat, ignoring my protest. ""Just in case."" he kept saying. He was a careful man, Vincenzo. I'll always grant him that.

Finally, we pulled up to our target. It was quiet, though not unusually so. It was Sunday after all, and most of the neighborhood were a few blocks away paying their dues. The barbershop had tinted windows, but we could peer in and see the shadows of the unsuspecting mooks inside. We could make out at least six or seven human shaped blobs bobbing around in there, the biggest sitting down; getting attended to by a slim shadow with slicked back hair.

Now I don't know about Ricky and his bloodhound, but I pretty much shat a brick when I saw that oval shaped bastard sitting in there. Old man Maroni had scuffed the intel a little, inside wasn't just Carrisi's right hand, but Benito Carrisi himself.

I realize all these names are lost on you Franky, way before your time. I sound like a cranky old mule when I say, ""back in my day,"" but, well back in my day The Carrisi crew were the biggest scumbags across the river. They owned their little patch of land and fought tooth and nail to preserve it.¬† Benito was a miserable fat bastard, his gut spilling out of his button down. His breath reeked of week-old tuna and when he smiled you could see the toll years of decay had taken on his snaggled and jagged teeth. He was a vindictive son of a bitch, and he wasn't supposed to be there that day, or so we were told. We sat in fearful silence for a moment, each man weighing their options. Finally, Ricky pulled out glock-90 and slapped Dex on the back.

""Let's teach these pricks a lesson they'll never forget. Franky: I don't care if God comes by you do not move this car till, we come back."" His accent was heavy and hardened, determined to prove himself to the family. Dex nodded his head at me, saying nothing as he headed out. I kept the engine running, my foot nervously tapping the gas. I reach to my jacket pocket, reassuring myself it wouldn't be needed. I watched as Dex and Ricky positioned themselves, an unspoken maneuver between the duo. Ricky leered in front of the window; pump action firmly planted in his hands. Ricky readied himself by the door out of sight.

The denizens inside completely unaware of the carnage about to unfold. There was a nod between them, and Ricky pushed open the glass door. Heads turned as the overheard bell rang out, and before they knew it the tinted windows exploded inward, raining down shrapnel and buckshot. Ricky stayed halfway by the door, spraying and praying as he blasted inside. I could see the look on his face as he could barely hold onto his Glock, wild eyed and cold at the same time.

The Carrisi crew went down, and they went down hard. I could see Benito crawling on the floor over to one of his fallen men. He was wearing a blood-stained track coat and blue overalls. Three of his men had gone down in the first volley, two more blindly returning fire from behind makeshift cover. Shards of glass-stained blood littered the inside as shell casings dropped to the ceramic floor of the shop. I kept my head down at first, not trying to catch a stray.

I heard Dex cry out and stagger back, catching one in the shoulder. Ricky saw this and swore out, hitting the attacker dead in the head. I saw it all from the Vega, the first time I had ever saw a man die. His head snapped back on impact, blood spattering against the wall. He collapsed in a heap onto the ground like a pile of dirty laundry. It was instant, like someone had just flipped his switch and he was gone-¬†*Senior snaps his fingers*\- Like that.

Dex retreated to the Vega wincing as he studied his wound. Wasn't bad, but I could tell it hurt like hell. Ricky ran back to the car, providing covering fire. Which was really just him shooting up the storefront. He hit everything but the final man and Benito, who was getting up and staring us down from the inside. I could see that snaggle toothed puss snarling at us like a rabid animal. He grabbed a pair of scissors from the ground and hurled it at Ricky. It soared through the air, I swear to Christ Franky, and it hit Ricky right in the chest. He cried out and dropped his gun, clenching himself.

Benito charged out the door with a roar, grabbing him by the collar and slamming him onto the hood of the Vega, the whole care shook and groaned as Benito began pummeling him with his fists. I sprang into action, getting out the revolver my old man had tucked away from me. I felt like Dirty Harry waving that thing around. The final shooter inside took aim at me, and by sheer luck he missed. I took aim at the kid and fired away, the gun nearly jumping out of my hand; the recoil punishing me instantly.

I must have hit him, because he cried out in agony, and disappeared from view. Now it was just me and the ogre beating Ricky to death. I jumped out the car, adrenaline pumping through my veins like steroids, and aimed down on the hulking mass. Benito was so focused, tearing away at Poor Ricky's face. Ricky's face had already ballooned up into fracturing lumps of bruises and welts, like he was a pile of red clay Benito was working tirelessly to reform and disfigure.

""You dumb fucks come here, I'll have your whole family strung up and skinned for this!"" Benito raved at the top of his lungs. ""I'll send you back to Maroni in pieces, I'll march down to Jersey and raze the whole fucking state down!"" I don't know if he was talking to me, Ricky, or God; but he was too far gone in his lunacy to notice me. So, I unloaded on him, five shots right into his side. Smoke poured out of every hole and for a moment he seemed to tank every shot. He stopped in his assault, breathing ragged and choked. He slumped down onto the ground, fists clenched to his side. He took one look at me as he dragged himself across the pavement, eyes burning with hatred.

My eyes flicked to Ricky, barely conscious on the human shaped dent on the hood. He was wheezing and coughing up some crimson fluid, so I slumped him over my shoulder and threw him in next to Dex, still struggling with his shoulder, blood still flowing no matter how much pressure he applied. I scrambled to the driver's seat, sirens starting to wail in the air towards this massacre. I peeled out, burning rubber as I left Benito to bleed out on the sidewalk, hoping to cross the river before the streets flooded with cops.¬†

*-Senior takes a long pause and a swig from his drink. I was too stunned to speak at first. I stuttered at first, struggling to find the words-*

*(I thought you were just a driver)*

I was. At first. Overtime that role grew, and before I knew it, I was running my own little crew. It all changed that day, that first hit. I managed to give the cops the slip and head back into friendly waters. Got Ricky some help as soon as I could, dumped the poor prick in front of an urgent care and reported back to Old Man Maroni with Dex.

He was pretty pleased with himself, Benito's favorite hangout in shambles and five of his men dead. Total embarrassment and he just had to sit there and take it-

*(back up, I thought he was dead?)*

Benito? Nah all that blubber, it was like perfect insulation to take five slugs in the side. His boys whisked him off before the cops came, got him patched up. Dex came out of it with a pain in his arm every time he moved it, but Ricky? He had to have major reconstructive surgery. He came out with a scarred-up face and an eye welded shut. And he wore that mug like a badge of honor. No one said shit behind his back anymore, and he nicknamed himself ""Prince Charming"" some kind of ironic joke, I'm sure.

For my part in it I was praised for keeping a cool head and getting them back safe. I returned the revolver to my father without a word, and he never mentioned how it was empty. He simply patted me on the back and said to 'keep up the good work."" I didn't respond. It was finally hitting me what had gone down that day. How there were five confirmed dead-at least one of those souls following me to this day.¬†

I would later find out my old man ""knew"" what would happen. It was why he gave me the piece. The night before he had gone to his longtime¬†*comare*, a learned woman from the old country. Her name was Anastasia, and she claimed to know things before they transpired. Call it tarot, call it black magic, call it whatever you wanted. The truth of the matter was this Raven curled beauty had my father coiled around her finger, she would whisper prophecy in his ears and bed and my father would bark orders on her whim.¬†

*(You believe stuff like that?) - I laughed but Senior got a dead serios look on his face-*

Let me tell you Franky I saw some strange shit over the years. My old man was a believer for sure, but Paulie was REALLY superstitious. One time I'm driving him on a collection run; we stop in front of the grocery store. Nice sunny day, heat bearing down on us like nobody's business. Paulie was wearing a wife beater, I only bring that up because he looked ridiculous in it, just absolutely drenched in sweat.

Supposed to be the last stop of the day, he barely gets out and takes a long look at the roof-then he climbs back in, tells me to drive on. I ask him what the fuck, because this place was already short two weeks in a row. Paulie points up to the roof, and perched on it was a black crow. Largest bird I had ever seen, just basking in the heat. It was looking down at us, the Vega must have looked like a giant ruby to it. I go

""So what, a frigging bird."" Which earns me one of Paulie's patented smacks across the head.

""Don't be fresh. Them things are harbingers. We'll come another day."" he said firmly. Well, I knew better than not to argue so on we went. Not five minutes later we see to patrol cars barreling down past us. Turns out the joint was being robbed.

He never left his brownstone on the 13^(th)¬†of any month; he carried salt in his back pocket to throw past him if he walked by a graveyard. He skeeved black cats and birds, went to Church every Sunday, 8am on the dot. I don't know if he was simply OCD or what. I tell you this much, he never balked at an order he knew came from the mouth of the prophet.

There was this one time, I was hanging with my buddy Carlo down at Cindy's. Cindy's was a bit of a dive, but it was our dive. Sid, the pony-haired blonde who tended the bar was eyeing me from across the bar, a saucy look to her emerald eyes. Carlo was egging me on, until Paulie emerged behind me from the back, a cockblocking ape who reeked of cigars. He clasped me on the back, robbing me of my breath and suave attitude.¬†

""Come on Romeo. We gotta take a ride."" I heard him speak low enough just for the two of us. Carlo snickered and took a swig, drawing the wrath of Paulie. ""You too Mercutio.""¬†¬†

We drove with the windows down that night, the springtime Jersey air doing wonders for our lungs. Paulie explained on the way, one of Vinchenzo's ""accountants"" had up and vanished. Been about two weeks since he last kicked up, and the wall was starting to crack a little. His¬†*comare*¬†had told him ""Lawrence has been communing with someone he should not."" The old man took that to mean he was collaborating, though that didn't explain the disappearing act. It was pitch black when we arrived at the little slice of suburbia that Larry called home. Even in the evening the scent of freshly cut grass wafted in the air. In the distance a dog barked to the cheering applause of crickets. The lights were all on, an oddly unsettling sight this time of night. We jogged up the drive, eyes darting back and forth like we were bandits in the night.

Which hey I guess we were hahaha.

We went around back, porch light buzzing above us. Paulie had his piece drawn, and I was carrying as well. Carlo liked to carry around this butterfly knife he found in a Chinatown back lot. He claimed he could do all sorts of tricks with it, but I never saw him try it. But I digress.

For some reason, none of us thought it prudent just to knock on the door or even call out to Larry. I had this gut feeling we shouldn't be there, and I could tell by the strained look in Paulie's eyes he thought the same.

Finally, Carlo said, ""Fuck it."" and leapt towards the back door, pounding on it like a madman in heat. ""Larry boy open up, we're friends of the old man."" He called out to nothing and was met with such. The dead silence from inside was starting to get unnerving; Paulie was giving me the ""We should get the fuck outta here."" side-eye.¬†

Carlo knocked on the door once more, only for it to slowly swing open-a light breeze chilling the air in front of us. The door swung open, the naked back hall beckoning us. It was at this time I took my piece out as well; Paulie had put his hands in the air and started to walk back up the drive.

""You gonna tell the old man you walked away?"" I shouted at him. Paulie paused in his tracks.¬†

""Sunnova bitch."" he grumbled, shoulder checking me as he entered the dragon. He turned back and saw us gawking at him, a hint of the devil on Carlo's and I's face. ""Come on you cocksuckas lets go."" He bellowed, and we scurried behind him like rats leaving a sinking ship.

Larry's home was. . . I guess cozy was the way to put it. There was a lingering smell of rot wafting in from the kitchen, but other than that it was homely. The walls were adorned with old family photos, glimpses into past of our missing comrade. There was a decent sized cube of a tv sitting in the corner, through the frayed and grainy image I think I could make out replays of last week's Giants game. A leather-bound recliner sat upright in front of it. Next to it a dinner tray with a warm beer on it. I took a whiff and gagged, smelled like dried out skunk piss.¬†

""Ooh, come here a second."" I heard Carlo holler from the kitchen. I was met with both him and Paulie standing around a dining room table. It was filled with rotting food, flies buzzing around set plates with half eaten homemade cooking that devolved into colorful slop.¬† It stunk to high heaven, Paulie was stepping back with his shoulder to his face to keep from dry heaving. Carlo was leaning over it all, hand rubbing his chin like he was goddamn Sherlock Holmes. Finally, he came next to me to share his observations. ""I think whoever was here left in a hurry."" He mused out loud.

I swear to you Paulie rose in the air and flew over just to smack him in the back of the head because I blinked and suddenly Carlo was going ""ouch"" and rubbing his scalp.¬†

""Fucking¬†*stunad*."" Paulie grumbled, a hint of dry vomit on his breath.

¬†""Three plates out, he must had company. He had no wife or kids.""¬† I countered. Paulie begrudged me that one.

""Wife died giving birth a few years back, kid only lasted a couple hours after that. Breach. Tragic shit."" He pondered aloud. There was a hint of empathy in his voice, but only enough to give the illusion of caring. There was a cup of sour milk at the head of the table, looked like aged tapioca. Carlo leaned over and sniffed it, again thinking he was some great detective. Ignoring him I turned to Paulie, who was deep in pondering.

""This has gotta be retaliation for sumthing right?"" I whispered harshly to him, my mind flashing back to the carpet fiasco. Paulie shook his head.

""Larry wasn't heavy with anyone, well liked, kept to himself. Even if it was a message, we would have received it by now,"" He remarked under his breath. Carlo came up behind me, probably about to say something that would make Paulie throttle him when we heard it.

*thump.*

The three of us looked up at the ceiling in unison, like it was some macabre stooges' bit. I thought it was a one off at first, the wind had knocked over a vase or something. That was when we heard the pitter-patter of feet scuttling around up there, sounded like a wild animal was crawling around.

Paulie held his gun like a security blanket as he gave the ceiling a death glare. Carlo was cautiously making his way to the stairs. The only sound was the fuzz of the ancient tv playing as we tiptoed through the living room. I peeked up the stairs, a soft thumping noise echoing down them. It was like it was taunting us, daring us to come and see. Carlo looked past me, a cocky look on his face. He had brought his knife out; he looked like a greaser displaced in time. He brushed past me, planting himself on the first step.

""Larry is that you up there?"" He called up, his voice booming in the small case. Paulie pushed him, steam powering out of every orifice on his head.

""Are your parents fifth generation inbreds? Ya ever hear of the element of surprise?"" Paulie growled.

""Oh, like they didn't hear us stomping in here,"" Carlo complained, brushing Paulie's hands off him. ""Your fat ass couldn't sneak up on a deaf nun."" I got in between them before they tore into each other, putting a finger to my lips and giving them both the death glare. They put aside their idiocy for a moment, coming together to find whatever was stalking the second floor. We crept up¬†weapons drawn, our senses sharp as daggers.

There was a rank smell up there, different then the rot. This was a-a musk of some kind. Strong and willful, the rancid stench of a sulfur miner coming off a twenty-hour shift. We put up our noises at it and studied the upstairs. Two halls, a crossroad in the middle leading further. To the right a bathroom, nothing special. To the left an old bedroom, set up like some kind of nursery. My heart ached seeing that, Larry boy never got over it.

Down the middle the stench grew stronger, drawing us in. Naturally we followed the smell, unsure of what we would find at the end. Two doors on either side, window smack dab in the middle. Both doors were closed, but we could hear movement, loud and scattered. It was impossible to tell what room held our mystery. Paulie flicked me in the chest with the butt of his gun.¬†

""I'll go right, you and shark bait over there take left."" He commanded in a hushed voice. Carlo was about to pipe up, but I jabbed him with my shoulder, following Paulie's lead. I put my ear to the door on the left, and I swear I heard hushed whispers. I couldn't make out what they were saying, but the voice sounded like it was gargling rocks and spite. I gave Carlo the nod and we burst through the door, and I aimed my piece at-

Nothing.

The room was empty. We were met with an unkempt queen size bed and a hardwood floor filled with dirty laundry. A couple pictures hung on the wall Esque, like the room had been met with a localized Earthquake. We went in on high alert, still not sure if we were alone. Carlo went over the closet and tore it open, jabbing his knife in and out like a nutjob. After he was done stabbing Larry's nice suits he gave me a shrug. That was when I noticed Paulie was being awfully quiet.

I looked over to see him clutching the doorway with one hand, repeatedly making the sign of the cross with the other. His face was crunched up and contorted in horror, like he had seen the gates of hell open up personally. He was muttering something under his breath, but I couldn't make it out. My guess it was some variation of the ""Hail Mary"" with his own personal flavor added in.

I approached slowly, touching his shoulder. As soon as my hand touched him, he twirled around and shoved his gun in my face. I didn't even blink at first, but I think I did piss myself a tad. He lowered it almost instantly, a look of fear glazing over him, his breath shaky and pained.¬†

""Franky-"" He choked out, ""-we need to get the fuck out of here, right now."" He sounded horrified. He pointed to the room and then booked it down the hall, not even waiting for us. Carlo joined me at the threshold, and we peered in. It was Larry's study, his desk overturned and crammed against the lime green walls. Papers littered the walls and floor, scribbled with some unknown language or simply Larry's sloppy handwriting. Engraved-carved in fact- in the middle of the floor was a circle adorned with strange symbols. In the middle of the circle was a nine-pointed star-and a barrier of salt surrounding the whole thing. Melted candles were glued to the points, the remnants of some god forsaken ritual Larry had done.

The air inside that room felt wrong, a chilling breeze greeted us from nowhere, the hairs on the back of my neck flashing warning signs. I couldn't help but notice the salt-line on the carving was broken, salt bursting outward and glistening on the floor. I almost socked Carlor in the jaw, he startled me so badly whispering right in my ear.

""Jesus, Mary and Joseph,"" He muttered next to me. ""Kinda sick shit was this guy into.""¬† Before I could reply we heard a thunderous crash from downstairs followed by Paulie screeching ""MUTHA OF FUCKING CHRIST!"" and the blast of his pistol. We raced downstairs, calling out for Paulie. We were halfway when we saw Paulie standing in the middle of the living room, panting and waving his gun wildly. A shattered chair lay next to him. He saw us standing there like idiots, his eyes wide and crazed. He pointed his gun at the kitchen as he yelled his explanation.

""They threw a fucking chair at me; it laughed and said my name and everything."" He rambled. We approached him with open arms, but come on huh? I was gonna try and calm him down when a plate whizzed past my head and shattered into pieces. The rotted slop it had held fell to the shag carpet. I faced the kitchen, seeing nothing there but a now half empty table. There was a gurgling sound, a sort of dark clucking, like whatever had done it was mocking us. Well Paulie had enough of that and raced out the backdoor with us nipping at his heel.

He covered us as we ran out the back, though I don't know what he would have done. We caught our breath in the drive, hearts racing a mile a minute. Paulie was keeping busy; he rummaged around back and eventually came out with a half empty gas canister and a dirty rag. He forced it in our hands, ordered us to stuff it and light it. He searched his pockets and came out with a metal lighter. I dumped a little gas on the house as Carlo doused and lit the rag.

Before long flames were quickly devouring the back porch and we were retreating back to the car. Paulie was already there, watching the place quickly become engulfed in flames. The heat was intense; we could feel it all the way from the end of the street. The house made a groaning sound like a wounded deer. Least I hope it was the house.

From the street we could see the upstairs window, and I swear to you junior I saw a figure standing there, highlighted by the raging fire. A dark shadow with eyes like dancing embers. I knew it wasn't my mind playing tricks because I could feel the thing reaching out to me, trying to tell me something. What it wanted, I couldn't tell you. It just felt like evil clawing at my mind. None of us said a word on the drive back. Paulie didn't leave his house for two weeks after that, when I finally did coax him out, he looked so shaken and dopey eyed, like he hadn't slept since that night.

Eventually he reverted back to his old jovial self, but he refused to comment on that night. Carlo and I just stuffed it all to the back of our minds, making jokes about that haunted house we saw one time. The implications of it all never really hit us, I didn't want it to. The fire ended up reducing the house to cinders, taking any evidence of Larry and his whereabouts with it.

My father was furious when he heard what happened, ""How do you screw up a simple welfare check huh?!? If I send you idiots to pick up a pie, ya gonna shoot poor old Luigi and rob him!?!"" He screamed at us from his office. Me and Carlo just stood there, embarrassed to even explain what we had seen. Anastasia stood by my father's side, her mystic emeralds studying us. She wore this flowing crimson dress, I think they were going to some party after my father was done chewing us out.¬†

She leaned down as he was catching a breath, whispering something secret only for him. My father had a strange look then, like he had been caught with his hand in the cookie jar. He faced away from us, a deep sigh rumbling from him as Anastasia curled around his shoulders.

""You boys had a rough night, nothing we could do for Larry in the end, I suppose you did what ya thought was best. Get outta here, give Paulie my regards."" and that was the end of that. I never did find out what Ana had said to him, but I suppose that's none of my business.

*-Senior takes a long pause, not even drinking. I cough to regain his attention, and he eyes me, sorrow creeping on his face. -*

I remember the first time I met Ana. Vinchenzo and ma had an unspoken agreement; he would never bring business home-and she would turn a blind eye to flaunting his girlfriend. He would take her to lavish parties, He would bury her in jewelry and romance, while doing the bare minimum for ma, the sweetest woman in the world.

I began to resent all of them frankly, him for doing it and her for letting it happen. It had been a few weeks of collection pickups; I had just gotten the Vega actually. The old man thought it was gawdy but fuck em, he wasn't slugging around town for his cronies. One night he tells me I'm going to drive him to dinner. My heart drops, it's Saturday night, HER night.

In front of ma, he tells me this, like he's enjoying twisting the knife. I swallow my pride and go ""Sure pop, whatever you say."" He has me dressed in a nice suit, he's in this old-time black and white two piece, it's like he stepped right out of a photo with Capone haha.

He sits in the back and tells me the address. He's silent pretty much the whole time, save for one moment when he tells me to ""Slow down, this ain't the Kentucky derby."" I pocket that comment to bitch about later and pull up in front of Anastasia's place.

It's an apartment building, old by the looks of it. There's a goofy looking ad by the door for ""Madame Ana"" with a picture of a gypsy caressing a crystal ball. Corny shit, and since the old man was ancient even then, I expected some dolled-up call-girl with a hiked-up dress and a faux turban to stroll out of that building.

Imagine the donkey-faced look I had when out strolled Helen of Troy. She couldn't have been much older than me, late 20s, early 30s. She wore a long, flowing blouse that left little to imagine. My father flicked the back of my neck, gesturing to open the door for her. I scrambled to open the passenger door for her, and her hand touched mine as Aphrodite slide next to the prune.

She flashed me a smile, her eyes locked onto mine as she did. I thought nothing of it at the time. I tried to focus the road as I drove them to Bella's; this gourmet place the old man was in the middle of busting out, as they cozied-up in the back seat. It was revolting to even think about, much less sit three inches away from. Finally, we made it to the joint, if you've seen one Italian joint you've seen them all, and I got out to open the door for them. Vinchenzo¬†patted me on the back as he passed, barely looking me in the eye as he whispered, ""Drive round the block for an hour or so,"" Ana raised her eyebrows, pouting as she replied,

""I had hoped the young gentleman could accompany us tonight."" Her accent was thick, like she had just stepped right off the boat. Vinchenzo looked at me, grinding his teeth and already regretting dragging me along.¬†

""Sounds like a nice time."" The inside was crawling with the who's who of Jersey scumbags that night. We were tucked away in a private booth, but every few minutes it seemed some half-drunk goombah was coming back to pay their respects. There was Paulie of course, he never missed an opportunity to grovel. There was Old Man Maroni, held up by two cronies forcing a smile as their boss babbled like a drunken idiot. Prince Charming was there, pre-face lift of course. There was Nicky Valant, few guys from New York; Benny Barino, Louie Stacks, even the Irish from across the bay were coming over to kiss his ass, and my father fucking hated the micks.

He would make a big show of showing Ana off like she was a cut of prized veal or something. Made my stomach churn, and from the look in her emeralds she felt the same. Eventually things settled down and we put in our orders. Ana leaned in eager to learn all about me. How was I liking my new gig, what'd I study, what was ""Vinny"" like growing up? I swore I saw him blush at that question. I tried to be polite and answer honestly:

""It can be a drag but good money- English Lit till I dropped out- And Vinny has always been the same¬†*miserabe*¬†he's always been right pop?"" I flashed him a grin at that and was meet with all the sense of humor dead fish could muster. Ana laughed though, a giggling bray that could crack any wall.¬†

""Vinny has told me so much about you, he's glad you've finally shown an interest in the business."" Dad shot her a look but said nothing.¬†

""I wouldn't go that far, just been driving some friends around really."" I sheepishly replied, little red showing up on my face. Ana scoffed playfully, waving her hand in a mock fashion.

""*Mio Dio*, handsome and modest, such a winning combination."" I blushed and cleared my throat, trying to change the subject.

""So, tell me ""Madame Ana."" you really got a crystal ball."" I cracked

.""Hey, watch ya remarks Franky boy."" ""Vinny"" warned, though that was met with a horse laugh by Ana.

""So quick to anger my beloved, you should watch that temper, lest it watch you."" She warned.¬† Her eyes flicked to me ""You Americans love your assumptions about my trade, so I play into them-just a tad."" Pfft, now who was being modest.

""Us Americans? You hearing this pop?"" I feigned outrage. Vinny shook his head, like he'd heard that line a 100 times before

""*Madone*¬†don't get her started, she'll go on for hours."" He lamented. I saw a fire blaze in Ana's eyes; she clucked her tongue and snapped her head back.

""You boys- you play the¬†*soldatino*¬†when you've never felt the boot of Rome on your neck."" She scoffed. Vinny took a swig of his white wine and chuckled darkly.

""I didn't mean to offend."" I offered ""Just never met a-uh, eh fuck it mystic before."" I tell you junior you could have cooked an egg on my forehead I was so red hahaha.¬†

""My mother taught me much-but she envied the sight I was blessed with."" There was a hint of sorrow in her voice. ""I had to leave quite suddenly. It was-luck I suppose I met your father so soon."" She placed a hand on his thigh and flashed a smile.

Our food soon arrived, carried by a plucky waiter with an obvious combover. He laid down a plate of shrimp scampi for my father- a stake for me and chicken parm with noodles for the lady. It smelled divine, cooked to perfection. I heard Ana say ""*Grazie.*"" to the waiter as he walked away as Vinny licked his lips.

Ana dug in immediately, stacking her fork in a mound of pasta, twirling a big chunk and gulping it down in one bite. A touch of sauce dribbled down her chin as she moaning, savoring every single morsel. Vinny was about to take a bite as well when Ana suddenly pointed at him, wagging her finger like he was a schoolboy.¬†

*""No, √® avvelenato.""*¬†she said, muffled as she chewed her food. Vinny scrunched his face, not understanding a word of what she had just said.

""Don't talk with ya mouth full-"" He began.

""Do not eat that-it's¬†*veleno*. Poison."" She said that last part slowly, sounding each syllable out like she had just learned the word I chewed the fat piece of meat I had rolling around in my mouth as my father turned as white and cotton as his bedsheets. The old man was trying to compose himself, eyes darting around the smashed room as the snakes he called friends partied on.¬†

""Who-who would have the fucking gall, here of all fucking places."" He sputtered in a ushed voice.

¬†""The short one-Nicky something with the toupee."" Ana replied so casually, eating like nothing was happening. I was stunned by this bold admission, but I sure as shit wasn't gonna take a bite of the scampi to find out for myself. ""He's upset you passed him over for the pretty boy.""

""Wh- Ricky? Kid's a top fucking earner-four times what Nicky brings in."" Vinny grumbled. Ana simply shrugged, continuing to enjoy her meal.¬†

""Eat then, what do I care-keel over and vomit out your ass in this nice place."" She said with venom. Vinny stewed and mulled his options. Finally, he quietly excused himself, waving over Paulie with a snap of his fingers. He whispered something in his ear, and I saw bloodlust overtake Paulie, as he snapped his focus to Nicky's table. He was lost in the sauce now, two girls on his arms as he told some foul joke. Two men I hadn't seen before appeared behind him, grabbing him and quickly escorting him to the back. A gaggle of wise guys followed suit, assuring the other patrons that nothing was wrong and to go about their business.

There was a mummer of discontent but ultimately no one cared as they dragged the protesting little guy away. I was alone with Ana now, twiddling away embarrassed at the sudden show of force and in awe of the sway she seemed to have over Vinny.¬†

""You saved his life."" I finally admitted breaking the tension. ""How'd you know?"" I squinted at her like an idiot heh. She dismissed me with a wave of her hand.

""Pfft, please huh? Lil Nicky will not be the one to topple the wall."" She squared her face at me. ""You have so much hatred for that man.""¬†

""That's my father you're talking about."" I said in a lower voice.

""He flaunts his adultery to your face, how could you not. A sick wife at home and he galivants with a younger woman. I am no saint Franklin, but he should know better."" she grimaced.

¬†""Well, you aren't exactly blameless in that."" I spat, and I regrated that instantly- to this day I don't know why.¬†

""You think me a whore? I am-disappointed but not surprised. Your father is boastful, but he does not act."" She gave me a lingering look to think that one over. The look on my face must have looked like a toddler trying to figure out how two and two make five-because she let out a low giggle, clearly enjoying my befuddlement.

""So... If he aint-""

""He wants to. But he covets my sight more. I've been his paramour for-two years now. You've seen his rise."" She lingered on that last thought. I had always wondered what his edge was-and now she was smirking at me from across the table.¬†

""And I always thought he was some tactical genius."" I murmured to myself.

""Is it not-ah- Tac-tic-al- to use every advantage you have against the wolves at your door?"" She countered. I didn't answer.¬† She narrowed her eyes at me. ""You are-how they say- ""Not the fastest horse in the race"" yes?"" She laughed playfully. I cracked a smile at that.

""Good thing I'm handsome then huh?"" I rose my glass in a toast. Ana met it with her own glass and the clink rang out. We chatted a little longer about her life in the old country until Vinny reappeared with the rough clearing of his throat. He was standing by Ana's side awkwardly-his knuckles course and bloody. His cuffs were caked in red, but he didn't seem to care.¬†

""We should get going here. They found a rat in the kitchen, need to clean it up a bit."" He lied. As we were leaving- Without paying mind you- I couldn't help but notice some of Pop's goons escorting patrons out. Must have been one hell of a rat in the back huh hehe.

Ride back to Ana's was quite- drove with the windows down and just let that cool breeze wash over me. When we got back Ana leaned into the driver's seat and wrapped her arms around me. She smelt like lavender. She told me it was wonderful meting me and hoped we could see each other again. I couldn't see Vinny's face when she did that, but I can imagine the seething it might have held.

He walked her back to the door, holding her by the waist. He leaned into her ear, whispering something. Ana blushed but pushed him back, shaking her head no. Dad gave her a peck on the cheek good night, and gave me one last glance before disappearing inside. Dad slammed the passenger side when he came back-clearly disgruntled.

He didn't have to say shit- I started the car back up and sped off. He huffed and puffed back there, finally catching me staring at him. he forced some good cheer on his face as he leaned back.

¬†""Heh, she's something ain't she Franky? Would have told ya to get lost so we could uh-get some coffee but, well I guess she needs a break. I wear her out something fierce."" He proclaimed boldly. I held my tongue, and the old man seemed satisfied at that. ""She seemed to take a liking to you."" He spoke. Again, he was met with silence. "" Nah that's good, she's good people. Just uh-don't forget who she was friends with first.""

He didn't say anything for the rest of ride-didn't need to. Motherfucker.

*(I stopped the recording here. He was flustered and needed a break. Frankly I did as well, I had no idea how big of an impact the life really had on him. I also had no idea he believed in so much hocus pocus crap, I'll have to drill him for more on that. I did notice something though, when Senior was talking about that Ana woman. It was his eyes. They were filled with pain. I'll update as soon as I can-until then; I guess beware ghosts throwing chairs.*)",2,1745595029.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

The four of you were sitting at the dining table, having a merry old time. Nero was busy stuffing his face as if this was truly his last meal. Lenda was busy humming and stuffing her face with sweets as if she didn‚Äôt have a care in the world. Nano split his time between quietly analyzing their mercurial behavior and staring at his empty plate as if he was in subspace eating cyber-food.

The dining hall had quieted down now that everyone was seated. A couple more vampires had sat down at the long table, pushing the total to eight. You had no idea if this was everyone or if everyone even needed to eat. The whole idea of vampires eating was... different. Let‚Äôs face it. Angel Hunters was... different. It was a world where long-established rules were broken more easily than the chalk on a mathematician‚Äôs chalkboard who was eating junk food while trying to solve the post physical equation that broke all of science‚Äôs long-established rules. You know. How it was possible for SAI to live in a dimension that did not contain matter. ¬†

Lenda‚Äôs sudden eruption was like nails on a chalkboard, ruining our hypothetical theoretical physicist‚Äôs mindboggling calculations. She took an enormous bite into her Danish, and then a huge chug of her coffee concoction while putting away her AirPods. After that, she tossed the carrying bag holding her sword over her shoulder and blurted: ‚ÄúUgh! That‚Äôs it! I can‚Äôt wait any longer. The anticipation is freaking *killing* me!!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù Nero asked.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going over there to meet Scarlet.‚Äù

‚ÄúHah. Good luck with that,‚Äù Nero snickered.

The giggling girls, who were sitting at the table behind yours, had an eruption of their own. They laughed when Lenda dashed over to the ‚Äúfreakshow‚Äù table and sat down next to Dacia. Sensei and Scarlet stared at her suspiciously; they were sitting on the other side. Dacia frowned and checked her neck to make sure she still had her necklace. When she did this, Lenda feigned shock and told her that she did not come over to steal. ‚ÄúAnd besides, I don‚Äôt need to sit right next to you to swipe your possessions. I can do that without you even noticing.‚Äù

‚ÄúHumph. That doesn‚Äôt make me feel any better.‚Äù

‚ÄúOMD. Calm down. I‚Äôm not here to bother you.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen why are you here exactly?‚Äù Dacia asked.

Lenda extended her hand to Scarlet. ‚ÄúHi. I‚Äôm Lenda.‚Äù

Scarlet glowered at her like a mental patient.

Lenda glared right back at her with an even crazier expression of her own. A look that shouted, ‚ÄúI got my sword from the Black Church!‚Äù Her mask slipped as she quietly but assertively told her, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt take no for an answer, love.‚Äù¬† ¬†¬†

Scarlet relented and shook her hand but said nothing.

‚ÄúGreat. Now tell me all about yourself. Start from the beginning.‚Äù

Sensei quickly butted in, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a good idea.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù Lenda asked.

Sensei placed a hand under his chin and stared at Lenda for a moment. Hmm. She might seem like a happy camper, but there was something sinister lurking just beneath the surface of those misty eyes, maybe it was an alligator, swimming around in a swamp of bones, waiting for the perfect chance to add another skeleton to its collection. He wondered about that sword of hers... if the legend was true. If the person he was thinking really had been trapped inside. He glanced over at Scarlet and then back at Lenda, before deciding to throw her a lifeline. ‚ÄúYou know. Scarlet is an excellent fortune teller. You should let her tell yours.‚Äù

‚ÄúYay! What does my future tell?‚Äù

Scarlet shook her head no.

‚ÄúAw. Why not?‚Äù Lenda asked.

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt work like that,‚Äù Dacia said.

‚ÄúReally? Why not?‚Äù Lenda asked.

‚ÄúShe can only commune in her room.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd she told you your future?‚Äù

‚ÄúUm... yes‚Ä¶‚Äù Dacia said, somehow caught by surprise by what was an obvious next question. She allowed her mind to wander as her eyes lingered on the delicate floor patterns. Anything was better than thinking about her tragic future.

‚ÄúCool. What did it say?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna talk about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWow. It‚Äôs that bad, really?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs... my brother,‚Äù she muttered back.

‚ÄúWhat about you?‚Äù Lenda asked Sensei.

A hint of darkness flashed in his eyes like a magician, matching his smoky smirk perfectly, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt have a future if you‚Äôre already dead.‚Äù

‚ÄúYikes,‚Äù Lenda shivered out.

She turned to Scarlet for confirmation. Had Sensei‚Äôs soul really been sold to the Raven? Had his mortal coil really been left to never decay? Withered bitterness and fitful hatefulness: *twisted* and woven into the very fabric of nothingness and emptiness. Like the *twisted* hand of God that reached out into the unknown before the light was ever known. His captor... their tormentor... She was *everywhere* and nowhere. *Lady Darkness...* Before and after. Forever and never. Whenever you run, wherever you hide‚Ä¶ she‚Äôll catch you and take you to a place the angels fear.

Lenda snapped out of it. She didn‚Äôt even want to look at Sensei as she muttered, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why Nero is so afraid of you. Wow Sensei. I can‚Äôt believe you made a deal with something that bad!‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have a choice,‚Äù he told her.

‚ÄúI know‚Ä¶‚Äù Lenda uttered. She thought about the implications a second longer before completely pushing the whole idea out of her mind. Her smile returned as she studied Scarlet. The girl was a miserable mystery she couldn‚Äôt wait to crack. *‚ÄúSo.* When can I come to your room? I‚Äôd love to hear what you have to say about my future.‚Äù

\---

‚ÄúHow do you do, Mr. Hunter? Brought you an extra helping,‚Äù Chelsa said before setting another plate down in front of him that was loaded with food. Her timing couldn‚Äôt have been any better. She smiled at the way his eyes glowed at the sight of warm victuals.

‚ÄúThank you‚Äîhey! What‚Äôre you doing?‚Äù he asked when she sat down in the vacant seat next to him. ‚ÄúGah! Why can‚Äôt I enjoy anything in peace?‚Äù he moaned.

‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt be such a fussbudget about everything,‚Äù Chelsa said with a smile. She propped her elbow on the table and carried on making his life miserable, ‚ÄúShare a morsel or two about you. Really. It doesn‚Äôt have to be much, anything‚Äôll do.‚Äù

‚ÄúEh. Anything like what?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúAny girlfriends?‚Äù she asked back.

‚ÄúUh. That‚Äôs a personnel question.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also a yes or no question.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo‚Äîwell‚ÄîI-I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

‚ÄúMm. Interesting. Her name?‚Äù

‚ÄúEh. Freya‚Äînone of your business.‚Äù

She poked him on the arm and claimed, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I like about you. You always stick to your guns. Especially when you‚Äôre in the line of fire.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that supposed to mean?‚Äù he asked with a salty expression.

The other maid, who was working as a tweeny, came over. Her presence unsalted the mood a bit because it got Chelsa to stop peppering him with questions. The two girls shared an ill-advised chortle about something only they knew.

‚ÄúWell? Are you going to introduce me?‚Äù her friend asked.

Chelsa rolled her eyes before announcing to the table, ‚ÄúCome on, gather round everyone. This here lovely lass is Eliza. She‚Äôs as bossy as she is clever.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreetings,‚Äù Eliza said cheerfully, before returning her friend‚Äôs sarcasm with a bit of wit of her own. ‚ÄúShe also failed to mention ‚Äòhardest worker.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a package, aye?‚Äù Chelsa smiled.

Eliza stuck out like a manicured thumb on a zombie‚Äôs hand. Not just because of her natural beauty and charm, but because she was a vampire from the Levant with a rare Greek bloodline. Her family were bluebloods that could trace their lineage all the way back to the fallen empire. How she found her way all the way here under B√°thory tutelage was an interesting story. Many years back when she was only a small child, her family had been displaced during one of the many holy purges by one of the many zealot factions that ran rampant in the region.

Marie‚Äôs father, Fredrick, hired Eliza‚Äôs father, Petros, as a chef for the estate. He became known for his exotic cuisine and, um, eccentric human-hunting techniques that always seemed to toe the line of legality. Well, his methods caught up to him in the worst way. He violated the Blood Codes by taking the life of a human dignitary during a particularly rowdy dinner party. Yeah. Things got out of hand. He probably shouldn‚Äôt have accepted the dare, and he most certainly should have heeded the warning of the blood bishop who was in attendance.

Sadly, his usual trickery and bribery couldn‚Äôt save him. He did the deed right there at the table, during Undead Supper, in front of hardliners from the Dark Order. He was jailed almost immediately inside of the B√°thory Estate‚Äôs dungeon, where he was given a quick inquisition and then slated for immolation. Things looked pretty bleak for our flamboyant chef. But by some dark miracle, he was spared at the literal last minute. How did he defy the odds? Well. He would always bring his daughter to work with him. Because of this, Eliza and Marie would always find themselves playing together. It was super difficult for Marie to find friends, given the nature of her station. Eliza was truly one of the few vampires she had grown a bond with that hadn‚Äôt been killed by a rival clan, purged by fanatics, or shipped off as a retainer to some faraway court.

Marie begged her father to do something when she found out the bad news. He took her pleas seriously and promised that he would indeed ‚Äúdo something.‚Äù It took some fierce fenagling, but in the end, he was able to save him. Petros was ordered to hand all his property over to the dark church. He also agreed to allow his daughter to become a retainer for the B√°thory household. The conditions were harsh, but anything was better than, you know, being burned alive at the stake. And so, after a tearful goodbye to his daughter, who was now a teenager, with aspirations of her own, he left to join a dark monastery in the Romanian homeland. The crazy part about his plea deal was that it turned out to be a pretty sweet deal for everyone. Marie got a playmate, Eliza got to join their prestigious household, and Fredrick gained one point on the ‚Äòbeneficent ruler scorecard.‚Äô

It even worked out for Petros. He was able to renounce his old life of hedonism and daedal human-hunting for a nice naughty life of piety and dark virtue. It‚Äôs a good thing they spared him too because he became a very powerful warlock in his own right. He was the one who found a way for castors to linger longer in the fade without dying from severe soul sickness. A horrible condition that deteriorated the flesh after every dimensional shift. The fade was the transitional string between angelic metaphysical space and human dimensional space.

Eliza smiled at you. You could see it in her eyes without her even having to say it. *‚ÄúWhenever she was in the kitchen, she was at home.‚Äù* She was like a conservative version of Lenda without AirPods, dancing to the music in her own head. That‚Äôs how much she loved to be around all things culinary. Her medium length dark brown curly hair was pulled back. Her jubilant brown eyes were full of life and curiosity. She looked a bit older than the other maids but not as much as Teresa. Hmm... if you had to guess, she was maybe twenty-eight? She was also always wearing a sneaky smirk or wiry smile, which was the exact opposite of Scarlet, who was always sporting a scowl. Her uniform was stained by the rigors of kitchen duty even more than Chelsa‚Äôs. She apologized for not shaking your hand. Hers were greasy from scrubbing pots and pans. That was the reason she was here. To grab Chelsa so they could finish cleaning in the back.

Chelsa pretended to fuss over it, but her heart was never in it. ‚ÄúJeez. He was just starting to warm up to me and you come over and ruin all the fun.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh please. He‚Äôs not interested in you, lady.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not? Are you saying I‚Äôm not his type?‚Äù

Eliza zoomed in on Dacia and said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs his type.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh? Is that true, you only like the dainties?‚Äù

‚ÄúWha?! That‚Äôs ridiculous!‚Äù Nero said vehemently.

Chelsa and Eliza shared a laugh as if it were an Almond Joy. While wiping the tears of *‚Äú*Joy*‚Äù* from her eyes, she leaned into his ear and told him, ‚ÄúNow that‚Äôs one thing we do have in common. We‚Äôre both stubborn old mules. Hah! You and I both know I won‚Äôt give up the chase that easily,‚Äù she said with a wink before catching up to Eliza.

‚ÄúF\*\*k, baby‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre so f\*\*king tightÔºÅ‚Äù  
The night before my wedding, I walked into our honeymoon suite‚Ä¶ and caught my fianc√©, Wyatt, pounding my bridesmaid like a godda\*n pornstar.  
My heart stopped. My blood boiled. Those two filthy, cheating assholesÔºÅ  
I ripped off my engagement ring and hurled it straight at that lying bastard‚Äô face. F\*\*k your wedding, Wyatt.  
I stormed out, hit the nearest bar, and downed shots like my life depended on it. That‚Äôs when I saw him‚ÄîAxel. Wyatt‚Äôs tribe‚Äôs Alpha.  
Tall. Broad. Gorgeous as sin. And radiating raw, dangerous, sexual energy that made my thighs clench.  
I licked my lips. If I slepted with his Alpha, wouldn‚Äôt that be the perfect revenge?  
I walked straight up to him. ‚ÄúTake me to a hotel.‚Äù  
He raised an eyebrow, those deep green Alpha eyes burning into mine.‚ÄúYou sure you know what you‚Äôre asking for?‚Äù  
‚ÄúI know exactly what I want.‚Äù  
The rest of the night was a blur of heat and sweat.  
He threw me onto the bed like I weighed nothing, peeled off my bra with skilled fingers, and his mouth was on me‚Äîhot and rough. His lips wrapped around my n\*\*ple as he sucked and bit, sending shock waves through my body.  
His hand slid down my stomach, stopping at the slick heat between my thighs.  
I gasped as he touched me‚Äîslow, teasing strokes that had me moaning into the dark.  
‚ÄúF\*\*k, you‚Äôre so sexy,‚Äù he growled, working me with his fingers. When he felt how wet I was, he groaned against my skin, low and primal.  
Then he moved between my legs. I squeezed my eyes shut, bracing myself‚Äî And then he thrust into me, hard. My scream echoed off the walls.  
Axel let out a deep, feral roar as he came.  
‚ÄúAgain,‚Äù he murmured against my lips‚Äîalready kissing me, already hard again.  
The next morning, I tried to sneak out while he was still asleep. But no such luck.  
He caught my wrist. ‚ÄúHold up,‚Äù he said, voice husky. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm remembering right‚Ä¶ today‚Äôs your wedding day, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù  
I froze.  
Wait‚Äîwhat? He knew who I was?!!  
  
Chapter 1 Betrayal  
Liana‚ÄúI‚Äôm the happiest girl alive,‚Äù I exclaim excitedly as I twirl through the living room of my best friend, Nina, apartment. ‚ÄúIn less than twenty-four hours, I‚Äôll be Mrs Wyatt Miller.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre also going to be a tired bride if you don‚Äôt go to bed,‚Äù Nina laughs. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs already ten o‚Äôclock and you have an early morning and busy day ahead of you before you can walk down the aisle.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúDo you think I can call him before I go to bed?‚Äù I ask as I fall onto the couch. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a terrible tradition not to see the groom before the big day.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúLiana, the man is most likely already in bed,‚Äù Nina sighs. ‚ÄúAnd you should be too.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúCan you believe he built me a house?‚Äù I sit up and look at her. ‚ÄúMe, poor Liana from the trailer park with the hand-me-down clothes, are moving into a brand-new house. Build and furnished just for me.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYeah, yeah,‚Äù Nina rolls her eyes. ‚ÄúYou won the lotto, I know.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúOh, Nina,‚Äù I look pleadingly at her. ‚ÄúI know you don‚Äôt like Wyatt that much, but can‚Äôt you be just a little bit excited for me? This is my dream come true.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that I dislike him,‚Äù Nina sighs heavily. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just ‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs a werewolf and you‚Äôre a human. I‚Äôm just looking out for you, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúAnd I love you for that,‚Äù I stand up, walk to her and take her hands in mine. ‚ÄúYou are the best friend in the world and that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre my maid of honour.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because I‚Äôm your best friend that I worry,‚Äù she says softly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been living within these borders my entire life and this pack of wolves are not known for their kindness and humanity.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs also an honour to be mated to one of them,‚Äù I say urgently. ‚ÄúEspecially if it‚Äôs the Delta‚Äôs son. I will have prestige and status and will finally have money to send to my parents. They‚Äôre not getting any younger and with Dad‚Äôs health declining and my brother‚Äôs issues ‚Ä¶ they have sacrificed so much for me, Nina. I want them to relax and enjoy retirement without wondering about where they‚Äôre going to get their next meal. My dreams are coming true and taking care of my parents is a bonus.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right,‚Äù Nina smiles after a while. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm worried for no reason. Now, go to bed so that you can be the prettiest bride this pack has ever seen.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù I hug her tightly before I go to my room.  
  
I cannot stop smiling as I look at my wedding dress that is hanging behind my door. Quickly I go through my suitcase and double-check that I have packed everything. Shoes, lingerie, veil ‚Ä¶ oh no! My veil is not here! I left it at home.  
  
Oh, well, I smile to myself as I tiptoe to the front door without disturbing Nina. This is the perfect excuse to go home and surprise Wyatt.  
  
\*\*  
  
I take a moment to admire the house that we will be living in for a moment before I walk to the front door. I unlock the door as quietly as I can and step inside. I feel as giddy as a schoolgirl as I imagine Wyatt‚Äôs face when I surprise him.  
  
Silently I make my way to our future bedroom but the closer I get, the deeper my frown goes. Clearly, I can hear the pleasurable moans of a man and a woman. What the hell? Is Wyatt watching p\*\*n?  
  
I surely hope not. That is such a filthy custom and not something I want to deal with. Especially not on my honeymoon.  
  
No, I shake my head. Not my Wyatt. After seven years, I know everything about him that there is to know. He is most likely only watching a movie with a provocative scene.  
  
I continue my way to the bedroom but stop dead in my tracks when I reach the door. My fingers fly to my mouth and my eyes nearly pop out of their sockets as I stare at the scene in disgust.  
  
Gwen, my bridesmaid, is standing on all fours on the bed as Wyatt violently thrusts into her.  
  
‚ÄúYes, baby, yes,‚Äù Gwen pants. ‚ÄúHarder. Harder.‚Äù  
  
She screams loudly as his fingers dig deeper into her hips as he obeys her request.  
  
‚ÄúYes! Yes!‚Äù She shouts.  
  
I want to turn around and run away. I want to cry and scream and shout. I want to throw up and crumble into a ball. But I do not. I am numb and lifeless. I am standing in the doorway, staring at my friend and fianc√© as they satisfy their most carnal need. It is like standing on the tracks and watching the oncoming train heading right for you. You know you should move but you are frozen.  
  
When Wyatt cries out his o\*\*\*\*m, my heart shatters into a million pieces. Gwen wiggles her hips until she reaches her climax before she collapses forward on the bed.  
  
‚ÄúThanks, babe,‚Äù Wyatt slaps Gwen on her ass before he crawls onto the bed next to her. ‚ÄúYou always know how to satisfy a man.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúUnlike your fianc√©?‚Äù She giggles and curls up in his arms.  
  
‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù he scoffs. ‚ÄúYou know I‚Äôve never f\^cked her.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúIs that why you‚Äôre marrying her?‚Äù Gwen pouts as she draws circles on his chest with her finger. ‚ÄúBecause she‚Äôs a virgin?‚Äù  
  
They are talking about me, I realize. I am standing right here, and they have no idea. They are so absorbed in their lust that they do not even see me. Are wolves not supposed to smell others? Or is the aroma of sex so overwhelming that they do not catch up on my scent?  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm marrying her because she‚Äôs my mate,‚Äù he grunts. ‚ÄúAnd you know that.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just reject her?‚Äù Gwen sulks. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs human, she won‚Äôt feel the pain like a she-wolf. Then you and I can be together like we want to be.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYou know I can‚Äôt do that,‚Äù he kisses her tenderly. ‚ÄúI must be married to my mate if I want to be Delta one day. Do you rather want to be the mistress of the Delta or the wife of an Omega?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúBut once you‚Äôre married, I won‚Äôt be able to see you as often,‚Äù she whimpers. ‚ÄúAnd as her husband, you‚Äôll have to sleep with her.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúOnly until she gives me my son,‚Äù he smiles sweetly. ‚ÄúI promise you. Once my son is born, I will never touch her again.‚Äù  
  
The more they talk, the more life returns to my loins. My initial shock and devastation have made space for pure, hot anger.  
  
‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I sneer as I cross my arms in front of my chest. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt this cosy?‚Äù  
  
Both Gwen and Wyatt jerk upright and stare at me in shock.  
  
‚ÄúLiana,‚Äù Wyatt is the first to react and he scrambles out of bed. ‚ÄúThis is not what you think. I ‚Ä¶ we ‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúOh, spare me,‚Äù I spat the words angrily. ‚ÄúI watched the entire show. This is exactly what it looks like.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs right, Wyatt,‚Äù Gwen smiles smugly as she pulls Wyatt‚Äôs t-shirt over her head. ‚ÄúThis is exactly what it looks like.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúGwen, not now,‚Äù Wyatt hisses urgently.  
  
‚ÄúWhy not now?‚Äù Gwen shrugs. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs seen and heard it all, there‚Äôs no use in denying it.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI thought you were my friend,‚Äù I look at her with disgust and hatred.  
  
‚ÄúHow can I possibly be your friend when you want what‚Äôs mine?‚Äù She sneers as she steps closer to me.  
  
‚ÄúYours?‚Äù I gape at her. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs my mate.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúHe might be your mate,‚Äù she smirks as she places herself in front of me. ‚ÄúBut I have his heart.‚Äù  
  
‚Äúb\*\*\*h!‚Äù I yell as the palm of my hand connects hard and loudly with her cheek.  
  
Gwen‚Äôs head jerk to the side from the impact and she stumbles backwards.  
  
‚ÄúGwen, baby,‚Äù Wyatt rushes to her side. ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she whimpers, and he cradles her into his embrace.  
  
‚ÄúYou assho1e,‚Äù I shout as I shove Wyatt away from Gwen and he looks at me with shock. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm your fianc√©. But you‚Äôre more concerned about your whore than you‚Äôre about me.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúLiana, enough,‚Äù Wyatt bellows as he grabs me by the wrists. His eyes are burning into mine. ‚ÄúYou do not get to talk to me like that.‚Äù  
  
‚Äúf\^ck you,‚Äù I jerk my hands free from his hold. ‚ÄúAnd your whore.‚Äù  
  
I look at them with anger and hatred as I pull off my engagement ring.  
  
‚ÄúTake this,‚Äù I shout and toss the ring at them. ‚ÄúLet her birth your heir, and good luck with becoming the next Delta.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúLiana, wait,‚Äù Wyatt turns pale as he reaches for me, but I had enough.  
  
I turn on my heels and run as fast as I can.  
  
‚ÄúLiana, please,‚Äù Wyatt runs after me. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs talk about this like adults.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I yell furiously as I turn to face him. ‚ÄúThere is nothing to talk about. There is nothing that you can say or do to undo what I have witnessed. You made your bed, sleep in it.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù he reaches for me, but I slap his hand away, turn around and run into the night.  
Chapter 2 Take me home  
Liana POVBlindly, I run down the street as tears stream down my face. I cannot believe this. I have seen it with my own two eyes, but it still feels surreal.  
  
I have no idea how far I have run but my feet are hurting and for the first time I notice my surroundings. In my devastating state, I have run out of the residential area into town. A neon sign, Spike's, catches my eye, and I decide to go in.  
  
I am tired and thirsty. I need the rest. It is not like I have to get up early tomorrow anymore.  
  
The music is too loud and the bar too smoky for comfort, but I prefer it like this. At least if someone notices I have been crying, I can blame the smoke. I push past people until I find a chair at the bar, and I take a seat.  
  
""What will it be?"" A bearded man asks me.  
  
""Vodka tonic,"" I order. ""Make it a double and keep them coming.""  
  
""Are you driving?"" The man raises his eyebrows.  
  
""Nope,"" I shake my head. ""I don't even own a bicycle.""  
  
""Okay,"" he shrugs nonchalantly as he turns away to mix my drink.  
  
Absentmindedly, I look at the people as I wait for my drink. What a f\*\*\*\*d-up night to be surrounded by people celebrating life. I am disillusioned, disappointed, sad, heartbroken and angry.  
  
""Here you go,"" the man puts my drink down and I smile weakly before I finish it off immediately.  
  
""Easy, girl,"" the man smirks. ""Or you'll regret it in the morning.""  
  
""I will not possibly regret it as much as I regret today,"" I motion for him to bring me another.  
  
The man only shakes his head as he hands me another drink. This time, I drink it slower as my mind dwells on the day I met Wyatt. Coming from a poor family, my prospects were not high. But I clawed my way from doing dishes in a restaurant to junior manager. Then Wyatt and his friends visited the restaurant one night while I was on duty. The second he looked at me, I could see the lust in his eyes. He kept coming to the restaurant until I agreed to go on a date with him.  
  
Only after two years did he tell me that he was a werewolf and explain the mate bond to me. Initially, I was scared but also flattered that I was chosen for him. I ‚Äì the girl who was never good enough for the rich kids ‚Äì was chosen as his mate.  
  
Now that I think of it, Gwen was also part of his group the first time I saw him. And she always was. Gwen was friendly and warm, and I quickly regarded her as a friend.  
  
""f\*\*k me,"" I mumble as I finish my glass and wink at the barkeep for another.  
  
I was so blind and na√Øve. I went to Gwen with all my insecurities and questions about werewolves and Wyatt. And she was so helpful every time. Now I know better. But now is too late. I have quit my job at the restaurant and moved into the pack's borders. Now I am nothing more than a puny human surrounded by wolves with no mate, no place to live, and no job. I am back where I started ‚Äì being poor with little to no prospects. I have no choice but to move back to my parents' trailer and start from the bottom.  
  
A murmur rustles through the bar and curiously I stretch my neck to see what the commotion is about. People are making way for a man who is walking to the VIP section. High cheekbones with full lips. Square jaw and a straight nose. His black hair is neat and short in his neck, but long and wavey on top. But it is his emerald green eyes that make my mouth turn dry. His stare is cold and direct, and it feels like he is looking right through me.  
  
Deliberately I look away when I realize who he is. That is the Alpha's son, Axel. I have never met him, but Wyatt has told me plenty about him. A ruthless narcissist, that is what Wyatt called him. And from what I can remember, Axel is due to take over as alpha at the end of this year.  
  
I look at my watch and am surprised to see it is past midnight already. I have lost track of time and of the number of vodkas I have thrown back. My head is fuzzy and my legs wobbly when I stand up. Unsteadily, I grab hold of the counter to support myself and not fall over.  
  
With fumbling fingers, I manage to fish enough money out of my back pocket to pay for my drinks and tip the barkeeper. I pull a face when I realize that I do not have enough cash for a taxi to get home. I left my cell phone and wallet at Nina's when I left and only took cash for transportation. Oh, well, this mishap suits this disastrous night perfectly.  
  
I turn around to leave and bump into a man's chest.  
  
""Sorry,"" I apologize as I grab onto his arms to not land on my ass.  
  
The arms and chest I am standing against are rock-hard and muscular.  
  
""Hmm,"" I smile as I squeeze his biceps. ""Nice.""  
  
""Are you always this forward?"" The man growls and slowly, I look up at his face.  
  
My breath hitches in my throat as I recognize Axel. He looks at me emotionlessly and something inside me snaps. I gave up everything for a man and he tossed me aside like nothing. Now this gorgeous devil is looking at me like nothing and I am not nothing, dammit.  
  
""Take me home,"" I blurt out the words.  
  
""What?"" He frowns and for a second I swear he was about to smile.  
  
""You heard me,"" I keep my composure, but I already regret what I think I am about to do.  
  
""Are you drunk?"" He looks at me suspiciously.  
  
""As a skunk,"" I confirm.  
  
""Go home, little girl,"" he pushes me aside. ""Before the big, bad wolf catches you.""  
  
""Why?"" I challenge him and he turns to me in disbelief.  
  
""Do you have any idea who I am?"" He hisses at me.  
  
""Does it matter?"" I raise my eyebrows. ""I don't recall asking your name or offering mine. But I do remember proposing a night together.""  
  
""Just leave,"" he huffs.  
  
""Why?"" I ask again. ""Can't you get it up?""  
  
I hold my finger up between us and bend it like a wilted flower.  
  
""Let's hope you don't regret this,"" he grunts as he grabs my hand and drags me after him outside of the bar.  
  
Neither of us says a word as we cross the street to the closest hotel. I do not make eye contact with anybody. Which is hard because everyone is looking at us curiously. But it does not seem to bother Axel at all.  
  
By the time we reach the room, I have sobered up enough to realize what I have done. For a second I consider apologising and leaving but then I decide against it. Why should I? This man is drop-dead gorgeous, and I am certain every female ‚Äì and some males ‚Äì would die to be in my shoes right now. And what do I have to show for my miss goody two-shoe lifestyle? Humiliation and a broken heart. I deserve a little fun.  
  
The second the door closes behind us, Axel starts taking off his clothes and I stare at him with big eyes.  
  
""What are you waiting for?"" He grunts. ""Undress.""  
  
I do not say a word as I kick off my sneakers and start undoing my jeans.  
  
""You're taking too long,"" Axel complains and pulls my t-shirt over my head. Shame threatens to engulf me when I am only in my underwear, but he does not seem to care. In fact, he does not even seem interested.  
  
He picks me up and places me on the bed before he unhooks my bra. His mouth is warm and rough as his lips capture my n\*\*\*\*e and I lay motionless as he sucks and nibbles on me. I have no idea what is to be expected of me.  
  
His hand trails down my stomach until he settles between my legs and a strange warmth pool in my nether region. He gently starts stroking me and I unexpectedly moan softly.  
  
""That's better,"" he mumbles against my breast as his fingers keep on stroking and rubbing me. Embarrassment overflows me as I feel the moisture between my legs, but he seems pleased as he groans against my skin.  
  
He lifts himself and settles between my legs and I close my eyes tightly to not look at him. He penetrates me hard and fast, and I cannot contain the scream that escapes my lips.  
  
I bite hard on my lip to keep myself from making a sound as he shoves into me over and over. My fingers curl into the linen as I absorb the pain.  
  
Axel releases a loud growl as he reaches his c\*\*\*\*x, and his breathing is heavy as he smiles at me.  
  
""Again,"" he says before kissing me.  
Chapter 3 Morning After  
Liana POVI grunt in pain when I stretch out and instantly lay still. Everything hurts. From my throbbing head down to my ankles. Flashes of the previous night bombard my brain and I cringe.  
  
Alcohol has created a band that is keeping an offbeat rhythm in my head, sending waves of pain against my temples and eyes. And the pain in the rest of my body ‚Ä¶ well, Axel is responsible for that. He was not a gentle lover.  
  
I open my eyes partially and look at my surroundings. Sunrays are dancing through the curtains, and it takes me a moment to realize I am still in the hotel room.  
  
Oh s\*\*t, what have I done? I pinch my eyes closed and send a silent prayer that Axel has left already.  
  
My life shattered into pieces last night and I made it worse by indulging not only in alcohol but also in a stranger's body. When I propositioned Axel, I was too intoxicated to take into account the walk of shame. Why did I not sneak out while he was sleeping? Oh yeah, I was too drunk and tired.  
  
Well then, that is it, I decide as I slowly turn around, I have hit rock bottom and ruined my life. Sure, Wyatt helped me out in that department, but I was the one who got drunk all on my own and challenged a man to take me to bed.  
  
Dammit, I groan inwardly when I see Axel snoring next to me. Is it really that much to ask the universe for a break? Why did he not leave like other men do? Not that I have experience in this department, but hey, is that not the theme of every Hollywood movie?  
  
As quietly as I can, I worm out of bed. With any luck, I can be out of here before he wakes up.  
  
""Order coffee,"" his voice demands behind me and with a shriek I turn around.  
  
His eyes dartle lazily over my body and I blush beet red when I realize I am naked. I reach over for the blanket and jerk it off the bed to cover my nakedness.  
  
Oh no, that was a mistake, I swallow as I look at the floor. Axel is sprawled out in the bed with his crown jewels on display and apparently, it does not bother him one little bit.  
  
""Why so shy?"" he chuckles as he puts his hands behind his head. ""I've seen it all last night.""  
  
Because you are looking at me as if I am your breakfast, I think to myself as I ignore him and start gathering my clothes.  
  
""I should go,"" I mumble as I quickly put on my T-shirt. I am not going to bother with my bra right now. Not while he is watching. My only mission is to get out of here as fast as possible with as much dignity as I can master.  
  
""Not before you ordered my coffee,"" his tone of voice is superior as he stands up. ""Then you ‚Ä¶""  
  
He abruptly stays quiet, and I follow his gaze to the blood stain in the centre of the bed. I swallow hard on the regret and tears as I look at the evidence of the exact price I paid for my drunken stupidity.  
  
For twenty-six years I have protected my virtue at all costs. Not because of some belief or because I am a prude. But coming from a poor home, this was the most valuable gift that I could give to the man I love. Something pure and priceless and I gave it away ‚Ä¶ for free ‚Ä¶ to a stranger.  
  
""Your first time?"" His voice is dark and low as he looks at me.  
  
""What?"" I shrug and pretend not to care. ""Do you have a virgin complex?""  
  
He is quiet for a long time as he holds my gaze to the point where I have to fight myself to remain still and not start squirming.  
  
""How much?"" He growls and I am taken aback by his anger.  
  
""How much what?"" I frown confused.  
  
""Don't be obtuse,"" he hisses furiously. ""Money. How much do you want?""",1,1745594937.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

He fails to notice the signal change.
People on the sidewalk stand and stare.
He tries to shake it off, to keep going,
but the edges remain blurred,
caught somewhere between sleep and the pull of the day.

The world feels warm and weightless,
a soft melody, a held note,
a repeating note.

Tap. Tap.

Alarm!

Eyes open first, then motion.
Sheets slip, phone in hand, feet hit the floor.
The rhythm kicks in.

He‚Äôs up. 
Emails flash.
Three flagged, nothing unexpected, text from brother. 
It can wait.

Down the stairs; momentum and cadence. A slight groove moves in. 

The click of the coffee, the hiss of the shower, water running over his body, the toothbrush scrapes to tempo, a sip and a spit. Each motion part of the score.

Back to the kitchen;the coffee machine spurts and exhales, settling in to the final drip like a cymbal tap before the downbeat.

Pour. Stir. Sip. Breathe.

One last look.

Coffee cup, phone, wallet, and keys; door swings open, the song surges on.

He steps into the morning, already carried by the melody of the day.

Two beats to unlock.

Handle. Door. Engine.

The car hums beneath him; a steady vibration through the wheel, a muted score that accompanies the unfolding morning. 

Outside, the world drifts by in soft impressions: porch lights dimming, streetlights melting into a pale blue haze, and the rhythm of passing buildings, a series of blurred images.


Aaron is elsewhere.

The windshield frames his reality into discrete, predictable sequences. The dashboard glows with quiet authority: temperature settings, fuel readings, and a curated selection of radio signals all ready to command. 

He adjusts the climate, tweaks the volume, and skips a song. Small rituals while the predetermined flow of traffic and routine carries him forward.

Thirty minutes to settle in.
Pull up the numbers, shape them into something convincing.
Shape himself into something convincing.
Revised figures first; concise, controlled.
Anticipate objections. Frame it early.
Three core points: cost, projections, stability.

Carter will push on long-term impact; don‚Äôt follow.
If they dig for cost breakdowns, hold the framing.
No drift, no excess. Stay on pace.


Every so often, his fingers tap a quiet steady rhythm on the wheel, a habitual cadence of impatience and subconscious anxiety. 

A brake light flares.
A sedan ahead crawls five under the limit.

He exhales; calm. It‚Äôs not worth it.
He adjusts his grip, shifts in his seat.

Revised figures first. Set the frame.
Three points. Stability. No excess.
Carter will press. Forget him.
If cost breakdown comes up, control the tempo.
Stay ahead of their questions.

He finds an opening, accelerates past.

A merging SUV. Hesitant.
He tightens his grip on the wheel, scanning for the gap.
A moment of indecision. Brake or push through?

He waves them in. Impatient, restrained.

His shoulders settle, but the rhythm is off now.

Three points. Stay ahead.
Control the tempo.
Cost. Stability. Projections.

The car continues along its predetermined path, a small vessel that carries him forward while enclosing him within a cocoon of climate control and light entertainment. 

The light ahead shifts orange.

Commit.

His foot presses down, smooth, measured. As he clears the intersection, a flash of motion in his periphery, standing on the corner just past the intersection.

A solitary figure. Waving? Or‚Ä¶ signaling? 

A momentary flicker of curiosity, ‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù, but it doesn‚Äôt stick. The thought doesn‚Äôt fade so much as correct itself, overwritten before it can linger. A window washer or just someone waiting to cross the street, he thinks.

His eyes flick to the rearview, but the man is already gone.
Folded back into the blur of the morning.

He exhales, rolling forward, his fingers tapping the wheel.

Revised figures first, set the frame.
Three points. No excess.
Carter will press, don‚Äôt follow.
If cost breakdown comes up- concise, controlled.
Stay ahead of their questions.

His thoughts focused on the day ahead. He arrives at the office lot. 

Ignition. Click. Door.

He steps back into the morning, carried again by the melody of the day.

Colleagues wave. He returns the wave automatically.

As he walks in, the edges began to blur. He feels the warmness of the air, weightless, a soft melody, a held note,
a repeating note.

Tap. Tap.

An Alarm!


Eyes open. Then motion. Sheets slip, feet hit the floor, phone already in hand. The rhythm kicks in.

He‚Äôs up.
Emails flash. Three flagged, nothing unexpected, text from brother. It can wait.

Down the stairs; momentum, cadence, a slight groove moves in.

Click. Hiss. Water on skin. Toothbrush scrapes, sip and spit,
each motion part of the score.

Back to the kitchen. 
The coffee machine exhales, settling into its final drip.

Pour. Stir. Sip. Breathe.

One last look. 

Coffee cup. Phone. Wallet. Keys. The door swings open. The song surges forward.

He steps into the morning, already carried by the melody of the day.

Two beats to unlock.

Handle. Door. Engine.

The car hums beneath him, a steady vibration through the wheel, a muted score that accompanies the unfolding morning. 

Outside, the world slips by in soft smears. Porch lights dim, streetlights fade into pale blue, buildings blur into motion.

 A man walks his dog, briefly caught in the glow before slipping into shadow. 

The overture rises;
the day‚Äôs grand performance begins on cue.
Lights come up, the stage is set, actors take their marks.
Machines and bodies move like clockwork,
timed to signals, synchronized in function.
A production so precise, it needs no director.

Thirty minutes to settle in.
Shape himself into something convincing.
Three core points, frame it early.
Stay on pace, no excess.

Same routine, same mental script.
He‚Äôs ready for Carter and the cost breakdowns.

He adjusts the climate, tweaks the volume, skips a station. The flow of traffic and routine carries him forward.

A brake light flares.
A sedan ahead crawls five under the limit.

He exhales. Calm. Not worth it.

He adjusts his grip, shifts in his seat.

Revised figures first; concise, controlled.
Three core points: projections, cost, stability.
Carter will push; don‚Äôt follow.
Hold the framing. No drift.

He finds an opening, accelerates past.

A series of traffic lights slip past without incident.

He‚Äôs close to the intersection from the day before
when something stirs in the corner of his eye.
A figure on the sidewalk,
arm lifted in a small, repetitive motion.
He can‚Äôt be sure.

The light shifts green, seamlessly.
No time to linger. He presses forward.

He exhales, rolling onward, fingers tapping the wheel.

The thought flickers, ""Was that the same man?‚Äù, but it barely registers, overshadowed by the next turn.

His shoulders settle as the day‚Äôs tasks reel out before him.

Numbers.
Projections.
Three points. Stability. No excess.

His thoughts refocused on the day ahead. He arrives at the office lot. 

Ignition. Click. Door.

Stepping into the morning, he lets the day‚Äôs melody take him again.

Colleagues wave. He returns the wave automatically.

As he walks in, the edges began to blur. Inside, the air is soft, weightless. A single note suspended in time, repeating.

Tap. Tap.

Alarm!

Eyes open, then motion.
Feet hit the floor, phone in hand,
and the routine starts again.

The rhythm kicks in.

He‚Äôs up.
Emails. Three flagged. Another from his brother. It can wait.

Down the stairs; momentum, cadence. A groove settles in.

Click. Hiss. Water over skin. Toothbrush scrapes, sip, spit.
Each motion part of the score.

Back to the kitchen. The coffee machine exhales, settling into its final drip.

Pour. Stir. Sip. Breathe.

One last look.

Coffee cup, phone, wallet, keys.
Door swings open. The song surges forward.

He steps into the morning, already carried by the melody of the day.

Two beats to unlock.

Handle. Door. Engine.

The car hums beneath him, a warm greeting. Adjust climate, tune the radio, volume down.

The morning moves like the space between worlds, almost organic in its directedness and purpose. One car after another, all in line. A signal and move. Another and stop. Always forward and with a practiced agency.

Numbers.
Projections.
Three points. Stability. No excess.

He repeats them like a mantra.
Carter will press if he senses any doubt.

The turn signal ticks in time with his thoughts.
He shifts in his seat, breath steady. But beneath that calm, something simmers.

A bus idles at the curb ahead, brake lights pulsing like a slow heartbeat.

An old man sits hunched beside it, spine curled forward, as if the weight of the world had settled on his back. His gaze fixed on something distant, as if waiting for more than just the next bus.

The car rolls past before he can place what about him feels wrong.

Numbers. Stability. Keep moving.

He approaches the same intersection,
the one from yesterday and the day before.
He can‚Äôt help but look.

This time, he sees the man clearly,
standing on the corner, waving.

Not at anyone in particular.
Just‚Ä¶waving.
An odd, rhythmic motion.
Up, down. Up, down.
Like a beckoning cat.

His curiosity begins to pull his thought, ‚ÄúWho is that?‚Äù
The question doesn‚Äôt fade as quickly this time.
It lingers, circling in his mind.

A reflex says: categorize it,
file it away as meaningless or relevant.
But he can‚Äôt decide.

Why would he act just to act?

The car hums beneath him. The world slides past in practiced motion.

‚ÄúWhy wave? At what?‚Äù

And his face.

Blank.

Not frantic, not pleading. A loop. An insistence.

The man stares ahead but doesn‚Äôt seem to focus on anything.

Expressionless.

As if nothing existed beyond the wave.

More unsettling than the motion itself.

He shifts his grip on the wheel,
but the light turns green before he can register more.

The car moves on, carrying him forward,
the intersection already behind him.

His shoulders tense,
and the day‚Äôs mental script stutters.

Revised figures first, concise, controlled.
Anticipate objections. Frame it early.
No drift. No excess.
Three core points: cost, projections, stability.

He exhales, tries to focus,
but the steady rhythm of the day feels‚Ä¶off.
The thought doesn‚Äôt fade. It loiters. The man‚Äôs blank stare and aimless gesture, like it should mean something but doesn‚Äôt quite.

He arrives at the office lot. 

Ignition. Click. Door.

The morning meets him again, its quiet rhythm already in motion. He steps back in, a little off beat, yet still carried away by the melody of the day.

Colleagues wave. He returns the wave automatically.

As he walks inside,
the air warms around him, weightless;
a soft melody, a held note,
a repeating note.

Tap. Tap.

Alarm!

Eyes open, then motion.
Feet find the floor, phone in hand,
and the routine starts again.

He‚Äôs up.
Emails flash, four flagged. Nothing urgent.
A voicemail from his brother. No immediate reply.

Down the stairs,
the pattern replays, day after day,
yet each time a touch different.

Click. Hiss. Water on skin. Toothbrush scrapes, sip, spit.
His morning ritual humming along, a choreographed rhythm of necessity.

In the kitchen,
the coffee machine exhales,
easing into its final drip.

Pour. Stir. Sip. Breathe.

One last look;
coffee cup, phone, wallet, keys.

Keys?
He just saw them.
Not in the dish. Not on the wall. 

A pause. 

There next to the fridge. 
He shakes it off.

Door swings wide, the melody continues.

Two beats to unlock:

Handle. Door. Engine.

The morning moves as it should:
Streetlights flicker out. The highway breathes, steady. The dashboard hums with quiet certainty.

Except...

Something lags. 

It‚Äôs there, just beneath his morning rhythm, moving out of sync. 

He wonders about the man.

Why stand on a corner, waving at nothing? Or everything? 

Maybe it's mental illness, that would make sense. That would‚Ä¶ explain it.

The thought brings a flicker of relief. A neat diagnosis. A box to place the inexplicable in.

But almost immediately, another thought intrudes; can you imagine that life?

 Every day, the same thing, day in and day out, like a compulsion. 

And then another.

If his ritual is madness, what about mine? The question almost makes him laugh.

He grips the wheel. Eyes forward. The world sliding past in practiced motion.

The Thought Lands Lightly at First.

The wave is absurd, but so is everything, if you look at it long enough.

Isn‚Äôt this what we do? Isn‚Äôt this what life becomes?

One man waves at no one. The other moves through a commute, through meetings, through polite nods and expected answers. His hands gripping the wheel, his voice rehearsing the same conversations day after day.

Routine. Structure. Stability.

Or is it repetition? Script? Compulsion?

The Thought Sinks Deeper.

He grips the wheel tighter. When did he start doing that? How long has he been white-knuckling his way down this road without noticing?

His fingers flex. Release. But the stiffness remains.

Maybe the difference between them is only in degrees.

Maybe there is no difference.

He wakes at the same time every day. Brushes his teeth. Pulls on the same set of clothes, different in detail, identical in function. The coffee goes in the cup. The cup goes in the car. The car goes on the road. The road goes to the office. The office swallows him whole.

Good morning, how are you? Good. How was your weekend? Fine.

Fine. Good. Fine. Good. Fine. Good.

Words exchanged like tokens in a machine. Not because they mean anything, but because they must be said. Because silence is unacceptable. Because he has a role to play, and roles require lines, and lines must be spoken or the whole fragile performance collapses.

His life is a series of dictated movements. A program, running flawlessly. He could be dead right now and no one would notice, so long as his body kept moving through the expected spaces.

The thought begins to fracture.

He watches himself from outside, like a ghost hovering over his own life.

When did this start? Was it always like this?

Maybe it began when he was a child. Wake up, school, home, dinner, bed. Maybe it started when he got the job. Or when he first signed a lease. Or when he first realized that the world does not bend to human longing, only to routine.

Or maybe he was born into it. Maybe it was set before he even arrived. A map, a circuit, a pre-scripted existence that only felt like choice.

He turns the wheel without thinking. The car follows the motion, as it always does. A practiced motion. A gesture.

Like a wave.

The breaklights bleed in front of him, the light ahead shifts red.

First, a pause. 

Then, a full stop.

Now he looks.

Not just a glance. Not a flicker.

The man is there. Not calling out, not reacting, simply doing.

Up. Down. Up. Down.

Like a song played on loop, like a phrase repeated until it loses meaning.

Who is he waving to?

No one.

Or everyone.

Or just himself.

The driver‚Äôs fingers tighten on the wheel.

He should look away.

But something about the man, about the gesture, keeps him locked in place.

Not random.
Not reactive.
Not, normal.

Something else.

The wave means something. It has to.

A thing is either meant or meaningless. Isn‚Äôt it?

Isn‚Äôt it?

And for the first time, the driver really looks at him.

The man stands under the cool morning sun, the pale light catching the crisp, almost stiff fabric of his sky-blue winter coat.

 It looks fresh, untouched by wear, its color stark against the muted tones of the waking world. 

His black hat, ear flaps down, frames a face rough with stubble, the bristles catching in the slanted light.

His jeans are stiff, unfaded. His shoes, uncreased and spotless. No frayed edges, no stains. Not what the driver expected.

If the man had been ragged, hungry, pleading, there‚Äôd be something of sense in it.

But this?

Well-fed. Upright. Strong enough to keep standing, to keep waving.

Someone, somewhere, cares for him.

Someone makes sure his clothes are clean.
Someone makes sure he eats.
Someone makes sure he is okay enough to stand here, to wave, to do this.

There is care here. Perhaps tragic, perhaps beautiful?

Someone loves this strange man.

And just like that, the wave is no longer empty.

It holds a history he will never know, a story he wants to but can‚Äôt piece together.

Why is he here? Who lets him be here? Does anyone try to stop him?

Does anyone come for him at night?
Does someone wait at home?
Does someone else wonder where he goes?

Then suddenly, another thought:

Am I known like that?

If someone loves the waving man, does someone love me in my own routines? 

Or am I as much an oddity to those who pass by me?

Does someone watch my patterns, my motions, and wonder why?

The light turns green.

His car rolls forward.

The man shrinks in the mirror.

The rhythm lingers.

His mind drifts, but the motion follows.

Three points. Stay ahead.
If Carter presses
Cost. Stability. Projections.

His fingers tap the wheel, falling into time.

Up. Down. Up. Down.

The thought doesn‚Äôt fade.

But now, it doesn‚Äôt just linger.

It follows.

He arrives at the office lot,
where colleagues wave.
Colleagues wave. He mirrors them, but his hand feels distant, a separate thing.

As he walked in, a warmth in the air; soft, weightless, like something dissolving.

A melody, faint but rising.

A held note.

A repeating note.

Tap. Tap.

Eyes open.

No alarm, no thought; just motion.

Sheets slip, feet press the floor. A few beats, then a body already moving before the mind catches up.

Down the stairs, momentum, gravity. The groove settles in.

Click. The aroma of coffee already in the air. 
Hiss. Water rolls over his skin, pooling at his collarbone, slipping down his spine. 
The toothbrush scrapes its rhythmic churn, water washing out what‚Äôs left of the morning.

Pour. Stir. Sip. Breathe.
Breathe again.

Everything is in place. Every gesture intact. A structure so seamless it does not require will.

But today, something drags; a ripple beneath the surface.

Not the wave. Not yet.

Something else.

His brother‚Äôs voicemail still sits unanswered. He hasn‚Äôt opened it. Doesn‚Äôt need to. He already knows.

Memory hovers: his father in bed, staring at a dimly lit TV, eyes empty, one hand gripping an arm that‚Äôs too stiff to move on its own now.

Dementia, the doctors said.

The man who raised him, now repeating the same stories, the same questions.
Loops.

Mind and body, worn down like used tools.

Yesterday, his father asked about a dog they never had.

Then again. Same question. Same inflection. And again. No memory of the last time he asked. No sense of repetition.

Each time, a new moment. Real. Immediate. Entirely his own.

His brother wants him to visit. ""Just go along with it,"" he wrote last time. ""Just say yes to whatever he remembers.""

But something about that feels obscene, a false world, a hollow performance. 

He wants to scorn the disease that holds his father hostage.
That locks him inside some lonely darkness. Just go along with it. 

And yet, what else is there? What else can be done?
He‚Äôll go this weekend.

One last look,
coffee cup, phone, wallet, keys.
Door swings wide, the melody continues.

Two beats to unlock:

A pause

Handle. Door. Engine.

The highway hums beneath him. The morning moves as it should.
And yet-
thought pulls differently today:
The wave; absurd yet necessary, meaningless yet vital. 

A function, a ritual. A thing to do.

His father. The waving man. Himself. Each caught in something.

One repeats a question. One repeats a wave. One repeats a life. The difference? Only in degrees.

The intersection nears.
The man is there. 

Up. Down. Up. Down.

A part of him wants to look away; keep moving, keep structure intact. 

But today, the gesture is no longer strange. It is familiar. Maybe even inevitable.

He slows. The light is still green, but he slows.

If he responds to the wave, will that create meaning? Does he become a witness and in that witnessing, create something? 

And, before he fully realizes what he‚Äôs doing, he raises his hand. 

A small movement, barely displaced in the air. 

Not a wave, not exactly. But something close.

In that moment, something sharpens. Something clears. 

The distance collapses.
Two figures on opposite sides of the glass, moving within loops they do not fully choose, fulfilling gestures they cannot name.  Waiting maybe, for someone to acknowledge that they see, that they know, that they, too, are seen.
He holds the gesture a fraction too long. And then...

Nothing. No reaction. No shift. No break in the rhythm.

Up. Down. Up. Down.

The man does not acknowledge him.
And yet, it is enough.

Because now, he knows: he is no different.
The wave was always his.
The wave had always belonged to him. He just couldn't see it.

As the car moves forward, as the moment slips into the mirror, he feels it; not an answer, not an understanding, but an acceptance.

The loop continues.

But this time, he is inside it.

This time, it belongs to him.

A breath, a settling.

His thoughts gather, drawn forward, refocusing on the day ahead.

The office lot appears as it always does; unchanged, waiting.

He pulls in.

Engine off. Handle. Door.

He steps back into the morning, carried again by the melody of the day.

Colleagues wave. He returns the wave automatically.

As he walks in, the edges begin to blur.
He feels the warmth of the air, weightless, a soft melody, a held note,
a repeating note.

Tap. Tap.

Alarm!

The edges blur, warmth of the air, weightless, the melody fades 
a repeating note.

Tap. Tap.

Alarm!

Do you remember that dog we used to have?

Tap. Tap.

He was hesitant at first but finally broke down and admitted he was happy to get some of it off his chest)*

. . .. Where did we cap off last time? Oh right, John The schmuck.

Yea they never found that poor bastard, Old Man Maroni was beside himself with grief. He always thought John had been taken out by a rival of his from across the river, course he could never prove it. That didn't stop him though, he was on a warpath, itching for blood.

Truth be told I think he was just glad for the excuse.

One day he pulls me aside and he says ""Frank, I need you to drive some friends of ours uptown, they need to make a payment up there.""

This would be the first hit I would ever be a part of, officially anyway- I don't count the carpet debacle as anything but. Was I nervous? Hell yeah.

Riding with me was Ricky Toro and Dex Finnegan. Ricky was made young, a somewhat controversial topic actually, and he had brought his childhood buddy to the top with him. Ricky was a top earner, some scheme or scam always rolling around in that thick skull of his. With that pale mutt Dex on his side, he could back up any swindle and come out on top. His big money maker was fixing fights, so it was a shock when I found out he had volunteered for the hit.

My guess is he was tired of the whispers, how he had never really stepped up for the family, yet they opened the books for him. I could see him in the rearview, on the surface he looked calm and collected. But the fidgety knee going a mile a minute told a different story. Dex though, pfft he seemed bored with it. I didn't know a lot about the guy-kept to himself only really hung around Ricky and his crew. He was a tall golem with a mop of fiery red on his head, I know that much.

The mood before we crossed the river was jovial, like soldiers given their first marching orders. It was weird, the second we hit Manhattan you could feel the mood wither and die. It was real all of a sudden. My old man had pulled me aside before we left. There was a hint of pride hidden behind that stoney face. He tucked something away in my coat, ignoring my protest. ""Just in case."" he kept saying. He was a careful man, Vincenzo. I'll always grant him that.

Finally, we pulled up to our target. It was quiet, though not unusually so. It was Sunday after all, and most of the neighborhood were a few blocks away paying their dues. The barbershop had tinted windows, but we could peer in and see the shadows of the unsuspecting mooks inside. We could make out at least six or seven human shaped blobs bobbing around in there, the biggest sitting down; getting attended to by a slim shadow with slicked back hair.

Now I don't know about Ricky and his bloodhound, but I pretty much shat a brick when I saw that oval shaped bastard sitting in there. Old man Maroni had scuffed the intel a little, inside wasn't just Carrisi's right hand, but Benito Carrisi himself.

I realize all these names are lost on you Franky, way before your time. I sound like a cranky old mule when I say, ""back in my day,"" but, well back in my day The Carrisi crew were the biggest scumbags across the river. They owned their little patch of land and fought tooth and nail to preserve it.¬† Benito was a miserable fat bastard, his gut spilling out of his button down. His breath reeked of week-old tuna and when he smiled you could see the toll years of decay had taken on his snaggled and jagged teeth. He was a vindictive son of a bitch, and he wasn't supposed to be there that day, or so we were told. We sat in fearful silence for a moment, each man weighing their options. Finally, Ricky pulled out glock-90 and slapped Dex on the back.

""Let's teach these pricks a lesson they'll never forget. Franky: I don't care if God comes by you do not move this car till, we come back."" His accent was heavy and hardened, determined to prove himself to the family. Dex nodded his head at me, saying nothing as he headed out. I kept the engine running, my foot nervously tapping the gas. I reach to my jacket pocket, reassuring myself it wouldn't be needed. I watched as Dex and Ricky positioned themselves, an unspoken maneuver between the duo. Ricky leered in front of the window; pump action firmly planted in his hands. Ricky readied himself by the door out of sight.

The denizens inside completely unaware of the carnage about to unfold. There was a nod between them, and Ricky pushed open the glass door. Heads turned as the overheard bell rang out, and before they knew it the tinted windows exploded inward, raining down shrapnel and buckshot. Ricky stayed halfway by the door, spraying and praying as he blasted inside. I could see the look on his face as he could barely hold onto his Glock, wild eyed and cold at the same time.

The Carrisi crew went down, and they went down hard. I could see Benito crawling on the floor over to one of his fallen men. He was wearing a blood-stained track coat and blue overalls. Three of his men had gone down in the first volley, two more blindly returning fire from behind makeshift cover. Shards of glass-stained blood littered the inside as shell casings dropped to the ceramic floor of the shop. I kept my head down at first, not trying to catch a stray.

I heard Dex cry out and stagger back, catching one in the shoulder. Ricky saw this and swore out, hitting the attacker dead in the head. I saw it all from the Vega, the first time I had ever saw a man die. His head snapped back on impact, blood spattering against the wall. He collapsed in a heap onto the ground like a pile of dirty laundry. It was instant, like someone had just flipped his switch and he was gone- *Senior snaps his fingers*\- Like that.

Dex retreated to the Vega wincing as he studied his wound. Wasn't bad, but I could tell it hurt like hell. Ricky ran back to the car, providing covering fire. Which was really just him shooting up the storefront. He hit everything but the final man and Benito, who was getting up and staring us down from the inside. I could see that snaggle toothed puss snarling at us like a rabid animal. He grabbed a pair of scissors from the ground and hurled it at Ricky. It soared through the air, I swear to Christ Franky, and it hit Ricky right in the chest. He cried out and dropped his gun, clenching himself.

Benito charged out the door with a roar, grabbing him by the collar and slamming him onto the hood of the Vega, the whole care shook and groaned as Benito began pummeling him with his fists. I sprang into action, getting out the revolver my old man had tucked away from me. I felt like Dirty Harry waving that thing around. The final shooter inside took aim at me, and by sheer luck he missed. I took aim at the kid and fired away, the gun nearly jumping out of my hand; the recoil punishing me instantly.

I must have hit him, because he cried out in agony, and disappeared from view. Now it was just me and the ogre beating Ricky to death. I jumped out the car, adrenaline pumping through my veins like steroids, and aimed down on the hulking mass. Benito was so focused, tearing away at Poor Ricky's face. Ricky's face had already ballooned up into fracturing lumps of bruises and welts, like he was a pile of red clay Benito was working tirelessly to reform and disfigure.

""You dumb fucks come here, I'll have your whole family strung up and skinned for this!"" Benito raved at the top of his lungs. ""I'll send you back to Maroni in pieces, I'll march down to Jersey and raze the whole fucking state down!"" I don't know if he was talking to me, Ricky, or God; but he was too far gone in his lunacy to notice me. So, I unloaded on him, five shots right into his side. Smoke poured out of every hole and for a moment he seemed to tank every shot. He stopped in his assault, breathing ragged and choked. He slumped down onto the ground, fists clenched to his side. He took one look at me as he dragged himself across the pavement, eyes burning with hatred.

My eyes flicked to Ricky, barely conscious on the human shaped dent on the hood. He was wheezing and coughing up some crimson fluid, so I slumped him over my shoulder and threw him in next to Dex, still struggling with his shoulder, blood still flowing no matter how much pressure he applied. I scrambled to the driver's seat, sirens starting to wail in the air towards this massacre. I peeled out, burning rubber as I left Benito to bleed out on the sidewalk, hoping to cross the river before the streets flooded with cops.¬†

*-Senior takes a long pause and a swig from his drink. I was too stunned to speak at first. I stuttered at first, struggling to find the words-*

*(I thought you were just a driver)*

I was. At first. Overtime that role grew, and before I knew it, I was running my own little crew. It all changed that day, that first hit. I managed to give the cops the slip and head back into friendly waters. Got Ricky some help as soon as I could, dumped the poor prick in front of an urgent care and reported back to Old Man Maroni with Dex.

He was pretty pleased with himself, Benito's favorite hangout in shambles and five of his men dead. Total embarrassment and he just had to sit there and take it-

*(back up, I thought he was dead?)*

Benito? Nah all that blubber, it was like perfect insulation to take five slugs in the side. His boys whisked him off before the cops came, got him patched up. Dex came out of it with a pain in his arm every time he moved it, but Ricky? He had to have major reconstructive surgery. He came out with a scarred-up face and an eye welded shut. And he wore that mug like a badge of honor. No one said shit behind his back anymore, and he nicknamed himself ""Prince Charming"" some kind of ironic joke, I'm sure.

For my part in it I was praised for keeping a cool head and getting them back safe. I returned the revolver to my father without a word, and he never mentioned how it was empty. He simply patted me on the back and said to 'keep up the good work."" I didn't respond. It was finally hitting me what had gone down that day. How there were five confirmed dead-at least one of those souls following me to this day.¬†

I would later find out my old man ""knew"" what would happen. It was why he gave me the piece. The night before he had gone to his longtime *comare*, a learned woman from the old country. Her name was Anastasia, and she claimed to know things before they transpired. Call it tarot, call it black magic, call it whatever you wanted. The truth of the matter was this Raven curled beauty had my father coiled around her finger, she would whisper prophecy in his ears and bed and my father would bark orders on her whim.¬†

*(You believe stuff like that?) - I laughed but Senior got a dead serios look on his face-*

Let me tell you Franky I saw some strange shit over the years. My old man was a believer for sure, but Paulie was REALLY superstitious. One time I'm driving him on a collection run; we stop in front of the grocery store. Nice sunny day, heat bearing down on us like nobody's business. Paulie was wearing a wife beater, I only bring that up because he looked ridiculous in it, just absolutely drenched in sweat.

Supposed to be the last stop of the day, he barely gets out and takes a long look at the roof-then he climbs back in, tells me to drive on. I ask him what the fuck, because this place was already short two weeks in a row. Paulie points up to the roof, and perched on it was a black crow. Largest bird I had ever seen, just basking in the heat. It was looking down at us, the Vega must have looked like a giant ruby to it. I go

""So what, a frigging bird."" Which earns me one of Paulie's patented smacks across the head.

""Don't be fresh. Them things are harbingers. We'll come another day."" he said firmly. Well, I knew better than not to argue so on we went. Not five minutes later we see to patrol cars barreling down past us. Turns out the joint was being robbed.

He never left his brownstone on the 13^(th)¬†of any month; he carried salt in his back pocket to throw past him if he walked by a graveyard. He skeeved black cats and birds, went to Church every Sunday, 8am on the dot. I don't know if he was simply OCD or what. I tell you this much, he never balked at an order he knew came from the mouth of the prophet.

There was this one time, I was hanging with my buddy Carlo down at Cindy's. Cindy's was a bit of a dive, but it was our dive. Sid, the pony-haired blonde who tended the bar was eyeing me from across the bar, a saucy look to her emerald eyes. Carlo was egging me on, until Paulie emerged behind me from the back, a cockblocking ape who reeked of cigars. He clasped me on the back, robbing me of my breath and suave attitude.¬†

""Come on Romeo. We gotta take a ride."" I heard him speak low enough just for the two of us. Carlo snickered and took a swig, drawing the wrath of Paulie. ""You too Mercutio.""¬†¬†

We drove with the windows down that night, the springtime Jersey air doing wonders for our lungs. Paulie explained on the way, one of Vinchenzo's ""accountants"" had up and vanished. Been about two weeks since he last kicked up, and the wall was starting to crack a little. His *comare* had told him ""Lawrence has been communing with someone he should not."" The old man took that to mean he was collaborating, though that didn't explain the disappearing act. It was pitch black when we arrived at the little slice of suburbia that Larry called home. Even in the evening the scent of freshly cut grass wafted in the air. In the distance a dog barked to the cheering applause of crickets. The lights were all on, an oddly unsettling sight this time of night. We jogged up the drive, eyes darting back and forth like we were bandits in the night.

Which hey I guess we were hahaha.

We went around back, porch light buzzing above us. Paulie had his piece drawn, and I was carrying as well. Carlo liked to carry around this butterfly knife he found in a Chinatown back lot. He claimed he could do all sorts of tricks with it, but I never saw him try it. But I digress.

For some reason, none of us thought it prudent just to knock on the door or even call out to Larry. I had this gut feeling we shouldn't be there, and I could tell by the strained look in Paulie's eyes he thought the same.

Finally, Carlo said, ""Fuck it."" and leapt towards the back door, pounding on it like a madman in heat. ""Larry boy open up, we're friends of the old man."" He called out to nothing and was met with such. The dead silence from inside was starting to get unnerving; Paulie was giving me the ""We should get the fuck outta here."" side-eye.¬†

Carlo knocked on the door once more, only for it to slowly swing open-a light breeze chilling the air in front of us. The door swung open, the naked back hall beckoning us. It was at this time I took my piece out as well; Paulie had put his hands in the air and started to walk back up the drive.

""You gonna tell the old man you walked away?"" I shouted at him. Paulie paused in his tracks.¬†

""Sunnova bitch."" he grumbled, shoulder checking me as he entered the dragon. He turned back and saw us gawking at him, a hint of the devil on Carlo's and I's face. ""Come on you cocksuckas lets go."" He bellowed, and we scurried behind him like rats leaving a sinking ship.

Larry's home was. . . I guess cozy was the way to put it. There was a lingering smell of rot wafting in from the kitchen, but other than that it was homely. The walls were adorned with old family photos, glimpses into past of our missing comrade. There was a decent sized cube of a tv sitting in the corner, through the frayed and grainy image I think I could make out replays of last week's Giants game. A leather-bound recliner sat upright in front of it. Next to it a dinner tray with a warm beer on it. I took a whiff and gagged, smelled like dried out skunk piss.¬†

""Ooh, come here a second."" I heard Carlo holler from the kitchen. I was met with both him and Paulie standing around a dining room table. It was filled with rotting food, flies buzzing around set plates with half eaten homemade cooking that devolved into colorful slop.¬† It stunk to high heaven, Paulie was stepping back with his shoulder to his face to keep from dry heaving. Carlo was leaning over it all, hand rubbing his chin like he was goddamn Sherlock Holmes. Finally, he came next to me to share his observations. ""I think whoever was here left in a hurry."" He mused out loud.

I swear to you Paulie rose in the air and flew over just to smack him in the back of the head because I blinked and suddenly Carlo was going ""ouch"" and rubbing his scalp.¬†

""Fucking *stunad*."" Paulie grumbled, a hint of dry vomit on his breath.

¬†""Three plates out, he must had company. He had no wife or kids.""¬† I countered. Paulie begrudged me that one.

""Wife died giving birth a few years back, kid only lasted a couple hours after that. Breach. Tragic shit."" He pondered aloud. There was a hint of empathy in his voice, but only enough to give the illusion of caring. There was a cup of sour milk at the head of the table, looked like aged tapioca. Carlo leaned over and sniffed it, again thinking he was some great detective. Ignoring him I turned to Paulie, who was deep in pondering.

""This has gotta be retaliation for sumthing right?"" I whispered harshly to him, my mind flashing back to the carpet fiasco. Paulie shook his head.

""Larry wasn't heavy with anyone, well liked, kept to himself. Even if it was a message, we would have received it by now,"" He remarked under his breath. Carlo came up behind me, probably about to say something that would make Paulie throttle him when we heard it.

*thump.*

The three of us looked up at the ceiling in unison, like it was some macabre stooges' bit. I thought it was a one off at first, the wind had knocked over a vase or something. That was when we heard the pitter-patter of feet scuttling around up there, sounded like a wild animal was crawling around.

Paulie held his gun like a security blanket as he gave the ceiling a death glare. Carlo was cautiously making his way to the stairs. The only sound was the fuzz of the ancient tv playing as we tiptoed through the living room. I peeked up the stairs, a soft thumping noise echoing down them. It was like it was taunting us, daring us to come and see. Carlo looked past me, a cocky look on his face. He had brought his knife out; he looked like a greaser displaced in time. He brushed past me, planting himself on the first step.

""Larry is that you up there?"" He called up, his voice booming in the small case. Paulie pushed him, steam powering out of every orifice on his head.

""Are your parents fifth generation inbreds? Ya ever hear of the element of surprise?"" Paulie growled.

""Oh, like they didn't hear us stomping in here,"" Carlo complained, brushing Paulie's hands off him. ""Your fat ass couldn't sneak up on a deaf nun."" I got in between them before they tore into each other, putting a finger to my lips and giving them both the death glare. They put aside their idiocy for a moment, coming together to find whatever was stalking the second floor. We crept up¬†weapons drawn, our senses sharp as daggers.

There was a rank smell up there, different then the rot. This was a-a musk of some kind. Strong and willful, the rancid stench of a sulfur miner coming off a twenty-hour shift. We put up our noises at it and studied the upstairs. Two halls, a crossroad in the middle leading further. To the right a bathroom, nothing special. To the left an old bedroom, set up like some kind of nursery. My heart ached seeing that, Larry boy never got over it.

Down the middle the stench grew stronger, drawing us in. Naturally we followed the smell, unsure of what we would find at the end. Two doors on either side, window smack dab in the middle. Both doors were closed, but we could hear movement, loud and scattered. It was impossible to tell what room held our mystery. Paulie flicked me in the chest with the butt of his gun.¬†

""I'll go right, you and shark bait over there take left."" He commanded in a hushed voice. Carlo was about to pipe up, but I jabbed him with my shoulder, following Paulie's lead. I put my ear to the door on the left, and I swear I heard hushed whispers. I couldn't make out what they were saying, but the voice sounded like it was gargling rocks and spite. I gave Carlo the nod and we burst through the door, and I aimed my piece at-

Nothing.

The room was empty. We were met with an unkempt queen size bed and a hardwood floor filled with dirty laundry. A couple pictures hung on the wall Esque, like the room had been met with a localized Earthquake. We went in on high alert, still not sure if we were alone. Carlo went over the closet and tore it open, jabbing his knife in and out like a nutjob. After he was done stabbing Larry's nice suits he gave me a shrug. That was when I noticed Paulie was being awfully quiet.

I looked over to see him clutching the doorway with one hand, repeatedly making the sign of the cross with the other. His face was crunched up and contorted in horror, like he had seen the gates of hell open up personally. He was muttering something under his breath, but I couldn't make it out. My guess it was some variation of the ""Hail Mary"" with his own personal flavor added in.

I approached slowly, touching his shoulder. As soon as my hand touched him, he twirled around and shoved his gun in my face. I didn't even blink at first, but I think I did piss myself a tad. He lowered it almost instantly, a look of fear glazing over him, his breath shaky and pained.¬†

""Franky-"" He choked out, ""-we need to get the fuck out of here, right now."" He sounded horrified. He pointed to the room and then booked it down the hall, not even waiting for us. Carlo joined me at the threshold, and we peered in. It was Larry's study, his desk overturned and crammed against the lime green walls. Papers littered the walls and floor, scribbled with some unknown language or simply Larry's sloppy handwriting. Engraved-carved in fact- in the middle of the floor was a circle adorned with strange symbols. In the middle of the circle was a nine-pointed star-and a barrier of salt surrounding the whole thing. Melted candles were glued to the points, the remnants of some god forsaken ritual Larry had done.

The air inside that room felt wrong, a chilling breeze greeted us from nowhere, the hairs on the back of my neck flashing warning signs. I couldn't help but notice the salt-line on the carving was broken, salt bursting outward and glistening on the floor. I almost socked Carlor in the jaw, he startled me so badly whispering right in my ear.

""Jesus, Mary and Joseph,"" He muttered next to me. ""Kinda sick shit was this guy into.""¬† Before I could reply we heard a thunderous crash from downstairs followed by Paulie screeching ""MUTHA OF FUCKING CHRIST!"" and the blast of his pistol. We raced downstairs, calling out for Paulie. We were halfway when we saw Paulie standing in the middle of the living room, panting and waving his gun wildly. A shattered chair lay next to him. He saw us standing there like idiots, his eyes wide and crazed. He pointed his gun at the kitchen as he yelled his explanation.

""They threw a fucking chair at me; it laughed and said my name and everything."" He rambled. We approached him with open arms, but come on huh? I was gonna try and calm him down when a plate whizzed past my head and shattered into pieces. The rotted slop it had held fell to the shag carpet. I faced the kitchen, seeing nothing there but a now half empty table. There was a gurgling sound, a sort of dark clucking, like whatever had done it was mocking us. Well Paulie had enough of that and raced out the backdoor with us nipping at his heel.

He covered us as we ran out the back, though I don't know what he would have done. We caught our breath in the drive, hearts racing a mile a minute. Paulie was keeping busy; he rummaged around back and eventually came out with a half empty gas canister and a dirty rag. He forced it in our hands, ordered us to stuff it and light it. He searched his pockets and came out with a metal lighter. I dumped a little gas on the house as Carlo doused and lit the rag.

Before long flames were quickly devouring the back porch and we were retreating back to the car. Paulie was already there, watching the place quickly become engulfed in flames. The heat was intense; we could feel it all the way from the end of the street. The house made a groaning sound like a wounded deer. Least I hope it was the house.

From the street we could see the upstairs window, and I swear to you junior I saw a figure standing there, highlighted by the raging fire. A dark shadow with eyes like dancing embers. I knew it wasn't my mind playing tricks because I could feel the thing reaching out to me, trying to tell me something. What it wanted, I couldn't tell you. It just felt like evil clawing at my mind. None of us said a word on the drive back. Paulie didn't leave his house for two weeks after that, when I finally did coax him out, he looked so shaken and dopey eyed, like he hadn't slept since that night.

Eventually he reverted back to his old jovial self, but he refused to comment on that night. Carlo and I just stuffed it all to the back of our minds, making jokes about that haunted house we saw one time. The implications of it all never really hit us, I didn't want it to. The fire ended up reducing the house to cinders, taking any evidence of Larry and his whereabouts with it.

My father was furious when he heard what happened, ""How do you screw up a simple welfare check huh?!? If I send you idiots to pick up a pie, ya gonna shoot poor old Luigi and rob him!?!"" He screamed at us from his office. Me and Carlo just stood there, embarrassed to even explain what we had seen. Anastasia stood by my father's side, her mystic emeralds studying us. She wore this flowing crimson dress, I think they were going to some party after my father was done chewing us out.¬†

She leaned down as he was catching a breath, whispering something secret only for him. My father had a strange look then, like he had been caught with his hand in the cookie jar. He faced away from us, a deep sigh rumbling from him as Anastasia curled around his shoulders.

""You boys had a rough night, nothing we could do for Larry in the end, I suppose you did what ya thought was best. Get outta here, give Paulie my regards."" and that was the end of that. I never did find out what Ana had said to him, but I suppose that's none of my business.

*-Senior takes a long pause, not even drinking. I cough to regain his attention, and he eyes me, sorrow creeping on his face. -*

I remember the first time I met Ana. Vinchenzo and ma had an unspoken agreement; he would never bring business home-and she would turn a blind eye to flaunting his girlfriend. He would take her to lavish parties, He would bury her in jewelry and romance, while doing the bare minimum for ma, the sweetest woman in the world.

I began to resent all of them frankly, him for doing it and her for letting it happen. It had been a few weeks of collection pickups; I had just gotten the Vega actually. The old man thought it was gawdy but fuck em, he wasn't slugging around town for his cronies. One night he tells me I'm going to drive him to dinner. My heart drops, it's Saturday night, HER night.

In front of ma, he tells me this, like he's enjoying twisting the knife. I swallow my pride and go ""Sure pop, whatever you say."" He has me dressed in a nice suit, he's in this old-time black and white two piece, it's like he stepped right out of a photo with Capone haha.

He sits in the back and tells me the address. He's silent pretty much the whole time, save for one moment when he tells me to ""Slow down, this ain't the Kentucky derby."" I pocket that comment to bitch about later and pull up in front of Anastasia's place.

It's an apartment building, old by the looks of it. There's a goofy looking ad by the door for ""Madame Ana"" with a picture of a gypsy caressing a crystal ball. Corny shit, and since the old man was ancient even then, I expected some dolled-up call-girl with a hiked-up dress and a faux turban to stroll out of that building.

Imagine the donkey-faced look I had when out strolled Helen of Troy. She couldn't have been much older than me, late 20s, early 30s. She wore a long, flowing blouse that left little to imagine. My father flicked the back of my neck, gesturing to open the door for her. I scrambled to open the passenger door for her, and her hand touched mine as Aphrodite slide next to the prune.

She flashed me a smile, her eyes locked onto mine as she did. I thought nothing of it at the time. I tried to focus the road as I drove them to Bella's; this gourmet place the old man was in the middle of busting out, as they cozied-up in the back seat. It was revolting to even think about, much less sit three inches away from. Finally, we made it to the joint, if you've seen one Italian joint you've seen them all, and I got out to open the door for them. Vinchenzo¬†patted me on the back as he passed, barely looking me in the eye as he whispered, ""Drive round the block for an hour or so,"" Ana raised her eyebrows, pouting as she replied,

""I had hoped the young gentleman could accompany us tonight."" Her accent was thick, like she had just stepped right off the boat. Vinchenzo looked at me, grinding his teeth and already regretting dragging me along.¬†

""Sounds like a nice time."" The inside was crawling with the who's who of Jersey scumbags that night. We were tucked away in a private booth, but every few minutes it seemed some half-drunk goombah was coming back to pay their respects. There was Paulie of course, he never missed an opportunity to grovel. There was Old Man Maroni, held up by two cronies forcing a smile as their boss babbled like a drunken idiot. Prince Charming was there, pre-face lift of course. There was Nicky Valant, few guys from New York; Benny Barino, Louie Stacks, even the Irish from across the bay were coming over to kiss his ass, and my father fucking hated the micks.

He would make a big show of showing Ana off like she was a cut of prized veal or something. Made my stomach churn, and from the look in her emeralds she felt the same. Eventually things settled down and we put in our orders. Ana leaned in eager to learn all about me. How was I liking my new gig, what'd I study, what was ""Vinny"" like growing up? I swore I saw him blush at that question. I tried to be polite and answer honestly:

""It can be a drag but good money- English Lit till I dropped out- And Vinny has always been the same *miserabe* he's always been right pop?"" I flashed him a grin at that and was meet with all the sense of humor dead fish could muster. Ana laughed though, a giggling bray that could crack any wall.¬†

""Vinny has told me so much about you, he's glad you've finally shown an interest in the business."" Dad shot her a look but said nothing.¬†

""I wouldn't go that far, just been driving some friends around really."" I sheepishly replied, little red showing up on my face. Ana scoffed playfully, waving her hand in a mock fashion.

""*Mio Dio*, handsome and modest, such a winning combination."" I blushed and cleared my throat, trying to change the subject.

""So, tell me ""Madame Ana."" you really got a crystal ball."" I cracked

.""Hey, watch ya remarks Franky boy."" ""Vinny"" warned, though that was met with a horse laugh by Ana.

""So quick to anger my beloved, you should watch that temper, lest it watch you."" She warned.¬† Her eyes flicked to me ""You Americans love your assumptions about my trade, so I play into them-just a tad."" Pfft, now who was being modest.

""Us Americans? You hearing this pop?"" I feigned outrage. Vinny shook his head, like he'd heard that line a 100 times before

""*Madone* don't get her started, she'll go on for hours."" He lamented. I saw a fire blaze in Ana's eyes; she clucked her tongue and snapped her head back.

""You boys- you play the *soldatino* when you've never felt the boot of Rome on your neck."" She scoffed. Vinny took a swig of his white wine and chuckled darkly.

""I didn't mean to offend."" I offered ""Just never met a-uh, eh fuck it mystic before."" I tell you junior you could have cooked an egg on my forehead I was so red hahaha.¬†

""My mother taught me much-but she envied the sight I was blessed with."" There was a hint of sorrow in her voice. ""I had to leave quite suddenly. It was-luck I suppose I met your father so soon."" She placed a hand on his thigh and flashed a smile.

Our food soon arrived, carried by a plucky waiter with an obvious combover. He laid down a plate of shrimp scampi for my father- a stake for me and chicken parm with noodles for the lady. It smelled divine, cooked to perfection. I heard Ana say ""*Grazie.*"" to the waiter as he walked away as Vinny licked his lips.

Ana dug in immediately, stacking her fork in a mound of pasta, twirling a big chunk and gulping it down in one bite. A touch of sauce dribbled down her chin as she moaning, savoring every single morsel. Vinny was about to take a bite as well when Ana suddenly pointed at him, wagging her finger like he was a schoolboy.¬†

*""No, √® avvelenato.""* she said, muffled as she chewed her food. Vinny scrunched his face, not understanding a word of what she had just said.

""Don't talk with ya mouth full-"" He began.

""Do not eat that-it's *veleno*. Poison."" She said that last part slowly, sounding each syllable out like she had just learned the word I chewed the fat piece of meat I had rolling around in my mouth as my father turned as white and cotton as his bedsheets. The old man was trying to compose himself, eyes darting around the smashed room as the snakes he called friends partied on.¬†

""Who-who would have the fucking gall, here of all fucking places."" He sputtered in a ushed voice.

¬†""The short one-Nicky something with the toupee."" Ana replied so casually, eating like nothing was happening. I was stunned by this bold admission, but I sure as shit wasn't gonna take a bite of the scampi to find out for myself. ""He's upset you passed him over for the pretty boy.""

""Wh- Ricky? Kid's a top fucking earner-four times what Nicky brings in."" Vinny grumbled. Ana simply shrugged, continuing to enjoy her meal.¬†

""Eat then, what do I care-keel over and vomit out your ass in this nice place."" She said with venom. Vinny stewed and mulled his options. Finally, he quietly excused himself, waving over Paulie with a snap of his fingers. He whispered something in his ear, and I saw bloodlust overtake Paulie, as he snapped his focus to Nicky's table. He was lost in the sauce now, two girls on his arms as he told some foul joke. Two men I hadn't seen before appeared behind him, grabbing him and quickly escorting him to the back. A gaggle of wise guys followed suit, assuring the other patrons that nothing was wrong and to go about their business.

There was a mummer of discontent but ultimately no one cared as they dragged the protesting little guy away. I was alone with Ana now, twiddling away embarrassed at the sudden show of force and in awe of the sway she seemed to have over Vinny.¬†

""You saved his life."" I finally admitted breaking the tension. ""How'd you know?"" I squinted at her like an idiot heh. She dismissed me with a wave of her hand.

""Pfft, please huh? Lil Nicky will not be the one to topple the wall."" She squared her face at me. ""You have so much hatred for that man.""¬†

""That's my father you're talking about."" I said in a lower voice.

""He flaunts his adultery to your face, how could you not. A sick wife at home and he galivants with a younger woman. I am no saint Franklin, but he should know better."" she grimaced.

¬†""Well, you aren't exactly blameless in that."" I spat, and I regrated that instantly- to this day I don't know why.¬†

""You think me a whore? I am-disappointed but not surprised. Your father is boastful, but he does not act."" She gave me a lingering look to think that one over. The look on my face must have looked like a toddler trying to figure out how two and two make five-because she let out a low giggle, clearly enjoying my befuddlement.

""So... If he aint-""

""He wants to. But he covets my sight more. I've been his paramour for-two years now. You've seen his rise."" She lingered on that last thought.  I had always wondered what his edge was-and now she was smirking at me from across the table.¬†

""And I always thought he was some tactical genius."" I murmured to myself.

""Is it not-ah- Tac-tic-al- to use every advantage you have against the wolves at your door?"" She countered. I didn't answer.¬† She narrowed her eyes at me. ""You are-how they say- ""Not the fastest horse in the race"" yes?"" She laughed playfully. I cracked a smile at that.

""Good thing I'm handsome then huh?"" I rose my glass in a toast. Ana met it with her own glass and the clink rang out. We chatted a little longer about her life in the old country until Vinny reappeared with the rough clearing of his throat. He was standing by Ana's side awkwardly-his knuckles course and bloody. His cuffs were caked in red, but he didn't seem to care.¬†

""We should get going here. They found a rat in the kitchen, need to clean it up a bit."" He lied. As we were leaving- Without paying mind you- I couldn't help but notice some of Pop's goons escorting patrons out. Must have been one hell of a rat in the back huh hehe.

Ride back to Ana's was quite- drove with the windows down and just let that cool breeze wash over me. When we got back Ana leaned into the driver's seat and wrapped her arms around me. She smelt like lavender. She told me it was wonderful meting me and hoped we could see each other again. I couldn't see Vinny's face when she did that, but I can imagine the seething it might have held.

He walked her back to the door, holding her by the waist. He leaned into her ear, whispering something. Ana blushed but pushed him back, shaking her head no. Dad gave her a peck on the cheek good night, and gave me one last glance before disappearing inside. Dad slammed the passenger side when he came back-clearly disgruntled.

He didn't have to say shit- I started the car back up and sped off. He huffed and puffed back there, finally catching me staring at him. he forced some good cheer on his face as he leaned back.

¬†""Heh, she's something ain't she Franky? Would have told ya to get lost so we could uh-get some coffee but, well I guess she needs a break. I wear her out something fierce."" He proclaimed boldly. I held my tongue, and the old man seemed satisfied at that. ""She seemed to take a liking to you."" He spoke. Again, he was met with silence. "" Nah that's good, she's good people. Just uh-don't forget who she was friends with first.""

He didn't say anything for the rest of ride-didn't need to. Motherfucker.

*(I stopped the recording here. He was flustered and needed a break. Frankly I did as well, I had no idea how big of an impact the life really had on him. I also had no idea he believed in so much hocus pocus crap, I'll have to drill him for more on that. I did notice something though, when Senior was talking about that Ana woman. It was his eyes.

I'm currently in Granada and would love to find a friendly face to explore this beautiful city with. I speak English fluently and know a little bit of Spanish, and I'd be really keen on doing a language exchange if you're interested in practicing your English!

I'm open to all sorts of adventures, from wandering through the Albaic√≠n's charming streets and soaking in the views from the Alhambra (maybe even visiting together if tickets allow!), to discovering hidden tapas bars and enjoying the local culture.

A little about me: I'm a pretty laid-back person who enjoys wandering around, taking in the sights, and maybe stopping for a coffee or some tapas. I'm looking for someone who's up for a relaxed and friendly exploration.

Then when I finally msuter up the courage to tell her my feelings, I find out she's joining the military and will be moving far away. So I just, never confess how I feel and say my goodbye, and I hadn't really heard from her since.

That is until December of 2024, when out of the blue I get a text from Stacy and I was almost shellshocked. She said she had finished her active duty, and that she'd be visiting her family for the holidays and wanted to see me again. I was so nervous and overjoyed, and hopeful that just maybe, she could feel the same way and that I had been given a second chance. So we hang out a few times, grab coffee and then drinks and the whole while the chemistry is electric. We also started texting daily, sharing music recommendations, and I could feel myself very quickly developing feelinbs for her again. On one particular night as things are winding down, before I even get a chance to confess my feelings, she kisses me first. I feel like I'm floating on Cloud 9, and I tell her I've had feelings for her for years. She says she felt the same, and we spend the holidays together living life like a cheesy Christmas movie. The last night I saw her before she left I gifted her a necklace from Tiffany's. Which in hindsight, maybe wasn't a great idea...

Cut to January of this year now, she's gone back home after the holidays, and I thought we had agreed to visit one another intermittently and try a long distance thing. I start hearing from her less and less but I just assume she's busy with grad school and work. Then February rolls around, and I want to know if she'd like to see one another for Valentines day and I ask what exactly there is between us... she tells me that with everything she has going on between work, school and her other obligations, she just can't be in a relationship at this point but hopes we can still be friends. I got this message as I was leaving work, and once again I feel just shellshocked. I sit in my car staring at this verbal gut punch for like 5 minutes before tears start to well up in my eyes and I spend another 30 minutes after that just feeling devastated. Even now I feel like a fool, and part of me wonders if I would've been better off had she never reached out to me again at all. I wish I knew how to end this story and say I've moved on, but honestly I dunno if I will. The first time she left I spiraled into a pretty bad depression, and I can feel it happening again. And I wonder if perhaps it was something I did wrong or if I said too much too fast, thinking it was OK because we had history. I'll probably never know, but I wish I could. So now I guess the question is, what do I do now?

Tl;dr The girl i met and fell for in college, who left and joined the military reaches out to me again after 7 years. I fall for her again, thinking she wants a relationship, only to be told she doesn't and I'm crushed again. ",1,1745594470.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

1k7nges,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1k7nges/why_should_you_consider_the_rancilio_classe_7/,Why Should You Consider the Rancilio Classe 7 Espresso Machine Review?,"The **Rancilio Classe 7** Espresso Machine, specifically the Classe 7 model, boasts features tailored for coffee enthusiasts who crave commercial-grade performance in a domestic or small caf√© setting. Sporting a robust design and a fully automatic operation, I‚Äôve used this espresso machine extensively, and I have quite a few takeaways to share from my hands-on experience. Let‚Äôs dig into some of the details, the highlights, and a few caveats for those who might be considering this device.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This machine is a behemoth in the kitchen. At 135 pounds, its weight alone screams durability and commercial-grade build. The black exterior is sleek and fits seamlessly into a professional or modern home kitchen environment. The **LCD screen and soft-touch keypad** immediately stood out as user-friendly features. I appreciated how the machine‚Äôs high cup clearance allowed me to brew directly into taller coffee mugs, sparing me any awkward transfer to smaller cups. Attention to such practical details is something I value in premium appliances.

[Check Rancilio Classe 7 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b007drutea/)  

**Ease of Use**  
Setting up the espresso machine wasn't the easiest task due to its sheer size and complexity. However, the fully automatic functionality, paired with the **auto volumetric feature**, simplified the day-to-day operation. I'm no barista, but the accuracy in brewing shot after shot without needing constant monitoring proved immensely satisfying. The keypad was intuitive once I familiarized myself with it, and the **LCD screen** provided clear prompts for almost every operation. It certainly makes you feel like a coffee pro, even if you‚Äôre just warming up to the espresso lifestyle.

**Optimal Performance**  
The first thing I noticed when brewing was the consistency in the shots. The **reusable filter** is a great addition, reducing the cost and waste associated with disposable filters. The machine‚Äôs **11-liter boiler capacity** offers more than enough steaming power to handle multiple rounds of coffee-making without losing efficiency. I tested it during a family gathering, brewing ten espressos in a short span, and the machine never faltered. That being said, due to its powerful heating and brewing system, this product is clearly geared toward medium to larger-scale use rather than just a casual espresso drinker.

**Highlighting the Pros**  
With my extended experience, here's what stood out:  
- Sturdy and professional-grade build quality, ideal for long-term use.  
- Fully automatic operation with programmable volumetrics for precise brewing.  
- High-capacity boiler supports multiple drinks without requiring downtime.  
- User-friendly interface, including a soft-touch keypad and LCD screen.  

**Potential Flaws to Consider**  
While the machine is undoubtedly impressive, a few points left room for improvement:  
- Its size and weight make it difficult to move or reposition without assistance.  
- Offers a steep learning curve for newcomers to high-end espresso machines.  
- The absence of detailed instructions in the box made initial setup frustrating.

**Competitors in the Market**  
Comparing the Classe 7 to other espresso machines, especially in the super-automatic range, introduced some interesting perspectives. For instance, machines like the Breville Oracle Touch or the Jura E8 cater more to individual consumers and often include integrated grinders‚Äîsomething this machine lacks. While grinders can be purchased separately, they add to the cost and counter space needed. However, the Classe 7 excels in areas such as brewing volume and overall durability compared to home-focused alternatives like the Gaggia Anima. It‚Äôs clear the Classe 7 is better aligned with semi-commercial settings rather than straightforward, plug-and-go use.

**Price Performance**  
When discussing high-end appliances, price naturally becomes a critical point of evaluation. The Classe 7 isn‚Äôt for the faint of budget, and it‚Äôs important to weigh its cost against its features. For anyone running a small caf√© or hosting regular gatherings, the investment makes sense. It delivers reliable performance and a premium espresso experience that‚Äôs hard to replicate with lower-tier machines. That said, casual coffee drinkers or smaller households may struggle to justify its cost-effectiveness in light of their less frequent brewing needs.

1k7ncv3,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1k7ncv3/petty_revenge_is_best_served_remotely/,Petty revenge is best served remotely,"I worked for a company and one of the employees was a total dickstain. Karl was impossible to work with, and was on his fourth or fifth officemate. Management knew what was happening, and they decided not to move another victim into his office. Karl actually bragged about it, saying, ""If you're enough of an asshole you'll get a private office"". Those were his exact words. He even got a lock put on the office door so he could lock it when he wasn't in it. This fact is important. 

  
One of his earlier officemates (Denise) became the IT technician. Because she couldn't do anything on his PC unless he was there to let her in, she secretly added the capability to remote into his computer so she could do what she needed to it without having to listen to him complain about the disruption she was causing him.  



Denise finally got fed up with his bragging about being an asshole (truthful as it was) and decided to take action. Karl never logged out of his Windows account, since he could lock the door when he was out. That meant that when she went in remotely, any actions she took would be logged under his User ID. When he would leave his office (to use the restroom or get coffee), she would remote in and  bring up a browser window. Then she'd visit some websites that shouldn't have been visited. She couldn't go to, say, a porn site, because they were blocked. But she could try, and the attempt would be audited. And other inappropriate websites, like sex toys, were attempted and audit records generated. 



After a short period of time, the System Administrator noticed the number of blocked attempts, and went to Karl's boss. When Karl was questioned about it, he claimed that someone else was using his computer to do that. That didn't fly because his office was locked, preventing anyone else to access his computer. Also, the attempts were sandwiched in between his normal activity, during working hours, sometimes a gap of only a few minutes. 

  
Karl was reprimanded, lost his office privilege, and moved to an open cubicle (a huge demotion for one with his seniority) with the stipulation that his monitor be placed so that anyone walking by could see what was on it. Denise, as the IT person, was the one to transfer his computer to the cubicle, and she obliterated the evidence of the software that allowed her to remote in before installing it there, since she didn't need to anymore. 

  
Denise and I dated later on, for a few months, and she confessed what she had done, swearing me to secrecy. This is the first time I have broken that agreement. I did change the names to protect both the innocent and the guilty.

Context:  I am a 40 year old female with obesity, PCOS (controlled), hypothyroidism (controlled), and primary membraneous nephropathy (eFGR intact).  Despite following the plans of my dietician, I am unable to lose weight.  I am 5‚Äô 5‚Äù and 290lbs.  I feel like something is genuinely wrong with my body.  I know PCOS and hypothyroid can make weight loss challenging, but it shouldn‚Äôt be impossible.  Before the dietician, I spent the last decade trying every diet and even disordered eating to lose weight.  The most I can lose is 10 lbs before I plateau and gain it back, even when I spend months trying to push through the plateau.  Conversely, I can also give up, eat fast food every other day and eat chips and sugary cereal and still maintain my baseline weight within a 10 lb. range.  My weight stays basically the same, whether I am sedentary or hiking 1-2 hours 4 times per week.


Medications:  Metformin (for PCOS), lisinopril (for kidney, I have normal blood pressure), methylphenidate (ADHD), levothyroxine, vitamin D3, multivitamin.


Labs: All labs indicated within normal range unless otherwise noted


Parathyroid Hormone Intact - 19 
CBC with Auto Diff - all normal
Albumin - 3 (low)
eGFR - 114
Folate, serum - 11.6 ng/ml
Vitamin B12 - 358
Cortisol, AM - 8.5
T3 Free - 2.8
T4 Free - 1.2
Thyroid Stimulating Hormone - 1.70
Protein/Creatinine Ratio - 1500 (1.5g proteinuria)
PLA2R - positive (confirms idiopathic membraneous nephropathy)
Comprehensive metabolic panel - all normal
Vitamin D was low but took 50,000 scrip and waiting for new test 


Current plan with dietician:  1800 calories per day including 3 meals and 2 snacks, eating about every 3 hours.  Meals focus on lean protein, healthy fat, and fiber.  It is low sugar, low sodium, and moderate carbs.  I‚Äôve been following it strictly for 30 days including weighing/measuring portions without any change in weight.  Prior to this I was eating fast food 1-2 times per day in addition to eating large portions at home.  


Most of my meals are made from the following ingredients:  avocado, free range eggs, local made sourdough bread, free range chicken breast or thigh (no skin), wild caught salmon, lean grass fed beef, olive oil, beans, full fat greek yogurt (sparingly), cauliflower rice mixed with 1/2 cup rice, salad greens, broccoli, peas, green beans, bell peppers, carrots, onions, mushrooms, zucchini, sweet potatoes, russet potatoes, high protein pasta, low sugar marinara, hummus, strawberries, blueberries, unsweetened organic almond milk, chia seeds, flax seeds, and vegan protein powder, wild rice cakes, organic peanut butter, coffee, green tea.  I am not eating ANY fast food or boxed meals or desserts.


Is there anything my doctor and dietician might be missing?  I keep hearing medical professionals tell me it just takes time or I must be eating more than I realize.  I‚Äôm tired of off handed comments like ‚Äúwell, we really need to watch our portion sizes‚Äù when I am measuring it or ‚Äúyou know, coffee drinks have a lot of sugar‚Äù when I literally just have unsweetened espresso with half & half.  It‚Äôs so frustrating that no one will take me seriously.

Context for this company: 
they‚Äôve been doing pretty terrible for the last year as their segment is being intruded by AI based tooling and projected to continue to loose revenue due to this 

Context for my role at this company: 
I‚Äôve been with them for a couple of years. My performance has always been good to even exceeding their expectations up until recently. I‚Äôm an IC though this role requires solid leadership qualities as I need a team of people to execute on plans throughout the year and deliver results. 
When I first joined the company I completely turned a team around to be a high performing, reliable team, they saw this, took advantage of it and consistently slotted me in areas where there‚Äôs high urgency/huge fires to put out and every single time I‚Äôve been able to deliver. Because of the constantly moving me from problem to problem, the need for me to not only pickup up new knowledge quickly but to also apply them like an expert in that field, I‚Äôve been burning out faster than other peers in similar roles. 

Fast forward to these past few months with new leadership, again they slot me into an very complex situation, larger teams, even more demanding results due to their declining company performance and normally I would be able to deliver (I know I‚Äôm capable of this) however here‚Äôs some challenges I‚Äôve ran into: 
- the group of people I work with have been with the company for many years, they are at a point where they are doing less than the absolute minimum to coast, they‚Äôre doing less than that! So getting them to deliver things has absolutely been a nightmare, saying they‚Äôll do soemthing but never doing it, forgetting to prep materials, takes sometime a day or two for a simple response ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve flagged this but what I‚Äôve been doing is working 3 times as hard and essentially covering for them cause of the tight deadlines. If they don‚Äôt deliver, I‚Äôm essentially screwed. 
- one of them has an issue with me as they‚Äôve been with the company for so long in a similar role as I am and they essentially want to be where I am, they complain and twist everything I say or ask them to do as me demeaning them or undermining their role etc. 

Why I think they‚Äôre trying to get me to quit: 
I‚Äôve been reflecting on the feedback I‚Äôve been getting for the past month and a lot of it just doesn‚Äôt make sense or the feedback is contradictory from one day to another, I‚Äôm working harder than ever before and still delivering results but the planning to get there was rocky due to those members who weren‚Äôt pulling their weight and admitedly it‚Äôs taken me longer to ramp up this time as the area is much more complex, so the planning was rough but the end result is still a plan in place on them to begin executing them. But here‚Äôs why I think they‚Äôre just trying to get rid of me without firing: 
- them not feeling like I‚Äôm able to do this job by making ominous sounding remarks like: if you don‚Äôt meet this target by end of this quarter we‚Äôll need to have a conversation, the pressure is only going to increase, if your team is not delivering then you‚Äôre also not delivering, it‚Äôs going to be tough for you at the end of the year if the planning continues as it has been 
- regarding the planning: the work I‚Äôm doing is being scrutinized down to the word which is a complete contrast to how my other peers are being treated (I know this as the documentation is shared and through my chats with them) 
- they‚Äôll provide feedback that a plan is sound and looks good only for them to say it‚Äôs shit the next day, they‚Äôll pull it a part and the best thing is, they‚Äôll use my own words, suggestions or doubts that i had as if it‚Äôs their own 
- I received a 2% raise recently where most of my teammates, not just peers received at minimum 5% to 10%+, this is to reward last year where I delivered 2 major projects! This honestly doesn‚Äôt make sense. 
- the last thing which I think is the main reason: they plan to hire someone more senior to replace me in my role and I‚Äôd essentially play a smaller role under them .. my salary at my current role is definitely low, but within the new role, basically a demotion, my current salary is actually decent‚Ä¶ they can absolutely hire someone cheaper to do this smaller role than what they‚Äôre paying me now ‚Ä¶ I suspect they‚Äôve been thinking about this when they slotted me into this new team and expected amazing results right out do the gate, when they didn‚Äôt get that that right away or in the way they wanted it they started trying to get me to quit instead , oh one more; 
- the company has gone through 2 layoffs in the previous year and some quiet firings for executive roles late last year, i assume more explicit firing + the financial difficulties they‚Äôre facing probably doesn‚Äôt look good 

Where I‚Äôm currently at: 
I‚Äôve mentioned before that they know I‚Äôm a high performer and very reliable at delivering results so they simply plug me where there‚Äôs huge fires to put out, something that my other peers would not be very good at, in the process for the past year now even before all of this started I‚Äôve been on the trajectory of burning out. I had already been thinking about working until the end of the year so i can reach a certain financial target and then quitting, travel for a year and then look for jobs after. And because of how burned out I‚Äôve been and the work  getting shittier i simply was not in the mental space to look for new jobs. 
I‚Äôve lost so much sleep due to this job, on average i sleep maybe 4hours, I don‚Äôt have time for lunch, sometimes just a coffee for the entire day and only eating late at night due to the amount of work and covering up for others, my mental and physical health has been affected by this job. 
With the news of hiring someone more senior to replace me at my role what‚Äôs the best approach here? I‚Äôve thought about: 
- quitting now, give two weeks, take a short break to get my mental and physical health back, then start applying to jobs
- work through this and start applying for jobs although I‚Äôm absolutely miserable at this point and I‚Äôve got such low energy that I would absolutely need to push myself to the limits to do both 
- push my self to the absolute limit, work through until the end of the year when I hopefully reach my financial goal then quit, fix my mental health afterwards with my original plan of travelling for a year
- reflecting on what they‚Äôve been doing, something just seems off, I‚Äôve built a strong reputation for being a high performer over the years, some of their feedback just makes no sense, should I hire an employment lawyer? Is it even worth it at this point?

I‚Äôm in my late 30s, single, working in the law sector‚Äî and while I love this city for its culture, food, and overall vibe, I‚Äôm genuinely confused these days about where people¬†*actually*¬†meet each other anymore.

To be upfront: I‚Äôm not into the bar scene. Had a couple of unsettling experiences that kinda made me swear off that environment. I‚Äôm also someone who genuinely enjoys meaningful conversation, cozy corners, and those random chats that used to happen in person before‚Ä¶ well,¬†*everything*¬†became online-first. 

I‚Äôm not new to meeting people. In fact, and I say this as humbly as I can ‚Äî I‚Äôve won a few beauty pageants over the years (I won‚Äôt say more for privacy reasons), so attracting attention was never the issue. But lately? It feels like men just don‚Äôt approach women anymore. Not like they used to. It‚Äôs like everyone‚Äôs either glued to their phones or just assumes you‚Äôre unavailable. Is this a post-pandemic thing? A dating-app thing? (Not for me). Am I imagining it?

So here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking for ‚Äî recommendations. Are there any coffee shops, caf√©s, community spaces, or even bookstores in Montreal where people still, you know‚Ä¶ make eye contact? Where you can sit with a book or your laptop, but also not feel weird if you strike up a conversation or someone smiles at you?

I‚Äôve tried Caf√© Olimpico, Caf√© Pista, 49th Parallel ‚Äî love them ‚Äî but sometimes it feels more laptop-heavy than people-oriented, if that makes sense? Any spots where the social energy feels a little more open, spontaneous?

Would love to hear your thoughts. Honest, curious, and hopeful here.

Sure time loops, new enemies, COMPLETELY different characters that kinda mixed the game characters personality traits. I liked that BUT-

I was expecting for the movie to redeem itself by just making the story make sense but MY GOD! it did not! 

No, it didnt take place in a different universe because theres a scene where Dr. Hill literally had Josh Washingtons patient file. The film took place after (probably in the future) the blackwood pines incident or the game. 

No, they didnt explain WHY there were wendigos. There were just wendigos there, it wasnt even the sole reason for having indigenous natives on a mountain and an evil spirit once you commit cannibalism reason. It was because the town that the movie was placed had a mining accident and made a HUGE sink hole that swallowed the small town whole. It didnt explain, why it was there nor why Dr. Hill is expermenting on the townsfolk before. 
> the thing about Dr. Hill in this film is that he guided the characters and told MC that WaS tHiS aLl iN yOuR HeAd, kind of defeating the fun headcanon that Dr. Hill was Josh's sanity of not going to shit! (He also just DIED after he drank water that BY THE WAY makes you explode once you drank it. Cause mf brought a cup of coffee, put it on his desk, had a monolouge, and only for the MC to see a leak on the ceiling and slide his cup to the water and him NOT EVEN NOTICING IT)

And finally, NO. They did not explain WHY there was a time loop in the first place. To add as well, after the characters successfully got out and made it until dawn. They were never heard ever again, not a single thing. They just sighed in relief, smiled, went to the car, and drove off. 

Thennnnn Uh Oh! A sequel tease! And this time THERES SNOW. If you watched this knowing it came from a game, youd probably understand but without it? Its bad writing:( ",4,1745593591.0,untildawn,1,0.83,False

I personally have HORRIBLE social anxiety but find I spend maybe an unhealthy amount of time by myself when I'm not with my husband. So I wanted to try to be proactive and try to connect with others who maybe feel the same way or are just looking for things to do with others. 
Here is a bit of what I'm working towards and an open invite to see if others are interested, though I warn you all I'm basically a grandma at 31 üòÇ so please don't judge.

Saturday and Sunday Mornings I do the free walking club at the Louisville Zoo. It's from 8am- 9:30am and I usually try to do 2 laps if I get there right at 8 or one if I get there late at 9. There's currently also the free 5k club across from the zoo, I've been tempted to check out. 

After walking club on Saturdays I enjoy going to the farmers market and getting some fresh produce to add into mymeals when needed (usually once a month but I'm happy to walk them weekly).

Saturdays or Sundays when the weather isn't great I enjoy going to local libraries and using their gardening, home repair/update, and meal prep books to get ideas on how to better use my house/land, and to create my meal plan so I can then go to store on Sunday mornings and start cooking. (Or place a pick up order somewhere so I can plan and shop without splurge shopping). 

Sometimes I also just sit and read or work on DND character sheets-- this can also be a local coffee shop if I'm just looking for some time away from my house! 

I also enjoy checking out local museums and shows and hold a season ticket to shows at the KY center on Saturday matinees. There's also great performances at local schools and theaters so when a show is available I try to go! (Southern IN and Louisville).

Currently I'm looking for places that do classes for individuals who want to learn various hobbies or skills and I know Michaels, the library and sometimes Lowe's will put on classes, so if you hear of an opportunity please share!

I also have a PF membership that lets me bring a friend if anyone ever wants to go workout...... I'm not in the greatest shape but I've been on a small fitness journey since August so learning how to eat right and what to do in the gym. This is a massive change for me, and I definitely welcome others to join if they want to, and will happily share my membership! 

I'm also currently looking for volunteer opportunities to get out and help my community. I'm not super religious/ churchy but I'm willing to work with a church to do some volunteering! Some areas I care greatly about are organizations that help women and children, animals (specifically animal rescue and spay/neuter) since I have 4 rescues that are my whole world üåç , social justice issues aimed at helping BLM/Women/ LGBTQ+/Education/Helping those in proverty/food equality- community gardens/ and nature preservation. 

If any of this is something you maybe interested in or know a good resource to connect to, please feel free to share!

1k7n6ej,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k7n6ej,Secondary Co-ferment Update,"Hey All, 

  
Just wanted to follow up on my post from a couple months back regarding secondary co-fermented coffee experiments. As I have scaled these up to a manageable production batch size I've learned a lot and thought I could pass some of that along for those who may be interested in trying something similar. My first post detailing the process is [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1it8h2j/secondary_coferments/)

  
As a quick refresher: I am a former head brewer and brewery owner for a large brewery. I've been roasting the coffee we use in our beers for years, and as I've left the industry, coffee felt like a second home. Having had some co-fermented coffee from various producers/ roasters with very obvious fermentation flaws, I've seen an opportunity to utilize my experience with beer fermentation in the coffee world. 

  
My general process of secondary fermentation with coffee has been to source a high quality green (Currently using Ethiopia Hambela Goro from Coffee Shrub) ferment the green coffee in a base of honey, water, various yeasts and pureed fruits. My most recent full size production batch of 6kg was using Blueberry, lemon, orange blossom honey, and champagne yeast. Then air dry the coffee using perforated screens and fans over the course of 7-10 days. Then finally roast! The photos below show the process of fermentation, rinsing, drying, and roasting. 

Here are some bullet points of what I have learned:

* The extra sugars added during fermentation will make the roasted coffee visually appear darker. However the ground samples and flavor match that of the roasted weight loss. A more extreme version of what happens with dry process coffee
* Some beans will absorb the color of the fruit used while others will not. Seems to be about 15% or so. Maybe they are more porous.
* Keeping the alcohol content below 6% will avoid boozy off flavors
* Utilizing a sanitary fermentation will avoid funky off flavors
* Certain fermentation adjuncts (cinnamon) will add noticeable bitterness
* Going much longer than 72 hours of fermentation leads to beans that begin germinating and a big loss in cell structure of the seed itself. Fermentation that I have done longer than this have no auditory crack at all. 
* This is a labor of love and probably not viable on a large scale and as such I'll probably only do about 6kg a month. That being said, the coffees have been turning out amazing. And have such an intense fruit flavor while displaying no weird, funky, fusel character. My girlfriend could smell the blueberry lemonade character coming off this batch down the hallway as I was making a pour over. ",7,1745593446.0,roasting,2,1.0,False

Okay, let‚Äôs be real for a second. We all have those days‚Äîor weeks‚Äîwhere it feels like we‚Äôre *stuck in the grind*. You know, when you‚Äôre working hard but not really getting anywhere? It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre running on a treadmill, pouring in the effort, but all you‚Äôre getting in return is sweaty socks and a sore back. 

Well, I recently stumbled upon a little trick that‚Äôs changed my game, and it only takes **10 seconds**. Yup, ten! So, if you‚Äôve got ten seconds, why not transform your day?

Here‚Äôs how it goes:

1. **Pause**: Just stop whatever you‚Äôre doing for a moment. Seriously. Put down that coffee cup and take a breath.
   
2. **Breathe**: Inhale deeply for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, then exhale for 4 seconds. Feel like a yoga guru yet? Even if you don‚Äôt, it works wonders.

3. **Reframe**: Ask yourself: ""What's the ONE thing I can do right now to make this better?"" Sometimes it‚Äôs as simple as changing your perspective! 

4. **Smile**: Yup, silly as it sounds. Flashing that pearly white can actually boost your mood. Plus, it confuses everyone around you. 

5. **Reignite**: Get back to your task with a fresh mindset. Like you just chugged on some mental rocket fuel! üöÄ

**Why does this work?** 

- **Instant clarity**: You step outside your whirlwind of thoughts and reconnect with your purpose.
- **Boosted mood**: There‚Äôs magic in mindfulness and laughter. It‚Äôs like a mini vacation for your brain!
- **Peak performance**: That tiny reset can lead to big breakthroughs. Who knew ten seconds could be so powerful?

Here‚Äôs a funny personal story: Last week, I was deep in spreadsheets (which, let‚Äôs be honest, can be a black hole of concentration), feeling more like a zombie than a motivated human. Then I remembered my ten-second trick, took that breath, and‚Äîbam!‚Äîmy next idea was a total game-changer. It was like my brain went from dial-up to high-speed internet. 

So, next time you‚Äôre feeling swamped, overwhelmed, or just plain stuck, try this quick reset. Who knows what magic awaits on the other side of those ten seconds? 

How do you recharge when you're in the middle of the grind? What little tricks help you regain focus and motivation? I‚Äôd love to hear all your gems! üåü",1,1745593348.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

German EPA Type 4, best before Feb2025.

A great ration. Filling, hearty, great diversity in snacks, and great tasting!

Pic 1 shows the pea stew with Cocktail weiners and 2 slices of the canned rye bread with the Peppered butter spread. A great main dish, super hearty, savory, and filling. The weakest link in this dish was the cocktail weiners, they simply come off as ""generic"" here. The bread with spread is a nice touch and I'm sure this adds a sense of normalcy to the craziness of war time.

Pics 2-7 show packaging and contents. You'll notice there are no biscuits in this ration. That letter in Pic 4 explains why.

Pic 8 is the muesli with apples and strawberries. Quite good, sweet and filling. Made with cold water only, very creamy. 

Pic 9 is the sausage and potato strew. This meal was the winner here. Hearty, but this was sweet as opposed to savory, which was a welcoming and unexpected distraction. Would have been better with beans in place of the sausages to be honest, as ,once again, these sausages were the weakest links in this dish as the texture was not ideal and the flavor was simply ""meh"". Potatos and the sauce were fantastic!

Pic 10 is the tuna. A solid addition to any ration in my opinion. 

Pic 11 is the tropical fruit mix. This was perfect. Those chunks of coconut are always a treat. 

Pic 12 shows one of the canned meats and both jams. The bread is actually from an Australian CR1M, not this German ration, but since no biscuits were to be found, counter measures were taken. Fan freaking tactic this was. Those jams are top notch, particularly that sour cherry one, and the bread, to steal a line from Mark, forget about it!

Pic 13 shows the other canned meat on the rye bread and one of the energy bars. No complaints here!

Pic 14 is the chocolate mouse with a small amount of Hu salted dark chocolate shaved into it. This was great! Different taste and texture than normal chocolate pudding. I put it in the freezer for 11 min after mixing well, turned out amazing!

Pic 15 is the vanilla cookies and one of the chocolate bars (you get 2!!!). Those little cookies pack a wonderful flavor punch, and the chocolate is more than satisfactory!

The coffees, teas, and especially the beverage bases, are always good in these rations and they do a great job of giving you a variety of flavors (4 flavors in this one). The jerky was also great but was stolen by my kiddo before a pic could be taken, hint, it looks like normal jerky.

All-in-all, a great experience and I highly recommend checking these out!

Take care folks!

# My Problem Before MITOLYN

Before I started using MITOLYN, I felt like I was constantly running on empty. My mornings started with exhaustion, and by the afternoon, I was completely wiped out. No matter how much I slept, I still woke up tired. My brain felt foggy, making it hard to focus on schoolwork or even have fun with my friends and family. I tried eating better, drinking more water, and even some trendy supplements, but nothing worked for more than a few days. I just wanted to wake up feeling fresh and have energy that lasted all day.

When I heard about MITOLYN, I was honestly skeptical. It sounded like just another product making big promises. But after reading so many positive reviews, I decided to give it one shot. I figured, what do I have to lose?

# First Impressions Matter ‚Äì And MITOLYN Nails It

The first thing that stood out to me about MITOLYN was the packaging. When my order arrived, the box looked bright and clean, and everything inside was carefully packed. It felt like opening a gift, not just another boring bottle of pills. The instructions were easy to follow, and there were even helpful tips included, which made me feel confident about how to start.

What really impressed me was how clear and honest the information was. There were no confusing words or hidden ingredients. I knew exactly what I was taking, and it gave me peace of mind. It‚Äôs nice when a company takes the time to make sure you know what you‚Äôre getting.

# The Results Were Almost Instant

I‚Äôm not the type to expect miracles, but with MITOLYN, I started to notice real changes quickly. Within the first week, my energy levels picked up. Instead of dreading my alarm clock, I woke up ready to get out of bed. I didn‚Äôt need extra cups of coffee or sugary snacks to stay awake during class or while doing chores.

My mind felt clearer, too. I could focus better on homework and remember things more easily. Even my mood improved‚ÄîI felt more cheerful, and little things didn‚Äôt bother me as much. It was like someone turned the lights back on in my brain.

And the best part? My energy didn‚Äôt crash in the afternoon. I could play outside, hang out with friends, and still have energy left for family time in the evening.

# Why MITOLYN Stands Out

What makes MITOLYN different from all the other supplements I‚Äôve tried? Here‚Äôs what I noticed:

- **Top-Notch Ingredients:** MITOLYN doesn‚Äôt use weird chemicals or fake stuff. Every ingredient is simple and natural, and they all work together to help your body make more energy.
- **Real Results, Real Fast:** Some products take months to work, but MITOLYN started helping me in just a few days. I didn‚Äôt have to wait or wonder if it was worth it.
- **No Side Effects:** I was worried it might upset my stomach or make me feel weird, but I felt totally normal‚Äîjust better!
- **Easy on the Wallet:** When I thought about all the money I wasted on things that didn‚Äôt work, MITOLYN actually saved me money. I only needed this one product instead of a whole bunch of different ones.
- **Trusted by Thousands:** Seeing so many happy reviews online made me feel like I was making a smart choice. It wasn‚Äôt just me‚Äîlots of people love it!

# People Around Me Noticed

One of the coolest things was that other people started to see the difference in me. My parents asked if I‚Äôd changed my routine because I seemed less tired and more focused. A few friends even said I seemed happier and more fun to be around.

When I told them about MITOLYN, they were just as curious as I was at first. Some of them tried it too, and they all thanked me later for sharing my secret. It felt good to help others feel better, just like MITOLYN helped me.

# Customer Support That Actually Cares

I had a small problem with my delivery‚Äîthe package got delayed. I reached out to MITOLYN‚Äôs customer service, and they replied super fast. They were friendly, listened to my concern, and made sure I got my order as soon as possible. They even checked in afterward to make sure I was happy. It‚Äôs rare to find a company that actually cares about its customers, but MITOLYN impressed me.

# Would I Recommend MITOLYN?

No question‚ÄîI definitely recommend MITOLYN. I already told my family, my friends, and even some teachers about it. I only share things that really work for me, and MITOLYN is one of those rare finds. If you‚Äôre feeling tired, foggy, or just not like yourself, I think MITOLYN could help you, too.

# My Struggle with Exhaustion and Mental Fog

Ever since I was a teen, I felt like I was running on empty. No matter how much I slept, I‚Äôd wake up groggy and worn out. I‚Äôd sit at my desk, staring at my computer screen, and my mind would wander. I‚Äôd forget simple things, lose track of conversations, and sometimes even forget what day it was. It was like living in a fog where nothing felt clear.

I tried everything I could think of‚Äîchugging coffees, taking cold showers, eating ‚Äúsuperfoods,‚Äù and even buying those fancy vitamins you see on TV. Nothing really worked. I felt stuck, and honestly, a little hopeless. I started to think, ‚ÄúMaybe this is just what getting older feels like.‚Äù Then, I heard about MITOLYN from a friend, and I figured, ‚ÄúWhy not give it one more try?‚Äù

# The First Impressions of MITOLYN

When my MITOLYN package arrived, I was both hopeful and skeptical. The bottle looked clean and simple, which I liked. I checked out the ingredient list and was relieved to see it was all stuff I could actually pronounce. There weren‚Äôt any weird chemicals or mystery fillers‚Äîjust nutrients designed to help the energy makers in my cells, called mitochondria.

I liked that MITOLYN focused on helping my body from the inside out, instead of just giving me a quick jolt like caffeine. That made sense to me. If my cells could work better, maybe I could finally feel better too.

# Week 1: Subtle But Positive Changes

The first week, I didn‚Äôt wake up bouncing off the walls or anything. But I noticed little differences. I didn‚Äôt feel quite as heavy in the morning. I hit the snooze button once instead of five times. I got out of bed a little easier. It wasn‚Äôt a miracle, but it was a start.

At work, I realized my thoughts weren‚Äôt as scattered. I could actually finish a task without getting distracted every five minutes. My brain felt cleaner, like someone had wiped away the foggy window I‚Äôd been looking through.

# Week 2: Increased Energy and Less Mental Fog

By the second week, the changes became clearer. My energy wasn‚Äôt just higher‚Äîit was more steady. I didn‚Äôt crash in the afternoon or reach for an extra cup of coffee. Instead, I moved through my day with a quiet confidence. I felt awake, not just awake-but-tired.

I also noticed I was sleeping better. I used to toss and turn, waking up tired. But now, I fell asleep faster and woke up feeling refreshed. It‚Äôs amazing how much better everything feels after a good night‚Äôs sleep.

# Week 3: Transformation in My Daily Life

Three weeks in, I felt like a new person. I was keeping up with my work, staying focused in meetings, and even finding time for hobbies I‚Äôd forgotten about. I wasn‚Äôt just surviving the day‚ÄîI was actually living it.

People started to notice, too. Friends asked if I‚Äôd changed my routine because I seemed more upbeat and present. I smiled more, laughed more, and started looking forward to things again. It wasn‚Äôt just about having more energy; it was about enjoying life instead of feeling stuck in a tired fog all the time.

# The Science Behind MITOLYN: Why It Works

So, what makes MITOLYN special? It all comes down to how it supports your mitochondria‚Äîthe tiny engines in your cells that make energy. If your mitochondria aren‚Äôt working well, you feel tired, slow, and mentally foggy. MITOLYN helps these engines run smoothly.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs inside and why it matters:

- **CoQ10:** This antioxidant helps your cells make energy and protects them from damage.
- **Acetyl-L-Carnitine:** It boosts brain power and helps your mitochondria use fuel more efficiently.
- **PQQ:** This unique nutrient helps your body grow more healthy mitochondria, so you can make even more energy.
- **NAD+ Boosters:** These help your body recharge and keep you feeling young and alert.

Instead of just covering up your tiredness, MITOLYN helps fix the root cause by making your cells healthier and stronger.

# Why You Should Try MITOLYN

If you‚Äôre tired of feeling tired, MITOLYN is definitely worth a shot. It‚Äôs not a magic pill, but it helps your body work the way it‚Äôs supposed to. Instead of quick fixes or harsh chemicals, you‚Äôre giving your cells what they need to do their job. That means more energy, clearer thinking, and a better mood‚Äîevery single day.

Whether you‚Äôre busy at work, taking care of your family, or just want to feel like yourself again, MITOLYN helps you keep up with life. You don‚Äôt have to rely on endless coffee or sugary snacks. You just start feeling better‚Äînaturally.

# üî¨ What Is MITOLYN?

Let me start with the basics: MITOLYN is a supplement made to help your body produce more energy‚Äîright down at the cellular level. You might remember learning in school that mitochondria are the ‚Äúpower plants‚Äù in our cells. Well, MITOLYN is designed to give those tiny power plants a major boost! Unlike energy drinks or sugary snacks that just make you hyper for a little while, MITOLYN aims to help your body create real, lasting energy from the inside out. It‚Äôs like upgrading your body‚Äôs own batteries so you feel energized all day without jitters or crashes. 

MITOLYN isn‚Äôt just for athletes or people who work out all the time. It‚Äôs made for anyone who feels tired, sluggish, or mentally foggy and wants to feel their best again. Whether you‚Äôre sitting at a desk, running after kids, or trying to focus on homework, MITOLYN claims to help you power through your day with more energy and clearer thinking.

# üåø MITOLYN Ingredients: What Makes It So Effective?

What‚Äôs actually inside MITOLYN that‚Äôs causing such a stir? I looked into the ingredient list, and it‚Äôs packed with stuff that scientists have studied for years. Here are some of the main things you‚Äôll find in every capsule:

- **Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10):** This is a natural antioxidant your body needs to make energy. It‚Äôs great for your heart and brain too!
- **PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone):** This fancy-sounding nutrient actually helps create new mitochondria in your cells, so your body can make more energy.
- **Acetyl-L-Carnitine:** This helps your body turn fat into energy. It‚Äôs also known to help with focus and memory.
- **Alpha Lipoic Acid:** Another antioxidant that helps protect your cells and supports your metabolism.
- **Magnesium & B-Vitamins:** These are basic but super important for turning food into energy and keeping your nerves calm.

All these ingredients work together to help you feel more awake, alert, and ready to go. The best part? MITOLYN is made without artificial junk or weird fillers. Everything in it has a purpose‚Äîand it‚Äôs all about helping you feel your best.

# ‚ö° How Does MITOLYN Work?

So, how does MITOLYN actually help you get more energy? Here‚Äôs what happens inside your body when you take it:

1. **Fuels Your Cells:** The main job of MITOLYN is to help your mitochondria work better. When your mitochondria are strong, they make more ATP, which is the chemical your body uses for energy. More ATP means you‚Äôll feel less sluggish and more ready to move.
2. **Clears Up Brain Fog:** Many of the ingredients in MITOLYN help your brain cells communicate better. That means you can remember things faster, focus longer, and think more clearly.
3. **Boosts Your Mood and Recovery:** When you‚Äôre not so tired all the time, it‚Äôs easier to feel happy and motivated. Plus, MITOLYN helps your body bounce back faster from stress or tough workouts.

Most people say they start to notice a difference in their energy and focus within about a week. And if you keep taking it, the benefits can build up even more over time.

# üë• Who Is MITOLYN For?

MITOLYN isn‚Äôt just for one type of person‚Äîit‚Äôs for anyone who wants to feel more energized and focused. Here are just a few groups who might love it:

- **Busy professionals and students:** If you‚Äôre burning the candle at both ends and struggling to stay sharp, MITOLYN could help you focus better and get more done.
- **People who feel tired all the time:** If fatigue is holding you back, MITOLYN‚Äôs ingredients are designed to help you get your pep back.
- **Fitness fans:** Whether you‚Äôre hitting the gym or just want to recover faster from daily activity, MITOLYN can help your muscles and brain keep up.
- **Older adults:** As we age, our mitochondria don‚Äôt work as well. MITOLYN helps support your body‚Äôs natural energy production, so you can feel younger and stronger.

Honestly, if you wish you had more energy or clearer thinking, MITOLYN is worth a try.

# ‚úÖ Real Benefits You Can Expect

Now you‚Äôre probably wondering: what could MITOLYN actually do for you? Here‚Äôs what real users (and my own research) say you might notice:

- **Way more physical energy:** Get through the afternoon without needing a nap or another cup of coffee.
- **Sharper memory and thinking:** No more forgetting why you walked into a room!
- **Better focus:** Stay on task at work, school, or home without your mind drifting off.
- **Less fatigue:** Feel refreshed, not drained, even after a busy day.
- **Improved sleep quality:** Wake up feeling rested, not groggy.
- **Happier mood:** When your body‚Äôs running better, it‚Äôs easier to stay positive.

People who take MITOLYN every day say it‚Äôs helped them get more done, feel more confident, and even enjoy life more.

# üõ°Ô∏è Is MITOLYN Safe?

Safety is super important, especially with supplements. I checked, and MITOLYN is made in facilities that follow strict rules (GMP-certified and FDA-registered). It‚Äôs also non-GMO, gluten-free, and doesn‚Äôt have any weird chemicals or fake stuff. Plus, the company has each batch tested by an independent lab to make sure it‚Äôs pure and safe.

Of course, it‚Äôs always smart to talk to your doctor before starting any new supplement, especially if you have health issues or take other medicines. But overall, MITOLYN looks like a safe choice for most people.

# üí¨ What Are Customers Saying?

MITOLYN has been getting some pretty big love online! Here are a few things real customers have said:

- ‚ÄúI have so much more energy in the afternoons now. No more crashing at my desk!‚Äù
- ‚ÄúMy brain fog is gone. I can finally remember things without writing them down.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúI‚Äôve tried a bunch of supplements, but this is the first one that really made a difference.‚Äù

Everyone‚Äôs body is different, but lots of people are calling MITOLYN a ‚Äúgame-changer‚Äù for their daily life.

# üéØ Why You Should Order MITOLYN Today

Here‚Äôs the deal: MITOLYN isn‚Äôt just another pill that sits on your shelf. It‚Äôs designed to help you feel better in real, noticeable ways, using ingredients that science actually backs up. If you want to finally break free from tiredness, brain fog, or just feeling ‚Äúmeh,‚Äù now‚Äôs the perfect time to give MITOLYN a try.

But heads up‚Äîbecause it‚Äôs so popular, MITOLYN sometimes sells out fast. If you‚Äôre serious about feeling your best, don‚Äôt wait too long to order.

# My Problem Before MITOLYN

Before I started using MITOLYN, life honestly felt like walking through mud. My mornings started out okay but by lunchtime, I was exhausted ‚Äî and afternoons were even worse. My brain felt fuzzy, I couldn‚Äôt focus on my work, and my energy would just crash. I tried drinking more coffee, changing my diet, taking naps, and even other supplements, but nothing really helped for more than a day or two.

There were days I‚Äôd get home and just want to collapse, with zero motivation to do anything fun. I started to feel like I was missing out on life because I was always tired and just not myself. My friends even asked if I was okay, and that stung a little.

That‚Äôs when I started looking into ways to actually fix my energy, instead of just covering it up. MITOLYN kept popping up in my searches, and after seeing so many people talking about it, I finally got curious enough to try.

# First Impressions Matter ‚Äì And MITOLYN Nails It

When my MITOLYN box arrived, I was immediately impressed. The packaging was clean, sturdy, and looked like something you‚Äôd find in a high-end store. Everything was packed carefully, and the instructions were printed in big, easy-to-read letters (no squinting required!). 

I liked how MITOLYN spelled out exactly how to use it, how much to take, and even some tips for the best results. No guesswork, no confusion. I started taking it the very next morning, excited but skeptical.

# The Results Were Almost Instant

I know it sounds wild, but I noticed a difference fast. Within the first few days, I felt less groggy in the mornings, and my energy didn‚Äôt drop off a cliff in the afternoon like it used to. By the end of the first week, I realized I hadn‚Äôt needed an extra cup of coffee all week ‚Äî and that was huge for me.

After a couple of weeks, I noticed my focus was sharper. I could get through work and still have energy left to play with my dog or go for a walk in the evening. I didn‚Äôt expect it to happen so quickly, but MITOLYN made me feel like myself again, only better.

# Why MITOLYN Stands Out

I‚Äôve tried loads of products, but MITOLYN is different for a few reasons:

- **Super Clean Ingredients**: Everything in MITOLYN is natural and top quality. No weird chemicals or fillers. I could tell just by how gentle it felt on my body.
- **Really Works**: The changes weren‚Äôt just in my head ‚Äî I had more stamina, clearer thoughts, and even my sleep improved. I started waking up feeling rested instead of groggy.
- **No Side Effects**: Some supplements make my stomach weird or give me headaches. MITOLYN didn‚Äôt do any of that. It just worked.
- **Saves Me Money**: I actually stopped buying other vitamins and energy drinks because MITOLYN did everything I needed. It ended up saving me money in the long run.
- **Trusted by Thousands**: After I started using it, I read even more stories from real people who loved it. That made me feel like I was part of something that really works.

# People Around Me Noticed

The coolest part? Other people started to notice the changes before I did! My family asked if I was doing something different because I was less cranky in the mornings. My friends noticed I was more energetic and focused when we hung out. Even my boss commented on my better focus at work.

I told a couple of friends about MITOLYN and they tried it too ‚Äî and they came back saying, ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you tell me about this sooner?‚Äù It felt good to share something that actually helps.

# Customer Support That Actually Cares

When my second shipment was a little late (thanks to the delivery company, not MITOLYN), I reached out to customer support. They answered me quickly, apologized, and even tracked my package for me. They were friendly and made me feel valued, not just like another order number.

Good customer service is rare these days, so it made me trust MITOLYN even more. They really care about their customers.

# Would I Recommend MITOLYN?

Absolutely! I genuinely believe MITOLYN is worth trying, especially if you‚Äôre tired of feeling tired or foggy all the time. I‚Äôve already told my family, coworkers, and even posted about it on my social media.

If you‚Äôre on the fence, I‚Äôd say go for it. You really have nothing to lose ‚Äî except maybe the fatigue and brain fog you‚Äôre dealing with now.

# Final Thoughts ‚Äì Worth Every Penny

To sum it all up, using MITOLYN has been one of the best choices I‚Äôve made for my health and happiness. I feel more energetic, focused, and just plain better every day. It‚Äôs not magic, but it‚Äôs pretty darn close. 

If you want something simple, safe, and actually effective, MITOLYN is 100% worth it. I‚Äôm so glad I gave it a try, and I‚Äôm sure you will be too.

# The Slow Burn of Fatigue and Hopelessness

Before MITOLYN, I felt like I was stuck in a never-ending fog. I wasn‚Äôt really sick, but I wasn‚Äôt healthy either. Every morning, I‚Äôd wake up feeling just as exhausted as when I went to bed. My body felt heavy, my mind was slow, and I had no drive to do the things I used to enjoy.

I‚Äôd go to the doctor and get the same answer: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fine.‚Äù My blood tests were normal, my thyroid was okay, and my vitamin levels were only a little off. But deep down, I knew something wasn‚Äôt right. I felt like my body was running out of fuel, and every day was harder than the last.

Even simple things‚Äîlike making breakfast or texting a friend‚Äîfelt like climbing a mountain. I was scared I‚Äôd never feel like myself again.

# What Is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is a dietary supplement that‚Äôs all about supporting your mitochondria‚Äîthe tiny engines inside your cells that make energy. As we get older, our mitochondria don‚Äôt work as well, so we start to feel tired, slow, and less focused. MITOLYN is designed to help bring those little engines back to life so you can feel more like yourself again.

The best part? It‚Äôs not just about covering up tiredness. MITOLYN aims to fix the real problem by helping your body make more energy where it counts. I‚Äôd tried lots of ‚Äúenergy boosters‚Äù before, but this was the first one that actually made sense to me.

# Why I Took the Leap

I was nervous to try MITOLYN because nothing else had worked before. Energy drinks made me jittery. Coffee just left me crashing an hour later. But after reading about MITOLYN‚Äôs ingredients‚Äîthings like CoQ10, PQQ, and NAD+ boosters, which actual scientists talk about‚ÄîI thought, ‚ÄúWhy not? I have to try something.‚Äù

People in the reviews talked about feeling sharper, sleeping better, and not getting those awful energy crashes. It sounded too good to be true, but I decided to give it a shot. I ordered a bottle, hoping for even a small improvement.

# Week 1: Subtle But Promising

The first week, I didn‚Äôt turn into a superhero or anything, but something did change. I woke up a little easier in the morning. I didn‚Äôt need to drag myself out of bed, and I didn‚Äôt hit the snooze button over and over.

My afternoons, which used to be the worst, started feeling a bit more manageable. I didn‚Äôt need that extra cup of coffee, and I didn‚Äôt feel so desperate for a nap. It was a small change, but it gave me hope.

# Week 2: Clarity, Focus, Drive

By the second week, everything was clearer‚Äîliterally! I could think straight. I remembered things better and found it easier to finish work and chores. I was finally able to focus on conversations and enjoy reading again.

Instead of just barely getting through the day, I started having energy left over in the evening. I picked up some old hobbies and actually wanted to talk and laugh with my family. Even my friends noticed and asked what I‚Äôd changed.

# Week 3: Energy Like I Had in My 20s

The third week felt like a total transformation. I started going for walks every day because I wanted to move. Cooking dinner didn‚Äôt seem like such a huge task anymore. I even had the energy to play with my dog and do some gentle exercises after work.

This wasn‚Äôt the fake, wired energy I‚Äôd get from caffeine. It felt real, like my body had finally remembered how to make energy again. I was doing more, smiling more, and feeling more confident than I had in years.

# Week 4: Deep Sleep and Radiant Health

By the fourth week, the changes went even deeper. I started sleeping through the night and waking up rested. My skin got a healthy glow, and my stomach felt better after meals.

My mood was more stable, and I didn‚Äôt snap at people like I used to when I was tired and frustrated. I felt balanced, inside and out. It was like my whole body was finally on my side.

# The Ingredients That Make It Work

MITOLYN uses a bunch of powerful ingredients that are all about helping your body make energy:

- **PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone):** Helps your cells grow new, healthy mitochondria.
- **CoQ10:** Supports the energy-making process in your cells.

1k7mxxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1k7mxxz/does_chemex_cm8a_pour_over_coffee_maker_deserve/,Does Chemex CM-8A Pour Over Coffee Maker Deserve Its 4.8 Rating Review?,"The Chemex CM-8A Pour-Over Coffeemaker is an elegant masterpiece I've had the chance to integrate into my coffee-making routine. I‚Äôve always loved the simplicity of preparing a great cup of coffee, and this coffeemaker brings both style and functionality to the table. Its timeless design and sleek borosilicate glass construction make it an eye-catching addition to any kitchen. But don‚Äôt let its beauty fool you‚Äîthis product isn‚Äôt just about looks. For those of us passionate about pour-over brewing, the Chemex CM-8A promises to deliver quality, provided you‚Äôre aware of what you‚Äôre diving into.

**Easy and Appealing Design**  
This coffeemaker stands out with its simple yet sophisticated design. Made from high-quality, non-porous borosilicate glass, it‚Äôs an excellent choice for brewing coffee that‚Äôs free from lingering odors and chemical residues. Believe me, as someone who‚Äôs brewed enough coffee to notice even the faintest aftertaste, this feature is a game-changer. The glass construction not only serves an aesthetic purpose but also ensures durability. The hourglass shape combined with a wooden collar and leather tie provides both functionality and a touch of elegance to your countertop.

[Check Chemex CM-8A price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b000i1wp7w/)

**Brewing Experience with Manual Precision**  
Using the Chemex is like taking a small step back in time to manual coffee brewing. It‚Äôs fully reliant on you, which means there‚Äôs no automation to take over. For someone like me, who loves fiddling with grind size, water temperature, and pouring techniques, it‚Äôs a rewarding process. If you‚Äôre precise with the water-to-coffee ratio and timing, you‚Äôll get a clean, flavorful cup free from unwanted sediment due to the heavy-duty paper filters that this coffeemaker uses. And let‚Äôs talk about capacity; its 8-cup measurement (based on 5 oz. per cup) ensures there‚Äôs enough coffee for bigger breakfasts or mid-afternoon coffee runs.

**Key Benefits**  
- Offers a visually stunning and high-quality glass design.  
- Reflects true coffee flavors thanks to the non-porous material.  
- Allows for full manual control over brewing variables.  
- Perfect for preparing multiple servings in one brew.  

**Some Drawbacks to Consider**  
Manual brewing does require a bit of a learning curve, specifically if you‚Äôre used to the convenience of automatic coffee machines. It‚Äôs enjoyable, but not something suited for rushed mornings or those who don‚Äôt enjoy the process. Another sticking point is the filter‚ÄîChemex‚Äôs bonded filters aren‚Äôt included in the box, so you‚Äôll need to stock up separately. Also, I‚Äôve found the glass can be slippery during cleaning if not handled carefully.  

- Requires Chemex-specific filters, which aren‚Äôt included.  
- Not ideal for those who want a quick, automated experience.  
- Glass construction demands careful handling during use and cleaning.  

**Taste and Coffee Quality**  
Speaking from weeks of daily use, the coffee brewed with this product speaks for itself. The thick bonded filters ensure that no micro-grounds find their way into your cup, resulting in a pure, clean taste. It‚Äôs as if the Chemex is able to enhance the natural notes of your beans. Whether you're using a light roast or a bold dark roast, the extraction remains consistent and smooth, with no hint of bitterness.

**Competing Products in the Market**  
Comparing it with the popular Hario V60, both cater to pour-over enthusiasts but have distinct differences. The Chemex‚Äôs advantage lies in its larger capacity and the fact that it serves as a carafe, making it convenient for sharing coffee with multiple people. The Hario V60, on the other hand, is smaller and better suited for single servings, and while it offers more filter flexibility, it doesn‚Äôt quite match the elegance of the Chemex design. Products like the Kalita Wave add competition by offering flat-bottom filter designs for a more even extraction, but they lack the full-bodied aesthetic that Chemex has mastered.

**Value Proposition**  
Considering its unique aesthetic and brewing capabilities, this coffeemaker gives plenty of bang for your buck. Of course, it‚Äôs priced higher than basic brewing methods, but it‚Äôs a handcrafted coffee experience, not just a tool. If you value taste, design, and precision in brewing, then the slight premium is justified. For budget-conscious users, it may feel a tad indulgent, especially when you factor in the recurring cost of proprietary filters. However, for an everyday coffee ritual that feels special, I‚Äôd argue it‚Äôs worth every penny.

# My Problem Before MITOLYN

Before I tried MITOLYN, I‚Äôll be honest‚ÄîI was worn out. Every day felt like a challenge. I woke up tired, dragged my feet through work and chores, and felt like I was always running on empty. My brain felt foggy, and even simple things like remembering where I put my keys became a struggle. I tried drinking more coffee, eating ‚Äúsuperfoods,‚Äù and even buying expensive vitamins from the store, but nothing really stuck. I felt stuck in a cycle of disappointment.

Then, I heard about MITOLYN. I saw people online talking about how it changed their lives, but I was skeptical. Was this just another trend that would fade away? Still, I was desperate for a change, so I figured, ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù and gave it a shot.

# First Impressions Matter ‚Äì And MITOLYN Nails It

When my MITOLYN package arrived, it immediately felt different from stuff I‚Äôd tried before. The box was sturdy and had a clean, neat design. It didn‚Äôt look cheap or thrown together. Inside, everything was organized‚Äîeach bottle was sealed tight, and the instructions were written clearly in plain English. No confusing words or tiny print that I needed a magnifying glass for.

I liked that it wasn‚Äôt filled with extra fluff or wasteful packaging. Everything about it made me feel like I‚Äôd made a smart choice. The directions were super simple: just take a serving every morning, and that‚Äôs it. None of that ‚Äútake with food, then take again at night, but not too late‚Äù stuff. It actually made me excited to start.

# The Results Were Almost Instant

I know it sounds wild, but after just a few days, I noticed a real difference. Instead of dragging myself out of bed, I woke up before my alarm, feeling refreshed. My mind felt clearer‚ÄîI could focus during meetings, remember things better, and I wasn‚Äôt reaching for my third cup of coffee by noon.

Within the first week, people at work asked if I‚Äôd ‚Äúdone something different‚Äù because I seemed more energetic and positive. My family noticed too‚ÄîI had the energy to play with my kids again and actually wanted to go for walks after dinner instead of collapsing on the couch.

By the end of the month, I had fewer headaches, my stomach felt better, and even my skin looked healthier. I had tried so many things before, but nothing had worked this fast or this well. It was almost like flipping a switch.

# Why MITOLYN Stands Out

There are a lot of products out there that promise big results, but here‚Äôs why MITOLYN is different for me:

- **High-Quality Ingredients:** I checked the label, and MITOLYN uses real, natural stuff‚Äîno weird chemicals or hard-to-pronounce fillers. That gave me peace of mind.
- **Noticeable Results:** The changes weren‚Äôt tiny or just wishful thinking. I genuinely felt better and could see the changes every day.
- **No Weird Side Effects:** Sometimes supplements make me feel jittery or upset my stomach, but with MITOLYN, I felt totally normal‚Äîjust better.
- **Great Value:** Sure, it‚Äôs not the cheapest thing on the shelf, but I actually saved money in the long run. I stopped buying all those extra vitamins and energy drinks because I didn‚Äôt need them anymore.
- **Backed by Real People:** I read a ton of reviews, and it wasn‚Äôt just me‚Äîthousands of people had similar experiences. That made me feel even more confident in my choice.

# People Around Me Noticed

This was maybe the best part: my friends and family started to notice the changes in me. My partner said I seemed happier and less stressed. My coworkers asked what my ‚Äúsecret‚Äù was. Even my kids said I was more fun to be around.

It wasn‚Äôt just about feeling better on the inside‚Äîother people could see it, too. I even inspired a few friends to try MITOLYN themselves, and they noticed the same benefits. It turned into this little circle of people cheering each other on as we all started to feel better together.

# Customer Support That Actually Cares

I had one small hiccup with my first order‚Äîthe tracking number wasn‚Äôt updating, and I got a little nervous. I emailed MITOLYN‚Äôs customer support, expecting a long wait or a canned response. But they got back to me quickly, apologized for the mix-up, and gave me a new tracking number right away. They were friendly, helpful, and made me feel like my order really mattered. That‚Äôs rare, and it made a big difference.

# Would I Recommend MITOLYN?

Definitely‚Äîyes! If you‚Äôre tired of feeling tired, or just want to boost your energy and focus, MITOLYN is absolutely worth trying. I‚Äôve already told my family, my neighbors, my book club‚Äîpretty much anyone who will listen. It‚Äôs not magic, but it‚Äôs the closest thing I‚Äôve found.

# Final Thoughts ‚Äì Worth Every Penny

Looking back on the year I spent using MITOLYN, I have zero regrets. It‚Äôs given me my energy back, helped me stay sharp, and even improved my mood. I spend less time worrying about how tired I feel and more time actually living my life.

I know everyone‚Äôs different, but for me, MITOLYN was a total game changer. If you‚Äôre ready to feel better‚Äîreally better‚Äîgive it a try. Life is too short to feel tired all the time.

Some things that happens to me: When I'm so angry I hurt myself or things like walls or something, and I feel emotions way too much, there was a time that from being ti depressed in hours I went to euphoria and my psychiatrist thought about cyclotimia, but they finally put depressive mayor disorder maybe I had it too, but I always had the other thing, I'm too way scared of being abandoned, i have so easily attachment issues, and I actually relate to things so many bpd felt, as I said.
That's my life if it helps something: 
I was on another school on primary school, I had friends and the school loved me and my parents were better so we moved on the next one I was bullied until I went to Highschool, even teachers bullied me and the school didn't want me. Some day one kid called alejandro came to me and said have you ever considered trying suicide, it would help you and he mentioned the reasons to, I was 7 and I didn't know what suicide was. And when a girl made me write with poop her name. I feel embarassed explaining that. And the girl that made me take off the pants on class. The boys that hit me on the bathroom And when everyone went ruinning from me. And when a teacher hit me too. And I think ""What If I didn't have moved"" I really think I wouldn't be the same I could have been happy, and have a life, just if we hadnt moved. Now I see the pictures of the last school and I see how I really happy was because I know when the laugh was real or not, and in all pictures of the school I was bullied I was smiling for the picture, no feeling or not smiling. They also put ants or flies on my food and the monitors obligated me to eat it, luckily the chef told me to wait until they all are gone and I stay with her and she brought me good things, but sometimes I ate that shit. My parents were not knowing what was happening and they only seen I didn't want to go to school, I literally prefered make something to be physically sick than going at, and they brought me to mental health system,10 years ago, and they didn't sue anyone, they still say it's not that much, it's past and things passed. Things passed, but the girls that bullied me still laugh at me at the street 6 years later they didn't learn anything. I still think I could have been happy, I could have had a life, I could have never needed to live suicide attempt and it's trauma, I can't avoid crying when I think on it. And the worst part is only remember a bit of it, because something I had on diary I didn't remembered or in videos I recorded I lost basically my entire childhood. When I talk about wanting to sue them I don't even care about money, I just want them to have problems, in that case economic ones, the difference is the economic ones you can change them what they did you can't. And also no one cared about me until 4 years ago, I met that ex-boyfriend that abused me I really thought that was loving and caring about someone because I didn't have friends or people to know it wasn't. I really want to take my life. My sisters also hate me because of mental health problems, and they ignore me every day, even if I try to be her good sister. Also my dad when I was on school, used to slap me to learn the things he wanted, he also threatened me with throwing knives or things like that if I continue being like how I'm and he hit me with bottles of water and put me on cold, very cold showers and there was a point he basically was drowning me on water because of things like not done the homework or not liking macaroni, and I was very scared of being with him at home without my mom that I literally tried not to move to not be said anything and when was food I waited without saying something at table 2 hours until mama came home. One day I went to the Police station that was 3 minutes walking by home alone to say what was happening at home because I didn't want that situation and I didn't stand it anymore. They laughed and gave reason to my dad because he said it was a ""little anger of kid"" and they didn't do anything, suddenly he stopped doing it when I started to face it instead of accepting it. I sometimes asked him to say sorry, because It hurt me but he says it's past too, and start from 0, typical Spanish expression that means start like nothing happened, and also they don't want to open the topic, we put that in silence, I also say he put effort on being better dad, but If I'm being real, I apreciate it but the damage is done, it will never be as I always wanted. In that moment my oma (grandma in german) didn't also wanted me and put me apart of her and my grandpa passed away on 2017 he was my only support the only person on my childhood i really felt loved by, after he died everything got worse, the same with oma, that has tried to get better, it won't change like it could have been because now she has health problems, and at the end of the day, I think she only realised who loves her because everyone got older and the persons that love to see her are me, my cousin and my aunt, another cousin loves her but I think not that muchTo my oma in certain point I'm better with her because I can talk to her about mental health problems without being judged because she had them too, but it's still certainly distant. And my mom just got more into herself with years, before she cared about me and my problems, after she didn't care but hide it and now don't care and she didn't even try to hice it. In some point I think I was better at home than a foster care because I know so many people there that has lived worse things than me in there but it definetly would helped having someone, having gone to familiar therapy or something, but now all it's done. Being honest when I explain all shit It's difficult to think how I didn't kill myself before, I'm not saying like at 14 yo, or 12, no, at 7 for example. And there's still a lot of more things that I didn't mention there. I really think life is ruined and there's no turning back, I can forget for a time about it and be happy some day but I really think to be happy only 3 months on 17 years, it's not worth. And now the teachers don't talk to me because the don't want to be involved on suicide or something because I took voluntary discharge, and they don't want me to come back. Another part of my life failing apart. For me class was the best part of the day in 3r and 4t (2 time, when I repeated) and I hated weekends because of that, and when I was so depressed It also helped me to do something in the day. In some part when I look it like a 3rd person it feels unreal, like there's no way that has been my life, because it doesn't seem like one, and I really disociate frequently and I create good realities that never existes, but sadly I'm 100% concerned they are not real. When I started Highschool I was excited of but not because it was happy, because it meant the pain in school was finally finished, my first class was 1E and the group also laughed at me and made me feel outside but at least was only laughing at me not like I lived in school, when I saw the typical class disturbers were respected I started to annoy teachers and don't giving a fck about highschool and grades, and in that moment I also wasn't interested or felt well by things, that year was the pandemia, we all got at home, before confinating I was gonna change the attitude because I was worried about my grades and I didn't want to be that person, but we got home so I started to be at tiktok with my Chromebook and roblox with the cousin I currently don't have a good relation and I never had before, I started to look at my body and feel bad about my weight, I had a lot of anxiety at that point and I started to eat maybe 3000kcals at day, that made me get fat and when I returned in 2A, by the way we changed classes and I started to feel I was part of the group, some teachers without wanting me to feel bad basically noticed how much weight I gained, I was missing classes, but I didn't express depression, in summer before 3A, I fall into anorexia, I started to restrict and fast, and when we started I was doing things like cutting myself because I couldn't handle it anymore, adding that I never said before to my psychologist how bad I was, one boy filtered things about masturbation that were false but for the first time, he got expulsed and Highschool defended me, by the way here I started to talk with a guy on instagram, the first person thay seemed to be my friend, in Highschool started to notice I was coming so much late than before, if we started at 8, before I came at 9 or before and after at 10 or later, and also noticed cut scars, so they said it to mental health system, I finally talked about my feelings and she got worried,she wanted to derivate me to the hospital cl√≠nic to psychward to be treated for anorexia in december 2021, they gave me the change to decide if I wanted or not because I was not underweight yet, the psychologist got worried about not getting treatment so she sent me to day hospital on hospital del mar and there as it was not mandatory, they at start didn't obligated me to eat, just to go to therapy. In december 2021 I had my first suicide attempt. In February 2022 also I had studied for the first time since primary school for biology exam, almost all teachers had me as a lost student case, but the biology teacher believed me and helped me on the exam, I got a 10, that 10 was all I needed to learn that effort is worth, and I started studying everything I wanted of biology and I was so applied and that would spread for so many subjects, In march of 2022 they started to obligate me to eat because I was bad and I ate not because I wanted recovery, just because I wanted to not be inpatient on hospital clinic so I ate but thinking as soon as get out of here I return to the same, without telling them, on that moment I was running to arrive to Highschool when I finished eating to see that person, here I was too anemic, I fainted so much and the articulations and bones hurt and all anorexia is. I already had attachment issues to the guy and we literally can send 1000 messages a day, I didn't know, but he was doing lovebombing because he was narcissistic, and I also felt loved by first time by my girl chemistry teacher and we talked by Gmail so much and she helped me to be up to things, summer arrived and I didn't want because I really hated to not be at Highschool, and they discharged me from day hospital and I went back to anorexia. I forget to mention that I started to pass days not sleeping and also I spent afternoons burning calories. In July while I was in a hotel the guy and me started to date. I passed summer basically depressed. I met him on real life in August 2022 and I think there was the last time he ""cared"", we started school and I went to 4A class, classes changed a bit, and I felt so bad at that point, I tried to recover on anorexia but at these point was too late, it wasn't as easy as it could have been if I had took seriously the recovery at first time, now it was something more like I recover for x months and I will turn back, I started to miss days to school and I started to think daily about suicide, they put me on a program that psychiatrist and psychologist visits were frequently and I started to take medication because I was so so depressed in december 2022, it didn't worked and I also tried with other that it didn't worked. In day hospital I also had tried others 2. I went to spent xmas with the guy at his home and he was asking for having sex almost everyday and didn't really seemed to care, he left me on seen and he only did like he cared in real life, we continued seeing more each other and the next quarter I realised if I didn't pass, I was gonna repeat, I put all my efforts and I didn't pass a lot and I passed 2 or 3 with 6 like more and I also went to recover subjects I didn't do the last year because of going to therapy and some teachers aproved me because of my mental state, when it was April, on holy week, I realised that I wasn't gonna pass, so I started to focus on improve my depression and I went to spend 2 weeks with that guy too in his home, I realised that he started to copy depression I had and literally copying the standard depression, he started to take medication, with ONE visit with reference doctor, and he started to excuse he didn't write because of his depression when I was literally putting a lot of effort on that, I barely could stay awake, I was SO SO sleepy, he also went to parties and with other people talked literally everyday and a lot of things, one day in June of 2023 I was tired and that he used blocking and unblocking to make me more attached and making me feel guilty, and he said, ""I want to disappear"" and I said ""Disappear then, do whatever you want"", two hours later he write me on hospital saying he tried suicide because I said him to try suicide, and he said me a big, very big quantity of pills, and also passed me the inform of psychiatrist, the things that he said to me didn't match at all what the psychiatrist wrote, the quantity if pills either, was literally 3 of them like much, and he said that I did him try to commit suicide and he said I was so toxic and I only made him suffer, and blocked me but this time for ever, the next week I went into hotel, I remembered crying every moment and feeling a lot of anxiety, by the way the night he blocked me his friend was up to our situation and seemed how bad he was with me and basically saved me from trying suicide, helped me to listen the next days, when I was going home after the hotel a guy we were distant friends I met on tenis in November 2022 that I left for depression the tennis, wrote me and we started to meet more, I went to beach with him and after asked me to be my boyfriend, I said yes, a think that seemed weird to me is the fact he didn't want sex never insisted to me to have and prefered being on bed hugged, and prefered do memorable things, by the way, as soon as the first exboyfriend left me, depression improved, and btw, he manipulated me a lot, also was getting out with a girl being 11yo. 30 of august of 2023 I tried to commit suicide again (I also tried so many times but are not like so important dates) and I went to hospital cl√≠nic and there I said was without thinking and they let me out, he left me days later because didn't want to be with mental health problems And we were gonna start class, I did too well classes, I had good grades, that year the chemistry teacher left but we continued talking by Gmail, but In November I wanted to go back to anorexia, I did it and the next quarter grades started to went down (important to remind that this year I repeated I was on 4B in totally different class and I could repeat more, if I didn't pass I would go to mandatory adult school) so I started to be worried, by March 2024 I was sick and I decided to recover and I studied by my own the human metabolism with university archives, here I had been happy from October 2023 to February 2024, after that I started to decline, I really didn't see myself without anorexia but I centered myself on class and the final quarter I was just only memorising and I passed and I graduated from mandatory stage. In summer we went to Madrid and I relapsed on anorexia again, I passed all summer on that and when we started class, I wanted to kill myself, I could handle all that, because I also started to be more conscious about past. I had been 1 year suicide attempts free, I started to see how I wasn't able to go to class, how I had worse grades and see it not possible, the day 3 of November I wrote suicide note crying because I didn't want to die but I couldn't anymore and the day 4 of November I put the psychiatric pills on my bag and I was planning to attempt after saying everyone I loved Goodbye but I couldn't wait in the bathroom I took the pills I started to feel so bad, vomiting and have a really high pressure and all symptoms of overdosing and I felt asleep, and they called 112 and I went to hospital del mar, I woke up and the psychiatrist asked me and she didn't care and they sent me to hospital cl√≠nic, the next day they put me on psychward and I was there for 1 month and a half, I asked them to pass xmas there because I knew at home was gonna be worse and I was gonna relapse on ana and I wanted help, they said no and discharged me, I started again hospital cl√≠nic day hospital, by the way I had been before on March2023-december2023, and I went to visits on 8 of January, I tried another pills didn't worked either, and at 28 of January I realised I was on shit again and I attempted suicide again, I called 112 because I was chickened out to die and they brought me to sant joan de deu hospital, and there they cared and translated me to hospital clinic and there I said I won't do anything in the next 24h because the next day I had a visit with my psychiatrist and there I told her I was okay but 3 of February I attempted again, in that moment my mom called 112 because I was desoriented and bad, too bad, they directly brought me to hospital cl√≠nic and there they told me the next day I was gonna be in patient because it's not normal to attempt 2 times on a week, I was there but that time without desire to get better and only getting put for relapsing on 50kcals a day again, they said me after 1 month and a half I could took voluntary discharge or going to long term psychward and I chose voluntary discharge, I got out, the next days I went home and I felt the same as I entered, after I decided to do things to see if I get better but I didn't get better, I decided turn back to anorexia and everything got worse, I felt more depressed and also I went back to cut myself. I also used to drink 20 coffees q day and in general I abused caffeine, now I use maybe 4 on a day and I use don't sleeping and abusing coffee to feel drugged and well and I sleep so much to avoid reality.

If you can tell me or ask about experiencies you think you have to have lived to have bpd you can ask and I reply. And I would apreciate if someone says me how to tell all this to my psychiatrist in 5 days.",1,1745592816.0,BPDJourney,0,1.0,False

I told him I wasn't interested in dating at this time but sure, we could be friends. since then I did always have his expectations in mind though plus I got busy again so we didn't really hang out anymore. the week after he told me to just forget his confession and to just stay friends and after that we barely even spoke anymore.

one situation I personally would a bit weird was how some time after that he messaged me asking me if I could lend him a suitcase. I told him the one I have would be too small for what he asked for and he asked me to maybe bring one from my family's home and I told him I'd check but I wouldn't be there for the next two weeks. he then kept repeating how I should check there and bring one for him and I told him I'll check next time I'm there and then he just said ""finally you get it"" and like I got it from the beginning, I just told him it won't happen as quickly as he wanted it to.

anyway, he's not from my country but he studies here and yesterday he approached me telling me how he's having a hard time because the language class clashes with another class he has to take but he needs a certain level until the end of the semester and if I couldn't meet with him once a week to practise for 15-30 minutes. I said sure and that we'd talk about the specific time. I then left for the rest of the day and was too exhausted to plan anything when I got home, especially since the earliest I'd do this would be Monday anyways. yesterday he sent me one message telling me he depends on me to find 30 minutes per week for him and called me by my name. and today he kept texting me which is okay, I understand he's stressed but I had classes the entire day and left to go home for the weekend immediately. he said if I can't make it to let him know so he can look for someone else and how he will never forget this from me. what bothered me though is how he just randomly sent me two messages writing my name but incorrectly. 

it might be petty but he knows how to write my name, it's on my account and I don't know what his intentions are with that. i don't know, I don't feel too well anymore about the idea. he didn't do anything wrong per se but I don't know I just feel off and stressed every time I interact with him.. I'm considering just telling him one time slot in between my classes where I wouldn't have anything to do anyways and if that doesn't work to tell him he should look for someone else but I feel kinda bad doing that. but that's the only time slot in between classes I know I'll be free every week so it's the least stressful for me.

1k7mv1t,https://www.reddit.com/r/PetiteFitness/comments/1k7mv1t/help_im_feeling_so_defeated/,Help - I'm feeling so defeated.,"I genuinely don't know what to do at this point. 

I am a 39 year old female, 5'1, 110.4lbs. My entire life until about 5-6 years ago, I was 95-98lbs, no matter how much I ate. I never exercised, the weight just didn't accumulate. As I've gotten older I've gained weight, and have started dieting in the last few months. I don't feel the need to be 95lbs again, but I'd like to at least get rid of things like my thighs rubbing together when I walk, etc. 

I am eating between 350-400 calorie deficit per day based off my TDEE, with the exception of the weekends when I have a nice dinner out on Friday nights (hence why I weigh myself Friday mornings - to give myself time to recover before the next weigh in so I don't beat myself up). Nothing crazy - still usually a healthful meal, but I usually eat something like +500 calories those days. I try to eat somewhat healthy things - chicken/fish/seafood, quinoa, veggies, chicken/turkey sausage, etc. I avoid high sodium foods mostly, but do succumb to a canned soup here and there when I'm short on time.

I have been trying to move more; no formal exercise because I simply don't have the extra hour in my day, but I've been walking more and such; living in a big city allows me to opt to walk for errands vs. drive. I am getting a good amount of fiber, and while I'm not drinking as much water as I should, I'm drinking about 50oz a day. I don't drink coffee. I only drink alcohol during my ""cheat meal"", 1-2 times per week, and never more than 1-2 drinks (usually a dry wine). 

I weighed myself two weeks ago, and I was 110.6. Last week, I had my period, and didn't get on the scale (no one wants that problem). My period has been over for 4-5 days now. Today, after two weeks straight of this routine, I was 110.4. How is it humanly possible that I've only lost .2lbs in two weeks on this diet? I'm losing my mind and I feel like I'm going to cry. I'm not sure I CAN do more than this - my schedule with work is super hectic, so going to the gym isn't feasible right now, and I'm certainly not going to eat even LESS food. 

This feels impossible. Is this just how I'm destined to be now? I don't hate how I look, but I miss my old self and want my clothes to fit again. I've been trying SO hard to be good - saying no to all of the bad stuff I see other people eat around me. I've been SO proud of my self control.  And it's been for nothing. 

Any advice is appreciated. I'm feeling so hopeless at this point. Thanks for reading all this mess. ",0,1745592663.0,PetiteFitness,35,0.4,False

Let me know if you need the complete link!

""I won't marry him! No matter what, I'm not gonna marry him,"" Eliza Lane wailed, her voice tearing through the room as she held a fruit knife against her neck.

Ten feet away, her biological mother, Violet Thornton, was pacing back and forth, wanting to persuade Eliza to marry but terrified of pushing her into really hurting herself.

Unable to approach, she could only soothe Eliza anxiously and cautiously, ""Alright, alright... If you don't want to marry him, then don't. I'll cancel the engagement right away... Eliza, please don't do anything rash...""

Eliza's biological father, Clay Thornton, angrily shouted at Violet, ""What did you say? The Brooks family gave us 30 million dollars as engagement gifts. Don't you know our company's situation? This isn't up to her!""

Clay's words made Violet furious; she was like a shrew, lunged at his face. ""Eliza has suffered for twenty-three years. We just found her not long ago. How can you bear to make her marry a vegetable? She's your flesh and blood; how can you be so cruel? You're heartless!""

Clay caught Violet's hand before it could reach his face and pushed her onto the couch. ""How am I heartless? If our company goes bankrupt, will you and Eliza have an easy life? You won't be able to keep living a high life.""

Clay thought about the company's current state, watching the chaos at home, and he felt extremely irritated. He added, ""Carl is a vegetable, but once Eliza marries him, his family won't just stand by while our company goes under, right?""

Hearing that, Violet's mind cleared a bit. She couldn't bear losing her luxurious lifestyle but was also afraid Eliza might really hurt herself. ""So... What should we do? Should we really let Eliza spend her life taking care of a vegetable...""

Eliza was the biological daughter of the Thornton couple, but twenty-three years ago, they had mistaken another baby girl for their own. Eliza had suffered a lot because of this and had only recently been found and returned to the Thornton family. Violet wanted to make it up to her and basically gave in to all her requests.

Hearing her mother's sudden hesitation, Eliza screamed in fright, ""I won't marry him. I'll marry him over my dead body!""

Violet was startled. ""Don't do anything rash, Eliza. Calm down, please...""

Then, Eliza suddenly thought of something and said, ""Edie... Let Edie marry him. You raised her for twenty-three years. Let her take my place and marry Carl as a way to repay your upbringing.""

Violet suddenly came to her senses. ""Right... There's Edie! The Brooks family didn't specify who had to marry Carl; let Edie marry him!""

Edie Thornton, the girl whom the Thornton couple had mistaken for their biological daughter twenty-three years ago.

At the thought of her, Clay's face turned very troubled. He hesitated, ""But...""

Before he could finish, a voice appeared at the entrance of the Thornton family villa. ""Thank you to all the media reporters for coming to the press conference...

""We have found our biological daughter, who has suffered greatly... Having raised Edie for twenty-three years, we have done our duty. From now on, Edie is no longer a member of the Thornton family and has nothing to do with us‚Äî""

At the entrance of the Thornton family villa, Edie paused the video on her phone, a cold and sarcastic smile playing on her lips.

She said, ""Don't forget, you said it yourself that I have nothing to do with you anymore. And it was Eliza who insisted on marrying Carl in the first place.""

This press conference was announced half a month ago. The Thornton family acknowledged Eliza and severed ties with Edie. The bride for the Brooks family's engagement was changed to Eliza, and now everyone knew about it.

As it turned out, on the day of the press conference, Carl Brooks, the powerful head of the Brooks family in Clerlun, had an accident and became a vegetable. -\^=The Brooks family wanted to bring good luck to Carl and asked the Thornton family to fulfill their engagement contract immediately, but Eliza refused to comply at all costs.

In her heart, Edie scoffed, 'You were so decisive when severing ties with me, now you want my help? What a joke!'

# Chapter 2 The Engagement Gift

Violet was too ashamed to meet Edie's gaze. ""Eliza has suffered so much. Why can't you help? Besides, Carl is a prominent figure in Clerlun...""

Though she spoke with a tone of righteousness, her hesitant voice betrayed a lack of conviction.

However, having Edie marry in Eliza's place was indeed the best option for their family at the moment.

Edie slightly lifted her eyelids to look at Violet. ""I have a boyfriend. Since Carl is such a prominent figure, why don't you let Eliza marry him and enjoy the wealth?""

Eliza was on the verge of tears. ""Edie... the idea of you marrying in my place was actually from Sebastian. Besides, since you two aren't public about your relationship, no one will know you have a boyfriend.""

Sebastian Vasquez, Edie's boyfriend.

Coincidentally, Eliza had once saved Sebastian's life, and that was how they met, forming a close bond. Sebastian even played a part in Eliza's successful return to her biological parents.

At that time, Sebastian and Eliza were having a meal together when Violet accidentally saw them. She noticed how much Eliza resembled her and secretly conducted a paternity test, which led to the revelation of the hospital's baby-switching incident.

Edie responded coldly, ""He really said that?""

Eliza quickly nodded. ""Yes, he said that since you're just marrying Carl to bring his change of luck, if Carl wakes up and wants a divorce, you can still be with him.""

Eliza, fearful that Edie would refuse, added, ""Sebastian will compensate you.""

Edie paused for a moment before speaking. ""No need for compensation. I'll just break up with him. I can take over the engagement with the Brooks family, but I want to know what happened to my kid.""

She and Sebastian had been together for over a year, and despite having feelings for him, she was disappointed that he would give her up for Eliza.

The kid and the mysterious man from the past remained a thorn in Edie's heart.

If it weren't for being drugged, she wouldn't have...

Upon hearing Edie's request, Clay slammed the table in anger. ""She is dead! With that huge fire, how could she have survived?""

Clay's outburst was quite intimidating, even startling Violet.

Yet, Edie didn't flinch. Her tone was calm but tinged with threat as she said, ""Either tell me the truth about that year, or let Eliza marry into the Brooks family, or face bankruptcy.""

Edie placed the Thornton family's villa key on the coffee table and, facing the furious Clay, maintained an attitude of polite decorum. ""I'll go pack my things. It'll take about half an hour. I hope you've made a decision by the time I leave.""

With that, she turned to walk upstairs, pausing briefly beside Eliza, who was holding a knife to her neck.

Edie then extended her slender, long finger and lightly pointed to a spot on Eliza's neck. She warned, ""The carotid artery is here. Cutting here will kill you quickly. The area you're pressing is the trachea. The usual cause of death if you cut there is suffocation due to blocked respiratory tracts or pulmonary congestion, which is more painful.""

She seemed genuinely concerned for Eliza.

Edie's grace and composure were exceptional, even in this situation, making Eliza, who grew up in the bustling city, feel inferior and deeply embarrassed.

Half an hour later, Edie came downstairs with her belongings packed.

Unable to bear it any longer, Clay told Edie, ""The kid is truly dead. With that massive fire at the hospital, how could anyone survive?""

""The Thorntons are clear-headed enough at this critical moment. They have no reason to hide anything from me. It seems they really don't know anything,"" Edie thought, preparing herself mentally.

She stated, ""I can marry in Eliza's place, but I want half of the 30 million dollars from the Brooks family.""

Clay had an unhappy look. ""You're asking for too much!""

Edie replied nonchalantly, ""Then choose between bankruptcy and Eliza marrying a vegetable.""

With that, she picked up her suitcase and prepared to leave.

""Wait!"" Clay suddenly called out to her, his face dark with anger. ""Fine, I'll give you half.""

Edie gave a cold smile. ""Alright.""

# Chapter 3 The Girl With An Agenda

Even if 15 million dollars were given to Edie, the remaining 15 million dollars would still be enough for the Thornton family's company to weather this difficult time. Besides, the Thornton family would be in-laws of the Brooks family, which was definitely not a loss.

One should have principles in dealings, so the next day, Edie took her luggage and went to the Brooks family on her own.

For the Brooks family, this marriage was just to bring some good luck to Carl, and it didn't matter whether the bride was Eliza or Edie.

However, in a way, they still thought Edie was better. After all, her appearance and demeanor were there for all to see. There was no doubt she was quite charming.

A group of people was in Carl's room, signing contracts with Edie. Carl was surrounded by a bunch of medical equipment, lying in bed completely unaware.

""This is the marriage agreement...""

""And this is the property division agreement...""

Edie signed the agreements without hesitation, the pen in her hand moving swiftly.

The lawyer explained the terms to Edie, ""Mr. Fabian Brooks will give you a black card later; you can use it freely. As for the property agreement, even after a divorce, you'll still have 50% of Mr. Carl Brooks's private property.""

After signing the contracts, Fabian Brooks, Carl's father, said, ""You're now a member of the Brooks family. We'll hold a wedding feast in a few days to celebrate. Carl really needs your care.""

Edie nodded. ""It's my duty, Mr. Brooks.""

Fabian was quite satisfied with Edie. ""Still address me so formally?""

Edie quickly changed her address. ""Alright, Fabian.""

Seeing that Edie had no reluctance in her attitude, Fabian softened his stance. ""I feel at ease knowing you'll look after him.""

Indeed, he could rest assured. After all, it was Edie who had performed Carl's surgery.

Regardless of whether Carl could hear or not, Fabian said to him, ""This is Edie. She'll be your wife from now on.""

Carl lay motionless on the bed.

After Edie saw the group out of the room, the butler Drogo Macy came in again. He approached Carl, who was lying in bed, trying to help him sit up.

""Let me help,"" Edie said.

Drogo declined her offer. ""Thank you. But I'm taking him for a bath.""

""I'll do it. I'm his wife now; I should help him,"" Edie insisted.

Drogo didn't want to argue with Edie over it and backed off.

Edie got a black card and 50% of the private property of the wealthiest man in Clerlun. She felt a bit smug inside. 'This is truly a windfall.'

She was very satisfied because Carl was a vegetable, which saved her a lot of trouble. He could give her money, wouldn't nitpick at her, and was also good-looking.

As soon as Drogo closed the door, Edie looked at Carl's peaceful and handsome face in bed and murmured, ""Your family is really generous.""

Carl had been lying in bed for half a month without knowing when he regained consciousness.

He could hear the sounds around him and naturally knew that his family had got him a wife to bring his change of luck.

Even though he had not deliberately tried to find out about Edie, they both moved in the same upper-class circles and had unintentionally attended the same parties or heard each other's names at certain social events.

Carl only knew that Edie was very smart; she was a 21-year-old medical doctor, the youngest director at a tertiary hospital in the city and a genius in the medical field adored by many; she was completely different from most rich heirs who only knew how to enjoy themselves.

The first impression Carl had of Edie was when she said, ""Your family is really generous,"" by his bedside in a laughing voice.

He thought she was greedy and scheming. 'She must have racked her brains to marry me for my money. Now that I'm a vegetable and can't refuse the engagement, she's seized the opportunity. And it seems she even has a boyfriend.'

He thought gloomily in his heart, 'Who is her boyfriend? He's such an unlucky man to have taken an interest in her and got played by her. See, as soon as she got the chance, she married me.

'Well, fine. At least I'm the best among her targets.'

# Chapter 4 The Best Actor Boyfriend

Edie had no idea what Carl was thinking. She lifted the blanket off him, helped him from the bed to his wheelchair, and then moved him to the bathtub.

Carl was a tall man, and for Edie, he was heavy. Just these few actions left her panting.

She knelt on the ground, leaning half her body on Carl as she caught her breath. ""This is exhausting me.""

But then she thought about not only the money but also getting such a desirable husband, and she quickly regained her energy. She pinched his chiseled face and laughed. ""Okay, I'll let it slide since you're so adorable.""

Hot guys were always adorable.

Edie's breath tickled Carl's neck, and he let out a cold laugh in his mind, 'She's just after my money.'

It was not until Edie started undressing him that he remembered she was there to bathe him.

Carl cursed Drogo several times in his mind for taking money but not doing his job. 'Drogo, you just wait! When I wake up, I'm docking your salary by a month.'

Edie stripped Carl naked, filled the bathtub with water, and went about her work with professional ease. She even chuckled while washing him. ""It's so big.""

Carl was speechless. 'Not only is she greedy and scheming, but she's also flirtatious.'

Edie didn't notice that Carl's right hand fingers, submerged in water, twitched rapidly in anger.

It was almost unnoticeably; or else, with Edie's professionalism, she would have reacted immediately‚Äîthis could be a sign of consciousness in a vegetative state patient.

Considering they were now legally married, Edie felt completely at ease while bathing Carl, not feeling awkward at all.

Even though she had touched every part of his body, Carl had to admit that Edie was impeccable in her profession. 'With her taking care of me, it really increases my chances of recovery.'

He gritted his teeth. 'Alright, I'll bear with it for now. We'll settle accounts when I wake up. 50% of my private property? No way; you won't get a cent after the divorce.'

\*\*\*\*\*

After dealing with the Brooks family matters, Edie returned to the hospital and continued her work.

By the time she got off work, it was already past nine o'clock.

She still had a message from her boyfriend Sebastian from last night, suggesting they needed a talk.

Edie and Sebastian had been dating for over a year. She knew where Sebastian's studio was and drove straight there.

Sebastian, the mega-famous best actor.

Sebastian was always in the headlines, and although rumors about his love life never ended, none of them had ever been confirmed.

Edie walked into Sebastian's studio. Assistant Ebenezer Ray was guarding the outside. Upon seeing Edie, he quickly stood up in front of her, his guilty demeanor unconcealed. He stammered, ""M-Ms. Thornton... What brings you here?""

Edie took another few steps forward and heard some ambiguous moans coming from the lounge. She let out a cold laugh. ""Am I interrupting something?""

Ebenezer looked embarrassed and did not dare to respond.

However, the conversation coming from the two people in the lounge who were indulging in each other had already made it unnecessary for Ebenezer to explain anything to Edie.

""Sebastian, thank you so much. If it weren't for you, I would have had to serve that vegetative state guy for the rest of my life.""

""No problem. The engagement was supposed to be Edie's in the first place.""

Eliza said as she acted cute, ""My parents forced me into the engagement with Carl to connect with the Brooks family. My heart has always belonged to you. You won't blame me, will you?""

""Of course not. I know you had your difficulties. I feel sorry for you.""

""I knew you would be best to me."" Eliza smiled.

""Say something sweet to me.""

""Let's do it again, Sebastian.""

Edie waited patiently for them to finish once, but she didn't have much time for their second-time sex.

Before she could quickly head to the lounge, Ebenezer tried to stop her. ""Ms. Thornton, you...""

Edie patted his shoulder: ""I'm here to catch the best actor cheating. Don't block my way. Decide whether you want to save some dignity for Sebastian or plan tomorrow's trending search in advance. How does the title 'The best actor caught in adultery' sound?""

Ebenezer knew Edie was capable of doing such a thing and cowered, not daring to stop her anymore.

Edie started recording with her phone, kicked open the lounge door, and after the screams from inside, slightly tilted her head, revealing her smiling face from behind the phone. She said gently, ""Hey, our best stars, do you want to strike a more photogenic pose?""

""I won't marry him! No matter what, I'm not gonna marry him,"" Eliza Lane wailed, her voice tearing through the room as she held a fruit knife against her neck.

Ten feet away, her biological mother, Violet Thornton, was pacing back and forth, wanting to persuade Eliza to marry but terrified of pushing her into really hurting herself.

Unable to approach, she could only soothe Eliza anxiously and cautiously, ""Alright, alright... If you don't want to marry him, then don't. I'll cancel the engagement right away... Eliza, please don't do anything rash...""

Eliza's biological father, Clay Thornton, angrily shouted at Violet, ""What did you say? The Brooks family gave us 30 million dollars as engagement gifts. Don't you know our company's situation? This isn't up to her!""

Clay's words made Violet furious; she was like a shrew, lunged at his face. ""Eliza has suffered for twenty-three years. We just found her not long ago. How can you bear to make her marry a vegetable? She's your flesh and blood; how can you be so cruel? You're heartless!""

Clay caught Violet's hand before it could reach his face and pushed her onto the couch. ""How am I heartless? If our company goes bankrupt, will you and Eliza have an easy life? You won't be able to keep living a high life.""

Clay thought about the company's current state, watching the chaos at home, and he felt extremely irritated. He added, ""Carl is a vegetable, but once Eliza marries him, his family won't just stand by while our company goes under, right?""

Hearing that, Violet's mind cleared a bit. She couldn't bear losing her luxurious lifestyle but was also afraid Eliza might really hurt herself. ""So... What should we do? Should we really let Eliza spend her life taking care of a vegetable...""

Eliza was the biological daughter of the Thornton couple, but twenty-three years ago, they had mistaken another baby girl for their own. Eliza had suffered a lot because of this and had only recently been found and returned to the Thornton family. Violet wanted to make it up to her and basically gave in to all her requests.

Hearing her mother's sudden hesitation, Eliza screamed in fright, ""I won't marry him. I'll marry him over my dead body!""

Violet was startled. ""Don't do anything rash, Eliza. Calm down, please...""

Then, Eliza suddenly thought of something and said, ""Edie... Let Edie marry him. You raised her for twenty-three years. Let her take my place and marry Carl as a way to repay your upbringing.""

Violet suddenly came to her senses. ""Right... There's Edie! The Brooks family didn't specify who had to marry Carl; let Edie marry him!""

Edie Thornton, the girl whom the Thornton couple had mistaken for their biological daughter twenty-three years ago.

At the thought of her, Clay's face turned very troubled. He hesitated, ""But...""

Before he could finish, a voice appeared at the entrance of the Thornton family villa. ""Thank you to all the media reporters for coming to the press conference...

""We have found our biological daughter, who has suffered greatly... Having raised Edie for twenty-three years, we have done our duty. From now on, Edie is no longer a member of the Thornton family and has nothing to do with us‚Äî""

At the entrance of the Thornton family villa, Edie paused the video on her phone, a cold and sarcastic smile playing on her lips.

She said, ""Don't forget, you said it yourself that I have nothing to do with you anymore. And it was Eliza who insisted on marrying Carl in the first place.""

This press conference was announced half a month ago. The Thornton family acknowledged Eliza and severed ties with Edie. The bride for the Brooks family's engagement was changed to Eliza, and now everyone knew about it.

As it turned out, on the day of the press conference, Carl Brooks, the powerful head of the Brooks family in Clerlun, had an accident and became a vegetable. -\^=The Brooks family wanted to bring good luck to Carl and asked the Thornton family to fulfill their engagement contract immediately, but Eliza refused to comply at all costs.

In her heart, Edie scoffed, 'You were so decisive when severing ties with me, now you want my help? What a joke!'

# Chapter 2 The Engagement Gift

Violet was too ashamed to meet Edie's gaze. ""Eliza has suffered so much. Why can't you help? Besides, Carl is a prominent figure in Clerlun...""

Though she spoke with a tone of righteousness, her hesitant voice betrayed a lack of conviction.

However, having Edie marry in Eliza's place was indeed the best option for their family at the moment.

Edie slightly lifted her eyelids to look at Violet. ""I have a boyfriend. Since Carl is such a prominent figure, why don't you let Eliza marry him and enjoy the wealth?""

Eliza was on the verge of tears. ""Edie... the idea of you marrying in my place was actually from Sebastian. Besides, since you two aren't public about your relationship, no one will know you have a boyfriend.""

Sebastian Vasquez, Edie's boyfriend.

Coincidentally, Eliza had once saved Sebastian's life, and that was how they met, forming a close bond. Sebastian even played a part in Eliza's successful return to her biological parents.

At that time, Sebastian and Eliza were having a meal together when Violet accidentally saw them. She noticed how much Eliza resembled her and secretly conducted a paternity test, which led to the revelation of the hospital's baby-switching incident.

Edie responded coldly, ""He really said that?""

Eliza quickly nodded. ""Yes, he said that since you're just marrying Carl to bring his change of luck, if Carl wakes up and wants a divorce, you can still be with him.""

Eliza, fearful that Edie would refuse, added, ""Sebastian will compensate you.""

Edie paused for a moment before speaking. ""No need for compensation. I'll just break up with him. I can take over the engagement with the Brooks family, but I want to know what happened to my kid.""

She and Sebastian had been together for over a year, and despite having feelings for him, she was disappointed that he would give her up for Eliza.

The kid and the mysterious man from the past remained a thorn in Edie's heart.

If it weren't for being drugged, she wouldn't have...

Upon hearing Edie's request, Clay slammed the table in anger. ""She is dead! With that huge fire, how could she have survived?""

Clay's outburst was quite intimidating, even startling Violet.

Yet, Edie didn't flinch. Her tone was calm but tinged with threat as she said, ""Either tell me the truth about that year, or let Eliza marry into the Brooks family, or face bankruptcy.""

Edie placed the Thornton family's villa key on the coffee table and, facing the furious Clay, maintained an attitude of polite decorum. ""I'll go pack my things. It'll take about half an hour. I hope you've made a decision by the time I leave.""

With that, she turned to walk upstairs, pausing briefly beside Eliza, who was holding a knife to her neck.

Edie then extended her slender, long finger and lightly pointed to a spot on Eliza's neck. She warned, ""The carotid artery is here. Cutting here will kill you quickly. The area you're pressing is the trachea. The usual cause of death if you cut there is suffocation due to blocked respiratory tracts or pulmonary congestion, which is more painful.""

She seemed genuinely concerned for Eliza.

Edie's grace and composure were exceptional, even in this situation, making Eliza, who grew up in the bustling city, feel inferior and deeply embarrassed.

Half an hour later, Edie came downstairs with her belongings packed.

Unable to bear it any longer, Clay told Edie, ""The kid is truly dead. With that massive fire at the hospital, how could anyone survive?""

""The Thorntons are clear-headed enough at this critical moment. They have no reason to hide anything from me. It seems they really don't know anything,"" Edie thought, preparing herself mentally.

She stated, ""I can marry in Eliza's place, but I want half of the 30 million dollars from the Brooks family.""

Clay had an unhappy look. ""You're asking for too much!""

Edie replied nonchalantly, ""Then choose between bankruptcy and Eliza marrying a vegetable.""

With that, she picked up her suitcase and prepared to leave.

""Wait!"" Clay suddenly called out to her, his face dark with anger. ""Fine, I'll give you half.""

Edie gave a cold smile. ""Alright.""

# Chapter 3 The Girl With An Agenda

Even if 15 million dollars were given to Edie, the remaining 15 million dollars would still be enough for the Thornton family's company to weather this difficult time. Besides, the Thornton family would be in-laws of the Brooks family, which was definitely not a loss.

One should have principles in dealings, so the next day, Edie took her luggage and went to the Brooks family on her own.

For the Brooks family, this marriage was just to bring some good luck to Carl, and it didn't matter whether the bride was Eliza or Edie.

However, in a way, they still thought Edie was better. After all, her appearance and demeanor were there for all to see. There was no doubt she was quite charming.

A group of people was in Carl's room, signing contracts with Edie. Carl was surrounded by a bunch of medical equipment, lying in bed completely unaware.

""This is the marriage agreement...""

""And this is the property division agreement...""

Edie signed the agreements without hesitation, the pen in her hand moving swiftly.

The lawyer explained the terms to Edie, ""Mr. Fabian Brooks will give you a black card later; you can use it freely. As for the property agreement, even after a divorce, you'll still have 50% of Mr. Carl Brooks's private property.""

After signing the contracts, Fabian Brooks, Carl's father, said, ""You're now a member of the Brooks family. We'll hold a wedding feast in a few days to celebrate. Carl really needs your care.""

Edie nodded. ""It's my duty, Mr. Brooks.""

Fabian was quite satisfied with Edie. ""Still address me so formally?""

Edie quickly changed her address. ""Alright, Fabian.""

Seeing that Edie had no reluctance in her attitude, Fabian softened his stance. ""I feel at ease knowing you'll look after him.""

Indeed, he could rest assured. After all, it was Edie who had performed Carl's surgery.

Regardless of whether Carl could hear or not, Fabian said to him, ""This is Edie. She'll be your wife from now on.""

Carl lay motionless on the bed.

After Edie saw the group out of the room, the butler Drogo Macy came in again. He approached Carl, who was lying in bed, trying to help him sit up.

""Let me help,"" Edie said.

Drogo declined her offer. ""Thank you. But I'm taking him for a bath.""

""I'll do it. I'm his wife now; I should help him,"" Edie insisted.

Drogo didn't want to argue with Edie over it and backed off.

Edie got a black card and 50% of the private property of the wealthiest man in Clerlun. She felt a bit smug inside. 'This is truly a windfall.'

She was very satisfied because Carl was a vegetable, which saved her a lot of trouble. He could give her money, wouldn't nitpick at her, and was also good-looking.

As soon as Drogo closed the door, Edie looked at Carl's peaceful and handsome face in bed and murmured, ""Your family is really generous.""

Carl had been lying in bed for half a month without knowing when he regained consciousness.

He could hear the sounds around him and naturally knew that his family had got him a wife to bring his change of luck.

Even though he had not deliberately tried to find out about Edie, they both moved in the same upper-class circles and had unintentionally attended the same parties or heard each other's names at certain social events.

Carl only knew that Edie was very smart; she was a 21-year-old medical doctor, the youngest director at a tertiary hospital in the city and a genius in the medical field adored by many; she was completely different from most rich heirs who only knew how to enjoy themselves.

The first impression Carl had of Edie was when she said, ""Your family is really generous,"" by his bedside in a laughing voice.

He thought she was greedy and scheming. 'She must have racked her brains to marry me for my money. Now that I'm a vegetable and can't refuse the engagement, she's seized the opportunity. And it seems she even has a boyfriend.'

He thought gloomily in his heart, 'Who is her boyfriend? He's such an unlucky man to have taken an interest in her and got played by her. See, as soon as she got the chance, she married me.

'Well, fine. At least I'm the best among her targets.'

# Chapter 4 The Best Actor Boyfriend

Edie had no idea what Carl was thinking. She lifted the blanket off him, helped him from the bed to his wheelchair, and then moved him to the bathtub.

Carl was a tall man, and for Edie, he was heavy. Just these few actions left her panting.

She knelt on the ground, leaning half her body on Carl as she caught her breath. ""This is exhausting me.""

But then she thought about not only the money but also getting such a desirable husband, and she quickly regained her energy. She pinched his chiseled face and laughed. ""Okay, I'll let it slide since you're so adorable.""

Hot guys were always adorable.

Edie's breath tickled Carl's neck, and he let out a cold laugh in his mind, 'She's just after my money.'

It was not until Edie started undressing him that he remembered she was there to bathe him.

Carl cursed Drogo several times in his mind for taking money but not doing his job. 'Drogo, you just wait! When I wake up, I'm docking your salary by a month.'

Edie stripped Carl naked, filled the bathtub with water, and went about her work with professional ease. She even chuckled while washing him. ""It's so big.""

Carl was speechless. 'Not only is she greedy and scheming, but she's also flirtatious.'

Edie didn't notice that Carl's right hand fingers, submerged in water, twitched rapidly in anger.

It was almost unnoticeably; or else, with Edie's professionalism, she would have reacted immediately‚Äîthis could be a sign of consciousness in a vegetative state patient.

Considering they were now legally married, Edie felt completely at ease while bathing Carl, not feeling awkward at all.

Even though she had touched every part of his body, Carl had to admit that Edie was impeccable in her profession. 'With her taking care of me, it really increases my chances of recovery.'

He gritted his teeth. 'Alright, I'll bear with it for now. We'll settle accounts when I wake up. 50% of my private property? No way; you won't get a cent after the divorce.'

\*\*\*\*\*

After dealing with the Brooks family matters, Edie returned to the hospital and continued her work.

By the time she got off work, it was already past nine o'clock.

She still had a message from her boyfriend Sebastian from last night, suggesting they needed a talk.

Edie and Sebastian had been dating for over a year. She knew where Sebastian's studio was and drove straight there.

Sebastian, the mega-famous best actor.

Sebastian was always in the headlines, and although rumors about his love life never ended, none of them had ever been confirmed.

Edie walked into Sebastian's studio. Assistant Ebenezer Ray was guarding the outside. Upon seeing Edie, he quickly stood up in front of her, his guilty demeanor unconcealed. He stammered, ""M-Ms. Thornton... What brings you here?""

Edie took another few steps forward and heard some ambiguous moans coming from the lounge. She let out a cold laugh. ""Am I interrupting something?""

Ebenezer looked embarrassed and did not dare to respond.

However, the conversation coming from the two people in the lounge who were indulging in each other had already made it unnecessary for Ebenezer to explain anything to Edie.

""Sebastian, thank you so much. If it weren't for you, I would have had to serve that vegetative state guy for the rest of my life.""

""No problem. The engagement was supposed to be Edie's in the first place.""

Eliza said as she acted cute, ""My parents forced me into the engagement with Carl to connect with the Brooks family. My heart has always belonged to you. You won't blame me, will you?""

""Of course not. I know you had your difficulties. I feel sorry for you.""

""I knew you would be best to me."" Eliza smiled.

""Say something sweet to me.""

""Let's do it again, Sebastian.""

Edie waited patiently for them to finish once, but she didn't have much time for their second-time sex.

Before she could quickly head to the lounge, Ebenezer tried to stop her. ""Ms. Thornton, you...""

Edie patted his shoulder: ""I'm here to catch the best actor cheating. Don't block my way. Decide whether you want to save some dignity for Sebastian or plan tomorrow's trending search in advance. How does the title 'The best actor caught in adultery' sound?""

Turns out, people are more likely to use the app when it offers:

* Priced between¬†**$5-$6**¬†(affordable, but not too cheap)
* Around¬†**180mg of caffeine per 20 oz**¬†(solid energy boost)

* **2% reduced fat milk**¬†as a go-to option
* **Seasonal drinks**¬†(people love limited-time stuff)

The following essay may be likened to conjecture. Here one will find only my ponderings with no proof aside from the proof of my own personal experience. I don‚Äôt refer to a great many sources here, and the ones I use may be likened to conjecture themselves. What one understands herein boils down to the amount of belief they choose to invest in it. What one decides is ultimately true to oneself. Discernment is advisable in any case, so one should take it as they will. I am not fully educated at a post-secondary level, my career isn‚Äôt glamorous, nor am I currently a person of notable fame or social standing. I am writing this from a position of life-lessons-learned, dreams understood, imaginings fulfilled, and the faith therein.

\---

We are all of us individually responsible for the salvation of our own prevailing realities. To change one's experience of reality is to change from the inside-out. One must not look outside oneself into their surroundings in search of an answer. The answer always resides within oneself and may be drawn upon through inward acts of prayer, meditation and self-revelation.

When I was much younger, within an episode of psychosis, I penned a short piece entitled ‚ÄúMy Last Ditch Attempt to Save the World‚Äù. In that article I proposed that God was speaking to me in each moment, that the answer to all of life‚Äôs problems was unconditional love, and that my purpose was to share this knowledge with others. These truths were surrounded by a complex illusion that presented itself in my madness. I do feel that this article will be a much more polished and valiant attempt at explaining myself.

One night, not too long ago, I went to sleep in the hopes of having a dream that would guide me into deeper realizations of Self. When I awoke I was not very surprised that I indeed had a dream, though its contents took a while to decode. The main takeaway is that a figure in this dream had told me ‚ÄúIf you believe something bad will happen to somebody you will see it happen to them, but really, nothing bad happens to anybody.‚Äù In this dream I had a premonition that my friends would get into a car accident - they did - but later I found out they were fine and completely unharmed.

I described this dream in a post in r/SNBE and a user there mentioned that it could be describing the nature of quantum immortality. Indeed I had been formulating my own ideas about this topic in the weeks prior. In my life, I‚Äôve had numerous close calls with death and yet I‚Äôve somehow (impossibly?) survived them all, miraculously existing presently in a state of good physical and mental health.

I had been driving when I was struck with a revelation about quantum immortality. I realized that in all the near death experiences I had suffered, I had indeed died. I had died in those realities, after which my soul transitioned (or was reincarnated) into the most closely linked reality to that one in which I had perished. Every path of action that my life could possibly take would all eventually converge into a singular path. We can liken a timeline or reality to the smallest fiber strand in a rope. Each strand is woven together and the point of death is where two strands are intertwined together. Eventually, over the course of many deaths, the many individual strands become one unified strand. At the point of death one will not die, one will only enter into a new reality. Somebody who believes in death may see one die physically, but then they will go on to say ‚Äúthey have gone to a better place‚Äù.

In my most recent articles I briefly described the process of attaining spiritual fulfillment here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Soulnexus/comments/kwpwcn/a\_quick\_roadmap\_to\_spiritual\_fulfillment\_andor/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Soulnexus/comments/kwpwcn/a_quick_roadmap_to_spiritual_fulfillment_andor/)

Then I went on to explain the importance of sharing spiritual fulfillment with others here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Soulnexus/comments/kyqjuk/be\_the\_change/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Soulnexus/comments/kyqjuk/be_the_change/)

I offer these as a backdrop to this essay, in case the steps to get to this point are overlooked. Once I had crystallized spiritual fulfillment in my life and in the lives of those who I was directly acquainted with, I was immediately struck with figuring out the business of how to go about bringing spiritual fulfillment into the entire world I live in.

The process of manifestation knows no limits or boundaries. I witnessed the majority of ‚Äúmanifestors‚Äù using that power to manifest items or specific persons that would make them more comfortable on the material plane of existence. What people typically desire is the reward of financial gain, loving relationships with other-selves - and for these specific needs manifestation works fine. As long as one has faith, they will receive whatever it is they are seeking.

Personally, I got caught up in these goals as well, I was testing the waters, so to speak, and these were stepping stones into my current reality. But material success has not been my life‚Äôs main focus. My main devotion has long been spiritual success, so I have good momentum to continue moving in the direction of this perfection of Self. I always knew I would never be truly satisfied with a life lived in a material plane of existence. Deep within myself I knew my goal could be nothing short of saving the entire world. Now how do I go about doing this?

Neville Goddard speaks about ‚ÄúLiving in the end‚Äù where through beliefs and feelings one can imagine the content of their most spectacular dreams realized and brought into fruition. By bringing up and living in the feeling of the ‚Äúwish fulfilled‚Äù, through a shift in conscious awareness, we essentially grasp our future and attach it to our current experience of reality.

Now, I have been fortunate, personally, since through my experience of life (with psychedelic drug use, psychosis, meditation/prayer, and near death experiences) I have a very good idea and understanding of what a heavenly experience feels like. \[Essentially it‚Äôs a state of unspeakable peace and love.\] By recalling these experiences and the feelings they furnished, I was able to remember them into my present experience. The more I encapsulated and remembered these times, the more I was able to transform my reality into a consistent heavenly state.

I think that the act of saving the world is a very personal endeavour. Meaning that the salvation of my world does not necessarily equate to rescuing others from a life they are unsatisfied with.

I could drop biblical quotes here:

Matthew 25:

31 When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, He will sit on His glorious throne.  


34 Then the King will say to those on His right, ‚ÄòCome, you who are blessed by My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world

21 ‚ÄòWell done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Enter into the joy of your master!‚Äô

Or for further material, check out all of the promises made to ‚Äúhe who overcomes‚Äù in the book of Revelations. They are astonishingly remarkable!

I have said it clearly and it has been stated clearly by many modern mystics as well as all throughout ancient religious texts. One needs simply to accept their godhood in order to obtain it. Even so, my current experience has shown me that others will scoff at this and claim it is falsehood because it does not align with their own beliefs and principles. In my opinion, it‚Äôs not necessary that it does! Everyone in my world is enlightened because of this very fact. Free will promises each individual entitlement to their own unique beliefs. Each and every person is the personification of their beliefs and ideals. In my reality everyone represents their truest ideals of Self and cannot escape it! Same goes for me. I envision myself as a somewhat shady saviour of this timeline, liberating others from behind a shadow, without drawing too much unnecessary attention upon myself. I admit everything I‚Äôve ever truly wanted I have realized and my life is the cumulative embodiment of this fact.

Helen Schuchman states in her book ‚ÄúA Course In Miracles‚Äù that there is no order to the magnitude of miracles. Her book starts off with this teaching and I believe it may be the most important one in this course due to its implications. Similarly Neville Goddard teaches, in one way or another, ‚Äúif you can dream it, you can believe it, you can become it‚Äù and that ‚Äúassumptions become facts‚Äù. Therefore, if I want to save the world, or to assume my godhood (√† la Christ consciousness), it should be no more difficult than paying off a debt, securing a romantic partner, or manifesting a cup of coffee. The only barrier being self-doubt. If one‚Äôs faith is wholly complete there is absolutely no limitation on what they can achieve.

I believe the future of humanity is to be assimilated into Christ consciousness and its application to bring itself into purposeful alignment with God‚Äôs will. Again this is a simple transition of belief brought on by a shift in conscious awareness, and again, it is deeply personal. In my current experience my perception of others was reconstructed into a vision of others to be fully enlightened through each of their actions (even though they might not believe to hold that position for themselves). And to quote R&M ‚Äúthat was always allowed‚Äù! Everyone is entitled to their beliefs and that entitlement guarantees the gift of enlightenment. This is the promise of eternal life. We cannot die. When we see an individual die in our reality they have only been brought into the fold of another timeline where their soul continues to thrive in an ever-progressing state towards universal oneness.

So onto the crucifixion and resurrection. I believe we ‚Äúdie‚Äù and are ‚Äúborn again‚Äù in each and every moment. Every time this occurs we enter into a new reality that is closer to God than the previous incarnation. We can travel back and forth between these incarnations, or states of being, in order to resolve problems & conflict through the act of forgiveness. By forgiving the past we can bring a new level of clarity to our present and future experiences of reality. This is basically just a good form of self-therapy which leads into the acceptance of one‚Äôs current situation and builds towards the progression into a constant state of salvation / illumination / oneness.

This is what I speak of as inter-dimensional travel. The vehicle is feeling. We travel to past states by feeling them emotionally and mentally. We can make corrections there and return again to a present state where all is well. We can also travel into a future timeline by imagining it, sensing it, feeling it, and experiencing it as though it is our present experience. Then we can bring that knowledge back and adjust our present experience of reality. At times I am speaking to myself from a position in the future where everyone is in heaven, together as one. My present self receives and translates these transmissions. To tie this back to my opening comments, we are all personally responsible for finding the faith within ourselves to bring heaven into our individual realities. I can not do this for anyone but myself. Good luck <3

(TLDR starts here)

The kingdom of heaven is definitely meant to be our present experience. I believe it is accessible at any time at the very moment we reach out to capture it, when we will discover it has been there in waiting all along. Likewise, with the matter of Christ consciousness, this is a mindstate that is ever-present and easily obtainable if one can shift from unbelief into belief. One is only limited by their own apparent lack of faith. And so, when we want to save the world the only barriers are self-imposed. Each person one meets is a reflection of oneself. They exist for the purpose of mirroring whatever internal state of being one has back at oneself.

When one saves oneself it is natural to save everyone in one‚Äôs presence, who will save them back in return. Blessing others with a heavenly experience is a surefire way to bless oneself with the same thing. Why hoard a position of divinity when sharing it makes it so much more powerful in effect?

The purpose of this essay is to be a form of catalyst to any individual towards their following of a personal calling into the inheritance of their divine gifts.

Always with love,

And many blessings,

I am 36 years old, was diagnosed last year with combination ADHD, and finally started medication this year. I've been on 150mg of Wellbutrin for around 3 months now and after going through a severe high and then a severe low, I have equalized out and have been feeling pretty great for a few weeks now. It's helped my ability to focus tremendously and I feel overall happier. However, it's not helping with all aspects of my ADHD, like being able to start tasks that need to be done, motivation to keep routines and forgetting things almost immediately. My doctor is starting me on a low dose of 5mg of Adderall that I will be picking up from the pharmacy today. Just wondering a few things:

I take my Wellbutrin everyday at 10am. Should I take the Adderall at the same time? I'm usually awake around 8-9ish every morning and up to around midnight every day. I have to do job related things from mid afternoon to nighttime so that's where I need the most focus and motivation. I usually enjoy a mug of coffee when I first wake up and then take my Wellbutrin at 10 like I said, so depending on how my morning has gone I've usually finished it by the time I take my med. But I don't know how the caffeine will go with the Adderall. (I only have this one cup a day right now) Thoughts? Also what should I expect?

Slide 1

‚Ä¢ Sebamed is my ride or die. You can assume that by the broken bulletüò≠üôèüèº
WRP but it's on the pricier
side for me.

‚Ä¢ Renee Gloss is actually so nice, smells amazing and high shine. (Dries up my lips severely though) but pocket friendly. WRP

‚Ä¢ The body shop shea butter lip butter was fine when I first used it, but I realised it doesn't do a lot for me. I've gone through two bullets of the heavy duty hemp lip balm by the same brand and it's significantly better. 
WNRP

‚Ä¢Mars edge of desire lip pencil - the color is nice and feels like my lips but better - with slight tint.
WNRP

‚Ä¢Lakm√© 9-5, not a fan of the color, used it as a blush lol. 
WNRP

‚Ä¢ Kiro lip gloss is amazing! You need the tiniest bit to liven your lips and the sparkle is kinda cute. 
100% WRP

‚Ä¢Tirtir waterism 01, the glitter is adorable. The color is fine, leaves a slight tint behind. Not a fan of the color payoff but I didn't use a lot of product so perhaps that will change. WRP but not a fan of the fragrance.

‚Ä¢ NMFe, haven't used it yet because sebamed‚ô•Ô∏è

‚Ä¢ Laneige Mango, feels very nice on the lips and quite hydrating for sure. 
WRP this and the mask if I have the budget lol

‚Ä¢ Nat habit Kokum Honey lip butter - gorgeous fragrance - easily softens lips - a little heavy for me but the ingredients are the real hero for me.
WRP

‚Ä¢ Vaseline lip therapy - hate the application process only because I reach out to it at least 15 times a day. 
WRP this and all other variants because what this has done for my lips, nothing else has. 
Don't know why people hate on it though üò≠

‚Ä¢ Sugar pop lip color, don't remember the variant but the color didn't look well on me. Also, it's extremely. 
WNRP anything from sugar because I used their Kajal too and it made my eyes burn.
Their nail paints made the first layer of my otherwise very healthy nails peel off.

Slide 2 

‚Ä¢ Quench botanics mon Cherie lip oil - definitely softens the lips and not very heavy, but there are def better products. Love it for the applicator though. 
WNRP since there are better products 

Slide 3 Nykaa lip palette - don't use it for my lips because I'm not really a tinted lips girly, did use it recently for some color and loved it. I do religiously use it as a cheek tint and l'm a fan. 
WNRP though because l'd rather just get a nice blush. The creamy formula is def nice though.

I also had coffee and cake lip balm by lovechild by masaba. I just want to say, I have not used a worse lip product ever. Did nothing for my lips and the color payoff SUCKEDDDD big time. Has a weird medicinal taste and fragrance and made my throat itch. WNRP. SUCKS.

1k7mfzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskContractors/comments/1k7mfzz/is_it_possible_to_hear_and_smell_other_neighbors/,Is it possible to hear and smell other neighbors after a dropped ceiling is put in below?,"Thanks for your time. 

Pretty sure the neighbor below dropped their ceiling.  It sounded like a roto tiller with a ton of shaking and noise for about two weeks, clanging banging etc  - and after two weeks the floor seemed different to walk on- like firmer and the sound below was muffled. To further support my guess - when the unit was unoccupied the owner must have turned down or off the heat.  And so first time in many years heard constant pipes knocking when the heat was going on, on etc under the main floor - which never once occurred prior. 

The question..is it possible that when they dropped their ceiling they somehow created passageways for smell and sound to come up and in from their unit and a unit next to them?  Prior to the work I never smelled anything except from hallway door and I never heard anything below but the neighbor directly below well, and I could hear doors slam hard below.  

Agtef the work- Now I can hear their neighbor loudly/clearly (one down and over from me). I can smell food cooking, coffee brewed and now weed.  That was never the case before. 

What's crazy is my next door neighbor is a heavy smoker and I never smell any of his smokes and none of his home cooking. 

And what sucks more is this past winter I had severe drafts coming in.  Eventually I found the floor that is an exterior wall above it has separated from the baseboard - had to plug it with some backers rod.  But it made me think it was the weight of their new dropped ceiling. 

Really would appreciate if this sounds plausible.  Thanks

I‚Äôm getting married and the thought of being legally and financially responsible for one of my brothers who has a serious mental illness and has NEVER worked gave me so much anxiety, depression and hopelessness to the point that I have become suicidal. Suicidal ‚Äî because it felt that was the only way I wouldn‚Äôt disappoint her since I didn‚Äôt say no to what she wanted. 

I tried to talk to her that I didn‚Äôt want to do it anymore and she RAGED! She said I‚Äôm giving her more problems and she hasn‚Äôt even had her coffee yet (different time zones). 

I hung up ‚Äî and I even asked my fiance to listen because I told him I know she will rage and I was so scared of even bringing it up. 

I grew up trying to please her, appease her ‚Äî I never wanted to disappoint her.

I finally wrote a letter to her explaining why I cannot do it ‚Äî why I would not risk my future for someone who has better care in our home country (he has 12 hours of personal care daily to ensure he takes his meds). I even asked ChatGPT to write it for a narcissist so I can just focus on my issues and not bring up any of her shortcomings. 

As advised by my therapist, I silenced notifications and blocked her on Facebook. 

She talked to my fiance for hours and tells him that she was deeply hurt by my letter (when I didn‚Äôt even criticize her for anything) and that I betrayed my family. She says that if she wanted to ‚Äî she can easily ‚Äúput me in my place.‚Äù But since I‚Äôm suicidal now she will not even do it anymore. 

She goes on to criticize my fiance that we live together before getting married and that he should consider converting to our religion. She brings up that he doesn‚Äôt have a house yet before we get married so how can we possibly manage to survive? 

She was insisting that my fiance helped me write the letter and his influence made me do this when I was her humble servant for so long. I‚Äôm in my late 30‚Äôs and have walked on eggshells my entire life. I was afraid of her rages. 

We‚Äôve had good memories. I‚Äôm grateful for the times she took care of me, was there for my school functions etc. 

My eldest brother was deeply damaged by her because he didn‚Äôt become a lawyer, doctor etc whatever measure of success she deems should be. She triangulated us ‚Äî but keeps saying she wants us to ‚Äútake care of each other.‚Äù She wanted us to excel but at the same time seems that she‚Äôs not happy for us now that we have relationships (she has a dysfunctional loveless relationship with my father)‚Äî
My brother is now in his 40‚Äôs by the way and none of us has been married before. 

It‚Äôs really sad that I came to realize that she is a narcissist after our marriage counselor pointed out that it seems that her control and rage isn‚Äôt normal. I used to worship my mother ‚Äî I really looked up to her growing up. 

And I‚Äôm in deep paining knowing it will never be the same ‚Äî and I know that ultimately I have to protect myself, my future family now even if it means cutting her off‚Ä¶ 

It‚Äôs also overwhelming that Mother‚Äôs Day is coming up and I don‚Äôt even know what to do about it. 

I guess I just wanted to vent somewhere where people would understand‚Ä¶ and I hope I can feel somehow better when everything I‚Äôve read and heard says she probably won‚Äôt change.

I did get the keto flu and have the lovely keto breath but it was worth it. Fast forward to Christmas, I fell off on Christmas and felt horrible, I knew I couldn‚Äôt eat that way as it made me feel really sick, but family visits and drama made it hard to stick to keto. Fast forward again until March of this year. I had gained back roughly 10 of the 20lbs I lost. I started reducing carbs and realizing the best I myself and my gut feel the best is mostly eating eggs and meat. My one downside is I do love cheese with my eggs and creamer in my coffee. Here is why I am frustrated I have not been able to get into ketosis since my first try. I use Carbmanager to track my foods, often times all I eat coffee, creamer, 3 eggs with either ham (no sugar added) or bacon and I will either have tuna with Mayo or some steak or ground beef in the evening, all measured. I am not losing weight nor in ketosis. I don‚Äôt want to give up because regardless I feel so much better day to day with little to no inflammation. I want to lose 75-80lbs. I am lucky I don‚Äôt feel hungry often times. Now here is the thing, I know it‚Äôs my creamer that is causing the lack of me being in ketosis, unfortunately I don‚Äôt like my coffee any other way so I guess I will have to give it up completely, which is mentally hard to do. Do you all think the coffee is also the reason I‚Äôm not losing weight? (I did have coffee and creamer back in November when I did lose weight). I do also work out, right now working mostly mobility exercises as I am recovering from a back injury, every other day. ",2,1745591022.0,carnivorediet,7,1.0,False

I'm posting here again because I've met some incredible people that have been so amazing to talk to and I wanted to find even more of you! Yes I'm greedyüò§  
I know this is primarily a dating subreddit but I was hoping to make some friends and figured why not do it within the community!  
I'd really like to get to know some ladies that are interested in a long-term friendship, sharing everything with each other and being supportive and really putting the effort in!  
I'm not interested in dating or anything sexual, I'm not opposed to something happening naturally if a friendship blossoms into more, but right now it's not something I'm ready for and I really don't know when I will be.  
So if you're okay with that and want to know what kind of person I am then read on and maybe I'll be intriguing in some way!üéâPreferably ladies around my age but don't be afraid to say hi if you'd like! You can also be anywhere in the world, any timezone, that's quite alright with me!

I'm going to be movingüöö sometime this year, will be staying within Ontario but moving to a different city which is both exciting and terrifying because I've basically always lived in the same area my whole life.üò∞  
‚ù§Ô∏èI really like being expressive, sometimes I forget because I try to just get information out, but I use a lot of exclamation points and emojis because I like showing that ‚ú®*flair*‚ú®*and*‚ú®*magic*‚ú®  
‚ù§Ô∏èAlong with that I try to be super positive and happy!üòäThe world sucks a lot and the last thing I want to do is add any negativity to anyone's life, let alone the people I care about. That doesn't mean I won't listen and be there for you when life is hard or you're in pain or you just need someone to hold you while you cry. I will always be there for you for everything, good and bad.üíï  
‚ù§Ô∏èI will be your cheerleader and cheer on every amazing thing you do in your life!  
You aced an exam that was super important? Hell yeah! that's amazing and we should celebrate however would make you happy!  
You stood up to someone that was being an asshole? Amazing shit! that takes a lot of courage to do and you're awesome for that!  
You were able to brush your teeth today? Fuck yeah! You should be so proud of yourself because that can be so hard to do!  
‚ù§Ô∏èI have 1 kittyüêà‚Äç‚¨õ, a longhaired cutie of a void named Sasha! She's an absolute sweetheart and I love her so much! If you have any pets PLEASE tell me all about them, I want to hear you gush all your love for them! Also if you want to share pictures I would love to see your babies too! Cats, dogs, rabbits, rats, mice, snakes, bugs, doesn't matter to me! And if you don't have any pets but want them then I want to hear that too!  
‚ù§Ô∏èReally like video games, in a bit of a lull right now because I used to play a lot of competitive games like League of Legends, Rainbow 6 Siege, Apex Legends, etc, but now I don't and I'm not sure what to play, so I've been looking and I *THINK* I have some ideas sitting in my steam cart that I might buy.  
‚ù§Ô∏èI have ADHD, currently medicated and it has done WONDERS for my appetite, but for my actual issue with attention, ehhh not so muchüôÅbut I'm working on it, hopefully I'll land on a medication that works for that and then I'll be unstoppable!üß±(probably not but one can hope!)  
‚ù§Ô∏èI looooove to singüé§, like it's my ***all time favorite thin***g! I am so jealous of those women with those gorgeous voices (this is an example of a voice I hope to sound like someday [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVRtM1x9wQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVRtM1x9wQ)). I'm taking lessons right now and my teacher has been wonderful so I'm looking forward to getting better and hopefully one day I'll sound amazing too!üòä  
‚ù§Ô∏èTo go along with singing , I really like voice acting too! I haven't done much with it but I try to mimic voices and read stories and make voices for the characters and really get into it. I love voice related anything and really want to have amazing control over it, especially if I can use it make a future friend or partner happy too!  
‚ù§Ô∏èCookingüç≥is something I love to do as well! I've been making some yummy recipes lately and I really want to get better at that too, I really want to make amazing food for the people I care about to enjoy, like if someone likes my cooking that'd make it so wonderful!üòãThen I'll want to cook even more and stuff them full of yummy food!  
‚ù§Ô∏èSome day I want to have a garden too so I can have really beautiful flowers but also an herb garden would be awesome so I can have fresh ones for using in cooking!  
‚ù§Ô∏èI really love taking care of my hair, skin (there's no emoji for skin, crazy!), and nailsüíÖ(speaking off, I need to trim them!), been learning a lot on that lately, and that goes hand in hand with the cooking so I can make healthy but yummy foods!  
‚ù§Ô∏èI drink a ton of water each day too (gotta stay hydrated girlies!üí¶), but also love some pop too, sometimes tea is really nice too or if I'm in the mood then apple cider.  
‚ù§Ô∏èI also loooove makeupüíÑso if you're able to teach me anything with that I'd love to know it! It's something I want to master someday!  
‚ù§Ô∏èI really love fashion and styles and clothesüëöand really want to put together a bomb-ass wardrobe. I don't have any one particular style (or the clothes for it, soon though!), I love such a wide variety that I just realized I should start going window shopping!  
‚ù§Ô∏èI exercise several times a week, I want to be healthy and in good shape and I will work my ass off to get that! (*while also cooking healthy but unhealthy foods*ü§´)  
I love dancing and want to learn how to do that at some point too!  
‚ù§Ô∏èI'm really very much a goofball and love being weird, if making a funny voice or face or strange contorted body movements or anything will make you laugh then I will absolutely do it!  
‚ù§Ô∏èI like to believe I have high emotional intelligence (even if the regular kind is lacking!‚ùåüß†‚ùå) and will always try to notice moods or changes to make sure that the people around me are doing okay. Anything that I'm able to do to help I will do.  
‚ù§Ô∏èWith that said, communication is *super duper* important to me. If there's something I'm doing that you don't like or if you need help or you're depressed or have something weighing on you, whatever it is, then please tell me. I can't do anything to help or to change and be a better person if you don't let me know what it is. I won't ever judge you for the things you say to me. I will listen and do whatever I can to be a great friend to you.üíï  
‚ù§Ô∏èFor the most part I'm an open book, if you are genuinely curious about something about me and want to know it, if you ask I will probably tell you. So long as you are respectful.

üíïHere's some random facts about me about things I don't like, just in case you thought I was only positivity and liked everythingüòÅ  
üòëMonkeys. Like I hate them so much, just annoying little chittering assholes that only cause trouble. Plus they're ugly and I hate how they sound, UGH. (however I have monkeys on some socks and they're cute and I would be perfectly fine with a monkey plushy, just not my first choice!)  
‚òïHot chocolate. It's just not my...cup of tea (yeah that's not a pun...), it's too rich for me and I've never liked it no matter how many variations I've tried. If you make it I'll drink it, but it's not my first choice.  
‚òïCoffee. I'm just not a coffee person. It's too bitter and bland and yes I could put sugar and milk/cream in it but I don't want to have to do that to like something. I can have plain ass tea and that tastes amazing without anything in it. And yes I'll still drink coffee if you make it.  
üç¥Chewing noises. I can't stand hearing people eat or chew or make mouth noises. It is the GROSSESTü§Æsound in the world to me. Or if I hear you breathing I can't handle that either, it's too much.  
If you're my partner that'd probably be an exception because I'd want to hear the noises your mouth makes, but everyone else NUH UH!

‚ù§Ô∏èWell that's about it for now, I wrote way more than I ever expected too and for some reason ended on some negatives but it is what it is!üòÅI tend to love seeing posts that are like this when I look for people to talk to and I figured someone that wants to talk to me might enjoy the same, so why not!üòä

‚ù§Ô∏èIf you'd like to talk and develop a wonderful friendship then please send me a message and I'd be happy to hear from you! I hope you are having a lovely day so far and that it keeps getting lovelier!

1k7m5p9,https://i.redd.it/jb4td8h8ozwe1.jpeg,A previous iPhone owner's TCL Flip Go review,"I've had the TCL Flip Go on T-Mobile in the US now for almost a month. I came from an iPhone 13 Pro which was promptly sold off. I bought the cheapest iPad at BestBuy, a keyboard for it, and that now stays at my house on a charger in our home office. I took the iPhone functionality, made it too big to carry around, and it is now essentially a laptop computer. 

The TCL feels decently well built. No better that the flip-phones of my teen years, no worse. Nicely textured grippy case compared to the ""bar of soap"" apple would like to sell you. The speaker is LOUD. Anything more than half volume while in a call is deafening. Speaker phone is almost not necessary. Ringtone options are medium to low annoying and not too cringy like some. I'm a 6'2"" 34 year old mechanic with a beard, I like having sonic options that don't sound like a Japanese schoolgirl. 

Texting is definitely a big drawback. It does group texts fine. Sends and receives pictures fine. It isn't so much the lack of QWERTY (although that would be MUCH preferred) it's that the predictive texting is incredibly bad. Forget using words with apostrophes. It's 5X faster to type ""do not"" or ""cannot"" rather than don't or can't. It will never guess that's what you're trying to say. It doesn't know the word ""ok"" either. Only ""okay"". There's a bunch of other extremely common words it seems to not know exist. I just end up calling people now. Shockingly that's often much easier. 

  
Battery life is pretty good. Coming from an iPhone it's a nuclear reactor. I have about 68% left after a day of taking/making many calls for work. Call quality is good, no complaints from others. My wife could actually almost never hear me on my iPhone and says she hears me crystal clear now.  

Internet browser is hilariously bad. All I use it for is typing ""weather (my zip code)"" on Google, or seeing if a business is open or not again, on Google. It's so clunky and cumbersome to use, you just simply aren't going to. On most websites you get the ""browser not supported"" message. On a lot of them, you can't scroll at all. Email is what it is. I have Gmail set up on the phones email app. Bottom-line: you can read emails if someone sends you one. Whether or not you can click a link is 50-50. Whether or not that link will work on this browser is about 30-70. 

Clock app is good. Stopwatch, alarm, timer. All work. 

The camera is a potato with no flash. I use it to take pictures of part numbers, serial numbers, etc. There is no flashlight. I now carry my Canon DSLR with me in a small bag with a notepad, pen, flashlight, charger, coffee mug etc. I've also fallen in love with photography. Which I now do when I would otherwise be doom-scrolling (Pic attached). 

This phone is very meat and potatoes. What you see is what you get. There's little customization. There's no real way to get apps that I'm aware of. None of the big social media sites even work on the browser. YouTube does, but again... so clunky, screen so small... you won't use it. So far though, its dead-nuts reliable as a calling/texting device.

I don't think this will be my forever dumb phone. This is essentially the cheapest way to get somebody like a grandparent or kid a phone that works with some extra handy features. I will forever be grateful to the little Flip for showing me what I don't need. I will however be on the hunt for something a little more purpose built eventually. I don't actually want more features, just a better way of interacting with them. I'm generally against pre-ordering things, so I may wait and see how some of these newer E-ink releases do.  That or a Ghost phone or similar device that I can customize with what I do and don't want. 

My dream phone would be something like: Slider style phone, E-ink or B&W Display, Chat GPT app, physical QWERTY keyboard, call, text, group text, basic email, Spotify/apple music capability (I haven't figured out a music solution yet), uber and that's about it. 

As stated, I've gotten really into photography so I'm now even debating whether or not I need the camera. I haven't needed navigation once. Wasn't a big user of it before. I just look up where I'm going on a map before I leave if I've never been there, and figure it out. 

If you're snooping around this sub, toying with the idea of doing this: trust me, do it. People tend to obsess over features and ""how will I live if I don't have \_\_\_\_?"" Just more endless research to do on your smartphone late at night. Spoiler: there is no perfect ""dumb phone"" out there specifically tailored to you. Just pick one that has cell service where you live, jump in with both feet, and see how good you feel. 

Stop buying ""smart lightbulbs"", ""smart toasters"", creating endless accounts that are going to be vibrating and dinging against your thigh incessantly, eventually getting you to pick that damn thing up yet again, get distracted AGAIN, and loose another half hour of your life to nothing once AGAIN. 

The thing is you've been psy-op'd by tech companies into thinking you actually can't function without them. You most certainly can, and you'll be amazed what you can live without. My list of must-haves would be much longer if you asked me when I still had an iPhone. 

So until further notice, I'll be out in the world with my camera, wallet, keys, pocket knife and TCL Flip. 

Hope this helps somebody make the switch. ",4,1745590881.0,dumbphones,0,0.84,False

She would talk badly about him a lot, saying what he did to her was horrible and that she hates him for what he did (basically neglecting her and removing her from a friendship group). We would be lying in bed and she would bring him up during conversation.

On our first date out together, we were having a nice night, then she suggested we go to a certain bar where he was working. I went along with in and shook his hand, and she was happy I did it, saying she felt relieved I got to meet him. We didn't even stay for a drink, and left after the handshake.

Next, she was invited to his birthday party, along with me as a +1, and she was adamant we had to go, I really didn't want to, but I did it for her. At the party, she was staring at him a lot, ignoring me when I was speaking to her and watching him, and they had a really long hug and whisper as we left. Another thing that happened, was that me and my girlfriend both agreed as a couple that we didn't want to go out drinking into the nightclubs with everyone after the venue closed, but when approached by people who said ""why aren't you coming out with us"", she pointed at me and said ""because he doesn't want to"". Disaster of a night. Afterwards, I told her how it all made me feel horrible and that she was wrong for doing that, but I was met with ""you're being insecure, how dare you have a go at me for those things.""

Anyway, I took my mind off it and cracked on. Fast forward two months, we are now in our official relationship and everything is amazing, we had such a strong bond, and then boom, she wants to go meet this ex for a coffee. I broke down, nearly crying on my bed, feeling sick and confused. Again, I was met with ""I am not dating an insecure man am I? My mum says if you carry on like this I should just leave you, stop being pathetic"". Again, I caved in and she went to meet him; I felt sick all day.

My girlfriend stated that she was adamant that she had to go meet him for this coffee as a final goodbye, to really move on from him and focus on our relationship together and move forward. But it still didn't sit right with me. I suggested that that should have been done before getting into a new relationship with me.

So, the question is: were my reactions valid or was I being too insecure? We are no longer together and I am just trying to make sense of my own actions.

Hey Mom, Dad‚Äî And, uh, hello to my future wife and hypothetical kids (if you‚Äôre digging through old transmissions one day)!

Just wanted to let you all know I made it up here safe. Pisistratus Station is‚Ä¶ well, let‚Äôs call it ‚Äúindustrial chic.‚Äù My habitation cell‚Äôs about the size of my old freshman dorm‚Äîminus the window, minus the door handle, and plus a constant low hum I haven‚Äôt quite figured out yet. Still, it‚Äôs home for now, and I can't complain.

Before we docked, I got a glimpse of the platform. I had no idea how massive it would be. The whole base is built into this rotating ring system‚Äîlike a wheel half-buried in the dark side of the moon. They said it turns at a fixed rate to create a centrifugal force that simulates Earth‚Äôs gravity. You can‚Äôt feel the rotation from inside, but knowing it's happening gives you this weird sense of motion in the back of your brain. The size of the platform blew me away‚Äîit must be at least a kilometer wide, maybe more. They didn‚Äôt really cover *that* in the training videos. It‚Äôs like living in a giant, quiet machine.

Sorry for the short notice on the departure. Once the company pushed us through our specialization certs, things moved *fast*. One day you‚Äôre learning how to realign hydraulic lock seals in VR, and the next you‚Äôre vacuum-sealed into a shuttle bound for the far side of the Moon. They gave us a week‚Äîenough time to pack a duffel, sign a few papers, and say goodbye without thinking too hard.

Don‚Äôt worry though‚ÄîI'll make sure to snag some moonrocks for everyone. Maybe even some deeper core samples if I get in good with the miners. Some of them are already swapping stories about weird strata shifts and mineral anomalies‚Äîjust harmless tall tales, I‚Äôm sure.

I‚Äôve got orientation briefings in the morning‚Äîstation safety, maintenance protocols, door calibration standards. Nothing too wild. I‚Äôll send more when I get a better lay of the place.

Love you all. Tell the dog I miss him.

Alrighty‚Äîhope everyone‚Äôs cozy back home, tucked in, maybe sipping coffee or watching something dumb on TV. Up here‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs still night. Technically.

I found out that the far side of the Moon doesn‚Äôt really *do* mornings. When we docked, they told us it was ‚Äúnight‚Äù. Turns out, we‚Äôve got another ten days of darkness to go. Fourteen days of night. Fourteen of daylight. Like a celestial switch.

And the telescope? Yeah, you can forget that‚Äîthis side of the Moon never faces Earth. Not even a shimmer. Something to do with the rotation rate of the Earth and Moon mixed with their orbits. It‚Äôs just black sky and stars out there. Honestly, it‚Äôs beautiful, but it also feels‚Ä¶ heavy. Like the whole sky‚Äôs pressing in.

Anyway, I promised you updates, so here we go. Today‚Äôs briefing was actually kind of awesome. We learned why the station‚Äôs named *Pisistratus*. He was some old-school Athenian leader‚Äîbenevolent, they said. Supposedly ushered in a golden age, redistributed land from the elites to the common people, built up the arts and the temples.

I guess that‚Äôs why so many of us are up here. Not just scientists, not just astronauts‚Äînormal people. Mechanics, janitors, miners. I might be the only one in my habitation sector with a degree, and it doesn‚Äôt even matter. That‚Äôs kind of the magic of this place‚Äîeveryone‚Äôs useful. Everyone has a job.

The miners especially‚Äîrough folks, but some of the highest-paid up here. They say the core‚Äôs rich with rare isotopes. Stuff you can‚Äôt even find in Earth‚Äôs crust anymore. I heard a guy say one of the new mines has veins that *pulse*‚Äîprobably just a figure of speech. Right?

I got my assignment! I‚Äôll be stationed near the western airlocks, just off the corridor leading to Mine 7B. It‚Äôs a quieter sector‚Äîlower traffic. I monitor a bank of cameras, run diagnostics, cycle door tests. Six doors, one tech, one long hallway.

Honestly? I‚Äôm excited. There‚Äôs something kind of peaceful about it out there. Real quiet.

Anyway, more tomorrow. Love you guys.

Hey guys. Sorry I didn‚Äôt get a message out yesterday‚Äîit was‚Ä¶ kind of a whirlwind. Spent most of the day clearing out my little office nook near the West Wing airlocks.

You know, I figured everything up here would be sleek, futuristic, that kind of thing. But honestly? Some of my equipment feels like it belongs in a museum. My camera monitors are chunky old CRT-style boxes‚Äîno touchscreens, no fancy heads-up displays. The feeds are weirdly grainy too, with this low hum in the background. Like they‚Äôre running off‚Ä¶ older tech, I guess. I even had to dust some of them off.

Controls are tactile‚Äîclunky switches, big metal toggles. Kind of retro, which would be charming if there weren‚Äôt serious cases where a door could cycle improperly, and all of our oxygen is sucked out.

Yesterday I had to do a servo repair on Door 3. Nothing too wild, but it was different from what the crash course taught us. Wiring was off. Slightly older schematic. Still‚Äîpressurized doors are pressurized doors, right?

Today was quieter. Almost peaceful. I considered walking back to my habitation cell early and writing this, but I stayed in the office and fiddled with the terminal a bit.

Good news‚ÄîI got one of the IT guys, Ethan, to help me clean up the interface. He‚Äôs only been here a couple months longer than me, but he‚Äôs sharp. Showed me a bunch of back-end menus, some override protocols I didn‚Äôt know I had access to. Emergency lockdowns, remote seals‚Äîsome of it felt... above my clearance, if I‚Äôm being honest.

He said it‚Äôs standard now, that they updated things a while back. But the way he said ‚Äúupdated‚Äù was weird. Like the system's been layered over *something older*.

Honestly, the computers themselves run pretty quick. Maybe they‚Äôve just got new guts inside old shells. Kind of getting the feeling that it‚Äôs how it is with this whole station, now that I think about it.

On a lighter note‚Äîcafeteria absolutely *slapped* today. Real apple pie. Not rehydrated, not vacuum-sealed‚Äîactual, warm, fragrant pie. I was sitting there wondering if that technically makes it a moonpie up here. Or‚Ä¶ maybe a moonpie up here would just be called a pie and the ones back home are the frauds? Got caught in that loop for a while.

Anyway, I‚Äôm clocking out soon. Crew from Mine 7B‚Äôs scheduled to return tomorrow. I‚Äôll be on door control‚Äîopen, cycle, seal. Easy stuff.

Gotta stay rested, even if all I‚Äôm doing is pushing buttons. Love you guys always.

Okay. Today was cool, but I have some questions.

The mining crew came back a little early‚Äînot an issue. The outer door camera showed them pulling up in the large buggy with a bag about the size of me, probably stuffed with ore and rare minerals. It looked‚Ä¶ uncanny, the way they hopped toward the airlock platform with the bag drifting behind the guy carrying it. Like it was deadweight, but not *heavy*.

They keyed in the activation code, then radioed the keyphrase to my room, and I hit the confirmation. The base‚Äôs announcement system echoed through the halls, alerting everyone to the gravity shift. The low hum of the station‚Äôs rotation slowed until it stopped, locking into position with the platform.

Two of the miners lifted the bag as they entered. Cycling began‚Äîoxygen restored, pressure stabilized. Then centrifugal rotation spun back up. Gravity settled.

That‚Äôs when one of the miners lost his grip.

His side of the bag dropped to the floor with a force I could *feel* through the feed. There‚Äôs no sound on the cameras, but I swear I heard the thud in my chest. A dark liquid sprayed out across his boots and pooled fast.

It was thick. Not hydraulic fluid. Not oil. Something else.

Within seconds, Research techs in yellow badges were sprinting past my hallway viewport with a cart. I glanced back to the monitor just in time to see them load the bag‚Äîquick, methodical. Way too smooth to be their first time.

I stood to get a better look as they wheeled it past my window. Down the hall. Out of sight.

No one said a word about it. Not during check-in. Not in the logs.

I know it‚Äôs probably nothing. Ore can leak, right?

I hope nothing poisonous was in the liquid that got on the floor, but they cleaned it up pretty quickly, so I‚Äôm sure it's safe.

Anyway‚Äîtonight I swapped out my bedding and noticed a huge black, maybe brownish, stain on the mattress underneath. The look of it reminded me of the leak from the bag.

So, three things:My bed‚Äôs been used and the stain looks pretty fuckin old. Two‚Äîthe mining crews are supposed to work in teams of six. Only three came in with that bag. And three‚ÄîI hadn‚Äôt really thought about it until now, but‚Ä¶ why do they need both a code *and* a keyphrase just for me to let them in?

Why lock a door that tightly unless there‚Äôs something we‚Äôre trying to keep out?

Time to sleep before I overthink it. This kind of stuff is above my pay grade. Love you.

So‚Ä¶ two more of the crew came back today?

They didn‚Äôt have a vehicle. I watched them almost robotically leap across the lunarscape toward the keypad podium. No buggy, no extra gear. Just the two of them, silhouetted against the black horizon.

They keyed in the code and gave the keyphrase over the radio‚Äîquiet, raspy, almost like their comms were breaking up. I hit the confirmation key.

The announcement sounded, gravity slowed, oxygen cycled, they came in.

Fifteen minutes later, my supervisor shows up. Doesn‚Äôt knock, doesn‚Äôt greet me‚Äîjust asks why I stopped the centrifuge.

I told him about the crew, the radio call, the docking procedure. He just‚Ä¶ stared at me. Like I‚Äôd said something wrong. Then turned around and walked out before I could even ask.

I watched him cross the corridor outside my window at a brisk, determined pace, speaking into his radio the whole way.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong‚ÄîI was worried. Still am. But no one‚Äôs said anything. Not to me, anyway.

It‚Äôs been a few hours now, and we just entered a lockdown drill.

Except they *really* stressed that we treat it like the real thing.

Doors sealed, motion lights off, auxiliary power only. No one in or out.

Something about the phrasing‚Äîthe tone‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt just a drill. It felt more like a warning.

The kind where they don‚Äôt want to say what they‚Äôre actually preparing for.

Gonna lie down and wait it out.

I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on.

Mom, Dad‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm scared.

It‚Äôs been about three weeks since my last log. I had to wait. I had to survive.

I used the 14 days of light. That‚Äôs the only time it‚Äôs safe to move around.

They don‚Äôt come out as much when the sunlight hits the exterior corridors. I think the windows‚Äîthose thick, curved panes‚Äîact like traps.

They just stop and stare, motionless, when the beams catch them.

But the inner corridors? The ones without windows?

No light reaches there.

There‚Äôs no stopping them there.

The bigger rooms‚Äîthe ones with skylights‚Äîwere safer.

For a time.

I managed to reach Ethan from IT on the short-range comms link in my office. A few times.

While he was still alive‚Ä¶

The last time we spoke, he said he‚Äôd been sleeping in the hydroponics atrium during the lightshift. That dome gets full sun exposure during the light days.

It kept him safe from the things.

We didn‚Äôt talk often, but early on, he told me enough to make some guesses.

The team leads. The high-clearance personnel.

They‚Äôre not on base anymore.

I remember it now‚Äîclear as day.

The night of the lockdown, I was already in bed when the alert came through: **Centrifugal Halt ‚Äì Platform Synchronization Inbound.**

I thought it was just another drill. I waited for the hum to return. For the soft sway of gravity to resume.

But it never came back.

Ethan told me later that week. He saw it‚Äîthrough a corridor window after he‚Äôd cracked open his cell door.

The Emergency Return shuttle lifted off from the south platform.

While we were still in full stop.

They left us here.

*All of us.*

Before I knew any of that, I‚Äôd already floated back to my office‚Äîhalf an hour of low-G silence behind me. Something felt wrong, even though I hadn‚Äôt yet realized the shuttle had left.

I keyed in my credentials. Accessed the override protocols.

I started by checking why the centrifuge hadn‚Äôt restarted. Why the platform hadn‚Äôt cycled.

But then I saw it.

The south platform wasn‚Äôt the only door with an administrator override.

The research corridors glowed orange‚Äîpathing active. Three internal doors were blinking red.

Not cycled.

Locked shut.

The only way to clear an administrator override is with a full facility reset.

That would cycle every exterior door. Re-engage gravity. And unlock every single pressurized passage across the station.

I didn‚Äôt do it.

But someone else did.

Another door tech, I‚Äôm sure.

I‚Äôm not responsible for this.

I understood what it meant when I saw the research facility manually locked down.

I understood.

Something was in the station that we couldn‚Äôt let spread.

When all of the doors unlocked, they clambered out.

Shambling *humanthings*.

I‚Äôve seen them in person now.

Incomprehensibly grotesque.

Rotted. Necrotic. Elongated joints, with hanging jaws and stringy hair.

They move like they‚Äôre searching.

Like they‚Äôre remembering.

I know they‚Äôre remembering.

Because Ethan still comes to the locked door at the end of corridor R

‚Ä¶and stares through the camera.

Straight at me. I can see his mouth moving, rambling, but I won‚Äôt go near the door.

I have to go for now.

Without many of the engineers, the station's gone into auto-backup mode. A few generators are about to cycle on in a couple minutes.

And even though I‚Äôve locked off the corridors between my cell and my office‚Ä¶ When that noise kicks up, they get agitated.

I‚Äôve got a little crawlspace behind a panel in the office I hide in, in case one of them manages to open a door again.

Pray.

 I wasn‚Äôt supposed to find this. But I did.

For days now, I‚Äôve been unlocking and relocking the admin corridors‚Äîwatching, waiting. The human things, they don‚Äôt remember their paths. They wander, bumping into walls or sealed doors, some drifting into new hallways before I shut them off. There‚Äôs one that drags a broken leg behind it, like a sack of tools. I timed its circuit through Sector D. When it was far enough down the hall, I made my move.

The door to Administrator Roan‚Äôs office was locked with a four-tier system‚Äîno easy bypass. I‚Äôve cracked two before‚Äîmaintenance overrides buried in the diagnostic logs. But this one‚Ä¶ it had a special key gate.

I thought I was screwed. Then I remembered something: Roan‚Äôs quarters.

I wasn‚Äôt shocked to find a few administrators left behind. The station layout, combined with the timing of the outbreak and subsequent evacuation, made it feel inevitable. What I didn‚Äôt expect was what I found in Roan‚Äôs quarters.

Her facility suit lay discarded on the floor, the remains of her body still inside, like she‚Äôd been eaten from the inside out. The suit‚Äôs fabric clung to her like a half-formed cocoon, and what was left of her‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even know how to describe it. Soft tissue, sloshing in my hands. I had to pry her keycard free from the inner lining of the forearm. It took a few minutes‚Äîand a lot of gagging‚Äîbut I got it.

When I made it back to the office and slotted the card into the master terminal, I thought it was all over. I was wrong.

That‚Äôs when I saw it.

A system-wide communications lockdown had been enacted during the final centrifuge cycle, just before the Emergency Return shuttle launched. Personal comms had been rerouted. Every outgoing message from standard personnel accounts was flagged as ‚Äúnonessential‚Äù and dumped into a queue.

They‚Äôre all still here.

Every message. Every cry for help.

Not just mine. Hundreds of them.

Audio. Video. Text logs. Some people were still recording even after the power started to fail in their sections.

Some of the messages are just static and sobbing. Others... Some of them talk about things that don‚Äôt make sense. Worse than what I‚Äôve seen.

There are names I don‚Äôt recognize. One man‚Äîsecurity, I think‚Äîkept saying he heard them whispering in the walls. That they knew his name. And that they remembered him.

I opened my own log queue. It was there. Everything I‚Äôve said to you. None of it ever left Pisistratus Station.

I sat there for a long time. Listening. To everyone. To no one.

There‚Äôs a backup transmission command on Roan‚Äôs computer. A hardline. The problem is, I have a list of thousands of servers to send transmissions to. I can manually clear the queue of each flagged log, but I don‚Äôt know which servers to send them to.

I think I have no choice but to send everything out. I‚Äôm hoping for help. I‚Äôm unable to establish a direct line to Earth‚Äîevery company line seems halted. I believe we were told that each transmission takes a week to reach Earth.

So, tomorrow, I‚Äôll send everything out. Today, I‚Äôll reroute some doors, maybe raid the cafeteria again. I should be good for months if I stay quiet.

I love you, Mom. Dad. I‚Äôll be home soon. ‚Äì Leon

I'm a big girl, I can deal with the dress code (not diminishing financial impact on partners at all, because those just lost their whole work wardrobe? That is messed up and sucks).  I'm grateful that about 60% of my work clothes are still within the rules.  What I can't easily deal with is stupid things like cup writing and the info graphics that tell you where each individual syrup is to be placed, and the unnecessary lobby sweep timer.  Like I've been in my store for a year and know about Siren's Eye, but I swear these layout standards are new?  Anyway, for our store type we have an abnormal layout that works well, but we don't have the same space or structure to be able to follow these standards.  However our SM scolds us for moving the creme or coffee frap base.  And the lobby sweep routine during peak???? Yesterday I was planted on ovens during peak.  Play builder had ME doing lobby sweeps! How am I considered planted if I'm being taken out of my position every 15 minutes, interrupting my flow, and having to pick it back up??? 

And I feel SO much for the leadership in stores.  Because they're being told by their higher ups they have to enact these things, they don't have a choice, but they get the brunt of our frustrations.  Why?  Because they're in the trenches with us.  They're not in some office or test center in Seattle, so incredibly disconnected from the reality of working in a coffee shop.  

@starbucks (i wish we could just @ them ugh) STOP micromanaging stores like telling me where a syrup bottle is to be.  STOP telling me that when we're doing 75+ csd's (? Whatever that acronym is) per 30 minutes, that i have to sticker and doodle, or completely stop what I'm doing to check the lobby every 15 minutes (our store isn't massive. Its fine I promise).  STOP making my manager and dm have to face our frustrations each day over stupid crap.  

I love my job.  JUST LET ME DO MY JOB. ",48,1745590784.0,starbucks,12,0.94,False

It's necessary to stop and smell the roses sometimes but to also look back at how I've had to change every facet of my life.

Rewind back to May '24, I work in the tech space so tend to do 10 hour days in high pressure/demanding  environments.  My role is customer facing so tended to be out for coffees, lunches and drinks w/ clients all the time.  I don't drink on my own, but when I'm out, I would binge drink quite often (2-3 x week).

The active lifestyle I had turned to stress, sleeping 5hrs a night, chain-smoking, hangovers, making poor food choices, and just being sedentary where on some days I would only take 3000 steps (due to being stuck to the laptop).  I was overweight and piled on the kgs and ballooned up to 95kg (im 5'8 47M for reference).

More often than not, I would of eaten out for breakfast, lunch and dinner and ignoring all the warning signs and waiting for the opportune time to try and turn it around.  Obviously, that time never came.

All it took was needing a mental health day and dragged myself to the doctor for a sick note and to ask to get my bloodwork done.  The doctor obliges and decides to take my blood pressure.  He had a look of shock as he read out my reading which was 250/145.  Funny as I've always had a history of low blood pressure til about 5yrs ago.

From there, you know the rest....

Emergency rooms, weekly cardiologist appointments, CT scans, Ultrasounds, Angiograms, blood work, cortisol tests, renal doppler tests, x-rays, endocrinologist appts, sleep specialists and more blood work.

Luckily after all of that, I was diagnosed to not have had a heart attack but my arteries was shot and had an arrythmia.  The cardiologist did tell me my plight was purely self inflicted.

Fast forward to now...

I've given up smoking, drinking, quit my job and took a role that suits my lifestyle and where I was happy in.  I've taken up intermittent fasting, eating v. clean and gave up coke zero and now only drink water only.  No more coffees, I weight train 3-4 x week, meditate, walk 10k steps daily (bought a walking pad which really helps) and get my 7-8 hours of sleep every day.  I'm now at the stage the cardiologist has got me at minimal meds and will off them pretty soon.  I'm also down 18kgs and approaching my weight I used to be 5yrs prior and have no more sleep apnea.

I don't mean to be too philosophical about my experience, but when I had a choice to make I 1000% wanted to choose LIFE!  That's translated to every facet of my daily life, and every choice I make to wholeheartedly always choose LIFE!

If you got this far... Thankyou for reading!  I appreciate being able to tell my story!

Edit - My daily meds were Moxonidine 0.2mg (AM) & 0.4mg (PM), Amlodipine 10mg and Telmisartan 80mg before cutting down.

1k7m0bb,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1k7m0bb/does_the_berkey_bk4x2bbpf2_water_filter_truly/,Does the Berkey BK4X2-BB-PF2 Water Filter Truly Deliver? Full Review,"Testing the Berkey BK4X2-BB-PF2 Big Berkey Gravity-Fed Water Filter on a daily basis was an experience I didn't know I needed until I started. Its promise of purified, fluoride, and arsenic-free water seemed too good to be true. But as someone constantly infusing hydration into my lifestyle‚Äîwhether it's for a morning cup of tea, cooking meals, or just needing great-tasting drinking water‚ÄîI can confidently say this water filter's performance left an impression.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed when unboxing this filtration system is its sleek and minimal design. The Big Berkey System fits effortlessly on my kitchen countertop with its polished stainless steel body. Measuring 19.25 inches in height and 8.5 inches wide, it doesn‚Äôt dominate the counter space. I appreciated its freestanding setup‚Äîno need to drill counters or deal with plumbing. The unit feels solid and durable, reassuring me this was built to last. Plus, its portable design made it convenient to carry when I needed to move it between rooms or take it outdoors for gathering.

**Filtration Capabilities**  
What sets this filter apart from others I‚Äôve used is the gravity-fed filtration system combined with Black Berkey Elements and Berkey PF-2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements. As a tea enthusiast, I noticed an immediate difference in taste after using the water; the unpleasant metallic tang I sometimes got from regular tap water had vanished. It boasts the ability to remove or significantly reduce over 250 contaminants, including fluoride, arsenic, and heavy metals. This feature gives me peace of mind knowing my water is safe, especially when testing its output against unfiltered tap water. Surprisingly, the unit doesn‚Äôt require electricity or complex installations‚Äîsomething I hadn‚Äôt realized I‚Äôd value so much.

**Daily Functionality and Performance**  
Using this filter daily was refreshingly simple. With a 2.25-gallon capacity, it's ideal for someone like me who drinks a lot of water, but it could comfortably serve a small family. I tested the filtered water in different scenarios‚Äîboiling pasta, making coffee, and even filling pet bowls‚Äîand the consistency in quality was undeniable. However, while the simplicity of the gravity-fed mechanism is a win, waiting for it to process large amounts of water took a bit longer than anticipated‚Äîpatience became part of my hydration process. 

[Check Berkey BK4X2-BB-PF2 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0cbvkjxnh/)

**Advantages**  
There are several highlights that stood out during my usage of this product:  
- The Black Berkey elements are long-lasting, capable of filtering up to 6,000 gallons, which spells significant savings over time.  
- The unit is economical in operation, providing filtered water at just pennies per gallon.  
- It‚Äôs entirely gravity-fed, meaning no external power sources or complex tools are needed.  
- The ability to filter out complex contaminants like heavy metals and pre-oxidized arsenic(III) outperformed cheaper alternatives I‚Äôve used in the past.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
However, as with any product, the Berkey system wasn‚Äôt without its critiques:  
- The filtration process can be slow, especially when I'm hosting guests or need water in bulk quickly.  
- Cleaning such a unit can be fiddly. Disassembling and scrubbing internal elements felt slightly tedious.  
- Replacement components like the PF-2 filters add an extra cost layer that may deter some budget-conscious users.  

**Competing Products**  
Given its premium reputation, I compared this system to other popular gravity-fed water filters like the AquaCera or the Brita Everyday. While Brita is cheaper and quicker, it doesn‚Äôt even come close to removing the arsenal of contaminants that the Big Berkey System handles. AquaCera rivals the filtration quality but lacks the same polished design and portability. If fluoride and heavy metal removal is non-negotiable, the Berkey filter remains ahead of its competition. Yet, for those who prioritize speed or ease of maintenance, a simpler Brita pitcher might suffice.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Despite its upfront cost and the expenses tied to replacement components, this filtration system provided value. Every drop of water felt like an assurance of safety and quality, which made me much less skeptical about the investment over time. Its longevity‚Äîthanks to the long filter lifespan‚Äîbalanced out what might initially seem like a splurge. If you‚Äôre hunting for a unit that guarantees superior filtration and reliability, the financial value here is clear.
