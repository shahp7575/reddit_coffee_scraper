Fala, galera, tudo bem?

Irei trocar meu notebook nessa Black Friday e gostaria da ajuda de vocês com uma dúvida. 

Meu objetivo é rodar WoW com o gráfico no máximo e liso, e precisa mesmo ser um note (já para evitar os comentários de “esquece o note e pega um PC”). 

Olhando as configurações recomendadas do WoW, (vou colocar ao final do post para facilitar) penso que o ideal seria algo como o Acer Predator Helios Neo, que conta com o seguinte: Intel Core i I7-13650hx, 16GB RAM, RTX 4060, SSD 512GB. Uma outra opção que pensei foi o Dell G15, mas ele vem no máximo com uma RTX 4050 de 6GB (o Acer tem 8GB). Ambos estão na faixa de R$ 8.500,00. 

Minha primeira dúvida seria se esses notes seria suficiente para rodar WoW no máximo. 

A segunda seria se teriam alguma indicação melhor nessa faixa de preço de até uns 9k. A depender 10k. 

A terceira é se conseguiria rodar WoW no máximo e liso com um note de configuração mais baixa (consequentemente mais barato). Se sim, qual configuração/notebook indicariam?

Poderiam me ajudar?

Side Effects and Dosage Adjustment,"I’ve recently started taking Lexapro (10mg) for anxiety, and I’ve been on it for about three weeks now. I had a few questions and was hoping for some advice. I’m experiencing a lot of fatigue, especially in the mornings, and it’s hard to get through the day. Is this a common side effect at this stage? If so, does it usually go away?

My doctor mentioned that if I don’t feel improvement soon, they might increase my dose to 15mg. Has anyone else had their dosage increased, and did it help with symptoms? I’m a bit nervous about potential side effects getting worse. take a magnesium supplement in the evenings and sometimes drink coffee in the morning. Are there any interactions I should be aware of with these?

it’s a subject i know nothing about.

i’ve had the worst year of my life and i don’t think my brain actually picked up on anything as i was focused on everything else. as much as i tried to, because i want to do well, i guess my brain wasn’t registering it.

math isn’t my strong suit. i tried the same exam three times and failed every single time a year ago. now i’m taking a statistics class for psychology.

i have no idea where to start, what my schedule should be even when i’ve tried making one. i used to be able to study and do work so easily, i love scheduling. but i’m so burnt out after 14 weeks of agony and insane levels of stress i have never experienced before. i’m trying so hard to do work but i can’t. i’m relying on caffeine so hard but not even a monster + a cup of coffee has been helping.

i’ve changed rooms to a more comfortable environment to study and that kinda helped but it didn’t last long. today i did read and recap on key stuff but i’m scared because it’s not memorised and my exam is closed book.

i am so scared, i think i’m close to crying, i couldn’t sleep last night, please help me. i can’t fail, i can’t repeat this class.

i just need it in my short term memory, what can i do?",2,1730628088.0,studytips,0,1.0,False

And meanwhile I found out that tea brewing is also in itself a huge world and rabbit hole. 

I can not handle to hobbies at once, but I want to give it a try. 

My father drinks tulsi tea, and I was thinking of trying a different brewing method for him. 
Currently what we do is just put water and loose leaf tea in a vessel and put it above the stove and after a while once the water is boiled it is filtered with simple sieve into a cup. My father also puts a lot of sugar. 

Now as I take almost an hour in brewing my own coffee, I feel like this is not the best way to make tea. 
It is probably over extracted and that's why he has to put that much sugar. 

So I want to brew tea for him once using a Frenchpress. I think it will work but I just don't know the ratio, temp, and steep time.

Ideally how much loose tea leaf I'm supposed to use and how much water I'm supposed to put,
And how much time should I let it steep. 

I do have scale for coffee so I can use that for measuring tea and water with 0.1gm of accuracy. 

I hope someone can guide me on how to do this. 

For the record,
We have ""organic India classic tulsi green tea""

I (25F) usually just tell them directly, but with this one guy (31M) i’m having a hard time. We started off as friends, then he started becoming more and more interested. At first we only met once a week at a tea society meeting (more like a local meet up) that has over 15 people, then he started inviting me out to eat on our own, and i said yes at first because i didn’t want to immediately assume it’s a date when he hasn’t said so. I am new to this country and he’s a local so at first i thought he wanted to show me local food. Also he asked me in person like “someday we can try this restaurant” so how was i supposed to say “no i’m busy all days”. 

However, now im stuck, he’s continuously asking me out for food and i make excuses whenever i can but sometimes i have to say yes. and he plans a lot of things, and i just sit and nod. 

yesterday we were having coffee and he said he feels tense around me because he likes me, i just chuckled. what do you even say to that? 

Today i didn’t go to the weekly tea society meeting but he called me after to ask if i wanted to eat dinner, i said i ate already and that im actually studying right now. 

i need a way to tell him but not ruin the atmosphere in the weekly meetings (there’s two different ones) and also not make him upset with me. ",1,1730627769.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

I'm moving into a new apartment and could really use some help with designing my living room! It’s on the smaller side, and I’m having trouble figuring out a layout that works with my furniture and space constraints. I’d love to hear your advice or thoughts on the arrangement I’m considering.

**The Situation:**

* The room’s current design has the sofa on the left wall and the TV on the right, close to the balcony door , but my 65-inch TV won’t fit there.

1. **Sofa**: The one in the picture is a bigger version; I’d be getting the smaller model (dimensions in the draft).
2. **Coffee Table**: It’s a bit large, but I love the quality and the feature where the top plate can lift towards the sofa – perfect for eating!
3. **Dining Table**: This table is extendable; it’s normally round like in the draft but can extend by 45 cm (1'5.7"") to an oval shape for more seating when I have guests.

**The Challenge:**

I’m worried the room will feel too crowded, especially since the sofa and coffee table are fairly large. I can’t move the sofa too far back without blocking access to the kitchen cabinets on the left side. Ideally, I’d like to move the sofa even closer to the TV for more dining space, but I’m not sure if that’s feasible.

Any ideas on optimizing this space? Or suggestions on how to make everything feel less cramped? Any opinions on color choice of sofa/tables are appreciated, too. I'd actually prefer a bit darker version of the sofa to be honest. Thank you!",1,1730627722.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False

1gijg6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesHoffmann/comments/1gijg6q/making_sense_of_tea_coming_from_coffee/,"Making sense of tea, coming from coffee","I first discovered the world of specialty coffee 8 years ago and it's been an incredible journey. I've gotten so much joy out of experimenting with brew methods, ratios and also enjoying the various communities surrounding coffee. 

This journey with coffee made me more curious about tea, and so I've dabbled with various teas and had a great time as well, but compared to coffee, I find the world of tea to be impenetrable. Mainly I feel this is probably due to the amount of variety in processing and types of teas. You can buy a new tea and search for guidelines on how to best brew it, but you'll be met with so many different variations that seem opposed to one another. Often the instructions can be as vague as ""brew one tablespoon to one cup"", lacking any weight or temperature measurements. 

There are also some practices that are mind-boggling coming from the world of coffee, such as brewing a single serving of tea multiple times. This is a traditional method of brewing tea, but it's something that I have a hard time understanding from a technical point of view. Wouldn't you want to maximize the extraction in a single brew like we do for coffee?

Sourcing tea is another problem. It's difficult to judge the quality of the tea you are getting. The prices have so much variation and there's no clear communication regarding when it was harvested or the freshness of the tea. How do you determine whether the price is worth it?

I feel like a lot of these issues stem from tea being a lot more diverse and complex than coffee. There are so many varieties of tea, so it's hard to really have the same kind of standardization. I'm not saying that there's a ""correct"" way to brew tea, but having some technical understanding of it would help adjust the recipe to your own taste.

To me it feels like tea is in a similar place to where coffee was before things like extraction/roasting/ratios/equipment became more widely understood. Sometimes I wish there was a James Hoffmann-like to help me better understand and enjoy tea. 

I'd love to hear anyone else's experience/advice regarding tea.",3,1730627633.0,JamesHoffmann,0,1.0,False

I (25F) usually just tell them directly, but with this one guy (31M) i’m having a hard time. We started off as friends, then he started becoming more and more interested. At first we only met once a week at a tea society meeting (more like a local meet up) that has over 20 people, then he started inviting me out to eat on our own, and i said yes at first because i didn’t want to immediately assume it’s a date when he hasn’t said so. I am new to this country and i he’s a local so at first i thought he wanted to show me local food. 
However, now im stuck, he’s continuously asking me out for food and i make excuses whenever i can but sometimes i have to say yes. and he plans a lot of things, and i just sit and nod. 

yesterday we were having coffee and he said he feels tense around me because he likes me, i just chuckled. what do you even say to that? 

Today i didn’t go to the weekly tea society meeting but he called me after to ask if i wanted to eat dinner, i said i ate already and that im actually studying right now. 

i need a way to tell him but not ruin the atmosphere in the weekly meetings (there’s two different ones) and also not make him upset with me. Men, how would you want a girl to approach this situation? ",3,1730627592.0,AskMen,11,0.67,False

1gijdhm,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ScienceStyled/comments/1gijdhm/pixelpunks_and_digital_defiance_why_augmented/,Pixel-Punks and Digital Defiance: Why Augmented Reality Graffiti is the Only Art that Matters Now (Obviously),"Graffiti. Once the notorious art of rule-breakers and night prowlers, today’s ""graffiti artist"" is that scrawny kid next door with more interest in digital apps than in actual spray cans. Now, I get it—some of you are still clinging to spray-painted brick walls, still swooning over the “good ol’ days” of tagging bridges and subway cars. How quaint. Well, brace yourselves, because Augmented Reality graffiti (yes, that's AR for you analog dinosaurs) is here to yank art kicking and screaming into the digital age. That’s right; the fusion of street art and digital technology isn’t just a fad. It’s *the* evolutionary leap. Like, if a Neanderthal tried TikTok, they’d finally get why AR graffiti is the next logical step for [technology and art](https://sciencestyled.com/category/technology/). You’re welcome.

Now, let’s crack open that brain of yours and upload some enlightenment on the topic of AR graffiti, the glorious lovechild of street art and digital wizardry that you never knew you needed. Imagine the art’s still there, kind of, except it's pixelated, floating around like a glitchy Pokémon in a layer of the world you can only see if you’ve got the right app. Some might call it magic. I call it intellectual superiority.

First, allow me to revolutionize your understanding of graffiti’s historical roots. Back in the ancient days of—oh, let’s call it, the ’70s—graffiti was all about human expression on surfaces: walls, fences, the side of your grandma’s Buick (a true artist’s canvas, clearly). A “real” graffiti artist risked it all, scaling walls, evading cops, and wielding spray cans with the kind of finesse usually reserved for sword-fighting. Fast-forward to now, and graffiti has gone digital, evolving into AR: a perfect combination of art and technology where artists slap their work on walls that technically don’t even exist in “reality.” Yeah, that’s right. Graffiti just upgraded to 2.0 and ditched all that, well, physicality. Because, really, who needs tangible surfaces when you can have pixels, right?

Now, if you’re wondering how exactly this AR graffiti works, allow me to dumb it down. Think of it as a Snapchat filter but on a wall. Mind-blowing, isn’t it? A street artist tags an “empty” space with digital paint, and anyone who bothers to look through their phone’s camera can see it. It’s like an interactive Easter egg, except no one asked for it, and no one actually needs it. But that’s what makes it art! You can only access it with your phone, which instantly transforms the casual viewer into a connoisseur of technology and art, even if they’re just some random kid scrolling through Instagram.

Let’s throw a few legendary AR graffiti names your way. Take INSA, an artist who took GIF-ITI (that’s graffiti, but GIF-ified) to a global level by painting huge murals in four different countries and stitching them into animated masterpieces. Yes, it was as ludicrous as it sounds, but that’s what art is all about. And then there’s KATSU, who traded in his trusty spray can for a drone because why vandalize one wall when you could aerial-bomb a hundred? He hacked a drone to carry spray paint and started his drone art rampage, basically asserting his dominance over any mere mortal bound to the ground. With AR, this sort of “tagging” is as easy as swiping right. It’s like the modern-day version of Da Vinci, except instead of “The Last Supper,” we get a floating digital banana wearing sunglasses. High art, people. Respect it.

AR graffiti also opens the art world to the masses, even if most people didn’t ask for it. Imagine it: you’re walking down Main Street, just trying to get a coffee, and boom—there’s a digital mural hanging mid-air, and it’s begging you to stop and appreciate it. Like your phone doesn’t have enough going on already. But here’s the twist: AR graffiti has no gatekeepers. Any random bystander with a smartphone can engage with it. Suddenly, we’re all art critics, even that guy who believes Banksy is an overpriced coffee brand. No need for entry fees, no velvet ropes. AR graffiti breaks down the walls—oh wait, there were no walls to begin with. We’re in the Matrix, and the art is calling you.

Of course, as with anything fun and potentially disruptive, AR graffiti has its fair share of naysayers and controversies. Oh, the *drama*—city councils wringing their hands about “virtual vandalism,” as if a floating pixel-pigeon was somehow going to deface the national monuments. They say, “What if someone puts an offensive AR piece on top of a public building?” Well, first off, Karen, it’s digital. You can switch it off. Secondly, that’s the whole point of art! It’s supposed to push boundaries, make people uncomfortable, and cause exactly this kind of pearl-clutching panic. Think about it—what’s the worst that could happen? Someone digitally paints a middle finger on the Eiffel Tower? It’s temporary. Unlike those tragic Instagram murals, which are permanent and, frankly, way more offensive.

Some artists argue AR graffiti isn’t “real” graffiti because it lacks that gritty, rebel edge—oh please. We’re in 2024, folks. Virtual is the new real. And if anything, AR graffiti is more rebellious because it thumbs its nose at both art “purists” and local authorities without so much as a paint drop. It's vandalism without consequence, the absolute nightmare of every boomer who still doesn’t know how to close tabs on their browser. Think of AR graffiti as the cousin of deepfake technology. Except instead of making Tom Cruise do the Macarena, we’re making dogs with monocles hover next to office buildings. *Artistic genius,* I know.

And yet, despite the purists’ whining, AR graffiti is revolutionizing public art. Forget those dusty museums filled with statues and oil paintings of dead people. AR graffiti gives us art that’s *living*—well, at least as living as a piece of digital software can be. Street art was always meant to belong to everyone, and with AR, it finally can. No more “highbrow, lowbrow” nonsense; no more pretentious curators deciding what counts as “worthy” of public attention. If a guy with a cellphone wants to project a 3D Bart Simpson onto the White House lawn, who’s stopping him? Certainly not the ghost of Andy Warhol. This is the ultimate democratization of art, my friends, whether or not you’re ready to face it.

And so we reach the grand finale. (Did you feel that? That was sarcasm—tremble appropriately.) AR graffiti, this magnificent hybrid of technology and art, is reshaping public spaces right under our noses, and we’re all too busy scrolling to notice. While some still romanticize the days of brick and mortar, AR graffiti is taking us into a world where art isn’t bound by walls, and creativity can spill into any nook or cranny of our shared digital universe. We’re talking art that lives in your phone, can teleport across cities, and doesn’t need so much as a drop of actual paint. It’s a new era of street art that’s brilliant, irreverent, and maybe even slightly terrifying.

So the next time you’re out and about, pretend you know what’s going on in this “fusion of street art and digital tech.” Show off your AR graffiti knowledge to your baffled friends, declare yourself an authority, and roll your eyes if they ask too many questions. After all, the future of art has arrived—and it’s as digital, disruptive, and unapologetically absurd as you always knew it would be. And if anyone questions the validity of AR graffiti? Just tell them it’s “post-modern.” Works every time.",1,1730627289.0,u_ScienceStyled,0,1.0,False

**Devotional: Rooted in Christ: Cultivating Lasting Friendships Through Faith**

**Scripture Reading:**  
“Therefore, as you received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him, rooted and built up in him and established in the faith, just as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.” — Colossians 2:6-7 (ESV)

- - - - - -

**Reflection:**

Friendship is one of life’s greatest blessings, a source of joy, comfort, and companionship. However, genuine friendships that withstand the test of time often require a solid foundation—one that can only be established through Christ. As we explore our relationships and strive to cultivate deep, lasting friendships, we must remember to root ourselves in Christ.

Colossians 2:6-7 invites us to walk in Christ and be rooted in Him. When we root ourselves in Christ, we not only deepen our relationship with Him but also lay a strong foundation for our connections with others. Like the roots of a tree that dig down into the soil for nourishment and stability, our friendships grow strong when they are nourished by our shared faith.

**Prayer:**

Heavenly Father, thank You for the gift of friendship. Help me to cultivate relationships that are rooted in Your love and grace. Teach me to reflect Your character in my friendships and seek out connections with those who encourage me in my walk with You. May our time together be filled with laughter, support, and a desire to grow in faith. Amen.

**Study:**

1. **Recognize the Importance of Fellowship**: In the early church, believers gathered together frequently to share their lives and strengthen each other’s faith. Acts 2:42 tells us they devoted themselves to fellowship, prayer, and breaking bread. Consider how communal gatherings, whether in small groups or larger congregations, can bolster your faith and cultivate friendships.
2. **Embrace Vulnerability**: Lasting friendships require honesty and vulnerability. As you share your life with friends, be open about your struggles and successes in your faith journey. This openness invites deeper connection and allows your friendships to thrive.
3. **Encourage One Another**: In Hebrews 10:24-25, we are encouraged to stir one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together. Let your friendships be a space where you can uplift one another, pray for each other, and hold each other accountable in your faith. Be intentional in reaching out to your friends to support and pray for them.
4. **Cultivate Patience and Grace**: No relationship is perfect. Just as Christ extends grace to us, we too must extend grace to our friends. Learn to forgive and communicate openly when misunderstandings arise. This patience will fortify your friendships and deepen your bonds.
5. **Pray Together**: There is immense power in praying with and for your friends. Make it a habit to pray together, whether in person or through messages. This practice not only strengthens your spiritual bond but also deepens trust and intimacy in the relationship.

**Action Step:**

This week, reach out to a friend and propose a day or time to meet for fellowship—whether it’s coffee, a walk, or a simple phone call. Use this intentional time to encourage one another in faith, share testimonies of God’s goodness, and pray together. Let it be an opportunity to plant deeper roots in your friendship through Christ.

**Closing Thought:**

May our friendships reflect the heart of Christ—selfless, uplifting, and rooted in love. As we seek to understand and live according to His word, let us remember that we are also being called to cultivate lasting friendships that honor Him. Rooted in faith, we can grow together, becoming more like Christ and enriching one another’s lives along the way.

If we're playing sport, partner doesn't join in as they have a physical disability, but still expected to come along for some reason. Actually, I get along quite well with her partner also and wouldn't mind it sometimes. But it's all the time. And the few times when her partner doesn't come, she complains that they didn't come that day and wanted to stay home and doesn't want to spend time with her....like, isn't that ok though? Tbh, I'm single at the moment, but I couldn't stand bringing my partner with me to everything I do like that. She never asks or mentions it either, I'll invite her to coffee and then they're both there. It's annoying because I think ""what if I wanted to discuss something kind of private with you?"" and also, most of the time I just feel like I'm a third wheel on someone else's date, which is uncomfortable. We are all late 30s and her and her partner have been together some time, so not like it's that youthful infatuation people have in early relationships. I know there's no point discussing it without creating very hurt feelings and animosity, so I'm just a lot more ""busy"" and not catching up with her as much.

But.... this isn't normal right? It feels exhausting and extreme to me.",2,1730626681.0,AITAH,10,1.0,False

Sometimes I’ll stay, other times due to alternative commitments such as work, I’ll stay late into the evening/early hours and then leave.

My problem is that I keep falling asleep.

Often we’ll eat, and then no matter what position I’m in, I will almost instantaneously become very sleepy and then just fall asleep. He sometimes tries to wake me, but often only enough so that I’m semi-conscious and not answering in a way that I usually would.

Then eventually he’ll wake me up to get ready for bed or because he’s going to go to bed, and it hits me that I have wasted the entire time I’ve had with him by being asleep.

To be clear, I think he wouldn’t mind it occasionally.

But lately it is every time, even the times when I feel energised arriving to his house. It’s starting to get in the way of our intimate life and it makes me feel less close to him. I’m concerned he thinks it is my decision to choose sleep over him, which absolutely is not the case - but equally I can see from his perspective how annoying it must be.

I’ve tried coffee, it doesn’t do anything. Energy drinks I should be avoiding due to a possible mild heart condition I could have.

How can I improve my behaviour to demonstrate to him that I value him and his time more than I value sleep?",1,1730626610.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

Hi everyone.

I have been going insane over this for a year and a half, and I don't know what to do.

My boyfriend ""Tom"" (27m) and I (26f) have been together for two years. 

When our relationship started he was still in contact with his ex-gf who lives overseas. They would have long video calls, say *""I love you"" ""I miss you""*, use pet names, and their messages called back to the nostalgia of their relationship. For months he refused to tell her about me. We fought over this, and I even broke up with him once over it, but Tom said they were *""just friends""* and I didn't understand because I was *""naive and insecure""*, since I had never had a serious relationship before.

This went on for about 6 months, and then one night Tom met a woman ""Camila"" (30f) at a party. A male friend of ours was there and he told me the two of them spent most of the night flirting and talking, and they even left together. He chased them outside to confront Tom, saying *""dude, don't you have a girlfriend? what the fuck are you doing?""* Tom claims he was helping her get home because she was really drunk. They shared a taxi, and when Tom got home he boasted drunkenly to me about how *""the prettiest girl at the party only wanted to talk to him""*. I looked her up and saw they had connected on social media.

(Camila later told me that at this party, Tom had said he was in a bad relationship and he was going to leave; *""I love my girlfriend, but it just isn't working out. She's controlling and difficult, and she doesn't let me have female friends.""* Presumably this was in reference to his ex.)

3 months later, things were much better between Tom and I. He had stopped talking to his ex. Then one night he came home at 3am and said *""baby, I fucked up.""*

I've spoken to both Tom and Camila about what happened. Tom gives slightly different versions of the story each time, and I only had one convo with Camila over messenger. 

Supposedly what happened is this: Tom was managing a late-night cocktail bar at the time. Camila came into his bar with a friend, he gave her free drinks, and then after he clocked off (at midnight) he stayed at the bar to hang out with her (even though he had promised me he'd be home at 12:30). Tom and Camila left the bar together and went to a quiet park, where they talked. Then, they went to another bar, had more drinks, and took a taxi to her house. Her own boyfriend and baby were sleeping inside, so they sat in her parked car. They kissed again. Then Tom left and came home.

Tom's version of events is that Camila was manipulative. He claims she said *""Come and see me after you finish."" ""I really need to talk to you.. my boyfriend cheated on me."" ""Can we go somewhere private?"" ""I feel a strong connection with you, ever since the party. Our souls are connected."" ""I'm old, nobody wants me anymore.""* and cried to him. He says she tried to kiss him at the park and the second bar, but he kept saying no. Apparently he told her, *""things are going well with my girlfriend and I don't want to cheat on her"".* He ordered her a taxi but she suggested they share since they lived so close. At this point, they were both drunk.

Tom says Camila *""jumped him""* and kissed him suddenly as soon as the taxi started moving. He kissed her back for a couple of seconds. Then she said *""Now you have cheated on your girlfriend, and if you don't tell her I will.""* He was freaking out in the taxi saying *""what have I done?""* and Camila said *""Just get out at my house, and we can talk about it.""* 

She gave him more beers, and they smoked some weed. They sat in the car and she talked about being a *""wilted flower""* after having a baby. Tom reassured her she was beautiful (not for the first time that night) and allegedly she climbed astride him, sat on his lap, and they kissed passionately for about 30 seconds. Tom says they then had an argument where he told her she was just as bad as her partner, and he left. 

He said he felt manipulated and *""didn't really want to do it""* but got seduced because he was drunk, she was pretty, and he felt bad for her. But another time, when I asked him why he did it, he said *""because I thought I could get away with it""*. Recently he's been saying it was sexual assault, and the reason he gets so angry whenever I bring it up is because it's triggering for him to think about it. To be fair, I have seen Tom struggle to say no to people.

Camila's story differs; she says she didn't know Tom worked at the bar, and that it was his idea to go to another bar together. She said it was equal from both sides, and *""I'm not a crazy woman forcing a guy to come into my car and kiss me.""* She doesn't remember the kiss in the taxi. She said they didn't have sex. She claims it was her who decided to say goodnight and go inside, but Tom said he wanted her to stay because he was really enjoying hanging out in the car. Apparently, he had told her that night that he was going to break up with me, and said that our relationship still wasn't working out. 

I was so upset with Camila after it first happened that I totally burned the bridge (I told her boyfriend). I'd love to go for coffee with her now and ask her to tell me what happened in person, but she almost certainly would tell me to fuck off. It's been ages too...

So I'm left trying to figure out if Tom was actually sexually assaulted or is lying about it to get away with cheating. I really want to get this right because if he was assaulted, I'm a giant dickhead for being so angry about it. But if he's lying about that, then he's a piece of shit and I should leave him.

I stayed with him because he came clean straight away, and it was just a kiss. But it has haunted me for a year and a half, and I don't know what to do.

I'm aware that if the roles were reversed, and it was a woman in Tom's shoes saying she was pressured by an older man, people would be more willing to see it as assault. But with them being so into each other at the party, and Tom's behaviour with his ex.. it just doesn't really add up.

What do you think? Do you think Tom was sexually coerced, or is he a liar and a cheater? How can I go about understanding this situation so I can do the right thing? ",0,1730626404.0,relationship_advice,15,0.5,False

I have some beans from Glitch Coffee based in Japan. I’ve went to Glitch and had a Colombian light roast coffee;  breathtakingly delicious. Notes of melon, coconut, brown sugar. I had no idea coffee could taste that good. 

Of course I bought some beans to take home, and wow. I haven’t had nearly the same tasting experience as I did in Japan. I get some notes of melon, but overall it’s just not hitting the same. I’ve ground the coffee as fine as I could and shots still come out in less than 20 seconds. I tried a different ratio of 1:3 and it still didn’t taste right; sourness is always overpowering the melon notes that I’m getting. 

Come to think of it I’ve always had issues dialing in lighter roasts. Any tips?

What would you do?,"This is what a homeless man screamed in my face when I asked if he would like prayer. ""You ruined my *@&$?!/ life!""
 My church was evangelizing in our local city a few weeks back. We offer free coffee, prayer, Bibles. I've gone 3 times now and everytime there is great despair and hopelessness that a 1-5 minute exchange is tough to deliver what one may call a successful message. For context the man did come and get coffee, I did ask him what brought him downtown tonight and I didn't know he was homeless so that was not the best intro I am learning. After serving him. I asked if he had any prayer requests and he screamed at me. Now I didn't respond with anything but ""I'm sorry"". He then stormed away. I have my own thoughts since then. I actually have considered it from his view. I am sure a lot of churches just pop in and out with their happiness and joy and warm clothes with full bellies and make lots of claims to them and disappear. Perhaps they have been through the housing programs and can't stay sober. Perhaps in and out of jail. Divorce, health issues, loss of family, natural disasters. My heart aches for the broken spirit and yet, I can pray for him! He doesn't know that I pray for him daily and am using his outburst for good! I see now that prayer alone in those moments is what James 2 is talking about. These people have no faith but I do. Prayer is going to change this man's life but to see the love and compassion of a Christian is all the more for both the servant, the needy and the Master. 

“What use is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but he has no works? Can that faith save him? If a brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily food, and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and be filled,” and yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body, what use is that? Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead by itself. But someone will say, “You have faith; and I have works. Show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works.” You believe that God is one. You do well; the demons also believe, and shudder. But are you willing to recognize, you foolish fellow, that faith without works is useless? Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar? You see that faith was working with his works, and as a result of the works, faith was perfected. And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “And Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness,” and he was called the friend of God. You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone. And in the same way, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way? For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.”

I believe we need to build our ministry in the city. Yes preaching the gospel will save those with the right soil but to walk in the spirit I think the second mile is to provide some food, clothing, resources and just to listen. I know it's easier said than done but I have definitely been lead by His word to refine my service. Prayer is what opened my heart to the deeper interaction I had with this man.

1gij5ui,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAustralian/comments/1gij5ui/australian_doctorssurgeons_please_advise/,Australian doctors/surgeons please advise.,"Just over a year ago in September I severed 2 of my fingers on my dominant hand and around Christmas I was just so overwhelmed with everything that I stopped attending physio because I thought I was making great progress.

Fast forward to now and those two fingers are completely curled into my palm with zero movement from the 2nd (not major) knuckle down. I believe it's called claw syndrome. My question is; is this something I can reverse by myself or do I need to go back to the hand hospital and have another procedure done and actually keep up with my physio therapy this time around?

Also what are the chances of recovery or am I able to nominate to have them removed since I have found prosthetic fingers online within a very decent price point that are operated entirely from the remaining stump and palm to facilitate flexing and relaxing movements which would greatly improve my ability and recovery time allowing me to work my field once more and to even hold basic things like my computer mouse or coffee cups.

I know I really should go directly to the hospital and ask them in person but because I put it off and neglected the physio myself I was wanting to know possible outcomes and solutions before I waste another specialists time and put myself into a waiting list looking at my fingers which I have unfortunately damaged their hard work myself by not listening to the professionals.",6,1730626285.0,AskAnAustralian,9,0.75,False
1gij5hv,https://i.redd.it/iisorb3conyd1.png,Me: Can we get the LMLM? Wife: We have the LMLM at home,"Jokes aside.

I'm seeking for a solution and shortlisted the Bianca V3, Micra or Mini. (I have a 078s & the Niche for grinding)

The factors that are giving me analysis-paralysis 
1. Heat up time (6-10 doubleshots at random times, milk occasionally)
2. Bloom/Pre-infusion, I enjoy huge varieties of lights Ethiopian beans to charcoal-burnt beans and anything in between.
3. Aesthetics. Satisfied with the E61 types but in love with the Mini (2022 legacy).
4. Price

So the issue lies in my perceived ""Value"", not price - and I can't seem to settle.

The Bianca V3 is (1850USD for chrome, or 2000USD for the new [champagne gold](https://assets.breville.com/Lelit/PESBN03/Gold+Edition/Carousel+-+Bianca+Gold.png)

Micra @ 3600USD
Mini Legacy 2022 (fancy design + protouch wand) @ 4600USD

While the Micra fits most of what I want, the extra 1k USD for the Legacy Mini is a desirable colour and comes with the protouch wand, EXCEPT it's 20-30mins (and obviously overkill) vs ~10m for the Micra to be temp stable.
On the other hand the Micra's cup space/app dependence and additional plastic stuff (unsure about long term reliability) is worth the 1k in savings.

I'm bilingual and use mandarin fluently, this matters because I use Tmall/Taobao well, and there are china E61 machines that are similar feature-wise, and [quite a beauty](https://s.alicdn.com/@sc04/kf/H211158afa1ca49c0b91ca648a9a4f21es.png_720x720q50.png), this Gemilai one (somewhat proven brand) and this supplier sells parts and E61 techs in my country are 'easily' found, so covered on the maintenance front. It's 1400USD, and it's everything most coffee-enthusiasts needs. Double boiler, E61, PID, Flow Control, Pre-infusion, rotary, manometer.

I value..well, 'Value' the most. Aesthetics a close second but I'll lump the two up into my definition of Value. 

My compass points towards the Gemilai 3124X if I were to stick to a stepping stone for a few years, then maybe the Bengle? GS3? Or the Micra for longer term, which I fear buyer's remove vs a Mini which I fear the 20-30m wait time is a real issue.

That's the end of my rant/advice seeking. I know this needs some internal reflection to truly find an answer, but I'd like some additional voices in my head please!

But I just need experience and relative time dimensions, the psych is not the most reachable person. 

But I work at worst 5pm-4am and best 10-4 or even a slightly earlier close. 

Which means typically I wanna sleep when I'm done with work, I don't want to ""crash"" off the meds ( I was on fast release methyl for about 10 months prior to this and up to 10mg from 5, and told) next week to start on 20.

So simple maths says I should be asleep by 7, and up by 3. But this is never consistent and I want to start taking my meds a bit more consistently and routined. I only work at a bar at the moment and I'm looking to change that, though it's not so simple. 

But that also requires doing stuff during my day to find a new job. I'd want to have a productive time before work but also again not be crashing out by 4am. How should I be going about it, from experience would help, and the best advice I get is in the morning. 

I'd add while on my first day I did from 2:45 after already being awake to walk and get my meds about an hour+, ""today"" I woke up late about 5, immediately took the meds then had breakfast. And it's now like 9am and I'm not sure if it's coffee or medicine or comfort that's got me like this

I have personally checked (Or played) a decent chunk of these games but not all so I cannot assure 100% accuracy as I take a lot of peoples word for it.

Completion tracking is not what this is for, it is for the console/steam achievements being present ingame.  Thus, for example, Saints Row is out as it has a 100% completion tracker but NOT the actual achievements.

Do any of you wonderful people have ideas for how to make today/tomorrow memorable or different to the other 100 attempts I’ve made at quitting? (Tomorrow will be day 1 again). 

I’m thinking, I could have a drink to celebrate tonight (I don’t drink usually), or buy a coffee and tip it out, or write a breakup letter to caffeine 😂 I don’t really know. I’m hoping you all will have a greater idea than mine.

My mom's joined reddit y'all. This little lady, almost 60, has listened to me talk about reddit every now and then. She'd always ask questions about how it worked and about what topics people talked, and now she downloaded the app herself. Obviously I think it's hilarious, but more so super adorable that she's trying to share my interests. 

But, reddit kan be a scary place and she has an innocent heart of gold, so I'd like to have a list of ""safe"" subs she could join and I'd love your help. If I tell you what she's like and what she loves, could you suggest your fave subs that you'll think fit her? 

My mom: Dutch, almost 60, single, loves to read on her Kobo, likes to drink her coffee in the garden in the sun, she's very active, hikes regularly (she's done 2 caminos, alone!), likes going to the movies with her best friend, she's a elementary school assistent and teaches kids with learning difficulties and helps refugee kids with learning our language. She does puzzles and boardgames and she likes Netflix in the evening when she's all done around the house.

1giionz,https://www.reddit.com/r/pens/comments/1giionz/looking_for_pen_recommendation_in_india/,looking for pen recommendation in india,"bit of background: i have chronic tendonitis i have tried splints and multi vitamins nothing works so i have to work with it. i also have adhd so my brain is rambling on and on and i need to slow down the pace a bit. currently a masters student and i need to write a lot everyday and the tendonitis doesnt help. most days the base of my thumb is too swollen to even hold a pen

things i like:-thick body like those of marker-zebra blen is the perfect thickness -nice soft grips so its easier to hold and my fingers dont slip. and bonus points if the grip is longer i like to hold the pen a bit closer to the tip

* slightly rougher flow octane gel,muji 0.38 and zebra blen are great examples -a bit on the cheaper side i need to write a lot and it sort of becomes a burden when a new refill is 90rs each -finer tips i prefer a 0.3 or 0.5 of ball point pens

pens i have tried:

* trimax- used it during school and those who know it was the best pen the flow was good and it was fine the only problem was that it didnt have grips and my fingers often slipped
* octane gel- overall good but a lil thinner and the grip isnt very grippy if you get it .
*  \-pentel energel- 0.7 hated it . no grip hated the whole experiece but the hegagon design was good
*  \-uni click gel- again 0.7and horrible but great thickness and grip actually used it guring graduation
*  \-zebra blen 0.5 - amazing overall the grip was good can down near the tip nice thickness and the perfect amount of smoothness but its too costly in  india
*  \-muji 0.38- thickness is good but no grip and the refills run out too quickly for soemthing thats costs 60rs

📍Advent Business Center, Acacia St., Cebu City\
🕕 8AM - 9PM

Note: this is a late review since I went to Capu Coffee earlier this year, even before I knew the existence of r/ceburestaurantreviews, so this may contain some info that may be updated. Thought I’d give a quick disclosure!

What I ordered:\
☕️ Filter: Mecca Kiandu AB (₱220): this was prepared with a Kalita wave 155 tsubame dripper. The tasting notes include boysenberry and sarsaparilla, but because I don’t know how those taste like, let me just use other descriptors. 😆 It was bright (read: kinda acidic) but a bit subdued, probably because a flat dripper was used. I remember still needing some sweets to kind of balance out the taste, though. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\
☕️ Strawberry Latte (₱190): strawberry purée + milk. That’s literally how it tasted like. The strawberry garnish wasn’t the sweet kind, but that’s ok because the milk balances it out. ⭐️⭐️⭐️\
🍰Ube Creme Cake (₱210): the highlight of the order. Not too sweet with a good ratio of cake to cream. Some bakeries sometimes have too much cream/icing compared to the layered cakes and overpowers the flavor of the cake itself, but not this one. This was perfect. We loved it so much we bought a whole cake for my mom’s birthday. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\
🧁 Mango Tartlet: I can’t remember much, not even the price. The things that I remembered were that: the tart base was crumbly, it needed more filling and it was gone before I could make a firm conclusion on the taste 😆

What I love:\
🖊️ Service: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Waiters were responsive\
🖊️ Aesthetic/Instagrammability: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ jet black+industrial gray color palette with wood accents. It’s like… if the Flair58 aesthetic was translated to a café. Looks very sleek and modern on camera.\
🖊️ Price range: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ very reasonable. If you want to try filter coffee without a hefty price tag, you can probably try their brews here.\

Special mention on the coffee gears: ⭐️⭐️⭐️ Kalita wave 155, Brewista kettle, a modded bar. Pretty decent if you ask me.

What I don’t really like much:\
🖊️the location. Tuyoon siya. And you’ll have to help your taxi driver navigate to be able to reach the place.\
🖊️ food variety: I haven’t gone back in months, but the last time I’ve been there, it had no meals. The heaviest I saw on the menu were pastas. Not sure now, but it would probably be nice to expand the menu in case people would want to stay over for brunch.

Verdict: Decent coffee + aesthetic place + great ube cake. It’s a good place to introduce filter coffee to friends, but I’m going back again only for that ube cake. 😆

I tried to post my original post here but for some reason it doesn't let me. So please do look at my profile for a more in detail.

My BP and I broke up after I cheated after 8 years, it was emotional. I made constant bad choices and hurt the person I said I'd protect and love forever.

It's been a rollercoaster since and me and my BP have managed to remain in each others lives as real positive aspects . We speak daily, they've started the gym with me to build some mental and physical strength. We hang out grab coffee, go cinema and more. 

BP has stated they want me in their life but just not as a partner. They don't think they could put themselves through it and don't think they can trust and be the same partner they once were. Which I totally understand. 

I have made positive change in my life since day one of it all happening. Therapy, I've joined an athletics club, Im more open and Im trying to become and trustworthy person for my future and for ever how long BP exists in my life for them too. 

I know I can only take BP on their word they can't and I honestly respect it even though It stings so much. 

But has anyone else experienced being friends after and it leading somewhere. 

Am I delaying the inevitable? 

I love BP and when I look into my future I see BP with me. But am I just feeding my delusion?  ",0,1730623234.0,SupportforWaywards,1,0.5,False

**AOE 2 DE & decryption**  
Almost all pre-Definitive Edition campaigns for Age of Empires 2 have been converted for Co-Op play. However, campaigns released after the Definitive Edition have remained unconverted because the developers started encrypting their content. While this decision makes sense from a business perspective, it limits the community’s ability to access campaign assets or modify maps, such as adapting them for Co-Op play.

Below is a link to a post where a user claims to have created and shared a tool for decrypting these newer campaigns. If this tool works as described, it could allow the community to convert the 77 remaining encrypted scenarios for Co-Op gameplay.

**Notes**  
\* = Converted directly without changes. Same pop limit, same resources, same AI etc.  
\*\* = Many bugs, problems or unplayable  
\*\*\* = Campaigns that can be converted without decryption

I will update this post with the missing details. 

Most of the converted campaigns are not original works by the Co-Op converters. The campaigns are made by skilled creators which as attributed on each campaign found on the link. My focus here is on the individuals converting these campaigns and scenarios, as their efforts make it possible for Co-Op fans to enjoy the extensive Age of Empires 2 content library in a new way.

Some of these converters are active on Reddit, but I’ve chosen not to include their names here to respect their privacy. You can reach out to them through the Age of Empires forums.

If you know of any creators with platforms like Patreon or “Buy Me a Coffee,” let me know, and I’ll add those details to support their work.",9,1730623212.0,aoe2,2,0.85,False

One of my greatest fears is that one day if I open the microwave without stopping it first the latch thingy won’t work properly and it will still be microwaving and even though the door is open, and that microwave radiation will kill me instantly.

So, with this in mind, imagine my surprise when one day at the office I see a pregnant woman push the button to open the microwave door while she’s microwaving a coffee and she opens it. Anyway, so the microwave opens and her pregnant belly is right up close to the open door, and it’s still running — like the coffee is turning around on the plate and everything. And it’s open for like five seconds in front of her preg belly and she grabs the coffee, closes it, leaves. She didn’t even notice!

 I was horrified. is the baby OK?? cause I don’t really know anything about this but I’m scared. Thank you.

I have totally recovered from the surgery (keyhole surgery). The diarrhea/loose stools has also stopped. I do have occasional diarrhea only when I have coffee in empty stomach but i think it is related to my gastritis. I do notice that starchy carbs and any high fat food content makes my stomach very bloated and I need it help with this.

Almost 99% of the food I eat makes my tummy bloat like a pooh bear and it is very unattractive. If there is any supplements or herbs that can help please suggest me for the bloatedness. T

1gii7n1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gii7n1,"IK this is repetitive, but I hate their rating sys","This is more of a rant to get off my chest and feel a little better lol but I’m so sick of their rating system. Back in February til about the middle of October I got a full time job and didn’t really use IC as much and before I dropped off I had a fraudulent 1-star someone left me to get free items back in November. (Leaving me at a 4.97 until October when I started back up again) Ok so boom, I’m moving down south in a couple weeks and already put my 2 weeks in which is giving me free time again also I don’t like being stuck in the house bored so I though I should do IC to make extra money for my move. So I worked literally so hard since mid October til today to get my rating back up to knock that 1-star off. I finally did it yesterday! Haha so I thought, this morning I woke up to a 4.99, I was geeked. 

So today I’m ngl, I blindly accepted a $41 order with 36 items (61 units) without even looking through the preview, I just accepted lmao. Well, this person ordered 10 4-pack gallon jugs of water. (I inserted a photo for reference) and 1 one gallon jug of water. ugh I got my workout today lugging those back and forth to my car and to their door. And also delivered 9 whole gallons of milk to a coffee shop today. 🤦🏾‍♀️ (I inserted a photo of my heavy weight) 

Anyways, woke up in the middle of the night and checked my ratings and come to my surprise they marked every item as damaged 🙄 (photo reference) after I was physically handing the guy each and every single one of waters to him. I’m literally so sick right now. 

They really need to filter these complaints, how is it possible for a customer to get away with fraudulently reporting every single item as damaged after it’s been assigned to ‘hand to you’. Also wouldn’t it be sus if they didn’t take their tip away but gave a 1-star? IC really needs to look into this more and take these things more seriously. It just makes me annoyed that I worked hard for like 3 weeks to finally get a high rating just for it to be fraudulently snatched away from me AGAIN 😂",1,1730621833.0,InstacartShoppers,2,1.0,False

I finished it anyway and went to pay the bill and then...... they made me scan this QR code on the counter and it had a whole process that they had to guide me through it.. signing in ?  An otp code to sign up and then came a welcome screen and then I had to search for the pay bill option then finally I could pay the freaking bill ....

So I(M20) got a huge crush on a girl in my college class. Especially after i started some conversations with her and found out we have a lot in common. She at least really seemed to enjoy talking with but didn’t really text me back a lot so maybe i should’ve taken the hint then. But still I asked her out to coffee but she said she has a train to catch. I said ok, but she really confused me. As in she did at least show interest talking with me irl. But on texts it was like she was a whole other person. Then i asked her out again :)) but she told me she has a boyfriend.
And i said it’s ok and i appreciate her honesty but i still can t get over her. And it’s hard because she was not only really pretty she also had a lot of interests that i also have and it felt so easy talking with her. And I really enjoyed all our conversations as I don’t have many friends and it was so fun spending time with her.

And I know she’s not the only girl out there but it feels like most of the girls like her that fit my type both physically and personality wise are hard to find.

On Halloween my oldest son (16) took his siblings (f10 and m8) out trick-or-treating. One house handed out large plastic cups filled with store bought candy.

 My youngest picked a purple cup and my daughter picked a green cup. When the kids got home I went through my son's candy and my husband went through my daughter's candy to check for suspicious tampering. 

After going through the candy in my son's cup, I handed the cup to my daughter and told her to put it in the kitchen so the cups could get washed before use. She did but left her cup on the coffee table. I got home from work today and noticed it still sitting there as she was doing the dishes and reminded her to wash it.

Bedtime roles around and my youngest asked for a glass off water and went to use his purple cup. His sister started arguing that the purple cup was hers. I asked her what color the cup on the coffee table was today and she said green. I reminded her of the events on Halloween night and how I had sent her into the kitchen with her brother's purple cup that night. 

She threw a fit causing my husband to jump into the discussion. After some back and forth she angrily suggested we ask my oldest son. My husband agreed. This made me angry so I asked him to step outside so we could talk. I tried to tell him I felt betrayed that he didn't trust my recounting of events and he told me he wouldn't tell his daughter she was wrong without more proof. 

We argued for 30 minutes until my oldest got home and confirmed my daughter's cup was the green one. I then tried to reiterate I was angry because he didn't trust me and refused to tell his daughter she was wrong. AITA?",1,1730621539.0,AmItheAsshole,9,0.67,False
