Location : Switzerland

Me and my mother were drinking coffee at home.
It was a quiet sunday afternoon, a bit overcast but a clear day.
My mother noticed something through the window and asked what is it.
I looked and, it was like 300-400 meter from us at our right at a 30 degree angle.

At first glance i said it was a plastic bag and she told me it isn't.

It was silent outside, no cars, noone walking, not that strange but there's usually more activity outside even for a sunday.

The object was approaching sloqlsy from our right going to our left.

It was a small black sphere, it looked like a liquid, its surface had a texture and was wobbling like a fluid does in zero gravity, the silouhette had waves moving around, and it reflected light like a metal does. So it was like a floating ball of mercure so to speak.
But it looked out of place like a CGI render. 
I'd guess it's size to be at a maximum of 2 meters in diamater.

It moved slowly but precisly and intelligently like a drone would. It wasn't pushed by the wind, it maintain perfectly it's altitude like a drone does.

It was totally silent.

I knew i was looking at something abnormal so i quickly look for the camera we had but didn't find it, i wasn't aware we sold it.

I had my phone that was an s21 at the time, but here's the thing, i decided not to film it.
First because i'm not a phone guy, and that i wanted to live this moment fully, to look at it, not throught a screen. Abd this might sound ridiculous but i felt like i shouldn't film it at all, out of respect. It felt like a deal 'i'm not filming but let me look at you'. I'm not sure why i thought this, but i did.
Yes i had times where i regret it but i just don't care and feel right about it.

I was still moving now between our window and the building facing ours.

At a tree height so just right in front of us, 100 meters.

Then it stoped moving and stay in the air in front of us a bit to the left, for seconds or a minute.

Then, this is purely my own gut feeling interpretation : i felt noticed, like if it was aware that i was observing it, and i saw a slight movement towards me like a few cenntimeters and it was the only moment i had an intense fear response and see it did goes back where it was. But this is my interpretation, it might have been a feeling and illusion bc of its weird liquid l-like form.

I can tell the entire sighting wasn't personnal, no comunication, it felt neutral. It was doing its own business and didn't care about being seen by us.

Then as it moves to our left, the trajectory was like an arc so it was 200-300m away now.
It then lowered its altitude so i could see from the top and was close to the publuc transport electric line. It hovered at the same place for mayve 3 minutes.

It slowly flattened itself into a disk shape and started to spin on itself, rotating on its own axis.
I could see the texture of its surface, spining, creating a sort of vortex/spiral at the center, then sime pointy tubes grew out of its center, rotated, and were pulsing, like electrically, the top of those tubes were pulsing upward while they were spining.
Then the tubes shape go back inside the disk.
The disk was just a flat disk again, and sliwly took height and was then heigher than ne so i saw the bottom part.
It stayed inti a disk shape and slowly moved away from me at a constent speed.
I kept looking at it until it was so far away the i only saw a tiny dot until it was gone.

The entire time i was ultra focus.
It lasted probably 10 minutes.

Then, me and my mother, weirdly forget about it for a month, then i start talking about it again with her, she kept describing the same as i remember.

I then wrote a report to MUFON but without anything then.

Also i was shocked that way after i saw the almost same ufo sighting on the fin365 youtube channel that make 3d scene of sightings.
The texas one from 97. Which the video was posted way after my soghting and MUFON repirt.
It spooked me too, knowing i wasn't alone and that the description matched mine which is kinda very specific.

I spend a lot of time looking if anyone reported something, looking for explenations, but havn't find anything to explain. Feel free to give your thoughts or ideas or telling me if you saw the sane or heard of a similar case.

It took me a long time to stop overthinking this and accept that i don't know its nature and what it was doing.

The venue issued a written statement on Instagram explaining its connection to a Dec. 12 video of a crowd of people shouting at law enforcement agents in the parking lot of Breaux Mart on Magazine Street.

Libs of TikTok, an influential conservative account on X, posted the video a few days later, saying that the people filming were employees of Sports Drink, calling them “deranged leftists and “complete losers” who were mistakenly jeering law enforcement officers there to arrest a man for allegedly having child sexual abuse material, thinking it was an immigration sweep.

The video had more than two million views by Friday, and commenters piled on in deriding the protestors.

Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill confirmed last Friday that the agents from the Louisiana Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force were there to arrest a man on 120 counts of possession of child sex abuse material.

Murrill’s office said in a press release that anti-immigration protesters shouted expletives, honked their horns and made hand gestures at the agents and followed their vehicles.

By Tuesday, Sport’s Drink owner Andrew Stephens had decided to close temporarily out of concern for “safety of our employees, patrons and community at large.” Its social media accounts were made private.

In Friday’s post, the company said the post’s author was the only person from Sports Drink in the Breaux Mart parking lot. The statement, though written in the first person, was unsigned, and Stephens did not respond to a request for comment.

The statement said the poster went to Breaux Mart after hearing that immigration enforcement officers might be there, but that “my intent and action did not align here.”

The author apologized and said they will “strive to improve in the future.”

Sports Drink shared that it would reopen the cafe on Monday and resume its calendar of events after Christmas.

Its regular calendar of events includes making sandwiches for New Orleans Community Fridges, comedy open-mic nights, trivia, and other comedic events featuring nationally touring comedians and rising stars.",1,1766199639.0,NewOrleans,0,0.57,False

1pr3rw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pr3rw7/bfs_interactions_with_female_coworker/,BF’s Interactions With Female Coworker,"I started seeing this guy a few months ago. He’s been giving a female coworker rides to and from work, which at first, I thought was a one off sorta thing. Later on, I found out it’d been going on for about a year! He also drives his mom to work, as she’s a coworker as well. Over time, the rides with his coworker escalated to him also helping her pick up groceries (not paying, just rides) and even carrying her work monitor so she could work from home. He never set any expectations or boundaries with her and says he didn’t speak up because he was just trying to be kind.

Recently, he told me he was going to end this. He became very upset because he feels she was ungrateful and entitled. He said she never showed appreciation (like buying him coffee, paying for his gas or small gestures), and that made him feel taken for granted. He also complained a lot about being tired from doing this, but at the same time insisted that giving her rides “wasn’t a problem.” When she stopped coming in for a day, he said it felt amazing to go straight to work and then straight home, and that it was a “reminder” that he’d hit his limit months ago.

What gives me pause is:

•	He did this for a full year without communicating, then built resentment.

•	He seems to believe that appreciation would have justified his overextension, which I find confusing… why should HIS overextending the “help” need to be justified at all? Why should there be “appreciation” from a coworker in the first place…? There’s no expectation of mutuality. Why is he “expecting” anything in return?

•	He also complains that his mom doesn’t appreciate him enough because she doesn’t give him money for gas either… despite the fact that she pays his rent and groceries.

My concern is that it looks like he tends to overgive, doesn’t set boundaries, then expects gratitude or validation to make it feel worth it. I worry this could turn into resentment, passive aggression, or controlling behavior over time. I’m also questioning whether this shows emotional immaturity or inexperience with healthy boundaries, especially with women.

Both married young - she had kids a bit earlier than me - but both connected instantly. The attraction was so hard to ignore and I could tell it was mutual. The first 2 years were a slow burn of only crossing paths naturally, obsessing but talking with such ease it was scary until we both made an online effort to meet up.

We kissed 2 times but the guilt wore her down. For the next couple of years there was NC (minus a few marketplace enquires) and only Spotify playlists to hold hope and make signals of longing.

A few months ago, she made contact and before long, we had a coffee and then made love at our next meetup in a private spot, without really discussing it. It just happened as we had so much pent up lust. It was my first time with someone else for so long. And so incredible.

We have given space to each other over this school holiday period with the intention to experience each other more properly again. But I feel she will disappear again so I have my guard up.

We are so compatible but we’re also but torn about being committed to parenting our kids in a stable house.

We both make sure life at home is happy, don’t overlap (although one of her children began attending my kids school this year)

Is the idea of her / the affair more of the turn on it feels or are we destined to make our lives and love honourable and pure?

How do I cope or make a confession to my wife?

There is something incredibly cozy about the long dark in my opinion. I feel the mixture of the almost oil paint art style and bitter cold that requires sitting in front of a fire makes the experience so relaxing at points. I love the way eating or drinking something sounds. Heating coffee up on a fire and hearing the ceramic clang on from the cup or the sounds that are made when you make pancakes or pie. Or the little bits of steam coming off of porridge right before I eat it on a cold night. Not to mention the UI and all the comfort foods you can make as well as heating up teas and coffee in front of a fire. This game helped me through a tough time in my life, I was dumped from a two year relationship and was feeling down. I needed something to keep my mind busy but relax me enough to process the change in my life, this game did that for me. 

On the same note the game also provided me with an interesting and engaging challenge that keeps me coming back. I take all of my mistakes from my previous runs and learn to avoid them on follow up play throughs. The long dark feels like a puzzle game to me and I feel that is how the survival genre should feel to the player. ",3,1766199385.0,thelongdark,1,1.0,False

My husband and I are relocating to Milwaukee very soon (a bit out of the blue) and are trying to figure out which neighborhoods to look at for renting.

A little about us:
• We’d prefer a place near bars, restaurants, coffee shops, etc.
• Ideally somewhere that still feels safe and has a relaxed vibe
• I’ll be working near the Third Ward/downtown while my husband will be working in Germantown
• Looking for a 2 bed/2 bath to rent to get us started.

We don’t know the city super well yet, so we’re hoping for some local insight. We’ve heard mixed things about different pockets of the city and want to be intentional about where we end up.
Any neighborhoods you’d recommend (or avoid) for people in our situation? And if there are specific buildings/complexes worth checking out, that would be amazing.

Thanks in advance!!",1,1766198795.0,milwaukee,6,0.6,False
1pr3ixf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1pr3ixf/am_i_overreacting_or_does_my_bf_have_no_sense_of/,Am I Overreacting… or does my BF Have No Sense of Self Awareness With Female Coworker?,"I started seeing this guy a few months ago. He’s been giving a female coworker rides to and from work, which at first, I thought was a one off sorta thing. Later on, I found out it’d been going on for about a year! He also drives his mom to work, as she’s a coworker as well. Over time, the rides with his coworker escalated to him also helping her pick up groceries (not paying, just rides) and even carrying her work monitor so she could work from home. He never set any expectations or boundaries with her and says he didn’t speak up because he was just trying to be kind.

Recently, he told me he was going to end this. He became very upset because he feels she was ungrateful and entitled. He said she never showed appreciation (like buying him coffee, paying for his gas or small gestures), and that made him feel taken for granted. He also complained a lot about being tired from doing this, but at the same time insisted that giving her rides “wasn’t a problem.” When she stopped coming in for a day, he said it felt amazing to go straight to work and then straight home, and that it was a “reminder” that he’d hit his limit months ago.

What gives me pause is:

•	He did this for a full year without communicating, then built resentment.

•	He seems to believe that appreciation would have justified his overextension, which I find confusing… why should HIS overextending the “help” need to be justified at all? Why should there be “appreciation” from a coworker in the first place…? There’s no expectation of mutuality. Why is he “expecting” anything in return?

•	He also complains that his mom doesn’t appreciate him enough because she doesn’t give him money for gas either… despite the fact that she pays his rent and groceries.

My concern is that it looks like he tends to overgive, doesn’t set boundaries, then expects gratitude or validation to make it feel worth it. I worry this could turn into resentment, passive aggression, or controlling behavior over time. I’m also questioning whether this shows emotional immaturity or inexperience with healthy boundaries, especially with women.

Am I overreacting for questioning this pattern and my interest in continuing the relationship?",2,1766198737.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

I only ask as 2.5 years ago someone fed him rat poison. After 2 weeks in the emergency vet, and months of medicine, he was finally back to normal.

1pr3c52,https://i.redd.it/5k8x2mmyt98g1.jpeg,The Search for the Hardest Nog - Day 17 - Old Forester Rye SBBP,"Today is Old Forester Rye SBBP, coming in at 64.75%. After mixing in a 4:1 ratio with eggnog, it will have a final ABV of ~16.2%.

Let's get started, neatly!

Nose: cherry, slight apple and oak.

Palate: Delicious cherry, vanilla, slight apple peel bitter and a touch of oak. Really digging in, I feel like there's also a hint of coffee and chocolate that becomes more apparent in the finish. Also some rye spice in the background.

Finish: Cherry, chocolate and coffee, cinnamon and clove.

Very tasty. I wouldn't immediately guess this was a rye, which in my limited experience seems to be normal for Old Forester Rye, but I do get a hint of rye spice in the background. 82/100.

I think this could be good in Nog, but let's find out!

Nog with a bit of a stronger cherry note on the nose 

I think the cherry flavor is a bit stronger than usual, but aside from that the whiskey has completely disappeared in the nog.

I was hopeful that it would really accentuate the nog flavors. But it seems like it was too similar and just couldn't stand up to the nog.

\-Brags about sending the princess dinner and doesn't even have food in his house for two small children! Hopes he has some old spaghetti lurking in the back of the cabinet. How about ordering them dinner instead, dumbass.

\-Goes to Disney by himself. It's just odd.

\-the outfit he's posing in with Britain and the kids is....a choice. Not to mention the short shorts to work in a school and the multiple pictures IN school-some showing other people's kids!

\-talking about these virtual coffee, movies, dinner and dates. I'ts cringe and weird.

1pr3bbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassF/comments/1pr3bbn/chapter_12_the_orphan_and_the_guest/,Chapter 12: The Orphan and the Guest,"# Danny

The first shot missed. Too soft. Too slow.

The blood strand slapped against the pillow pinned to my closet door and slid down like paint. I clenched my fist. Focused harder. The cut on my arm pulsed open again, thin and controlled, the way I’d learned.

A second strand floated out, twisting midair, sharp as wire. This one hit dead center.

“Better,” I muttered.

I wasn’t training for glory. Or for grades. I just needed to prove to myself that I was stronger than yesterday. That every failure from before was just groundwork for control. Even if I had to bleed for it.

A knock pulled me out of focus.

“Danny?” my mom called through the door. Her voice was soft but tense. “Honey, come out here, please.”

I wiped the sweat off my forehead, careful not to smudge any blood, and opened the door just a crack. She was standing in the hallway, holding her tablet like it had just punched her in the chest. Her eyes were already glassy.

“You need to see this,” she said, and her voice broke a little.

I stepped out, heart already sinking. She tapped the screen, turned the volume up. A news anchor filled the feed, smooth voice, practiced sadness.

“Tragic loss for the Senate and the nation. Vicente Calderon, longtime political leader and vocal advocate for powered youth reform, was found dead late last night in his private office. While no official cause has been released, sources suggest health complications linked to stress and overwork may have contributed. Authorities are advising against speculation as the investigation continues.”

I didn’t move. Didn’t speak. I just stared.

“Health complications?” I muttered.

She didn’t answer. The screen split to show photos of Vicente shaking hands, giving speeches. Then it cut. To her. Livia.

She was standing near an officer. Not crying. Not moving. Just holding her sketchbook to her chest like it was the only thing keeping her from disappearing. She looked so small. So empty.

I felt it before I even realized what was happening. Warmth on my cheeks. I touched my face. Blood. Not a wound. Not training. Just feeling.

My mom stepped forward. “Danny…”

But I turned before she could see my eyes. Because I wasn’t okay. Because nothing about this felt okay.

She placed a gentle hand on my back, didn’t say anything else. And I was grateful for that. Because I couldn’t have answered. Couldn’t explain why it hurt so much to see someone else’s grief. Couldn’t explain why it felt like something inside me had cracked wide open.

All I knew was that Livia had lost her father. And all I could think about was how I couldn’t do anything to stop it.

\-----

# Sofia

The spiders were restless. They crawled up the corners of the living room, silent, twitchy, like they could feel something wrong before I even saw the news.

Mom was sitting on the couch with a tea she hadn’t touched. Dad kept switching channels like that would change the headline. It didn’t.

I stood behind the couch, watching the screen. Livia’s name wasn’t mentioned. Not even once. But I saw her. Just for a second. In the background. Standing next to a car, arms around her sketchbook. The same way I held my spiders when I was scared.

“They’re already blaming it on the other party,” my father said. “Of course.”

“Figures,” my mother muttered. “One less mouth in the Senate.”

I looked at them. Then at the news. Then at the spider on my wrist, a small one, black and gold. It was shaking. And for the first time in days, I felt like I was the one being watched.

\-----

# Tasha

“What the hell?” I muttered, flipping through the channels like I didn’t already know what I’d find.

“Language,” my dad warned from the kitchen, but even he wasn’t really listening.

My mom was sitting at the table, staring at her phone. Not scrolling. Just staring.

“Senator Calderon’s passing leaves a significant void in national defense policy,” the anchor said.

Void? He’d been murdered. I didn’t know how I knew. But I did.

“This is shady,” I said, turning the screen toward them. “You guys don’t think this was random, right?”

My dad frowned. “Well, news says it was health issues.”

“And since when do they ever say the truth?”

My mom exhaled. “Sweetheart, don’t get involved with politics. It’s dirty and dangerous.”

“Exactly,” I said under my breath. Because if they could do that to a senator, what could they do to us?

\-----

# Trent

“Yo,” I called out from the hallway. “Y’all see this?”

No one answered. Figures. Mom was at work. Dad probably asleep on the couch again. I turned the volume up.

“Massive loss for the Gold Capes initiative…”

I didn’t know the guy personally. But anyone that important, dead without warning? That didn’t sit right. I checked the group chat. Nothing from Danny. Nothing from Livia.

That’s when I knew it was real.

\-----

# Clint

I saw the headline in the corner of the screen while waiting for my mom to finish folding laundry. Didn’t say anything. Didn’t blink. Just stared.

“Another one bites the dust,” my stepdad muttered, not even looking up from his beer.

I kept my mouth shut. The news kept rolling.

“New reports suggest Senator Calderon may have been under investigation for alleged misuse of federal funds linked to powered youth programs…”

I felt it before I understood it. Something deep, slow, sinking. Like a memory slipping under water. I turned away from the screen, but the words stuck to me. Misuse of funds. Powered youth.

It wasn’t just noise. It was familiar. But I didn’t know why. Like I was forgetting something important and couldn’t even remember what it used to feel like.

My mom said something. I didn’t catch it. I just nodded and picked up another towel. And tried to ignore the way my hands were shaking.

\-----

# Mina

I was brushing my teeth when the bathroom screen lit up with breaking news. Toothbrush halfway to my mouth. Foam dripping down my chin.

The name hit first. Then the photo. Then Livia. Only for a second. She wasn’t crying. She wasn’t blinking. She was just standing near a patrol car, clutching her sketchbook like it was the only thing still keeping her body together. Eyes wide. Frozen. Like something inside her had already left.

I stopped moving. Just froze. The voice on the screen kept talking, too calm to be real.

“Authorities confirm no foul play…”

My fingers twitched. I swallowed wrong. Choked on the foam. Spat into the sink, pink and sour.

The screen blinked out. Black. Dead. Too fast.

“Signal interference,” the house AI said like it meant nothing.

But I didn’t believe it. No one ever does when the darkness shows up exactly on time.

\-----

# The Teacher

I leaned against the wall long after the others had gone, still trying to steady my breath. The blood had dried under my nose. My heartbeat hadn’t.

Leo hadn’t moved. He just sat there, hands in his lap, gaze far away, like he was watching something I couldn’t see. Or maybe waiting for something I couldn’t stop.

“Elis,” I said, still breathless. “Stay with him. Don’t leave him alone.”

She didn’t argue. Just nodded and crossed the room, taking a chair by the far wall. Close enough to watch him. Far enough not to provoke.

I dragged my feet toward the hallway. Every step felt heavier than the last. Not just fatigue, distortion. Like reality itself was still shivering from the ripple he left behind.

I barely made it to my office before slumping into the chair. Elis followed minutes later. She didn’t sit. She just stood there, arms crossed, like if she kept her muscles tense enough, the truth wouldn’t collapse the room around us.

“That wasn’t normal,” she said.

“No.” I closed my eyes. “It wasn’t.”

“You didn’t just lose blood.”

I nodded slowly. “I lost something. For a moment, I forgot your name. Forgot why I was even standing there.”

Elis stayed silent, her eyes darkening.

“We need to be careful,” I said. “He’s not just unstable. He’s fragmented. And I don’t think he understands any of it.”

“He’s scared,” she muttered. “And so are we.”

I looked at her. “No,” I said. “We’re not scared. Not yet. We’re guessing. That’s worse.”

A pause. Then I continued. “We have to understand what he is. Not just the power. The pattern. The origin. The rules, if there are any.”

Elis didn’t reply right away. Then she sighed. “So what? Research? Interviews? Psychic scans? You almost got erased just by touching his mind.”

“I know.”

A long silence settled between us. Then I said it. “There’s only one person I’ve ever met who’s dealt with something close to this. Not the same, but close enough to build a frame around it.”

Elis didn’t look up. “You’re not talking about—”

“I am.”

Her jaw clenched. “Zenos. Don’t.”

“I have to.”

“She hates anomalies. You know that. She hates when things don’t fit. She’ll break him before she tries to understand him.”

“She’s also the only person who might survive analyzing him without losing her identity.”

Elis stepped forward, voice sharp now. “She tried to get your whole class shut down. She called Leo ‘biohazard trash’ before even meeting him.”

I stood up. “She’s also my mother.”

That shut her up. I didn’t say it with pride. I didn’t say it with hate. I just said it like a fact I’d spent years trying to forget.

Elis stared at me for a long time. Then finally, softly, “She won’t help us.”

I looked at her. “She will,” I said. “Because this time, I’m not giving her a choice.”

When I opened the door again, Leo was exactly where I’d left him. Same chair. Same posture. Same impossible stillness. But the air around him was quieter now. Not safe, but steadier. Like something inside him had settled just enough to stop flickering.

I stepped in, let the door close behind me. He didn’t look up. I spoke anyway.

“My place has a spare room. It’s nothing fancy. Smells like books and coffee. Sometimes blood, if I forget to clean.”

Still nothing. I kept going, tone dry as ever. “It’s not exactly a five-star retreat, but I think you’ll sleep better there than here. And I’d feel better having you under a roof I can control.”

That got a flicker in his eyes. He didn’t move, but he was listening. I took a step closer. “You don’t have to say anything. Just nod, and we go.”

He hesitated. Then one nod. Small. Barely there. But I saw it. And that was enough.

Elis met me at the end of the hallway. Her arms were crossed. Same as always. But her eyes had softened, just a fraction.

“He said yes?” she asked.

“He nodded.”

“That’s basically a contract,” she said, deadpan.

I smirked. “He’ll be staying with me.”

She raised a brow. “You sure that’s wise?”

“No.”

“Same old Zenos. Leaping into volcanoes with a stick and a guess.”

I exhaled. “He needs distance. Space to stabilize. I’ll watch him.”

She nodded, then added with a faint smirk, “You do remember who else lives in your house, right?”

I grimaced. “Believe me. I’m counting the hours until she threatens to dissect me.”

“I’ll join you both later,” Elis said, stepping aside to let us pass. “Bringing a few bodies. For, you know, enrichment.”

“Lovely,” I muttered. “Bring flowers next time.”

She gave me a two-finger salute. “Drive safe.”

Leo followed me without a word. The car ride started with the usual awkward silence. Old seats. Cold windows. The dashboard light flickered like it knew what we were carrying.

Leo sat in the passenger seat like he didn’t know how to fit into it. Like maybe it would reject him if he breathed too loud. I didn’t push. Just turned on the engine and started driving.

Three blocks in, I tried. “You allergic to music?”

Leo shook his head.

“Good.”

I tapped the stereo. It clicked, whirred, then failed. Typical. I slapped the side of it. “Of course.”

Leo glanced at me. Then, cautiously, looked at the stereo again. He didn’t speak. But I felt something shift. The air bent slightly. A pressure, faint and wrong.

And then the stereo blinked out of existence. No static. No spark. No crack. It was just gone. Like it had never been there at all.

We both stared at the hole where it used to be. I looked at him. He looked at his hands. Then at me.

“Sorry,” he whispered.

I didn’t shout. Didn’t react. Just kept one hand on the wheel and said, “At least it wasn’t the engine.”

He blinked. And for the first time, the first time, Leo smiled. Not big. Not long. But real. And just like that, the silence didn’t feel so hostile anymore.

Fifteen minutes later, we pulled up to a house that looked like it wanted to be left alone. Three floors of weathered brick, vines choking the balcony rails, and windows that didn’t believe in curtains.

Leo looked at it with something between fear and curiosity.

“This is where I live,” I said.

He didn’t reply.

I added, “And also where my mother lives. Don’t worry, she hates me more than she’ll ever hate you.”

He gave me a look. A questioning one. I nodded. “You’ll see.”

We stepped out of the car. The gate groaned in protest. And I led the most dangerous student I’d ever met straight into the lion’s den.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",1,1766198109.0,ClassF,0,1.0,False
1pr3alr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pr3alr/what_i_left_in_the_dark/,What I Left in The Dark,"He arrived without an appointment. No name, no referral—just walked into my office ten minutes before closing and sat down across from me like he'd always been there. His eyes were wrong. Not in color or shape, but in recognition. He looked at me like we’d met before. Like I had done something to him.  

I asked his name. 

He smiled but didn’t answer, just tilted his head like he was waiting for me to say it. My pen wouldn’t write when I tried to fill out the intake form. The line for Patient Name stayed blank, no matter how hard I pressed. And when I glanced at the mirror behind him, only one of us was visible. 

“You don’t remember me, do you, Rob?” He asked, his chuckle sharp. 

 My hand twitched, tracing a faint scar on my thumb, my brother’s pocketknife, a blood-oath gone wrong. The memory slipped away, but the patient’s eyes held it. 

“How do you know my name?” I asked. 

“I thought I'd be hard to forget. But you’ve been avoiding me for so long.” He leaned forward, as if testing my boundaries. 

“Maybe, maybe it’s easier if you pretend I'm not real, right? Easier for both of us.” 

I took a moment, gathering my words. 

“Well, what brings you in today?” 

He paused. 

“Well, I think it’s been you who’s brought me here.” 

“I didn’t mean to come, but it seems I've been following you for a while now.” 

He looked past me, focusing on... something. 

“It’s time you finally see me, don’t you think?” 

I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck rise, a shiver I tried to ignore. 

""See you?"" I echoed, trying to regain control of the situation. ""I’m not sure what you’re implying. Care to clarify?"" 

He didn’t answer right away. Instead, his eyes seemed to scan the room, but his focus never left mine. 

""You’ve seen me. You just haven’t been looking."" His voice was low now, as if sharing a secret. ""And you never wanted to."" 

The silence between us stretched, the sound of the clock ticking louder than it should have been. I tried to brush off the unsettling feeling, but it crept up, sinking deeper into my skin. 

“I’m afraid I don’t understand.” My voice came out more strained than I intended, but he didn’t seem to notice. 

“No,” he said softly. ""You do. You just buried it."" 

There was a sudden pressure in the air, like we were both holding our breath. Waiting. Waiting for something. 

I glanced at the mirror again. This time, I didn’t just see myself; his reflection stared back at me. 

And in that moment, I knew: I had seen him before. But the memory slipped away, like water through my fingers. 

I stood up to signal the end of the session, trying to keep my composure. “Let’s meet next week,” I said, the words coming out mechanically. 

He nodded, slowly, like he understood something I didn’t. But before he stood, he leaned in slightly, his voice dropping to a near whisper. 

“You’re not sure if I’ll come back, are you?” 

I froze, hand still on the door. He had a point, but I couldn’t allow myself to acknowledge it. 

“I’ll see you next week,” I repeated, this time more firmly. 

As I walked him out, the hallway felt different. Longer. The light flickered as if struggling to keep up with my thoughts. I glanced at the clock, but I swear the minute hand had moved too quickly. 

When I turned back to my office, I saw the reflection again—the same reflection I had seen in the mirror. It wasn’t just a flicker this time. I saw myself... and him. Standing beside me. 

But when I blinked, it was gone. 

The notes from that session were a complete blur. I went over them  

again and again, yet the handwriting wasn’t quite mine. It felt as though there was more beneath the surface, something I couldn’t put my finger on. 

I picked up the pen, but it wouldn’t write. 

I blinked. There were new words on the page. The same, unnatural writing. 

“You’ll understand soon.” 

“God damn it!” I slammed the notebook shut, my heart pounding. 

The next appointment came quickly. 

“Hello again,” I said. 

“You don’t seem to be listed in our records. How long have you been seeing a therapist?” 

“I haven’t. I felt—a pull. Like I was meant to come to you.” 

“Why do you think that is?” I replied as he smirked. 

“People are capable of horrible things, Rob. You’re not special.” 

I glanced again at the mirror. This time, it wasn’t a person, but a crime. A violent, bloody crime. 

The patient tilted his head, watching me with detached amusement, while humming a song. So familiar, yet I couldn’t put my finger on it. 

“That blood on the window,” he said calmly, “it’s yours. You tried to forget, didn’t you? But some stains, they don't wash off. They linger. 

He smiled again, but this time, it was softer. Not mocking—reminiscing. 

“You called it an accident.” 

He paused. 

“But it wasn’t. That’s for sure.” 

I sat there, unmoving. After an eternity, I gathered the words for a response. 

“I don’t know who you are or what you want, but I did no such thing.” 

He smirked, then began to chuckle. 

He walked out of the room. 

An unsettling calm washed over me, but beneath it, a powerful urge took root. I had to know. Know what he meant, know why that blood was on the window. A fragmented image flashed in my mind: a dark shape, a glint of metal, a muffled sound, but it vanished before I could grasp it. I stood up, my legs feeling heavy and unfamiliar, and found myself moving towards the hallway, drawn by an invisible thread in the direction he went. I walked towards the lobby, determined to find the truth. I passed by the front desk and decided to ask them where the patient went. 

“Did a man leave just now?” 

“No, you’ve been alone for an hour, Rob.” 

\*\*\* 

The next morning, my desk had a sticky note on it. My handwriting, at least I think so. 

“Stop pretending.” 

I read that in my kitchen. When my head moved up, I was in my office. The patient was waiting, as if he knew I was going to be there. 

I sat down, my throat tight, expecting his usual smirk or cryptic words. But he just stared, silent, his eyes locked on mine. No tilt of the head, no chuckle—nothing. The clock ticked, each second stretching into a void. I cleared my throat, tried to start. 

“So,” I said, voice cracking, “why are you here today?” 

He didn’t blink. His gaze bore into me, heavy, like it was peeling back my skin. I shifted in my chair, the pen trembling in my hand. 

“What do you know about Daniel?” I pressed, desperation creeping in. 

Still nothing. The mirror behind him flickered, showing only me, then him, then me again. My reflection’s eyes weren’t mine, they were his, blue and sad, like Daniel’s. I looked away, my heart pounding. 

“Say something!” I shouted, slamming my fist on the desk. 

He leaned forward, just an inch, and the air thickened. No words, but his silence screamed louder than any accusation. I felt it, the weight of what I’d buried, pressing down, suffocating. 

“You’re not real,” I said. My voice was shaking, but I kept going. “You’re something I made up.” 

“Isn’t that the same thing?” he asked. 

I threw a chair. I don’t know why. Maybe some part of me thought that hurting him would end this for good. Instead, the chair hit the wall and fell apart like it was made of paper. 

He just stared at me. Pity in his eyes. 

“You buried me,” he said, “Deep. But you can still feel the weight, can’t you?” 

I rushed him. Fist clenched, breath ragged. I needed to hit something. 

The moment I made contact—pain. White-hot, lancing through my ribs. Like I’d punched myself. Hard. 

I fell back, gasping. He hadn’t moved. 

“You can’t hurt me,” he said softly. “You’d only be hurting yourself.” 

“What the hell are you doing to me!” I screamed. 

“You are doing this to yourself. We both know it.” 

I stood there, silent. 

After a while, I curled into my chair, heart hammering. My hands were trembling. 

“It wasn’t an accident,” I whispered. 

He stepped closer and started laughing. 

“There it is! You're finally listening!” 

Blood on the glass, a scream. A sharp glint. The flash of a wrist twisting. 

I sobbed. I don’t remember starting, but I couldn’t stop. 

The lights buzzed. When I looked again, he was gone. Only one chair in the room. Just me. 

But in the mirror, we were both still there. 

He was watching me. 

Waiting. 

I opened my notebook. The pen worked again. I didn’t remember writing the final sentence. 

“He didn’t die. I just left him in the dark long enough to forget he was screaming.” 

The notebook slipped from my hands, the words burning through me. My chest heaved, the air too thick, the room too small. The mirror stared back, but it wasn’t my office anymore. It was the kitchen, our kitchen, the one in the house where Daniel and I grew up, where we’d carved our initials into the table and swore we’d never be like Dad. 

The vision hit like a blade. I was there again, the fluorescent light buzzing, the air sour with whiskey and rage. Daniel stood across from me, his eyes wild. 

“You took it all, Rob!” He shouted, slamming his fist on the counter. “Dad’s money, the house, everything! You left me with nothing!” 

 His words cut deeper than they should’ve, unearthing years of guilt; I'd been the one who ‘made it,’ while Daniel drowned in debt and drugs. I tried to explain that dad’s will wasn’t my choice, but he laughed, bitter. 

“You’re just like him, a liar.” 

 

I didn’t know when I took the knife. It was sitting there, in the block by the sink, its handle clenched in my palm. 

“Shut up, Dan,” I growled, but he kept going, daring me. 

“What, you gonna fix me, therapist?” 

 His shove sent me flying back, and then something snapped. I lunged, the knife sinking into his chest—once, twice, blood pouring out. He gasped, stumbled, and crashed into the kitchen window, his hands clawing the glass desperately. 

“Robert...” he whispered, sliding down, his eyes locked on mine, wide with shock. 

 I froze, the knife clanging to the floor, a memory flashing: us as kids, pressing our hands to that window, dreaming of escape. 

I blinked, and the vision disappeared. I was back in my office, the mirror blank, the patient gone. But the blood, it lingered in my mind, like a wound that just won’t close. I’d covered it up, hadn’t I? Dragged Dan’s body to the basement, wrapped it in a tarp. Smashed the side window, tipped over chairs, cut my own arm to sell the story. 

An intruder. A fight. Daniel “missing.” 

Days blurred. I stopped answering calls, let appointments pile up. Colleagues left voicemails: 

“Rob, you okay?” 

But I couldn’t face them. My office became a cave, papers strewn, mirrors draped with shirts, but the window found me. In my apartment’s glass door, in the coffee shop’s storefront, in every polished surface, blood, Dan’s handprint, his face pressed against the pane, mouthing, why, Rob? The patient’s voice followed, soft, 

“You see him now, don’t you? You can’t unsee blood.” 

His sessions, if you can even call them that, grew worse. He’d sit there, his face shifting, sometimes Dan’s, sometimes mine. 

 “You took the fortune, Rob,” he’d say. “But you paid in blood. You’re next.” 

 Mirrors showed the kitchen window, Daniel’s body slumped, blood dripping upward, defying gravity. Once, I swore I heard his voice, not the patient’s, but Daniel’s, whispering through the glass:  

“You kept it all, Rob. Give it back.” 

\*\*\* 

I don’t know when I decided to end it. Maybe when I found a note in my handwriting, Free him, Rob, tucked in my coat. Maybe when the patient said,  

“You can’t live with both of us.” 

 I drove to the office at midnight, the city a maze of glass, every pane reflecting the kitchen window: blood, Daniel’s hand, his dying gasp. I climbed the stairs to the roof, my legs heavy. The door was unlocked, like it was waiting. 

The rooftop was cold, the wind sharp. Below, the city glimmered, a thousand windows staring up. Every one was the kitchen window, blood streaked; Daniel’s face pressed against it, his body falling, over and over. Some showed him alive, laughing as a kid, our hands on the glass, promising to share everything. Others showed the knife, my hand twisting, his blood spraying. The patient stood at the edge, his voice soft, almost kind. 

 “You see him everywhere, Rob. Free him.” 

I stepped to the ledge, my heart pounding. I believed it, believed my death would release him, let his spirit rest, maybe let us be brothers again.  

“I’ll make it right, Dan,” I whispered, picturing us young, free, before Dad’s shadow, before the fortune tore us apart. The patient’s eyes were Daniel’s now, blue and sad. 

“Come home, Rob,” he said. “We’re brothers again.” 

I leaned forward. The wind roared, the glass below a sea of blood and memory. The panes flickered—Daniel’s face, our childhood, the knife, the blood—then went dark. The wind stopped. For the first time in what seemed like forever, it was silent. I let go, and the world tilted as I dropped into the glass below. ",4,1766198049.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

At that point I had short hair and wore binders, however I noticed how bigoted it was so I stopped wearing them (so I at least looked slightly feminine lol) it was fun at first, and I got really close with my manager (a dif one) but he left, so he was being replaced by a new guy. For the sake of this story I'll call him JB.  JB was 20 and I was 16 when I first met him (and he turned 21 before I turned 17) and at first I didn't like him much, he was really tall and loud and kind of annoying. So for around the first month or so I didn't talk to him much. And I'm not exactly sure what happened to make us start talking, but I remember thinking it was because he was really funny. He was silly and would just make me laugh, so I started to talk to him some more. Soon I became his 'favorite' he would buy me coffee or food, listen to my stories ECT. He told me I was 'special' to him, that I was one of his best friends. And that felt good for me. But then stuff started going slightly down hill. He told me how I shouldn't cut my hair because I 'look like a boy' and that he wouldn't be my friend anymore if I cut my hair. How I should be more feminine or 'no guy will ever like you if you don't' he would make fun of the way I was, saying I was weird and such an 'innocent homeschooler' but Also contradicting himself and say how 'you are so special, and sweet' he would give me hugs all the time, or stand close to/behind me. He would call me 'wife material' ECT. I once made the mistake of telling him I had a girlfriend (because keep in mind, even though they didn't know I was trans, I was openly queer) and he would go into excessive detail and ask if we ever had sex, or touched each other or did anything sexual in general. He would do this in front of my other coworkers too. And it was embarrassing, but since we were close I shouldn't feel uncomfortable. He would do the same to me, tell me in detail about things he did with past partners, or things he wanted to do with potential partners. And I thought it was a little weird, but we were friends! And friends talk about everything; however, things got much worse, he would pay me money/gifts to hit me. It sounds odd, but at the time I was like ""let him 'test his strength' on me in exchange for money/gifts? Hell yeah!"" I just thought it was some type of silly game or something. Until he would start doing it randomly, one time when I was cleaning he walked past me and punched me in the arm (additional context, I'm 5'3 and he was legitimately 6'5 and worked out) I almost dropped the stuff I was carrying, and could feel tears in my eyes but I was trying not to cry in front of everyone. He said he was sorry and 'didnt mean it to be that hard' and I told him it was okay, but I went home with a yellow and purple bruise on my arm. It then progressed to him drunk texting me, asking for pictures (not nudes or anything, just normal ones) and he would tell me how pretty I was, how he is 'mean' to me but genuinely thinks 'any man would be lucky to have you' and how he wanted me to go over to his house, but also how I would have to lie to his roommates and tell them I was 18. This happened for over a year, almost 2 before I suddenly quit for an unrelated reason. There's many other stuff he did but I covered most of the big stuff. And after I quit he still tried to be friends but I didn't want to because he made me upset. Anyway, I still think about those times a lot, BUT the reason I'm starting to think about all this stuff all over again is because of something my coworker at my new job said. We were talking about our sucky managers at old jobs, and I mentioned JB and a few of the things he did (not ones that were NSFW tho) and instead of laughing like I was he was like 'dude....that guy was literally a predator, like grooming you or some shit' and I was confused, because up until now I thought grooming was someone making you trust them for a while then to SA you. And he never never touched me really inappropriately or anything. So I didn't think that counted. However, after work today I decided to look up the definition of grooming. And now that I did, I think maybe I was. But also idk, maybe I'm being dramatic or something. And I do think about him more than I'd like to admit to, and tbh sometimes I worry about seeing him again. Like I know everyone has had a shitty manager at one point or another, but idk.

Context: I’ve previously biked for fitness, completed 50+ mile rides, and casually biked as well. When not biking, I was an active tennis player and a frequent Barry’s Bootcamp member (12x-15x class per month).

Situation History: I was in LA and a friend suggested we rent bikes and go for a ride along the coast. We ended up biking about 25 miles over the course of five hours (stopped for coffee, stopped for lunch and a cocktail), it was quite a leisurely pace.

Immediately upon disembarking the bike to return to the rental, I was in pretty significant pain in my quads and only my quads. Given my workout history, I brushed it off as just a bad case of DOMS. Over the following days, the pain stayed fairly significant and felt really tight and throbbing. Again, brushed it off as overdoing it a bit and it would go away. A week after the bike ride, I was still in pain and now getting sharp tingles throughout my quads and down my shins (like when your foot falls asleep). I ended up going to urgent care (total of 8 days after the ride); they ran bloodwork and everything came back normal and referred me to an orthopedic and sports neurologist.

Diagnostics: Since then, I have had a MRI of both my back and hips (both normal). An EMG at 14 weeks after the ride (normal). And two months of physical therapy. I am still not back to normal and not even close.

Current state: Early on I could barely walk cumulatively 3K steps per day without being in pain and aggravating nerve tingles. Now eight months later, I can successfully walk 10K steps, but too many days in a row and I find myself in pain.

I want to get back to my life, the gym, activity, adventure. My doctors have simply shrugged and said they’re not sure what it is but I’m showing signs of improvement so there’s nothing else they can do.

Edit Additional Update: So far in two months of PT, I have only been able to sustain some core work. Any type of body weight squat series (we tried five), or lunge (we tried two each side) sends my system into overload and I am struggling for 24-48 hours as if I did a 2 hour leg day at the gym trying to PR.",1,1766197854.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

[Synopsis from Douban](https://m.douban.com/movie/subject/37353746/): 

At a 24-hour bookstore in Shenzhen, Lu Da, frustrated in his job search, rekindles his fighting spirit amid the aroma of coffee and books deep into the night, eventually knocking on the door of opportunity. In the commercial buildings of Huaqiangbei, former opera star Sister Fan sheds her costume to become the “Deal-making Queen,” carving out a new world in the arena of electronic products.

Delivery rider Tan Xiaohe, known as the “Queen of Orders,” embodies professional dignity through her work. Drone engineer Zhang Yi and Nuannuan weave a love story through lines of code. A forest encounter between the lost youth Xiaopeng and a stray civet cat inspires the creation of the country’s first wildlife overpass. Planner Wang Pengqian and his daughter spend a decade guarding the mangroves, witnessing the [black-faced spoonbill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-faced_spoonbill) Y075 become a living symbol of ecological transformation.

These vivid faces connect stories of entrepreneurial legend, industrial upgrading, and technological innovation, vividly portraying Shenzhen’s dramatic transformation over the past 45 years and the boundless possibilities ahead.

1pr34fv,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pr34fv/reflecting_on_a_recent_dating_experience_and_its/,Reflecting on a recent dating experience and it's impact on dating in the future,"I’m pretty inexperienced with relationships, my parents weren’t emotionally available, so I’ve struggled with boundaries and reading emotions, especially over text.

I’m 26, my last short relationship was around 21–22 and since then I’ve gone on very few dates. I fell into the “work on yourself before dating” trap (lose weight, get a car, finish uni, etc.) and got complacent for a while. This year I feel more confident: I don’t hate my life, I mostly enjoy my job and love my hobbies, but I know I still have things to work on.

A few weeks ago I met a girl through a friend. I saw her again on the street while riding my motorcycle, wanted to talk but chickened out. The friend gave me her Instagram and said she was interested, so I messaged her. We joked a bit, I asked her out and she agreed. We didn't text that often before the first date, later she said that felt weird to her and probably affected my actions later (I started texting more, even to much maybe, to the point of suffocating her, keep in mind that the whole communication is done through text which I didn't really like and should have communicated).

The first date exceeded my expectations, small talk, flirting, deep conversations, touching, laughing, and kissing, it lasted 8 hours. The next few dates were similar but shorter (4–6 hours) and close together. The spark and butterflies were strong, we talked about future plans and trips but didn’t discuss communication, expectations, or boundaries, which I now realize is a mistake. Most of our communication was by text, and there was probably some love-bombing from both sides that I didn’t fully recognize.

On the fifth date I told her I wasn’t seeing anyone else and wanted to continue that way, I didn’t explicitly ask for exclusivity, but I feel I pressured her into saying the same. She seemed hesitant if I think back now, but I am not sure, cause at the moment I was a bit flustered by my nerves.

The upcoming week I knew she had exams while working full time, I tried to give space but messaged after an exam when she said she was stressed. We talked for a bit and she seemed fine, was laughing a bit so I suggested a lowkey movie at my place if she felt tired, which a friend later pointed out that might read as trying to initiate intimacy. She said I should’ve waited until her stress passed, for which I apologized and offered space.

Texting died down over the next two weeks. I tried to be supportive when she shared bad days, but I sometimes default to light jokes when at work and send them without thinking. After about two weeks since our last date I suggested breakfast or coffee as a low-pressure way to talk, and she broke things off, saying she was mad I’d been planning while she was stressed and that her job and classes were her priority. I responded defensively, said we’d moved too fast and that I’d step back, then asked to be removed from her close friends for my peace of mind. A week later I asked if she’d be open to a conversation, and that’s where it ended.

Any inexpensive coffee bean recommendations for someone who likes ""dark, oily beans"" and Starbucks blond roast?","My brother has gotten into making espresso this year, and I thought I'd get him something related for 1 of his Christmas gifts. I knew he'd mentioned buying different accessories and I think he's got that covered, but I couldn't remember whether he mentioned using a coffee grinder or if he just bought it ground. I'd procrastinated, and just to be safe, I went ahead and ordered him some ground coffee yesterday 

Then today, my mom saw him and tried to nonchalantly ask him about the coffee he uses for me. What she remembers is that he said he buys whole beans and that he really likes a dark, oily bean. But then the other thing she remembers he said was that when he gets coffee out, he really likes a drink that has Starbucks' blond roast. She said ""Starbucks blond beans dark roasted,"" but I'm guessing she just got mixed up with the dark roast part

But he did say he'd really love to find a way to get something that tastes like the Starbucks blond roast at home. So now I'm not sure whether I should aim for that, or just go with a dark roast bean to be safe. As far as the blond roast, I'm guessing he's tried the bags of blond beans Starbucks sells...I don't know if maybe the ones they sell for home are a little different and just don't actually taste quite like the coffee made in their shops?

My project **LogiCart** (the one who got 'Sherlocked' by Microsoft last 3 weeks), I got one piece of feedback I got was that my UI was too rigid. It treated 'Buy a coffee maker' the same as 'Build a deck.'

So this week, I rebuilt the frontend using a **Generative UI** pattern (similar to Google's new A2UI concept) Now, the Agent decides the *interface* structure based on what you ask for:

1. **Shopping Intent** (*'Best gaming monitor'*): Renders a **Comparison Table** \+ Winner Card.
2. **DIY Intent** (*'How to install a ceiling fan'*): Renders an interactive **Timeline/Checklist**

It’s live now. I’d love for you to try breaking the logic. Try asking for a simple product vs. a complex task and see if the UI adapts correctly.

It's a good way also to learn also about Google A2UI [https://a2ui.org/](https://a2ui.org/) which fits really well with what I am trying to achieve.

1pr2wzn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightshift/comments/1pr2wzn/19_years_old_overnights_at_a_gas_station_some/,"19 years old, overnights at a gas station. (Some details of my favorite memories from about 6 years ago.)","A friend and i were working at a gas station over the summer. We usually stayed at the same one, but sometimes we would cover other locations. Most of my memories were at my ""home""  location.

Overnight shifts at a gas station, in a somewhat rural town (about 30 minutes from a regular city) were very slow. VERY slow. The usual customers were people getting lottery tickets, beer, cigarettes, or all 3. A trucker here and there. A few people who were night owls. 

Between customers, we would tidy up the store and do our cleaning tasks. Sometimes the station would be dead for one or two hours at a time, so i would play on my friends Switch (we would take turns playing on it until i bought my own.)

Every night i would eat instant ramen and make it using the hot water from the coffee machines. I would add beef jerky and nacho cheese to it. It was a delicious gourmet meal, which i still sometimes eat for nostalgic purposes. 

We would also split a Monster, because i was too scared to drink a full one at the time.

We had a bluetooth speaker we would listen to music on instead of the stations radio. We mostly listened to Skankin Pickle, Reel Big Fish, Mustard Plug, Smash Mouth, and others.

There was an old man who would come in and tell us his stories from his life. He was a teacher in the '60s, but was still very mentally sharp. Starting out, i disliked hearing him talk for a couple hours. When i actually began listening to his stories, they were enjoyable. I really miss his stories. I never got his last name and i moved far away, so i don't know if he is still alive. Thinking about him passing makes me sad, because i grew to view him as a grandpa figure.

I stopped working overnights at gas stations, then began working overnights at a restaurant. After that, i restarted my Day Shift Life, which i still dislike and still can't get used to after all these years.

I have an interview for another overnight position this Sunday (see my previous post for details). I hope I get it. I really miss overnights.

Fun Fact: Overnights are also special to me because i met my husband when HE worked somewhere overnight. Stopped at the right place, at the right time, on the right night off.

1pr2wdx,https://www.reddit.com/r/HiltonGrandVacation/comments/1pr2wdx/how_i_survive_timeshare_presentation/,How I survive timeshare presentation,"Profile: like weekend get away, have Plat + Surpass card.

Stay at HGV in Vegas, room is big and nice yet service is minimal. Also annoyed by the 25 / night parking fee. Come with the mindset of not buying and sit through the presentation, so I pay attention to the bad point of the hotel, such as very few cars parked - I used to argue that hey seems you don’t have many stayer right, also get electric shock here and there, seems the building has a bit of wiring issue. 

Start the presentation by checking in and greeted by one of the salesperson. There are loads of coffee, snacks, soft drinks available which is very nice. The sales person starts with some ice breaking chit chat what you do, how you like to vacation balabala, then led into a room for 30 minutes presentation, where a lady talked on slides about the HGV program and followed by a private session.

I started to play aggressive. I came with 3 Conrad room booked, one in LA, 400 dollars from FHR which basically means 80 dollars for me after FHR credit and 5x MR points, and 165/115 dollars dining credit + breakfast. And 2 other Conrad suites booked in NY, free with HH points and FNC, with 50 credit each day. Also I had the experience of booking 60 dollar curio collection hostel in Vegas minus 50 dollar quarterly credit with free parking and 30 dining credit. I listed them and asked the sales person why on earth should I not enjoy these semi free stay with better rooms and service but buy your time share program. 

The poor sales person, seems new to the job, gets stuck like a broken AI model. Responding to me with some standard answers which not even direct to my questions, and called his boss over. I was made to fill some questionnaires, what I put is roughly 4k a year vacation expenses. They show me some rooms and gave me a quote that they say matched my days of vacation, I immediately laughed because the deposit, assuming 5% interest + maintenance would be more than the 4k expenses, let alone the freedom of vacation I can enjoy, the FHR + quarterly credit + FNC from my cards, the dining credits and the effective 10% cash back from 1 dollar to 30 HH points from my cards.

Now the new sales person seems to be under shadow by his boss and doesn’t speak much, other than mechanically repeating some seemingly prememorized quotes. While the boss try to pressure me by naming a supposedly famous person who bought this (sorry forgot the name) and suggest why he would do that if it’s not good, I responded sarcastically that he might want to be philanthropic so that your sales person can keep your job. They finally gave up, and ended the sale. Before I leave, I was offered final 2 opportunities to have some another 3n stay for 199 and another talk which I declined. I collect my reward and clocked 1hr45min, but it feels way shorter than that and had fun myself.

So the lesson, do research first, it might be a good deal for you but it’s not for me. Just let them know that you have better deals elsewhere and would not consider the offer, if you are not keen on buying. I think they will see no point pressuring and let you go after all.

I slept in to catch up on last sleep and allowed myself to start writing later, as has because the new normal, and I ended up with a wonderful 820 words written for I'm Still Sisyphus. It was mostly the description and little bits of dialogue bridging to what I wrote two days ago. It is good to be back at it. Father also went out to get donuts as well today so I had a nice snack to munch on while I work.

It feels like I am so close and also so far away from the end of I'm Still Sisyphus. I am sure I've stated the exact same sentiment before. I have around three scenes left and then we are on to the last chapter. Last night, I wrote a little more outline for the next scene, which I was struggling with a lot for a while. The first outline I wrote is running parallel to the story as it is, going the same directions but enough steps to the side that the obstacles are a little different. I have been reading through what I have and cutting out pieces like it is a newspaper and I am making a ransom note. I have been held ransom by this story for seven months or so and soon I will finally be free.

I have enjoyed writing I'm Still Sisyphus. It is a welcome reprieve from what I wrote before and I am hopeful that is will someday find its audience. First though, I must find it's ending. I'm going to relax for a while and then work on the new outline over my evening coffee. Wish me luck.

I told myself that putting it into words would make it real, and if I didn’t do that, if I kept it vague, fuzzy, half-forgotten, maybe I could convince myself it was nothing more than a scare.

But then something else happened tonight, so I’m writing this while I still can.

Last night started normally, too normally. I worked late, the kind of shift where time blurs and you don’t notice how exhausted you are until you finally step outside. It was a little after 11 p.m., cold enough that the air stung my lungs. The streets were quiet, but not empty, just quiet enough to make you aware of every sound your own body makes, quiet enough that I could hear my own heart beating.

My walk home takes about twelve minutes. I know every crack in the pavement, every flickering streetlight. I like routines, they make you feel invisible.

Halfway through the walk, I cut through a small car park behind a row of flats. I’ve done it hundreds of times, that’s why the van didn’t register immediately.

White, no markings, parked awkwardly near the wall, angled slightly wrong, like it had been left in a hurry. I remember noticing that detail because it bothered me. I remember thinking, someone doesn’t care about parking tickets.

I had already walked past it when the door slid open, it was so quiet I didn’t hear it, just felt that sudden wrongness, like the world had shifted a fraction to the left, I turned around slowly.

A man stood there, half in shadow, one hand on the inside of the door, hood pulled low. I couldn’t see his eyes clearly, but I knew he was looking directly at me.

He smiled, not friendly, not threatening. Familiar, like he’d seen me before.

“Hey,” he said, voice relaxed. “You dropped something.”

I looked down, there was nothing, when I looked back up, he had stepped closer. I hadn’t heard his feet move. “I didn’t drop anything,” I said, my voice sounding too loud in my own ears.

His smile twitched, like he was amused by my answer.“You sure?” he asked. “Happens all the time.” The van door slid open wider, that’s when I saw the second man.

He was sitting inside, low and still, like he’d been waiting in that exact position for a long time. His hands rested on his knees, fingers flexing slowly, rhythmically. He wasn’t smiling, he wasn’t frowning, he was watching me the way you watch traffic before crossing the road.

Judging distance, timing. The first man took another step toward me, something inside me snapped into place then. No thoughts, no logic, just one overwhelming certainty. If he touches you, you’re not coming back.

I ran, I didn’t scream, I didn’t look back. My legs moved so fast they burned, my breath coming out in short, ugly gasps. I heard footsteps behind me, heavy, purposeful, and for a split second I was sure a hand was going to grab my coat.

I cut into the narrow alley between buildings, nearly slipping on wet concrete. My shoulder slammed into a wall, I kept going, I didn’t stop until I burst out onto the main road, where the streetlights were brighter and a car passed close enough that I could feel the rush of air, the footsteps stopped.

I stood there shaking, pretending to scroll through my phone so I wouldn’t look like prey. When I finally dared to glance back down the alley, it was empty, no van, no men.

I walked home the long way, sticking to lit streets, keys threaded between my fingers. Every shadow looked wrong, every engine sound made my stomach drop.

When I got inside, I locked the door, then I checked the windows, then I sat on the kitchen floor and waited for my heart to slow down.

I didn’t call the police, I kept telling myself there wasn’t enough to report, that I’d imagined the second man, that maybe it was a failed robbery, or some kind of sick joke.

I slept maybe two hours, this morning, I tried to act normal. Showered, drank coffee I couldn’t taste, laughed at something on my phone a second too late.

That’s when I went outside and saw the note, it was tucked neatly under my windscreen wiper. Folded once, no envelope.

Inside, written in careful, tidy handwriting; wrong place, next time. My car wasn’t parked near the car park, it was parked directly outside my building.

I stood there for a long time, reading it again and again, until a neighbour walked past and asked if I was okay. I smiled and said yes, I wasn’t.

All day, I felt watched, every white van made my chest tighten, I checked my mirrors constantly, I changed my route home. Tonight, I made sure someone was on the phone with me the entire walk back, nothing happened, I started to relax. Then, about twenty minutes ago, my phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number. No text, just a photo.

It’s grainy, taken at night. The angle is slightly off, like the person holding the phone was trying not to be noticed.

It’s the back of my head, I can tell exactly when it was taken, because I’m wearing the same jacket I wore last night. And if you zoom in, if you really look, you can see the reflection in the glass of a parked car in front of me, a white van, parked across the street.

Westover Ballet presents their final performance of the ""Nutcracker 1918"", a unique adaptation of the classic Nutcracker ballet inspired by a Pulaski, VA native. The guns in France at last are quiet. The boys come home and are reunited with their loved ones. Gone are the brutal months of trench warfare and the anxious months spent waiting at home. Families can once again celebrate together, singing “Peace on earth, Goodwill toward men.” This is the backdrop for the story of young Clara, eagerly waiting for her brother Perry to return. Westover Ballet’s Nutcracker 1918 takes her on a journey of vivid imaginations and finally brings her to a heartwarming conclusion. Our story is inspired by the WWI journal of Pulaski native, Robert Perry Millirons, and was first performed in 2018. Perry Millirons really lived in Pulaski, Virginia. The opening letters read in Nutcracker 1918 are taken from his actual WWI journal, and the character of Clara’s brother onstage is dressed in Perry’s actual WWI uniform. Tickets are available online in advance and at the door.

The true heroine, however, is Clara, the maid’s humble and kind-hearted daughter. Through her selflessness and generosity, Clara receives the magical Nutcracker, leading us on an enchanting journey through the Land of Sweets. But that’s not all, this production takes thoughtful steps to keep the audience engaged with newly added countries and choreography you won’t see in any other Nutcracker.

1pr2is6,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1pr2is6/the_catman_cometh/,The Catman cometh,"While working for months on Warwick as temporary workers we met hundreds of volunteers.  Each week a new group would arrive.  Some were there on longer assignments like us for months at a time.  Most were able to come for 2 - 6 weeks on average.  So it was a revolving door of new faces.  It was all pretty standard for JW land when meeting new ones.  We would try to seek them out to sit with them for lunch to get to know them.  A typical conversation covered where they're from, what crew they're on, how long was their assignment. etc.

My husband and I were on the electrical crew as my husband had decades in the trades.  It was common for wives to be paired with their husbands even if you don't have skills in his trade.  So that meant I got to spend months standing at the bottom of a ladder handing him tools and supplies all day.  And yes, I became obsessed with him keeping his nose hairs trimmed.  As expected there are some volunteers you click better with than others and we had several couples that we became quick friends with.  Most of the volunteers are kind, giving people, and we all thought we were working on the most important project on Earth.

On the other hand some volunteers are just straight up weirdos!  And as expected they were usually the single brothers over 40 that still lived at home!  Surprisingly they would be assigned to our crew with no prior experience or really any exposure to the trades.  That meant our crew overseer would assign them to us to ""give them something to do"" so they could do their time there, have a good experience, and take it back to their home congregation.  So we came up with various busy work things they couldn't really screw up.

One new round of volunteers had a very particular weirdo.  Single brother, was originally from France (he told us that daily) and apparently had no idea why he was there or what the project was.  How did his local brothers even sign off on his application?  Why was he even there?  He was that strange.  I have since come to learn of congregations just so sick of them the elders ""encouraged them to apply"" so they could have a break from them for a few weeks.  His elders had even put together the money for his plane ticket as he had never had a job and no money.  We got to babysit him for 3 weeks!

I knew the first day something was very off with our French man.  We would find him talking to himself a lot, full conversations.  We ended up just giving him a broom and told him just look for sawdust piles, which he never did any sweeping.  Just wander the hallways with a broom.  One night I was telling my husband I didn't want to be anywhere near our new friend and he creeped me out.  As the loving elder he was, my husband told me I was being too judgmental and should try to get to know him better and look for his good qualities.

I told my husband you first!  Go right ahead and get to know our new friend better.  If I'm wrong I will happily admit it.  Challenge accepted and my husband said first thing tomorrow he would go straight to the French man and get to know him.  True to his word my husband found our friend and invited him to sit and have coffee together so he could get to know him.  The French man was delighted to have someone listen to him!  I was around the hallway with another one of the wives pretending to sort supplies so we could eavesdrop on their conversation.  Now I have to tell you my husband is a no nonsense man of few words, typical construction guy.

The first thing the French man said was ""I like cats!""  I could see my husband's face change as he said that was nice, he likes cats too.  But the French man really likes cats as he continues on ""I like house cats, all house cats, every color.  I like lions, lionesses, tigers, cheetahs, pumas, mountain lions, lynx, leopards, panthers, every kind of cat"".  I could see my husband start to die a little.  Me and the other wife were almost chocking we were laughing so hard!  And then the French man went in for the kill!  A moment that will live in infamy!  He said ""I let my cat's give birth on my chest.""  My husband was losing it and said ""what are you talking about?""  The French man pats his chest lovingly and said ""Right here""!  ""When my cats are ready to give birth I take my shirt off and they crawl up on my chest.  I'll lay there all day with her and the newborns.  I want to be the first thing they see when they come out.  That's how they stay bonded to me.""  He then pats his chest again for emphasis and says again ""Right here"".

My husband can't take any more at that point and made some excuse to go find the blueprints.  The other wife had to run to the bathroom as she was about to pee her pants!  What started as a simple challenge was forever part of our crew from then on.  Whenever we would pass our fellow crew members in the hallway we would all pat our chests and say ""Right here"".  It quickly spread to the other overseers and they were opening safety meetings with the ""Right here"" pat.  I'm sure our French man has no idea what a gift he gave us that day.  He returned back to his home congregation and we never heard from him again.  Legend has it some Bethelites are still wandering the halls patting their chests.",13,1766195691.0,exjw,7,0.88,False

Westover Ballet presents their final performance of the ""Nutcracker 1918"", a unique adaptation of the classic Nutcracker ballet inspired by a Pulaski, VA native. The guns in France at last are quiet. The boys come home and are reunited with their loved ones. Gone are the brutal months of trench warfare and the anxious months spent waiting at home. Families can once again celebrate together, singing “Peace on earth, Goodwill toward men.” This is the backdrop for the story of young Clara, eagerly waiting for her brother Perry to return. Westover Ballet’s Nutcracker 1918 takes her on a journey of vivid imaginations and finally brings her to a heartwarming conclusion. Our story is inspired by the WWI journal of Pulaski native, Robert Perry Millirons, and was first performed in 2018. Perry Millirons really lived in Pulaski, Virginia. The opening letters read in Nutcracker 1918 are taken from his actual WWI journal, and the character of Clara’s brother onstage is dressed in Perry’s actual WWI uniform. Tickets are available online in advance and at the door.

The true heroine, however, is Clara, the maid’s humble and kind-hearted daughter. Through her selflessness and generosity, Clara receives the magical Nutcracker, leading us on an enchanting journey through the Land of Sweets. But that’s not all, this production takes thoughtful steps to keep the audience engaged with newly added countries and choreography you won’t see in any other Nutcracker.

Honorable mentions:

* **Toxic sorbet** scales poison with shield so it helps the gingerbread house going crazy at the 2nd cast so it's way faster
* 3s cd / 4s haste **Microwave** thanks to **Hyper Focus**
* Perma hasted thanks to **Toxic Coffee**
* **Honed Strike** in case fight gets boring
* **Restorative Eggs** to counter poison builds

The rest is moot at this point (shield on crit? lol who cares)  
If you dont one shot me very quickly I WILL scale faster than you. My perma hasted items each shield for... 20% of my total shield (40% for shield items).  
Maybe very hardcore burn pyg with double oinkment around a shiny ice luge AND very big heal scaling? (but I guess this would be 50 times rarer than one shot builds anyway)

I would have preferred a more worthy adversary to showcase this insanity, my 9th victory against a shield stacker pyg (he tried at least) was way cooler

The vastness of regional differences that history and media introduced me to during my youngest years swept me away and sparked my interest in penpalling. That was before it was easier to meet someone halfway across the world than next door.

What I'd like is to penpal with a person and not penpal for the sake of penpalling. The culture of 'receiving something other than junk and bills in the mail' was never for me. I want a connection, and someone to engage with on a personal level that happens to take the form of penpalling.

Snail mail letters/packages and e-mails are my ideals. Some chat and the e-mail side of things is preferred before the former. We need to become familiar with each other to make sure we’re a good fit for something that transcends text on a screen.

Sharing this in case it can be helpful for anyone in the future <3  


**Main takeaways**

* Your real friends and family are showing up for YOU, not your aesthetic. They’d much rather give you and your partner a hug and dance with you than to gawk at your flowers or drool over the caviar you’re serving them. No matter how large your budget, you can always spend *more* on any given category - I certainly found myself spiraling on some of these details during the planning process. Our day was beautiful, but especially upon reflection, so much of that is because of the people. At the end of the day, I’m just so grateful that we got to celebrate with them. I think what was most worth it in terms of spend was that we hosted multiple events over multiple days so we could spend more time with our guests. Remember to savor this special moment with all your people coming to you!!!
* Video had an outsized impact and I'm really glad we opted for full coverage. I was so emotional during our vows that I couldn’t remember everything I/my partner said, same with the speeches. Looking back at our photos makes me smile, but nothing beats that visceral reaction and watching our videos makes me happy cry.
* A lot can go wrong, but that's okay. My heels broke 10 minutes before I was supposed to walk down the aisle lol. One of our groomsmen walked down the aisle on the wrong side. We forgot to give our planner the signage for the ceremony. One of the shuttles got lost and then got stuck in traffic in some street fair festival a few blocks away. Too many drinks in one of our guests brought up politics and there were some punches thrown before an unc stepped in. And probably a million other little things that I can't remember anymore. Shit happens, but it's okay. Looking back, they're already funny little stories and I can say that the day was imperfectly perfect.



**Venue + F&B: $60k**

Included passed hor d’ourevers, oyster bar, 5 hours of open bar, 6-course dinner, and 3-tier cake. We got really lucky here because we were able to host our wedding at one of our favorite restaurants for a price that was incredible compared to how expensive catered dry chicken and steak can be. Since the venue is a restaurant with a cohesive theme, it meant we didn’t feel like we had to spend on rentals (tables, chairs, linens, plates, silverware, etc). I should note that it’s a higher-end restaurant so the interior design is very thoughtful and all the furniture and plates were really high quality.



**Photo + video: $20k**

Full coverage for the weekend, including the night before and the morning after. They absolutely crushed it, and on a personal level were so down-to-earth and kind to work with. I honestly think they could’ve easily charged 2x as much. We had a slightly shorter timeline for booking photo+video (we booked 6 months before), which meant that all of the really Instagram-famous/trendy/popular Instagram photographers in our city were no longer available 😂 we didn’t intentionally plan it this way, but I admit that we definitely wouldn’t have ended up with the team that we had because I probably would’ve been allured by one of the publication-heavy “popular” photographers. I’m actually so grateful and really glad that it didn’t shake out that way because our team was beyond amazing.



**Planner: $15k**

Full service planner, which included herself and an extra day of coordinator. Overall was very happy that we had a planner, and on wedding day she really showed UP. I was initially drawn to her work since she had a great eye for design and helped us put together our mood boards and design proposals. During the vendor procurement process, we weren’t super impressed with the preparation of materials, due diligence, and communication style. Full disclosure, my partner and I have both worked in professional services so I think our standards here may have been a bit unfair. The last two weeks leading up to the wedding, she was so helpful taking care of little details and hiccups that came up, and on the day of, she managed everyone (guests, families, and vendor teams) so effectively.



**Floral: $20k**

Ceremony: grounded pieces and aisle markers (re-purposed for reception)

Reception: large ceiling install, low arrangements and candles for the tables

Personals: bridal bouquet and 4 bridesmaids bouquets

Very happy about how it turned out, but florals caused me a lot of unnecessary stress leading up to our wedding. A lot of my friends told me that there’d be at least one “thing” that I’d keep freaking out over before my wedding. For some, it’s their dress, for others, photographer, for me, it was *floral*. I was so indecisive and probably changed our floral layouts 3 times before the deadline 1 month before.



**Wedding attire: $25k**

$15k for bride, $5k for groom, $5k for diamond earrings and wedding bands. Had the most fun in this category just picking out looks for different events and trying on all types of different styles. I could write a whole post about this topic alone so will keep it short here :)



**Hair and make up: $3k including trial**

I paid for all 4 of my bridesmaids’ HMUA as well. The artists were great, and a very calming presence to work with the morning of.



**Music: $5k**

$2k for string quartet for the ceremony, $3k for DJ during cocktail hour, dinner, and reception. Both teams were great. Strings were beautiful and DJ kept the dance floor going strong. We considered getting a band but unfortunately the good bands we wanted to work with were already booked for our weekend, and we got a few quotes from some who could travel that were $15k so decided to skip. Like photo+video, another place we “unintentionally” saved money 😂 



**Other events: $25k**

Welcome party the night before: $15k, which included rehearsal dinner and drinks. About 75% of our guests came to our welcome party which was 4 hours, and it gave us a chance to catch up with a lot of people before our main day. It was also so fun seeing guests from our different worlds mingle and get to know each other - some of them were having such a good time that there was a group who continued the night and went out together after! We wrapped up at around 11 so that we could be reasonably well rested for the next day.

After party: $5k. Oops. Went to a club. We don’t go out that often anymore but somehow our friends and even some family members rallied with us until 4 a.m. Absolutely no regrets.

Brunch: $5k. Rented out another restaurant for brunch. Most of our guests were from out of town so it was lovely to get a few extra hours with everyone before they started heading out.



**Misc: $25k**

Printed goods: $2k - addresses were hard to track down and I didn’t care that much about stationery

Transportation: $5k - shuttles to and from venue

Gifts for bridesmaids, groomsmen, and guests: $3k

Tips: $15k  


**Total: $200k** give or take  
There were some pieces that we already owned which made its way into our wedding looks which I didn't include, as well as food and coffee for getting ready the morning of, getting nails done with my bridesmaids, etc.

How do I even begin this story without it turning into an analysis of my ex-boyfriend or my own mental state? A few things to mention first: we met on a dating app and had a really long, nice phone call. People often tell me that I rush into things and that I am pretty naive. He is two years older than me, and due to an injury as well as other past poor decisions, he decided not to return to school for an unknown amount of time to finish his degree.

He pressured me into dating him. I wanted to take things slower, but he kept asking and reassuring me that everything would be better if we just committed. Eventually, I did, reluctantly, because of how fast everything was moving. I met his friends and family very early on, which shocked me given the speed of the relationship. We became increasingly intimate. We took some time before having sex. We worked through it slowly due to past negative events I went through, though we were both very physically drawn to each other. We could not keep our hands off each other, and it is important to note that he lived in the same apartment as his mother.

As time passed, it became difficult to adjust to a dynamic where it felt like everyone had a say in our relationship. At times, I could overhear him complaining about spending money, even though he had been nonchalant about it during our first few dates. I was transparent about my situation. I was focused on studying, wanted to go to grad school, and relied mostly on my parents financially. Eventually, because I was constantly at his mother’s apartment and we were having sex all the time, and we only ever left to go on expensive restaurant dates, she lost her patience and kicked me out.

As this tension grew, so did the tension between his friends and me. They rebuked me, accusing me of being stuck-up or asking for too much, even though he never clearly communicated expectations around money or his ability to provide food outside of my campus. I wished he had been clear from the beginning. Was it wrong for me to expect to be fed when all we did for hours was switch between homework and sex while he switched between sex, video games, and alcohol?

I kept breaking up with him, and his friends would reach out, convincing me to take him back. I still question why I stayed. Was it because of the sex? Because I fell for him even though everyone told me he was not good for me? Did I attach because of intimacy? Did I convince myself he was the best I would ever do, or did I let him convince me of that?

Eventually, I grew resentful. He wanted constant contact and validation, checked my phone, and expected me to play nice with friends and family who clearly disliked me. Over time, it felt like he wanted me to be both a housewife and the breadwinner. I finally gave up and broke up with him for the eighth time.

To anyone reading this, I really tried. I tried to understand his financial situation, the scars from his only previous relationship, and how his parents’ divorce affected him. I tried to help him, and he tried to help me in his own way. Still, I became  unstable because of how deprioritized and insecure his inconsistency and alcohol-like tendencies made me feel, tendencies that his family and friends enabled.

I love him deeply. But the stress of my major, my family being on my case after finding out about him, and my overall lack of support pushed me to pull the plug. I crashed out badly. I cut up his clothes, cussed him out through messages, lashed out at his friends, and completely lost control again. I drank alcohol, a Celsius, and a Starbucks coffee all together to pass my finals. I am not proud of this.

What I am trying to ask is this: how am I supposed to feel okay or have any sense of self-worth when the one man who treated me with some level of respect still fell miles short of a relationship worth my time and love? I clung to him so tightly that the day before the final breakup, I called him to pick me up just so I could have someone hold me and keep me from hurting myself. I really did love him, who writes that many love letters to someone and be treated this poorly.

TL;DR: I met my ex two months ago very tumultuous relationship, reflecting on relationship how do I navigate romantic relationships better, so I don't keep getting taken advantage of.

A buddy of mine said some good things about Reddit, so I figured I’d give it a shot! I've been traveling across the country (working remotely) and have been having a blast. It’s definitely had its high and lows, and I've met a bunch of different folks along the way -- but finding those lasting connections is obviously a little tough with this lifestyle. Hence why I'm here on Reddit. 

Here's a bit about me:

* I'm 40, male, and work in the medical field.
* I’ve been traveling full-time since last summer. I started on the east coast (NE), made my way through the Ozarks, and now I’m slowly meandering west.
* I love cooking, especially when I can do it outside. My go-to is a cast-iron skillet breakfast hash with whatever’s on hand -- potatoes, eggs, peppers. Hot sauce is a must, let's be real, haha.
* I'm a big reader. Right now it’s a mix of Steinbeck, some travel essays, and a book on neuroscience I like to pretend I understand.
* I used to be a runner, but now I’m more of a ""slow hiker who stops for photos and snacks"" if you get what I mean.
* I grew up near the ocean (though in the city). I'm not afraid to laugh at myself, like the time I accidentally locked my keys (and shoes) inside the van at a rest stop in the middle of nowhere. Hey, at least it made for a fun story, right?
* I’m pretty low-key. I'm content with campfires, podcasts, stargazing, and the occasional dive bar conversation with strangers.
* I value good communication and people who can sit comfortably in both silence and long talks.
* My playlists jump from indie folk to old soul to 90s hip-hop, depending on the mood.
* I try to practice gratitude, even on WiFi-free days.

What I'm Looking For in a Penpal:

* Someone grounded, kind, and emotionally intelligent.
* someone who’s curious about the world, loves learning, and doesn’t mind taking the scenic route once in a while.
* I’m drawn to folks who can find beauty in simple things like a good cup of good coffee, a quiet morning - stuff like that.
* You don’t have to be a traveler (though that’s always a bonus), just open-minded, thoughtful, and looking to connect

1pr232u,https://www.reddit.com/r/mbta/comments/1pr232u/my_review_of_the_first_phase_of_the_better_bus/,My review of the first phase of the Better Bus Project,"It's been a year now since the T implemented the first phase of the Better Bus Project on certain bus routes.  
As a Revere resident, some of the routes I utilize have been included in the phase, the 110 Wonderland to Wellington, and 116 Wonderland to Wellington.   
I had posted some comments offering my opinions on the change just days after they had occurred. Most of the comments ahead pretty much repeat what I had stated earlier with some added comments.

Overall, sorry to say, not overly impressed.  The only positive thing I could see is the frequent service at all hours and days.  This is a blessing for many workers who don't have the typical M-F 9-5 office jobs.  These include people working in the hospitality, retail, healthcare, and food services industries that usually have to work weekends and odd hours.  If I recall correctly the 110 route ran about every hour on Sundays.  
Now, let's get to what I don't like.  While the 15 minute headers may be an improvement from the previous schedules, 15 minutes is still, in my opinion a long time to wait for a bus.  Ten minutes would be more ideal.  Imagine having a long day at work and you just want to get home.  You arrive at the station only to see your bus pulling away and have to wait another 15 minutes for the next one.  In the morning, that 15 minutes could mean having enough time to wait in line for coffee before work on not.  And keep in mind that 15 minutes is under normal circumstances.  If there are delays due to traffic, disabled buses, ghost buses, weather, etc, that 15 minutes can turn into 20, 25, or even 30 minutes or more.

The other huge mistake the T made in my opinion was eliminating the route 117.   For riders traveling to and from East Boston/Chelsea and Beach Street Revere, what was once a one seat ride has now become a two seat ride.  Also, by having the 117 available you can reduce the amount of time riders have to wait for the next bus if the miss either the 110 or the 116 bus, especially if they stagger the schedules.  So if your at Wonderland and need to get to Downtown Revere, if you miss the 110, instead of waiting 15 minutes for the next 110 maybe one would have to wait only 7 minutes for the 117 and vice versa. The same thing for those commuting to and from Chelsea and East Boston.  If you miss either the 116 or 117 you would only have to wait around 7 minutes for the next bus rather than 15 with only the 116 bus running.

Now, this was a review on the the changes from my perspective. I realize there have been changes on other routes and maybe those here who utilize those routes may have their own analysis and would like to weigh in, or perhaps they're are those who use the same routes mentioned above and have a more positive opinion on the changes.",3,1766194386.0,mbta,1,0.72,False

We started dating in high school. At the start of the relationship, I noticed that there were some red flags, but I took them in stride since we were both young and somewhat immature. Once we got to college and I started maturing, I began to notice them more clearly. For example, after an argument one night, we had a talk about how he was overly dependent on me, meaning he was always following me everywhere. I would try to go out by myself or with friends, and he was there. Every class I took, he was always there. Anytime I went out to eat, he was there. Recently, we had an argument about his faith and my lack of it. It came up during a meal, during which he prays beforehand and I don't. This has never been an issue, I have always tried to be respectful. I sat down to eat, and I added sugar to my coffee and had a small sip. He came to the table and saw me mid sip and said that I was being disrespectful and that I “couldn’t even wait for him.” I apologized, but he was still upset. I turned 22 recently. We had plans to go out as a friend group to a club, but we got into an argument the day of, and I told him to cancel the plans that day. He dismissed me but then later that night he went out with his friends. We were barely texting throughout the night. During that time I checked his location, and he was at the club. I confronted him, and his excuse was, “I just didn’t want to waste the tickets.” This frustrates me because he never “allowed” me to go out by myself or with friends. Another time, we were sitting at a park and he was showing me some pictures. I grabbed his phone to look at them better, and he got a notification on Instagram which displayed a text from a girl I did not know. I asked him about it, and he answered that he just wanted to make new friends. We had previously established that our boundaries included that we wouldn’t go out of our way to add random people.

Currently, we are on a break. It has been a break for a while, but it hasn’t really felt like one. We still talk, text, and see each other almost every day because of our class schedule. We established boundaries before the break, but he hasn’t been following them. He followed two girls I don’t know, his excuse was that he followed them because it was a step to moving on and for other petty reasons. He is revengeful. Furthermore, he has been going to parties with friends who continually tell him to break up with me. He is a nice guy, and we usually have a good time, but the lows are really low. He has been there through some really tough times. He has helped me grow, and I have seen him grow. I still really care for him, and it would hurt to break up, but I don’t know if I can overlook these problems. I know nobody is perfect, I am certainly am not. I am struggling to break up as well because we have the same classes and social circle so it’s been a difficult decision.

1pr1xd4,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1pr1xd4/psychology_of_young_men_regarding_romance/,Psychology of young men regarding romance,"I think something that might help with understanding young men in online spaces and young men in general is that some of these guys just feel used romantically. Regardless of whether or not that's the case in reality, I know plenty of non red pill young guys in their early 20's who have really done their best when dating, who are just absolutely burnt out.

And there isn't really any advice for young men from non red pill spaces except ""well go get another woman"". I will say, as any young man knows, being the one to pursue and pay and plan every interaction just for a woman to go ""wow you're so wonderful, not feeling it anymore, had a great time goodbye"" is a very grinding experience. It's also infuriating to then open a social media app and see ""the bar is on the floor"" being thrown around when you just put your all into a romantic interaction. You can only get so many college rejection letters before you stop wanting to go to college. Obviously, women are well within their right to decline going forward at any time, but it definitely has some of my good friends feeling bitter about their interactions.

I think young men feel like they're just paying for a women's ""experience"", and once that 3 or 4 date sparkle wears off - she just goes to the next guy and the cycle repeats (in their mind). Regardless of whether or not it's completely okay for a woman to do (which I stated it is so don't crucify me), it is a net losing position for young men who are doing their best to try to form long term romantic connections, because young men are the side that is expected to pay a premium for the interactions. I think a lot of young men, like women, just want to be understood and told that they finally aren't the one ""fucking up"" even though they're doing their best.

This is also where coffee date culture comes around. You can only plan so many $100 mini golf/driving range dates until you realize that the model is unsustainable for someone who works for a living. I think men would invest more in dates if they felt like that investment actually had an effect on a woman's perception of them in an actionable way.

Hopefully a bunch of people have thoughts to add to my thoughts. I'd love to hear from women regarding their thoughts on what I've mentioned. Ok everybody have a nice day.",35,1766193934.0,self,17,0.9,False

This has happened several times to me and to other people I know. Also, there are stories like that about men and women. So, I don't think it's a gender thing.

When has this become a common expectation in society? I always thought other people were weird for expecting that, but it has happened so often that I am now considering that I might be the weird one.

Not looking so much for a stuffy, formal ""high tea"" experience like the Empress, but a kind of third wave, do it right, offer various regional styles tea service. Nice, quiet, hopefully something with a view or a nice garden or something pleasant out the windows.

Google was NO help, so wanted to ask here.

I have a more intense and unique tongue for coffee so wanted to ask here where people are more experienced than me. I’ll attempt to describe here but please don’t hesitate to comment if I missed a detail or two:

I’m looking for a very light roast, acidic, dry, sharp, non-fruity, intense coffee. I typically use an espresso machine or French press.

I have been recommended Luna because of its lighter profile and more intense taste, Which is good but I want to see if there’s something even closer to what I’m after.

Thank you in advance from your intermediately knowledgeable coffee lover.",0,1766193289.0,barista,4,0.33,False

How do I even begin this story without it turning into an analysis of my ex-boyfriend or my own mental state? A few things to mention first: we met on a dating app and had a really long, nice phone call. People often tell me that I rush into things and that I am pretty naive. He is two years older than me, and due to an injury as well as other past poor decisions, he decided not to return to school for an unknown amount of time to finish his degree.

He pressured me into dating him. I wanted to take things slower, but he kept asking and reassuring me that everything would be better if we just committed. Eventually, I did, reluctantly, because of how fast everything was moving. I met his friends and family very early on, which shocked me given the speed of the relationship. We became increasingly intimate. We took some time before having sex. We worked through it slowly due to past negative events I went through, though we were both very physically drawn to each other. We could not keep our hands off each other, and it is important to note that he lived in the same apartment as his mother.

As time passed, it became difficult to adjust to a dynamic where it felt like everyone had a say in our relationship. At times, I could overhear him complaining about spending money, even though he had been nonchalant about it during our first few dates. I was transparent about my situation. I was focused on studying, wanted to go to grad school, and relied mostly on my parents financially. Eventually, because I was constantly at his mother’s apartment and we were having sex all the time, and we only ever left to go on expensive restaurant dates, she lost her patience and kicked me out.

As this tension grew, so did the tension between his friends and me. They rebuked me, accusing me of being stuck-up or asking for too much, even though he never clearly communicated expectations around money or his ability to provide food outside of my campus. I wished he had been clear from the beginning. Was it wrong for me to expect to be fed when all we did for hours was switch between homework and sex while he switched between sex, video games, and alcohol?

I kept breaking up with him, and his friends would reach out, convincing me to take him back. I still question why I stayed. Was it because of the sex? Because I fell for him even though everyone told me he was not good for me? Did I attach because of intimacy? Did I convince myself he was the best I would ever do, or did I let him convince me of that?

Eventually, I grew resentful. He wanted constant contact and validation, checked my phone, and expected me to play nice with friends and family who clearly disliked me. Over time, it felt like he wanted me to be both a housewife and the breadwinner. I finally gave up and broke up with him for the eighth time.

To anyone reading this, I really tried. I tried to understand his financial situation, the scars from his only previous relationship, and how his parents’ divorce affected him. I tried to help him, and he tried to help me in his own way. Still, I became  unstable because of how deprioritized and insecure his inconsistency and alcohol-like tendencies made me feel, tendencies that his family and friends enabled.

I love him deeply. But the stress of my major, my family being on my case after finding out about him, and my overall lack of support pushed me to pull the plug. I crashed out badly. I cut up his clothes, cussed him out through messages, lashed out at his friends, and completely lost control again. I drank alcohol, a Celsius, and a Starbucks coffee all together to pass my finals. I am not proud of this.

What I am trying to ask is this: how am I supposed to feel okay or have any sense of self-worth when the one man who treated me with some level of respect still fell miles short of a relationship worth my time and love? I clung to him so tightly that the day before the final breakup, I called him to pick me up just so I could have someone hold me and keep me from hurting myself. I really did love him, who writes that many love letters to someone and be treated this poorly.

TL;DR: I met my ex two months ago very tumultuous relationship, reflecting on relationship how do I navigate romantic relationships better, so I don't keep getting taken advantage of.
