I, 30F, met up with a guy, 30M, last weekend. We went to school together, were never friends, but reconnected a few years ago over social media. We established a casual friendship over the years, sometimes messaging one another. I always wanted to meet up in real life, but was in a relationship with another man and knew that would bother my now ex-partner.

My partner and I are no longer together and I was visiting my family for the holidays and decided to message this guy from social media, asking if he wanted to hang out (coffee and chat).
He enthusiastically responded that he'd enjoy that.

We met up last weekend at a coffee shop and i thought it went very well. We had great, deep talks. He started really asking me about my previous relationship, how it is going now, etc... I was very clear that I am single and over that relationship. To be honest, towards the end, it felt a bit like a date. We hung out for several hours and only parted ways to go home after the café closed.

As we were leaving, he gave me a full hug (not a half, one-armed hug) and said he'll text me (he wanted to send me some links to things we discussed) and said we should hang out again before I go back home after the holidays.he said he enjoyed our time together.

And then...radio silence. I texted him a few times afterwards about other topics like books, and he enthusiastically responded. He also said he'll send me the links soon.
And then nothing. So, I just straight forward asked if he still wanted to hang out again before I return home. No Response. Then, two days ago, I asked him if I misterpreted our time together and just mentioned that I genuinely enjoyed it and would love to continue building up a friendship with him (so it was clear how I felt). I tried to word my message so that it didn't sound like I was mad at him.

He didn't even leave me on read, he juat hasn't even opened it, but I see he is sometimes active on social media.

So - why? Did he just decide he wasn't interested afterall? Or am I pushing too hard for a response? Up until now, we had sometimes talked on social media, but it wasn't constant back and forth. I understand not everyone responds constantly, but it's obvious now he is ignoring me. Very mixed signals imo.

I think the situation is unfortunate and I was actually pretty interested in him (as a friend and maybe even more tbh). I'll get over it, lol. But, I'm just wondering why people do this?",1,1736210891.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

1hvexg3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hvexg3,"We Ditched the Dining Room, Now What?","We have lived in our house for 13 years. When we moved in, I dutifully set up this space as the dining room because that’s what the floor plan said, duh. It was always a little tight, if it had been even a foot larger in both directions, they would’ve been much better flow around the dining room table. We have a large eat in kitchen and on impulse this year. I set up our meal on a 6 foot folding banquet table as a buffet, and we all sat at the kitchen table. Fast forward to Christmas, we did the same thing again, and nobody seemed to mind and actually felt more comfortable.

So now it’s a week after New Year’s, and I have sold my table, chairs, and sideboard. We have plans to install white built-in upper and lower cabinets, wrapping around the corner where the china cabinet remains. We are thinking glass front upper cabinets and this would take the place of the storage we lose with the dining furniture gone. (The china cabinet will then go.)  We would like the room to turn into a sitting room with more of a library/bourbon room bent. We already have a living room with baby grand piano and a family room. This will be more of an “away space” with no TV. We think we can fit three chairs and would like a coffee table or ottoman. I’d like a space to a puzzle in this room.

What would you do? Anything is fair game at this point. I just don’t want to paint the window and door trim, I’d like to keep it consistent with the rest of the house. 

The room is 11’6” x 12’6”.

1) Should all three chairs be the same? I’m leaning towards B & C being matching leather club chairs and A being a barrel/swivel chair to help keep the flow open from the foyer to the kitchen since that will become a path of travel which it never was before due to the dining table being in the way.

2) Wall color and rug can change or stay the same, open to all suggestions. 

3) What other furniture would you bring in? The only other thing I’d really like to bring in is a small chest on a stand that my grandfather made. It’s about 12” x 20” ",2,1736210728.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False

However, there was a lot of times where to me, it was obvious he didn’t like her that way. For example, she was texting him and jokingly reminded him that he owed her an iced coffee. So he said “I’ll find something else to put in your mouth”. So she said “damn. At least take a girl out first”. So then he said “ what do you think our dates in the past have been then?” (retroactively referring to the times they’d get coffee and make out in his car).

One day, they went out to the mall and had lunch together. And they ended up sleeping together in his car in the mall parking lot. And he ghosted her shortly after. Initially, I felt sorry for her.

I'm a 21-year-old man (57kg) and I've been getting very little sleep for the past 6 days, only 1 to 2 hours per night.

As usual, I go to bed around 11 p.m., except that I seem to be stuck in a state of semi-sleep, and in the end I end up waking up completely. I only manage to fall asleep around.
I've started to feel very hot for no reason, even though it's 18.5 degrees in my room. My hands quickly become clammy, I sometimes feel a wave of heat around my face, and sometimes I end up with sweat on my ankles and chest/neck.

I don't think it's the fault of my clothes + bedding, as the problem disappears in the morning when I'm almost ""cold"".

I don't drink anything exciting (tea, coffee), I eat light and 3 hours before going to bed, I'm no more stressed than usual. In general, my habits haven't changed at all.

Two weeks ago he fell and hit his head on the coffee table, managed to have a ping pong sized goose egg on the back of his head, and he didn't even she'd a single tear or stop when it happened...

At the same time, he can also be very dramatic (future thespian in the making). He will limp when he has the equivalent of a paper cut on his toe. A few weeks ago he tripped over the baby gate (he's just sooo graceful /s) as we were getting ready for school. He was limping but not really complaining too much. His teacher called me concerned because he was limping hard at school . I took him to the doctor tamhat afternoon and he was still limping there, but doc believed it was maybe a minor sprain. He woke up the next day perfectly fine, no limp or complaints! 

We'll just a few minutes ago he dropped a huge stack of magna tiles on his foot/toes and it bruised/swelled quickly, and broke the skin a little bit.

Baristas, who are often behind the counter for a few minutes crafting a custom drink, seem to be treated as if their work requires extra appreciation. Meanwhile, fast food workers, who might be doing everything from cooking and assembling food to managing long lines and dealing with customer complaints, don’t see that same kind of gratuity.

Why is it that we’re encouraged to tip at one type of service establishment, but not the other? Both jobs involve hard work and customer interaction, yet one is seen as more “tip-worthy” than the other. It’s a weird double standard that doesn’t always feel fair, especially considering that fast food employees are often in lower-wage positions with fewer opportunities for tipping.

Maybe it’s time we rethink who gets tipped and why. After all, every worker deserves recognition for their effort, no matter where they’re serving.",3,1736210197.0,Fremont,5,1.0,False
1hveqit,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1hveqit/return_and_report_attending_open_mic_sunday_for/,Return and Report: Attending Open Mic Sunday for the last time,"Last Sunday, I attended Fast Sunday (testimony meeting) for the first time since I removed my membership record from the MFMC and moved to a small Nordic country two years ago for my studies and work. I have some friends in the church, so I went to say goodbye to them before I leave for good. To be honest, the experience was eye-opening, and I couldn’t help but notice several things:

1. **The Church Is Feeling Really Sad** Despite the fact that the ward I attended is in the stake center building, only about 50 people showed up. I’d estimate that at least 60-70% of the congregation were older, long-time members. It was a stark contrast to what I remember from when I was more actively involved.
2. **The Testimonies** The testimonies shared were mostly about small, everyday miracles. Classic examples included stories like, ""I prayed to God and found my car keys,"" and other similar anecdotes. Some missionaries talked about ""miracles"" where they found a random contact who barely showed interest in the church, but they testified with confidence that God is hastening His work and gathering Israel—despite the ward's decline in membership.
3. **Emotional Testimonies** A few elderly women became tearful as they testified, sharing how much Jesus meant to them, almost as if He had just given them His last remaining kidney to save their life. It was a bit much to take in.
4. **The Sunday School Experience** After the service, I attended a Sunday school class for new investigators, as suggested by the missionaries. There were only three new attendees, while seven to eight missionaries (both young and senior) surrounded them, eager to share their message. When the new attendees, mostly of Asian background, mentioned their Buddhist beliefs—saying they saw Buddhism as more of a way of life than a belief in God—the missionaries all jumped in, testifying about how they knew there was a God and how He had a special plan for them. It was a bit amusing to watch, as the missionaries struggled to explain how the ultimate goal of life is not nirvana, but salvation in God's kingdom.

Overall, it was a melancholy experience for me. When I was still in the church, it felt full of energy, with young people and activities. But now, it feels like church has become a repetitive, dull experience, regurgitating the same, whitewashed messages about Joseph Smith, God, and Jesus for two hours.

Afterward, I had the chance to attend a Pentecostal church service with some friends. What a difference! There were at least 200-300 people in attendance, with a live band performing, engaging presentations, and even a coffee break for socializing afterward. It was so much more fun and engaging compared to the tired, uninspiring LDS service. I couldn't help but feel that, in this age of easy access to information, many young people are beginning to question the church’s teachings and its authority. Most have already left, and the few young people still in attendance seemed to be the ones with more social quirks.

It was a bittersweet experience for me, and it made me reflect on how far the church has come—or, perhaps, how much it has changed for the worse",2,1736210195.0,exmormon,0,1.0,False

I was a freshman in college sort of casually seeing/dating this guy from one of my classes (we were both 18 IIRC) and we had been in that casual talking stage for abt 3 weeks or so. We used to always hang out/study together at this one coffee shop on campus before the class we had together and a few hours before class one day he texted me and asked me if i wanted to hang out with him there and study for a little bit together. that day i happened to be starting my period and I have PMDD (meaning I get super bad PMS symptoms like nausea, vomiting, excruciating pains, basically become unable to function etc) so I was not really feeling the best and I told him I was feeling a bit sick (didn't mention that it was my period, just that I wasn't feeling well) but he was like ""awww I'm really bored though/I really wanted to hang out"" so I was just like whatever and went anyway. We were in the coffee place for like 10mins and I started to feel worse and get super queasy to the point where I was literally just holding down vomit and eventually had to run off to the bathroom and he saw me like dry heave a few times. Nothing actually came up until I reached the toilet so he didn't even actually see me vomit. He was acting really weirded out afterwards and walked me back to my dorm but we walked in almost complete silence (he was normally super talkative but was basically just ignoring me the entire time and looked really annoyed/irritated). After that he basically ghosted me, stopped texting me completely unless I texted first and even then he only sent one-word answers, declined hanging out anymore, would practically run out of class as soon as it ended or come late to avoid having to talk to me, etc. I even texted him a few times asking if something was wrong and he would respond with really short answers beating around the bush or just ignore me. I'm just wondering if this is like a common thing with guys? How has he never been around someone sick before as an 18yr old? What happens if he decides to have a kid someday and he has to take care of his wife while she has pregnancy nausea/morning sickness; would he just leave her? Genuinely nothing else happened; I got sick in front of him and he completely ghosted me. Is it some sort of major turn-off that I am unaware of or is he in the wrong here? He was other than this a completely normal and very nice guy, respectful, good-looking, had sisters, absolutely no other red flags. The only explanation I can think of is if he had some sort of OCD or germ phobia but even then couldn't he have just explained it to me when I asked what his problem was?

At 15 I got pregnant from a man who beat me regularly to the point of broken bones. At 16 I came back to my mom's house so that my baby wouldnt be killed. We lived in a small town and were visiting a larger City a couple hours away. 30 minutes into the drive back home they started screaming at each other and I had a panic attack and I started screaming at them too to stop screaming that I hate them and that's why I had to leave in the first place and to please stop. That's the first time I had ever yelled at them or raised my voice at all or actually stood up for myself at all I always kept my mouth completely shut and just did whatever I was told. In response she told me to go back to my boyfriend and get beat up then, and she kicked me out of the car with my week old son. I was 17 still bleeding heavily from giving birth and Stranded an hour and a half from a house I was afraid to be at but had nowhere else to go. I walked around aimlessly until I found a coffee shop to use the Wi-Fi. Then I found a bus station, took a city bus there bought a ticket and took the bus back to my mom's house crying in the entire time.

That was 11 years ago and up until a few days ago that was stored in my memory as something I had deserved for being so bad. A few days after that I did go back to my son's dad because I believed my mom. I didn't even question her. I needed to go get beat up so I could learn to be good enough for him and learn to be good enough for my mom and learn to be good enough to be treated well. I just never questioned it and I still think it's true because how could every man I met and my parents all think I deserve to get beat up if I don't. It doesn't make sense. I have to believe the evidence but now that I'm 28 and I look at 17-year-olds it kind of just blows my mind that she was able to treat me that badly.

He's a photographer, we're gaming buddies, he's big on cars, absolutely adores coffee, big Christian, and is a fairly adventurous guy. Finally, he drinks, I do not (don't mind going to a bar though). 

Right now, I've been considering taking him to the art museum so he can snap some photos. Additionally, he has a peculiar obsession for coffee shops in Raleigh so I might take him to a few of those that have caught his eye. Of course, I can and will ask him if there's something he'd like to do, but I still think it's my responsibility to have an itinerary. So any recommendations would be appreciated, thanks!

I usually do one month on and one month off to give my gut a break. I found mag o7 my last go around and it was a life saver, 2 capsules every night kept me regular-BM every morning. It eliminated all the gut issues- no gargling, churning, bloated stomach. I wanted to jump for joy because I could actually stay on this medication and not have the painful side effects. After two months of taking it every night- it stopped working. I’m curious if anyone has or had this problem and if switching to tirzep helped or made it worse. 

If you have anything natural that helps you go- please help a girl out. I also have asthma- severely and being on sema decreases the inflammation in my lungs and is like a miracle drug in that department- so I really am trying to stay on it. 

Ps- iv tried prune juice, apple juice, Taco Bell, coffee, stool softeners, fiber, oatmeal, probiotics and Miralax. Dont work even when Im not of GLP-1 meds unfortunately. I don’t have health insurance so linzess isn’t an option as it’s crazy expensive.

My sister, Lauren, has been married to her husband, Richard, for 14 years. They do not have any children together.

These past couple of years have been very difficult. My dad passed away last year, and my mom is in a nursing home and most likely will not be around much longer. They had struggled with age-related health challenges for many years. Lauren has also not been in good health in recent years as she has been struggling with an autoimmune disorder. Richard had been great with helping us care for my parents and caring for Lauren. He was her rock. He and Norm were very close too.

However, back in September, Richard suddenly began acting erratically and started doing a bunch of things that he didn't normally do (among other things he decided to purchase an expensive sports car). He also became extremely irritable and irrational. She said at times, he seemed disconnected from reality. This all came to a head when we were going to visit my mom in her nursing home. However, when we got there, Richard began making threatening comments towards Norm, before shoving him to the ground and saying that he was going to shoot him (he does not own a gun BTW) , and Lauren told me that he had thrown a coffee mug at her earlier earlier in the day.

Thankfully the kids were in school when this happened, so they didn't see any of it, but the owners of the nursing home refused to allow him inside to see my mother. They told him to get off their property, but he refused to do so. The police were called, and Richard was arrested for trespassing and resisting arrest. He later was released from jail but was then committed to an involuntary 72-hour hold at the mental hospital. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

I'm not going to go into detail about the long, complicated mess that followed, but in a nutshell, he's on medication and in therapy, and seems to be doing better now. However, this experience completely changed my opinion of him. I do not feel safe around him, and as a result, I did not invite him to our Thanksgiving dinner, in which Norm and I both invite various family members. I did invite Lauren, however. The kids asked where Uncle Richard was, and we told them that he was sick and wasn't up for a big dinner. Lauren was noticeably depressed during the dinner, and I later pulled her aside and asked her if Richard did anything else to her. She said no, he's back to his old self, and because we didn't invite him, he was spending Thanksgiving with a friend of his. The reason why she was upset was that we didn't invite him, and he was hurt that he wasn't invited. I told her that she needs to open her eyes to the fact that her husband is abusive. She told him that he isn't abusive, and that he was sick, is on medication, in therapy, and has support. I told her I'm glad that he was doing better, but I didn't feel comfortable around him. This upset her, and she left early.

Fast forward to Christmas. We were going to have another dinner. Lauren told me that Richard was still continuing see a therapist and take medication. He hadn't had any more violent episodes and was pretty much back to his old self. However, I still don't feel safe around him, and didn't invite him. Lauren said that Richard was very sorry about what happened, and was hurt that we didn't invite him, which made him depressed. This to me is a sign that he still is mentally unstable, and that she needs to divorce him. We argued about it for several minutes. I urged her to divorce him, as I have heard some extremely scary stories about people with bipolar disorder. They often refuse to take their medication, have extreme violent breakdowns, and often unalive themselves, sometimes taking the rest of their household with them.

Lauren assured me that Richard wasn't doing any of this. I told her she can either come to our gathering or stay with her abusive husband. She chose the latter. There was a noticeable void during the dinner, as none of my relatives were there. The kids asked where Uncle Richard was, and we again told them that he was sick and couldn't come to the dinner. My cousins are all saying that I am being extremely unfair and need to stay by Lauren's side, as aside from our very ill mother, I'm her only other immediate family member, and I need to stay by my sister's side. I told them that I am not abandoning her, and that she's free to come to me anytime her husband abuses her again. Now the rest of my family is no longer speaking to me.

Norm thinks I'm making the right decision, and so does his family. Mentally ill people are unpredictable, and there's no predicting what might trigger another breakdown, and lots of times they refuse help. I agree with this. It's a shame that nothing can be done to cure them of their disorders, but the bottom line is I don't feel safe with Richard in my house. Lauren keeps reminding me of all the good times we had as a family before all this happened, and Richard is managing his disorder well and I need to accept that she's not leaving him.

AITAH for wanting her to divorce Richard? I honestly can't stand the thought that my sister is choosing her abusive husband, and regardless of whether she stays with him, I don't feel comfortable with him around my family.",0,1736209907.0,AITAH,8,0.5,False

“This is bullshit!” Alan roared as he held an ice pack on Anna’s head. The two were sitting on the couch of their home, watching the news and reports of the damage that the Tyyrn had caused.

Most of the damage was being repaired by Paradox, but most of his forms were being used to suppress the Tear’s ability to open once again while Tesseract was racing back to work on a more mechanical solution.

“Dad.” Anna held her father’s hand still. “Either sit back and watch or let me hold my own ice pack.

Alan nodded and sat back. “So what was with that thing anyway?” 

“Remember the priest guy that escaped?” Anna shrugged, “I think that was him.” 

“So what, Tyyrn made him some sort of fake fire angel?” Alan watched the TV and looped the video of the creature. “Where is the depth to it’s form?” 

“Optical illusion.” Danny said as he walked in and sat on the floor next to his dad. “Paradox said it’s fully here, it just looks two dimensional. Probably a good way to throw off ranged attacks.” 

“Maybe we should ask the Revenants if they have any ideas.” Anna reiterated an idea passed around the night before.

“No!” Endara said as she walked past with Cassandra and Agatha, she was carrying a potted plant for them. “I don’t trust them just yet. Kyton is even wary of them.” 

“Then we ask Kyton for help.” Anna said, “They’re old enough they might have some leads.” 

“Rude.” Alan snorted, “You three doing your show at all?” He looked at his daughters.

Cassandra shrugged.

“Up to the battered braincase.” Agatha nodded to Anna.

“I mean, I’m up for it, but what about?” Anna sighed.

“We could interview the family.” Cxaltho said. “Let people hear their opinions too.” 

“Pass.” Danny shook his head.

“I mean the adults.” Cxaltho hissed.

Alan yawned, “I’d be willing.” 

Endara nodded, “That actually sounds fun, but where does this pot of....” She looked at the pot again, “...tomatoes go?”

“My room.” Agatha smiled, “Tomatoes are Nightshades and can be used for some spells.” 

“Not potions?” Alan asked.

“I was banned from using his potions lab, something about you and your kookaburra spirits upsetting the spirits there for generations. Also I almost blew it up when I didn’t listen so...” Agatha gave a wiley grin. “Nah, Master said my Wiccan connections can help my other spells if I work them just right. One of the conjunctions of the Arcane and Faith magic. Really interesting stuff, but I gotta listen to Mrs. Malati for those lessons.”

“Neat.” Alan nodded, “Tell you what. Get that someplace safe from your dog and goat and I’ll see who else wants to be on a Black Sheep Family interview block.” 

“I’ll work on questions!” Anna grabbed her ice pack and a small Hong Long formed to hold it on her head while she ran to her room. 

Alan was visibly confused for a moment.

“She wanted her father to care.” Endara sighed.

“No, I get that.” Alan said, “I’m more confused by how fast the little bugger appeared.”

Danny stood up and stretched, “I’m gonna go into the city then. Check on what I can do to help.” 

Alan smiled at his son and followed him to the van for a quick talk.

“You aren’t making poisons, are you?” Endara asked as she followed Agatha to her daughter’s room.

“No, Ma. Leaves from a nightshade are needed for some spells.” Agatha snorted.

“Ok.” Endara nodded.

“Can I get a free tomato?” Cxaltho asked.

“Sure, when they’re grown.” Agatha smirked, “Just make a bad joke, you’ll get one in no time.” 

Cxaltho blinked as Cassandra giggled and Endara rolled her eyes before chiding her daughter.

The nights of Dross City were often violent. Super Villains and their minions took it as their time to move around and act. As did normal criminals. There were heroes that acted in the night of course, but as of recent nights their presence did little to deter the forces of corruption and crime. Vigilantes however made the criminals and corrupt think twice about when and where to act.

One such vigilante sat perched on the edge of an apartment roof. It was an older building, still standing after nearly a century and a half of pain and misery coursing through it. The Wraith slid his gloves back on as he finished taking in the memories of the building, his prey was inside hidden in the basement with his victims.

The Wraith stood and stepped back into a shadow and the world twisted around him. The shadow realm of dross city was a dark reflection that he and a few others could enter to traverse and use. To him alone though, it was a second home, a realm where he could regenerate faster than normal and find safety from any enemy. 

He travelled down the shadowed halls of the apartment, sensing the living around him. Angry parents and children. Lovers shouting about betrayal. Even a man crying for his lost love. They all echoed around him as he slowly made his way to the basement, past the secured doors to where a room had three women bound to the walls, their sick tormentor standing over them as he held a needle above the closest. 

The Wraith paused, the monster hadn’t killed his victims yet and his mind locked up. He knew he had to avenge the fallen and innocent. But this screamed just as wrong and just as much in need of action as vengeance. He was frozen in what to do for a moment before he heard the voice of the young red-head thanking him for helping her.

The moment his foot left the shadow realm The Wraith was on a course to destroy the man before him. He grabbed him by the skull and slammed him into the wall made from half-decayed wooden pallets formed to shabby supports. The man went sailing into the heavy metal door and he stood and scrambled to leave. The Wraith went to follow but a voice stopped him.

“Help...” One of the victims was awake and still struggling, her arm was covered in needle marks and her skin seemed burned by black scar like tendrils at each mark. 

Again he paused, his prey was so close. He looked at the other two women, one was barely breathing and the last one was clearly in shock. He walked over and took off his gloves to get the vitals of the woman in shock. His mind was all at once assaulted with the horrid wrongs committed against her. For a moment his rage spiked higher than he wanted it too, then he felt hands grab his and saw the other woman holding tight to him. He took a breath and slashed every shackle free from the wall, then looked to the one woman who originally spoke.

“Can you stand?” The Wraith asked, his voice much like the shadows he used, dark and barely existent.  

“I’m high on raw Phreak and pissed.” She growled.

“Help her.” The Wraith nodded to the second woman.  

The woman that was high helped the other one while The Wraith seemed to wrap the last woman in shadows and began to carry her out. 

“Move!” The Wraith shouted as he made a portal appear and directed the women to it.  They were all transported to the shadows of a streetlight directly outside the building. A door slammed open as they exited the shadows.

“Who are you?!” The man shouted as he realized he had run right into his pursurer’s own exit.

The Wraith put the weakened woman down and stepped closer to his quarry. “Normally I am vengeance for the innocent slain by the monsters of this world.” The Wraith’s eyes glowed white with rage then dimmed, “But today I will be Justice for those wronged, that yet survive.” 

“Fuck!” The man lobbed a needle at The Wraith, it vanished into a shadow and the man’s eyes widened as he realized the needle was now deep in his chest. He went to pull it out but the grip of a dagger slammed into the plunger and injected him with the raw phreak. 

“Your sin is a good punishment, deviant.” The Wraith held out a hand and his dagger slunk along the shadows and returned to his hand. 

The man froze as his mind was locked into a deep hallucination. The Wraith admired the work from a distance, it wasn’t lethal and he could feel the man’s soul scream from whatever nightmare he was living. 

Lights then filled the street as multiple police vehicles began an approach from just further down the street. The Wraith stood as the police approached and jumped out of their vehicles. Some were pointing their weapons at him, others were rushing to aid the women. He watched those men and women carefully and waited until they were safely away from their tormentor. He ignored the orders to drop his weapons and looked back with a last glare as he fell into his own shadow and vanished.

He fell for what he wanted to be eternity, but he quickly hit his mattress in the apartment he shared with his siblings. He waited for a moment and let the shadows melt away from him leaving him in his normal clothes. He took the time to think on the events, normally the urge to outright kill was a nearly impossible one to resist. Tonight however, he had won. Not only had he won, he continually kept the urge at bay. And the fact that three victims had survived made his heart soar with a joy he hadn’t felt in ages.

“Okay Mr. Narkey Hole...” Raine said as she opened his bedroom door. “I heard you and the police scanner thing is going nuts. Lying low for the night?” 

Maddock took a moment to reassert his normal thoughts and just nodded.

“Well me and _deartháir beag_ are heading out.” She smiled and shook her head. “Staying and being Mr. Mopey or gonna join us?” 

Maddock sighed and turned over to face his wall.

“We’re goin’ ta the Bodhi Grill.” Raine’s voice carried her smirk.

Maddock flipped and spilled out of his bed.

“Comin’ you _mála gainimh_.” Maddock grabbed his new forest green hoodie as he stood up. The new jacket already had tears, patches and scorches from his exploration of the city during the daylight hours.

“Guys, we’re in America!” Elbee, their younger sibling shouted. 

“And we’re bloody Irish!” Raine countered, “Not Irish-American. Feckin’ Irish!” 

“And half the neighbors hate our volume setting.” Maddock sighed and nodded to the door.

The three then walked the way to their favorite restaurant, The Bohdi Grill, a small family owned Indian dinner. Raine and Elbee had introduced Maddock to it their first night reunited, and he had yet to miss a visit with them as a family. 

“So, what gives?” Raine asked as they sat and waited for their server.

Maddock looked at his sister, confused.

“Last I checked that blaggard was alive.” Raine hissed, “How?” 

“I don’t know.” Maddock shook his head. “I just heard that little girl’s voice thankin’ me. It felt right to do it after that.” 

“The lil’ red-head Quain?” Raine snorted. “You and red-heads.” She laughed.

“What’s that supposed to mean?” Maddock snapped quietly. “We’re not amongst the living if you recall.” 

“And?” Elbee asked, “I still have to deal with monthly crushes on celebrity hotties.” Elbee groaned, “I would greatly appreciate a decade without that.” 

Raine grinned, “So which of the Quaine cuties are you crushing on? The red-head, marked or the girls with the snake tail?” 

Elbee glared at his sister. “None of them!” He shuddered. “I may be perpetually thirteen, but I am still nearly a millennium old.

“So Mama Quain the Amazon.” Raine nodded knowingly, “She’s on my list too.” 

Elbee turned red for a brief moment. Then shook his head, “No! Stop this, this is stupid.” 

“I don’t know...” Karma, the daughter of the owner, smiled. She had come to find the O’Donnelly family as good friends in their own right. “Papa said you get the same discount as always. I’m assuming you still want me to do full pay.”  She laughed and her fire-red hair bounced like flames against her dark skin.

Maddock nodded, “Usuals?” He looked around at his siblings.

“I’d like duck for chicken tonight.” Raine said, “If we can.” 

Karma jotted the order down. “Please, don’t challenge papa or anything.” She laughed.

“I want the vegetable medley mix.” Elbee nodded. “The Challenge mix.” 

“Elbee, you’ve tried four times now.” Karama smiled, like a parent entertaining a child.  

“Usual for me.” Maddock sighed, “Maybe a coffee on the side.” 

“Do you ever actually sleep?” Karma sighed, “Maddock, I will get you decaf.” 

Maddock stared at her, “I want coffee. With that cinnamon stick your mom always adds.” 

Karma sighed and shook her head. “Raine if he implodes please tell him I told him so.” 

Raine laughed, “If he implodes he’ll take us all with him.”

“What have I done to deserve this? I’m tired, I want coffee and I get anger and insults?” Maddock shook his head.

“You’re right.” Karama nodded, “I’m just worried. I don’t see you without coffee very often.” 

“I like it.” Maddock sighed, “Not as good as the stuff from Turkey...” He was interrupted by a smack of his menu over his head from his sister.

“And it never will be. We’re in America as Elbee likes to remind us.” Raine smirked.

“Feckin’ America.” Elbee added with his own accent slightly flaring. 

“Feckin’ right.” Raine confirmed and hugged her brother.

“All right. But don’t drink too much.” Karma smiled. 

Maddock nodded. “I won’t.” 

“Be out in a bit.” Karma smiled at Raine. “You’ll go quakers for the duck.” 

Raine laughed and nodded.

Maddock smiled and shook his head with a smile as Karma left.

“God, you need to ask her out already.” Raine said with a shake of her head.

“I’m a dangerous, likely psychotic, vigilante.” Maddock sighed 

“Likely my arse.” Raine countered, “Doesn’t mean we can’t be happy.” 

“I mean it kinda does if we don’t want to hurt others.” Elbee sighed as he took some toothpicks and began to make a log cabin from the plastic pieces.

“That’s a larder full of bull shite.” Raine shook her head. “We got just as much right to be happy. We just gotta fight for it a bit more.” 

Maddock sighed and looked towards the kitchen. He would be lying if he denied he had been intrigued by the fire-haired woman, or that learning about her hadn’t sparked a desire for closeness. It was those same sparks that concerned him, Revenants were beings of extremes, when their curse was triggered they became feral or worse and he wouldn’t want to put Karma in that kind of danger. He closed his eyes and turned his head towards the large windows that faced the street. He opened his eyes and if his heart were still beating it would have stopped in shock and fear.

There, floating before his face, just a few feet away, was a young girl no older than six or seven. She had long dark hair and a cute pastel dress with ribbons. Her eyes seemed to be pools of water with rain dropping in them. She had a warm and inviting smile on her face with her arms held out. He felt a brief hug at his legs and in his head he heard 

«Alone we will drown in life's undercurrent, reach out to others, before they are robbed of you and you of them.» It was the crisp and clear voice of a small child.

He bolted up and looked around in shock and the girl was gone. Then he noticed his sister and brother looking at him. He looked around and sat back down.

“Did you see her?” Maddock asked.

Elbee looked at the window and shook his head.

“Was it the red-head in your mind?” Raine snickered.

“It was a child. Eyes like reflectin’ pools.” Maddock shook his head and saw Karma approaching with drinks. “Change of plans darlin’. Make mine a beer.” 

Karma laughed and turned around to switch the drinks.

“You okay, deartháir?” Raine asked, noticing her brother’s quick change of drinks. 

“Jesus, Joseph, and Mary; I hope so.” Maddock sighed. “I don’t know if I saw a ghost or a daemon or what.” 

“Daemon.” Elbee chuckled nervously, “Please don’t joke. They tend to avoid Dross and I prefer it that way. No Nephilim to fight them.” 

“Not that the winged bastards do much. Look pretty and throw a light show at the deadly bastards.” Raine huffed. “Last I heard a New Yorker did manage to take down a Daemon Lord trying to manifest. Broke the poor bastard.” 

Maddock sighed and leaned back as Karma put their drinks on the table. “You guys look worried.”

“I’m just losing what precious little of my mind I still have.” Maddock gave a nervous smile.

“Too much caffeine.” Karma said. “Try some herbal teas, they do just as much with less caffeination.” 

“I’ll keep that in mind.” Maddock smiled and took a sip of his beer. In his opinion the beer was weak and tasteless, a trait he assigned to most American beers. But it was what the place had.

“Can I join you in a bit. My meal is coming up.” Karma smiled. 

“More the merrier.” Maddock smiled and raised his beer in a toast.

Karma smiled and went back to the kitchen.

“Okay, Raine’s right.” Elbee nodded.

“See.” Raine tripped her own beer back and looked at the bottle in a combination of shock and insult. “Did this get worse since last time?” 

“See why I get the coffee?” Maddock winced, “And what’s she right about?” 

“Ask. Her. Out.” Elbee leaned over from his seat and grabbed his brother’s collar.

The meal passed for a bit as they ate and Karma joined them a few moments later. She smiled and sat politely with the family she considered friends. The meal then slowly came to an end as the four sat and began to chat. Until Elbee noticed a building across the street.

“Is that a new Arcade?” Elbee asked.

“Yup.” Karma nodded. “Smaller branch of the Nostrum Arcade.” 

“Feckin’ yes...” Elbee let his accent slip slightly. “Can I go check it out?” 

“I’ll go with.” Raine winked at Maddock.  “That way when they yell at you I can at least talk them down from callin’ the cops.” 

“Don’t hack the games.” Karma warned.

“I don’t.” Elbee grinned, “I go for the prize machines.” 

“See, trouble in far too small a package.” Maddock smiled.

“I don’t know. He’s like a smaller version of you, just louder.” Karma laughed.

“Better than our dad.” Elbee coughed and ran off.

“Little shite.” Raine quickly ran off.

“Sorry.” Maddock sighed, “Elbee still can’t move past our _athair_ bein’ the right blaggard he is.” 

“It’s all right.” Karma smiled, “So how have you been? It’s been a week. You usually come in twice a week.” 

Maddock paused. 

“You lost track of time doing the whole exploring the city thing, didn’t you?” Karma chuckled.

Maddock nodded. “Lots on my mind.” 

“Thought you had precious little left?” Karma smirked.

Maddock turned to her, “Lookit you, catchin’ me in my shite.” 

“It’s fun.” Karma admitted, “You’re usually more cagey about it all.” 

Maddock leaned forward, “Honestly darlin’ I am honestly scared for my sanity in this city. There’s just so much pain and I can’t do feck all to help.” 

Karma smiled, “Help where you can...” She put her hand on his and squeezed it quickly. “... that’s all anyone can do. Even the heroes.” 

Maddock nodded and took a final swig of his drink. “New movie comin’ out about the first Fawl Explorers. Wanna go see it?” 

Karma smirked, “So who finally pushed you to asking?” 

“Oh they both did, but the feckin’ ghost girl I saw earlier had me thinkin’ I don’t want two more visitin’ me like I’m the Scrooge of datin’.” 

Karma laughed, “Ghost girl, huh?” 

“Swear to God.” Maddock nodded, “See, I’m losin’ my mind.” 

“Well then, I’ll help keep track of it when we see the movie.” Karma smiled.

Maddock paused. “Feckin’ hell.” 

“Are you really surprised?” Karma crossed her arms.

“More than a lil’.” Maddock nodded.

Karma shook her head. “You need to work on that confidence.” 

Maddock chuckled. “I had that once.” 

“Well then, we can get you there again.” Karma stood up. “You let me know when and what theatre.” 

Maddock nodded and watched her go to the back. Then he looked back to the windows again to see his siblings pressing their face against the windows with a handwritten note Raine was pressing against the window that read. “TOLD YOU!” Maddock shook his head and laughed as he took his card up to pay for the meal and casually flipped his siblings off.

1hvegl5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hvegl5/should_i_reach_out/,Should I reach out?,"Me (19M) and my ex (17F) broke up a little over two months ago after nearly 1 year relationship. The reason is still a bit unclear to me, but just to give it some context.

We both felt the passion hadn’t been the same the past weeks, although we still cared deeply for each other. I suggested we took a 2 week break, she agreed. The following day she breaks up with me. Reason: “Two weeks is not going to change how I feel” and also that she could not stop having troubling thought about the fact that I made out with another 3 weeks into our relationship (very stupid mistake I know but FYI I was very supportive towards her afterwards and clear that if she wanted to communicate about it I was always there for her because I loved her more than anything else). She also said she didn’t recognize the person I was now compared to the person I was when we met and fell for each other hard. This was mainly due to some mental troubles I have been having but I have been working on it, got my diagnosis and can genuinely say I am a better person now than 2 months ago and steadily improving.

The breakup however sent me into a spiral. I always thought that this was just us exiting the honeymoon phase and now the real stuff begins. Falling in love is easy and can happen anybody, staying in love is an effort (IMO).
The following days we met at a party and spoke. She started crying hysterically because she felt so bad about it but insisted it was the right decision. I tried to tell her my thoughts and that I would be willing to try to make us work, but in the end I just left when she told me that I was too nice in the relationship. I needed to show some self-respect at least. And mind you I was not a people-pleaser towards her who did anything and everything. Yes I was very generous with my time and money but there were times we disagreed and I stood my ground even though she hates my guts for it.

The following week she sleeps with another guy, and for context she made us both swear that we would not touch another partner in the following 4 weeks out of respect for each other. I held my part of the deal, she didn’t. I’m not angry with her about it, cause I do not like to hold grudges. You cannot get stuck up on shit like that or you’ll just end up destroying yourself. I think I still love her.

Sorry for that essay. Now the question is in the title: Should I reach out to her in the upcoming months? I have been close to doing it a couple times by writing her letters and stuff but I never sent anything because I reminded myself that she broke her own promise and she told me I was too nice. And as the stubborn person I am I kind of think that I should not let myself submit to her, due to those reasons. She doesn’t deserve it. On the other hand she was my best friend, and part of me just thinks she was a bit immature and I do miss her (more as a friend but maybe something more as well I don’t really know) and her family. FYI her mother has reached out since, wanting to grab coffee.

What do you guys think? Thank you in advance!

edit: Just to give more context. When we broke up she still wanted to hang out and spend time together as friends but I said never in my life and I have been very stubborn with having NC with her, if that makes any difference.

TLDR: My first love broke up with me 4 months ago and I have had NC since. I have improved myself a lot but still miss her, both as a friend possibly as a partner. Should I reach out and break NC?",1,1736209434.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1hvegih,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1hvegih/aita_i_ended_things_with_my_boyfriend_whos_in/,AITA? I ended things with my “boyfriend” who’s in sober living to pursue seeing women,"alright, this is going to be a complex story. i (21f) broke up with my boyfriend (22m) who is currently living in a sober house for an indefinite amount of time, and is facing charges for drug distribution, but he hasn’t even gone to trial yet. Back in May of 2024, he got caught with selling drugs at our college. was kicked out, went to rehab, and has been living in a sober house since June. I broke up with him over the summer because the relationship was just not working for me anymore, and we couldn’t even see each other. Then, in September, we reconnected and both confessed we missed each other. we began seeing each other again in October, I would drive up to the sober house and hang out with him for the day, and we’d have sex in the car. I probably saw him about 4-5 times before I went home for my winter break (i’m in college and go to school out of state. his sober house happened to be in the same state as my college). Now, during this time, we never talked about being back together, or being “boyfriend and girlfriend”, and I never asked him about it, he would just refer to me as his girlfriend to everyone. We would also say I love you. Over the summer before I broke up with him, I told him that I wanted to pursue women, and I’ve had that attraction that simply won’t go away. Now, flash forward to this past week, I meet a woman I’m interested in at a NYE party. We chat and flirt a bit, nothing over the top. I had been thinking about our interaction for days after, so I decided to come clean to my “boyfriend”. I told him I met a girl at a party who  I felt attracted to, and that I’d ask her to get coffee with me. After confessing this he got super upset, called me, and began telling me that I don’t love him because I did that, and if I actually did love him, I wouldn’t have even been attracted to the girl at all. He then demanded that I show him the messages between her and I, which I refused. I just read them out to him honestly. After more back and forth, he said “so is this it?” and I said “I guess so?” and he then went off on me saying “fuck you! fuck you!” and I finally snapped on him and said that this isn’t a real relationship and it can’t be. I don’t know how long he’ll be living in the sober house and I don’t know how long his trial will take AND THEN he’ll face probation!!!! and he was expecting me to wait for him that entire time?!?!? we soon ended the call with him saying “well i hope it was worth it. enjoy you’re fucking coffee date”

I know this story is all over the place and i’m more than happy to clear details up but. am i wrong for ending the relationship because i want to explore my sexuality with women?!?!? the way we ended things definitely wasn’t what i wanted, but i think he really showed his true colors, so i guess it was a blessing in disguise.

December 30 - January 3,"https://preview.redd.it/n8kicv3jtgbe1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d357c33364d279d22d63cb482412fee6952b5c9f

This will be a comprehensive review of the Valiant Lady sailing from December 30 - January 3. I sailed as a Solo Rockstar in a Cheeky Corner Suite - Even Bigger Terrace.

**TLDR**: Get a travel agent, travel insurance, don't feel pressured to do everything on shorter sailings, drink more wine

\------

***Travel***: If you have ANY doubt in your mind whether or not you should get a travel agent, GET A TRAVEL AGENT. Also, BUY TRAVEL INSURANCE.

As I was on the plane to Atlanta, my flight to Miami is CANCELLED. I booked this cruise in October of ***2023.*** Ain't no way in hell I'm going to give up that easily. My TA gave me tips on how to submit claims to insurance, keeping receipts, screenshots, etc. Anywho I had to fly into Fort Lauderdale but I made it.

***Embarkation***: I sailed by myself as a Rockstar. My embarkation time was 1:30 pm ET. I was assigned to NJ as my Rockstar agent. She was super responsive and kind. No issues here with embarkation.

I asked the port people to take my suitcase to my room. My sailing was full. I wanted to go to Richard's Rooftop as soon as I got on but realized I didn't have my luggage. At around 5:30 pm ET I asked my Rockstar agent if they could bring it aboard.

They had about 6,000 pieces of luggage to move so it makes sense it took a little while longer. Next time, I'm packing a carry on only and taking it with me personally.

***Ship Layout & Other Stuff***: This was my first time aboard VV so it took me a little while to get accustomed to things. I was closest to the Aft elevators. If you don't mind walking from one end of the ship to the other, these work great.

But if you're not so keen on walking and want to be closer to the activities, Midship or Foward is your best bet.

I personally didn't mind all of the walking.

One thing that really impressed me was how ***clean*** the ship was. Guess that's easier when you don't have bad ass kids running around.

Someone was always cleaning something.

Also VV had a lot of unique spaces. I'm not sure the best way to describe them but the lounge areas, staircases, and other places were pleasing to look at.

***Staff Interactions***: I did not have any negative interactions with staff. My housekeepers Sam and Kris were especially hospitable. All the staff genuinely looked happy to be there. I made a list of names in my phone and included them in my staff reviews.

NJ sent out daily messages and check-ins through the app. I felt very catered to.

***Richard's Rooftop***: Richard's Rooftop is for Rockstars only. It has hot tubs, food/drink, daily happy hour, and lounge areas. Since I'm relaxed type cruiser, I really enjoyed it. There's a Rockstar area in Bimini also.

***Bimini Beach Club***: I sailed Dec going into Jan and figured the water would be cold. Personally the ocean was too cold for me. It was a high of 76 that day. Granted, I still had fun but would have liked to spend more time in the ocean.

I also did a Paint by the Beach excusion which wasn't worth the money. The rum punch was good, though. Originally, the paintings were supposed to be 8 x 10 but were reduced to 5 x 7 last minute. They DID give the option for a refund. One young woman left but I stayed. I think a better excursion might have been snorkeling, swimming with the sharks, or just hanging out at Bimini.

You can also rent golf carts.

This wasn't an issue for me because I left with plenty of time to spare but these all aboard times are NO JOKE.

I think the Bimini all-aboard time was 6:30 PM. That ship was moving by 6:41. So don't eff around and find out!

***Key West***: This was my first time in Key West. Originally I signed up for the walking tour but too many Redditors suggesting canceling because Key West is very walkable. I did end up canceling that excursion and I'm glad I did.

Key West was very walkable. I also had a pedicure mid-day because I had some Sailor Loot to burn so the excursion would have clashed with that.

I stopped by a Turkish coffee shop and was visited by a friend, lol. I didn't know Florida had wild chickens.

The next time I go here I want to do the parasailing. I haven't been parasailing in years.

***Shows***: I only went to one show: Duel Reality. I won't give away what happens but I strongly recommend watching this show. It is a ton of fun. Next sailing I will go to more shows. I knew I wouldn't have a chance to do everything in one sailing.

***Parties***: I skipped the Sail Away and PJ Party. I think I was just tired AF. Next time I will go. But the New Years and Scarlet Night parties were fun. I did not go to the We Fancy. I'm generally an early riser and have trouble staying up past 10pm. Next time, I will make it a point to do naps.

Side note for Scarlet Night: a lot of us danced in the pool. So if that's something you want to do, make sure you wear something that you don't mind getting wet. I had to go back to my room and change LOL. Some people went into the pool fully clothed!

Also the cast will splash water at you during their performance. So if you're standing close to the pool, keep that in mind, too.

***Food:*** I did not go to the Test Kitchen nor Gunbae. I did not realize there were no to-go plates. Food cannot leave the restaurant. I threw away a decent amount of food on the Razzle Dazzle Brunch. But now I know for next time.

* Razzle Dazzle (Dinner)
   * Favorite restaurant
   * Steak was delicious. Better than the Wake's
   * Those chicken wings were actually fire. Please try those.
   * Great service.
* The Wake (Brunch)
   * I didn't care for how they scrambled their eggs.
   * Love the views.
   * Fantastic service.
* Pink Agave
   * I went here on New Years Eve. The server told me they typically do 350 / night but since it was NYE, they had to do about 500. Because of this, my food arrived Q U I C K L Y.
   * I had the guacamole, empanadas, and another appetizer.
   * Overall enjoyed it here.
   * I will try their steak next time.
* Razzle Dazzle (Brunch)
   * The bacon is good.
   * Their fried chicken sandwich with fries were fantastic. I ended up throwing a little bit of this away because I didn't realize food couldn't leave the restaurant :-(
* The Wake (Dinner)
   * This was actually my least favorite restaurant. This might be because I eat steak often at fine dining restaurants. The steak was dry and I noticed service lagged here versus the other restaurants. It wasn't a BAD experience by any means but in terms of quality, it was the worst one.
   * Their clam chowder is actually on fire. They pour it. It's actually super good.
   * The next time I come, I won't be ordering a steak. A lot of folks said their bread was ***\*chef's kiss\**** but I found it so-so.
* Extra Virgin
   * Took me a while to find it but the food was great.
   * I ate dinner by myself at all of the restaurants so I mostly stuck to appetizers. I had their Calamari and one other dish I can't remember.
   * The Bomboloni was delicious.

***Alcohol***: I had a $300 bar tab and left with about $142 unused. Oops. The next time I will be drinking a lot of wine and Moet. A lot of the sugary drinks had too low alcohol content and made my gut blow up like an actual balloon. But since wine tends to be more expensive, I'll definitely need more bar tab.

And I'm OK with that :)

***Disembarkation***: Rockstars have a separate line. This was pretty smooth. You can leave your luggage out the night before if you want the port people to pick them up. I just carried it off.

***Lessons Learned***: Next time I'm traveling with a carry-on only. This isn't feasible for some folks and that's fine. But for the foreseeable future, I can only do shorter 4-5 day sailings. I'm a relaxed type cruiser who likes enjoying the sun, ocean, and food.

That sort of thing will make your clothes fit tighter HA. Definitely prioritizing comfort over cuteness.

I am flying into Fort Lauderdale. It seems to be less congested with more options. Due to the snowstorm, I actually ended up leaving from Fort Lauderdale, too. I haven't actually flown in or out of the Miami airport.

If you want to stay up later to go to the parties, you need to take at least one nap during the day. I really messed up my sleep schedule by not taking naps.

***Next Time:*** My next sailing is July 2026 as a solo Rockstar. I need to make more money to fund this new habit. HA.",8,1736209210.0,VirginVoyages,0,1.0,False

1hvearf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1hvearf/37m_can_metoprolol_cause_hypertension/,37M Can Metoprolol cause hypertension,"So recently I've come to the conclusion that Metoprolol Succinate causes me to have extreme hypertensive episodes, which seem to trigger panic attacks (the symptoms of extreme hypertension make me panicky). Before a few months ago I had been on a low dose (12.5mg) for years due to a single extended bout of afib. Recently I have been having progressively worsening anxiety/panic symptoms over the last 6 months or so.

A few months back I had a hypertensive episode that landed me in the ER with a BP > 200/120 and HR over 150 for a few hours. I learned during this episode that beta blockers an stimulants can be a bad mix, I had taken a stimulant at the time.

Since then I have of course not taken any stimulants of course (not even coffee), but I have noticed a pattern where when I attempt to start taking metoprolol again, I become very prone to really severe panic attacks. They generally start the same way, with a dizzy/lightheaded/tingling sensation everywhere. After it happened a few times I started checking my BP and it usually is very high when this happens. My heart rate is usually not that high initially, in the 80s most of the time before climbing as the panic takes over. I've gone to the ER twice over these episodes. In between my BP seems to be largely normal although not super well controlled by the metoprolol.

My cardiologist says that Metoprolol generally should help the symptoms of anxiety by reducing HR and BP and that this reaction really can't be from the Metoprolol, but my empirical experiences really disagree with this. I actually tried \*increasing\* my metoprolol dose and had a much worse episode around 8 hours later. I will be meeting with my cardiologist again soon to discuss, and would like to switch to a calcium channel blocker to see if I do better with that.

Has anyone here seen this type of reaction \*without\* stimulants? Is anyone aware of any studies around this kind of reaction?",1,1736208992.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1hveaih,https://www.reddit.com/r/ershow/comments/1hveaih/the_tarantino_episode/,The Tarantino episode,"While rewatching S1 Ep 24, before the credits came up, I thought to myself ""this episode is really great already"". There were some great bits of humour like Susan getting Chloe to stop screaming so she could listen for her keys, or Carter falling off the chair, then Susan spilling Carter's coffee all over herself.

Then the credits rolled and I realised that this was Tarantino's episode. It's wild that they got him to direct an episode by season 1 of a new show, right as his fame was taking off properly.

There were some great Tarantino moments like close-ups of the bone saw and other bits of gore, plus the iconic scene of Susan and Carol on the rooftop.

1hve9yu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hve9yu,Twice “Print succeeded” but print stopped halfway with weird spots in PLA?,"Hi I in the last week I got a “print succeeded” message with two of my prints but both failed halfway! Both were with bambu PLA orange and I am wondering if the PLA is the problem. Earlier I found a strange spot in the PLA which I did cut off. After that I printed the coffee clip (laying loose on the print bed for the picture) which failed halfway. When printed again it printed fine (also in same bambu PLA orange). Then I printed a enfit feeding tube wrench (the long thin things on the print bed), which I have printed successfully many times in the past week, and this one also failed halfway. There seems to be some weird stringing or thin strands that normally do not happen. The machine however seems to keep going but not extruding anything after that. Shouldn’t it sensor that the extrusion is going wrong? 

When I changed the orange filament after this failed print I found another weird spot. So maybe this was a cause in both failed prints? This would mean that in about 500grams of filament there could have been 3 spots which caused failures! They look like they have something else imbedded in the filament, like a metal fragment. I have added multiple fotos of both weird spots and the failed prints. 

Does anybody know what this is? Is this a filament problem or user error? And if it is the filament how do I go about this? Does this happen often? Bambu also forgot one filament in my order and although I am very happy with the printer, this is annoying. I wouldn’t mind it if the printer told me to fix a filament issue but this is just wasting PLA. Also the filament seems to be quite thick around the spots. Way outside of the specs.

This was my first relationship. A friend recommended to post it on here to gain perspective from you guys on reddit.

I first moved from California to DC for a new job in 2023. I met her on Coffee Meets Bagel. We met on the first date. Clicked really well. Asked her if she wanted to be official on the 3rd date and she said yes. I really missed home at that time I thought I would be moving back home after maybe 2-3 years here. I didn't want hurt her so I tried breaking up with her during the 4th date, but I felt terrible and I really liked her and missed her. So the following day I apologized to her and asked her if she wanted to do short-term and told her how much I missed California. She said yes, but I felt guilty for doing that to her.

Over the next couple months the relationship was going great. I fell in love with her and thought about settling with her in DC and didn't think about California at all. I changed my mind and wanted to do long term with her. During the beginning and middle of 2024 she brought up if we could break up. I didn't want to and asked her for more time and a chance to show her we can make this work. She would agree and gave me a chance. Throughout the year she lost her intimacy for me. Around that time I would say ""I love you"" but she would never say that back. But if I say ""I miss you"" then she would say that back.

At first I thought things were going great the past couple of months. I asked her if she was happy and she said yes at those times. However, she called me last week and wanted to break up. Caught me off guard. I met up with her in-person last Saturday to give her stuff back. She told me the reasons why she broke up with me:

* She feels like the relationship is too comfortable and complacent (stagnating)
* We don't challenge each other enough for personal growth
* Told me she hasn't loved me back at all yet she still treasures our memories and has no regrets
* We had some rough patches, but we got through them this past year. Some of my words would trigger her and I would have to apologize alot...
* She doesn't like how my work (engineering) is lax how I barely do any work and have lots of free time
* She pointed it out she wanted somebody who can hustle and have an impact on society like a doctor (helping people)
* She wakes up super early in the morning like 6-7am and waits for me to wake up 10am to 11am
* She said we have different values and life goals.
* She's not really an intimate person but I was willing to not be intimate with her.
* She doesn't like how I drink soda and play video games
* Our dates have been just the 2 of us. We haven't really found a group to hang with and she felt stuck in this relationship.
* I haven't been the best planner. We were running out of stuff to do. I couldn't find new places to explore and eat. She probably planned 75% of the dates.
* She was telling me this was all in the back of her mind accumulating up to this point.

I told her I wanted to fix these issues together step-by-step and that I could change, but she told me she never really loved me and doesn't see a future with me. During the breakup she was crying alot not for the end of the relationship, but she felt guilty because she cared alot about me. And I cared alot about her. She said she wanted to be friends still with me but after giving each other space... 

I'm really sad right now. I regret so much of what I said to her. I wish I could just go back in time and just say the right stuff so she wouldn't leave me. I'm just grieving just looking at our photos together and our old texts right now.

There is also a special watercolor-inspired drink that Rustbelt will be creating for us. 

We decided to go with watercolor card painting because of Valentine's Day! But we intend to do more events in the future, including Flower Arranging for mother's day, gift decorating workshops for Christmas, and other craft events throughout the year that are just fun to do (candle and soap making, knitting, etc.). This event is 13+, so if you have teens, you can bring them along! Unfortunately, the painting style doesn't mesh too well with the babies.   

There are two sessions on Saturday, February 01, 2025. You can access the tickets below:

Children, Cruel Reflections, Siouxsie Sioux, This Cold Night, etc. but I'm looking for more goth specific songs to add to it. only thing is that it just can't be too loud and abrasive (unfortunate or I would be playing dance-y goth club music) it makes my manager uncomfortable 😭

I don’t know anything about the potato diet other than you’re supposed to eat potatoes. How many potatoes a day should I eat? I know it’s different for each but if I’m a man, who’s kind of stocky and 511 where should I stop? I don’t think I’ve gone over 15 potatoes yet.

Can I eat any kind of potato? 

Also, I did have a few cheat moments already  because I always buy a chocolate when I go to the store, but I have noticed over the past week that’s my sugar cravings have gone down. Tomorrow is my birthday and I got a bunch of sweets and I didn’t even eat the cookies, but I did have some chocolates, but gave over half of them away. That seems interesting.

I still do oat milk in my coffee and I refuse to quit that. How bad will that affect me? 

I also go on walks every day, I forgot to mention I’m 45 well 46 tomorrow. 

Basically, I like that I am able to satisfy myself by eating potatoes. I do put some brown mustard on my potatoes and I had a bit of kimchi on my potatoes. But what do I need to do to really lose weight. I don’t even know if I’ve lost any yet, but I still look flabby and my gut hangs over so I’m guessing that just takes time but I’m hoping to get some answers and support or at least a point in the right direction for good info on the diet

Thanks for reading through the rainbow

The potential in e-commerce is massive, and it's one of the most exciting opportunities in today's business landscape. Whether you're looking to create a side hustle or build a full-fledged online empire, the e-commerce world offers unparalleled possibilities. Here's why:

# 1. Global Reach

One of the biggest advantages of e-commerce is the ability to reach customers all over the world. Your store isn’t limited by geography, meaning you can access markets and customers that were previously out of reach. With the right strategies, you could be selling to anyone, anywhere.

# 2. Low Startup Costs

Unlike traditional brick-and-mortar businesses, starting an e-commerce store doesn't require a huge upfront investment. With platforms like Shopify, WooCommerce, or Etsy, you can start selling products with minimal financial commitment. You don't need to rent physical space or worry about utilities and overheads.

# 3. Flexibility and Freedom

Running an e-commerce business offers you the freedom to work from anywhere, whether that's from the comfort of your home, a coffee shop, or while traveling the world. All you need is an internet connection, and you're set to run your business. It’s the ultimate form of remote work.

# 4. Scalability

As your business grows, so does your opportunity for expansion. The beauty of e-commerce is that you can scale it up relatively easily. Whether you add new products, expand your marketing efforts, or tap into new markets, the opportunities are endless. Plus, automation tools make it easier to manage a growing business.

# 5. Personal Growth and Learning

Running an e-commerce store is an incredible learning experience. From mastering digital marketing to understanding customer behavior, inventory management, and financial planning, you'll develop valuable skills that extend far beyond just selling products. It's a crash course in entrepreneurship!

# 6. Increased Consumer Spending

Online shopping continues to grow at an exponential rate. With more people turning to the internet for their shopping needs, the potential to tap into this market has never been greater. The rise of mobile shopping and social media commerce further fuels the growth of e-commerce.

# 7. Wide Variety of Business Models

E-commerce isn’t just about selling products. Whether you're dropshipping, creating handmade goods, offering digital products, or running a subscription-based service, there are endless ways to monetize your business. The possibilities are vast, and you can find the model that works best for you.

# 8. Building Your Own Brand

E-commerce gives you the chance to build your own brand. Unlike working for someone else, you have full control over your brand identity, customer experience, and product offerings. You can create something truly unique and resonate with your audience in a way that traditional businesses often can't.

# 9. Low Risk, High Reward

With its low startup costs and the ability to test ideas quickly (thanks to digital tools), e-commerce allows you to experiment without putting all your resources on the line. If something doesn’t work, you can pivot easily without huge financial consequences.",0,1736207792.0,EcommerseTips,0,0.5,False

I was worried he might have fin rot because the ends of his fins are going missing.

Today was the second day of dosing his water (I followed the instructions for dosage and even bought an eyedropper so that I could give a precise dose) and after a few hours he was gasping for air at the surface, dropping to the bottom of the bowl and lying completely sideways at the bottom, and then darting up to the surface to gasp for air again.

I panicked and filled up a coffee cup with tap water that was slightly warmer than the water in his bowl and dropped him in that. He has since stopped gasping for air and is just relaxing in the cup.

I don't know what to do as I'm new to this and completely out of ideas. I don't know if the melafix and pimafix caused him to gasp for air or if it's some other issue. I don't know what else I can use to treat him. Any help would be appreciated.

This was my first relationship. A friend recommended to post it on here to gain perspective from you guys on reddit.  
  
I first moved from California to DC for a new job in 2023. I met her on Coffee Meets Bagel. We met on the first date. Clicked really well. Asked her if she wanted to be official on the 3rd date and she said yes. I really missed home at that time I thought I would be moving back home after maybe 2-3 years here. I didn't want hurt her so I tried breaking up with her during the 4th date, but I felt terrible and I really liked her and missed her. So the following day I apologized to her and asked her if she wanted to do short-term and told her how much I missed California. She said yes, but I felt guilty for doing that to her.

Over the next couple months the relationship was going great. I fell in love with her and thought about settling with her in DC and didn't think about California at all. I changed my mind and wanted to do long term with her. During the beginning and middle of 2024 she brought up if we could break up. I didn't want to and asked her for more time and a chance to show her we can make this work. She would agree and gave me a chance. Throughout the year she lost her intimacy for me. Around that time I would say ""I love you"" but she would never say that back. But if I say ""I miss you"" then she would say that back.

At first I thought things were going great the past couple of months. I asked her if she was happy and she said yes at those times. However, she called me last week and wanted to break up. Caught me off guard.  I met up with her in-person last Saturday to give her stuff back. She told me the reasons why she broke up with me:

* She feels like the relationship is too comfortable and complacent (stagnating)
* We don't challenge each other enough for personal growth
* Told me she hasn't loved me back at all yet she still treasures our memories and has no regrets
* We had some rough patches, but we got through them this past year. Some of my words would trigger her and I would have to apologize alot...
* She doesn't like how my work (engineering) is lax how I barely do any work and have lots of free time
* She pointed it out she wanted somebody who can hustle and have an impact on society like a doctor (helping people)
* She wakes up super early in the morning like 6-7am and waits for me to wake up 10am to 11am
* She said we have different values and life goals.
* She's not really an intimate person but I was willing to not be intimate with her.
* She doesn't like how I drink soda and play video games
* Our dates have been just the 2 of us. We haven't really found a group to hang with and she felt stuck in this relationship.
* I haven't been the best planner. We were running out of stuff to do. I couldn't find new places to explore and eat. She probably planned 75% of the dates.
* She was telling me this was all in the back of her mind accumulating up to this point.

I told her I wanted to fix these issues together step-by-step and that I could change, but she told me she never really loved me and doesn't see a future with me. During the breakup she was crying alot not for the end of the relationship, but she felt guilty because she cared alot about me. And I cared alot about her. She said she wanted to be friends still with me but after giving each other space...

I'm really sad right now. I regret so much of what I said to her. I wish I could just go back in time and just say the right stuff so she wouldn't leave me. I'm just grieving just looking at our photos together and our old texts right now.",1,1736207429.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

Today I woke up with the same burning chest pain, still regurgitating some stuff (burping feels like acid reflux again). But tonight i’m feeling a little better. Just still burping up which means i’m thinking it’s GERD with a Stomach Ulcer I had last Wednesday?

I was extremely uncomfortable with this, but I figured I didn't have much of a choice, especially since by that point it would have been hard to plan something else. I told my dad I didn't want to spend Christmas Eve at this woman's house, since I hardly know her, but I guess maybe I wasn't clear enough. My sister (24f) was also extremely uncomfortable with this. My dad gave us the option not to go, but I still wanted to spend Christmas Eve with him. So my mom, sister, and I went out on Christmas Eve, and then my sister and I went to get our presents from my dad. We left immediately after, and my dad apparently felt we -especially my sister- were quite rude. So now, my sister and my dad were in disagreement about the whole situation. I had a good Christmas Day with my mom and siblings. But two days later, my sister gets a text from my dad's girlfriend-he had given her my sister's phone number without her permission- inviting her to go out for coffee. My sister was very angry and posted an ad on Craigslist with the girlfriend's phone number saying she was ""looking for a boyfriend."" My dad was furious, but my sister blocked his number, so he called me, asking me to tell my sister to take the ad down. My dad's girlfriend then sent my sister a series of texts that were, in my opinion, extremely inappropriate and genuinely insane. She said, among other things, that she ""would advise \[my sister\] to get a new personality\]"" and that my sister would be kicked off my dad's health insurance and phone plan. She then had the audacity to call my mom, which infuriated all of us. My sister screenshotted the texts and posted them on LinkedIn, tagging my dad and his girlfriend in the post. She also made an Instagram post about it. My sister is now also in disagreement with our two brothers (23m and 20m), because my dad was texting and calling the three of us to share his side of the story. I went out to lunch with him recently, and I told him how hurt I was by this whole situation. I told him how uncomfortable I was on Christmas Eve, which he apologized for, and that I don't want to see his girlfriend- I want to go out to see my dad, not this person I didn't even know about until Thanksgiving. I asked him to stop putting me and my brothers in the middle of this argument between him and my sister, and urged him to just talk to her. Both sides of this story are so different, I really don't know who to believe anymore. So I guess just let me know your thoughts/ and advice you have.",1,1736206927.0,u_Slow-Bed-4781,0,0.99,False

Item arrived on time, box looks fine, but it was packed loosely and the item had clearly banged around. Couple screws/washers had shaken loose from somewhere, and one of the stainless steel panels is bent.

1hvd8wa,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1hvd8wa/help_adhd_meds_and_hormonal_balance/,Help! ADHD meds and hormonal balance?,"Hello everyone! I am feeling lost and looking if anyone else have been dealing with an issue of including stimulant medication while balancing hormones and if they had success with solving it.

I got diagnosed with adhd in college in the US, grew up in a different country where hard work and hyperfocusing was celebrated and thought I was just a creative kid, who was studying overnight and at the last minute, but was magically always at the top of the class.

Now, during college in US (with the load being at least double of what I experienced in my home country) all the old tricks didn't work anymore, I quickly burnt out due to hyper focusing on every paper/ task, etc.
Got diagnosed with ADHD, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder and started taking hormonal pills. This cocktail while helping my mind, completely wrecked my body (indigestion and hemorrhaging), so after I finished the college I slowly tapered away from all the pills, alcohol and marijuana (5 months sober)

Removing birth control really scared me since my depression was highly related to menstrual period and also hormonal acne, so I did it slowly and with research, during which I learned about sugar level imbalance and all the advice against stimulants, including coffee.

So, I get rid of coffee and lower my sugar intake by a lot. Still holding up strong, except that now I find myself mostly innatentive throughout the day, and while first cup of matcha is sufficient, the afternoon till evening. I'm so slow and tired and unmotivated, which makes my job feel miserable.

I was thinking on picking up vivanse again, since it helped me the most throughout college but there comes the unavoidable cortisol levels with it, which I tried so hard to regulate for the past 2 months.

I like being off pills, the dietary changes helped stabilize my mood, I'm not depressed anymore, anxiety is manageable, but I feel so sluggish, can't make myself to passionately work, can't make myself to go workout, which I used to love...

Anybody figured out the hormonal balance while on ADHD pills? If so, would you please share the dosage/ timing and if you take it with food or not?

Context: I (21F) vaguely know another girl (20F), whom I shall refer to as R. R is good friends with one of my best friends and I've talked with R a couple times while out with our mutual friend. She has also tried to hit on my boyfriend a couple times (honest mistake--R didn't know we were dating) and claimed he was in love with her because he followed her on instagram at some point. I've always been cordial/friendly with her, but we both never really made an attempt to become friends ourselves. I think she's nice enough and I'm glad our mutual friend has made another reliable friend in her, but we don't run in the same circles so I only occasionally interact with her. However, it is important to note that I have very pronounced RBF lol.

The Issue: R is convinced I hate her for one reason or another. She's constantly complaining to my friend and her sneaky link (who is close friends with my boyfriend) that I've said or done something that slights her. Some examples include being upset that I called her pretty the first time we met (she insisted that I should've said gorgeous, beautiful, etc.), saying that I don't want her at parties (after I told our mutual friend that I just wouldn't go out of my way to talk to R at the party after the whole pretty/beautiful thing), or claiming I intentionally wasn't tipping her when she baristas at my fav coffee spot (???). R most recently complained that I was glaring at her when I was out drinking at a local bar with friends, but I don't recall ever seeing her there so I have no clue what's up with that. 

I'm just tired of the near constant accusations that I hate her from my bf's friend, R, and our mutual friend. I think it might partially be due to my RBF, but I genuinely don't really think of her because she's not in my circle and I'm a busy grad student. WIBTA if I told R that I just don't really care about her or what she does?

TL;DR: Girl thinks I hate her based on a few interactions, I don't even think of her unless reminded. I want to be blunt about where she stands in regards to my care for her.",1,1736205646.0,AITAH,12,0.67,False
1hvd1w2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/1hvd1w2/idk_if_i_should_date_this_girl/,Idk if I should date this girl...,"I (19M) have a friend (19F) I met in my first year of high school whom I liked a lot. However, she had four boyfriends during the three years of school so I couldn't reach to her in that way, but more as a friend. I started talking to her because we had a mutual friend. At first, she was cold, but eventually, since we were the only ""weird ones"" in the class, we got along better, and now she gets excited when she sees me and even shares almost all her problems with me without filters.

Her first relationship ended because the guy's family were Jehovah's Witnesses, and they didn't allow him to date someone outside their ridiculous sect.

She had problems with her second boyfriend to the point where she filed a restraining order against him for toxic behavior. I don't remember all the details, but at the time, she told me everything, and the guy was controlling and a terrible person. That was in 2023.

Then, last year, she dated a guy for four months, but they fought, and as an impulsive move (or maybe betrayal), she broke up with him and started dating someone else the very next day, which I found quite cruel, especially since it happened on Valentine's Day. That relationship didn’t last more than two months because she seemed to get tired of him.

She spent the rest of the year single, took a break from relationships, and focused on working. She seems more stable and recovered from her past relationships now.

Even though I fell for another girl for a while, it didn’t end well because she completely rejected me. With this friend, I feel like there's more trust now, and I'm thinking about asking her out for coffee. If it goes well, I’d like to keep inviting her to places like the park, the movies, dinner, and so on. You could say I've been waiting for her for three years, haha.

Considering her dating history, do you think it’s a good idea to ask her out? I don’t care about her past relationships, but based on her behavior, what do you think?

P.S. I've never had a girlfriend before, and she would be the first girl I ask out. If you have any advice, I’d really appreciate it.

I am now addicted to this drink, and everything else I try from the DeLonghi tastes watered down and has less flavor in comparison. The only downside is that it uses a crapload of beans, but I'm willing to accept that. My theory is that the ristrettos taste better because with the smaller puck size compared to a real espresso machine, the smaller volume of water with the ristretto is more appropriate.

I look over and I see this man.  An older guy, who is kinda robust and wearing a fisherman's hat.  All dark clothing and a large grey beard.  I was blown away because I knew it was GRRM.

So I asked my partner to come with me to see if we could get an autograph.  He was rather apprehensive about it, not wanting to bug someone who was clearly just there to eat some breakfast and enjoy a cup of coffee. 

I disagreed.  See, I remember back when I was younger and I ran into Edward James Olmos.  He was playing a game of basketball with a friend of his.  I stopped and said ""Hey Edward James Olmos, I like your style"", to which he asked if I wanted to join him and his friend for a game of HORSE.  Edward is an amazing basketball player.  ""Watch me make this behind the back shot off the backboard from 15 feet away"" he'd say, before he'd shoot it.  And he made it! 

So anyways.  I'm at this breakfast place and it's totally GRRM.  So I asked the waiter, ""Hey, that man over there in the hat.  Send him a Bears Claw , on us""  so the waiter did.  But he sent it to the wrong guy!  Oh man that was embarrassing.

Kind of like the time I met Edward James Olmos for thr second time!  He was at a bar and drinking Banana flavored liquor.  I went up to him and said ""remember the time we played HORSE?"".  He looked at me and said ""no, please leave while I enjoy my banana flavored liquor"".  That was embarrassing 

So back to breakfast.  Did I mention it was our 2nd anniversary?  Yup. Totally fitting.  So anyways, after the Bear Claw mishap, I got the courage to get up and talk to GRRM.

So I got up and noticed my shoe was untied.  And after I fixed it I noticed GRRM was leaving so I ran over and said ""Hey George, when's Winds of Winter coming out?"". 

GRRM looked back at me and said ""I'm not George, I'm Joe.  And that book probably won't ever come out"".

So there you have it, George now calls himself Joe and he said the book ain't coming out. ",5,1736205474.0,freefolk,1,0.59,False

My mind is far too awake to rest, though my body is exhausted. I see them talking, though I can't hear what they're saying. I can see the concern on their faces, especially on the doctor's. She moves her hands quickly, as if she's explaining something that worries her deeply. Miguel nods, seeming to give her his full attention, but then he suddenly stops, looks at me through the window in the door. I feel caught by his gaze, as if he's caught me in the act of spying, though I really can't stop watching them.

Miguel makes a gesture with his hand, something subtle but enough for the doctor to pause, look toward the door, and then, without saying anything more, they walk away. The door closes behind them with a soft sound that seems to break the silence that's taken over the room. I'm left completely alone.

The loneliness hits me immediately. I feel empty, and at the same time, full of a fear I can't understand. My head spins, my thoughts race back and forth, and all I feel is confusion. I want to rest, I want to sleep, but it's as if my mind is completely awake, as if I can't escape what just happened. The images of what I did earlier—the food, the disgust, the anguish—are still there, floating before my eyes, and I can't stop thinking about everything I shared with them.

I turn over in the bed, trying to make those thoughts disappear, but every time I close my eyes, the same images come back. My throat is dry, my mouth tastes strange, as if there's still something there that shouldn't be. My body feels heavy, as if I'll never get out of this bed. I try, I try not to think, I try to let sleep come, but I can't. Every time I try to sleep, it feels like everything is consuming me, like I can't stop thinking about what's happening.

Miguel and the doctor stepped away from the bustle of the hospital and walked to the terrace, where the cool afternoon air provided a brief respite from the tension surrounding them. They sat across from each other, each with a steaming cup of coffee, the distant hum of hospital machines faintly audible in the background. The doctor took a sip, gazing at the city in the distance, and was the first to break the silence.

\- ""What do you think?"" she asked gravely, her eyes still fixed on the horizon.

Miguel adjusted his position in his chair, lightly touching the edge of his cup as if weighing his thoughts. Finally, he leaned forward slightly, as though preparing to share a concern that had been turning over in his mind.

\- ""I think Violeta has an eating disorder, specifically orthorexia,"" he said, his voice steady but tinged with a hint of uncertainty as he named the diagnosis.

The doctor looked at him, searching his face for any sign that he might be mistaken. However, Miguel appeared confident in what he was saying.

\- ""Orthorexia,"" she repeated slowly. ""But... why?""

Miguel let out a sigh, setting his cup down on the table and crossing his arms. He began to speak calmly, as though reconstructing the information he had gathered.

\- ""It's a pathological obsession with healthy eating. The issue is that the obsession is with being healthy,"" Miguel explained, still reflecting. ""People with orthorexia often severely restrict their diets, not just for health reasons but because of a need for absolute control over what they eat. In Violeta's case, it's clear her relationship with food is distorted. She exhibits extremely rigid behavior... It's likely that any deviation from her strict diet triggers an emotional response as intense as the disgust and despair she experiences when she feels out of control.""

The doctor frowned, but Miguel continued, undeterred.

\- ""What makes me lean toward orthorexia is the intensity of her reaction. The episodes of hunger, followed by such profound disgust... they're not typical of other disorders. The aggression she showed toward the nurse, however, is less common in pure cases of orthorexia. But it might be a defensive response, a manifestation of her frustration and desperation at losing control.""

The doctor couldn't help but interrupt, surprised by the connection Miguel was drawing between Violeta's symptoms and the diagnosis he had proposed.

\- ""But what about the aggression? That bite... I don't think it's just atypical behavior for someone with orthorexia. It makes me think it could be something else... maybe an impulsive behavior disorder or something related to emotional regulation. These outbursts aren't just impulsive; they seem driven by a sense of danger, as though her body and mind are completely overwhelmed. What she did to the nurse... doesn't resemble anything I'd expect from someone with orthorexia.""

Miguel thought about what the doctor said. He took a sip of his coffee, then set it back on the table, gazing ahead as he reflected.

\- ""It's possible..."" he said at last. ""It's very difficult to diagnose someone when their reactions don't follow typical patterns. I've never seen a patient with orthorexia react so violently. That bite... it was an act of real aggression, almost as if she had completely lost control of herself.""

The doctor watched him more closely, recognizing the conflict in his words. She knew Miguel was experienced, but this case was particularly complex.

\- ""So... what do you propose we do now?""

Miguel remained silent for a moment, his gaze fixed on the coffee cup as he pondered.

\- ""I need more information... I need to speak with Violeta again, but this time with more time and no pressure. I need her to talk more openly about how she feels, about her relationship with food and these episodes. But I also need to speak with her mother. She might offer an important perspective on the family context and any factors that could have influenced her behavior. Sometimes... eating disorders have deep roots in childhood or the family environment.""

The doctor nodded slowly, understanding the need for more time and a broader context. She knew Violeta's case wouldn't be easy to resolve.

\- ""Alright. I'll speak with Violeta's mother and see how we can arrange an interview. But I also want to be present at the next sessions with her. I'm not sure I can leave her alone with the information you've given her... I don't think she's ready for everything that such a complicated diagnosis entails.""

Miguel nodded, empathy evident in his expression, but also a firm resolve.

\- ""I completely understand. My goal isn't to rush a diagnosis but to help her find a way to deal with all this. We need to be cautious and avoid putting unnecessary pressure on her.""

The doctor sighed deeply, still worried but feeling a slight sense of relief knowing that Miguel was so committed to Violeta's well-being.

\- ""Thank you, Miguel. I really appreciate it. I don't know what I would've done if you hadn't come.""

She moves her hands quickly, as if she's explaining something that worries her deeply. Miguel nods, seeming to give her his full attention, but then he suddenly stops, looks at me through the window in the door. I feel caught by his gaze, as if he's caught me in the act of spying, though I really can't stop watching them.

Miguel makes a gesture with his hand, something subtle but enough for the doctor to pause, look toward the door, and then, without saying anything more, they walk away. The door closes behind them with a soft sound that seems to break the silence that's taken over the room. I'm left completely alone.

The loneliness hits me immediately. I feel empty, and at the same time, full of a fear I can't understand. My head spins, my thoughts race back and forth, and all I feel is confusion.

I was not able to make a good group of friends yet, unfortunately. Being in the undergrad apartments also has a lot of upsides (free laundry, location, and just convenience overall). But it greatly lacks in the social scene, unless you get lucky with roommates.

I don't know anyone right now because all of my friends graduated and I was out studying abroad this past fall quarter. I was thinking about making a move to IV (was thinking maybe somewhere like 68 DP if I can) and live there. But I have never done anything with apartment stuff other than university owned places, and I don't know how to manage the cost (I need to talk to the financial aid office about this). I have also tried joining a lot of clubs and participated in activities but I was unable to find anyone that liked make plans or be willing to grab a coffee, etc.

Anyways, question is if it's necessary to live in IV to make friends. The people that live in IV, from what I have seen, are quite the social type. That's what I am looking for, along with cleanliness.

1hvcsi4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1hvcsi4/i_need_help_figuring_out_my_morning_routine/,I need help figuring out my morning routine ,"Hi everyone,

I’m working on improving my morning routine with ADHD, and I’d love your advice. My goal is to wake up at 4 AM, hit the gym by 4:20 AM on workdays, or go for a run by 5:30 AM on my days off. Currently, I use a Bluetooth lamp that turns on at 3:57 AM and an alarm clock across the room at 4 AM, which gets me out of bed—temporarily. The issue is, I often end up going back to bed because I don’t know what to do right away.

If my goal wasn’t working out, I’d shower, make coffee and breakfast, and then journal or write a to-do list. However, since exercise is my priority, showering first isn’t practical (as I’d need to shower again later). I also struggle with brushing my teeth first thing—it requires a lot of willpower to tackle.

I’ve been brainstorming ways to make the transition easier and thought of preparing a “wake-up kit” with a lollipop (instead of a cigarette since I don’t smoke), an energy drink, and headphones. The plan is to step out onto my balcony for a few minutes to wake myself up. However, my balcony isn’t roofed, so I’d need a backup plan for rainy or extremely cold mornings. Also, since I sleep naked, I’d have to prep some comfortable clothes and slippers the night before to make stepping outside hassle-free.

I think the balcony idea could be a good starting point, but I’d love suggestions on how to optimize it or alternatives that have worked for others.

Ultimately, I’m looking for a short, enjoyable activity that lasts about 15-20 minutes to help me wake up, give my medication time to kick in, and get me ready for exercise.

Any tips or ideas are greatly appreciated!

Thanks for your help!

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

I've been using a coffee I know well for months now without issue, getting 35-40g out in around 32s from 17g coffee in. I'm used to extraction starting slow at around 8s then the flow rate increasing, it gives a great espresso for drinking straight or making a milk drink.

I went away over the holidays, and when I came back I took a batch of this coffee out of the freezer (as I've done many times without this issue) and the extraction was incredibly fast, a high flow rate from the moment it starts, giving me my 40g out in 22-25s (I tried a few times). This makes a very sour shot as you can imagine.

Puck prep is the same, grind size hasn't changed, and no other step I can think of has changed. 
Has anyone else experienced this or could suggest a fix? 

For reference, the coffee I'm using is from a local roaster and is medium/dark.",1,1736204629.0,espresso,0,1.0,False
1hvcnjt,https://i.redd.it/m7sp42enfgbe1.jpeg,The Dove of Archbishop John Maximovitch,"When I came to San Francisco to be close to the saintly Archbishop John Maximovitch, I heard a lot of fascinating accounts of his ascetic life. Frequently I visited St. Tikhon's Orphanage, founded by this Saint, and run then by his long-time assistant, Mrs. Maria Alexandrovna Shakhmatova (+1967). Archbishop John was a very busy man, and I did not dare to be often in his presence. ...

The orphanage was no longer a place where children were sheltered....Within its walls was Archbishop John's tiny office, which was so small that even a bed would not fit, where he both lived and had his prayer-room and office...I would visit him there, and have long constructive talks that shaped my life.

One day I came to see Mrs. Shakhmatova, and she, as usual, insisted that I stay for tea, even though I never liked tea. She would get me into her kitchen, almost next to Archbishop John's office, and ask, almost in the form of an interrogation, about my whereabouts, what I had done that week, what I had read, etc. Usually she scolded me for not visiting her more often and not being closer to her ""orphans,"" who by then were already leading their own married lives.

This particular day I noticed a white pigeon with a reddish pattern in its feathers, making pigeon noises outside the window on a specially built ledge. It was pacing back and forth, obviously not intending to fly away, but, as I assumed, waiting to be fed. As it seemed no stranger to her, I paid little attention then.

On that particular feast day of the Baptism of the Lord, I chanced to be in St. Tikhon's for the Blessing of Water. The service was performed in the little courtyard right under the kitchen window, which had a separate gate from the street through which I had entered. To my great surprise, as St. John was blessing the water, a dove flew right out into the courtyard. It flapped its wings and actually soared over the basin of holy water, while all of us vigorously sang: ""When Thou, O Lord, west baptized in the Jordan, the worship of the Trinity was made manifest. For the voice of the Father bore witness unto Thee, calling Thee the beloved Son, and the Spirit in the form of a dove confirmed His word as sure and steadfast ..."" I was amazed, as I had never seen such a service with a live dove hovering over this holiness.

The sight was unforgettable. St. John stood there with lifted hands, holding a huge golden Cross high above his mitered head, and the bird flew high about the building next door, and then with a swift graceful glide descended upon the Saint and sat on his shoulder. Then, loudly flapping its wings, it flew way up into the air, only to descend again, to the utter joy of all there, and it did this several times. St. John, apparently oblivious to the bird's spectacular maneuvers, continued deep in prayer. It seemed so natural, as if it were all a standard part of the holy ceremony. A similar event occurred in the life of St. Basil the Great, when a dove was seen by St. Ephraim the Syrian to be whispering holy words into St. Basil's ear.

After the service I was invited to drink a lot of the water inside St. Tikhon's Orphanage, and to partake of tasty treats. Archbishop John was there, and the bird was outside the window on his ledge, apparently feeding. There I learned the following touching story of Archbishop John's ""heavenly bird.""

Once Archbishop John came home to discover that a pigeon was hurt, his wing was damaged, and was sitting outside the window. He opened the window and let it in. The bird could barely flutter, and Archbishop John bound its wing and fed it. That was enough to make it feel adopted. The bird stayed around, especially when the Saint would arrive and would feed it. Actually it remained a mystery how both of them conversed. But one thing we knew: the pigeon reacted to the words of St. John as if it understood what he said. I was told that both of them would sit facing each other, the man softly speaking and the bird making its pigeon sounds in agreement and peacefully walking to and fro, as if memorizing what it was taught. This company Archbishop John kept for a long time, until his death. The pigeon lived on that window ledge and would often fly around in the kitchen and the main visiting room, and in the little corner office of Mrs. Shakmatova in the northwestern corner of the house. I saw the bird fly around, and wondered why they had no cage for it, as for a canary. But I was told, ""It is Archbishop John's friend and companion."" It was a friendly bird, often eating from his hands.

Once I came and saw Archbishop John sitting silently next to the window, his head in his hand, thinking, watching the bird; and the bird was sick. I never learned what was the matter, but there was silent contact between the dove of the Baptism of the Lord and John its ""Baptist."" (The altar boys said that, by sprinkling the bird during the blessing of the water, Archbishop John had baptized the pigeon, and that it was a ""baptized"" bird.) Mrs. Shakmatova later told me that the bird was a sort of messenger of mysteries for Blessed John, but I never pried for an explanation. On the day Archbishop John died, the bird began to pace the window and flutter in agony, as if knowing about its master.

One frequenter of St. Tikhon's Orphanage wrote: ""We all learned to love that little friendly bird, who became a close friend to man. It never flew too far from the house and never chased other birds, as if its little heart sought warmth from people; and it had no greater joy than to fly into the house and sit quietly on some corner of an armchair. Often when Archbishop John would drink coffee in the kitchen, the bird would knock at the window pane begging to be let in and then it would sit on the Saint's shoulder and watch his hands as he blessed the bird.

""When the death knell announced the earthly end of Archbishop John, the bird was frantic. It fluttered in agony, missing the Saint, and its little heart also stopped a few months afterwards, to our deep sorrow.

""I remember how someone said firmly that one should not cry over a bird, it is sinful. How harsh this resounded in my ears! Why is it a sin when a quiet sadness touches a heart over the loss of the little ones given to us by the Lord Himself to protect, who also are capable of giving us love. I remember Archbishop John's words to me when I used to complain that in some cities birds are removed from the streets: 'Yes, now throughout the whole world, attacks are carried out against all living beings that surround us.""'

At that time there was a veritable persecution of pigeons in San Francisco, due to the assumption that they carried some disease, and hundreds of them were poisoned or shot. I do not know these details. But I do remember vividly the beautiful white-feathered creature flying about the little bentdown figure of the precious Saint, who not only loved this God-sent bird, but had some mystical contact with it. The bird appeared in his life when he endured the greatest of his earthly trials; it forbade his ascent to the other world, and some other mysteries I was told about. That feathered little creature of God was sent as a consolation to the sorrowing man of God, rendering him greater solace than men could do, who at that time were inflicting upon him his greatest pain. Men who hate men cannot understand how animals could be truly God-sent consolers.

A spiritual daughter of Archbishop John, Olga Skopichenko, recalling this dove, even wrote a lovely poem, in which she hinted that the appearance of the bird, damaged by cruel men, was for our Saint a little window through which he gazed into heaven.

It’s like I walked into one of those retrofitted Tims back home, but with the actual quality and service level that they should have. Whoever operates the Mexican franchises should be commended. They had a churro cruller that I’ll try next time, as well as “Canadian” and “Mexican” coffee options, plus Mexican chocolate caliente. The rest of the menu options were standard (they had ice capps and could make a double double if I wanted one); I also noticed a nice looking iced matcha or chai tea latte (looking like Starbucks quality). Finally - they had a special bread/donut for Epiphany (Día de los tres reyes) here in Mexico! 100% an 8-9/10 experience (it seems like it’s a premium option for Mexicans here) - super cool to finally have a good Tims again, now if they can improve it back home too?

One of my long-time IG mutuals has been liking my stories for awhile. He’s from out of state but has been here visiting family so he reaches out to me last minute asking to grab coffee the next morning. It was perfect, he explains to me how he wanted to reach out to me a few years ago but he didn’t have anything to offer me and didn’t wanna waste my time. The date goes really well. He texts me thank you for the good time. He FaceTimes me asking if I wanna go out for dinner. We meet for dinner and we really hit it off. After this he consistently calls me checking in or just to talk the next few days. He was kind of shy and I can tell is the type of guy to take things slow but still really charming. All of a sudden about three days ago he texts me straight in the morning that he doesn’t think we should see each other again because he knows he’d ask to start something.. I just responded saying “and that’s not a bad thing… but ok.” I definitely don’t want to be the only one trying but it just sucks cause i thought we had a good thing starting. He never responded after that. Not sure if there’s anything else I can do. Seems like he’s sacred to start something ? I understand long distance would be hard but after he had said he didn’t reach out before due to his reasons I thought he would be okay with it as would I… ",1,1736204486.0,AskMenRelationships,2,1.0,False

1hvceti,https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1hvceti/what_are_some_of_the_most_disingenuous_arguments/,What are some of the most disingenuous arguments you've encountered about AI and how did you handle them?,"There was a gaming stream and hang out I was a part of and we were all just casually talking about different things. With the new year the topic turned to what people's plans were and what they were looking forward to, and I couldn't help but express excitement for what 2025 and 2026 would bring.

What followed from that was one of the most uncomfortable discussions I've had over voice-chat, all stemming from a guy determined to shoot down every word outta my mouth. And this wasn't the first time he had acted like this, it had happened before when Tesla came up, and he was determined to show off his totally uninformed super-cynicism around Tesla's progress with self-driving, saying it was 'impossible', 'would never happen', and that Tesla was losing money. He did actually apologize for getting at least some of it objectively wrong when later I posted a source on Tesla's profits. And there are videos out there of hours of uninterrupted footage with the latest Tesla updates self-driving without human interference in busy cities. But I digress.

So this dude - let's call him Adrian - he's full on interrogating me as though he were Cathy Newman or something, and attempting to contradict everything I say about why I think 2025 and 26 are gonna be so exciting. His main argument was basically that it's all over-hyped, that it isn't the consumer that is the main target of AI news, but rather investors. It was only later when I reflected over the whole conversation that I realized how slimy this was because it was like this conspiratorial point of view in which he gave himself permission to dismiss anything I could possibly say as supporting evidence for the progress of AI and by extension robotics.

Like I'm just trying to say at the start of this conversation that I think humanoid robotics would be neat. Then he's countering with there's no need for humanoid robots because you can have specialized robots to individual tasks. So I say something to the effect of, we have designed our human world to be convenient for humans, therefore there would be utility in humanoid robots. And he can't just agree to disagree, right? He's gotta try to shoot down everything I say. He says something stupid like, then why not design the world around robots. And it's like, what does that even mean? Is he just saying stuff for the sake of being contrary? I was stunned into silence for a moment then I said, because we'd still be humanoid. But someone else was talking over me at this point. I was outnumbered in this conversation, which is fine. I'd say there were 5 or 6 of us on voice chat and I was the only one optimistic about the next couple of years in regards to AI. The main issue I was having was Adrian and how rude he was being, and putting me in an awkward position of how much I should push back when we're all just supposed to be hanging out and having fun.

So then he's talking about how in the past the view of the future of robotics was of Rosie the Robot using a vacuum cleaner, and how unnecessary that is when we have Roombas, repeating his earlier point about robots being specialized to individual tasks being better than a humanoid robot. And it's like, a Roomba can't help you carry a new sofa into your house, can it? It couldn't make you a coffee and breakfast and bring it to you while you're in bed. It couldn't give you CPR in an emergency. And while you could conceivably design  a robot specialized to one of those tasks, at a certain point there's much more utility with having one robot that can do all of that over clogging up your home with multiple specialized robots. And his contention that a robot set to one task would be better than a humanoid robot is a presumption - he doesn't actually know. But he talks as though he does know.

I think that's one of the things that was bothering me the most. He'd say his points with total confidence, and dismiss anything I said with total confidence, but it's unearned confidence. He's not thinking this stuff through. Think about the position it puts me in in the conversation. There is no polite way to say, hey, if you can't see the utility in having an extra pair of hands in the home that understands what you're asking of it and can do pretty much anything a human can within the home, that's your problem, that's your own lack of foresight, that's your own lack of big picture thinking that is the issue. So I don't say a lot of that because I'm holding back. I hate being put in that sort of position with someone who is smugly and confidently wrong, in a setting where you're just supposed to be chilling out with people.

So instead I bring up Moore's Law and exponential increase of the technology. He says it's physically impossible for Moore's Law to go any further because you can't fit anymore transistors onto a chip. I say there's other things that can pick it up and keep it going like quantum computing and the fact that it gets cheaper to run high end AI. He says it gets more expensive. And I say no, it gets cheaper. We've seen that with LLM models like with 4o compared to Turbo.

I bring up the fact that the latest LLMs continue to smash through benchmarks and not by a little but by significant margins. He says you can't trust benchmarks, going back to his point of view that such information is to entice investors, like it's all just slight-of-hand.

I say that you can see with your own eyes that current AI is exponentially better than even what it was just a couple short years ago. I cite the Will Smith eating spaghetti example, and how, in my words 'it's 100x better'. And he's like, 'better at what?' And I'm like, ' Showing Will Smith eating spaghetti!! It looks way more real, the physics of it are way better, and it hasn't been that long at all', and he couldn't even just acknowledge that it is objectively better. And not just better but exponentially so. His abject refusal to honestly engage even with that simple point on what he can see with his own eyes with video generation was particularly slimy. 

And he's like, 'I know what you're going to say next', and proceeds to attempt predicting what I'm going to say, talking over me as I'm trying to talk, and he thinks what I'm gonna say is that we just have to trust that it will get better and better so that there's utility, and I'm like 'that's NOT what I was gonna say, what I was gonna say was that there's utility with current AI even assuming little to no improvement over the next decade.' That's an incredibly arrogant thing to do, to talk over someone and assume you know what they're gonna say. And it was particularly ironic in the context of the whole conversation. I talked about the computer scientist and psychologist Geoffrey Hinton's belief that LLMs reason and he dismisses that because 'other people have another opinion', lol! But Hinton is a proper authority. Adrian cited what his friends think of Tesla in a previous conversation!

And it's like, yeah, while you brought up the topic of whether we can keep expecting it to improve - why wouldn't we? What's the rationality in saying, well, it's exponentially improved right up to our current moment, but it's not going much further?

What's the utility? he asks about video generation. And I respond even with just short videos there's plenty of utility. Art, memes, testing out ideas, people can edit together short movies made entirely by AI video generation. So he insists that it looks too bad for it to have utility. I tell him that I myself use AI video generation a lot, and just a short time ago I wouldn't have been able to.

Overall an incredibly uncomfortable conversation. He wouldn't accept anything I said, not one single thing, while smugly, confidently being wrong. To be honest he's single handedly ruined that particular group for me. It's no fun trying to talk to someone like this. Whether it's about AI or any other topic. Trying to have a conversation with someone who insists on trying to shoot down everything you say and with unearned smug arrogance is the shits.
