And now it‚Äôs offering courtside seats to the Final Four in my living room. Welcome to March Madness 2025, where AI and cutting-edge technology are driving the buzzer-beater moments of the NCAA tournament‚Äîwithout spilling your nachos.

**AI Bracketology: Say Goodbye to Gut Feelings**

Forget the era of picking brackets based on your favorite mascot or your college colors. The real MVP this year? Algorithms crunching data points from player stats to historical game outcomes faster than you can say ""Cinderella story."" But here's the rub: while AI might seem like your winning ticket, it can‚Äôt predict the glorious chaos of an underdog upset‚Äîthe kind that leaves all brackets broken by round two.

**Robo-Commentators and Digital Drama**

AI-generated commentators promise never to miss a play. Imagine every shot and shuffle analyzed with superhuman recall of obscure stats, eliminating those dreaded silent lapses during a game. Yet, nothing would drive an AI crazier than trying to decipher the logic behind a coach's questionable timeout (unless, of course, it called it first).

**Virtual Reality Courtside: The New Couchside Reality**

Who needs arena seats when VR tech lets you wave your foam finger from home? Soon, the rush of courtside thrills will fit right next to your coffee table. Just be cautious on those close-call games; no one wants a flat screen down because you forgot it's not a real court you‚Äôre storming.

**AI Coaches and the New Clipboard Crew**

Human coaches, let your AI assistants handle the heavy data lifting. Picture this: AI analyzing opponents and offering a play-by-play before it even happens‚Äîa digital strategy czar. On a side note, let's hope it doesn't start yelling at refs too.

**Referees‚Äô Savior: Computer Vision**

No more ‚Äúwas it a three?‚Äù arguments. Advanced computer vision tech will dissect every millimeter of play action. The ball's on the line? Leave it to cameras more precise than any human eye, seriously stepping up against the human-error factor.

As the final buzzer approaches on this future of March Madness, one thing‚Äôs for sure: while AI might bring precision and digital dazzle, it can‚Äôt replace the human heart at the center of this beloved tournament. Just don‚Äôt forget to bring a digital whistle‚Äîor a towel for those nervous nacho sweats.

1ipy2mc,https://www.reddit.com/r/PregnancyUK/comments/1ipy2mc/crossing_boundaries/,Crossing boundaries,"13w3d. Pregnant with my second. 

With my first, when I was 18 years old, people thought it would be okay to share their most disturbing horror stories. I had people chime in constantly giving me advice, several people telling me not to hold my baby too much, otherwise I‚Äôll spoil him! It‚Äôs also when I lost the majority of my friends. The most genuine ones stuck around - so maybe that wasn‚Äôt too bad. But it sucked at the time. 

6 years later I‚Äôm getting the complete opposite. I sometimes talk to parents at my kids school in the morning and pick up. They‚Äôre friendly, and I actually grew to like some of these women. One, I even got her number and we text. However, since finding out, some of the other ladies have felt the need to overstep some boundaries. 

Lady 1: accidentally found out way too early that I was pregnant. She snuck up on me at a coffee shop (which I don‚Äôt go to anymore to avoid her - I go to coffee shops to chill alone). I was holding my belly (I was cramping) and she said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre pregnant aren‚Äôt you? You‚Äôre holding your belly‚Äù. I was caught off guard, so I guess my lack of answer gave it away? Since, she‚Äôs ran up behind me, shook me, picks up my son and has even planted a kiss on his cheek. (That was yesterday - I found out when I got home which has made me so angry). I‚Äôve already told her that I don‚Äôt like being touched and that we teach consent in my family, but as you can see from yesterday, she still doesn‚Äôt understand what consent is and doesn‚Äôt respect our boundaries. 

Lady 2: I told her a few weeks ago. She was cool at first, as she‚Äôs had many children herself. She started telling people without consulting me first, stated that she will be having my baby over night and for a few days once they‚Äôre here, said she can‚Äôt wait to hold and kiss baby and has made backhanded comments. For example ‚ÄúI hope you have a girl because they‚Äôre the most difficult‚Äù and ‚Äúyou look like you‚Äôre carrying two‚Äù. On top of that, every single conversation she tries to drop hints about ‚Äúif your husband can‚Äôt do this, I‚Äôm up the street‚Äù. We don‚Äôt go to each others homes and she‚Äôs never asked to have my child who‚Äôs already here. I‚Äôve said no one will be having my baby, no one will be holding and kissing them either and I‚Äôve pointed out her weird behaviour and that I feel like she‚Äôs trying to knock me down a few pegs. I have been met with ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean it *that* way‚Äù. Again, no idea what that means. 

So yeah. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm stressed out every morning, having to rethink my route into school to drop off and pick up my child, so I can avoid these people. But sometimes I can‚Äôt *not* avoid these people because the school isn‚Äôt huge! I also find myself hiding behind other people and hoping someone else comes up to me to talk so they leave me alone. I‚Äôve told these people how I feel and they just don‚Äôt listen. I could deal with strangers making weird comments‚Ä¶ because they come and go. But these are my peers, people raising my sons friends. 

The only thing I have going for me is that we‚Äôre moving in October so I don‚Äôt have to deal with these people for that much longer.

Feel like I followed it pretty well for the first go but the overall brew took about 4:10, JH recipe says to aim for 3min. Also the resulting slurry looks quite cakey. 

The coffee tastes clean, not too bitter, but feel like I was expecting more flavour from it. 

First thoughts to improve are‚Ä¶

1. More aggressive 1st swirl for bloom phase
2. More agitation with pour
3. Grind coarser

I followed the recommended grind for the baratza encore esp which is +7 steps from where I grind for espresso for these beans.

1ipy1rk,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Just-Vacation1575/comments/1ipy1rk/am_i_over_reacting_to_this_or_did_my_family/,Am I over reacting to this or did my family really just slap me in the face?,"I'm feeling betrayed and sad and I don't know if I should be or if my family has just clouded my judgement. 

A couple weeks ago my dad came to me with excitement on the fact that there is an old shop that is closing and I will have the opportunity to run this on my own! 

I have been working stictly with my family a little over 4 years and on and off (due to school and other jobs) for about 3 years before that. I've learned the recipes, been reliable, quick, and efficient. I work 12 hour days at least 3 times a week and I've I'm not already asleep and get called in to help I show up. Which is usually a weekly thing. I do this while trying to be present in my home life with my wife and do extracurricular to try and maintain some sort of exercise. I work 12 hours a day because my family has convinced me that that night shift is where I am needed and that it is crucial for me to be there. I bided my time and even took on more work as I was considered an owner under all the paper work but receive no percentage of the earnings. I chalk that up to me not putting any money into it so I just get paid as a regular employee just slightly more than everyone else.

Let just say my work and home life was very stressful. So when my dad tells me I have an opportunity to not only run my own shop and earn more I was actually pretty excited. I could finally run this place right and hire some reliable. I had already talked to my wife about joining me in the job as this could be something we could do together so we can see each other more. I was stoked and ready for this chance!

So I set up the meeting with the building owner and we already bought the equipment inside the building. So all we have to do is check the inside and outside for any blaring issues. There was only one. There was some water leaking from under the sink and we needed it serviced before we could begin to open the place. I spoke with the building owner and he agreed to get a plumber to fix it as long as we get the power running so the plumber can use his equiment. Well, in order to get the lights turned on we needed a sellers permit in order to make an account with power company. So my dad had our account/paperwork person submit our permits and my dad told me it should take a week. I told him to let me know as soon as anything changes and if I am needed for anything let me know as I wouldn't be the one the accountant would call(probably my first mistake). I sent the building owner my id to start the lease and I waited. The permits were submitted on a firday afternoon and me knowing the city closes at 4pm and won't reopen until Monday morning I wouldn't hear anything until the next week. So I started planning. Who I would hire, what I'd do with the place and start figuring out the financing. My mom calls me soon after and tells me she is proud of me and that she can't wait to see what I do with this buisness. I felt so happy and couldn't believe it was finally happening!

I asked my dad on the following Monday if there was any changes and there was non. So I waited. My week was a normal one. It is tough and I barely get 8 hours sometimes since i work long hours and since my wife and I only have one car so i have to wake up and go pick her up from work. So for reference I go in at 1 am and sometimes don't leave until 11 am, sleep for an hour, go get whatever is needed for the shop so that's usually another couple hours. Go home, take care of my house duties and sleep another 3 to 4 hours. Pick up my wife and then get home eat and either take a one hour nap or stay up till 12 am since I haven't seen my wife all day and get ready to go in at 1 again. 

So comes Thursday. I go in for work and ask my why my sister's taken out her stuff from the shop? Now, my sister and I don't get along. She has wronged me, spoke ill on my wife, and crashed my wedding for starters. I can list off all the things she's done but this long as it is, but she sucks. So her being at our shop was already an issue to me. The only bad reviews we have on our shop is from her and her baby daddy who don't know how to treat people. So them being gone was good new but I wanted to know why. Turns out that her baby daddy and homie got in a fist fight with a customer and my dad kicked them out. I had just left for home and didn't hear any of this till Thursday night from my mom. In telling me this she slips In the fact that her and my sister were cleaning the shop and I was confused and was wonder what she was talking about. She was talking about the new shop and that my sister was preparing to sell her coffee there. I was furious. I wanted nothing to do with her and didn't want her poisoning my new business. Well apparently my dad decided to leave the buisness to her. I was no longer going to run the new shop. I was devastated, infuriated, and just feeling betrayed. My sister who has literally done everything wrong in her life up to this point was being given the opportunity that I was just told was mine. I don't think I'm perfect but I stay out of trouble, I didn't drink or do drugs as a minor and I work hard for my family. Now the person who has done the opposite is chosen over me? 

I don't know. Maybe I'm overreacting but I already started looking to work elsewhere as I just don't see a future here. All I want is the same respect as my sister considering all I've done for this shop. Am I wrong for wanting that?",1,1739612653.0,u_Just-Vacation1575,0,1.0,False

But to give context, we've been together for 2 and a half years, but we basically officially started dating on Valentines Day 2 years ago. Because the first Valentines I made him a diy Minecraft flower with a note that said 'You are mine and I am yours'. And he woke me up to a grocery store bouquet of flowers (I'm not hating on it or criticizing and I loved and appreciated it so much but it is what it is), a Starbucks coffee and Valentine themed cupcakes made by his friend. But the next year (1 year into our official relationship) there was nothing from him or me, but we went out to a chinese dimsum place. And this year it was also nothing from him or me. I'm an international student and I have no income or pocket money, and he is aware of it. But I did have a few dollars that I had saved so I looked on Amazon a few days ago for a gift and couldn't decide, so I put it off to ask him to choose it later himself as we didn't have a chance to sit down and actually like talk. But today (on Valentines) he had nothing for me just like I had nothing. So I asked him why didn't he get me anything for Valentines and he asked me ""Did YOU get anything for me?"". So yeah basically I was hurt by that, and even though every girl around me was getting presents and flowers and posting it for everyone(me lol) to see and I kind of believe that mostly men should give the flowers and presents on Valentines day and I'm pretty sure most people around the world say men should do so as well...

How to Personalize Your Accessories with Unique Floral Designs
--------------------------------------------------------------

Personalizing your accessories can be a fun way to express your individuality and create unique combinations that reflect your style. Flowers have always been a symbol of beauty and freshness, making them a perfect choice for customization. Floral designs can transform simple pieces into stunning accessories that will turn heads. Here are some engaging ways to personalize your accessories with unique floral designs.

### Choose Your Floral Focus

When it comes to floral designs, variety is key. Begin by selecting the type of flower you love the most. Consider these popular options:

- **Roses:** Symbolic of love and passion, roses come in myriad colors.
- **Daisies:** These cheerful flowers embody innocence and purity.
- **Sunflowers:** Known for their bright and optimistic vibe, sunflowers can brighten up any accessory.
- **Lilies:** With their elegant shape, lilies are perfect for a sophisticated touch.
- **Tulips:** These versatile flowers work well for both casual and formal themes.

### Get Creative with Printed Accessories

One of the quickest ways to add floral designs to your collection is through printed accessories. Look for items like:

- Scarves: A floral scarf can add color and personality to any outfit.
- Phone Cases: Customized phone cases with floral motifs can make your phone stand out.
- Purses: Floral prints on bags can provide a fresh look.
- Socks: For a hidden pop of floral fun, opt for brightly designed socks.

### Explore Embroidery and Patches

For a more hands-on approach, consider applying floral embroidery or patches to your accessories. This method allows you to create personalized designs that convey your unique taste. Here‚Äôs how you can do it:

- **Choose a base:** Pick accessories, such as denim jackets, backpacks, or caps, that are suitable for embellishment.
- **Pick your florals:** Select specific embroidery designs that you like or create your embroidery pattern featuring your favorite flowers.
- **Stitch or iron on:** Use a needle and thread to stitch the floral designs onto your accessory, or opt for iron-on patches for a quicker option.

### Incorporate Pressed Flowers

If you're looking for something truly unique, consider using pressed flowers. This technique captures the beauty of real blooms and preserves them for your decor. Here are some ways to use pressed flowers:

- **Pendants:** Create a necklace or charm using a small glass pendant filled with pressed flowers.
- **Coasters:** Make coasters embedded with pressed flowers for artistic functionality.
- **Phone Cases:** Craft custom phone cases by setting pressed flowers in resin that hardens to create a beautiful, protective layer.

### Explore Floral Jewelry

Jewelry is another area where floral designs can shine. You can find pieces made entirely from flowers or accessorize existing jewelry. Here are some tips:

- **Floral Bracelets:** Look for artisan-crafted bracelets featuring real or artificial flowers that make for a stunning accessory.
- **Earrings:** Floral-themed earrings can add charm and elegance to any outfit.
- **Rings:** Floral rings made from resin or metal shaped like flowers can be conversation starters.

### Customize with Dried Flowers

Utilizing dried flowers is another innovative approach to achieving a personalized floral design. Dried flowers are durable and come in many shapes and colors. To successfully use them:

- **Select Flowers:** Choose dried flowers that complement the accessory you are customizing.
- **Adhere with Care:** Use strong adhesive or resin to securely attach dried flowers to your chosen accessory.
- **Seal the Design:** For extra protection, consider applying a clear sealant over the flowers to maintain their beauty.

Personalizing your accessories with unique floral designs opens up a world of creative possibilities. These designs not only let you express your personality, but they also allow you to carry a piece of nature with you wherever you go.

Dec 23, 2024: I went to Deera Square, got a coffee at Elixir Bunn Coffee Roasters. Saw this Saudi local who was not covering her face, so I asked her why she wasn't wearing it and that started a conversation. We hit it off immediately and hung out until 1am. Highlight was I drove her around in my car (rental) and we held hands.

Dec 24 - Dec 30: We stayed in touch on Instagram, sending loving messages to each other. Turns out she's 25 y/o, studied at King Abdulazziz University about Sharia Science and had a fiance who was a policeman. Her father was a Brigadier General in the Saudi army. We messaged back and forth romantically. I believe she comes from the Al Bogami family, presumably powerful local military family.

Dec 31, 2024: We hung out again until 1am in my hotel.

Jan 2, 2024: We hung out again until 1am in my hotel. Next day I flew back to USA.

She told me she really loved me but in her community (tribe), she must marry a cousin. Her dad has her passport, so running away with me is not an option, and it would also cause a huge scandal to her family.

Ever since I came back to USA, I've been wanting to marry a Saudi/GCC/Khaleeji woman. They are fiercely loyal, maternal and beautiful.

The first 2 months were surprisingly easy, considering this is now the second time we‚Äôve gone NC long term. This past month has been rough, I don‚Äôt understand why.

We were no contact from Sept 2023- June 2024, nearly 9 months. Until she saw me in a coffee shop and tapped my shoulder. We wound up catching up the next day for lunch, but that turned into dinner and the whole rest of the day, and eventually making plans for the next day with me dropping her off at home at 3AM.

It was only supposed to be sexual I told myself, but it fell right back into watching shows, cuddling, staying on FaceTime while asleep, sleeping over and waking up with a wild grin just looking at her cute face drool on the pillow. Of course that couldn‚Äôt last, because she said she didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúintentionally date‚Äù me. That she worried about how she always became codependent on me. Isn‚Äôt that just love?

I know I‚Äôm just missing something that doesn‚Äôt exist anymore. But it‚Äôs hard to push this out of my mind for so long, and it worked for a while, keeping my feelings at bay. But still I think about her every day, sometimes I see her in my dreams. I just wish I could have her in my arms again. I just wish I didn‚Äôt have to make the choice to not reach out, but I do so because thats what she wants. 

I don‚Äôt regret the 4 months we spent together last year- I knew that it was going to hurt, and I hate every second of this.

I just kept hitchhiking and see where I could get.
Actually, I didn‚Äôt have any particular ambitions to do in Iran.
So I did some very normal things. For example:

Photo 1: Hitchhiking
Drivers are usually cheerful in Iran. So he put on some music and sang while driving.

Photo 2: Learning to dance
There are flyers for Azerbaijani dance classes on the roadside.
The privilege for foreigners is that they can take classes for free!

Photo 3: Playing football
One day I was hitchhiking in a small village. There are not many residents. But there is a big football field.
Just playing football!

Photo 4: Wandering on the street
There's really nothing to do, so I just took a walk on the road.

Photo 5: Swimming
The temperature in summer can reach up to 45 degrees. I was hitchhiking in a valley and the locals invited me to swim in a stream.

Photo 6: Hiking
In fact, I didn‚Äôt know where to go, so I just hitchhiked to a village. The locals invited me to go hiking near the village.

Photo 7: Hot Spring
There are many hot springs in Iran and I stayed in a great hot spring hotel. $8 per night. I stayed for a month. I went to the hot springs every day.

Photo 8: Stroll in the park
Iranians love parks very much. My biggest hobby is to go to a corner of the park and sit and rest. I also enjoyed street performances.

Photo 9: Eating
Need more explanation?

Photo 10: Drinking coffee
I have never seen a country where people love drinking coffee so much. When I had nothing to do, I went to teahouses and coffee shops sometimes.
The locals usually greet me warmly and then take me to their homes to stay for a few nights.

Photo 11: Going to the mosque
I have a habit of going to the mosque to sleep for a while, replenishing my energy and washing myself before continuing hitchhiking.
Once I went to a mosque and the students who were studying Islam warmly invited me to sit with them.

Photo 12: Street Food
Sometimes when I was hungry I just bought a snack on the street. The vendor owners are usually very welcoming.

Photo 13: Going to the market
Shopping.

Photo 14: Going to the fish market
Shopping.

Photo 15: Going to the gym
Locals love to invite me to the gym to exercise with them.

Photo 16: Randomly invited to have tea
Whether hitchhiking or walking on the street. I probably drank dozens of cups of tea every day!

Photo 17: Exchanging money
Usually before exchanging money, I would tell them a joke to make them laugh. They will give me a better exchange rate!

Photo 18: Prayer
Friday prayer routine.

Photo 19: Haircut
One of the most interesting places in Iran is the barbershops.

In some places, locals have to practice traditional dances before attending weddings.

I don‚Äôt know how else to say this‚ÄîI‚Äôm lonely. Not the kind of loneliness that comes and goes, but the kind that lingers, settles in your chest, and makes everything feel a little heavier. I‚Äôve spent so much time alone that I don‚Äôt even know what it feels like to belong anymore. I watch people laugh, exist together so effortlessly, while I sit on the outside, trying to remember the last time I had someone to talk to‚Äîreally talk to. Someone who cared, someone who stayed.

I take pictures of empty streets, lost moments, stray cats. Maybe because they feel familiar. I go to museums just to stand in front of paintings and pretend I‚Äôm not completely invisible. I get lost in films‚ÄîWong Kar Wai, Ray, Flanagan‚Äîbecause at least their stories remind me that loneliness isn‚Äôt just mine. But movies end, books close, and I‚Äôm still here, sitting in the quiet, wishing there was someone to break it with.

I don‚Äôt want much. Just a friend. Someone who actually wants to talk, to share thoughts that don‚Äôt feel like small talk. Someone who wouldn‚Äôt mind grabbing coffee or walking aimlessly through the city, just existing together. I don‚Äôt want to feel like I‚Äôm shouting into a void anymore.

1ipxmjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkAdvice/comments/1ipxmjo/manager_seeking_advice_on_underperforming/,Manager Seeking Advice on Underperforming Employee with Attendance and Performance Issues,"Hi all,

I joined my current role as a manager four weeks ago and inherited a team member who has several performance and attendance concerns. They are consistently late for work and meetings, often stopping to assist others on the way to meetings and not telling people they have somewhere else to be, example a meeting with one of the SLT team they where 7 mins late, the meeting started, and said they where outside the door waiting while i said no you where not, i could see you on the phone to someone and so could the SLT team and you did not say sorry for being late, but not making up the lost time. Over the past eight months, they have missed six days of work, and their performance does not align with the expectations for their salary after nine months in the role.

I have raised these concerns with HR and my own manager, expressing that I don't believe they are meeting expectations. They are quite inexperienced, requiring extensive training, I dont think they have the background they say they have as I picked up on this after 2 weeks, and I‚Äôve also noted that they have some personal challenges, including mental health struggles they have PTSD and a strong dependency on their partner for life decisions and work decisions. 

For two of the nine months, they had no direct manager and did not have a good working relationship with their previous one. Given the ongoing issues, I had a discussion with HR and my manager about their timekeeping and performance. We decided to place them on a performance improvement plan (PIP) to assess whether they can improve. This discussion took place after they had gone home sick, but based on context, my manager and I suspect it was stress-related rather than an actual illness‚Äîpotentially triggered by personal circumstances.

This brings me to our one-on-one meeting yesterday. They arrived 10 minutes late (despite it being the first meeting of the day) and were also 30 minutes late for work again. I addressed the timekeeping issue directly, stating that if they are paid for eight hours, they need to work eight hours. I emphasized that while I am flexible with work hours, we need an agreed schedule rather than unpredictable arrivals. I also made it clear that another unexcused absence would escalate to a formal HR hearing, which I want to avoid.

At this point, they had a full emotional breakdown‚Äîcrying, shaking, and expressing anger toward me, the company, my manager, and HR. Given the intensity of the situation, I immediately called my manager, went to HR, and brought in a witness along with a support person for them. The breakdown continued, with them claiming they were never properly trained.

When they asked about their performance, I was honest and explained that significant improvement is needed. Over the past four weeks, I‚Äôve had to step in repeatedly when new hires started because nothing was prepared‚Äîlaptops, phones, desks, accounts, etc. Additionally, I have to micromanage their tasks daily, as they frequently walk away from issues without informing me. This results in me having to diagnose and fix problems myself instead of them escalating them appropriately. I reassured them that improvement is possible, but they need to take initiative and ask for help when needed.

Their response was that they ""haven't been told what they are supposed to do."" I pointed out that they have been given clear direction‚Äîthis is an IT support role, ensuring things work for end users. My role, on the other hand, is to handle the business side, coordinate with management, plan IT projects, and provide leadership and we have a full SOD of what my role is and what your role is. It was also shared that unexpected goals and deliverables where put on them by people, I asked could you tell me who and if you have email or chat proof send it to me and I will speak to these managers and people. 

At the end of the conversation, they requested a five-minute break for a smoke. HR and I looked at each other and acknowledged that we have a serious problem. I have since decided that I will no longer have one-on-one meetings with them without a third party present. They believe they are performing well, but after nine months, their inexperience is still a major concern.

At the end of the meeting I asked them to take 30 mins and go to the local coffee shop for a walk and coffee with the support person to clear there head and said to them when I am stressed I go into a room and have a scream or go for a walk for 5 mins and have a coffee. And I can help you to do this if you ever feel like you need it. However this was refused and they called there partner over going for a walk. When they came back they would not speak to me and would only deal with me via emails.

So, what are your thoughts? How should I proceed from here as I have been a manager for 8 years out of my 12 plus years of working and I have never seen a mental breakdown in front of me from feedback over timekeeping and performance ?

My thoughts is that I cut my loss and start with someone fresh in the role?,

I also put coffee grinds around the base of the both trees which might also be part of the issue but as I said‚Ä¶the other tree is loving it. I called my local nursery and they suggested that the tree might have hit limestone in the ground which can also cause this appearance and that I do a soil PH test.

\*Candy for me is a little mood lifter. when you don't want a full snack but just a nugget of sweetness. Alternatives to sugar like Isomalt make pretty convincing sugar tasting candy that's not like the usual sugar free candy. Though even those have gotten better over the years in my opinion

Plants: A

\*Almost like having low maintenance pets if you squint your eyes hard enough. Helps me build routine, and even though I have no animals around for me to take care of recently, thinking if x plant has had some feed or water recently and keeping them in mind I feel is a helpful exercise in mindfulness

Small scale baking: A

\*I'm not a bread or cake guy, a little impatient and while I'll very occasionally make a small loaf, I prefer the quick turnaround sweets and snacks. Cookies and cupcakes and muffins and brownies oh my. total crowd pleasers doesn't hurt as well. It's hard to be in a sour mood while eating these kinds of things

Thrifting: A

\*If you can organize and plan well, the ticket to getting many many things for basically nothing. So much of my home is furnished and supplied with stuff from thrifting. I'll never not be in the mood for a quick peak in these types of stores, the stuff is usually cheap enough that I don't care if I'm there for practical or impractical reasons

Cocktails: B+

\*I'm not in it for the inebriation, but the cooking-esque overlap interest of the herbs and flavor profiles. I find making a really classy and balanced cocktail pleasurable

Miniature painting: B

\*I enjoy the activity a lot, but miniatures and models in general kind of demand you always get more. Sometimes I'm not in the mood for the throughput of constantly buying and making more little dudes for the table so I'll shelf this one semi-often

Archery: B

\*Shooting bows is a pretty fun thing. It can be really tiring to do for a long time though, and if you live anywhere nearly windy as where I am it makes shooting a lot less appealing on those days. Otherwise great for improving general hand eye coordination

Slingshots: B

\*Similar bonuses to archery for me, but with gigantic bags of clay shot ammunition for cheap it allows you to shoot all day without ammo retrieval. Also about a third of the draw weight compared to bows, you can shoot them all day easy. Sometimes not as satisfying with small dinky hits though, depends on the mood

Gaming: B-

\*A couple of titles a year will keep me enthralled and addicted, but I use them more as a passive time waster at night more than anything. I wish I could be as addicted as when I was younger but that's very rare nowadays

Painting: C+

\*I like to paint things to change their appearance or upgrade how something looks like a miniature, but raw ideas for painting a picture for me is much harder. I still do it on occasion but the mood is way more rare than wanting to paint something I physically made or collected

3D Printing: C

\*For the first 6 months I was unhealthily obsessed with 3D printing. it fueled and continues to fuel my other hobbies in small ways, like an ammunition roller to make 9mm clay balls for my slingshots. But when I've caught up with my needs, it has long swathes of time with no use at all. Now it gets used maybe once every 3 months or so

Coffee: C

\*Being interested in coffee is nice when you can learn about temperatures and preparation methods, and how you can improve your process. But it's another thing to where when you learn what you learn, it's kind of... Done? Interests in cultivars and where beans come from and history is kind of cool too, but it ends with me being able to make coffee good enough for me.

Tea: C

\*The exact same thing as coffee. Was obsessed with learning about many dozens of types and flavors from all over the world, but now I don't have anything else I want to pursue with it.

Resin casting: D

\*I used to cast my own brand of tabletop gaming dice, and for a while it was super fun. Kept me intrigued for almost 6 months straight. But I have more than enough of them, and don't play any pen and paper games anymore so this hobby has died off a lot

Mold making: D

\*This was paired with resin, but I still think about other ways I could use what I learned for other things. I thought about making a mold of some miniatures and casting them out of various colored resins just to see how they look

Leatherwork: D-

\*I wish I had an excuse to do more of this. The nice rolls of leather I like that are impregnated with oils, fats and colors for beautiful marbling are expensive, and after so many wallets and straps the material is hardy enough that I never need any more. No interest in monetizing hobbies so this one has been dead in the water for over a year now

Apologies in advance as I appreciate we can't diagnose and need to wait for results and liaise with medical.

I'm in UK and been referred for a urgent colonoscopy due to 496 ug/g raised calprotectin as dr thinks I have IBD which came as a shock. 

I know I shouldn't until I get the results but I hadn't even heard of IBD before this. 

So over the last 6 months I've had sparodic diarhea getting caught short on dog walks as I get stressed when I'm away from toilet and had 1 instance of being on the toilet non stop like 9 x in the end water was coming out. 

Imodium then bunged me up for a couple of weeks around Christmas time. That day my diet was horrible I had redbull, lots of coffee and sugar so not sure if it was related. 

No blood in stool when passing but did have a tear which the dr says would explain the blood on this instance when wiping. 

Fast forward to now and my stools are from the Bristol chart type 5-6 light brown colour. On and off constipated but it's been getting better and passing stools regularly 2 x. 

Slight discomfort around right side and energy levels are somewhat ok maybe a little tired. 

I'm just confused Fit test was negative and bloods CRP are all fine. 

So this raised calorotectin is the kicker for me 496 which is elevated. 

What the fudge is going on? 

Reasonable health, run regular but also a fan of takeaways and coffee and chocolate :(

I would always see him here and there at gatherings but never having an actual conversation. Long story short we started getting a bit close right before Covid we sent each text messages and it was kind of happening on a daily basis. Obviously, I started to seriously like him. He also invited me to a party he had at his place and only hugged me out of the ladies. I was thinking there was some interest there. And from gatherings he‚Äôd drop me off last passing my place and making sure I‚Äôm the last one he drops off. Our conversations were fun and we were always giggling.  It was nice and it made really happy. So Covid happen and it changed everything. Someone also broke into my place during Covid and assaulted me but not rape. This affected me greatly and I had recurring nightmares of someone breaking into my place. My mind couldn‚Äôt focus on anything at the time. He was still very sweet and had a zoom call with a friend to encourage me. Not long after though he moved back closer to home .

Alex

Waking up early has always been something I despised, but today, I don‚Äôt mind because today, I'm gonna get the information I need. Finishing my cup of coffee, I head to the diner Eliza frequents and speak to the staff about her. I didn‚Äôt learn much besides her favorite food and how she likes her coffee. I asked about any possible partners or romantic interests, and they all said they‚Äôd never seen her with anybody besides her best friend, Sophia. I made a mental note to have Marco talk to Sophia since she‚Äôs already seen me, and I'm sure to tell Eliza if she knows it‚Äôs me asking.

After I finish at the diner, I place the call to Marco, having him Go talk to Sophia discreetly about Eliza while I speak to some of the bar regulars that I have seen on the camera feed. Most of them all had the same thing to say ‚ÄúShe is smart, kind, compassionate, beautiful, and they wish they could ‚Äútap that.‚Äù It took everything not to kill the ones saying that they wanted to tap that right then and there. 

There was a weird feeling in my chest hearing those words come from their mouth that I didn‚Äôt want to put a name to. I discovered she flinches at sudden movements from men, a reflex that hinted at a past she was trying to escape. It made my heart ache knowing she carried that burden, and she is always trying to make someone feel better and bring joy to people. So, it's not my usual type what is wrong with me?

I decided that my next place would be the library custody of the information we got from Sophia. I have the librarian pull up the book list of all the books she's checked out. One thing I have learned from social media and my older sister. You can tell a lot about a girl by what she reads. Turns out she wasn‚Äôt wrong. Looking at the list of books the librarian printed out for me is interesting, to say the least. For someone everyone claims to be innocent, she reads a lot of spicy, dark romance books. My obsesi√≥n amorosa has a dark side. I can‚Äôt help the smirk forming on my face.  Thanking the librarian, I give her a hundred-dollar bill and tell her to keep it for helping me. Right as I'm walking out of the library, I receive a call from Marco.

‚ÄúSpeak.‚Äù Marco's reply comes instantly ‚ÄúWe have a problem, boss.‚Äù The smirk I had before was no longer there. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù The other end of the call goes silent for a moment before Marco‚Äôs response comes through. ‚ÄúThe salvators are planning an attack.‚Äù Of course, they are. As I said, distractions are weaknesses, and Eliza is a distraction. But she's my distraction, and I'm too invested to stop now I will make her mine. ‚ÄúOk, go on defense and up the security. Do we know when they are planning the attack?‚Äù He asks our scouter, then replies, ‚ÄúTomorrow night around eight.‚Äù A low growl of anger comes up before I respond. ‚ÄúOk, we will be ready.‚Äù I hang up and head straight to the penthouse to check the cameras and change before heading to the warehouse to help prepare for the attack tomorrow.

Once I arrive at the warehouse, I start handing out weapons and planning defense and offense strategies. After we have gone over all the details, I tell the crew to be prepared for anything and always expect surprises. Shortly after, I head home and decide to watch the cameras. Her shift ends in two hours, so for the next two hours, I spend my time in front of my computer screen watching her work. Once I know she is safely in her apartment, I decide to go to bed. 

The next morning, I'm already at the warehouse, covering our usual deals. I hand out the supplies for our dealers and send them on their way, and then I head down to the torture room to check on our guest that Marco and the scout have been working on. Looking to Marco, ‚Äúany new information?‚Äù He looks back at me ‚ÄúNo, our friend here claims he doesn‚Äôt know anything else. All he knew was when the attack was happening.‚Äù Looking at the prisoner now, I grab a knife and walk over, dragging it slowly down his chest, cutting enough to hurt him but not kill him, yet stopping right above his pelvis. ‚ÄúIf you don't start talking, you're gonna start losing body parts, starting with your cock for all the women you've abused.‚Äù The prisoner screams in pain as I cut down him, crying, ‚ÄúI swear I don‚Äôt know anything else I only overheard when the attack was taking place.‚Äù Irritation and anger covering my face, I remove the knife from his pelvis and move to his chest again. Marco looks at the prisoner and steps back ‚ÄúYou're in trouble now. Should have just told us what we wanted to know.‚Äù I take the knife and press it into his chest, slicing his nipples off before cauterizing it and moving to his hand. 

‚ÄúTell me the truth, and this will all be over. What are they planning?‚Äù He screams out in pain, on the verge of passing out. I throw some water in his face, waking him back up, and he cries out in pain. ‚ÄúOk, ok, I'll tell you please! They plan to use the guns and explosives they got from the shipment they intercepted to take you guys down. They hired a few recruits to place the bombs on the building and detonate them after they killed all of you to ensure there was nothing left, but that's all I know! I swear!‚Äù Stepping away and setting the knife down, looking back at him. ‚ÄúI believe you,‚Äù looking over at Marco and giving him his order, ‚ÄúKill him.‚Äù I head upstairs to check on everything we have less than an hour until the attack. 

I check the security cameras and then start gearing up, putting on my vest and stocking up on weapons. I hear the first shots ring out, and everyone comes out firing their guns. One by one, we kill every single one of these pendejos traidores. In total, I think I killed at least 30 of them myself. Hopefully, we don‚Äôt have to worry about any backlash from their allies.

The weight of the cleanup settled heavily on my shoulders as I drove home. Every mile was a struggle, each turn of the wheel was a reminder of the monumental decision I had to make. Was this obsession worth the risk? Was I willing to jeopardize her safety, her very existence, just to have her? The questions gnawed at me, echoing in the silence of the car. Reaching my home office, I poured over the information I had gathered, the images flickering on the screen, the data a chilling testament to my determination. The answer was clear. She would be mine. I wouldn't rest until she was. If I couldn't have her, then no one could.
Chapter Six

Liz



The morning unfolded as usual: coffee, a quiet moment to myself, and then the familiar routine of showering and getting ready for my evening shift. But tonight, I craved something different. Instead of heading straight to work, I decided to treat myself to a pre-shift dinner at the diner. My usual order, chicken manicotti, and cheesy garlic bread, always hit the spot.

As the waitress approached, her smile was warm and familiar. ""Hey Eliza, good to see you again. Want your usual?"" she asked. ""Yes, please,"" I replied, ""I've been craving it lately."" She scribbled my order down, then looked back up with a friendly twinkle in her eye. ""No problem, sweetie. Anything else?"" I shook my head, settling into my booth and picking up my book to pass the time while I waited.

The diner was always a comforting haven, filled with the familiar hum of chatter and the aroma of coffee and frying bacon. I flipped open my book, the worn pages whispering stories of faraway lands and forgotten times. The waitress, her name was Sarah, I think, brought me a glass of iced tea and a basket of warm bread. I nibbled on a crusty roll, the buttery scent filling my senses. It was a simple pleasure, but at that moment, it was all I needed.

She soon arrived with my meal, a steaming plate of chicken parmesan that smelled divine. I took my time, savoring every bite, the rich tomato sauce mingling with the crispy, golden-brown breading. The mozzarella cheese stretched in gooey strands as I forked a generous portion, relishing the satisfying crunch. Once I finished and settled the bill, I headed back to the bar, starting my pre-opening routine. As I diligently wiped down tables and filled the ice freezer, Sophia sauntered in, her face beaming. ""What's got you so chipper?"" I asked, curious. Sophia chuckled, ""Because I snagged a hot date tomorrow with possibly the hottest man alive!"" She winked, her eyes sparkling with excitement. Sophia leaned in closer, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. ""We met on Hinge, and he‚Äôs not just a pretty face; he‚Äôs got this amazing sense of humor that had me laughing the whole time we chatted. We‚Äôre going to this trendy new Italian restaurant downtown, and I can‚Äôt wait to try their famous truffle pasta. I‚Äôve heard the ambiance is perfect for a romantic evening, with soft lighting and cozy booths. Plus, he‚Äôs a huge foodie, so I‚Äôm hoping we‚Äôll bond over our love for good food. I‚Äôm already planning what to wear‚Äîsomething that makes me feel confident and fabulous!"" Smiling as I nod my approval and finish opening the bar.

The bar buzzed with a Friday night energy, the usual crowd of regulars and new faces filling the space. I was juggling orders, pouring drinks, and wiping down tables, my hands moving in a practiced rhythm. Sean, one of our regulars, settled onto his usual stool, his face etched with the familiar lines of worry and relief. He launched into his usual nightly monologue, a mix of work woes and family triumphs. Tonight, his daughter's place on the honor roll and his son's budding musical talent took center stage. He recounted how he and his wife had finally worked through their recent argument, the relief in his voice palpable. I listened intently, offering a sympathetic nod and a reassuring smile, happy for him. Then, a shadow fell over my heart. Sean mentioned a man who had stopped by earlier, asking questions about me. My stomach twisted. Had my ex-husband found me? The thought sent a jolt of fear through me, a wave of panic washing over me.

My mind raced, trying to piece together the puzzle. Who could this man be? Had my ex-husband finally tracked me down after all these years? The thought sent a chill down my spine. I'd moved here to start fresh, to escape the past, and now it seemed to be catching up with me. I tried to brush off the fear, reminding myself that maybe it was just a coincidence. Perhaps it was a friend of Sean's, someone who simply knew me from the bar. But the knot in my stomach wouldn't loosen. I needed to know more. I excused myself from Sean, my mind buzzing with questions, and headed towards the back room, hoping to find some privacy to gather my thoughts.

The back room was a haven of quiet, a stark contrast to the bustling bar. The scent of cleaning supplies and the faint hum of the refrigerator filled the air. I leaned against the counter, my hands trembling slightly. I needed to call someone, someone I could trust. But who? My phone buzzed in my pocket, a text from Sophia. ""Hey, you okay? I'm heading out. See you tomorrow."" I quickly typed back, ""Just a bit stressed. See you tomorrow."" I couldn't tell her about the man, not yet. I needed to figure out what was going on before I worried her.

Thankful It was closing time when I clocked out I shot Sophia another text thanking her for closing up alone tonight and headed up to my apartment. The familiar routine felt comforting, a quiet haven from the chaos of the bar. I quickly logged into my fake Instagram account, the one I used to keep tabs on my ex. He'd posted a picture, a cheesy grin plastered on his face as he stood on a cruise ship deck, arm in arm with some new woman. The caption read, ""Living the dream!"" A wave of relief washed over me, a breath I hadn't realized I was holding escaping my lips. He was miles away, happily oblivious to my existence.

But if it wasn't him, then who was the man who'd asked about me? The question lingered in my mind, a nagging itch I couldn't scratch. I needed answers. After a quick shower and a change of clothes, I crawled into bed, hoping a good book would distract me from the growing unease. But the mystery of the unknown man kept me from fully relaxing, the pages blurring as I tried to focus on the words.

1ipx3r0,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1ipx3r0/i_didnt_get_my_gf_a_valentines_day_gift_now_im/,I didn‚Äôt get my gf a Valentine‚Äôs Day gift now I‚Äôm fucked,"So yesterday was Valentine‚Äôs Day and I thought I get my gf a nice gift, as I always do when there are dates like this.
I work 70 hours a week and Friday is my only off day, it‚Äôs actually important so keep that in mind. 

So during the week I had a free 1-2 hours on Wednesday so I went to the shop to get her something that I know she‚Äôd like, but unfortunately couldn‚Äôt as it wasn‚Äôt in stock. I didn‚Äôt have much more time because I know she‚Äôd ask why I‚Äôm not home yet (she doesn‚Äôt work, quit her job a few months ago and enjoying the time at home. I have some criticisms of this but it‚Äôs a different story) and I wanted it to be a surprise so I figured I‚Äôd get up earlier at Friday and get her the gift, as Thursday I physically couldn‚Äôt do that (had an important test at uni, and straight after that a wedding we both went to together). 

So comes Thursday evening, we come home from the wedding after having a great time, it‚Äôs 5:00 am, and I tell her that tomorrow morning im going to the gym, which is actually to get her the gift but I wanted to surprise her. She gets upset at that because she wants us to wake up together and have a coffee together and all that as we never do that because of work and that‚Äôs the only day we can, I try convincing her that I‚Äôll be home before she even wakes up but I still see it upsets her so I say that fine I won‚Äôt go. I have a problem that I hate it when she gets upset at me, it really makes me feel terrible and I do anything I can, at my own expense most of the times to avoid that. 

I thought that in order to avoid her getting upset at me for ‚Äògoing to the gym‚Äô I‚Äôd stay at home with her and get her the gift I wanted to get her the next day, and while it‚Äôll be a day late it‚Äôll go in smoother fashion and all good.

Well I‚Äôm a fucking dumbass. Such a fucking stupid way of thinking. Of course even when she‚Äôs upset that I left early she‚Äôll be happy to see me come home with a gift for her. I didn‚Äôt think she even remembers Valentine‚Äôs Day so it won‚Äôt be an issue to get her the gift a day later. 

It‚Äôs Friday. I sleep a shit ton of hours as I barely sleep during the week, and I see her getting up so I want to get up with her, have some time in the morning together as I like it and I suppose she likes it too, just as I‚Äôm about to get up she asks me to stay in bed. I say I want to get up, she replies with ‚ÄòI want to get up alone‚Äô which clearly offended me, because it basically means I don‚Äôt want you around. I get back to sleep and after a few minutes I try getting up she says that I should go to sleep as she wants her morning to be ‚Äòcalm‚Äô I‚Äôm like wtf ? 

2 hours later I finally get up and she‚Äôs drinking her coffee (for 2 hours ?) and I ask her what was it about her not wanting me to get up? She says that she saw that I want to sleep and didn‚Äôt want me to get up because she did. I‚Äôm saying that I wanted to get up, she‚Äôs saying that I didn‚Äôt actually and that she didn‚Äôt want me to get up because of her which oissed me off because why would you decide when it‚Äôs the time for me to get up? 

Anyway I make my coffee and as soon as I‚Äôm about to sit down besides her she goes to bed which upset me even more, like don‚Äôt you wanna be around me at all? 

Anyway we have a huge fight over this as she keeps repeating that lame excuse of her not wanting me to get up just because she did.
I‚Äôm upset, she‚Äôs upset and now she comes saying that she hates the fact that she makes me upset and doesn‚Äôt like seeing me all sad and these stuff. I suggest we make some food and she agreees, meanwhile she hands me a nice gift she bought me, I say thank you hug her and explain to her why I haven‚Äôt got her anything yet‚Ä¶ this is where shit hit the fan. 

She doesn‚Äôt like my ‚Äòexcuses‚Äô. Says that I wasn‚Äôt important enough for me and that I don‚Äôt care for her at all. I apologise over and over again. I acknowledge my fuck up and ensure her that I do care for her and it‚Äôs just been a stupid decision making on my part and I feel really terrible about it. It obviously doesn‚Äôt help and she‚Äôs upset and mad, won‚Äôt talk to me at all. I‚Äôve tried apologising dozens of times and she says I shouldn‚Äôt apologise as that‚Äôs just who I am(as of a cold hearted fuck who doesn‚Äôt give a shit about her) which is not true. I always get her shit and always show her gratitude and compromise a shit ton of my life for her but I guess it takes a single mistake. 

I‚Äôve tried explaining my thinking process over and over again. She still says I don‚Äôt care for her and I‚Äôd rather sleep than do something for her and it wasn‚Äôt important to me. Hours pass by and nothing. She doesn‚Äôt want to talk nor to communicate, nothing. 
While I did fuck up, I didn‚Äôt know the consequences were going to be so harsh. 

TL;DR: 
Didn‚Äôt get my gf a gift for Valentine‚Äôs Day because I thought me leaving the house would upset her, now she‚Äôs upset and won‚Äôt speak to me.

Do you think Ice‚ÄëT ever comes home from a long day in the studio and says to his wife, Coco, ‚ÄúHey, baby, check out this new record, this new song I worked on today‚Äù? And she‚Äôs just like, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt right now, I have a million things going on. The grandkids are coming over, we have to watch Sophie, and we promised Uncle Jim‚Äî‚Äù Then her phone rings. She answers it, putting one finger up while tucking the phone into her shoulder. She turns back to Ice‚ÄëT. ‚ÄúSorry, hun‚Ä¶‚Äù

She continues her conversation on the phone as she turns away from Ice‚ÄëT, her voice trailing off in the background. ‚ÄúWe would stop by, and dinner‚Äôs almost ready‚Ä¶ maybe later.‚Äù She glances back at him, mouthing, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs great, hun,‚Äù barely audible as she disappears into the fog of the kitchen.

I bet they have one of those ‚Äô90s phones with a really long cord hooked to the wall‚Äîexcept this is the present day. And he‚Äôs just like, ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù He turns his back and walks off in the opposite direction. But he‚Äôs actually kinda bummed because he really wanted her to hear it. How could she not wanna hear it. This song was a bout bitches and everybody luvs bitches. He walks away with his head lowered, her voice no longer reaching him.

He‚Äôs been married for, like, 30 years. I think that‚Äôs awesome. Can you imagine their 50th wedding anniversary? They invite a bunch of people over. It‚Äôs very formal. All the men gather in one room.

There‚Äôs a poster on either side of the walkway leading up to their house. On a stand on the left side is a blown‚Äëup poster of the two of them‚Äîprobably their senior prom picture from 1989 or something. And then, on the other side, there‚Äôs a more recent portrait. It‚Äôs a classic Sears‚Äëstyle studio photo: Ice‚ÄëT sitting on a bench or a stool, Coco standing slightly behind him on a box or something, her hands folded neatly on his left shoulder. The background is black with neon lasers shooting through it, some stars, and probably a slight fog effect. It looks like you could roll it up towards the ceiling and swap it out for a different one. Maybe there‚Äôs even a plastic Roman marble column next to them with a big gold ‚Äú50‚Äù on top.

That‚Äôs right‚ÄîI‚Äôm describing their future anniversary photo. You thought I was still describing the one on the left, but no, I‚Äôm talking about the one on the right. The after. The one taken at a Sears studio during the year 2045. That‚Äôs right. I‚Äôm talking about the future.

And here‚Äôs the kicker‚ÄîSears Portrait Studio comes back. Ice‚ÄëT buys it. He becomes the CEO. He opens up 3,000,675 Sears stores nationwide and single‚Äëhandedly lowers inflation by pricing goods and services fairly. Regular people can afford to buy quality things again. Sears overtakes Walmart. His prices aren‚Äôt based entirely on corporate greed. Sears saves America. Ice‚ÄëT saves America.

I wonder if he ever does chores. Not in the future, but, like, now. Or does he just walk over to the couch, kick off his shoes, and sort of jump backward into it, landing in a relaxed, almost waterslide‚Äëlike position? His back pops, like, six times. He reaches for the remote. Can‚Äôt find it.

‚ÄúThis goddamn couch in my living room is 35 feet wide and 20 feet long. It‚Äôs made out of minks or something. Minks and eagles.‚Äù

He‚Äôs already lying down and doesn‚Äôt want to look for the remote. He strains his neck forward, scanning the coffee table. It‚Äôs a slab of 6,000‚Äëyear‚Äëold tree bark, thawed out of a glacier. It‚Äôs covered in cereal bowls and random junk.

‚ÄúGoddamn it,‚Äù he mutters.

He sighs, ‚ÄúAlexa, turn on my damn TV.‚Äù

She replies, ‚ÄúOkay, Ice‚ÄëT.‚Äù

And then, every TV in the house turns on at once.

‚ÄúFuck.‚Äù

A baby wakes up in the distance.

From another room, his wife yells, ‚ÄúBabe!‚Äù

He whispers to himself, ‚ÄúGoddamn it.‚Äù

I hate it so much. He had been a casual friend to me, and most of what we did together was going out eating, cafe etc... Just talking about works, games, our mutual hatred for the regressed tradition of our relatives concerning family and marriage (lol). All in all, I could say we got a pretty OK friendship, not so close to be called close friend (IMO), but close enough to call each other anytime one find a restaurant/coffee shop we wanna try.
     But that's all there was for me. I just don't want us to go further than that. I'm pretty sure I acted dude-like enough to deter any attraction he could develop from our outings, I cussed a lot, all we talked together are games and techs and anything boy-ish; I acted just like another bro in his group of bro-friends. And to be honest, I intentionally acted dismissally and distantly enough whenever the frequency of our meeting became too much. I felt guilty at times for being a dick to him, but I really dreaded of him sprouting any attraction to me, because I honestly thought he asked me out way more than any normal friend would.
   When he asked me to be his gf, I didn't even waste a second before I said no. Not a milisecond after that question ended. He took it jolly enough, something about you would never know if you never ask, and I agreed. I asked if he know I was ace/aro, and he said he wasn't sure (the fucker reacted to a meme I shared about asexual people attracted to the letter A, 
and there were plenty times where I expressed how much nuisance straight relationships was, so I can't understand why he wanted to push that with me) I asked him to be normal, and he said he wouldn't do anything strange, but man... It felt terrible, and it was worsened by the fact that we're not alone- there were people sitting nearby in the cafe we chose. I don't want to make my friend feel bad or lose face, but man...
    He left, as we had been here since morning, and I did said I felt guilty for keeping him here for so long when I still have work to finish and he had nothing to do. And now I'm here, torn between deadline and the terrible taste of guilt and shame and resentment. I asked him to be a normal friends going forward, and apologize for my rude answer (I only said a simple no, but the speed I gave it was foul), and maybe he would. He hadn't reply to my message yet, and I do hope he could just act as nothing happened, and we could be normal buddies, but I can't fucking shake off that memory, and I don't want to feel that cringe every time we go out together.
     I don't want our friendship to be ruined. I value good friendships way more than any relationship I have in my life, wayyy above any silly romantic love could be, and even family bonds. And I hate that our friendship can't be the same anymore.

1ipwwit,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1ipwwit/6_weeks_cold_turkey_experience/,6 weeks cold turkey experience,"From the holy trinity of social drugs. I'd quit cigs, booze and all forms of caffeine on 1.1. 

The first week was devastating. I didn't have any motivation, my sleep was all over the place, I had to snack all the time against the cravings and was a mental mess.

Now 6 weeks later I can clearly feel how much better my life is every time, I quit those nasty dopamine fixes.

Pros:
- anxiety 95% reduced
- depression gone
- much more productive in the evenings
- deep restful sleep 
- cravings 90% gone
- already saved a shitload of money
- better energy management (actually listen to my body when it's tired instead of crushing another grueling workout and have a rest day instead)

Cons (or learnings. I don't think that there are downsides actually):
- takes me an hour to get productive in the mornings, which is totally fine
- no easy way for cleaning my house anymore. Thinking about paying someone to do it
- if I have to wake up with an alarm before my natural rhythm, I'm a mess for a few hours
- if i accumulate sleep deficits several days in a row, I'll get brainfoggy
- my nucleus accumbens misses getting smashed with friends


Took me a while to get there though I remember that my sleep was all over the place 3 weeks in. No I sleep like a baby, if I follow my schedule strict from 1 to 8/9.

My energy tanked the first 2 to 3 weeks and I had to nap most afternoons. My energy has been back to normal since than. I still get tired but not nearly as tired as during a caffeine crash. If I do get tired, pushing my heart rate up with some jumping jacks does the trick.

I have ADHD but refuse to take medication, because I abused amphetamines in the past and get strong desire for booze if I take it.
Caffeine clearly helped me manage the symptoms but tanked my mood every time I used it a few hours after the ingestion and often spiraled my alcohol cravings out of control.

I had to get rid of my coffee maker, because it was easy for me to relapse if I'm able to brew at home in the past.
Cravings for coffee were the hardest and my mind tried to trick me a dozen times.
I journaled everyday multiple times for the first month to get somewhat used to the mind games of my addiction and to prevent me from slipping several months down the road when I'm fully recovered and think that it wasn't that bad after all. Happened to me two times before.

I still feel that a lot of healing is going to happen and will remain the rest of 2025 in this teetotalish state.

I live a healthy lifestyle and do heavy lifiting+cardio 3 times a week, fast for 12+ hours daily, eat clean and have 2 active jobs. I use the sauna weekly and indulge in both, heat and cold exposure.

I think testimonials are crucial in this sub and have to admit that quitting caffeine is no walk in the park for me. If you're new, stick to it - it will get better!


Have a great weekend!

1ipwvf0,https://i.redd.it/bgdotkm7h9je1.jpeg,Review #6: Maker‚Äôs Mark Private Selection - R. field Wine Co. ‚ÄúSweet & Sexy 2024‚Äù,"FYI intro (skip if you just want the review): Not an expert by any means. I use the reviews on here to choose whether or not to buy something, so I‚Äôm trying to return the favor. Only giving simple notes (no ‚ÄòAmazonian rain forest rock moss in October after a 2 inch rainfall‚Äô or anything like that). No info that I don‚Äôt personally care for, like historical backstory or weird trivia on the bottle or company. 

Stats: 109 proof. 0-3-3-4-0 stave profile. NAS.

Prep: Poured in a glencairn neat, rested for 10 minutes. Top pour. 

Nose: Dessert bomb. Milk chocolate, maple syrup, French vanilla coffee. I also get a little apple or apple pie-y undertone

Visual: Deep Tawny/Mahogany (1.6). Medium legs. 

Mouthfeel: Silky. Little bit of viscosity, but not too thick. It really compliments the chocolate note, reminding me of a chocolate bar that was out on a hot day for a few hours. 

Palate: Same notes as the nose; I couldn‚Äôt find the apple from the nose though. Reminds me of a coffee that‚Äôs not quite black, but not nearly enough cream and sugar to satisfy a Starbuck‚Äôs teen. A bit of ethanol burn at the start but it fades early. 

Finish: medium-short. Same notes from on the nose/palate, but richer. A more dark, bitter chocolate. 

T8ke: 6

Value: 3/5 (would pay around MSRP)(MSRP $70, but bought for $65)

Conclusion (skip if you don‚Äôt care about personal input):

I asked a question on this subreddit about couple weeks back about which staves are the best for these picks. I decided to wait it out, and stumbled upon this bottle for under MSRP on a grocery store run. I decided to pull the trigger. 

This is a great bottle to keep on the shelf for a dessert or late night pour. I don‚Äôt think this is something I can pour whenever I want; it‚Äôs more of a nuanced profile that I‚Äôd drink under specific circumstances. The low proof (to me, at least) would make it a nice first pour after dinner as a dessert substitute, or a last pour late at night as a wake-me-up with its coffee-like characteristics.

That being said, it‚Äôs not AMAZING for the price. I think Maker‚Äôs really hit the mark (get it?) on how much this juice should be worth. I got it for slightly under MSRP; I‚Äôd probably buy another at MSRP if I‚Äôm craving it, but I wouldn‚Äôt buy it for much more. I also wouldn‚Äôt go out of my way to stock up multiples of these. 

Overall, this is a nice bottle. It‚Äôs definitely no scam for its price or popularity, but it also isn‚Äôt a must-buy unless it‚Äôs on clearance. Of course, this is a single barrel so your mileage will vary. ",4,1739607155.0,bourbon,0,0.83,False
