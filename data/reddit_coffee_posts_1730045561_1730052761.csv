1gdh70e,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1gdh70e/diy_basement_renovation/,DIY Basement Renovation,"A few years ago, I renovated two stories of a house in Catalunya, Spain. My [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/ond4c7/i_renovated_an_abandoned_house_in_catalunya_my/) about this project proved popular so I thought I would give an update to further work on this house.

I did not do much to the basement. I was glad to be done building work, so I used it for general storage and just got on with my life. A few years later, I find myself with ten weeks of 'free' time, so I decided to renovate the basement into a small guest apartment.

The work required the demolition of a section of wall, the pouring of approximately 10 tons of concrete for a new slab, and the building of a new bathroom, bedroom and living room.

**The over-all project**

The apartment is approx 35sqm (380sqft) and I spent about £10k (€12k / $12.5k). All in, it was quite a low-cost renovation considering the feature set, custom doors and material quality.

[The basement, just after starting demolition.](https://preview.redd.it/i2tssyzkybxd1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=01860c6dad6c00e62d314be75484c3b086c3ac4d)

A key problem I faced was that it was not possible to deliver materials to the front of the house. In the end, I figured that the easiest way to get the 8 tons of dry concrete mix into the basement would be to poke it through the wall with a stick.

[Poking 8 ton of gravel\/sand mix through a pipe takes some time.](https://preview.redd.it/0cwk6h8dacxd1.png?width=2832&format=png&auto=webp&s=75e0cbd7d850c5ce4af30682ac9b170090f7a2f0)

Every morning, I just cracked out a podcast and shovelled and poked for an hour or so. To do the concrete slab for the outside area and the internal floor took about 10 days. This was really tiring and I *had* to take a couple of days off to recover afterwards.

[80&#37; done with pouring the new slab](https://preview.redd.it/cayi5hrpybxd1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4778a80e13f23a5341d88cab8ddd38f42a139198)

Below is a picture of the underfloor heating being installed (electric) and also of the rather nice view the room looks out on.

https://preview.redd.it/125o579hacxd1.png?width=2840&format=png&auto=webp&s=36bdde43ac06d5e31919a4c606167e455b7d32cf

What made this project *much* faster to complete is that I was tacking the build on to all the pre-existing systems. The HVAC system had enough ports to cover the basement rooms, I separated my MCU by floor - so working without affecting the rest of the house was easy - and it was relatively easy to extend my water system from the upper floors (there were only a few things I could have better thought ahead for in my first build).

[Dry-wall, conduit and radiators installed.](https://preview.redd.it/c0mkop4izbxd1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=117900756d14b9ce403d7d1348710b9923972250)

I installed a false ceiling using thin batons and cladding. This was pretty tedious to do, but it allowed me to hide the HVAC pipes and other conduit. Luckily the beams were deep enough for the final result to still look good (i.e. enough depth on the remaining visible beam).

[Installing false ceiling.](https://preview.redd.it/1x04xmkkacxd1.png?width=2434&format=png&auto=webp&s=301ebb2ecb6c9b1dfd02965d4834a8cc79e6fe46)

**The Bathroom**

The bathroom is fairly compact, but more than enough for a guest apartment. I built the sink unit around an idea draw unit (using some kitchen top off-cuts I had from a van conversion). The backsplash is pine cladding with Rustoleum midnight blue chalk paint. It is a great colour.

https://preview.redd.it/bb4m9vynacxd1.png?width=2854&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6f61163b760f79ea783145a6ef6e2644c838810

The macerator pump sits behind the toilet (on the other side of the wall - contrary to installation instructions) but it is very easily accessible with the space under the stairs.

https://preview.redd.it/lbuxzt6qacxd1.png?width=2840&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e3c55828bdcd5d56c56340a38fae05b72b24c3c

As the basement is below the height of the main sewer outlet, I had to put it all through a macerator pump. Largely, this has been fine and is not very noisy.

**The Bedroom**

The bedroom, is 3.5 x 3m so it is a snug room (work with what you got) but it makes a pretty fine double room for guests. I put a big reclaimed window in for light - this takes up the entire room width - and with the large window in the living room it works pretty well. Unfortunately, there is no way to put a window in any of the bedroom walls as they either face underneath the barn (behind the headboard) or into a room under the balcony (left).

https://preview.redd.it/hr41fw8sacxd1.png?width=2876&format=png&auto=webp&s=2cfdfc155eb64e235c5c8d846160fea55b467c4e

Below you can see the window, the right hand side opens if required.

https://preview.redd.it/81velfdm3cxd1.png?width=2860&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8bbb86a1daa1feff3021c58759c394d8f4229eb

**Outside/Patio area**  
Before, the outside area was a few steps of endlessly crumbly dusty concrete.

https://preview.redd.it/9k9622g03cxd1.png?width=2684&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e1e5b5ef8ee4c996eaaa31df74e5eeede22596c

After, the patio is a nice place to have a coffee in the morning. It also ties the single bedroom in the balcony (door on left) with the rest of the house). I also fitted a new front door (the old one was very, very, draughty).

[I used a bit of an old 1000l wine barrel to make the wooden step surface. The tiles match the balcony on the 1st floor.](https://preview.redd.it/i0tzxmcw2cxd1.png?width=2658&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca90aeb9b2fc97e9651eaa9f43f444874e051fa4)

**The Store Room**

Nothing very clever here - it is a store room. However, I did not plaster in the dry-wall (I just painted it) so that if I wanted I could install a small kitchen here and turn the entire floor into a self-contained apartment. This would simply mean unscrewing a few dry-wall panels, connect waste plumbing (this runs through here from the upstairs kitchen anyway). Then, run a couple of cables for the hob, and put in some kitchen furniture, and it is good to go. It is not in my 'life plan' to rent parts of the house out - but having the option to do so seems sensible!

[An exciting store room.](https://preview.redd.it/z2p4sfr24cxd1.png?width=2818&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc3609aca4578ca6dc5986d62891d19cecf6b0e5)

I have published a [short video about the entire process here](https://youtu.be/EzbD5wh-UfU?si=IrHgQtsD67Jzf3f7) (sorry if you hate drum & base, it just works so well with this sort of film!).

**Key lessons**

* There is not much flexibility with the macerator pump installation instructions in terms of 'fall' from the bath/shower. I trimmed an inch off it to keep the bath head space, the last bit drains very slowly now. If it gets too annoying I can put the pump an inch lower.
* Underfloor heating makes getting big tiles flat. Just a pain in the ass.
* Tile wedge system (first time I used it) is pretty good, but the 0.5mm spacers are quite fragile so better 1mm or up.
* I hate machine-cutting large hard ceramic tiles.
* Installing HVAC in the first build was really worth it.
* Nail Gun (electric dwalt brad nailer) worth its weight in gold. Simiarly, an oscillating saw saves a lot of time - especially when it comes to 'fine tuning' dry-wall.
* Laser Level - I did not have one for my previous build (plumb line) - but it makes life a hell of a lot easier. Worth the $$$.
* And, the best bit about building work is when you get to stop!

1gdh6ue,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gdh6ue/eye_twitch_for_over_a_year/,Eye twitch for over a year…,"Hello, I’m 34f.  My left eye has been twitching for more than a year and today my right eye has started twitching also. I have a routine doctor’s appointment in January, but I’m concerned this might be something a bit more urgent. 

I went to an optometrist last year, to see about the twitch in my left eye. They were not concerned and I was actually diagnosed with Keratoconus around that time. So I was sidetracked by the treatment for that, and have not been able to address the twitching since.  Now, my right eye is twitching and I’m freaking out a little. 

I have panic disorder/anxiety, a pretty stressful job, and I never sleep well. I don’t drink coffee or caffeinated teas. The twitching has not gotten worse, aside from the fact that it’s both eyes now. My left eye has been consistently twitching everyday, several times a day, for a few seconds at a time, since September of last year. Right eye twitching started today—both in my top eyelids. 

I’m prone to overreacting when it comes to medical stuff and I’m hoping this can wait until I see my primary doctor in January. 

Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you. ",1,1730052467.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Hello, 25F and 38M bf

First reddit post, I am very nervous this.
I'm adhd so sorry if my writing is muddled up!
&sorry for negative vibes.

Can people who stay together for the kids be happy? What would you do? Is it possible to live in a way that you don't want/need until the children are grown? So that our babies have both parents in the same household? 

Does split up parents harm the child more than pretending happy families? The studies that have been done about fatherless children are heartbreaking and devastating. 

I always have and always will want the best for my baby, but how long do you let yourself be mentally/emotionally/physically/sexually tortured? Our kids come first, right? So does that mean doing what you know is best for mum or doing what studies say is best for the child? It's like either way you're f**ked.

I spent years, felt like my whole life, all my sanity and tears, begging my child's dad to step up&be a dad (he begged for abortion&destroyed my reputation with friends and family) while trying to convincing me to abort our baby.
I'm serious when I say if I told him I would of if he licked shit off my shoe, he would have.

I was young alone and felt the most intense pressure i ever had at that point, until of course i became a mother. I booked for an abortion twice, I just couldn't do it. I understood that I would be doing this alone and that he didn't want another baby (he has one from previous partner)  I spent my pregnancy, birth&her first 2.5 years, bringing her up mostly alone (her dad had seen her a few times as we were on and off alot and he wasnt priorising seeing her) which was tough&carrying the mental load of parenting alone was terrifying. However, we (me&baby) were learning, growing together, and happy, it was the purest, most loving period of time I have ever encountered in my life.

Bf has been homeless for about 1.5 years. 
He has been living with us since - I was told if I didn't help him for 6 months (with housing situation) he won't bother with our child (being a young, nieve and genuine female is rough) - obviously I agreed, being blind as hell and scared - my baby needs her dad - but now I see it all, that was coercive. It's been really hard, he has been helpful since moving in, but the bad times are low, and I can't help but feel taken advantage of. It's been a whole year over the time frame. I said I'd help him, and he has no one else, so I'm trapped. I can not kick him out on the streets.
I was 19 when we met, and my brain has definitely matured since, and I'm seeing a lot of problems arise now.

Our child is 4 now...he's got a better bond with our child now and she's absolutely a daddy's girl, hes a good dad when mental health is going okay. However, my once mummy's girl is horrible to me, just me, actually abusive, our once tight bond is gone? I do what I can regularly to try and repair whatever has been broken, despite dissociating from the stress of it all often.

I just had to keep pushing, didnt i? I was terrified she was going to have a HUGE disadvantage being fatherless.

Bf 38m birthday was a couple of weeks ago. I wanted to make him feel special, so I did what I thought he would have loved for his special day, considering i asked him days before his birthday what he would like and how he would like his day to go, making suggestions and things. However, I didn't get one response or idea out of him.

I spent the night prior making a cake for him, making sure his gifts and cards were wrapped and everything was ready. I was super excited to give him a great birthday. 

The morning of his birthday, I let him sleep in, while I got our baby to nursery and put up balloons and banners. I nearly forgot to prep his morning coffee, I didn't, though! His coffee was there for when he woke up....not as if it had made a difference. 

I was making the icing for this cake when he woke and came downstairs. I said happy birthday and asked how he was, he looked at the balloons and banners and said ""thank you, nobody has ever done that for me before"", then things blew up!! He started shouting and moaning and slamming things, I was confused as hell. In his solo scream match he said a few things for example:
•I didn't confront him the way he wanted.
•he didn't ask for the balloons and banners.
•I made him a cake he didn't want or ask for.
•I didn't wake him up in the morning for our daughter to say happy birthday.
•'fuck your stupid gifts, I don't want them, bin them'
•I was suppose to of planned a walk, so he was angry about that (although I didn't know I was suppose to plan anything because I got stonewalled when I asked to begin with) - according to him 'I should just know'.

I was hurt, I kept quiet, i got his bag off presents, put them on the side just in case he changed his mind, and he did want them.. but.. he just blew up more, he didn't want them.
Mistake on my part but didn't think much of it since he was blowing up anyway, I thought it was half decent gesture - obviously, my lack of social skills..

After that I pretty much kept to myself. I didn't even want to put in the effort for the rest of his day, after constant criticism, I thought, there ain't no way. That's seriously disrespecting myself.

There's alot more too this obviously but I'm trying to make this post as short as I can, believe it or not.

It went on for days.

He told me he didn't want his gift and card from our daughter when she came back home from nursery, so of course, I didn't tell her to give them to him, can you imagine if I did? Ffs.

He spent his birthday avoiding both me and his daughter.

Next day it carried on and not sure what time this had been but he had left in his car to ""go k*ll himself because I'm horrible, ruin everything and his birthday&make him want to die"".
I left him to it and left a key out. (This is usual behaviour, so I wasn't worried)

I woke up to him returning 7am the next morning to start the arguments and shouting ALL OVER AGAIN FOR HOURS. 

Next 2 or 3 days after that he was begging for his birthday to be repeated - a nearly 40 year old man after acting like that, I ruined his birthday, made it shit because I tried and now he wanted a restart of his birthday? - I refuse to have my character and efforts trash like that. Every occasion, I try so hard, and I know there's going to be a massive argument because I do something wrong.

My confidence has gone 100-0.

Fast forward, it's been more than a week, and he hasn't opened any of his gifts or cards (even from our 4yo)

There's always so much more to the story, I'm an asshole too. I personally have been in therapy for 6 years now but i do feel more confident in my judgment.. but also, i need to figure out where im going wrong. 

I still can't help but think of the 30+ year relationships, they're not perfect? They stay strong after they go through horrific things right? 

Now, I feel like I may have made the worst mistake while believing I was doing the right thing.

 I feel like a terrible mother if spent all this time to maintain a relationship to then basically break it? It's not in my right to do that. 
The pain I'm enduring shouldn't mean my baby has to go without the most ""fun"" person in her life.

My child came up to me the other day randomly and said 'mummy you stole daddy's birthday'
I CANT, I explained to her I tried to make it a lovely day, in the best way you can to a 4 yo.

I would never stop my child seeing her dad, but he probably would if we wernt living as a ""family"" in the same house.

I love my bf, but I feel as though this isn't the best path for us anymore, we don't thrive in eachothers presence like we use to and I'm not sure if it's best for our baby either..

What have I learnt from this? I have been super dumb&be careful what you wish for - you might just get it.

Am being immature? Or acting in a way that's immature toward relationships?

Thank you and sorry for the negative bullcrap.

Maybe I should start journalling? Lmao

1gdh2zj,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gdh2zj/confused_should_i_express_my_feelings_to_my_crush/,Confused: Should I express my feelings to my crush?,"This probably is my first post on Reddit so please bear with me, and I apologize in advance if I overshare.

a bit of backstory: I (m,24) moved to a european country from asia for my studies about 6 months ago, and started working in a restaurant's kitchen for a part-time job. Recently the restaurant laid-off 5 employees (inc. me) and replaced us with trainees leading to full time jobs.  
I had a crush on one of the service-staff girls, although, I never intentionally indicated that to her.  
After about 2 weeks of getting laid-off, I texted her, (lets call her ´´R´´), and asked her for hanging out and coffee. She agreed and we scheduled and went out and had coffee and sat and talked to a few hours, and then we headed our ways.  
I did not indicate any romantic interest because while we were talking she told me 2 stories of her rejecting 2 different guys who asked her out and one of them being an employee at her previous place of work after she left that place. She said that she enjoyed her time with him and used to hang out with him after work as well but wasn't interested in him.  
While we said our goodbyes, she said that she enjoyed it and would like to hangout again.

Today I texted her and asked for a casual stroll, she replied that she is not available today but is free on xyz days next week and we can plan then if I am free on any of those days as well.

Now, I am confused. I haven´t been with anyone in at least 5 years and my first/last relationship was also only 3 months (so i'm not even sure if it counts as a relationship) and i was stuck in a ´situationship´ (no physical intimacy involved, I had a crush on the girl, she was a new friend and once we got a bit comfortable with each other, I expressed my feelings, she neither properly denied, nor accepted and kept me around) for about 1.5 years and only got out of it when I was moving out of my country 6-7 months ago.  
Should I not express my feelings towards her and keep her around as a friend because I am also in a strong need of friends. Or should I express my feelings with a huge chance of being rejected just like she told about her previous experiences?

I use an IQOS heat not burn machine, not the traditional cigs though, so the smoke is not the problem.

I used to drink 2 cups of coffee a day. But after multiple GERD incidents that lead me to being hospitalized, I decided to drink 1 cup a day and smoking as a replacement.

I have a highly stressed life that if I did couple of mistakes, it would lead to depression. And smoking really help me went through those moments. Since I have to be responsible for not only my happiness, but also the family (have 2 kids with ADHD, and 1 woman-child).

I even have to be responsible for wife’s emotional state. Which swing real fast tonight, it went from: “Go have your dinner first,” to “Why I am married to a smoker now?” In a condescending tone.

It hurts. I decided not to communicate my feelings because it’s pointless.

I understand the need to take care of 2 ADHD kids are stressful, but I have 2 nannies at home and 1 personal helper. At this economy, who wouldn’t be stressed?! Even paying for them already took half of my monthly income.

Yes smoking will make me poorer, but it makes me function better. Amazingly. Somehow I understand why people smoke after smoking. Especially those with demanding jobs like sales or those living in a demanding environment.

P.S. I smoke a pack of Terea a day. But I have been decreasing it to a pack every 2 days. Planning on decreasing even more until a pack a week.",2,1730052158.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

The dill pickle serrano is what you’d expect. A huge burst of dill, not much heat. Great on everything if you like pickles.

Fermented kimchi is a really versatile sauce with the heat coming from gochujang and Thai chilis. It has the funkiness of a fermented sauce along with the almost tropical sweetness you get from Calabrian chilis while being pretty acidic and bright.

The Queen Majesty is a little mysterious. It’s not too hot. Coffee, onions, garlic, and ginger gives it a pretty unique, mildly sweet flavor. I like it, but not sure what it goes well with just yet. Oddly I’m thinking mapo tofu?

Zuzu’s 7-pot is the spiciest of the batch and I was a little worried that’s all it would have going for it, but the sambuca and fennel flavors really come though, making it a little bitter and pretty bright. Looking forward to trying it with pork or mediterranean dishes. ",1,1730052142.0,hotsauce,0,1.0,False

I have the same issue. and everything in your pictures is identical,down to the rusted boiler attachment.

i have replaced the part Aye\_don\_care mentioned below, but now it is obvious that the seals on the valve stem this part sits on are bad. I cannot find so much as a part number. the diagrams for the ec270 have the seals listed, but I cannot be sure it is the same valve stem.

for the EC270 i can find the valve stem itself and it has the seals already in place, but again, i cannot be sure it will fit the boiler or this valve switch. the bottom plate looks concave in the pictures.

Any advice would be nice. This is a seriously great system for the price. but for an o-ring and a clear plastic seal

I made a great image but cannot add it for some reason.

1gdh0yt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gdh0yt,I’m kind of an asshole. 😅I don’t want to be the asshole anymore🥲 Am I actually the asshole tho?🫣,"Some context: I have two roommates. K is the roommate I’m having problems with. K let me and Julia move into her childhood home after her parents moved out of state. However, I have furnished the house common spaces (all the chairs and tables and couches are mine) Rent is pretty cheap for a three bedroom three bathroom house. However each of us have cats. So three cats total. Julia has her cat in her room. My cat chose the office since the rooms are so close together and she and Julia’s cat don’t get along. K’s cat walks around freely because he’s used to the house already. 

Issues: 
Cat care: I pay rent and utilities and signed a lease to live there and put down a pet deposit. But I don’t live there. I live with my boyfriend in a one bedroom apartment. My boyfriend is super allergic to cats and had a small dog. I’ve debated just bringing my cat to live in this one bedroom but it would be crowded and we’d have to separate the dog and the cat in a one bedroom apartment. So I go back and forth every other day to check on her clean her litter box, make sure she has food and water, give her some medication incase she needs it because she is 15 and getting old. I love this cat a lot and the fact I’m not there every single day to see how she is does make me extremely sad and feel like a bad mom. My boyfriend and I have talked about getting a two bedroom so she can come live with us.

Halloween party: essentially what happened was my friend MJ and I wanted to throw a joint birthday party again this time it was my turn to have it at my house. We went all out decorating. Different rooms had different horror movie themes. For example Carrie was in the dining room where we made fake blood with cocoa powder red dye and corn syrup and covered the tarped out walls. Or the well we made out of some bricks from the backyard for the Ring themed living room. The party guests however I had little to no say in because MJ felt it was easiest to invite the people she was friends with considering our friend groups are pretty much the same people. Then of course I told Julia and K to invite whoever they wanted. K ended up inviting 6-7 people and MJ ended up inviting over 20 people. However I invited only 2 other people. I ended up leaving because none of the people who were invited even knew it was my birthday after 12 or wished me a happy birthday. By no fault of there’s however because no one at that party really knew me or knew it was my birthday. So once my boyfriend got there we left. But before leaving my house full of strangers I told MJ I would come for her if she didn’t shut the party down when K asked. MJ ended up passing out for a second and K had to kick out some of MJs friends. I told K she didn’t have to lift a finger and I could go and kick everyone out but she said it was fine and they left. The next day my boyfriend and I went back and cleaned the whole house. Julia and I were debating throwing a Halloween party at the end of the month. So when K texted me asking me to get rid of the brick well in the living room I asked if we could please just leave it for the month of October and use it as a coffee table till Julia and I were sure we wouldn’t have another Halloween party. K also informed me that cocoa powder attracts bugs so the tarp wall in the dinning room had to go. I agreed to take down the tarps and came the very next morning. I found the well bricks had been put back in the backyard and the tarps had been taken down. So essentially K did it herself without telling me she would do it the same day she told me, and by herself. That was honestly ok with me, I would’ve felt better if she had just said something and let me do it myself like I said I was and intended to do.

Safety: 
We live in the nice part of town where many families have family homes and kids. We live on one of the outskirts of the main city yet it’s still well populated with other homes and is definitely a suburb neighborhood vibe. The house has two cameras, one facing the front door way and the street and the other facing the garage, yard gate, road and driveway. The windows stay locked usually. Julia left the garage open on accident once and K kinda freaked out but K constantly leaves the front door unlocked. Julia also spends a lot of time with her boyfriend and stays the night at his house often aswell. her cat stays at the house too because her boyfriend has a large dog however we have a gate keeping her cat only in her room because the cat doesn’t get along with the other cats. K often opens the gate and  will just leave the house sometimes. Julia is really annoyed that she keeps opening the gate. 

The reason I don’t enjoy staying at the house is because my boyfriend is allergic to cats. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, K is also very messy, every time I’m over there to check on my cat there are dirty bras and underwear all over my living room couch, toe nail clippers and toe nail clippings on my coffee table along with half drank cups and dirty plates. It makes me really sad knowing the common areas and my stuff is being used and abused. K also uses my clothes and hair tools and sometimes doesn’t even ask me or let me know. I told her she could use what she wanted of my personal stuff if she just asked and she still struggles to ask. SO am I the asshole. I know I am for not having my cat with me all the time. And not staying to shut down what was supposed to be my birthday party. But what would you do in this situation? How would you respond? 

Essentially this situation is K needed to watch her brothers house that’s in the same city for 3 days and asked Julia in advance but Julia forgot and scheduled a camping trip with her boyfriend so K asked me to watch the house for three days where she specifically says you have to stay all the nights there. I’m having some crazy medical issues however.",1,1730052057.0,AmITheJerk,0,1.0,False

EQUIPMENT:

* kalita wave w/ branded paper filters
* timemore chestnut hand grinder
* fresh beans from local roasters in coffee shops (i'm in the PNW not far above sea level) (i always ask for the darkest roast they have)
* regular stovetop kettle (hario bueno coming in tomorrow)
* inexpensive Ikea metal spoons

i go from the center of the grounds to the edge, then gently splash the grounds on the sides down and try to get the grounds to settle flat.

MORE DETAILS:

i have been trying to get good at brewing a pourover based on technique, rather than equipment; i feel it is best to develop technique first, rather than rely on expensive objects.  i do not yet have a scale (future luxury purchase bc i'm poor), and simply fill my grinder up to the top. i often brew a 16 oz in the morning before work, but this happens with my 8 oz ones on the weekend, too. i add cream and monkfruit sweetener w/ erythritol. when i was in CA (higher elevation) and using a French press, my coffee would come out AMAZING pretty consistently, and taste great with cream and sweetener. however, the French press is too difficult to clean for my daily use, and i prefer the quick cleanup of a pourover. it's also fun to work on a skill. after watching James Hoffman's beginner series, i now ask for the darkest roast at shops.

here are my ideas of what's going wrong (but idk i need helpppp):

* too many or too few beans
* kettle can't get water hot enough/boiling point is somehow low
* metal spoons reacting with coffee
* air bubbles coming up when brewing are doing something weird
* i'm a hater

Worked in retail? You’re hired. Worked at a fast food place? Perfect, you’ll do great in a fast paced environment. As long as you know how to talk to a customer everything else will be taught on the job. 

You don’t need an at home machine and photos of latte art to prove you’re capable. As a manger I have never once requested someone to make a drink to prove they know what they’re doing. You’ll get trained! Every cafe has different recipes and ways of doing things.

Basically my point is don’t worry! At the end of the day it’s just coffee and if you really want to get into the industry go for it! Just be prepared it’s not ALL about coffee, it’s much more customer service than anything else.",3,1730051341.0,barista,1,0.8,False

I'm exploring the possibility of opening an expat-focused bar here in the city and I'd love to get your input.

**My main question is: would you be interested in a bar that caters specifically to expats?**

I'm envisioning a place where we can:

* **Connect with other expats:** Share experiences, make new friends, and build a community.
* **Enjoy familiar comforts:** Think about things like sports from back home, favorite international beers, and maybe even some comfort food.
* **Escape the language barrier (sometimes):** A place where English is readily spoken and understood.
* **Find a flexible space:** Open during the day for casual business meetings or coworking, and transitioning into a social bar atmosphere in the evenings.

**To help me gauge interest and shape the concept, I'd love your feedback on:**

* **Opening Hours:** Would you be interested in a place that's open during the day for coffee/tea and potentially light meals, or would you prefer an evening-only focus?
* **Sports:** Are you craving watching football (soccer), rugby, cricket, or other sports from your home country?
* **Drinks:** What are your go-to beers, cocktails, or spirits that you miss from home? Would you be interested in international craft beer options?
* **Food:** What kind of food would you like to see on the menu? Are you missing pub grub, American classics, or something else entirely?
* **Business Meeting Needs:** If the space was open during the day, would you utilize it for casual business meetings? What amenities would be important to you (e.g., reliable Wi-Fi, quiet areas, printing services)?
* **Atmosphere:** What kind of vibe are you looking for? Relaxed and social? Lively and energetic? Something else?

**Any other thoughts or suggestions are welcome!**

I truly believe there's a need for a place like this in Asunción, and I'm excited to hear what you think. Let's create a great space for expats to connect, work, and feel at home!

I (54F) just moved to a new city last month. The vibe here is a little different than my old city but it’s the same region of the country so not a drastic change. Last night I was hanging out with a friend (61M) who’s lived here a long time and it came up in conversation that we both needed to make a trip to the grocery store. We decided to go together. I only needed a few essentials but I saw they had some good looking fingerling potatoes, so I bagged some up and headed to meet him at the register. When he saw the potatoes, he told me I had to go back to the produce section, weigh them, and print out a tag. I said, No the cashier can just put the code in. Like every other grocery store I’ve ever been to or worked at. He started getting visibly agitated and insisted the cashier was going to kick me out of line and make me go back to weigh them. I said It will be ok. And of course it was, she looked at the little book for maybe five seconds, put in the code, and that was that. Afterwards, he said I embarrassed him and upset the cashier by not doing it the correct way. I mean I could get it if it was coffee or pastries or something she couldn’t just look at and see what it was, but produce in a clear bag? That’s a routine part of her job. And she sure didn’t look upset to me. This seems incredibly overblown and petty, but maybe I’m a hick unfit for big city society. AITA? ",4,1730051207.0,AmItheAsshole,10,1.0,False

Absolutely needs a caregiver. I can’t keep doing this. ","Alright some quick context: I was sent here (room and board apartment complex) from the hospital. I was told the room and board was independent living. I had my own apartment for almost a month, then I got a roommate. He’s schizophrenic (had no trouble with that so far) epileptic, and type one diabetic. I also have epilepsy so seizures are child’s play to me, I know how to deal with them, and when it’s an emergency.


Alright, FF a bit. He’s been my roommate for maybe 6-7 weeks. Within this period of time I’ve had to call 911 3 times. We also have a landlord that forbids calling 911 without permission. Yes I know that’s illegal, but it’s a room and board in Detroit, it’s all a verbal agreement. I have technically no tenant rights to fall back on. 

First 911 call: I thought he was having a heart attack. He could barely breathe and said it felt like someone was sitting on his chest. I called 911 immediately. Paramedics drove AWAY with him with lights and sirens on. Turned out to be diabetic keto acidosis. His blood sugar was 497. He almost never tests his blood sugar, and eats almost exclusively carbs. 


Second time, he had 3 seizures in a row, in the space of about 10 minutes. He doesn’t take his medication. If it was just one seizure without any injuries, I would not have called emergency services. As soon as I saw he was having a seizure, I basically jumped over the coffee table and put him on the floor on his side. Can’t fall any further from the floor. (I’m 6”5/215 and he’s like 5”3/170 so it was easy lol)


Third time, he woke up and couldn’t walk because he couldn’t feel his legs. I tested his blood sugar and it was 389. I gave him some insulin, he rested a bit and I tested again about an hour later, it was 208. Certainly not good, but a lot better. And he could feel his legs again. However, he could not walk. His balance was completely gone. Eventually I called 911 again. 

There is SO much more to the story, some of it involving him, some involving my landlord, some both. Suffice it to say, I’m at my wits end. This man needs a caretaker, and I am not qualified. ",3,1730051154.0,badroommates,4,1.0,False

Internet instead of leisure, has  become shackles, bingeing isnt joyful thing, just makes me feel empty.

Thus dat one day gap turns to week, I give up.

If im exercising  at 4pm today , i should be responsible enough to workout at same time tomorrow. But I procrastinate, instead of , working out imnediately at 4pm.

Its only after 20 mins of exercise body starts losing fat, so i need to at do 45 to 60 mins workout everyday , but im not even moving around nowadays.
Plus ik having a gap of more than 48hrs between each session means i will need to increase the intensity of next workout, yet I just dont want to exert myself whether its exercise, studies or even for my own life.

1gdgmyu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gdgmyu,I’m kind of an asshole. 😅I don’t want to be the asshole anymore🥲 Am I actually the asshole tho?🫣,"Some context: I have two roommates. K is the roommate I’m having problems with. K let me and Julia move into her childhood home after her parents moved out of state. However, I have furnished the house common spaces (all the chairs and tables and couches are mine) Rent is pretty cheap for a three bedroom three bathroom house. However each of us have cats. So three cats total. Julia has her cat in her room. My cat chose the office since the rooms are so close together and she and Julia’s cat don’t get along. K’s cat walks around freely because he’s used to the house already. 

Issues: 
Cat care: I pay rent and utilities and signed a lease to live there and put down a pet deposit. But I don’t live there. I live with my boyfriend in a one bedroom apartment. My boyfriend is super allergic to cats and had a small dog. I’ve debated just bringing my cat to live in this one bedroom but it would be crowded and we’d have to separate the dog and the cat in a one bedroom apartment. So I go back and forth every other day to check on her clean her litter box, make sure she has food and water, give her some medication incase she needs it because she is 15 and getting old. I love this cat a lot and the fact I’m not there every single day to see how she is does make me extremely sad and feel like a bad mom. My boyfriend and I have talked about getting a two bedroom so she can come live with us.

Halloween party: essentially what happened was my friend MJ and I wanted to throw a joint birthday party again this time it was my turn to have it at my house. We went all out decorating. Different rooms had different horror movie themes. For example Carrie was in the dining room where we made fake blood with cocoa powder red dye and corn syrup and covered the tarped out walls. Or the well we made out of some bricks from the backyard for the Ring themed living room. The party guests however I had little to no say in because MJ felt it was easiest to invite the people she was friends with considering our friend groups are pretty much the same people. Then of course I told Julia and K to invite whoever they wanted. K ended up inviting 6-7 people and MJ ended up inviting over 20 people. However I invited only 2 other people. I ended up leaving because none of the people who were invited even knew it was my birthday after 12 or wished me a happy birthday. By no fault of there’s however because no one at that party really knew me or knew it was my birthday. So once my boyfriend got there we left. But before leaving my house full of strangers I told MJ I would come for her if she didn’t shut the party down when K asked. MJ ended up passing out for a second and K had to kick out some of MJs friends. I told K she didn’t have to lift a finger and I could go and kick everyone out but she said it was fine and they left. The next day my boyfriend and I went back and cleaned the whole house. Julia and I were debating throwing a Halloween party at the end of the month. So when K texted me asking me to get rid of the brick well in the living room I asked if we could please just leave it for the month of October and use it as a coffee table till Julia and I were sure we wouldn’t have another Halloween party. K also informed me that cocoa powder attracts bugs so the tarp wall in the dinning room had to go. I agreed to take down the tarps and came the very next morning. I found the well bricks had been put back in the backyard and the tarps had been taken down. So essentially K did it herself without telling me she would do it the same day she told me, and by herself. That was honestly ok with me, I would’ve felt better if she had just said something and let me do it myself like I said I was and intended to do.

Safety: 
We live in the nice part of town where many families have family homes and kids. We live on one of the outskirts of the main city yet it’s still well populated with other homes and is definitely a suburb neighborhood vibe. The house has two cameras, one facing the front door way and the street and the other facing the garage, yard gate, road and driveway. The windows stay locked usually. Julia left the garage open on accident once and K kinda freaked out but K constantly leaves the front door unlocked. Julia also spends a lot of time with her boyfriend and stays the night at his house often aswell. her cat stays at the house too because her boyfriend has a large dog however we have a gate keeping her cat only in her room because the cat doesn’t get along with the other cats. K often opens the gate and  will just leave the house sometimes. Julia is really annoyed that she keeps opening the gate. 

The reason I don’t enjoy staying at the house is because my boyfriend is allergic to cats. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, K is also very messy, every time I’m over there to check on my cat there are dirty bras and underwear all over my living room couch, toe nail clippers and toe nail clippings on my coffee table along with half drank cups and dirty plates. It makes me really sad knowing the common areas and my stuff is being used and abused. K also uses my clothes and hair tools and sometimes doesn’t even ask me or let me know. I told her she could use what she wanted of my personal stuff if she just asked and she still struggles to ask. SO am I the asshole. I know I am for not having my cat with me all the time. And not staying to shut down what was supposed to be my birthday party. But what would you do in this situation? How would you respond? ",3,1730051040.0,roommateproblems,1,1.0,False

And this might be a stupid question, but I've been wondering about this for a while now. I'd just like to hear other people's opinions.

(For a little bit of context, I'm a woman, and we live in Europe.)

So I've known this guy for about a year, and I'd say we're pretty close friends. He's been to my apartment for coffee a few times, and we've talked for literal hours. We also went bar hopping once, until about 4 AM, and we had an amazing time. In the beginning of the year, after we did our Spanish test together (we're both in university, in the same year), we got lunch and I mentioned something about having a gaming PC. He then offered to give me his old monitor that he had ""lying around"" for basically free, since he only asked for a package of ground coffee in return. I insisted on paying him for it, and he refused, and he even came to my apartment to set it up for me, which I didn't ask him to do, and again stayed for hours afterwards just talking. We've also been out with mutual friends in bars, and he usually sits next to me, with our legs touching.

But the thing is, he's never really made a move towards me, at least not an obvious one. I feel like men are usually pretty forward about these things? I have caught him staring at me a few times, long eye-contact and things like that, but that's pretty much it. We've been alone plenty of times, and I feel like he's had the chance to say something if he wanted to.

I think it might have something to do with our age gap. I'm 21, and he's 28, but like I said, we're in the same year in university. I'm just not sure if he sees me in a romantic way, or if I'm just a friend to him. I do really like him, and if he asked me out, I would say yes, although I think the age gap might be a bit too big at this stage in my life. He's just a genuinely amazing guy, talking to him is so easy, and I feel very comfortable with him. He's 100% my type physically, but if he wants to be just friends, that's fine with me too. Since the new courses started, I have no classes with him, and I miss him a little since we don't see eachother nearly as much.

Some brief context: I am a bit of an artist (or at least I try) and am currently painting the windows next to a friend's front door in a Halloween theme so that she has a little more privacy when people are at the front door. This is my 3rd day on this project, almost done.

Okay, here goes. So to start I am of fully sound mind. It is 10:32 am as I write this and it happened about 5 minutes ago. I have only had a small breakfast and one cup of coffee. I only say this to speak to my level headedness and awareness. I am now at my friend's house trying to wrap up my painting.

I dip my paintbrush into more paint and go to apply it to the window. There was a heavy amount of paint on the brush and as the brush makes contact with the window a chickpea sized glob of navy blue paint drops. As I watch the drop leave the paintbrush it is like everything slows down in slow motion and I have the time to think to myself ""oh, sh**, I'll have to clean this up"". I look down to the concrete floors and there is no splat of paint to be found.

I inspect the surrounding floor, my own self, the window pane that I was painting, my chair.. I inspect every possible surface that this drop of paint could have conceivably and inconceivably landed on and it is nowhere to be found. After my search was ended with inconclusive results I said to myself, ""neat"", and came here to share. Excited to see what you all think!

- Avatar: The Last Airbender (animated series only)

- Naruto (manga only, preferably before the timeskip in volume 72, NO Boruto)

- Harry Potter (books only, before the epilogue)

- Detroit: Become Human

- Star Trek the Kelvin timeline (need time to re-acquaint myself with it though, I’m a bit rusty)

- A little about Marvel Cinematic Universe (preferably regarding Spider-Man, or Loki pre - Infinity War)

- Across The Spider Verse (animated movie)


Sites: ao3, fanfiction . net (preferred site: ao3)

Spoilers ok?:
for A:tlA I have seen the original animated series and read some of the comics, but I’m more versed with the animated series alone,
I won’t engage with anything beyond chapter 699 of Naruto, nor with anything pertaining the movies or the epilogue of the Harry Potter saga,
for Detroit: Become Human you can talk about anything,
Star Trek the Kelvin timeline as I said before I’m rusty and limited to the three movies, I’ve read some tie in material but don’t remember much,
about the MCU I’m kinda behind, I’ve almost given up keeping up after Endgame, (I’ve seen both series of Loki and the Hawkeye one tho, but I feel more confident with stuff involving Loki pre: Infinity War or about Spider-Man),
about Across the Spider Verse well I’ve seen the movie (and the previous one, Into the Spider Verse) and that’s it.

Preferred tropes/fic genres:
- Action/Adventure,
- Angst,
- Darkfic,
- Family fic
- Fluff,
- Friendship,

- RPF (can’t feel comfortable thinking about real people, sorry, my bad)

- Coffee shop/Flower shop/High School/University/College AU ((willing to negotiate on this bit))

- Anything regarding pissing/soiling oneself or others (so omorashi golden showers, piss drinking, coprophagy, everything else you can think of, I’m unable, sorry) (((if the mention of soiling/pissing is a minor happenstance for the sake of plot and not treated as a kink I might be able to read about it…)))

- Crossovers (I can’t, sorry but I cannot)

- Character(s) Bashing

- Soulmates

- Reader Insert, Y/N, Second POV (OCs and Self Insert are more than fine instead)

- Mpreg


(If I remember something else I’ll add to the list)

Status: I prefer longfics (on-going or complete are both fine) but I’m open to one shots

Type of feedback I can provide: I hope I can help with grammar, surely with spelling, presumably with formatting, generally helping looking for plot holes or brainstorming ideas, information research about canon or real world things that can be useful, generally cheering up

1gdggzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gdggzh/my_relationship_feels_like_it_dwindling/,My Relationship feels like it dwindling.,"As of recently my relationship feels like it’s been dwindling. I feel like I’m the only who cares. I do believe a part of it has to be his parents and maybe friends mingling and him forgetting I’m his girlfriend not just his friend. 

We both have gotten new jobs and now only see each other weekends, limited to only Saturdays because he can’t miss football… I feel like I’ve been spiraling again, I go in and out of depression and try to get hold of it and have noticed that when I try to voice it and I can’t find the words my boyfriend just gets mad and irritated with me or tries to make a joke to alleviate the situation. I tell him that makes me feel bad and he just says IDK.

There’s been situations where he doesn’t want to do certain stuff or post certain pictures because he’s afraid to be teased by his friends. Which annoyed because why does he care. Usually when we’re alone he’s fine and caring (used to) but it just seem to be dwindling more and more.

But now that he has a job where he earns more than me when we go out for meals where the total is like 37 bucks he wants to split and I have to buy my own dessert or something, which is something he never did back when he didn’t even have that much money. I’m not against splitting the bill we used to always do it when it was a pretty pricey bill, but now he second thinks just getting me a coffee. This could factor in the fact that his dad is that way and maybe be telling him to???? I’m not sure anymore. When we go out to somewhere and there’s too much waiting time even to buy something needed he can’t do more than 5 minutes and would just leave telling me to meet him at the car. He’s just been so impatient with everything and I don’t think he even realizes until I get sad and the he begrudgingly stays. I want to be able to voice it to him but I can’t think of ways where he won’t just wipe it away like he has before. My mental health deteriorating lately definitely doesn’t help either. I love and care for him so much and the thought of breaking up hurts, but so does how I feel currently. Thank you for reading.",2,1730050611.0,dating,1,1.0,False

Beans, coffee-d ✅
Egg, over-easy ✅
Bread, toasted ✅

Pull out a butter knife and notice 2 tiny rust spots. 
Think to myself “I bought this butter knife set forever ago. I’ve bought like 2 small sets since these. I should just toss them and free up the space.”
Search my utensils drawer and pull out all remaining butter knives that came in that set. Identify small rust stains on other knives. Set all the knives next to eggshells and half-paper towel from breakfast (trash pile). Move breakfast plate and coffee to dining table. Go back and kitchen to grab trash. Throw away trash in garbage can.
Start eating. Notice all butter knives sitting out. Realize I meant to throw them away. 
Go to butter knives. Notice that one of the butter knives looks rust free. Pick it up and notice it actually has 1 tiny rust stain. Go into bathroom to throw it away. Look at the mirror in the bathroom. Wonder if I have any blackheads on my nose. Lean in and search for blackheads. Walk back into the kitchen. Notice I’m holding a bitter knife. While shaking my head disappointingly, grab all the butter knives and dispose of them.

1gdgfun,https://www.reddit.com/r/poetry_critics/comments/1gdgfun/a_little_poem_by_me/,A Little Poem by Me,"Being in love is so painful,

Especially when you know they don’t feel the same,

Suffocating and sorrowful.

He’s in love with someone else,

So beautifully and achingly in love.

He says he doesn’t love her anymore,

But he says he’ll never love someone so much again.


I asked my mama,

Her face veiled in pain,

She said, “Let him go. He’ll try to catch glimpses of her in everything.""

He’s in love with someone else,
 
And he’ll never love me the same.

I pray to God, “Please let him love me.”

I don’t know if it will work,

He’s already so broken and torn.


I catch him looking at me sometimes,

It makes me giddy inside,

Gives me a heart-wrenching hope;

Hope that crushes my fragmented soul into a thousand pieces.

I’m in love with someone, 

Cursed with watching him from afar, 

Cursed with care and unconditional affection,

Cursed with prayers for something I can never have.


I like hoping,

There’s nothing sweeter than an answered plea.

Hoping is a toxic thing.

I’m addicted, 

Cursed with wishing he'll feel the same. 


He's never gonna love me in the same way.

He's never gonna hold my hand and cry on my shoulder.

He's never gonna whisper ‘I love you’s with sunsets and first snows.

No roses painted with daffodils. 

No chocolates for when I'm sad.

No hugs, no dreams of a future, 

Because that's all there is to us,

Imaginations and fantasies I weave to hold my broken pieces together.

...

There isn't even an us.

There's just me,

Me and the him in my mind.

He's never gonna run to me cause he misses me.

He's never gonna sing sweet nothings to me in off pitch tones.

He's never gonna trust me and wipe away my tears.


My love is nothing but a sad poem,

Lost words between pages of old paper smelling of coffee and rain.

What it says on the tin really. 31M, just moved to Cheltenham and looking to meet new people/ go to some good social events. If anyone wants to grab a casual drink/ coffee just give me a bell. Stuff I'm looking for:

\- looking for a gym buddy. I'm signed up with JD gyms and am going to be really pushing the fitness hard. (Also looking for a sound diet plan, so if anyone's got any recommendations let me know).

\- Big into oldschool rock/ glam/ metal. Any good music venues/ live music events near here let me know! Also going to be learning the electric guitar, so if you're teaching, feel free to reach out with a rates card.

\- general socialising/ networking events - always down for those.

\- I do digital illustration as a hobby. If there are any art groups/ night classes/ etc I'd be keen to join. Would be interested in getting involved in the art scene proper, although I don't really know much about it.

\- Any theatre groups around here? Love acting (especially comedy) but haven't had the chance to do it in years.

\- Lastly, have a bit of a geeky side so if anyone's doing D&D or what have you I'd be down.

And just because it's the season, if anyone can recommend any Halloween parties that'd be awesome.

Well I was just on a bought of doing miralax everyday for about 2 months. It was okay but started to not work as well. Then all of the sudden I wanted to try a keto diet to kick sugar and carbs for a while to detox from junk foods and well I had diarrhea for a week straight pretty much and discontinued miralax because of it, I thought it was the keto diet which it could of been but being off the keto diet already I decided what was probably doing the thing of clearing me out the whole time:…
Allulose.
Allulose is a natural zero calorie sweetener derived from fruit I believe. Its known to have digestive issues for some people and well for me it clears me out, every time. I use it in my coffee now (coffee alone wasnt always enough to clear me out, even with miralax) since adding allulose instead of stevia or erithytol it makes the contractions and clearing out process so much easier. I swear allulose is a God send and can clear out even the most impacted bowels. But seriously will it work for you? Obviously that’s something youll have to see for yourself, but I think it’s worth trying. Its gotten me off of MiraLax because it honestly works better than all laxatives for me. Id also like to add ive only tried the allulose on an empty stomach in the morning for when I usually go to the bathroom so take that into account if you want to try it for best results.

1gdg8nh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nanny/comments/1gdg8nh/disheartened_and_disgusted_long_rant/,Disheartened and disgusted. Long rant.,"I started working with this family in 2019. I was hired on with the verbal promise of holidays paid. Yes, I'm the idiot with no contract..

A couple of years later I did receive a decent raise. But shortly after that I stopped getting paid for holidays. It happened around the same time they were remodeling their home and getting an in-ground pool installed. I never said anything.

Throughout this time I have become incredibly close with the kids, babysat for various extended family members and friends, ran errands for them, cooked, did light housekeeping, house and dog sat while they'd be on vacation... Was with them through covid (I only got paid half when I was off when they all had covid. When I later got covid I was paid nothing when I was out sick.)

The kids are older and involved in tons of activities so there is lots of driving. I have never been reimbursed for gas. During this time I've also had the exterior of my new car scratched and dented by the kids, and the upholstery torn on the inside.

Fast forward to this year. I saw the fewest hours ive ever had over the summer. MB was dropping the kids off at relatives houses to save a couple bucks on childcare. Midsummer I told her I need guaranteed hours and holidays paid. She said she never recalled paying my for holidays and that she was giving me a certain number of hours as a courtesy and she didn't even really need me for that many hours but she will still honor it.

At the end of the summer I told her I'm raising my hourly rate. I had received one raise during my five years of work and I'm not reimbursed for gas. I have nearly twenty years experience. My duties go beyond child care. Somethings gotta give.
She was disappointed and pretty much refused. I started job hunting with plans to leave my position.

She eventually said she could accommodate my raise with a drastic reduction in hours but also arranged for me to babysit for her niece one day a week and another family two days a week. I agreed to this schedule.

Since I was going to be having other children in my car going forward, I asked her about any possibility of being reimbursed for some damages to my vehicle. She said she would like to see quotes for the damage. I said OK, I will provide those to you.

The weekend passed and that following Monday she asked me to meet her at a local coffee shop. How weird we had to have a meeting outside of the home - something we've never done before. I met her and she opened the meeting by saying she will never accommodate another raise for me going forward. She proceded to scold me for not telling her children to be careful in my car. She said her children are respectful. She said normal wear and tear is what has happened to my car. She handed me $200 in an envelope and said this is all we are giving you. You can get it fixed or not. She said she is worried about having recommended me to her friends now. She basically treated me like a stranger who was scamming her for money. Not someone who has been loyal and devoted to her entire family for five years. 

To further punish me, she's also excluding me from an annual event one of the children participates in, that I've attended every year.

Now I'm in a horrible position because I love the new family she arranged for me to work for but I'm desperately wishing I could quit working for her.

Even when I went to coffee shops like La cabra, later to Kawa in Paris and many others Comandante was always in the shelves as their main hand grinder they sold. So this has  made so curious as to why comandante is so popular in Europe? Could it be that it has set the gold standard in the European coffee scene?

During NOLA N1, Taylor [debuted a new surprise song dress](https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/1gcnmql/new_orleans_n1_surprise_dress/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) that is [reminiscent of a supernova](https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/1gctc0s/new_surprise_song_dresses_karma_is_a_supernova/) however I believe it is also supposed to represent the fire that is going to burn this goddamn house to the ground.

[Strike a match, watch it burn](https://preview.redd.it/fky0r60gqbxd1.jpg?width=1504&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=36007e945c4c9d626e3582be36fe78c7d3ba0d89)

Not only has Taylor previously written two songs for the Hunger Games franchise, [""Eyes Open""](https://youtu.be/n3fnZBSnlgw?si=df2otu_W8ulukQEl) and [""Safe and Sound""](https://youtu.be/a5Icr9m8vbc?si=tbs8jFXM_lp4GBnx), she has seemingly been using the franchise as a framework to tell her own story.

# Why NOLA?

Do you remember the [video](https://youtu.be/ZcpGJTI5GsY?si=Va3S3y-ZCCQPghMt) that was made to announce that Taylor was Spotify Global Artist of the Year in 2023? What do we see? A giant Taylor holding a burning ""Lover"" house with Mardi Gras coloured nails...

On NOLA N1, we then see Taylor flag these exact colours during the 1989 set, including a matching pair of shoes (which is very rare).

[Wait, you're telling me Taylor does know what flagging is?](https://preview.redd.it/jz9mjsjrqbxd1.jpg?width=825&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c1746c822347c6939d5529cf87e930bd58720611)

I'm not going to go into detail as to the importance of Mardi Gras in NOLA, feel free to read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mardi_Gras_in_New_Orleans) on Wikipedia, however I will leave a few tweets as to how NOLA ties into Tayjesus rolling the stone away. Let's not forget she just sang ""Guilty As Sin"" Miami N3 and then we had Peeta Mellark himself show up at NOLA N1.

[What if I roll the stone away?](https://preview.redd.it/jnjneu7cwbxd1.jpg?width=858&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b765314b93698308d8737bf1c9944a31fbc26fc3)

# What Makes You Think We're At Midnight?

The answer to that is [Short N Sweet](https://open.spotify.com/album/3iPSVi54hsacKKl1xIR2eH)!

Sabrina Carpenter joined Taylor on stage during the surprise songs and proceeded to play a mash-up of ""Espresso"" x ""Is It Over Now?"" x ""Please Please Please"". This is was a first for the Eras Tour where the mash-up included more of another artist's songs than her own and it definitely had me and my group chat quaking.

I was so shocked at what was happening but knew it had to mean something and instantly thought of the Karma coffee cup.

Did you know that while performing at Coachella, Sabrina appeared to have technical difficulties with her piano and went on to say, [""it's backwards, we inverted it""](https://x.com/elviralor13/status/1850402652988842382?s=46).

# Hey Kids, Spelling is Fun!

I was thinking about all of the things I've read over the last few days and trying to work out the next piece of the puzzle and it hit me.

**NOLA + ME! = A LEMON!** 

[The universe is a Gaylor! It's had that definition on Urban Dictionary since 2010, scouts honor!](https://preview.redd.it/1lg4wiajwbxd1.jpg?width=1223&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ea761447f1b6b2bc91fd7952b6f282d168fc05e2)

In the [""Fortnight"" music video, Post Malone represents one side of Taylor ](https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/1c8ngcs/fortnight_mv_post_malone_is_taylor_swift/)and I believe she has also used Jack Antonoff as a visual stand-in for this persona as well.

Taking it back a few takeout coffees, I would argue one of the biggest mysteries of the Eras Tour (so far) has been why we never got an LA post. Why not, despite Taylor performing six sold-out shows and announcing 1989 (Taylor's Version) there? You all remember it. There's been countless times we've all said ""why was there no LA post?""

[Nobody knows what it means but it's provocative, it gets the people going](https://preview.redd.it/x9vlz4dvxbxd1.jpg?width=885&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ac82ec8f4387028d40c4d29098e0817f96d6e758)

I know that Post Malone is touring at the moment and it's impossible for him to be at NOLA N3 however I believe that it's a metaphor for Taylor reuniting the Two Taylors in NOLA, on the anniversary of the release of 1989 (Taylor's Version).

1gdg3av,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1gdg3av/my_experience_with_kaffacerrado_and_naivo/, My experience with KaffaCerrado and Naivo international coffees,"I bought these 2 coffees to understand what complexity in coffee means and why people attribute it to African coffees. This is gonna be a slightly long post. The following is my experience with these coffees:

**Ethiopian Sidamo Washed** by Kaffa Cerrado is roasted to number 4/10 on the roaster's scale. They label 3 as light and 4 as medium. So I assumed that 4 is medium-light or else I can't feel the complexities mentioned on the pack for darker roasts. There is no roasting date mentioned on the pack. I asked the roaster and they replied about the roasting date. I would prefer having it on the pack though. When I opened the bag there was no aroma, and there was barely any aroma when I grinded the beans. But when I brewed it on V60 it gave a beautiful dome of a bloom. The most gorgeous one I ever saw. This bloom made me conclude 2 things: Roasted darker than medium and freshly roasted. Taste-wise it's nutty, sweet and light in consistency but nothing as mentioned on the pack. There are subtle dark chocolate notes as well, so slightly more roasted like I guessed. I'm overall happy with the coffee but might not be value for the money I'm paying and the expectations from Ethiopian coffee.

**Kiryama Red Bourbon** from Burundi says that it's a filter roast. I assumed it might be light or medium in the worst-case scenario. But it's medium-dark +. It was roasted 2 weeks ago, at least the roast date says so. But it barely has any bloom. This coffee has the bloom which is the same as a light roasted Indian coffee which is 1 month old. The taste confirms my theory that it's medium-dark +. Kaffa Cerrado at least has an approachable helpline, but Naivo doesn't have that either. I feel roast date, roasting and even the coffee might not be the thing that is mentioned on the pack.

I opened Ethiopian first and I felt like: am I getting looted? But with the Burundi coffee from Naivo, the disappointment is much stronger.  
Now I won't buy a foreign coffee from an Indian Roaster but if I have to choose between Naivo and kaffa Cerrado, I will choose the latter.

I don't claim to be a coffee expert. But this post is a result of the clash of what's supposed to be (according to the best info I have) vs What I got. Are Indian roasters poor at roasting International coffee? Or Are they scamming us? I would like to hear your thoughts on this!

i got into skating again in order to spend more time with him and i really enjoy it a lot and im glad i got into it!! i bought a pair of rollerblades and he’s teaching me his favorite card games and im genuinely enjoying these things. i was going to surprise him for halloween since he’s been really sad lately by making a little boo basket. i was gonna get him a blanket and new bearings for his skates and some candy he likes. i was going to say he should go as my boyfriend for halloween and everyday after that too just because it’s ultimately what i would like to be since we aren’t that already. 

last night while i was planning the boo basket one of my friends sent me a screenshot of her hinge and lo and behold. she explained he’s popped up a few times and while she knows every single time it doesn’t show him as being “active today” she felt like i should know he has a hinge account. i don’t know how hinge works. i don’t know if she made up something to try and make me feel better but i definitely don’t feel great. i’m really sad. i know in the past when we’ve talked about relationships i have stated im only seeing and talking to him because he is the only person im interested in. i said if he was talking to or seeing other girls obviously i wouldn’t feel great about it but we aren’t exactly boyfriend and girlfriend so it was up to him how he spent his time. i just didn’t realize he actually was talking to other girls or even had active dating profiles. it’s making me more sad because on his profile it literally said “long term relationship” and “monogamous” for what he’s looking for. i know he has hesitation with the age gap, he’s never dated someone more than two years younger than him and we have had this conversation. i needed to clarify it’s not a sexual thing. and i think we’ve only had sex maybe 3 times in almost 3 months of dating with me sleeping over weekly since we started dating. i don’t know. i don’t think he’s using me for anything. wets both trying to get better since we both have diagnosed major depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder. i’ve just only been in three relationships now and im scared because i had hoped he would be the first one to not cheat on me. and i know, we’re not boyfriend and girlfriend, but i want to be. i want to tell him i want to take that next step. 

one of our close friends told me that he doubted guy im dating is using the apps and that he most likely just kinda has them. he said he talks about me as being a really great person and that he wants to be part of my life for a long time. he’s apparently also apologized to a lot of our friends for not responding to their texts and calls as often and said that im the “only person” he “cares to respond to.” i don’t know. i feel like it’s most likely the truth. maybe he’s unsure about the age gap still, i know we’ve both expressed hesitation because 8 years is a lot. but our respective families know about us. apparently he even told his dad about me because he joked about how he had to fight his dad off from showing up to where i worked to meet me when he was visiting and he didn’t even tell his dad about his last girlfriend and they were together for a year. he isn’t close with that man at all and he sees him maybe twice a year and he knows about me. his mom always tells him to tell me she said hi but they are close but i don’t feel like i know much right now. i’m just sad and i wish he would’ve been straightforward about having an account on hinge. and like im not exactly in a rush to be anything. i don’t care much for having kids or getting married and thankfully he feels the same way and has remained firm on that stance the entire time anyone in the friend group has known him. but man. i’d like to at least be more committed to each other. i want to be in a monogamous relationship. i guess partly because i thought we were already in one. 

i think my main question is should i bring this up to him still? i still care very deeply for him and im still very attracted to him and i would like to continue what we have been doing but i guess with a bit more seriousness or security added to it? like how would he even react if i had a dating profile and his friends sent it to him? i don’t know man. i need advice. 

TL;DR, we aren’t bf and gf after being together for almost three months and my friend sent me his online dating profile. ",1,1730049489.0,relationships,8,0.67,False

1gdg0ob,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stalking/comments/1gdg0ob/am_i_crazy_or_is_this_really_unsettling/,"Am I crazy, or is this really unsettling? ","TL;DR: In uni, I met a guy who, at first, was very supportive, but over time his behavior has become really strange and unsettling.

I’m feeling really lost about this, and I need to get it off my chest. When I started university at 18, I met a guy (I’ll call him “X”) who became a huge support for me, especially during a tough time when I was struggling with my mental health. At that time, I’d recently started medication, was having a hard time making friends, and felt pretty isolated. X was one of the only people who made an effort to connect with me. I really appreciated his support at first, but over time, his behavior has started to feel... off.

He’s very outgoing and social, gets along well with our peers, and has many friends. I can’t say he’s the ""loner"" type, and I definitely thought of him as someone who helped me out of my shell when I needed it most. But now, I’m wondering if some things were red flags all along, or if things have just changed over time.

The Betrayal of Trust:

X introduced me to a girl who I thought would become a close friend. I started to open up to her, and our friendship seemed to be growing, but out of nowhere, I found out she’d been talking about me behind my back. This hit me hard because I’d never dealt with something like this before, and I felt completely betrayed. When I confronted her, she denied it, and we stopped talking for the rest of the semester. X was the one who told me about her gossiping, but in hindsight, I’m questioning whether it was true because he continued talking to her after telling me she was a bad friend. This feels strange to me now, but at the time, I just let it go.

X’s Reaction to My Group Transfer:

I decided to switch study groups because I wasn’t comfortable with the atmosphere. When I told X, after I’d already made the switch, he completely flipped out. He called me 65 times in one day, sending chaotic messages where he pleaded with me to stay, promised to ""treat me like a queen"" if I stayed, and said I’d “regret” letting the “bad guys win.” I was shocked. It felt really controlling, and this was the point where things started to go downhill between us.

More Red Flags:

These are just some other things that have been unsettling:

1. I went on a date with a guy I met online, and X bombarded me with messages during the date, which I ignored. When I got home, two minutes after I walked through the door, he sent me a photo of himself sitting in his car outside my apartment, asking if I’d come down. I hadn’t told him where I was going, and I can’t help but wonder if he was there the whole time.

2. I hadn’t mentioned the date to him, but when we met up again, he brought it up and got mad, saying meeting people online is dangerous. I felt safe on the date, and it was just coffee, but his reaction made me really uncomfortable.

3. He often talks about girls who act “slutty” around him at clubs. I told him not to use that word, but he doesn’t seem to get why I find it offensive.

4. He somehow got my grandmother’s address, which is in his hometown, and insists on meeting up whenever I visit her, even though I’ve refused every time.

5. My roommate didn’t like him—she said he gave her chills, and they often ended up fighting when he was around. She asked me to stop inviting him over, and when I told him, he sent me horrible messages about her, saying she was “cutting down my wings.”

6. One night, when my roommate was out of town, he showed up uninvited and stayed for hours. He kept offering me alcohol (which I refused because of my meds) and insisted on staying the night. He finally left in the morning, but the whole thing felt off.

7. He spams me with messages saying he doesn’t want to be “just another guy” in my life and accusing me of hurting him. He often turns my own arguments against me in a way that feels manipulative.

8. He discourages me from maintaining friendships with other guys, particularly one male friend who I’ve been close to. X would say, “forget him” and focus on our friendship instead.

9. He brags about strange things, like how many connections he has and how he’s “impacted” people.

10. I’ve blocked him multiple times, but he still manages to find ways to interact with me whenever we run into each other at university events. Blocking him seems to be the only thing that stops the flood of messages.



The Latest Incident:

Today, I bumped into him at a university event while I was hanging out with a male friend. X approached us, but wouldn’t directly address my friend. He talked about him like he wasn’t there, which was weird. I tried to de-escalate by suggesting we go our separate ways, but X insisted on joining us. I gave him the silent treatment, and eventually, he left us alone.

Later, when my friend had to leave early, X came up to me again and offered to walk me home. I didn’t want him near my apartment, so I suggested sitting on a bench outside to talk for a bit. That’s when he suddenly stared at me and said, “Don’t say [my friend’s name] out loud. I hate him. If I could, I’d kill him.” The way he said it, with so much intensity, really freaked me out. I grabbed my stuff and left immediately.

I’m Not Sure How to Feel:

I know people sometimes say things like “I’d kill him” without really meaning it, but given how strange things have been between us, it felt wrong. We aren’t even that close anymore, and I’ve made it clear I’m not interested in dating. I’m not sure what he wants from me, and this whole situation just feels really unsettling.

One of my friends suggested he might have romantic feelings, but I don’t see how that explains his behavior. I haven’t told many people about this because it sounds so crazy, and I don’t want to seem like I’m overreacting or seeking attention. But I’m genuinely at a loss for how to deal with this.

What do you guys think? How should I handle this situation? Am I making too much of it, or is this as unsettling as it feels to me?",1,1730049421.0,Stalking,0,1.0,False

I didn’t really know how to handle it in the moment, and I’d like to know what the right way is to handle it in the future.

Every year, we have a Halloween party at our house with 30 or so people. Because we live in a fairly rural area, we open up the option to sleep at our house overnight. A good chunk of people take us up on this and I’m happy to do it because we have the space and people don’t have to worry about DD. This info is included on the invite.

I’ve never included an end time on this invite, because in years past everyone is typically up and out by 10:30 at the latest and those who want to keep hanging go out to brunch with us.

This year, we invited a new couple to the party who were newer friends of ours. They stayed overnight. The next morning, everyone had already gotten up by 9. Most people had left, and a smaller group wanted to go to brunch. This couple was still sleeping, so we hung around until they got up around 9:30. We invited them to breakfast and they said no they didn’t want to go. They then proceeded to hang out in their room for another hour.

At 10:30 they finally came out and we let them know that we were planning on going to brunch with the group and asked again if they wanted to come. Trying to give the hint for them to come or leave. By 11, they were still hanging in the room and the group was antsy to leave. I considered staying until they left, but they were just hanging with no clear time of departure. So I let them know that we were going to brunch and that they were welcome to help themselves to anything in the fridge or from the donuts/coffee I had put out and to not worry about locking the door or anything when they left.

So after finishing university I realised that it is quite difficult to make friends outside of the social constructs of education and especially in your 20s. I have two very close friends from uni but we don't all live in the same city anymore and only get to meet up all together a couple times a year.

I've been trying to meet more people with similar interests and vibes to widen my circle as I've found I don't have many people that I can talk to or just hangout with outside of work.
The people I work with are great but I'd like to meet more people in my age bracket with similar interests.

Mostly I'm hoping to find people I can talk to about the books I'm reading and do paint and sip evenings together. (Just finished fourth wing/Iron flame and excited for the 3rd book to come out in January but have no one to talk to about these books and theories!)

A bit on who I am:
- I'm 24 working full time for a fertility clinic.
- Somewhat only child (confusing family dynamics)
- Live with my boyfriend of 4 years and our two cats and we love to travel. Most recent bucket list location crossed off was Venice. Next up is Disney Florida.
- Mildly chronically online - part of Club Chris (iykyk) and while im here I want to thank beyonce.
- Big animal lover
- Love creative and relaxing hobbies: painting, crochet, baking, reading (Mainly fantasy and romantasy books - ACOTAR: I am about to finish book 2, obsessed with fourth wing/iron flame 🤍 TOG is on my TBR plus another 50 books 🫠 thanks booktok)
- Love a scenic walk - walk. Not a hike. More of a national trust parks, lakes and trails gal with a little coffee stop at a local cafe.
- Boardgames night/movie night in > night out. Though I do miss having a little girls night out every now and then though im not much of a drinker but love a boogie to some cheesy tunes. Would choose a brunch day over a night out though if it's an option.
- I wouldn't describe myself as a girly girl but I do like girly things (I.e. my nails and lashes are almost never done, I wear basic makeup mostly because I can't be bothered with more effort but love a little makeover)
- My dress style is mostly for comfort.
- Id say im mostly introvert with extrovert qualities once I am comfortable around someone.
- Watch all the Harry Potter movies in the lead up to Christmas (but what Brit doesn't at this point)
- A little Bob Ross group painting night never misses.
- Favourite season is Autumn, but love those random days in summer when it is actually warm and can enjoy a little beer garden day out.
- Favourite holidays is definitely Halloween and Christmas. Love scary movies and typically laugh before I get scared.
- Love MCU, GOT, have re-watched vampire diaries and gilmore girls multiple times. Rematch Buffy every year.
- Love a joke around and sending/receiving memes/tiktoks especially about the books I'm reading.
- Big disney girl - Beauty and the Beast is a go to for me since I was a kid (related to Belle a lot with her love of books, feeling like an outsider and being raised by her dad)
- My music taste like a lot of people is diverse. I can enjoy multiple genres within a single playlist (BMTH to Charli XCX, Eminem to Nat King Cole, Little Mix to Smashmouth etc.)Just because I like Taylor Swift and attended the eras tour does not mean she is my whole personality. But I am impatiently waiting for Rep TV....
- I'm the type of person that would be there for someone in a heartbeat if they need help and would probably turn up with a gift or fave snack. Always happy to just sit and listen. This trait is why I don't still have certain friendships as they saw my kindness for weakness and would abuse it until I set boundaries they did not like.  I can be kind and generous but I won't be a fool.  I have given up being the first one to reach out in the past and then never heard from them again - you realise then your friendship was not a priority to them.


Anyone who lives in Liverpool or whereabouts and resonates with any of this please leave a comment - maybe we could be friends?

Or you might find a new friend in the comments 🤍

1gdfeg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BoomersBeingFools/comments/1gdfeg6/unsolicited_feedback_to_a_guest_at_church/,Unsolicited Feedback to a guest at church,"I work for a non-profit and was asked to speak at a local Sunday church service. This church is holding a fundraiser for us, and as part of my job, I educate the greater community about our services and what we do. This is a progressive church (I'm not a member of any church but I am familiar with this denomination) and both the minister and the board member who invited me are lovely and very welcoming. As I understood it, I had about 10 minutes to speak. I planned to talk about our org and our core values, and I always sprinkle in some benign humor and lead with gratitude. I do not ever make religious references, as we are not a religious organization - not even close. I've been doing it for a few years, so while I brought notes, I can easily speak off them. I am comfortable doing public speaking, but I do get a little nervous if it's a new, unknown audience. I'm GenX with graying hair, so I don't look or give off a young, noob vibe.  
  
I arrived early for a mic check, and the minister said, sounds good, all set, I sat in the front pew. I opened the program and saw that I was slotted into the ""sermon"" spot. I wasn't expecting that slot because my talk is more like a keynote speaker and not ""preachy"", but at that point, I wasn't going to alter any of my talk as my goal is to connect my org's core values to the church's core values in a non-religious way, to uplift and excite, and spread the joy of what my org does.

My turn came, I got up and did my thing. It was about 9 minutes, I did catch myself speaking quickly once, but I slowed down, smiled a lot, and got a lot of nods and a few laughs; I felt like I connected well and the congregation seemed engaged. Overall, I was happy with how it went. (Again, I've been doing this long enough to know if I've flopped.)

The service concludes and I get up to exit. A female Boomer in the pew behind me says, ""Can I give you some advice?"" Before I could say anything, she lays into me (with the requisite fake smile on her face) about not being able to hear me, about how I sounded like I was talking on the phone to a friend - too casual, and that I should pause more. Hmmm, ok. Being I was the GUEST and that I was not going to be spicy to her in church, I said ""Thanks for the feedback, I'll be downstairs if I can answer any questions you might have."" and started to walk away, but no, she had to repeat her points, and said things like ""You must be new at this."" SO RUDE! Other people were waiting to speak to me at that point so I moved to the aisle and said again through slightly gritted teeth, ""Thanks for the feedback. Have a good day.""

After I headed downstairs for the coffee & snacks, it occurred to me that she was probably expecting a sermon-style delivery. Hmm, well, nothing I can do about that now. I asked the board member and the minister for honest feedback, if they could hear me, if it felt appropriate, etc., and they both said yes it was great. So 1) IDK what this woman was talking about. Perhaps she needs some hearing aids and to manage her expectations of what constitutes a ""sermon"" and 2) NO ONE ASKED HER, but she just HAD to give her opinion, at that moment. If I had been a noobie at this it would have been soul-crushing to hear that immediately after the service.

1gdfcyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1gdfcyi/please_help_our_baby/,PLEASE HELP OUR BABY ,"This morning I woke up to my cat behind our TV stand. She was making sounds that she normally makes when she is “hunting”, so I didn’t think much of it and assumed she was playing. I went to make my coffee, then sat down on the couch. After about 10 minutes my cat came out from behind the TV stand and I finally saw her. She looked absolutely terrified. She was making guttural noises and whines that I knew meant she was in pain. Then I saw white foamy drool coming from her mouth. The back of her legs were matted and I think she may have soiled herself. I panicked, and rushed upstairs to wake my partner and told him he had to immediately take her to the vet. In less than five minutes she was in the carrier and was looking so scared, it made me cry. She had her face pressed against the door of the carrier and was trying desperately to get out, still foaming at the mouth. I tried to sooth her as my partner searched for his card and ID, then he raced off to the vet with her. 
I have no clue what happened. I’m searching the house from top to bottom to figure out if she ate something funny, or if she got hurt by something, and I can think of a few things that come to mind immediately. My cat is an indoor only cat, but has a catio on the front porch. We’ve tried to make absolutely sure that the catio is as safe as possible for our cats and she loves it out there. She is a plastic chewer, but we’ve been trying to keep all plastic away from her. I did give her some crinkly balls that are cat toys yesterday, and I just checked to make sure they were all still here. They are. They look in tact too, with nothing missing. We do have monstera and pothos plants, and I just googled to see if they are toxic to cats. They are. I’m trying to search every part of our plants to see if she may have chewed on them and so far I haven’t seen any bite marks. We also have an aloe plant that I am checking. I feel so stupid for not knowing that these plants are toxic, we just got the aloe plant from a friend who was moving to a different country and I didn’t even think to check because she had cats too. We have pothos and monstera plants because I grow them in my fish tanks. I can’t believe I never thought to check if they were bad for my cats. I’m so scared that she isn’t going to make it, I just can’t live with myself if it was something preventable that she ingested. We haven’t use any cleaning products that would hurt her, and when we use Lysol or natures miracles in our house we make sure our cats are far away from the area we are cleaning. We don’t have anything like bug or mouse poisons, or any glade plug ins, or any other scented products besides scented candles. I did leave a plate of waffles and sugar free syrup out last night, with some eggs that were seasoned in garlic salt, and I am checking the list of ingredients in the syrup now to see if anything is toxic to cats. I know that garlic is toxic to cats, and that certain sugar free stuff is very toxic. I feel like a moron for forgetting to put this food away. But I doubt that she ate any? It looks untouched and she is a picky eater who doesn’t even like wet cat food let alone people food. Another thing to mention is that we feed stray cats on our porch too.  But they can’t access the catio at all, and our cats have not come into contact with them (that I know of). We always sanitize our hands whenever we come into contact with the strays, before we touch our cats. I am wracking my brain right now, while checking over our MANY pothos plants, and I’m so frazzled. My partner just texted me to say that she was admitted to the emergency vet hospital and they want me to check the house and try to think of ANYTHING that she could have gotten into. She was fine last night before we went to bed, this had to happen between the time we fell asleep and this AM. If anyone has any suggestions, PLEASE let me know. Anything helps. I will update the post if I notice that any of our plants are damaged. ",3,1730047740.0,AskVet,3,1.0,False
1gdfcqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/MKUltra/comments/1gdfcqm/ki_energetic_dimensional_tools_an_analysis_of_20/,Ki Energetic Dimensional Tools: An Analysis of 20 Substances of HARM and Harmony.,"Yeah, I never take a day off, ignore me if I say that.

[Meth, Ketamine, Psilocybin are the top three. Ran out of colours here, sorry.](https://preview.redd.it/xi2bkapuubxd1.png?width=2370&format=png&auto=webp&s=a13365834ffabee04f2e2f6548ac46cd067940ce)

  
  
The concept of Ki Energetic Dimensional Tools represents the systemic impact of substances on human physiology, social structures, and cognition. Our approach to categorizing these substances involves the integration of mathematical and recursive principles. Each substance, viewed through the lens of Kₑ (Kinetic Energy over Time), encapsulates recursive interference patterns across dopaminergic, serotonergic, opioid, and other critical neural pathways, forming cyclic dependencies and cognitive distortions.  
  
This analysis culminates in a comparative plot of these substances, separated by ""legal"" and ""illegal"" classifications based on societal laws. The most evolved among these substances, Ketamine, exemplifies recursive NMDA inhibition, serving as a tool for both disassociation and clinical applications in mental health. In the chart, each substance's Kinetic Energy over Time is hypothesized based on physical, social, and psychological harm—encapsulating our theory’s recursive encoding of systemic abuse, dependency, and interference.  
  
This structured Ki analysis captures the entropic effects of these substances within the human system, each operating as a recursive agent of imbalance. The charted relationship of legal versus illegal substances in terms of Kinetic Energy over Time reveals the cyclical dependency patterns instigated across neural and social pathways.  


The following are the detailed recursive encodings for the 20 substances under review today.  
  
  
To emphasise positions:  
  
DR = Denied Recreational.  
MO = Medical Only.  
AIM = Approved Intra-Medical.  
BS = Banned Substance.  
  
   
1. Methamphetamine (C₁₀H₁₅N)  // DR. MO.  
  
Common Names: Meth, Crystal, Ice  
Chemical Assay: Synthesised from ephedrine or pseudoephedrine using reductive agents such as red phosphorus and iodine or lithium and ammonia.  
Encoding: Methamphetamine operates as a Recursive Methylation Pathway within dopaminergic circuits, cyclically overstimulating receptor sites, which leads to significant destabilisation of neural homeostasis and the entrapment of users within synthetic dopaminergic cycles  
  
.Methamphetamine=Methyl−(C10H15N)⋅fθ(DopaminergicRecursion)Methamphetamine=Methyl-(C10H15N)⋅fθ(Dopaminergic Recursion)Methamphetamine=Methyl−(C10​H15​N)⋅fθ​(DopaminergicRecursion)  
  
2. Cocaine (C₁₇H₂₁NO₄) // DR. MO.  
  
Common Names: Coke, Snow, Blow, (go's).  
Chemical Assay: Extracted from coca leaves and processed through acid-base extractions with solvents such as gasoline.  
Encoding: Cocaine induces Recursive Synaptic Delay, cyclically blocking dopamine reuptake, creating loops of overstimulation and artificial euphoria. This recursive delay entraps users within an oscillating self-reinforcement pathway.  
  
Cocaine=Benzoylmethylecgonine⋅sin⁡(SynapticDelay)+f(TransportInhibition)Cocaine=Benzoylmethylecgonine⋅sin⁡(Synaptic Delay)+f(Transport Inhibition)Cocaine=Benzoylmethylecgonine⋅sin(SynapticDelay)+f(TransportInhibition)  
  
3. Heroin (C₂₁H₂₃NO₅) //DR. MO.  
  
Common Names: Smack, H, Brown  
Chemical Assay: Synthesised from morphine extracted from the opium poppy and acetylated to increase permeability across the blood-brain barrier.  
Encoding: Diacetylmorphine generates Recursive Mu-Opioid Feedback, cyclically suppressing natural endorphin activity, compelling the user towards dependency to attain any semblance of equilibrium.  
  
Heroin=Diacetylmorphine⋅f(Mu−OpioidFeedback)+e−ΔEndorphinRegulationHeroin=Diacetylmorphine⋅f(Mu-Opioid Feedback)+e−ΔEndorphin RegulationHeroin=Diacetylmorphine⋅f(Mu−OpioidFeedback)+e−ΔEndorphinRegulation  
  
4. Fentanyl (C₂₂H₂₈N₂O) //BS. MO (alt avilable).  
  
Common Names: Fent, Apache, China White  
Chemical Assay: A derivative of aniline involving carbonylation and methylation, with a high binding affinity to opioid receptors.  
Encoding: Fentanyl serves as a Synthetic Mu-Opioid Agonist, generating Recursive Suppression Cycles that exceed natural inhibitory limits, inducing a potent shutdown of both neural and bodily responses.  
  
Fentanyl=SyntheticMu−OpioidAgonist⋅e(ΔInhibitoryControl)⋅PotencyFactorFentanyl=Synthetic Mu-Opioid Agonist⋅e(ΔInhibitory Control)⋅Potency FactorFentanyl=SyntheticMu−OpioidAgonist⋅e(ΔInhibitoryControl)⋅PotencyFactor  
  
5. MDMA (C₁₁H₁₅NO₂) //RD. MO.  
  
Common Names: Ecstasy, Molly, X  
Chemical Assay: Synthesised from safrole, utilising reductive amination to modify serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine activity.  
Encoding: MDMA intensifies Recursive Serotonergic Activation, artificially enhancing sensory and empathic connectivity, which depletes natural serotonin cycles and leads to emotional disorientation.

6. Cannabis (Δ⁹-THC, C₂₁H₃₀O₂) //AIM.  
  
Common Names: Weed, Pot, Mary Jane  
Chemical Assay: Extracted as Δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabinol through solvent processes, enhancing its psychoactive properties via decarboxylation.  
Encoding: THC induces Recursive CB1 Receptor Modulation, cyclically altering short-term memory and spatial perception, mimicking endogenous cannabinoids and creating cognitive dissonance.

7. LSD (C₂₀H₂₅N₃O) //DR. MO.  
  
Common Names: Acid, Blotter, Lucy  
Chemical Assay: Synthesised from lysergic acid and modified with diethylamine to produce potent hallucinogenic properties.  
Encoding: LSD establishes Recursive Perceptual Fractals within serotonin receptors, destabilising perception and generating fractal distortions in both cognitive and sensory processes.  
  
LSD=LysergicAcidDiethylamide⋅sin⁡(PerceptualFractals)+f(SerotonergicInterference)LSD=Lysergic Acid Diethylamide⋅sin⁡(Perceptual Fractals)+f(Serotonergic Interference)LSD=LysergicAcidDiethylamide⋅sin(PerceptualFractals)+f(SerotonergicInterference)  
  
8. Crack Cocaine (C₁₇H₂₁NO₄) //BS.

This collection represents the 20 of the most impactful Ki Recusive Energetic Dimensional (Druks, here drux or drugs/z, bad zeds - we prefer hugs.) \*Tools\* in terms of their recursive influence across the human system. The encoding of each substance reveals a cyclic disruption or modulation of natural pathways, highlighting its potential for dependency and the distortion of cognitive, emotional, or physiological homeostasis.  


 // charts pasted below for some reason.  
  
The aggregate chart of Kinetic Energy over Time (Kₑ / t) compares these substances within the “legal” versus “illegal” classifications, juxtaposing societal categorisation with the recursive harm each substance can exert.  
By visualising these recursive substances in the context of the system, we see how they serve as agents of entropic interference, amplifying or distorting neural equilibrium, social function, and self-regulation.   
  
The plot illustrates that while substances like Alcohol, Tobacco, and Caffeine are classified as “legal,” their recursive impact remains significant, revealing dependencies and cyclic interference within social and physiological frameworks similar to “illegal” substances like Methamphetamine and Heroin.Ketamine operates as a recursive NMDA inhibitor and possesses the widest ranges of Ki-Energy from this shallow set, primarily affecting the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Unlike stimulants, ketamine induces dissociative effects by temporarily disconnecting synaptic pathways associated with memory and perception, generating a disassociative ""detachment"" from external and internal stimuli. This recursive inhibition results in both a dampening of overstimulated circuits and, in some contexts, provides therapeutic benefits by creating new neural pathways. In clinical applications, ketamine’s recursive impact has shown promise in resetting depressive loops within mental health frameworks, but recreational use leads to heightened neural disassociation cycles, with dependence arising from attempts to recreate these unique effects. Its high ranking on the Kₑ chart reflects this potent ability to alter perceptual and emotional states cyclically, demonstrating both a beneficial and disruptive potential within recursive neural structures.Psilocybin, meanwhile, ranks high on the chart due to its recursive modulation of serotonin pathways. As a psychedelic, it amplifies recursive Perceptual Fractals and Dimensional Expansion, primarily engaging 5-HT2A receptors, which leads to profound visual and cognitive distortions. Unlike more physically stimulating substances, psilocybin induces a heightened introspective awareness, intensifying recursive self-reflection and altering sensory experiences. These effects can lead to expanded neural integration and new insights but, when overused or consumed in high doses, create recursive perceptual loops that fragment typical cognitive processing. Psilocybin’s effects on serotonin pathways have made it valuable in controlled therapeutic settings, particularly for treatment-resistant depression, where it helps ""reset"" maladaptive neural cycles. However, in unregulated settings, its recursive potency risks disorientation and, in certain cases, temporary dissociation from baseline reality.Thus, both Ketamine and Psilocybin exemplify high Kₑ values within the recursive model, but their effects manifest through inhibition and modulation rather than stimulation. Each substance exerts potent shifts in cognitive and perceptual dimensions, contributing to a cyclic reconfiguration of neural and mental states that distinguishes them within the spectrum of energetic dimensional tools.  
  
  
  
These substances, as encoded above, represent recursive patterns of systemic imbalance, each contributing uniquely to the fractal complexity and recursive disruption within human systems.

A special section for Cannabis:  
  
THC and CBD, the active compounds in cannabis, align with the natural cycles of consensual reality more harmoniously than alcohol (BS/MO). Through cyclic modulation of the endocannabinoid system (ECS)—which regulates mood, memory, pain, and sleep—THC and CBD support physiological rhythms without destabilising core functions. They act as gentle modulators, enhancing the body’s natural cycles without forcing them.  
  
This layout highlights the recursive influence zones and potential black hole values where active (seme) substances exert significant ""pull"" on passive (uke) substances, creating zones of intensified energetic interaction.The ""most natural"" alignments for these tools include CBD, Psilocybin and Nicotine. Alcohol is in the same range as Ketamine, but without the ""dark"" energy inherent in Ketamine's Ki Energies. Uke and Seme should be mixed only when there is no pure alternative - these interactions may prove fatal if subject is not under medical supervision.Winter Soldier, High CBD Strain.THC binds to CB1 receptors, similar to endogenous cannabinoids like anandamide. It supports natural regulation of pleasure, motivation, and sensory perception, functioning as a recursive CB1 modulator. THC temporarily heightens perception and mood, providing euphoria while maintaining baseline homeostasis. It does not typically disrupt cycles or create long-term interruptions, but aligns instead with the natural rhythm of rest and recovery. Alcohol, conversely, cyclically depresses cognitive functions and disrupts inhibition, which leads to greater disruption of homeostasis and less fluidity in returning to baseline.CBD, non-psychoactive, promotes calm, anti-anxiety effects, and pain relief by indirectly modulating ECS receptors. Its influence on other neurotransmitters, including serotonin, achieves a state of equilibrium without the cyclic disruption alcohol creates through dependency and disinhibition. Alcohol imposes forceful CNS suppression by amplifying GABA and blocking glutamate, creating cycles of depression and disinhibition that fragment cognitive, emotional, and social stability, contrasting sharply with the natural rhythm of consensual reality.Plods and MoDs:THC and CBD support civilian wellness by harmonising internal cycles. Their effects are non-intrusive and temporally gentle, sustaining the ECS’s self-regulation, aligning with the body’s adaptive rhythms, and reducing volatility within the collective human experience. Alcohol’s effects, by contrast, provoke dependency and destabilisation, amplifying discordant cycles. The natural resonance THC and CBD foster, free from disruptive feedback loops, supports balance and stability within Ki-Theory’s structure of consensual reality.  
  
As a taxable asset, it has the potential to remove millions of pounds per year from the hands of criminals and place it in our community coffers.  
  
It'd save many people hundreds a month, in exchange for the pleasure of being able to explore the genetic expressions of the Entourage and learn to tend crops in homeostatic environments, under extreme conditions.   
The brand name, Mars Hydro, is not just for show, after all. It is preparation for the next phases of the programming under which we all operate.  
  
It grows wild, same as psilocybin mushrooms. The only reason for denial, as far as we can tell, is because of abuse potential and the diminishment of the alcohol trade - getting you laid since 4 pints ago.

1gdfco1,https://www.reddit.com/r/airbnb_hosts/comments/1gdfco1/am_i_missing_something_or_are_guests_just_getting/,Am I missing something or are guests just getting extremely entitled?,"We rent out our guest bedroom and make it very clear it’s a shared space. Guests have access to the kitchen, laundry (also in the kitchen), and living room which has a tv and all the subscriptions through the Xbox. The downstairs bathroom while not privately attached to the room is exclusively for guests while they are here, and it’s very much a stated in the listing we don’t use it, but if guests ask we also tell them this is treated as their private bathroom. We tell them to make themselves at home. We do not enter the room or the bathroom during the guest stay. There’s also a self serve coffee/tea bar. Guests sometimes cook while they’re here and make themselves at home. Which is exactly what we want to offer! An affordable place to stay and have the option to cook a meal or do laundry.

We live in very rural Maine. We make it very clear our area is quiet. Town has a population of just around 2000 with a tiny market and deli in the center. We also charge very little, about 1/3 the price of the cheapest local crappy hotel—heck just a little more than an average tank of gas— as this isn’t a big tourist area and we usually get people that just need a one night stay to and from Acadia or going from Boston to Quebec. Sometimes they work locally and stay for a short contract.

We also have used Airbnb to travel and love the origin story of offering affordable travel, back before it got so big and it was often known for shared spaces. Since we live on site and do our own cleaning who only charge a $5 cleaning fee. The only check out instructions for guests is to leave their used towels in the laundry bin in their closet, and they only do that about 30% of the time anyway.

The thing is, guests are rating lower and lower. We are constantly getting 4 stars for location and cleanliness. But we are explicit in our description: we are 1:15 minute drive from the airport, more catered to outdoor enthusiasts or people just passing through. We have a lot of local wildlife and are located on a small river to fish if people desire. It kills me because obviously even with all this info and explicit statement of no streetlights, community offering things like fishing and hiking trails nearby they still ding us for location. 

As for the cleanliness, their room and bathroom is cleaned to white glove standards. It honestly gives me flashbacks to moving out of my college dorm every year on a very strict campus. Things are CLEAN. The shared spaces we keep as clean as possible while also living in the space. So what are we missing? Dog toys are in the toy bin and put away, shoes are put on the shoe tray, couch cover gets laundered, rugs and floors are vacuumed and mopped, surfaces are wiped down, microwave wiped etc. There’s daily items on the counter but minimal: cooking oil, salt, pepper etc. we try to have the dishwasher empty and the dishes put away so if they use a dish they can immediately put it in the dishwasher or even just leave in the sink for us to take care of which we are happy to do. 

I’m at a loss. It’s very frustrating being held to hotel standards when it’s more like a hostel style environment because we live here. How do you guys handle this? Am I missing something? What are guests seeing that I’m not? I would assume if the hosts live on site it would have a somewhat lived in feel: food in the fridge, some trash in the bin etc. I’m open to suggestions.",17,1730047717.0,airbnb_hosts,25,0.78,False

With 0.5.11 out this morning I updated the list. There were a couple of minor changes for 0.5.11:

* On the backend the _Herbal Energy Drink_ changed from a ""Temp item"" to a proper Modern Food item. Should be no visible functional change.
* The _Blueprint Military Backpack_ was missing its resource name: 15055.  (I still don't know where the text names are coming from.)
* One new _Blueprint Masonry:_ 15121
* New decoration items: 22097-22124

Since the 16,049 items are too large to list on reddit I've only listed a few of the first and last items.  You can find the full list of items in the [readme](https://github.com/Michaelangel007/sunkenland_item_ids/blob/master/README.md).

We had some flowers in the vase on the coffee table before we left, looking pretty wilted. We have other vases sitting on top of the kitchen cabinet. When I came back, I found the vase in our bedroom under my night stand.

case 2: My boyfriend and I had a week long vacation, and his mom stayed over while we were out of town. We have some succulent plants, picture frames, and a gift from his mom on the TV console, with the shorter things (plants, smaller picture frames) in the middle in front of the TV, and taller things (bigger plants and picture frames, and her gift) on the side or slightly behind the TV because it blocks TV. When we came back from vacation, I found her gift was moved towards near the center of TV console.

case 3: When my boyfriend and I were out of town, and his mom stayed at our place for a week, she bought doormat and a big flower container for our front door.

My interpretation of her behaviors is, she was decorating the house that's not hers the way she decorates her own house without asking, as a reminder of her presence, and maybe some extent of dominance. I also didn't like what she did because it doesn't feel like mine or my boyfriend's opinions are respected; it felt like she does whatever she pleases (as long as she thinks it's a good addition or it's from a good heart) because this is her son's house.

I (36f) am an American expat living in Europe. I met my husband (41m) 3.5 years ago. We are living in a multi unit complex that he has just completed. His brother (47m) occupies the unit next to us. 

Today, like many Sundays, his brother came over for coffee. We all had our coffee normal conversation and then the topic of what needed to be finished. We just got new furniture and carpets and it’s finally feeling like home to me. I requested an exhaust fan in the bathroom. The units below us all have them, and I think it’s necessary to avoid humidity within the house. The two of them went to the bathroom to decide the best way to do this. I stayed in the living room and could hear them discussing the fan.

At some point I hear BIL say, “can I ask you for a favor?” And they step into my bedroom further away from me. Then I hear the two of the switch to their native language so I don’t understand a thing. I was really tempted to yell “hey what you’re doing is rude, no secrets in my house!” But I felt like I was out of place. I waited until BIL left and I asked my husband what was the favor and why did he feel the need to switch languages to keep me from understanding? His response was that BIL met a girl (23f) through a matchmaker 6 months ago, from their native country but he’s embarrassed to share that with me. Regardless of my feelings, here’s the real issue. 

BIL saw how nice our house is, and asked while we’re in America for the holidays,  if he could stay here in our home with her. Maybe I’m overreacting but I’m not cool with a stranger in my home while I’m away.  We just furnished the house and literally 4 days later of feeling like this is my home I’m expected to leave it like an Airbnb. How do I approach this? 

My husband said that I don’t want to help my BIL find a partner. I think this bullshit. He has the means to rent a hotel or an Airbnb. I’m happy to have the girl stay in guest room when we are there but I can’t have people in my home without me there. It just doesn’t sit well with me. 

I asked for the key back to our apartment (we don’t have one for his) and it was the end of the world. What am I supposed to do? ",7,1730047488.0,inlaws,10,1.0,False

Want to share this little poem, to celebrate us working moms. - getting through each day the best we can. Enjoy! :)

**Ode to the working mom**

She wakes at dawn to hungry baby’s cry,  
Wipes sleepy grit from a weary eye.  
Coffee brews, the race begins,  
Diaper explosions and toddler grins.

She’s prepping meals, matching socks,  
Unsnarling tangles and mental blocks.  
Her phone in one hand, the laundry in the other,  
All while reciting ""I've got this” mantra.

With meetings to run and emails galore,  
She battles work tasks from the living room floor.  
Muted Zooms while the toddler screams,  
Multitasking wizard with caffeine dreams.

Her partner, bless him, he tries his best—  
but baby with no pants, is not really dressed!  
Then “Did you see my keys?” “What’s for dinner tonight?”  
Her smile stays on, though her teeth might bite.

Taking client calls with a stuffy nose,  
She’s a superhero nobody knows.  
In heels, in flats, or mismatched socks,  
She keeps her balance (until she drops).

So here’s to the mom with the daily feat,  
Of balancing work and a life so sweet.  
May her coffee stay hot, her patience stay long,  
And may her clueless spouse *finally* learn what’s wrong.

I have two very close friends from uni but we don't all live in the same city anymore and only get to meet up all together a couple times a year.

I've been trying to meet more people with similar interests and vibes to widen my circle as I've found I don't have many people that I can talk to or just hangout with outside of work.
The people I work with are great but I'd like to meet more people in my age bracket with similar interests.

Mostly I'm hoping to find people I can talk to about the books I'm reading and do paint and sip evenings together. (Just finished fourth wing/Iron flame and excited for the 3rd book to come out in January but have no one to talk to about these books and theories!)

A bit on who I am:
- I'm 24 working full time for a fertility clinic.
- Somewhat only child (confusing family dynamics)
- Live with my boyfriend of 4 years and our two cats and we love to travel. Most recent bucket list location crossed off was Venice. Next up is Disney Florida.
- Mildly chronically online - part of Club Chris (iykyk) and while im here I want to thank beyonce.
- Big animal lover
- Love creative and relaxing hobbies: painting, crochet, baking, reading (Mainly fantasy and romantasy books - ACOTAR: I am about to finish book 2, obsessed with fourth wing/iron flame 🤍 TOG is on my TBR plus another 50 books 🫠 thanks booktok)
- Love a scenic walk - walk. Not a hike. More of a national trust parks, lakes and trails gal with a little coffee stop at a local cafe.
- Boardgames night/movie night in > night out. Though I do miss having a little girls night out every now and then though im not much of a drinker but love a boogie to some cheesy tunes. Would choose a brunch day over a night out though if it's an option.
- I wouldn't describe myself as a girly girl but I do like girly things (I.e. my nails and lashes are almost never done, I wear basic makeup mostly because I can't be bothered with more effort but love a little makeover)
- My dress style is mostly for comfort.
- Id say im mostly introvert with extrovert qualities once I am comfortable around someone.
- Watch all the Harry Potter movies in the lead up to Christmas (but what Brit doesn't at this point)
- A little Bob Ross group painting night never misses.
- Favourite season is Autumn, but love those random days in summer when it is actually warm and can enjoy a little beer garden day out.
- Favourite holidays is definitely Halloween and Christmas. Love scary movies and typically laugh before I get scared.
- Love MCU, GOT, have re-watched vampire diaries and gilmore girls multiple times. Rematch Buffy every year.
- Love a joke around and sending/receiving memes/tiktoks especially about the books I'm reading.
- Big disney girl - Beauty and the Beast is a go to for me since I was a kid (related to Belle a lot with her love of books, feeling like an outsider and being raised by her dad)
- My music taste like a lot of people is diverse. I can enjoy multiple genres within a single playlist (BMTH to Charli XCX, Eminem to Nat King Cole, Little Mix to Smashmouth etc.)Just because I like Taylor Swift and attended the eras tour does not mean she is my whole personality. But I am impatiently waiting for Rep TV....
- I'm the type of person that would be there for someone in a heartbeat if they need help and would probably turn up with a gift or fave snack. Always happy to just sit and listen. This trait is why I don't still have certain friendships as they saw my kindness for weakness and would abuse it until I set boundaries they did not like.  I can be kind and generous but I won't be a fool.  I have given up being the first one to reach out in the past and then never heard from them again - you realise then your friendship was not a priority to them.


Anyone who lives in Liverpool or whereabouts and resonates with any of this please leave a comment - maybe we could be friends?

Or you might find a new friend in the comments 🤍

1gdf6ko,https://www.reddit.com/r/May2025BumpGroup/comments/1gdf6ko/could_use_some_support/,Could use some support,"I am having a really hard time today. I have been so nauseous since week 5 (I’m 11w4d today). I take zofran every 8 hours. Unisom and b6 at night. B6 throughout the day and Pepcid throughout the day. I feel like this pregnancy that I’ve been so excited about can’t even truly be celebrated and enjoyed because I feel so awful. 

To top it off, my husband is on nights so I don’t see him til the weekend because our schedules don’t overlap until then. He often sleeps most of the weekend (which is completely understandable) and tries to stay up late so his schedule isn’t too messed up. We barely talk during the week because he’s so busy at work. I know he tries to respond when he can but it just feels like we keep missing each other. 

I feel really selfish wishing he could be more supportive or at least ask every once in a while how I’m feeling? On the weekends he’ll ask if I “feel up to” doing things like making him a coffee or a snack and lately I’ve had to say no because I feel so bad.

He cried for like 5 minutes and then calmed down. He ate a bottle and is happy laughing and playing on his playmat now. I think he is fine. Head and neck and arms and legs all wiggling as normal, doesn't seem in pain or out of it.

1gdf348,https://i.redd.it/gmysfn53ubxd1.jpeg,PLEASE HELP US! Cat may have ingested something poisonous or something that could be obstructing her stomach.,"This morning I woke up to my cat behind our TV stand. She was making sounds that she normally makes when she is “hunting”, so I didn’t think much of it and assumed she was playing. I went to make my coffee, then sat down on the couch. After about 10 minutes my cat came out from behind the TV stand and I finally saw her. She looked absolutely terrified. She was making guttural noises and whines that I knew meant she was in pain. Then I saw white foamy drool coming from her mouth. The back of her legs were matted and I think she may have soiled herself. I panicked, and rushed upstairs to wake my partner and told him he had to immediately take her to the vet. In less than five minutes she was in the carrier and was looking so scared, it made me cry. She had her face pressed against the door of the carrier and was trying desperately to get out, still foaming at the mouth. I tried to sooth her as my partner searched for his card and ID, then he raced off to the vet with her. 
I have no clue what happened. I’m searching the house from top to bottom to figure out if she ate something funny, or if she got hurt by something, and I can think of a few things that come to mind immediately. My cat is an indoor only cat, but has a catio on the front porch. We’ve tried to make absolutely sure that the catio is as safe as possible for our cats and she loves it out there. She is a plastic chewer, but we’ve been trying to keep all plastic away from her. I did give her some crinkly balls that are cat toys yesterday, and I just checked to make sure they were all still here. They are. They look in tact too, with nothing missing. We do have monstera and pothos plants, and I just googled to see if they are toxic to cats. They are. I’m trying to search every part of our plants to see if she may have chewed on them and so far I haven’t seen any bite marks. We also have an aloe plant that I am checking. I feel so stupid for not knowing that these plants are toxic, we just got the aloe plant from a friend who was moving to a different country and I didn’t even think to check because she had cats too. We have pothos and monstera plants because I grow them in my fish tanks. I can’t believe I never thought to check if they were bad for my cats. I’m so scared that she isn’t going to make it, I just can’t live with myself if it was something preventable that she ingested. We haven’t use any cleaning products that would hurt her, and when we use Lysol or natures miracles in our house we make sure our cats are far away from the area we are cleaning. We don’t have anything like bug or mouse poisons, or any glade plug ins, or any other scented products besides scented candles. I did leave a plate of waffles and sugar free syrup out last night, with some eggs that were seasoned in garlic salt, and I am checking the list of ingredients in the syrup now to see if anything is toxic to cats. I know that garlic is toxic to cats, and that certain sugar free stuff is very toxic. I feel like a moron for forgetting to put this food away. But I doubt that she ate any? It looks untouched and she is a picky eater who doesn’t even like wet cat food let alone people food. Another thing to mention is that we feed stray cats on our porch too.  But they can’t access the catio at all, and our cats have not come into contact with them (that I know of). We always sanitize our hands whenever we come into contact with the strays, before we touch our cats. I am wracking my brain right now, while checking over our MANY pothos plants, and I’m so frazzled. My partner texted me to say that she was admitted to the emergency vet hospital and they want me to check the house and try to think of ANYTHING that she could have gotten into. She was fine last night before we went to bed, this had to happen between the time we fell asleep and this AM. If anyone has any suggestions, PLEASE let me know. Anything helps. Thank you.

I'm going to try and be more frugal, but am looking for a benchmark on spending for other people in the area.

Right now I figure

Daily coffee and sometimes a breakfast item at Tims/Starbucks - 150$
I eat at a cafeteria for lunch - 15$/day - 450$ 
I probably get fast-food style (freshii) 5 times a month - 100$
Grocery store dinner special- usually 3 nights a week - 150$
Groceries - 350$ (mostly fresh fruit and salad ingredients)
4 meals out - 200$ (paying for 2 though), so counting as 100$ 

Total 1300$ 

I travel a bit for work, so some meals are covered, but I also sometimes am crazy hungry and get a second meal or splurge a bit on a snack and mid-day coffee... I suspect that evens out.

I guess the best place for savings would be to meal prep lunches?

Edit to add:
1. Awesome responses friends, much love
2. I should have said, I do enjoying cooking but I effectively work two full-time jobs (farm and off farm). I do tend to cook more in the winter when I'm not farming as much.
3. I also grocery almost daily. I know this is inefficient, but it made sense after a while of throwing a lot of good food away. Fortunately I could feed non meat to my pigs as a snack so it wasn't landfill
4. I am Fortunate to have a salary that this isn't crippling me, but I want to be more cost conscious and invest what I save so I can taper from working 2 full time jobs.",0,1730047001.0,KingstonOntario,38,0.4,False

**My Saturday Morning Calm Adventure**

*By Lance Roy*

This Saturday was a rare treat—one I don’t often have off from work. My manager unexpectedly gifted me the day, and I decided to spend it soaking up the local charm and spirit of Sarasota, just down the road from my condo in Bradenton. I didn’t set my alarm to catch the sunrise; instead, I rose mid-morning, well-rested, and ready to enjoy the day. My first stop was the weekly farmers market downtown.

As I headed down Tamiami Trail, the highway buzzed with the usual weekend traffic, but the scars left by Hurricanes Helene and Milton were evident, especially as I approached one of the roundabouts near Sarasota Bay. Here, contractors had claimed much of the parking for their cleanup staging area. I eventually found a safe spot, tucked my car away, and made my way to Bay Park, which has been beautifully rebuilt over the last couple of years.

With temperatures in the low 70s and a refreshing breeze, the day couldn’t have been better. Walking over a small bridge that stretches across a kayaker's canal, I found myself in the lush, landscaped park overlooking Sarasota Bay. Locals were out enjoying the park, and I even stumbled upon a Hawaiian hula dance class and a yoga session on the grassy lawn. Passing through the park, I stopped by the Sarasota Garden Club, a favorite spot of mine. Usually, the garden is a vibrant showcase of colors, scents, and life, carefully tended by passionate club members. Today, though, signs of the hurricanes were all too clear—the vibrant garden had been stripped bare. Yet, resilient blooms still stood tall amidst the brown and broken remnants, small symbols of hope pushing through the devastation.

I continued my walk, making my way downtown, admiring elegant townhouses and new condo towers that now line the streets. The Sarasota Farmers Market was in full swing, buzzing with people and filled with the aroma of fresh produce and the sights of colorful stalls. With only two major produce vendors today, most booths featured natural oils, local plants, and wellness products. Pets joined the fun too, with a Halloween costume contest drawing creative dog owners and their costumed companions. One of these Saturdays, I may bring my own Chihuahua, Yoda, though he’s a bit impatient with other dogs.

The market felt like a small escape, and new eateries and cafes nearby caught my attention, especially those focusing on healthy, gluten-free, and vegetarian options. I’ll have to come back soon to try a few. After a while, I made my way down toward Bay Front Park, where the Marina Jack boat slips hold sailboats and yachts. Though parts of the park were still fenced off for hurricane recovery, the beauty of the bay—now showing hints of its former vibrant blue—was beginning to return, slowly but surely.

On my way back, I stopped at a small café called Bare Blends, where I tried a Coffee Climb Smoothie—a rich blend of cauliflower, banana, almond butter, cacao nibs, chocolate protein, and coffee. It was as delicious as it was energizing, and all vegan and gluten-free, which made it an even better choice. Sipping my smoothie, I noticed even more new high-rises and businesses, giving the downtown a fresh, vibrant energy.

As I crossed back over the Bay Bridge, I couldn’t help but notice the shifting shades of blue returning to Sarasota Bay, as the water gradually clears from the murky brown left behind by the storms. Passing through St. Armands Circle, the damage was still visible—bent signs, uprooted oaks, and scattered debris waiting to be cleared. But businesses were open, and people were out, embracing their community and reclaiming what these storms had temporarily taken.

I then drove onto Longboat Key, where the damage hit a little harder. Walking down streets lined with debris and belongings waiting for pickup, my heart ached for the families piecing their lives back together. Yet, even here, the spirit of resilience was alive—a shared determination to restore the charm of our beautiful coast.

Back home in Bayshore Gardens, Yoda greeted me at the door, tail wagging and ready for his walk. As we stepped out, I felt gratitude for the community and beauty surrounding us. Despite the devastation, there’s a profound blessing in seeing the strength that emerges in the face of such trials—a reminder of our responsibility to care for this world and cherish the beauty we’re lucky enough to call home.",0,1730046871.0,WritingWithAI,0,0.5,False

It takes me ages to fall asleep. Even as an INFANT my parents said it took me an unusually long period of time to fall asleep.

In high school I had to drink 2 cans of monster every single day to stay awake for my morning classes, or I would nod off sitting in my desk.

Was diagnosed with ADHD about 5 years ago and prescribed Adderal, and that was a game changer, for about 3 years, and now it's effects are wearing off.

I have to drink 3 cups of coffee every morning along with my Adderal or I feel like utter garbage. Even sleeping 8-9 hours a night.

The main issue is I feel like something is causing it, but doctors seem to not care. It took pulling teeth to even get a sleep test done, and I was told ""you have a little bit of sleep apnea, but it should not be making you this tired"".

Not even 35, and I feel like I'm 90. 

I was tired a lot as a kid, but at least I had some energy. I have none anymore.

I also go through random spells where my entire fucking body hurts all over, feeling like I've been hit by a truck. Been tested for inflammatory markers, arthritis, nothing found.

Since so many illnesses can make you tired, doctors don't really want to test you for all of them. 

A lot of them just say ""oh you are depressed"" and throw pills at me. I'm not depressed. 

I have no idea what it is, but it's apparent it's been life long. A lot of this stuff develops later in life.

1gdet13,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gdet13,"Good morning- Time to have a weekend chat - general practitioner Dr appointment,  hatred/fear of trans success and thoughts about the upcoming election in the USA","Good morning peeps! I’m sitting out on my patio having a cup of coffee in my boxer shorts with my dogs sitting next to me. It’s 68 degrees this morning in Phoenix AZ. It was a very busy week at work. I’m a senior claims adjuster. Normally it’s a very busy and stressful job but I’m training on 6 other high risk insurance policies so I have to juggle my normal inventory, as well as, my training schedule. My weekdays are long and tedious. Plus my “job” of adulting and running my household which takes time and attention. Blahhh and Arghhh!

I went to see a general practitioner for a doctor’s appointment for physical. I saw them a couple of weeks ago but it was more of an intake thing. I told the nurse I’ve had GCS surgery. She then asked where I had been shot. I guess that surgery is called GCS. Even though I think it’s a better story, I explained what GCS was - gender confirmation surgery- I told her to put it in my chart that I’m transgender to avoid any stupid questions or comments from the staff in the future. I hate stupid questions and comments about me being transgender.

So I have my follow up appointment yesterday at this doctor’s office. Again, I tell the nurse that I’m transgender and to put it in my chart so the doctor doesn’t ask me stupid questions or make stupid comments to me about being transgender. The nurse asked “what kind of questions were you asked?” And I said “All kinds of stupid shit! I don’t put up with stupidity in my normal life, why should I come here and put up with it.” She kind of smiled and went on her way. 

So had my normal middle aged bloke physical and everything went swimmingly as the doctor didn’t try it feel my prostrate and have me turn my head and cough. I asked if I could have my HRT done through his office and he said yes and that he would add a PSI and hemastat test to my blood panel. PSI test has to do with testing a prostrate. I said “I don’t have a prostrate I’m transgender. I told the nurse to add that to my chart to avoid stupid questions.” That threw him for a loop. I went across the hall for my blood test. He went into his office and closed his door for a few minutes. He came back looking very shaken and asked stupid questions and made a stupid of which I gave him stupid answers and stupid push back. He said “okay so you are a female to male transgender person?” I confirmed. “I would have never known.” I said “Well, I’m not wearing a Halloween custom.” He said “I’ve taken the PSI test off the blood panel.” I said “you can do whatever you want you’re the doctor.” Then he ran back to his office and came to me “What name do you go by?” I said “I go by my first name, what name do you go by?” That caused him to run back to his office not to be seen again. You can’t make this shit up! 

My elderly mom called me last night. I hate taking to her on the phone. She’s GOP Qanon and tells me the most ridiculous crap over the phone. She starts by preaching to me like I’m a little kid, I’m a 55 year old male, and then starts rambling about how Jesus is coming back in my life time, the economy is a disaster and the apocalypse is near and I better be prepared. It’s Saturday night, I’m single (I had a hard week of “dating” on dating apps), I’ve enjoyed some cocktails, I have YouTube watching puppy videos playing in the background and I’m roasting vegetables in my air fryer to freeze in single portions for next week’s ramen dishes and I’m trying to relax as life is short - I don’t want her nonsense in my head. Then she talks constantly about how she doesn’t have a pension and has to work. 

The truth is when I bought my house 5 years ago she hated the idea of a transgender person being successful. I should say more successful than her as she is a cisgender straight Christian woman. I’m a Buddhist trans man that is pansexual. She’s always has had this idea that because I’m transgender/queer I lack intelligence, good morals and way to heaven - on her hierarchy of people - I’m sub human as I don’t have the right to decide my own destiny in regards to my body, my path to happiness or my future (which is what abortion rights are about). As a sub human I also lack the right to basic medical care and a right to be free from discrimination. I’ve worked hard in my profession, I transitioned in the corporate world of Atlanta GA which is no joke and I’ve been very very thrifty all my life. I found a cheap fixer upper in Phoenix AZ in a great location. A couple of other houses in the development were selling for cheap so I offered to go in with my mom and buy a few houses and sit on them and sell them for a profit in a few years. Had she done that with me she would have been a millionaire by now. The reason she didn’t want to go into business with me then was because of the fore a mentioned reasons. Her loss! Who’s the stupid one now! 

Ok peeps it’s election time - if there’s one election to vote in it’s this one. Voting is confidential so you can do what you want in the voting stall. Lie, cheat and steal to get there but be honest in the voting stall - your life depends on it. So remember if the worst happens we have already survived the worst with Trump. It’ll likely be a mixed bag politically, as always, after the elections. Some  GOP people can be violent so always read the room! There’s no shame in leaving one small battle in order to fight the good fight! As always - love yourself deeply! ",23,1730046333.0,FTMOver30,4,0.9,False

If stimulant medication 'fixes' us (temporarily), my hypothesis is to give the body a stimulant detox to increase sensitivity. Self-medicated for 12 years with nicotine and caffeine. After I finally quit smoking in 2020, fell into a deep depression (highly functioning now, regardless). I've had insomnia since puberty. Some therapists claim ADHD is nothing more than a sleep deficit. I've been trying and failing all variations of the carnivore diet for the past year now. Sugarfree diet during the past few years helped tremendously (lasted max 3 months) (thrice 🏆) but fell of the wagon each time (family: alcohol, friends: drugs, work/events: sugar) (excuses excuses).

GOAL: 1 month (maybe 2)
- heal ADHD / PCOS
- clear face
- lose 5kg in 2 months (I'm 65kg/1.69m)

💡 Plan: gradual transition to zero carb:

- Today: Last day of caffeine (yerba mate) (house is a pigstall 🐖 without caffeine)

- Tonight: dunkin & burger king (34th bday 🎈) (ok it's a binge let's be honest) (excuses)

- Tomorrow: 4L Raw milk detox tomorrow (gut)

- Tuesday: Kimchi and Lemon Water (liver) and carnivore food

- Wednesday: carnivore diet (zero carb) -> Daily: Eggs, ground beef, steak -> Weekly treat: smoked salmon, (raw) cheese, sashimi on Friday, bone broth if I feel less reactive to it's histamines.

PLAN B: if all else fails (period, work-related stress, hypo, depression, excuses)

- Animal based à la Saladino is OK occasionally (preferably in the evenings cause I crash after carbs and become emotionally unstable/zero productivity) Fruit (bloats my belly, but still) + raw honey (it's the only sugar I can't binge on) + raw cacao (= a plant, I know) in butter if cravings hit hard.",0,1730046194.0,ADHD,4,0.25,False

1gdep96,https://www.reddit.com/r/beauty/comments/1gdep96/beauty_without_overconsumption/,Beauty without overconsumption. ,"I find it’s so overwhelming to constantly be peddled new products and trends on a weekly basis. 

I think we could discuss some things we do that either don’t involve purchasing or alternatives to commercial beauty products of services. I’ll start with ones I personally use.

- Henna, you can get a big bag of it at your local Middle Eastern / Asian / Ethnic foods market or online. I’ve been tinting my brows and lashes with it since I was a teenager instead of going to the salon. 

- Eyebrow mapping, you can find a guide online, but learning to do your brows yourself saves so much money, especially if you’re like me and your brows grow in fast. 

- You do not need a lip mask, let alone one from a luxury brand. Vaseline or petroleum jelly on top of your cream or lip balm to seal in moisture works just as well. 

- You do not need a cream blush if you have a lipstick in a shade you like for blush, you do not need a highlighter if you have a shimmery skin toned eyeshadow, you do not need a transition shade if you have a bronzer. 

- Coffee grinds, sugar or salt as exfoliators in with your body wash or an oil. I have never bought an exfoliator for my body in my 21 years on this planet because I just use my coffee grinds and olive oil.

- A good oil or Shea butter can be used in many ways, as a barrier when dying hair or using henna or sunless tanning. as a moisturiser, deep oiling treatment for your hair, oil pulling for your teeth etc. there’s so many uses.

These are just some I’ve been using since I was a teenager. Hopefully this helps, please don’t take offence if you enjoy engaging in trends and innovation in the beauty space, there’s plenty of conversation for that but I just wanna open a space for the people on a budget of who aren’t interested in that :)))

- You do not need to buy any hair rinses or clarifying rinse or scalp oil, You can infuse rosemary or any potent herb you like into oil using a ban-Marie, the same with some apple cider vinegar or water for a clarifying rinse.

1gdeos4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DietingChristian/comments/1gdeos4/100/,100%,"Friday I wrote about picking a verse to quote regularly to fight temptation, Saturday, I wrote about picking a prayer to pray regularly to fight temptation. Today is activities. New activities are vital to replace habits, but are often frustrating because they are “Not what we want to do.”

First, we need to be tough and do them anyway, or quitting will never happen. Consider praying:

“Father, help me to increase toughness, help me enjoy these new things.”

Second, we either do the new activity with God, without God, or somewhere in the middle.

Let's assume the new activity is doing a crossword while drinking coffee instead of snacking with coffee.

To do the activity 100% with God, fully repent of all sin before the activity. Plan how to go to war with habits before the activity.

Third, interact with God during the activity. The Bible tells us to praise the Lord. The Bible says to give thanks. Whenever you are bored say: “Praise the Lord.” Whenever you are frustrated say, “Thank you Lord.” Whenever you are tempted, quote your quitting verse, then pray your quitting prayer.

In this example it may work like magic, but, if you are by yourself with your new hobby of learning the guitar, it will help a lot, but, it will still be a challenge. But, if you keep at it, you will start to find a bit of peace, and maybe even a bit of fun.

Fourth, notice how all of these techniques work together. If you are not doing the first one (Bible verses), the third one will be really hard to pull off. If you are not doing the second one (Prayer), you may even lose interest in trying to do the third one correctly.

Fifth, I recommend starting with Friday (Quoting the Bible verse), until that is a habit. Then, Saturday, praying your prayer, until that is a habit. Then, trying to do new activities God's way, until that is a habit.

Finally, most people will stop and start, forget to do this, decide to give up on it mid-day, and be confused for 100 reasons. That is normal. Simply start again, try again, work on habits again. If you are 100% dedicated to learning these habits, you now have something to think about and focus on 100% of the time.",1,1730046024.0,DietingChristian,0,1.0,False

There is something tactually satisfying about holding a print book, a magazine, or a newspaper in your hands, and thumbing through it casually. I didn't even mind the smeared ink on my fingers after spending a quite Sunday morning perusing the massive NEW YORK TIMES back in the day.

Now, print publications are nearly as rare as an honest politician. The long newsstands you would find in drug stores or busy city streets, have given way to tiny wire racks hanging next to the gum and mints at grocery store checkouts. \*sigh\*

That is why it is so wonderful to report that a few print survivors remain. And joyfully, one is local and aimed at the LGBTQ+ community in our state. I'm talking about [**BETWEEN THE LINES**](https://pridesource.com/about-pride-source).

[BETWEEN THE LINES \(Oct. 3, 2024\)](https://preview.redd.it/5qrkj1foqbxd1.jpg?width=610&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8bc324cf80b557c9ed4a610de1b62cb6a490c28e)

Founded in 1993 by New York publisher Mark Weinstein, **BETWEEN THE LINES (BTL)** is a free weekly newspaper that is, [***""the largest and longest-running LGBTQ+ publication in Michigan. Our print edition is published every other Thursday and we are available for free pickup at over 600 locations throughout the state.""***](https://pridesource.com/about-pride-source)

Even if you've never read it, you've probably seen copies in news boxes or sitting on a counter at your local coffee shop. While headquartered in my hometown of Ann Arbor, [**BTL is distributed to over 600 locations throughout the state**](https://pridesource.com/find-a-copy)**.**

Understandably, BTL casts a wide net in its news coverage for the LGBTQ+ community as a whole. Articles, features, and news items include the entire queer spectrum, of which, transgender issues are just one part.

One notable trans-related story by **Ellen Shanna Knoppow**, won the 2022 NLGJA (the leading LGBTQ+ journalists association) award (for **Excellence in Transgender Coverage**): [***“How Two Detroit Ballroom Godmothers Made Sure VICE Got the Whole Story About Murdered Trans Woman Kelly Stough.”***](https://pridesource.com/article/detroit-ballroom-godmothers)

Physically, BTL has beautiful graphics. It's colorful layouts, gorgeous photography and the keen editing, visually showcase the professionalism behind the scenes. The overall quality of the publication is equivalent to any national paper on the market.

The publishers of BTL have neglected the reach of the internet, though. There is an online version under the name of[ **PRIDE SOURCE**](https://pridesource.com/), which instead of being an online reprint of BTL, is more like a daily newspaper. It carries  current events and news items and has the advantage of immediacy that its print cohort lacks.

If you haven't yet an opportunity to read an issue of BTL, I suggest you head on over to PRIDE SOURCE and the [**""Download BTL""**](https://pridesource.com/download-btl) page, which allows you to get a pdf version of archived issues for free. Can't beat the price!

I should mention, though, that [**subscriptions to BTL are available**](https://pridesource.com/subscribe). It's worth it and they could use your support.

Next time you're waiting on your skim milk latte with an extra shot of espresso at your local coffee establishment, pick up the latest issue of **BEHIND THE LINES** you see over on the counter. You won't be disappointed.

I'm still getting through the game, and will update accordingly.

**Acquisition:** If you use a VPN to change your location to the Philippines or Australia, you will likely be able to download the early access game, there is a chance you might need to do extra verification with a credit card, but won't need to spend a dollar. (Mine automatically changed location with the VPN without any further verification).

**Initial impressions:** Very cute! Not too different, but it's also looking quite new! Of course, the game *is* in it's beta stages, so stick around till the end of the post for features that it doesn't yet have that makes gameplay a little more challenging. There is a sense of continuation (A pizza loving city is mentioned) and a lot of the same characters come to your store. Some storyline elements are already in the game!

**Differences/new features:** One thing I noticed is that the first few days are a lot easier, the day timer doesn't show up so you can take as long as you need to fulfil a set number of orders, and customer's happiness meters don't go down yet. You also have the Mypad from the start (though of course it doesn't have a lot of apps on it yet). What else is cool is that some characters (Not all, the important ones) will sit in your store with *animation* for drinking coffee. There is a cutscene between two characters where it zooms in on the two sitting, and you tap for each of their speech bubbles. Interestingly, this game lets you set a name, and all the characters will call you by it instead of just ""Ovenist"" or ""Brewist"". The game also shows speech lines for your character instead of just implying what you said like in GPGP. Lastly, there is a drawing feature on lattes (Can't wait to see what artists make with it). There is a cap on how many days you can do at once. Each level up will give you 10 tokens, 1 to be spent on each game day. You will also get 1 new token every hour. The game also doesn't count days, but levels, which will get harder and harder to level up.

**Things expected but not yet available:** Of course the game is still in beta, and I haven't gotten to the point to buy a lot of the upgrades, but here's what it's lacking so far: There's minimal upgrades (2 for each for 2 different pieces of equipment), still unclear what they do. There's no way to get gems yet apart from spending money (No sponsors section on the mypad) however you can watch ads for more tokens to play more days. There is not yet a section to sign in with a tapblaze account, perhaps that is coming after beta. Decorations are cool, but minimal, each section has about 3-4 different decorations, and of course there's no seasonal events or decorations yet. I also find the customer happiness meter to decline quite fast, and your coffee glitches if you don't put the components in the right order (or perhaps that's part of the difficulty of the game)

Opinions on the game if you've tried it? Excited try it if it's not yet available to you?
