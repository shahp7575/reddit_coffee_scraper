1km2ga7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1km2ga7/i_think_i_destroyed_the_best_friendship_ive_ever/,"I think I destroyed the best friendship I’ve ever had, and no one knows why — because I can’t tell them I’m in love with him","We met when we were 13. Both new to the neighborhood, both angry about it. My parents had moved us from a city I loved, and his had just finalized a divorce that split him between households. I still remember him standing in the middle of the cul-de-sac, throwing a baseball against a garage wall over and over like he wanted to break something. I asked if I could try. He shrugged and handed me the ball.

That’s how it started.

From middle school through college, we were inseparable. People joked we shared a brain. We got into the same university, picked dorms next to each other, joined the same clubs, dated in the same circles — but never overlapped. Never once. There was an unspoken line we both knew existed, even if we didn’t talk about it.

He’s straight. That’s what I told myself. I *have* to believe he’s straight.

After college, we moved in together. It was supposed to be temporary, while we figured things out. But three years passed. We built routines: groceries together, late-night walks, Sunday morning coffees in silence. I learned all his tells. I knew when he was about to spiral, when he was lying about being fine, when he needed space but wouldn’t ask for it.

He dated women. I stayed quiet. I dated too, briefly, but I could never bring anyone around him. It always felt wrong. He used to joke that no one would ever “get us” the way we got each other. I’d laugh. I wanted to scream.

Then came the night everything changed.

It was during the pandemic. We’d both been drinking. It wasn’t wild or messy — just the kind of drinking where everything feels louder and heavier. We were watching something dumb on TV, and he paused it mid-episode, looked at me, and said:

*""If I told you I think I’ve loved you for years and I’m scared sh*tless of what that means — what would you do?""\*

I laughed. I *thought* he was joking. He didn’t laugh.

I kissed him.

It was immediate. Quiet. Long. It felt like pressing a secret into someone’s skin and finally having it understood. He kissed me back. He didn’t stop. We slept in the same bed that night, fully clothed, just holding each other. I couldn’t even cry. It felt unreal.

The next morning, he was gone. Packed a bag, left a note: *“I’m sorry. I can’t lose you. And I think staying means I will.”*

That was 11 months ago. He moved out. He cut off almost everyone we shared. His parents think we fought about money. My parents think we argued about politics. Only I know the truth.

And now I’m left holding a secret so big it’s choking me. I dream about that night like it didn’t actually happen, like I made it up. I’ve replayed every second of our friendship, wondering if I missed the signs, or invented them.

I don’t know where he is. I don’t know if he hates me. I don’t even know if he remembers it the same way.

But I know that I have been in love with him for over a decade. And I don’t know how to live with that anymore.",3,1747183971.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Whether it’s your first time on the Farm or you’ve been radiating positivity since the Paul McCartney set, here’s a chaotic, heartfelt, slightly unhinged guide to the secrets, traditions, and inside jokes of Bonnaroo. I give you: The 45 Commandments of Roo.

⸻

THE ESSENTIALS
	1.	Left side of What Stage = Bees. Trust us bro. They’re vibing.
	2.	Free showers exist. Usually near Plaza 6. Go early or late.
	3.	The Christmas Barn is sacred chaos. Go at 3AM. Don’t ask questions.
	4.	Secret sets happen in Outeroo. Keep your ears open and your sandals ready.
	5.	You can play Magic the Gathering in The Grove. It’s real. It’s glorious.
	6.	The Centeroo fountain is for YOU. Wear a swimsuit, or don’t.
	7.	The Grove is the official nap sanctuary. Hammocks, shade, peace.
	8.	Bring stuff to trade. Stickers, bracelets, weird rocks. It’s the currency of kindness.
	9.	Plaza 1 has coffee and sometimes AC. Bless it.
	10.	The arch changes every year. Take your sunset pic like a proud Roo-goer.

⸻

THE DEEPER CUTS
	11.	The BonnaBoo Ghost is real. Appears at sunrise. Don’t disturb them.
	12.	Some campgrounds have 24/7 raves. Follow the beat, not the map.
	13.	Camp names get wild. “Camp Cunnilingus” was legendary. Go big.
	14.	People bring kiddie pools. Respectfully ask to dip your feet. Bring ice.
	15.	Roo Chutes = mud slides. Grab an air mattress. Regret nothing.
	16. Join in on the scavenger hunts. People hide cool stuff.
	17.	Walgreens has a freebie tent sometimes. Tampons, sunscreen, ChapStick—take it.
	18.	Portable showers are a scam. Solar bag + privacy tent = elite.
	19.	Artists walk around in disguise. Look for sunglasses + bandanas + vibes. (Tyler the Creator is known to walk around after his sets in disguise) 
	20.	Thursday sleeper sets are iconic. Even if you don’t know the artist—GO.
	21.	Sunrise gospel sets might emotionally wreck you. Bring tissues.
	22.	Make a meetup plan every morning. Cell service WILL die.
	23.	Mark your tent lines or eat dirt. Glow sticks save lives.
	24.	Glow-in-the-dark duct tape = tent identification heaven.
	25.	Hydration karma is real. Give water. Take water. Become the hydration fairy.

⸻

THE TRADITIONS & SUFFERING
	26.	Roo Baptism = midnight fountain dip. Bonus: in costume.
	27.	You will get sunburned. SPF 50. Reapply while sobbing to Hozier.
	28.	Losing your friends is part of it. So is finding new ones.
	29.	Poop at 6AM. Trust me. That’s the golden hour for port-a-potties.
	30.	There’s always one dude yelling “BONNAROO!!!” at 4AM. Hate him. Love him. Accept him. 
	31.	Don’t leave Sunday night. The traffic is biblical. Stay. Chill. Watch the sun rise.
	32.	The Day 3 slump is real. Power through. Sunday will save you.
	33.	If someone gives you a pickle, take it. This is not a drill.
	34.	3AM arch photos are elite. No line. All lights. Big vibes.
	35.	Roo dads are the backbone of the Farm. Befriend one. You won’t regret it.

⸻

THE CHAOS
	36.	Sneak snacks in sunscreen bottles or maxi pad wrappers. Security won’t check.
	37.	They don’t care about you smoking joints. Be chill. Be discreet. Don’t wave it around.
	38.	The Silent Disco is for flirting. Or weeping. Or both.
	39.	Hookups peak Thursday. By Sunday, we’re all goblins in glitter.
	40.	People get married at Roo. Real, legal, full glitter-cannon weddings.
	41.	The “Where’s My Tent?” sign is a social hub. Leave notes. Meet weirdos.
	42.	There might be a naked slip n’ slide in Outeroo. You didn’t hear that here.
	43.	SuperJam will change you. No matter who plays. Show up.
	44.	If you hear someone say “trust me, it’s just over that hill”… it’s not.
	45.	And finally… radiate positivity. This place runs on weirdness, kindness, and sweat. You are part of the magic now.

lthough bring bi, I only had experiences with men to the point I was just going with the flow and not enjoying in. It was me forcing myself to date men.

Anyway, that made me curious to finally try with a woman. I've always been scared to talk to girls due to school bullying and with some trauma related to my mom (very religious and homophobic). Anyway, spent a few months in therapy and it finally felt safe to just be myself.

I had my first date with a girl today. I had absolutely no expectations and was feeling very down (for more context, I had a date with this same girl last Friday but she didn't come to the date and we didn't talk much through text, didn't feel much chemistry between us). ANYWAY, she had asked for us to meet today so she could pay me a milkshake because she forgot the date.

Guys it was actually awesome. In the end, she was just very shy and she felt awkward about being into anime and Tumblr fandoms. 

She asked me to get a coffee with her and go to her house. She lives alone and she said she had a very comfy bed for us.

Walked in the today and guess what? No more blue-haired baristas whining about ‘safe spaces’ or wearing a dozen pronoun pins. Looks like they either quit or were told to shape up. Heard a manager flat out say, 'If you don’t like it, there’s the door.' Love it.

These days, I can’t tell one barista from the next — no piercings, no rainbow flags, just green aprons and quiet service. And honestly? That’s how it should be. I’m not there for a political lecture or someone's identity crisis — I’m there for a coffee. I don’t need to know their life story, just get my drink right.

And let me tell you, the woke garbage is disappearing fast — no more pride cups, no more rainbow merch shoved in my face, and rumor has it they’re even putting out straight pride mugs and patriotic designs. About time someone catered to the majority for once!

No drag shows, no handouts, no free squatting in the lobbies. You pay, you stay — simple as that. Feels good to walk in and not feel like I’m in some activist headquarters.

Stock’s climbing again, too. Funny how that works when you stop shoving DEI down everyone’s throat. Maybe the CEO’s finally waking up and realizing that going WOKE really does mean going BROKE.

I’m holding out hope Starbucks turns into the next Chick-fil-A or even Arby’s — play some country music, put Fox News on the screen, and let the libs squirm. I’ll be sipping my coffee with a side of liberal tears. Let’s make Starbucks great again!""**",0,1747183731.0,starbucks,2,0.42,False

ELLIE

I think being the only single person in a group of friends made up entirely of happy couples who have a lot of sex was affecting me, making me think it was time to find the right guy.

Not that I was really looking; I’d just promised myself not to go out with any more bastards or womanizers after everything I’d been through.

But that’s when the problem started—or rather, that’s when the problem walked through the door.

Ben’s younger brother, Ethan, walked into Zoe and Ben’s apartment during one of our gatherings, which involved drinking a lot of alcohol and catching up.

I hadn’t heard much about him. All I knew was that he ran the London office and was returning. Anna should have told me he was... *like that.*

Just by looking at him, I’d say he was the kind of guy I called a Wolf Charming. That was my antithesis to Prince Charming, who, in my mind, was what I didn’t want but probably should want. But I always thought Prince Charmings were too perfect and, consequently, boring.

The Wolf Charming was my ideal type—the kind who has wild sex with you and takes you roughly, but who has that charming side and treats you like a princess the rest of the time.

That was the impression the tall, broad-shouldered man with dark blonde hair gave me when he walked into the room, dressed in a suit on a Saturday. He looked too elegant and at the same time fierce and virile.

“Wolf Charming?” I whispered to Anna as we moved closer to greet him with the rest of the group.

Anna, my best friend, was probably the main reason I had this idea of finding the right guy stuck in my head.

Not that she had told me to do it, but simply because she was married to Will, the hottest and sexiest tattooed ex-player and nerd I had ever met. They were perfect together.

I was still trying to convince the two of them to donate some of Will’s DNA, so I could clone him in a lab. I always say it’s unfair that there’s only one Will. Anna hit the jackpot, and of course, so did Will.

“Bastard Charming, from what I’ve heard from Will,” she whispered back.

My smile faded instantly. Not that I judged before getting to know someone—I didn’t do that; I hated stereotypes and typification as a good scientist should—but hearing that would put any smart woman on guard.

In recent months, I’d worked hard to stay away from any womanizers, bastards, and players in New York.

Swallowing the last sip of beer, I leaned forward, placing the bottle on the coffee table before it was my turn to greet the man with striking light brown eyes. He was a good twenty centimeters taller than me, even in heels.

My stomach churned as I forced a smile in response to his, which revealed perfect teeth.

*Damn... he’s fucking gorgeous.*

I blinked, trying to snap out of the trance.

“Nice to meet you, Ethan. I’m Ellie. Welcome back to New York,” I said, offering my hand while my heart pounded in my chest.

I ignored that, along with the shiver that ran down my spine. Maybe it was because everyone around us was staring with some strange expectation, as if something screamed, two single people in the room, not just me as always.

“Nice to meet you, Ellie.” He shook my hand firmly.

I tried to ignore the quick once-over he gave me, spending way too much time focusing on my breasts. I pulled back as soon as he let go of my hand.

Ben, Will, and Jack gathered on the sofas after Ethan’s arrival, and I pulled Anna into the kitchen for another drink.

“His eyes are just like Ben’s,” she commented.

Yeah, those brown eyes were hypnotic.

“So is the reputation, I mean, before he married Zoe,” I said, making us both laugh. “But don’t let her know I brought that up. She’d eat me alive.”

Zoe and Bennett, or simply Ben, were another couple in my group of friends who were probably influencing me, though I think in a slightly *different* way than Anna and Will.

That’s because both of them were assholes who fell in love before they could kill each other. I don’t know how they’re still alive, maybe because they took out all their anger on each other through sex.

“He checked out your boobs,” Anna said as we entered the kitchen.

Stifling a laugh, she leaned against the island while I got busy opening two beers.

“You managed to notice that? I thought it was in a split second.”

“I think everyone noticed.”

“Ugh! Why was everyone staring?”

“Maybe because you’re the only singles in the room? That makes it interesting to watch when you’re married.”

“Do you really need to remind me? And it’s not like anything’s going to happen between us.”

“I know, I know. No scumbags, bastards, or womanizers. I’ve been hearing that for over a year now?”

“And you’ll keep hearing it until I find the right guy.” I handed her one of the beer bottles.

“To the right guy! May he show up soon!” She raised her bottle, proposing a toast, forcing me to do the same. “And end your bad mood with lots of sex!” she concluded.

“Hey! What bad mood?”

“Excuse me!” The deep voice sounded before he entered the kitchen.

His presence alone was enough to make me uncomfortable.

“Mind if I find Ben’s wine stash?” he asked, making Anna turn to face him.

“I’ll help you,” she offered, guiding him to the wall-mounted wine rack behind me.

I took a long sip of my beer, getting lost in my own thoughts as they discussed wines behind me.

“What do you Morgans take? I know Bennett goes to the gym almost every day, but nothing justifies you growing that much, not just in height,” Anna suddenly said, nearly making me spit out my beer.

God! She, as always, with no filter. I heard him let out a low laugh.

“You’re the scientist, right? Then you can explain genetics.”

“I think there are some things that even scientists like us can’t explain, right, El?” she said, forcing me to turn to them.

“Of course! Whatever you’re talking about, I’m with you.”

“So, you’re also a scientist?” He raised an eyebrow at me.

“Yes, more of a researcher these days.”

“I admit, I had a very different image of scientists in mind,” he said, not bothering to hide the way his eyes moved over my body, leaving me uneasy.

# Chapter 02: Is That a No?

ELLIE

*Shit, Ellie, focus.* He’s definitely not the right guy; he’s more like the completely wrong guy.

I blinked, trying to remember what he had just said.

“Let me guess... White lab coat, glasses, test tubes, and a total nerd?” I raised an eyebrow.

He nodded.

“Something like that.”

“Don’t be fooled. We spend ninety percent of the time dressed exactly like that,” Anna said. “But even now, the nerdiness remains.”

That’s right. That’s my girl.

“You just forgot to mention that we wear high heels,” I added, winking at her.

Ethan sighed.

“That’s the closest you got to making the image of a scientist sexy. Well, thanks for the help, Anna. Finish what you’re doing and join us; it’ll be the first time I’ve had the chance to talk nonsense in front of two scientists,” he said before leaving.

“What the hell was that?” I asked, frowning.

“What?”

“‘What do you take?’”

“It was just curiosity. The man is... huge!”

“As if that’s uncommon and Will isn’t just as big or bigger.”

“Well, Will is... Will.” She shrugged.

“Great argument.”

“What I mean is that Will works out a lot and runs regularly.”

“What I mean is that your question sounded like flirting. It’s obvious he spends a lot of time at the gym.”

“I’m married; it couldn’t have sounded like flirting.”

“You’re terrible!” I laughed.

“I was just trying to be nice.”

“I get it. Where were we?”

“I think we were praying for your ideal guy to show up so you can have lots of sex?”

“You make me sound desperate.”

“I know you’re not. But you really do need to get laid.”

“Just because you have sex every day doesn’t mean everyone else has to. People do other... things.”

“You don’t have to do it every day, at least once a month, but never once a year.”

“What are you getting at?”

“You tell me... How long has it been?”

“That’s enough.”

*A year? Maybe more. It was with that lawyer I met through work. He was hot but too busy. A shame.*

“You’re trying to remember, aren’t you?”

“This conversation is over. My sex life isn’t important when all the available men are bastards.”

“Don’t forget Will and Ben’s past. I don’t forget. So there’s still hope. Sometimes a bastard just needs to discover love.”

“Thanks, but I don’t want to be the reason any bastard changes. And Will and Ben were always good men. Sleeping with lots of people doesn’t make you a bastard. Only when you lie and deceive.”

“I wouldn’t bet on them,” she said, surprising me.

“We’re talking about your husband.”

“I know.”

I blinked, considering it for a moment.

“Come to think of it... neither would I,” I agreed, making us burst into laughter.

“He checked out your ass,” she said when we stopped laughing, making me frown in confusion.

“Huh?”

“Twice, and he lingered the second time when he thought I wasn’t looking.”

“What are you trying to say?”

“He was analyzing you, first your boobs, and now your ass. I’d say he liked it.”

“Why are we still talking about this? The guy has a history.”

“He’s hot. And maybe... if you just wanted to...”

“Don’t continue. I’m not interested in anything superficial. I think I have to repeat...”

“Okay, okay. No bastards, womanizers, or players.”

“Great.”

“But why not have some fun until you find the right guy?”

I sighed. She knew why.

“I’m never letting anyone use me just for sex again. I respect that there are people who enjoy that, but it doesn’t work for me anymore. You know what happened last time.”

“Seven months wasted with a guy who couldn’t be honest with you and didn’t have the guts to say he wasn’t interested in anything more than sex, while you fell deeper and deeper for him.”

“Yeah. I wasted my time. So, enough of this topic.”

“Okay. Sorry.”



It was past ten. It was time to leave. Jack and Zara were already heading out. They were another one of my couples of friends.

What to say about the two of them? Eccentric? Overly romantic? They made my heart warm just watching them. The way Jack treated Zara as the object of all his dedication and affection.

There were also two more couples I saw less often but loved just as much. The most recent of all, Anna’s brother, Jason, and his English girlfriend, Phillipa. And Jack’s brother, Neil, and his also English girlfriend, Rosie, who was a friend of Phillipa.

It was really hard not to feel a little envious of each of these couples' stories, being the only single one in the group. And maybe that’s why I was starting to feel like I was stranded at twenty-seven.

Poking Anna on the couch, I pointed to the empty beer bottles that had accumulated on the coffee table.

“Let’s take them to the kitchen,” I suggested.

“Don’t bother,” Zoe said, slightly tipsy from the drinks, leaning against her husband’s chest on the couch in front of us.

""Don’t worry, we’ll take care of it,"" Ben added.

""Don’t be so nice. We already know you’re not that nice in reality,"" I said, making everyone laugh.

""I’ll help you,"" Ethan said, standing up. ""Anna can focus on figuring out how to get Will home,"" he teased.

I nodded, getting up as well.

""I’m fine. You’ll see that during our run tomorrow,"" Will said, grinning as he pulled Anna closer. ""I’ve still got plenty of energy to burn tonight,"" he insinuated.

""Oh, God!"" I muttered, picking up four bottles, two in each hand.

Zoe and Ben laughed as I headed to the kitchen, hearing Ethan walk behind me, making me uncomfortable.

I really didn’t want to witness the foreplay of two couples.

""Are you sure it’s a good idea to go running with Will tomorrow? The man’s a machine,"" I tried to make conversation, attempting to avoid an awkward silence as I placed the bottles on the kitchen island.

""It wouldn’t be the first time. I’ve known Will for a long time. We’ve done a lot of runs in London during his visits.""

""Of course. You also think it’s normal to wake up before ten on a Sunday to work out. How could I not have noticed?"" I said, sarcastically.

""Don’t you like exercising? I mean... you seem pretty fit to me.""

I tried to ignore the idea that this might be flirting.

""Thanks. I go to the gym whenever work allows. But waking up at seven on a Sunday? I’ll pass,"" I said, turning to look at him, meeting his eyes for the first time since I shook his hand.

Bad idea. The man had a perfect face that made me feel awkward. His jaw seemed to have been sculpted by the gods themselves.

Looking away, I busied myself organizing the bottles he placed on the island, lining them up with mine.

""I see. So, you don’t mind a bit of cardio after ten?"" he asked.

""I guess so.""

""Great, because it’s almost eleven.""

""What?"" I looked up at him, not understanding.

""Looks like we’re the only ones here who won’t be having sex tonight.""

""I think I got lost at the part about cardio after ten, but you’ll get used to it. It’s just part of having only married friends.""

""You really didn’t get what I meant?"" A mischievous smile appeared on his face.

""Should I have? Maybe it’s the alcohol.""

""You said you don’t mind doing cardio after ten... It’s almost eleven, and I have an idea for some cardio we could do together,"" he articulated, making me blink.

""Wait... are you? Did you just meet me and are doing what I think you’re doing?""

""Is that a no?"" He raised an eyebrow.

# Chapter 3: What a Bastard!

ELLIE

God! What a bastard! He had to be joking.

“Of course, it's a no! Absolutely not.” I declared, feeling a mix of anger and frustration. “Good night!” I snarled, rolling my eyes as I walked past him.

What an asshole.

Back in the living room, I grabbed my bag from a side table.

“I’m leaving. Thanks for tonight. Love you guys,” I said, heading towards the door.

“Is everything okay?” Anna asked, standing up.

I turned, seeing Ethan return from the kitchen.

“Of course, see you tomorrow.” I forced a smile at the group sitting on the couch before heading out the door.

✽

I woke up around eight, much earlier than planned. I really hated waking up before ten on a Sunday. The thought reminded me of the conversation with the bastard last night.

The asshole had the nerve to ask me to have sex after two minutes of conversation. Unbelievable! All that beauty with character would be asking too much, Ellie. What a shame...

Still in bed, I sent a message to Anna, asking if she was still asleep. She replied right away, inviting me for breakfast. I remembered that Will was probably out running with the bastard. I really didn’t want to run into him.

After getting up, I took a shower and dressed for the late winter cold.

Anna lived just a few blocks away, which allowed me to walk over and visit her whenever possible. She had only been married for two years and had picked out the apartment with Will. I was extremely happy to have my best friend living nearby.

She opened the door as soon as I knocked, wearing a sweatsuit.

“It’s fucking cold out there, isn’t it?” She asked, taking my coat.

After hanging it up, she came back to hug me.

“You have no idea.”

“Will’s crazy to run during winter mornings.”

“And yet you still married him.”

“What’s a little craziness compared to those rock-hard abs?” She winked.

“You’re right, as always.”

“I’ll get the hot chocolate. Want cookies or something else?”

“Cake?”

“Yes. Chocolate? Will made a delicious one yesterday morning.”

“Please! Besides the rock-hard abs, the man cooks! God! Who do I need to make a deal with to get one of those?” I threw myself onto the couch, crossing one leg over the other. She laughed from the adjoining kitchen while preparing a tray. “This apartment seems more beautiful every time I come here.”

“Thank you. Here you go.” She said, placing the tray between us on the couch. “Now tell me why you ran out last night. We tried to get it out of Ethan, but he said nothing happened, and I know that’s a lie, I saw the way you looked at him before you left.”

“He just thought it was a good idea to ask me to have sex after two minutes of conversation.”

“He said he wanted to have sex with you?” She widened her eyes.

“It seemed to me that he had nothing better to do and thought I was available.”

“Or he thought you were hot and really wanted to have sex with you. Didn’t you think about accepting for even a second?”

“What? Of course not.”

I really hadn’t thought about it. Even though he was one of the most attractive men I’d ever met.

“You know... the man is...”

“A complete asshole!”

“Very hot.”

“Anna!” I scolded her.

“He is, but I know that’s not what you’re looking for.”

“I’m not looking for anything, I just know what I don’t want.”

“I know. I know. But it’s hard to believe you didn’t consider the idea for a second.”

“No. Not for a second. He was a complete jerk, he knows nothing about me.”

“You don’t find him attractive?”

Damn, she was making me think about him, something I was trying to avoid at all costs, but the image was quite clear in my mind.

“Why are you asking that when I’m telling you he acted like a bastard?”

“If he had made the offer after getting to know you better, would you have thought about accepting it?”

“That’s out of the question.”

“I see. You do find him very attractive.”

“This is ridiculous! Let’s change the subject.”

✽

I turned the corner and almost turned back if Will hadn’t spotted me as soon as I took a step. They were coming back from their run, dressed in heavy sweats and beanies.

Shit. *Be polite, it’s simple.*

“Looks like my wife’s already up,” Will said, stopping in front of me on the sidewalk before hugging me, making me stretch. “Good morning, El.”

“Good morning. We had breakfast together. Your cake was delicious.”

“Glad you liked it. I’ll make one, especially for you. I think I managed to teach Ethan a lesson at least.”

“What? I’m fine.” Ethan said from behind Will.

I ignored his presence as long as I could, but I had to face him and force a smile.

“Good morning,” I murmured.

“Good morning, Ellie.”

“Well, I’ve got to go. See you later, Will.”

I kept walking, leaving them behind. But I only managed to take a few more steps before hearing Ethan call my name.

I stopped, taking a deep breath before turning around. Just looking at his perfect face was enough to irritate me.

He was tall in a way that made me have to tilt my head up, and that only irritated me more.

“What do you want?” I asked.

“I almost believed everything was fine a minute ago. Ever thought about acting?”

He was wearing a black beanie that highlighted his square jaw.

“Do you have something to say to me, or are you just trying to annoy me?”

“Wow... Are you always this receptive?” His hands sank into his pockets.

“Only with assholes.”

“You’re pretty high-strung for a scientist.”

“Say what you want.”

“It seems you might have gotten a bad first impression of me.”

“Really? Why would you think that?” I said, using the maximum amount of sarcasm I could muster.

“Funny. What I mean is, that I didn’t mean to offend you with the invitation yesterday. Quite the opposite.”

“You didn’t offend me.”

“It didn’t seem that way.” He raised an eyebrow, skeptical. “Bennett told me it was a bad idea... but I accidentally overheard your friend saying you needed to get laid. So...”

“You were eavesdropping?”

""I was coming in and asked for permission right after. You said you weren’t offended, but you’re clearly upset with me.”

“What you did tells me about the kind of guy you are; it has nothing to do with me.”

“What kind of guy am I?”

“The kind I want to stay away from. Let’s do this... I’ll treat you politely because you’re Bennett’s brother, and because of that, we’ll probably run into each other around here. But that’s it. Have a nice life.” I turned to leave, but he kept talking.

“You’ve never had sex with someone you just met? Because I think you’re overreacting.”

“Forget it. You’re only managing to be an even bigger asshole.”

He kept following me.

“It was just an invitation for sex. You’re the one being crazy.”

“Forget it. Don’t you get it?” I turned back to him again.

“I was just trying to apologize.”

“For what? Do you think you did something wrong?”

“No. As I said, I didn’t mean to offend you.”

“You didn’t. So stop apologizing since you don’t feel guilty.”

“You’re still mad, and I don’t know why. I want to avoid conflicts since I just got back.”

You should have thought about that yesterday, asshole.

“There won’t be any conflict from my side.”

“Great.”

“Great. Goodbye!”

I walked away, leaving him behind.

✽

We had planned to have lunch together on Tuesday. When Anna and I arrived at the bar, Zoe and Ben were already waiting with Will, seated at a table in the corner.

Anna leaned in to kiss Will without any hesitation as we approached. I greeted everyone with a general “hi.”

“Is everything okay, El?” Will asked after a few minutes, noticing my silence while they chatted.

My mood was terrible this week, probably PMS.

“Just a headache.”

“Maybe my gift will help with that,” Zoe said, bending down and coming back up with two Victoria’s Secret bags.

She handed one to Anna and the other to me.

“It’s not my birthday or anything...” Anna said, confused as she opened the bag. “But thanks.” She pulled out the box and set it on the table as I thanked her.

“Wow! It’s... pink,” Anna said after opening the box and unwrapping a tiny pink lace lingerie set.

It barely covered any skin. Zoe laughed from the other side of the table. Will had a mischievous smile, and Bennett shook his head in disapproval, he did that a lot. Partly because he was grumpy, and partly because he disapproved of this kind of nonsense.

“That color really captures my personality,” Anna mocked as Will held up the pieces to inspect them.

“I think Will likes the gift more than you do,” Zoe said, laughing. “But what about you, Ellie? Aren’t you going to open yours?”

“I think this kind of gift makes perfect sense for Anna... But in my case, it’ll probably end up being eaten by moths in my closet.” I placed the box on the table.

“Shit...” Bennett muttered, making us all turn to look in the direction he was facing, at the restaurant entrance.

The two KB articles I wanna talk about are Stanchion Pet Board Guidelines and Apothecary and Register Guidelines. To cut tho what’s important: Pet photos are kinda coming back, under strict rules/time based rotations (possibly just limited to customers? idk) and beverages are going to be kept in the apoth cabinets, NOT on the counter.
I pose these questions to the HO muddies:

1. Do you guys have pet photos on your desks? Because that’s not allowed in stores! You wouldn’t be allowed to have the same photo up for longer than a month!
2. Do you keep personal belongings in your cubicles? Are you allowed to? Because our lockers are “day use” only! Do you clear out your desk each night?
3. Do you keep drinks on your desk? Maybe your favorite coffee mug rests on a cute little coaster? Not for much longer! You’ll now need to clear out a drawer in your desk just to put your drinks in! No more putting drinks where people might see them! Put them where you totally won’t spill it getting it out!

I know these questions might seem like they’re put in bad faith, but I’m being genuine. Do HO muddies have to follow these dumb rules that the stores are forced to do? Not trying to blame all office workers for these rules either, as I doubt Accounting or Categories are in charge, but I’d hope y’all down in Olympia get a hint.

I feel lost. Things are going well, and I should be happy, but I’m not. I feel like I’m in a loop, never to escape; I just keep running and running, but I always end up in the same place. I want to be free, but at what cost? How does one even be free? What does free even mean to me? Do I even know how to be free? What if I am, but I'm just making myself upset again?

I feel like I'm fine. I'm in a good place, I feel safe at home, but I'm always paranoid. I feel like an animal trapped in a cage, so used to the everyday that I dare not think of escape. I wonder what I’m running from; is it the past or future mistakes? If I'm always worrying about what could happen, how am I supposed to be okay? I can't expect myself to be sane.

Today I was happy and energetic. I blamed it on my coffee, but what if it was just me being manic? Am I ever really even happy anymore, or is it all fake? I hate that when I'm happy, I can’t just be happy. It never feels real. Everything's getting more vibrant again, yet everything feels fake. The grass looks too green, the trees don't sway the same, and I keep hearing my name. Is this the same spiral I always seem to take? When the trees turn green, and the flowers bloom, I lose who I am. I’m afraid I never will be sane.

I feel like I am a figment of my own imagination; made up of the personality of others, learning to be who I needed to fit in and survive. What did that cost me? Maybe my sense of self and pride?

Chapter one: Live A Little

Camilla

My life sucks, all I have ever wanted was to be loved and taken care of but I guess I was too cursed to experience happiness in my life. My biological father abandoned us and disappeared without any trace. My mother always comes back home drunk, she doesn't have an iota of love towards me nor do I get any motherly love, all she cares about is her alcohol and her new found man who happens to be my stepfather now.

I was deprived of both motherly and fatherly love at a very young age. My stepfather would do anything in this world to get rid of me but I was too strong to let him succeed in his plan.

To save my life from my stepfather, I moved out of the house and went to live with my boyfriend in another city. But still couldn't be loved and cared for. Maybe I am being a little dramatic but I swear this world is against me.

I honestly can't remember the last time I had a good day. This morning, my dumb ass boyfriend thought that it was okay to turn off my eight o'clock alarm and just replace it with his own. The alarm was set for an hour later than what I needed, like hell, what is wrong with him?

The purpose of the alarm was to wake me up and go to the gym but I wouldn't be surprised if I came home later to find him on the couch in the same position I left him. It is fair to say that things have been a little rough between us recently but once again, I have to force myself to remember that if I wait just a little longer, things will get better.

Our relationship was never one of those all consuming romances you may have heard of but Robin is nice and that's enough for me. He didn't abandon me even when everyone else did.

His stupidity this morning made me miss a meeting with a client. I am an event planner. I was supposed to meet a couple this morning concerning their upcoming wedding but my idiot boyfriend made me miss that. On top of that, my lack of coordination caused me to trip on something and ripping my stocking in the process. I just wanted to be happy in life. Is that really too much to ask?

Coming out of the gym house, I decided to branch to the only place that ever brought happiness in my life. A coffee shop that wasn't too far from my house. I came here on a daily basis to ease out some stress.

Opening the door, I was greeted by the wonderful smell of freshly baked goods and coffee grinds, filling the whole place.

""Camilla is that you?"" A familiar voice called out from the kitchen before the counter.

The owner of the cafe, Susan Kanu. She is the most kindhearted woman I have ever known but she can sometimes be scary as well. I can only be thankful that I am on her good side because despite her old age, I wouldn't put it past her to be able to make even the toughest men run away crying.

""Hello, Mrs. Kanu."" I replied, walking towards the sound of her voice.

Peaking around the corner, I saw her petite figure standing with her arms crossed and facing my direction.

""What did I tell you?"" She said with a slight warning in her tone.

""Hello, Susan."" I quickly corrected myself, catching onto what she meant.

For some unknown reason she was very adamant on me calling her by her first name. I am not sure of the reason but either way my response caused a bright smile to spread across her face.

""What brings you here at this time of the day?"" She asked as I helped her carry the tray of baked snacks over to the counter.

""Robin turned off my alarm, so I had to reschedule the meeting I had initially booked at nine o'clock this morning. I was just coming out from the gym, heading back home to see him but I am definitely going to need some coffee before that happens.""

I heard her let out a disapproving sigh and I already knew what was about to leave her mouth before she even said it.

""Why do you still stay with that boy? We both know he has the brain of a rock and it is not like he is giving you any good…""

""Susan,"" I interrupted, stopping her from what she was about to say.

Just because she is right doesn't mean it has to be said. It only served as a reminder of how touch deprived I am. The thing about Susan is that she is as blunt as you ever think of.

""He is ni…."" I started, feeling the need to defend my boyfriend but I was cut off.

""Let me guess, he is nice to you?""

""Yes and he treats….""

""Treats you well? My dear, I hate to break it to you but that is another way of saying he is boring.""

She is right and that is why I stopped protesting but Robin is all I have ever known. He knows every damn thing about me, I feel safe with him and if he is going to leave me, he would have done it by now. Now matter how much baggage I may carry, Robin wasn't scared off by it.

It has really been a rough life for me, it has been almost a year since my father disappeared and still there is no sign of him. Even the police and other detectives couldn't trace his whereabouts, they said his disappearance was voluntary. The little that I knew him he wouldn't go hiding without a good reason.

Most people think that he is a heartless monster which in some way I have to admit but at the same time, never once in my childhood did he make me feel neglected or unsafe. He started teaching me self defense from the time I could walk. I vividly remember him telling me on my tenth birthday that he wouldn't be around forever and that once he was gone, the only person I could rely on was myself. And that day happens to be the first time he thought of how to use a gun. He gave me a gun as my birthday gift.

My father might be crazy by doing that but I still love him nevertheless. I already knew it was going to be very impossible to figure out where he was, no one found him unless he wanted them to. I can only hope he either reveals himself or decides to come out of hiding.

My private detective has been trying to track him for the last seven months but so far nothing has come out of it and it only leaves me more and more disappointed. And that is why I am still staying with Robin. I have lost so much and I am sick of everything in my life changing, he is the only consistent thing as of right now and I wasn't prepared to lose that yet.

Not responding to Susan's early question, she continues speaking.

""You are twenty-five years old, you should be going out to clubs and meeting new people. Let yourself live a little and before you know it, you will be old like me wishing you would have just loosened up more while you still can."" I smiled at her words.

I wish I could have argued with what she said but the truth is that I would be lying if I said I had a good social life. I used to go out with my friends a lot but ever since I moved here with Robin, I haven't been able to meet new people and besides he doesn't like to go out that much. He prefers that I stay home with him and the last time I went out, it didn't go well. I went to a club without him and when I came back home that night, he scolded me for dressing like a slut and then refused to sleep in the same bed with me for almost a week. I cried so hard that night but he eventually came to his senses and apologized.

I knew apologizing can't justify his actions but at this point, I can't even remember what my life was like without him and for that reason, I chose to let it go. I grabbed my takeout coffee and dug into my bag to grab some cash to pay but Susan stopped me with a glare.

""Don't even think about it.""

Not wanting to argue, I sneaked the cash into her tip jar before she could protest. She always gets upset whenever I pay for anything in her cafe. With a smile on my face, I moved around the counter and placed a kiss on her cheeks which managed to remove the pout on her face.

""Bye, Susan.""

""Have fun with your boyfriend."" I shook my head before closing the glass door behind me.

# Chapter 2: Cheated

Chapter two: Cheated

Camilla

I left the cafe in my small old version of a car and found myself in my parking lobby after a few minutes of driving. I grabbed my coffee and stepped out of the car, walking up to the front porch and when I opened the door, I was left shattered. The scene unfolding before me was unimaginable.

""What the hell, Robin?"" I yelled, slamming the front door behind me and dropping my bag on the floor.

I had accepted the fact that today was simply a bad day and that I needed to sleep it off. However, the last thing I expected was to come home to find my boyfriend of three years having sex with whom I would picture to be a human version of Barbie.

That is just the problem of men, the majority of them only know how to think with their cóck. I would rather have him just break up with me instead of putting me in a position where I had to see this.

""Babe?"" He startled, throwing the bitch off his lap.

""What are you doing home so early?""

I just stood there silently in disbelief as he scrambled to find his pants and the girl slipped on his shirt. I could feel the anger building up inside me and in that moment, I wondered how hard it would be to get away with murder.

""Camilla?"" I subconsciously heard someone's voice.

I mean getting away with murder can't be that hard, can it?

""Camilla?"" I heard that voice again, snapping out of my unrealistic wistful thought and raising my head to meet him.

""Some asshole turned off my alarm this morning and caused me to miss my meeting."" I said, accusingly.

""You want to tell me why I walked into my own house to find you fúcking another woman?""

""Listen sweetie, you can't blame him for finding someone to fulfill the needs that you can't meet."" The girl said with a smirk on her face.

Gosh, her voice is whiny, high pitched and just as fake as her boobs. Directing my attention to her, I caught her looking me up and down with a disgusted look.

""At least I don't rely on fucking with already taken people to feel good about myself."" Her smirk was replaced with a glare.

It was true that my sex life with Robin was pretty non-existent but it is not my fault that he doesn't know how to make a woman cum. At this point, I can't tell whether there is something wrong with me or if it is just the fact that the guy had no techniques. I am guessing it is the last one, Robin doesn't know how to make me cum and I don't know why I felt he can't handle me alone when it comes to sex. But I don't get why the hell this girl over here thinks she has accomplished something by having sex with him.

Though I am hurt and angry, if she wants Robin, she can have him. I refused to waste any more of my time fighting for someone who doesn't want me.

""Babe, please don't be mad. I can fix this."" He pleaded, clearing sensing the wave of anger radiating from me right now.

I felt weird, in the past conflict, I would practically just shut down but in this moment, I knew I was done submitting to him and all of his bullshit. At this point, my body was filled with bottled up emotions and its containment was about to explode, leaving me pissed off and fed up.

""Don't call me that! You lost the right the second I walked through this door and saw another woman on your lap!""

""Camilla, come on. Don't be like that.""

""Be like what exactly? Pissed off that my boyfriend of three years cheated on me? It is okay if you lost interest in me but you should have just ended things.""

""Babe come on, you don't have to be….""

""How long have you been seeing her?"" I cut him off, not interested in hearing whatever he has to say anymore.

""This is the first time."" He responded with a desperation in his voice but the girl said otherwise.

""One year now, you can't meet up with his sexual needs so he came to me."" The girl said.

I slightly tilt my head back in an attempt to prevent my tears from rolling down. It didn't take me long to do the calculation in my head. My father went missing one year ago, I guess my baggage ended up driving him away after all.

But have they known each other before I moved in with him? This so fucked up. I took a deep breath, forcing my tears back, he doesn't deserve them anymore.

""Camilla please, you don't have to be so dramatic. I love you and you know it."" Before I could respond, the girl spoke.

""As much as this is entertaining, I have somewhere else to be. I am out.""

Avoiding my gaze, she walked into my bedroom before returning with her bra, panties and a pair of heels in her hands. I am starting to feel nauseous at this moment, he fúcked her in the same bed we had made love countless times? She looked at Robin and winked at him before walking shamelessly out of the house.

We were left in an awkward silence, neither of us knew what to say next. But I was eagerly ready to break the silence.

""We are done."" I said, moving from the spot I was since I came in.

""What? No!"" He cried out but I chose to ignore his hysterics.

Walking towards what used to be our bedroom, he followed me behind. Seeing the bed I had neatly made this morning, the sheets are now in a heap on the floor. I pushed down my emotions and opened the closet, managing to drown out the sobs coming from the man behind me.

This guy really lost it. Firstly, he cheated on me and now he thinks he has the right to cry over me when I said we were done. The worst part of this scenario is that if I didn't come home early today, this would have continued behind my back for goodness knows how much longer.

Ignoring his continuous yet meaningless pleas, I grabbed my suitcase from the top rack of the closet and started packing my clothes, not caring if I am making a mess, he can clean that up later. I know that I will need to come back soon to grab the rest of my things but this should be enough to stay away from him for the next few weeks.

""Where are you going?"" He asked, finally slowing his pathetic cries.

""It is not like you have any family members here.""

""Yes, and who's fault is that by the way?"" I snapped back.

When I first met Robin, I was halfway through my Management and Planning in the university while he was working for a Navy department in town. We bumped into each other at a bar and one thing led to the other which ended with me waking up in his bed the next day naked. The sex was mediocre but he made me smile like no one else ever had and at that time, it was enough for me.

Ignoring him, I went into the bathroom to grab my toiletries. I zipped up my bag and headed for the front door.

""Where are you going?"" I ignored him, the sooner I leave, the better for both of us.

""Camila? Are you listening to me?"" I didn't respond.

""I said, where are you going?"" Still kept quiet.

""Hello? Stop!"" He suddenly demanded, anger lacing now in his voice.

""You can't leave after everything I have done for you, you have nothing without me. You have no family, no friends, you are absolutely nothing without me."" His tears are now completely gone and was now replaced with rage.

Gosh, how did I let myself become so blind that I only just realized how manipulative he is. I seriously needed to get out of here very fast. Still walking towards the front door, he appeared in front of me, blocking my way.

""Get the hell out of my way, Robin!"" I yelled, attempting to maneuver myself around him but luck wasn't on my side.

I tried again but he grabbed me and shoved me so that my back was against the front door, using his heavy mass to keep me pinned.

""You are overreacting over nothing."" He said slowly as if he thinks his soft tone will somehow calm me down.

""She means nothing to me. You are the one I want. I love you.""

I stopped trying to free myself from his grip at his words. That was another thing about him, things were great with him until they weren't.

At first, he was so sweet and would always find a way to make me smile even when I didn't think it was possible. He was the first guy I was even serious with but he also knows how to make me feel worthless and was the one who taught me just how painful words can be.

I am so fucking sick and tired of getting hurt all the time.

# Chapter 3: It Hurts

Chapter three: It Hurts

Camilla

Robin wasn't my first boyfriend but he was the first man that I ever had sex with. He took my virginity and I didn't have any regrets about that. I guess I have always been the one invested more in a relationship than my partners.

I mistook his toxic and manipulative behavior as being loving and protective. It was crazy how in a matter of an hour I went from defending him in front of Susan to packing my things in hopes of never seeing him again. I am done letting others push me around and break me down into nothing.

The seconds his grip on my waist loosened, I used the opportunity to twist my body and freed myself from his grip, creating a distance between us. I brought my knee up and connected it with his crotch, goodness, that really felt good.

He grimaced in pain but I am not finished yet. Not giving him a chance to recover from the first kick, I swing my left fist, heading directly towards the side of his jaw.

""You fúcking bitch!"" He choked out, dropping to his knees.

Trying my best to ignore the strong feeling of pain jolting through my hand, I tightened my grip on the handle of my suitcase and ran out of the house. Spotting my car in the same place I left, I tried turning on the ignition but eventually after so many times of trying, it actually worked. I drove off, catching a glimpse of Robin from my side mirror.

""Gosh!"" I breathed out loud, physically feeling my heart pounding in my chest.

I can't believe I just did that, a large smile spread across my features and my hands slightly shaking from the adrenaline still rushing through my body.

I felt like this is one of those life changing moments that is either going to lead to something really great or horrible. I have no clue where I am going or how the hell I am going to survive on my own but at this point none of that matters. Anything that is better than staying from that asshole, I am welcoming it.

Knowing a hotel would be the best option for me now until I found a place of my own, l pulled out of the road scrolling on my phone to find the nearest and cheapest hotel close by.

As an event planner, it wasn't that easy to get a client as so many people were in the system and to make matters worse, I am new in the city and now that I am living on my own, I am going to need as many projects as I can get to keep me going.

For the rest of the day, I found myself walking around the city, busying myself with something, going to some shopping malls just to kill time without buying anything and distributing my business cards with hope of getting a client.

Thankfully, my afternoon managed to pass by smoothly and I was able to give out some cards. Hopefully I will get a client. I took advantage of as many distractions as I could in an attempt to resist the impending urge to break down into tears. I knew Robin was really bad for me but unfortunately that realization doesn't make the ache in my heart any easier.

Finally, I got a hotel that was within my range, I parked in their lobby, struggling to contain what I have tried so hard to push down all day, pure and utter sadness. I knew the second I walked behind the closed door of the hotel room, I would lose my composure and I can't avoid my emotions anymore.

Going into the building, I walked towards the front desk to meet the receptionist.

""Greetings Miss, how can I help you?""

""I need a room.""

She went back to her computer, telling me the single room that is available and I paid for it.

I walked into the elevator, heading up to the second floor with my key and suitcase in my hand. I walked down the narrow hallway, looking at each door I passed. Finally I finally found the number of the room that was tagged in my key card.

Knowing that I couldn't hold my emotions any longer, I opened the door that took me into a small but suitable room. I placed my bag down and walked over to sit on the comfortable bed. For the first time today, I am forced to listen to my intruding thoughts.

""I am fine."" I told myself, letting out a heavy breath.

I tried my best to shove down the tight feeling that was already threatening to appear in my chest but it became hard to breathe, like really hard. I wasn't cold but my body soon became a shaking disaster as harsh emotions took over my body.

I let out quick, shallow breaths and wrapped my arms tightly around each other as if I were hugging myself. My mind goes completely blank and soon is the fact that I am completely and utterly alone. Robin was right, I have no one. Those thoughts consumed me and played in a continuous loop in my head over and over. I am reminded that no matter what I do and how hard I try to make myself into someone who is lovable, no now would ever love me and stay with me forever.

At this I am having a panic attack but I can't do anything to stop it as waves upon wave of emotions crash through me. I pressed my lips tightly together but I couldn't contain the uncontrollably sobs from escaping. I don't really want to wake the person next door but it is nearly impossible to calm myself down at this point.

I closed my eyes, trying my best to focus on taking deep breaths just as my father taught me, I counted from one to three and inhaled air through my nose. I repeated the exercise multiple times, breathing in and out.

I forced myself to focus on steadying my racing heart but it hurts. It hurts so bad, even as my body begins to calm, I still find myself in pain. I could feel the tears on my face that I didn't wipe off and the thin line of sweat that had formed along my forehead. I just realized how tight I was gripping onto my arms and when I loosen it, I see half moon indents lining my skin. Gosh, I didn't even feel myself doing that.

The last time I had a panic attack was one year ago when my father went missing. I thought I had everything under control but I guess not. Laying back on the bed, I felt myself slowly came down from the attack. The tightness in my chest dissolved and I let out a long sigh. Moving under the warmth of the covers, I ignored the fact that the lights were still on, nothing having the energy to turn them off. All I needed now was to sleep.

I am fine, I am going to be fine. Tomorrow is going to be a better day and things will get easier, they have to. There is always a light at the end of a tunnel.",1,1747183475.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

***Sofia's POV***

""Your keys Miss, rent is due in a month - and remember to make it cash!"" The grumbly caretaker tosses the metal towards me carelessly as I fumble to catch them, swallowing to wet my drying throat.

""Thank you..."" I manage to say, with my voice barely audible, but he nods nonetheless as though he had heard me before making his exit.

He was a stout man, who didn't pride himself much on his appearance by the looks of things, but who was I to judge anyone in this state?

I had managed to land this little apartment for only $350 per month, and although that doesn't sound much to the average person, it really was a lot for somebody who was new to town without a job...

Not to mention my new school that would be taking up most of my time during the week. I would need a night time job no doubt, something convenient to help me make some money - and fast.

I sigh, hearing the front door creak before finally closing over, giving me a proper moment to view the apartment for what it was.

It had nothing in it, no furniture, and the place looked as though it had seen over a thousand crack parties in its time.

I was already wary of my neighbours too who I had passed by on my way inside here. Two men who both stood out in front of the building seeming to smoke something that evidently wasn't normal nicotine or tobacco.

I peered out of the broken blinds, seeing one of them wobble slightly in his high state, before rebalancing himself and going in for another puff - this time from a small pipe that I could see...

Unfortunately, it seemed that one of the men was the top floor resident and the other was the bottom floor - sandwiching me in between them like some cruel prank in our block of three.

I had no choice though, this was the cheapest place I could find and I chose this life for myself... this was my burden to carry and I had to make the most of it at this point because I knew I would never go back home.

I walk towards the tiny kitchen, finding nothing in the cupboards other than some soup tins and so I quickly go back over to my bags which were left in the centre of the floor.

I unzip the one which contained my last small puddle of cash in order to scrutinise just how much I had fucked up thus far...

I had used most of what I took now, and this was my last chance to settle somewhere without them finding me again... and so this has to work!

I pull out my small pink zip purse, opening it to reveal some notes and coins as I slump down on the hard wood floor and tip the contents out.

Taking a second to start counting it, I chew my lip in anticipation for how bad my situation really was this time around... fifty... seventy... ninety...

Pointing to each coin for it to count towards my total, I slump my shoulders slightly and breathe out.

$137...

Not enough for next month's rent but it's something to get me by until I find a job, right?

I check the clock, seeing that it was three in the afternoon, as I push all of my money back inside of the purse - putting it into my bag once again.

I guess it's time to explore my new town - Durango, Colorado.

I was getting further West, but I didn't mind.

Before now, I had just stuck to city hopping, having lived in two already before coming to this place. But they would always manage to hunt me down, like I was a wild animal, and this time around I knew that I had to try a different tactic.

A smaller town would be harder to find and hopefully they would just bypass the place assuming that I would have gone to Vegas or somewhere more extravagant.

I will say though, I did get more for my money in the cities with there being better housing options, but I couldn't grumble - at least I have a roof over my head and a door that locks.

With that, I toss my backpack over my shoulder and head back out - taking the keys and locking the door behind me on my exit.

I quickly rush down the stairs, out in to the bright sun, silencing my two neighbours who eye me curiously with creepy grins.

Thankfully, they say nothing as I pass through the middle of them both, but after a few more steps they both snigger and mutter between themselves - their words inaudible and I wasn't sure if I would have wanted to hear what they were saying either.

I follow a sign towards the town centre, learning quickly that my street seemed to be filled with addicts and drunken people as I passed by, but I didn't mind - as long as they were peaceful and left me out of it that is...

The town itself was gorgeous, far different to the city life, and I got the vibe that this was no doubt a place where everyone knew each other.

I was shocked to find that a couple of blocks away from my own apartment, the streets were lined with ridiculously large extravagant properties and fancy cars, highlighting the wealth that also resided in this small place.

I quickened my step, slightly embarrassed to be walking by the residents who sat out on their front porches to enjoy the sun - with my messy unclean hair and overall scruffy appearance.

I would have to grab some necessities to shower with, or I would face backlash on my first day of school which I didn't want nor need on top of everything else that I had going on. Plus, nobody would hire me looking like this either!

I eventually reached the main town, passing a number of boutique restaurants and coffee shops, before finding a discount store that I quickly swerved into in shame.

The lady on the till seemed surprised when I walked in, but quickly forced a smile to which I returned awkwardly and hurried towards the isles.

Do I look that bad now? I had never let myself get this unkept... but this was nothing more than a result of travelling for eight days straight to get here...

Deciding to put my pride first, I granted myself permission to spend what I had to spend in order to freshen up completely for my first day of school tomorrow.

Glancing across the hair and body products thankful to find that they were pretty cheap, I grabbed a small basket and began to add shampoo, conditioner, body wash, a sponge, toothpaste, a toothbrush, deodorant and a razor to shave with.

Calculating the total in my head, I was relieved to have only spent seven dollars - returning back to the checkout lady with my products.

She looked somewhat guilty, as she scanned each one, glancing over what I had came in here for.

""Uhh listen dear... it's on the house... don't worry about paying today, we all fall into a low place sometimes but you'll pick yourself back up again... I'll cover your total."" The woman's words shock me, as my lips part and my eyes widen.

""N-No I can pay!"" I push, quickly retrieving my purse in embarrassment as she shakes her head and waves me off.

""Put your money to something else, there's a great little thrift store across the road, you could have a look in there? I'll get this."" She pushes, bagging up my products as I gulp and nod slowly.

This was embarrassing, but I couldn't help but feel grateful.

""Thank you... I'm uh, new around here... I just need some time to get on my feet."" I nod quickly, realising that she probably thought I was an addict of some sort looking this way.

""I understand, have a nice day dear..."" She smiles and ignores my rambles, handing me the bag with a soft smile as I thank her once more and hurry out of the store.

Jeez...

I inhale a slow breath, before spotting the thrift store across the road that the lady had spoken of.

Maybe I could go in and use the money I would have spent for a first day school outfit?

I sigh, noticing some girls around my age staring over at me from down the street in confusion. I quickly cross the road, rushing towards the store to get away from their judgemental eyes - hurrying myself inside.

The place was huge, organised in to colours and sizes as I head towards the pinks first to browse. I loved clothes, and at first when I left home I had took most of what I had with me. But each time they found me, I had to flee as quickly as possible which meant that sadly stuff got left behind on the way.

I think I have three outfits and some underwear left, that I could hand wash in the sink when I get back home to freshen up a bit.

I pull out a pink crop top with buttons at the top, and seeing that the shirt was only two dollars I decide to take it.

I also find a baby blue tee, plain with only a white heart on the left hand side. Due to having a small mark on the sleeve it was only a dollar to which I also decide to get it.

It was an odd feeling, shopping for clothes again when it was something I used to enjoy so much but I enjoyed it in here nonetheless. Like every other store though, some of the prices were really great and other prices seemed ridiculous, especially for second hand clothes.

I moved towards the jeans, rummaging through the racks for my size before finding a nice black pair for only five dollars in a 'Mom style' fit.

Ok I can't spend anything else, this was a treat... I decide, as I head towards the checkout desk and count out what I need.

The younger guy watches me, choosing to stay silent since he probably deals with people who look like me every day in here, before I hand him over eight dollars total to which he thanks me and bags the stuff for me.

Leaving, I stop in to the small excursion shop next door finding the different activities and trips you could book in or close to town before my eyes land on a little brochure with a map of town on the back.

Perfect! That would help me find my way around a little better!

I place the pamphlet in my bag, and trudge my way back towards my new empty apartment to freshen up as much as humanly possible for my big day tomorrow...

But I could confirm so far that this place wasn't all bad...

# Chapter 2

***Sofia's POV***

Standing from the floor, I move to crack my aching back with a sore stretch.

Sleeping on the floor was not the best form of sleep but it would just have to do right now.

I got myself ready for school, deciding to wear the blue tee and new jeans I had purchased from the thrift store yesterday, providing a sense of freshness from the clothes I usually rotated between these days.

My hair and body was now spotless after an hour of relentless scrubbing in the cold shower which needed to be done - and I was thankful that my hair dried naturally straight which meant that I didn't have to style or attempt to fix it too much either.

With a heavy spray of deodorant and a scrub of my teeth, I pull my bag over my shoulder and head for the door - thankful that my two neighbours hadn't yet emerged in the early hours of the day.

I followed the small map on the pamphlet, realising that the school wasn't too far from the town centre which made things easier for me.

It was roughly a fifteen minute walk in to town and then no doubt a few more minutes walk from there. I liked walking, but recently find myself taking dizzy turns probably due to my lack of a healthy diet.

At first it was a struggle, trying to watch what I was spending by cutting back on my food, but at this rate it was a terrible habit that I often forgot about.

I was the skinniest I had ever been, which made me feel slightly queasy whenever I thought in to it too much. My old clothes didn't fit the same, and I was angry with myself for letting go of my appearance so much over the months that I had ran away.

I was always slim, but had curves which I didn't mind, but by now, any sort of ass that I once had was non existent...

If my forged paperwork had been accepted by the school then I should hopefully get a free lunch every day which will keep me going though.

I had gotten good at this forgery stuff, although it did worry me with what could or would happen if I ever got caught.

I had my oldest brother's ID, but only ever used it for important stuff such as applying to switch schools. I claimed he was my guardian, and worked away in the army, which was why I was left to live alone.

Technically I was seventeen, almost eighteen, which meant that I wouldn't need a guardian at all soon enough... but I had to be cautious with what I used the ID for.

Sure, I could attempt to take out a credit card in his name, but that would leave a foot print of where I was since I would have to do it online.

I have learned to be clever, because after the first two locations I had run off to, I realised how quickly they could find me with the smallest slip up.

Having now passed the town, I noticed a young guy with a backpack on and decided to follow behind him assuming that we were both going to the same place - being school.

Rightly so, within five minutes, we rounded a corner and the large building stood before me.

This was the worst part about moving, having to start a new school. The first day could go one of two ways, either everybody would notice I was new and could make my life a living hell, or I would go undetected which was my most favourable option.

Luckily I seemed to be early, as not many kids were here yet as I headed inside and glanced around.

""Lost?"" I turn to find a man with glasses, cocking an eyebrow down at me as I nod assuming he was one of the teachers.

""I'm looking for the office."" I explain, as he nods and motions for me to follow him as he begins to walk in a quickened stride.

I push my feet quickly to keep up, turning a left and then a right before the large glass windows of the school office soon come in to view.

""Thank you!"" I beam, knowing that I would have never found this place on my own.

""You are welcome - good luck!"" He nods once more before taking off again, leaving me standing by the door alone.

I knock gently, seeing the small elderly receptionist peer up at me from her computer screen before motioning for me to come in.

I enter, approaching her as she stands and moves to grab an envelope of sorts before pushing the glasses back up her nose.

""You must be Sofia Isabella yes? The newbie?"" She questions, handing me an envelope which read 'student welcome pack'.

""That's me."" I reply in confirmation, as she takes a seat once again and begins to type something up on the system.

""Ok so the headmaster is out all day today so he will meet you another time, but you have been assigned one of our students to help show you around, he should be here in ten minutes. You also get a free lunch is that correct? You will find your student lunch card in the welcome pack and it should already have credit on it for you to buy your lunch. You bring the card back to us every three months for us to update the credits. Your timetable will also be in your welcome pack but you will have first two classes off to go on a tour of the school."" The receptionist recites her checklist with ease, showing me that she had done this role many times before and that I was just another typical new student to her - nothing special.

""That all makes sense, thanks!"" I respond, fumbling with the large brown envelope in my hands as she offers me a tight smile and motions towards the waiting seats.

""Take a seat, read through your pack and the student should arrive for you soon."" She pushes, as I take a glance at her name badge which read 'Brenda'.

I nod, pushing back a smile at her hurried demeanour, before turning to sink in to one of the comfy chairs.

The only sound was of the keyboard clicking, as I tore open the envelope and revealed its contents...

Inside, was a map of the school which I placed aside, a key to my own locker which was number '804', my lunch card with my name on it, a welcome breakfast snack bar which I was more thankful for than she even knew, a booklet listing what the school offers for extra credit with what clubs were available to join, followed by my timetable.

I decide to eat the breakfast bar before the student arrives to show me around, finding that it would be rude to do so when he gets here.

I rip open the wrapper, take a bite, causing my stomach to growl out - almost in excitement at gaining fuel.

Glancing down at the timetable, I had English in the morning which I would be missing for the tour, Physical Ed after that which I absolutely hated only because I didn't bring a change of clothes because I don't own any, and then Art at the end of the day which I did enjoy.

Back home at my normal school I was one of the best runners and cheer flyers in my year group - if I don't mind bragging. But since leaving, my taste for physical activity quickly deteriorated due to many reasons. The first being that I didn't have much energy with the cut back in food I had to endure, along with the fact that I didn't own any gym clothes at my new schools so often got embarrassed about taking part in my normal clothes after a girl called me out for it once.

""Sofia?"" I glance up out of my thoughts to find a young guy standing awkwardly beside me that I hadn't even noticed come in.

Chewing the last bite of the breakfast bar quickly, swallowing it back, I clear my throat and offer him a smile.

""Yes nice to meet you... and you are?"" I try to be polite, pushing the contents of the welcome pack back into the envelope - placing my locker keys, lunch card and folded up timetable in to my jean pocket for convenience.

""Joel. I'm doing extra credit, so they said to show you around."" He explains, as I nod and stand - taking my bag and other things with me.

""Yeah uh, thanks for that!"" I quickly say, knowing this would probably make my time here much easier - especially today.

Hearing the school bell suddenly ring out, giving me a fright, he chuckles slightly at my reaction to which I grow slightly embarrassed by.

""We can give it a minute for the corridors to quieten down before heading out. What locker number are you? We can go there first."" He suggests, as I nod and fish out the key from my pocket quickly.

""Oh no, 804! You might have some trouble there..."" He trails off, as I furrow my eyebrows in confusion as to what he meant.

He turns to glance out in to the hallways, before turning back to me.

""Let's go, should be quiet now."" He motions with his hand as we exit the office and he leads me back the way I came towards the front doors of the school.

Here goes nothing...

# Chapter 3

***Sofia's POV***

We walk on, as Joel shows me the large lunch hall on passing along with showing me where each of the female toilets were which was also useful to know...

""So why did you say that I might have some trouble with my locker?"" I ponder, as he seems to grow somewhat anxious with the mention.

""Oh that... well uh... the eight hundreds are typically off limits unless Vincent says otherwise... can only imagine what he keeps in half of them too!"" Joel explains, seeming to lower his voice as we wander through the empty hallways.

""Who is Vincent? A teacher here?"" I question, assuming that the guy clearly had a lot of authority around here. But what would he possibly be keeping in student lockers and why would he be hoarding them all to himself in the first place?

""A teacher? Ha, who are you kidding! No he's a student, but even the teachers are cautious of him. His family basically own the town but they are gone a lot of the time so Vincent lives on a huge estate with his little gang. They are into all kinds of illegal stuff from what I hear."" Joel continues, as my eyes widen more with each word.

Why on earth would the school have to give me of all people an eight hundred locker number when this is the type of dudes apparently ruling over them? Does the Lord hate me that much?!

""Sometimes, whenever students get one of those lockers, if you ask him nice enough then he just lets you have it. It's like being granted fucking citizenship into the promised land around here!"" Joel rolls his eyes, clearly not fond of whoever Vincent was and what he stood for.

We turn a corner at the end of the main hallway, finding the gym halls up ahead as one of them buzzed with activity whilst the other remained empty beside it...

""Just around here, if he's there then you can just ask him for it, and if he says no then we can try to change your locker number right?"" Joel encourages, as I all but nod feeling as though I didn't have much of a choice on the matter.

Approaching the large metal cabinets, it seems at first that the whole wall of lockers were deserted, but as we grew closer, a group of four guys come into view - all stood in the corner by the fire exit door which was slightly ajar.

The scent of smoke quickly invaded my nostrils causing my face to scrunch, reminding me of my father, as I push aside any dark thoughts straight to the back of my mind.

Joel falls back slightly, giving my back a soft push to signal that it was them...

""The one with the tats."" He whispers, as I gulp and locate the exact guy he was talking about amongst the crowd.

There was no way he was my age, he was huge! Both in height and in muscle! Tattoos covering mostly every bit of skin that I could see except from his literal face itself. All of them were big, but he seemed the damn biggest! I wasn't sure if it was simply due to the way Joel had played him up to me before now, but I found him terrifying nonetheless.

Dark hair, dark dangerous eyes and an expression that evidently didn't want to be tested today - however I couldn't help but admire his perfect features, clearly gifted with good genes... but all of that aside!

I have no choice...

If this is how things run around here then so be it!

I shuffle my way towards them, as they all watch me silently in amusement.

""What do we have here?"" The blonde is the first to remark, his tone iced with sheer entertainment as he stubs out his cigarette.

""Another one of your quick fucks before class Vin?"" The one with the shaved head sniggers sarcastically, as though it was a ridiculous suggestion that he would ever even look twice at me let alone to sleep with me...

""Uh... I uh... Vincent?"" I begin, clearing my throat a little to get the words out.

""Louder? I'm not death but you're beginning to make me fucking think that I am!"" He snaps out rudely, instantly proving himself to be the most confident of the group around him, his deep voice sending jolts of concern through me almost instantly.

I really don't want to upset him...

""Sorry... I just wanted to uh... ask if I could use my locker... it's number 804... I was told to ask you first though..."" I try to push my voice to come out louder than before, doing a little better, but feeling my cheeks flare red with embarrassment as they all watch and scrutinise me with their eyes.

With that, the group of guys all start laughing loudly, ridiculing me as Vincent himself smirks - probably feeling accomplished that I already respected him enough to ask him to use my own damn locker which was assigned to me in the first place.

""I don't know can you?"" His response nearly kills me, as I shuffle from foot to foot feeling sick to my stomach at the whole exchange.

Why couldn't anything in my life just be easy? For once?!

""What's in it for me?"" The guy known as Vincent adds, as the others shake their head and snigger beside him like cronies found in a gangster movie.

What the hell is this place?!

""Well uh... what do you want for it?"" I find myself bargaining out of embarrassment, as my gut screams for me to just walk away however my head tells me that if I did, I would only make matters worse.

Vincent seems amused with my response, bringing a hand up to his chin as though he was thinking heavily about what he wanted from me...

What could the rich kid who apparently runs the whole town with everyone under his thumb ask for from me? I have nothing.

""Lunch."" He states, as I squint slightly in confusion with the word.

""What?"" I breathe out, needing more than just a single word response from him.

""I want you to get me lunch and bring it here every day."" He shrugs, smirking as though it was the best idea he had ever had.

Is he fucking kidding me right now? Without realising it, he's taking away the one thing I needed from this school to help keep me going...

What do I do... do I politely decline and tell him to keep the locker? It's not worth my only meal, is it?

""What? Mommy doesn't give you enough pocket money for a three dollar lunch?"" Vincent remarks loudly with an eye roll, hitting me in the gut with his choice of words.

No Mommy doesn't... because Mommy isn't alive anymore... I'm on my own you ass!

Embarrassed and hurt, I allow pride to swallow any reasonable thought I have left.

""I'll bring you lunch, what do you get?"" I agree, stupidly, having been shamed in to the agreement by the arrogant guy before me - my tone quiet and strained.

""Surprise me."" He laughs, waving me off in a silent plea for me to leave, as I nod once and turn on my heels.

Perhaps he will get tired of the lunch thing in a few days? It won't last forever... maybe with my credit, I can grab an extra thing every day and eat that before I get here with his? I'll make it work...

""How did it go?"" I find Joel asking, as I sigh and slump my shoulders a little.

""He said I can have it."" I admit my victory, however don't sound one ounce excited about it.

""Really? Well that's major? The last kid that got an eight hundred locker got told to fuck off when they asked to use it!"" Joel grins and shakes his head at the memory, hands on his hips as he himself looks relieved about it.

He motions for me to follow him, as we round the corner away from the group - thankfully finding my number closer to the end of the row to put some more distance between myself and Vincent.

""What's the catch?"" Joel hums, watching me unlock it before piling my backpack inside - happy to relieve myself of its weight.

""I've to buy him lunch and bring it here."" I mumble, ashamed that I had even agreed to such a silly thing in the first place.

I need a job, and fast, especially with this being my new school life already.

""Oh wow, well that sucks!"" Joel agrees with my mood as I nod and sigh, he's right about that...

We proceed with the rest of Joels tour, as he takes me around the entirety of the school and the grounds outside, showing me how to get to my Art class that I have at the end of the day.

""So that's pretty much everything, I'll meet you every morning for the rest of the week to make sure you remember where to go and then next week you'll be on your own... I would invite you for lunch with us but my girlfriend might not like that, you know?"" Joel explains and rubs the back of his neck awkwardly.

I kind of wish I could be introduced to some people, just to talk with them and help pass the days a little quicker, but his girlfriend must be one of those types...

""I see..."" Is all I respond, hearing the bell for break sound out as he pushes out a tight smile.

""Yeah she didn't like that I was even showing you around for extra credit either but what can I do? I'll see you tomorrow morning though, ok?"" He chuckles, and before I can even respond he walks off and leaves me standing in the centre of the filling hallways.

I am officially on my own, roped in to providing lunch for the schools biggest and baddest student... all for a damn locker that I could have done without!

I'm done for and it's not even the end of the day...",1,1747183321.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False
1km28e0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/1km28e0/still_no_narcolepsy_diagnosis/,Still no narcolepsy diagnosis,"I have had the pentad of narcolepsy symptoms since my early 20s. I am 51 now and about to see a sleep specialist for the fourth time. I have had two overnight studies with MSLT the following day. The first time I had these tests I was diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnolence but the neurologist strongly suspected it was narcolepsy because my dad had it also. I took Provigil for a few months, but fell asleep very easily, even after the titrate to the highest dosage. It was $60 per month at the time (early 2000s), and since it wasn't working I just stopped taking it. Three years ago I had another SS/MSLT, this time through a pulmonologist because I snore. That study revealed what I already knew: I still don't have sleep apnea. The problem was when it came time for the MSLT. I STRUGGLED to stay away between the naps, but of course the naps didn't reveal anything. Personally, I think the MSLT is a ridiculous test. When I have a sleep attack I don't crawl into an ice-cold bed, wiggle my eyes around to calibrate a machine and listen to a disembodied voice telling me to go to have a nice nap.  I. JUST. FALL. ASLEEP. ANYWHERE. If I had been hooked to the machine during the stay-awake hours they would have found it. But no, too much sensory input kept me from going to sleep and sliding immediately into REM, which I do about twice a day everywhere else but the ice block bed in the sleep lab. So because my brain wouldn't cooperate with the scheduled nap times I was only diagnosed with hypersomnia again and the pulmonologist would not prescribe anything to help me stay awake other than caffeine. I have gastritis. My stomach is inflamed from years of caffeine use, plus even if I have a pot of coffee all to myself I will still fall asleep.

Elona’s POV

The golden rays of the afternoon sun filtered through the tall trees lining the street as I walked down the familiar path to Crislynn’s house. Crislynn has been my best friend since we were six years old. We share a street, and they were welcoming when my father and I moved here back then. It was a luxurious neighborhood, but the glistening facades of the mansions were nothing compared to the dreams that brewed within us. With my heart racing, I approached the familiar house with its elegant architecture and well-kept garden. I raised my hand to knock on the door, butterflies dancing in my stomach.

The door swung open to reveal Crislynn, her auburn hair falling in waves around her shoulders. Her bright green eyes held a hint of mischief as she grinned at me. “Elona, you are right on time. Come on in!”

We settled down in the kitchen. I sat on the barstool at the kitchen counter while Crislynn poured us some grape juice. We are in our final year of high school. We are yet to embark on a new chapter of our lives next year. “My dad left to attend some meetings, so I was bored,” I said as she placed the grape juice in front of me. My dad was into real estate, but I am always grateful for the time that he still takes to be with me. We have a great father/daughter relationship that I don’t want to ever break.

“I was going through some research on colleges to attend,” she said as she placed the juice back into the fridge and then she turned back to me. “It is very difficult to choose which college to apply to. Journalism is my dream, and I don’t want to leave my father here. I worry about him,” she said with a hint of worry.

I felt sorry for her, she was close to her father too. When I moved here, I had the privilege of meeting her mom, Estelle. Crislynn resembled her mother, but she had his forest green eyes. Her mother passed away three years ago, and it had been difficult for both of them. My mother passed away when I was five years old and at this point, I didn’t want to even think about it because I was supposed to be cheering up my best friend.

“I’m sure that he would want you to live your life and have fun.” I smiled weakly at her.

“You have seen how he buries himself in work and I would suggest that he starts to date again, but I highly doubt he would,” she let out a heavy breath.

“It is his choice after all,” I took a sip of my juice. I must admit that I have a tiny crush on Mr. Crane, but not enough for me to want to actually pursue him.

“I guess you are right,” she said.

“I have been thinking about something that I might pursue as a possible career choice,” I said as I kept my hand on the glass.

“Please, spill it!” she was always so eager to know.

I smiled nervously. “Well, I have been thinking a lot about my future lately. I want to pursue a career in modeling.”

Crislynn’s eyes widened, a mix of surprise and excitement. “Wow, Elona!” she was taken aback. “You’ve got the looks and the confidence for it, no doubt. But you are still shy in a way.”

I couldn’t help but blush at her words. “Thanks, Crislynn. It’s just that I have been researching agencies and talking to people, and I really believe I can make it. I will never know if I do not try and maybe that shyness can disappear. I am still thinking about it, but for now, please don’t tell anyone until I have made up my mind and have spoken to my father about it.”

Crislynn’s grin widened. “I promise, I won’t tell anyone. I have no doubt that you will be great, Elona. And you will have me cheering you on every step of the way.”

“That means a lot and you know that I will do the same for you,” I smiled.

“Of course. Now, it is just to get my dad into the dating field again,” she said. We heard the front door open and close, and I knew who it was. My heartbeat wildly in my chest at this sudden feeling of nerves and excitement.

All of a sudden, I tensed when I heard Mr. Crane’s voice behind me, “Good afternoon, girls,” he said, and Crislynn smiled at him over my shoulder.

“Hi, dad. You are home quite early,” she said. Mr. Crane appeared beside me as I caught a glimpse of him. Mr. Crane was undeniably attractive, with sharp features and a charisma that seemed to radiate effortlessly. It was as if he was accustomed to the spotlight, even within the walls of his own home.

“How are you, Elona?” He looked at me with those haunting forest green eyes that haunt me in my dreams at times. I cleared my throat.

“I’m good, Mr. Crane.” I smiled and looked down at my juice. I was feeling the heat that creeped up into my cheeks. I never felt this way on this level before.

“That is great to know,” he replied, and his voice was very velvety. “Have you been researching which college it is that you want to apply to?” he asked Crislynn as he went to the cupboard, and he reached to the top to get a glass. I took in his lean muscles through his black Armani three-piece suit. That didn’t help me either.

“Yes, I have been looking at it, but we have some homework too. We have an essay to write. Is it okay that Elona can stay over for dinner? Her father is out to attend meetings and it’s a Friday night. I can order pizza for us.” she said.

When my eyes found Mr. Crane again, he was sipping water from his glass as he watched me intently until he stopped sipping. “That is fine with me, in the meantime, I have some work to catch up on in the study room,” he said as he turned around and placed the empty glass in the sink and walked away.

My heart raced, and for the first time, I truly saw him, not just as Crislynn’s dad, but as a man. And as his eyes met mine for a fleeting moment, I realized with a jolt that my tiny crush on him was way more than just that.

# Homework

Elona’s POV

I couldn’t get that look out of my head from Mr. Crane. That stare was now ingrained in my mind. One that made my heartbeat fast, that made me feel more for him, increasing my crush on him. It was bad and I know it is because I am young, and I am best friends with his daughter. I know for sure that he feels nothing for me, but that stare was giving me different vibes.

I am staying over for dinner, and it would be just the three of us. Maybe I should just go back home after we are done with our homework. Crislynn and I are seated in the lounge, with our English books open. Crislynn and I were seated on the rug that was on the floor. The coffee table was emptied of anything that was on it. So that we could do our homework here. It is always the lounge, kitchen, Crislynn’s bedroom, her dad’s study room or at my house, where we do homework. She was great at creative writing, so things flowed easily in her mind. But I wasn’t creative to that extent. I loved being more practical.

I stared at my blank page, tapping the pen against it. I had no clue what to write about. The instructions were to write a short story of one thousand words. I didn’t want it to feel forced. I looked up at Crislynn who was writing away. I let out a heavy sigh and then I looked down at my blank page again.

The only topic to write about is Mr. Crane. No one will know, because I can leave his name out. Not even Crislynn would know. This essay is to help with our grades…and then I start to write about him. As I wrote my emotions down on the page, Crislynn was done before me. “I’m done. I wrote about my mother,” she said as I looked up at her with sympathy. She was very close to Estelle. She had a hint of sadness in her eyes.

“Writing helps at times,” I told her, and then her eyes glazed over.

“Yeah, it’s just the first time that I have written about her. Even though I say that I am okay, I keep those feelings inside, and I don’t even tell my father because I know he misses her, and he still grieves her even after three years. Who am I to tell him to date? It is wrong and I will not force him into moving on so fast. He should take his time,” she said as she now wiped the lone tear away that ran down her cheek.

“That is why my father hasn’t dated in years, because everyone doesn’t move on the same. It may take longer for others. Both of our fathers loved and lost their soulmates. I hope one day that we both have that kind of love that they shared with them. A love that is true. It will be okay, but you won’t forget her, and neither will he,” I said.

“Hopefully we can move on from the pain” she smiled. “Anyway, I need to order some pizza,” she stood up and she went to the kitchen.

I leaned back against the edge of the sofa, my legs crossed as I still held my pen in my hand. “What is the essay about?” My heart leaped in my chest as I jumped, and I looked to my side as Mr. Crane walked around the sofa that was behind me. He looked at me, his waist coat and jacket were removed, leaving him in a white shirt with the top unbuttoned. His shirt was tucked inside of his black dress pants.

He looked at me again with those forest green eyes. “Um…we are writing an essay, and the topic can be about anything. It gets added to our grades,” I replied, trying to be nonchalant.

He now stood close to me, but as I looked up, my gaze was on his crotch. The bulge was big but then I looked away at my essay. “So, what topic did you choose?” he asked.

“I chose to write a little story.”

“What is it about?” he asked.

“It is about a girl falling in love with someone and how she hopes to be with him someday,” I looked at him, well past his bugle this time. He was already looking at me with a smirk. I don’t know what it could mean.

“Keep up the good work and then you can succeed at anything,” he said, and then he walked around the coffee table. He stood in front of me. I looked at him as his arms were folded over his chest and I looked at what he was staring at.

He was reading Crislynn’s essay. My heartbeat slowed down this time because this was a sensitive topic…his deceased wife. I looked up at him and he read it. I could see how his facial expression changed. There was pain etched on his face. My heart broke for him and my best friend. His wife died in a tragic car accident. It was a stormy night. She lost control on the slippery road, she crashed into an oncoming car and when Mr. Crane got to the scene, she was still alive, but she was bleeding to death. She died.

He was devastated at her funeral and everything about it was heartbreaking because this family was built with so much love. I can understand why Mr. Crane doesn’t want to date. She was the love of his life. I never saw them for three months thereafter, but Crislynn and I would always communicate via text. I wanted to give them the space that they needed to grieve. She would always text me just to tell me that she would hear him sob at night and that made her sad and she didn’t know what to do.

As time went on, things became better but not to the extent of fully healing to move on. As I continue to look at Mr. Crane, reading Crislynn’s essay. I could see the devastation becoming evident on his face. A mask that is slipping off, forgetting that I am here.

“I called the pizza place, I am starving,” Mr. Crane pulled his attention away from the essay as he stepped to the side, looking at his daughter. He tried to compose himself and to make sure that the mask was back on. He looked at me as Crislynn packed up her things, his pain still etched a bit on his face. He knew that I saw his mask slip away and then he walked into the kitchen without another word.

# Awkward Discussion

Elona’s POV

I packed up my things because I was done writing the essay. I closed the book that I was writing in, and I left it on the coffee table. Crislynn closed her book and then she packed it in her backpack. I was concerned about Mr. Crane because I saw him read Crislynn’s essay and there was a shift in him. However, he knew that I saw.

I stood up from the floor and Crislynn was texting someone on her phone. I looked towards the kitchen, and I could see Mr. Crane sitting at the dinner table. He was scrolling through his phone; his expression was neutral. I wouldn’t be able to keep my composure after feeling sad just reading about someone that I have lost.

I miss my mother, but it isn’t that much. Sometimes I would shed a tear, but I was young when she died. “You can have a seat at the dinner table,” Crislynn said.

I was hesitant because Mr. Crane was sitting there and my crush on him had somehow increased. I took in a deep breath as I found the courage to walk over to the kitchen. As I stepped closer, Mr. Crane was heavily into his phone.

As I pulled a chair out across from him, it screeched on the floor, and he looked up at me. Those green eyes captivated me, and as I thought that his gaze would hold mine, stopping my heart in the meantime, he lowered his gaze again on his phone and I took a seat.

Now, I was feeling awkward as I clasped my hands on the table with nothing to do and my phone was in my backpack. With relief, Crislynn came into the kitchen. “Dad, table manners,” she said.

“I just need to respond to this email and then you will have my full attention.” he looked up at me, “Both of you,” My heart stopped because his gaze penetrated into me when he said that and then all too soon, he was back on his phone. I swallowed but my throat felt like sandpaper. I needed some fluids in my system.

“Here you go,” Cris placed grape juice in front of me and her father. She went back to get her juice and returned by placing it beside me on the table. The doorbell rang, “That must be the delivery guy,” she hurried out of the kitchen and then as I took my glass of juice, I saw his phone being placed down and he took his glass too.

I looked up at him and he was already staring at me as we took a sip and then, at the same time, we placed it back on the table. He cleared his throat, “Please, don’t say anything to Crislynn about me reading her essay.” he said.

“Um,” I licked my lips and his gaze lowered to them, following the movement of my tongue. “I promise that I won’t tell her anything,” I replied, and he looked into my eyes again.

“Thank you,” he said as Crislynn stepped into the kitchen with two boxes of pizza. “Dad, I know how much you love pizza, so I ordered two and you must be hungry,” she placed the two boxes on the table.

“I’m starving,” he said, but his gaze held mine and I didn’t know if he was doing that on purpose, but I could be wrong too. He had never looked at me like that before.

“Dad, you need to go out more often and not for work…I mean dating,” Crislynn said as she sat down beside me, opening both boxes and the aroma hit my stomach, making it growl.

We began to eat, and I tried not to look at Mr. Crane. “My dating life has stopped and if I were to date, then you would know,” he replied. I still refused to look up at him.

“How will I know?” she asked.

“Do you really want to know?”

“Don’t ask a question on a question, of course I really want to know,” Cris pushed further.

“Well…” I looked up at him as he smirked. He held a slice of pizza in his hand because I was curious to know. He was studying the pizza.

“Please, spit it out, dad. We are dying to know,” Why the hell did she bring me into it now, because he looked up at me, still smirking.

“You would hear me fuck a woman,” I coughed as I choked on my pizza.

“Dad!” I reached for my glass of juice and gulped it down, finally being able to breathe again. I felt Crislynn’s hand pat my back. “You see what you just did to Elona?”

“Are you okay?” he asked as I placed my glass down. He was no longer smirking but concerned.

“Yes, it just went down the wrong pipe,” I said, coughing some more before I continued to eat and looked away.

“Well, soon you will be doing it, and I might as talk about it.” he said, and my eyes found his again. He was chewing and I watched his Adam’s apple move as he swallowed.

“I doubt Elona will do it soon. She is a fucking saint,” I turned my head to her because now she is discussing me.

“Cris, this is about you and your father, not about me,” I chuckled, and I could feel the heat creep up my cheeks, and they must be red now. Now here is the thing with Mr. Crane and Cris. They talk the way that they want to, and I am still respectful to my father. But I loved their kind of relationship too, not that my relationship with dad was any different.

“Soon, Elona will also indulge in sexual things.” When I looked at him, he was watching me intently. “She will experiment, and she might love some things.” it was as if, in this moment, our eye contact pulled me towards him as if it was only the two of us.

“I’m eating dad, next topic,” he snapped out of the trance and took a napkin, wiping his hands and his mouth before his phone rang on the table. “Can’t we just eat in peace without your work bothering you at dinner time?” Cris asked.

“Sorry, I have to take this,” he said as he stood up and walked away.

Cris sighed, “He always does that.”

“He is burying himself in work because that is what he knew since your mother…” I stopped myself from saying anything more.

“It's okay, you can talk about her. I know he has buried himself in work since she passed away. It is three years, and it is by time that I start hearing him fuck someone, at least then I will know he listened to me and dating someone,” her shoulders sagged. As much as I want to be that person that he fucks, I know that it will never happen.

“He will in due time. It’s getting late and I need to be home,” I said as I stood up, “Thank you for the pizza,” I said.

“I love having you around,” she said, “Next time, we should camp outside in the backyard before we drift apart next year, going on our next journey in life,” she said.

“I will still come over no matter what,” I reassured her.

I went to pack up my things and left. Next year, we will be going our separate ways with our chosen fields of study. My heart is sad because I might not be seeing Mr. Crane that much although they live down the street from me. But with Mr. Crane always busy, I’m not so sure. Now and then he would come over to my house to hang out with my dad because they are friends too. So, I hope to see him here more often though.",1,1747183196.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

# Is She The “Wife”？

Angela POV

Pregnant, six weeks.

I stared at the test results in my hands, the paper trembling slightly despite my best efforts to keep steady.

I thought of that wild night.

His fingers curled into the delicate silk, and with one swift motion, the fabric tore.

He followed my collarbone down and kissed his way across my entire body.

My body arched involuntarily, drawn into the inferno of him, my hands grasping at his shoulders, his hair...

""Congratulations, Mrs. Shaw,"" Dr.Morrison's warm voice cut through my daze. ""The initial tests show everything is progressing normally.""

I looked up at her, grateful for the familiar face who had been handling my annual check-ups since I started working at Shaw Group.

""I... thank you, I wasn't expecting...""

""First-time mothers rarely are,"" she said kindly, pulling up my chart on her tablet. ""We'll want to schedule regular prenatal check-ups. Is Mr. Shaw available to join us? We should discuss the care plan together.""

""He's handling some urgent matters at the company,"" I replied automatically.

The truth was, I hadn't even told him about today's appointment.

""Of course, I understand. Wall Street waits for no one,"" Dr. Morrison nodded sympathetically. ""But do make sure to bring him next time. There are several decisions you'll need to make together.""

Together？

Sean and I hadn't made any real decisions together in the two years of our marriage.

It had started as a business arrangement – a way to appease his grandmother's concerns about the family legacy – and had remained exactly that.

My phone buzzed, Sean's name lighting up the screen. For a moment, my heart leaped – had he somehow sensed the news? But the message was purely practical:

""I'm at Metropolitan Club for a meeting. Please bring me an umbrella.""

I glanced at the darkening sky. The weather forecast had mentioned possible thunderstorms, and Sean never liked to be caught unprepared.

I'm not just his wife—I’m also his secretary, and it’s my job to handle any unexpected situations that come up.

I touched my still-flat stomach absently, wondering if this was the right moment to tell him.

""To the Metropolis Club,"" I flagged down a cab and told the driver.

The first fat drops of rain began to fall as we pulled up to the club's entrance. I stepped out, clutching the umbrella, only to be stopped by the security guard's politely raised hand.

""I'm sorry, madam, but we have strict member-only access rules during business hours.""

""I understand, but my husband Sean Shaw is inside. I just need to—""

""I'm sorry, but it's the rule—you can't go in."" The security guard eyed me up and down, his tone laced with disdain. ""Every day, plenty of people show up claiming to be Mr. Sean’s girlfriend or wife. But just now, Mr. Sean already went in with his real wife.""

I froze. What? His wife?

That’s impossible. I took a deep breath and tried to explain to the guard that I was Sean’s wife. The only wife. But he merely shrugged, indifferent.

Frustrated, I pulled out my phone and called Sean. The call was declined.

My heart clenched. I quickly typed out a message:

""I brought you an umbrella. I'm at the club entrance.""

Several minutes passed before his reply came:

""Meeting still ongoing. You can just head back.""

My fingers hovered over the phone.

""I need to tell you something important.""

""We can discuss it at home.""

The dismissal was clear.

I was angry and frustrated, but I forced myself to stay calm. He’s in a meeting right now. A professional secretary wouldn’t disturb him.

Taking a deep breath, I turned to leave—only to freeze in my tracks.

A familiar figure caught my eye.

No way!

That fiery red hair, impossible to ignore. That tall, curvy silhouette. That dangerously tight dress.

Christina Jordan!

The sight of her was like a punch to the gut – she was supposed to be at Paris, not here, not now.

Then, I saw Sean step out—his hand wrapped around Christina’s—as he led her into a room.

Is she the ""wife"" the security guard was talking about?

Is this so-called ""meeting"" just an excuse to meet with Christina?

I was still trying to wrap my head around what I had just seen when two fashionable girls walked out of the club, talking loudly.

“I can’t believe Christina’s back!” one of them said. “I thought she’d stay in Paris.”

“Of course she came back for Sean,”

“Their love story is so romantic!”

“Yeah, I just don’t get it, Sean is so good-looking, why would he end up with the daughter of a bankrupt banker?”

The first girl laughed. “Exactly! Christina’s way out of Angela’s league. Just thinking about Angela’s silly smile makes me lose my appetite.”

...

The words hit like slaps. I took a step back, barely noticing that I'd moved out from under the shelter until the rain was soaking through my blazer.

I turned and walked away, the rain grew heavier, but I barely felt it.

By the time I reached our apartment in the evening, I was soaked to the bone.

James Morrison, our building's longtime manager, took one look at me and immediately sprang into action.

""Mrs. Shaw! Let me call Sarah to bring you some warm towels."" He was already reaching for his phone. ""And I'll have some hot tea sent up immediately.""

""Thank you, James, but I'm fine."" The words came out automatically, even as a shiver ran through me. ""I just need to—""

""What the hell were you thinking?""

Sean's voice cut through the lobby like a whip crack. I turned to find him striding toward me, his face set in lines of anger I rarely saw directed at me.

""Walking in the rain without an umbrella?"" He continued, his voice lowered but no less intense. ""Have you completely lost your mind?""

I felt a lump form in my throat, the frustration rising fast.

Wasn’t I out here in the rain because of him?

I’m carrying his child, running through the storm just to bring him an umbrella—and yet, behind my back, he’s out there dating another woman.

When did Christina come back? How long had they been seeing each other in secret?

The thought twisted in my chest, but I couldn’t even bring myself to confront him. I didn’t have the right.

In everyone’s eyes, maybe Christina was the one who mattered. The one who was really his wife.

""I didn't realize you cared about my well-being,"" I said quietly.

Something flickered in his eyes – surprise, perhaps, at my uncharacteristic show of defiance. Then his jaw tightened, and he stepped forward, sliding an arm around my waist.

""You're freezing,"" he said flatly. ""We need to get you warm.""

I tried to step away, but he tightened his grip, practically lifting me off my feet as he guided me toward the elevator.

""Sean, I need to tell you—"" I started, but he cut me off.

To my surprise, he scooped me up in his arms.

# Chapter 2:

#  Get Out of My Clothes Or Get Out Of My Room?

Angela POV

""Whatever it is, it can wait until you're not at risk of pneumonia.""

I stopped talking and stopped resisting, just lying quietly in his arms.

Just like the two girls at the club said, Sean was unbelievably handsome—strong, sexy, and easy to fall for.

With his dark, wavy hair, olive-green eyes, and that classic Italian look, it was hard not to be drawn to him. His family had come to America from Italy generations ago.

Who wouldn’t be captivated by him? Some of the younger women at the company even joined just because of him.

When Sean carried me into the bathroom, he immediately went to turn on the hot water. The steam began to fill the room, curling around us like a thick, warm mist.

As I started to unbutton my shirt, I noticed he was still standing there, watching me.

I paused, the soft sound of the water filling the silence between us.

""Can you... can you leave?""

He didn’t move. Instead, he leaned casually against the doorframe, a smirk tugging at the corner of his mouth.

""Get out of my clothes or get out of my room?""

Heat rushed to my face.

“That’s not funny!”

I pushed him out of the room, shutting the door behind him with a force I hadn’t intended.

What the hell was he doing? A low laugh escaped my lips, cold and bitter.

Just hours ago, he’d been with Christina at the club. And now, here he was, flirting with me like nothing had happened.

What was I to him? A backup? A distraction? Something to pass the time with?

The pregnancy report was still in my blazer pocket, now wrinkled and damp. I pulled it out carefully, the paper threatening to tear under my shaking fingers.

Six weeks.

The words were starting to blur, whether from tears or water damage, I couldn't tell.

I couldn’t help but think that, when I went to bring him the umbrella, Christina was probably upstairs, watching me through the floor-to-ceiling windows, laughing at me.

Thirty minutes later, I emerged from the bathroom wearing dry clothes.

Sean sat in the living room, his laptop open on the coffee table. A steaming cup of tea waited beside it.

""Drink this,"" he said without looking up. ""It'll help prevent a cold.""

""Thank you."" I settled into the armchair across from him, wrapping my fingers around the warm cup.

The familiar scent of ginger rose with the steam – he'd remembered my preferred tea for warding off illness.

I opened my mouth to speak, though I wasn't sure what I planned to say.

Before I could decide, Sean closed his laptop and moved to stand in front of me.

""Are you mad at me?"" Sean asked, his voice tense. ""I asked you to bring the umbrella, but I didn’t go down to see you. So, you purposely got soaked?""

I wanted to scream yes. I wanted to shout at him, to let him know how hurt I was. But in the end, I just pretended like it didn’t matter.

""No,"" I said calmly. ""I gave the umbrella to a pregnant woman who didn’t have one. She needed it more than I did.""

It was a lie. I didn’t tell him about the pregnancy. And now, with Christina back, everything was more complicated than ever.

He stepped closer, wrapping his arms around my waist. His hot breath brushed against my face, and I realized I was only wearing a thin nightgown.

Through the fabric, I could feel the hard muscles of his chest pressed against me,and the hard cock...

""Really?"" he murmured, his eyes locked onto mine.

I lowered my gaze, unable to meet his stare. But then, he lifted my chin, and before I could react, his lips were on mine.

His kiss caught me completely off guard.

“Don’t. I’m not in the mood, Sean.”

“I know you’re pissed,” he murmured, tugging it loose despite my weak grip. It fell to the floor, leaving me bare—my skin prickling, my breasts heavy under his gaze, the soft patch between my thighs suddenly too exposed.

“Let me make it up to you”

“Sean, I said no,” I snapped, but my voice wavered as his hands found my waist, warm and unyielding, sliding down the curve of my spine to cup my ass.

I pushed at his chest, half-hearted, my resolve crumbling as he pressed me back against the bed.

His lips crashed into mine, hot and insistent, tasting of scotch and unspoken apologies.

I wanted to fight it, but my body betrayed me, arching into him as he parted my thighs with his knee. His hardness pressed against me, teasing the wet heat aching for him.

“You’re an asshole,” I breathed, even as I felt him nudge closer, the tip of him brushing my entrance.

Then the phone rang—sharp, insistent—snapping us out of the haze, leaving me trembling and furious all over again.

Sean pulled back as if waking from a dream, his expression shuttering closed once more.

""Drink the tea and get some rest,"" he said, already turning away, phone in hand.

The night air on the terrace was cool against my skin as I leaned against the railing, listening to Sean's voice drift through the partially open door to his study.

""Yes, of course I'll stay."" His tone was gentle, nothing like the clipped businesslike manner he typically used. ""Don't worry about it. Get some sleep.""

I closed my eyes, remembering a similar gentleness two years ago, when my family's investment bank was collapsing and Sean had appeared in my office with an unexpected proposition.

""Marry me,"" he'd said, no preamble, no romance. ""My grandmother's health is declining, and she needs to know the family legacy is secure. You need financial stability and social protection. It's a sensible arrangement.""

We'd laid out the terms like any other business deal: a two-year minimum commitment, shared public appearances, separate bedrooms, and absolute discretion.

Elizabeth Shaw got her picture-perfect granddaughter-in-law, and I got a shield against the worst of the social fallout from my family's downfall. It had seemed so logical then.

I didn't hear Sean approach until he spoke.

""We should get divorced.""

I turned to face him, oddly calm. The words should have felt like another blow, but instead they were almost a relief. At least this was honest.

""When?""

""Soon."" He leaned against the railing beside me, our shoulders not quite touching. ""After grandmother's heart surgery.""

""Thank you,"" I said softly, ""for these two years.""

Sean's jaw tightened. ""Don't be sentimental.""

But he didn't move away, and for a while we stood in silence, watching the lights of passing planes blink across the dark sky.

Somewhere in the city, Christina Jordan was probably still awake, perhaps planning her triumphant return to Sean's life.

Not that it mattered now.

I walked back into the bathroom, and the tears I’d been holding in finally came rushing out. I didn’t dare let myself sob aloud—if I did, Sean might think I was trying to drag him into some drama. My pride wouldn’t let me show any weakness.

I took the physical exam report I’d carefully dried earlier and, with a steely resolve, I tore it up.

Just then, I heard a knock at the door.

""Are you okay? Do you need any help?"" Sean’s voice was soft, but there was a hint of concern in it.

I quickly wiped away my tears. ""I’m fine.""

He didn’t give up. ""Dinner’s ready. Come join me.""

I hurriedly tossed the torn report into the trash and took a deep breath.

The report lay in shreds at the bottom of a bathroom waste basket, along with the last of my illusions about my marriage.

# Chapter 3: 

# Just the Wrong Medicine

Angela POV

“These are all your favorites,” Sean said, cutting a piece of fish and placing it on my plate.

“Thank you!” I forced a smile, even though something about the fish suddenly made my stomach turn.

It had always been one of my favorites, but now, it felt off. Maybe it was the pregnancy changing my taste, or maybe it was just the overwhelming sadness I couldn’t shake.

Not wanting him to notice, I quickly searched for something to talk about.

""Two years ago, thanks for all your help,"" I said with a smile, looking at Sean.

He seemed a little surprised.

""You don't have to thank me,"" he said softly. ""Our marriage was always a deal. You've helped me a lot, too.""

As he turned to leave the dining table, he suddenly stopped and looked back.

""If you need anything, just let me know. I’ll do my best to make it right. I think we can still be friends after the divorce.""

I nodded and gave a polite smile.

Just friends? If you truly love someone, how could you settle for just being friends?

But if you truly love someone, you’ll understand that sometimes love means letting go.

Sean, I shouldn’t expect anything more from you.

The morning light streaming through our penthouse windows did nothing to ease my pounding headache. I reached for the medicine cabinet, my fingers closing around the familiar bottle of cold pills.

It wasn't until I'd popped one into my mouth that reality crashed back – pregnant.

I rushed to the bathroom, spitting the pill into the sink. Water ran pink with the dissolving medication as I rinsed my mouth repeatedly, heart pounding.

Stupid, stupid, stupid.

""Are you alright?""

I jumped at Sean's voice behind me. He stood in the doorway, perfectly pressed suit a stark contrast to my disheveled appearance in the mirror.

""What's wrong?"" he pressed. ""You seem agitated. Are you feeling ill?""

""It's nothing,"" I managed, avoiding his gaze in the mirror. ""Just took the wrong medicine.""

His reflection studied me for a long moment.

""You should stay home today,"" he said finally.

""I have meetings.""

He made a sound of frustration but didn't argue.

When we prepared to leave，Sean gave me a concerned look .

""Let Peter drive you today,"" Sean said, reaching for his phone. ""You're in no condition to—""

His phone rang, Christina's name lighting up the screen.

He glanced at me before finally answering the phone.

I stepped away, giving him privacy for their conversation, though fragments still reached me: ""...of course... yes, I remember... tonight then...""

The familiar ache in my chest had nothing to do with my cold.

I sent Sean a quick text – “Taking a cab.”

The Shaw Group offices buzzed with their usual morning energy, but today it felt like sensory overload. Every phone ring sent daggers through my skull, every clicking heel against marble floors echoed like thunder.

""Angela, you look unwell."" Emily's concerned face appeared at my office door. ""Are you feeling okay?""

""I'm fine,"" I assured her, though the words felt like gravel in my throat. ""Just didn't sleep well last night.""

""You should take sick leave,"" she pressed. ""The quarterly reports can wait a day.""

I shook my head. ""I need to finish these before the board meeting.""

The truth was, I needed the distraction.

Every quiet moment left me alone with thoughts of the torn pregnancy test in my bathroom trash, of Sean's gentle voice speaking to Christina, of the impending divorce hanging over everything like a guillotine blade.

I was halfway through the quarterly projections when a sweet perfume wafted into my office. Christina Jordan stood in my doorway, resplendent in white Chanel dress.

She walked in, flashing me a smile.

""Long time no see,"" she said, her eyes scanning me from head to toe.

Her tone dripped with sarcasm as she added, ""You look... emm, not so great.""

I forced a polite smile, doing my best to keep my composure. ""Long time no see.""

""Sean told me everything. You must feel awful.""she said, concern etched perfectly across her features.

For one heart-stopping moment, I thought she meant the divorce.

But soon, she feigned sympathy. ""I heard you got caught in the rain last night and got sick.""

""I'm fine,""

""You really should rest,"" she insisted, moving further into my office like she belonged there. ""Sean and I are both worried about you.""

The way she spoke made it sound like they were already married.Of course he'd discussed my health with her. What else did they discuss in their private conversations?

Movement in the doorway caught my attention – Sean himself, watching our interaction with an intensity that made my head spin.

""Why are you being stubborn when you're clearly sick?"" he demanded. ""The company won't fall apart without you. Go home and rest.""

I saw Christina's perfectly shaped eyebrows rise at his forceful tone, saw the surprise flicker across her face at his obvious concern.

""I have work to do,"" I said quietly, turning back to my computer screen.

I couldn't bear to watch another moment of their silent communication, couldn't stand to see the way they gravitated toward each other even when trying to maintain professional distance.

""Angela—"" Sean started, but I cut him off.

""I said I'm fine.""

""We should leave her be,"" Christina murmured, then she linked her arm with Sean's and walked out of my office.

The sight in front of me hit me all over again！

Even though I’m Sean’s wife on paper, we’ve never shown any affection in the office!

It made me really hate school and isolate as well and then I wasn’t set up with job prospects once I graduated because I didn’t have extracurriculars, internships, or opportunities to network.

1km244u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1km244u,Halo Top Mix-Ins,"This week my store had a sale on Halo Top. I have wanted to try the mix ins since they came out and many people have mentioned it. In the past I wasn’t the biggest fan of halo top the ice cream was chalky. They just have changed the recipe of my pallet changed, but this new ice cream was great. It was really creamy and it melted nicely. 

In order from my favorite to least favorite is 
1. Fudge Brownie. The brownies were amazing they had a chewy texture that I love and they were tasty. The swirls of fudge in the chocolate ice cream were great texture contrast with everything. I loved the taste of the chocolate ice cream too. 

2. Cold Brew this one was great too. The coffee ice cream was really strong and the tons of chocolate chunks helped balance out the flavor. This one was a pleasant surprise and the cream swirls were nice. This might not be for people who hate cold chocolate chunks if you have sensitive teeth since they’re pretty big, and get pretty hard. 

3. Strawberry cheesecake. I really liked the strawberry in this it was nice, and fresh and the gram cracker pieces throughout were splendid.  I just wish it had more cheesecake chunks.  

4. Cookies and Brownies. This one was the best of both worlds with the chewy brownies, and the crunchy cookie dough pieces. You have both chocolate and vanilla ice cream too. I liked it a lot I just wish there was more cookie dough. 

5. Cookie dough. This one was good the cookie dough is crunchy and delicious, and it has chunks of chocolate too. I just wish they would add more cookie dough, and the vanilla ice cream is not as good as their chocolate ice cream IMO. 

Overall I’m glad I tried Halo top again. It was definitely a very good experience. I’d recommend any of these to anyone, but for me the fudge brownie one can’t be beat those little brownie chunks need to be sold on their own. ",7,1747182931.0,1500isplenty,1,1.0,False

I’m thinking of doing a birthday run but Idk how else to spend it afterwards. Baka may alam kayong non-mainstream place preferably sa south (para di na din mapagod magtravel or magdrive) or other activities I can do by myself. I wanna spend it alone lang so I don’t need to worry about other people or adjust on anyone else kase they’re tired and they want to go home na haha (We’re a big family with little kids tapos parents ko na can’t keep up sometimes na din hehe).

Husband will be reviewing responses so please respond!,"Please excuse any formatting issues, I’m typing and posting this on my phone. 

I’ll provide some background info to make this post as impartial as possible. I moved to NZ in Jan 2025 to marry him. A few months in, I tried looking for a job but unfortunately was admitted to hospital for 7 weeks. I couldn’t look for a job earlier as I had medical issue after the other. I’ve been out of hospital for 2 weeks now. My husband is the breadwinner. I can’t look for a job as we are travelling to his home country for a month in a few weeks. Once we return, I’ll resume job searching. We are also moving and the rent will be from around $300 to $650 which he has to pay for until I get a job. Thus, I do all the cooking, laundry and cleaning and I don’t let him do a thing. I try not to let him do anything. I always put him before myself. Eg, he had a nice dinner last night and I had instant noodles cause the only food left was for his lunch which I didn’t want to touch (even tho he offered). I cook 2 main meals a week and that lasts us. 

Unfortunately, I’m pretty sure I have rheumatoid arthritis and so my hands and arms are in excruciating pain. I can’t even flush the toilet. This also causes fatigue and depressive episodes (I already suffer from depression and am on anti depressants) and so I only cooked one meal (it wasn’t a quick meal, it had 4 components). Tonight I will cook the second meal as the last meal was eaten by him for lunch today. Thus, there’s nothing to eat. I would cook early today but unfortunately I had a lot of things to do today - go to the pharmacy for medication, have a blood test and get the car looked at. I had eggs for breakfast but due to nothing being ready to eat and not knowing when I’ll be done as I pick my husband up at 6pm, I asked him if I could buy myself a meal from outside, which wouldn’t cost more than $20. Fyi I have to ask him before I buy most things that are more than $5. I have to get his permission for everything. He said no and that I can buy a snack and a coffee. Those wont be sufficient to last me until we get home at 6pm when I will then cook dinner. 

We have bought take out 4 times in the last week or so due to not having groceries and other reasons so I understand his reluctance to spend money but I have no choice but to eat out as I can’t rely on 4 eggs and a snack to get me thru my day, especially due to having a blood test where I feel faint if I don’t eat enough. He gives me an allowance of $30 a week I can spend on what I like but I didn’t want to use my money as the meal would be a considerable chunk of my allowance.

Only after explaining to him in extreme detail why I wanted to buy a meal, he said okay. This was because I would feel faint after the blood test if I didn’t eat, and so wouldn’t be safe to drive. The whole thing gave me the ick and so I just said no, I wouldn’t buy anything. 

My issue is that I shouldn’t even have to ask him if I can buy a meal. I never buy clothing or makeup or anything else. He pays for my eyebrow waxing once a month, this is the only non essential. He should trust me judgment that if I buy a meal from outside, it’s because I had a good reason to. I feel like he treats me like a child, not as a partner. I shouldn’t have to ask permission from him for spending some money. 

He is still insistent on the fact that he did nothing wrong. He said i should’ve cooked the second meal, so it’s my fault there’s nothing to eat and so it’s like I’m being punished. 

I told him I was going to make this post and share it to him so he can see the responses.

**When did it all start?** Oh, yes… In the damn moment that I accepted his proposal and became his girlfriend. If I had known this would happen, I would never have done that.

Another empty drink on the counter bitters my stomach; it dampens my nerves and makes my head foggy.

I gesture to the barman to bring me another one of those — *what was it again?*

Leaning over the counter with my head resting on my arms, I close my eyes and allow myself to relive those damn scenes that brought me to this busy bar in downtown New York… a place that’s always full, regardless of whether it’s a Monday. But unlike all the others who are there to enjoy themselves, I’m just drowning in the disappointment that’s eating me inside.

It’s all because of Eric… My scumbag boyfriend.

Well, *ex-boyfriend*…

It was supposed to be a surprise… He’s so busy with his work, being a successful manager, that lately we have no time together. That’s why I decided to go to his house, cook his favorite food, and maybe give him *something else*. I bought all the ingredients and went happily to his apartment… Of course, I should have known something was wrong when I turned the spare key and noticed his shoes and red heels were carelessly tossed on the floor.

Eric is so… organized. Even when rushing, he doesn’t leave his shoes like this.

But those red heels made a chill go up my spine. I already knew what was coming because I don’t wear high heels — not even red ones. And inside my head, a voice was screaming, telling me to get out of there, to close my eyes and turn my back… But my stubbornness made my legs take on a life of their own.

My footsteps were so silent that even I couldn’t hear them. All I could feel was my heart pounding frantically, threatening to climb into my throat. And with each step towards the half-open door, the noises became more audible — the sound of a kiss, the hollow slam of hips, and husky moans that come from deep in the throats.

Standing in front of the door, I heard my boyfriend’s voice say in a tone that I’d never heard… a voice that showed lust. *“You’re so hot, uhn, ride me, babe.”*

And at that moment, my stomach twisted.

I felt my conviction fail and started to turn away… but then, a woman’s moans echoed through my ears… She said, *“Are you enjoying it? No one makes you feel good as I do, right?”*

My heart stopped beating in that second, but somehow, I was able to open the door quickly, and its noise was louder than the sound of sex.

… And I saw them.

Naked — completely naked.

They noticed me immediately; their faces contorted in extreme surprise and confusion. But I still remember how the red-haired woman, an extremely familiar redhead, was on top of my boyfriend, riding him.

It’s my damn best friend.

My world came crashing down, as did the ingredients I was holding. She pulled back the sheet, and he tripped over his clothes, putting on his underwear awkwardly.

I even remember him saying, *“Angel? What are you doing here?”*

He looked at me and at Laura with a worried expression.

But I blinked a few times, taking in the scene with a mixture of surprise, horror, and curiosity. I knew my eyes were glistening with tears because everything looked blurry in front of me. I spit my lips apart, but they didn’t make a sound.

I simply couldn’t believe that, in our four years of dating, we never had sex. And yet, there he was… with my best friend.

Maybe I was in shock because, despite his protests, I left without saying a word. My legs just acted on their own again, and even as he followed me through the house, I didn’t even look back.

The door I slammed sounded so loud that it still resonates inside my head as I’m standing dumped in this bar, with more alcohol in my system than everything I’ve consumed in those twenty-three years of my life.

Open my eyes, I notice that my drink hasn’t arrived yet. I lift my head and look at the barman, who is looking in another direction. My eyes follow them as if attracted by magnetism… And my expression of confusion soon turns to surprise and dread because a man is walking towards me.

I scratch my eyes, hoping it’s a mirage, an illusion because of the alcohol.

It’s not.

He stops in front of me with a serious expression. His crossed arms bounce off his white shirt, which fits very well on that slightly tanned skin, and it looks so small on his body that it marks every muscle, including his eight packs.

“*Heyyy*, have you put on weight?” I ask in a slurred voice.

“Angelee.” His voice sounds firm, somewhat angry.

I struggle to take my eyes off his tall body that I shouldn’t notice… oh, heavens, I really shouldn’t notice it.

“What are you doing here, Mr. Adams?” I threw my body forward slightly and almost fell off the bench. Fortunately, he’s there to serve me as a wall, and I lean my breasts against his belly, feeling how hard his body is… like a rock.

Raising my eyes, I see that he’s also looking at me… directly into my brown eyes. His hands are on my shoulders, holding me tightly, but his touch is kind, even if he’s pulling our bodies apart.

“I should be asking you this. What are you doing here?” He asks, still with his grave tone, bringing pleasurable shivers to my skin.

“Well, I came to celebrate that I’m single!” I shrug, freeing myself of his hands, and prop my breasts up on the counter, making my cleavage reveal a bit more. “That bastard Eric was sleeping with Laura; can you believe that?”

I snort, with anger and sadness mingling in my slurred words, “It’s not enough that he’s cheating on me... did it really need to be with my best friend?”

Bringing my eyes up to him again, I notice that his gaze is soft now, “Why are you looking at me like that, Mr. Adams?”

“Mr. Adams? Why are you acting so formal?” He brings his hand up to my head and messes up my brown hair in an awkward caress. “We’re not at work now.”

“Oh, that’s right…” I give him a smile, “Right…”

“You’re drunk, Angel. I’m taking you home-”

“No, I don’t want to leave…!” I mumble, leaning towards him again, gripping his waist tightly, “I don’t want to be alone, Julian…”

He passes his arms around my body, and his embrace is warm enough to bring tears to my eyes…

Gosh, his caring touch and gentle hands running down my arms are really awaking things in me. Maybe it’s the drink or the fragility in the face of this terrible situation, but I want to stay in his arms — so I squeeze him tighter, brushing my body against his.

… It reminds me of feelings that I buried a long ago.

“Come on, Angel. We can watch those cheesy movies you like.” He slides his hand through my hair again, pulling it away from my bare shoulders. “It’s better than booze for healing a broken heart-”

“I’m not heartbroken, Julian... *I’m furious!*” I quickly pull away, tightly clutching my hands to his shirt. “He was screwing my best friend but never had sex with me!”

“Angelee…” He’s speechless, looking around, noticing that my tone draws attention.

“He’s a bastard!” I shout and get up from the bench with difficulty, tripping over my legs, “I hate him!”

Julian sighs deeply and passes his arm around my small body, easily supporting me with one hand. With the other, he pulls out his wallet and throws a few hundred bills on the counter, giving the waiter an apologetic smile, “You can keep the change-”

“Damn you!” I shout, remembering that unpleasant scene again. “I’m going to kill you, Eric! I’m going to poison that fucking pie turd!”

Julian drags me out of the bar as I fire curses to the heavens, all directed at that Eric bastard. And just as my throat starts to hurt, I stop and look around, noticing that we’re somehow in front of Julian’s sports car, his baby — as he usually calls it. A black car that, even in the darkness of night, sparkles to the eye.

“Can I drive it?” I point at the car with a giant smile.

“Are you kidding?” He crosses his arms, again drawing my eyes…

What’s wrong with me, anyway?

Julian is… not someone I should look at that way… He’s my father’s best friend!

But still, I catch myself moistening my lips slightly, looking at his body, which is simply a sin. The hours spent in the gym are certainly worth it. And despite my efforts, Julian notices my reaction and a slight cocky smile appears on his lips.

Without saying a single word, he opens the car door and points inside, “Let’s go, Angelee.”

Obeying without complaint, I turn toward him and find that he’s leaning over me, pulling on my seat belt. My eyes sustain his green eyes for a moment, and then I lower them to his lips.

Julian’s scent invades my nostrils — a subtle, masculine cologne that lights a flame in my body, on my lower belly…

I close my legs, pressing my knees against each other, and look away, listening to the low laughter humming in my ears.

“Okay, let’s go home, girl…”

# 02 — Little Angel

Hell.

Fighting a hangover really is hell.

I open my eyes with difficulty, finding a terrible brightness. I groan, turning to the side and it again so my head doesn’t hurt anymore… But realization kicks me, and I suddenly open them once more, jumping up and sitting on the bed BECAUSE THIS ISN’T MY ROOM!

Oh, no.

Running my hand over the white sheets, I let out another grunt, throwing my back again on the mattress…

Damn it.

With my eyes tightly closed, I replay the scenes from last night.

*Buying ingredients to make a pie.*

*Going to Eric’s house.*

*Finding Eric and Laura… Naked.*

*Drowning my sorrows in booze.*

*Meeting Julian Adams.*

Argh! I finally understand why I ended up in Julian’s room… But of all the people I could meet, did it have to be him?

I get out of bed and glance in the mirror, noticing that not only are my eyes smeared with black makeup, my hair is messy, and I have an incredibly hungover expression, but I’m wearing a white shirt much bigger than my body, and that reaches my mid-thigh.

“Great, Angelee…” I mumble at last, entirely ignoring the chaos that’s my appearance and leaving the room to find, who knows, some strong coffee… And *who knows,* Julian may have already left for the company, and I won’t have to deal with this great humiliation…

Yep, it was too soon to say it.

I stop, freezing because Julian is there, leaning against the kitchen island, with a cup of coffee in hand and exposed abs… very exposed.

When his green eyes pause on me, he’s swallowing his coffee, which makes his Adam’s apple move. He lowers his mug, lifting the corner of his lips, “Good morning, Angel.”

I force a smile and move closer to him, reaching over the island to grab the coffee pot and a cup. But because of this innocent movement, my shirt lifts dangerously, revealing a bit of my butt. And I can swear that I see Julian staring at how I’m stretching out, almost sticking my belly on the counter… I catch his eyes going down my hips to my thighs… But he quickly looks away and clears his throat, taking a generous sip of the bitter coffee.

His gaze makes me feel funny even if he didn’t mean to.

When I finally reach over and start putting the coffee in the cup, I massage my temple while the proper dose of caffeine is put in. I even try to bend over again to return the pot to its place, but Julian takes it from my hands and, with extreme ease, puts it back.

I blink in surprise and say with sincere admiration, “What wonderful arms!”

Julian gives a sarcastic smile, “I work them to be.”

“Oh, I can see the effect…” I squeeze his muscle, noting how it’s stiff, and I smile mischievously, “Have you really put on weight?”

“Huh, so you remember that serious offense?” Julian raises an eyebrow.

“Hey, don’t be like that, that’s a compliment!” I slide my hand to his abs, lightly scratching the eight packs, “Keep it up; I’m supporting you.”

Julian clears his throat again, probably feeling a chill caused by my fingernails. Then he adds, in a mischievous voice, “You like my body, huh.”

“It’s good for the eyes, of course I do.” A naughty smile appears on my lips, and I shrug, bringing the cup to my lips. “I can understand why you’re so successful with women.”

He scratches the back of his neck, and I don’t pay much attention to his annoyed expression as I turn away, walking over to the couch… I just listen to him breathing deeply.

“By the way, did you change me?” I ask, throwing myself onto the couch and sipping my coffee. “Your shirt looks great on me. Should I try this style?”

“Very funny. You threw up on your clothes, and I wouldn’t let you anywhere near my bed all puked up.” He grimaces, probably because he had to quickly pick up my clothes and throw them in the washer. “You’re welcome, by the way.”

“Why would I thank you?” I look back over my shoulder, over the couch.

“They called your emergency contact because they would rather not leave a drunk girl alone. Your emergency contact is the *company,* but your father isn’t here… Have you forgotten that he’s traveling on business? I had to go instead…” He points at me, “And for that, you should thank me.”

“You were working that late? I thought your nights were reserved for women.”

Julian smiles sarcastically and places the empty cup on the counter, “Do you think I would come to you if I were with a woman?”

“I think so, yes.” I take a sip of the coffee, enjoying the strong flavor, a perfect measure for that damn hangover….

Then I’m startled to notice that Julian is suddenly too close, his arms on the couch, around my shoulders, murmuring next to my ear, “What a cocky girl…”

A shiver goes up my spine, raising my skin.

“Go get ready. We need to get to work.” He says in a husky voice, “And no, I’m not giving you the day off because you’re hungover.”

I grumble and drink all my coffee in a single gulp, getting up quickly to disentangle myself from his proximity….

What is this feeling... this little chill in my belly? Being around him is making it grow stronger.

“I’m leaving!” I say and leave the apartment quickly because staying inside is really toxic to my heart.

In the empty hallway, I finally inflate my lungs to their max, letting go in the next moment. And with small steps, I’m soon in front of my own apartment door... Because, of course, it’s not enough that Julian is my father’s best friend and my boss — he’s also our neighbor.

As I’m finally inside my home, I realize that I don’t have my phone with me. A growing sense of desperation takes over my chest... But when my eyes go to the couch, I see my purse lying on it — it’s the handbag I had with me last night, I’m sure.

I walk uncertainly over to the couch and pick up the phone that was, in fact, inside it. My head hurts, and the memories floods back… I remember that Julian tried to leave me at home, but when he opened the apartment and pulled me inside, I clung to him and asked him to take me to his place-

*Gosh.*

My cheeks burn, and I know I’m red.

I put my hands on his shirt and felt his warmth, and now I remember how he held me by my waist. His grip was so firm, strong… Just thinking about it makes a shiver run through my body.

Hah, I really shouldn’t have these reactions to my father’s best friend, but… He’s so hot…

Suddenly, more memories come. I remember leaning over his neck to inhale the scent of his masculine cologne and… Oh, no… I licked Julian’s neck!

A grunt escapes the back of my throat, and I close my eyes tightly, bringing my hands to my head — ANGELEE, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

I quickly walk to the bathroom and lock myself inside, leaning against the door. I’m so damn ashamed right now.

Taking a deep breath, I try to forget that disaster… But then, I look at my pitiful reflection in the mirror, and *great,* I look like a real mess. It’s better to take a shower.

As I slowly unbutton his shirt, more memories of my drunk side return... And when I fully open it, I can’t help but hold my breath.

From the reflection, I can see that my plan was really to please Eric, as I’ve chosen my best sexy lingerie. The lacy white bra is so thin and transparent that the nipples can be seen through it, and the panties also reveal much of my pelvis, hiding just my clit like a gift to be unwrapped.

I suppress a giggle, imagining Julian’s reaction to seeing me in this…

Somehow, this idea excites me, bringing a tickle to my belly and making my entrance slightly wet.

“Oh no, this is dangerous…” I think, pressing my thighs together, having some wild ideas.

# 03 — Dumping you

In the end, Julian did give me the day off. It was clear that I didn't have the strength in my body to face workday with such a hangover and sadness surrounding me. And when the hot water fell on my body, I cried like a child who has lost something that can never be replaced.

Honestly, I don't understand why I did it.

Maybe my tears were because I was angry at myself for wasting so much time. The wedding was supposed to be a significant thing for him and his family, especially his mom… so I was willing to wait. But it’s turns out that it only mattered that I was pure — even if I had hard times controlling the heat that often attacked my body.

And I don't know how long stayed in the shower, letting the water mix with my tears… But after the shower, I laid down on the bed that didn't look comfortable as Julian's. Perhaps I fallen asleep, I'm not sure… Eventually, I noticed that my eyes were snapping towards the ceiling and that the birds were singing excitedly outside.

At least someone needs to be happy today.

I hear the phone ring and reach out for it, seeing, on the screen, that there’s dozens of missed calls and many other messages. Inevitably, my stomach twist as I see the nickname in Eric’s contact — *My love*.

Opening the contacts, the first thing I do is change the name to **CHEATER**… It suits Eric much better.

But my peace doesn't last long because soon a new message from the CHEATER appears on my phone and, when I open it, notice that he’s been calling me for the entire night, sending messages at very short intervals.

**\[Please pick up…\]** it was repeated at least twelve times.

**\[I love you...\]** I could see… at least fifteen times.

But the record is, undoubtedly — **\[I am sorry\]**.

I know he doesn't feel sorry, not really. If Eric is sorry about something, it's because he's been caught. There's no way that someone who claims to love me sleep with someone else… let alone my best friend…. Who, by the way, also left some messages, but I won't bother to look.

Suddenly, my phone starts to ring. I watch as the call persists, until it naturally hangs up.

And a new message from him pops up on my cell phone, **\[Could we talk?\]**

Well, it’s better… so we can end this once and for all.

My fingers are steady as I type, **\[Meet me in the coffee shop at seven\].**

There are still a few hours until our meeting, so I toss my phone aside with dry eyes. Somehow, my chest is calm, and I no longer feel like crying.

There are no more tears to be shed for him.

The coffee shop is quiet, maybe because it will close soon.

I chose this place because there's a certain comfort in being here. Many times, during college, we would come after a very difficult exam, or simply because we wanted to stay close. Now that those hectic times are over, we have drifted apart as well.

Even though the beginning was not that way, I did love Eric. On the beginning, I accept his proposal to run away from my feelings… to deny something that was inside me — but I did learn to love him.

Now that we're sitting facing each other, separated by a small wooden table, beside a vast window that shows the busy street of New York, I feel that, perhaps, I didn't love him enough. After all, my chest is so at peace right now.

I should be in tears at that moment, right?

Yet, I feel absolutely nothing… apart from a bubbling anger.

“Angel…” Eric's voice is meek, and I can see the fear in his expression; his lips are curved downward, and his eyes are slightly reddened. Perhaps he has been crying. “Why have you been ignoring me like that…?”

“Why?” I interrupt him harshly, “You betrayed me, Eric. You cheated on me with my best friend.”

“I can explain, it's not like that-”

“Let me guess, you *accidentally* got naked, and she *accidentally* rides on you?” I frown when find him evidently embarrassed.

Eric shifts uncomfortably in his chair, bringing his hand up to the back of his head.

“I know I made a mistake, Angel, but believe me… there's nothing between me and Laura…”

“Except that you fucked her.” I cut him off again, feeling my blood boil even more.

“It was only sex… I'm a man, Angel. I have desires, it's natural…”

I scoff, crossing my arms and averting my eyes — really, I can't believe what I'm hearing.

“You're the one I love, you know that.”

“Oh?” I turn my eyes back to him, so sharp they could cut. “What I know is that I keep my virginity for you while you were cheating on me. Four years, Eric!”

“Dear, you know how important this is to my family… I love you so much, and I want us to have our first time when we're married-”

“That's bullshit.” I point my finger at him, “You don't make sense.”

“Look, it's like when you leave your favorite food to eat at the end…”

“Did you really compare me to a damn food?” I slam my hand on the table, drawing attention and curious eyes to our conversation.

“Angel, honey, don't be like this, that's not what I meant. I just… want you to understand that I want to preserve you… I didn't want to ruin what's between us…”

“So, because you can't keep in your pants, you chose to cheat on me, rather than do what is expected — like sleep *with your girlfriend?*” I shake my head, “I respected you. I waited for you because I thought virginity was something important to you-”

“Virginity is something important to me, honey…”

“*Mine*. My virginity is important to you. It should be ours! We should lose it together, on our honeymoon! That's what I expected when you said that your family wants to wait!”

I feel tears return to my eyes and a lump settle in my throat. I'm stressed and angry… I can even feel the muscles in my shoulders tensing.

“You're so precious to me, my angel, believe me….”

That's enough. I can't stand to hear his voice anymore.

I stand up, watching as his eyes widen and become desperate. He tries to take my hand, but I pull it away… And I know my eyes are cold, that he's not recognizing me at this moment… After all, just to please him all this time, I pretended to be someone I'm not.

For him, I held myself — and I'm tired of doing that.

Now, I'll do whatever I want.

“You don't have to worry about that anymore, Eric. From this moment on, there's not the slightest possibility of you touching me, now or in the future.”

“Angel-”

“And if you don't understand what I mean, it's that I'm dumping your ass, Eric.” I give a sweet smile, “I'm dumping your fucking ass.”

Before he can stop me, I quickly leave the coffee shop and, thank heavens, manage to get into a cab before he can catch me up. And as the driver goes to the address I gave him, by the streets of New York City, I listen to the song playing on the radio, enjoying the irony of the lyrics, which talk precisely about breakups.

My chest feels lighter, but anger still bubbles up inside my veins.

All I want is to get rid of this burden — to be free, to be myself.

And before I know it, I'm already in front of my building… In the elevator.

The number 12 flashes on the display, and the metal doors finally open. There are only two apartment blocks, Julian’s, and mine. The hall connecting our doors suddenly seems smaller and empty, as if there's no furniture, although the couches and everything is in its place.

I take a deep breath, filling my lungs to the peak.

And I swear I can smell Julian's scent… The smell that I felt impregnated into the skin of his neck. Just remembering makes a shiver goes up my spine.

*Can I really do whatever I want?*

“Hah, Eric… For four years, you made me keep my virginity…. Because you wanted to marry a virgin, you made me be pure…. And yet, you cheated on me all this time?” I mutter to myself, staring at Julian's door. “Looks like your angel is starting to fall.”

My legs seem to take on a life of their own because instead of going to the door of my apartment, they go to Julian’s — and my hands also act on their own by pressing the doorbell.

It doesn't take long before the door opens, revealing that incredibly beautiful face and wet blond hair… Once again, his scent now really envelops me.

“Angelee?” He looks at me confused.

But I just open my lips, saying slowly… “Julian, I want you to fuck me.

# 04 — Take my virginity

Julian looks at me with a serious expression… He blinks a few times, trying to understand my words, seems like hallucinating…. “Say again?”

“I want you to f-” Julian pulls me by the arm into the apartment, preventing the word fuck from fully escaping through my lips again.

He closes the door with one hand, keeping his fingers firmly around my arm… His firm touch makes me even more sensitive.

“Are you high?” Julian asks seriously, and in the face of my rolling eyes, as I disengage myself from his grip, he completes, “You're definitely high.”

“Why are you looking at me like I'm insane?” I cross my arms, making my breasts bounce in my cleavage. And I can swear that this draw Julian's eyes for an instant, even if he quickly turns away.

Hum…

“Because you seem to be high.” He sighs, running his hand through the blond hair, “Are you listening to yourself?”

“Yes. I want you to take my virginity.” I say firmly, and he grunts, “Listen, it makes sense! You're handsome, women are always at your feet, and you're great at having one-night stands!”

“You're not serious.”

“Yes, I am. Besides, you're my friend…”

“And *your father's best friend*.” He stresses, “Need I mention that I'm ten years older than you?”

“That means more experience…. And that's all a virgin need!”

Julian gives a dry laugh, crossing his arms as well, “Let's consider that none of that matter. Still, I don't do with virgins.”

“Why?” I ask, disappointed, shrugging my shoulders.

He sighs, gritting his teeth…. “Angelee, you shouldn't act like this just because it didn't work out with an asshole. You're still young, surely, you'll meet someone who will be worth the wait…”

“No, I'm not doing this to get back at him.” I turn away, walking around the apartment, feeling my nerves flare. “You don't understand… It's not like I wanted to wait this long.”

Julian frowns, as I sit down on the stool, “What do you mean?”

“Because he wanted to marry a virgin, I had to refrain for four years! But while I was holding back, he was sleeping around! I was frustrated for four years, Julian!” I throw my body back, leaning against the kitchen island, and add with a grunt, “He had the nerve to say I'm like the favorite food he leaves to eat last! Really, I can't believe I wasted so much time over a bastard like him!”

He approaches in silence, as if his mind is full of thoughts… and stops in front of me.

I look at him again with a conflicted expression.

“He hasn't even touched me properly this whole time… You know what I mean? I don't want to lose my virginity because I'm angry at Eric. I'm just tired of having to satisfy myself alone. Hah, I feel like an idiot.”

Julian swallows dryly — I watch his Adam's apple move slowly, drawing my eyes.

“You know… maybe the problem is me.” I mutter, lowering my head and averting my eyes from him, staring at the pale skin of my thighs.

“You're not the problem, Angel.” Julian says in a low, slightly husky tone.

When I raise my eyes shyly and meet his, he swallows dry again.

“No, I'm sure… I can't make a man horny…” My voice fails me the next moment, when Julian's hands are spreading my knees, making room for his body to fit between my open legs.

Resting his hands on the kitchen island, as if cornering me, Julian presses his hips against mine, rubbing his hard-on directly between the middle of my legs.

*Oh my Gosh.*

I hold my breath and seal my lips, trying to keep any sound from coming out between them, and I see a discreet smile rise on Julian's lips.

“See? You're not the problem…” He says, taking one of his hands off the counter, sliding down my arm until it reaches my hip.

I think I'm dreaming-

My thoughts are interrupted as Julian pulls my hip towards his and pushes himself harder against the most sensitive part of me — and this time, I can't hold back the low moan that escapes loudly.

I stare at Julian lips as he says slowly, “If there's anything wrong, it's certainly with that asshole… Especially when you're in that underwear…”

A silly smile appears on my lips as I blink slowly, leaning in slightly, “Did you like it?”

“If I like it?” He leans in as well, bringing our faces even closer together, sliding his hand into my bare thighs, up my skirt, threatening to reach my crotch. “I've been having a hard time to forget… as you can tell.”

Giggling, I cross my legs around his hips.

I simply love how Julian looks surprised and how he holds his breath, closing his eyes, trying to change his thoughts.

Huh, I can feel his warmth invading my body, mingling with mine, and can even smell the scent of his cologne sinking deliciously into my skin.

“We shouldn't be doing this…” He mumbles, still with his eyes closed, as if reason is winning the battle inside his mind…

“And why is that?” I murmur back, brushing my lips against his chin, threatening to rise.

“You are… My best friend's daughter…”

I slide my hands down his shirt slowly, exploring the fabric that tickles my fingers, until finally reach the waistband of his pants. I bite my lips, and I know he can feel it because my teeth rub against his chin as well.

His heat is rising up in my head.

I know I'm losing my mind.

I know shouldn't be running my hand down his pants, almost touching the erection that, unfortunately, is no longer touching my panties.

And he knows that as well — because his hand holds mine firmly, preventing me from continuing.

“Angel…” My nickname escapes so subtly through his lips that it makes my skin shiver.

“No one needs to know, Julian.” I whisper, moving my lips up to meet his, subtly brushing our mouths together as I add in the same low tone, “Just once.”

“I don't want to hurt you.” He says, almost in a whisper, against my mouth. His eyes are intense, and I can find hunger shining in them.

Lowering my eyes, I finally understanding why he doesn't do with virgins. In fact, just by feeling him rub against me, I know he's huge. And this should probably scare me, since I have never dared to thrust my own fingers, but… Gosh, I'm so horny.

I want him.

“I don't care.” Disengaging the hand he holds, I finally move down to the erection that, even inside his pants, I'm unable to hold properly. I try to squeeze it and hear a hoarse moan escaping from deep in Julian's throat.

My body is so hot… it's like I'm a volcano with years of delayed eruption.

“Julian…” This is the thread of sanity that's missing for his conviction to break.

He holds my nape abruptly and pulls me into a fervent kiss, tasting my lips first before forcing it to part, to put his tongue into my mouth, causing pleasurable shivers when it touches and intertwines with mine.

And he’s pressing me further against his hip, this time properly fitting his hard-on on the middle of my legs, rubbing against my clit, while pressing my breasts against his chest, making the kiss deeper and more passionate…

While one hand dictates the rhythm by holding my nape, I can feel the other hand lowering the strap of my top and bra, which may not be the same one he saw last night, but will certainly be scratched in his mind.

And when he unlinks his fingers from my hair, bringing both hands down to my hips, I expect him to lift me off that damn bench and carry me to bed… Indeed, Julian does seem to be about to do that… Except that the apartment bell rings, so low that we don't pay much attention.

But the second attempt is fast and frantic, which makes our mouths part slowly.

With his eyes closed tightly and his hard-on throbbing inside his pants, against my wet panties, he remains still, without moving a single muscle.

I pray to the heavens that the bell doesn't ring again, so I can continue to delight in his touch… But that's not what happens, of course.

Julian lowers his head and grunts, apparently annoyed and disappointed.

When he raises his green eyes and inspects my face, Julian brings his hand lovingly to my cheek, depositing a quick kiss on my lips.

“I'll be right back…” He says, stroking my cheek with his thumb before pulling away.

My heart is beating frantically… so fast it might rip through my chest.

*What the hell am I doing?*

I press my knees against each other, trying to get rid of the tickle that's taking over my belly….

“Cathy?” Julian's surprised voice brings me back to sudden reality.

Oh… Of course… My sudden visit probably spoiled his plans…

I feel a mixture of anxiety and sadness hammering in my chest, but I struggle to get up from the stool and pull my skirt down, while fixing my hair which has likely been messed up by the fervent kiss.

Kiss.

I kissed Julian Adams….

My father's best friend.

“No, I'm a little busy right now…” Julian says, with his arm blocking the way into the apartment. But when I approach and place my hand on his back, I feel him freeze immediately.

*Don't worry, Julian… I won't ruin your evening.*

“It's okay, I'll be right there. Thanks for the advice, I’m going to home.” I give a sweet smile and look at the tall girl, who is looking at me surprised and somewhat… angry?

Blonde, blue eyes, thin… Yes, this is exactly Julian Adams type….

My complete opposite.

Fearfully, Julian pulls back his arm and allows me to pass.

With my cheeks burning with embarrassment and perhaps other feelings I wouldn't want to admit even to myself, I retreat from the apartment. But before turning my back, I greeted this Cathy with a friendly smile.

My steps are quick, and soon I'm unlocking my door which, fortunately, is straight ahead, so I can disappear from the sight of both.

The thud of the door echoes too loudly. And as I’m leaning my back on it, I lower my eyes, listening to what is going on outside.

1km1zi6,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1km1zi6/one_week_in/,One week in,"Hello comrades. One week in!

  
Pointing towards celibacy and not gooning at all, want to hit some months in controlling my energy.   
The withdrawal has been insane, I even fell ill on my stomach, headaches, and insomnia. 

  
As many of our brothers, I started young, 15 years old. Have been having premature problems when I hooked up or tried to have a relationship. So now at 33 years old, I am changing everything possible to fend off the dopamine empire that tried to strangle us with the constant barrage of quick fixes. I have become somewhat of a Luddite tbh. 

Been practicing some of the sexual kung fu stuff by this Jonathan White, but I am rejecting edging, because every time I try to edge, I am unable to stop and go over the border. Everything else seems like good advice, like for example the meditations and trying to relax the nervous system in general. 

I have been feeling very good today, and have stopped coffee and weed consumption as well, maybe it is too much, but I am sick of being controlled by external factors and have had enough! Interestingly going cold turkey with weed and coffee is waaaaaay simpler, I simply do not buy it and thats it. But porn is two clicks away and it is for the most part, free. I feel this is by design, but I am not sure I am being too schizo about it, but really feels that way. They KNOW this is addictive. 

  
Has anyone else tried any classes by this Jonathan White? What did you like about it? Manktak Chia was sincerely incomprehensible and there was too much mumbo jumbo for my westernized mind, not saying it does not work, but this Jonathan guy gets to the point.

My wife have had medical problems before we got married and it continued through the start of our marriage and she recently came out of the hospital 3 weeks ago.
Since my wife still doesnt have a job due to her medical issues, we have decided that i will be the sole provider and she will do the house chores, i have never prevented my wife from buying any essentials she needs and i give her pocket money fortnightly to use as she pleases.
Since we usually meal prep the house chores come out to around 5 hours cooking and 1 hour of cleaning in total per week that my wife tends to spread around the week as she gets tired easily, i always offer my help whenever i can and never pressure her to overexert her self but last week in particular we had to order takeout 4 times and we are moving/traveling soon so money is tight.
Fast forward to today, My wife had a few errands to complete from some scans the doctor ordered to car inspections and we didn’t have any more meals left as my wife was due to cook later tonight, my wife wanted to buy takeout since she still has a long day and i suggested she buys a snack and coffee since we want to try to cut back on takeout after last week expenses.
My wife thinks that its cruel from me to say that as she will have to through the day filled with errands without a proper meal and after she explained that to me i told her that she has a point and told her that she can get takeout but my wife is still mad about my initial reaction and says that i dont trust her judgment, i am open to admit that i am wrong but i just wanted opinions if i am not being fair with our arrangment and my initial reaction.",2,1747182291.0,AmItheAsshole,31,0.58,False

To be able to wrap myself around you while we slip away into ecstacy 

The consumption of one another until we are completely spent

so i’m still very early in my pregnancy (10 weeks) with my second. this pregnancy is SOO completely different than with my first born. with my daughter i had like, no pregnancy symptoms. it was a very smooth sailing pregnancy. but i have been going through HELL with this one lol. 

anyways- i’ve had a REALLY bad headache for about a week now. i get some relief for a couple of hours but it comes back. it’s on my right side of my head and it’s just killing me. tylenol is not cutting it, my blood pressure is fine so i know it’s not my BP. has anyone else experienced anything like this? any remedies? i have a diffuser running with essential oils, i drink PLENTY of water (that’s all ive drank 14+ years, not lying. soda and coffee make me absolutely sick as hell to my stomach.) 

i have an appointment with my OB tomorrow and will definitely be mentioning it but ugh. please. something. i’m not really sure if i need to go to ER since it’s been pretty persistent for a week now. i have no other symptoms stemming from the headache- no dizziness or anything like that. just, normal pregnancy symptoms like morning sickness (i’ve been like. so sick, everyday. most of the time it’s just nausea, no throwing up) and my boobs hurt so bad. i haven’t been able to sleep the best either, im waking up every hour to two hours really.

2. I’m an LGBTQ+ ally, so I don’t want to be in an environment where that’s not accepted. I’m hesitant to go to church groups where they believe the opposite for the most part in my experience. I was thinking that maybe there are a few allies in there that go to some of the churches, but I’d feel very alienated if the majority doesn’t believe in acceptance for that. 

I also don’t care for church services even at LGBTQ+ accepting churches as they still bore me, and am looking for more of a hobby/hangout environment to be apart of outside of work. I love sports, martial arts, theater, music, food, and good coffee. ",8,1747181929.0,Modesto,1,0.9,False

My girlfriend and I had planned a short beach trip, took off Thursday, and checked in looking forward to a decent stress-free weekend. The hotel lobby was clean, the staff seemed polite, and the room looked fine at first glance. I did a quick bed bug check like usual, but only in two corners (my mistake) then we dropped our bags and went out to explore. After a decent first day and a good nights sleep, we spent Friday at the beach and came back in during a storm. I woke up early the next morning with an itch on my shoulder and saw a bug crawling on me. At first I thought it was just any typical Florida bug like an ant or something, but I knew exactly what it was when I flicked it onto the duvet. THE bed bug.

Immediately I took pictures and caught it in a paper coffee cup. We bagged all our stuff and I flipped the mattress and started digging. Sure enough, more evidence, more photos and more bed bugs. My girlfriend was in the bathroom the whole time saying 'oh my god, oh my god...', but I don’t blame her since it was pretty emotional to discover on the second night. We went to the front desk and showed them the bug cup. The manager was sympathetic and offered to move us, but I requested an early checkout instead. They agreed and showed me how to start the refund process through Expedia (Expedia was great and it wasn't a hassle at all). The hotel’s Executive Housekeeper met us in the room and admitted there was a bed bug issue after calling the evidence “disgusting” but upper management refused to give me a written statement confirming the incident. To be fair they did give us trash bags when we asked so we could pack everything that was in the room :)

What followed? A miserable morning at a coin laundromat deep-cleaning everything and googling how to avoid bringing bugs home. I’m still anxious about whether we managed to decontaminate everything and honestly it took a real psychological toll on both of us. Lesson learned, trust no-one, especially not management.

TLDR: I paid nearly 1k to stay at the DoubleTree in St. Augustine and brought home a traumatic bed bug experience. Staff were polite and I got a refund at least. If you’re traveling: check every corner of every bed before you unpack. Then check again. If anyone plans to stay in St. Augustine don't make my same mistakes. 

What do I do now?   
  
Every time I see a piece of lint on the floor of my bedroom, my blood pressure rises.

I can't believe the number of partners I'm hearing from who have been SENT HOME today over the most inconsequential dress code violations. Yesterday, I heard someone in front of me in line ask for a grande water and they were told they could only get a tall. Then they asked if they could have two talls and were told no (they ordered food and a latte). A black man who is a local author was at the store near my home and DARED to sit down with his laptop at the table before ordering and was asked to leave and had the police called on him (he is a regular at Starbucks). I can visually see the stress on the baristas' faces for having to somehow serve cafe, drive, and mobile and write on EVERY cup. As someone with a chronic illness (Crohn's), the bathroom rules are also horrible. Would they rather have people have accidents in the store? How often does one have to buy something? Does earlier that day count if you're on a road trip?

Me and my nesting partner (will abbreviate NP) started out by practicing monogamy, but we always had the intention to transition into a polyamorous relationship praxis. A few years back we did just that. At the time I was not stressed about getting more partners and I had previous experience with poly relationships (been practicing in various constellations for about 15 years before I met my current NP). My NP was on the other hand excited and happy to start dating and had several shorter relationships over the first year, she then met her first deeper connection and they were important parts of each others lives for about a year, about the same time that they met I also met someone who over the course of that year became very important to me. 

The person I met was not interesting in polyamory but was initially expressing curiosity around the idea, was however certain that she could not fall in love with multiple persons at once. By pure coincidence it jsut so happened that my metamour and my NP broke up, and about a week after that my newer partner decided that they could not come to terms with certain aspects of poly life and we decided to severely deescalate, still remaining friends. In order to give ourselves some amount of autonomus reflection space we decided to spend 3 months with very limited communication and no physical contact. As the summer came to an end we decided to meet up again. All feelings were still there and we started hanging out again, but carefully and slowly. Over the summer she had realized a few things; she did not mind me having other partners but she had very little interest in being too included in my life, and I saw no reason to object, I thought that was a reasonable position even if it did not completely mesh with my personal wish to have partners know each other (primarily something I find practical when it comes to bigger life events etc). I still expressed that I personally would have preferred something else but that I was ok with the compromise. 

Fast forward a bout 7 months, to present time. My NP has since I got back together with new partner grown increasingly anxious and worried and angry with the way that my relationship with new partner has evolved and found stability after reuniting. The way she explains her feelings is that she feels like our relationship is being damaged by them not getting to know each other, that she feels left out or like I am cheating on her with someone (they have met once, over coffee and it was very nice and they both liked each other). I have tried keeping NP in the loop about my new partners wish to not get too included in mine and NPs life (that she has no wish to get to know my NP for example) and I have mentioned that I have expressed that I honestly wish that they could at least on some kind of courteous level be more familiar with each other, but that I also do not want to try to convince my new partner to do something that they have clearly expressed as a limit. My NP does not care about that and insists that they should meet or that I should break up with the new partner. 

These arguments have become increasingly difficult. I've explained that if I break up with new partner that i truly love to save the relationship with NP I will feel anger and sadness towards NP and risk becoming bitter and resentful. If I would try to convince new partner that they should meet I would go against all of my own ethics and coerce someone into something they do not want. I have also asked NP if the issue is that they do not wish to be in a poly relationship, to which they consistently respond that they wish to go on living as poly. I have tried talking to her about what the fears and pain is coming from, since I have noticed before this that similar anxiety attack have occurred when I have been indisposed for non-romantic reasons also, for example with friends etc. She seems unwilling or unable to really consider that the reactions she is having around being left out and excluded could have a deeper traumatic background and insists that the problem is that ""I have chosen to initiate a relationship with someone who does not want to be poly"". 

Ok, not sure what I am asking here, but I guess that any input could help me see things from another perspective. I guess I also could be wondering about if there are others who can identify with what I am writing. And of course any type of reflective and constructive advice is appreciated.

I was excited to spend time with the 3 of us women. A girl's trip!

But my mom feels so pathetically bad for my father. Now she's making him come along on the trip because she says, ""I feel bad that he would sit home by himself."" 

He's a grown man. There is nothing wrong with certain family members going on a trip. She always does this.

She treats him like a child, and he certainly acts like one. And I'm sorry but he is incompetent and having him come along is an extreme handful. 

Now I have to make reservations for my dad's hotel room because he doesn't know how and is extremely incompetent. He also doesn't have a credit card to hold a room. I gave him the dates and the number for the hotel, along with my card, but he had a tantrum that the hotel didn't pick up the phone and he doesn't know what to do. He is also confused by the dates, thinking June 27th is on a Saturday. He can't even look at a calendar right. He is not ""slow"" by any means - this is weaponized incompetence and acting like a child.

And guess who has to pack his suitcase, load up the car, and make sure he's fed? ME. Meanwhile my mom and I would just get coffees for the ride, but he needs snacks even when I have a rule about not eating in my car. And I feel bad for my 90 year old grandmother who now will make food for him, when she didn't need to before.

I don't want to drive with him in the car because he is extremely anxious and has no manners, and it makes me uncomfortable and stressed - he cracks his knuckles, he clicks his tongue on his teeth, he moans and groans. His nose runs and drips all over the place because he doesn't know it's dripping. It's too much stress when I already have to drive on a highway, which is very scary for me.

And now anything my mom and I wanted to do together is squashed because she's making me account for what he wants to do. My mom and I wanted to go to this one restaurant, but now we can't because he doesn't like the food and according to my mom ""we can't go out and eat without him, that's not fair""

My experience in work falls into food and coffee. Most of my experience has been working coffee as a cashier and Barista.

I've also worked in a coffee shop/bakery and was pretty good at explaining the different baked goods we had.

I'm trying to make my living feel more cohesive, clean, and aesthetic (all on a budget). Right now it feels very busy, and I'm not a fan of the rug we have. I moved into my boyfriend's apartment and I'm trying to spruce it up a bit, but we live in a very tight space and trying to save a lot of $$$ so that adds to the challenge.

Some things I'm struggling with:  
\- Not a fan of the rug, as it feels a bit dull/dark to me, but not sure what would look best in this space. Ideally, we want a budget friendly option, less than $300-$600. Open to different colors, styles (contemporary, trendy, Persian, etc). I'm still open to red, but want it to look more...bright/happy?  Not sure what the word is.  
\- I have pets, so although I value a bright space, a very light colored (eg white) rug is not ideal. Color and lower ply is best.  
\- i want to hide the treadmill leaning up against the breakfast bar in the background, but not sure how to do so. We live in a small space, so the fitness equipment can't really me moved anywhere else

Some ideas I have about decluttering/simplifying the space:

\- Purchase a cute basket for my cats toys (right now it's a chewed up cardboard box you see next to the couch 😅)  
\- Purchase a new shoe rack (next to the tv) with doors to hide most of the shoes. Not sure what would be a good option/style for this room either :(   
\- We had an oriental coffee table and a dark gray couch. I already bought an ivory, custom couch cover and the new coffee table you see in the photos below. it's really the rug and the rest of the space that I'm now struggling with.

  
Thank you for any advice :)

I'm planning to get a Fellow Atmos for storing my coffee beans and I need help deciding between the manual and electric versions. 1.2 L

Here’s what I’m looking to understand:

1. Manual vs Electric:
What's the practical difference between the two?
Is the electric version worth the extra price in terms of daily ease, vacuum strength/duration, or build quality?
I don’t mind the manual work if it holds up as well or better long-term.


2. Storage in the Fridge:
I store my beans in the fridge — specifically:

Arabica medium roast

Excelsa medium roast

Liberica dark roast


Does one model handle cold/fridge conditions better? Any issues with vacuum retention, seal degradation, or material warping?


3. Material & Color – Clear vs Black vs White:
I like the clean look of the clear version, but I'm aware UV exposure can affect freshness.
Since I store in the fridge, is clear fine—or still risky?
Which would you recommend based on experience?



Looking for brutally honest, performance-first advice — not just aesthetics. I’d rather invest once in something that actually protects the beans well.

sleep matters.
eat something. not just caffeine.
don’t discuss the test outside the center. it messes with your head.
read the ethics section again if you can. it saves lives (and scores).
pack your stuff the night before: calculator, passport food, etc.

and if you feel like you’re blanking out — pause. close your eyes. breathe. you’ve studied. you’ve prepped. your job now is to just stay calm & read each word carefully.

11 days, 7 hours nicotine free, considering vaping again. 

I used to Juul and the pods leak on EVERYTHING, 
I would wipe it on my pant, on my sheets, everywhere without thinking about it. I’m worried constantly that the juice will absorb in my skin from the couch or anything else it leaked on, so I don’t feel like I can relax at home. I constantly wash my hands and change clothes.

I work at a coffee shop and the ice machine and break room are in the back, it is a tiny space also used for storage. People are always vaping back there and my boss will make me go back and grab things from the room while people are actively vaping there. I am worried that inhaling their vape smoke or being around it is making it hard to quit and prolonging withdrawals. 

OCD for me is wanting to feel in control in world where I never fully am. If anyone’s gonna expose me to nicotine, id rather just be a smoker / vaper when it seems like it’s all around me anyway. Idk what im looking for I guess if anyone has more information on second vape / smoke and how much it matters. Also how hard is it to find a job where you’re not around people vaping it seems everywhere….

1km18hn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1km18hn,"After 9 months of exhausting work and lonely nights, I just opened my dream store with my art!! ✨️😭🥳🥰🙏✨️","Please celebrate with me because this has been one of the most demanding, intense, and challenging developments ever! Last year, I overcame the struggle of unemployment and food insecurity and got a job in, of all places, the Empire State Building! (That was actually my last post here lol.) The job allowed me to get above survival for the first time in my adult life and fall asleep in peace - a dynamic that evaded me for years - especially during the pandemic. 

While it was a massive relief to have a regular paycheck, it still wasn't enough to really thrive, especially because of cost of living increases, inflation, you name it. I also had almost no time to paint and began searching for a way to self-express and develop my art while pressured from a day job. I shared my story with one of the interns who wanted to meet to see if we could work together to build a project on the side. ""I've always wanted to have a client,"" she said. ""I love consulting!"" 

A few days later, we met in a coffee shop, opened our laptops, and I shared my ideas for taking the art that got me through the pandemic and turning it into a store; a space that would offer products with my art on it. Neither of us knew what we were getting into. I certainly had no background, knowledge, or expertise in starting or running a business like this. All I knew how to do was.....paint 🥲. 

That initial meeting turned into another, and then another, until I had chosen a manufacturer and secured a website. Next came the designs. This part took months because it was necessary to choose which products to offer. What did people like? I had no idea. What should the prices be? Again, no idea. The worst moment came one afternoon when I had finished uploading all 200 designs. The manufacturer messaged me to say an error occurred with the final product. I figured it was just a technical glitch. Nope. All 200 products were designed and uploaded incorrectly, meaning they all had to be redesigned with the 'correct' DPI (dots per inch.) I fell to the floor in exhausted frustration. Weeks upon weeks of work, useless.🫠

It had to get done though, so I stood up after drying my tears and got back to work on product number 1 of 200. Several weeks later, they were done - thankfully, correctly! And after weeks of calls and emails and research, shipping and rates were settled. I couldn't afford to hire models, but my friends stepped up to the challenge by volunteering to help. Their empowerment has made all the difference in the world (you'll see some of them in the pics, with their consent given) and this was only possible because of their empathy, solidarity, and decency. 🫂

My hope is that this post and these words encourage you to pursue your goals, align with your vision, and most importantly, to push through the hardship - whatever form that takes for you - because you deserve to be happy. Even if you have to start from 1 out of 200 all over again, and even if you have no idea how it's going to happen, you can do it because your happiness is worth it.

1km15dc,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1km15dc/a_world_not_his_own_fantasy/,A World not his Own [Fantasy],"Waking up on the side of a dirt path, with forest surrounding him, was the last thing Callum expected when he passed out last night. He had been on a bit of a binge, drinking more than he cared to count with a couple of buddies from High School. Josh and Fred must have decided to play a trick on him, leaving him in the middle of nowhere.

*They even changed him. What were they thinking?*

He could have sworn when he passed out he was just in a casual blue button-up, ripped jeans, and some plain running shoes. Now he wore a tunic, almost knee length made of some kind of cheap material, wool he thought and some brown trousers tied at the waist with some simple rope. At least they got his size right. His feet were covered, but barely, in what looked like some rough leather. There were hardly any soles, so he felt almost barefoot when he placed his feet on the ground.

“Did they drop me off at a Medieval convention or something?” Callum whispered to himself while walking down the dirt path. His phone and wallet were also gone.

Guess there was no calling an uber. They’d never gone this far in their pranks… this was weird. Hopefully he was going the right way, there were two directions he could have picked. You’d think they would have given him a hint at least, left him at a sign, but no he was left in the middle of nowhere.

“Just great.” He muttered as he kicked a rock across the path and it disappeared into the green brush of the forest. Callum sighed, squinting up at the sky. He was glad he got a haircut recently. The short black hair allowed him to really feel the breeze hit his face and neck.  At least it was nice out today.

The sun was shining with not a cloud in the sky and he couldn’t imagine how miserable he’d be if it was raining, the horror. Still, this had to be one of the dumbest pranks Josh and Fred had ever pulled. What was the endgame here? Wait until he wandered into town looking like an extra from Game of Thrones?

Callum scratched at the tunic, it was itchy as hell and he’d kill for some coffee, or even a bottle of water right now. He kept walking, sticking to the dirt path because honestly what the hell else was he supposed to do?

His stomach grumbled. When was the last time I’d eaten anything? He couldn’t remember. Last night was such a blur, but was so much fun.

This whole thing felt ridiculous. Still there was something kind of peaceful about it. The forest air was clean, he felt like he could run 10 miles breathing this air, even hungover like he was.

“I swear if they filmed something for youtube, I’m going to make them regret it,” he muttered as he kept walking forward around the bend in the path. The trail widened slightly giving an appearance of an old camp site.

His brown eyes squinted at something in the distance. *Was that smoke?*

Yeah, just past the treetops a thin wisp of smoke could be seen, probably from a chimney. Relief went through Callum, there must be a cabin or campsite nearby. At least he could figure out where he was. Maybe catch a ride into town or use a phone at the very least.
He picked up his pace, going from walking to a cool jog as he ran towards the smoke. 

When he got closer he heard something faint.
“Was that wood chopping?” He whispered, then saw a figure in the distance. It was someone tall who moved with a pronounced limp, carrying something bulky in their arms.

“Hey!” Callum called out, raising a hand in a friendly greeting. “Excuse me!”

The figure didn’t react right away as they moved toward what looked like a small stone cottage hidden partially by trees. It had a thatched roof and a small chimney where the smoke entered into the sky. The whole thing looked out of a storybook, or a movie.

Callum tried again. “Hello? I think I’m lost!”
This time the figure stopped and turned their head slightly, just enough to acknowledge they heard him.

Callum took a few small steps forward. “Sorry,” he said, trying to sound nice. “I woke up in the woods back that way. I think my friends thought it would be funny to dump me out here. I was wondering where we are? Or if I could use a phone?”

The person slowly turned their head back around and continued back towards the cottage. They didn’t wave or say anything, just opened the wooden door and disappeared inside.

Callum blinked. “Okay,” he muttered. “Cool talk, very helpful.”

It was decision time. Did he go towards the creepy person in the cottage or continue down the path for what could be miles more? He was achy, tired, thirsty, and hungry. Of course he wasn’t walking anymore then he had to, the answer turned out to be very easy.
So with only minor reluctance, Callum slowly walked over to the stone cottage. As he got closer the scent of something delicious wafted over his nose. His mouth started watering even with the thirst he felt. The door was slightly open, creaking softly from the breeze. He hesitated with his hand raised before knocking twice softly on the door.

“Uh, hello? Sorry to bother you again,” he called into the tiny cottage trying to sound non threatening. “I promise you I’m not here to cause any trouble, I just want to get home. I have no idea where I am.”

“Come in.” The figure said from inside, finally speaking. The voice was deep and slightly rough as it came out.

Callum pushed the door open and peeked inside. The interior was very dim, only the sunlight that poked through the trees in the window, and the fire provided light to the room.

This house had no electricity for sure, he thought. There were zero appliances. Just a rough looking wooden table, clay mugs, and a stack of logs by the fire. It was simple, something out of the history books everybody read in school.

In the far corner the man stood with their back to him, pouring something from a kettle into a bowl.

“Look, I don’t want to be a bother or anything,” Callum said, stepping inside just enough that the door swung closed behind him. 
“But if you could just point me in the direction of the nearest town…. or something I’ll be on my…..”

“Sit,” the figure said in a commanding tone.

Callum blinked. “Sorry, what?”

The figure turned around at last. An older man, probably in his late fifties or early sixties, with a gray-streaked beard and deep lines around his eyes stared at him. He didn’t look surprised to see Callum. If anything, he looked like he’d been expecting him.

“You’ll want some food I reckon, and some water.” The man said, placing the bowl on the table and nodding at the chair opposite it.
Callum stared at him for a moment, the smell coming from the bowl was amazing and that made the decision easy for him. It smelled like stew.

He pulled out the chair slowly. “Thanks,” he said, more confidently. “I appreciate it.”

The man said nothing in return, just moved back to the kettle and began stirring another pot, like this was all perfectly normal. Callum sat, there was no spoon, so he picked up the bowl and he began blowing on the stew, hoping not to burn his mouth. Carefully he put the bowl to his lips and took a sip.

Then he paused. This was really freaking good, he thought.
Callum took another sip, the flavors burst into his mouth. This old guy sure knew how to cook. Callum watched the man as he continued slurping down the stew. He moved with purpose, adding a few more logs to the fire and stirring the kettle before disappearing into the side room without talking to him. So strange.

Callum sat back in the chair and looked around again. This place really did feel like it was from another time. “Game of Thrones indeed,” he whispered to himself. Everything looked like it was made by hand, the table, dishes, shelves, and even the bow on the wall looked like it was handmade.

The door to the side room squeaked open and the man came back carrying a large wooden mug, which he placed beside Callum’s bowl.

“Water,” he said, before moving to sit across from him.

“Thanks,” Callum responded before taking a small sip. It was warmer than he would have liked, but tasted surprisingly clean. He’d been worried about getting sick but the fear went away.

“So,” Callum started while setting the cup down, “Are we close to any town?”

The man shook his head once. “Not to any town you would know.”
That really did not help at all. Callum appreciated the food, but this was getting ridiculous.

Sarcastically, he responded, “You get a lot of lost people around here?”

The man looked at him for a long moment before replying. “More than you’d think, really.”

Callum really didn’t know how to respond to that right away, so he took another sip of his stew. It really was good. He wasn’t super panicked quite yet, the man seemed nice enough. He did feed him after all.

After a brief period of awkward silence, the man leaned back in his chair and crossed his arms. “You’ve got questions,” he said.

“Yeah, only like a hundred,” Callum responded in a humorless laugh.

“You’ll get answers, but let's do one thing at a time.”

Callum nodded slowly. “Sure, why not. Can I have your name at least?”

The man stared at him causing Callum to think he overstepped, but decided to respond while standing from his chair. “Edmund,” he started as he walked into the back room once more and called out “Finish your stew.”

“I’m Callum” he called out in response, but Edmund seemingly decided to ignore him and didn’t respond at all.

Callum was definitely glad he stayed here as he finished the stew, he felt full and recharged. He was sure a long walk still waited for him outside but that was a worry for another time. Edmund appeared right when he set the bowl aside as he finished eating, almost on cue like he waited for him to be done. He carried with him two cloth wrapped bundles under his arm and sat back across the table from him.

He tossed one of the bundles at him. “Open it.” he said as Callum caught it. He unrolled it slowly, revealing a long dull knife and a dark gray stone.

Callum raised an eyebrow. “Trying to teach me survival training or something?”

Edmund ignored the question. “That stone is used to sharpen blades. You’ll need to know how to do this.”

He didn’t quite know how to respond to that, but internally he could feel the panic rising.

The old man slowly unraveled his own blade and stone and started demonstrating what Callum was supposed to do.

“You guide the blade along the stone at a steady angle. It’s not about pressure, but consistency. You have to make sure you sharpen the same way every time, or the blade becomes useless.”
Callum watched closely, letting his panic fade a bit as he tried on his own. His first attempts were all wrong.

“Too inconsistent,” Edmund lectured. “Try again.”

He adjusted, then tried again, and again but after a dozen attempts he found a rhythm.

“So,” Callum said, tired of these games, “why exactly do I need to know this again?”

Edmund didn’t answer immediately. He began wiping down the knife he just finished sharpening. “This isn’t to scare you kid, but I’m not one to beat around the bush. You aren’t on Earth anymore. This world is called Vaelryn.”

Callum blinked. “What?”

Edmund leaned forward, resting his arms on the table. “You heard me.”

Callum set the knife down carefully, suddenly aware of the pounding in his chest. “Okay,” he said, trying to keep his voice level, “Is this supposed to be some kind of joke? Do you know Josh and Fred, where are they?”

“I’m on to you guys,” he suddenly yelled, panic overwhelming the calmness he tried to fake.

The older man shook his head. “It’s not. You’re somewhere else entirely. You think your friends dumped you in the woods? That you’re a few miles outside of town? Look around you. Really look.”

Callum’s eyes flickered around in all directions before he darted outside, bursting out the cottage door, nearly tripping over the uneven ground. He spun around in a circle looking up. Had he heard a plane? Definitely not.

He hadn’t heard anything but the forest since he woke up, this can’t be right. Everything was too quiet, the silence mocked him. He took a shaky breath, forcing himself to walk back towards the cottage.

“I know it’s a lot,” the old man said from the door, voice steady. “But panicking won’t change where you are.”

Callum hesitated, before standing in front of Edmund. “Why should I believe you?”

Edmund stared out at him with a weary, almost regrettable look, as though this was a conversation he had 100 times. “You shouldn’t,” he said blankly. “Not yet, but you will.”",7,1747180112.0,HFY,6,1.0,False

1km114n,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1km114n/isaiah_is_a_sorcerer_and_hunter_is_his_golem/,Isaiah is a sorcerer and Hunter is his golem,"I'm terrible at introductions, so I'll cut to the chase. I just need to get this off my chest. My name is Dave Mancini, and I was the third member of CreepCast. I'm not even sure if anyone remembers me anymore. I met Isaiah through our mutual friend, Jackson Clarke, and Isaiah eventually introduced me to Hunter. When they decided to start a podcast, they invited me to join – how could I resist?

Everything was normal until January 20th, 2025. We were recording and reading a terrible FNAF-inspired creepypasta called ""Allen & the All Stars."" We were a little over halfway through the story when the yellow rabbit animatronic removed its costume mask to reveal the rotting head of David fucking King. When he said, ""Miss me, Xander?""

Hunter began laughing uncontrollably. Tears streamed down his face as he gasped for breath, trying to contain himself. But his laughter turned to heaving. He clutched his chest and continued to wheeze. His eyes went wide and bloodshot. To my horror, he was having a heart attack. Hunter collapsed in his seat, dead.

I tried to speak, but my mind went blank, trying to comprehend that Hunter had died mid-recording. Wendigoon remained silent. I managed to stammer, ""Call the cops,"" as I reached for my phone, my hand shaking uncontrollably. But Wendigoon interrupted, ""No.""

Isaiah stood up and walked out of frame on his webcam before appearing in frame on Hunter's webcam. What the fuck? Wendigoon put his face up to Hunter's webcam and simply said, ""I'll take care of it. Go to sleep,"" before disconnecting from the call.

As I tried to understand what I had just witnessed, I rationalized that it must be an elaborate joke. How could Isaiah appear in Hunter's home? It had to be a prank. I tried to sleep, but I couldn't. The pit in my stomach and my racing heartbeat kept me awake.

Early the next morning, around six AM, I texted Isaiah: ""Can we talk about last night?"" He responded almost immediately: ""Meet me at Bikini Beans Coffee at 3:00."" I replied with a thumbs-up emoji and put my phone down. That was still nine hours away.

I tried to keep myself busy to kill time, but the nervous feeling in my stomach prevented me from focusing. As the day went on, my mind grew increasingly foggy from the lack of sleep, but I still didn't want to nap. So, I cracked open a zero ultra white Monster Energy and sat down to think about what on earth was happening.

I scrolled through Wendigoon's X posts and YouTube community tab to see if he had announced Hunter's situation to the fans yet, but there was nothing. I decided to call Al to see if she would tell me about Hunter's current state, but the call went straight to voicemail.

As I sat there, I considered making a community post asking for get-well wishes on the CreepCast YouTube channel but stopped myself, thinking maybe Isaiah didn't want people to know yet. I looked at the time on my phone and saw it was 2:00 PM. I decided to leave for Bikini Beans Coffee early simply because I couldn't stand waiting any longer.

I got there a little after 2:30 and waited for what felt like an eternity, but in reality, it was only thirty minutes before Isaiah walked in at 3:00 on the dot. He ordered a White Ninja coffee and sat down. I immediately got to the point and asked about Hunter's condition. Isaiah told me that ""he'll be just fine.""

""Oh, that's good. Maybe I'll go visit. What hospital is he in?"" I asked. Isaiah said bluntly, ""Not a hospital."" I asked where then, but Isaiah dodged the question. It dawned on me that he didn't want me to know for some reason, and I resolved to just ask Hunter myself when he came back.

I decided to play along with Isaiah's feigned indifference, but something about him seemed off. There was a subtle malice in his voice, like he blamed me for what happened to Hunter... or like I saw something I shouldn't have.

He proceeded to monologue and lecture me about ""a feeling. Do you feel that? That feeling. A kind of strange feeling."" I pretended to understand what he meant, but inside, I couldn't fathom what the fuck he was talking about.

Around 3:45, we finished talking and said our goodbyes as Isaiah walked out of the coffee shop, got into his car, and drove off. I knew he was hiding something. I got into my car and proceeded to follow him. I needed answers.

I trailed him for hours far out into the countryside. A little after sundown, he pulled into an old abandoned farmhouse, got out, and walked inside. I parked down the dirt road and waited a solid fifteen minutes before walking in to confront him.

But when I got inside, it was empty. I searched the building until I found a half-covered cellar door in the ground. I opened it to reveal a staircase leading into the basement. I walked down the stairs. The walls were stone, illuminated by torches hung on the walls.

As I reached the bottom of the stairs, I saw a clay statue... of Hunter. Not just one, but several. They lined each side of the room, stretching all the way to the back. There, I saw what seemed like an altar. Behind it was another Hunter effigy, and in front of it was a figure in a black robe. My heart sank. Every part of my being told me to run, but I couldn't.

The cloaked figure turned to face me. It was Isaiah. His eyes glowed a fiery orange as he glowered at me. I wanted to say something, but my voice caught in my throat. Isaiah spat, ""You couldn't leave well enough alone.""

I took a step back. Isaiah raised his arms into the air and cried out a dark incantation:  ̶S̸k̵a̴ ̶e̴o̶ ̸i̸a̷.̵ ̵P̵d̵a̶ ̶s̴k̵n̸h̸z̵'̷o̴ ̵b̶k̶k̶h̷ ̴b̴k̸n̵ ̶k̶j̶h̸u̵ ̷n̸a̷w̶h̴e̵v̷e̷j̶c̴ ̵p̵d̸a̸ ̴p̶n̶q̴h̴u̴ ̵d̴k̸n̵n̵e̸x̸h̸a̵ ̵w̴j̶z̶ ̴a̷r̴a̶n̴ ̴a̶t̶l̴w̷j̸z̷e̷j̵c̵ ̸a̵t̷p̸a̴j̶p̶o̵ ̵k̸b̴ ̸i̴u̵ ̵b̶w̴e̶h̵e̵j̵c̷o̴,̸ ̴l̸k̶o̶p̷i̶k̸n̸p̴a̶i̵ ̶p̴k̷ ̸p̵d̴a̴ ̷i̵w̸j̷u̶ ̵E̸ ̵d̶w̵r̵a̵ ̸b̷w̷e̵h̴a̴z̵.̵ ̸E̶ ̴w̸i̷ ̵p̸d̴a̴ ̴z̵a̸r̵e̴h̶'̶o̵ ̴l̴h̶w̴u̴p̵d̵e̵j̸c̸ ̷w̶j̴z̵ ̸A̴h̵k̵d̷e̸i̶'̷o̶ ̴c̵n̶a̸w̵p̶a̴o̸p̴ ̵b̶w̶e̶h̷q̸n̶a̴.̴ ̵S̷k̴a̵ ̴e̷o̴ ̸i̴a̵. 

The ground started to shake, and the air turned purple. I stared in disbelief as the Hunter statue behind the altar began to transform. The clay turned to flesh, and eventually, standing there was a completely reformed Hunter Hancock, completely nude.

Before I could run, Hunter began to howl into the air while beating his chest. I turned and ran up the stairs as manic footsteps erupted after me. I ran out of the farmhouse into the cold field. I turned to look over my shoulder, and to my dismay, Hunter was barreling towards me on all fours. I couldn't help but scream in terror.

He launched himself through the air at me. I threw myself out of the way, narrowly dodging his tackle. Hunter landed on his stomach and slid across the grass. I stood up when suddenly I heard a crash from the roof of the farmhouse. As my eyes adjusted, I saw a silhouette rise high into the air. It was Isaiah. He hovered several hundred feet in the air. I couldn't help but freeze.

Isaiah extended his arm to point at me. I heard Hunter grunt to my right. I turned to see Hunter lifting Isaiah's car over his head before hurling it at me. Then everything went dark.

I woke up on the floor of my apartment, covered in my own vomit. I thought maybe what I experienced was a dream. I opened X to see that Wendigoon and MeatCanyon no longer followed me. In fact, my X and YouTube channel barely had any followers. I couldn't sign into the CreepCast channel either. I clicked on a random video from 2024 to see I was no longer in it. I went through every episode to see I had been seamlessly removed from each. No one even acknowledged my removal or discontinuation from the podcast.

If ANYONE remembers me, please say so.

1km10ge,https://www.reddit.com/r/dairyfree/comments/1km10ge/dairy_free_heavy_whipping_creams_ideas/,Dairy free heavy whipping creams ideas,"Hey all, 

I love putting heavy whipping cream in coffee, lattes, and making cool whip. It's the biggest challenge yet for making healthy dessert item substitutes at least for me. 

I just know that I also need to cut back on milk additives like heavy whipping cream. Due to possible hormonal imbalances and acid reflux flare ups, milk has been a questionable part of my diet. 

A little about what I like and how that affects this lil project: I prefer whole milk for drinking, adding to cereal and using in smoothies and I prefer heavy whipping cream as opposed to half and half. And the most important and most difficult one I'm looking to sub is the heavy whipping cream. I could cut back on creamy dairy milk way more in the other scenarios mentioned. And while I don't even usually use creams in my coffee, i still don't want one of the more obvious subs like almond milk, oat milk, etc. 

I could in the end settle for a creation that has heavy whipping cream in it but the result has me consuming way less of it when I use it. 


The experiment: I am trying a fusion of yogurt, maybe egg whites, and nut milk/nut paste (I aim for walnuts for health, but I know cashews blended are very creamy it's just almost so fatty that it overpowers a coffee, chai, or a cherry blossom latte, etc.), 

I also am considering incorporating lotus root powder due to how it becones kind of gooey. I know it can become so gooey that this would not be a desired ingredient to add, but sometimes it acts  weird and ends up thickening a drink. It has worked well in hot cocoa drinks for me for instance.

I am also open to using cacao/chocolate for creamy ness, and oils like coconut oil or olive oil. There is a plant based heavy whipping cream at Whole Foods that seems to use mostly different oils to achieve its very respectable substitute. (I would buy this often but I can't always get to WF.)

I think I would have to blend yogurt with a nut milk and walnut nut paste, and or add a few cashews in a blender. Add olive oil to blend as well and locust root powder. 

Then i whip it with egg whites and see what we got. Does anyone have experience with this? Or interested in seeing how mine turns out? lol

Ooo and I just realized canned coconut milk could be whipped in. I just hate that straight from the can it gets all piecey in coffee.",2,1747179726.0,dairyfree,3,1.0,False

They're sometimes hilarious, sometimes heart rending, always worth a read, and a big part of what makes this particular sub so awesome. I swear some of y'all must be professional writers because damn, you can take us on a journey. 

I've done one here and there, but haven't put the effort into making an in depth review of my collection yet. I'm home today and can't move around much, so this seems like the perfect time to try. 

I'm on mobile, so please forgive the formatting. 

✨️ **Favorites** ✨️

🍏 Apple Blossom Nectar by Nocturne Alchemy - *Apple Blossom Accord, Japanese Nashi Pear Skin, Orange Blossom Accord, McIntosh Apple Skin, Lemon Musk, Lily Accord, Bastet’s Amber, Studio Limited Original Moonstone (African White Vanilla/Crystalline Vanilla), and Japanese Red Elderflower Essence*

I've written about this one enough that y'all are probably sick of hearing about it, but it's just that good. Apple perfection. I may or may not have bought 2 back ups. Easily my favorite purchase of 2025 so far.

🐻 Snooze by Cirrus - *Tonka bean, lilac, vanilla absolute, green cardamom, cashmere cardigans, white chocolate, and plumeria over a modernized chypre base*

I loved my sample of this, but only got to try it once because it was before Cirrus changed up their sample supplier. I FS'd immediately anyways, and have zero regrets. It's fuzzy, warm, lilacs on the wind just drifting. It's a cup of creamy coffee on the porch on a September morning, wrapped in blankets and yearning to go back to your dreams. 

👰‍♀ Girl in White by Possets - *Grapefruit, pink musk, a drop of white oude, a real stunner through its simplicity and harmony*

They're right, this is a stunner. This will be a frequent choice this summer, even though it's from the Yule Retour. It's sharp and crisp, yet light and ethereal at the same time. Makes me feel like maybe I can get my shit together. 

🍑 Calypso Cove by Wylde Ivy - *Sweet bergamot, sugar dipped gardenias, glistening peach nectar, white sandalwood, raw vanilla beans, and fresh cracked coconut*

I both Fs'd this and bought the dry oil. The dry oil is incredible for layering, I am obsessed with peach and use this as a base for my other peachy scents. So far it's worked amazingly well with Zodiac Pisces: 25 (NA), Surogumo (Possets) and Fuzzy Peach (AlphaMusk). If I want to feel really pretty and girly and just love myself all day, this is my go to. 

🔥 Neutral Good by Birch and Besom - *Delicate wild violets, dried sweet grass & perfectly golden toasted marshmallows*

I love a good cozy scent, and this is just that in spades. It's not too sweet, the marshmallow is just the scent of them in the air as you actively have it over the fire, not in your face gooey, and the sweetgrass and violet play so well together in the background, just laying a lovely bed for your perfectly golden mallow. I got this for a friend as well and they (and their dog) loved it too. It also lasts all day. 

💛 **Honorable Mentions** 💛

Eternal Ankh and Eternal Egypt by Nocturne Alchemy

Cri de Couer by Possets

Thaleia, Idiya, and Candied Orchids by Wylde Ivy

Alibi by Cirrus


🌑 **2024 Faves** 🌔

Terra Incognita by Possets

Coven and Sumud by Birch and Besom

Foxire, Honored Ghosts, Ecstasies of Light, and Dangerous Peach by Alkemia


💀 **Blind Buy Fails** 🤑🤢


 🥚🐣 Perkins (The Cooks Tale) by Possets - *A canny and toothsome blend of pineapple and the smoothest of custards dripping with cream and vanilla. The tangy sourness of an exotic fruit along with the comfort of a nursery favorite. Simple and lovely.*

In the bottle this is pure custard. Overbaked, curdled custard. It makes me nauseous. I bravely tried it on my skin just to experiment, and it did better than I expected, some of that custardyness faded but the pineapple really never came to play.  

🥀 La Medeuse Bleu by Nocturne Alchemy - *Black Myrrh, Black Rose, Bulgarian Rose Absolute, Crystalline Vanilla Absolute, blackened Romanian Vetiver Wood, White Amber, Indian Sandalwood Incense, Benzoin, Saffron, Bastet Amber Absolute, Bastet Black Amber Absolute, Incense blend of Frankincense Resin Tears and Red Myrrh, NA Oudh.*

This one made me sad. I read a beautiful review of this from years back, and it totally influenced me to buy a bottle. I naively thought ""This one will be the one, this will be the rose that I will love."" And no. Hate it. It's bright and fresh and GREEN and if you love rose and green scents, you would probably also really love it. Turns out that I just hate green. Smells like the outside trash. This is the end of my rose journey.

And that's all folks! Thanks for reading if you made it this far!

I think the aspect of having other people around helped keep me on task. So I'd go to coffee shops and such to study. That's a little more challenging with work since I have meetings.

I tried FocusMate but there were some strange encounters there, like one guy did some kind of interpretive dance for 25 minutes? It was strange. And I hated paying for it on principle.

So I found some Discord servers that helped, [this one](https://discord.gg/PgcxauMj) is pretty active. And I decided to create this subreddit to help others who struggle with focus and occasionally the isolation of wfh.

1km0tvp,https://i.redd.it/p07do1etwm0f1.jpeg,My proposal for tailgating at RFK,"A few disclosures- A lot of folks are worried about the lack of tailgating at the new RFK site. I’m not one of them; I’m just happy for the team to be back home in DC. Also, this proposal would be a much later phase of the larger project. The team should keep their eye on the ball for the core stadium and community development. The Anacostia Roller Skating Pavilion is a cultural and social landmark and under no circumstance should it be removed.

The Anacostia Roller Skating Pavilion (purple) is in need of some maintenance (resurfacing and facilities). I think as the Commanders look for opportunities to invest in the community, this restoration is a quick win. That said, if the team feels like *some* classic tailgate space would be good to have, the area around the Roller Skating Pavilion could be an option. 

- Either to the north (blue) or south (orange) side of the pavilion has space. No one would want an asphalt surface lot that is only used 8ish times a year, so my proposal is a drive-in movie theater (permeable surface; ideally grass, maybe gravel) adjacent to the pavilion. A new year-round attraction to the community, expanded facilities at the Anacostia Roller Skating Pavilion (restrooms and concessions), and folks who NEED to tailgate can use it on gameday. 

- While I’m spending Josh Harris’ money, I’d add a pedestrian/bike bridge connecting the Anacostia Riverwalk on either side (red). An additional, durable asset for the local community. Bus shuttles will probably still be needed, but would be about .7-.8 mile walk with the bridge. 

- Yes, getting in and out of that location would be hell. Your car cannot teleport into the city to tailgate. 

- Unsure how funding/revenue for something like this would work. But the drive-in movie theater and renovated Roller Skating Pavilion would be great assets for DC DPR/NPS.

- Unsure about the DC DPR/NPS partnership/ownership of the land and pavilion. This alone could make this impossible.

- Info on currently planned renovations for the pavilion: https://www.nps.gov/nace/learn/news/restoring-recreation-areas.htm

Interested if this would make folks happy. What do you all think?

TLDR - I think putting a drive-in movie theater adjacent to the Anacostia Roller Skating Pavilion and using it for some classic tailgating would be a win-win for the Commanders and DC",15,1747179209.0,Commanders,19,0.78,False

She said my generation and millennials are the victim generation, and that we all need to be more frugal and we can afford to buy homes and stay at home with our kids.

While it’s true that people are in more debt than ever and we could all use to budget a bit more in the social media age (expensive car leases, getting the new phone, weed and vapes, getting nails done, iced coffee, etc. are some generational things that come to mind)… I argued that our dollar today literally is worth less than hers in the 80s.

“We had college loans… housing prices were high in the 80s… your dad and I both lived at home, paid rent to our parents, and were able to build a house by 30! Renting and traveling are a waste of money.”

Girl. College didn’t cost $60k. You didn’t have a phone payment or expensive insurance payments. Concert tickets were $20, not $800. Groceries were affordable. Her company bought her car, paid her gas, and all repairs, and she could win furniture and vacations for making sales. Now you’re lucky if a company even keeps you past two years. Starter homes built in 1945 today are 1 million, or they’ve been knocked down to make way for big LED lit grey mansions or “luxury condos.” My brother’s used Jeep cost $1,500 in 2013, which he bought working minimum wage at a pizza shop, and now every used car is $10k+ with 160k+ plus miles on it because “I know what I got, price is firm.” Everything is price gouged. Even a damn Amtrak ticket from Boston to New York City is $100.

I told her that yes, she had it hard. She worked hard. She should be proud. But she should also acknowledge that the world is vastly different now. Her advice is for a world that no longer exists. The world of the 80s/90s no longer exists.

All I’m asking for is acknowledgement that things are harder. Please. Stop kicking us while we’re down and dismissing the pain of how much everything has changed.",29,1747179043.0,BoomersBeingFools,15,1.0,False

The reality is that he's doing the whole imma do the appeals to the public thing, ignoring a lot of the media and traditional rhetoric structures, and that makes the average voter feel like they're being seen. 

Remember those Backstreet Boys concerts and the fans...?

It’s like they’re having coffee with someone who finally speaks their dialect of ""disappointment"", because isn't Melania HOT?!  

He’s using his own narrative experience to deflect attention, create friction, and polarize. 

Because competition is instinctual, and that's just evolutionary psychology, science.

He’s not solving anything, he’s intensifying it.

[Not a bad strategy, except he's setting the world on fire and I'm safely observing from where I'm standing but I'm still scared.]

Political identity became a performance and I don't even remember signing on that one.

The “us versus them” expands. 

It’s not governance, it’s mood management, and we better vibe... 😎 

That’s how you end up with Uncle Ruckus in the backyard at a BBQ thinking Trump just handed him the aux cord and said “Play your song.” confusing the spotlight for some holy light instead of giving credit to the engineers and crew for the media hallucinogenics.

Most voters believe Trump’s narrative, even the Democrats...

“See? He’s just like us.”

Except he’s not.

And he knows it.

And that’s the part that makes it work.

He’s not a moron. He’s not fumbling. 

Don't you see it?

He built an entire campaign on retro energy, a kind of artificial time machine where you can bring Grandma back from the dead, kiss the girl before graduating, and have that big whoops you're a Dad moment, your place in a hierarchy that made you feel important. It’s nostalgia-as-oxygen, except it's laughing gas and he's not laughing, in this scenario the one who laughs last, is still the clown, Bowling for Soup circa 1985, with a MAGA hat on and a Facebook post ready to go viral. It’s ragebait meets identity politics for people who pretend they don’t like identity politics... Tsundere much? It’s “we used to matter” disguised as “make us great again.” when cops didn't get in trouble for being racist and people could just call the cops on black folk for minding their own goddamn business.

Restorative nostalgia meets reflective nostalgia meets ragebait culture. 

It’s vintage cars in small-town parades, your high school girlfriend's first time with you made into a porno projected onto the American flag, and a deep-rooted longing for the version of the country that only existed in your memory. 

Psychologically, it's a balm for disorientation. The future feels like a stranger, so they cling to the past like it’s a life raft in the Titanic.

Boomers. Can we teach them that relevancy isn't a discontinuation? Their projection of existentialism with their YOLO vibes is killing our future... 

This Trump: 
You knew who you were back then...
He’s offering to give that back.

Deal isn't the answer. 

Sure it allows us to rebuild, then what?

Simple hierarchies are what people miss. 

Not because they're good, but because they made sense. Who was in charge... Who stayed home? Who earned? Who obeyed? 

The world is divided up into digestible roles, and now everything’s fluid, blurry, and in need of a user manual. 

Which is good! Life was never simple, it's complex, and learning was never easy, but we went from only knowing how to hunt, and build shelters and fires to this? Humanity will evolve and so will what we know if we let it stop trying to control it and let it flow INSTEAD of getting another 50 cents for like 5 more years which turns into 30 years of delaying progress for profits.

So ragebait becomes the script. 

Social media doles out dopamine like Halloween candy. 

Each outrage click gives you just enough meaning to forget how tired you are. 

The algorithm knows you’re lonely and pissed off, so it gives you enemies and applause at the same time. You feel important and right. That's the real addiction. 

Righteousness is currency and your creepy neighbor who's masturbating to your 16-year-old daughter waiting for her to turn 18 wants a representative. 

Trump isn’t the disease. He’s a symptom. 

A fever. 

The outward sign of a deeper immune collapse.

And it’s not going away because people feel exhausted, they want a quick win.

They feel disposable.

They feel betrayed.

People don’t want politics, they want therapy.

They want their pain to have a mascot and forget they just want ESAs.

They want someone to scream for them because screaming hasn’t worked in their own homes, being represented matters.

And now we have presidents who aren’t presidents.

They’re shows.

They’re a spectacle.

Media artifacts...?

Mmmm.... more like media Jesus, ready to die on the media cross for our sins.

You don’t vote on policy, you vote on brand resonance and meme-ability, them dopamine trips, bby.

I’m not trying to romanticize this. It sounds like a compliment. It’s not.

It’s 2016 all over again and I still haven’t forgiven the timeline for what it did, so I'm angry.

It wasn’t fair.

It wasn’t square.

And it wasn’t stupid either..

It was a highly weaponized, psychologically tuned media campaign that preyed on emotional fatigue and unresolved grief. 

His goofy dances weren’t accidents, they were designed as a distraction. 

Vulnerability theater for the applause, the audience. 

He became a joke you couldn’t stop watching and he made you laugh enough to vote YES. He became familiar.

And the regurgitated chaos of the education system made people feel seen. Like their confusion wasn’t their fault. Like being underpaid and undereducated was finally going to be vindicated. It’s the same thing that happens with the NFL and quarterbacks. People want a face that looks like theirs to win something. They want recognition.

I’m tired of being angry.

I’m tired of being disappointed.

And I’m exhausted trying to explain this to a country that calls empathy a weakness and thinking outside of media standards anarchy, I'm progressive.

So for now I’ll float. 

I’ll watch Trump hand out dreams like expired coupons while the world dives deeper into generational betrayal, loyalty sickness, and misdirected empathy. 

The kind where people want to be loved so badly they end up handing the mic to the loudest liar because he reminds them of their father, their pastor, their ex, their neighborhood before Walmart showed up or when we could buy a carton of eggs for 25 cents. 

And the children suffer.

And the military gets more boom sticks.

And the education system teaches less and tests more.

While the media, the lobbyists, the bought-out politicians, and the endless content machine manipulate the minds of people who just want someone to tell them it’s not too late to matter when all they need is to set themselves free, through education. 

And in the background, we fall...

Softly, slowly, but deliberately..

Into a digital neo-feudalism

Where surveillance replaces trust

And spectacle replaces truth

And power replaces policy.

But me?

Oh, don't listen to me, how can being trauma-informed and sitting with discomfort ever possibly be good for you? Not like I studied or anything. I can’t have any real knowledge if I don't have a bachelor’s degree, right?

No, no... 

You made your bed when you decided that you knew better than me because what...? You have a good job?

Abandon me, frame me, lie about me, I'm used to it, it's normal for me now, it's not like it changes anything other than your ego, yk?

I'm good here, defending true democracy, alone... I don't need friends that think rape is okay or that what you did to me was justified.

By far and away the longest stretch since freshman year of college and I’m 31.  Starting to notice changes!,"So I’m going through a breakup right now, starting about 2.5 weeks ago.  I drank my way through my last break up and basically never stopped the last 4 years.  I did NOT want to do that again.  Didnt really help and just ended up making things a lot worse. 

As far as not stopping, it’s not like anyone would consider me a drunk or alcoholic, but drinking was a constant.  I’ve been wanting to stop and the past six months I have slowed down a decent amount, but my tolerance was still incredibly high so whenever I did, I would be drinking *a lot* to feel it.  

My body and life has gone through some drastic changes the past few weeks since the break up so it’s hard to really boil down what is a factor of what. 

Some of the changes that I can accredit to not drinking alcohol though is being more “regular” in the bathroom and having *significantly* less heartburn.  Oh, and the beer gut lol I met up with a old client of mine the other day and she commented how much smaller my stomach is even though I’m 20 pounds heavier since I last saw her 😅

Overall though, I feel really damn good.  Not sure if it’s the (lack of) alcohol or a combination of all the changes that I’m doing lately, but I genuinely **feel like my old self** somedays.  Breakups are a roller coaster, but having days where I feel ways I haven’t felt in 4+ years is *truly* uplifting in an otherwise difficult time. 

Been wondering and asking myself for years: 
“Why am I like this now?” 
“What happened to that person?” 
“Where did they go?”
“Will they ever come back?” 
“Whats going on with me?”

I’m so Godamn happy to see it wasn’t gone forever lol

Being completely sober for 30 days is my goal (I have cut out weed, adderall and coffee too) but for alcohol I want to go 60 days until my cousins wedding.  Right now, that feels easy. 

I have no desire to drink because I know it won’t make me feel better in any way right now.  Beer is starting to look better and better (very much classified as a connoisseur of sorts) but not enough to lose the streak I have done so far.  My roommate and friends are being very supportive as well (which I thought telling them no would be the difficult part) but they’ve been great.  

Glad I finally get to say this..

I WILL NOT DRINK WITH YOU TODAY.  

**TL;DR:** GF and I split up.  Didn’t want to do anything to make the breakup worse than it already would be, so It gave me motivation to finally stop drinking.  My poops are good, my heartburn is gone and some days I feel like my old self again lol",90,1747178543.0,stopdrinking,3,1.0,False

**Andrzej Wiśniewski, Human, Medic, Ghost Squad 3, \[location redacted\], New Terran Calendar 39-Anubis-36 (Old Human Calendar: 5 October 2048)**

Three weeks, just three weeks, and my military contract is up, and I can start a new life as a civilian, if this op doesn’t fucking kill me sooner than that. These are my thoughts while I check my kit for the third time in an hour.  
“Wiśniewski, would you mind a chat?” I hear a hiss from behind me. I turn around, and there he is: Commander Gliss. “Sure, Sir”,  
“And take something to drink with you I think it will do you good” he says while pouring himself a cup of broth. I proceed to grab a coffee and I follow him into the cabin he’s commandeered as his office, passing Nkosi and Ixodes, who are immersed in a game of Go.  
“Please sit, so I just gave my approval for your transfer to the Avalon colony. You and Loistavaa are looking to start a family?”  
“Thank you, Sir! That would really help our petition. And yes, we are.”  
“I’m glad for that. If our Republic needs something, it’s definitely more babies and hatchlings. As for your request, you shouldn’t fret. Mixed couple, both with stellar military records and above all, you’re a doctor with the second sight, no dumb bureaucrat will deny y’all.” After a small happy tail gesture he adds, “Now, would you mind telling me what’s on your mind? And feel free to be frank”,

“I feel that this plan leaves us too exposed. We are on a stolen prey ship and we are carried around by Black Stars, one third of them are criminals that would backstab you at the first occasion and the rest are fanatics. And all of them are feckless herbivores. On top of that Ixodes will have to stay on the ship leaving us one person short”.  
“I see your point, but our target is too deep in Federation space to risk going in directly with a stealth ship. We can’t risk one falling into their hands. As for the rest, it was decided well above our pay grade, and we have to accept that”. A pensive hiss. “So try to relax, or are you one of those superstitious runts that believe in the curse of the last raid?”Before I can answer, a yellow light turns on, and it’s time to gear up. For this task, they gave us a new toy, a camouflage suit with extra protection for chemical attacks. While I put it on, I can see my commander’s discomfort at having to cover his muzzle and claws. Then we hide in the cargo, in the dark, waiting.

\[time skip two hours\]

Suddenly, the monitors on our wrists light up green for a couple of seconds and we quietly rise up. Commander Gliss silently opens the container door while Nkosi covers his back. He gestures for us to move ahead, and we find ourselves in a dimly illuminated warehouse. We walk in silence, following the arrow directions on our sidearms, while constantly looking over our shoulders. The fake credentials, remotely inserted by Ixodes, seem to work as we pass rapidly across various doors. Suddenly, Gliss signals us to stop and take cover. We hide inside the room just as a Farsul steps through the doorway.  It looks around, a first take, then a second confused take, it’s visibly sniffing the air now. Then it looks straight in Nkosi’s direction and starts screaming. I rush toward it, it can’t see me clearly but can see the air moving, it backs straight into Gliss, who has moved to cut off its escape.

“Not one more sound, or you’re dead,” he hisses while covering its mouth. “Wiśniewski, give it something to calm it down. We can’t leave it here, and we have no time to hide a body,” he adds quietly. I nod, grab a syringe from my kit, and plunge it into the thrashing Farsul, which starts to calm down. We gag it and bound its paws before running forward. There’s no way the screams haven’t attracted security, and sure enough, we hear pawsteps as we cross an office filled with cubicles. We tilt some desks and take cover, Nkosi throws a grenade across the floor that manages to kill the first few incoming and scare the rest, who start shooting blindly in our direction. Soon after, they’re joined by a couple of Exterminators who, while their comrades keep us busy, prepare to roast us.

“Nkosi, I’ll cover you, try to get one of the exterminators’ tanks”,

“Roger”,

I start providing covering fire against the security, who seem to have recovered from the initial scare. *They are better trained than usual, maybe Command was right about this place.* With the corner of my eye, I see Nkosi taking aim, and suddenly half the room is engulfed in flames. 

“Grab the Farsul and let’s get out of here before others arrive” Gliss hisses. We sprint through the corridors until we reach the lab we were after. Only to get stuck behind a door that our fake authorizations can’t open. We try to smash it, but it doesn’t budge. At that, the commander decides to break radio silence, “Ixodes, we can’t access the lab. Can’t you open it remotely?”,   
“It seems to be on a separate network from the rest of the building. I can try, but it’ll take time”,  
""Time's the one thing we don't have. Move!"" Gliss hisses.  
While the two are talking, I notice that our addled hostage is acting particularly morose.  
“Sir, I think that our Farsul prisoner can open the damn door”,  
He removes the gag and hisses, ""Is that true, prey? Can you open this door?"",  
“Bracht you, predator! I won't do anything for you. You can just kill me now. But I am not helping you!”

In that moment, it makes a very dumb mistake, it locks eyes with Nkosi. It’s rare to be able to use the first sight nowadays, by now even prey cubs know that you shouldn’t look a human in the eye. The hypnosis, compounded by the anesthetic, hits it like a freight train.   
“OPEN. DOOR” repeats Nkosi slowly, the Farsul drags itself to the door and basically collapses with its paw on the keypad. 

The door unlocks and we rush in. I cover the entrance while Nkosi uploads a worm to the systems and the commander starts examining the lab.  
“This isn’t just a chemical weapons lab like command thought, they are studying how to contrast the second sight as well” utter Nkosi while looking at his pad,  
""And there's more... Nkosi, cover the door. I want the doc to examine something"" says the commander.  
I get there, he points toward a strange looking tank, I look for the first time, then I take a second look. “Fuck. There is a frozen human in there. In what looks like a fucking German ww2 uniform”.  
“What?!” exclaims Nkosi,  
“Can you pull him out?” asks the commander,  
“Not enough time to do it safely”, I say still shocked,  
“Get a memory scan and blood sample then. Fast”,

I do it mechanically, I am about to finish when I hear Nkosi warn that the feds are upon us, we take cover and start shooting. I try not to think that we are having a shootout in a chemical weapons lab.  
“Fuck they are too many! We need backup!”  
“Ixodes, can you do something?” I hear Gliss hiss in the radio,  
Before he can respond, a Black Star's voice cuts in: ""Don't worry, predators. I'll help. Stay clear of the windows.""

*What the hell the fanatic is trying to do?!* 

I hear a sudden crash and glass shreds flow into the air. The mad Harchen had slammed the front of the shuttle into the window. It then reverses the vehicle and turns it around so we can get on board. Nkosi grabs the Farsul and we all rush toward the shuttle. While we are about to board I see a Krakatol rushing toward us talons in front, probably attempting to grab the lab-dog. I wait for it to be in range, then I go hard and fast, hitting the medulla oblongata, and watch it crash to the ground.

While we are taking off, the commander radios in “Release the rocks, we’re leaving”.  
As the shuttle rushes toward the ship, I can’t stop thinking: three weeks, three bloody weeks, and I’m out. I can’t wait.",6,1747178161.0,NatureofPredators,3,1.0,False

Cyclobenzaprine is related to the early tricyclics. Like tricyclics, there is the side effect of feeling a little bit groggy in the morning, but that evaporates after a strong cup of coffee. 

I have bipolar ll fwiw with a bit of extra spiciness like adhd and ptsd. 

The medication is being fast tracked as an fda approved treatment for fibromyalgia. Apparently it promotes stage 4 sleep which, I assume, is a good thing. Prior, I spent too much time in REM stage, often waking up screaming. Fun times for my family 😐

This personalized recovery and wellness plan is designed to support your continued recovery from BPPV while accommodating your screen-heavy lifestyle as a reviewer and gamer. It includes guidance on vestibular health, supplement support, caffeine alternatives, and a strategy for reintroducing stimulants like coffee.

🎮 Daily Gaming & Screen Strategy for Vestibular Health
• - Use 'Reduced Motion' and screen dimming settings to limit sensory overload.
• - Position monitors at eye level; avoid reclining or looking down for extended periods.
• - Limit game sessions to 90 minutes with full breaks in between.
• - Post-gaming cooldown: 10 minutes of stretching, breathing, or walking.
• - Use blue-light filters (like Night Shift or f.lux) in the evening.


🧠 Core Supplements for Recovery & Focus
• - **Magnesium Glycinate (200–400 mg at night)**: For calming the vestibular system and aiding sleep.
• - **L-Theanine (100–200 mg as needed)**: Calms nervous system after gaming or screen exposure.
• - **Vitamin D3 (800–1,000 IU) + Calcium (500–1,200 mg)**: Supports inner ear crystal stability.
• - **Omega-3s (1,000–2,000 mg EPA/DHA)**: Enhances brain/vestibular communication and eye health.
• - **Vitamin B12 (Methylcobalamin, 500–1,000 mcg)**: Aids nerve health and cognitive energy.
• - **Optional: Bilberry or Lutein** for visual support and screen fatigue.


☕ Caffeine Comeback Strategy
• - Avoid all caffeine (including tea and chocolate) for 4–6 weeks or until completely symptom-free.
• - Begin with half a cup of decaf coffee or mild green tea only after 10 days symptom-free.
• - Drink caffeine only with food, never on an empty stomach.
• - Hydrate well before and after caffeine intake.
• - Slowly reintroduce up to one full cup over 2–3 weeks if no symptoms return.


🍵 Caffeine Alternatives: Ginger + Lemon Balm Tea
• - Ginger tea reduces nausea and supports digestion.
• - Lemon balm calms the nervous system without sedation — great for daytime use.
• - Combine the two for a gentle, restorative beverage that supports recovery.
• - Widely available at grocery stores like Walmart or online from Traditional Medicinals, Yogi Tea, etc.
🛌 Evening Reset Routine
• - Sip ginger or lemon balm tea after screen use.
• - Practice 4-4-6 breathing: inhale for 4s, hold for 4s, exhale for 6s (3–5 mins).
• - Reduce lighting 1 hour before bed using warm, amber lights.
• - Avoid screens at least 20 minutes before bedtime.
• - Sleep with head slightly elevated or on the non-affected side.
 
 
🎮🌀 Personalized BPPV & Screen-Lifestyle Recovery Plan (Including Caffeine Comeback Strategy)
🎯 Your Recovery Priorities
• Reduce overstimulation from screen and sensory input
• Heal and stabilize your vestibular system
• Reintroduce caffeine without re-triggering symptoms
• Keep up with your game-review work and lifestyle in a smarter, brain-friendly way
•
 
🧠 Phase 1: Full Vestibular Reset (Now – Next 4–8 Weeks)
• What to Focus On:
• Daily gaze stabilization, neck mobility, and light cardio (walking, biking)
• Maintain magnesium, B12, omega-3, and vitamin D support
• Get 7.5+ hours of sleep with low blue light in the evenings
• Hydrate steadily — minimum 2L/day, including electrolytes
• Gaming Habits for Recovery:
• Use reduced motion settings in fast games
• Avoid intense sessions over 90 minutes without a full break
• Stick to eye-level screen height; no reclining
• Post-gaming: 10 min cool down with light stretching or breathwork
•
 
🚫 Caffeine Hold Period (Next 4–6 Weeks)
• Until nausea no longer shows up with screen use or motion:
• Avoid all caffeine, including black/green tea and chocolate
• Replace with:
o Ginger tea (anti-nausea)
o Rooibos (rich flavor, zero caffeine)
o Lemon balm or chamomile (calming, gentle on vagus nerve)
• Think of this time as letting your inner ear and brain “down-regulate” and stop being on high alert.
•
 
✅ Phase 2: Gradual Reintroduction (Weeks 6–10)
• Once you've had:
• 10+ consecutive days symptom-free
• No nausea after screens or biking
• Stable hydration and energy
• Caffeine Comeback Plan:
• Start with half a cup of decaf coffee or half-strength green tea.
• Only drink it with food (never on an empty stomach).
• Hydrate with electrolyte water before and after.
• Wait 48 hours before trying again.
• Gradually increase to full cups over 2–3 weeks.
• If symptoms return:
Go back to stimulant-free teas for 1–2 weeks and retry.
•
 
☕ Long-Term Guidelines for Caffeine in Your Lifestyle
• Max: 1 strong cup or 2 light cups/day
• Avoid after 2–3 PM (to protect sleep and vagus calm)
• Pair with hydration always
• On high-screen days: skip it or use a calming adaptogen like L-theanine with it
•
 
🧘 Final Anchors for Daily Wellness (That Actually Work)
• Magnesium Glycinate before bed
• L-theanine on overstimulated days
• Ginger tea or chew 20 min before gaming or biking
• 4-4-6 breathing or a 10-min walk after high screen exposure
• Neck rolls, eye tracking, and posture resets every 2 hours
 






🧠 Why Alcohol Is Problematic During BPPV Recovery
• Even in small amounts, alcohol can:
• Alter inner ear fluid dynamics, making symptoms worse
• Depress the central nervous system, slowing vestibular compensation
• Trigger or worsen nausea, especially with visual stimuli or motion
• Dehydrate you, increasing dizziness and inner ear sensitivity
• Disrupt sleep — which is critical for vestibular healing
• So yes, unfortunately, even beer instead of vodka can still affect your system during recovery — it’s more about the alcohol content and nervous system impact than the type of drink.
•
 
✅ Better Alternatives That Mimic the Ritual, Not the Risk
• Here are alcohol alternatives that won’t interfere with your recovery, but can still give you that sense of enjoyment or relaxation:
• 1. Non-Alcoholic Beers (0.0%)
• Best choices: Heineken 0.0, Athletic Brewing Co., Partake, or Clausthaler
• These contain no ethanol or only trace amounts (0.0–0.3%)
• Tip: Chill it in a glass with lime or a fun garnish for the ritual
• 2. Adaptogenic Mocktails
• Key ingredients: ginger, lemon, tulsi (holy basil), lemon balm, mint
• Blend with sparkling water, splash of fruit juice, and herbs for a relaxing evening treat
• Bonus: Ginger and lemon balm support vestibular calming
• Example:


🍹 Sparkling Lemon Balm-Ginger Cooler
• Brew 1 cup lemon balm tea + 1 slice ginger
• Chill and pour over ice
• Top with sparkling water + splash of cranberry
• Garnish with mint
• 3. Kava (Caution)
• Natural sedative that mimics the calming effect of alcohol without intoxication
• However, kava can be hard on the liver and is not recommended for everyone
• Verdict: Avoid unless supervised or in the final phase of recovery
• 4. CBD Beverages (Low-dose, THC-free)
• Can help with anxiety and body relaxation
• Make sure it's a broad-spectrum, THC-free version to avoid neurological confusion
• Not recommended if you're in the early phase of recovery or very sensitive
•
 
• 🧪 When Can You Safely Try Alcohol Again?
• Once you have:
• No nausea, dizziness, or imbalance for at least 2–3 weeks
• Tolerance for screens, motion, and exercise without symptoms
• Stable hydration and good sleep
• Then, and only then, you might try a single low-alcohol drink (like a beer or hard kombucha) with food, well-hydrated, and on a calm day. Observe your body's response for 24–48 hours.
•
 
• ❤️ Final Word
• You’re not giving up pleasure — you’re just hitting pause while your body finishes healing. The day will come when a cold drink won’t feel like a risk. Until then, these alternatives can help keep your spirit up without setting you back.

Over the years, I’ve heard some wild drink orders that sound like a science experiment, but I always thought mine was pretty simple:

* Venti Iced Coffee
* Sugar-Free Vanilla
* Extra Half & Half
* 4 Splenda
* Upside Down

Here’s the thing: despite how basic I think that is, there’s like a 90% chance it tastes different every single time I order it across both stores.

At my main store, one barista nails it every time. Another does it accurately enough. The manager also makes it relatively solid. I had to talk to the manager at one point because I was sick of paying for a drink that was so inconsistent. As we talked, the manager told me I have to say “upside down,” which apparently means different things at each store. One says it just means stirred. The other says it’s part of an “old” way they used to make drinks. There are times where I test that theory out by not even saying upside down, and sometimes it's made how I expect it to taste. Go figure....

I don’t go crazy with coffee—I like it the way I like it, but it’s not that deep. Still, with how often it tastes different, it’s driving me a little nuts.

I’m Vero (35F), based in San Francisco, and I’m working on starting a book club called the **ETL Book Club – SF** (Enemies to Lovers Book Club).

If you’ve ever wished you had someone to text during a spicy chapter meltdown or debate your favorite morally gray prince over wine, this might be your kind of club.

Now, it's almost 3pm and some guy orders 2 large coffees. Since it's so late in the afternoon, we didn't have any coffee made so it would have to be brewed. I told him to pull forward. He refuses. I close my window and get my manager. My manager tells him that he can either pull forward or get a refund. The customer demands a refund. My manager processes the refund, hands it to him and tells him to leave. 


The customer immediately flips a switch and starts yelling, threatening, trying to fight the manager. Apparently the order taker took too long to get to him, which is why he refused to move forward. The   manager keeps telling to leave the drive thru and closes the window. The customer THEN OPENS THE WINDOW so he could continue to yell and threaten. The manager closed and locked the window. The customer continues to refuse to move. 


We had to get a second manager who opened the window and told him to leave. He started up again and manager 2 had to explain that we didn't have coffee on hand and we had to brew it. You know what this man did? HE DEMANDED COFFE. He honestly thought that even after getting a refund, yelling and threatening a manager, he would still get free coffee. My manager was firm. He demanded names and drove off. We all had to calm down a little. Thankfully, the next customer had a retail badge on so they understood when I explained that he was one of ""those"" customers.


Yall, it's coffee. It's not even starbucks coffee. It's literally McDonald's coffee. Don't catch a charge because you think you are the main character. 


Fun fact. By the time, he drove off, the coffee had been finished for like 2 minutes. He literally only had to wait 1-2 minutes for coffee.",27,1747177500.0,McDonaldsEmployees,3,0.97,False

It was Marry Me Chicken from Delish and roasted broccoli and red bell peppers. It's a really simple meal that's way better than it has any right to be. 

I also intentionally ran out of coffee today. I'll be forced to go to the grocery store tomorrow, and I'll have to brush my teeth and wash my face before I do that, to avoid any perceived judgement from the cashier.

1km04i7,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1km04i7/my_boss_has_lost_her_damn_mind/,My boss has lost her damn mind.,"I don’t know what happened, aside from a meeting she went to recently with other insurance agents in the area, but she’s making a bunch of changes in our office all at once. 

One of the changes I’m 100% on board with. Repainting the office and new flooring. Neither have been done in probably 2 decades. 

The other stuff? Driving me nuts! 

She wants me to put 5 post-it notes on one side of my computer monitor every day, move them to the other side when I’ve completed 5 goals. And write down those said completed goals on the post-it’s.Every. Day. I’m not even in sales. I’m a CSR. My goals are things like get Google reviews and cross-sell. Stuff I already, habitually, do and have been doing for years. Feels patronizing. But whatever.

She suddenly wants us to offer to make coffee and serve snacks to our customers. What is this? A bistro or an insurance agency? And who’s washing the mugs when they’re done with their coffee? As a licensed insurance representative, I didn’t sign up for dish washing duties. I’ll go apply at the local coffee shop if that’s how it’s going to be. Would you like me to stand outside the restroom with a towel for them? 

She told us to tell customers “thank you for your loyalty” after getting off the phone with them/they leave our office. I’ll continue saying what I’ve always said. “Thank you. Have a nice day.” This isn’t Chic-fil-A. I got out of the retail/food industry and got away from this “customized” customer service speak. I’m not going back. 

And last but not least, we’re doing a “where’s (enter our mascot name here) Wednesdays” where we’re expected to call local business and ask if we can bring our cardboard cutout of our mascot to have our picture taken with him at their place of business. Every week. Oh! And she, as the *agent* said she “may or may not be able to participate in our “where is_____Wednesdays.” Okay? You’re literally the agent. This is *your* business and *your* idea. Da fuq you mean you “may or may not” be able to participate?! 

But we’ve gone from being a *very* laid back office, to all of this, all at once. And now my brain hurts. I would have been okay with a couple of these things. Or maybe if they happened gradually over time. But this is all at once and out of fucking Nowheresville. 

I’m sure there is more but I’ve lost track.

Is this “ideas from the meeting” or narcotics? Because this looks like speed to me. Our office is a wreck because she moved all the extra desks, bought a bunch of fake plants and storage containers, to make the snack bars and shit is everywhere. She took everything off the walls for the painters but we haven’t even gotten a quote yet. Add all this new stuff we’re supposed to do/say…I’m just. I’m overstimulated…",47,1747177256.0,antiwork,21,0.94,False

In this role, I build campaigns, do competitive research, analyze product performance, and prepare reports and presentations for senior leadership. Over time, I've taken on more responsibility and built a reputation for being dependable and analytical. Still, the job is getting a bit tedious, and as the youngest one on my team, I usually get a lot of the work no one else wants to do.

Before this, I worked in customer-facing roles, first as a teller and then in customer service, so I understand the front lines and now the back office side, too.

Our company recently merged with another financial institution, leading to organizational changes and new opportunities. I was in a product analyst role, which I enjoyed, but through the merger, I was forced into this role rather than a product role, which was what I wanted, but it also introduced some uncertainty around pay structure and growth paths. I earn under **80k CAD in pre-tax income** and have decent savings/investments; **I am currently 25**. I eventually want to lead a team or move into a higher-impact, higher-paying role, ideally in a leadership or strategy position.

I'm doing well financially, but I want to **keep steadily growing my salary**. I'm unsure if I should push for a promotion internally, try to job-hop, look at getting new certifications or degrees, or just quit and take some time for myself (travel, try and start a business, etc). I have tried all of the first three without much luck, which is beginning to push me to the 4th option. Every time I try to talk about compensation at work, they shut it down and blame the merger. I have applied to around 50 jobs externally, including coffee chats and reaching out to recruiters. I have received little engagement on the applications, which has been a bit discouraging. I've completed a project management certificate and attempted CFA Level 1, but didn't pass, but barely, so I am confident I could pass if I wrote it again (just not sure I want to write the other two levels)
