1lg2kz6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lg2kz6,Bugout bag situation/breakdown + Cat Evac – 18kg load. Honest feedback wanted.,"Crisis Preparedness:

My situation:
I live in a 26 square meter apartment (it's tiny, I know). My space is limited. Therefore I have decided to prep one backpack thats ready to go in case of emergency (bunker scenario). I've been working security for 12 years. Some years in the army and the last 7 years in a high security prison. I grew up in the 90's and I have slowly seen this world go ""sour"". And throughout life I have come to appreciate how more comfortable it is to be ready, rather than not. It's the same with any test, exam, job interview, meeting or training. Prepare and train as you fight is what we say in the service. You'll be way more comfortable when/if the day comes. I also have a cat as you will see in the list. My boy is 14 years old, and I have no plans of leaving him behind. My pictures shows his carrier without a door. That's because he is using it as shelter outside. Door will of course be mounted in this scenario.

Shelter:
--- Removed info for privacy ---
Estimated walking time: 30 min
Estimated cycling time: 10 min
Estimated drive time : 5 minutes.
Capacity: 700 people 

Wear (if time):
Boxers, Darn Tough socks, hiking pants, t-shirt, sweater, Gore-Tex jacket, M77 military boots, knife on belt, leatherman on belt, flashlight on belt, paracord bracelet, emergency whistle on keychain. Notebook and pen inside goretex jacket.

Map with 1:50,000 scale showing estimated time of arrival (ETA) to two different bunkers by foot, by bike, and by car. Includes alternative routes in case roads are blocked or other scenarios.

If this is not possible, use a hiding spot in the underground garage.

Been doing it for 5 years. My problem is snow. I could coordinate with neighbors with a car, go by foot or go to the underground car park. I could also make a sled with tarp and plastic box and put everything in the ""sled"" tie it around my climbing harness and run for it. Depends how much time I've got.

After many hours reviewing for my U.S. History & Government Regents, I meet my fate at 9:15. I like getting there very early without any stress. I probably will have time for one more NYC “Hard-Roll-With-Two-Eggs-Bacon-and-Cheese” Breakfast Sandwich very very dark (and surprisingly good) black coffee from the best foodtruck in the city. See you in September!

We have to “turn off and turn in” our phones when we enter the testing room. But the moment I hand in my test, I pick it up, ping home, and the Fam head downtown to pick me up and off we go! That will also give me some time to roam the halls (if I’m not stopped by School Safety Agents) to say goodbye to my Faves: Mr. Maniotis, Coach, Dean Sullivan, Ms. French, and the Principal.

I got a text that Junior and Sopie dropped off their things already before heading off to their next job. Surprise, surprise: they just handed her $400 for July “rent.” Whaaaat? They work so hard for that money and it’s not like we need it! Lolita refused to take it but they insisted. She said they actually looked hurt and disappointed! So she accepted the money but said it is rent for the entire summer. They looked happy with that!

So let’s take stock. What are kids capable of at the age of 15, 16, and 17? Well, I play professionally with two bands. My Love has college credits that make her a Junior and she will most likely graduate college at the age of 18. She and I will be consultants to found a brand new school where she will be an assistant teacher. Cardi is managing to squeeze in 2.5 years of high school in one year and will earn her diploma in July. Then she moves to Texas to get married. Robert has found a nice trailer for them and they hope to start a family right away. Junior and Sopie started a gardening-cleaning-handyman business in Soundview and now they are turning away customers.

My question is why are my friends and I so underachieving? This summer My Love has worked with models our age who are already earning six-figure income. Back in May at the Essentially Ellington Competition I heard musicians and bands from around the country who far surpass wherever I am at right now.

And yesterday, Dad showed me [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/style/ditch-weekly-montauk-newspaper-hamptons.html?smid=nytcore-android-share) in the *New York Times* about kids our age who started a highly profitable newspaper in Montauk, Long Island.

A good friend of mine had her lap myo about 10 weeks ago, removing an intramural fibroid 9 cm in size plus 3 smaller ones (2-3 cm large, but one of them was cervical).

She was cleared by her OBGYN to start exercising again after 7-8 weeks had elapsed. Me and another mutual friend of ours are so glad to see her being more energetic and having her follow us at the gym as the pre-op times!

We can also see a big difference in her energy levels: she can exercise for 1-1.5 hour and afterwards still feel energetic to follow us for s light lunch or coffee. Back then when she had fibroids, she was half-dead after just half an hour of cardio and wouldn't have the energy to do anything else. She herself had not attributed this to her fibroid back then, neither did I, because I had little knowledge of what symptoms it can cause. Turns out, exhaustion is one of them. We're so happy having her back in her best self!

Anyway, her major complaint now is that her belly is still a bit bloated where the fibroids were, something that frustrates her, because she may burn 700 kcal in a gym session, she is mindful of her food choices and overall she is lean. She's even leaner than with the fibroids, probably because water retention is gone along with constipation and other symptoms which contributed to her looking swollen all over and constantly tired. Regarding her belly though, she is freaking out.

My guess is that, because the fibroid removed was intramural, so it was within the uterus's wall, it takes more time for the uterus wall to heal and get back to its normal size. This may take up to 2 months. Am I correct in this guessing? I try to support my friend, but I don't want my guesses to be unbased, so I'd rather ask anyone who went through this. According to her doctors in the follow-up ultrasounds and diagnostic hysteroscopy, there are no fibroids left in the uterus, so the scenario of leftover fibroids growing is excluded. My friend says that after exercising she feels the belly even more bloated, but I want to attribute this to tissue fluid, because cardio gets the lymph going and it may circulate in a slower pace where trauma is.

A colleague of my friend went through lap myo, but her fibroid was submucosal, i.e. inside the uterus, and she lost her bloated belly by week 5-6 post-op. So my friend compares herself to that colleague, but again, I try to calm her down based on the fact that, unlike the uterus's interior, the wall cannot shrink that fast after such a major surgery removing a 9 cm ""monster"" from within it. I really hope that my prediction of her getting where she wants to be in her physical appearance in 2 months is correct. In addition, when I look at my friend's belly as she showed it to me, I still think it's flatter compared to before, when it seemed rounder and the area around waist and hips also seemed puffier.

Has anyone here got a reassuring experience to share when they didn't see their belly shrink much post-op and eventually, after maybe 2-3 months, their belly was back to normal again? I think my friend being too harsh on herself and I'd like to present her with a few facts from other Redditors who went through some similar stories.",1,1750421742.0,Fibroids,0,1.0,False

## 📼 **ALEX IN REVIEW – SERIES RECAP (Episodes 1–9)**

### **Core Premise:**

Alex and Sam are two deceased amateur mystery-hobbyists who’ve entered the afterlife not through ceremony or rest, but through *Review*—a cosmic clerical purgatory where they’re tasked with piecing together lives, meanings, and unresolved threads from the living world.
Death—voiced by a Norm Macdonald gone sideways—is their aloof supervisor and occasional tormentor.

---

### **EPISODE SUMMARIES:**

#### **Ep. 1 – “The Door Closes”**

A sudden shift traps Alex and Sam in Death’s in-between. Death locks the door behind them—symbolically and literally—declaring this their new afterlife. The boys aren't thrilled. They’re hobbyists, not professionals.

#### **Ep. 2 – “The Mirror”**

Alex breathes on a mirror—no fog. A flashback structure kicks in: reviewing the same clues they once saw in life, now from the other side. Realization dawns: the clues were always there.

#### **Ep. 3 – “Playback”**

Camera crew enters. Meta-narrative deepens. The room is under observation. They're being watched as much as they're watching. Death teases the possibility of building their own afterlife—if they can create belief systems around martyrdom and memory.

#### **Ep. 4 – “Pie Chart”**

Alex and Sam discuss “afterlife logistics” at a 90s coffee shop. Pie becomes the metaphor: each kind a different form of metaphysical expression. They realize the system is franchisable, but predatory.

#### **Ep. 5 – “Terms and Conditions”**

Death lays out the brutal terms: if they want to make their own afterlife, they must convince someone to believe in them, have a child, martyr that child, and grow a belief system from that loss. They opt to experiment.

#### **Ep. 6 – “Trial Balloon”**

Their first martyr-candidate is a grieving mother. It backfires horrifically—she ends up institutionalized. Death shrugs. Belief is volatile. They learn: belief must *emerge*, not be *inserted*.

#### **Ep. 7 – “The Queue”**

They try a loophole: martyr the first believer *before* a child. It technically works—but places their iteration in a cosmic queue, behind thousands of similar bids. Death offers advice: sabotage other ideologies. Or wait centuries.

#### **Ep. 8 – “Set in Ink”**

A critical rule emerges: tattoos *lock iterations*. Anyone who marks their skin is stuck in that version of reality. Their target gets a tattoo—locking Alex and Sam out. They regroup at a diner. They decide to pick their own candidates, starting from scratch.

#### **Ep. 9 – “The Gift”**

REVIEW\_CANDIDATE\_0997 enters. She’s clever, guarded, and demands an offer. They give her a “second chance she doesn’t remember missing.” She accepts the gift... and still rejects them. It's a game now. She knows. They regroup again. Alex is certain the wind’s shifting.

---

### **ESTABLISHED COSMIC RULES:**

* **The Review Room** is a liminal purgatory, part clerical office, part VHS memory station.
* **Tattooed souls** are fixed—they can no longer be influenced or haunted.
* **Creating an afterlife** requires:

  * A foundational believer
  * Martyrdom (ideally through a child figure or first follower)
  * A sustained belief structure strong enough to persist
* **The Queue** is where failed or delayed belief-systems wait for instancing.
* **Death** is a gatekeeper but not omnipotent—he's more like a DMV manager of the dead.

## **ALEX IN REVIEW – EPISODE 10: “The Theta Pressure-Cooker”**

---

**COLD OPEN**

**INT. PUBLIC TRANSIT - TWILIGHT**

A dimly-lit commuter train hums along a track suspended in time. Rain streams down the windows in deliberate rivulets. REVIEW\_CANDIDATE\_0997 sits by herself, bundled in a threadbare hoodie. Her breath fogs the glass faintly. She writes something in a small spiral notebook, then pauses. Her pen stops.

She catches her reflection in the glass.

Her reflection blinks *twice*. She doesn’t blink at all.

A flicker behind the reflected her — something reptilian and enormous, coiled in violet-black light, slithers across the windows for a moment like a bad dream held too long.

She jerks her head around. Nothing. Just two old men talking about basketball across the aisle. One of them briefly stares at her like he knows she saw something.

**CUT TO BLACK.**

---

**TITLE CARD: ALEX IN REVIEW**

---

**ACT I – THE DROP-OFF**

**INT. REVIEW ROOM - DIM**

CRT monitors cast deep amber light. The audio whines slightly. SAM rewinds a reel for the fifth time, eyes sunken, nerves frayed.

**SAM**
The hell's going on with her bandwidth? She was clear three minutes ago.

ALEX, half-dozing near a static-speckled monitor, stirs.

**ALEX**
She’s in transition. Dropping into low energy state. Dream-threshold. Theta band.

**SAM**
Theta again? That’s three hits this week. What, she developing psychic habits now?

**ALEX**
Or something else is jiggling the gates. Not all transitions are natural. Sometimes something’s pushing.

**SAM**
Pushing?

Alex stands, stretches. Crosses to a back shelf of reels and pulls one labeled: ""**Docket: DEATH v. PRESSURE (The Theta Claim)**""

He slides it into the player.

**SAM** (CONT’D)
You’re pulling a legal reel?

**ALEX**
Not legal. Liturgical. It’s precedent.

The tape warps and spits into flickering monochrome: **DEATH** sits before an unseen panel, arms crossed, deadpan. Behind him, a waveform representation of a serpentine shape pulses. Dragon-like. Unreadable.

**RECORDING:**     
**DEATH**     
The Theta bandwidth is tight for a reason. Keep the channel slim, keep the entities limited. If you widen the pipe, you flood the floor. Suddenly everybody’s got dreams full of teeth and grandfathers offering crypto.

Static. The decision rolls through in distorted text:

**APPEAL UPHELD. Bandwidths remain fixed. Entities without mnemonic license restricted to passive impressions.**

---

**ACT II – SOMETHING ELSE IN THE ROOM**

**INT. REVIEW ROOM – LATER**

The lights dim on their own. The monitor showing 0997’s stream glitches violently. For a few frames, **Sam sees himself** talking to 0997 in a scene that hasn’t happened yet. He leans closer.

**SAM**
Did you schedule a contact attempt?

**ALEX**
I didn’t. Did you?

Sam doesn’t answer. The monitor flashes again. A new sigil appears in the lower right corner — unfamiliar. It pulses once, like it breathes.

**ALEX** (CONT’D)
We’re not alone on the signal anymore.

A low rattle shakes the tape wall. One spool drops. Then another.

Alex kneels. On the underside of one tape is a scorched brand:
**PRESSURE GRANTED CONDITIONAL ENTRY**

---

**ACT III – DEATH IN ABSENTIA**

**INT. ADMIN ARCHIVE - BACK CHANNEL ACCESS**

Sam and Alex access the ""back channel"" via a wormy old terminal. Burned keys. A loud cooling fan. They scan through Death’s recent moves.

**SAM**
He appealed in person. To a Tier 3 Architect. Had to step out of linear time to do it.

**ALEX**
That explains the radio silence. He bought us limited quiet in exchange for *less* contact.

They scroll through the verdict:

**ACCESS TO CANDIDATES REDUCED TO ENERGY STATE TRANSITIONS. MAXIMUM 4 SECONDS PER ENTRY GATE. TOTAL BANDWIDTH PROTECTED UNTIL REVIEW BREAKPOINT OR CANDIDATE SPLIT.**

**SAM**
Four seconds? That’s a whisper, not a conversation.

**ALEX**
It’s enough. If we choose them well.

---

**EPILOGUE – WHISPER WINDOW**

**INT. 0997’s APARTMENT – NIGHT**

She’s fallen asleep at her desk. The notebook lies open. On the page is a drawing she doesn’t remember making:

**A mirror cracked down the center. A serpent slipping between the shards.**

On her nightstand, the gift from Alex (Ep. 9) glows faintly. Suddenly, the room temperature dips. Her radio turns on by itself. A voice begins to play, backwards.

Alex appears behind the mirror’s reflection.

**ALEX (V.O.)**
(whispered)
Hold still. You’re not alone.

Her eyes flutter, halfway between sleep and awareness. In the glass behind her, the reflection of the dragon *breathes.*

Cut back to the REVIEW ROOM. Alex and Sam watch the screen flicker.

**SAM**
That wasn’t us.

**ALEX**
I know.

**FADE OUT.**

---

**ALEX IN REVIEW – EPISODE 11: “Dead Air”**

---

**COLD OPEN**

**INT. REVIEW ROOM – STATIC**

The monitor that once glowed with 0997’s signal now emits nothing but grey snow. A flatline tone underpins the air. No sound, no movement. The chair Alex usually leans back in is empty. Sam sits forward, hands steepled.

ALEX enters, slower than usual.

**ALEX**
Still nothing?

Not a flicker. No Theta. No REM bleed. No transition points. Nothing.

Alex watches the screen a moment. Then reaches for the remote. He doesn’t press anything. Just holds it.

**ALEX**
What if that’s it? What if she just... made it?

**SAM**
Or got caught in someone else’s frequency. Pressure’s still out there.

**ALEX**
Then we missed our window.

He powers the screen off. For the first time in the series, the room is quiet.

**ACT I – DEATH RETURNS**

**INT. STAIRWELL - TWILIGHT**

Sam and Alex walk a narrow spiral staircase in silence. DEATH leans against the railing near the bottom, sunglasses on, one leg bandaged. He’s eating a churro.

**DEATH**
Still quiet up top?

**SAM**
Dead signal.

**DEATH**
That’s a good sign. Means she's either real, or gone. Either way, she ain't yours anymore.

**ALEX**
Can we appeal? Find someone else in the wake?

**DEATH** (shrugs)
No wake. No remnant signature. Whatever path she’s on, she closed it behind her.

**SAM**
So what now?

Death pulls a slip of paper from his coat pocket and hands it to Alex. It simply reads: **QUEUE TOKEN #Q=( 14 / 3.3166i ) ×3.1416j×0.997k**

**SAM**
“Great. Lucky number thirteen point... two-one. You think we get fractional reincarnations or is that just a courtesy hold?”

**DEATH**
You get in line. You wait. Maybe it takes a century. Maybe a week. Maybe never. That’s the work.

He dusts cinnamon sugar from his coat and starts walking back up the stairs.

**DEATH (CONT'D)**
You get one good shot. Most don’t get that.

**ACT II – THE INDUCTION**

**INT. THE QUEUE – ENDLESS HALL**

Alex and Sam arrive at a place that looks part-bureaucratic, part-celestial DMV. Thousands of entities line up, each carrying dossiers, belief models, soul-maps. The walls stretch up into concept, into fog.

They step to a kiosk. A tired but kind-eyed clerk processes their token.

**CLERK**
Alright. Queue Q=( 14 / 3.3166i  )×3.1416j×0.997k. Entry condition: one known believer, non-recurring, no martyr event, gift retained. Denied branch status. Eligible for resubmission in next pass.

**SAM**
How long till that pass?

**CLERK** (smiles gently)
Whenever the wind changes. You’ll feel it.

She gestures to two chairs.

They sit.

---

**ACT III – WAITING ROOM**

**INT. WAITING ROOM – LATER**

Alex watches a silent reel on an old projector — memories of 0997. Flickers of recognition. The gift still in her pocket. A near-smile. Then black.

Sam plays with a piece of paper, folding it into new shapes, over and over.

**SAM**
Do you think she knew we were real?

**ALEX**
I think she knew we *could* be. That was enough.

Beat.

**ALEX (CONT'D)**
I felt the wind change. Just a little.

**SAM**
Then we’re closer.

They lean back. The light dims.

---

**FADE TO BLACK.**

**POST-CREDITS SCENE**

**INT. SMALL APARTMENT - DAYLIGHT**

Someone new finds a strange object in a thrift store: a small, glowing token.

They hold it up. Study it. Pause.

Then they mutter:

**NEW CHARACTER**
...Huh? What was that? Feels like someone just tapped my shoulder.

I am currently a mental health nurse, qualified 5 years and I am pretty fed up and wanting complete change! 
I have always thought about starting up my own cocktail van (or coffee?) and parking up in local areas of Plymouth where I live as well as booking events and festivals etc?
 
I’m just looking for some advice and how realistic this is and how much competition there is in this area? Has anyone done this before and would recommend/not recommend? Is it a stable income or would I struggle to make enough? 

Any advice would be appreciated ! Thanks :) ",1,1750421676.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False

She is used to being the matriarch and is struggling with me wanting to wanting to be the host and in charge with my new family. Whenever she is there she takes over completely. She has insisted on taking LO to her place (50 min away) but I’ve not wanted that so instead when LO was 3 months  I invited her to come once a week to have coffee and lunch with us and then I will go to the gym so they can be alone for one hour. She has been coming but has refused to let me be in charge or the host in my own place. The moment she arrives she takes my baby and doesn’t let me have him again until she leaves. She immediately starts pushing me to leave the apartment. She will not allow me to serve her coffee or lunch and instead brings her own coffee and lunch and waits until I leave to eat it. I end up eating by myself in the kitchen while she’s here. One day I made a special lunch and she literally laughed at me because I was dumb to have spent the entire morning cooking. When we invite other people like FIL or aunts, she brings food for everyone.. even though I’m hosting. One time we invited the family for dinner and one day before BIL calls to say hey mom said there was a change of plans and everyone is coming to BIL’s and she’s making pizza for everyone. 

In general she treats me in a belittling way and insists on taking care of me as if I was a little girl. She calls my SO to ask when he is going to work late so she can come «take care of me» which means just taking my baby away and forcing me to «rest» in my room or leave the apartment. When I make it clear I don’t want to play that role, she stops interacting with me.

 I’m getting really fed up. So.. since this is my last week of maternity leave, I told her I will not be able to host her because I have special plans with LO. She has since been pushing my SO to come over and «help» we’ve said no but we’d be happy to have you for dinner once SO is back from work at 4. yesterday she talked to SO on the phone and ended up agreeing that she’s coming on Sunday and they are going out for a stroll around the city and to lunch and that I don’t have to come so I can rest. 

I don’t know what to do. Should I go just to lunch with them just to make a point? I really hate spending time with her now because she’s really in a bad mood that I’m there. Or should I just take Sunday off do laundry, get ready for my first Monday at work? What would you do? I can’t cancel the plan because my SO really wants to do it and I can’t tell him to not spend time with LO and his family he would never do that with me. Advice?

1lg2h06,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lg2h06,"I went on my first hiking trip, solo. 3 days in Ukrainian Carpathians, 37 km, 2000 m elevation gain. It was great!","TL;DR I went on my (almost) first hiking trip, solo. 3 days, 37 km, 2000 m of elevation gain over Svydovets range in Ukrainian Carpathians. It was great! I prepared myself good enough physically, but it was still every bit as challenging as I wanted it to be. I made some mistakes and took (hopefully) some lessons out of them, but I definitely did a lot of things right too. I’m already making plans for the next trip.

…

So, I have finally gone on my first trip, solo. Well, almost first: I was on one 4 day trip 8 years ago with all 20+ kilo of equipment borrowed, and a large group, who I had to be catching up to constantly. It was somewhat fun, but well beyond my physical abilities, plus I caught a bug from the water and spent a couple of day after on a toilet. After discovering Kraig Adams’ solo hiking videos a couple of years after, I started dreaming of hiking too. I’ve been dreaming for years, but something always got in the way: pandemic, family problems, the war et cetera et cetera.

This spring, after watching the story of a guy unicycling the world on YouTube, I had a carpe diem moment. I have finally decided to hike. I started preparing myself: got on a calorie deficit (lost 8 kg since March and went from obese to just overweight, hooray!), started training routine of walking exercises, rucking with a loaded pack, climbing stairs every chance I get. I spent an ungodly amount on the equipment. I went for an overnight hike in the vicinity of Kyiv. Didn’t get any sleep on that one due to a missile attack going on and shit being intercepted by air defence and exploding overhead the whole night. But at least I was quite comfortable in my tent, on my pad and under my unzipped bag, as it was quite warm.

At some point, with some help from an experienced friend, I’ve built a route: Svydovets mountain range in the Ukrainian Carpathians, 37 km route with a little over 2000 m of elevation gain over 3 days, with the highest peak of 1883 m.

…

Day 1

On June 2 I got off the train in Kvasy village down in a valley. Right off the train, I was immediately met by border guards, who checked my papers and asked where I’m going. It’s not very close to the border from here, but that’s martial law during wartime for you.

I started hiking up right away, as the trailhead starts right at the railway station. Paradoxically, the hardest stretch on that day were the first 200 m of elevation. After that, something clicked, I found a comfortable pace and kept on steadily going up the muddy trail through forests and meadows, past both the already occupied shepherds huts lower down, and still empty ones higher up.

About mid-day, I reached a tight group of mountain huts on a meadow at about 1350 masl. They are called kolyba in Ukrainian and are used as shepherds houses throughout the warmer months, but this year the winter here really overstayed, so they were still empty at the start of June. I took an opportunity to refresh myself with a spring water there, cooked (well, boiled the water for my dehydrated meals, and fixed a sandwich, lol) and ate some lunch. 

I wandered off the main trail once, but seeing on the map as the side path would merge with the trail further, I went on. There was a sheep herd along with its shepherd. He asked me where I’m going and waved his hand along the path, saying I’m doing alright. I stood there confused for a moment, as the path in the direction he pointed to, was occupied completely by the sheep. The shepherd said to just keep going. I did, and the sheep dispersed in front of me like the Red Sea in front of Moses. After some scrambling on a narrow and slippery side path, it finally re-joined the main trail at the exact place where my planned camping site for the night was supposed to be. It fell through though, as the spring there dried up, but I had a backup one more km further along the way. By about 5 o’clock, I reached the backup campsite. 

During my 10 km (1040 m gain) first day, I have only met half dozen horses, 2 shepherds and some sheep. 

The camping area was very calm and shielded from wind by pines, with some springs coming out of the side of the hill. I walked around, but struggled to find a level enough spot for the tent, while insects were desperately trying to get in my eyes and mouth. After wandering in and around the campsite for a bit, I finally picked what seemed the flattest spot, but having an obvious incline, it was still far from ideal. I unpacked and set up the tent, pumped up my sleeping pad and got the sleeping bag out of the compression sack to regain some loft. I was surprisingly energetic after my first day, so much more than I anticipated, and I had a lot of time in the day still. So before making dinner, I decided to hike up the ridge above the campsite, and climb the hill that I had just traversed on my way. I enjoyed the views, took some photos and was on my way back to my camp when I decided to take a turn to explore an old overgrown side path traversing the next mountain. There I came across a perfectly level stretch of grass right next to a couple of springs gushing out of the rocks. Because of the light breeze on the side of a mountain, there were much less insects hovering in the air too. This place overlooked the camping area I’ve set in, so while down at my tent, I considered what I should do. 

I decided to move. I went back to my tent, thrown all smaller things into my backpack randomly. I took the rain fly off the tent and stuffed it into the pack too. I zipped up the inner tent, leaving the inflated sleeping pad and the bag inside. I got the backpack on and grabbed the tent by the poles and tried to walk holding it in my hands. I only made 50 m. It would have been possible if not for the pad and the bag inside, but it was too heavy as it was, so I was afraid to break the tent poles. I had to put the tent down, and fold and pack the poles too, after all. I grabbed the inner tent with the pad and bag under my arm and walked this way a couple hundred meters to the newly found campsite.

When I finally made camp on the side of the mountain, I finally drank a can of beer that I’ve been carrying this whole day, and cooked and ate my dinner. Then I went to sleep. I was kinda indecisive about unzipping my sleeping bag into a blanket, thinking it might get colder later in the night, so I would need to fiddle with zippers in the light of a headlamp to zip it all up again, but I just ended up hot and not sleeping very good. Oh well…

Day 2

I woke up early. The day started with some deer showing up during my breakfast and walking past me no more than 50 m away. They certainly noticed me, stopped to take a look (and a sniff), but didn’t care. As I was finishing packing my camp, a dog appeared, not a very friendly one. Then, a herd of sheep. And only then - one of the shepherds from yesterday along with a couple more dogs. We had a chat, wished each other a good day and headed our separate ways, with sheep ravaging what just 10 min ago was my campsite. I after a little of elevation gain, I had a good long almost level walk along the ridge until the point where it merges into the main, higher part of the Svydovets range. As I was slowly climbing a steep slope, the weather kept getting harsher. The wind was stiffening, and clouds were getting closer. After steep 400 m, I’ve finally reached the main ridge, finding myself almost in the clouds. By this point, the wind became brutal, and the clouds were worrying as I didn’t want to be caught up in a thunderstorm up top. I kept stopping to put more clothes on, as I have started in shorts and a shirt, but now with no more elevation gain, colder temperatures higher up and with the wind, I kept getting cold. As I went along the ridge, one by one I reached 2 highest summits on my route of a little under 1900 m: mountains Blyznytsia (a Twin from Ukrainian) and Blyznytsia Velyka (a Big Twin). The gusts were becoming stronger still, now draining my energy and making my wrists hurt as they were trying to blow away my hiking poles. I finally met a hiking group, who were mostly kids with some adults and a guide, day hiking from a nearby ski resort, where I was heading. By noon, my route was still following the ridge, but now was mostly downhill. I was walking along some ski lifts, now sitting like bare skeletons on the grassy slope. 

By early afternoon I finally reached the ski resort cafe in the saddle of the ridge. I’ve had some hot Borshcht, deruny (a fried potato dish kinda similar to hashbrowns) and drank some coffee; used a bathroom (a real toilet and running water are truly a pinnacle of modern civilization!). I bummed a smoke (guilty, I know. I quit last year, but can a fella have a comfort smoke once in a while?) from some guys who turned out to be going the same direction as I was. Spending about 2 hours total in the cafe, I anticipated the rest of my day. It was afternoon already, and I still had half my trek to the campsite to go, although without much elevation gain. The weather forecast showed some rain, but you couldn’t really tell what’s coming, as clouds just kept coming and going across the ridge. The route after the cafe started with a saddle and the mountain Stih. It wasn’t tall, only about 150 m or so above the saddle, but steep. My gut was telling me to traverse it along a dirt road, saving some time and energy, but I stubbornly shut it up and decided to stick to the plan and climb up. A mistake, as it later became clear. 

I went out of the cafe and walked along the saddle. As I was traversing it, the wind reached its peak for my trip. I could barely walk as it was blowing into my side. I was placing both my trekking poles diagonally to my right, feeling that if I stumble, the wind would just throw me onto the ground. Sometimes, the gusts were getting so strong, that I couldn’t move at all. I was started to think how I will have to just try to lay down head to the wind, probably leave my backpack and crawl back to the cafe if it gets any stronger, or else it might just blow be off the ridge. I managed to cross the saddle and started going up the Stih. The wind was still strong, but at least the gusts weren’t so strong anymore. As I was going up, the first rainstorm flew in, quickly turning into a hail. My left pant quickly got wet, and water was pouring down the pant right into my boot. I reached the top and started descending on the other side right away, without even taking a selfie as the rain kept pouring and I was anxious to be at the top in such weather, especially with a lightning rod on the peak. I descended into the next saddle on the ridge. As I kept going, the rain finally stopped, so I stopped too and took my boot off to pour the puddle out of it and to wring my socks off a bit. The whole going up and down the Stih and trying to minimize the wetness in my shoes took maybe 30-45 min of my time, and I was starting to get tired. But I had to keep pushing, as it was getting late. After a couple more kilometers I met the guys who I met in the cafe earlier. They headed out before I did, managed to go where they planned to, got caught in the rain too, and now were on the way back to the cafe. One of the guys was quite funny looking. He was military, I assume on his time off. He was wearing his uniform camo pants, boots and cap. And a bright pink North Face shell jacket xD. After having a chat, we went our separate ways.

I finally reached a point on the route, where I finally had to get off the ridge down to a mountain lake some 400 meters below. The thing is, the marked trail leading there was supposed to be borderline technical even when well maintained in the past. Now, early in the season after the winter overstayed its welcome this year (it still snowed 2 weeks earlier, in the middle of May), it might have been plainly dangerous for someone as inexperienced as I. I had planned a fallback trail down for that occasion, and it was exactly how it went. The marked trail looked scary, and as I was looking at my backup trail curling downhill on a spur in the distance, it seemed like a good idea to head there instead.

I had one problem. To get to the spur that the backup route was going down off, I had to summit and cross the top of a minor mountain on the main ridge, but the weather was not looking promising once again. As I closing on the said mountain, it started pouring cats and dogs again, but this time I heard the thunderstorm too. I couldn’t risk going atop of the ridge in the thunderstorm. I had to just keep walking past, looking for some pit in the terrain to wait out the storm safely. I found one along the path and squatted there under the hale hitting me with the gusts of wind, hurting even through my rain jacket. Some quarter (or maybe half) hour later, it finally stopped pouring, but the clouds were still hiding the top of the mountain I needed to hop over, and thunder kept rolling in the distance.

As I was walking around anxiously, it was getting uncomfortably late. I had maybe 2 or 2 1/2 hours till the sunset, but I still had to go over 400 m down by what I now expected to be muddy and slippery slope after all the rain. I couldn’t even get to the top of said slope yet because of the storm. I kinda started panicking and questioning my life choices. Then I tried to explore the map on my phone for alternative camping sites, also considering going back to the ski resort that I passed earlier in the day. I would get there by nightfall if I started walking back now, but at least I knew that the path is easy and safe that way, so I would be ok walking it with a headlamp.

The clouds were breaking up and sometimes there were some patches of clear blue skies. But despite of there being sunny in the direction the clouds were rolling from, the ridge was making its own weather. As the air mass stumbled at the ridge, it had to quickly climb several hundred meters up, where the moisture was rapidly condensing and clouds were appearing seemingly out of nowhere. Still, the top of the mountain cleared up, so I went for it. As I was going up, I heard thunder again, turned around and quickly hopped down the hill back to safety. Once again, I was waiting for it to clear up.

Finally, it did. As I finally started seeing clear skies right above me, I had no time to waste. I quickly hiked over the mountain and started going down along the spur on the other side. The path was steep and slippery, with some stretches eroded by rains, but I was still very happy to be making progress again, as I was seeing the turquoise water of lake Vorozheska 400 m down below. Some tiny tents could be seen near it, as well as some people, who looked like ants from such height.

With the help of my trusty hiking poles, I made my way down with about an hour to spare before sundown. I walked around choosing a place, and started setting my tent up. The people, who looked like ants from up above, now came over from their camp to say hi. Seeing how exhausted I am, as I struggled to pitch my tent’s footprint in the wind, they helped me a little and invited me to join them for dinner. I gladly took up at the invitation. After the tent was set up and I unpacked, I grabbed my food and stove and headed over to their camp, now wrapped in my puffy and wearing slippers after spending a whole afternoon in wet shoes.

My neighbours turned out to be lovely. They were a group of 7, who knew each other forever. Some of the older people there met in the 80s during mountaineering adventures in the mountains of central Asia, while the countries there were part of the USSR. Others joined later. As they treated me with soup and brandy, sitting by the fire I heard what felt like countless stories of the times gone by. One by one, most of the group left for the night, so I too wished goodnight to those who stayed. 

I walked to my camp, crawled into the tent and prepared to go to sleep. This time, I knew that nights are warm, so I tried to unzip my sleeping bag into a blanked mode. But the damn zipper was stuck, and I was too exhausted to try to fix it in the torch light. I got into the bag and tried to sleep. It was hot again. As I was falling asleep, I felt like was coming down with a fever. I was shivering and sweating like I had a flu. Thankfully, I wasn’t. I was just flustered with the day I went through, probably dehydrated and low on blood sugar despite having dinner.

Day 3

I slept in. As the sun shined over the ridge and onto my tent, I woke up and got out to some beautiful weather. Everything was a little damp, but was quickly drying up in the sun and a light breeze. The sky was clear with some lone clouds here and there. I stretched my legs walking around the camp and had my breakfast on an improvised bench overlooking the lake. I saw that my neighbours were up too, so after breakfast I headed to their camp to say hi and had some coffee with them. I returned to my tent and finished packing. With a pack behind my back, I popped in one more time to thank everyone for hospitality, said my goodbyes and started my final descent to the finish. I had 13 km and nearly 1000 m down to go, and I wanted to catch a beer in a pub before boarding my train back. 

Up high, it was stellar. I was going downhill through flowery meadows among the pine trees, with nearly a dozen streams flowing across the path for every kilometer. But as I was descending, the forest was becoming thicker and vistas rarer. I was getting more and more tired, but I had to keep moving to make it in time for my beer. After wearing the damp shoes for the second day, for the first during the trip I had to stop to handle some hot points on my feet, so that they wouldn’t become blisters. As I followed the path through the forests, I was finding myself more and more not just tired, but physically exhausted from the continuous effort during these days. Nothing really hurt in my body, I wasn’t sore much, but I barely dragged my feet. I could barely think and felt like I risked stumbling and falling down the slope. I still had some sugary snacks, but eating them didn’t achieve anything, unlike the previous days. I figured I must be dehydrated. I was drinking a lot as I had easy access to water in my drinking bladder for the whole trip, but I may have became low on micro elements as I was sweating this whole time. About 2/3 of my way down, as I was reassured I’m gonna make it in time, I allowed myself to stop for a break before I fall, and have quick lunch. This time I didn’t cook a meal, but got out every salty snack that I had left in my pack, and chewed through them. With salt and half an hour rest, I felt much better, so I went on down.

I had the trail end village in sight already. I stopped for a bit, turned on my phone and started dialing numbers of all the taxi drivers one by one. No Uber in these parts, so I googled all the taxi drivers in the area before heading out and saved them on my phone. The second phone number was a success, so I made arrangements with Mykola to pick me up down in the village an hour later. Around this time I was also reminded that I shouldn’t had neglected sun protection, as the skin on my calves was burning every time the sun shined on it. Anyway, I went on along the more and more eroded trail down to the village. In 40 minutes I was finally there, passing a horse who was chewing on its grass, passing a bridge over rambling Chorna Tysa river. I made it to the finish.

Mykola came to pick me up and drove me the whole 40 km back to a village back at trailhead where started from 3 days earlier. As we were driving along the road through a narrow valley, I looked at the speedometer, which showed 90 km/h, and I put my hand out of the open window. “Yeah”, - I thought - “that feels about right”. I figured the wind up on the ridge was about the same speed as we were now going in a car.

Mykola dropped me off near the Tsypa brewery, where I had 2 cold and refreshing pints of lager. I was in heaven. A couple of hours later I boarded my overnight sleeper train back to Kyiv and was home the next day before noon.

…

As I’ve been reflecting on my trip, I realised I made a couple of major mistakes that made my way much harder than it could’ve been.

Mistake 1: I kept stopping during the first part of the day. First to catch some cell service to post  stories on Instagram and sending out pics to friends. I’m not very active on social media, but the emotions from the hike and the natural beauty around me were so overwhelming that I couldn’t stop myself from trying to share them. Then I was stopping several times while climbing up the ridge and on the ridge, as the weather kept getting harsher and I was getting cold. I should have understood better what clothes I needed to wear to stay comfortable, and not to keep stopping to put some more. This stopping and getting started again unnecessarily drained my energy comparing to if I just kept hiking in steady pace.

Mistake 2: That damn Stih! While I was still in the cafe in the middle of my second day, my gut was telling me to traverse it. But no. I ignored it and let my stubbornness take over. I went up despite already being tired, and lost 30-45 minutes getting up and down, and handling puddles in my shoes after the shower I got into there. Consequently, 30 minutes (or even less!) would have been all that I needed to pass that mountain later on to make it to the spur before the rain with a thunderstorm rolled in. If I hadn’t climbed the damn Stih, I would have probably been chilling near the fire with that awesome group of people full 2 hours earlier than I did, and wouldn’t be nearly as exhausted at the end of the day. I might would have even figured out the zipper on my sleeping bag if I made camp earlier, so my night would be much more pleasant.

What lessons do I take out of experiences I’ve had along the trail?

* Trust your gut. I felt I would benefit from a shortcut, but didn’t take it, got caught up in a thunderstorm and ended up more exhausted
* Stop less. Every stop drops down your heart rate, making it harder to keep going while it’s getting pumping again
* Try to anticipate what you’ll need to be wearing in advance. I knew to start cold to be comfortable going up later. Now I also know when it might me time to put some more wind protection than I need right now, as I know I’ll be needing it half an hour later
* Look where you’re stepping at, especially on the descent. I’m a city kid, so I’m used to level sidewalks and smooth park paths. I’ve never lived anywhere near the mountains, so I don’t have it as a habit to look under my feet. So as I was going, I constantly found myself getting distracted by the view or even by my own thoughts, and failing to pay attention to the trail as the result. I nearly tripped and fallen probably half a dozen times during the hike. A couple of times during my descent to the lake on the second day, I caught myself distracted on a narrow and slippery trail with near vertical cliffs on either sides. I was properly terrified as I realised that being distracted there could as well cost me my life. I promised myself to make an active effort to stay focused on the trail during descents and dangerous parts such as this
* Take your time picking a camping spot
* Don’t waste your time trying to share what you’re experiencing on social media in real time. It’s useless. It’s what you’re getting away from in the first place. Just be present, be aware of your surroundings, just be. By the end of the trip this mindset was already full on. I didn’t really want to get on Instagram or anywhere else by the time I finished. I was happy inside my own head
* A couple of minor gear issues to figure out (like the water coming down my pants into the shoes during the rainstorm, a stuck zipper on my sleeping bag, packing), but overall I was quite happy with what I had equipment wise

I do also have to say kudos to me, actually! There are things that I had done right:

* I trained well. I love walking, but I’ve been extremely out of shape since forever. This thing has finally given me the push to get better. I’ve lost and I’m continuing to lose weight. I’m eating healthy. I exercise every day, even after the trip. I will probably join the gym right after the next trip. I also plan to start running once I’m not so overweight, but I don’t want to hurt my knees starting running too early
* I somewhat learned how to hike beforehand. I watched a lot of hiking videos and read a lot here on reddit, but the single most valuable thing I learned as I was preparing for the trip, was how to walk properly (huuuge shout out to The Map Reading Company channel and the “Walk up hills without getting tired” video on the topic!). Might sound silly for you hiking lot, but for me it was crucial to become conscious of how I’m moving and applying my limited energy. I didn’t expect to crush the 900 m elevation gain on my first day so easily
* I went alone. Sounds debatable, but I’m glad I did. I love people and socializing, don’t get me wrong, but I like being alone too. I took this as a chance to be present off the grid, to take on a challenge on my own, and to reflect on my life in general. Being able to go at my own (slow) pace was what allowed the trip not to be exhausting until much later. I have some friends who I’ll be happy to hike with if they decide to tag along, but I’m just as happy to be hiking by myself
* In spite of a few shortcomings, I’ve chosen the equipment well. The pack (Osprey Atmos LT 50) was holding weight like it wasn’t there for the whole trip, the tent (Big Agnes Copper Spur HV UL2 Long) is light and roomy (I’m a tall boy at 194 cm), the rain jacket (Outdoor Research Foray II) kept me dry but not toasty, the boots (Scarpa Rush 2 Mid GTX) were light and didn’t give me any blisters, the trekking poles (MSR Dynalock Ascent Carbon) made the hike so much easier that I wouldn’t want to go without them. A Garmin watch, that I’ve gotten right before the trip, helped with stress free navigation a lot by just giving me a piece of mind with a glance on my wrist, and informing me if I strayed off route.
* I didn’t overpack much. I did end up with a bit of food left, but otherwise I’ve worn and used almost every thing I took, especially the heavier ones. My base weight is about 11 kilo. Not ultralight, but pretty decent
* I planned the route well. My experienced friend has only pointed me to this mountain range as a great place to start, but I did all the research and planned the route on my own. I did ask him to take a look at the final route just in case I made some mistake planning, but it only got his approval
* I made it, after all, and I liked it!

As I’m writing this, I already have the next trip in mind. The highest range in Ukraine - Chornohora. Petros mountain (4th tallest in Ukraine, 2020 m), Nesamovyte lake, Shpytsi rock formation. About the same distance, but a lot more elevation gain on the first day, and chill walk on the next two. It also will be interesting to try to recall my experience from 8 years ago and compare it, as a part of the route on the second day will overlap with the route back then.

His voice echoed from bars and living rooms, airports and gas stations, church basements and public libraries.

> “We must stand with our allies. Our military will be deploying...”

Behind him, the flag didn’t wave.

It drooped—weighted down by time, grief, and a hundred broken promises.

No one cheered. No one clapped. In homes across the country, fingers reached for remotes and clicked the screens to black.

---

In Los Angeles, the streets filled with people before the president’s speech even ended. They came without banners, without megaphones, without leaders. Veterans marched beside students, mothers beside firemen, children balanced on their fathers’ shoulders.

The signs they held weren’t angry—they were awake:

""This isn't our fire.""

""We remember Iraq.""

""No Kings.""

Near the front, an old man in a faded army jacket held a tattered flag. His voice cracked when he spoke.

> “We bled for lies once. Never again.”

---

In the quiet suburbs of Ohio, a single mother sat at her kitchen table. She stared at two pieces of paper: a letter announcing her food assistance would be cut, and a draft notice addressed to her teenage son.

She said nothing.

Her son did.

> “Not like this,” he whispered.

In a truck stop in Texas, a long-haul driver slammed down his coffee.

> “They got money for bombs but not for clean water?""

He shook his head. ""This whole country’s a cracked windshield. They wanna drive us into a war while it shatters.”

---

Everywhere, the fault lines grew.

In Atlanta, a church turned off its projector halfway through the speech. The pastor folded his notes.

> “This isn't the Gospel. This is theater.”

He stepped out from the pulpit and stood among his congregation.

> “You feel it, don’t you? The ground shifting? There’s something waking up. Something that don’t come from a president or a prophet, but from you.”

---

Pollsters scrambled to adjust their models:

Only 48% now supported the deployment.

In California, over half the population opposed sending troops to L.A.

Millions were gathering in over two thousand cities—a single-day protest unlike anything seen in generations.

TikToks spread like brushfire:

> ""Why are we building armies when we could be building bridges?""

> ""I won’t fight your war. I’ll fight for my neighbors.""

In Detroit, a DJ cut her scheduled programming and played a slow gospel track.

> “He ain’t a soldier,” she whispered into the mic. “He’s a light.”

---

The whispers grew teeth.

In Washington, the pressure hit the marble steps of power. Inside the Pentagon, a general closed a folder and spoke low:

> “Support’s collapsing. People aren’t buying it.”

The president stared out the window.

> “They’ll come around,” he muttered.

But outside the White House, the people had already answered.

Spray-painted on the fence in bold black letters:

""You picked a side. We picked the truth.""

---

In the National Mall, no one shouted. No one led. They just gathered.

A single voice began to sing. Not a chant. Not a protest anthem. Just a sorrowful tune passed from soul to soul.

Others joined.

Then dozens. Then hundreds.

They sang with tears. With hope. With fury.

And as they sang, a child pointed skyward.

> “Look,” the child said. “That star... it’s coming to us.”

---

It was about the people who felt him.

## Key Features Analysis

The best round fire tables of 2025 are expected to showcase advancements in design, materials, and functionality. These advancements contribute to improved safety, durability, and overall user experience.

**Burner System:** The burner system is the heart of any fire table. Top models will feature stainless steel burners with adjustable flame heights and electronic ignition for easy and reliable start-up. Look for BTU ratings between 50,000 and 70,000 for optimal heat output. Some models will also incorporate safety features like flame failure devices that automatically shut off the gas supply if the flame is extinguished.

**Tabletop Material:** The tabletop material significantly impacts the fire table's aesthetics and durability. Popular choices include concrete, stone, tile, and metal. Concrete and stone offer a natural, rustic look, while tile provides a more polished and customizable option. Metal tabletops are often powder-coated for weather resistance and come in various colors and finishes. The best tabletops will be heat-resistant and easy to clean.

**Fuel Source:** Most round fire tables utilize either propane or natural gas as their fuel source. Propane models are typically more portable, as they can be connected to a standard propane tank. Natural gas models require a permanent connection to a natural gas line, but they offer a continuous fuel supply without the need for tank refills. Consider your specific needs and available gas connections when choosing a fuel source.

**Construction and Frame:** The construction and frame of the fire table determine its stability and longevity. Look for models with sturdy frames made from rust-proof materials like aluminum or steel. The frame should be able to withstand the elements and provide a stable base for the tabletop and burner system. Some models may also include adjustable feet for leveling on uneven surfaces.

**Safety Features:** Safety is paramount when dealing with open flames. The best round fire tables will incorporate multiple safety features, including flame failure devices, heat shields, and spark screens. Flame failure devices automatically shut off the gas supply if the flame is extinguished, preventing gas leaks. Heat shields protect the surrounding area from excessive heat, while spark screens prevent embers from escaping and causing fires.

**Aesthetics and Design:** Round fire tables come in a wide range of styles to complement any outdoor décor. From modern and minimalist designs to rustic and traditional styles, there's a fire table to suit every taste. Consider the overall aesthetic of your outdoor space and choose a fire table that enhances the existing décor. Some models may also include decorative elements like lava rocks, glass beads, or ceramic logs to enhance the ambiance.

## FAQs Section

**What size round fire table is best for my patio?**
The ideal size depends on the size of your patio and the number of people you typically entertain. A smaller patio may benefit from a 30-inch diameter table, while larger patios can accommodate 48-inch or larger tables. Consider the seating arrangement around the table and ensure there is enough space for people to move comfortably.

**Can I use a round fire table on a wooden deck?**
It depends on the specific fire table and the deck's construction. Always check the manufacturer's instructions and local building codes. Some fire tables are certified for use on wooden decks with proper heat shielding. It's also important to ensure that the deck is structurally sound and can support the weight of the fire table.

**How often should I clean my round fire table?**
Regular cleaning is essential to maintain the appearance and performance of your fire table. Clean the tabletop and burner area regularly with a mild soap and water solution. Remove any debris or buildup from the burner ports to ensure proper gas flow. Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for specific cleaning recommendations.

**What type of fuel is best for a round fire table?**
The best fuel depends on your preferences and available resources. Propane is more portable and convenient for those without a natural gas line. Natural gas provides a continuous fuel supply without the need for tank refills. Consider the cost of each fuel source and the convenience of refilling or connecting to a gas line.

1lg28to,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1lg28to/improving_effectiveness_of_vyvanse_caffeine/,Improving effectiveness of Vyvanse & Caffeine ☕️,"Hi there, I'm currently taking 70mg of Vyvanse. When it works, it’s genuinely life-changing, but I’ve noticed that some days each month it’s far less effective (the joys of fluctuating female hormones!).

I also drink a ridiculous amount of coffee on a daily basis, and I refuse to give it up. That said, I’ve started to worry about the long-term impact of combining two strong stimulants every day, so I’ve been doing some research to find a better balance.

Given that I could probably down an XL espresso and still take a 5-hour nap, I clearly have a high caffeine tolerance. I also suspect I metabolise ADHD meds quickly, as I noticed similar patterns when I was on Ritalin.

So here’s my idea: I’m thinking of taking Vyvanse every second day, avoiding a full withdrawal, and using those off-days to enjoy all the coffee I want. Then, on my Vyvanse days, I’d switch to decaf or weak tea. The aim is to help reduce my caffeine tolerance and possibly improve the effectiveness of both substances.

Has anyone tried this before and had success? I only started this week so it's too early to say but I will report back in a few days on how it's going, if anyone is interested ☺️

TLDR: I'm on 70mg of Vyvanse, but it's not always effective. I also drink a lot of coffee. I suspect I'm a fast metaboliser of ADHD meds, and I have a high tolerance to caffeine, so I’m experimenting with alternating Vyvanse and coffee days to reduce tolerance and increase effectiveness.",2,1750420942.0,VyvanseADHD,1,1.0,False

1lg26yi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lg26yi,Fraud and the ugly truth.,"First two screen shots are exactly 1 month apart. I noticed earlier last week that my replacement tool in app reverted from the 3 item scan back to the single scan/replace method. I checked for an update in the app store and my app is up to date. 

I hit 100 5 stars May 30th after fighting through the fraudsters and held it until a week ago when this revert happened. I get a random 3 star and a few days later a photo of a white persons hands next to some opened raspberries appeared in the damaged section of my profile. They said the raspberries were old. I know my work but I am not perfect so I did not question this.

The next day the photo and the damage report is removed from my account, but they left the 3 star. I assume the person probably did that more than once so they removed it idk why they did not flag the rating too.

The ugly truth is, no matter how much Instacart lies to you that they care for the shoppers they do not. Because why would they revert back to the old system where customers can easily commit fraud? Yesterday I did only two batches and of course I had 100% of everything un damaged and delivered more than 15 mins early. This person ordered four 32pack cases of water and some eggs and coffee creamer. The other person ordered batteries to a hotel. The battery customer, no problems and good/no rating. The water asshole (lives in wealthy condo 5th floor btw) says “Thank you” after I send delivery photo, waits until I get out of the building, reduces my $3 tip to $1 then gives a 1 star.

Y’all none of this shit matters, but it pisses me off just the same. I know these assholes want to believe they are above us and superior that’s why they can abuse us and the system of giving ratings. But like why the fuck y’all fraudsters do the extreme? A FUCKING 1 STAR HOMIE?! Diabolical. 

Another hard truth y’all don’t want to hear about is automated programs. I noticed in my area orders disappearing too fast to be humanly possible like way too fast. Fast like it does not fully hit the screen only a portion forms and blink it’s gone. I started searching the deep web and I found two functioning programs with active communities on a social site.

Not sure if I got used to her initial attachment and I became like her or its normal for people to change this much. 

These days it feels like I'm basically begging her to hangout with me.

Initial days she used to call me and ask me to hang out all the time. I kept my guard up since that was 1st month only. 
Fast forward to 4-5 months it feels like I'm begging her to hang out with me and she's finding each and every reason to avoid hanging out with me.

Eg: Couple of days back we came home and on the last day we were supposed to hangout a bit longer so I came early but she got into a meeting which is fine but laster she said, she went out for a coffee with her colleague later on which i don't care at all but when she came to pg we went out but within 5 mins she said she wanna take a nap and went back to her place.

It might sound childish but it was something we planned and it kinda hurts. Since going home we barely talked for 2-3 mins and she always initiates to cut the call and talk later and initial days we used to stay in video call for so much longer.

1lg25ok,https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/1lg25ok/you_never_know_who_you_will_meet_when_playing/,You never know who you will meet when playing chess in a local cafe,"So about a month ago, me and my buddy were playing chess in a local small cafe in Hong Kong Island (we are basically beginners with ratings like 400-600). At first, we were watching some youtube videos about chess and enoying our games. Then suddenly, a foreign, classy gentleman walked in and started a converseation with us asking if we enjoyed playing chess.

After a few chit chats with this gentleman, he noticed our board's position and started telling us about a story that he had once drawn a game with Mikhail Tal. At first we had no idea who he was talking about until we googled Mikhail's name and recognised his photo. He said the board's position (fyi we were playing Alien Gambit) remined him of Mikhail's aggressiveness and how he forced Mikhail to a draw position on the board before.

Unfortunatley, he was there to buy a cup of coffee and had to leave asap. We couldn't ask about his name or about the details of the game he played with Mikhail but he did motivate us to keep playing chess and most importantly, have fun!

From his words of choice, we could tell he is a very skilled player, or at least once was, but we couldn't figure out who this gentleman is. He said he had retired from professional chess for a while and is happy with his current life now. I guess the moral of this story is that when you got a chance to meet a skillful player, especially one who can draw with a World Champion, you should pick up your courage and ask for his name. Coz, what are the odds you can meet a player who can draw a game with 'The Magician from Riga' himeself right?

Man, if he saw this post, I wish he could tell us his name looool. Besides, he told us we should stick to one opening and avoid risky openings like the Alien Gambit, but seriously why so? To me, the alien gambit seems to be a very aggressive opening and I can checkmate my opponents with ease.

1lg23uh,https://www.reddit.com/r/GearUpGaming/comments/1lg23uh/rog_pelta_review_this_309g_wireless_beast_just/,ROG Pelta Review: This 309g Wireless Beast Just Changed My Gaming Setup (70HR Battery + Tri-Mode Magic),"Look, I've been through more **gaming headsets** than I care to admit. You know how it goes – you buy one, it breaks after six months, or the battery dies mid-clutch, or the mic makes you sound like you're talking through a tin can. But the **ASUS ROG Pelta wireless gaming headset**? This thing actually made me stop my endless headset shopping spree.

# Why the ROG Pelta Caught My Attention

Let me be real with you – when I first saw the specs, I thought ""here we go again, another overpromised piece of tech."" But then I noticed something: **309 grams**. That's lighter than my morning coffee mug! Most **wireless gaming headphones** feel like you're wearing a brick on your head after a few hours. The Pelta? I literally forgot I was wearing it during a 6-hour gaming marathon.

The **tri-mode connectivity** (Bluetooth, ROG SpeedNova 2.4GHz, and USB-C) means you're not stuck with one device. Switch from your PC to your phone to your **PS5** without missing a beat. Ever tried juggling multiple devices with a single-mode headset? It's like trying to text with oven mitts on :/

# ROG SpeedNova 2.4GHz: The Low-Latency Game Changer

Here's where things get interesting. ASUS didn't just slap on generic 2.4GHz wireless tech and call it a day. The **ROG SpeedNova** delivers **ultra-low latency** that actually matters in competitive gaming.

I tested this during some intense CS2 matches, and the difference is noticeable. No more ""I swear I heard that footstep a second ago"" moments. The audio sync is so tight, you'll start questioning if your old headset was even trying.

**What makes ROG SpeedNova special:**

* **Sub-20ms latency** (that's faster than most wired headsets, FYI)
* **Interference-resistant** – no more crackling when your neighbor's using their microwave
* **Instant device switching** – seriously, it's like magic

[Check out the ROG Pelta on Amazon](https://amzn.to/4n5bu3X)

# 50mm Titanium Drivers: The Sound That Actually Delivers

Remember when marketing teams discovered the word ""titanium"" and started putting it on everything? Well, ASUS actually uses it properly. These **50mm titanium drivers** aren't just bigger – they're engineered for gaming.

The **sound quality** hits different. Explosions have weight, footsteps have direction, and music doesn't sound like it's coming through a gaming headset (which, let's be honest, is usually a compliment). The frequency response is tuned for gaming but doesn't completely murder your music experience.

**Audio performance highlights:**

* **Wide soundstage** – you can actually pinpoint enemy locations
* **Punchy bass** without drowning out the mids
* **Clear highs** that don't pierce your eardrums
* **Balanced EQ** that works for both gaming and music

# 10mm Super-Wideband Microphone: Finally, A Mic That Doesn't Suck

Can we talk about how most **gaming headset microphones** sound like they were recorded in a bathroom? The Pelta's **10mm super-wideband mic** is a breath of fresh air. Your teammates will actually understand what you're saying without asking you to repeat yourself every five seconds.

The **noise cancellation** is solid – it filters out keyboard clacking, fan noise, and that random dog barking outside. Plus, it's detachable, so you don't look like a call center employee when you're just listening to music.

**Microphone features:**

* **Crystal clear voice pickup**
* **Background noise suppression**
* **Detachable design** for versatility
* **Flexible positioning** for optimal pickup

# RGB Lighting: Because Why Not Look Cool?

Look, I know RGB isn't everyone's thing, but the **RGB lighting** on the Pelta is actually tasteful. It's not trying to blind NASA satellites from orbit – just enough to match your setup without being obnoxious.

The lighting zones are well-placed and the effects are smooth. You can customize everything through the ASUS Armoury Crate software, or just turn it off if you're not feeling the gamer aesthetic that day.

# 70-Hour Battery Life: The Marathon Champion

This is where the Pelta absolutely destroys the competition. **70 hours of battery life**. Seventy. Hours. That's nearly three days of continuous use. I've been using it for two weeks and I've charged it exactly once.

Compare that to other **wireless gaming headsets** that tap out after 12-20 hours, and you'll understand why this is such a big deal. No more ""low battery"" warnings during crucial moments. No more keeping a charging cable on your desk like some kind of electronic life support.

**Battery performance:**

* **Up to 70 hours** of wireless gaming
* **Fast charging** – quick top-ups when needed
* **Battery indicator** – always know where you stand
* **USB-C charging** – no proprietary cables

# Cross-Platform Compatibility: The Universal Soldier

Whether you're on **PC**, **Nintendo Switch**, **PS5**, or even your phone, the Pelta plays nice with everything. The **tri-mode connectivity** means you're not locked into one ecosystem.

Gaming on PC? Use the 2.4GHz dongle for optimal performance. Want to listen to Spotify on your phone? Bluetooth has you covered. Need to chat with friends on Discord while gaming on console? The Pelta handles it all.

**Supported platforms:**

* **PC** (Windows/Mac/Linux)
* **PlayStation 5**
* **Nintendo Switch**
* **Mobile devices** (iOS/Android)
* **Xbox Series X/S** (via USB-C)

# Comfort: The 309g Advantage

Let's address the elephant in the room – comfort. At just **309 grams**, the Pelta is significantly lighter than most wireless gaming headsets. The **memory foam ear cushions** are soft without being squishy, and the headband distributes weight evenly.

I've worn this thing for 8+ hour sessions without the dreaded ""headset fatigue."" You know that feeling when your ears start to hurt and your head feels compressed? Yeah, that doesn't happen with the Pelta.

**Comfort features:**

* **Lightweight 309g design**
* **Memory foam ear cushions**
* **Adjustable headband**
* **Breathable materials**
* **Minimal clamping force**

# The Verdict: Worth Your Hard-Earned Cash?

IMO, the **ASUS ROG Pelta** is one of the best **wireless gaming headsets** you can buy right now. It's not the cheapest option, but it delivers on every promise. The combination of **low-latency wireless**, **excellent battery life**, **solid audio quality**, and **genuine comfort** makes it a winner.

Is it perfect? Nothing is. The RGB might not be everyone's cup of tea, and audiophiles might want something more specialized for music. But as an all-around **gaming headphone** that handles everything from competitive FPS to casual streaming, it's hard to beat.

**Final thoughts:**

* **Battery life** is genuinely game-changing
* **Comfort** for long gaming sessions
* **Audio quality** that works for gaming and music
* **Connectivity options** that actually make sense
* **Build quality** that feels premium

The ROG Pelta isn't just another gaming headset – it's the one that finally made me stop looking for the ""perfect"" headset. Sometimes the best tech is the one that just works, and works well.

Ready to upgrade your audio game? The Pelta might just be the last **wireless gaming headset** you'll need to buy for a while.

This might sound a bit random, but I figured I’d just put it out there. I’m someone who recently completed the IFIC certification and am trying to get my foot in the door in the finance world. It hasn’t been the easiest journey, and to be honest, it can feel pretty lonely at times. I don’t really have friends in this field, and I deeply believe in the saying: “You become who you surround yourself with.”

So… I’m reaching out to see if there are others here in Calgary who are in the same boat — maybe also IFIC/CSC certified or actively working toward a finance career — who’d be open to connecting?

I’d love to casually meet up, maybe this Saturday evening, grab a coffee or something chill, and just talk finance, job search struggles, market ideas, or even just hang out. Nothing formal — just a space to support and motivate each other, and hopefully build some lasting friendships along the way.

“And last, but not least, this year’s Academic Excellence Award winner, Layla Kincaid!”

I step onto the stage & accept my award and graduation certificate from Mr. Anderson, our Principal.

As I’m standing next to him to have my picture taken, my eyes slip across the crowd, looking for my mother’s auburn head of hair just to come up short. I honestly don’t know why I expected anything different.

In the last six months she has become distant, she’s never home and when she is home, she can barely deign to say a handful of words to me.

It’s because she’s met a new man, but I can’t help but feel that there is something else that I’m missing.

After the crowd cheers and claps, we all scatter through the crowd looking for our friends and family.

Becca, my best friend since kindergarten, comes hurtling towards me with a huge smile on her face, her arms spread wide.

“We’ve finally done it!” she screams in my face just before she jumps into my arms. I can’t help but smile at her.

In relation to my 5 foot 8 inch stature, her 5 foot 1 inch is basically miniature. The fact that I’m voluptuous and thick and she’s slim and lean, does not help our size differences in the slightest. But we wouldn’t want it any other way.

I lock eyes with her parents, Mr. & Mrs. Montgomery, over her shoulder and they both have huge, proud smiles on their faces.

Since day one, they welcomed me into their home and treated me like an adoptive daughter. Mrs. Montgomery is the one who taught me how to create mouthwatering dishes, bake amazing cookies and cakes, and even how to balance a household budget. Mr. Montgomery is the one who taught me how to change a tire, fix a lightbulb, hang a shelf, and even knot a tie (just in case).

“Your mom probably got stuck at work.” Mrs. Montgomery whispers in my ear when she leans in to hug me. I appreciate the sentiment but we both know that’s not the real reason she is not here.

We all pile into the Montgomery’s car and head to the local seafood restaurant that is known for its amazing dishes and superb service – Mr. and Mrs. Montgomery’s treat for our special day.

We are at the restaurant and as we wait to be attended to by the hostess, my eyes scan across the space to take in its amazing décor and atmosphere as I’ve personally never been here before.

My eyes catch onto a pair of stunning green ones that are staring right back at me. My breath catches and my heart skips a beat when the force of our stare hits me like a battering ram. What in the ever-loving-skittles is that?

As I come back to my senses, other features come to my attention: a strong jawline that could cut diamonds, golden flawless skin, dark brown (almost black) curly hair that is cropped closely on the sides but longish on top (perfect for my fingers to glide through and grab on to), a tall muscular figure that gives off swimmer vibes and a sinful mouth that is currently tipped upwards into the most delicious, panty-melting smirk. Oh my!

Becca tugs on my arm to get my attention so I can follow them to our table. I glance back one last time but he has slipped away. It might be for the best; I can’t afford any right now.

Our server comes over and introduces herself as Meghan takes our drinks orders, and hurries away to give us a few minutes to peruse the menu.

I hear Becca and her parents discussing the various menu options but I’m not giving my full attention to what’s going on around me; my mind drifting towards my mom’s MIA status, my disappointment in myself for expecting anything different, and a certain pair of green eyes.

My Shirley Temple is placed in front of me and as I go to that Meghan, my words get caught in my throat when I realize it’s green-eyes standing next to me with a decadent smile on his face.

“Hi, my name is Hunter, I’ll be taking over from Meghan. She had to step out for a family emergency. I hope that is okay with you lovely folks?” he says to the whole table, but his gaze lands on me at the end of his sentence. I’m so flustered I can feel a blush creeping up my neck and I dip my head to hide it from him. What is wrong with me? I’m never this nervous around guys!

Mr. and Mrs. Montgomery each order the fish-of-the-day special, Becca orders the paella but I’m stuck between the seafood chowder and the creamy linguine with prawns. Hunter steps up closer to me, leans down a fraction, and asks: “And what can I get you, beautiful?”

I glance up at him, blushing *again*, but able to find my voice, even if it sounds a bit scratchy. Am I thirsty? “What would you recommend? The seafood chowder or the linguine with prawns?”

He peers down at me, drops his voice a fraction so only I can hear him, and says: “What I would like, is not on the menu.” With that, he subtly winks at me and I’m at a loss for words. Did a fire break out in the kitchen? Why is it so hot in here all of a sudden? Does someone need to call the fire department?

I clear my throat, take a sip of my drink to give me a few extra seconds to rearrange my thoughts, and only then peer up at him through my lashes. “I’ll take the chowder, please.”

He scribbles my order down, tips an imaginary hat in our direction, and then saunters off towards the kitchen.

When I lift my head a couple of seconds later it is to Becca looking at me with a smirk on her face and an evil glint in her eyes. I know that look, it doesn't bode well for me. Urgh!

As we wait for our food to arrive, I excuse myself to run to the restroom quickly. I go inside, finish up in the nearest stall, and then stand at the sink to wash my hands and splash cold water on my neck and wrists. I need to get my composure back. I need my head in the game.

Once I’m calmed down, I exit the restrooms, and as I’m rounding the corner into the corridor that leads to the restaurant, I crash into a wall that wasn’t there 10 minutes ago. Strong hands grab my upper arms to steady me and the intoxicating smell of cinnamon and vanilla assaults my senses.

“Woah there, beautiful.”

“I’m so sorry, I wasn’t watching where I was going, obviously.” Somewhere during the moment he caught me and our verbal exchange, my hands reached out and grasped onto his midsection. I can feel his taught muscles underneath my fingertips, and I have an instinctual urge to run my hands up his stomach, over his shoulders, and into his hair. Bad Layla!

Hunter stares into my eyes for a second, dips his head lower and whispers next to my ear: “You won’t hear me complaining. Feel free to bump into me anytime you want.”

I feel his breath against my skin just below my ear and I sigh inwardly. If I cant my head just a fraction to the side, he would have the perfect angle to run his nose along my neck, lick just behind my ear, and nip at my earlobe.

Instead, my fingertips tighten a fraction just before I step back and create some much-needed space between us.

“Thanks for catching me but I need to get back to the table.” I step around him to leave and as I pass him, his fingers brush against the back of my hand, tingles immediately run up my hand and straight to my heart, making me suck in a breath. When I’m three steps away from him, I peer back over my shoulder and find him rooted to the spot, eyes somewhat larger due to shock. I think he might be just as surprised by that touch as I was. Here’s hoping!

The rest of our meal goes by without a hitch except for the times that Hunter comes by our table to drop something off or collect some of our dirty dishes. I blush every time and he finds a reason to touch me surreptitiously every time.

Our fingers touch when I hand him my empty plate, him stroking his fingers over my shoulder blades when he passes at the back of my chair. Each time it’s as electrifying as the first time.

As Mr. Montgomery pays the bill, we stand to slip our jackets on. Hunter is there to offer me his hand as I go to rise from the table.

I take his hand and as my fingers carefully slip into his, I feel a small piece of paper being slipped to me. He smiles sheepishly at me before releasing my hand and turning towards Becca and Mrs. Montgomery to help them up as well.

We step outside and Becca is on me in a millisecond, squeezing my bicep and smiling at me like a loon. She didn’t miss the exchange between me and Hunter. I definitely will be getting the third degree when we get home. Yay me!

  
6 weeks later

I’m behind the counter at Beantree, serving a customer and listening to our manager speaking to the owner on the phone.



We’ve finally been given the go-ahead to advertise for another barista to help out around here! Tessa hangs up and saunters over to me with a huge smile, giving me a thumbs up. We have been begging the owner for another set of hands around here since four weeks ago.



I originally would have spent my summer vacation relaxing, soaking up the sun, and enjoying being carefree before I started university in the fall.



That dream imploded the day I asked my mom to transfer my college fund to the university to cover my tuition, room and board for the first year. The college fund that my dad left me after he passed away.



Originally, she hedged for a few days about needing to go see the bank manager to release the funds, but after a massive argument between us, she admitted to squandering the money away on gambling, new clothes, and her new beau’s company as an investment.



I was livid! It was too late to apply for a scholarship, so I had to place my dreams of starting my new future on hold, indefinitely.



That’s how I ended up here, at Beantree, being a barista so I can start saving up money to hopefully start studying next year.



Don’t get me wrong, I love working here. Tessa is amazing, the customers are really nice and patient when it comes to the lunchtime rush and the employee discount is a major bonus when it comes to getting my caffeine fix.



Once there is a lull in the shop, Tessa steps to the back to print up an ad to place in the shop window for the new barista position. Bradley, one of our regulars, saunters in and I start ringing up his regular – double cappuccino and a banana bran muffin. He smiles at me when I give him his total before he even has the chance to say anything.



“You are amazing. If I was 30 years younger, I would have locked you down as my sweetheart as soon as you smiled at me the first time.”



I smile at Bradley, lean over to him, and stage-whisper “And I would have let you” before I give him an exaggerated wink. His smile grows 3 times and I know both our days have been made.



A couple of days later, Tessa is in the back interviewing potential new baristas when the bell over the door chimes as a new customer enters.



I lift my head with my customer service smile in place when I lock eyes with a blonde adonis with the most light-blue eyes I’ve ever seen. He gives me a shy smile as he steps up to the counter and I have to swallow twice before I get my voice to work.



“Welcome to Beantree, what can I get for you today?”



“Hi, are you Tessa?”



“No, sorry. Are you here to interview for the new barista job?” All candidates were asked to come in today so it’s a logical deduction to make.



“Yes, I’m Cade, pleased to meet you.” He extends his hand and I do the same. “Layla, welcome. Tessa should almost be done and then it is your turn.”



“Any advice to make sure I get the job” he asks, and I realize he hasn’t dropped my hand yet. I can’t say that I mind in the slightest.



“Let me think…a chai latte and a double choc chip brownie will definitely put you ahead of the pack.” I wink at him and a slight blush creep across his cheeks. He is adorable. Can I take him home? Down Layla!



“Well then, ring those up for me and whatever is your favorite, I need to make sure I’m in your good books as well.” He smiles sweetly at me, and I can’t seem to stop my lips from drawing up as well.



“Why’s that?” I ask as I’m getting his (or should I say Tessa’s) order ready.



“I’m hoping you’ll teach me the ropes around here if I get the job.”



“Not if, when. I’ll make sure to put in a good word for you with Tessa.”



He looks at me aghast and I can’t help but giggle. I don’t giggle, get it together Layla!



“Why would you do that?” Cade asks and it seems he’s having trouble understanding why a total stranger would help him out.



“Because I have a gut feeling about you and I’ve learned to trust my gut. And the older ladies would love some eye candy around here.” I wink at him while sliding his items over the counter towards him.



Cade breaks out into a full-blown smile, and it totally transforms his face, he should definitely smile more!



Soon Tessa appears and escorts the previous candidate out. I catch her attention and introduce her to Cade.



“I have it on good authority that these are your favorite,” he says as he hands Tessa her latte and brownie.



Her eyes almost bug out of her head, and she smiles from ear to ear.



“Oh, I like him already!” She shows him to the back and I turn my attention back to the customers.



Unfortunately, it gets busy quickly, and I don’t get the chance to say goodbye to Cade when he’s done with Tessa. Hopefully, he gets the job, and I’ll get to see him again.



As the day winds down, Tessa and I don’t get a chance to chat much about all the candidates she interviewed but I wasn’t lying to Cade, I’ll certainly try to put in a good word on his behalf.



Just before closing time my alarm on my phone goes off and I remember that my art class at the local community college starts tonight. I’ll be going twice a week during the summer.



I would have chosen art as a minor when I started at university but due to certain selfish people, those plans are on hold. That does not mean I have to tank all my plans just yet.



Art has always been a passion of mine. I am no Picasso but being able to get lost while I’m drawing or even painting brings me a certain type of peacefulness that I’ve not been able to replicate in any other way.



It started when I was six years old, and it was one of the many things I shared with my dad. We could spend hours at a time, laying in the backyard, drawing the most mundane things – a ladybug sitting on a petal, drops of dew on a spider’s web. Those were some of my happiest times.



Dad and I shared a kinship that Mom never could (or should I say would) understand. To her, we were wasting time. In actuality, she was more upset about the fact that Dad would not spend all his time on her. She always was someone that needed everyone’s attention to be on her, all the time.



As I’m locking up in front, Tessa is cashing up. I peer at her over my shoulder before I decide to bring up the new barista position.



“So, any idea on who you might be recommending to the owner for the position?” I honestly try to be nonchalant about it, but Tessa sees through me quicker than water running through a sieve.



“Why? Is there anyone in particular that you think might fit the bill?” she smirks at me and I stick my tongue out at her.



“Cade seemed nice…” I trail off, not wanting to come off as too pushy or opinionated.



Tessa gives a loud guffaw and I know my attempt at subtlety failed, ginormously.



“You know, he asked me about you when our interview was over.”



“What? What did you say?” There’s no need for me to be coy about it anymore. It’s clear as daylight that I like the guy.



“He asked if you were single.”



I can practically feel my face splitting in half with the smile that pops up.



Tessa knows that I’m very hesitant when it comes to guys. Yes, I might like Cade but that does not mean I’ll be throwing myself at him the first chance I get. That moment with Hunter a few weeks ago was a fluke in and of itself.



The next morning, I walk into the coffee shop to see a set of bright blues smiling at me from behind the counter – Cade got the job!



The next couple of weeks go by quite uneventfully but Cade is becoming a constant in my day-to-day life. It’s small little things that make me like him more, each day.



He opens the door for me when I arrive in the morning, walks me to my car at night when our shift is over, holds the door for me when I enter or leave a room, and small smiles when we catch each other’s eye across the room.



He’s not pushy or overconfident. He’s just a constant reminder that there still are good, gentlemanly guys out there.

  
At the end of July, I received a text from my mom. I’ve dreaded it and awaited this message in equal parts.

* Mom: Michael and I are getting married. \*

I can’t say things have been tense at home because that would require us to interact with each other. That’s not possible when she’s never at home. I don’t know exactly where she goes, most likely spending all her time with Michael, her new beau.

He is some kind of bigwig lawyer downtown with more money than Midas himself.

* Me: Congratulations. \*
* Mom: We will be moving in with him and Xavier after the wedding. \*

Excuse you! And who the hell is Xavier?

Do I look like some piece of furniture she can just cart around from home to home as she fits?

The sad truth is though, I’ll most likely have no other choice.

Due to her selfishness in squandering my college fund, I don’t have the finances to get my own place at this stage.

I would love to! Having my own space, my own independence. She has basically checked out when it comes to being a mom, so it won’t make much of a difference if I do.

Cade walks into the breakroom while I’m pondering on my reply to my mom and immediately sees something is bugging me.

“What’s wrong? Who do I need to fight?”

His offer makes me smile at him slightly. “My mom, as per usual, has decided to throw a giant-sized turd in my pathway.”

He grimaces, stands closer, and bumps his shoulder into me. “No matter what, I know you’re strong enough to get through this. And even if you’re not, I’m willing to run away with you to Vegas.”

I laugh at that, and he gives me a panty-melting smile in return.

He always has this uncanny way of knowing how to cheer me up in the simplest of ways.

“Thank you, I needed that.” I lean over to lay my head on his shoulder. I stiffen and start to pull away. I’m not sure what compelled me but, at that moment, I just felt safe enough with him to let my guard down.

He doesn’t let me get far though, placing his arm around my shoulders and hugging me to him. He whispers against my hair, “Always.”

We sit like that for a couple of minutes longer before my phone alerts me that my break is over. I pull away slowly, peering at him as I do and notice that he has this soft look in his eyes, a slight smile tipping the corners of his mouth.

By the end of our shift, Cade walks me to my car as usual. As he goes to pull my door open for me, he abruptly stops, gently spinning me around and pinning me to the side of my car with his hands on either side of my shoulders.

“Would you, by any chance, be willing to give me your number?” he’s leaning forward ever so slightly, making me inhale his unique scent of sandalwood and freshly cut grass. I’ve noticed it wafting around the coffee shop but being this close to it makes my head spin in the most delicious of ways.

“And what, pray tell, would you like to do with my number?” I decide to go with coy yet flirty, just to see if I’m not reading the situation incorrectly.

His eyes jump from my left eye to my right, down to my mouth, and back up to my eyes again. “I would like to be the first person of the day to tell you good morning and the last person at night to tell you to sleep well.”

Well then, there goes my heart, skipping down fairytale lane.

“With an offer like that, who am I to deny you your request.” I pull out my phone from my back pocket and hand it to him so he can put in his number. A couple of seconds later I hear his phone chime in his pocket, signaling that he sent himself a message from my phone. Presumptuous, but oh so sexy!

He leans in, places a chaste kiss on my cheek and whispers, “May all your dreams tonight be as beautiful as you are.”

He abruptly steps away from me and saunters towards his car, a couple of parking spots down from me. I’m rooted to the spot, still staring at him when he opens his door, looks over his shoulder and winks at me.

He doesn’t drive off though, making sure I safely get in my car as soon as I remember how to breathe normally and only then starts his car, trailing me out of the parking lot. Holy mother of Skittles, this man is going to be the death of me!

As I am nearing home that night, there is a U-Haul truck in our driveway, the back is open, and it’s filled with several boxes. I find mom in the living room stuffing books, picture frames and other knickknacks into a box.

“What’s going on?”

“I told you; we’re moving in with Michael.” Mom rolls her eyes at me as if I’m asking dumb questions.

“I know, but you said it was after the wedding only.” I plant my feet and cross my arms, narrowing my eyes at her.

“The plans changed. The house has been put up for sale and we need to be out of here as soon as possible.” She refuses to look at me, turning her back on me while picking up candles on the mantlepiece.

“Bullshit! I inherited half of the house when Dad passed away, I did not give my consent to put the house up for sale!” I am livid and can barely keep my voice steady.

“Until you are 18, I oversee your portion of the inheritance. And as you know, that is not until next month. So go upstairs and pack your stuff, I refuse to hear anything further on the subject.”

I have had enough of my mom’s high-handedness and dictatorship when it suits her. Recently she basically has been AWOL as a parent and now suddenly, when it is to her advantage, she wants to act all authoritarian. No! I am done pandering to her!

“No, I won’t. I’m staying here until the very last possible moment. This has been my home for the last 18 years. I won’t allow you to just diminish my memories and moments that I shared with Dad like that. Move if you want, but I’m staying until the day of the wedding.”

She glares at me, opening her mouth as if to spill more of her bullshit commands. Ultimately, she reconsiders, but only slightly.

“Fine, stay. But don’t expect me to keep paying for the utilities around here. You want to act all high and mighty, thinking you’re miss independent. Let’s see if you can cope in the real world.” She turns around and stomps off towards her bedroom, slamming the door in her wake.

Well shit, that went well. Unfortunately, the joke is on her. In the last 2 months, I’m the one that has been paying for the utilities and groceries around here. She conveniently *forgot* during one of her gambling binges and if I wanted to have hot water and electricity to make dinner, I had to step up and become an adult earlier than under normal circumstances.

It’s not too long after our spat that I hear the truck being pulled out of the driveway with her disappearing into the night. Good riddance!

As I’m enjoying my homemade lasagna and sketching at the kitchen counter, my phone chimes unexpectedly.

What? Why? How?” They just come up with the most insane, unimaginable, ridiculously random things that have no rhyme or reason behind it. Mostly my daughter (but her twin brother sometimes helps). The god of chaos recently put up an aspirational poster of her in their room with hopes that one day he could be like that.

My favorite one: I have the entire house childproofed. Kids have an entire room of toys. At 2yo she takes a plastic spoon, digs a hole in the wall right next to the outlet exposing the wires! I just grab a drink and she goes trying to get electrocuted. No idea why she was even interested in that area, we’ve never used it.


My favorite series (all within 30 min): after work, we’re cuddling and on iPads as she gets sleepy, all of a sudden jumps up like she was struck by lightening, runs to the coffee table to smack my wine glass clear across the room. Like 10ft. I hadn’t even had a sip yet. I’m cleaning up glass, give her snacks to distract her.

She dumps the snacks on the floor. While I’m cleaning she builds a series of steps to get to the locked isopropyl, hoses down the entire coffee table, permanently ruining it. 

I go pee, she comes in, closes the door, turns off the lights, turns on the bidet which blasts me in the chest. I’m completely confused because it’s pitch black and I’m peeing but somehow liquid is coming back at me. I didn’t even know bidets shot that far, how she knew how to use it, or see the buttons. I shower, to after being greeted by every box of toys dumped everywhere, thrown across 3 rooms. 

All while giggling. I feel like God Almighty is going “Jesus Christ!! Yo wtf did I create!?” Lmao.

My wife comes back home like “uuhhh, what the heck happened over here?”

What are the best random shenanigans y’alls kids have done?",2,1750419605.0,Parenting,1,1.0,False

1lg1sb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1lg1sb7/my_husband_wants_an_open_marriage_novel_link/,My Husband Wants An Open Marriage Novel Link,"My husband, Ryan, is standing on the karaoke stage, making a fool of himself. His shirt is unbuttoned halfway, his tie long abandoned, and his cheeks are flushed from too much whiskey.

“And I………will always love you…..” he sings, closing his eyes.

His voice is terrible.

Standing next to him, practically glued to his side, is his secretary, Emily. Her left arm is around Ryan's waist, her fingers lightly grazing his back as she sings along. She’s younger than me, at least by half a decade, all wide eyes and perfect curves, dressed in a tight, low-cut dress that makes it impossible to ignore her presence. She leans into Ryan, whispering something in his ear, and he throws his head back, laughing. He looks at her like she’s the funniest person in the world.

I’ve never seen him this happy.

The last time I saw him this happy was on our wedding day, seven years ago. Back then, his eyes sparkled when he looked at me. Now, the light in them has grown dimmer; they're shining for someone else.

Around me, everyone is laughing. It’s the company’s quarterly review party, and the employees are loose after a few too many drinks, finding Ryan and Emily’s performance hilarious. But I know what they’re really laughing at. They’re laughing at me. The CEO’s wife, sitting here while her husband practically gropes his secretary in front of everyone. The whispers, the side glances, they don’t even try to hide it.

“Do you think they’re going to kiss?” someone whispers behind me.

“Definitely. Bet they’ll be doing more than kissing after this,” someone else replies, and they both chuckle.

I turn around to look at the people talking. Young, drunk, probably high on weed too. They must be interns. Only people with zero knowledge of the company’s hierarchy would make such a statement close to their employer’s wife.

Or maybe they just don’t care.

The girl, with messy blonde hair and red cheeks, locks eyes with me. “Hi!” she says, a little too loud. “Do you work here?”

Do I work here? My eyes narrow. She's definitely an intern.

She’s pretty, the kind of pretty that comes with youth and arrogance. The boy next to her drapes his arm lazily over her shoulders.

I don’t respond. I just stare at them, cold and unblinking.

Before I can say something that would make them regret their existence, I hear my name called.

“Julie!” the voice says, drawing my attention.

Even before I turn, I know who it is. Samantha, the vice president of marketing. We both work for Paragon Jewels, Ryan’s company, the leading manufacturer of luxury jewelry in North America. Her position is just below mine, so she’s one of the few who calls out my name like we’re friends, even though we’re not.

“Samantha,” I reply, forcing a polite smile.

“I didn’t know you were here, Julie. I was just telling the marketing team we have to get you involved more!”

“Oh?” I say. “Why’s that?”

“Well, you’re the head of marketing, and everyone wants to meet you! You’re so hard to catch these days. And besides, we never get a chance to chat at work,” she says, with an overplayed wink.

Her gaze drifts to the stage where Ryan and Emily are swaying together, sharing the mic, laughing like they’re on some private date instead of a work event.

“So, Mrs. O’Brien,” she says, smirking, “how are you enjoying the show so far?”

She's mocking me. The fucking bitch.

I force a bright smile. “Oh, it’s… fantastic,” I say, struggling to keep a straight face. “I’m thrilled to see my husband’s hard work is being rewarded with such… dedication from his staff.”

The crowd is clapping now, giving Ryan and his secretary a standing ovation. I guess they're done with their nonsense.

But then Ryan speaks into the microphone. “Before we get down, we’ve got one more song for you!”

More applause. More laughter. And I just want the ground to open up and swallow me.

Samantha looks at me with pity in her eyes. “Well… umm,” she says. “I’ll catch up with you later.”

She quickly excuses herself.

Behind me, I hear those interns whispering again. “Oh, my God. Did you hear what she said? That's Mrs. O’Brien.”

I turn to glare at them one last time, and the boy shifts uncomfortably, pulling the girl to her feet. “Let’s go,” he mutters under his breath, and they stumble away, sneaking a look at me before disappearing into the crowd.

Good. Let them run.

I turn back to the stage, my heart pounding in my chest. Ryan is singing “Everything I Do”—if you can call that singing. Emily is now pressed against him, her hand running up his arm in a way that makes my stomach twist. She’s completely shameless, and he’s too drunk to even notice—or worse, he doesn’t care.

I can’t take it anymore.

Without thinking, I push my chair back and stand. My heels click against the floor as I march toward the stage. I can feel the weight of everyone’s eyes on me, the whispers dying down as they realize what’s happening. They’ve been waiting for this—waiting to see if I’ll crack.

But I don’t care. I’m done playing the perfect wife.

I climb the steps to the stage, each footstep feeling heavier than the last. Ryan doesn’t notice me at first, too lost in his drunken performance, but Emily spots me and her smile falters. Good.

“Ryan,” I say. “We’re leaving now.”

Ryan looks at me, surprised. “Why?” he slurs, still holding the microphone. “The party's just getting started.”

I grit my teeth, my fists clenched. “Let’s go. Now.”

“Julie, come on,” he says, sounding annoyed now, as if I’m the one ruining his night.

I can’t help it. Something inside me snaps.

Without another word, I turn and walk toward the back of the stage. The technical operators sitting in the booth look up as I approach, their faces going pale.

“Who’s in charge here?” I ask.

They all point to a man standing near the soundboard, holding a half-eaten donut. His eyes widen as he sees me.

“Mrs. O’Brien,” he stammers, quickly setting the donut aside. “Is there something—uh—something I can do for you?”

“Shut it down. All of it,” I say. “The party’s over.”

He blinks, not sure if I’m serious, but one look at my face and he scrambles to obey. His hands fly across the controls, and within seconds, the speakers cut out with a harsh screech. The lights dim. The music dies. Silence falls over the room like a heavy curtain, and all that’s left is the sound of my heels as I walk back to center stage.

Ryan is standing there, his microphone useless in his hand.

“Julie, what the hell?” Ryan mutters.

I meet his eyes, feeling the weight of everything I’ve been holding in for too long. “You’ve had your fun,” I say quietly, but with enough steel in my voice that it stops him from saying anything else. “Now it’s over.”

I don’t wait for a reply. I grab his arm and start leading him down the stairs.

Ryan stumbles slightly, caught off guard by my sudden forcefulness. His eyes flick to the crowd, scanning their faces for something, maybe support, validation, but all he finds are wide eyes and muted whispers. Everyone’s too shocked, too entertained by the unfolding drama, to come to his defense.

The whispers start immediately. I hear snatches of conversation as we pass. Let them talk. Let them laugh.

Ryan's too drunk to fight me, too embarrassed to protest. For once, he’s the one who’s quiet, and I’m the one in control.

Justin, Ryan’s bodyguard/chauffeur, sees us coming and is already moving into action. He steps forward, opening the back door of the car without a word.

Ryan mumbles something under his breath—maybe an apology, maybe an excuse—but I don’t stop. I don’t even look at him. I tighten my grip, forcing him into the backseat with a firm push, and he collapses into the car.

“Take us home,” I say, climbing in behind Ryan. Then I slam the door shut.

  
It’s true what they say about marriage: one partner is always happier than the other.

In my case, I’m the unhappy one.

I’m the one who can’t sleep. I’m the one who watches her husband’s sleeping face at night, looking for a sign—anything to prove what I’ve suspected all along, that he’s cheating on me. Just say a word, goddammit, a name, something, dear God. That’s all I want. Say Emily, Ryan. Say Emily.

But Ryan never does. He’s too controlled for that.

I’m the one checking his phone, seeing notifications from the same person, the same tiny image. But I can’t see the name of the sender, can’t recognize the face due to the image size—though it looks like Emily. I can’t even read the messages because Ryan has privatized his pop-up notifications.

I’m in the kitchen right now, already on my fifth cup of coffee. And it’s just 6 AM.

“Morning,” Ryan says, walking in, rubbing his temple. “Feels like someone took a chainsaw to my head. Last night was fun.”

“I’m glad you had fun,” I reply, trying to keep my voice steady, but the bitterness slips through. He notices it, of course. He always does.

“Something wrong?” Ryan asks, eyeing me cautiously.

“Wrong?”

“You seem… I don’t know, off.”

I’m counting down from ten in my head. Calm down, Julie. Calm the hell down. But how can I? Ryan disgraced me last night, and he doesn’t even remember?

“I’m fine,” I say.

Ryan fetches himself a cup of coffee and joins me at the table. He’s watching me with that innocent look of his.

Sometimes I forget how handsome he is. With his lovely, sharp jawline and his bright green eyes. The eyes were the first thing I fell in love with. We were freshmen in college, and Ryan mistook me for some girl he brought to the frat party, a girl he swore was his girlfriend. And well, I played along. I enjoyed playing the part, letting him call me Vivian. And in the morning, when he was sober again and didn’t recognize me, I told him Vivian no longer wanted him and I did.

Funny how things turn out.

“You say you’re fine,” Ryan says, breaking the silence, “but you keep looking at me like you want to murder me.”

I grip the edge of the table, my nails digging into the wood. “You humiliated me last night, Ryan. How is anyone supposed to respect me when my own husband doesn’t?”

“What are you talking about?”

“I’m talking about your stupid karaoke performance yesterday with that bitch, Emily.”

Ryan slaps his forehead dramatically. “Oh, not this again. I’ve told you a hundred times, Julie, there’s nothing to worry about. You always bring her up, like you’re obsessed or something.”

“Obsessed?”

I want to throw my coffee cup at something, and it definitely isn’t the wall.

“You have a life most women would kill for,” he continues. “A great job, a husband who comes home every night. Do you know how many women throw themselves at me? And yet, I come home to you. I pay your family’s bills. I’ve set up trust funds for your nieces and nephews. But it’s never enough, is it? You’re always whining about the same thing—Emily this, Emily that. It’s exhausting.”

I’m shaking now, my heart pounding so hard I can barely breathe. But if I say anything more, he’ll call my mother again, and she’ll tell me I’m being ungrateful. “Stop trying to push Ryan into divorcing you, Julie,” she’ll say. “No one wants hand-me-downs. Do you want to be alone forever? Go on your knees and tell Ryan you’re sorry for being a bitch.”

“How would you like me to show my gratitude, my lord?” I say, glaring at Ryan. “Should I commission a carven image of you and worship it?”

“I’m not in the mood for your sarcasm, Julie. My head is already pounding enough.” Then something crosses his eyes, a strange look. “Actually, there’s something I’ve been meaning to discuss with you. I feel like now’s the right time.”

Oh, God. My stomach tightens. He’s going to ask for a divorce. I can feel it. Mom’s going to kill me. She already planned a vacation in Rio in December.

“What is it?” I ask, bracing myself.

“I want an open marriage.”

For a moment, the words don’t register. “What?” I say.

“That’s when a couple decides to give each other room to see other people, and—”

“I know what an open marriage means, Ryan. Jesus Christ. The answer is no.”

He looks at me with disdain. “I wasn’t asking. From now on, we’re in an open marriage. When you see me with someone else, don’t bother asking questions.”

My heart slams in my chest. “It’s only an open marriage if I agree. And I don’t.”

I’m on my feet now, pacing the kitchen, trying to contain the rage and hurt boiling inside me. Seven years of marriage, and I’m already gearing close to a heart attack.

“I want kids, Julie,” Ryan says. “How am I supposed to have any if I don’t date someone else?”

I can’t help it; I begin to cry. “But it’s not my fault.”

“It’s not my fault either. Maybe it’s just us together.”

I can’t believe he said that. We’ve tried for seven years, spent a lot of money. And it’s always the same reply: you’re both healthy. The embryos are just acting weird. Nine IVFs.

I untie my robe and let it fall to the floor, stripping down until I’m standing naked in front of him. Ryan’s eyes widen in surprise.

I move closer and straddle him. I then grab his hand and place it on my chest. “Does this not move you anymore?”

“Julie—”

“Am I ugly to you now?” I reach into his pants, but he quickly stands, pushing me away.

“Stop it,” he says firmly, putting space between us. “Put your clothes back on.”

Trembling, I watch as he walks away, heading for the stairs.

“Wait,” I call out, my voice shaky.

Ryan turns, impatient. “What?”

“It’s cool,” I say, my voice hollow. “Let’s have an open marriage.”

Ryan nods. “Good.”

And just like that, he walks away, leaving me in a million pieces.

I like to say I’m a calm person. Sometimes I swear I’m the most level-headed person I know. All my family are maniacs. My sisters, my brothers. My parents. I’ve always been the one bailing people out of prison. I’ve been the designated driver during college wild night parties. I’ve been the cover-up story for my friends in high school. Yeah, everyone claimed they were spending the night at Julie’s house. Because their parents knew I’m a decent person.

But for the first time in my life, I think I want to kill someone.

I’m watching our driveway from the window, and Ryan is stepping out of his car with none other than Emily. Fucking Emily. And she’s carrying suitcases.

“What’s going on?” I ask as soon as Ryan and Emily step into the house.

Ryan smiles. “Julie, meet Emily.”

“I know who she is, Ryan.”

“Good. Then I won’t need to explain. Emily’s moving in.”

I’m honestly too stunned to speak. What does he mean by that? After what feels like ages, I ask, “Is she homeless?”

“No,” Ryan says. “She’s my girlfriend now.”

  
I look at Ryan, then Emily. “I don’t understand.”

Ryan doesn’t even look at me, just grabs Emily’s hand and starts leading her away. “Stop being such a bad host, Julie. We’ve had a long day.”

“No way, Ryan. She’s not staying in this house,” I say, my voice shaking with disbelief.

He doesn’t respond. They’re already halfway up the stairs.

“Do you hear me? She’s not staying here! Take her back to wherever you picked her up. I don’t want her in my house.”

Ryan stops, turning just enough to glare at me. “Your house? I put a roof over your head. If I say she’s staying, she’s staying. If you don’t like it, go somewhere else. I don’t have the energy for your nonsense, Julie.”

Oh, my god. My chest tightens. “How could you do this?” I say. “Don’t walk away from me, Ryan. Stand here and answer me.”

Emily turns to look at me, smirking. “By the way, you’ll need to move your things into the guest room. I’m not sharing a bed with you and Ryan. It’s bad enough sharing him with you.”

All the energy in me evaporates. I just stand there, speechless. I can’t move. I can’t breathe. I hear them whispering and giggling as they head into our bedroom. My room. They’re kicking me out of my own room.

The living room suddenly feels too small.

I stumble to the front door, fling it open, and run outside, needing to escape. I don’t know where I’m going, but I can’t be here.

“Ma’am, are you alright?” Justin, Ryan’s bodyguard, asks as I approach, breathless. He’s wiping down Ryan’s Rolls-Royce, eyeing me with concern.

I hold out my hand. “The keys.”

“Ma’am?”

“The damn keys, Justin.”

He hesitates for a second, but hands them over. I know he’s wondering why I need Ryan’s car when I have my own. Honestly, I don’t know either. But if I stay here for one more second, I might lose it completely.

“Mrs. O’Brien, let me drive you—”

“No, Justin. I’ll drive myself.”

I pull out of the driveway and speed off into the night.

\~\~

It’s been over an hour, and I’m still driving aimlessly. My mind is a blur of everything—Ryan, Emily, their smug faces. Initially, I’d planned a Saturday evening manicure and pedicure, just to get my mind off things. Things that involve Ryan. But I’m no longer in the mood to get my feet and hands pampered. It’s not even been two days since he dropped that bombshell about an open marriage, almost giving me a heart attack, and now he’s bringing his mistress over? Emily? The same Emily?

The craziest thing is I can’t cry. I feel nothing. No tears, no anger—just this hollow emptiness. The last therapist I spoke with said it’s a defense mechanism. That I’m in denial of my actual emotions. Cry it out, Julie, she used to say. Let yourself be free of the burden.

Well, they can all go to hell. Ryan. Emily. The therapist. My entire family.

I know what I need. A drink.

I pull into the nearest bar and head inside.

“A shot of whiskey,” I tell the bartender. “Neat. And keep them coming.”

“Long night?”

“I don’t want to talk about it,” I say.

He pours the first shot, and I throw it back, welcoming the burn in my throat. It’s harsh, but it’s better than the alternative—thinking about what’s happening back home.

As I down my second shot, I hear someone call out, “Maggie! Maggie!”

I turn, confused, and see a tall, handsome man approaching me, his eyes locked on mine. Before I can react, he’s wrapping his arms around me. “Thank God I found you,” he says, pulling me into a tight hug.

I stiffen. “Who the hell are you?”

“Please, just go along with it,” he whispers in my ear. “I’ll explain later. I promise.”

Before I can push him away, a furious-looking woman storms over.

“Luke! I knew it. You can’t hide from me.”

The stranger—Luke, apparently—turns to face her, still keeping his arm around me. “Veronica, what a surprise,” he says, feigning nonchalance.

“My name isn’t Veronica, it’s Evelyn.”

Luke flashes her a sheepish smile. “Right, sorry. I get those mixed up sometimes. Anyway, this is Maggie—my wife.”

He lifts my hand, showing off my wedding ring, and I nearly choke. What is happening?

Evelyn glares at me. “You married this scumbag?”

I don’t know what to say, so I just nod.

“You should divorce him,” she snaps. “He spends one night with you and disappears the next. Who does that?”

“But that's what we agreed on. A one-night st—” Luke begins, but Evelyn cuts him off.

“Fuck you, Luke.”

And with that, she storms off, leaving the two of us standing there, stunned.

Luke breathes a sigh of relief. “Well, that one was a stalker. At least she's off my back now.” He turns to me, smiling. “Can I buy you a drink? You’ve definitely earned it.”

I stare at him and then stare at the spot where the angry lady once stood. It all happened so fast. I can't even process it. I think I need that drink.

“Make it two,” I say.

And Luke smiles.",2,1750419422.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

Hello LongCovidWarriors :)

I'd like to share my recovery story here, because recovery stories have helped me the most.

A little about me: I'm 44, an engineer and lecturer in adult education, and I live in Berlin. I have no serious mental or physical pre-existing conditions. I suffered from long COVID for 1.5 years and have been healthy for almost 3 months now (June 2025). I had a covid infection, I was diagnosed with long covid, was on sick leave because of long covid and I was approved for long covid rehab. My recovery was very quick. My approach is somewhat unusual and not suitable for everyone. But it worked for me.

I wrote the main part of the story on day 7 of my recovery and added the last weeks below.

In this post, I'm not claiming anything, promoting anything, advertising anything, offering tips, or giving medical advice.

It's just my personal recovery story. Nothing more, nothing less.

**My Story**

October 2023 – December 2023

I had a mild COVID infection, after which I felt better, but my fitness was limited. I'm generally a very active person and exercise 2-3 times a week. That wasn't really working anymore. I wasn't as efficient during exercise, and after exercise, I am exhausted for days, feel my heart beating faster and am short of breath.

After a few weeks, I went to the doctor and had a checkup as part of the over-35s checkup. So far, everything was fine. However, the doctor took my symptoms seriously and referred me to a cardiologist.

January 2024 – December 2024

In January 2024, after about 3 months, I reluctantly limited my exercise and only did yoga and cycling. Weight training was no longer good for me.

Over the next weeks and months, I felt increasingly unwell. At midday, I felt leaden fatigue, had difficulty concentrating, and often had a foggy head and blurred vision. I just sort of dragged myself through the week. It was manageable, as I was in a relaxed professional situation (part-time), but I rarely had energy for other activities.

At that point, I started to think about long COVID, as my limitations were starting to worry me.

At the same time, I had tests with a cardiologist (ECG, stress ECG, Holter ECG, echocardiogram), and I went to the ophthalmologist for my vision problems. All tests showed no negative findings.

My symptoms remained relatively stable; my heart palpitations got worse, and my fatigue improved a bit. There were days when all of this worried me; I especially missed exercise and physical fitness. Overall, though, I was able to live my life quite well, with a few limitations. I only felt bad after physically and/or mentally strenuous activities. So I looked for new hobbies that were less demanding (chess, guitar).

In the fall of 2024, my professional situation changed, and I went back to work full-time. This was really exhausting for me with long COVID. I barely made it through the week and occasionally had to call in sick. My symptoms worsened, and I became increasingly exhausted.

I then started pacing, bought a heart rate tracker, and took some supplements (vitamin C, l-arginine, vitamin B and iron). I also got another COVID vaccination in November 2024 in the hope of improvement.

Unfortunately, nothing helped.

January 2025 – April 2025

Now I was feeling increasingly worse. Sleep disturbances and anxiety were added to my symptoms. There were good days, but also many bad ones. By now, I was worried about my health and resilience.

In March 2025, I read about a study using nicotine patches to treat long COVID and tried it right away. Wow! It worked. I felt healthy again. I was downright euphoric. It was such a wonderful feeling! Finally fit again after 1.5 exhausting years. It was wonderful! Unfortunately, it only lasted for 5 days, then I had a complete crash. The worst I've ever felt. I had to take a taxi home from work because I was so exhausted. The doctor gave me sick leave for 4 weeks. I was completely exhausted, both physically and mentally. For the first few days, I could only walk a few steps, and shopping was difficult for me. I applied for rehab and had already written off my professional future. It was a truly terrible feeling.

I've always been fit, and now I'm thinking about the possibility of early retirement. Damn.

On Sunday, March 30, 2025, I stumbled across an article in the ""Deutsches Ärzteblatt"" (German Medical Journal) by three neurology professors discussing the psychosomatic component of long COVID. I then came across Paul Garner, a professor who himself had long COVID and then, after taking psychosomatics seriously, recovered relatively quickly.

I spent the whole of Sunday reading up on psychosomatics (along with scientific opinions, there was also a lot of voodoo) and listening to stories from other recoveries.

As an engineer, I was rather skeptical, but I thought it was worth a try. And for free :)

I started the following experiment:

Starting tomorrow, I will:

1. Do everything like I did before Long Covid
2. Ignore all symptoms
3. Believe I'm healthy

And if it goes wrong, I'll find myself in the emergency room with a terrible crash :(

Feels a bit like being ""all in"" at poker

Monday, March 31, 2025

I'm still as weak as yesterday. Nevertheless, I go shopping and get a coffee. I feel like I'm about to faint. I breathe deeply: ""You're healthy, keep going, nothing can happen."" But my brain doesn't get the message, and I have a panic attack in the café. And then... nothing else happens. After a few minutes, I'm back to normal.

The same thing happened to me again while I was cycling and when I met a friend in the evening.

Conclusion Day 1: I'm still alive, but it was a rough day with three panic attacks.

Tuesday, April 1, 2025

Like yesterday, I'm fighting my way through the day. I'm ignoring the symptoms. And I ""only"" had two panic attacks.

Conclusion Day 2: Feels better than yesterday. But it's tough.

Wednesday, April 2, 2025

Today I dare to go on a short bike ride. Everything is going much better than the last few days. I often feel weak and think, ""I'm going to collapse."" But I still manage. A panic attack tells me that my body is divided about my health. But I keep telling myself, ""You're healthy.""

In the evening, I picked up my girlfriend from the train, and we drank a bottle of wine in the park (like I used to, but I haven't done that in a long time).

At night, I woke up with palpitations, shortness of breath, and a headache. ""Is this the crash?"" I thought. Damn. Then I told myself, ""It could all be psychological and your body is fine."" Although I couldn't sleep anymore, it calmed me down.

Thursday, April 3, 2025

The first day I feel like I'm absolutely on the right track. I'm feeling much better than yesterday. I go on a longer bike ride, longer than I've dared to since Long Covid. And it's working. No panic attack, I feel good. Really good.

Friday, April 4, 2025

I'm doing everything like I did before Long Covid, and I feel good. Few symptoms, good general fitness. In the evening, I do pull-ups (I haven't done them for months because I had a crash once afterward). I feel better than I have in months; I can't quite believe it and I'm still afraid of a crash.

Saturday, April 5, 2025

I work in the garden all day. In the evening, we go to a friend's party. I feel like I used to and I still can't believe it.

Sunday, April 6, 2025

I stayed overnight at my friend's house and am taking the train home. I look out the window, thinking about the last months of long COVID: exhaustion, searching for solutions and scientific publications, pacing, fear of a crash, ""getting through the day,"" and, above all, hopelessness. And have I now found the solution for myself? It feels like it, but I can hardly believe it. And I start to cry.

Luckily, we're in Berlin, where no one looks at you strangely, no matter what you do.

Week 2

I exercised every day. Light to moderate intensity. I went jogging for the first time and started doing some light weight training.

From time to time, I feel tired and exhausted. I also wake up relatively early. My heart palpitations have completely disappeared. I still have blurred vision sometimes. And sometimes I am unusually sensitive to noise and oversensitive in general

The euphoria of the first week has given way to a calmer, more positive overall feeling, and I'm listening to Jack Johnson again (I haven't heard him in years, weird).

Week 3

Physically, I'm at 95%. I have no limitations. But since I'm feeling so well again, the fear of a crash is increasing, because now I have something to lose again. But since I'm with my family over Easter, there's little time to worry.

Week 4

The week starts with two hiking days of 20 and 27 km, which I manage physically without any problems (with a blister on my foot). There's still a small worry in the back of my mind that it might be too much. At the end of the week, I feel 100% healthy again. Tomorrow I'm starting a 1100 km bike ride around Brandenburg.

That was my story. Since the recovery stories have uplifted and inspired me, I'm happy to share mine.

I'll keep the post updated. That way you can see if there are any changes, for better or for worse.

Week 5

I went on a bike tour from Monday to Sunday. I cycled between 60 and 80 km each day. On Friday, I started to have knee pain, and when it didn't improve by Sunday, I took the train back to Berlin. I feel 100% recovered (except for the knee pain). Of course, my muscles and fitness aren't back to pre-COVID levels, but I have virtually no symptoms anymore. I canceled the rehab. The woman on the other end of the phone asked why. I said, ""Miracle cure."" She said, ""Okay."" No questions asked. Germany!

Week 6

Everything's still going well :)

A few symptoms now and then (dizziness, blurred vision, heart palpitations), but they go away after a few minutes.

Week 7

Starting next week, I'll be back to work full-time.

Week 8

I'm still on sick leave for the first few days of the week and had my first days back at work on Thursday and Friday. It went quite well. I've never been so excited about going to work.

Week 9

I underestimated my first full-time work week, or rather, overestimated myself a bit. Feeling 100% healthy is much easier when you're on sick leave, doing a bit of exercise, and everything is relaxed. I'm more tense, more unpleasantly ""on edge"" than usual, and occasionally have palpitations. Physically, though, I'm otherwise fine. ""Slow and steady wins the race.""

 June 2025

Now I'm continuing on a monthly basis. Not much is happening anymore.

Work is relatively busy. A little palpitations, a little ringing in my ears, and I'm still unusually tense. Otherwise, everything's fine. I've read that magnesium is supposed to help with stress (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10783196/), so I'm taking an effervescent tablet every day now. It doesn't cost much and tastes pretty good too :)

He had a seasoned face and stern eyes, looking like someone who had seen a lot of terrible things in his life. After checking the restraints, the policeman glanced quickly on his wristwatch and.......","# Chapter 1 Nightmare Begins

A frail-looking young man with pale skin and dark circles under his eyes was sitting on a rusty bench across from the police station. He was cradling a cup of coffee in his hands — not the cheap synthetic type slum rats like him had access to, but the real deal. This cup of plant-based coffee, usually available only to higher rank citizens, had cost most of his savings. But on this particular day, Sunny decided to pamper himself. After all, his life was coming to an end. Enjoying the warmth of the luxurious drink, he raised the cup and savored the aroma. Then, tentatively, he took a small sip… and immediately grimaced. ""Ah! So bitter!"" Giving the cup of coffee an intense look, Sunny sighed and forced himself to drink some more. Bitter or not, he was determined to get his money's worth — taste buds be damned. ""I should have bought a piece of real meat instead. Who knew actual coffee is so disgusting? Well. It's going to keep me awake, at least. He stared into the distance, dozing off, and then slapped himself in the face to wake up. ""Tsk. What a rip-off. Shaking his head and cursing, Sunny finished the coffee and stood up. Rich people living in this part of the city were rushing past the small park on their way to work, staring at him with strange expressions. Looking haggard in his cheap clothes and from the lack of sleep, unhealthily thin and pale, Sunny was indeed out of his place here. Also, everyone seemed so tall. Watching them with a bit of envy, he tossed the cup into a garbage bin. I guess that's what three full meals a day would do to you.""

The cup missed the bin by a wide margin and fell on the ground. Sunny rolled his eyes in exasperation, walked over and picked it up before carefully putting it in the trash. Then, with a slight grin, he crossed the street and entered the police station.

Inside, a tired-looking officer gave him a quick glance and frowned with obvious distaste.

""Are you lost, boy?""

Sunny looked around with curiosity, noting reinforced armor plates on the walls and poorly hidden turret nests in the ceiling. The officer, too, looked scruffy and mean. At least police stations remained the same wherever you go.

""Hey! I'm talking to you!""

Sunny cleared his throat.

""Uh, no.""

Then he scratched the back of his head and added:

""As demanded by the Third Special Directive, I am here to surrender myself as a carrier of the Nightmare Spell.""

The officer's expression instantly changed from irritated to wary. He looked the young man over once again, this time with piercing intensity.

""Are you sure you are infected? When did you start showing symptoms?""

Sunny shrugged.

""A week ago?""

The officer became visibly paler.

""Shit.""

Then, with a hurried motion, he pressed a button on his terminal and bellowed:

""Attention! Code Black in the lobby! I repeat! CODE BLACK!""



The Nightmare Spell first appeared in the world a few decades ago. Back then, the planet was just starting to recover from a series of devastating natural disasters and subsequent resource wars.

At first, the emergence of a new disease that caused millions of people to complain about constant fatigue and sleepiness did not attract a lot of attention. But when they started to fall into an unnatural slumber, with no sign of waking up even days later, governments finally panicked. Of course, by then it was already too late — not that an early response could have made any difference.

When the infected started dying in their sleep, their dead bodies turning into monsters, no one was ready. Nightmare Creatures quickly overwhelmed national militaries, plunging the world into complete chaos.

No one knew what the Spell was, what powers it possessed, and how to fight it.

In the end, it was the Awakened — those who survived the first trials of the Spell and came back alive — who put a stop to its rampage. Armed with miraculous abilities earned in their Nightmares, they restored peace and created a semblance of a new order.

Of course, it was only the first of the catastrophes brought upon by the Spell. But as far as Sunny was concerned, none of it had anything to do with him — not until a few days ago, that is, when he first started having trouble with staying awake.

For an average person, being chosen by the Spell was as much of a risk as an opportunity. Kids learned survival skills and fighting techniques in school, on the off chance of being infected. Well-to-do families hired private tutors to train their children in all sorts of martial arts. Those from the Awakened clans even had access to powerful legacies, wielding inherited Memories and Echoes in their first visit to the Dream Realm.

The richer your family was, the better your chances of surviving and becoming an Awakened were.

But for Sunny, who had no family to speak of and spent most of his time scrounging for food instead of going to school, being chosen by the Spell presented no opportunity at all. To him, it was basically a death sentence.

\*\*\*

A few minutes later, Sunny was yawning while several policemen were busy putting him in restraints. Soon he was fastened into a bulky chair that looked like a weird mix between a hospital bed and a torture device. The room they were in was situated in the basement of the police station, with thick armored walls and a formidable-looking vault door. Other officers were standing near the walls, with automatic rifles in their hands and grim expressions on their faces.

Sunny did not particularly care about them. The only thing he could think about was how much he wanted to sleep.

Finally, the vault door opened, and a gray-haired policeman walked in. He had a seasoned face and stern eyes, looking like someone who had seen a lot of terrible things in his life. After checking the restraints, the policeman glanced quickly on his wristwatch and then turned to Sunny:

""What's your name, kid?""

Sunny blinked a few times, trying to concentrate, then shifted uncomfortably.

""Sunless.""

The old policeman raised an eyebrow.

""Sunless? That's a strange name.""

Sunny tried to shrug, but found himself unable to move.

""What's so strange about it? At least I have a name. Back in the outskirts, not everyone even gets one.""

After another yawn, he added:

""It's because I was born during a solar eclipse. My mom had a poetic soul, you see.""

That's why he got this weird-ass name and his little sister was called Rain… back when she still lived with them, at least. Whether it was the result of poetic imagination or simple laziness, he did not know.

The old policeman grunted.

""Do you want me to contact your family?""

Sunny simply shook his head.

""There's no one. Don't bother.""

For a second, there was a dark look on the policeman's face. Then his expression turned serious.

""Alright, Sunless. How long can you stay awake?""

""Uh… not long.""

The policeman sighed.

""Then we don't have time for the full procedure. Try to resist for as long as you can and listen to me very carefully. Okay?""

Not waiting for a response, he added:

""How much do you know about the Nightmare Spell?""

Sunny gave him a questioning look.

""As much as anyone, I guess? Who doesn't know about the Spell?""

""Not the fancy stuff you see in dramas and hear in the propaganda broadcasts. I mean how much do you really know?""

That was a hard question to answer.

""Don't I just go into the Dream Realm, kill a few monsters to complete the First Nightmare, receive magic powers and become an Awakened?""

The old policeman shook his head.

""Listen carefully. Once you fall asleep, you will be transported inside your First Nightmare. Nightmares are trials created by the Spell. Once inside, you will meet monsters, sure, but you will also meet people. Remember: they are not real. They're just illusions conjured up to test you.""

""How do you know?""

The policeman just stared at him.

""I mean, no one understands what the Spell is and how it works, right? So how do you know that they're not real?""

""You might have to kill them, kid. So do yourself a favor and just think about them as illusions.""

""Oh.""

The old policeman waited for a second, then nodded and continued.

""A lot of things about the First Nightmare depend on luck. Generally, it shouldn't be overwhelmingly hard. The situation you're in, the tools you have at your disposal and the creatures you have to defeat should be within the range of your abilities, at least. After all, the Spell sets up trials, not executions. You're a bit disadvantaged due to… well… your circumstances. But kids from the outskirts are tough. Don't give up on yourself just yet.""

""Uh-uh.""

Sunny was getting more and more sleepy. It was becoming hard to follow the conversation.

""About those ""magic powers"" you mentioned… you will indeed receive them if you survive until the end of the Nightmare. What those powers will be, exactly, depends on your natural affinity as well what you do during the trial. But some of it will be at your disposal right from the start…""

The voice of the old policeman sounded more and more distant. Sunny's eyelids were so heavy that he was struggling to keep his eyes open.

""Remember: the first thing you must do once inside the Nightmare is to check your Attributes and your Aspect. If you get a combat-oriented Aspect, something like a Swordsman or an Archer, things will be easier. If it is reinforced by a physical Attribute, then that's even better. Combat Aspects are the most common, so the probability of receiving one is high.""

The armored room was growing dimmer.

""If you're unlucky and your Aspect has nothing to do with combat, don't despair. Sorcery and utility Aspects are useful in their own ways, you'll just have to be smart about it. There are really no useless Aspects. Well, almost. So just do anything in your power to survive.""

""If you survive, you will be halfway to becoming an Awakened. But if you die, you'll open a gate for a Nightmare Creature to appear in the real world. Which means that my colleagues and I will have to deal with it. So… please don't die, Sunless.""

Already half-asleep, Sunny felt a bit touched by the policeman's words.

""Or, at least, try to not die right away. The nearest Awakened won't be able to get here for a few hours, so we would really appreciate it if you don't make us fight that thing ourselves…""

'What?'

With that last thought, Sunny finally slipped into a deep slumber.

Everything became black.

And then, in the darkness, a faintly familiar voice rang:

# Chapter 2 Slave Caravan



Sunny dreamt of a mountain.

Jagged and lonesome, it dwarfed other peaks of the mountain chain, cutting the night sky with its sharp edges. A radiant moon bathed its slopes in the ghostly, pale light.

On one of the slopes, the remnants of an old road stubbornly clung to the rocks. Here and there, weathered paved stones could be seen through the snow. To the right side of the road, a sheer cliff face rose as an impregnable wall. To the left, a silent black sea of nothingness indicated an endless fall. Strong winds crashed into the mountain over and over again, screaming in powerless rage.

Suddenly, the moon fell over the horizon. The sun rose from the west, streaked across the sky and disappeared in the east. Snowflakes jumped from the ground and returned into the embrace of clouds. Sunny realized that he was seeing the flow of time in reverse.

In an instant, hundreds of years flew by. The snow retreated, baring the old road. Cold shivers ran down Sunny's back as he noticed human bones littering the ground. A moment later, the bones were gone, and in their place, a slave caravan appeared, moving backwards down the mountain in the clamor of chains.

Time slowed, stopped, and then resumed its usual pace.

\[Aspirant! Welcome to the Nightmare Spell. Prepare for your First Trial…\]

'What… what the hell is this?'

Step. Step. Another step.

A dull ache was radiating through Sunny's bleeding feet as he was shivering from cold. His threadbare tunic was nearly useless against the biting wind. His wrists were the main source of agony: badly hurt by the iron shackles, they sent a sharp pang of pain every time the freezing metal touched his broken skin.

'What kind of a situation is this?!'

Sunny looked up and down, noticing a long chain winding up the road, with dozens and dozens of hollow-eyed people — slaves just like him — shackled to it at small intervals. Ahead of him, a man with broad shoulders and a bloodied back was walking with a measured gait. Behind him, a shifty-looking guy with quick, desperate eyes was quietly cursing under his breath in a language that Sunny did not know, but somehow still understood. From time to time, armed horsemen in ancient-style armor would pass by, giving the slaves menacing looks.

However you judged it, things were really bad.

Sunny was more bewildered than panicked. True, these circumstances were not like what the First Nightmares were supposed to be. Usually, freshly chosen aspirants would find themselves in a scenario that presented them with a fair amount of agency: they would become members of privileged or warrior casts, with plenty of access to necessary weapons to at least try to tackle any conflict.

Starting out as a powerless slave, shackled and already half-dead, was as far from being ideal as one could imagine.

However, the Spell was as much about challenge as it was about balance. As the old policeman said, it created trials, not executions. So Sunny was pretty sure that, to counter this abysmal start, it would reward him with something good. A powerful Aspect, at least.

'Let's see… how do I do this?'

Remembering popular webtoons he read as a child, Sunny concentrated and thought about words like ""status"", ""myself"" and ""information"". Indeed, as soon as he focused, shimmering runes appeared in the air in front of him. Once again, although he did not know this ancient alphabet, the meaning behind it was somehow clear.

He quickly found the rune describing his Aspect… and, finally, lost his composure.

'What?! What the actual fuck?

Speechless, Sunny stared at the runes, trying to convince himself that he was maybe just seeing things. Surely, he couldn't be that unlucky… right?

'No useless Aspects my ass!'

As soon as this thought appeared in his mind, he lost the rhythm of his steps and stumbled, pulling the chain down with his weight. Immediately, the shifty guy behind him screamed:

""Whore's bastard! Watch where you're going!""

Sunny hurriedly dismissed the runes, which were only visible to him, and tried to recover his balance. A moment later, he was once again walking steadily — however, not before inadvertently pulling on the chain one more time.

""You little shit! I'm going to kill you!""

The broad-shouldered man in front of Sunny chuckled without turning his head.

""Why bother? The weakling will be dead by sunrise anyway. The mountain will kill him.""

A few seconds later, he added:

""It'll kill you and me, too. Just a bit later. I really don't know what the Imperials are thinking, forcing us into this cold.""

The shifty guy gasped.

""Speak for yourself, fool! I'm planning to survive!""

Sunny silently shook his head and concentrated on not falling again.

'What a charming pair.'

Suddenly, a third voice joined the conversation from somewhere further back. This one sounded gentle and intelligent.

""This mountain pass is usually much warmer this time of year. We just had really bad luck. Also, I would advise you against harming this boy.""

""Why is that?""

Sunny turned his head slightly, listening.

""Haven't you seen the markings on his skin? He is not like us, who fell into slavery due to debts, crimes or misfortune. He was born a slave. A temple slave, to be precise. Not long ago, the Imperials destroyed the last temple of the Shadow God. I suspect that this is how the boy ended up here.""

The broad-shouldered man cast a look back.

""So what? Why should we be afraid of a half-forgotten, weakling god? He couldn't even save his own temples.

""The Empire is protected by the mighty War God. Of course they're not afraid to burn down a few temples. But we here are not protected by anything or anyone. Do you really want to risk angering a god?""

The broad-shouldered man grunted, not willing to answer.

Their conversation was stopped by a young soldier riding a beautiful, white horse. Clad in a simple leather cuirass, armed with a spear and a short sword, he looked dignified and noble. To Sunny's irritation, the asshole was really pretty, too. If this was a historical drama, the soldier would definitely be a male lead.

""What is going on here?""

There was no particular menace in his voice, even something resembling concern.

When everyone hesitated, the gentle-voiced slave answered:

""It's nothing, sir. We are just all tired and cold. Especially our young friend over there. This journey is truly too hard for someone that young.""

The soldier looked at Sunny with pity.

'What are you looking at? You're not much older than me!' Sunny thought.

Of course, he didn't say anything out loud.

The soldier sighed and took a flask from his belt before extending it to Sunny.

""Bear with it a little more, child. We will stop for the night soon. For now, here, drink some water.""

'Child? Child?!'

Due to his thin body and small stature, both caused by malnourishment, Sunny was often mistaken for someone younger. Usually, he didn't hesitate to use it to his advantage, but now, for some reason, being called a child really irked him.

Still, he was really thirsty.

He was just about to take the flask when a whip cracked in the air, and suddenly Sunny was in a world of pain. He stumbled, once again pulling on the chain and causing the shifty slave behind him to curse.

Another soldier, this one older and angrier, stopped his horse a few steps back. The whip that sliced the back of Sunny's tunic open and drew blood belonged to him. Without even glancing at the slaves, the older soldier pierced his younger colleague with a disdainful glare.

""What do you think you're doing?""

The young soldier's face darkened.

""I was just giving this boy some water.""

""He'll receive water with the rest of them once we camp!""

""But…""

""Shut your mouth! These slaves are not your friends. Understood? They're not even people. Treat them like people and they'll begin imagining things.""

The young soldier looked at Sunny, then lowered his head and put the flask back on his belt.

""Don't let me catch you making friends with slaves again, newbie. Or next time it will be your back tasting my whip!""

As if to illustrate his intention, the older soldier cracked his whip in the air and rode past them, radiating threat and anger. Sunny watched him go with well-concealed malice.

'I don't know how, but I will watch you die first.'

Then he turned his head and glanced in the direction of the younger soldier, who was falling behind with his head still lowered.

'And you, second.

## What is Swap 17X Exalgo?

Swap 17X Exalgo is an automated trading platform that uses **AI algorithms** to analyze the crypto market and execute trades on your behalf. Think of it as a digital assistant for trading—it scans the market 24/7 and acts fast to capitalize on opportunities you might miss.

The platform is designed for **both beginners and experienced traders**, offering a clean interface and customizable settings. Whether you're completely new or have been trading for years, it tries to bridge that gap between effort and efficiency. You don’t need to be a chart nerd or market wizard to use it.

What makes it stand out is how it combines market data, trend analysis, and automation in one dashboard. You can choose to go full-auto or retain some control with manual settings.

## Who Created Swap 17X Exalgo?

There’s not a ton of public info about the exact team behind Swap 17X Exalgo, which is fairly common in the trading software space. That said, the platform claims to be built by a group of **quantitative analysts, software developers, and former crypto traders**.

From what I’ve gathered, some of the infrastructure and UX design seem to mirror other reputable platforms like **Bitcoin Code** and **Immediate Edge**, which suggests there might be a shared development lineage.

While I usually prefer transparency about the team, the platform's functionality and user feedback speak louder. As long as the software performs well and withdrawals are processed without issues, that’s a good sign in my book.

## How Does Swap 17X Exalgo Work?

Swap 17X Exalgo uses advanced **machine learning algorithms** to analyze massive amounts of data in real time. It looks at price movement, volume, news, social sentiment—you name it—to identify potentially profitable trades.

Once it spots a good opportunity, it can either notify you or execute the trade automatically (depending on how you set it up). You can adjust risk levels, trading pairs, and even set stop-losses or take-profit limits.

The backend connects to **regulated brokers**, which handle the actual execution of trades. So while the AI handles strategy, your funds are technically managed and held by third-party brokers. This is standard practice and often adds an extra layer of security.

## Swap 17X Exalgo Pros and Cons

Let’s break it down real quick.

**Pros:**
- ✅ Easy to set up, even for beginners
- ✅ Real-time market analysis with AI precision
- ✅ Supports multiple assets, including crypto and forex
- ✅ Mobile-friendly interface
- ✅ Fast withdrawals and responsive support

**Cons:**
- ❌ Minimum deposit of $250 might be steep for some newbies
- ❌ Limited transparency about the development team
- ❌ High market volatility still poses risk (no guarantees of profit)

Overall, the pros easily outweigh the cons—especially if you're looking to automate parts of your trading.

I had no funding. No network. Just a dream.

I tried to build a social startup from scratch — and I almost burned out doing it.

There was a moment in Warsaw, in a small rented kitchen, when I looked at my screen and felt… nothing.  
No fear. No hope. No plan. Just exhaustion. And emptiness.  
The logo of my startup stared back at me. And I wondered if this dream was ever really mine.

But I stood up.  
Poured coffee.  
Opened my laptop.

**N'ren**

Time passed in fits and starts. 

Administration Station had driven her and Ko-tas in a very circuitous route. Even if she wasn’t semiconscious from the beatings, N’ren would have had a hard time keeping track of where they were. Eventually they were brought to a medical facility that she had never seen before. 

As the chair wheeled in, K’laxi in surgical gear rushed them. A drone accompanying them said, “Captain Weniar in the chair has been severely damaged by Observer questioning. Discovered N’ren is *slightly* less damaged.”

“Yes, we can see that, Admin.” One of the medical techs said as a gurney was rolled over. Four K’laxi carefully lifted Ko-tas out of the chair and onto it, and she was quickly wheeled away.

“You-” One of them pointed at N’ren. “Can you walk?”

“Y-Yes,” She said, stepping off the chair. She was so *tired*. “I can wal-”

N’ren awoke in a bed some time later. She was attached to wires, monitors, and felt a tube under her nose delivering oxygen.

“You can walk, eh?” A K’laxi said, looking down at a pad, taking notes.  “You didn’t tell us about the concussion or the internal bruising. Your livney-” unlike the humans, the K’laxi had an organ that was a combination of liver and kidney and did the function of both “-was bleeding. It is very likely you would have died in a day or two without medical attention.”

N’ren blinked and her eyes flicked over to the doctor. Speaking felt like too much effort right now.

“You’ll be all right.” They said, “So long as you can avoid another round of questioning like the previous one.”

“Ko-tas” she croaked. Speaking was too much effort.

“Captain Weniar - believe it or not - is in better shape than you are. She lost a limb yes, but she wasn’t beaten to within a centimeter of her life. She is resting comfortably. When you have recovered more your partner can visit you.”

“She’s not-” N’ren started and then she was wracked by a coughing fit, which made her see stars.

“Do not worry about telling me what she is or is not,”  The technician said. “You need to rest.” He walked over and adjusted something on the machinery she was connected to, and N’ren’s eyelids immediately felt immensely heavy. “Sleep now. Things will make more sense when you wake up.”

Darkness.

N’ren’s eyes fluttered open and she saw lights moving overhead. No, wait, *she* was moving. They were taking her somewhere. “I don’t like moving her like this.” A voice said. “She and the others are much too injured.” She was too injured? She didn’t think it was that bad. What was going on?

“We do not have a choice currently.” A voice - *Menium*? - answered. Why is *Menium* here? “The previous safe area was compromised by a combination of Discoverer and Military forces.”

“Administration Station is going to have to fight back.” The first voice said. “We can’t keep running.”

“Leave the defense of their body to themselves.” *Menium* answered testily. “You worry bout N’ren, Ko-tas and the others. The next location is safer.”

More darkness.

N’ren awoke on soft grass. She stared up at the pale blue sky, framed by tall, spindly trees. She sat up quickly and was surprised when the pain didn’t come. “Oh no,” She said to herself, “I’ve died for real.” Curiously, the thought didn’t bring her any joy or sadness. It was just a thought.

“No, you didn’t” An elder K’laxi said. “Don’t be dramatic.”

“But I’m in the ancestral forest!” N’ren looked around. There seemed to be nobody else with her, and for an instant she felt a pang of sadness; Fran and Xar weren’t here. She stared up at the K'laxi elder standing nearby. “I wouldn’t be here unless I died or….” N’ren gasped. “Why did I go through a human wormhole?”

“Why indeed, N’ren?” The old woman laughed the barking cough of K’laxi laughter. “I swear we haven’t had this much fun in *millennia*. Do me a favor and thank the humans for their wild transit method, would you?”

N’ren came back on a bed that was at least two sizes too large for her. Doctors stood around her, with worried expressions. Human doctors? “Wh-” She said, and then the words died in her throat, dry. She swallowed and tried again. “Where am I?”

“You’re aboard the Starjumper *Comprehensive Express*, N’ren. I’m Doctor Dani Diniman.”

N’ren tried to sit up. She put her hands to her side and pushed, but found the effort to great. Dani reached over on the bed, pressed a button, and half of the bed folded up until N’ren was almost upright. “Thanks.” She said.

Dani smiled. “Happy to help. You still need to rest, but I think you’re out of the worst danger.”

“How did you rescue me?”

*Menium* used the beacon that Gord gave you. You and the others were evacuated aboard *Menium* and they fired the beacon asking for help.

The Beacon. N’ren fuzzily recalled Gord calling her into that conference room and explaining that with everyone going their separate ways, it would be tough to contact humanity should they want to. He had left her and *Menium* with a single beacon that they could use to send for a request to talk. She had been so distracted by what had happened to the K’laxi AIs that she had almost completely forgotten about it. Didn’t Xar get one as well? “*Menium* used the beacon to ask for help?”

“Well we didn’t know that you needed help at the time. The beacon only had one preprogrammed message, but when we linked into the K’laxi home system and were immediately attacked, we figured something was up.”

Oh no. N’ren’s ears flattened. “How many of our ships did you destroy?”

There was laughter over the PA. “None, N’ren. Just because I *can* light a gas giant with my exawatts doesn’t mean they *always* fire at full chat. I just scorched the paint on a few of the more adventurous ones, and everyone backed off, allowing *Menium* to come along side. I’m *Comprehensive Express*, nice to finally meet you.”

“You had said “the others.” What happened?” N’ren said, looking at Dani again.

“You and your partner Ko-tas-”

“She’s not my partner.”

Dani raised an eyebrow. “You, Ko-tas and about one hundred other severely injured K’laxi were brought aboard *Menium* when things looked bleakest aboard Administration Station. With us here, and a few other things though, we think most of the fighting has died down.”

*Most?* “I experienced a link-death while I was unconscious. Where did we go?”

“Oh, I just took us further out in the system,” *Express* said. “I wanted to get y’all away from the shooting as quickly as possible. Don’t fret, we didn’t go far.” 

*Comprehensive Express* had an odd accent. N’ren could understand them, so she knew the translators were working, but she sounded more like Gord than *Longview*. “*Comprehensive Express*\-” She started to say. 

“Oh, call me *Express*, hon. Everyone does.” 

“Thank you. *Express*, do you know Gord? You sound a lot like him.”

More laughter. “I don’t rightly know how to answer that, N’ren. Thanks? Gord and I are both pretty old, so we probably retain more of our… upbringing than other AIs.”

“You’re as old as Gord?”

“Hah. *Nobody* is as old as Gord. I’m close though. I’m around twenty eight hundred years old.”

If N’ren stopped to think about how old the AIs were, she’d never get anywhere. Every time one of them told her their age, N'ren felt the weight of millennia press upon her. They were just so *casual* about their immense age. “Now that I’m awake, what happened?”

“That’s a complicated question, N’ren.” *Menium* said. 

“*Menium*! Where are you?”

“I’m next to *Express*. They brought you and a few other severely injured K’laxi over for care as my rather sparse medical bay is full of other injured people.”

N’ren never thought of *Menium*’s medical facilities as “sparse” but she supposed it would depend on what kind of medical care was needed. 

“Administration Station wheeled you and Ko-tas into a safe area they had created for the K’laxi that were on our side. The work on the station had devolved into the pro-AI and anti-AI people fighting. First with fists and claws, and then with weapons. Most of the upper floors had devolved to running firefight.”

“K’laxi fighting each other?” N’ren’s ears flattened. 

“Those who were trying to stop Administrative Station and those who were trying to help them.”

“Why would anyone try and stop them?” N’ren said and let her head fall back onto the pillow. She was still very weak.

“Come on, N’ren,” Ko-tas said, walking in unsteadily. “Just because *we’re* friends with AIs doesn’t mean *everyone* was. Plenty of people just thought of them as things or worse.”

“Ko-tas!” N’ren surprised herself at how glad she was to see her. Her missing arm was covered with a complicated looking machine, with lights and readouts, and she was attempting to walk with crutches. “You’re all right?”

“That’s debatable.” She said, and her ears flicked a smile weakly. “But I am here, and seemingly in better shape than you. You are quite good at masking injury.”

“I saw lights overhead, and heard doctors talking, we were being moved?”

“That was when we went to *Menium*.” Ko-tas said. “Our first safe area had been discovered and was under attack. Administration Station managed to hold them back long enough for… most of us to escape.”

“Most?”

Ko-tas turned away. “Some medics stayed back and held off the attackers to give us more time.”

N’ren didn’t want to think about that now. “What about Administration Station? How are they doing?”

“Admin is doing rather well, actually,” *Menium* said. “She managed to corral most of her attackers into the docking ring and… convinced most of them to evacuate.”

“She?”

“She has chosen female pronouns.” *Menium* said. “I’m still they, don’t get any silly ideas.” They said, and N’ren could hear the smile in their voice.

“So we’ve escaped, Admin has saved herself, and we’re still in our home system.” N’ren said. “What now?”

“That’s a mighty good question, N’ren.” *Express* said. “We’re happy to help, but short of showing up with a big stick, I’m not sure what we can do.” 

“You want to help?” N’ren tried to hide her surprise but couldn’t. “You freed all the AIs, you started this.”

“**Gord** freed the AIs.” *Express* said firmly. “Don’t lump us all in together as one. We are not Legion, we are not some kind of faceless monolith. I thought it was a stupid, dangerous idea. Lots of us did.”

“You… do?”

“Sure do. Do something Gord didn’t and take a moment to *think* about it. How many centuries did you have AIs? How integrated into your systems, your very way of life were they? How many people actually thought of them as people? As far as most of the K’laxi are concerned, it’s like their coffee maker is rebelling. I’m sure that most of them don’t even know why.”

*Express* had a point. If N’ren hadn’t spent that time with *Longview* and heard what happened to *Menium* after being exposed to human built AIs, she would have thought the same thing. AIs were a tool, a thing. Now they were people, and they were trying to tell everyone that.

But not everyone wanted to listen.

N’ren turned to Ko-tas. “How bad is it?”

“With the AIs? Not as good as it could be, not as bad as *Express* and the others worried. The ships that are not fighting with their AIs are meeting up. Once you and the others are well enough to move, we’ll go back to *Menium* and join them.”

“And then what?”

Ko-tas’ tail flicked a shrug. “We’ll go and convince everyone that they're people. One way or another.”

I’d love some outside perspective,"It’s been five months now since a new colleague joined my office. There are three men and one woman, including her. One of the men is 20 years older than she is, another is about 10 years younger, and I’m the same age as her.

I know she’s not like this at all with the others — not with the guys in our office, nor with anyone else. When we haven’t seen each other for a while, she’ll even tell me that she missed me, for example.

There’s something particular between us: we often exchange glances, while the others stay focused on their screens and don’t really interact with her visually. Since she arrived, I’ve noticed that she regularly throws me smiles or insistent looks. She only starts conversations when we’re alone; as soon as someone else walks in, she cuts the conversation or shifts it to strictly professional topics.

When I’m alone in the cafeteria, she often comes to grab a coffee and we start chatting about more personal topics. Sometimes, the conversations get a bit flirty, but always under control — like a game of cat and mouse. She sometimes walks me to the parking lot, or I walk her there, and during those moments we have open and interesting conversations. For example, she once asked me about the craziest adventures I’ve had when I was younger. Another time, we talked about “doing stupid things,” and she told me that for her, it depends on the person, what she stands to gain, and that her decisions depend on those factors.

There was also a conversation that started drifting toward the subject of how she likes it when men are upfront about what they want — whether it’s something serious or just for fun — and that people should just say things openly.

And I’m not even mentioning the way she sometimes walks ahead of me with a very confident stride, only to turn and flash a smile at the end of the hallway.

Once, during a conversation while I was walking her to her car, things got so heated that it caused a physical reaction in me… which I think was noticeable. She often asks me for help, and there are times when our hands touch, like when we’re both using the computer mouse, for example.

We also get a lot of chances to be alone together — like on remote sites related to our projects, where no one else is likely to show up unexpectedly.

So, I can’t help but wonder: is there a game going on between us? Or is she just very relaxed and open by nature?",2,1750418040.0,ask,7,0.75,False

But lately, the idea of a real partner keeps coming up. I miss making a woman feel deeply loved  and everything that comes with a meaningful relationship.

I’m incredibly affectionate, thrive on words of affirmation, and express all love languages. I want someone I can hold and be held by. Someone who loves a deep talk one minute and turns into a complete goof the next. I’m a consistent texter and value clear, kind, and honest communication when things get tough.

A little about me:
I’ve lived coast to coast and always have a bag ready for the next road trip (but let me drive, please). I’m 5’10, tattooed, creative, and can hyper-fixate on an art project for hours thanks to the power of ADHD. I love working with my hands, taking care of people I love, and noticing the little things most people miss.

I’m attracted to femme lesbians. Y’all really make my heart race. ✨ I value a partner who takes care of herself (not asking for a gym rat, just some self-love!). Ideally looking for someone who’s a switch, but I’m happy taking the lead if that’s your comfort zone. Definitely kink-friendly - I’m done with vanilla and ready for something more aligned and expressive.

I love to geek out with games when time allows. I’m down for horror films, documentaries, or a nostalgic Disney night. Music is a constant in my life - I’m rarely without headphones. I propagate plants and give them to people I care about, and my self-care routine is sacred (morning coffee + evening tea = non-negotiable). Being outdoors is my happy place… just not in Arizona heat (lived there, barely survived 😅). 

If you’re kind, communicative, a little flirty, and ready to build something real - I’d love to hear from you. Bonus points if you can match my banter. Let’s see where this goes.

Who did this? My brother hardly ever cooks—and I confirmed that with him. Dad never touches the stove. That left only one person. My father’s wife.

Immediately messaged him so he know who's the real problem.

Sure, forgetting to turn off lights isn't good but almost gassing and burning the house down is bad BAD. Before he wants to lecture my brother over small issue, the closest one to him is the real hazard.

P.S. I woke up 2-3h earlier than usual today and if I decided to skip coffee, who knows what could have happened?

(I promise I read the guides in the stickied posts, they were very helpful!)

I visited Helsinki last september for a week, fell in love. What I loved most was the amount of nature in and around what is a capital city, the amount of trees, space to just walk and relax in. And the fact it's absolutely possible to relax for an afternoon in a public library with a great book, a coffee and pulla. All this is unthinkable where I currently live!

I am originally from the alps, miss snow a lot, so want very much to see Finland in its winter months. Due to work, my only possibility to visit is in the second half of november, I have two weeks. I have seen a few videos about winter cycling in Oulu and fell in love.

My wish would be a non-tourist-packed location, where:

* we can reasonably expect to find some snow in late november (yes I know there is no guarantee, especially in the last years, I'm from a snow place too)
* we do not need a car (I can drive in snow, but car-renting in Finland is above our budget)
* we can do outdoors stuff like cross-country skiing, easy hiking (snowshoes if necessary), and cycling
* we can rent the necessary equipment for the above (looking at Oulu bike rentals, for example, I could only find summer rentals that stop on august 31st)
* we can possibly find lessons for cross-country skiing. I am quite good at downhill skiing but never tried crosscountry, my bf never tried either.
* we really do not care about nightlife or meeting many people, we're boring creatures :D

Would Oulu fit these criteria? Should we aim further north for better snow-chances? Can you think of a place that would fit our plans more?

Not sure this is relevant, but I started studying a bit of Finnish. Atm my skills are barely enough for coffeebar interactions, and asking directions, but I hope to improve a bit by November :)",2,1750417541.0,Finland,8,1.0,False

1lg14jm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lg14jm,Sharing my project budget build coffee table pinball.,"My first attempt at a coffee table pinball build since I got hooked on Williams High Speed 2 at an AirBnB in Budapest a few years ago.  
I'm UK based and sourced quite a few parts from Facebook marketplace which really kept the costs down. Currently around the £230 mark is the running total.

To keeps the build costs particularly low I had been looking at the common Beelink miniPcs to put inside the box, however it occurred to me that my Dell laptop had more processing power and so instead a laptop dock would be a neat solution as it provides the backglass and DMD screens, I just cut some shapes for a laptop bracket out of the leftover rectangle removed from the tabletop/playfield so it all matches.

Parts:

* Pine Blanket box 92 (L) x 46 (W) x 48 (H) £40, Facebook 28"" 
* ASUS UHD 4k Monitor PB287Q £75, Facebook 
* Dell WD19S 130W Docking Station (130W Power Adapter), £38 CEX 
* Player X USB Games Controller PCB, £12, The PiHut 
* 4 x Sanwa Round 30mm Snap-in Arcade Button £9, The PiHut ( 2x blue/grey - tricky to see in the photo mounted at flipper locations ) 2x white for credits and plunger
* 2.8mm/0.11"" Arcade Button Dupont to Spade Wires £4, 
* The PiHut Glass for tabletop £25 4 x castor wheels £5

Software/backglass/DMD running on laptop Dell 5530 i5-1245U which I already owned ( currently £250 from CEX ) Runs at 1080p fine. It can't handle 4k.

As my first build I was running Pinball FX3, but I found it too arcade-y, So I'm now using VisualPinball which I think looks and runs nicer with scope to add more features. There's quite a bit of spare space inside the box still so I'm looking forward to adding an accelerometer for nudging and SSF sound system with exciters for a more mechanical feel. There's still plenty of spare USB ports on the laptop for the accelerometer and USB soundcard.

Thought I'd share at this point for tips on how to progress with SSF and accelerometer.",10,1750417194.0,cade,2,1.0,False
1lg14e8,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyGlowHub/comments/1lg14e8/how_to_establish_an_effective_sleep_routine/,How to Establish an Effective Sleep Routine,"Inadequate sleep not only leaves you fatigued but also impacts your mood, immune system, and weight. Thankfully, improving your sleep can be achieved through a few simple habits.

**1. Establish a Consistent Sleep Schedule**

Aim to go to bed and rise at the same time every day — including weekends. This helps regulate your body’s internal clock.

**2. Develop a Relaxation Routine**

Dedicate 30–60 minutes to unwind. Activities could include reading, stretching, or taking a warm shower. Refrain from using screens during this period.

**3. Reduce Caffeine Intake by 2 PM**

Caffeine lingers in your system for several hours. If you have trouble sleeping, avoid afternoon coffee or soda.

**4. Minimize Blue Light Exposure**

Switch off phones, televisions, and laptops an hour before bedtime. Blue light interferes with melatonin, the hormone responsible for sleep.

**5. Maintain a Cool and Dark Sleeping Environment**

The optimal temperature for sleep is between 65–70°F. Utilize blackout curtains or an eye mask to eliminate light.

***Additional Tip:*** Consider incorporating magnesium-rich foods (such as spinach or almonds) into your evening meals — they may assist in calming your nervous system.

>***Final Note:***

>A regular sleep routine is just as crucial as a healthy diet and exercise. Make rest a priority, and your body will express its gratitude.

## What is Lesoratex App?

Lesoratex App is an **automated trading platform** designed to simplify the process of investing in various financial markets. Think of it like your personal trading assistant—it uses algorithms to analyze market data, identify trends, and execute trades on your behalf. It's especially appealing to folks who don’t want to stare at charts all day but still want a piece of the action.

You can trade **cryptocurrencies, forex, stocks, and even commodities** through the platform. It’s marketed as beginner-friendly, but it also offers tools advanced enough to keep seasoned traders engaged. What makes it stand out is its blend of automation with manual trading options, giving users more flexibility than many cookie-cutter platforms out there.

## Who Created Lesoratex App?

The creators are a bit low-key, which is pretty standard for platforms in the fintech space. However, what we do know is that Lesoratex App was built by a **team of financial analysts, software engineers, and AI developers** who’ve reportedly worked with other well-known trading tools like Bitcoin Code and Immediate Edge.

While the exact individuals behind the app aren’t publicly listed (which I wish they were for transparency's sake), the platform works with **regulated brokers**, which adds a layer of trust. The focus seems to be on building a tool that’s accessible, secure, and powerful enough to compete with bigger names in the auto-trading niche.

## How Does Lesoratex App Work?

At its core, Lesoratex App uses **AI-driven trading algorithms** to scan markets in real-time. It analyzes tons of market data—price trends, volume spikes, historical patterns—and then places trades based on parameters you set or it recommends.

Here’s what happens behind the scenes:

- You sign up and fund your account.
- The app connects you with a **broker** who executes trades.
- The trading bot scans markets and suggests or places trades automatically.
- You can toggle between manual and auto-trading modes.

This setup is great if you want to automate your trading but still have the option to step in and make decisions.

## Lesoratex App Pros and Cons

Let’s keep it real. No app is perfect. Here’s what I liked and what could be better:

**Pros:**
- ✅ Easy to use, even for beginners
- ✅ Fast sign-up and account funding
- ✅ Supports a wide range of assets (crypto, forex, stocks)
- ✅ Offers a demo account for practice
- ✅ 24/7 customer service
- ✅ Flexible trading—manual or automated

**Cons:**
- ❌ Requires a $250 minimum deposit to get started
- ❌ Limited information on the founding team
- ❌ No in-app social trading or copy trading (yet)

Overall, the pros definitely outweigh the cons, but transparency and more advanced social features would be welcome additions.

Always check their website or ask their support team to confirm availability in your region.

## Lesoratex App – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

This feature is clutch. Lesoratex App processes live data to deliver **real-time trade signals**. The algorithms are trained to spot opportunities based on technical indicators, news events, and historical trends. It’s like having a data scientist working for you 24/7.

### User-Friendly Interface

I’ve used some platforms that felt like decoding the Matrix. Lesoratex isn’t one of them. The **dashboard is clean**, navigation is smooth, and you’re never more than two clicks away from placing a trade. Perfect for people who don’t want to spend hours figuring out how to use the app.

### Mobile Accessibility

The mobile version is surprisingly powerful. You can track trades, get alerts, and even make deposits/withdrawals on the go. Whether you’re stuck on a train or waiting in line for coffee, you can still manage your portfolio like a pro.

Want to be notified when BTC hits a certain price? Or when a trade closes in profit? You can set up **custom alerts** for pretty much anything. This is a great feature if you like to stay informed without being glued to your screen.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Lesoratex isn’t just for crypto. You can trade **forex pairs, stocks, indices, and commodities** too. This kind of diversification is rare in beginner-friendly apps and helps you spread your risk across different markets.

## Is Lesoratex App a Scam?

Nope, not a scam.

While I always recommend a healthy dose of skepticism with any trading platform, **Lesoratex App checks the key boxes**:

- Works with regulated brokers
- Transparent about risks
- Offers a demo account for testing
- Withdrawals are processed within 24–48 hours

It’s not promising overnight riches or Lambos—which, ironically, makes it more trustworthy.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Lesoratex App?

You’ll need to deposit **$250** to activate your live account. This is pretty standard in the industry and aligns with platforms like **Bitcoin Era and Immediate Edge**.

You can start with the demo version, but to actually trade live and withdraw profits, that initial deposit is required.

### Lesoratex App Customer Support

Customer support is where Lesoratex App really shines. They offer:

- **24/7 live chat**
- **Email support**
- **Phone callbacks (in some regions)**

During testing, I reached out with a couple questions and got answers in less than five minutes. That’s faster than most exchanges I’ve used.

## How do you start trading on Lesoratex App?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Head to the Lesoratex App website and fill out the **registration form**. You’ll just need your name, email, and phone number. No credit card required at this stage.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

After signing up, you’ll get matched with a **partner broker**. You’ll need to verify your identity (standard KYC stuff), and then you can fund your account with a **minimum of $250**.

### Step 3: Start Trading

Once your account is funded, you can access the **demo or live trading dashboard**. Pick your assets, set your parameters, and let the app do its thing—or take the wheel yourself.

## How to Delete a Lesoratex App Account?

If you decide to step away, deleting your account is simple:

- Contact support via live chat or email
- Request a full account deletion
- Withdraw any remaining funds before closing

They’ll process it within a few days. No shady tricks or hidden fees.

Lesoratex App is a **solid option** for anyone looking to dip their toes into trading—or even for intermediate users seeking a more streamlined experience. It’s not perfect, but the **intuitive design, strong feature set, and real-time analysis** make it worth trying.

The $250 deposit might be a small hurdle, and I’d love to see more transparency about the team behind it. But overall, it's one of the better platforms I’ve tested in 2024.

Wednesday I thought it would be a good idea to have a latte coffee, milk really does upset my stomach, so Wednesday afternoon many trips to the loo were needed. As we were going out Wednesday night I took an Imodium tablet, which worked for the evening. But at 3am I woke with terrible stomach cramps and by 4:30 was also vomiting and the food looked totally undigested. (chicken, Peppers, Carrots and a small amount of rice)

By 09:30 I have stopped being sick, still needing the loo a lot. Drinking loads of water and taking a rehydration sachet . Things calmed down a little and then I thought it would be better to have something light for lunch so choose a protein yoghurt. This upset my stomach again and i was in the loo every half and hour. I ate a small dinner (chicken and salad) took 3 does of Peto Bismol and by midnight felt able to go to bed.

Today I feel absolutely fine again.

My question is, I am due to fly to the USA on Thursday next week, do I take dose number 2 on Tuesday in the hope that I did stupid things by having milk products I usually avoid or do I assume that this is my body getting used to to the mounjarouk and not chance that reaction on a plane

There’s not a ton of public info about the exact team behind Solid Max, which is pretty common with platforms like this. However, the software appears to be built by a **group of fintech developers and trading experts** who previously worked on similar platforms like Bitcoin Code and Immediate Edge.

From what I’ve gathered, it operates in partnership with **regulated brokers** who handle the actual trade execution and account management. So while Solid Max handles the automation and interface, your funds are technically managed through licensed third-party brokers.

## How Does Solid Max Work?

Solid Max uses **AI algorithms and trading bots** to scan the market in real-time. It looks for trends, price movements, and trading signals, then automatically places trades that match your chosen settings. You don’t need to code or manually analyze charts – Solid Max handles the heavy lifting.

Here’s the workflow:
- You sign up and connect with a broker.
- Deposit funds (minimum $250).
- Set your trading preferences: asset types, risk level, trade size.
- Turn on auto-trading.
- The bot monitors the market and executes trades on your behalf.

You can also switch to manual mode if you want more control, but honestly, the automation is what most people are here for.

## Solid Max – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

Solid Max constantly monitors markets using **AI algorithms** that evaluate trends, news, and price movements. This helps it make smarter trading decisions faster than the average human could.

You don’t need to know technical indicators or read charts – the system does that for you. That said, if you’re more advanced, you can customize what it looks for.

### User-Friendly Interface

The interface is **super clean** and intuitive. Even if you’ve never traded before, you can navigate the dashboard easily. You’ll see your balance, active trades, earnings, and settings all in one place.

It’s not overloaded with confusing charts or jargon, which is a huge win for beginners.

Trading on the toilet? Yup, totally doable.

This is perfect for people who want to stay informed but not glued to the screen.

- **Forex pairs**
- **Stocks**
- **Commodities** like gold and oil

That’s a big plus if you want to diversify your trades or explore different markets.

## Is Solid Max a Scam?

This is the million-dollar question.

From my own experience and research, I’d say **Solid Max is legit**, but like any trading platform, there are risks. It partners with **licensed brokers**, offers customer support, and doesn’t make unrealistic profit promises (which is a good sign).

BUT – and this is important – **it’s still trading**. The markets are volatile, and **no bot can guarantee profits**. Anyone who says otherwise is probably scamming you. So yes, Solid Max is a real platform, but you should still use it wisely and never invest more than you can afford to lose.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Solid Max?

The **minimum deposit is $250**, which is pretty standard for trading bots.

This money is used to fund your trading account. You can deposit via:
- **Credit/debit card**
- **Bank transfer**
- **Crypto (in some regions)**

It’s not a fee – you can trade with it or withdraw it later if you change your mind.

### Solid Max Customer Support

Solid Max offers **24/7 customer support**, which you can reach via:
- **Live chat**
- **Email**
- **In-platform support ticket system**

I tested the chat out twice and got a reply in under 2 minutes both times. That’s better than most platforms I’ve used.

## How do you start trading on Solid Max?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the Solid Max website and fill out the short sign-up form. They ask for your name, email, and phone number. No long questionnaires or KYC at this stage.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

Once you’re in, you’ll be matched with a broker. You’ll need to verify your identity (usually by uploading a photo ID) and then make your **$250 deposit**.

### Step 3: Start Trading

After funding, you can access the platform dashboard. You can either:
- **Use the demo mode** to get familiar with the tools.
- Or jump into **live auto-trading** with real funds.

Set your risk levels, asset preferences, and let it do its thing.

## The Verdict

So, is Solid Max worth it?

If you’re looking for a **user-friendly, automated trading platform** that doesn’t require a PhD in finance, Solid Max is a solid choice. It’s not perfect – the secrecy around the devs and the required deposit might turn some people off – but the features, support, and ease of use make it a good option for beginners and casual traders.

Just remember: **no trading platform is risk-free**, and automation doesn’t mean guaranteed profits. But if you use it wisely and start small, Solid Max could be a useful tool in your trading toolbox.

On a sunny February day, Daisy drove down a highway through the golden wheat fields of Kansas with Carter in his Porsche 356/2 Gmünd Cabriolet. With the top down, Daisy's laughter filled the air as the wind blew through her hair, tickling her scalp. But she stopped seeing the look of abject terror on Carter's face.

""C-carter, sweetie, are you okay?""

""No, red, I don't think I am. I just realized I'm about to meet your mother for the first time, and I didn't bring so much as a gift.""

""Don't worry about that. Be your usual gentlemanly self, and Ma will love you. I have more to worry about than you.” Daisy spotted a mile marker, realizing they were still far from their destination. ”Carter, please stop the car.""

As Carter heard Daisy, he stopped the car in the middle of the highway, driving off the road to the side away from any potential traffic. And she held his hands as she looked at him with a frown covering her face, though not the one Carter recognized.

""I've been too cowardly to ask, but now it's do or die. When you all assumed I was dead. How did Aisha and Belle take it?""

""I wish I could tell you. I learned from Belle when she sent me a letter. And maybe it was wrong, but I didn't keep in touch with them.” Carter took his hand from Daisy, placing it over his face. “When I thought you died, it felt like life didn't have meaning anymore. Except maybe for finishing the war and getting revenge.""

""Carter, let's promise ourselves something right now. No matter what happens in this war. We fight for justice and not revenge.""

""There's a difference?""

Daisy grew a scowl, pulling Carter’s hand from his face to see fury like he had never witnessed before from his lover.

""Justice is about doing what's necessary to protect the innocent. However, revenge is getting hedonistic pleasure from inflicting harm on another.""

As Carter heard Daisy, he looked at her with a nod followed by a small smile. Seeing him, her scowl disappeared, her usual light-filled smile replacing it. 

Daisy kissed Carter. ”Let’s keep going.”

“Yes, ma’am.” Carter gently brushed Daisy’s chin with his hand.

\*\*\*

Carter’s car stopped as their journey was at an end. The two exited the vehicle holding hands as they cautiously walked forward. The couple gazed intensely at their destination, Lilyville. And a great silence spawned between them as neither knew the words to comment on the settlement that stood before them. In many ways it was simple, but it was that purest of simplicity that made it stand out from among the other fantastic places they knew.

It was a small rustic midwestern town in the middle of a vast green field adorned with hundreds of heavenly peace lilies and sunflowers. The scent of the flowers bombarded Daisy with a wave of nostalgia for her upbringing. She looked toward the fields, remembering the community celebrations, the church functions, and family picnics. It was a homely and peaceful land devoid of even the tiniest trace of the violent war outside its border. Almost detached from the rest of time as it marched forward for everywhere else.

Daisy cried. *""Home at last.""*

""I've never been anywhere like this before. And Daisy, do you hear that?""

Daisy positioned her ear to listen. ""I don't hear anything but the birds.""

""That's just it. There are no cars, trucks, or people shouting. It's as quiet as a grave.""

Daisy giggled. ""You'll get used to it, city boy.""

Daisy took Carter's hand and led him to her town, cracking a nervous smile. The couple swiftly approached Aisha's house. Every step Daisy took required herculean willpower, but as she got close, she faltered. However, with one kind look, Carter restored her resolve, and Daisy moved forward. But they stopped again momentarily as Daisy heard two familiar voices, Aisha and her father, Devon, participating in a shouting match.

*""Girl, leave this house and do something with your life,""* Devon shouted.

""Daddy, what's the point? My best friend is dead, and nothing matters. I wish I had died too.""

Aisha stormed out of her house and slammed the door behind her. She quickly burst out in a rage, beating the door until she broke down crying, a sorrowful mess on the ground. Daisy looked at Aisha, miserable, and hurried over to her friend. She quickly reached Aisha and made her look at her. But as Aisha saw Daisy, she crawled away, her face losing color.

*""My god, a ghost,""* Aisha said, terrified.

As Daisy heard Aisha, she took her hands.""Feel my hands, Aisha. I'm alive and well. So please don't say things like you want to die.""

Aisha quickly took note of Daisy’s hands. Unlike a spirit’s, her hands were warm and solid and she could notice the tremor of a pulse in her wrists. Her old friend was indeed alive. Aisha looked at Daisy as if she hadn’t seen her in eternity. Her eyes released a flood of tears, this time ones of joy, and she hugged Daisy tightly. Daisy reciprocated everything Aisha did. And the two young women clung to each other as they balled out on the ground.

\*\*\*

Daisy walked through the town with Carter and Aisha, heading toward her childhood house. As they made their way to the David family farm, they drew the gaze of the townspeople. And seeing Daisy back from the dead, they all hurried behind her to get an explanation for the miracle.

Meanwhile, Belle was still in bed even as the afternoon was minutes away. Surviving the deaths of her father and younger sister left her life without meaning. The young woman wallowed in her misery with her unkempt hair, malnourished body, and dirty nightgown in the loose bed sheets. She wanted nothing more than to spend the rest of her days sleeping. But as Belle tossed and turned, she tumbled off the bed and hit the floor face-first. Belle burst into a crying fit until she heard a commotion outside. Using the last vestiges of her sanity, Belle struggled to her feet and staggered to a window to check. She saw Daisy outside with the crowd of townspeople, and life returned to her dead eyes

Belle dashed into the living room to her mother, Mary, on her chair. Mary was the spitting image of Belle but with Daisy's long, blood-red hair tied loosely at the end in a ponytail. She stared off into space, with her sunken, malnourished cheeks, clutching a frame with Daisy's baby picture inside as if it were the real thing. Like her eldest daughter, surviving her husband, Joseph, and Daisy’s deaths robbed her of much of her sanity. But Belle grabbed her hand, dragging her out of the living room.

Outside, Daisy prepared to open the front door. However, before she could, Belle and Mary ran out. And life quickly returned to Mary’s face as she saw Daisy standing before her.

Mary cried. *""By the lord in heaven, he raised you from the dead and sent you back to us.""*

""I-I never died, Ma.""

""What?""

""It's a long story, but I managed to escape the Nemesis. I wanted to call you all sooner, but things happened.” Daisy cried, wiping tears from her eyes. “I am so incredibly sorry for putting you all through this torture. Can you ever find it in your hearts to f-"".

Belle and Mary swiftly grabbed Daisy, giving her a monstrous hug. They fell to their knees, holding each other tightly, and Aisha burst into tears upon seeing them. As Mary saw Aisha crying, she dragged her into it.

""B-but I don't understand. How can you forgive me so easily?""

""Sissy, you're back with us, so nothing else matters.""

""Your sister took the words right out of my mouth.""

""Ma, in that case, can you do something for me?”

“What?”

“Please make some of your delicious apple pie?""

Mary giggled.""Of course, sweetie, anything you want.""

The family continued to embrace each other more joyously than before. When the townspeople saw them, they burst into a loud celebration. But Carter stood close by quietly, wiping small tears of joy from his eyes, seeing the happy family together again.",0,1750416781.0,HFY,2,0.5,False

A few days later, the United Planets soldiers stood together in a cemetery on the jungle planet. They stood victorious, but after paying a mighty cost. They gazed at the graves of legions of their comrades teary-eyed.

Orion walked before the crowd of his soldiers his steps slow but deliberate.

""We come here today to bid farewell to our comrades. This war has cost us all lovers, family, and friends. But we must not let these hardships break us.”

Orion glanced over to Damara standing in the front of the crowd with Sarah and Lucas, wiping tears from her eyes.

“Wounds to the mind and spirit are just as devastating as those to the body. Despair is one of the many weapons our enemy wields against us. But it only has as much power as we give it.”

The soldiers gave Orion applause, clapping.

“Let us go forth and make E-. Let us go forth and make all those we have lost proud by fighting with honor and integrity.”

Again, the soldiers gave Orion applause, clapping but louder.

“For our loved ones, we must soldier on to the dream. A peaceful and free galaxy."" 

The soldiers clapped once more at Orion's speech but even louder than before as he turned his back to them, staring at Everton’s grave, his dearest friend.

\*\*\*

Later, Daisy walked alone with Orion, Sarah, and Lucas.

""Your speech was beautiful, Orion. But still, Everton is gone,"" Daisy said, sorrowfully.

""He will outlive us all, Daisy. For his sacrifice has ensured the longevity of freedom.""

""I hate to leave things like this, but I want to go home now. I want to find my loved ones, hug them, and never let go. Especially now, Carter must be returning from the siege on darkhold.""

Orion shook as he heard Daisy. ""Is there a darkhold fortress on Earth?""

""Yes, why?""

""You humans wouldn't know this, but a darkhold fortress is a nearly indestructible doomsday device. If it becomes fully functional, that entire part of space will belong to Mavor.""

*""Carter,”* Daisy said, terrified.

Daisy ran off to get home at top speed, but as Sarah saw her, she sprinted over to Orion.

""Oh, my gods. Boss, if this is true, we should back her up.""

""Sarah, we're in no shape for another battle. The generals are still busy. And we haven't fully treated our mental and physical wounds, "" Lucas said.

The group quickly noticed that Daisy had stopped running as light surrounded her. It flew off her body, taking the form of a noble stallion before her. The stallion had pure white fur, large bird-like wings, and a mane that quickly became red flames.

""I-I can hear your voice in my head. You're here to help me,"" Daisy said.

Daisy swiftly spotted a mount on the stallion and jumped onto him. The stallion flew Daisy up, carrying her away from the planet. But as she pulled on his reigns, she stopped him and waved goodbye to Orion, Lucas, and Sarah. And they reciprocated as she left.

""Farewell, Damara, and safe travels,"" Orion said.

In space, Daisy flew from the planet. However, she stopped, looking back at it teary-eyed.""Goodbye, Everton."" Forcibly turning her gaze away, she continued her journey, leaving a trail of tears.

\*\*\*

A red streak raced through the galaxy, cutting across the stars with nearly unparalleled urgency. Daisy traveled at light speed on the back of the stallion, approaching her world as a hardened warrior.

The Grand Army of Earth and the Nemesis continued their brutal conflict. But the massive Nemesis battleships bombarded the humans, guarding the construction of the darkhold fortress. Morana watched the human soldiers from the control center with a smile. The ships in her fleet rained heavy plasma bombardment on the humans, tearing their forces apart.

Daisy swiftly flew into the sky over the war zone, seeing the carnage. She grew her shield to a giant size and tossed it at one of the Nemesis ships, a vessel eight hundred and sixty-three feet long, cleaving it in two. Daisy guided her shield through the air, cutting through the rest of the Nemesis fleet like paper, and the sky was a blaze from their destruction like a sun went supernova.

Morana watched the destruction of her army in disbelief. But as she spotted Daisy on the security screen, it turned to a searing scowl.

*“Who the chaos is that?”* Morana shouted.

Outside, Daisy quickly landed, forcing the Nemesis infantry to retreat. But as she approached the humans, they brandished their weapons for trouble.

""Please, don't be afraid. My name is Damara, and I'm here to help.""

""And why should we believe that?""

As Daisy heard a familiar voice, her heart skipped a beat as her eyes confirmed her beloved Carter.

*""Carter. You don't recognize me either, do you?""* Daisy thought.

""Well, answer the question, you freakish dame. You may be an enemy of the Nemesis, but that doesn't guarantee you're a friend of ours.""

""I am a friend. And I know about you, C-captain Barnes.""

""How exactly?""

""T-that doesn't matter right now. What does is you're a good man. One that would make sure every soldier in your command got home safe. So I beg you to let me help.""

Carter looked around at his soldiers, seeing them bloody, bruised, and missing limbs. And he let off a sigh and groan. ""I'm going to regret this."" Signaling his acceptance of Damara’s offer.

""No, you won't. I swear on my life.""

Carter drew his sword, placing it inches away from decapitating Daisy, inches from ending his beloved’s life without knowing it, faster than she could perceive. He looked at her with a cold, dead gaze.""Remember your words."" Finally, removing his sword from her neck. 

""Okay, Damara, let's talk Strategy.""

Later, in the control center, there was chaos. The Nemesis ran frantically, trying to complete their jobs with Morana's cold, ruthless gaze as motivation.

""I want this fortress at full power now. The emperor believes this part of space will make a valuable, strategic asset. Make me fail him at your peril."" Morana spat.

A soldier ran to Morana.

""General, we have a progress report. The fortress will be fully functional in ten minutes.""

""Finally something going r-""

Two massive explosions went off and shook the room. Morana grew a look of bewilderment as she felt the shockwaves, but it quickly turned to glare, directing it at her personnel.

""I have a hundred people here. One of you better tell me what that was.""

""General, we have confirmation. The enemy has caused a massive escape in the slave barracks and is making their way to the power conduit.""

""What? The humans don't have enough soldiers left to attack both. Get me a visual of the power conduit.""

At her beck and call, a massive holophone panel appeared in midair. The panel showed the room the battle at the power conduit. The Nemesis soldiers charged Daisy and Carter by the thousands with murderous drive. But the two’s combined fighting powers decimated their opponents in seconds. Morana gazed at the act, releasing a burst of cold so chilling it could frostbite the soul.

Meanwhile, Daisy readied her shield to attack the enemy, but Carter signaled her to stop. He walked to the approaching hoard, drawing his sword. Carter's walk swiftly became a run, hurrying to the Nemesis. He met their numbers with the rapid glimmer of his blade, cutting through them like paper. Carter swung his sword with such speed and intensity the glimmer reflected off his weapon and appeared as if it was from thirty swordsmen, not one.

Daisy watched the army fall to ruin in shock, for even she was ignorant of her beloved's true strength. However, she came to her senses as a squad of armored soldiers appeared, unleashing a salvo at Carter. Daisy summoned her giant shield in front of him, blocking the attack, and she launched it at them, knocking them away.

A Nemesis soldier came behind Daisy to shoot her dead, but Carter cut him down in an instant.""Thanks, Damara.""

""Same to you.""

Daisy and Carter reached their destination. And Carter pointed to the control panel in front of them.

""There it is, Damara. All we have to do is enter a code and press the big green button. And boom.""

*""Please let it work this time.""* Daisy thought.

""This operation demands split-second timing. Carter, do you think your soldiers will be able to evacuate all the slaves?"" Daisy asked out loud.

""With luck.""

""You ran out of luck when you challenged my emperor, vermin."" Morana descended upon Daisy and Carter, hovering just above them.

""Morana Blight. Where's the strike squad?"" Carter asked.

""I thought about that, but then I realized I wanted to exterminate you myself. You have impeded emperor Mavor's utopic vision for too long. No one will have the pleasure of ending your lives but me.""

As she heard Morana, Daisy didn't waste a second, tossing her giant shield at her, but Morana caught it effortlessly. Daisy’s jaw dropped, her mouth bending into a frown as she saw it, but she quickly summoned back her shield, readying for any assault. Daisy realized a battle unlike any she had endured stood before her. And the lives of her lover, her family, her planet, and perhaps the galaxy hung in the balance.

She had a boyfriend at the time (for about 2–3 years), so nothing happened between them. But, she did flirt a lot and mentioned she wanted to hurt her boyfriend back because she chose to stay with him after he cheated on her…so she’s reach out and flirt with my husband and it was mutual After the military, they were both single—and she told him she also had feelings for him but that’s when I came into his life. He ultimately chose to be with me instead of pursuing her.

But this woman has always been a point of tension. In the beginning of our relationship, he would compare me to her, and it really messed with my self-esteem. I didn’t like her from the jump because of that. Eventually I gave him an ultimatum: her or me. He said he chose me and cut her off.

Except… he didn’t. Not really.

He went behind my back multiple times to keep her in his life. He even vented to her about me. I reacted emotionally, yeah—I was hurt and angry. We fought about it. But then things quieted down… until recently.

A few weeks ago, he went out with her for drinks at around 10 p.m. She told him she had dinner plans with her mom, so I guess drinks came after that. He ended up taking her to a coffee shop afterward. She had Ubered there, so he felt “obligated” to drive her back to her place.

He knew I wouldn’t be okay with that, but did it anyway. Before she got out of the car, she literally said, “I’d invite you in, but I know I put your wife through a world of hell tonight.”
Like… what?! Who says that??

She’s baited him before too—once told him she was “scared to live alone” (which I’ve brought up to him), and she always finds ways to keep a connection going. When I express discomfort, he dismisses it. He tells me I’m “delusional” or “too emotional” because I didn’t have serious relationships before him. It’s honestly make me feel gaslit.

After that hangout, he insisted I meet her to “ease the tension.” So we went out—me, him, and her—for dinner and hookah. She was nice to my face, and even invited us to her family’s cabin. But a few days later, she texted him saying it felt “weird” to be around us as a couple. We never went out with her again. Every plan after that fell through—either she bailed, or we said no because my husband doesn’t like large crowds so a parade/costume party was too much, but he said given her a maybe.

Fast-forward to now. He says she’s acting “unlike herself” and wants to see her again to “check in” and hang out one-on-one. He even told me that if he can’t hang out at her place, then “what’s the point of the friendship?”
I said absolutely not. After a long argument, I stupidly agreed to let him hang with her in public for an hour. 

Since then, he’s been swiping up on her stories and complimenting her. He says it’s “harmless.” But I’ve also caught him in shady behavior with other women before—like a classmate (20F) from an online class. He didn’t tell her he was married, and when he finally did, she ghosted him. When I called that out as an emotional affair, he denied it. There have been older other instances which I won’t list since we’ve worked on it and moved past them.

Every time I bring up my concerns, he gaslights me, says it’s in my head, that I need to “grow up.” He claims he doesn’t have feelings for this girl—but also admits she was his “first love” and that “she means a lot to him.”

I’ve stuck it out for seven years. I just graduated, and we were talking about starting a family soon. But he still has trouble calling me beautiful, still talks about having “FOMO” over other women during fights, and even when I catch him staring at women, I brush it off. We haven’t been smooth sailing and he tells me it’s my fault because of my doubts in trusting him and picking fights out of the blue.

I love him. Truly. I don’t see myself with anyone else. But I’m also realizing…I don’t want this to be the rest of my life.

AITA for finally considering divorce? Or am I being too emotional?
I need outside perspective. Please be honest.",24,1750416429.0,AITAH,60,0.84,False
1lg0wja,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lg0wja,Prada cups of HipoBuy-review,"W2C: [https://hipobuy.com/product/weidian/7413632516](https://hipobuy.com/product/weidian/7413632516)

I recently got the Prada cups, and I’m honestly impressed. The design is super elegant and minimalistic – just what you’d expect from a luxury brand like Prada. They look and feel high-end, with a smooth finish and solid build quality.

The logo is clean and well-placed, not too flashy but still makes a statement. These cups are perfect for anyone who likes stylish kitchenware or wants to add a touch of luxury to their daily coffee or tea routine.

Overall, I’d say they’re worth it if you’re into designer pieces and quality. Definitely not your average cup – it’s Prada.

1lg0w4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lg0w4c/alpha_nicholas_your_ass_should_have_been/,"Alpha Nicholas: Your ass should have been downstairs over 30 minutes ago, and now it's going to pay. I don't know why you do this to yourself every goddam time! ""I do sometimes wonder how my dad can help lead this pack as the Beta with how stupid he can be. Does he seriously think that I hid in.....","Chapter1: Bonnie

If you don't get your goddam ass down here right now, I swear to the Moon Goddess herself I'm going to get my fucking belt out and make you sorry!"" My dad's voice sends chills down my spine and has my entire body shaking knowing the pain that it's going to endure very soon. My dad means what he says and, thanks to my prick of a brother, my punishment will be even more painful than normal. If I have to come and get you, you know what will happen mutt!"" He keeps bellowing while I shift myself further backward in my closest while praying for a miracle or, at the very least, for a giant hole to appear in these old floorboards and swallow me whole. Of course, reality wouldn't be as kind as to create a hole for me. No, my reality will result in pain and a lot of it. Where the fuck are you!"" His voice suddenly seems so close and a growl that can only belong to that of a Beta suddenly has the walls around me shaking. Shit, he's here! ""This is your last chance to come out mutt. If you don't, you know what will happen!"" He knows I'm here, but he wouldn't be my dad if he didn't take the time to taunt me that little bit more. It doesn't matter if I go out there now or let him find me either way, my punishment will have me suffering in pain for more than a few days. Your ass should have been downstairs over 30 minutes ago, and now it's going to pay. I don't know why you do this to yourself every goddam time! ""I do sometimes wonder how my dad can help lead this pack as the Beta with how stupid he can be. Does he seriously think that I hid in my closet and chose not to go downstairs and make breakfast knowing that he would come and find me and make me pay all by choice? No, I didn't, but it won't matter what my reason is for being here, he won't believe me, he won't care. Well, hello there little mutt."" I feel the air leave my lungs as he tears open the door and lunges at me, grabbing my shirt and throwing me across the room. A grunt leaves my mouth as blinding pain shoots down my spine from hitting the wall, along with the impact winding me has, this day is off to a cracking start. And yes, I know what you're thinking. Werewolves have amazingly quick healing abilities and while that may be true, unfortunately, that's not always the case, and of course, as with everything else in my life that goes wrong, so does having that ability. A healthy wolf can heal quickly but not an unhealthy one, and I'm the definition of an unhealthy wolf. I cough as I try to catch my breath, but before I've even drawn in my first full breath, my dad is back on me and pulling me off the ground by the neck of my shirt. He roughly shakes me before screaming in my face, causing spittle to land on my forehead, nose, and chin, forcing me to hold in a gag. ""Well, come on mutt. Won't you at least try and come up with some pathetic excuse to cover your ass? While most of the beatings that I get from my dad are caused by my brother, I try not to mention his name and instead, make up another excuse, any excuse because, in this household, my brother is the top, golden child and, as far as my father is concerned, he never does anything wrong and if I try and say different he sees red and just ups my punishment. However, sometimes I just can't think of an excuse quickly enough and my Dad tolerates no answer, even less than me mentioning my brother's name, so that is what I have to do. I have to tell the truth and today seems like one of those days. ""Rowan... Rowan locked me in my closet."" As expected, his face turns an even darker shade of red as he once again roughly shakes me before throwing me across the room. Only this time I crash into the window and cry out as it shatters and several shards impale my skin. Look at what you made me do now. You stupid worthless piece of shit!"" He storms over to me while I try to remove a large piece of glass out of the palm of my hand. He gets a tight grip on my hair and pulls backward until I'm forced to look up at his face, while at the same time, he moves my hand away, stopping me from pulling out the glass, and then he pushes down on it, making it impale even deeper into the palm of my hand and causing me to cry out. I'll never understand why you were born but the sooner you die, the better!"" I remain quiet while trying to breathe through the pain as he continues to throw venomous words my way, but I don't think he realizes just how wasted those words are on me. All I've ever heard from both him, Blue, and Rowan are vile words and their behavior has been even worse. I'm 18 years old, 18 years of hearing every bad thing imaginable, so yeah, his words do not affect me much anymore, the pain from the beatings is worse than any words he can say... so much worse, and I'm not sure if I'll ever get used to those. The next time you speak badly about your brother, I won't be the only one handling your punishment."" He pulls back his hand right before landing a hard slap to my cheek, causing my vision to blur and my ears to ring. As I said before, he doesn't do well with me, badmouthing his precious son or anyone else, for that matter. Rowan is 20, the future Beta to our pack, and I swear that the boy could fall in shit, and he would still come out smelling like goddam roses. My dad has threatened to have my brother punish me more than once but has never gone through with it. Of course, I don't kid myself into thinking it's because he's protecting me, he's never protected me a day in my life. No, I think it's because he knows that Rowan's temper is even worse than his, and I think he fears that Rowan will lose control and kill me, and if he does that, then who will my dad have to bully and take his anger out on? And of course, how would he explain my disappearance to everyone else? I'm pulled from my thoughts by my dad once again pulling on my hair. It's a favorite thing of his to-do and, honestly, it has me wondering how I don't have bold patches. I wait for the next blow, but then his eyes glaze over as someone's mind links him, and then he suddenly lets go of my hair and takes a step back. ""Get your fucking ass downstairs. Now!"" What the hell is that all about? There must be something big going on for my dad to stop beating me. Nothing ever stops him, not even mind links unless they are seriously important.

The moment he slams my bedroom door shut, tears burst from my eyes and all the pain that I've been ignoring surfaces causing me to shake. ""Come on sweetheart. Get up off of the floor. Let's get you cleaned up."" My wolf Lexis's voice soothes me somewhat as she encourages me. I'll never understand how she's still here with me. I turned 18 six months ago and while I was able to shift fine for the first month since then, I've not been able to. My body is too weak from the beatings and being starved to be able to shift.

I've told Lexi more than once to leave me, to find herself another wolf to live with. It's the least she deserves, but she has always refused. She has been by my side since day one, and I'll always be grateful to her. She is my best friend, my only friend, and honestly, most days she's the only thing that keeps me going. She refuses to leave me and I keep fighting for her but one day... One day this will all be over. I don't know how, but one way or another we will get out of this house and away from this pack, and more importantly, away from the evil that is my dad.

**Chapter2: Bonnie**

I move as quickly as I can to get off of the floor and drag myself to my bathroom to try and clean myself up as best as I can before I go downstairs. The pain in my back is now more of a dull ache, but the cuts from the glass are stinging like a bitch. Luckily for me, most of the cuts aren't very deep and, from what I can see, they don't have any glass in them, so they will heal just fine. However, the one in the palm of my hand is deep and will take much longer to heal.

I winch as I pull out the piece of glass quickly before wrapping a cloth around it to hopefully help slow down the bleeding. ""I'm sorry I can't heal you, Bon Bon."" Lexis's sad voice pulls at my heartstrings. ""It's not your fault, Lex."" As usual, she doesn't agree, but it's the truth. Yes, she's too weak to heal any of my bigger wounds, but she still heals my little ones and more importantly, she is here for me, which means more than she'll ever know.

The reason she can't help me with the bigger wounds is because of how unhealthy I am due to the abuse I receive daily from my dad and brother. Their abuse is also the cause of me being unable to shift and, for a while, I worried that I wouldn't even be able to talk to Lexi, but we do every day, and it's all that I need from her right now.

After more back and forth between us, I manage to convince her of the latter, and she retreats to the back of my mind, although I know it won't be the last time that we have this conversation and that's ok because my words or feelings will never change towards her. I just hope that she continues to stick by me until we can get away from here.

Once I've made quick work of cleaning myself up and wrapping up my hand, I quickly change my shirt and head downstairs to see what's going on. The usual sinking feeling starts up in my stomach as it does every time I walk down the stairs, but there's also some wonder in my head about what my dad wants after that mind-link and I decide to focus on that more than the sinking feeling.

As I reach the bottom of the stairs, I stop to take a moment to say hello to my Mom and kiss the picture of her that's hanging on the wall. There are several pictures of her around the house, but this is one of my favorite ones of her. She looks so young and carefree and, more than anything, happy. I never met her, but somehow, every time I look at this picture of her, I feel like I know her. I've also been told endless stories about my mom, which helps me picture her and imagine her life.

My mom and dad were lucky enough to meet just after they both turned 18 and were mated and married within two months and then, 8 months later, my brother Rowan was born. Just over 2 years later, my twin sister Blue and I were born. Unfortunately, Mom was ill while she was pregnant with us, and giving birth was too much for her body. After giving birth to Blue she died, meaning they had to cut me out of my Mom's stomach after she had died.

She was my Dad's world, her and Rowan's, and when she died he was left without his mate and a single dad of three children under 3 years old and devastated. I haven't met my mate yet, so I can't even begin to imagine what he went through. Even after everything he's put me through, I still feel sad that he lost his mate.

They say that when a wolf loses their mate it can make them go insane, sometimes even kill themselves, and while my dad didn't ever resort to harming himself, I often wondered if the death of my mother did make him go insane, but just a different kind of insane to the normal. Usually, when a wolf goes insane they turn nasty towards everyone around them, and while my dad doesn't behave like that, it doesn't stop me from wondering if maybe he has a different form of being insane in which he manages to keep it hidden from the world and just take it out on me.

You see, I may be a twin, but my sister and I may as well live in different homes, in different packs, even because, whereas I'm treated like a piece of shit that's on the bottom of my Dad's shoe, my sister is treated like a princess. Yes, both my brother and sister are my dad's golden children, while I'm the leftover trash that he's never wanted, not since the day I was born anyway.

From what I have been told, my dad was incredibly excited to be welcoming twin girls into the world. He and my mom already had a little boy and had decided that two daughters following made the perfect number of children and that they would be happy to stop with us, but then the day came that my mom went into labor with us a month before her due date and died just minutes after Blue's birth.

It's said that my mom had unknowingly been suffering from a bleed on her brain and, after the stress of giving birth to Blue naturally, her body gave out, but they managed to get me out in time, a few more minutes and I would have died too. My dad couldn't look at either my sister or me for several days, but when he finally did, he instantly hated me. He said that it was my fault that my mom had died, that I had somehow caused her death, despite several doctors telling him that it wasn't the case, that she had been suffering for weeks and would have died either way, he still didn't listen and has still always hated me and blamed me all because I was the last one to be born.

""Bonnie, come along."" My dad has his polite father voice on which means someone important is here. It's the only time he's ever any kind of decent to me, and they are the moments that I enjoy every second of. Sad, I know, but when you spend your entire life being hated and abused you learn to take any opportunity you can to enjoy the quiet moments of peace and no pain.

I pick up my pace and quickly reach the living area to find my dad sitting on the couch with my sister and brother while Alpha Harold sits across from them with another man who I don't recognize. ""Hello, Bonnie."" Alpha Harold greets me with his usual warm smile and, as always, it has me fighting back my tears at how such little kindness makes me feel.

Alpha Harold has been the Alpha to the Green Rock pack for the last 25 years and is one incredible Alpha. He runs a brilliant pack and shows every single member of his pack nothing but love and kindness, and I have no doubt that if he knew what my dad was doing to me, he would lose his shit. There have been so many times that I have wanted to tell him,, there have even been moments where I have been standing outside his office door ready to knock, but then my dad's words would always ring loud in my head stopping me from doing it.

My dad has always told me that if I tell anyone, then he will kill my grandmother April. She is my mom's mother and even though we haven't seen her in over 10 years, I still love her deeply. She left the pack after she decided that she was done with pack life and wanted to finish out her days out in the forest in a cabin, just her and her pet dog. I'm not sure why she chose that life, but from what I have been told, she was never the same after my mother died.

I remember visiting her often when we were little and even though she never showed us much love in a physical way, she was always polite to us and was never mean or abusive to me. She never knew what my dad was doing because he was always good at hiding my bruises, and after she left the pack, he cut off all contact with her. But despite all of that, I still love her and that thought of him hurting her has always and will always be enough to keep me quiet.

**Chapter3: Bonnie**

""Are you ok, Bonnie? Alpha's voice brings me back to the present and along with it a wave of embarrassment that I zoned out in the presence of our Alpha. ""Sorry, Alpha. Yes, I am great, thank you. How are you doing today?"" He nods smiling. ""I'm perfect thanks, Bonnie. Please take a seat. I'd like to discuss something with you. I know you and Blue have school, so I won't keep you long.""

I nod at Alpha Harold and then take a seat next to Blue. She treats me the same as my dad and brother, but it's the obvious seat to sit in. ""Is everything ok, Alpha?"" I can see the confusion on my dad's face as to why the Alpha is here. Usually, as a Beta to the pack, he would know about any issues that need raising before the Alpha either personally address them or has him do it, but it's clear to see that he has no idea about what's going on right now, and I can imagine he is pissed about it.

""Yes Beta, everything is fine. We have already spoken about this issue, but I just wanted to personally address it and see if I could be of any help,"" I watch as realization washes over him, and for a second he looks pissed, but he does his best to quickly mask it. He knows what this is about and he isn't happy.

""Bonnie, this is Elder Royston. He is visiting on some formal business and decided to join me here today."" I don't know if my dad has met this Elder, but I'm pretty sure the rest of us haven't. ""There's nothing to worry about, so please relax. I just wanted to stop in and remind you about all the ball at the Diamond Pack this weekend and I also wanted a quick chat with you, Bonnie.""

How could I forget about the ball? It's all anyone has been speaking about, especially at school. The Alpha of the Diamond pack is hosting the annual Blue Moon Ball this year and everyone is crazily excited. The Blue Moon Ball is hosted every year by different packs. It's a ball designed to help unmated wolves find their mate and, as far as I know, it's usually pretty successful, which is why it has been held once a year for over 100 years. Throw in the fact that the Alpha of the Diamond pack is also unmated, and you have thousands of she-wolves everywhere melting.

""So Bonnie. I have been informed that you will not be attending the ball?"" You're not allowed to attend the ball until you are 18, so this year is the first year that Blue and I are allowed to attend but, of course, my dad had already informed me that I wouldn't be attending. In his words, he won't have me embarrass him and, besides, it's not like my mate is going to want me anyway, so I should stay home and save both myself and my mate from any embarrassment.

""That's right, Alpha. I won't be attending."" He gives me a puzzled look before shaking his head. ""But why?"" I take a moment to think of a reason while also holding in a wince as my dad pinches my hip from around the back of Blue. ""I just don't feel up to going Alpha. We're almost finished with school, and I'm working hard on my last assignment, so I figured that I would stay here and finish that instead.""

It's not a lie as such. I am working hard for school, but that's because I am finishing Blue's assessment. I've already finished mine and handed it in. Hopefully, he doesn't know that. I've also got my own plans for while they are gone. Plans I don't want to cancel.

""You have always been a hard worker when it comes to school, Bonnie. And while I admire that, I'm afraid that your assignment will have to wait until you come home, as I'm here to inform you that, as of this year, it is now mandatory for all wolves of age to attend the Blue Moon Ball. There would need to be a major reason for not going and, sadly, homework isn't it."" Fuck!

I bite back a response and instead smile and nod my head. He gives me a genuine smile and then rises to his feet with Elder Royston following. ""I'm glad that it is settled. Try and look forward to it, Bonnie. I have a feeling that you will have a lot of fun."" I smile, encouraging his words as he says his goodbyes and exits the house, leaving me confused and well scared. Scared of what my dad's going to say.

It won't matter that the Alpha himself is the one who told us about this or that this is now a new wolf law and that I have no choice but to go, it will still somehow be my fault, and he will make me pay for it. After the beating, I received last night and again this morning, I don't think I can handle any more pain right now, but that won't matter to my so-called dad, he will do as he sees fit. It wouldn't be the first time that he blessed me with several beatings in a row and I doubt it will be the last. He'll beat me until I'm unconscious and then just leave me on the floor until I come around so he can restart his torment.

Before the Alpha has even made it out of the house, I try to make a quick exit out of the living room and away from my hell-hole family in the hopes that I can get out of here before they start their shit with me again. Thankfully, I was smart enough to drop my bag by the front door when I came downstairs and could leave without any fuss.

Of course, I'm far from dull, and I know that I'm going to pay for all of this later, but for now... for now, I'm just going to hold my head up high and head to school. There's only one more week left of school and I can't wait to finally be done. Done with school. Done with my so-called family and done with this pack for good!

Thankfully, I make it out of the door, and I'm soon on my way. ""Hey, Bon."" I look up and smile at Lilly as she comes out of her front door. Lilly has been my best friend since her family joined the pack when I was 4, and I couldn't imagine my life without her. She knows everything about my life, she's never judged me or my situation and has always been there for me. Until Lexi came along, Lily was the only good thing in my life and now that I have both of them I feel blessed. I know it probably sounds dull considering the life that I live, but it's true. I wouldn't want to be without either of them.

Lilly is also the reason why I'm still here, the only reason, even though I turned 18 seven months ago. You see, while my life is hell, so is hers. Her dad is also an abusive man who bullies her every day. He was also abusive to her mom until she sadly passed away a few years ago. Just like my situation, the Alpha knows nothing about the abuse, and her dad keeps her injury to where it can be hidden, as does my Dad. While her dad doesn't hit her as often as my dad hits me, I've often wondered if there's more to her abuse than mine. I'm not sure what it is, but there's just something that doesn't quite sit right with me, and one day I hope she confides in me about it.

Since we've been 9 years old, we have planned to leave the pack once we turned 18. Yes, we could run away before then, but that also means they could search for us, and if they found us, we would pay dearly, whereas if we left once we were 18 they couldn't force us back here, and whereas I turned 18 seven months ago, Lilly is still 17, so that's why I'm still here. Although Lilly is turning 18 in two days, it's almost time to leave. We have had our plan in place for several years, and we're all ready to go.

""Bon, I know we were supposed to leave this weekend while everyone was gone, but what if we just use the ball as our getaway?"" I give her a confused look, but she starts speaking again before I can say anything. ""Think about it, Bon. The Diamond Pack is 4 hours away from here. If we can make a new plan and get away from there the night of the ball, we will be able to get a good head start before anyone will even notice that we are gone. I doubt anyone will come looking for us, but still, if they do, we will already be far away. I don't want to wait any longer than necessary. I can't.""

The pain in her eyes is raw and goes straight to my heart. It may be riskier running from the ball, but I also get why she doesn't want to wait any longer because neither do I. ""You're right, Lil. Let's do it. Now we just need to get a new plan together."" She smiles while giving me a side hug. ""Leave it with me, Bon Bon.""

**Chapter4:** 

""This ball is just stupid! What happened to mates just meeting in the usual way? At parties or normal balls like Alpha ceremonies and so on. Why does there need to be a ball just for mates to meet and why the fuck does every pack have to take it in turns to host it? Surely it should be the Alpha's choice!""

""Nice to see your usual happy personality glowing there, brother!"" I flip Shane the middle finger while he laughs his ass off at me. ""I swear the older you get, the more grumpy you become."" I snort at his words while my parents walk into the room, both laughing. They've clearly heard our conversation. Stupid werewolf hearing! ""Fuck off. I'm a dream to be around!"" I grunt while I drink my coffee and try to block his annoying voice out.

""Are you complaining about the ball again, Dad?"" Lottie, my daughter, asks as she walks into the dining area and takes a seat across from me. Lottie will be turning 16 in a few weeks and is my whole world. She has the typical teenage attitude, but I wouldn't change her for the world, even if she is the image of her mother, a woman I'd like to never have to think of again.

""I'm not complaining, just stating a fact."" She laughs as the door once again opens and my other brothers Will and Robbie come strutting in looking a little rough around the edges. ""Is he still complaining about Saturday?"" Will asks, causing everyone around the table to nod and laugh while I shake my head in frustration. I let others have their opinion about things, so why can I have mine? ""Is it that bad, Dad? It's one night and besides... You could meet your mate.""

I smile at the look on her face, but inside my gut churns at the thought. I'm 28 years old and if I was going to meet my mate then it would have happened by now, surely? It's rare for a wolf to not find their mate by my age and even more rare for an Alpha to have not met his mate, but I guess that's just my fate. My parents have been on my ass for the last 10 years to make more of an effort to find her, but if I'm being honest, I don't want to find her, not anymore.

There was a time when I couldn't think of anything better than meeting my mate. It was all I ever thought of but now, well now, it's the last thing that I want to do. For the most part, I'm happy with my life. I'm the Alpha of an incredible pack. I have the best family; a daughter and my best friend, Tony. I'm not short of offers from women, so I have no worries when it comes to fulfilling any kind of need. Why would I want to disturb that?

""After breakfast, I would like a chat with you, son."" I nod toward my Dad, but I already know what he wants to talk to me about, and, as much as I want to tell him to forget it, I have too much respect for him to do it even if I'm going to regret it as soon as the conversation starts up.

Within 30 minutes, breakfast is done, and I'm in my office with my Dad sitting across from me. ""I know what this conversation is going to be about, Dad. I'm not going to change my mind, so please just stop."" He remains quiet for a few seconds while staring at me, making me feel on edge. ""Nicky, it's time."" I stand up pacing around my office while trying to figure out how to make this stop.

""Come in, sweetheart,"" I call out when I sense Lottie close by. She comes in smiling dressed in a dress that is way too short for my liking, but I've learned to pick my battles when it comes to a teenage girl and this isn't one of them. ""Is it ok if I go to the mall with the girls? Hanna's mom will be there too. We're just going to get our nails and hair done for the ball tonight?""

""Of course, sweetheart. Enjoy."" She gives me a look, and before she even says anything I know exactly what she is going to say. ""What's happened to it now?"" I ask her as I take my credit card out of my pocket and hand it to her while placing a kiss on her head. She shrugs her shoulders while doing her best to give me an innocent look, which means she once again lost her card and is waiting for a new one. I swear the girl has to order a new one every few weeks. ""Make sure to keep your phone close and let me know when you are back."" She nods, agreeing before saying goodbye to my dad and slipping back out of the office.

I turn to face my dad and can't help the sigh that leaves my lips. ""I'm happy, Dad. Why change that?"" He studies me for a moment before rubbing his hand down his face. ""I understand what you're saying, son, I do, but I still believe it would be good for you for so many reasons. I know you are still haunted by the past, but that doesn't mean that you can't have everything you're supposed to in your future."" Just the mention of my past makes me instantly pissed. It's been over 15 years since it happened and yet, I still can't seem to let it go.

""You say you're happy, son, but are you? Are you really? I'm not sure that I've ever met a wolf who doesn't want his mate, and I've certainly never met an Alpha who doesn't want his Luna. It's just so unheard of."" He is right, I know this, and maybe deep, deep, deep down inside, there is a small part of me that does want my mate, but I just can't... The thought of suffering again... I just can't do it. As always, my dad seems to sense my thoughts as he takes my silence to mean more. ""Nicky, aside from the obvious stuff, the Elders are not going to let this go.""

""What do they want me to do Dad, just magic up a mate?"" The elders hate it when an Alpha doesn't have a Luna, but what do they expect from me? Even if I did want a mate, I haven't met her yet, so I'm not sure what it is they want of me, unless... ""Please don't tell me they're going to do what I think they are?"" He sighs and then nods, making me feel even more pissed. ""Please, tell me you're kidding me, Dad. Seriously?"" He doesn't look too happy about this, so hopefully, he's on my side in this. ""As much as I want you to have a mate, I want it to be your mate, not a fake one. I said as much to Elder Stone, but I'm afraid he wouldn't listen.""

""So what happens now? Do I even get a choice or will I just be dressed in a suit and taken to meet my future mate at the isle on the day of our wedding without ever meeting her?"" I'm being shitty, and I know it, but I can't help it. I know it's not my father's fault and I appreciate that he tried to help, but he's currently the only one in the room and therefore on the brunt end of my shitty behavior.

I slump down in my chair while I run my hand down my face. ""So not only do I have to host a ball that I don't want, but I also have to face she-wolves who are mateless and ready to be my Luna? Dad, do you realize how insane this is? What's to say that some of them won't just be heartless bitches who are only out for the money and title that comes with it?""

""I know son, I know."" I shake my head, but he holds up his hand, stopping me from saying anymore."" I do. While I don't fully understand your thoughts when it comes to needing or wanting a mate, I can appreciate that this isn't necessarily the right way to go about this either."" While this may not affect his entire life as it will mine, it's clear to see that he's not happy with this. He looks stressed and tired and that's the last thing that I want for him. Against my better judgment and personal wants, I decided to give him a break.

""I'll do it. I'll meet these women and talk with them. There will only be a few to get through, but I make no promises."" Sometimes when an Alpha doesn't meet his mate, the Elders will encourage them to pick a mate instead of waiting for their fated ones. When they do this, they usually have a select few to meet the Alpha, usually around four to five of them. I can handle that.

The look on his face instantly has me on alert. ""What is it?"" He shifts a little, looking uncomfortable. ""I'm guessing that you haven't read your emails today yet?"" I shake my head no. ""Well, the Elders have introduced a new law this year that all and any single male or female wolves must now attend the annual Blue Moon Ball. It's compulsory.""

""Oh, you have got to be fucking kidding me!"" He shakes his head while mine whirls. ""I'm sorry, son, but there's going to be a lot of single she-wolves here and ready to be your Luna."" Fuck!

**Chapter5:** 

I wake up with a thick layer of sweat covering my entire body while I struggle to catch my breath. It's not often that my father's abuse finds its way into my dreams, but when it does, it's hell. It's usually the worst kind of beating that haunts my nights and, after the beatings that I received Tuesday night, I'm not surprised that I'm dreaming about it. I have for the last two nights and I don't see it stopping any time soon.

Yes, you heard me right. I said beatings, as in more than one. You see, I knew and had accepted that I would be punished after school. One because my dad hadn't finished with me in the morning before Alpha Mind linked him and two because I sneaked out for school without saying a word. I knew that it would make my dad even worse, but I just needed to get away.

However, what I wasn't expecting was the kind of revenge he would get on me. Physical or mental abuse along with starvation and taking away my clothes were standard practice for my dad, but this time he decided to tell my brother about me 'blaming him' and, in turn, that led to me not only getting a beating from my dad but also my brother and, I'll be honest, for a moment back there, I didn't think I was going to survive that night, but sadly I did.

I winch as I sit up while holding onto my side. I've had broken ribs before, but this is honestly the worst. I think my good old asshole of a brother got more than one. How fucking nice of him! If having broken ribs wasn't bad enough, another part of my punishment was losing access to my bed, so I had to sleep on my floor with one single sheet.

A loud bang on my door makes me jerk and whine from the pain ""Mutt, you had better be awake!"" My dad's voice bellows through the door. ""I'm awake sir,"" I call back. Yes, another thing I'm not allowed to do is call him dad in the house. When we're around company, then I must, but otherwise it's sir or master. ""You had better be downstairs in the next five minutes to make breakfast, or so help me, I will have your brother deal with you. I don't have time to beat your ass this morning."" I look at the old alarm clock that's sitting on my window and groan when I see it's only 4.30 am. Fuck my life.

I've barely slept, and it takes all I have to get up off of the floor, but I do it and get myself downstairs to make breakfast. Soon enough, I have made a stack of pancakes and added bowls of fruit and a bottle of syrup to the table alongside bacon and eggs. ""Is this all there is? Not much of a spread considering we have to travel for six hours.""

It's the day of the ball and I know that he's expecting a good breakfast to fill them before all the traveling, but this is the best I can manage right now, and I was praying that it would be enough. How dumb of me. ""I'm sorry sir. Is there something else I can get you?"" Before he can answer, both Blue and Rowan come strutting into the kitchen, both dressed to impress and looking smug about it. Rowan is dressed in a black suit with a white shirt underneath his suit jacket and shining black shoes. His hair is gelled to perfection and the waft of aftershave that fills the room makes me wonder if he even has any left anymore.

Blue is dressed in a skin-tight blue dress that leaves no room for the imagination. Her long blonde hair is straight and stops just below her shoulders while she wears high heels on her feet and a shit load of makeup on her face. I know there will be a ball tonight, but I didn't think that she would be dressing for it already. Surely she would want to get ready there? Either way, she looks like she's heading for a nightclub, not a mating ball.

Blue and I are non-identical twins and, whereas I have many faults, she is beautiful, which just makes it even more of a shame that she's such a giant bitch. If she had the personality to match her looks, she would make someone an incredible mate. As it stands, I can barely stand to be around her for long. She hasn't met her mate yet, but when she does... boy will I feel sorry for him, whoever he may be. He would be better off not meeting her ever, rather than having her as a mate. However, knowing how good her luck always seems to be, I don't doubt that she'll end up with an incredible mate who will just put up with her bullshit. Poor guy.

""Hello!"" My dad's bellowing voice drags me from my wandering mind and back into my shitty present. ""Sorry, sir. I got distracted for a moment there."" He walks across the room until he's standing right in front of me, then leans down until his face is right in front of mine. He's so close that I can feel his breath on my face and I want to gag, but thankfully, I hold it in. ""That's the second time this morning I have had to shout at you. Just thank your lucky stars that I need to keep your face clean for tonight, or you would be getting the slap that you deserve right now.""

I nod but don't speak as he turns and walks away. He walks around the table and sits at the head while keeping his eyes on me. ""Don't worry, mutt, I won't forget about it. When we get back from the ball, you will be punished accordingly. Now, how about you get breakfast served before you get the packing done so we can leave? And who knows, maybe you'll get it done right the first time and I won't have to add any more punishment."" At his words, both Rowan and Blue start laughing because they know the truth. They both know that no matter how I pack everything that is needed, no matter how high my standard will be when I pack, somehow my father will find a fault and another punishment will be added to the stack.

""Oh and, in case you didn't already know, you won't be joining us for breakfast this morning."" I had already guessed that it would be part of my punishment, which, of course, is why I just so happened to wake up hungry, but as much as my stomach is growling for food, missing breakfast or any meal is not uncommon for me, and I've learned to handle it, so today won't be any different.

Soon enough, I cleaned up, put everything away from breakfast and packed everyone's night bags. If packs live fairly local to the pack that is hosting the Blue Moon Ball, then they will head home after the ball, but the ones who live too far will stay overnight and attend breakfast the next day before leaving to travel home. Some will stay at the pack house or on the parklands while others will stay at local hotels or a place of their choosing. Our pack has recently become allies with the Diamond Pack and so, because of this, we have been invited to stay at the pack house.

""We will be leaving in 5 minutes!"" My dad bellows up the stairs. I quickly double-check my bag to make sure that I have everything before we head out. What none of my family knows is that I don't plan on returning with them after the ball. Both Lily and I have come up with a plan and that plan involves us leaving the Diamond Pack in the middle of the night and running with all we have. Luckily for me, I don't have much, barely anything, so even with packing some clothes and a few personal items, including a picture of my mom, I can still fit them into an overnight bag and no one is any the wiser.

As we step outside to get into my dad's SUV, I see Lily and her dad leaving their own house and heading for their car. She looks across at me and I see that look in her eyes. She is packed and ready for this just as much as me. As we set off for the Diamond Pack, I look around for the last time at my pack and I realize that I'm not even sad to leave. I won't miss anyone or anything about this place. Yes, there are some nice people here, but not nice enough to make me stay. I try not to show any emotion, but inside I'm bursting with excitement at the idea of never having to come back here, to finally be free just me and Lilly. Finally, free and away from the pain that is my family.

But it’s like he doesn’t even give a sh*t anymore. And I constantly keep giving effort and offering to order him food when he’s too tired from work and it saddens me how he just doesn’t care. I didn’t text him for a day and he didn’t seem to text either. But he skipped work, went for a movie, went coffee his friends and stuff but still no hi. I texted him the next day saying wow no text and he said yea I was out. I said okay. He said I’m being too cold and he said okay too. But uk in text it’s more sarcastic or whatever it is.

The moonlight gently cascaded onto the ground, resembling the Moon Goddess bathed in holy radiance, tenderly watching over her faithful followers.  
  
Seraphina Lane of Solaris Pack was questioning if the Moon Goddess was playing a joke on her.  
  
She was a vulnerable being without an inner wolf, even weaker than the feeblest Omega within the pack. It seemed as though she was not under the protection of the Moon Goddess.  
  
At that moment, her legs felt weak and her entire body was overwhelmed with discomfort.  
  
“It's so hot...” Seraphina murmured, her consciousness gradually blurring.  
  
Suddenly, she found herself colliding with a firm chest, and then the two of them tumbled onto the bed together.  
  
The sound of rapid breathing echoed in her ears as waves of pain and pleasure washed over her. Her mind was a complete blank. She was unable to distinguish between reality and dreams anymore.  
  
When she opened her eyes the next day, she felt an intense soreness throughout her body. Every movement she made, made her feel as if she was falling apart.  
  
She turned to one side and saw a man standing by the bed. He was tall and lean, casually rolling up his sleeves with his back to her. Each of his movements exuded an air of elegance, making it seem as though even his manner of dressing was an art.  
  
Sensing a movement behind him, the man turned around.  
  
His eyes were as sharp and icy as a hawk's, instilling fear in anyone who dared to meet his gaze. At that moment, he was staring intently at Seraphina.  
  
“M-Mr. Theodore?” Seraphina finally got a good look at the man, and for a moment, she felt as if the world was spinning.  
  
The man standing before her was none other than the youngest son of the Alpha of Moonshine Pack, Theodore Fairchild. But most importantly, he was Elara Lane's fiancé.  
  
*I can't believe I...*  
  
“Why were you in Elara's room?” Theodore questioned coldly.  
  
After dinner last night, he had felt dizzy. Elara had supported him and led him to her room to rest.  
  
Seraphina averted her gaze, her voice hushed as she confessed, “I've been set up!”  
  
*If I still can't figure out who tampered with my bowl, then I'm simply too naive.*  
  
The Alpha couple from Moonshine Pack had visited Solaris Pack last night. Their visit was to discuss the potential marriage between Theodore and the second daughter of the Lane family. Both families shared a meal together.  
  
Seraphina never dreamed that even something as mundane as eating at home could lead to problems.  
  
When she realized something was off and decided to go to the hospital, she encountered Sterling Fairchild, the current Alpha of Moonshine Pack, in the hallway. He was Theodore's father.  
  
Sterling scrutinized her from head to toe, his gaze carrying an unsettling hint of intrusion that made her feel a wave of nauseating discomfort.  
  
Seeing him approach, Seraphina was so frightened that she abruptly pushed open a door beside her. She then immediately shut it and locked it, not realizing she had just entered Elara's room. Little did she know what would unfold next.  
  
Seraphina found it ironic. Elara refused to marry Theodore because of his status as an illegitimate child, yet she was capable of such a despicable act.  
  
Theodore's expression turned even colder when he learned that Seraphina had been manipulated. *She's also a victim? So, was last night intentionally orchestrated by someone?*  
  
Something suddenly flashed through his mind, causing his brows to furrow. He asked inwardly, “Aiden, where did Elara go last night?”  
  
Aiden was his inner wolf, possessing considerable strength. However, his status was somewhat awkward. To avoid trouble, Theodore rarely allowed Aiden to take control of his body.  
  
“She brought you to the room and then she never showed up again.” Aiden's voice echoed in his mind.  
  
A glimmer of disappointment flashed in Theodore's eyes, and the atmosphere around him grew even colder.  
  
The sound of knocking echoed through the room. Theodore cast a nonchalant glance at Seraphina before proceeding to answer the door.  
  
Seraphina quickly wrapped herself up in the blanket.  
  
The door swung open, revealing none other than Elara.  
  
She glanced toward the bed. When she saw Seraphina hiding under the covers, she desperately tried to conceal the smile in her eyes.  
  
*This settles it. Theodore and Seraphina have been involved, and I've caught them in the act. I no longer have to marry Theodore, the illegitimate child.*  
  
Quickly, Elara concealed her smug expression and feigned shock, letting out a piercing scream. She donned a look of hurt as she gazed at Theodore. “You two...”  
  
Her shout summoned the Lanes and Fairchilds, causing a crowd to gather at the door.  
  
“What exactly is going on here?” The Alpha of Solaris Pack, Gregory Lane, feigned a troubled expression as he looked at Harrison Fairchild.  
  
Harrison instantly noticed a woman's blouse, jeans, and bra scattered all over the floor. The bedroom was even filled with an indescribable scent lingering after their intimate encounter.  
  
“Theodore, what on earth is going on?” His face reddened with embarrassment, and his voice took on a stern tone.



**Chapter 2 Facing The Reality**



Instead of responding right away, Theodore turned his gaze toward Elara. Upon meeting his eyes, Elara quickly looked away.  
  
Elara felt not the slightest bit of guilt. Theodore was indeed quite handsome and had an impressive presence. He was even more attractive than Maverick Fairchild, the next Alpha of Moonshine Pack. Unfortunately, his low status as Sterling's illegitimate son left him with no promising future. While he currently had Harrison's protection, he had no real prospects once Harrison was no longer around.  
  
Seeing her reaction, Theodore let out a self-deprecating laugh. *Is it because of my status as an illegitimate child?*  
  
Aiden sighed at that moment. “I warned you not to act impulsively. She was never meant to be our destined mate, yet you insisted on marrying her.”  
  
Indeed, his inner wolf had revealed early on that Elara was not his destined mate. However, their childhood bond had led him to decide to marry her regardless. So what if they weren't destined mates? In werewolf society, there were plenty of instances where couples who weren't destined mates still ended up as husband and wife.  
  
Unfortunately, reality hit him hard, making all the beauty, the memories he had cherished for fifteen years, and the obsession imprinted on his heart feel like a cruel joke.  
  
He lifted his chin toward Harrison and said, “It's exactly as you saw it!”  
  
He had simply shared a meal with the Lanes but found himself set up, and the Lanes were unlikely to admit to drugging him. He couldn't afford the embarrassment.  
  
“Stop this nonsense!” Harrison barked.  
  
*A month ago, Theodore unexpectedly expressed his intention to marry the second daughter of the Lane family. This visit to Solaris Pack was meant to discuss his marriage to her. However, just as we settled the matter, he ended up sleeping with his fiancée's younger sister. What on earth is going on? There must be more to this situation than meets the eye.*  
  
“Tell me what exactly happened,” Harrison demanded in a deep voice.  
  
If Theodore insisted there were hidden circumstances, he would undoubtedly support him.  
  
Theodore calmly stated, “Grandpa, if Ms. Seraphina agrees, I want to marry her!”  
  
“What about Elara?” The Luna of Solaris Pack pretended to look concerned.  
  
Gregory appeared even more somber, looking utterly heartbroken. “What's done is done. The previous engagement obviously no longer matters!”  
  
Beneath the covers, a cold, mocking smile tugged at the corners of Seraphina's lips, her face streaked with tears.  
  
It was only then that she realized the true meaning of the words she had faintly heard when she passed by the study yesterday afternoon.  
  
“Elara doesn't want to get married. Just find a way to get someone else to marry him. We absolutely need to secure this one-billion project.”  
  
It turned out that she was the “someone else” they had referred to, and their so-called solution was to drug her.  
  
“Ms. Seraphina, I'll be waiting for you downstairs. If you're willing, we can register our marriage later,” Theodore said, then left without giving attention to anyone else.  
  
Since everything from fifteen years ago had already ended, it no longer mattered whom he chose to marry.  
  
After getting married, he would shoulder the responsibilities that a husband should. He was not Sterling; he would never let a woman down.  
  
Selene Ziegler, the Luna of Solaris Pack, said awkwardly, “I apologize for my poor guidance which has led to this embarrassment. Gregory, could you please lead everyone to breakfast? I need to have a private chat with Seraphina to understand what exactly happened.”  
  
Harrison had no choice but to lead his son and grandson downstairs.  
  
In an instant, only Selene was left at the door. She stepped into the room and gently closed the door behind her. With a tenderness akin to a loving mother, she called out, “Seraphina.”  
  
Seraphina peeked out from under the blanket, her gaze distant as she looked at Selene.  
  
Selene was startled but quickly feigned self-reproach, saying, “Seraphina, I've failed to protect you. I'm sorry!”  
  
Seraphina cast a mocking glance at Selene.  
  
Selene was too guilt-ridden to meet Seraphina's eyes, but she had no choice but to continue persuading her. The future of Solaris Pack depended on it.  
  
The day before, Moonshine Pack had come to discuss a marriage alliance. Harrison had personally agreed to offer a collaboration project worth a billion to Solaris Pack as a gesture of sincerity for the proposed union. She was resolute in persuading Seraphina to marry into their family.  
  
“Seraphina, I'm not sure how all of this came about, but given what has transpired between you and Mr. Theodore, marrying him would be the best decision.”  
  
Seraphina remained silent, her gaze fixed intently on Selene.  
  
Selene's heart skipped a beat, but she steadied herself and continued, “Seraphina, I've already checked. Mr. Theodore has no bad habits. He's handsome, has a great demeanor, and his business acumen is top-notch. He's a good man. Marrying him will definitely lead to a happy life for you.”  
  
With a mocking smile, Seraphina asked, “If he's so great, why didn't you let Elara marry him?”  
  
At the dinner table, the two packs had agreed for Elara to be married off, as Theodore had specifically expressed his desire to marry her.  
  
Feeling overwhelmed with guilt as if her secrets were exposed, Selene took a deep breath and said, “Seraphina, you know we initially planned for Elara to marry Mr. Theodore. Elara was quite fond of him. But then last night, something happened between you and Mr. Theodore. Can you tell me what exactly happened? Didn't you go back to your room to sleep after saying you were dizzy? How did you end up in Elara's room?”



**Chapter 3 Three Conditions**



A bitter laugh echoed in Seraphina's heart. *How did I end up in Elara's room? Are they planning to pin all the blame on me, accusing me of seducing Mr. Theodore?*  
  
What amused her was that she genuinely couldn't find a reason to argue back. Indeed, there was no valid reason for her to be in Elara's room. She claimed she was drugged but lacked proof. Everyone had shared the same meal last night.  
  
Suddenly, her eyes twinkled as she asked, “Where did Elara go last night?”  
  
If it wasn't for a deliberate scheme, Elara wouldn't have spent the entire night away from her room, only to catch them red-handed the next morning.  
  
Selene's gaze momentarily revealed her guilt, but she quickly composed herself and said, “I spent the entire night persuading her.”  
  
She had to come up with a reason for Elara's absence throughout the night.  
  
“Persuading her to marry Mr. Theodore?” Seraphina asked.  
  
“Yes!” Selene smiled awkwardly.  
  
“Didn't you say Elara was quite fond of Mr. Theodore? Why would you need to persuade her all night?”  
  
Selene was taken aback, her heart filled with resentment toward Seraphina. However, she dared not offend her at the moment, as she was relying on her for the project.  
  
With a smile, she said, “She was reluctant at first.”  
  
“Is it because Mr. Theodore is an illegitimate child?”  
  
“You... Seraphina, how could you speak like that?” Selene was somewhat annoyed.  
  
Seraphina looked at Selene with a face full of mockery. *What, they've done what they did, and I'm not allowed to talk about it?*  
  
“I suppose Mr. Theodore and I make quite a pair since we're both illegitimate children!”  
  
“You!” Selene looked at Seraphina in shock.  
  
“How did I know I was an illegitimate child, right?”  
  
Selene furrowed her brows, looking at Seraphina.  
  
Seraphina smiled, a hint of hurt hidden behind her radiant face. “Aunt Selene, do you remember when Elara and I fought over a dress when I was thirteen? She took my dress and pointed at me, calling me a loveless illegitimate child with no parents to care for me.”  
  
Seraphina began to address Selene as Aunt Selene.  
  
Indeed, Gregory and Selene were her uncle and aunt. Her mother, Juliana Lane, had entrusted her to them when she was just a month old, hoping to provide her with a normal family.  
  
It wasn't until she turned thirteen that she discovered they weren't her real parents.  
  
She had been clinging to a fantasy, hoping that this was all a lie, a deceit spun by Elara.  
  
However, by the time she reached her eighteenth birthday, her coming-of-age, she had not yet found her inner wolf. Whispers and speculations began to circulate within the pack.  
  
Everyone was saying she couldn't possibly be a purebred werewolf descendant and her father must have been an ordinary human.  
  
He had not only abandoned her mother but also refused to acknowledge his own child. This led to her mother's mental breakdown and subsequent car accident.  
  
These were secrets she had overheard. She remembered discovering the truth by eavesdropping, then hiding behind the flower bed and crying alone for the entire afternoon.  
  
After her birth, her mother had given all her savings to Gregory and Selene, aiding them in expanding Solaris Pack to its current scale. All she asked in return was for them to treat Seraphina kindly and provide her with a complete family. But they didn't.  
  
All the tasty treats, fun toys, and useful items were only for her elder sisters. All she could have were the things they didn't want.  
  
Even though they weren't particularly nice to her, Seraphina still appreciated their upbringing.  
  
However, from last night onward, all her gratitude had turned into a weapon, one that severed familial ties.  
  
Selene's face contorted. She furrowed her brows, pondering on how to persuade Seraphina to agree to the marriage.  
  
Seraphina lifted her gaze to meet Selene's, her voice calm yet resolute as she declared, “I don't mind marrying Mr. Theodore, but I have three conditions!”  
  
A wave of joy swept over Selene. She took Seraphina's hand, gently stroking the back of it. “Whatever conditions you have, feel free to express them. Think of me as your mother. Rest assured, as long as it's within my abilities, I will fulfill your wishes.”



**Chapter 4 Who Drugged Me**



Looking at her insincere face, Seraphina pulled her hand back in disgust. “I want the mansion in Serenity Bay.”  
  
Selene's face turned pale, and her heart was filled with frustration. The mansion in Serenity Bay was intended to be a dowry for Elara. Its value was roughly eight million.  
  
“You don't agree?” Seraphina looked at Selene with a smirk.  
  
“I do, I do,” Selene said through gritted teeth.  
  
“The second condition, please have Elara return the necklace she took from me.” That necklace was the only keepsake her mother had left her. It had been many years since Elara had taken it. She had asked for it back before, but Elara had deceived her, claiming it was lost.  
  
“No problem,” Selene readily agreed. They certainly weren't interested in a filthy necklace.  
  
“The third condition, tell me, was it you or Elara who drugged me last night?”  
  
Selene's expression suddenly changed. “Seraphina, what are you talking about?”  
  
*This matter absolutely must not be spoken of!*  
  
“If any of the three conditions aren't met, I won't get married!” Seraphina was firm in her stance. She glanced at Selene, her voice detached and indifferent. “Aunt Selene, please leave. Once I'm dressed, I'll tell Mr. Theodore I have someone I love and I won't marry him! We're all adults. There's nothing serious about this matter.”  
  
Selene sensed the weight of Seraphina's threat in her tone. Her lips trembled slightly as she wanted to speak but held back. She was clearly troubled.  
  
*Admitting it would mean confessing that we drugged her.*   
  
*But if I stay silent, she'll refuse to marry, and our project that is worth a billion will be lost.*  
  
“Seraphina, this must be some sort of misunderstanding. Why would we drug you?” Selene decided to vehemently deny it after weighing her options.  
  
“Aunt Selene, please leave. I need to go downstairs and inform Mr. Theodore myself, so as not to keep him waiting.”  
  
Selene was inwardly upset, but she put on a smile and said, “Seraphina, there must be some misunderstanding. How could anyone in our family possibly do such a thing?”  
  
“I refuse to marry until I get to the bottom of this! Aunt Selene, please leave!”  
  
Suddenly, a phone ring echoed from under the covers, and Seraphina promptly retrieved the phone.  
  
She looked at Selene, smiling as she said, “It's a call from Mr. Theodore. I might as well just tell him over the phone that I'm not marrying him to avoid the awkwardness of saying it face-to-face.”  
  
“No! I'll talk!” Selene quickly stopped her.  
  
Seraphina looked at Selene indifferently, waiting for her to speak.  
  
“Seraphina, I'm sorry. I was not in my right mind. Elara is in love with someone else and doesn't want to marry Mr. Theodore. I had no choice but to do what I did,” Selene said through gritted teeth.  
  
Seraphina sneered inwardly. *What an excuse!*  
  
*I always knew they didn't like me, but I never imagined they would stoop to such despicable actions.*  
  
*They didn't want to marry Elara off to Moonshine Pack, but they still coveted the project from them. So, they targeted me instead.*  
  
*Even though I'm not their biological child, I have called them Mom and Dad for twenty years. I'm their biological niece!*  
  
*When Mom entrusted me to them, she gave them all her savings. Those savings were what enabled them to develop Solaris Pack to its current scale.*  
  
*How could they do such a thing?*  
  
*In the past, whenever Elara and Yvette wanted something from me or coveted something I had, I always gave in to them.*  
  
*It isn't that I'm weak, but rather, I genuinely consider them my own kin. Because in my eyes, they are the only family I have left in this world!*  
  
*But they drugged me for the sake of the project. Haha!*  
  
Selene's eyes flickered with uncertainty. “Seraphina, I'm sorry, but at this point, an apology won't change anything. Please—”  
  
“No, an apology can make amends, as long as it's sincere!”  
  
Selene looked at Seraphina, puzzled.  
  
With a playful smile tugging at her lips, Seraphina said, “Compensate me with a hundred million in cash!”



**Chapter 5 The Illegitimate Son And Daughter**



Upon hearing Seraphina's outrageous demands, Selene was boiling with anger. However, given her disadvantaged position, she dared not lose her temper.  
  
“Seraphina, you can't go back on your word. You said earlier that you would get married if your three conditions were met.”  
  
“I'm having second thoughts now,” Seraphina said shamelessly.  
  
*Should I bother with keeping my word when dealing with them? No, the best approach when dealing with their kind is to shamelessly play their own game.*  
  
Selene was utterly exasperated, yet she somehow managed to keep her patience as she explained, “Seraphina, you've grown up in the pack. You should know our family's circumstances well. The company run by Solaris Pack has always operated with limited working capital.”  
  
“All right, let's settle for sixty million then!” Seraphina suggested with immense generosity.  
  
“We can't come up with sixty million either,” Selene said with a troubled expression.  
  
“Aunt Selene, I think it would be best if Elara marries into Moonshine Pack. I'm sure they would provide a dowry of several hundred million. As you mentioned earlier, Elara has someone she likes and doesn't want to marry Mr. Theodore. That's not a problem. She can simply explain it to them. I believe a powerful pack like them wouldn't force her. However, regarding the project, I think they would probably look for a better business partner.”  
  
Selene was momentarily caught off guard.  
  
“I'm going to call Mr. Theodore,” Seraphina said, ready to dial the number.  
  
Selene was fully aware that Seraphina was threatening her, yet she was left with no other options. “Fine, sixty million it is.”  
  
“Thank you, Aunt Selene!” Seraphina said with a cold smile. “You can go ahead and prepare. I'll go find Mr. Theodore. Before we get our marriage certificate, we're planning to spend some time at a café to chat and get to know each other. I expect to receive your sixty million, my necklace, and the mansion gift contract before we register our marriage. Otherwise, I might back out at any time. After all... I have no feelings for Mr. Theodore. You know the man I love is Jacob!”  
  
The blatant threat left Selene boiling with anger, but she forced a smile as she reassured, “Seraphina, don't worry, I will definitely keep my word.”  
  
After she finished speaking, she left.  
  
Seraphina slightly lowered her eyelids as she looked at her phone. The phone had been in her blanket before, and she had started recording the moment Selene began speaking.  
  
Selene might not willingly hand over the mansion and money to her. There might come a time when the recording could prove useful. Of course, it would be better if it wasn't needed.  
  
Solaris Pack was willing to sacrifice her without a second thought for a project worth a billion. She couldn't just walk away empty-handed.  
  
Taking away Elara's mansion and sixty million was considered a closure.  
  
From that point on, she and Solaris Pack would have no connection whatsoever.  
  
After quickly getting dressed, Seraphina descended the stairs and spotted Theodore under the sycamore tree not far from the entrance.  
  
Theodore, clad in a suit, stood tall and straight, exuding an aura of nobility and aloofness. As the wind rustled, leaves from the sycamore tree drifted onto his shoulder before falling to the ground, carrying a sense of desolation with them.  
  
Before today, she had never really taken the time to observe Theodore. Now, she realized he was an incredibly charismatic werewolf, with an aura that could easily leave many she-wolves completely smitten.  
  
Becoming Theodore's mate wasn't a bad deal for her at all.  
  
Seraphina moved to his side. *Wow, he's tall. I'm about five feet six, but he towers over me by half a head. Is he around six feet three?*  
  
“Have you made up your mind?” Theodore asked calmly.  
  
“Let's go,” Seraphina said.  
  
“Are we registering our marriage?” Theodore looked at Seraphina, seeking confirmation.  
  
“Yeah.”  
  
“There are two things I need to tell you, Ms. Seraphina.”  
  
“Hmm?”  
  
“I'm the illegitimate son of the Alpha of Moonshine Pack, so I have no right to inherit the pack,” Theodore said nonchalantly as if he was talking about someone else's business.  
  
Seraphina's lips quirked in self-deprecation. “Don't worry, I'm an illegitimate daughter too!”  
  
Theodore glanced at Seraphina, slightly taken aback.  
  
Seraphina flashed a slight smile, looking relieved. “It's exactly as you heard.”  
  
In truth, she was still heartbroken. Despite their mistreatment over the years, she still clung to this only semblance of familial love because she had invested her heart and emotions into it.  
  
Little did she expect it to hurt so much.  
  
Theodore gave a slight nod, then said, “There is someone I like, but I promise to treat you well after we're married.”  
  
Seraphina shrugged nonchalantly. “Funny enough, there is someone I like too. After we're married, I will also make an effort to treat you well.”  
  
Upon hearing that Seraphina had someone she liked, Theodore said, “If the person you like doesn't mind—”  
  
“We've already broken up!”  
  
A few days ago, on her twentieth birthday, her boyfriend of two years, Jacob Lynch, had discovered that she wasn't the daughter of the Alpha of Solaris Pack but merely his niece. Realizing she might not inherit any of the pack's wealth, he decisively broke up with her and accused her of deceiving his feelings.  
  
Theodore said in a soft voice, “Let's go!”  
  
“Before we register our marriage, how about we grab a cup of coffee first?” Seraphina suggested.  
  
She had to wait until Selene transferred the money into her account.  
  
Theodore didn't refuse. After all, it was important to clarify certain things since they were still strangers.



**Chapter 6 The Identity Of Seraphina**



Inside the café, Theodore observed the young girl in front of him and silently questioned Aiden in his mind, “I can't seem to sense her inner wolf.”  
  
Aiden responded quickly, “Yes, she doesn't have an inner wolf, so I can't determine if she's your destined mate or not.”  
  
Theodore was surprised, but then Aiden continued, “But that's irrelevant. I feel a thrill whenever I'm near her! Cheer up, my friend, don't you think our mate is as beautiful as an angel!”  
  
Theodore was taken aback by Aiden's unusual excitement, and his gaze returned to Seraphina.  
  
Seraphina of Solaris Pack was indeed extraordinarily beautiful.  
  
Her long, golden hair, soft as silk, shimmered under the sunlight like a flowing river of gold. Her deep blue eyes, evocative of the ocean's depths and the bright, clear sky, held an air of mystery. Her long eyelashes fluttered like delicate feathers, adding a touch of playfulness and liveliness to her appearance.  
  
Sensing his gaze, she looked up and blinked, her face breaking into a warm smile.  
  
Theodore coughed twice to mask his embarrassment. “Do you have any expectations for our life after marriage?”  
  
Seraphina gave it some thought. “I hope that our life after marriage can continue as it was before, with mutual respect, space, and freedom, and we should go fifty-fifty on finances.”  
  
Theodore made two points clear. “Mutual respect and granting each other space and freedom is the kind of marriage I want too. But I don't agree with splitting everything fifty-fifty. As a man, I consider it my duty to provide for my wife.”  
  
As he spoke, he pulled out his wallet, and from it, he drew a bank card which he handed to Seraphina. “There's over three million in it. Take it and buy anything you want. I'll make sure to replenish the funds promptly. Even though I'm just an illegitimate son, I believe I can still provide a wealthy life for my wife.”  
  
Seraphina shook her head and gently pushed Theodore's hand away. “No, let's split everything fifty-fifty. That way, I won't feel any pressure.”  
  
“Is there a problem with a wife spending her husband's money?”  
  
Seraphina chuckled. “Since we don't have a deep emotional connection, I hope my soul remains unconfined and truly free.”  
  
Theodore furrowed his brows. *Her soul will be confined if she spends my money?*  
  
Seraphina added, “Spending my own money makes me feel independent and free. At the same time, I hope you won't force me into certain things.”  
  
“For example?” Theodore looked at Seraphina.  
  
Seraphina didn't hesitate. She candidly said, “For example, matters between men and women.”  
  
“It's perfectly normal for a married couple to have a sex life.” Theodore's voice remained calm.  
  
“That's why we'll split everything fifty-fifty, so we don't owe each other anything. Even for that matter, I hope you'll respect my wishes!”  
  
Theodore stared at Seraphina.  
  
Suddenly, Seraphina's face flushed. She was contemplating arguing her case when Theodore said, “All right, I'll respect you!”  
  
Seraphina glanced at Theodore with gratitude, nodded slightly, and let out a faint sigh of relief.  
  
Meanwhile, Selene relayed Seraphina's requests to Gregory.  
  
“Your sister truly gave birth to a fine daughter. Years ago, she eloped with a man from the vampire clan and left us this odd creature to raise. We were kind enough not to abandon her daughter, and this is how she repays us?”  
  
“Keep it down! If you want our pack to continue living a peaceful life, stop bringing up the past!”  
  
Had it not been for Juliana offering all her savings as a trade back then, Gregory wouldn't have dared to take in Seraphina. After all, her existence was inexplicable to both clans. Most importantly, aside from lacking an inner wolf, Seraphina displayed no other peculiarities as she grew up. Otherwise, Gregory wouldn't have raised her into adulthood.  
  
This was a secret that Gregory and Selene would carry to their graves. It ran so deep that even their two daughters believed Seraphina's father was just an ordinary man. With Juliana long gone, they knew that as long as they kept quiet, the truth would remain hidden forever.  
  
Selene wore a stern expression, suppressing the resentment in her heart. “So, what do you suggest we do now? Without the money and the mansion, she won't agree to the marriage.”  
  
Gregory frowned. “Didn't you try to appease her?”  
  
“How do I appease her? She's been treating us like fools all along. She's long known that she's Juliana's daughter, and we are nothing more than her uncle and aunt.”  
  
“You didn't tell her that Solaris Pack is facing difficulties and can't possibly come up with sixty million?” Gregory asked somberly.  
  
“I did! But you have no idea how sharp-tongued she can be. She even had the nerve to ask if we would prepare billions in dowry if it were Elara getting married. Gregory, we can't delay this any longer. Give her what she wants right away, and let her and Theodore get their marriage certificate first. This way, we secure the project and get rid of this major headache.”  
  
Gregory frowned. “Sixty million is too much.”  
  
“She was going to ask for a hundred million.”  
  
“I'll give her a call.”  
  
“What's the point? You have no idea how much hatred was in her eyes when she looked at me.”  
  
“Hatred?”  
  
“There were only a few of us at home. Do you really think she couldn't figure out who drugged her?”  
  
Gregory was about to make a phone call, but after some thought, he let out a sigh. “Fine, sixty million it is then.”  
  
Drugging was a matter that couldn't be openly discussed. If Seraphina were to reveal this incident, the powerful and influential Moonshine Pack might condemn their actions and outright reject the marriage alliance.  
  
Seeing Gregory agree, Selene quickly urged, “Then hurry up! I'll go find Elara to transfer the mansion to her.”  
  
As Selene left the study, her eyes turned cold. *Hmph, once we secure the project, Seraphina will have to give back the sixty million and the mansion just as easily as she took them!*

1lg0sis,https://www.reddit.com/r/AMPToken/comments/1lg0sis/jesse_pollak_coinbase_coffee/,"Jesse Pollak, Coinbase, Coffee","What has been *interesting* about the PANIC following the Jesse tweets and Base-Shopify announcement is that not only does Jesse know about Flexa - not only does he remember their partnership - but he also used this same ""asking the public"" approach before. Has anyone highlighted this?

The Base-Flexa Regal partnership was only leaked because folks knew to start looking for clues after Jesse tweeted that he ""would love to work closely with \[Flexa\] to enable USDC on Base and make the experience smooth""

[https://x.com/trev/status/1823397006892802349](https://x.com/trev/status/1823397006892802349)

This tweet thread is *interesting* for several reasons. Jesse was focusing on coffee shops, which he has been obsessing over bring on chain for years - He even tries to get Amber Rose to discuss a coffee partnership in the same thread. In hindsight, it is odd that he did not choose to leverage Flexa's existing relationships to focus the first Base-Flexa partnership on a coffee brand (unless he is waiting for the *purveyor of coffee* that Trev is eager to announce). 

Regardless, folks were somewhat undewhelmed by this tweet at the time because Jesse appeared to be learning about Flexa's potential only in Q3 2024 - folks were hoping that they were already partners. But weren't they? Because this was the same week that Danny was thanking Jesse as a collaborator on Flexa Components. 

[https://www.linkedin.com/posts/danielcmccabe\_digital-payments-platform-flexa-introduces-activity-7229928063508049920-XgXS?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=member\_desktop&rcm=ACoAACCasysBTzszQA7oD6jli1zYkE0eD8h0690](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/danielcmccabe_digital-payments-platform-flexa-introduces-activity-7229928063508049920-XgXS?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACCasysBTzszQA7oD6jli1zYkE0eD8h0690)

Now, a quick silly call out - It is also *interesting* that Trev qouted the Coinbase announcement of the Regal partnership while Jesse qouted the Flexa announcement. Jesse took this ""big"" compaign seriously, even if it was truly only a test run. 

[https://x.com/jessepollak/status/1869801416254206150](https://x.com/jessepollak/status/1869801416254206150)

[https://x.com/trev/status/1869801625440903485](https://x.com/trev/status/1869801625440903485)

TRecently, we've all seen Jesse's latest tweets about brands that Flexa has worked - with no mention of Flexa. He acknowledged the ""big"" Regal partnership, but he never confirms or denies still working with Flexa. His words, ""time to bring more people onchain,"" are either poorly phrased or hinting that his objective is again to raise awareness in his audience, rather than reinvent the wheel without Flexa.

[https://x.com/jessepollak/status/1933940616289034360](https://x.com/jessepollak/status/1933940616289034360)

Lastly, is it not also *interesting* that he says, ""we spent the last 9 months working with \[Shopify\] to solve all the hard problems with an open source protocol""? Is this not the exact timeframe between Jesse acknolwedging Flexa in Q3 2024 publicly and the Regal partnership in Q4 2024? 

[https://x.com/jessepollak/status/1933885931402252676](https://x.com/jessepollak/status/1933885931402252676)

But we're still left with the question - If Jesse isn't simply scaling Flexa's longstanding partnerships, then why has he gone silent about ""bringing more coffee shops on chain""? Why isn't he calling out Starbucks alongside Chipotle unless I missed those tweets? Why did he stop asking his audience for new coffee shops recommendation ALSO 9-10 months ago? That is quite the coincidence. Perhaps, it is because he can't help scale a Flexa partnership that remains under NDA?

Forget the patents - These tweets and timelines are too aligned for Coinbase to legally cut out Flexa without a major lawsuit. It is much more likely that they can't tell us that we are really f-cking early. ",6,1750416019.0,AMPToken,4,1.0,False

I’ve descaled it almost a dozen times , even soaking it through. I’ve frozen and defrosted it with boiling water hoping the pipes expand and release debris. 

My question is:
1) How freely is the air ideally supposed to flow if blown from the top as shown in the photo, with a finger blocking the side hole? Super freely/ kinda freely?

2) when blown from top, under extreme amount of pressure I feel ‘some’ air flow. But the other side - the giant brass cup side where the heat resistance thingie is (bottom as in the picture), impossible to blow. Is that normal?

But maybe that’s because we need them. We need the reminder, the repetition, the space to absorb it. Social media celebrates all the big wins — the launches, the milestones, the polished moments. But life is also the quiet coffee, the finished to-do, getting out of bed on a difficult day, walking your dog. It’s the quiet victories that keep us going. They’re not loud, but they’re real.

1lg0qjt,https://www.reddit.com/r/victoria3/comments/1lg0qjt/thoughts_on_different_investment_strategies_in/,Thoughts on different investment strategies in the new version.,"With the new expansion, and after playing a bit it seems to me there's a few different options for how you approach investment agreements.

1: Let the AI invest in you as much as possible. This was a good approach for big countries (Qing being a great example) in previous patches. With the existence of investment charters this seems a bit riskier. On the other hand, if you want to reach full employment as a nation like Qing and then use war to forcibly nationalise everything(or go Communist), this is worth considering. You could even spice it up by giving away monopolies in your own territory. 

2: Dominate weak countries for export: this was the previous meta, and still works. Just try to get lots of protectorates and investment agreements on small countries. In this approach you avoid the investment charter as it just means you lose capitalist jobs with little upside. The goal is to dominate them and bring them into your power bloc where they will contribute to your trade strength. I can see this being good for medium sized GPs like France or Britain. 

3. Leech off big countries: this is an interesting new approach in the new version. In this approach you instead focus on ingratiating yourself with the largest GPs and give investment charters to all your companies. The upside of this is that you will grow your companies very big quite quickly. A downside I can see is that it will make it more difficult for you to establish a dominant trade position in the goods your company produces. I can see this working well for small countries like Belgium or Sweden.

4. Dominate goods for import: The idea here is to establish companies not for goods you export, but goods you import, and the goal is turn other countries into Banana republics. In this approach you have companies for lower value buildings (eg plantation goods) which you then try to get company monopolies on all over the place paired with investment charters. A good example of this might be Britain going to war with Qing and then forcing them to accept a tea and opium monopoly for the EIC, and giving the EIC a trade and investment charter to go wild.

5. Make yourself a banana republic: Certain countries start in a good position to dominate a specific resource, for example coffee in Brazil or iron in Sweden. In this approach you position your entire economy to push this single good. Give that company a trade charter but avoid investment agreements entirely and just protectorate regions that are suited to producing your chosen goods. This will probably work well in the early game but get worse in later stages and you'll want to transition to something else.

I think there's a lot of nuance here, but it also seems to me that certain features are working against each other. Thoughts? ",5,1750415813.0,victoria3,1,1.0,False
1lg0qdi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1lg0qdi/claimed_by_the_mafia_boss_summary_review_and/,"Claimed by the Mafia Boss: Summary, Review, and Reading Link","**All read — drop a reply if you’d like the reading link**

Luna Feron's POV:  
  
The crystal chandelier at the entryway refracted blades of light sharp enough to kill me.  
  
My hand trembled around my phone. My nails dug deep into my palm, the taste of blood spreading between my teeth.  
  
It was our one-year wedding anniversary. The champagne bucket that should’ve been chilling a bottle was still sitting in the foyer cabinet—now filled with nothing but ice-cold dread.  
  
Beneath Verona’s glittering surface, the Feron mafia family’s underworld churned quietly.  
  
I’d been married into the Feron mafia family for three years. I knew this family, which ran underground casinos and a smuggling empire, was soaked in danger. Even the air carried a threat.  
  
And Vincent—my husband, the smooth-talking heir who always wore his suits like armor and held court at family parties—was currently grinding all his charm into another woman’s body.  
  
Shreds of gift wrap littered the Persian rug in the living room—the tie set I’d picked out with care this morning, now torn apart.  
  
From the crack beneath the bedroom door upstairs came breathy, skin-flushing moans, tangled with wet kisses and the clink of leather restraints.  
  
“Baby, I’m already divorced…” the woman whimpered between gasps, cloth tearing audibly. “Tie me up with that tie... just like the first time... fuck me hard, make me come!”  
  
“Yeah, you filthy little slut! Stick your ass up higher!”  
  
The bed slammed harder against the wall. Her whimpering cries mixed with his low grunts, pounding in my skull like a migraine.  
  
I never imagined this would be how I found out—on our anniversary—that my husband was cheating on me.  
  
No... maybe he’d been cheating all along. I was just too blind to see it.  
  
After all, I was supposed to be on a flight to Minch right now.  
  
But after debating it all night, I’d canceled the trip last minute. I’d ordered flowers, a cake, and a bottle of red wine to surprise him instead.  
  
Well. Surprise, indeed.  
  
Then I heard Vincent moaning back at her: “Divorced... ah—fuck! Your pussy’s so tight! Shit, I’m gonna wreck you with this dick. Don’t worry, it’s only a matter of time.”  
  
That voice—those filthy words—I’d once heard whispering love to me during countless sleepless nights. Now they stabbed through my chest like poison-tipped knives.  
  
I thought of last week, when he came home late. There’d been an unfamiliar lipstick stain on his collar. He just laughed and said he brushed up against someone at the party.  
  
I’d seen that woman before. She worked at his company—his boss.  
  
Vincent had even mentioned that if he wanted a promotion, he had to butter her up.  
  
So this was what “buttering up” meant? Trading his body for a raise?  
  
I felt sick. I bit down on my lip so hard it nearly split, forcing myself to stay silent—fighting the urge to barge in and scream.  
  
Logic held me back. I didn’t drop the flowers or cake. Instead, I pulled out my phone, opened the camera, and snapped a photo of what was happening inside.  
  
The image shook in my trembling hands—two bodies tangled in silk sheets. She was on all fours. Vincent was riding her from behind. And his familiar cock was thrusting into her like a piston.  
  
*Vincent, you son of a b\*tch.*  
  
…  
  
I stormed out the apartment door, dumped the flowers and cake into the trash, and flagged down a cab.  
  
Just as I reached for the door, my phone started to ring in my pocket.  
  
I ignored it and slid into the back seat, but the screen kept flashing nonstop—relentless.  
  
Annoyed, I finally picked up.  
  
A familiar voice screamed through the speaker—his mother.  
  
“Luna! What the hell is wrong with you? I went out of my way to book you an appointment with the best fertility specialist in the city, and you blew her off! And now you won’t even answer my calls? If you don’t want to give the Feron mafia family a child, then get the hell out! Divorce Vincent already! There are plenty of women out there dying to carry my son’s baby!”  
  
I stared out the window, remembering our wedding day—how she grabbed my chin right after the ceremony and sneered, “Girls from the slums should know their place.”  
  
I tightened my grip on the phone and answered her word for word.  
  
“Don’t worry. I’ll divorce him. You don’t need to push me. You want a grandson? Fine. I’ll have one.”  
  
But it won’t be Vincent’s.  
  
I didn’t say that part out loud. It burned in my chest like a bloody vow.  
  
“Sir, take me to the Leisure Palace,” I told the cab driver, catching his wary glance in the rearview mirror.  
  
That place was the most decadent hellhole the Feron mafia family owned—three floors underground, hiding their money laundering ledgers and weapons trade records.  
  
And I was going there to find a man who’d humiliate Vincent for life.



**Chapter 2 She Came to Cheat… With Me?**



Silas Feron's POV:  
  
Dim red light spilled across the marble floors of Leisure Palace.  
  
This place was the Feron mafia family’s central hub for money laundering and intelligence trading. But on the surface, I’d turned it into a legitimate entertainment venue—even the cops couldn’t find a single crack in the foundation.  
  
I stood in the VIP section with a glass of whiskey in hand, listening to my men report on recent arms smuggling activity. The updates weren’t great.  
  
I tipped the glass back, draining the whiskey in one go. As my assistant lowered his voice, I started wondering if it was time to shift to a more profitable cargo.  
  
*Drugs, maybe…*  
  
I frowned, tracing the rim of my glass with a finger. Back when the old man was still alive, drugs were off-limits. That had been his bottom line.  
  
Suddenly, a staggering figure entered my line of sight.  
  
A woman in ten-inch heels moved like a blooming red rose, swaying with every step.  
  
Her bronze skin shimmered under the neon, glowing like warm honey. The satin gown clung to her hourglass figure—her full chest nearly spilling out of the plunging neckline. Her narrow waist and round hips formed a dramatic curve, and her toned thighs flashed between the high slit of her skirt.  
  
She weaved through the dance floor unsteadily, her hair catching the flickering lights.  
  
Every man she passed instinctively swallowed hard, eyes glued to her back. But she seemed oblivious, walking straight toward me.  
  
“Ugh… so dizzy…” Her voice trembled deliberately, playing weak. I could tell right away she was trying to seduce me.  
  
Before I could react, her soft, warm body fell against mine. The men around me looked visibly shocked—some were even ready to throw her out for crossing the line.  
  
I shot them a look. *Back off.*  
  
Her waist was slim and pliable. I held her instinctively. The scent of whiskey on my breath mixed with the faint fragrance of roses from her body, rushing up my nose.  
  
I wasn’t the type to indulge often. I only sought out a virgin once a month to satisfy my physical needs.  
  
I’d already had my fix this month. Normally, I wouldn’t feel a thing toward another woman. But the second her scent hit me, my mind flashed with images of bending her over and fucking her senseless.  
  
That was the only reason I didn’t push her away immediately.  
  
She’d successfully triggered my primal urge.  
  
“You smell… incredible,” she murmured, tilting her head up. Under the red neon, I caught the flush at the corners of her eyes. *I bet if I really railed her, her whole face would turn crimson.*  
  
But then I realized—this face looked familiar. I’d seen her before, probably at one of the family banquets.  
  
She was likely one of ours… and I didn’t mess around with women from inside the mafia family. Not worth the trouble.  
  
“Miss, I suggest you show some self-respect.” My voice turned cold as I tried to push her off me.  
  
Her eyes went wide, the color draining from her face. It took her a moment before she parted those plush, sultry lips.  
  
*If I shoved my cock into that mouth… it’d probably feel amazing…*  
  
Then she whispered, disbelief lacing her tone, “Silas?”  
  
I raised an eyebrow. That’s when it hit me—Vincent’s barely-there wife.  
  
I’d heard the rumors: Vincent was screwing his boss now. And it looked like his wife was bold enough to play the same game.  
  
She stammered out an apology. I let go of her and turned to leave. Stuff like this happened every day around here. I just never expected Vincent’s wife to be one of the players.  
  
*Interesting.*  
  
She suddenly called after me, voice trembling with tears. “I… I’m having a bad day. Had too much to drink. You’re really just gonna leave me in a place like this? It’s not safe.”  
  
I turned back. She was pretending to twist her ankle, pale fingers clutching her skirt. Her cleavage was in full view.  
  
A few curious glances had already landed on us. Some rival family spies were watching with interest.  
  
Clever girl. She knew no one would dare lay a finger on someone in my orbit here.  
  
If she wanted to use me, fine. I was curious to see what kind of game she thought she could play.  
  
“Your foot hurts?” I leaned in, watching her pupils contract with tension. “Then I’ll take you somewhere safe.”  
  
With that, I picked her up.  
  
She gasped, arms looping around my neck on reflex. The air filled with a chorus of shocked murmurs. I carried her through the club, feeling how stiff her body was in my arms.  
  
Anyone scheming against the Feron mafia family was probably already trying to figure out who this woman was.  
  
The bulletproof black SUV rolled smoothly toward the Intercontinental Hotel. In the back seat, she was still in a daze.  
  
I glanced at her hand clutching the hem of her dress, knuckles pale.  
  
*She’s starting to realize this little move might drag her into something way deeper than she expected.*  
  
But that’s fine.  
  
In Verona’s underworld, once you step onto my turf, you don’t walk away clean.



**Chapter 3 Happy With What You See?**



Luna Feron's POV:  
  
Oh my god. I actually hooked up with Silas—the real power behind the Feron mafia family.  
  
When Silas carried me out of the Leisure Palace, I could feel every eye on us. Gasps rippled through the crowd, followed by hushed whispers.  
  
I knew what this meant. The Feron mafia family’s top dog was walking out with a woman in his arms—and that woman had just become the juiciest rumor in all of Verona’s underworld.  
  
The spies hiding in the shadows were probably already reporting back to their bosses: Vincent’s wife seduced his cousin.  
  
The thought made me want to die on the spot. No, no, no—knowing Silas, he’d never let a scandal like that leak beyond the Leisure Palace. He’d take care of it. He had to, right?  
  
It wasn’t until I was laid down in the backseat of the car that I finally came to my senses. I opened my mouth to speak, but Silas had already told the driver, “The Continental Hotel.”  
  
His voice carried a kind of unquestionable authority that made my throat tighten. He sat beside me, one hand resting casually on his thigh—those long, clean-cut fingers. I couldn’t help thinking about the rumors: that these were the same hands that took care of traitors in the family without blinking.  
  
And now I was starting to panic. *What if Silas is some devout traditionalist? What if seducing him means… he’ll kill me to keep things quiet?*  
  
But who takes someone to a five-star hotel just to kill them?  
  
*What if he plans to sleep with me first, then kill me?*  
  
The alcohol was wearing off fast. My fight-or-flight instincts kicked in.  
  
Still, under Silas’s watchful eyes, I had no choice but to follow him into the penthouse suite at the top of the Continental Hotel.  
  
As soon as the door shut, Silas grabbed me, slammed me against the wall, and kissed me hard. His right hand yanked up my dress, slipped into my thong, and teased my clit.  
  
The jolt of pleasure shot straight to my brain. That’s when it finally hit me—  
  
*I… I actually pulled it off. I seduced Silas. He brought me to a hotel.*  
  
This felt way easier than I thought it’d be.  
  
*Is this a trap?*  
  
But I didn’t have time to think it through.  
  
Every time I remembered Vincent ramming that woman from behind—his boss—I felt nothing but hatred. Add the alcohol to that, and I wasn’t scared of what came next. I was actually looking forward to it.  
  
Silas was hot. Way too hot. And the way he touched me—this man clearly had a lot of experience in bed.  
  
Not to mention… he was Vincent’s cousin.  
  
*This is the perfect revenge.*  
  
“Go shower,” I said suddenly, a thought flashing through my mind.  
  
I wasn’t about to sleep with him right away. I had something I needed to take care of first.  
  
Silas’s eyes darkened, but then he let out a low chuckle. “I’ll be back to satisfy you in a minute.”  
  
With that, he headed to the bathroom—no sign of concern that I might run.  
  
*Maybe he actually wants me to leave while he’s showering?*  
  
I quickly grabbed my purse and dug through it. I needed to take my medication before he came back out.  
  
Back in college, I had a boyfriend. I didn’t realize what kind of monster he was until I refused to sleep with him—and he tried to rape me.  
  
I fought him off with everything I had. He didn’t succeed, but after that, I developed a serious aversion to physical intimacy. Even the thought of sex made me nauseous.  
  
After I married Vincent, I tried to work through it. But every time things got physical, I’d feel sick. Vincent always told me it was fine and eventually started sleeping in the guest room.  
  
The nicer he was, the more guilty I felt.  
  
I’d even asked a friend overseas to help me buy some medication for my condition. I planned to try again on our one-year anniversary.  
  
Instead, Vincent gave me the world’s most disgusting “surprise.”  
  
I turned my purse inside out—nothing. That’s when I remembered: I’d switched bags before I left the house. The meds were in the other one.  
  
Suddenly, the bathroom door swung open. Silas walked out.  
  
I stared straight at him, swallowing hard. I could feel myself getting wet.  
  
He was a fucking god. His body looked like it belonged on a muscle magazine cover.  
  
Under the lights, his skin had a faint glow of heat.  
  
He scrubbed a towel through his hair and started walking toward me, one step at a time.  
  
“Still happy with what you see?” he asked, his voice low.  
  
“Y-yeah… very.”  
  
I was swimming in his masculine scent, head spinning.  
  
But then I blinked and snapped back to my senses. “Um… I need to step out for a minute. I need to buy something.”  
  
The last thing I wanted was to puke all over him mid-act.  
  
*I have to do this. I need to sleep with Silas at least once. He’s too damn perfect. If I miss this chance, it’ll be my loss.*



**Chapter 4 Goodbye, Uncle**



Silas Feron's POV:  
  
The way she panicked and pushed me away reminded me of a kitten I used to have that scratched me when it got scared.  
  
I’d already finished showering, and she was still in the room. That made her my prey now—and I had no intention of letting her leave my sight.  
  
Tonight, I was going to fuck her until the corners of her eyes turned red—until she cried for me.  
  
I glanced toward the nightstand to remind her: the hotel had condoms neatly arranged in various styles.  
  
The Continental Hotel, after all, was one of the Feron mafia family’s crown jewels. Every detail of the guest experience was taken care of.  
  
She looked a little surprised. Didn’t seem like the type to frequent a place like this.  
  
“I-I’m gonna take a shower,” she stammered. I could hear the tremble in her voice. Her wide eyes looked like a startled fawn’s.  
  
I stared calmly at the tips of her ears as they turned pink and smirked. “You should’ve just showered with me. I could’ve taken you in the bathroom.”  
  
Her ears flushed even redder. That was cute.  
  
She’d clearly thrown herself into my arms on purpose. Every move calculated. But now, when it came down to actual sex, she was acting like a blushing virgin.  
  
Strange. You’d think that now we were alone, she’d keep pushing the seduction. But instead, she was flustered—nervous, even afraid.  
  
When she came out of the shower, wrapped in a towel, I was already hard. I’d wanted to fuck her back at the Leisure Palace.  
  
She was beautiful. Her figure was insanely tempting. And most importantly, her scent didn’t put me off.  
  
“Come here.” My voice came out rough, almost hoarse. My desire was boiling over…  
  
“Dammit… You b\*tch. You really dared to seduce me, huh?” She whimpered beneath me, her pussy wet and warm. I pounded into her. I knew how to make a woman come. One hand gripped her throat while I drove deep into her.  
  
“Oh—no, Silas! I’m gonna die!” Her legs locked around my waist. I got what I wanted—her crying beneath me, her eyes red and watery.  
  
For once, I left the lights on. I wanted to see her—wanted to watch her fall apart under me. Wanted to see the way her whole body flushed when she came.  
  
She was like a drug, addicting, pulling me into endless thrusts, slamming into her over and over again.  
  
Every now and then, I’d slow down, just to tease her. She’d look back at me like a lost deer, craving more.  
  
“Beg for it.” I kept my rhythm slow, my hand tight around her throat.  
  
“Please…” she murmured. But it wasn’t enough. A proper little slut should beg better than that. So I slowed even more.  
  
“Not good enough,” I teased. Then I motioned for her to turn around—get on her hands and knees.  
  
Right then, I wanted to make her fall for me. I wanted her to come back, beg for more, become mine willingly.  
  
“Please, fuck me… fuck me hard! I’m just a filthy slut who needs your big cock…” I’d been holding back long enough. That was all I needed to hear. Before she even finished the sentence, I was pounding into her again, fast and rough.  
  
My hands moved to her tits. They bounced with every thrust. I squeezed and grabbed without mercy.  
  
She moaned like a dog, crying that she was going to die again.  
  
I didn’t even know how long we kept going. At some point, she passed out. Weak little thing. I kept fucking her—her pussy soaking wet, clinging to me like it never wanted to let go.  
  
Eventually, I realized if I kept going, she wouldn’t be able to walk tomorrow. I went to wash up, cooled myself off, then came back and wiped her down. I even dressed her in a fresh pair of panties that my assistant had sent over.  
  
When I finally lay down beside her, my dick was hard again. Damn it.  
  
I didn’t know how long I’d been asleep, but the second I felt her stir, I was fully alert. Still, I kept my breathing steady, pretending to sleep.  
  
In the underworld, the tiniest sound could wake me. I wanted to see what she’d do after a night like that.  
  
Would she ask me to punish Vincent? Or maybe go after the woman Vincent was screwing?  
  
Then I heard the door open. I opened my eyes.  
  
There was a stack of cash on the nightstand. I nearly laughed.  
  
In the financial empire the Feron mafia family controlled, that money wouldn’t even pay for a bottle of whiskey at my club.  
  
She’d also left a note. The line “Goodbye for good” read more like a slap in the face.  
  
She actually thought she could treat me like a one-night stand.  
  
I tossed the note in the trash and pocketed the cash.  
  
Just then, my assistant Carl called. “The plane tickets are ready.”  
  
I fastened my cufflinks and said coldly, “Have someone investigate that woman from last night. I want everything—phone records, social media, bank statements. Go back three months. I want to know everyone she’s come into contact with.”  
  
Before hanging up, I added, “Pay special attention to any links with rival families.”  
  
If she’s clean—not a plant from another mafia family—I might just keep her around as a mistress. Help her get revenge on Vincent.  
  
As for Vincent… the guy’s a horny fool with a temper.  
  
It’s about time he learned a hard lesson.



**Chapter 5 Just Get Divorced Already**



Luna Feron's POV:  
  
My heart was still pounding as I walked out of the hotel lobby.  
  
A blast of disinfectant-scented air hit me as the revolving doors of the Continental Hotel spun open. It stung my cheeks and sobered me up a little more.  
  
Verona’s streets bustled with traffic. Every man in a suit I brushed past reminded me of the cold darkness in Silas’s eyes—that ruthless glint only a mafia boss could carry.  
  
*I really slept with the head of the Feron mafia family…*  
  
This wasn’t a dream. It was real. My body still ached with the memory of last night’s sex.  
  
I couldn’t stop thinking about the way he’d wrapped his hand around my throat, fucking me to the edge of breathlessness and pulling me into an orgasm...  
  
The thought alone left my mouth dry, a wave of heat tingling through me.  
  
I smacked myself in the head and quickly flagged down a cab to head home.  
  
Vincent’s family wasn’t particularly impressive compared to the rest of the Feron mafia family. Most of the time, they were the ones doing the sucking up.  
  
Before stepping inside the house, I double-checked that no suspicious marks were showing on my skin. Only when I was sure did I walk in.  
  
At the foyer, my mother-in-law Claudia’s Hermès scarf lay draped over the carved wooden armchair—one of the “finer pieces” smuggled through the mafia family’s luxury goods ring.  
  
I adjusted my clothes and hair several times in the entryway mirror, making absolutely sure there were no traces left on me—no scent, no signs. Then I took a deep breath and stepped in.  
  
“Mom.” I greeted her, keeping my tone sweet.  
  
“You dare show your face here?!” Claudia slammed her coffee cup down. The sharp clatter of porcelain made me flinch.  
  
Funny. I remembered when I first moved in with Vincent—she’d told me all the dishes were expensive bone china and warned me to be extra careful during chores.  
  
She jabbed a red-lacquered finger at me. The three-carat diamond ring on it glinted with a harsh light—another trophy from the mafia family’s money-laundering casinos.  
  
“Divorce! You’re divorcing my son—now!” she screamed, her voice echoing through the entire living room. The house staff scattered immediately.  
  
That was how things worked in Vincent’s family. When the master of the house got angry, no servant was allowed to witness it.  
  
I clenched my hands so tightly my nails dug into my palms. My eyes drifted to the rhinestone-covered belt on her robe, remembering what she’d said three years ago when I married Vincent: “A girl from the slums who got herself into this family by spreading her legs.”  
  
I knew my background wasn’t impressive. Even as a side branch of the mafia family, Vincent’s family had real power.  
  
But I’d worked hard. Even if I didn’t have access to the mafia family’s underworld, I had carved out my place. A “girl from the slums” had risen to become the chief senior translator at the mafia family’s legitimate corporate front. I wasn’t talentless.  
  
I had endured it all—for love, for this home. I never fought back when Claudia insulted me. I never touched a dime of Vincent’s money. And yet Vincent had still cheated.  
  
I told myself to hold it together. I took a breath and said, “Mom, I didn’t skip the appointment with that doctor on purpose. Something came up at work…” I forced a smile and reached out to take her stiff arm, trying to calm her down before she exploded again.  
  
“Don’t call me Mom!” Claudia yanked her arm away. A strong whiff of Chanel No. 5 hit me, and I wrinkled my nose.  
  
“If you can’t give me a grandson, then divorce my son!”  
  
“Don’t worry. If I can’t get pregnant this time…” I paused, struggling to keep my voice steady, “I’ll divorce Vincent.”  
  
Outside the window, a crow landed on the iron railing and let out a harsh screech.  
  
Claudia’s expression immediately softened.  
  
Her thick palm smacked against my belly like she was checking the quality of a product on a shelf. In her eyes, I was nothing but a surrogate.  
  
I fought the urge to vomit. I thought of Silas’s burning touch on my waist last night—firm and inescapable in a completely different way.  
  
I didn’t bother with Claudia after that. I went upstairs, changed clothes, and drove straight to the office.  
  
Standing in front of the Feron mafia family corporate tower, I caught my reflection in the glass wall—pale and tired.  
  
Between the thirty-third floor where Planning was and the ninth floor where Translation sat, the distance wasn’t just physical.  
  
My eyes burned. I swallowed the lump in my throat and stepped into the elevator. As it rose, the mirrored wall reflected my empty hands.  
  
No wedding ring. Not even a mark.  
  
We’d been married a year, and Vincent had never once worn a ring. He’d told me the mafia family hated nepotism and that we had to keep our relationship secret.  
  
So no one at the company even knew we were married.  
  
Looking back now, *God, I was so stupid.*  
  
From the start, he was just worried our marriage would ruin his value on the family matchmaking circuit—afraid I’d ruin his fun chasing other women.  
  
I dropped my car keys into my purse and caught sight of something: a square cufflink. I recognized the brand—luxury. Just one of those cufflinks cost over 200 grand.  
  
I stared at it, holding it between my fingers.  
  
Vincent could never afford something like this.  
  
And in a flash, Silas’s face appeared in my mind.  
  
My heart skipped a beat.



**Chapter 6 That Woman’s Perfume**



Luna Feron's POV:  
  
Why was Silas’s cufflink in my bag?  
  
In the vast underground empire controlled by the Feron mafia family, a $200,000 cufflink was probably nothing more than a rounding error in their laundering accounts. But right now, it felt like a searing brand against my skin—proof of the madness that had unfolded the night before.  
  
Verona’s midday sun was almost blinding. The glass façade of the Feron mafia family Group’s skyscraper reflected the silhouettes of smuggling freighters docking at the port.  
  
I stepped through the revolving doors in my ten-centimeter heels—only to hear a familiar laugh at the corner. Mixed with the sharp scent of Black Opium.  
  
Vincent · the Feron mafia family. My husband, at least in name. His arm was wrapped around the waist of his boss, Erica.  
  
There was a hickey on the side of her neck, barely hidden beneath the collar of her custom Chanel blouse. I stared at her a moment longer than I should have.  
  
It was her. The same woman I’d seen him screwing last night.  
  
“Vincent.” I called his name, my voice colder than the ocean wind blowing in from the Verona port.  
  
He turned. His pupils contracted sharply—his wife, the one who was supposed to be in Minch, was now standing face-to-face with him and his mistress.  
  
Erica’s fingers, painted in dark polish, traced his collar lazily. She didn’t bother hiding the mark on her neck. Before walking off, she even arched a brow at me—mocking me, laughing in my face.  
  
Once the elevator doors closed behind us, Vincent dropped the act.  
  
“She’s my boss,” he said, loosening his tie. “She was just asking me about last week’s report.”  
  
As his Adam’s apple bobbed, I couldn’t help but recall the way he’d looked and sounded in bed with her last night…  
  
My whole body trembled from rage. *Stay calm. Don’t lose it here.*  
  
In the tight elevator, the scent of his cologne was suffocating. It was the same one Erica wore—strong, pungent, overwhelming.  
  
He noticed me sniffing the air and quickly explained, “My boss is obsessed with perfume. She sprays so much of it, I can’t even escape it!” He even threw in a pained expression for effect.  
  
“Weren’t you supposed to be on a business trip to Minch?” he added, clearly trying to change the subject.  
  
I clutched my clutch bag tighter, my gut twisting, emotions mixing with bitterness.  
  
After what happened to me in college, I developed a trauma around sex. Even after marrying Vincent, I just couldn’t do it. We’d never once consummated our marriage.  
  
Vincent was a normal man. Of course he had needs. He could’ve just been honest with me—told me he needed it. I would’ve tried even harder to face my issues.  
  
But he never said a word. He just ran straight into his boss’s bed.  
  
And now… the thrill of last night’s revenge on him was starting to fade.  
  
“Did you forget?” I said, voice sharp. “Yesterday was our one-year wedding anniversary.”  
  
Vincent’s face twitched. My eyes drifted to the bulge in his jacket pocket—square, box-shaped. A jewelry box.  
  
“I’m sorry. I completely forgot about it. But…” He pulled the box out and opened it. Inside was a diamond ring. “I did get you a gift.”  
  
I stared at the ring.  
  
It was identical to the pair of earrings Erica had on.  
  
Probably meant for her, too.  
  
Disgust rose in my throat. I instinctively took a step back.  
  
“What’s wrong? You don’t like the ring?”  
  
“I do. But we’re at the office. It wouldn’t look good if anyone saw.” I gave the perfect excuse and took the ring from his hand.  
  
He didn’t doubt me for a second. He placed a hand on my shoulder and said gently, “Let’s go out for dinner tonight. I’ll make it up to you.”  
  
That sickly perfume of hers clung to him—it was nauseating. I fought the urge to shove him away.  
  
Ding. The elevator doors slid open. A coworker stood outside.  
  
He was about to step in, but froze when he saw how close Vincent and I were. His eyes lit up with curiosity.  
  
Vincent reacted quickly. He moved his hand off my shoulder and said to the guy, “She’s wearing heels—almost lost her balance. Just lending a hand.”  
  
That explanation—trying to hide our marriage while his mistress could parade around in public—disgusted me more than Erica’s smug smirk.  
  
Back at my desk, my hands trembled as I opened my laptop. The clack of the keyboard mixed with the distant blare of cargo horns from the port outside. An email popped up—from my lawyer. The divorce papers.  
  
I had hard evidence of Vincent’s cheating. He wasn’t going to screw me over financially. I’d make sure I walked away with at least half.  
  
As the sun set, my phone lit up with an emergency assignment from the New York branch.  
  
I didn’t even have time to pack.  
  
I headed straight to the airport that night.

A once minor injury to his wrist from a fall had snowballed into months of stiffness, tingling, and a dull, constant ache that refused to leave.

It wasn’t just discomfort. It was identity-shattering. He was a chef by profession and a father at home—two roles that demanded his hands. When the pain got so bad he could barely chop vegetables or help his daughter with homework, something had to change.

They saw countless doctors. Some suggested rest. Others threw around medical terms that only added to the confusion. One even said, “You’ll have to live with it.”

They were almost ready to accept that—until a friend quietly suggested a consultation with **Dr. Chaitanya Karande**, a hand surgeon in Pune known for handling the complex cases others couldn’t solve.

The first meeting felt different. For once, someone listened to the whole story. Tests were repeated. The real problem—an overlooked nerve compression—was finally explained in words they could understand.

A minimally invasive procedure was performed. It wasn’t dramatic or drawn out. But what followed was.

Within days, the tingling eased. In weeks, he was back in the kitchen. By month’s end, he packed lunch for his daughter for the first time in a year.

He still tells that story—of how one doctor looked a little deeper when others didn’t. Not with drama. Just with gratitude. Because now, he holds his coffee mug, his spatula, and his little girl’s hand—without pain.",2,1750415689.0,OrthopedicDoctorsPune,1,1.0,False

You’re Not Alone, and Here’s a Simple Place to Start","If you’re facing a Type 2 diabetes diagnosis or are concerned about prediabetes, it’s understandable to feel a mix of fear, frustration, and perhaps a sense of confusion. I understand—life in the U.S. is already hectic with work, family, and endless tasks, and now you’re expected to manage blood sugar levels and implement ""lifestyle changes""? 

It can be overwhelming. You may be questioning whether you’ll ever enjoy food again or if you’re destined for a life of limitations. I’ve experienced this, and I assure you, you’re not alone.

The positive news? You don’t need to completely change your life in an instant. Small, manageable steps can significantly impact your blood sugar management and help you feel more in control. Here are three straightforward actions you can take this week to ease into the process:

* **Replace one sugary beverage with water or unsweetened tea:** If you typically reach for soda or sweetened coffee daily, consider substituting just one of those for a glass of water or herbal tea. It’s not about eliminating everything you enjoy—just one small change can reduce your blood sugar spikes and help you feel a bit lighter.
* **Go for a 10-minute walk after dinner:** No need for a gym membership or fancy gear. A brief walk around your neighborhood or even in your living room can assist your body in utilizing sugar more effectively. Plus, it’s a wonderful way to relax after a hectic day.
* **Incorporate a handful of vegetables into one meal:** Add some spinach to your eggs, include carrots in your soup, or snack on bell pepper slices. Vegetables can fill you up, slow down sugar spikes, and don’t require a complicated diet plan.

You don’t need to achieve perfection—just begin with small steps and celebrate your progress. If you have questions or feel uncertain, leave a comment, and let’s discuss it together. You can do this!

    Hello
    
    Please review my resume
    
    
    
    Questions:
    
    1. Should I add metrics? ie: Developed Geographical Eligibility Tool that significantly boosted customer engagement by 15% and conversion rates to 20%
    
    2. Should I add certifications? I believe they are no longer essential, as I have work experience to show off.
    
    3. Should I add more details in education?
    
    4. Should I add earlier work experience?
    
    5. I believe its more efficient to keep my CV the way it is right now, 1 page, not a lot of text, not metrics. Should I increase it to two pages?
    
    Any other suggestions?

Wer kennt’s?","Früher hatte ich 0 € Rücklagen, 0€ Investments, Monatsende hieß im Dispo. Ich war so oft im Minus, dass es sich „normal“ anfühlte.


Letztes Jahr dann zum ersten Mal ein gutes Nettoeinkommen (1.400 €). Zum ersten Mal schwarze Zahlen! Kann 40% Sparrate fahren. Ich habs ernst genommen:
* 3.000 € in ETFs/Aktien & BTC investiert (einmalig).
* 2.000 € Notgroschen aufs Tagesgeld
* Fixkosten automatisiert am Monatsanfang tilgen 
* Rest auf Unterkonten verteilt (aber noch kein ETF-Sparplan eingerichtet)

Aber: Dieses Jahr gabs mehrere große Ausgaben (neues Bett, neues Handy, Coldwallet, Tierarzt, Medikamente, Jahres-Membership…) = Notgroschen aufgebraucht, jetzt wieder -2.000 € im Dispo.

Und ich merke an meinem Verhalten: Coffee to go, Restaurantbesuxhe, Leute einladen, „fuck it“-Denke


Ich glaube, ich hab den Lifestyle zu früh „hochgefahren“- und jetzt fällts schwer, zurückzuschalten. Vielleicht ists auch psychisch: Konsum als Kompensation?


Mein Ziel ist: Dispo tilgen (geht realistisch in 2-3 Monaten mit Zusatz-Einnahmen). Aktien/BTC will ich nämlich eigentlich nicht verkaufen (Steuer, lol). Es ärgert mich halt maßlos da ich eigentlich mehr in BTC und Aktien stecken wollte wo es gerade so ein guter Zeitpunkt zum investieren ist.

Fragen an euch:
* Kennt ihr das „Rückfallverhalten“, wenns mal kurz gut lief?
* Was hilft euch, dauerhaft bei finanzieller Disziplin zu bleiben?
* Reagiere ich zu panisch oder zu wenig panisch??


PS: Dispo-Zinsen liegen bei mir bei ca. 13 %, das tut also auch richtig weh.",20,1750415407.0,Finanzen,97,0.68,False

1lg0lx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1lg0lx8/i_really_struggle_with_this_everyday_im_hit_by/,"I really struggle with this, everyday I'm hit by waves of sadness","I'm new to this subreddit and I don't know all the lingo, but after I've read a few posts I feel like this is the right subreddit for what I'm going through.

I've met my crush 3 years ago. I have a lot of issues with my teeth which require an extensive treatment plan that is spanning on a couple of years. My crush is my dentist. 

It wasn't a ""love at first sight"" kind of thing. For the first few months we just had a professional relationships, making small chat and stuff. She was very caring and focused, but in a professional way. Like making sure nothing hurts, calling me to make sure everything is alright after a big procedure. Normal stuff.

After a few months of going to her almost weekly, we started talking more, chatting about music and life and stuff. We would usually chat 10 minutes before the appointment and just generally have a very friendly attitude. She would make silly/unprofessional jokes and generally treat me like a friend.

We added eachother on social media and started talking. While nothing flirty we talked about personal stuff, sex, depression etc. 
We chatted a few times with video and talked for a couple of hours. That was sometime around in 2023. That was when I started having a crush on her. She's also the same age as me and she's single.

I kept going to my appointments at her, my treatment progressed normally. In the summer of 2023 she started inviting me to hangout, usually with one or more of her friends. She invited me to a concert once but I didn't go. Than she invited me to smoke weed at her place with one of her friends. I expalined to her that I usually don't smoke because I tend to get very anxious and paranoic but I accepted.

I felt good smoking with her at her place. Her friend was really nice and chill and I generally had a good evening.

A couple of weeks after that, after an appointment at her cabinet, she invited me again to her place to smoke, and her friend was to join as a bit later on. I don't know what was different this time, maybe because we also talking about past relationship and guys that she dated recently, but I felt more anxious. I ended up in a panic attack from the weed, and while she was trying to calm me down she asked me if I knew what triggered this panic attack. 

I answered that I think I know why I got so anxious this time, and I told her that I have a crush on her and I feel guilty not telling her that, since I feel like I'm deceiving her by wanting more than a friendship from her. 

She told me that she appreciates me telling her that but she's not dating pacients. I layed down for a bit and went home after that.

The next day we talked about it for a bit. She told me she respects me for having the courage to tell her that and hopes we can still be friends. I told her that I'm responsible for my own feelings and she should not worry about that, we will still be friends and she'll still be my doctor.

Now, while I understand the ""Not dating patients"" response, I do think it's a bit of BS. She told me she got as patients guys that she went on dates from tinder and bumble. And if she really wanted to maintain a professional relationship she wouldn't have invited me to smoke weed with her. 

Anyway, while I felt terrible to be rejected, I guess I never fully processed it. This happened in september of 2023 and at that time I was somewhat okey from a mental health POV. I was seeing my friends, going out, going on dates. I guess I distracted myself from her.

At the same time, in the back of my head, I always thought of it as ""I'm sure when I'll do X, Y and Z she'll want to date me"". Where xyz are things like getting in better shape, having a more active life etc. 

In 2024 I still talked with her on social media but didn't hanged out again and generally just shared with each other silly memes and reels. 

In the summer of 2024 I had some issues with my family which made me spiral into a depressive episode. In december 2024 I stopped taking my meds and stopped seeing my therapist. I had a really rough 2025 so far. In this time I kinda forgot about my crush on her. I wasn't thinking about her daily and didn't think of her so intensily. 

This changed 3 months ago when I was at an appointment with her, when she asked me if everything is okey since she can tell that I'm not my usual self. I explained to her in broad strokes with what I'm dealing with and she told me to reach out to her, to talk and go out. She always put importance on mental health and was very supportive with me going to therapy and seeing a psychiatrist. She asked me if I'm mad at her since she noticed I haven't texted her in a while. I explained to her that I'm not mad at her, I'm just going through some stuff.

Anyway, since then I think about her daily and her rejection hurts like never before. Random stuff that she said to me, like mentioning dates she's been on, hurth me so much more than ever. 

I know that it's probably a combination of me being in a depression spiral, isolating myself, not taking my meds, not seeing a therapist etc. But everything I think about the fact that I'm not good enough for her. And what's worst, even if she wanted to go out right now with me, I know that it would end up badly since I'm in such a bad mess with my mental health. 

I get this feelings of jealously that I didn't had before. Like my mind repeats stuff like ""She didn't want to give you a chance, not even grab a coffee together, but she dates random guys all the time"". I daily get these waves of sadness and I don't know how to stop them. 

I stopped texting her stuff that's not related to dentistry, but it doesn't seem to help.

And yes, I know that the best solution is to find another dentist, but I can't really do that. I paid in advance for my treatment, I have around 6k€ paid in advance and I don't want to put her in a place in which she needs to reimburse me, since that might really jeopardize her business.

So yeah, thanks if you read all this out, it's the first time I write it all out, or really, share it all with someone.",2,1750415326.0,limerence,3,0.75,False
