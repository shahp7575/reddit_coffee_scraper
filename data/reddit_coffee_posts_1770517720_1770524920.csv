 〈Pam pam pam pam Pa ram〉은 남성 보컬 중심의 아카펠라였던 전작 〈Stay with me〉와 달리 여성 보컬로 리듬과 구조를 완성한 원퍼슨 아카펠라 트랙이다. 단 한 사람의 보컬로 쌓아 올린 4/4 그루브 위에서 반복되는 리듬이 중독적인 에너지를 만들어낸다. 악기를 대신하는 것은 테크닉이 아니라 호흡과 타이밍— 몸이 먼저 반응하는 리듬의 기록이다.

Unlike the previous a cappella track “Stay with me,” led by a male vocal,
“Pam pam pam pam Pa ram” is built entirely around a single female voice. Every element is performed vocally, creating a tight 120 BPM groove driven by breath, timing, and repetition. No instruments, no extras—just one voice turning the human body into rhythm.


2. Beso

〈Beso〉는 문 앞에서 멈춘 순간, 말 대신 숨결과 시선이 먼저 닿는 밤을 그린 라틴 팝 트랙이다. 나일론 기타의 리듬과 레게톤 비트 위로 흐르는 여성 보컬은 장난스럽고도 은밀하게, 망설임이 설렘으로 바뀌는 찰나를 포착한다. 커피도, 약속도 필요 없는 시간—남는 건 단 하나, 입맞춤(Beso).

“Beso” captures that suspended moment at the doorway—when words fade and breath, glances, and rhythm take over. Driven by nylon-string guitar and reggaeton-inspired beats, the song blends playful tension with a sensual, danceable flow. No coffee, no dinner plans—just the pull of the moment, sealed with a kiss.

Selling a few unrelated coffee items. All prices include PayPal fees and shipping in the Continental USA.

* **KINGrinder P2 hand grinder**. Currently out of stock in the USA. This is the high clarity heptagonal burr model in the plastic-bodied P series, basically KINGrinder's answer to the 1ZPresso Q Air. Original brush and silicone grip sleeve included. Just deep cleaned. I bought this about 10 months ago with plans to use it as my work coffee grinder, but that plan changed so it's only been a travel grinder on a few trips... not much use. **$38**
* **Kono MDK-41 dripper**. Also seemingly out of stock in the USA. This is is the 3rd generation version version of the Kono which is made of clear PCT resin that's rated to handle 109°C, and has shorter bottom ridges than the 2nd gen opaque colored plastic versions. Similar brewer to the Hario Mugen (mostly smooth inside walls for low bypass), but the short ridged section at the bottom adds contact points to promote consistent flow. Only brewed with this 3 or 4 times... nothing against it, I just own too many brewers. **$22**
* **Sibarist Booster 45**. Sits at the bottom of a flat bottom brewer to drastically increase contact points at the bottom surface and prevent sagging. Selling because I use conical brewers like 95% of the time these days. **$25**",1,1770524775.0,coffeeswap,1,1.0,False

1qyz7xo,https://www.reddit.com/r/JustNoSO/comments/1qyz7xo/is_this_emotional_abuse/,Is this emotional abuse??,"Background: My son J had a chorus rehearsal on 1/29 so I prepared the suit and had him try it on the night before. J promised to wear it nicely and do his best. 

1/29 Thursday

Just 20 minutes before we were supposed to leave for the rehearsal, J refused to put on the suit because he said it was uncomfortable and about to start a temper tantrum. I was a little upset because I tried it on him the day before and he promised to wear it. But despite that I tried to find a soft layering shirt for him and he put the suit on. But he started whining soon after we got him dressed. My husband picked him up and tried to calm him down by offering rewards but he still refused. I was frustrated and insisted that he wear the suit but my husband yelled at me ""You are not helpping!"" He asked me if there are other shirts he can wear I said no. He stormed to the bedroom and grab a random sweater to put on J. 

I did watched J performed the first few minutes. Then I just played on my phone because I was mad at my husband. After the concert I praised J for doing so well but did not engage with my husband for the rest of the night. 

1/30 Friday

I talked to J after school about what happened the night before. I told him I was upset because he broke his promise. Dressing nicely for the concert is the right thing to do. Hope he can do better next time. 

That night my husband sent me a text saying J told him after the concert that he wanted to quit chorus because I was on my phone which was very hurtful to him. My husband demanded I apologize to J. I texted him back saying me and J already talked and it's all good. He was still being mean and sarcastic. I just ignored him. 

1/31 Saturday

It was cold between me and my husband. We did not talked to each much. I was upset but I remain polite.

2/1 Sunday

My husband questioned my again right before if I apologize to J. I told him we already talked and it's all good. But my husband was still mad at me because I did not apologize to J. 

2/2 Monday

We didn't talked much during the day. I had a fever that night, my husband still acted distant.

2/3 Tuesday

Still did not talked during the day. At night, he asked (without emotion) How are you feeling? I replied""Better than yesterday."" 

2/4 Wednesday

My husband started interagate my by starting with ""I don't like how it is between us these days of not talking. So did you apologize to J? "" I told him I already talked to J and it's done. We see it differently and let's just agree to disag and move on. I tried to walked away and end the conversation but he got really angry. He said I did a bad thing, I hurt J really badly and he would not allow me to do that again to our son. I retreated to my study down stairs and locked the door. He stood outside the door and yelled at me for more than 6 minutes, saying I was selfish and had too much pride. I can't just do whatever I want because I'm depressed and have leg pain. I did not engaged but I was terrified. I spent 2 hours in my study after he left. 

I talked to J alone that night. J said he couldn't see me during the performance. He said he did told my husband he wanted to quit chorus after the concert. I ask why to which he said because he has to practice during recess. I praise him for practicing encourage him to keep it up. On the contrary, my husband strongly claimed that J told him he saw me on the phone and that's why he wanted to quit chorus, so he demanded that I should apologize because I did a bad thing. 


2/5 Thursday

I do not want to be yelled at again so I left home after dropping off the kids. Then picked up the kids at 3:30pm and went back home.  

2/6 Friday 

I had a therapy session and my therapist suggested me and my husband have a conversation in the public area to resolve the issue. I left home after 11am. and went to a coffee shop to journal and read book. I picked up the kids at 3:30pm and went back home. 

At around 7pm, my husband my husband escalated his behavior by crying and kneeling in front of the bathroom door where I retreated for safety/space. 

He is using phrases like ""If you loved me, you would come out"" and blaming me for his pain. He is doing this in front of our kids. He said he would fall into depression because of this. And if I didn't open the door I must hated him.

I tried to remain calm and begged him to not do this. I told him we can talked Monday (he was supposed to take the kids to my in laws for the weekend at PA)  at a public place when we are both calm. He cried a few minutes then left for PA with the kids. 

I was in shocked, probably the kids too. 

A couple hours after the incident, he sent me a message. It looks like an apology text but I feel it's not. It's a trap. 

""I am sorry for yelling a few days ago. I'm glad you told me how you felt because it helped me realize it was wrong. For reasons I don't want to get into over text this situation is highly triggering for me and the extended time of no talking makes emotions even worse. But that is not an excuse and it was not right for me to do.

In the future we can consider ways to do a time out if emotions get heated. Not a days Ling time out but maybe 30 minutes or an hour. That could be a lot better of us both to resolve problems much more productively.

But in any case I love you and I am sorry. ""

I don't know what to make of it and I feel miserable.

Went to a coffee place today early and he met me just to say hi and laughs and says he’s actually 58. And I don’t believe him bc I didn’t think he looked 58. So he pulls out his license and yep, 58. So he didn’t turn 52. He turned 58. I made an excuse to leave soon after. And then processed and texted him that it was very rude of him an deceptive to lie about something so bare minimum respectful and truthful. He claimed he “didn’t want to be tied to only older women.” Ummm what? So lying will lower his want for younger women? That makes zero sense. He responded that he understands if I never want to see him again - why would I want to date someone like him.

1qyz5t3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoRulesCalgary/comments/1qyz5t3/britannia_kids_co_daycare_experience/,Britannia Kids & Co Daycare Experience,"I have thought about posting this for a while, and am going to go for it in the hopes of helping someone else with their childcare decision. You can’t trust many reviews online anymore.

I would love to hear opinions from others and their experiences with this daycare.

The main thing that I want to stress is that most of the frontline caregivers are lovely. They are trying their best and working hard to love on the kids in their care. I believe that the culture of this specific childcare location (not sure about other Kids & Co locations) is what is really toxic and has created a very factory-like environment where the staff appears to be extremely burnt out.

My child was there for several months in the infant room, and we moved them out because they were not forming any sort of attachment to staff members. They were crying at drop off most days, and often crying when I arrived at pickup as well. My child did not get to the point of entering their classroom without crying (and I know this is possible, because they now do this at the daycare that we changed to - the adjustment period was less than 1.5 weeks at our new daycare… a stark change).

1. The current director is the source of the problem, in my opinion. She is very cold and seems very disingenuous and performative with the children. I also observed staff body language changing when she would approach them. I believe that she is very hard on the staff and has created a culture where staff are on edge and are scared to make a mistake.

When my child was transitioning into care in the first week, the director sent me a schedule to follow. Something like: day 1, stay for an hour with your child and then go home; day 2, stay for 30min with child and then leave your child with a daycare care giver for 30 min.Etc etc - a gradual buildup.

On day 1 the director asked me to leave my child there after about 20min and go grab a coffee (which was fine, just different than the plan), but the next day, I was still following her suggested schedule to stay a while and she was quite annoyed that I was sticking around - she wanted me to drop and go (which is fine! Probably easier on the child, but it was not the schedule she had laid out). It was a lot of mixed messaging and I felt very anxious with the transition week. FYI I am a second time parent and have been through a transition before (at a different daycare). I can’t imagine how anxious I would have felt as a first time parent. There was a major lack of communication.

She really seems to lack care towards the children. The transition seemed more like an inconvenience and something her and the staff just had to get through/deal with, rather than creating a welcoming and comforting environment for my child. She genuinely seemed annoyed throughout the transition. She was very cold, and this seemed to trickle down as all the staff just seemed so burnt out. One staff member made a comment about “oh ya ya your child will be with us for a few months and then onto the next classroom and the we’ll get someone new” This seemed like there is this factory-like mentality, where the children are seen as numbers going through a system.

The director was away on vacation for one week, and the demeanour of the staff was completely different. You could physically feel the change in their behaviour/mentality. They were relaxed, were more interactive with the children and less concerned about ensuring perfect cleanliness and schedule.

2. This daycare seems to value cleanliness, prompt diaper changes, and meals more than anything else. I get it, these things are important! But it’s all to create a “perfect” image to parents. However, the thing that matters most at this age is attachment to a care giver. And this is completely lacking.

They constantly moved my child between infant rooms (there are 3 infant rooms at least that I know of), so my child was with MANY different caregivers. I would drop off in one room, and pick up in another. There was very little consistency, and even after several months, I was still meeting new care givers that I had not seen before.

This daycare is so large that their staff pool is massive, and so this means a lot of people involved in covering breaks etc in different rooms. Which ultimately results in inconsistent care givers for the child.

Also, it wasn’t just my child that seemed unsettled and lacking attachment/comfort. Nearly every time I walked in there, it would be to the sounds of children crying in many of the rooms. I have never been in a childcare facility before with so much crying. And worse, no one is really doing anything about it. The staff seems so used to it and burnt out, there is barely a response. This is absolutely not the case in our current daycare or my previous experience with my older child’s childcare. It is rare that I hear a child crying when I enter, and if they are, they are being comforted or interacted with.

3. They do have cameras (which is a blessing and a curse I’m sure). I noticed a couple of concerning things. My child would cry a lot throughout the day during the first few weeks (which is to be expected, this is my second child going through childcare transition, I get it). I saw my child stand at the door crying for a period of 15-20 minutes without being approached or comforted. I stopped watching the cameras for extended periods because it was upsetting and I wanted to respect the workers privacy, but often when I would login for a spot check, my child was still at the door crying with no comfort.

The second thing that I saw, the children were around a table setup to do a craft. The care givers had the craft setup for my child, I watched them setup a perfect camera moment to capture and send a photo to me - they put the craft in front of my child, painted a few lines (quickly <5 seconds), and quickly moved out of the frame so that it would look like my child was working on this lovely craft. Once they got the photo, they stopped interacting with my child and moved onto the next child. It was completely set up “activity” just to capture this picture perfect moment to send to parents. The focus was not the activity for the child, it was the presentation of the activity to parents.

4. When I was observing on my first day, they were doing diaper changes without hand sanitizing or changing gloves between kids. I found this quite gross, not sure what the hygiene standard is, but if you’ve just cleaned a poppy diaper on one kid, you should really be changing your gloves before changing another child’s diaper. We got a GI bug while we were there… can’t help but wonder if this contributed.

\- 

It’s hard to fully put into words our experience, but it was overall very disappointing and we ended up moving my child to a much smaller daycare. The new one is a little messier and less picture perfect, but the children are truly forming attachments to their care givers. The difference in my child was night and day after changing daycares.

While at kids & co, my child had been having a lot of night wakings and an insane increase in attachment to me (would not allow me to put them down, which was a huge personality change that did not reverse at all while we were at Kids & Co).

Now at the new daycare, my child was quickly back to playing independently without being held by me constantly and sleeping through the night again. I believe that this is because my child had a secure attachment to consistent care givers at this daycare; this was not the focus at Kids & Co. And this is truly so important developmentally for infants/toddlers.

There was no real horrific specific experience, if I can chalk it up to one thing it is that the culture among staff(I am confident it starts with the director) is very poor. They are so burnt out, and it causes this place to feel like a child factory. The values are completely off - valuing presentation over interaction with the children.",1,1770524344.0,NoRulesCalgary,0,1.0,False

Two days ago, I went in for an appointment. While we were there, my partner updated our doc as to what was happening since the round of antibiotics and the fact that his pain and insomnia hadn't improved. We left with prescriptions for Imitrex and Atarax. Nothing has helped yet. 

Here is how he describes his pain:

SINUS:      
- Pain starts across the soft palate, near where the nasal passages connect to the throat  
- Pain moves to left sinus      
- Left sinus and nostril begin to ""burn""      
- Pain then radiates to lower half of face      
- Pain subsides when swishing water in mouth, but not every time     
- Teeth, sinuses, everything hurts when eating      
- The pain cycles every two minutes or so, sometimes less. 
- RELIEVING THIS PAIN IS HIS MAIN CONCERN. I am including the rest of the post in case any of it may be connected. 
- Has gotten some relief from a saline nasal spray, Sinex pills, and Vicks moisturizing nasal spray, but the relief only lasts a short while. 

HEADACHES:            
- Pain is mostly behind the eyes
- Pain will sometimes travel along the skull from front to back      
- He has described the inside of his skull ""feeling like a sore throat""
- Experiences occasional sensitivity to light and sound, but not all the time       
- No nausea          

INSOMNIA:
- He has tried melatonin, Benadryl, Tylenol PM, and Unisom to try to get some sleep, with no results      
- He typically only sleeps for 20 minutes to an hour at a time       
- Headaches are not what wakes him up. Sometimes it's a panic attack, sometimes it's just a need to be outside (he has been diagnosed with agoraphobia in the past, so we can't make any sense of this at all) 
- When he does sleep, he can only sleep while sitting up in an office chair, which is horrible for his neck, back, and circulation    

MORE PATIENT INFO:     
- 48, male
- Smokes cigarettes      
- He is a medical cannabis patient, and is a heavy user due to his diagnoses        
- He drinks caffeine daily, both coffee and cola       
- He takes ibuprofen and acetaminophen daily       
- Takes Vitamin D, potassium, cranberry supplements daily       
- He is good about staying hydrated, he drinks water and Gatorade regularly      
- Has a laundry list of mental health diagnoses, including anxiety, CPTSD, seasonal affective disorder, and clinical depression. Potentially ADHD and/or autism. 
- Has had trouble with kidney stones, diverticulitis, asthma, and sciatica in the past       
- He is overweight, but is in generally good health with regards to cholesterol, blood pressure, blood glucose, iron levels, testosterone levels, etc. 

As I said, he is uninsured. He makes too much to qualify for financial assistance, but my needs as a disabled person are so expensive that we can't afford to purchase insurance through the portal. We are desperate here, and I'm honestly very scared right now. I have never seen him react to pain as intensely as he's been reacting to this, not even when he had the kidney stones.

The hotel we stayed in offered free breakfast. So I went to check it out and grab coffee.

While I was standing preparing my coffee the lady standing next to me complimented my choice of footwear. I had forgotten my slides and was wearing Christmas socks. That began the conversation of how both of us don't like going barefoot.

I lamented about forgetting my slides and she asked if she could gift me something. I said sure and she left the breakfast area and returned with a pair of new slipper socks.

1qyyz7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1qyyz7a/want_to_change_my_unhealthy_routine_after/,Want to change my unhealthy routine after suddenly losing my mom,"I lost my mom suddenly in November to melanoma. She was 53. I’m 33, we were supposed to grow old together… like, this is absurd. 

I’ve experienced almost every feeling in the past 3 months. I dealt with anticipatory grief for 3 weeks, we were meant to have significantly more time, the doctors had said 6 months… there was a lot of shock, and a lot of trauma, things progressed so much more quickly than anyone could have expected. 

I had to close on my first house the week after I lost my mom. There’s a ton of emotions there, how I bought this house for a new chapter for us, I thought my fiancé and I would start a family… she would have been the best grandma. And obviously all of that’s changed. To be honest I don’t think I want kids anymore. Not the point of this post, but it’s a lot. 

So the first month was moving, whether I had energy to do it or not I had to move. And then it was the holidays, and that was horrible obviously, then new years, equally horrible, and now the weeks are sort of blurring together. 

I took a sickness leave at work that became a layoff, and my days are filled with either painting rooms, or using my phone to completely disassociate. I’ve tried getting into clay and more creative outlets, things I used to be quite good at, but I just keep grabbing this phone. My screentime averages like 7 hours a day, sometimes more, I hate it but the compulsion is so strong to just zone out. I get the why, but I feel like I’m dishonoring her by not taking advantage of the life I have that she doesn’t… and I feel a lot of outside pressure… whether that’s self inflicted, I don’t know. 

I’ve been anxious about leaving the house. I’ve told myself I’ll go to the gym, I’ll finally meet a friend for coffee, I’ll go for a walk, I invested thousands into new snowboard gear thinking it’d be good for me and I haven’t gone once. I can’t get out of this routine. No one’s checking in anymore, my fiancé works away all week and so it’s just me in this big empty house that more than anything reminds me of the life I was supposed to have and now won’t ever… I’m just in a deep pit and I feel really crippled. 

It’s winter, I’m in Canada, it’s freezing and there’s barely any sunlight. And man, I just can’t believe I lost my mom. Like I understand it but it also feels so unreal, I don’t get how people do this. 

I was atheist before, but since she was diagnosed I am struggling so much with the idea death is finite. I genuinely don’t think I can move forward if I can’t force myself to believe in some way shes ok. I really expected to feel her. It’s just so weird because I’ve never believed in any of it, and I expected signs. I expected to be proven wrong.

Between the trauma of her final weeks, missing her, grieving a life she deserved and never got to live, losing a job, and just feeling judged somehow by how I’m grieving, like I’m not being ‘strong’ enough because strength seems to be defined as productivity. And honestly just some really shitty comments from people trying to compare like someone having a terrible year getting bullied at work to my mom’s death… like the pain somehow lives in the same universe… it’s a lot. I’m angry with myself for knowing life is incredibly fragile, random, short, and living like this right now. 

In short. I’m stuck.

I want off my phone, I see the irony in this.

Off late certain ramblings within me continue to observe certain patterns about us humans collectively.

I wish we could pause every once in a while to:

1. Reflect on our journey

2. Smile while having evening tea with family

3. Call up an old friend from school/college we lost to distance/work/busy life

1qyyxvb,https://i.redd.it/ao76cmgv37ig1.jpeg,Theodoros Kalotinis: Tiramisu vs Coffee Addict | Review and Conparison,"Hello:) I’m back again with a review on Tiramisu and a comparison review with Coffee Addict.

Tiramisu by Theodoros Kalotinis

Notes: Cocoa, Coffee, Espresso, Marsala Wine,

Mascarpone, Savoiardi Biscuits, Sugar, and Vanilla.

Okay, so I’ve been wanting to try this for forever since Tirimisu is a favorite dessert of mine and when I have had it, I’m always like, “This needs to be a perfume.” Finally trying this, my jaw dropped to the floor. It is (and surprisingly so, as I’m finding a good coffee note is hard to come by) a photorealistic Tiramisu. Like I don’t even know how to word it but it is spot on. Like truly spot on. Upon first spritz, you absolutely get espresso soaked lady fingers and mascarpone (the opening on this is the most photorealistic). The coffee is so so so well-balanced meaning coffee can come off bitter on my skin it just smells like burnt coffee beans. Not this. This is blended very well and leans more creamy coffee, just like how all the components in Tiramisu mesh well to create that Tiramisu scent. As it dries down, I get more of the the sugar and vanilla, but not too sweet, just a bit sweeter than the opening since I got more of a concentrated coffee and espresso note in the beginning. It’s interesting because the more I smell the dry down, the more I get like a Bianco Latte vibe but at the same time, they aren’t the same. This was soooo good, it was full bottle worthy for me.

Coffee Addict by Theodoros Kalotinis

Notes: Cacao, Caramel, Coffee, and Vanilla

I was super interested to try this because I wanted to see how it compared to Tiramisu. I can definitely say they are different. Coffee Addict is definitely more coffee-forward and I’d say a bit more of a linear coffee scent. This opens up with coffee as well, but it’s a lot stronger. You get a hint of bitterness that coffee gives. I do get the caramel note in the dry down and it’s not like candy caramel, it’s more of like a caramel coffee. More coffee with hint of caramel syrup just enough to sweeten it up and counteract what could have been a more bitter note. It is pretty smooth and I do enjoy the scent especially if I want something with a stronger coffee note.  I don’t get too much cacao or vanilla, however, the vanilla could be adding to the sweetness I smell in the dry down.

Comparison: I tend to gravitate to the creamier coffee scents, so I had a feeling going into this that I would likely prefer Tiramisu more and I have to say at the moment, that is the case. I just love the complexity of Tiramisu, more. I love the creamy note from the mascarpone, and I just feel like this has more depth to it. I do want to say though that maybe down the line, Coffee Addict will be a purchase because it is a coffee scent that I did enjoy even if it seemed more linear. Now what is a big difference in both is longevity and price point. For longevity, Tiramisu lasts longer on my skin and clothes, easily at least an 8 hour work day but I often spray it around 7 am and by 6pm I can still smell it on my clothes. Coffee Addict I wanna say lasts around 5-6 hours on skin and clothes. I know I got more wafts of Tiramisu throughout the day than I did with Coffee Addict. I also feel like projection in general was better with Tiramisu. Price wise, Tiramisu is $175 for 50ml and Coffee Addict is $60 for 50ml. Sooo there is definitely that. All in all, I really love Tiramisu, it’s unique in my collection and it really is what I wanted in a Tiramisu perfume.",2,1770523666.0,Perfumes,1,1.0,False

We spoke for about a week after meeting online. He has been extremely respectful and reasonable during calls and never tried to discuss anything remotely sexual. He and I are both financially responsible, no debt. I am Muslim, I am not so religious. He is catholic and goes to church weekly and volunteers. I asked him if we had kids would he want them baptized? He said we can discuss when we get to that time. 

He asked to meet up Friday. I asked him if we can first do FaceTime. He said no, he will not do any FaceTime. First he said he doesn’t have FaceTime on his phone. I suggested zoom or google meets.He  then said someone recorded him and put him on TikTok as some dating advice. I said ok can we just do a 3 minute FaceTime. He said no to that to. I was like look I haven’t dated in 10 years and I just want to make sure you match your pictures and you can also see I match my pictures. He said no.

I texted him look I’m nervous so I’m sorry I can’t meet you. Good luck to you. 

I went in Reddit and everyone said I overreacted.

I texted him I’m sorry and if you are still up for it, do you want to still meet on Friday. He said yes and suggested Starbucks or McDonalds. I said ok. Then he mentioned there a lot of bathrooms there. This immediately put me off and I again put this on Reddit. I feel like first date, ok let’s go to get coffee at a nice coffee shop or pink berry. I suggested, a church nearby that has a lot of statues, we could walk around for free in the church and talk. But he suggested Starbucks or mckdonalds. 

Reddit was like McDonald’s is not a first date spot at all. Not at 41. I also already had some hesitation so I again told him day before Friday that sorry something came up and I can’t go Friday. He texted today that we can meet up after Ramadan, 6 weeks away.

Now I am not sure what to do. I have very low selfesteem and this is the first time I am trying dating. What really is scaring me is that this guy is 6ft tall, great job, PhD, owns his own house, no debt, doesn’t drink and volunteering at his church. He should easily be able to find a catholic woman at his church. I am a very obese woman, 5’3 and 270lb, why would he be interested in me? 

Please tell me what to do, I grew up in a very traditional family and was never allowed to date. I just have a feeling this guy is off. ",0,1770523432.0,datingoverforty,25,0.33,False

But in the middle of the night she heard a sniffle. A soft sob. “No” came a wine behind her. She turned in bed. As she often did multiple times a week when izuku had nightmares. He cried in his sleep often. Mei gently reached out her well built mechanics arms and pulled him close to give him warmth. He kissed the top of his head “it’s over” she whispered. This one was a lesser nightmare. Soon he trembled. Then halted all together. “I’m sorry” he whimpered an apology, sounding so guilty.

“It’s ok, I was up anyways. Want some water?” She asked , reaching behind her to grab her work bottle. The two shared a drink. Sometimes she’d ask izuku about it. Sometimes she wouldn’t. 

He’d drift back to sleep soon. And so would she.

This was a mild one. Sometimes he’d wake up screaming and sit bolt upright. AFO returning to him in his dreams. Sometimes ripping his quirk out. Sometimes ripping his eyes out and he yells and throws his hands up. Sometimes the monster kills her or his mother. He sees the dead from the war. Peaple he was friends with. Some of them Mei even knew. 

He gave himself a black eye once yelling “midnight!” And bolted out of bed and into the doorframe. Black eye, busted nose. He looked like he’d seen a ghost as Mei readjusted his nose… he had seen a ghost. 

He told her once in his dream he had been fishing with mineta of all peaple. She didn’t remember him. But then he pulled out a photo from his phone. In his dream mineta started crying. And when he went to place a hand on his friend/ classmates shoulder all he saw was blood and someone names la brava with her throat tore open grab him and drag him underwater… it’s happened a few times. It breaks his heart but he’s started pushing mineta into the water first to save himself… and he hates it. 

“Do you want to take the day off?” Mei asked in the morning at breakfast. Izuku handed over her coffee. 

“No I have classes” 

“And someone else can watch over them, you never use up any sick days”

“I’m fine” Izuku fried. His eyebrow raised. Why would he use a sick day? He felt fine.

“The nightmares r getting worse” Mei said. That made izuku pause. It had been 5 years recently, the anniversary. 

“It’s happened before mei. It comes and goes. I’m sor-“

“Don’t apologize for being a war hero, baby. It’s why I love you. I’m not complaining. I’m saying we should do something. When was the last time we both got off work and just. Had a date night?”

This was serious, Mei was willingly offering to leave her work.

“Ok, but not today. Let’s plan something, something we both like, ok? Aside from that what r ur plans today?”

Mei thought about it. “I have a meeting with yaoyarozu” they packed their lunches, kissed, Mei got on her motorbike and rode off. 

“Mei!” The tall raven hair girl called across the hall 

Mei smiled and hugged her friend.

They sat around tea as Mei talked. Jirou showed up and hugged the mechanic aswell. 

“His nightmares r getting worse.”

“Have any plans?” Jirou asked

“I want to take him out of the country for a bit”

“Want to borrow my plane?” Asked momo. Mei smiled. “If you wouldn’t mind… and, one more thing. Mina is gonna be pissed she wasn’t here for this but.. you know how you girls always ask to take me shopping?” Momos she’s widened in joy!

Mei had an asthetic. Work pants, flannels. Tank tops and jumpsuits. She lived in her work cloths. But this? This required her to get a.. ugh, dress. 

An off ornge and white flowery sundress.  (And some sexy cloths as well as actuel swimsuits and not just swimming in cargo shorts like she normally does)

Izuku gets home and is shocked to see his wonderful girlfriend (and likely life partner) in a sundress. Her hair back and holding some bags and an envelope and a key.

“I booked up a trip!”

“W-wha?… Mei? When? Where?”

“Tuvatuva, an island in the pacific. We’re taking Momos PBY boat plane. I already called aizawa. Now, be a good boy and take your girlfriend on a trip”

It wouldn’t get rid of his memories. But atleast he would be out of the country during the 5 year memorial service. 

They sat in the couch under the large window of the landseair plane watching the stars together as the wives lap at the hull of the boatplane. Fresh coat fish on the charcoal grill in the small kitchen of the plane. Warm hot chocolate with plenty of marshmallows. For the weekend the nightmares didn’t show up. Izuku kissed his lovely girlfriend. She cuddled into his broad chest as the night birds and island animals lived only a couple hundred meters away from were they were anchored.

1qyyoz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConnectBetter/comments/1qyyoz7/the_psychology_of_instant_likability_8/,The Psychology of Instant Likability: 8 Science-Based Tricks That Actually Work,"I used to think charisma was some genetic lottery. Like you either had it or you didn't. Spent years watching certain people walk into rooms and instantly become the center of gravity while I stood there like a potted plant. Then I fell down a rabbit hole of social psychology research, communications books, and way too many hours of Charisma on Command videos. Turns out likability isn't magic. It's mechanics.

The wild part? Most of what we think makes us likable (being impressive, having achievements, looking perfect) actually works against us. Science shows the opposite is true. Here's what I learned from digging through studies and testing this stuff in real life.

**The pratfall effect is your secret weapon.** Harvard psychologist Elliot Aronson discovered that competent people who make small mistakes are actually MORE likable than those who seem perfect. When you spill coffee or mispronounce a word, you become human. Relatable. The key is pairing vulnerability with competence. Share your fuck ups naturally. ""I completely blanked on my own presentation slide yesterday"" hits different than pretending you're flawless. It gives people permission to be imperfect around you too.

**Ask for small favors, not just offer them.** This one broke my brain. Benjamin Franklin figured it out centuries ago. When you ask someone for a tiny favor (borrowing a pen, recommending a book), their brain has to justify why they helped you. The conclusion? They must like you. It's called the Ben Franklin effect and it's been replicated in dozens of studies. Counterintuitive as hell but it works because people want their actions to align with their beliefs. Just keep the ask genuinely small and specific.

**Master the name game but make it genuine.** Dale Carnegie preached this in How to Win Friends and Influence People, the book that's sold 30 million copies for a reason. But here's the thing everyone misses. It's not about mechanically repeating someone's name like a sales robot. It's about actually remembering it, then using it naturally when it matters. ""Hey Sarah, what did you think about that?"" feels completely different than ""Hey, what did you think?"" Your brain releases dopamine when it hears its own name. Use that power, don't abuse it.

**The two second rule changes everything.** Vanessa Van Edwards talks about this constantly on her Science of People platform. Hold eye contact for two full seconds longer than feels comfortable when you first meet someone. Not in a creepy way, in a ""I'm actually present"" way. Most people break eye contact immediately because they're nervous or distracted. Those extra two seconds communicate confidence and genuine interest. It's uncomfortable at first. Do it anyway.

**Strategic self disclosure builds trust faster than anything.** Dr. Arthur Aron's research at Stony Brook showed that asking progressively personal questions creates intimacy rapidly. But you can't just interrogate people. You have to match their vulnerability level and share about yourself too. Start surface level, then go deeper if they reciprocate. ""What do you do"" to ""what made you choose that path"" to ""what's the hardest part of it."" This is how strangers become friends in a single conversation. The app Finch actually uses this psychological principle in its journaling prompts to help you build emotional awareness, which makes these conversations feel more natural.

**Mirroring works but only when it's subtle.** Social psychology research shows that subtly matching someone's body language, speech patterns, and energy level makes them feel understood on a subconscious level. Lean back when they lean back. Match their pace of speaking. If they're animated, show enthusiasm. If they're calm, bring your energy down. The moment you're obvious about it, it becomes manipulation and people can smell that. But done naturally? It's like speaking their emotional language.

**Remember the details that nobody else does.** This isn't about having a photographic memory. It's about actually listening when people talk instead of just waiting for your turn to speak. When someone mentions their dog is sick, ask about it next time you see them. When they said they had a big presentation on Thursday, follow up on Friday. The bar is literally on the floor here because most people are so self absorbed. The book [Never Eat Alone](https://www.amazon.com/Never-Eat-Alone-Expanded-Updated/dp/0385346654) by Keith Ferrazzi breaks down how this one habit built his entire network. It's not networking, it's actually giving a shit.

**Create inside jokes and shared experiences.** This is peak bonding behavior. Psychologists call it ""social glue."" When you reference something that happened between just you and another person, you're reinforcing that unique connection. ""Remember when the projector exploded during that meeting?"" becomes shorthand for ""we have history together."" Comedy podcasts like Smartless do this constantly, it's why their chemistry feels so natural. Look for these moments, then reference them later. It signals that your interactions matter enough to remember.

Here's what nobody tells you though. These tricks mean nothing if you're using them to manipulate people into liking a version of you that doesn't exist. They work best when they're tools for expressing genuine interest and connection, not manufacturing fake relationships. The research consistently shows that authenticity beats technique every time in the long run.

The book The Like Switch by FBI agent Jack Schafer goes deep on this stuff from a behavioral analysis perspective. Insanely good read if you want to understand the actual neuroscience behind social dynamics. He spent decades getting criminals to trust him, so he knows what he's talking about.

For anyone wanting to go deeper without committing to reading full books, there's [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450), an AI learning app built by former Google experts that pulls insights from sources like The Like Switch, Never Eat Alone, and research on social psychology. You can set a specific goal like ""become more charismatic as an introvert"" or ""improve small talk skills,"" and it generates personalized audio lessons and a structured learning plan based on your unique situation. You can adjust the depth from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples, and customize the voice to whatever keeps you engaged. The adaptive plan evolves as you learn, so it's not just random content but actually builds on itself.

Most people never study this because they think social skills should just come naturally. But nobody is born knowing calculus either. Some things require learning. The difference is that these skills will serve you in literally every area of life. Every relationship, every job, every random interaction at a coffee shop.

motivation all wrong.
I used to think I was just lazy. Like genuinely broken. I'd stare at my laptop for hours, refreshing
the same three apps, knowing I had shit to do but physically unable to start. The guilt was
suffocating but somehow still not enough to make me move.
Then I went down this rabbit hole of research on procrastination, dopamine systems, and why
our brains are basically working against us in the modern world. Read a bunch of books, binged
podcasts from neuroscientists, watched way too many lectures. What I found actually explained
everything. And more importantly, gave me tools that work.
Here's what actually helps when you can't make yourself work:


**Your brain isn't broken, it's just operating on outdated software**
Dr. Andrew Huberman (Stanford neuroscientist) explains that our dopamine system evolved to
reward immediate survival tasks. Checking for predators, finding food, that kind of thing. Your
brain literally cannot distinguish between ""scroll TikTok for instant novelty"" and ""finish this report
that matters for your future."" One gives immediate dopamine hits. The other gives... anxiety
about the future, which your primitive brain doesn't give a fuck about.
This is why you can spend 4 hours on Reddit but can't focus on work for 10 minutes. It's not a
character flaw. Your brain is doing exactly what it evolved to do, it's just really bad at modern life.


**The 2 minute rule actually works but not how you think**
Everyone knows about ""just start for 2 minutes"" but here's why it works. Starting is 90% of the
battle because your brain's reticular activating system kicks in once you begin a task. It's like
momentum for your attention.
But here's the trick nobody mentions. You have to make starting completely brainless. Not ""work
on the essay for 2 minutes."" That's still too much. Instead: ""Open the document. Type one
word."" That's it. Your brain can't argue with that level of simple.
I started using the Finch app to gamify this stuff. It's this little bird that grows as you complete
tiny habits. Sounds stupid but having something external track my ""open laptop"" or ""write 50
words"" streaks weirdly works. Makes the invisible visible.


**Environment design beats willpower every time**
Read [Atomic
Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299) by James
Clear (sold over 10 million copies, this guy studied behavior change for years). The core insight
is that willpower is finite and unreliable. But your environment is controllable.
I started treating my phone like a temptation landmine. Literally put it in another room when I
need to work. Not on silent. Not face down. Gone. Because every time I see it, my brain goes
""maybe someone texted"" and that maybe is enough to derail everything.
Also, I have different Chrome profiles now. One has all my time waste sites blocked (using Cold
Turkey blocker), one doesn't. Sounds extreme but removing the option to procrastinate is way
easier than fighting the urge 47 times a day.


**Your brain needs a dopamine baseline reset**
Dr. Anna Lembke wrote this book called Dopamine Nation. It's about how we're all basically
addicted to easy dopamine and it's destroying our ability to do hard things. She's the psychiatry
chief at Stanford and sees this pattern in everyone, not just addicts.
Her solution is counterintuitive. You need to do boring shit on purpose. Let yourself be bored.
Stop checking your phone every 3 minutes. The constant stimulation is raising your dopamine
baseline so high that normal activities (like work) feel impossibly unrewarding by comparison.
I tried her 30 day dopamine fast lite version. No social media, no video games, no YouTube
rabbit holes. First week was hell. Second week my brain started finding work interesting again
because it was literally the most stimulating thing available. Sounds dramatic but it genuinely
recalibrated something.
For anyone wanting to go deeper on the science behind motivation and habit formation without
grinding through dense research papers,
[BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) has been
useful. It's an AI learning app that pulls from books like Atomic Habits and Dopamine Nation,
plus research on behavioral psychology and procrastination, and turns them into personalized
audio content. You can set specific goals like ""build better work habits as someone with ADHD""
and it creates a structured learning plan with episodes you can customize from quick 10-minute
overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples. The depth control is helpful when some
topics click and others don't. There's also a virtual coach you can talk to mid-episode if
something doesn't make sense. Makes it easier to actually retain this stuff instead of just
reading and forgetting.


**The motivation equation is backwards**
We think: motivation, action, results. But it actually works: action, results, motivation. You don't
wait to feel like working. You work, see tiny progress, then feel motivated to continue.
This is why the Pomodoro method works. Not because 25 minutes is magic, but because you
rack up small completions that generate their own momentum. I use an app called Forest that
grows a tree during focus sessions. Again, sounds childish, but watching the little forest grow
gives my brain that ""I'm making progress"" hit it needs.


**Procrastination is usually fear in disguise**
[The Procrastination
Equation](https://www.amazon.in/PROCRASTINATION-EQUATION-Piers-Steel-PhD/dp/006170
3621) by Dr. Piers Steel (he analyzed like 800 studies on this) found that we don't procrastinate
because we're lazy. We do it because:
The task feels overwhelming (solution: make it smaller)
The reward is too far away (solution: create artificial short term rewards)
We're scared of failing or it being imperfect (solution: give yourself permission to suck)
That last one is huge for me. I procrastinate most on things I care about because what if I try
hard and it still sucks? So I've started telling myself ""this draft is allowed to be shit"" before
starting anything. Takes the pressure off.


**Your dopamine system needs scheduled chaos**
Here's something weird that works. I schedule my procrastination now. Sounds stupid but I tell
myself ""at 3pm I can scroll Reddit for 20 minutes guilt free."" Knowing it's coming makes it easier
to resist in the moment. And when 3pm hits, half the time I don't even want it anymore because
it's no longer forbidden fruit.
Also started using structured procrastination. When I can't make myself do the main task, I do
other productive stuff instead. Can't write the report? Fine, I'll answer emails or clean my
workspace. At least I'm not watching YouTube. And usually the movement breaks the paralysis.


**Sleep and exercise aren't optional**
Every productivity book mentions this and everyone ignores it because it's boring advice. But
Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker (neuroscientist at UC Berkeley) shows that even slight sleep
deprivation murders your prefrontal cortex function. That's the part of your brain that does
discipline and focus.
I started tracking my sleep with my watch and the correlation between sleep quality and ability
to work is honestly insane. Under 7 hours and I'm basically useless. Over 7.5 and I can actually
do hard things.
Same with exercise. I hate that it's true but a 20 minute walk before work genuinely changes my
brain's ability to focus for hours. Something about BDNF and blood flow. I don't fully understand
the mechanism but I can't argue with results.


**The real trick is removing friction everywhere**
I spent a weekend doing a ""friction audit"" of my life. Every point where I have to make a decision
or overcome resistance is a place I might fail. So I removed as many as possible.
Work clothes laid out the night before. Coffee maker on a timer. Laptop already open to the right
document. Phone in another room. All my daily tasks written down so I don't have to think about
what's next.
Sounds robotic but decisions drain willpower. The fewer I make, the more I have left for actual
work.
Look, I'm not gonna pretend I've figured it all out. I still have days where I accomplish nothing
and feel like garbage. But understanding why my brain fights me has made it way easier to work
with it instead of against it. Your brain isn't the enemy, it's just really bad at delayed gratification.

1qyylf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialBlueprint/comments/1qyylf0/how_to_be_the_best_boyfriend_sciencebased_stuff/,How to Be the Best Boyfriend: Science-Based Stuff That Actually Works,"okay so i've been diving deep into relationship psychology lately. watched way too many podcast episodes, read a bunch of books, talked to couples therapists. not because i had some crisis, but because i noticed this pattern: so many guys (including past me) think being a good boyfriend is about grand gestures and constantly trying to ""fix"" things. we overthink it. we perform. we try to be perfect.



spoiler: that's exhausting and it doesn't work.



here's what i learned from actual research and people who study this stuff for a living. nothing groundbreaking, but the application? that's where it clicks.



the emotional stuff (yeah, feelings matter)



 just listen without trying to solve everything. this one comes straight from relationship expert Esther Perel's work. when your partner vents about their day, they're usually not asking you to fix their coworker or their boss. they want to feel heard. i used to jump into solution mode immediately. now? i ask ""do you want my thoughts or do you just need to vent?"" game changer. sounds simple but it's wild how often we mess this up.



 emotional availability isn't weakness. guy winch talks about this in [Emotional First Aid](https://www.amazon.in/b/?ie=UTF8&node=976390031&ref_=sv_ba_4) (he's a psychologist who basically studies how we handle relationship wounds). the book breaks down why suppressing feelings creates distance. sharing what's actually going on in your head, even when it feels vulnerable, builds intimacy. not oversharing everything, but being real about your emotional state. this book genuinely made me rethink how i show up in relationships. it's not just relationship advice, it's about emotional health overall.



 regulate your own shit. this is huge. Attached by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller digs into attachment theory (secure, anxious, avoidant styles). understanding your attachment pattern helps you recognize when you're spiraling or pulling away. the book explains why some people need constant reassurance while others ghost when things get intense. super eye opening. knowing your triggers means you can handle them instead of dumping them on your partner.



the practical everyday stuff



 small consistent actions beat big gestures. relationship researcher John Gottman's work shows that it's the daily moments that matter most. making coffee without being asked. remembering the small details. texting ""thinking about you"" randomly. these micro moments build what Gottman calls ""emotional bank account."" big romantic gestures are cool but they don't replace consistent presence.



 have your own life. counterintuitive maybe, but maintaining friendships, hobbies, and goals makes you more interesting and less codependent. Esther Perel talks about this in her podcast Where Should We Begin? (insanely good, she does real couples therapy sessions). she emphasizes that desire needs space. being glued together 24/7 kills attraction. you need separateness to have togetherness.



 communicate about sex honestly. yeah this feels awkward but the Gottman Institute has tons of research showing that couples who talk openly about intimacy have better relationships overall. not just during sex, but actual conversations about wants, boundaries, fantasies. Emily Nagoski's book Come As You Are is fantastic for understanding how desire actually works (hint: it's way more complex than we think). this applies to understanding your partner too.



the growth mindset stuff



 apologize properly. harriet lerner's [Why Won't You Apologize](https://archive.org/details/whywontyouapolog0000lern)? breaks down how most apologies suck. we add ""but"" or make excuses. a real apology is ""i messed up, this is what i did wrong, here's how i'll do better."" no justifications. takes practice but it's powerful.



 work on yourself continuously. use something like the Finch app for building better habits and self awareness. it's a self care pet thing (sounds weird but stick with me). you complete little tasks, journal prompts, reflect on your day. helps you track patterns in your behavior and mood. 



if you want something more structured for connecting all these insights, there's [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-anything-befreed/id6739747450), an AI learning app that pulls from relationship books, research papers, and expert talks to create personalized audio content. you can set a specific goal like ""become more emotionally available in my relationship"" and it builds an adaptive learning plan based on your unique situation and communication style. 



the depth is adjustable too, from quick 10-minute summaries when you're busy to 40-minute deep dives with real examples when you want to really understand attachment theory or conflict resolution. it includes all the books mentioned here plus tons more relationship psychology resources. plus there's a virtual coach you can talk to about specific challenges, which honestly helps when you're trying to apply this stuff in real situations. makes the whole learning process way less overwhelming.



being a better person makes you a better partner, and tracking your growth keeps you accountable.



 actually ask what they need. sounds obvious but we assume so much. different people need different things. some want quality time, others want acts of service, physical touch, words of affirmation. the 5 Love Languages is a bit cliche at this point but the core idea holds up. just ask ""what makes you feel most loved?"" then do that thing. repeatedly.



real talk: this isn't about becoming some perfect boyfriend robot. it's about showing up as a complete human who gives a shit. who's willing to be uncomfortable sometimes for the sake of connection. who understands that relationships are built in mundane tuesday afternoons, not just special occasions.



the research is clear: healthy relationships require emotional intelligence, consistent effort, and genuine care. not perfection. not always getting it right. just trying, learning, and showing up.



you don't need to implement everything at once. pick one thing. try it for a week. see what happens. growth is incremental, not instantaneous.",1,1770522632.0,SocialBlueprint,0,1.0,False

Open for longterm and people from anywhere,"Weekend has been so cold and windy here. Cannot even step out without freezing cold. Have been enjoying the cozy and warm home with some coffee. How are you spending your weekend?

I would love to provide brief description about me and my interests.

I started going to the gym couple months back. I have been fairly consistent which has been nice. Slowly have been losing some weight. I do strength training, cardio, and end it with couple minutes in sauna. It has been super relaxing to end with sauna. Using gym to tone my body.

I cannot wait for formula 1 season to start. It will be super interesting with the new cars. I got into formula 1 after watching drive to survive series on Netflix. Slowly learned about strategies which got me more addicted to the sport.

I would love to start traveling now that time allows it. Love to learn about new culture and people. Helps to open my mind. Also, gives a chance to learn and enjoy new cuisines. Would love to go to Italy, and Japan as the top destinations.

I love to watch tv shows and movies. Mostly watch actions and thrillers. Waiting for new season of Night Agent to come. Been a while since I watched documentary. I used to watch quite a lot. I have not found any good one recently.

I listen to mostly all the genres of music except metal, and rock. Those sound too loud to me. Although if someone recommends a good music of those genre, I would definitely listen. I am always looking for new songs. I love to listen to music especially when driving. It is therapeutic.

I do like bake and cook. For most part I bake. I have made many different things like brownies, cheesecake, oreo cake, muffins, cinnamon rolls, garlic rolls, and puff pastries.

Hope this gives you some idea about me. Would love to learn more about you. Looking forward to talking to you. I know I am new on reddit. Definitely would understand if it makes you not reach out.",1,1770522628.0,chat,0,1.0,False

Totally a 5 star game for me and it made me into a true Digimon fan. I do however have some things that bothered me and I wanted to talk about it

Date : 
Date is best girl. For that reason I invited her on as many capture territory missions as I could early on, I thought her having a Digimon was just something that happened off screen. Come chapter 17 and we are introduced to her Digimon which then also digievolves. I don't know if you could invite her to any other missions with her digievolved partner after that as  I din't check but it still felt weird seeing my characters reaction to something I knew for most of the game.


The cafeteria quest :
One of the major themes of the game is how memories are sacred and how they make us who we are. This sidequest goes against all that as we are made to willfully give up on our memory. The Batista's argument doesn't make sense since, well, if you don't remember something happening it loses its significance of it doesn't have everlasting effects (like the end of the game), and even if they did it so we wouldn't be addicted to the coffee, they brainwashed another human, altering a MAJOR part of her personality. The client for that case went from loving coffe and having it as a major part of her life to not even liking it ? That's evil in my opinion. Also this wasn't like a sidequest, it was a major thing that couldn't be skipped and we lost our memory AFTER we won. It just felt bizzare to me.

**1. Photon Latency (Morning Light Timing)** Getting bright light within 20 minutes of waking sets your circadian clock. I track this daily and the correlation with my afternoon energy is insane.

**2. Caffeine Metabolism** My half-life is \~5.5 hours (I'm a ""normal"" metabolizer). That means if I drink coffee at 2 PM, I still have 50% of that caffeine in my system at 7:30 PM. No wonder my sleep was trash.

**3. Chronotype Alignment** Once I stopped trying to be a ""Lion"" (early bird) and accepted I'm a ""Bear,"" I restructured my day. Deep work from 9-12, admin work after lunch, creative work at night.

**The Tool:** I built an app called ARC to track all of this automatically. It identifies your chronotype, maps your energy peaks, and creates a ""Daily Trajectory"" you can follow.

That’s the current extent of my planning. I last visited SB 6+ years ago (pre-COVID) for a short business trip, but I recall being wowed by the area.

I love wine - she barely drinks. But we’ve been to Napa before and she thoroughly enjoyed it; the scenery, the nice restaurants, the people, cute shops, and even learning more about wine (even though she probably didn’t have more than 3 sips!). 

A little about my wine journey…up until the last year or so I leaned towards rich, heavy cabs (e.g., Silver Oak, Venge, Hall). But in the last year I find myself preferring lighter cabs (from Mount Veeder, Howell Mtn) or heavier Pinot’s. To date I am not a fan of lighter, nuttier Pinot’s…tastes like I’m drinking water. 

Here is our perfect wine country vacation day:

\- Hotel/resort: stay at an upscale, quaint place; Four Seasons-ish…though their hotels can be big. Budget is <$1,000/night.

\- Casual, upscale coffee shop and/or breakfast spot.

\- Winery visit within a 30 minute drive of SB.

\- Casual lunch spot - even a nice burger or great salad spot works.

\- Winery visit within 30 minute drive of SB.

\- Back to hotel to either chill out or maybe some spa time.

\- Nice restaurant meal. I am NOT into unnecessarily over-priced restaurants (French Laundry?!; never been), or Michelin Star places that charge $50 for one small piece of…something…that looks pretty on a plate but you’d need 20 of them to amount to an entree. 

\- We are also open to dropping a winery visit if there is something really interesting we should do or visit.

HP printers can be remotely disabled if subscription or systems fail. Cartridges are physically modified to force subscriptions. Support loops endlessly. This has been two years of documented evidence.

This isn’t a tech rant. It’s a warning about how ownership is being replaced by monitored permission, to those techs 

/Corporate apologists and ones who buy into this rhetoric forced narrative who say 

you agreed to terms

it’s how it works 

User Error or 

You sound unhinged 

So what That's fine but I. 

I did not agreed to property I purchased, outrightPaid for use in my private property, my home 

To print my private or even public document,

to be controlled by outside powers.

It is trespass, it is control it is Gaslighting

I don’t like it, that is all, I don’t have to like it I don’t have to agree with it.

I certainly don’t have to just accept it, if you want to go ahead, fill your boots 

Your welcome too it, have my share 

 I give Far warning to all

This is long because, it is 

It is what I have Lived with and  experienced for over  2 years 

It is my Experience it is real 

It still on going 

Yes, I’m stubborn to the point of obsession when something is wrong. This is now a matter of principle.

I am now in certain parameters of 

Refusing to surrender, give up accept and bend over, just plain take it, Thanks very much.

I find now that I can no longer tolerate or turn a blind eye 

Or stand in Silence or ignore this type of bs 

This is a self protection mode for me now 

I think I have reached a Zero Tolerance Level that to simply ignore and turn another Blind Eye, would actually make me blind and swallow my own tongue and choke 

So F That .

Here I go 

I don’t care if you all freak at me for it being too Long For Reddit 

It’s a platform for interaction, questions and answers and opinions 

Who has the right to berate another for saying anything on anything 

For any length 

If you don’t like reading something 

Long then stop no body is making you read it

Wake up and own up 

If you continue reading it is because you chose to.

Nobody forced you 

Nobody has a gun to your head 

Simply stop and leave, there nothing else.

Because I dont care about Up votes or down votes 

I have no interest in that. It is not real.

I do not understand what that is all about 

I dont want to know what it is for or about 

I means nothing I my reality nor do I want it to.

If you haven’t guessed I am Gen X 



I am currently in a battle with HP 



My old HP printer went to printer heaven it was great had lasted over 15 years.  



So I thought new printer 

HP with Same Cartridge Size ad I had just purchased Ink Cartridges.



Found latest model that uses same Cartridge Size etc. 

Simple right, logical 

Wrong 



I set everything up great Simple 

Easy 

It even came with 9 months of Free Ink /Cartridges.

Great I thought 



They were Even already Fitted.

Terrific.



Started printing.



Used Ink I went 12 months 

I don’t print much 

Great .



Started getting notifications running low on Ink 

Subscribe for Insta Ink 

For your ease no run out of Ink or paper etc.





Thought.  I don’t need that 

I have plenty of paper, I gave the old Cartridges, exactly the same code Cartridges Same Same right 





Wrong Wrong Wrong 





I spent a couple of hours, trying to fit those Cartridges.

Same HP Cartridges 

Same Code number 

Same Size XL 

Same Same Same 



Until I finally 

Sat down Flummoxed both Cartridges side by side old ones and the ones that came with the printer institut



I did not understand, I had put the new uses back in and out 

They fitted, the old ones that I had never open for 12 months sitting in the boxes waiting 

NOW SITTING TAUNTING ME 





They look Exactly the Same 

THEY ARE EXACTLY THE SAME 

WHATS WRONG WITH ME WHY CAN I GET THEM IN

I AM PUTTING THE IN THE SAME WAY 

NOT BACK TO FRONT OR ANYTHING WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON. 



AM I HAVING SOME SORT OF MENTAL BLOCK 

SOME SORT OF COGNITIVE FIT.

HAVE I STEPPED INTO SOME SORT OF PARALLEL TIME PERIOD VORTEX WHERE OPTIC ARE DIFFERENT/ DISTORTED 



I got out my magnifying glass (yes, I know I am a freak, I don’t need telling but I grew up with a Father chemical structural engineer and 5 brothers, I am what I am )



The magnifying glass broke the case.



There is such a miniscule difference in the Structure of the Cartridge Case and therefore the interior of the receiving enclosure/holder that stops the the Old Printer Cartridges fitting 

Even though they are technically the very same product.



So I thought. 

Forget that I dont need a Subscription, even more I Don’t Want a Subscription.

I will Just buy the Cartridges 

Forget these ones, Let it go they don’t fit, I will just buy new Cartridges 

Just like I did before for my old reliable,  excellent HP old boy trusty printer Right 



Wrong Wrong Wrong 



You cannot buy them any here other than via HP AND TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY YOU CAN NOT BUY THEM WITH OUT THAT MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION. 

WHICH MEANS 



DIRECT DEBIT 

CHOSE YOUR LEVEL OF PRINTING PER MONTH PER PAGE 

PER MONTHLY AMOUNT.

THEY REMOTELY MONITOR YOUR PRINTER 

HOW MANY PAGES YOU PRINT 

IF YOU PASS YOU NUMBER OF PAGES 

AUTOMATIC EXTRA CHARGE PER PAGE PRINTED 

EVEN IF IT IS NOT A FULL PAGE IF A4

SO IF YOU PRINT A DOCUMENT THAT IS OVER TWO PAGES THE SECOND PAGE CAN JUST BE 2 LINES OR YOU DIDNT CHECK LAYOUT FIRST AND YOUR FOOTER PRINTIN OVER RUMS TO NEXT PAGE 

YEAH YOU JUST LOST ONE OF YOUR MONTHLY ALLOWANCE PAGES.



Then if for some reason your direct debit fails 



It happens sometimes through no fault or lack of money, but just timing etc. other direct debit clearly first or late transfer if funds, miss a bank notification by an hour to transfer funds you are sunk, I like a nap lol, I am night owl, work from home 

I sleep late I work late it is peaceful.

No interruptions, being dyslexic I can focus, staying in a zone is easier, my husband goes to bed, doing accounts, vat etc. is far easier than dealing with, where are the scissors, or were is my, in the same place they gave been for the last 20 years that you as grown man has lived in absolute bs.

I diverse. Sorry 



Miss one direct debit

YOU MUST ENROL YOUR PRINTER TO USE THE INSTA INK CARTRIDGES YOU HAVE IN YOUR PRINTER 

THAT BASICALLY YOU ALREADY PAID FOR LAST MONTH.

YOU THEN HAVE TO GO THROUGH  ENDLESS RUBBISH UPDATING PAYMENT RUBBISH 

MISSING DIRECT DEBIT ALSO MEANS DISCONNECT 

OR SO THEY TELL YOU

NO IT HAS NOT 

IT STILL TELLS YOU

My printer works 

You are clearly blocking printer 

I suspect you will if I in desperation pay for the warranty my printer will suddenly start printing again.

I am not going to do that.

They still say 13th Oct. 

They still pretend 

That  have not done every test and tech support process possible, that they want to do it all again 

They still attempt to treat it everything as a new issue /complaint 

Every time the latest 

Support tech tells me 

Oh my shift is ending 

I will come back to you tomorrow I promise 

No you won’t have to explain everything again or go over everything again. Or answer the same

Question. Smiley Face.

Thank you for your patience  Smiley Smiley.

They want you to lose it start swearing and then they can cut you off 

They are still sending warranty alerts 

They are still taking payment 

They are not sending ink 

They are not sending paper 

Why because they know I am not printing.

Even if they ever do let my printer actually print again. 

I would not use it.

I Will only ever use it as a scanner because it’s easier than Using scanner and saving it that the camera on another device.

1qyy4jg,https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftFlightSim/comments/1qyy4jg/working_on_a_new_career_mode_that_is_not_behind_a/,Working on a new career mode that is not behind a subscription paywall,"Hi, I am FBT. I code in my spare time. I have been a flight simmer for many years, but I have always been deeply unsatisfied with the ""career mode"" simulators out there. One of my biggest pet peeves is that today’s world is populated with subscription-based software. I really dislike that. I am building something different. I want to build software that is widely available without people having to ""give up their shirts"" for it. The flight sim community has given so much to me; it’s time to give back.

Today, I am not asking for money or trying to generate hype. I am not interested in generating business interest at this point, and I am not even certain I want to make money doing this. All I want is a career mode that dives deeper into the life of a pilot than ever before, so I can use it for myself. If you want to tag along for the ride, that is fine by me.

I have come up with a very ambitious list of features. Some might not even be possible, as I am still investigating the capabilities of the MSFS SDK, but rest assured, I will try my best.

**This is my pitch:**

>

*\*Name is subject to change.*

**Here is the brainstorming list of ideas I have had so far:**

here's the total brainstorming ideas I had so far.

**1. Global Simulation & Realism Toggles**

* **Simulation Difficulty Level:** \[Casual | Standard | Hardcore\] (Scales all tolerances).
* **State Persistence:** \[On | Off\] (Saves fuel, switches, and fluids between sessions).
* **Mechanical Failures:** \[On | Off\] (Enables randomized component wear and tear).
* **MEL (Minimum Equipment List) Enforcement:** \[On | Off\] (Prevents flight if critical systems are broken).
* **Real-Time Rest Timer:** \[On | Off\] (Enforces 10–12 hour waits between duty periods).
* **Fatigue Effects:** \[On | Off\] (Dimming screen/audio muffling when the pilot is tired).
* **WASM Deep Sync:** \[On | Off\] (Enables specific data reading for Fenix/PMDG aircraft).
* **Regional Governance:** \[FAA (USA) | EASA (Europe) | TC (Canada)\] (Sets units and laws).

# 2. Regulatory & Licensing Options

* **FTL (Flight Time Limitations) Enforcement:** \[On | Off\] (Enforces the 28-day/1,000-hour rolling limits).
* **Mandatory Written Exams:** \[On | Off\] (Requires passing the theoretical test before flying).
* **Checkride Telemetry Evaluation:** \[On | Off\] (Enables the Automated Flight Examiner).
* **Automatic Rating Expiration:** \[On | Off\] (Ratings expire if you don't fly the aircraft type for 90 days).
* **Exam ""Cooldown"" Timer:** \[On | Off\] (Forces a 24-hour wait after a failed exam).

# 3. Passenger (PAX) Path Options

*Features specific to flying people.*

* **Passenger Anxiety Monitoring:** \[On | Off\] (Grades G-force and bank angles).
* **Cabin Crew Interaction:** \[On | Off\] (Enables randomized FA requests/intercom calls).
* **Comfort Multiplier:** \[On | Off\] (Bonus pay for landing < 150 FPM).
* **Cabin Temperature Management:** \[On | Off\] (Requires manual L:Var adjustment of HVAC).

# 4. Cargo & Logistics Path Options

* **W&B (Weight & Balance) Audit:** \[On | Off\] (Manual loading/CG verification).
* **Engine Lockout (Overweight):** \[On | Off\] (Prevents engine start if CG is unsafe).
* **Circadian Low (WOCL) Penalty:** \[On | Off\] (Doubles fatigue during 02:00–05:00 flights).
* **Hazmat Certification:** \[Toggle\] (Unlocks high-paying dangerous goods missions).

# 5. Military Path Options

**GLOC Physiological Sim:** \[On | Off\] (Screen blackouts during high-G maneuvers).

* **Carrier Trap Grading:** \[On | Off\] (Enables the 1–4 wire detection and scoring).
* **Corridor Adherence Monitoring:** \[On | Off\] (Fails mission if you leave tactical airspace).
* **Rank-Based Mission Access:** \[On | Off\] (Locks advanced aircraft behind Prestige levels).

# 6. VIP / Corporate Path Options

* **Owner Temperament Engine:** \[On | Off\] (Randomizes client ""Pet Peeves"").
* **FBO (Private Terminal) Selection:** \[Manual | Auto\] (Choosing ground handling providers).
* **Pristine Status Requirement:** \[On | Off\] (Pay deductions for any airframe damage).
* **On-Call Randomization:** \[On | Off\] (Delays departure times randomly to test pilot patience).

# 7. External Integrations

* **VATSIM Pre-file Bridge:** \[On | Off\] (Automates flight plan submission).
* **SimBrief Dispatch Sync:** \[On | Off\] (Pulls OFP data directly into the app).

# 8. Achievement & Trophy Room Options

* **Certificate Generation:** \[Automatic | Manual\] (Creates the PNG/PDF license).
* **Achievement HUD Notifications:** \[On | Off\] (Popups when a badge is earned).

**Telemetry Graph Overlay:** \[On | Off\] (Includes flight path in the final certificate).

# Career progression breakdown

# 1. The Universal Foundation (Entry Level)

Every pilot starts here, regardless of their ultimate goal. You begin as an **Unlicensed Student** in a basic trainer (e.g., Cessna 172).

* **PPL (Private Pilot License):** Mastery of basic flight, VFR navigation, and local airspace.
   * *Requirement:* Pass the regional written exam and a ""Standard"" difficulty checkride.
* **IFR (Instrument Rating):** Unlocks the ability to fly in clouds and use advanced navigation.
   * *Requirement:* High-precision telemetry checkride (strict altitude/heading holds).

# 2. Specialized Career Branches

Once you earn your **CPL (Commercial Pilot License)**, the path splits into four distinct ""Lifestyles.""

# ✈️ Airline / Passenger Path

Progression is based on **Seniority** and **Service Quality**.

* **Junior First Officer:** Flying regional routes, focusing on SOPs and passenger comfort.
* **First Officer:** Transition to medium/heavy jets (737/A320).
* **Captain:** Requires 1,500+ SCE hours and a perfect ATPL checkride.
* **Training Captain:** The pinnacle; you ""grade"" other virtual pilots' checkrides.

# 📦 Cargo & Logistics Path

Progression is based on **Tonnage** and **Endurance**.

* **Feeder Pilot:** Small turboprops (C208) to remote airfields.
* **Heavy Hauler:** Long-haul transoceanic freight in wide-body jets (747F/777F).
* **Elite Logistics:** Unlocks ""Hazmat"" and ""High-Value"" cargo certificates with high financial rewards.

# 🎖️ Military Path

Progression is based on **Prestige** and **Mission Success**.

* **Flight Cadet / Ensign:** Basic jet training and formation flying.
* **Junior Officer:** Tactical missions, air-to-ground precision, and carrier traps.
* **Flight Lead / Commander:** Leading multi-aircraft sorties; high G-load tolerance required.
* **Ace:** A secret rank achieved through 100% mission perfection.

# 🥂 VIP / Corporate Path

Progression is based on **Reputation** and **Discretion**.

* **Charter Pilot:** Flying for small firms or private jet pools.
* **Corporate Captain:** Assigned to a specific ""Executive"" or ""Billionaire"" profile.
* **Fleet Manager:** Overseeing multiple private assets and managing FBO relations globally.

# 3. The ""Legacy"" Mechanics

As you advance, the application tracks your **Permanent Record**:

* **Checkride History:** All your telemetry graphs are saved in your **Trophy Room**.
* **License Portability:** If you move from the FAA (USA) to EASA (Europe), you must pass a ""Transition Exam"" to convert your hours.
* **Recurrent Training:** Every 6 months (real-time), you must pass a ""Line Check"" to keep your Captain status active.

A quick note: Yes, I used AI to help me summarize this list. I like to work smarter, not harder. These features are a sum of my ideas regarding what is lacking in most sim career add-ons.

**So, why am I posting this?**

I am looking for feedback. Obviously, I won't deliver every single item on this list on Day 1. What simulation aspects are most important to you? If you want to contribute and have Python/C++ knowledge, you are welcome to join me. The goal is to provide a true career mode to the community.

**The big question: Will I charge for this?**

The honest answer is: I don’t know. I might make it entirely free or charge a minimal fee (and I don't mean a ""two cups of coffee"" PMDG-style fee). I am still debating this, as paying customers demand customer service and have high expectations. With such a long feature list, this might just be commercial suicide!

I know this is a wall of text. You have probably seen many posts on this subreddit over the years promising the world, only to disappear into the black hole of dead add-ons. To be honest: that might happen. I am not immune to life events that could prevent me from working on this in the future. Who knows?

**What is the ETA?**

I am hoping to have a basic MVP (Minimum Viable Product) in a few months. It might be limited in function, but it will serve as a feedback loop to see if I am heading in the right direction. My GitHub repository is currently private while I work, but I may invite specific individuals who are interested in testing.

If you made it this far through this post—congratulations! You might just have the patience it takes to make it as a Captain.",5,1770521249.0,MicrosoftFlightSim,0,0.86,False

Yo! Well here’s a low-effort way to make thirty bucks.

Ubank is running a referral deal where we both get **$30** if you sign up and do the bare minimum. I’m sharing this here because I’ve used them for ages, and since we Reddit friends are all managing tight wallets, I figure we’re close enough to mates to share a sign-up bonus.

**The $30 rebate**

1. Grab the ubank app and use the code **9NXTQV1** when it asks about you during sign-up.
2. Tap your card (or phone) **5 times** within the first 30 days.
3. *The trick:* You don't need a massive deposit. Five small transactions—like buying five separate coffees or scanning five individual groceries—triggers the payout.

**The catch on their high interest (read this before you commit):** First, deposit interests rates have happily increased in February to a **4.6% interest rate** (5.35% for the first four months). Ubank has been great for me, but they changed the rules recently for how you get the high interest, and it’s a bit of a trap if you’re not paying attention. Here's how you get it:

* **Crucially,** you have to grow your savings balance by at least **$1** every month (and they don’t count the interest they pay you as ""growth"").
* If you treat your savings like a revolving door and it doesn’t go up by that gold coin, the interest rate drops off a cliff. It’s a hoop, so only go for it if you're the type to actually track that stuff.

**Why bother?** Aside from the free thirty, it’s a brand of NAB and has the **Government $250k guarantee**, so it’s a proper bank. There are no account fees, and it’s one of the few cards that doesn't charge you a ""convenience fee"" for using an ATM or buying stuff while you're overseas.

1qyy14r,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1qyy14r/httpssubstackcomthesolodad/,https://substack.com/@thesolodad,"I’m now into the fifth year of my separation, and one of the biggest challenges I’ve faced is learning the difference between being alone and feeling lonely—and navigating the tension between them.

It’s human nature to judge. We judge ourselves. We judge others. And whether we realize it or not, we’re constantly comparing our lives to everyone around us.

I read somewhere (can’t remember where) that people judge up and judge down—often without realizing it.

Let me explain. You see yourself, your life and your current circumstances a certain way. We all do. And then you interact with a vast range of other people in a variety of environments—at work, whilst shopping, walking down the street. You compare yourself to them using whatever metrics you value—wealth, beauty, body, intellect—take your pick. It’s then in our very nature to compare our current selves to our perception of them, and rate ourselves and current life conditions to their own. For example, you witness a homeless person sitting outside your local shopping centre begging for change. You may give them a few coins, or offer to buy them a bottle of water and then you walk on, ‘knowing’ that you’re better off than them, or maybe even that you’re simply better, because you have a job, a home, a car. Whatever.

Compare that with the experience of being at your local coffee shop. A Lambo pulls up out front. An immaculately dressed man exits, brushes himself down, adjusts his designer sunnies and strolls in to meet the most stunning female specimen you have ever seen sitting in a window booth, sunlight streaming through the window to illuminate her perfect smile. In this situation, you (well, me at least) instantly assume that this guy is loaded and has it all (whether he does or doesn’t is irrelevant in this example). You judge, and then compare your current life situation to your perception of his. We. All. Judge. We judge ourselves as well as those around us, based on a scale of our own unique creation.

It’s wired into us. We compare down: *I’m better than them because...* And we compare up: *They’re so much better than me because...* Both are a recipe for disaster, because we can never be or have enough. The trap of not enough is worthy of a post all on its own.

So let me get to the crux of my discussion. People judge. And for whatever reason, it’s in our DNA as humans to care about the opinions of others, which sucks! So, when people see that you live by yourself, have your children 50/50 and have no life partner, then they judge. They feel sorry for you, because you must be so lonely living in that house all by yourself for half of your life, presumably eating frozen meals, scrolling social media and dating apps (don’t get me started) whilst sitting in your jocks and feeling miserable. Because those people who are in a committed relationship are so much happier. Right?

This is an ongoing dilemma for me. Yes, at times I am alone. But am I lonely? It’s worth digging a little deeper and adding some context.

I’m extremely fortunate. I have a civil, working relationship with my ex. I have my kids 50% of the time in a fluid arrangement. We both work tirelessly to keep the children at the center of our decisions. I endeavor to foster a strong loving bond with my children and am truly blessed to have an amazing relationship with my parents and my sister. I’m surrounded by supportive friends and work colleagues and reside in a modest, yet comfortable house in the ‘burbs.

Half the time, I have my kids with me. As much as they drive me insane at times, I adore having them around and feel most whole when they are with me. The other half of the time, I live by myself with my 2 little dogs for company. Manly, I know! When the kids first go back to their mum’s, I love the sense of peace and freedom. Life doesn’t feel as frenetic. After a day or 2, I’m ready for them to come home. During these days, I make time to have a coffee with mum, catch up with friends, exercise, read. Whatever I want to!

It’s those occasions when I don’t have any human interaction; when my kids are not at home and I’m not doing anything meaningful with my time that I start to feel that nag of loneliness. But, let’s be honest, it’s all self-inflicted. Could I call my sister, or message a friend to hang out? Fuck yeah I could. Do I always? No. Because sometimes I just want to wallow. In self-pity and loathing. I want to bathe in all that negative self-talk. I’m useless. I don’t have a girlfriend. I’m eating dinner by myself. What a loser. What a stupid, bald, short, girlfriendless loser… Does this sound familiar to anyone? Fuck I hope it does. Then I’m not a fucking weirdo.

This usually occurs on a Sunday evening. On days where I haven’t exercised and eaten like a lazy, fat shit. Normally, I feel pretty bulletproof. But on those days (and they’re becoming more rare)—those days I feel like my thoughts are a runaway train heading for a brick wall. And I’m the crash test dummy in the front carriage. That’s when I feel lonely.

But am I? I don’t think so. Despite common sentiment about those of us that are choosing not to settle; that are choosing to live without a partner, I live a uniquely rich and rewarding life. It takes writing something like this; to try to articulate and verbalise my thoughts and feelings to truly identify the great joy that is my life.

I think about this quote by David Foster Wallace regularly:

*“There are these moments of utter stillness...when you get to wake up at whatever time you want, and you’re in your own bed, and you get to do what you want, and you think, Is this loneliness or is this freedom?”*

I choose to believe that this is freedom. That I’m unconstrained by the incorrect expectations of others. That we CAN be happy living alone. That it’s the choices we make to enrich our lives that determine what loneliness looks like. I enjoy my own company. I’ve worked immensely hard on myself over these 5 years, and (most of the time!) I’m proud of who looks back at me in the mirror. Do I strive to become more; to become a better version of myself each day? FUCK YEAH. However, sometimes it’s important to pause and see how far you’ve come.

Maybe today is that day.

‘Til next time

I used to have plans regularly with different friends and groups (with spouse) doing different things. Most the time I initiated the hangouts with friends. As of a few months ago, I have gotten off of social media entirely and it’s like everything has changed. I think I have hung out with friends 4 times in the last 6 months. And one of my friends treated me like trash. My spouse goes out regularly with friends and encourages me to do the same. I get a bit of a jealousy complex when they do because I’m not invited or don’t have any plans with any of my friends for the foreseeable future. 

My spouse makes friends just by looking at them. My sibling and their spouse have such a great friend group they are doing things with that group or certain friends of that group regularly and I get sad because I don’t have that and feel left out because I’m not invited. 

I went to a parent meet up and chatted with a parent and we swapped numbers. I texted the parent asking to get the kids together or go grab coffee and was ghosted. 

My spouse and I go out and do things frequently with either just the two of us or the kids too. I just feel like I have no friends and that gets lonely. 

I will text a few of my friends and just see what they are up to, sometimes vague responses or days go by without an answer. 

I just want a friend group or a friend who I could call randomly on a Saturday afternoon and meet for dinner that same day. Not wait a month to see the for an hour over dinner. ",1,1770520905.0,lonely,3,0.66,False
1qyxz2k,https://www.reddit.com/r/SingleDads/comments/1qyxz2k/is_this_loneliness_or_is_this_freedom/,Is This Loneliness or Is This Freedom?,"I’m now into the fifth year of my separation, and one of the biggest challenges I’ve faced is learning the difference between being alone and feeling lonely—and navigating the tension between them.

It’s human nature to judge. We judge ourselves. We judge others. And whether we realize it or not, we’re constantly comparing our lives to everyone around us.

I read somewhere (can’t remember where) that people judge up and judge down—often without realizing it.

Let me explain. You see yourself, your life and your current circumstances a certain way. We all do. And then you interact with a vast range of other people in a variety of environments—at work, whilst shopping, walking down the street. You compare yourself to them using whatever metrics you value—wealth, beauty, body, intellect—take your pick. It’s then in our very nature to compare our current selves to our perception of them, and rate ourselves and current life conditions to their own. For example, you witness a homeless person sitting outside your local shopping centre begging for change. You may give them a few coins, or offer to buy them a bottle of water and then you walk on, ‘knowing’ that you’re better off than them, or maybe even that you’re simply better, because you have a job, a home, a car. Whatever.

Compare that with the experience of being at your local coffee shop. A Lambo pulls up out front. An immaculately dressed man exits, brushes himself down, adjusts his designer sunnies and strolls in to meet the most stunning female specimen you have ever seen sitting in a window booth, sunlight streaming through the window to illuminate her perfect smile. In this situation, you (well, me at least) instantly assume that this guy is loaded and has it all (whether he does or doesn’t is irrelevant in this example). You judge, and then compare your current life situation to your perception of his. We. All. Judge. We judge ourselves as well as those around us, based on a scale of our own unique creation.

It’s wired into us. We compare down: *I’m better than them because...* And we compare up: *They’re so much better than me because...* Both are a recipe for disaster, because we can never be or have enough. The trap of not enough is worthy of a post all on its own.

So let me get to the crux of my discussion. People judge. And for whatever reason, it’s in our DNA as humans to care about the opinions of others, which sucks! So, when people see that you live by yourself, have your children 50/50 and have no life partner, then they judge. They feel sorry for you, because you must be so lonely living in that house all by yourself for half of your life, presumably eating frozen meals, scrolling social media and dating apps (don’t get me started) whilst sitting in your jocks and feeling miserable. Because those people who are in a committed relationship are so much happier. Right?

This is an ongoing dilemma for me. Yes, at times I am alone. But am I lonely? It’s worth digging a little deeper and adding some context.

I’m extremely fortunate. I have a civil, working relationship with my ex. I have my kids 50% of the time in a fluid arrangement. We both work tirelessly to keep the children at the center of our decisions. I endeavor to foster a strong loving bond with my children and am truly blessed to have an amazing relationship with my parents and my sister. I’m surrounded by supportive friends and work colleagues and reside in a modest, yet comfortable house in the ‘burbs.

Half the time, I have my kids with me. As much as they drive me insane at times, I adore having them around and feel most whole when they are with me. The other half of the time, I live by myself with my 2 little dogs for company. Manly, I know! When the kids first go back to their mum’s, I love the sense of peace and freedom. Life doesn’t feel as frenetic. After a day or 2, I’m ready for them to come home. During these days, I make time to have a coffee with mum, catch up with friends, exercise, read. Whatever I want to!

It’s those occasions when I don’t have any human interaction; when my kids are not at home and I’m not doing anything meaningful with my time that I start to feel that nag of loneliness. But, let’s be honest, it’s all self-inflicted. Could I call my sister, or message a friend to hang out? Fuck yeah I could. Do I always? No. Because sometimes I just want to wallow. In self-pity and loathing. I want to bathe in all that negative self-talk. I’m useless. I don’t have a girlfriend. I’m eating dinner by myself. What a loser. What a stupid, bald, short, girlfriendless loser… Does this sound familiar to anyone? Fuck I hope it does. Then I’m not a fucking weirdo.

This usually occurs on a Sunday evening. On days where I haven’t exercised and eaten like a lazy, fat shit. Normally, I feel pretty bulletproof. But on those days (and they’re becoming more rare)—those days I feel like my thoughts are a runaway train heading for a brick wall. And I’m the crash test dummy in the front carriage. That’s when I feel lonely.

But am I? I don’t think so. Despite common sentiment about those of us that are choosing not to settle; that are choosing to live without a partner, I live a uniquely rich and rewarding life. It takes writing something like this; to try to articulate and verbalise my thoughts and feelings to truly identify the great joy that is my life.

I think about this quote by David Foster Wallace regularly:

*“There are these moments of utter stillness...when you get to wake up at whatever time you want, and you’re in your own bed, and you get to do what you want, and you think, Is this loneliness or is this freedom?”*

I choose to believe that this is freedom. That I’m unconstrained by the incorrect expectations of others. That we CAN be happy living alone. That it’s the choices we make to enrich our lives that determine what loneliness looks like. I enjoy my own company. I’ve worked immensely hard on myself over these 5 years, and (most of the time!) I’m proud of who looks back at me in the mirror. Do I strive to become more; to become a better version of myself each day? FUCK YEAH. However, sometimes it’s important to pause and see how far you’ve come.

Maybe today is that day.

1qyxyj1,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1qyxyj1/rasputin/,Rasputin,"Just over six months ago, my mother died. The funeral was very beautiful; my mother's friends came from all over the country to bid her a final farewell. When the event was over, I returned home, a tenth-floor apartment she never got to see. As I entered, I saw the flowers I had bought months ago when the doctors said she was improving.

The following days were the same as always: I got up, had a quick breakfast, and ran to the subway. My office was in the farthest corner of the building, right next to the company's servers. I only spoke to someone when there was a computer issue; I confess I even inserted intentional errors at times. But I liked going to the office; I didn't want to be at home. Every day at home, I felt like Mom would walk in at any moment.

One ordinary day, returning home, I found the elevator out of order. I started climbing the ten floors and was grateful I wasn't carrying grocery bags. I heard a scream. At first, I ignored it, but the sound became clearer and more audible—it was a meow. I opened the door separating the stairs from the hallway. I saw a puddle of what appeared to be water. I walked slowly. After a robbery in one of the apartments, the last thing I wanted was to confront a criminal. The hallway lights turned on one by one as I advanced. When I was a few steps away, the last light came on: a dark red stain covered the tile and the welcome mat. It was blood.

I immediately ran down the stairs to the lobby and informed the only security guard on duty. He used a master key after getting permission from his boss over the phone. The scene was horrifying: a woman with a mutilated leg lay on the blood, which reached the door. But on top of the woman was a black kitten, just a few months old, meowing desperately.

The poor animal approached me and started purring while rubbing against my calves. I crouched down to pick it up, and it looked at me with a tenderness that melted my heart. I brought it close to my chest, and it rubbed against my neck while alternating purrs with meows of pleasure. The cold I felt in my body faded in the warmth of its greeting.

I took the cat up to my apartment; such a beautiful little creature had no reason to be in such a horrible place. A burly policeman knocked on my door around three in the morning. I told him everything that had happened.

""Did you know the woman?"" he asked, notebook in hand.  
""No, I don't know her. I don't even know her name.""  
""The security guard told me about the cat. Why do you have it?""  
""I didn't want to leave it there because of how traumatic the scene was.""

""I'll find out if I need to take the cat or if you can keep it.""

At that moment, the cat puffed up at the policeman and made that angry gesture cats have. The policeman tipped his cap and left. I tried to sleep, but the cat snuggled right on top of my face, making it hard to breathe. But it was so beautiful that I simply couldn't get angry with it. Its purring was music that filled the room with calm.

Early in the morning, as I prepared my breakfast, the cat played with the dead petals. It looked so cute that I took a picture. I gathered the flowers and took them to the trash. The day at the office was as long as any other, but I was particularly free of tasks, so I decided to leave a note on my desk with my phone number: ""If you need something urgent, call me."" I grabbed my things and left.

Right across from my office, there happened to be a pet store. When I entered, an older, gray-haired man with a mustache greeted me cheerfully.

""How can I help you?""  
""Thank you. Look, the thing is I have a kitten, a few months old, staying at my house for now. I'd like to know what the most important things I should have are.""  
""Of course,"" he said with a broad smile. ""The essentials are three things: a bed, a litter box, and, of course, food.""

Since I had many bags, I decided to take a taxi. I kept thinking about everything I was missing: a scratching post, a carrier. And I was missing something extremely important: a collar with a tag for its name. What would I call it?

Normally, I stay silent during taxi rides, but the driver, seeing me so loaded, said:  
""Getting a new pet, huh? A cat?""  
""Yes, sir. It's a kitten I found...""—I couldn't describe the scene without a shiver—""Well, I found it on the street.""  
""Cats are like that; they adopt you. What's its name?""  
""Honestly, I haven't thought about it.""  
""You could call it Rasputin. It's a name my grandmother always used for her cats. Usually for black ones.""

We chatted a bit more, and I quickly arrived home. When I entered the building, the same security guard from the day of the horrible scene was there.  
""Hey, have you heard anything about the case? Do they know who did it?""  
""Nothing yet. The police have come several times and taken evidence, but it seems they don't have any suspects yet.""

As I reached my floor, I could hear the meows from the hallway. That sound filled my chest with warmth—someone was waiting for me at home. I opened the apartment door, and the cat rushed at me, purring desperately. I dropped my things to hug it, feeling an intoxicating happiness.

""Rasputin,"" I said.

Immediately, it looked at me as if recognizing an old friend, but quickly changed its expression back to the usual tender kitten. I felt a shiver.

""Well, it seems that's your name. You must be starving, so I'll serve you some food.""

I served the food and placed it on the dining table. It approached curiously, sniffed the food, and walked away indifferently. I tried to convince it to eat, but it got annoyed and ran off. It was my mistake; I bought the wrong food. It would be good to know what its previous owner fed it.

I ate a sandwich and went to bed, calling Rasputin to join me, but it didn't even look at me. It was outside, staring out the window indifferently. It felt like a blow to my chest, but I tried to sleep. At this hour, I wouldn't find the right food.

When I woke up, I smelled something horrible, like rotting meat, and realized I hadn't cleaned the litter box. I looked for a bag in the kitchen and went to the litter box. There was a huge mound covered in litter. This is too much for such a small cat. I wrapped it in the bag and took it to the outside trash.

That morning, I walked several streets looking for kitten food. It turns out there are too many brands. I bought six small bags of food—two of the most expensive, two mid-range, and two economical ones. I also bought several canned foods, about four. I wanted to do a massive test; one of them had to appeal to it. I quickly returned home and put the food in small plastic cups I had bought for this purpose. Rasputin approached and sniffed each container but ignored them all. It didn't try any of them and went to my bed. No food interested it.

The next day, I decided to go to the butcher for something different. I bought pork, chicken, beef, rabbit, and fish. I even bought a cut of venison the butcher offered me. I got home and tried the same thing, offering all the foods, but nothing worked.

""What do you want? Nothing I give you pleases you. I don't know what to feed you.""

The cat climbed onto my legs and started nibbling at my leg.  
""You want to eat me? Haha, is that what you want?"" I put it down, and it walked away.

The next day, I went to work and stopped by the pet store. The gentleman recommended taking it to the vet because it might be an illness. I got home and, seeing it sleeping on the sofa, said:  
""If you don't eat anything today, Rasputin, we'll have to go to the vet.""

The cat puffed up in anger, like it did with the policeman, and made the hissing sound cats make when they're angry.  
""What a temper.""

I started cutting vegetables for my dinner, but just as I was cutting the onion, the kitten ran toward me and pushed me. It was very gentle but enough for the knife to slip and cut my hand. At that moment, I was annoyed that the vegetables were getting stained with blood, so I tried to wash them immediately. But the cat jumped onto the kitchen table, approached me, and licked my finger. How sweet, it's worried about me, I thought, and petted it. The cat purred again, and I felt the same happiness that had overwhelmed me on the first day.

""Well, you're eating something, haha.""

When I got to the bedroom, I disinfected the wound with alcohol because, after all, it was a cat, and the wound could get infected. We slept curled up together, and I felt accompanied, warm, and happy.

The next day, I kept thinking about what had happened and thought that maybe what the kitten wanted was fresh prey. I understand some cats are hunters and prefer only fresh food. A somewhat far-fetched but possible idea occurred to me: I could bring a little mouse for the kitten to eat, a hamster, or even a small bird. I decided to do it and went out in search.

When I got home, I showed it the animal, and the cat sniffed it and then walked away indifferently. I closed the box and tried to think of how to get Rasputin's attention. I tried placing it nearby. I tried closing the room and making the mouse run, but nothing worked.

Things didn't seem to be improving. My poor animal was already skin and bones, all because of me. I'm useless; I can't even take care of a pet. I was in the kitchen again, trying to prepare something to eat, and remembered the scene with the knife cut. I felt dizzy, as if intoxicated by mysterious music. I placed my index finger right on the tip and, almost without thinking, pricked it. At first, my finger seemed intact, but just after, a red drop began to form on my finger. I looked for Rasputin's plate and let about seven drops of blood fall onto it.

At that instant, Rasputin jumped onto the plate and licked it as if it were a delicacy. Then it looked for my finger and licked it. The cat purred, curled up on my legs, and climbed onto me. It was a happy animal again. I felt that I was also happy, and the pain in my finger disappeared because of the great love I was receiving from the beautiful Rasputin.

Over the following days, I kept thinking about the matter. It's possible to feed it with my blood, but it could be risky. I decided to clear up some doubts with the pharmacist, without explaining the reason. He looked at me with some strangeness, but ""it's not the strangest thing I've been asked."" He gave me a syringe and some safety measures; I also had to disinfect everything.

I got home, sat on the sofa, took out all the instruments, and stared at them. What am I doing with my life? I thought. But Rasputin climbed onto my legs and started purring and kneading. As if intoxicated, I drew a syringe full of blood and served it on the plate. At that moment, Rasputin began licking the plate with incredible happiness. I tried to touch it, but it reacted with anger. I understand, I understand, what a temper. After drinking the blood, it purred a bit, rubbed against me, but then walked away.

This act slowly became routine: I would draw a little blood, give it to him, he would eat, and I would go on with my day. I had to invest in supplements and more food because I was losing energy; there were days I felt dizzy. But Rasputin's love made it all worth it. After a couple of weeks, everything was beautiful: he was happy, I was happy, and everything was going wonderfully. But when I arrived at the building, the police were there, indicating they had to search the entire building for information about the crime.

They asked to inspect my apartment, and upon seeing Rasputin, who was now chubby, I said, ""Look, this is my 'senior feline.'"" The policeman saw the syringes in the kitchen and asked me about them. I became a bundle of nerves and said the first thing that came to mind.

""That's because, because, that's because, that's because I have blood sugar issues.""  
""For drawing blood for glucose, you use little drops.""  
""Yes, what happens is that... what happens is that my device doesn't work well, so I have to use more blood.""  
""I see,"" said the policeman, looking at me over his dark glasses.  
""No, no, I have it put away, and why bother? Besides, you have a murderer to find, right?""  
""Yes, we have to find him.""

The policeman left, and I quickly went to the kitchen to get the syringe. I was an hour late with Rasputin's meal. I drew almost double the amount of blood as the first time and felt dizzy, but this time, Rasputin responded with the same cold indifference as the first time. It destroyed me. I kept thinking about it; I didn't know what to do. I tried drawing more, but the animal didn't respond.

In the desperation of not knowing how to respond and because of Rasputin's coldness, I searched the kitchen for the sharpest knife. I tried to find the meatiest part of my leg and sliced it in one go. It was only a few centimeters of flesh, but my beautiful Rasputin responded with great happiness and devoured it eagerly.

Three weeks passed, and I had to carefully cut, disinfect, and seal the edges to avoid bleeding out. It's meticulous, watchmaker's work: a balance. Rasputin was radiant; his black fur shone like tar under the dining room light, and his purrs were deep, satisfied—the engine of my world. When he looked at the fresh bandage, his golden eyes dilated with an interest that made me smile.

But one night, Rasputin's hunger was unbearable. His meows were no longer complaints but a low, guttural growl that didn't come from a small animal. When I turned on the light, his shadow on the wall wasn't that of a kitten but of a hunched creature with a hump and disproportionately long limbs. His eyes, fixed on me, glowed with an ancient, hungry intelligence. ""More,"" whispered a voice that wasn't a meow but a raspy sound from his throat.

It was then that I knew I wasn't feeding a pet but a parasite that had taken the most convenient form to trap me. Before I could react, Rasputin jumped from the table. Not with a cat's agility but with the disjointed, swift movement of an insect. His legs, now long and thin like black rods, pinned me to the floor. I felt his breath, which smelled of old blood and cemetery earth, on my face. ""The thigh now,"" whispered that raspy voice as one of his claws, cold as metal, rested on the bandage on my leg.

I couldn't believe it. My beautiful cat was actually a monster. It can't be. It must be a lie. But it lunged at me and licked my neck. I felt it would bite me that instant, but I found the knife nearby and stabbed it in the side of the horrible creature. The entity let out a whimper of pain and jumped away. At that moment, it tried to transform back into a cat and made suffering eyes at me, seeking my remorse. But the transformation failed; it flickered like an old television between the horrible image of the monster and that of the beautiful kitten.

I felt as if my life had been destroyed. The only beautiful thing was actually a monster. It can't be. This monster must have eaten my beautiful Rasputin. Or it's simply imitating him; it saw that I loved my cat and took his form to deceive me. I ran down the stairs as fast as I could, my eyes full of tears, stumbling because of the damage I had done to my leg.

I'm writing this from a cold interrogation room at the police station. The smell of stale coffee and disinfectant can't cover the sweetish stench of my own infected flesh. The paramedics arrived at the building and found me on the stairs, losing blood, with the knife still in my hand. They say I was screaming something about a hunched shadow. The police searched the entire apartment; they didn't find Rasputin.

They don't believe what I tell them. I show them the bandages on my legs, I tell them about the raspy voice and the elongated shadow on the wall. They nod with compassion, writing ""delirium"" in their report. The burly policeman entered, and his colleagues informed him of the situation. He made a very restrained celebratory gesture. I hope they lock me up. I don't want to go back home.",1,1770520780.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Life doesn’t feel as frenetic. After a day or 2, I’m ready for them to come home. During these days, I make time to have a coffee with mum, catch up with friends, exercise, read. Whatever I want to!

It’s those occasions when I don’t have any human interaction; when my kids are not at home and I’m not doing anything meaningful with my time that I start to feel that nag of loneliness. But, let’s be honest, it’s all self-inflicted. Could I call my sister, or message a friend to hang out? Fuck yeah I could. Do I always? No. Because sometimes I just want to wallow. In self-pity and loathing. I want to bathe in all that negative self-talk. I’m useless. I don’t have a girlfriend. I’m eating dinner by myself. What a loser. What a stupid, bald, short, girlfriendless loser… Does this sound familiar to anyone? Fuck I hope it does. Then I’m not a fucking weirdo.

This usually occurs on a Sunday evening. On days where I haven’t exercised and eaten like a lazy, fat shit. Normally, I feel pretty bulletproof. But on those days (and they’re becoming more rare)—those days I feel like my thoughts are a runaway train heading for a brick wall. And I’m the crash test dummy in the front carriage. That’s when I feel lonely.

But am I? I don’t think so. Despite common sentiment about those of us that are choosing not to settle; that are choosing to live without a partner, I live a uniquely rich and rewarding life. It takes writing something like this; to try to articulate and verbalise my thoughts and feelings to truly identify the great joy that is my life.

I think about this quote by David Foster Wallace regularly:

*“There are these moments of utter stillness...when you get to wake up at whatever time you want, and you’re in your own bed, and you get to do what you want, and you think, Is this loneliness or is this freedom?”*

I choose to believe that this is freedom. That I’m unconstrained by the incorrect expectations of others. That we CAN be happy living alone. That it’s the choices we make to enrich our lives that determine what loneliness looks like. I enjoy my own company. I’ve worked immensely hard on myself over these 5 years, and (most of the time!) I’m proud of who looks back at me in the mirror. Do I strive to become more; to become a better version of myself each day? FUCK YEAH. However, sometimes it’s important to pause and see how far you’ve come.

Maybe today is that day.

1qyxxn1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1qyxxn1/is_this_loneliness_or_is_this_freedom/,Is This Loneliness or Is This Freedom?,"I’m now into the fifth year of my separation, and one of the biggest challenges I’ve faced is learning the difference between being alone and feeling lonely—and navigating the tension between them.

It’s human nature to judge. We judge ourselves. We judge others. And whether we realize it or not, we’re constantly comparing our lives to everyone around us.

I read somewhere (can’t remember where) that people judge up and judge down—often without realizing it.

Let me explain. You see yourself, your life and your current circumstances a certain way. We all do. And then you interact with a vast range of other people in a variety of environments—at work, whilst shopping, walking down the street. You compare yourself to them using whatever metrics you value—wealth, beauty, body, intellect—take your pick. It’s then in our very nature to compare our current selves to our perception of them, and rate ourselves and current life conditions to their own. For example, you witness a homeless person sitting outside your local shopping centre begging for change. You may give them a few coins, or offer to buy them a bottle of water and then you walk on, ‘knowing’ that you’re better off than them, or maybe even that you’re simply better, because you have a job, a home, a car. Whatever.

Compare that with the experience of being at your local coffee shop. A Lambo pulls up out front. An immaculately dressed man exits, brushes himself down, adjusts his designer sunnies and strolls in to meet the most stunning female specimen you have ever seen sitting in a window booth, sunlight streaming through the window to illuminate her perfect smile. In this situation, you (well, me at least) instantly assume that this guy is loaded and has it all (whether he does or doesn’t is irrelevant in this example). You judge, and then compare your current life situation to your perception of his. We. All. Judge. We judge ourselves as well as those around us, based on a scale of our own unique creation.

It’s wired into us. We compare down: *I’m better than them because...* And we compare up: *They’re so much better than me because...* Both are a recipe for disaster, because we can never be or have enough. The trap of not enough is worthy of a post all on its own.

So let me get to the crux of my discussion. People judge. And for whatever reason, it’s in our DNA as humans to care about the opinions of others, which sucks! So, when people see that you live by yourself, have your children 50/50 and have no life partner, then they judge. They feel sorry for you, because you must be so lonely living in that house all by yourself for half of your life, presumably eating frozen meals, scrolling social media and dating apps (don’t get me started) whilst sitting in your jocks and feeling miserable. Because those people who are in a committed relationship are so much happier. Right?

This is an ongoing dilemma for me. Yes, at times I am alone. But am I lonely? It’s worth digging a little deeper and adding some context.

I’m extremely fortunate. I have a civil, working relationship with my ex. I have my kids 50% of the time in a fluid arrangement. We both work tirelessly to keep the children at the center of our decisions. I endeavor to foster a strong loving bond with my children and am truly blessed to have an amazing relationship with my parents and my sister. I’m surrounded by supportive friends and work colleagues and reside in a modest, yet comfortable house in the ‘burbs.

Half the time, I have my kids with me. As much as they drive me insane at times, I adore having them around and feel most whole when they are with me. The other half of the time, I live by myself with my 2 little dogs for company. Manly, I know! When the kids first go back to their mum’s, I love the sense of peace and freedom.

I've been struggling to find anything in my industry and have just been working as a landscaper and in a gear shop since. Although I've had time to ski and go on road trips, life feels like it's been passing me by.

I'm in a pretty bad housing situation (windowless room). I'm aware this is not legal. The place is really nice otherwise and very cheap. I've been trying my best to stay in the city so that I can get a job, since most companies are doing RTO, but realistically I'm not getting anything. At this point I am considering giving it all up to travel.

Despite not having a significant income, I consider myself to be in a very privileged situation. I grew up with money being extremely tight. My dad grew up very poor and has a scarcity mindset, though my parents are quite stable financially. He does however have a degree and math and an MBA, so despite the traumas of being poor when he was young, he has set our family up well. He is now in his 70s and wants to give me and my sister the life we didn't have growing up.

I have the same stresses about money, so even when I was paid decently, I've been saving and investing relentlessly. I've studied investing intensely. I have no debt and about $260,000CAD saved, with 72% being stock market returns. My parents are willing to contribute $300,000-400,000 to my first home. My aunt and uncle are willing to contribute $50,000, possibly more because they have no kids. My dad has offered to cover my rent while money (or at least income) is tight, as he knows I've genuinely been working very hard to get a job and pick up as many hours as I can. 

My thoughts are to go to Europe for a few months, maybe work here and there in a coffee shop, on a farm, or in a hostel. The main goal would be enjoying the last of my 20s. My aunt has offered to let me leave my things at her house, including my car, allowing me to take it off insurance. 

When I return, assuming I still have not found a job, I am thinking about getting a sprinter van (hopefully something with enough space for a bed and desk) and keep it in the $20,000-30,000 range if possible. I would then ideally drive through the states to Utah, Arizona, California, even down to Central America if I made it that far. If all else fails, my sister owns a house in Oregon where I could stay in her spare room. I've built a pretty good relationship with a landscaping company where she lives, so I could easily do that for $20-25USD/hour.

This is not like me to make decisions like this. I have always been extremely conservative with my savings and have never given up an apartment without another one lined up or made a purchase this large.

But I struggle with thinking that I’m being scrutinized by straight sized people for everything I do, so it’s hard to break free from that sinking feeling. I sometimes feel like I have to make the healthy choice for food/drinks or the cashier will judge me. It’s just so hard when you’re surrounded by people that don’t look like you.

We always had similar values. She was the person who introduced me to some new points of view including feminism and the whole women supporting women ideology.

She used to be very independent and enjoyed spending time with her friends, but had never actually been in a romantic relationship. We were always meeting up for coffee and playing videogames together.

In general, videogaming used to be a pretty big common hobby for us. Sometimes she was also playing by herself. One of those days, around 1 year ago, she met a guy (25M) online. At the beginning it wasn't anything concerning, though it was clear she had a crush on him. She was saying that she knows he has a girlfriend so there is no chance of anything happening between them. Also he lives in another country (but not very far).

As the time passed she was spending more and more time with the guy (mostly playing together and chatting in Discord). Eventually she told me that she confessed her feelings to him. At this point I was still totally fine with it, I mean, you gotta shoot your shot right? He did not reciprocate her feelings and stated that he wants to be just friends. I was sure that after that their communication will fade away, since they want different things. But they kept talking and playing almost every day. At this point me and my friend completely stopped playing together, because she only wanted to play with him. I was pretty sad about it, but I thought: ""it's just a phase, every girl was weirdly obsessed with some guy at least once in her life"". We were still sometimes meeting up for coffee and casual chatting though. She was openly talking about flirting with the guy and at this point I was criticising her a little. Since the guy has a girlfriend and stated that he wants to be just friends I expressed my concern to her and also warned her that she might end up in a situation where she will be deeply hurt. To that she agreed, but also said that right now it's a great distraction for her and finally something that makes her feel less depressed (to be fair she did have a pretty tough life and struggled with depression for some time).

It didn't sit right with me but I decided that I want to be a good friend and support her. Which turned out to be harder that I expected... I kept wondering: what is the POV of his girlfriend? Does she know that he is playing and chatting with another girl who has a crush on him? I had this theory that maybe he is in an unhappy relationship that is already falling apart by itself, and my friend is just speeding up this process (coping lvl 100 i know). But the guy and his gf live together and my friend was overhearing some of their conversation (the guy forgot to mute his mic). She said they sounded all lovey-dovey with each other and it seemed like everything was great between them.

So almost every time we talked about her situation with the guy I kept asking questions about his girlfriend and voicing my condemnation of her advances towards the guy. She was agreeing with me but at the same time didn't change anything. I guess because of my open condemnation she grew more distant and stopped sharing so many details with me (she was way more comfortable sharing with our other friend who was not so judgy towards her).

Recently she traveled to meet him (in a different city in his country). She said it was nice, she felt very comfortable with him and after that they had a conversation about their situation and how she feels like he should tell his gf about them. Of course he refused and said that his gf will never accept it. Since then they've met one more time and continue talking and playing and basically acting like they are in a normal long-distance relationship. 

My friend openly admits that at this point she is basically a mistress and that she feels bad for the guy's girlfriend, but it doesn't make it any better for me. I hate to find myself being repulsed by my friend and her actions. I don't know if I am being selfish and the thing that actually upsets me most is the fact that she doesn't spend so much time with me anymore? Or is it that  whatever she is doing does not align with my morals? As i said I was voicing my concern to her many times but because of that we only grew apart.

I am not sure what to do here, like, is this the end of our friendship? Is it a phase that will just pass? Maybe someone here was facing something similar.

I'm bringing this post over from r/relationshipadvice to try and get more of a christian perspective.

I'd like to start by saying we have, no exaggeration, what I would say is a 99% ideal relationship at the moment outside of these spells we have a few times a year. We both love one another very much and have almost identical tastes, interests, beliefs and very similar upbringings in terms of values we were taught. We very rarely fight, maybe once every 3-4 months. I think this has the effect of making it where every fight we do have feels like a HUGE deal because it throws off this pretty much perfect sync we have otherwise. We both really care for one another and are attentive to one-another's needs, so our fights generally aren't over a slight, or one of us doing something ""wrong"" necessarily.

The fights almost always stem from a misunderstanding or me expressing an opinion that she takes the wrong way or doesn't like, or other small things. The dynamic is always exactly the same in that she is the one upset at me literally every time. For me, I can't really understand getting upset over a misunderstanding (at least not staying upset after you've talked it out and established that it was a misunderstanding), and when she messes something up or is careless or whatever I usually just remind myself that she loves me and didn't do it on purpose and so I don't really get upset for more than a couple hours.

Anyways, when we have an argument over a misunderstanding or one of my comments, I always apologize but then I usually try to work through the issue together if I feels like I didn't actually do something wrong. I'm this ultra-logical kind of engineer brain character and one of the things that does make me mad pretty quickly is when I'm being unfairly accused or blamed for something I didn't do or am not 100% responsible for. Well trying to frame the catalyst event accurately makes things worse, but I don't want to set the precedent that she can become upset over literally anything and that I will just apologize and accept the blame every time. It would be different if I was being harsh or careless or unthoughtful or lazy or abusive or any of the other actual bad things I see going down to some degree in so many of the relationships around us, and therefore I was giving her an actual reason to be upset at me. But no, it has to be over the kind of stuff that I can't grasp being mad about in the slightest.

We always talk stuff out, but for her it seems like no matter what I say there will still be an issue unless I basically apologize profusely and beg forgiveness. Again, I don't want to set the precedent going into marriage that her feelings get to control my behavior cause I'll just always fold to keep the peace, so I stop short at the apology and talking it out. After the argument, at some point we'll usually go to bed or part ways for the rest of the day, then when she comes home from work the next day she'll be super distant. It'll be really subtle at first but she'll kind of go more and more out of her way to make it clear she's upset. For me it's like we talked it out, I apologized even if I didn't do something bad, and it's the next day, so I can't fathom still being bothered. So I just avoid addressing it head on again because it usually just becomes the same discussion we had the day prior if we engage on the topic again. As I avoid the issue she'll go more and more out of her way to be distant, to the point that she'll eventually go and sleep in the basement for sometimes multiple days and it becomes this standoff where I'm refusing to beg forgiveness and she seems determined to punish me unless I do. She'll never come to me and say she wants to talk about the issue more and instead sees it as my responsibility to notice she's upset, come to her, and presumably apologize more or something.

To me, that's manipulation clear as day, and I refuse to submit to that. To be clear, my parents argued a lot when I was growing up, so I'm used to the idea of conflict in a relationship. I haven't really had a serious LT relationship before this, but in all my friendships I've addressed issues head on and if we can't come to an agreement we're just salty for a day or two and then it's like nothing happened. If someone seriously did something wrong and won't apologize then I can stay mad at someone like anyone else, but I just don't understand carrying anger over small things for days on end just because the other person didn't do exactly what I wanted them to to resolve it. It makes me very concerned that we can go from perfect peace for so long to physically separated at her behest over something I personally couldn't get mad at her for.

I'll give an example of our most famous incident because it's both the most minor thing we've disputed over and the most illustrative of our repeat dynamic, this is the ""coffee incident."" We were out with another couple one time in this nice little town after an excursion trying to decide what to do before we went home. When we got to the town we were making plans and my fiancé mentioned she wanted to get coffee. As a group we decided to go to this little pastry shop and walk around - turns out that shop didn't have coffee. Then we leave and on the way home, drop the other couple off. Then I don't really notice she's being quiet until we get home. I ask what's going on and turns out she's deeply offended that I didn't make sure she got a coffee before we left the little town. In the heat of socializing, I had completely forgotten she said that. I apologized and explain I just had forgotten. Then I said I just wished she had reminded me before we left or said something on the way home because it would have been a super easy fix. Seems like a minor issue but this was like a 2-3 day ordeal before she was over it, complete with her sleeping one night in the guest bedroom.

All of our incidents are exactly like this, and it's almost embarrassing for me to post about this because I see many people here and know plenty personally that have real, serious issues. To me, we don't have any real problems and those we do have are not worth having multiple bad days over. To her, she sees these issues as an indication of how our long-term conflict resolution will play out, and so she makes a huge deal about these little things on principle. I see it the same way and won't fully concede when I'm not at fault on principle. It makes me vindictive and want to reflect back the same the ungraciousness when she makes a similar minor misstep, but that would be bad.

We did go to around 10 therapy sessions with a ""christian"" counselor but it was such a joke. The guy keyed on my traditional values 4 sessions in and then we had an adversarial dynamic the rest of the time, and he admitted as much in our last session.

I was unemployed, in a depressingly dark and tiny room, overweight and lived a sedentary lifestyle with no friends or family near me. 

For the first month, some days all I did was lay in bed and rot, barely eating or drinking. Some days, the most I could do is push myself to go outside, sit in a café and enjoy a cup of coffee. That was my biggest win. Anxiety and depression were taking over me like never before. Sleep disrupted with panic attacks.

I'm writing this to share that it gets better. Life is constantly changing. You won't be stuck in the same misery forever. I just crossed month two and the anxiety attacks have greatly reduced. I'm a lot more functional now. All the little decisions I made compounded and improved me over time. All those short walks to the café turned into longer walks to the park, to a meetup, to the beach and now to work or gym or hang out with friends. Online therapy has been helpful too. 

The biggest difference came after going no contact, as much as I didn't want to because I was so in love and didn't want to let go. It hurts less than texting, in a way it's easier to do nothing than to wonder how or what to say. I gradually reduced contact and that worked for me but eventually you have to pull the plug.

I'm still not entirely over it, I wouldn't still be here if I was. I still think about her all the time. I'm still sad. I'm still hurting. And some days, I'm still just surviving, but there have been days since that I actually feel alive and that is such a huge win. ",1,1770519281.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

1qyxcvv,https://www.reddit.com/r/trailmakers/comments/1qyxcvv/new_engine_block_idea_sterling_engines_trade/,New Engine Block Idea: Sterling Engines! -- Trade space and weight for cheap energy,"TL/DR: Basically, a 0-power core engine. Hear me out.

Look at this cool desktop toy:

https://preview.redd.it/2rh2902zo5ig1.jpg?width=568&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=34f6707b9471f4ded0913f64336e5997fcbaafdd

**Any** external heat source applied to the engine's self-contained gas system can be converted to mechanical energy. (Solar/geothermal, engine exhaust, carbon fuel combustion, hot coffee...) Or a cold source! An ice cube could also provide the necessary temperature differential with the ambient environment. They're surprisingly efficient. They are very cool and fun.

Basically, internal gas gets heated then cooled to drive a change in pressure, driving piston motion through gas expansion and contraction.

[brrrrrr](https://i.redd.it/5ybi4vg1p6ig1.gif)

You may be familiar with the sterling engine's close cousin:

[The drinking bird is a phase-change heat engine: cooling triggers condensation, redistributing liquid and shifting weight. A Stirling engine is a pressure heat engine: heating and cooling directly drive gas expansion and contraction. The toy is analogous to an ice cube \\""powered\\"" sterling engine. ](https://preview.redd.it/0jspm02zo5ig1.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b767e90ab8d8396ba17baa0cb69c9a329a99c707)

**But what are they good for?**

**Pros:**

* *Very Efficient!* (Theoretically 66%, practically 40% at best. Compare that to the avg car engine's th35% / pr20%)
* Quiet. (External combustion, Used in stealth submarines)
* Simple and reliable (compared to internal combustion engines). Power generating mechanism is self contained, and has no intake or exhaust. No need to worry about debris entering engine.

**Cons:**

* High efficiency means low power. Needs quite a few gear ratios to have viable torque.
* Prefers constant RPM (doesn't bear variable load well). Bad acceleration.
* *Big and heavy.* Very bad power to size & weight ratio. Terrible for small and fast vehicles!
* Difficult to scale massively (gas/steam turbines make more sense at industrial scales)

**Real World Applications:**

* generators on stationary structures.
* boats / naval craft generators and propulsion.
* generators in space

**So what role could they have in-game?**:

*It would be a low energy cost, medium-low power, big and heavy, ship engine.*

* Basically a *0-power core* 4x4x8 hulking piece of metal.
* Trade space and weight for cheap energy. Ideal for larger ships in space or at sea, but ridiculous land crawlers aren't impossible.
* More power core slots can be allocated to firepower.

It'd basically be the opposite of the dragon-series engines, which are high energy cost, but very high power for their size and weight.

**V-4 Sterling Engine:**

C'mon, how cool is that? This would be perfect for a steampunk themed DLC.

She came back! I know 90% of you said to never let her back in the house, so you are probably going to judge me heavily. In my defense I was a little flustered by the whole thing.

She waved me down again when we were walking up to the house. She said to wait because she had something for me. I waited because... I guess because I'm stupid? I figured she would just knock on the door anyway if I didn't.

She came back with a pie that she said was thanks for using my washing machine. I said thank you and she didn't have to. She said ""let's go inside and try a piece."" I said it was almost my son's naptime. She said ""great! We can eat pie while he naps!""

A lot of you said she might have been interested in me, and that was still in my head. So I said ""yeah, and you should invite your husband over too."" I was expecting that to deter her. Nope!

She got very excited! She said ""that's a great idea! Here, you take the pie in and I'll go get him."" So at that point I'm internally thinking ""what the fu...."" My son and I went inside. I started cutting pieces of pie because at this point I felt like a victim of fate.

She came over with her husband. I have never seen a man that looked as exasperated and embarrassed as this guy. We ate pie, and the whole time she asked me weird questions while her husband looked annoyed. Every once in a while I would say something and she would give her husband a look. He kept pretending not to see the looks.

After we finished the pie, she asked if I had coffee. Her husband said ""Honey, he wants to put his son down for a nap. Let's go home.""

She said ""oh he doesn't mind.""

Her husband said ""he minds"" while he took her elbow and started leading her out the door. She kept insisting that I didn't until they were outside. I gotta say, I think I'm in love with this guy.

As weird and annoying as the whole thing was, I feel a lot better about my neighbor now. Some of the comments had some pretty crazy speculation that made me a little nervous. Now that I've met her husband I'm pretty sure she's just bored. Which is fine. It's annoying, but not creepy.

I am NOT light skin like Zendaya, I am like ZaZa Beats.) I work in finance and come from a very humble background. I graduated from high school and immediately got to interning and working, eventually dropping out of college. I’ve traveled the world and have friends from all different backgrounds. I worked for everything I have in life and am fighting to be successful in order to help the less fortunate and give back. 

About him: He is a Chinese immigrant that came here at 18 for a bachelor degree and masters degree to be fully paid for by his upper middle class family back home. They bought him a luxury vehicle, fully paid off, two years ago. He is very money centered, only wears certain luxury brands, only associates with wealthy people who he deems as being on his level and wants to get very rich together in the future. He is not willing to travel to “poor” places or even engage in conversation with them because he doesn’t see anything to gain there. He’s working as a teacher now due to visa constraints but wants to be a software developer after we get the green card process completed and he won’t require visa sponsorship from work. 

Our relationship: Last year, around this time I was doing extremely well in life. I just started making six-figures (with 2 jobs), was single minded, going to brunch every weekend, had a ton of friends and traveled every couple of months to somewhere new. I started a great job and was being flown to another city every couple of months for business purposes. Over the summer, I was on one of these trips when I opened a dating app, saw his profile and we met up for coffee. I liked him but didn’t feel a spark and left to travel for a couple of months, still keeping in contact with him over text. I was in between vacations and drunkenly asked if he wanted to spend a week together before my next one. So in September, I flew to his city, stayed for a week and he asked me to be in a relationship with him on one of the final days. I said yes and left for a month and a half to a different country and we were long distance at that time.  When I returned home, he flew me to him at the beginning of November and I moved in. Marriage talk started late November and he bought me an engagement ring for Christmas. In January, he met my aunt, parents and some family. He was an ANGEL during this entire time. I lost my job in October and he supported me financially until this month when I got a new job. He was cuddly, kind, caring, loving and so sweet. I never saw a bad side of him. So we scheduled an express marriage ceremony at the courthouse in my home city with my best friend of 10 years and her husband. He booked the trip and was excited. 

The marriage and n-word controversy: A week before we were set to be married legally to start the green card process in order to get him a higher paying job and us a better life, he showed me his angry side for the first time. I was sleeping and prefer it cold but I made the room too cold and he didn’t like that. He started banging his phone on the bed beside him, cursing and crying out that it was too f\\\*cking cold. He crashed out on me and I was super scared. It was the day before I started my new job and I got two hours of sleep. He said he was miserable and it was my fault. The week before our wedding, he argued every night and I got almost no sleep. He had me up every night. I get paid weekly at my job and got paid that Friday and we left to my city on Saturday. We check into an expensive hotel and my birthday is the next day. On my birthday and the day before our marriage, he spent the entire day alone at Universal Studios. I hung out with my best friends of ten years (married black couple). My best friends husband let me know that he didn’t have any money due to multiple trips being taken in that month. I offered to cover the gas, our brunch bill and pizza delivery at night. The next day, we are set to be picked up by my best friends and head to the courthouse. I am not excited at all because of how bad our relationship had gotten. After the courthouse wedding, we went to dinner and covered the tab (my husband offered). The day after our wedding, we’re set to fly out and he goes to Universal Studios for the whole morning. He acts like everything is fine at first but we get to the airport and he asks me if I paid for my birthday expenses. I said yes and explained the reason and he called my best friends husband a “f\\\*cking n-word hard r” in my ear at the airport. I said why would you say that? That’s HORRIBLE. You can’t say that. He said well, he is and said it was wrong for me to buy them a meal when I’ve never done it for him. We don’t talk for the 2 hours before our flight, the three hours on it or the 30 minute Uber ride home. The minute the door of our apartment shuts when we’re back he EXPLODES like never before. 24 hours after I signed the marriage license to him he was a completely different person. He said I need to buy him a bunch of meals, I said I would. He said he’s been miserable and suffering for months with me, our entire relationship. He said he’s hated his life and worst of all, he yelled at me for having “monkey friends” who couldn’t pay for themselves. He said they were below him and that this trip was a huge waste of his money because he gained nothing. He said I need to choose between being friends with them or being married to him. He yelled at me in bed calling them monkeys from 12am-4am on our first night back home after being married. I never knew a side of him like this existed. We’ve been married for 3-5 days and it’s been Hell on Earth. I begged him to apologize for saying the n-word hard r and to swear he’d never call a black person a monkey or n-word again and he said he’d rather me just divorce him now if I can’t accept him saying a word. He said everyone in China says that word and monkeys. He said that it’s not all black people, just the bad black people. He said that dignity is something you buy and my best friends husband has none so he won’t respect him. It only got better once I stopped asking about it. 

Biggest red flags:

\\- won’t promise to never say these words again, says that it’s how he genuinely feels about black people from the “streets” 

\\- “bad black people” and “good black people” 

\\- we only enjoy time at home cuddling, not time shared in public 

\\- we do the adult deed once every two weeks 

\\- he said he wishes my nose was thinner 

\\- he said i have to stay inside during the summer so i don’t get too dark (as a joke) 

\\- he wants me to give 50% of my income to house expenses and 20% of it to our shared savings account 

\\- he said he would get me a cat at the beginning of our relationship and on the day it came down to it said it’s a bad idea and cancelled it 

\\- says he doesn’t want to speak to anyone with only a high school diploma because they’re stupid and have nothing to offer (i only have a high school diploma) 

\\- i said i have family members who are poor and black and he said he only respects my family members who deserve it 

\\- doesn’t want to allow me to donate to homeless people or volunteer because he believes they deserve it 

\\- said he only respects people who struggle but aren’t lazy so they get degrees and businesses

\\- banned me from going to bars or anywhere at night during the first days of our relationship 

\\- banned me from having male friends or talking to men in any capacity 

\\-  made me decline high paying job offers in the first month or two of our relationship because he wanted me to stay living with him 

\\- i was crying last night saying he really broke my heart and he started playing a minecraft video and asking chatgpt about the green card timeline 

\\- said he would become christian for me but got upset when i said i would thank God, not him once we become successful 

\\- wanted me to gain weight, i was “too skinny” 

\\- said i am uncaring and prefers to talk about his feelings to chatGPT  

PLEASE ADVISE. WHAT DO I DO? We’ve been married less than a week and I already want to end it. I don’t want to live with an angry man but would feel so bad just giving up and embarrassing him in front of his whole family.

I’m also looking to upgrade my coffee table. I’ve stalked Facebook marketplace and thrift stores in my area for a few years now and I’m at the point where I’ll buy something new if it’s a solid investment piece.

1qyx6oy,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedvsBlue/comments/1qyx6oy/this_fandom_deserves_better_ship_names_i_can/,This fandom deserves better ship names. I can provide that.,"The ship names in this fandom are boring despite such great opportunities. A few are good, like Carwash, that's a nice pun and an actual word. Chex too, like Chex Mix. But why Tuckington? Washer is right there, even continuing the washing-related puns!

To go over a few (few meaning literally as many as I could think of until I found a ship sheet and started taking from there and then got tired), 

 \- Just to start with the ones that are already acceptable, as mentioned, we have Carwash.

 \- We also have Chex, as I also already mentioned

 \- Now to what needs to be changed, Washer instead of Tuckington, as previously mentioned.

 \- Yorkalina, what the heck is that? Let's make it a nice, simple, and funny Cork. 

 \- Grimmons isn't a word, but Griffons is.

 \- Tucker + Sister = Sucker. I think the jokes write themselves here on multiple layers. (Not sure if this is the usual one or not but I usually hear Tister, which is half the name of a German bog so not terrible I suppose.)

 \- Kimballina is one I have seen on the interwebs. Why not just make it Call (Carolina's ""Ca"" + Kimball's ""ball"")?

 \- Apparently Locus and Felix are paired by some, so they can be Focus.

 \- I've heard Washington and Connecticut put together on occasion. Connection as a name works well enough.

 \- I've seen at least a single nalwork instance of Connecticut + South Dakota and I dub them Couth because that is a word.

 \- I've also seen Washington and Four-Seven-Niner (Ash) and I don't know how common this one is but the name for it is easy: Cash.

 \- Dylan Anderson + James Addler is a canon marriage so not really a ship, but Dames is a name for 'em that's a word.

 \- ""J"" from Jensen, ""o"" from Palomo, you get Jo. Like coffee. Or a name.

 \- Lopez + Sheila, Leila. It's just another name. Nothing special here, would appreciate suggestions if there is something better.

 \- A canon one, Georgina and Biff make Geoff! Wonder who would go by that name?

 \- Vera (Agent Ohio) + Sheryl (that Charon Security Forces woman) = Veryl, which is a hardware description language. If you played with it you could get Vinyl but that's very much stretching it.

 \- I'm pretty sure I saw someone put Simmons and Jensen together. Simsen. It's not a word but if you say it it sounds like Simpson, which is an old television show that I probably don't need to be explaining but what the heck why not.

 \- Epsilon-Caboose and his email can be Camelia, which is just one letter off from Camellia, a type of flower (okay yes its a letter off so shouldn't count but shut up).

 \- This one is two letters off and more based on sound than spelling, but Agent Connecticut + Insurrectionist Leader could be Ceader / Cedar (like the wood).

 \- Another sound one, Leonard Church + Allison, you could force it into Chalice also based on sound alone with the ""Ch"" from Church and then ""Allis"" sound from Allison.

 \- One last sound one, and another canon marriage, Altus + Kalirama could sound like Callous if you take the ""Kal"" from Kalirama and ""us"" from Altus. Or if you want to get a bit closer in spelling, Kallus is a *Star Wars* character! And apparently Kalus is also a character from something else that I don't know anything about (something called *Kameo: Elements of Power*.)

 \- Backing off from the sound-based ones, Tucker and his rock can work as either Tock, like the phrase ""tick tock,"" or Rucker, like someone who does rucking (walking with weight on one's back).

 \- Mason Wu (Siris) plus his wife Megan is canon but could be called Magan (a rarer alternate spelling of Megan, and also an ancient civilization from near modern-day Sultanate of Oman and United Arab Emirates). Megan also works.

 \- Epsilon-Church and Epsilon-Tex share a lot in common with their names, actually, making their ship name very easy to find: Epsilon. (Or Epsilon- if you want to be fancy.)

 \- Another canon marriage, Grog and Grog's wife can be Grife, which is a Portuguese word apparently (I do not speak Portuguese). Or just Grog, you know. That works.

 \- Agent West had a canon wife. Taking the ""W"" from West, we can call them Wife. She's dead though.

 \- North plus South.… Is this one really a thing? I hope not, but if it is, it's just getting called Incest and we can be done with that. They can share a name with the Carolina + Texas ship as well as any other of this nature.

 \- Last one to finish off strong, why is Donut plus Doc called Docnut? Just take the ""Do"" from Doc and the ""nut"" from Donut and make it ""Donut!""

And that's all from me, folks. If you have your own ideas, feel free the contribute. Maybe I'll make a pt. 2 masterlist (with credits) if enough additions are suggested, but I think I already did far more than necessary. Enjoy these objectively better ship names!

(Just in case it wasn't already obvious, this entirely a joke, and they intentionally get sillier as the list goes down. I'm not into shipping so I do not know of all the usual ships and names, these are just the ones I heard from surfing RvB stuff on the internet plus some ones from the show and a few I snagged off an old [ship sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h89XWj-EVt1bvrY3DXlITEjUW75gbHcfxD39GSGlGv4/edit?usp=sharing) someone made.

Few months later we reconnected and he came back talking about how much he loves me, missed me and regrets his past decision. While we were broken up I became interested in a guy but things didn’t move forward anywhere. When my ex reached out I fell for him again because he was a good boyfriend but I was still a bit unsure. A month into me and my ex being back my crush, 23M, reached out and became interested in m. Because I was unsure about trusting my ex again despite him not giving me a reason, I called things off with him and start talking to my crush. My ex kept reaching out confessing his love and even though my heart skipped a beat every time i saw him or saw his text pop up and he would talk and cry about how i am his person he saw me as his wife and leaving me was the biggest mistake of his life.I couldn’t get back with him because I was already dating my crush and he was a very respectful guy. As time passed I found that my relationship with my crush was more so about being respectful and nice rather me being loved the way I wanted to be loved. 2.5 years from our breakup I found out from mutuals that my ex had moved away and 3 months from then he reached out to me. Things between me and crush were not the greatest and we were heading towards taking a break. when my ex reached out I was ready to get back with him because I truly missed him so much but I found him to be a bit different than before. When he was visiting for holidays we met up for a quick coffee and ended up making out and talking about how much we love each other. things didn’t progress much and we would text or facetime occasionally. Until I found he was with someone through social media (him being a bit different around me when we met up made sense). I confronted him and he told how he had messed up reaching out to me but he couldn’t hold back because he thinks about me everyday and how it might be too late for us to get back together because him and his girlfriend had introduced each other to families and friends and he is now being pressured by her to get engaged soon, so its too late to get out of that relationship. What bugs me about this whole situation is that the night before he was talking about marrying me so passionately and the next day he mentioned being forced to get engaged. I did get back with my crush 2-3 months later because i felt so broken after I found that out and needed some support. He doesn’t know this happened and it also makes me sickk all the time to know that he is now engaged his fiancee doesn’t know how he truly feels about her.

1qyx2k6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_Agents/comments/1qyx2k6/i_built_3_ai_employees_engineer_researcher/,"I built 3 AI Employees (Engineer, Researcher, Designer) that run locally 24/7 and I control them entirely from Telegram. This feels like hiring a remote team.","I got frustrated with the whole ""chat with AI"" paradigm. I don't want a conversation. I want work done.

So I spent the last few weeks building what basically feels like a tiny remote team using OpenClaw. Three agents, each with their own role, running locally on my machine. I manage everything through Telegram like I'm texting coworkers.

# The team:

**Neo (Engineer)** Handles all my coding tasks. I'll text something like ""build me a script that analyzes CSV files and generates charts"" and wake up to working code + output files. Last week it built me a full Manim animation explaining gradient descent because I was too lazy to do it myself.

The weird part? It genuinely feels like delegating to a junior dev. Except this one doesn't need coffee breaks.

**Pulse (Researcher)** This one's my favorite. Every morning at 7 AM, Pulse wakes up, crawls r/ LocalLLaMA, r/ OpenAI , GitHub trending, and new Hugging Face papers. By the time I'm awake, there's a digest in my Telegram with everything important that happened in AI overnight.

I'm not even exaggerating when I say I learn more before breakfast now than I used to in a full day of scrolling.

**Pixel (Designer)** Makes diagrams and visual explanations. I gave it a custom personality prompt so everything comes out in this hand-drawn technical style I like. Saves me hours on Medium posts and documentation.

# How it actually works:

Each agent lives in its own workspace folder with:

* `agent .md` — what they do
* `identity .md` — how they think/communicate
* `/skills/` — their tools (browser, Python, shell access, etc.)

The magic is **persistent memory + cron jobs**. These aren't chatbots waiting for prompts. They're scheduled workers. Pulse literally runs autonomously every morning without me doing anything.

I'm using MiniMax right now (way cheaper than Opus) but you can swap in whatever model you want. OpenAI, Anthropic, or even local Ollama models if you want near-zero cost.

# Why this feels different:

With ChatGPT/Claude, *I'm* doing the work. I'm the one managing context, copy-pasting outputs, remembering what I asked for.

With this setup, I delegate and forget. The agents handle execution, memory, and delivery.

It's the difference between using a tool and having staff.

# The part that surprised me:

I thought I'd be checking on them constantly. But after the first week, I started trusting the outputs. Now I barely think about it. I just get Telegram notifications with completed work.

That trust shift was unexpected. It genuinely changed how I think about AI in my workflow.

**Couple questions for people here:**

* Would you be comfortable with AI agents running tasks unsupervised overnight?
* What's the first role you'd automate if you built something like this?

Happy to answer any questions about the setup. I know OpenClaw's docs can be sparse in places, so if anyone's stuck on anything I've probably hit the same wall.",5,1770518270.0,AI_Agents,22,0.57,False

When we met, I didn't know he was on the spectrum; I just loved how passionate he was about helping others, including me. We clicked instantly. We bought coffee and ate lunch together every day, just the two of us. He called and messaged me daily. He is so smart, and he even shared a series he loved with me, asking for my thoughts on it.
​We were best friends, but as I developed feelings for him, I began leaving hints. I never told him directly that I loved him, and he didn't seem to pick up on my signals, so I just let things continue as they were.
​Then, everything changed. He stopped calling for months, and I didn't know why. I missed him and, in my frustration, I think I became too demanding. I said some unkind things I didn't mean. Out of impulse, I told him to block me. But I didn't really mean it. He cut me off entirely on social media. His family even blocked me, though I had never spoken to them.
​It was so sudden and abrupt. I regretted it instantly because I missed our friendship. I recently found an unconventional way to share my feelings with him. I wanted to make sure he knew I still love him, as I felt it was the only way to get my message across clearly during this silence. I also finally learned that he is on the spectrum.

1qywzna,https://www.reddit.com/r/Usogui/comments/1qywzna/my_opinion_of_usogui_so_far/,My opinion of Usogui so far,"I have just finished the tower of karma arc and I had a few thoughts about the manga. 

Positives: 

1.) I really like the art. The art is good and easy to follow along with.

2.) I like how unique a lot of the characters are

3.) The games are not repetitive and each arc introduces a new game which allows for maintaining interest.

4.) Some parts have you fascinated and on the edge of your seat.

Negatives: 

1.) Some plot points seem very contrived and over the top and I understand the the manga is supposed to be this way but it does definitely feel weird transitioning from the more grounded intro chapters to over the top ridiculous stuff tha also happens.

2.) The transitioning between arcs feels horrid to me. Once an arc finishes,  stuff just starts happening and the reader does not have time to digest the arc properly. I’ve noticed this a few times where there is no smooth transition in between arcs and it is very jarring to me.

3.) A lot of parts feel incredibly convoluted and over complex. It’s fun at first but it gets tiring especially the KY declaration arc. There’s parts with far too much exposition at times and it can feel boring. I like how the mangaka tries to be unique and complex with twists and the games, however, it can feel over the top complex for no reason. 

4.) I feel like there’s been fake out deaths in the manga and I don’t know if there will be more. So far I’ve seen it with Billy Craig, Marco (labrynth), Karl, Kyara (abandoned mine) for example. 

5.) The first 200 chapters are incredibly dull. Mostly because Baku never feels like he’s in any real danger. I get that’s how the manga works and that you’re supposed to be more interested in how Baku wins but it does take the steam outta most of the early games because there’s not really a threat until the TOK arc. 

6.) My biggest gripe with the manga is the author does not transition stuff smoothly. I don’t just mean it in between arcs either. Stuff randomly happens and you have to as the reader figure out what’s happening without any hint of transition. I found myself bewildered at times by random characters showing up and random exposition when there was not a game going on. The TOK did this much better but prior to it, the transitioning between different scenes and people felt very rugged. You’d be reading a scene thrilled and the next moment some random exposition happens about characters unrelated to the prior scene or a flashback is randomly thrown in. For example going from the intense labrynth to coffee tasting. It’s jarring to the reader. Another example is having Kajis mother show up randomly and Usogui gambling with her and then she’s gone.  

7.) The mangaka isn’t very good at flashbacks that are short. I noticed that there’s flashbacks in a lot of the arcs that are short 1-2 chapters and they feel super forced. I distinctly remember thinking the flashback of yukiide to be dull and uninteresting. I don’t think the mangaka is good at flashbacks and it’s one of his weaker points. Most of the flashbacks so far have felt like a chore to read and barely move me. 

8.) This is kind of minor but the whole dramatic “you are a liar” thing was cool at first but doing it every arc feels corny. The author tries to make stuff like that seem cool in dramatic panels and while the art work is good, it’s just super super corny and doesn’t hit after the first few times. 

Now I know I haven’t reached the best parts of this manga. However, I will say that this manga has been generally underwhelming for me. I did come in with good expectations but the over complex exposition dumping coupled with other factors just don’t make it a fun read for me. I like the characters, games, and other aspects but overall Usogui feels contrived, over complicated in places, and weirdly jarring at times with things happening in the manga. 

I will give Usogui so far a 6/10. TOK had me hooked so I’m sure the latter part of the manga is good. However, the first 200 chapters were super underwhelming and it felt like a chore to read some of those parts. The manga in the end feels more convoluted and chore like than something I pick up to read in my leisure time.

I know every coffee is different, but with some coffee's there is a trend in what they like, regarding temperature, grind size, etc. It may be a silly question, and I could certainly be wrong about the trend thing but I just wanted to know what your take is on it.

I blame the cold, personally, it is so bad that the nose burns when you breath. We have had more birds visiting the porch to eat and sleep on account of the cold. When I raised the front door curtain, I found an adorable mourning dove sleeping on the porch chair. The rose branches I left up seemed to have been enjoyed by the bunnies. I don't envy them out there. I am inside a heated house with a personal heater and I am still aching. It has made it very hard to focus on writing but still, I wrote 400 words last night and 1,000 words today; 1,400 total. A good amount of work that I would usually be happy with but I did want to write more. My aching ears and head just would not let me. Good news is that impossibly long scene is basically finished. I skipped a few peaces of description near the end to start the next scene just because I was struggling a lot near the end but it is basically done.

I want to write more about my day but I am also struggling with that. Forgive me for just listing a bunch of things that happened plainly. I started writing a little late because I was helping Mother put some 'wallpaper' stuff onto the tiered tables to protect the wood from water damage when we start growing plants. Cooper has been mildly ill recently; he threw up in my bedroom last night and in the upstairs hall this morning. I think he is also struggling with the cold. I also dropped some juice onto the carpet so I had to clean that up before I could sit down to write. None of this is particularly notable but I just wanted to write more than one paragraph. Oh, and the last of my books arrived. All are here earlier than I thought they would be. For now, I am just reading Sourcery and Northhanger Abbey; Sourcery more so than Northhanger, if I had to be honest. Reading has been helping me quite a lot with my aches, actually.

Alright, I am going to drink my evening coffee and wait for when I can take another painkiller. Sometime along the way, I will try to write a little more. Wish me luck.

Yours & Mine,

1. I recently stopped drinking coffee and now prefer iced Matcha lattes for my caffeine intake. Is there anywhere to find these on the ship?

2. It looks like we have Marvel day at Sea on our cruise. Does this replace pirate night?

3. When does Cabanas close on embarkation day?
