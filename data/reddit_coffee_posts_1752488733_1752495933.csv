1lzkzpt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lzkzpt,BRIEFING USA Day Tripper: A short review,"TL;DR: Great bag, on the heavy side, packs a lot of stuff, looks cool

A while back, I posted a rundown of my sling bag collection anda few people asked about the BRIEFING Day Tripper. Strangely enough, I‚Äôm currently on holiday in Central Europe and this is the bag I brought with me. So I figured it might be a good time to dig a bit deeper.

This bag falls into a weird category, somewhere between a sling and a shoulder bag. And while I‚Äôll always lean sling-first when I can, the Day Tripper has earned its place for one simple reason: it packs an incredible amount of stuff for its moderate size.

BRIEFING‚Äôs product pages do¬†*not*¬†do this bag justice. You really need to hold it in your hands to appreciate the material and feel. I often feel like BRIEFING doesn‚Äôt quite grasp what people want to know about their bags (especially the compartments) so I‚Äôll try to give you a better idea (even though my photographing skills are horrible, if you see a nice image in the gallery, the missus is probably responsible for it)

# What It Fits

**Main compartment:**

Surprisingly spacious. No laptop sleeve or padding, but it does fit a 13‚Äù MacBook without issue. I wouldn‚Äôt throw it around, but for light daily use, it‚Äôs fine. It also fits a packable rain jacket which won‚Äôt fit in most of my slings, for instance. There‚Äôs one big internal slip pocket, a card holder, and a pen slot, oddly satisfying to use, for some reason. It also has a key connector, which I now use far more than I thought I would.

**Front zip pocket:**

Flat, discreet, and perfect for a transit card, travel docs, or anything you want to grab quickly without opening the main section.

**Two sleeve pockets (front and back):**

These are deep enough for things like wipes. And yes, I NEVER leave the house without wipes, even when the kids aren‚Äôt around.

# Carrying It for 10 Days

After schlepping this thing around for the last ten days in some picturesque European cities, I have to say: it‚Äôs heavy, and when you‚Äôre carrying multiple water bottles for the family, even the excellent shoulder pad can‚Äôt save you from feeling it. That said, the shoulder pad itself is very comfortable. It‚Äôs not easily movable, but the strap is adjustable enough that you can get the bag to sit where you want it to.

What surprised me most is that it never feels bulky, even when it‚Äôs full. I‚Äôve stuffed it with a rain shell, notebook, laptop, cables, and a water bottle and somehow it still keeps its clean shape. I don‚Äôt know what sort of geometry sorcery is going on, but it works. It doesn‚Äôt bulge or sag weirdly when loaded it  holds its shape, which I‚Äôve come to expect from the ballistic nylon they use.

**Rain & Weather Resistance**

One of the best things about this bag is that it‚Äôs basically impervious to the elements unless you‚Äôre diving into a pool. I‚Äôve carried this bag through a two-hour rainstorm, and everything stayed dry. Even though the zippers aren‚Äôt AquaGuard or anything, they‚Äôre sturdy and pretty rain-resistant. I didn‚Äôt see any moisture inside the bag or the pockets.

**Final Thoughts**

All in all, this is a lovely wee bag that has grown on me over time . It‚Äôs a truly versatile little number that I use at home for school runs, park runs, coffee runs ‚Äî even when I have to work on the go. But it‚Äôs during this trip that the bag really won me over",1,1752495878.0,ManyBaggers,0,1.0,False

One of the most common justifications we see is people telling, usually a partner but occasionally themselves, 'we'll be saving money on buying coffee out once the machine is paid for'.

Has anyone ever found this to be true? I know i'd have to buy many a coffee to get anywhere what I've spent and continue to spend on gear and beans. ",1,1752495680.0,espresso,1,1.0,False
1lzkwxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/FlairEspresso/comments/1lzkwxb/thank_you_flair_for_the_58/,Thank you Flair for the 58+,"I have owned the flair 58+ for nearly 2 years now. Safe to say, it‚Äôs holding steady!

Was reminded again today how sublime coffee beans are when properly loved and the Flair 58+ is the right heart for it. I have tasted the bitter disappointment that is modern cafe where the beans are akin to Ashy-tasting and lack any subtle nuances unless you count maybe volcanic minerals? ü§™

I used NaturalForce coffee beans and ground them up at a 8 using my Commandante. Puck it up and 8 second infusion followed by a 30-35 second pull. The results are a frothy Cr√®me and  one of the most beautiful brightness that hits my taste buds. It‚Äôs just a shot of sunshine in my mouth. There‚Äôs a subtle sweetness and when it‚Äôs pucked and pulled right, lacks any of the bitterness whatsoever. Amazing how different the taste is between something like a Cold Brew and this Condensation of Heavens Droplet. 

Here‚Äôs my Setup

Flair 58+ - Chosen for the heating element ensure a consistent water temp

Commandante - Money is worth every penny and very easy to adjust. I use 7-8 clicks

MATOW 58mm - use it to distribute and tamp, super easy to dial

Aivee Expresso Paper Filter 58mm - Helps with the very fine particles, trust me (just trust me bro) you definitely want a filter paper.

Oxo Gooseneck Kettle - Gets my temp right at 200 F the way I like it. 

I don‚Äôt use any of the needling as I don‚Äôt have a problem with static and don‚Äôt see any channelling in my pucks. The MATOW does a really good job of distributing the grind.

Again thanks Flair!!

There‚Äôs something about matcha that feels like a hug in a cup.
It doesn‚Äôt shout like coffee.
It whispers.
‚ÄúHey, you‚Äôre okay. Take your time.‚Äù

Every time I whisk that bright green powder and watch it swirl into milk or hot water, it feels like a tiny ritual. Like I‚Äôm reclaiming my morning from the chaos of life.

It‚Äôs not just the taste ‚Äî earthy, soft, a little bitter, but also clean.
It‚Äôs the pause.
The reminder to breathe.
To slow down.

Matcha helped me through:

Burnout

Sunday scaries

And those ‚ÄúI hate the world‚Äù mornings


It‚Äôs not a miracle.
But it became my moment of peace ‚Äî when everything else felt too loud.

So yeah, I love matcha. Not just for the caffeine.

The Edinburgh Festival Fringe kicks off in three weeks. Scotland‚Äôs annual jamboree of extraordinary performance and existential despair is back.

There is not enough room here to delve into the complex, crazy ecosystem that is the Edinburgh Fringe. Fortunately,¬†[this enormous explainer I did for The Stage last summer is still largely accurate](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjr2YyB7bSOAxX5v4kEHX-zKZEQFnoECBkQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thestage.co.uk%2Flong-reads%2Fedinburgh-fringe-explained-what-you-need-to-know-about-how-the-worlds-biggest-arts-festival-really-works&usg=AOvVaw1VGwYhR587l8vYV9zDib3k&opi=89978449). There are a few key things to highlight about this year‚Äôs festival, though. Summerhall will exist,¬†[despite that looking unlikely a few months ago](https://thecrushbar.substack.com/p/shouts-and-murmurs-november-5-2024), and¬†[this guy on Interior Design Masters doing his best to ruin it](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m002ch74). Shona McCarthy is no longer in charge of the Fringe Society; look out for my interview with new boss¬†[Tony Lankester](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjSt--D7rSOAxXQmIkEHUrJHXMQFnoECBYQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thestage.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fnews%2Fedfringe-boss-exorbitant-accommodation-is-the-festivals-biggest-threat&usg=AOvVaw2YdsJy1aGvGkzcKjiT-JNI&opi=89978449)¬†in The Stage soon.

And¬†[Francesca Moody has started a new pop-up venue that will feature some exciting shows](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwity5397bSOAxVYj4kEHcf2DwoQFnoECAsQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fshedinburgh.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw02ZHBMp3uUXmdcL4FI7UwR&opi=89978449).

The Crush Bar‚Äôs coverage of the Fringe will look much as it did last year. On Tuesdays and Fridays, starting next week, I will be sending out issues featuring brief round-ups of festival-related news and lists of five shows worth seeing. I will also, if you are interested, be covering the festival in The Stage, The Scotsman, and The Financial Times, as well as via various panels and radio programmes. I will, in short, be needing an awful lot of coffee. If you want to help on that front, you know what to do.

The Edinburgh Fringe is incredible, but it can also be intimidating for artists and audiences alike. For punters, the sheer scale can be overwhelming. For performers, the emotional, physical and financial toll of putting a show on can be challenging. Before it kicks off, then, I wanted to do something small that might make those stresses and strains easier to manage, so I asked some experienced Edinburgh Fringe folk for their best advice on surviving and thriving at the festival. Here is what they said‚Ä¶

# How do you work out what to see?

*I have a browse through the brochure and book new shows from artists whose work I have seen and admired before. After that, I listen to the grapevine and make sure my schedule is not too full, so that I can fit in any shows that are hot.*  
**Wolfgang Hoffmann,**¬†[**Aurora Nova**](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwid1dqR7rSOAxWevokEHa80J2wQFnoECBgQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.auroranova.org%2F&usg=AOvVaw1pzvPXdpuFgMzhPJKXF0_Y&opi=89978449)

*It is really hard. Before August, I browse the immense programme. Then, once I get to Edinburgh, I follow my instincts: an eye-catching flyer I stumble upon, an intriguing poster, word-of-mouth. At the Fringe, everything goes!*  
**Nicola Campostori,**¬†[***Black Blues Brothers: Let‚Äôs Twist Again!***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/black-blues-brothers-let-s-twist-again)

*I keep an eye out for old friends and favourites. I also love sitting down with the big brochure and a highlighter, as well as walking down the Royal Mile and seeing what pitches grab me. It‚Äôs all about taking risks and seeing what you stumble across. That‚Äôs how you find the gems.*  
**Emma Frankland,**¬†[***No Apologies***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/no-apologies)

*The first thing we do is check to see if Cat In The Hat is coming to the Fringe that year, and then we see everything else on a bit of a whim. It‚Äôs best not to think too hard, mainly because we need our brain capacity to focus on when we‚Äôre going to see Cat In The Hat*.**In B*****,***¬†[***Philosophy Of The World***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/philosophy-of-the-world)

# How do you attract audiences to your show?

*I really think a strong image and design is so important. When the image is strong and the design good, the show immediately looks professional and worth of attention. From there, well, basically, don‚Äôt be shit. Word-of-mouth is gold and if people are saying good things about your show, others will want to come and see it. I also do as many promotional slots as I can.*  
**Laura Corcoran,**¬†[***Frisky‚Äôs Reshuffle***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/frisky-s-reshuffle)

*We all worked so hard to build social media followings over the years, and that was all illusory. Now it is all monetised and governed by a mystical algorithm, it feels more like a lottery. So, I‚Äôm back to basics. Make great work. Talk to people.*  
**Christian Barry,**¬†[***Red Like Fruit***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/red-like-fruit)

*Word-of-mouth during the opening days of the run is vital. Check your venues papering comp policy before arrival, and distribute those comps to front-line customer service staff within your venue‚Äôs postcode at cafes and bars. That way, when those staff members inevitably get asked if they‚Äôve seen anything they would recommend, they pass on your show.*  
**Tom Forster,**¬†[**Summerhall Arts**](https://festival.summerhallarts.co.uk/)

*Wear your show merch 24/7. Title recognition and repetition is so important. You don‚Äôt want to miss the opportunity to embed the title of your show in someone‚Äôs subconscious.*  
**Blair Russell,**¬†[***Jackie!!!***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/jackie)

*Flyering still dominates at the Fringe. A few hours before the show, a nice walk around strategic points and near the box office has a significant impact on ticket sales.*  
**Nicola Campostori,**¬†[***Black Blues Brothers: Let‚Äôs Twist Again!***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/black-blues-brothers-let-s-twist-again)

*We take the paperless approach and don‚Äôt have any flyers. Now, we go out with poster boards, asking people to take a photo or scan a code, and the response has been brilliant.*  
**Noel Byrne and Antonia Christophers,**¬†[***1984***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/1984)

*You have to be real about what makes your show stand out. You wrote it and you‚Äôre also performing it? Cool, so are 1000 others. The show is about a real experience you had? So is half the Fringe. You have to take a step back and try to see what really makes your show worth seeing. Study other shows that you think have a similar target audience. See that show. Chat with that team. Maybe ask to exit-flyer their show. Ten good conversations when flyering is more valuable than 100 random strangers taking a flyer to get you to stop staring at them.*

# How do you keep costs down?

*I don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs expensive. Book accommodation early. Book travel early. In the day-to-day, though, enjoy the ride, eat what you need, and sort out the credit card bills later.*  
**Christian Barry,**¬†[***Red Like Fruit***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/red-like-fruit)

*I don‚Äôt, really. I like to feel good and treat myself if I need to. Fringe is hard enough without denying myself little daily rewards.*  
**Jonny Woo,**¬†[***Jonny Woo: Suburbia***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/jonny-woo-suburbia)

*I‚Äôve become a maestro of meal prep. I do regular supermarket sweeps, then don my imaginary apron - diamond-encrusted Schiaparelli - and get chicken roasting, vegetables chopped and curries simmering. Then, I become Tupperware Tyra and divvy up dinners into colour-coded collapsible boxes.*  
**Peter Baker,**¬†[***Murder She Didn‚Äôt Write***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/murder-she-didn-t-write)

# How do you connect with industry?

*I don‚Äôt connect with industry. They connect with me. I love to schmooze, so often I will go to those weird events where an embassy or something invites people and you stand around and make industry small talk and eat free cheese. I genuinely really enjoy this.*  
**Trygve Wakenshaw,**¬†[***Monsterrrr! with Trygve Wakenshaw***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/monsterrrr-with-trygve-wakenshaw)

*At networking events. In bars. Through introduction by friends. Build your own network of friends and colleagues and be generous with your time, your information, and your praise. Treat the people that you already know as the most important. This will come back to you in magical ways.*  
**Wolfgang Hoffman,**¬†[**Aurora Nova**](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwid1dqR7rSOAxWevokEHa80J2wQFnoECBgQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.auroranova.org%2F&usg=AOvVaw1pzvPXdpuFgMzhPJKXF0_Y&opi=89978449)

*By spending time at the Traverse Theatre bar.*  
**Christian Barry,**¬†[***Red Like Fruit***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/red-like-fruit)

*Research, research, research. Get a list of arts industry members. See who is producing shows like yours. Send newsletters. Persevere with those you think are most interesting. If you don‚Äôt get a response, reach out to them on Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn. Don‚Äôt be obsessive, but keep your goal in mind.*  
**Nicola Campostori,**¬†[***Black Blues Brothers: Let‚Äôs Twist Again!***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/black-blues-brothers-let-s-twist-again)

*Talk to everyone. Not literally everyone, but you know what I mean. Relish the melting pot. Talk to people you‚Äôre standing behind in queues, sitting next to at shows, waiting to cross the road with. You never know who you might meet. A new friend. A new enemy. Either way, it‚Äôs an anecdote waiting to happen.*  
**Ellie Keel,**¬†[***Skye: A Thriller***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/skye-a-thriller)

# How do you deal with disappointment?

*By never being disappointed. What I do is tons of fun for me. If you were a kid, playing on your favourite swing at the playground for an hour each day, what could get you down? Someone tells you that they didn't think that swing was as fun as you think it is? People didn't come watch you play on your swing? What does that matter? You just rode your favourite swing for an hour!*  
**Trygve Wakenshaw,**¬†[***Monsterrrr! with Trygve Wakenshaw***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/monsterrrr-with-trygve-wakenshaw)

*When it comes to disappointments I usually initially sulk hard for maybe an hour, then I will bitch to someone for a good five to 120 mins, just to get it out of my system, then, depending on the size of the disappointment, I will either go to the gym, go to a bar, go to a club, go to a drug dealer, or go to another country.*  
**Barnie Duncan,**¬†[***Barnie Duncan: Oooky Pooky***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/barnie-duncan-oooky-pooky)

*The best way to start is by having low expectations. That way, everything good that happens is a welcome surprise.*  
**Wolfgang Hoffman,**¬†[**Aurora Nova**](http://aurora%20nova/)

*The Fringe is an unparalleled opportunity for emerging companies to perfect their craft. At the end of Groundhog Day, Bill Murray could speak French, play the piano and ice-sculpt. If the script isn‚Äôt landing how you wanted, change it. Bring other artists that you‚Äôve met at the festival onto your stage for cameos. Grow it into something that would be impossible in any other setting.*  
**Tom Forster,**¬†[**Summerhall Arts**](https://festival.summerhallarts.co.uk/)

*Remember that it passes. Not everyone can like everything you do or agree with everything. Just because one person, one day, doesn‚Äôt like your show, it doesn‚Äôt mean the next day someone won‚Äôt love it. The arts are subjective. Try not to beat yourself up, as hard as it is.*  
**Chloe Nelkin,**¬†[**Chloe Nelkin Consulting**](https://www.chloenelkinconsulting.com/)

# How do you stay sane?

*I‚Äôve learned that giving myself breaks keeps my love for the Fringe strong and my brain sane. Walks in nature, visits to a gallery, a trip down to Portobello to look at the sea, a cup of cocoa with a book in a tucked-away caf√© off the beaten track: these are some of the things I find restorative.*  
**Peter Baker,**¬†[***Murder She Didn‚Äôt Write***](http://xn--murder%20she%20didnt%20write-4r5q/)

*Don't go it alone. Build your community support system of friends and other artists who you can be vulnerable with and share your experiences, both good and bad. In other words, get some good drinking buddies.*  
**Blair Russell,**¬†[***Jackie!!!***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/jackie)

*Get a really solid show routine. It helps to focus and gets all the craziness out of your head a little. Don‚Äôt get too obsessed with reviews, ticket sales, or promo. Remember to actually enjoy this incredible festival for a minute or two!*  
**Noel Byrne and Antonia Christophers,**¬†[***1984***](http://0.0.7.192/)

*You have to treat yourself as a professional and as an athlete. It is so easy to get caught up in the excitement of the the Fringe, to stay our for a drink every night, to see that 2am comedy show, to try and fit four of your friends‚Äô shows in before performing your own. The crazy Fringe experiences have theirplace, for sure, but we have found that the only way to stick it out the whole month as a performer is to remember that we are on the job.*  
**Xhloe and Natasha,**¬†[***What If They Ate The Baby***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/what-if-they-ate-the-baby)***?/***[***And Then The Rodeo Burned Down***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/and-then-the-rodeo-burned-down)***/***[***A Letter To Lyndon B Johnson Or God: Whoever Reads This First***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/a-letter-to-lyndon-b-johnson-or-god-whoever-reads-this-first)

*The Fringe is exhilarating but can be overwhelming too. Don't let the fear of missing out drive your experience. Take breaks to properly digest what you've seen and felt. Remember you can't see everything or be everywhere, and that's okay. Artists, Fringe Central is your sanctuary for rest, development and support. Come find us. We would love to meet you.*  
**Chris Snow,**¬†[**Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society**](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwibv5PU8LSOAxVFMlkFHcT-A5sQFnoECBcQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edfringe.com%2Ftake-part%2Fartists%2Fsupport-for-artists%2F&usg=AOvVaw1Em_zyGPaTYdjd9UP50of0&opi=89978449)**.**

*I try to escape. I‚Äôm actually awful at taking this piece of advice, but it‚Äôs important to find moments for yourself. Cook a proper meal, visit the beach at Portobello, climb Arthur‚Äôs Seat - or Calton Hill if you want an easier walk - or get properly out of the city. There are some amazing places to visit only an hour away on the train.*

1lzkodh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatholicDating/comments/1lzkodh/seeking_catholic_relationship_advice_stepparent/,Seeking Catholic relationship advice (step-parent?),"Hi everyone! I posted this a few days ago on the Catholic forum but it got removed. Some of you may have seen it but I'm going to add some things at the end based on some comments I was able to read.

Hello, this is probably not something for this forum but I wanted to get the Catholic opinion on this. So long story short I am in a relationship with a girl who has a kid with somebody else. It was an abusive and narcissistic relationship everything from physical to mental, and sexual. He had been found guilty of all these charges but to skip to the point he has now been granted 50/50 custody essentially.

My girlfriend and I had talked before and I told her if the day came where he got custody and they had to deal with each other that I did not feel comfortable with them being friends, to keep it professional and talk about things that involved the baby.

This week much to my surprise and finding out only by another friend of hers, she met him to exchange the baby (this was previously done with the grandparents) and they talked for a while and decided to get along for the sake of the baby. Today she told me last minute she had a coffee date with his mother at the place where he lives, something we had also discussed that if that happened I would have to be there with her. But logically so, him and his family are uncomfortable with me being there 

I believe as a Catholic that even someone who is a narcissist can change with Christ and she believes he has but I find myself struggling with this because it seems that she is making all these decisions by herself and taking into account everyone's feelings except mine. She has completely gone backwards on what we had agreed on if this day ever came for shared custody. She is a very forgiving person and I don't doubt that she will in the future be open to being friends with him.

Part of me wants to think that this is the best for the baby and that I am giving into my insecurity and fear but part of me feels that even if he is the baby's biological father that I have been the one that filled that fatherhood role and at the end of the day he is still her ex and that I deserve some respect or acknowledgement of how I feel about the situation. 

I'm not sure what to feel, what is right or wrong. I obviously didn't get into detail of everthing and I've tried to keep it short. I ask for your prayers that God may give me wisdom and would appreciate all of your thoughts on this.

ADD ON: So based on the comments that I got on my previous post I wanted to clear up some things perhaps or clarify what I am asking.

1. I am well aware this man is going to be in our lives at the very least until the baby is an adult. I have no issue with having a decent and respectful relationship in order for the baby to not grow up in a toxic environment that bad mouths either parent BUT I am not okay with my girlfriend and her ex being friends in terms of hanging out, texting like they used to, etc. etc. This has of course not happened yet I am simply cautious of it.

2. I will admit as well as my girlfriend has admitted that we are both insecure and fearful at times however I am not for one second insecure or think I am less of a man when compared to someone who sexually assaulted and beat the woman he was supposed to love. 

3. I am not wanting to break up with her, just because someone has faults, traumas, or baggage does not make them unworthy of love. She is very self aware of the bad habits she has, if she isn't she always welcomes me to call her out on it, and since we've dated she has always worked hard to be better for herself, the baby, and me. I love her, and she has actually helped me become and better person. 

4. This has not been said yet but incase it does I do trust her, I do believe she loves me. However, as someone said in a reply ""temptation is very real"" especially with someone who abused her mentally and physically there is always the chance of trauma bonding still being there, and he knows just how to get to her head. Which brings me to I do not trust him, it was only a few weeks ago that he and his family openly lied in court and tried to lie to us about visitation hours, it was only a few days ago that he was talking badly about her, but now that they got what they wanted all of a sudden there is a change? I know what type of person he is and I don't buy it, no one in my girlfriend side of the family does, only her because once again she is very forgiving and unfortunately easily manipulated at times. 

5. I do not expect her to run all her decisions by me, nor do I want to control who she talks to like some people were saying, only because this is her ex, is the reason that I want to be kept in the loop about things and not find out from someone else that my girlfriend met up with her ex. 

6. These were not just my expectations, they were multiple conversations that lead to an agreement on behalf of both of us of how we would navigate this is shared custody ever came. My issue is that, that was thrown out the window real quick and more importantly that I was not told about it. 

7. What I am looking for more than anything is of course your thoughts, which are all welcome but advice as to how to navigate this new chapter in our relationship and where do you all think is the line between me having reasonable boundaries and being controlling.

1lzkmy3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruise/comments/1lzkmy3/celebrity_infinity_review_mostly_great_some/,"Celebrity Infinity Review - Mostly Great, Some Frustrations","We were on Celebrity Infinity Best of Greece cruise June 28 - July 5.  The sailing immediately before the fire cruise.  Overall a great experience, but a few frustrations that kept it short of outstanding.

The ship seemed well-maintained, with good amenities and a layout that never felt crowded.  We saw no indications of what happened on the next cruise.

**Highlights**

* Theater is excellent - modern, with plenty of good seats and a stress-free ‚Äújust show up‚Äù system (no reservations or tickets required).
* Food was great overall, with a nice mix of staples and rotating dishes every day.
* We mainly ate at buffet because who wants to be cooped up in a stuffy restaurant for 2 hours?  When we did eat in main dining, dinner service was pretty slow, likely due to understaffing as the service people we saw were constantly busy (first sitting at 6pm).
* Customer service on board was extremely helpful and professional.
* Pools were good, open long hours, and never felt crowded. Top deck lounge was very nice.
* Indian, Mexican, and Greek cuisine offerings were especially well made.
* Dessert bar was mostly excellent, aside from a types of cake that were dry and lacked flavor.
* Music shows were good - or so I'm told by people who like musical theater.  For me the songs were too obscure (one show promised to play ""all the classic hits you remember"" and proceeded to play post-2005 pop songs that half the audience never heard of).  The ship singers were very talented vocally.

Before the cruise, we did have an unresolved issue that eventually needed escalation. To Celebrity‚Äôs credit, they handled it well in the end.

**Areas Needing Improvement**

* Buffet coffee was absolutely awful, comparable to Dunkin.
* Pizza wasn‚Äôt great. Crust was mushy.  No variety at all, same three flavors (pepperoni, cheese, vegetable) at every meal.
* Bread options were underwhelming.  Mostly basic white rolls, rock-hard baguettes, and wheat slices, with the occasional focaccia. Where‚Äôs the ciabatta, sourdough, flatbread, or rye?
* Ground beef was poor quality, often containing hard or chewy bits of tendon or such.
* The pools, while pleasant, could stand to have the temperature lowered a few degrees.  In summer, 36-38¬∞C water is far too hot.
* Comedian wasn't funny.  Barely a giggle.  Comedy is subjective, but why book a lower-tier British ""comedian"" (if you can call trite observations about mundane things comedy) for a cruise with mostly Americans, Canadians, and Aussies?  
* The cruise director did a Vegas lounge act - what in god's name was that??  Did a real performer cancel?  They clearly put a lot of work into the visuals, so guessing this is a regular show for some unfathomable reason.  Such a vanity project.

**Itinerary Thoughts**  
Our cruise stops were a bit repetitive or dull (Hydra and Kusadasi were underwhelming; Mykonos and Santorini felt like more of the same). To be fair, that‚Äôs partly on us for choosing this itinerary.  We're experienced European travelers.  We got what we wanted from Greece, but more variety in stops would've been nice.

**Planning Issue - Santorini Logistics**  
One significant frustration was Celebrity‚Äôs lack of clear information about Santorini. We used the Celebrity website, reviewed shore excursions, and spoke with both customer service and our travel agent. None of them ever mentioned that Santorini has two ports: an OLD port and a NEW port.

Celebrity's material made it sound like the tender would drop us at the main port where taxis operate, so we booked a taxi pickup. Only when the tender arrived did we discover it drops passengers at the OLD port, which has no roads and no taxis, only a cable car or a grueling stair climb.

Celebrity should clearly state on their website and in pre-cruise materials which port tenders use**.** As it was, we wasted ‚Ç¨40 on a taxi that we couldn‚Äôt reach. Thankfully, the cable car lines were short that day, but it was stressful and unnecessary.

**Another Quirk - Shower Curtain**  
One more minor gripe: our cabin still had a shower curtain**.** Seriously ‚Äî in 2025? The showers are already narrow enough without losing six extra inches to a clingy curtain drifting into the spray. It‚Äôs a minor thing, but it feels unnecessarily cheap.

**Bottom Line**  
This was a pleasant cruise overall, and the staff on board were wonderful. But several correctable frustrations prevented it from being truly outstanding.

We'll consider Celebrity again, but 1) will book a more modern ship, especially given what happened on the cruise after ours and 2) will be triply diligent in researching logistics at each destination.

Santorini is a special case, few places have such accessibility issues.  But Celebrity goes there all the time, they should do a better job informing guests.  One clear line on their website could've avoided all our hassles.",1,1752494820.0,Cruise,3,0.67,False

1lzkluf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cleveland/comments/1lzkluf/socializingfriends_discussion/,Socializing/Friends discussion,"I have seen several comments/posts by people who say they have or have had a very hard time making friends here and I am wondering if these are cultural differences, generational differences, both, or something else.

I did not grow up in Cleveland. I would say maybe 50% of the people I am friends with grew up here at most, and those who did don't really hang out with or talk to anyone from their high school, so I am curious about this reputation that ""clevelanders stick to their own"" since it hasn't been my experience at all.

If I moved to a brand new city I would never expect strangers to chat with me and become my friends. I don't talk to people in the grocery store, I don't approach strangers at a coffee shop and try to strike up a conversation with them. I would find this behavior strange and off-putting if someone did it to me and am fascinated that this is the norm elsewhere, as everywhere else I have lived and visited, it isn't.

The way I have met new people wherever I have lived is via shared interests. The advent of the internet makes this even better IMO than when I grew up (I'm GenX). There are people I am casual friends with in online groups to where we will totally get together and hang out if either of us is in the other's state/town. I have been to wonderful group dinners in other cities with people who share a love for excellent food for example, people I found on groups like chowhound and egullet.

I made friends with women in a wedding planning board (Knot) way back in 2002 when I was planning my wedding to my ex, and many of us are still friends today even though lots of them have moved away. I also made friends online with women who were all having a baby the month and year I did (BabyCenter). I am still friends with tons of these women online and we get together whenever we are in each other's city or state.

I've previously mentioned theater people who were instantly like family, another shared interest, and I have friends I've met in online running groups and I used to be in a book club and trivia group and am still friends with some people from those groups. I recently joined a group for women who get together for pool parties and dinners out and dancing. I've even met people volunteering at an animal sanctuary in TN who I am still in touch with years later.

How is it people are attempting to find friends that it is not working out? If you're just showing up to some public space like a bar and hoping to make friends there, that's probably not going to work unless you're going to a small concert club to see an artist you both like or something. You have to pursue interests and hobbies that you like to do and you'll meet people doing those things who have a shared interest. Are people not doing that? 

I feel bad there are so many people who seem to be having trouble finding friends and I wonder if the method is the issue?",1,1752494726.0,Cleveland,0,0.6,False

# Chapter 1 Wrongly Accused

The Red Pavilion.

Charlotte Gibbs was scrubbing the toilet with a blank stare when the stewardess barked from outside, ""Charlotte, clean yourself up and get out here. Hurry up.""

Tomorrow was her coming-of-age party. And that meant one thing‚Äîher first night with a client.

Her fingers tightened around the small vial hidden inside her pouch. She'd prepared it days ago.

Colorless. Tasteless. Instant death.

The stewardess, irritated by her silence, kicked over the bucket, sending dirty water splashing across the floor. ""Count yourself lucky,"" she sneered. ""You're just about old enough to start servicing men‚Äîand now the General's estate wants you back!""

Charlotte froze.

She had once been the most beloved daughter of the Hastings family‚Äîgranted the noble title Lady of Rennhall by the King himself.

But everything changed on her twelfth birthday. That day, Brielle Hastings arrived at their gates dressed in mourning white, bowed, and held out a jewel pendant. She claimed she was the real daughter of the Hastings family, and that years ago, the midwife had been bribed‚ÄîCharlotte was just a pawn in a cruel switch.

The midwife confessed and died shortly after. Brielle had nowhere else to go, so she sought refuge with the Hastings family.

No further proof was needed. Brielle's face looked nearly identical to Valeria Hastings's‚Äîclose enough to settle the matter on sight.

Out of old loyalty, the family let Charlotte stay in the house. But she was no longer respected now.

People praised the Hastings family for their grace. ""They treat both girls equally,"" they said. ""Such kindness. Such generosity.""

Until the Queen Mother Daphne Harcourt's birthday celebration. The Queen had offered a Holy Grail painting as a gift.

During the event, the noble ladies crowded around to admire it. In the midst of it all, Brielle's golden hairpin slipped‚Äîdamaging the art.

The King was furious. Valeria turned around and, without hesitation, slapped Charlotte to the ground.

""The General's estate took you in out of mercy, forgave your deceit‚Äîand this is how you repay us? You'd bring disgrace upon our entire house?""

Charlotte could only stare in shock at the woman who had once called her daughter. But in Valeria's eyes, there was no sorrow. Only loathing.

Everyone who once loved her now treated her like a curse.

She tried to defend herself, to say it was Brielle who tore the painting.

But they told her, ""Charlotte, this is the debt you owe the Hastings family. This is the sin you must atone for.""

And so, she was sent to the Red Pavilion.

It wasn't like other institutions. There were no rules here‚Äîonly filth, cruelty, and chaos. Those forced to serve here were treated worse than animals.

At first, she fought. She cried. She refused to accept it.

Until the day she saw another girl‚Äîone who had arrived with her‚Äîbeaten to death just for scratching a courtesan's skin.

After that, Charlotte learned to obey. She lived on edge, surviving one day at a time.

Every day, she told herself‚Äîmaybe someone from the Hastings family would remember the twelve years they raised her. Maybe someone would come.

But no one ever did. Not even once.

Whatever affection she had left for the Hastings family had long since withered away under the daily torment of life in the Red Pavilion.

She no longer wanted to go back. She would rather die.

But her fate was never hers to decide.

The stewardess scrubbed her down in ice-cold well water, her skin turning pale and wrinkled from the chill.

""Once you're back at the General's estate, mind your tongue,"" the woman warned. ""Don't think for a second they brought you back to be a young lady again. You came from the Red Pavilion, and that's all you'll ever be. Even if you're in their house, you're nothing but a servant now.""

After those words, she was dragged outside.

Sunlight‚Äîwarm, golden, and long-missed‚Äîbathed her skin. But Charlotte kept her head lowered. She was a slave. She had no right to look up. From beneath her lashes, she caught a glimpse of white silk‚Äîelegant, expensive, and unmistakably fine.

She didn't need to raise her head to know who it was.

Oliver Hastings. Her brother. The one who once adored her more than anything. He had loved the color blue. But ever since Brielle arrived at the Hastings family wearing white, he switched to white too‚Äîand never wore blue again.

Now, only a step separated them. But she could never call him brother again.

Charlotte's vision blurred. A dull ache tightened in her chest as she followed the stewardess in bowing deeply. ""Lord Oliver.""

Oliver looked past the stewardess‚Äîand paused when his eyes landed on her.

The Charlotte he remembered had always been full of smiles, cheeks round and soft. Everyone had loved to pinch them. She had been the little darling of the house.

But now... she looked like a lifeless puppet. Gaunt, pale, shrinking in on herself‚Äîthere wasn't a trace of the bright girl she used to be.

A pang hit him square in the chest.

She was the girl he'd carried in his arms as she grew up.

When she was little, she used to ride on his shoulders.

As she got older, she followed him everywhere.

She'd been raised bold, full of spirit‚Äîso confident, she practically ruled Aurenshire with her swagger.

He was just about to take a step toward her when a sweet, playful voice called from behind.

""Oliver!""

Oliver halted immediately. ""Brielle, be careful,"" he said quickly.

A lighthearted laugh followed. ""Oliver, I don't need help. I'm not a child anymore!""

He smiled gently. ""You'll always be a child to me.""

Charlotte's chest tightened. She hadn't thought she could feel hurt anymore‚Äîbut hearing those words, the same ones he used to say to her, made her nose sting with the effort to hold back tears.

Brielle took his hand and led him toward Charlotte. She reached out and gently grabbed Charlotte's hand, her voice soft with guilt and concern. ""Charlotte, you've gotten so thin‚Ä¶ Did they treat you badly at the Red Pavilion? We're the ones at fault for not coming sooner. I was sick for a while and the whole family was caught up in it. Otherwise, we would've brought you back long ago.""

Charlotte yanked her hand away and lowered her head even further, cutting her off politely. ""My hands are rough, Miss Hastings. I wouldn't want to dirty your clothes.""

Brielle's expression fell, sorrow deepening. ""Are you angry at me? If I hadn't come back, you'd still be the King's titled princess. His Majesty only punished you because he still cares about our family. If I hadn't returned, none of this would've happened to you.""

Oliver, who had been about to speak, fell silent. Her words had taken the wind out of him. He straightened, tone cooling. ""That title was never hers to begin with. You can't keep what was stolen. The only reason she got away with it for so long was because we spoiled her. No wonder she ended up so reckless.""

""Do you have any idea what you've caused? Grandfather's fallen ill over this. Brielle's been so consumed by guilt, she can barely sleep. Whatever suffering you think you've endured doesn't even come close to what we've been through.""

Charlotte found it all painfully absurd.

She had been a newborn when she was switched‚Äîwhat say did she ever have in any of this?

It was Brielle who ruined the painting, yet it was Charlotte who paid the price.

Three years. Over a thousand days and nights of scraping by, surviving without hope.

And now, she wasn't even allowed to feel wronged.

Not that it mattered anymore.

Titles. Blame. Justice. None of it held weight now.

Just like they said: she had lived the good life in someone else's place for over a decade. These years of suffering‚Äîthis was just the price she owed.

Oliver misunderstood her silence, thinking she was throwing another childish tantrum. He felt a flicker of frustration. ""Tomorrow is Brielle's coming-of-age party. She wanted the whole family together. She even had Father petition the King to get you released. Don't act like a spoiled child‚Äîcome home with me.""

As he spoke, he reached out to grab her arm. Charlotte instinctively stepped back.

He froze. Then watched, stunned, as Charlotte bowed. ""This isn't proper, Lord Oliver,"" she said, voice calm and even.

His hand hovered in the air, then slowly curled into a fist.

He just wanted her to remember Brielle's kindness‚Äînot stand there, cold and distant, as if she'd already made peace with dying.

Even Brielle was taken aback. She blinked, stunned for a moment, then tugged at his sleeve. ""Oliver, help her up‚Ä¶""

Oliver frowned. He wanted to say something‚Äîanything‚Äîbut swallowed it down for the sake of peace.

Instead, he reached out, grabbed Charlotte's arm, and hauled her up without a word‚Äîthen shoved her roughly into the waiting carriage.

# Chapter 2 Come Back Home

""Don't be ungrateful,"" Oliver snapped. ""If I hadn't come for you, who knows whose bed you'd be tossed into tomorrow‚Äîsome noble's plaything. You may not be a real Hastings, but the family still has its pride. If we weren't worried you'd ruin Brielle's reputation before her marriage into the Marquis' estate, you wouldn't have taken a single step out of the Red Pavilion.""

A dull ache throbbed in Charlotte's arm where he gripped her. She tried to pull away, but Oliver's hold was too tight‚Äîthere was no escaping it.

She was practically thrown into the carriage, her head slamming against the wall with a sharp crack. Her vision swam.

Still dizzy, she bowed deeply. Instinct took over. ""I'm sorry, it's my fault. I'll go back‚ÄîI'll do whatever you say. Just‚Ä¶ please, don't hit me.""

Oliver's anger caught in his throat.

He looked at her‚Äîonce proud and radiant‚Äînow bowing low, begging like a servant for mercy. The sight pierced him like a blade to the chest. It left him breathless.

""So‚Ä¶ the Red Pavilion really does know how to train people.""

He forced the words through clenched teeth, then turned away and helped Brielle into the carriage.

Inside, the main seat was only big enough for two.

The rest of the space was filled with Brielle's favorite treats and soups.

Charlotte remained bowing by the edge, head lowered, silent. Oliver's words echoed in her mind.

She knew exactly what he meant.

The Red Pavilion had taken what used to be a proud, highborn daughter of the General's estate and crushed her into a submissive slave. Quite the transformation.

The fire in her bones, the defiance she once had, had been worn down over endless nights of beatings and insults.

She'd thought she no longer cared about the Hastings family.

But as she heard that they brought her back only to protect their own image‚Äîher chest still tightened despite herself.

To them, this ruined body of hers had only one last use: ensuring Brielle married into the Marquis' estate without a blemish on her name.

Even without the Hastings family, she never would've let her purity be taken from her.

She'd been ready.

Charlotte reached into her sleeve and gently touched the vial hidden in her pouch.

But they didn't believe she'd defend her own dignity.

She thought, 'Fine. I can wait a little longer.'

""Why don't you sit next to Oliver?"" Brielle said sweetly. ""You two haven't seen each other in so long. I don't mind moving.""

The carriage had already begun to roll. As Brielle stood to switch seats, she stumbled and knocked over a box. Hot soup spilled everywhere.

""Brielle!""

Oliver shot up and rushed to her side. Seeing that only the edge of her robe was damp, he finally breathed. ""Sit properly. Why were you even moving? What were you thinking?""

""It's just a short ride. What difference does it make where she sits? If she likes bowing so much, let her stay there.""

As he spoke, Oliver shot a glance at Charlotte.

Brielle tugged at his sleeve with a soft whine. ""She just wanted to be closer to you. Don't be mad at her. Oh‚Äîand Charlotte, did the soup splash on you?""

Before Charlotte could answer, Oliver cut in coldly, ""She's bowing halfway across the carriage. How could it have reached her?""

Charlotte quietly pulled her scalded hand into her sleeve.

""Thank you for your concern, Miss Hastings. I'm fine,"" she said softly.

Oliver's brow creased in irritation.

""Brielle's being kind. What's with that tone? Calling her Miss Hastings‚Äîdo you want people thinking she's acting above you, putting on airs?""

Charlotte gave a faint smile, one that didn't reach her eyes. They'd said she lacked manners and sent her to the Red Pavilion to learn discipline. Now, they were upset she was too proper.

She thought, 'I am a servant now‚Äîwhat should I be calling Brielle?'

Her heart felt numb.

They weren't the same anymore. She should've remembered that.

The carriage arrived at the Hastings family before long.

Before it had even come to a full stop, Brielle fluttered out like a butterfly. Oliver, worried she might fall, jumped down right after her.

""Mother, I brought Charlotte back!"" Brielle called brightly. ""You don't have to cry in secret anymore.""

""Oh my sweet girl, be careful now. That carriage is high‚Äîlet your brother help you down,"" Valeria's voice called out warmly.

The moment Charlotte heard it, her heart twisted painfully.

That slap from three years ago still burned on her cheek, clear as day. Now, just one curtain separated her from the Hastings family‚Äîbut for some reason, her feet refused to move.

""Where's Charlotte? Why isn't she coming down?"" Valeria asked, her voice anxious.

Brielle quickly lowered her head, her tone soft with guilt. ""It's my fault, Mother. I should've let Charlotte get out first.""

As he saw her take the blame, Oliver's temper flared again. ""What does it matter who steps down first? She's clearly doing it on purpose, throwing a tantrum in front of Mother. You didn't do anything wrong."" He turned toward the carriage. ""Charlotte, are you seriously waiting for me to come drag you out?""

Charlotte heard every word loud and clear and swallowed the sting rising in her throat.

She was a disgraced servant now. She wondered, 'How can I expect Lord Oliver to personally invite me down?'

She tried to stand, but her legs‚Äînumb from bowing too long‚Äîrefused to move.

Oliver, unaware, pulled back the curtain and reached in to help her.

""No need, Lord Oliver, I‚Äî""

But before she could finish, he assumed she was trying to embarrass him. His expression hardened, and without hesitation, he yanked her out of the carriage.

Years of military training had made his grip unforgiving. Charlotte couldn't resist, and without the strength to stand, she fell hard to the ground.

A collective gasp rose from the onlookers.

Valeria rushed forward, worry etched across her face. ""Charlotte‚Äîyour legs‚Ä¶""

But when she got close enough, she stopped short. Charlotte's face was drawn and sallow, a far cry from the lively girl she used to know. After all, she'd raised her herself. And it was her fault Charlotte had ended up in the Red Pavilion in the first place. A wave of guilt washed over her, and tears welled in her eyes.

""My poor child‚Ä¶ this is all my fault. I should've protected you. I should've never let them hurt you like this‚Ä¶""

Oliver stepped forward, ready to comfort her, when Brielle's quiet voice drifted over. ""Didn't Charlotte seem perfectly fine just a moment ago? Why is she suddenly collapsing now that she sees Mother?""

Oliver froze mid-step. ""Exactly,"" he said, coldly. ""You were just fine earlier. Now you're putting on a show to win Mother's sympathy? What kind of game is this?""

Charlotte looked up sharply, her eyes cold and expressionless as she stared at him.

When she was younger, she'd believed Oliver was the best man in the world‚Äînoble, upright, and kind.

Even after Brielle came back and things turned against her, he had still seemed fair. He would sneak her little gifts in private, try to make her feel better.

She had never blamed him.

But now, after three years apart, he was blindly following Brielle's lead‚Äîunable to tell right from wrong.

""It's nothing,"" Charlotte said quietly. ""My legs just went numb from bowing."" She brushed the dust and slowly straightened up on her own.

Valeria's face darkened. ""You had her bow the entire way home? Are you out of your mind?""

Oliver opened his mouth to defend himself. ""It wasn't like that‚Äîshe‚Äî""

Charlotte said nothing. After all, he had told her to bow the whole ride back.

""Enough!"" Valeria snapped. ""Apologize to Charlotte. She's been through hell, and this is how you treat her the moment she returns? Are you trying to break your mother's heart?""

Brielle's eyes filled with tears as she spoke softly, ""Don't be angry, Mother. It's my fault. I should've switched seats with Charlotte‚Ä¶""

Oliver's brow furrowed deeper. Whatever flicker of guilt he had left vanished, replaced by irritation. Even resentment. ""What are you blaming yourself for?"" he snapped. ""She knew she was uncomfortable. Why didn't she say anything? No‚Äîshe wanted to make a scene, make Mother cry. After all these years, the only thing she's learned is how to play victim.""

# Chapter 3 Still Count?

Charlotte looked at Oliver‚Äîdisappointed, but silent.

She turned and gave Valeria a respectful bow. ""Lady Valeria, I'm all right. Please don't worry yourself.""

Lady Valeria.

Each word was like a dagger to the heart of the Hastings family.

For a moment, Valeria stood frozen. Her eyes brimmed with tears again as an old memory came rushing back‚Äîof the sweet little girl who used to curl up in her arms, calling her Mother in the softest voice, gently wiping away her tears when she was sad.

But that girl was gone. Now all that remained was a stranger.

""Charlotte‚Ä¶ do you still blame me?"" she asked, voice trembling. ""Back then, I truly had no choice. One wrong move and it would've cost lives. You and Brielle are both my children‚Äîequally precious to me. But she'd just returned after twelve years away‚Ä¶ If there was a mistake, it was mine. I failed to guide you both properly. How could I possibly‚Ä¶""

She didn't finish, but Charlotte understood. In Valeria's heart, she had received twelve years of love and care from the Hastings family. So when punishment came, she was the one expected to bear it.

""I would never dare blame you, Lady Valeria,"" Charlotte said softly. ""I'm a servant now. Even if the Hastings family redeemed me from the Red Pavilion, I remain a slave. It's only right that I speak and carry myself as one. Please, don't trouble yourself on my account.""

Valeria let out a quiet breath, as if relieved. ""That's just talk from outsiders,"" she said. ""To us, you're still a daughter of the General's estate‚Äîjust like Brielle. Nothing has changed.""

It was what they'd said back when Brielle returned, when everyone had questioned whether Charlotte should stay.

And Charlotte had believed it.

After all, twelve years of affection couldn't vanish overnight.

But now‚Ä¶ she couldn't afford to believe it anymore.

She was about to respond when Valeria gently took her arm and led her inside.

""I had Rainmere Hall cleaned up for you,"" she said. ""It's right next to Brielle's quarters. The two of you can keep each other company.""

Brielle chimed in, eyes full of admiration. ""Charlotte, Mother prepared Rainmere Hall just for you! Even I didn't get this kind of treatment. Look‚Äîshe even hurt her hands fixing it up.""

Charlotte glanced down at the hand resting on her arm‚Äîsmall cuts and scrapes covered her fingers.

Her chest tightened.

Twelve years together‚Äîperhaps Valeria did still care for her. At least a little.

""Thank you, Lady Valeria,"" she said softly.

Behind them, Oliver muttered through clenched teeth, ""Seriously? Is it still not enough? Mother's done everything for you‚Äîand that still doesn't erase your bitterness? You were in the Red Pavilion for three years. But Brielle? She grew up without the love of her real parents.""

The words had barely left his mouth when Brielle let out a delicate sniffle, her eyes brimming with tears at the mention of her lonely childhood.

Immediately, Valeria let go of Charlotte and wrapped her arms around Brielle, comforting her softly.

Charlotte looked down at her empty arm and almost laughed.

Three years in the Red Pavilion‚Äîthree years of beatings, hunger, and humiliation‚Äîand to them, it didn't even register. They used to say she was innocent, that she couldn't be blamed for the switch at birth. But now? They couldn't even be bothered to pretend.

Maybe to keep her from hearing more, Valeria shot Oliver a warning look. ""She's only just come back. Must you say such things now?""

She turned and continued walking with Charlotte toward Rainmere Hall. But her hand never reached out again.

Only when they arrived did Charlotte understand how Valeria's hands had gotten injured.

The courtyard walls were cracked and crumbling. The front gate leaned crookedly on its hinges. Weeds ran wild across the yard. The door was wide open, and inside, the furnishings were sparse and crude‚Äîso few you could count them on one hand.

This place was so run-down, it wasn't just neglected‚Äîit was dangerous. You could cut yourself just brushing against a table.

Valeria gave an awkward smile. ""The estate's been busy with so many things. I only had time to come clean at night. The lighting was poor, and I may not have arranged things to your liking‚Ä¶""

Charlotte's voice was calm but cool. ""You're too kind, Lady Valeria. If you didn't have time, you needn't have troubled yourself. I can live anywhere‚Äîit makes no difference.""

Before Valeria could respond, Oliver snapped from behind, ""Mother's been running herself ragged these past three months planning Brielle's coming-of-age party. She barely has time to breathe! And she still found time to come set this place up for you. Isn't that enough?""

Charlotte had told herself again and again not to feel hurt. But it was useless. Her heart still felt as if something had been carved out of it.

So‚Ä¶ they'd started planning Brielle's ceremony three months ago.

And during those three months, how many times had Charlotte been beaten? Gone hungry? Cried herself to sleep? Not once had the Hastings family thought of her.

They knew the rules. They knew that when a girl came of age in the Red Pavilion, she would be sent to serve her first client. They knew. And still‚Äîthey waited until the day before to bring her home.

Charlotte kept her head down, quietly listening as Oliver lectured her.

""Try thinking more about Mother's feelings instead of wasting energy on things that don't matter. This courtyard's not bad at all‚Äîdefinitely better than wherever you were staying in the Red Pavilion.""

Charlotte glanced around at the dusty, neglected yard. Yes, it was better than the Red Pavilion‚Äîmuch better. She had no right to be ungrateful. Besides, he was still here. She had made it back. She could still see him. That was already more than enough.

No matter what Valeria said, Charlotte remained quietly respectful. Her posture perfect, eyes lowered. It was as if none of it concerned her at all.

Eventually, Valeria's words began to falter. Her expression grew strained, her voice soft but tired. ""Charlotte, you must be worn out after the journey. Get some rest. Tonight, we'll have a proper family dinner.

""You're home now, so settle in. This is still your home. If anyone mistreats you, come straight to me.""

Charlotte bowed and bowed deeply, hands pressed to her forehead. ""Yes, Lady Valeria. Thank you for your kindness.""

""You're unbelievable,"" Oliver muttered before turning and walking away in frustration.

Valeria hesitated, clearly wanting to say something more. But in the end, she just sighed. With the help of her maid, she turned to leave.

But before she could step out the door, Charlotte spoke, ""Lady Valeria.""

Valeria turned back, a flicker of hope in her eyes.

Charlotte still stood in the same spot‚Äîfrail and slightly hunched. But for the first time, she met Valeria's gaze directly. Her eyes were calm, too calm, the kind of calm that came after everything had already been burned away.

She looked like someone who had aged far beyond her years.

And yet, tomorrow was supposed to be her coming-of-age.

A strange ache tightened in Valeria's chest, a sudden fear that this girl in front of her might simply vanish. ""Charlotte?""

""You once made me a promise,"" Charlotte said quietly. ""Does it still count?""

She didn't explain further, but Valeria understood instantly.

Back when Charlotte was sent to the Red Pavilion, she hadn't gone willingly. She had begged, crying, not to be sent.

The Red Pavilion was a place that swallowed people whole. Even those who survived came out broken. The King had wanted to make an example of her‚Äîa punishment for impersonating a Hastings daughter. The sentence had been deliberately harsh.

But Charlotte wasn't just anyone. She had been the daughter Valeria had raised and loved for twelve years, her pride and joy.

Valeria had hesitated. Her heart had softened more than once. But in the end, between Charlotte and Brielle, she had chosen Brielle.

She'd reminded herself over and over, 'Brielle is your real daughter. Charlotte is just a girl who didn't belong here.

She lived like royalty for twelve years‚Äîwasn't that already more than enough? What's three years in the Red Pavilion compared to that?'

She had convinced herself she'd made the right decision.

And to make Charlotte go quietly, without resisting, what had she said back then?

""Serve your three years in the Red Pavilion, and afterward, you and the Hastings family will have nothing more to do with each other.""

Now, hearing those words thrown back at her, Valeria froze, her face full of disbelief. Then, her expression hardened. ""Charlotte, don't be foolish. You're a young girl‚Äîif you leave the Hastings family, where would you even go?""

The maid at her side chimed in, voice full of anguish, ""Lady Charlotte, you only think of your own suffering these past three years. But did you know that Lady Valeria hasn't had a single peaceful night's sleep in all that time? She's cried every day for you. It's normal to act out a little on your first day back‚Äîbut how could you say something so cruel?""

Valeria raised a hand to stop her. ""Charlotte, you come of age tomorrow. Think carefully before you speak again. For now, I'll pretend I never heard what you just said.""

Charlotte lowered her gaze once more, her voice even. ""Understood.""

But inside, she couldn't help but feel bitter.

Once upon a time, she might have believed those words. She might have been moved by Valeria's so-called concern.

But the Red Pavilion had taught her something vital: if you want to know someone's heart, watch what they do‚Äînot what they say.

The Red Pavilion wasn't far. The Hastings family was powerful. If they'd truly wanted to see her, they could have. But they never came.

All those sleepless nights and tears‚Äîif they ever happened‚Äîwere just guilt in search of a convenient outlet.

She didn't need that. Not anymore.

Valeria gave her one final look‚Äîone full of disappointment. ""Oh, one more thing‚ÄîBrielle's coming-of-age party is tomorrow. The heir of the Marquis' estate will be attending. Be sure to make an appearance, but‚Ä¶ keep your distance.""

# Chapter 4 Her Debut

The heir of the Marquis' estate, Michael Sutton, had led troops into battle in his father's place at just twelve years old‚Äîand returned a decorated war hero.

Brilliant in both strategy and combat, he was the very definition of extraordinary.

He had once been Charlotte's betrothed. Now, he was engaged to Brielle.

After Brielle returned to the Hastings family, the engagement was naturally handed over to her. Everyone in Aurenshire knew it was only ""right."" And everyone also knew just how many foolish things Charlotte had done in the past, all to win Michael's favor.

Late-night fireflies, morning dew, coffee in early spring‚Äîthose were all things she had once prepared for him.

Because she had believed in a lifetime together. A love that would last, year after year, day after day.

Back then, it hadn't mattered‚Äîshe was certain they would marry eventually. He was her future husband. Everything she did for him felt natural, even expected. But now, Michael belonged to someone else. And the Hastings family cared about appearances.

He probably did too.

Charlotte's heart, which had remained steady through everything else, now felt hollow with bitterness and pain.

She still remembered that day clearly. When they came to take her to the Red Pavilion, she had nearly lunged at Brielle in a fit of rage. But Michael stepped between them, shielding Brielle, his expression unreadable as he looked at her. ""Charlotte,"" he said, ""this is what you owe her. Just go. I promise‚ÄîI'll visit you.""

And he did, a few times. But it wasn't long before the Sutton family stepped in.

Their brilliant young heir had a boundless future ahead‚Äîand a marriage alliance with the Hastings family. What would people think if he kept visiting a girl from the Red Pavilion?

They even offered her a ""compromise"": if she stopped seeing him, they'd consider letting her in as a concubine once she was released.",1,1752494641.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

The doctor told me to call my husband to sign the consent form so they could operate on me. I had no choice but to call him. But he never picked up.

Ten minutes later, we lost our second child.

When I woke up from the surgery, I checked my phone as usual and saw that my mother-in-law had posted something on her social media.

A picture of a happy family‚Äîfour people, all smiling and full of love.

‚ÄúAnother baby boy on the way for the Lingards. I just wish that shameless woman would finally get out of my son‚Äôs life,‚Äù she wrote.

It turned out, on the day I had the accident, my husband had taken his first love to an amusement park.

She had a child around the same age our daughter would have been‚Äîif we hadn‚Äôt buried her.

And now, she was even pregnant with their second child.

I stared at the screen and let out a bitter laugh.

Since he had so shamelessly betrayed me, it was time for me to leave.

‚Äî‚Äî

The day I found out my husband ‚Äî Alaric Lingard, had been cheating, I did two things.

First, I arranged for the hospital to release my baby‚Äôs remains.

Second, I drafted two agreements: one for my resignation and one for our divorce.

Then I called my father.

‚ÄúDad,‚Äù I said, my voice barely steady. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll come back and take over the company. I‚Äôll return once my immigration paperwork clears.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve finally come to your senses,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAlaric was never right for you.‚Äù

I swallowed the lump in my throat. ‚ÄúYou were right all along.‚Äù

After hanging up, I looked down at the tiny box in my lap‚Äîwhite, clean, far too small to be carrying a life that never had a chance.

I cried. Quietly, bitterly.

Then I stood to leave‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs when I heard it.

‚ÄúMr. Lingard, I‚Äôm not trying to be greedy. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ too many people were involved. If even one of them talks, we‚Äôre in serious trouble.‚Äù

I froze.

That voice‚Äîfamiliar and cold‚Äîbelonged to my daughter‚Äôs former surgeon.

A chill crept up my spine as I inched closer to the slightly open door. Something in me knew‚Äîwhatever came next would destroy me.

The man continued, unaware I was listening.

‚ÄúIf word gets out that you stole the donor heart on the day of your daughter‚Äôs surgery‚Ä¶ the Lingard Dominion Group‚Äôs stock will take a nosedive.‚Äù

My lungs refused to work. My chest tightened.

The voice on the other end of the call‚ÄîAlaric‚Äôs‚Äîsnapped in anger.

But the doctor didn‚Äôt stop.

‚ÄúAnd let‚Äôs not forget‚Ä¶ you took that heart to save Miss Lowe‚Äôs child. Wonder how your wife would react if she found out...‚Äù

My knees nearly gave out.

Everything clicked. The missing pieces snapped into place with cruel precision.

Sabrine Lowe‚ÄîAlaric‚Äôs first love, his unreachable fantasy.

Seven years ago, when the Lingard family faced collapse, she left the country without hesitation. I was the one who stepped up. I married him, brought the money and saved his family‚Äôs legacy.

Three years ago, Sabrine came crawling back.

After that, Alaric changed.

He zoned out during our dinners. Started skipping anniversaries. Missing holidays.

I thought he was just stressed from work‚Äîuntil the day I caught him and Sabrine making out in his office.

I lost it. Screamed, threw things‚Äîturned into someone I didn‚Äôt even recognize.

And all I got in return was a sigh and a half-assed excuse. He said it was an accident. That she tripped into his arms. That I saw it wrong.

We didn‚Äôt talk for a month. Then our daughter was diagnosed with a congenital heart condition and the crisis forced us into a fragile peace.

I still remember him holding us both in his arms, kissing my forehead, whispering like a man who meant every word:

‚ÄúAs long as I‚Äôm the head of Lingard Dominion Group, I won‚Äôt let our daughter die.‚Äù

And I believed him. And shortly after, we found a donor heart. It felt like the nightmare might finally end.

But the surgery failed.

Alaric tried to pull me out of the grief by pushing me into another pregnancy.

But now I know the real reason my daughter died.

She didn‚Äôt die because the surgery failed‚Äî

She died because the very man who once swore he‚Äôd never let her die‚Ä¶ gave her heart to Sabrine‚Äôs child.

And on the anniversary of her death, he took them‚ÄîSabrine and her son‚Äîon a cheerful outing to an amusement park.

My thoughts returned to the new life that never even had the chance to open its eyes.

Pain tore through me like claws.

I clutched my chest as the grief and the lingering wounds from the accident flared back to life.

Fine. If this was what Alaric wanted, then I would walk away and leave him with his dream woman‚Äîerasing every trace of myself from his life.



Chapter 2

The moment I stepped inside the house, I was greeted by a scene that made my stomach churn. There, lounging in the living room like she owned the place, was Sabrine. My mother-in-law sat beside her, doting on the baby in Sabrine‚Äôs arms, cooing over him like he was royalty.

Sabrine sat beside her, dressed head-to-toe in custom designer pieces, glowing with health and happiness. Her belly had started to show. She looked every bit the picture of happiness‚Äîa woman cherished, protected, adored.

Before I could open my mouth to say a polite hello, she turned her head, smile syrupy sweet, voice laced with faux concern.

‚ÄúMrs. Lingard,‚Äù she cooed, addressing my mother-in-law, ‚Äúwhat if Lila doesn‚Äôt want me to move in? She is your daughter-in-law, after all.‚Äù

My mother-in-law‚Äôs smile vanished like a flipped switch.

‚ÄúDaughter-in-law? Don‚Äôt make me laugh,‚Äù she scoffed. ‚ÄúAll she gave us after years of marriage was a sickly child. Good riddance she‚Äôs gone. If Alaric hadn‚Äôt been so damn stubborn about keeping her around, I would‚Äôve kicked her out years ago.‚Äù

She turned to Sabrine with a proud smile. ‚ÄúYou, on the other hand, gave us a grandson. If you ask me, Alaric should just divorce that tramp and marry you instead.‚Äù

Sabrine giggled behind her hand, as if none of this was cruel.

I didn‚Äôt flinch. I kept my face blank as I walked right past them, not even sparing them a glance.

I had always known my mother-in-law never liked me. The Andersons were one of the wealthiest, most powerful families in the country and though our money had saved the Lingards from bankruptcy, she never once appreciated it.

To her, I was just another spoiled rich girl. And like all spoiled girls, she believed any kindness I offered came with a price.

Ever since Sabrine came back into the picture, she‚Äôd been scheming to reunite her with Alaric.

Alaric used to tell me he would never go back to a woman who had abandoned him. But their son was already so big now. Clearly, they'd been back together far longer than I thought.

I was too numb to care anymore. I headed upstairs.

That‚Äôs when my mother-in-law finally noticed me.

‚ÄúLila!‚Äù she barked. ‚ÄúThe disrespect these days! Walking into my home without so much as a greeting? No wonder that weak little child of yours didn‚Äôt make it through surgery. It was your karma. Your lack of respect cursed your own daughter.‚Äù

I froze mid-step.

Slowly, I turned and locked eyes with her.

‚ÄúThe only reason my daughter died is because she had a snake for a father,‚Äù I said coldly.

Her eyes bulged. ‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù she shrieked. ‚ÄúWhat the hell does that have to do with Alaric? How dare you drag his name into this! The child he has with Sabrine‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúMom!‚Äù Alaric‚Äôs voice cracked through the room like a whip. ‚ÄúMind you words.‚Äù

He came in from the kitchen, carrying a bowl of soup, steam still curling off the surface.

He set it down carefully in front of Sabrine before finally, finally looking at me with disapproving look.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt take my mother‚Äôs words to heart,‚Äù he said in a low, tense voice. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs just upset. And you‚Äîyou were out of line. You should apologize. To her. And to Sabrine.‚Äù

He looked at me seriously, as if he‚Äôd completely forgotten everything he once promised me on our wedding day‚Äîhow he swore I‚Äôd never suffer because of his family, how there‚Äôd never be another woman.

Now, it was clear. Every single one of Alaric‚Äôs promises had been a lie.

I stared at him coldly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not apologizing. And deep down, you know I‚Äôm the one who was wronged.‚Äù

Without waiting for a response, I turned and walked upstairs.

Alaric instinctively started to follow, something in him reacting. But then‚Äî

‚ÄúAlaric!‚Äù Sabrine suddenly gasped. ‚ÄúMy stomach‚Ä¶ it hurts. I think the baby got scared‚Ä¶ maybe from what Lila said.‚Äù

His steps froze. In a flash, he was back at her side, helping her up with a look of panic. He pulled out his phone and called for the doctor immediately.

Sabrine clutched his sleeve and added in a trembling voice, ‚ÄúYou should go check on Lila. I‚Äôm worried‚Ä¶ she might be really upset.‚Äù

Alaric frowned.

‚ÄúIgnore her,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs just throwing another tantrum. She‚Äôll calm down eventually.‚Äù

He lifted the soup to Sabrine‚Äôs lips, feeding her as if she were some delicate princess.

‚ÄúDrink. It‚Äôs good for the baby.‚Äù

From the bedroom doorway upstairs, I heard everything. Alaric, who now doted on Sabrine‚Äôs pregnancy, had clearly forgotten that his own wife had once carried his child too.

Heart hollow, I walked into the bedroom and quietly took down the wedding photo from the wall.

Since she wanted it so much, I‚Äôll let Sabrine own the house. And Alaric can rot with it.



Chapter 3

Laughter drifted up from the living room all afternoon. It wasn‚Äôt until nightfall that Alaric finally came upstairs.

He paused at the doorway, taken aback by how bare the room had become.

‚ÄúWhere are your stuff go?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt want them,‚Äù I said flatly.

It didn‚Äôt even register with him. If the idea of me leaving had crossed his mind, he clearly didn‚Äôt take it seriously. He just brushed it off and got straight to the point.

‚ÄúLila, you were way out of line down there,‚Äù he said, furrowing his brow. ‚ÄúMom only let Sabrine move in because she misses her grandchild. Don‚Äôt be so upset. Do it for our daughter, okay?‚Äù

I looked at him, disappointed but not surprised. He was still hiding behind the memory of a daughter he let die.

Oblivious to the shift in my gaze, he kept going.

‚ÄúBesides, Sabrine‚Äôs pregnant right now. You and her are in both carrying, why can‚Äôt you just be kind about it and let her stay?‚Äù

Bitterness burned at the back of my throat. I clenched my jaw to stop myself from screaming.

Not one person had noticed that my bump was gone.

No one even realized I‚Äôd lost the baby. Or maybe they did and just didn‚Äôt care.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want her living here,‚Äù I said through gritted teeth.

Alaric faltered. Before he could respond, Sabrine appeared at the doorway, her hand resting on her stomach, eyes already glistening with tears.

‚ÄúAlaric,‚Äù she whimpered, ‚Äúif Lila‚Äôs upset about me staying here, maybe I should just move out.‚Äù

She turned dramatically and made her exit‚Äîbut not before collapsing to the ground at the end of the hallway.

Alaric rushed toward her like she‚Äôd been shot, spinning back around to glare at me.

‚ÄúAre you happy now?!‚Äù he snapped. ‚ÄúIf anything happens to her baby, I swear I‚Äôll make you pay.‚Äù

His words were cold, but his touch on Sabrine was gentle, careful, like she was made of glass. He picked her up in his arms.

‚ÄúIf you let her move in, I‚Äôm leaving!‚Äù I shouted after him.

He didn‚Äôt stop. Didn‚Äôt even glance back.

‚ÄúGo ahead and try,‚Äù he called over his shoulder. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got nowhere to go.‚Äù

I stood frozen in place, staring at his retreating back. Then, slowly, I smiled through the tears sliding down my cheeks.

He thought I had no options left. That I was still estranged from my father, that I had nowhere else to run. That I‚Äôd be trapped with the Lingards forever.

What he didn‚Äôt know was‚ÄîI‚Äôd already applied for immigration. In six days, I‚Äôd be gone for good. I started packing. My documents. My passport. Every shred of my former life.

Before Alaric returned, I laid out the two agreements I had finalized‚Äîdivorce and resignation. The end of our marriage and the end of my ties to Lingard Dominion.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this?‚Äù he asked, casually snatching the papers from my hands.

I stiffened. My voice was barely above a whisper.

‚ÄúDocuments that need your signature.‚Äù

He looked like he was about to skim them, but instead, he softened his expression and took a step toward me‚Äîlike he was trying to calm me down.

‚ÄúLook, I know what I said earlier was harsh. I just didn‚Äôt want trouble, especially not with Sabrine and Mom watching. It‚Äôs not about taking sides, it‚Äôs about keeping peace‚Äîfor our daughter‚Äôs sake.‚Äù

He reached for my stomach, a reflexive gesture. I stepped back before he could touch me.

His brow knit tighter, mistaking my avoidance for stubbornness. He was just about to say something when his phone rang.

I caught a glimpse of the name on the screen‚ÄîSabrine.

He answered immediately. Whatever she said made his expression darken.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm on my way,‚Äù he said, then looked straight at me.

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be home tonight. She‚Äôs showing signs of a miscarriage. Probably because of all the stress you caused her.‚Äù No remorse. Just blame.

He turned to leave, but I grabbed his sleeve.

‚ÄúThe papers,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt signed.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you serious right now?‚Äù he snapped. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you worry about her even the slightest?‚Äù

I said nothing. Just stared at him, waiting.

The phone rang again. With a sharp, frustrated sigh, Alaric finally snatched the papers from the counter, scribbled his signature across both pages and hurled them at me.

The papers hit my face before fluttering to the floor.

‚ÄúThere,‚Äù he growled. ‚ÄúCan I go now?‚Äù

I gave him a small, silent nod.

And as he stormed out of the room, I watched the door close behind him with an eerie calm.

That was it.

The final thread between us had been cut.



Chapter 4

Like he said, Alaric didn‚Äôt come home that night.

Meanwhile, my phone was flooded with dozens of photos and videos from Sabrine‚Äîeach one more unbearable than the last. She made no effort to hide it. If anything, she wanted me to see it all. Every loving glance Alaric gave her. Every touch, every smile. She wanted me to know that he cared about her‚Äîthat he loved her, not me.

The fireworks I once thought he lit for me on our anniversaries?

Turns out, the glowing ‚ÄúL‚Äù he carved into the night sky wasn‚Äôt for Lila.

It was for Lowe.

Sabrine Lowe.

Every sweet moment I shared with him‚Äîevery memory I held close‚Äîhad her shadow hidden somewhere behind it.

The last video was the worst. Alaric held Sabrine close, their bodies tangled together like lovers drunk on each other.

I already knew they had a child. I knew they were intimate. But seeing it with my own eyes? It still shattered something in me. And I cried.

The next morning, I slipped into a sleek formal gown and headed to the auction house. My resignation had just been submitted, so technically, I was still his personal assistant. Normally, we would‚Äôve arrived together, walking in side by side. But today, I came alone‚Äîand had to wait for him at the entrance.

His car pulled up right on time. When he stepped out and saw me waiting there, he paused‚Äîjust briefly‚Äîbefore masking his expression and opening the rear door.

Out stepped Sabrine, dazzling in couture. Every detail of her outfit screamed luxury‚Äîhand-stitched, custom-fitted, a statement. The kind of look that cost more than a small apartment.

The Lowe Family had long since gone bankrupt. It didn‚Äôt take a genius to figure out where she got the dress from.

I stopped in my tracks.

‚ÄúWhy did you bring her?‚Äù I asked coldly.

Alaric frowned. ‚ÄúShe just wanted to see what these things are like. Don‚Äôt worry‚ÄîI‚Äôm covering her expenses. Not a dime comes out of your pocket.‚Äù

I gave a hollow smile.

Right. They were a ‚Äòcouple‚Äô now. And I was the outsider.

Alaric offered Sabrine his arm and the two of them walked past me. Sabrine was radiant, smiling at everyone like she‚Äôd already won.

I could hear the whispers as they entered.

‚ÄúWait, I didn‚Äôt know Mr. Lingard was married. Is that his wife?‚Äù

‚ÄúThen who‚Äôs that girl in the back?‚Äù One man pointed toward me.

‚ÄúOh, her? She‚Äôs his assistant. She always tags along for these events. But now that the wife‚Äôs showing up, I doubt she‚Äôll be invited again.‚Äù

I clenched my fists and swallowed the bitterness rising in my throat.

Inside, Sabrine was seated beside Alaric like it was the most natural thing in the world. I, meanwhile, was ushered to the far back‚Äîas if I was no more than staff.

I felt... nothing. Just numb.

For once, Alaric noticed. He glanced at me, frowning like he‚Äôd only just remembered I existed. He reached out slightly, as if to comfort me‚Äîbut Sabrine said something and immediately pulled his attention away. As always.

The auction began. And of course, every item Sabrine liked, Alaric raised his paddle for.

Whenever someone tried to outbid him, he doubled down. No hesitation.

Sabrine smiled sweetly, her voice honeyed. Then, to my surprise, she leaned over and kissed him. In public.

Alaric stiffened, clearly caught off guard. His first instinct was to look at me.

But I didn‚Äôt flinch. My expression didn‚Äôt change.

And that rattled him more than if I had screamed.

A few minutes later, he quietly started bidding on things I might like. A painting. A bracelet. A crystal vase. Maybe he planned to give them to me afterward. As if they would mean anything now.

Around us, the room buzzed with compliments for ‚ÄúMr. and Mrs. Lingard.‚Äù Guests fawned over Sabrine, praising her taste, her elegance, her poise.

Their voices faded into static. I didn‚Äôt care anymore.

When the auction ended, the crowd began to thin out.

I stood to leave, but before I could step away, Sabrine strutted over to me, holding a necklace she‚Äôd just won.

She wore triumph like perfume.

‚ÄúAlaric, I noticed Lila didn‚Äôt get anything today. Why don‚Äôt we give her this?‚Äù

Her voice dripped with condescension as she held it out like an offering to a beggar.

Instinct took over. I slapped her hand away. Hard.

She gasped and shrieked, clutching her wrist with tears forming fast in her eyes.

Alaric‚Äôs face darkened as he turned toward us, just about to say something‚Äîwhen chaos broke out at the door.

A group of masked men stormed the hall, surrounding us in an instant.



Chapter 5

From behind the group of masked men, a familiar face stepped into view.

Even with a hideous scar glaring on his skin, I recognized him instantly. His lips curled into a twisted smile as he looked straight at Alaric.

‚ÄúWell, well, Alaric. Long time no see. Bet you didn‚Äôt think this day would come when you destroyed my company, did you?‚Äù

Alaric‚Äôs face darkened.

That man‚Äîhe was once Alaric‚Äôs fiercest rival in the business world.

When I married into the Lingard Family and poured Anderson funds into Alaric‚Äôs crumbling empire, his company rose‚Äîand as one empire rose, another collapsed.

The one that collapsed‚Ä¶ belonged to the man with the scarred face.

Alaric‚Äôs bodyguards quickly stepped forward, shielding us behind them.

But just as I caught my breath, Sabrine shoved me‚Äîhard. On instinct, I grabbed her wrist to keep her from falling, but it was too late. In one blink, both of us were pushed outside the protective circle.

Scarface didn‚Äôt waste a second. He lunged and grabbed us both.

‚ÄúWell, aren‚Äôt I lucky today?‚Äù he sneered, tightening his grip. ‚ÄúI heard some whispers back there. One‚Äôs your wife, pregnant with your baby. The other is your personal secretary. Heard you‚Äôre quite fond of her.‚Äù

His eyes, wild with hatred, locked on Alaric.

‚ÄúRemember that day?‚Äù His eyes turned hollow, lost in a memory. ‚ÄúI knelt. I cried. I begged you for mercy. And what did you do? You ignored me like I was a stray dog in the gutter. You ended me. Drowned me in a mountain of debt.‚Äù

He blinked, snapping back to the present.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm here for that. But don‚Äôt worry‚ÄîI won‚Äôt touch your money. I don‚Äôt give a damn about that. I came for your pain.‚Äù

He let out a maniacal laugh.

‚ÄúPick one,‚Äù he said sharply. ‚ÄúYou only get to save one.‚Äù

Sabrine shrieked in terror, clutching her belly. Her eyes locked on Alaric, wide with desperation.

‚ÄúAlaric! Save me! Lila pushed me! Please, save me‚Äîand save our baby!‚Äù

Alaric closed his eyes tightly, jaw clenched.

Then, quietly, he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take her.‚Äù

Sabrine shrieked. ‚ÄúNo! No, Alaric, you can‚Äôt do that. You have to save me!‚Äù

My eyes widened, heart pounding in my chest.

If it had been before‚Äîbefore I knew the truth‚ÄîI might have believed that Alaric would choose to save me.

But now, after everything I‚Äôd uncovered, I was simply waiting for the inevitable‚Ä¶ to be left behind.

Still, despite myself, my eyes lifted toward him.

And for one wild, foolish second‚Äîmy heart dared to hope.

When I looked up... I saw him pointing at me.

Scarface grinned. ‚ÄúAre you sure about your choice? Don‚Äôt worry‚ÄîI‚Äôm a man of my word.‚Äù

He shoved Sabrine roughly toward Alaric.

Then he turned to me. That scar on his cheek twitching as he smiled wider.

‚ÄúSo this one‚Äôs the one you care about, huh? Your little secretary. And you‚Äîtwo-timer cheap man‚Äîjust tossed your pregnant wife aside like she was nothing but a rag doll.‚Äù

He let out a low, cruel chuckle. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôm feeling generous today. I‚Äôll be the good guy and let her go.‚Äù

Then he ran a hand through my hair and yanked hard, forcing my face upward.

‚ÄúBut this one‚Ä¶‚Äù his voice dropped, laced with menace, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a feeling we‚Äôre going to have a very fun time together.‚Äù

I barely had time to breathe before he slapped me, hard.

Blood filled my mouth. Alaric‚Äôs eyes flinched with guilt‚Äîbut his arms were already around Sabrine, shielding her.

And that‚Äôs when I understood.

He hadn‚Äôt chosen me out of love.

He‚Äôd chosen me as bait‚Äîbecause Scarface wanted to hurt someone Alaric cared about. And to him, that person was Sabrine. Not me.

I looked away from him, my expression turning cold.

Scarface, enraged that I wouldn‚Äôt scream, began striking me again. Over and over. My cheeks swelled, lips split.

Eventually, he motioned for his men to restrain me.

‚ÄúThis ain‚Äôt on me, sweetheart,‚Äù he hissed. ‚ÄúBlame your cold-blooded boyfriend. I‚Äôm not gonna kill you. I just wanna give him a show. Let him watch while I ruin what‚Äôs his.‚Äù

He ripped my dress open.

Alaric shouted in horror. ‚ÄúStop! Please, stop! I‚Äôll give you whatever you want‚Äîmoney, a hundred million, anything!‚Äù

But Scarface only grew more excited.

The more Alaric pleaded, the more power he felt.

I was shaking, half-naked in front of them all, helpless, struggling with everything I had‚Äîbut it wasn‚Äôt enough.

He leaned in.

And then‚Ä¶

The doors burst open. Security stormed in, guns raised. In seconds, Scarface‚Äôs men were taken down.

Alaric rushed forward, ripping off his jacket to cover me.

He wrapped it tightly around me, his voice trembling.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, Lila. I‚Äôm so sorry.‚Äù

I stared blankly ahead, not looking at him, not speaking. I just wanted to disappear.

He scooped me into his arms and started for the exit, shouting for a doctor.

But behind us, Sabrine screamed.

‚ÄúAlaric!‚Äù

We both turned. She collapsed to the floor, blood gushing beneath her.

Alaric froze.

Then, without hesitation, he dropped me.

My body hit the marble floor with a sickening thud. Something in my arm cracked sharply as pain exploded through my shoulder.

‚ÄúLila‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a matter of life and death,‚Äù he said breathlessly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still conscious. You can walk. You‚Äôll be fine. I have to get Sabrine to the hospital. Someone will come for you.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt even glance back as he lifted Sabrine into his arms and ran out.

I lay there, wrapped in his jacket, clutching it tight‚Äîyet all I felt was cold. Cold that seeped deep into my bones‚Ä¶ and froze my heart.



Chapter 6

Midnight came and went, but no one showed up to take me like Alaric had promised.

After my wounds were hastily treated at a nearby clinic, I stumbled back to the house, barely holding myself together. I scrubbed my skin raw in the shower, desperate to wash away the filth, the fear‚Ä¶ the shame.

But it didn‚Äôt work. The images from that nightmare played on repeat in my head. I didn‚Äôt sleep a second.

By the time morning light poured through the windows, I‚Äôd pulled myself together. Today was the day I picked up my immigration papers. Today, I would finally cut all ties with Alaric.

I gathered the signed divorce and resignation papers, made sure every document was in place and headed out.

But the moment I opened the front door, I came face to face with him.

Alaric stood there, face like thunder. His eyes locked onto mine‚Äîand in the next second, he raised his hand and slapped me hard across the face.

The impact sent me crashing to the ground. Pain exploded in my cheek and a sharp cry escaped my lips before I could stop it.

He froze for a heartbeat, some flicker of doubt crossing his eyes. Then came the bitterness‚Äîthe blame, the disgust.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù he growled. ‚ÄúWhy the hell would you fake something like this?‚Äù

He switched to rapid-fire accusations. ‚ÄúWhy would you team up with those people? Stage a whole kidnapping? Do you have any idea what you‚Äôve done? Sabrine lost the baby because of you!‚Äù

His voice trembled with fury.

He raised his hand again‚Äîthen stopped. His eyes scanned my bruised, bloodied skin. His fingers twitched before his arm dropped back to his side.

‚ÄúWhat do you want me to do? Huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt me!‚Äù I shouted, the words tearing out of me.

But it didn‚Äôt matter. He didn‚Äôt believe me. He didn‚Äôt want to believe me.

Alaric closed his eyes, jaw tight, then opened them with a cold finality.

‚ÄúFor now, I‚Äôll be staying by Sabrine‚Äôs side,‚Äù he said evenly, like it was some business arrangement. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make it up to her on your behalf. When she‚Äôs recovered, we‚Äôll have a wedding. A public one. She‚Äôll be named the wife of Lingard. But internally‚Ä¶‚Äù

His gaze met mine. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll still be my wife.‚Äù

I let out a quiet, bitter laugh, eyes dropping to the floor.

‚ÄúThis is what you wanted all along, isn‚Äôt it, Alaric?‚Äù

Alaric looked at me like I was the one who had betrayed him.

‚ÄúYou were the one who made the first mistake. I‚Äôm just fixing it. You‚Äôve lost a child too‚Äîshouldn‚Äôt you be able to understand her pain?‚Äù

His words sliced right through me. In that moment, the last sliver of affection I had for him died.

I looked him dead in the eyes, calm as ever and nodded. He frowned, probably expecting a fight. Maybe a breakdown. But I gave him nothing.

His phone rang. He didn‚Äôt even hesitate before turning around and leaving me there.

Ten minutes later, a new message popped up on my screen.

From Sabrine.

\[Why are you so hard to kill?\]

\[I‚Äôve done everything I could and you‚Äôre still breathing.\]

\[If you had any dignity left, you‚Äôd disappear.\]

\[Alaric‚Äôs never loved you. He doesn‚Äôt even know you lost the baby. \]

\[Isn‚Äôt that enough of a clue?\]

She followed it with photo after photo‚Äîeach one of Alaric by her side, smiling, holding her close. In each one, he looked so gentle. So soft.

So in love.

So that‚Äôs what it looked like when he actually loved someone.

I didn‚Äôt cry. I didn‚Äôt rage. I just blocked her. Then I made my final rounds. I cleared every trace of myself from Lingard house. By the time the paperwork was finalized, I no longer existed in their records. And in my hand were two official divorce certificates.

Before I left for good, I opened the cold storage unit and took out a small box‚Äîthe one that held the remains of my child.

I placed it gently on the coffee table in the living room.

Alongside it, I left the divorce papers.

And a few flash drives‚Äîeach loaded with surveillance footage and proof of everything I‚Äôd been through.

By the time he got home, I‚Äôd be gone.

I had my immigration papers. I was leaving the country. Leaving Alaric. We‚Äôd be nothing but a stranger.

1lzkk49,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lzkk49,Leith Hill - Southeast England's most Prominent Hill,"I'm going hiking in the Dolomites soon and I wanted to do a practice hill walk that was easily accessible from London. 

I found this excellent website: https://londonhiker.com/walking-trip-ideas/biggest-hill that lists the biggest hills near London, and chose to walk the recommended route up to Leith Hill from Ockley, an 8 mile loop. 

Leith Hill has a 246m drop (prominence) and walking up it was a nice little workout for the legs! On a sunny day there are clear views across the Weald of Sussex to the South Downs, and in the other direction you can see London - with a pair of binoculars you'd be able to pick out the buildings. 

The 8 mile loop was a nice walk though not signposted. The guide linked in the webpage was very clear. I only once got hollered at by a resident (there are some very posh houses you walk right past) and that was because I'd missed the public footpath by walking up the wrong side of a field, which was really my fault. Still, it reminded me why I prefer well-established signposted trails - following public footpaths past a lot of PRIVATE PROPERTY signs make me a bit anxious. 

Still I would recommend the hike, the views were lovely! At the top of the hill is a historic tower which you can pay to climb, or buy a coffee or a sausage roll to fuel your journey, which is cracking. ",4,1752494583.0,UKhiking,3,1.0,False

Then one day, in a moment of curiosity (or midlife caffeine crisis?), I decided to try something new. I picked up Blue Tokai‚Äôs French Press beans (the ground version, I‚Äôm not a grinder bro yet, calm down).

Made myself a cold coffee, French-pressed and all. Bro‚Ä¶ it hit different. Like ‚Äúwhere have you been all my life‚Äù different. It was smooth, fresh, bold felt like my tastebuds got a promotion.

Anyway, after a few days of this fancy bean romance, I decided to revisit my old flame Nescafe Gold. For nostalgia. For comfort. For old times‚Äô sake.

And guess what?

It tasted like betrayal.

Like what even is this now?? I don‚Äôt know what happened. It‚Äôs still the same Nescafe Gold Blend. But I‚Äôve changed. My tongue has known the grind. The fresh bean. The artisan roast.

Now I can‚Äôt go back. It‚Äôs like drinking memories of a past life, and not in a good way.

# Moving Fast On Rare Earth Minerals

The U.S. Department of Defense, headed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, acquired a 15% position in the¬†[MP Materials mine](https://mpmaterials.com/), located adjacent to Interstate 15 in southeast California, making it the largest single shareholder in this critical national resource. MP Materials common stock spiked 54% on July 10 following the announcement.

It has been well reported that rare earths are crucial to the wind, solar, battery, and electric vehicles industries. Less reported until recently is the fact that rare earth metals are¬†[critical elements](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2023/07/25/biden-officials-may-be-blowing-americas-shot-at-rare-earth-independence/)¬†for making high-grade magnets that go into every modern military weapons system, jets, and ships.

In addition to producing a large percentage of rare earths in its own mines, China holds a dominant position in the refining and processing of the minerals and manufacturing of the magnets from which they are made. Ongoing tensions between the two countries make America‚Äôs heavy reliance on imports of these metals via China-dominated supply chains represents a significant national security risk.

The Pentagon maintains significant stores of these minerals for its own use, but restrictions on rare earth exports invoked by China in recent months could threaten to force a depletion in those inventories. An¬†[analysis posted on June 25](https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/research/critical-minerals-sourcing-rises-trade-troubles)¬†by S&P Global notes that those restrictions ‚Äúled to a 32.1% year-over-year decline in US rare earth imports, highlighting mainland China‚Äôs dominance in supplying critical minerals.‚Äù

In addition to its status as America‚Äôs only active rare earth mining operation, MP Materials is a fully integrated operation which also refines and manufactures magnets at its California operation. MP Materials was created in 2017 to acquire and restart the Mountain Pass mining operation which was originally discovered in 1949 and was a dominant player in the global rare earth market from the 1960s into the 1990s.

According to the Science History Institute Museum and Library, production at Mountain Pass ‚Äúincreased dramatically in 1965, after the discovery that europium phosphors could be used to make a much brighter red in color television screens. The Mountain Pass Mine and the Molybdenum Corporation of America (often referred to as Molycorp) dominated world rare earth production and global exports from about 1960 until the 1990s. During the early 1990s California environmental regulators detected low-level radioactive wastewater leaking from the separation plant‚Äôs pipelines.

‚ÄúThis initiative marks a decisive action by the Trump administration to accelerate American supply chain independence,‚Äù said James Litinsky, Founder, Chairman, and CEO of MP Materials¬†[said in a release](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Announces-Transformational-Public-Private-Partnership-with-the-Department-of-Defense-to-Accelerate-U-S--Rare-Earth-Magnet-Independence/default.aspx). ‚ÄúWe are proud to enter into this transformational public-private partnership and are deeply grateful to President Trump, our partners at the Pentagon, and our employees, customers and stakeholders for their unwavering support and dedication.‚Äù

[CNBC reports](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/10/pentagon-to-become-largest-shareholder-in-rare-earth-magnet-maker-mp-materials.html)¬†that the deal between the Pentagon and MP Materials involves the DoD investing in a ‚Äúnewly created class of preferred shares convertible into MP Materials‚Äô common stock, in addition to a warrant convertible at $30.03 a share for 10 years that allows the U.S. to buy additional common stock.‚Äù The 15% share held by the Pentagon would be almost double the shares held by Litinsky (8.61%) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (8.27%)

As part of the deal, the Pentagon will guarantee a minimum price of $110 per kilogram for neodymium-praseodymium oxide (NdPr) produced at the facility for 10 years and agrees to buy 100% of the magnets manufactured by MP Materials. JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs have pledge $1 billion in financial support for the expansion of the site‚Äôs manufacturing facility.

MP Materials says it also expects to receive a loan of $150 million from the Pentagon ‚Äúin connection with its plan to expand its heavy rare earth separation capabilities at Mountain Pass.‚Äù Once improvements and expansions are completed, the MP Materials site will be the only site of its kind in the Western Hemisphere.

# Keeping A Presidential Promise on Rare Earth Minerals

Speaking at an April conference organized by the Hamm Institute in Oklahoma City, Interior Secretary¬†[Doug Burgum advocated¬†](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/24/trump-weighs-investments-in-critical-mineral-companies-burgum-says.html)for the federal government to make direct investments in critical energy resources. ‚ÄúWe should be taking some of our balance sheet and making investments,‚Äù Burgum said, adding, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre competing against state capital because China is picking these strategically as areas that they want to invest in.‚Äù

Burgum also advocated for the establishment of a U.S. sovereign wealth fund similar to those held by countries like Norway and Saudi Arabia. ‚ÄúWhy wouldn‚Äôt the wealthiest country in the world have the biggest sovereign wealth fund,‚Äù the Interior secretary said.

This bold move to enhance U.S. energy and national security by reducing U.S. dependence on China for its rare earth mineral supplies is an outcome of the vision laid out by Burgum. It also represents another example of the administration moving quickly to keep a promise made by candidate Trump during his 2024 presidential campaign.

# JULY 11th, 2025~Minerals, Magnets, and Military Capability: China‚Äôs Rare Earth Weaponization Should Be a Wake-Up Call

*(Had to repost this link from DanielD!  =)  Awesome find & thanks for sharing!!!)*

[Minerals, Magnets, and Military Capability: China‚Äôs Rare Earth Weaponization Should Be a Wake-Up Call - Modern War Institute](https://mwi.westpoint.edu/minerals-magnets-and-military-capability-chinas-rare-earth-weaponization-should-be-a-wake-up-call/)

https://preview.redd.it/foc3sae1ttcf1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e19cd00085420014085afb191585167383d0b32

When China¬†[imposed](https://www.csis.org/analysis/consequences-chinas-new-rare-earths-export-restrictions#:~:text=On%20April%204%2C%20China's%20Ministry,export%20the%20minerals%20and%20magnets.)¬†export controls on seven of the seventeen rare earth elements in April 2025, it wasn‚Äôt just a trade policy tweak‚Äîit was a shot across the bow of the US defense industrial base. American fighter jets, satellites, guided missiles, and submarines all rely on high-performance¬†[magnets built with rare earths](https://www.army.mil/article/227715/an_elemental_issue)¬†like neodymium, samarium, and dysprosium. This blocking action by China followed earlier prohibitions on¬†[gallium and germanium](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-bans-exports-gallium-germanium-antimony-us-2024-12-03/), which are foundational to infrared optics and radar systems. These materials are overwhelmingly Chinese controlled, processed, and manufactured‚Äîand American reliance on foreign minerals and rare earths exposes critical vulnerabilities.

China¬†[refines](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/chinas-rare-earth-export-strategy-global-supply-2025/)¬†over 85 percent of the world‚Äôs rare earths and¬†[produces](https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2023/2/10/us-begins-forging-rare-earth-supply-chain)¬†nearly 90 percent of high-performance rare earth magnets. That means US weapon systems, from F-35s and Virginia-class submarines to hypersonic weapon systems and precision-guided munitions, are all critically dependent on materials from strategic rivals. Exotic minerals are no longer just for the¬†[green revolution](https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2022/who-controls-worlds-minerals-needed-green-energy); this is about the United States and its allies having the raw materials needed to sustain a future war.

What began as a commercial pressure tactic has escalated into a strategic stress test of the US defense industrial base. American defense firms are already¬†[reporting](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/chinas-rare-earth-squeeze-puts-defense-giants-in-the-crosshairs.html)¬†procurement delays, while¬†[companies](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/some-european-auto-supplier-plants-shut-down-after-chinas-rare-earth-curbs-2025-06-04/)¬†like General Motors are¬†[scrambling](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/auto-companies-in-full-panic-over-rare-earths-bottleneck-2025-06-09/)¬†to source non-Chinese magnets to avoid broader industrial paralysis. Just weeks after the April restrictions took effect, multiple defense suppliers‚Äî[including](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/chinas-rare-earth-squeeze-puts-defense-giants-in-the-crosshairs.htm)¬†subcontractors for radar and propulsion systems‚Äîreported slowdowns and sourcing complications, signaling an era of Chinese weaponization of materials. While the civilian economy may appear¬†[resilient](https://harris-sliwoski.com/chinalawblog/protect-your-business-by-reducing-your-china-risks/)¬†to substitution; the defense sector is not.

To counter this critical vulnerability, the United States must act decisively with a three-pronged strategy: (1) revitalize the National Defense Stockpile with ready-to-use materials, (2) accelerate domestic magnet manufacturing through bold market incentives, and (3) forge binding partnerships with trusted allies. Only through such measures can America safeguard its military readiness against China‚Äôs strategic chokehold.

**The National Defense Stockpile, Restocked**

The United States once took strategic material stockpiling seriously. At its Cold War peak, the National Defense Stockpile¬†[held](https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/18789/us-strategic-minerals)¬†an inflation-adjusted $42 billion in critical reserves. Today, it is¬†[valued](https://www.thefai.org/posts/america-should-rebuild-the-national-defense-stockpile?utm_source=chatgpt.com)¬†under $1 billion and lacks usable quantities of the rare earth materials needed for rapid defense production.

Stockpiling raw ore isn‚Äôt enough. The Department of Defense needs finished or near-finished materials‚Äîespecially neodymium-iron-boron and samarium-cobalt magnets‚Äîthat can be directly integrated into weapons systems. Holding unrefined oxides does nothing for a defense contractor trying to build an F-35 or a hypersonic glide vehicle.

Congress must authorize an immediate strategic restocking initiative focused not just on bulk commodities but on specific components tied to operational readiness. This means finished magnets, sensor-grade alloys, and defense-critical components, all backed by scenario-based planning and annual audits.

A recent¬†[Government Accountability Office report](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-24-106959.pdf)¬†estimated the cost to fix these gaps at $18.5 billion. That amount is a fraction of the Pentagon‚Äôs budget but a potential game changer for insulating the military from Chinese leverage.

**Magnets Made in America**

The Pentagon has taken¬†[initial steps](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3700059/dod-looks-to-establish-mine-to-magnet-supply-chain-for-rare-earth-materials/)¬†to fund rare earth production, backing companies like¬†[Lynas](https://www.businessdefense.gov/news/2023/DoD-Awards-Key-Contract-for-Domestic-Heavy-Rare-Earth-Separation-Capability.html)¬†and¬†[MP Materials](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/2941793/dod-awards-35-million-to-mp-materials-to-build-us-heavy-rare-earth-separation-c/)¬†through the Defense Production Act. But the pace is glacial. China‚Äôs restrictions are already here; the US supply chain won‚Äôt be fully stood up¬†[until 2027](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3700059/dod-looks-to-establish-mine-to-magnet-supply-chain-for-rare-earth-materials/)¬†at the earliest‚Äîif ever.

That timeline is unacceptable. Congress must move faster, and more aggressively, by unleashing market incentives that match the threat‚Äôs urgency. The most effective first step? A production tax credit for each kilogram of defense-grade magnet material produced domestically. This¬†[approach revived](https://source.benchmarkminerals.com/article/us-battery-production-could-beat-china-on-cost-due-to-ira-tax-credits)¬†the US semiconductor and battery industries, and it would boost magnet production. A fully integrated US rare earth supply chain is¬†[achievable](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/america-fast-track-critical-metals-145700744.html?guccounter=1)¬†with sustained government and private-sector commitment.

Second, federal law must establish fast-track permitting for rare earth mining, refining, and magnet fabrication. Fully funded projects can¬†[languish](https://warontherocks.com/2025/04/a-federal-critical-mineral-processing-initiative-securing-u-s-mineral-independence-from-china/)¬†for years in permitting limbo. Strategic infrastructure deserves strategic exemptions. Without domestic production, strategic competitors like China can more easily weaponize global supply chains against the American economy and defense manufacturing.

Finally, the Department of Defense must initiate¬†[multiyear offtake agreements](https://blog.workday.com/en-us/maximizing-our-climate-impact-through-multi-year-offtake-agreements.html)¬†with domestic magnet producers. These guaranteed contracts would derisk private investment, enabling companies to raise capital and build capacity without betting against Chinese state subsidies. If the United States wants a resilient supply chain, it needs to put real skin in the game‚Äînot just more memos and grants.

A transformational multibillion-dollar public-private partnership between the Department of Defense and MP Materials was¬†[announced](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Announces-Transformational-Public-Private-Partnership-with-the-Department-of-Defense-to-Accelerate-U-S--Rare-Earth-Magnet-Independence/default.aspx)¬†on July 10 marking the Pentagon‚Äôs most significant move to date. This comprehensive agreement includes substantial equity investments, loans, a ten-year price floor commitment, and an exclusive ten-year magnet offtake arrangement, dramatically accelerating America‚Äôs push toward rare earth magnet independence. This is precisely the type of action the United States needs.

**Strategic Cooperation with Trusted Allies**

Allied collaboration is necessary, but not sufficient. Current efforts like the¬†[Minerals Security Partnership](https://www.state.gov/minerals-security-partnership)¬†are well-intentioned but nonbinding. Most allied agreements are built on goodwill, not enforcement. That must change.

The United States should move toward coproduction requirements for all joint defense programs‚Äîespecially those involving radars, guidance systems, and propulsion units. These clauses must mandate that essential components be sourced exclusively from trusted, non-Chinese supply chains. And additional funding must be allocated to ensure sourcing domestically and abroad from trusted allies and partners.

In the Indo-Pacific, this means expanding rare earth refining deals with¬†[Australia](https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-strikes-deal-restore-rare-earths-access#:~:text=Australia%20will%20be%20an%20important,oxides%20between%202025%20and%202027.)¬†and¬†[Japan](https://www.mining.com/japan-proposes-rare-earth-cooperation-with-us-in-trade-talks/)¬†into comprehensive production partnerships with clear timelines, cost-sharing, and integration into US procurement pipelines. Rare earth cooperation should no longer be siloed in energy or industry ministries; it must become a core function of allied defense planning.

The United States should also use frameworks like the¬†[QUAD](https://thediplomat.com/2024/07/building-resilient-critical-minerals-supply-chains-for-the-quad/)¬†and the¬†[D-10](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/programs/scowcroft-center-for-strategy-and-security/global-strategy-initiative/democratic-order-initiative/d-10-strategy-forum/)¬†to establish enforceable standards for rare earth traceability, magnet quality, and export controls. This would help close loopholes that allow Chinese-origin materials to enter US defense supply chains indirectly‚Äîparticularly through third-party vendors or poorly screened global suppliers. While China has¬†[begun restricting](https://sanctionsnews.bakermckenzie.com/china-published-implementing-regulations-under-the-export-control-law/)¬†the transfer of certain rare earths by foreign firms, its intent is to control chokepoints, not to ensure transparency. By contrast, US-led frameworks should aim to reduce strategic dependency by ensuring all critical components are sourced from trusted and verifiable supply chains.

Fortunately, Congress is¬†[already stepping up](https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2025/06/12/house-proposes-manufacturing-network-to-boost-wartime-arms-production/): the House‚Äôs proposed Commercial Reserve Manufacturing Network would mobilize dual-use commercial firms into wartime capacity. Embedding rare earth magnet production into that framework could enable rapid conversion of civilian capacity into military readiness. This would ensure the defense base can surge supply and sustain the US military in the next war.

**Anticipating and Answering the Critics**

Some might argue that establishing new magnet production facilities in the United States is too expensive, but the cost of strategic dependency is far greater. A single Virginia-class submarine contains¬†[about 9,200 pounds](https://warontherocks.com/2023/09/the-u-s-government-should-stockpile-more-critical-minerals/)¬†of rare earths and making an F-35 requires¬†[more than 900 pounds](https://www.csis.org/analysis/consequences-chinas-new-rare-earths-export-restrictions)¬†of rare earths. A supply chain failure could destabilize procurement, derail billions in defense investments, and undermine joint force readiness.

Other critics might say that American allies can pick up the slack. In theory, this is plausible‚Äîbut in practice, countries like¬†[Australia still send raw materials](https://mine.nridigital.com/mine_australia_oct24/china-australia-trade-2024)¬†to China for processing. Without deep investment in allied refining and fabrication, these relationships remain symbolic rather than strategically functional. And knowing how China has demonstrated a penchant for weaponizing supply chains, there is no doubt Beijing would weaponize mineral and rare earth supply chains in a crisis or conflict. Given that¬†[unclassified war games](https://features.csis.org/preparing-the-US-industrial-base-to-deter-conflict-with-China/)¬†indicate the US military would run out of many munitions within a week in the event of a Taiwan Strait conflict, a lack of access to minerals and rare earths would make it exponentially more expensive and difficult for¬†[defense firms](https://www.defensenews.com/industry/2023/01/23/us-defense-industry-unprepared-for-a-china-fight-says-report/)¬†to produce new weapons and munitions at a sustainable rate.

Still others point to¬†[permitting delays and regulatory hurdles](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-106395). These excuses are no longer tolerable when a rival is actively attempting to stymie the supply of critical minerals and materials to the United States. If Congress can¬†[pass legislation](https://scottpeters.house.gov/2024/9/rep-peters-bill-to-speed-up-chips-act-investments-passes-congress-heads-to-president-s-desk)¬†to fast-track microchip factories, it can do the same for the magnets and other materials that make radars track, fighter jets fly, and missiles strike.

**A Test of Strategic Maturity**

China‚Äôs rare earth export controls are a calculated move in¬†[its strategy of unrestricted warfare](https://warontherocks.com/2016/04/a-new-generation-of-unrestricted-warfare/), leveraging and weaponizing global supply chains to Beijing‚Äôs advantage. This geopolitical warning demands attention: It tests America‚Äôs industrial resilience and strategic resolve to address the immediate problem of acquiring minerals needed for weapon systems. Access to rare earth magnets and exotic minerals underpins the American economy, innovation, and modern warfighting. Every F-35, missile battery, satellite constellation, and network-centric kill chain depends on them. Without urgent action, the United States risks losing strategic advantages on the battlefield and in its factories.

The question is whether America will heed this warning and act decisively‚Äîrestocking stockpiles, rebuilding domestic production, and forging ironclad allied partnerships‚Äîor let a factory-floor vulnerability become its next strategic defeat.

I was talking to one of my friends a bit ago, and he mentioned making a post like this and getting a good few replies, so I figured I'd give it a good shot.

I'm a 21-year-old Bloomington native. I went to The Academy of Science and Entrepreneurship (class of 2022), and I'm a current Ivy Tech student completing my Associate of Arts degree (focusing on philosophy and testing out Psych, PoliSci, and Legal Studies). I am in Phi Theta Kappa and the current Student Government Treasurer for the 2025-2026 academic year.

I struggle to single out things that interest me greatly because I try to always be happy with anything I do. I don't turn down many hobbies.

Most often, I play video games -- everything from Marvel Rivals to Deltarune. I work out 2-3 days a week with my friend on strength training. I played basketball for a few years, but I was just a big post guy (who never got much bigger), not really all that athletic.

Really, I'm just looking to meet people. I'm an only child, so my social skills were a bit lacking growing up. In middle and high school, I opened up a decent bit and took some pride in being a good PR/general funny man, but in more private settings, I struggle quite a bit.

My schedule gets a bit hectic, but I'd love to meet some folks and make some new friends. No vehicle at this time, but when scholarships hit, I can Uber to events!

If anyone is down to work out, play some games, have some coffee, whatever, feel free to reach out to me! I can DM you my Discord handle or converse here!

Not really sure if I should put anything else down, so I will just end off by saying I hope everyone is having a great Summer and finding infinite joy.

1lzkbpu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lzkbpu,My and My Wife‚Äôs Custom Wedding Set,"Hey all! I wanted to show you my and my wife‚Äôs wedding bands that I custom designed. We have been married for a year now and I haven‚Äôt gotten to relieve the story of telling the deeper meaning of the rings, so here goes (wait for me as I build themes cause I have to explain a fair amount of context):

Her Engagement Band (photos 1-3): I‚Äôve always been very poetic so I wrote a lot of poetry when I was dating my wife. We both had an app called ‚ÄúWaffle‚Äù where you can share a poetry journal. So, obviously, I wanted my ring to reflect our poetry. Warren Jewellers was able to help me do that. The stones included in the ring are diamond, pearl, and garnet. I picked the garnet because that is her birth month stone (January) and because the stone is red. I picked the pearl because my birthstone is either diamond or pearl (June), her favorite gemstone is Pearl, and because it is white. The diamonds were added for flair and continently could also be my birthstone. 
The significance of red and white describes the kind of love that needed re-written for both of us. I needed caring love (white heart love) re-written due to bad experiences I had in the past. and she needed passionately loving love (red heart love) re-written from bad experiences she had in the past. Also, the nostalgic tie in is that I had a hideous red coat when we met in the wintertime and she had a nice white coat and I saw (in recalling it) that we were wearing the love we needed to show each other. 
The other significance of the red stone that is seated in the rose (center flower) ties in to a poem I wrote for her talking about how most people are looking for a ‚Äúrose without thorns‚Äù relationship where they want all the love and no problems. Important context for later, there is a rose she gave to me in 2022 on Valentine‚Äôs Day that used to sit on my dash board that the thorns had been cut off of and I also used this as a tie in for that poem since we broke up for a time shortly after that. So I talked to her through the poem saying I was invested through it all (this was after the break we had in our dating relationship, it was a re-commitment to her). 
The band shape, which is a triple braided cord, is a reference to Ecclesiastes 4:12 which states ‚Äúa chord or three strands is not easily broken‚Äù. This Bible verse talks about the importance of including God in your marriage so that you can make it until the end together, and it really spoke to me and my wife as we date and later got married (to the point where we had a ‚Äútying of the chords‚Äù ceremony at our wedding). 

Her Engagement Band (pictures 4-7): I wanted to give her a simple wedding band since she really doesn‚Äôt like big rings, she likes dainty ones. So I designed this one to go along with her engagement band. Originally, it was just going to be a blank gold peak with no gemstone but when I was out shopping while we were planning our wedding, I was working things our getting a replacement car for us and found a gemstone on the floor of the car dealership haha. I later tested it with a jewelry and appraiser and they said it was a diamond! My wife thought it would be fun if we added this to her wedding band so we did that. 

My Wedding Band (pictures 8-10): I worked with Rustic and Main for my wedding band. There have a customizable band option where you can send in three items and they will set them in the ring with resin over top. The three items reflect the colors from her ring (white, red, and now brown also). The significance of brown is ‚Äúroots love‚Äù, or the love it takes to want to start a life/family with someone. Long term commitment. The brown in my ring are ground coffee beans from Orion coffee where we had our for date at (Breakfast Brew to be specific which I think is very cute ). The red in my ring is crushed petals from the dried rose that I mentioned before with some gold flaked in. Lastly, the white in my ring is left over fabric from her wedding dress. 


Understandable TL;DR - my and my wife‚Äôs rings are very symbolic to us and not everyone likes to sit through the whole understanding as to why it is that way for us. I hope you guys find something you can relate to and have enjoyed this story. 

P.S. the ring company, Warren Jewellers, liked her engagement ring design so much that they made a showcase post about it on their social media and also added a simpler rose design to their base selections for their custom ring creator :):)

## key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of a water filter for arsenic removal depends on several key features and technologies. Understanding these aspects is essential for selecting the right filter for your specific needs.

**Filter Media:** The type of filter media used is the most critical factor in arsenic removal. Common media include activated alumina, ion exchange resins, and reverse osmosis membranes. Each type has different strengths and weaknesses in terms of arsenic removal efficiency, flow rate, and maintenance requirements.

Activated alumina is a popular adsorbent media that effectively removes both arsenic(III) and arsenic(V). it works by attracting arsenic ions to its surface. Ion exchange resins are another effective option, particularly for arsenic(V). These resins exchange arsenic ions with other less harmful ions in the water. Reverse osmosis membranes are highly effective at removing a wide range of contaminants,including arsenic,by forcing water through a semi-permeable membrane.

**Arsenic Removal Efficiency:** This metric indicates the percentage of arsenic that the filter can remove from the water. A higher removal efficiency means cleaner, safer water.look for filters that are certified by autonomous organizations like NSF International to ensure their claims are accurate.

Ideally, a filter should remove at least 95% of arsenic to be considered effective.Some advanced filters can achieve removal rates of 99% or higher. It's important to note that removal efficiency can vary depending on the initial arsenic concentration in the water and the filter's lifespan.

**Flow Rate:** The flow rate determines how quickly the filter can deliver purified water. A higher flow rate is desirable for households that use a lot of water or need to fill large containers quickly.

Consider the number of peopel in your household and your daily water usage when selecting a filter with an appropriate flow rate. Point-of-use filters, like faucet filters, typically have lower flow rates than whole-house filters. Make sure the flow rate meets your needs to avoid waiting long periods for filtered water.

**Filter Lifespan and Maintenance:** The lifespan of the filter cartridge determines how often it needs to be replaced. Longer filter lifespans reduce the frequency of maintenance and lower the overall cost of ownership.

Factor in the cost of replacement filters when evaluating the overall cost of a water filter. Some filters have longer lifespans but higher replacement costs, while others offer shorter lifespans with more affordable replacements. Regular maintenance, such as flushing the filter, may also be required to maintain optimal performance.**Certification:** Look for water filters that are certified by reputable organizations such as NSF International or the Water Quality Association (WQA). Certification ensures that the filter has been independently tested and meets established performance standards.

NSF International certification is particularly important for arsenic removal.NSF/ANSI standard 53 for drinking water treatment units specifically addresses arsenic reduction. Choosing a certified filter provides assurance that it will effectively remove arsenic from your water.

On the day that Charles Sullivan proposed to Chloe Jensen, he worried that I'd cause a scene, so he had someone lock me in a closet for a full day and night.

He spoke softly, ""Chloe, don't worry. On such a special day, I won't let Sylvia ruin this for us‚Äînot today, not ever.""

All their friends cheered for them‚Äîafter all, everyone knew Sylvia Chapman was obsessed with Charles and couldn't stand any other woman coming near him.

But Charles didn't know Chloe had livestreamed the whole thing, and I watched every second of it, curled up in the closet.

What he also didn't know was that I couldn't care less about his proposal.

Because I had married someone else.

Later, I dumped every last trace of Charles into the trash right in front of him.

Staring at his face twisted with rage, I left him with a few words. ""You're pathetic.""

\*\*\*\*\*

I rushed into the private room with cold medicine in hand.

The atmosphere was electric.

But not in a good way. They were laughing at me.

The jeering went on for several minutes.

Then, Chloe pulled herself out of Charles' arms and took the medicine from my hand with a polite smile.

She said softly, ""I just got a little dizzy from the wind. There weren't any delivery guys available so late, and Charles was really worried about me. Sorry to trouble you, Miss Chapman.""

One of the crowd laughed at me. ""It's really pouring out there‚Äîlook at her, she's soaked.""

I heard someone snicker.

Some sneered, ""Just like a yes-man.""

Their mocking gazes burned into me. I shivered from the cold but didn't move.

Charles sat in the center of the crowd, completely oblivious to my misery.

Charles finally opened his mouth. ""Sylvia, consider this a lesson.""

He pulled Chloe back into his arms and warned coldly, ""I love Chloe. If I know you give her a hard time again just because you think my grandma likes you, don't blame me when I cut off your ties with my family.""

My voice came out hoarse. ""You told me I meant the world to you.""

""My grandma thinks you're important.

""She's old. I just didn't want to upset her.""

""And three years ago? When you said you would take care of me for the rest of my life?""

Charles' eyes turned icy, his voice dripping with impatience.

""So what?

""Did I ever say I loved you?""

This was absurd.

So absurd that I actually laughed.

I scanned the crowd, taking in their faces, before finally settling on Charles.

""No, you never said you loved me.

""But all these years‚Äîyou held me, kissed me, chased away every man who ever showed interest in me, and even said something about taking care of me.

""How do you explain that?""

Charles laced his fingers with Chloe's.

""Holding you? Because you were like a sister to me. That kiss? I was drunk and mistook you for someone else. As for those men, they were merely my business rivals.

""Back then, I treated you as my sister. I would surely look out for you. But now, you've crossed the line.

""Chloe is my everything. I'll be with her forever.

""So stop playing your little games with the woman I love. It's disgusting.""

He was so protective of Chloe.

Chloe buried her face in his chest, blushing. ""Stop it, Charles...""

Then, they kissed, just like some fairytale couple celebrating their victory.

The crowd around them erupted in cheers.

And I stood at the doorway, like a villainess, utterly defeated.

Charles laid the truth bare and shattered every fantasy I had.

Each word landed like hammer blows, crushing the image of the man I had once believed in.

The truth hit me like thunder.

None of what I believed had ever been real.

\*\*\*\*\*

It had been over a month since I last saw Charles.

Rumors said Charles took Chloe to meet his family.

And he told her to move into his villa at Golden Leaf.

My mind went blank for a moment when I heard the news.

That was his house‚Äîbefore Chloe, I was the only one who had ever been allowed inside.

That day, Charles had lost a big deal and been drinking.

And just then, the power went out.

I tried to help him to bed.

But then, Charles suddenly pulled me into his arms, his lips brushing against my cheek.

My heart raced with this intimacy.

If it weren't for that moment, how could I have ever believed I was even a little bit special to Charles?

# Chapter 2

Like I used to do, I would have thrown a fit in front of Mary Sullivan, demanding Charles get away from any woman who got close to him.

But now, I couldn't care less.

I was swamped with work.

I wasn't just adored by Mary‚ÄîI was also the sole heiress of the Chapman family.

Fresh out of college, I was gearing up to take over my family business, drowning in work.

One particular deal required my full attention, so I arranged to meet the clients in a private room with the files.

Little did I expect to run into someone I knew all too well.

Chloe interrogated me. ""Sylvia, are you doing this on purpose?""

Chloe sat among several business partners in a professional skirt suit with a slit up to her thighs.

I frowned, ""Are you talking to me?""

Then, Chloe burst into tears right in front of everyone.

""I'm not lucky enough to live next door to the Sullivans or win Mrs. Sullivan's affection as easily as you do. But is it my fault that Charles loves me?

""Now you're even trying to steal my clients? Are you that scared I'll outshine you in both love life and career?""

The Sullivan family was influential. The clients instantly understood that Chloe was Charles' woman.

I tightened my grip on the files. Obviously, this deal was dead in the water.

But Chloe wasn't finished. ""Charles told me how you've tried every trick to chase away his admirers over the years.

""Loving someone who doesn't love you back is truly painful, but you can't force things. And that doesn't give you the right to take it out on other girls.

""Sylvia, are you really this vicious? Stealing my clients just to make Mrs. Sullivan think I'm useless?""

I was not a pushover.

Without hesitation, I hit the record button on my phone. ""Slander is illegal, Miss Jensen. Care to repeat that?""

To my shock, Chloe walked up to me and slapped herself.

""There, Sylvia. Happy now?

""You can have my clients. And you can do whatever you want to me, but Charles... I love him.""

I was struck dumb, instinctively stepping back.

Then the door was kicked open as Charles stormed in, his face twisted with fury.

""Sylvia, what do you think you're doing?"" he shouted.

A shadow loomed over me, and the next instant, Charles' hand struck my face with brutal force.

My vision blacked out‚Äîhalf my face turned numb.

I crumpled against the chair by the blow. Drinks from the table splashed all over me.

""Charles? What are you doing here? It's not what you think‚Äî"" asked Chloe.

""She did lay a hand on you!"" Charles cut her off.

Charles cupped Chloe's face, where a faint mark barely showed.

The hand he had hit me with was even redder than the mark on Chloe's face.

But when Charles looked at me, there was nothing but disgust in his eyes.

He glared at me. ""If you don't want my grandma to hate you, apologize to Chloe.""

""Charles‚Äî"" I tried to defend myself but failed.

""Now! And beg for Chloe's forgiveness!""

Chloe buried her face in Charles' shoulder, her body trembling with soft sobs.

My face was badly swollen, and my waist throbbed where I'd slammed into the edge of the table.

Everyone in that room knew full well that I hadn't laid a finger on Chloe.

But no one would go up against Charles in the middle of his heroic rescue.

And Charles couldn't wait to ""sentence me to death"".

I met Charles' gaze with a mocking smile.

""Fine.""

Charles froze for a second.

Then his eyes darkened.

""What about your family business? You don't care about that, too?""

Charles even thought about ending years of business partnerships for his girl and threatened me with it.

Clutching my throbbing waist, I pushed myself up and met Charles' gaze head-on.

""You can say that.""

And I was also done with him.

Charles frowned under the intensity of my gaze.

But then, Chloe's honeyed voice murmured in Charles' ear.

Chloe persuaded him. ""Let's forget about it, Charles. Miss Chapman has her pride. I won't hold it against her.""

Just like that, Charles brushed aside all his doubts and scooped Chloe up in his arms, as if she were something delicate.

Then, he added, ""Sylvia, don't think your compromises will change anything between us.

""Hurting Chloe only makes me hate you more.

""And don't even think about telling my grandma about this.

""Now, I know exactly what I want.""

With that, Charles carried his beloved out in triumph.

The clients also left after that.

I started to drink all alone.

Until I vomited my guts out.

I got drunk and then sobered up.

This was how I punished myself for a decade of foolish devotion.

And after tonight?

The rotten seed that had taken root in my heart would be uprooted once and for all.

Charles, a man who knew what he truly wanted, started to make good on his threats.

His revenge against my family and me had begun.

He severed all business ties with the Chapman Group and introduced all his business partners to Chloe's barely month-old startup.

Chloe started making frequent public appearances with Charles.

He officially claimed her as his girlfriend.

I had no interest in those things, but people made sure I heard them anyway.

Back then, Charles would take me to formal events with an annoyed look.

He just needed a presentable and obedient companion.

And I let myself entertain foolish hopes just because of that ""privilege"".

Charles never explained it, but I convinced myself there was something real between us.

That was why I'd felt so jealous whenever another woman was around Charles.

And Charles never once corrected me.

But now, everything about them was just gossip to me.

I took a sip of my coffee‚Äîbitter, yet bracing.

The man sitting across from me chuckled.

He suggested, ""I did warn you, Miss Chapman‚Äîcoffee isn't really your thing. Let's get you some juice instead.

""So, maybe reconsider my proposal?

""We'd make a good match.""

# Chapter 3

My parents had me late in life‚Äîmy mother was already forty when I was born.

Mary and my mother were close friends despite their age difference, and our families had been neighbors for two generations.

Charles' parents were always jet-setting for business until a plane crash took their lives.

As a result, Mary came out of retirement to take over the Sullivan Group.

And Charles was often left in my parents' care.

That was how we grew up together.

One day, Mary said she would take me as her own, though deep down, what she truly hoped for was that I'd become her granddaughter-in-law.

My parents, however, had never been fully on board with the idea.

Charles was a typical ""left-behind"" child‚Äîproud and sensitive with strong self-esteem since young.

Losing both his parents only made it worse.

But back then, I was so head over heels for him that my parents bit their tongues.

Now, Charles openly targeted my family, and they couldn't ignore it.

Father scoffed, ""I knew he was trouble!""

I thought they would be angry, but instead, they seemed relieved.

Mother added, ""There are plenty of fish in the sea. If he's not the one, just dump him.""

I didn't mention the slap from Charles.

If my father had known it, he would've confronted Charles and knocked that brat's teeth out.

Not that I cared about Charles‚ÄîI just didn't want my father to get too worked up at nearly seventy.

Mother made a secretive call in her room, then came out with a grin.

She said, ""Syl, there's something we have been keeping from you.

""You have a fianc√©, in Strico.""

My breath caught. ""What?""

""You were head over heels for Charles, so we put it on hold.""

My parents' faces lit up when they were talking about my fianc√©. They'd never shown that look to Charles.

Honestly, marriage was the last thing on my mind.

But I knew‚Äîeven though my parents never mentioned it‚Äîthe group had taken a hit from Charles' targeted attacks.

And apparently, my fianc√© came from money.

My parents weren't trying to push me into marriage‚Äîthey always put my happiness first.

But they were getting old.

They had given me everything. I couldn't let our family group go under on my watch.

The business circle in Maris was all waiting for my downfall.

After all, I'd been the only woman by Charles' side for years.

They all expected our wedding‚Äîuntil Chloe came along.

Now they also wanted me to go broke.

I wouldn't give them the satisfaction.

My parents' praises for that fianc√© hit me.

I used to think I'd never want anyone but Charles.

But here I was.

I sat here, talking about marriage with someone else.

That was when I realized things were just okay.

My world didn't collapse over Charles.

Life went on.

Love could be a long thing.

But falling out of love with Charles only took a heartbeat.

\*\*\*\*\*

Megan Sullivan stormed into my office.

She shouted, ""Charles is proposing to Chloe. What are you doing?""

What was I doing?

I looked down at the lunchbox in my hands while the voice continued through the phone.

The flight from Strico to Maris took two and a half hours.

I was confused. ""So you had this lunchbox sent to me just because you thought it tasted good?""

When I found out Julian Russell was my fianc√©, no one would know how shocked I was.

The Russells in Strico only made my family look like a small fry.

I'd heard of Julian long before I ever met him, but most stories painted him as a ruthless businessman.

But the man I met‚Äîclassic tycoon looks, yet with a warm smile‚Äîflashed through my mind.

The two images didn't quite match.

And Megan kept yelling, ""Lunchbox? Who are you even calling at a time like this? Forget about food.""

Megan was shouting at the top of her lungs, so I leaned back slightly.

Julian's deep voice came through the phone.

""Got it, my fianc√©e. Next time, I'll deliver it personally,"" he offered.

His words somehow made my ears burn.

""That's not what I mean.""

""I heard some noise. Need my help?""

""No. I'll call you back.""

# Chapter 4

I talked to Julian about my past.

My complicated ties with the Sullivans, my decade-long unrequited love for Charles.

And the real reason I agreed to meet him was because my group needed his financial backing.

Julian didn't even bat an eye.

Instead, he analyzed market trends, advised the Chapman Group to pivot its business, offered an investment, and even produced a business plan.

All on one condition‚Äîour engagement stood.

I really had no reason to refuse.

So he had another formal dinner with my parents.

Then, our engagement was official.

He seemed to be a natural at charming the elderly.

My mother already saw him as part of the family. Even my father's white beard seemed to darken with joy.

But I wanted no public announcement about our engagement until the group was back on track.

Julian agreed.

Before Julian left Maris, he clasped a necklace around my neck.

It was a simple chain with a rose pendant, a design unfamiliar to me, as an engagement gift.

I hung up the phone.

Megan dropped into the chair across from me.

She started, ""Sylvia, tomorrow at 8 PM sharp‚ÄîCharles is proposing on the Sullivan Group rooftop. Don't say I didn't give you a heads-up.""

A casual remark from me. ""I see.""

""So what's your plan? Fake a suicide to get Charles out of there, or ask for my grandma's help?""

""Now, I'm clocking out.""

""That's my girl. Leaving early to get ready. I'm telling you. This is serious.""

""Get ready for what?""

I met Megan's gaze without flinching.

""Megan, are you egging on an outsider to fake a suicide just to ruin your cousin's proposal?

""You hate him that much?""

Megan paused, finally realizing something was off about me. ""Sylvia, have you lost your mind because of Charles?

""I know you're just playing hard to get to catch Charles' attention, but once he's engaged, it's over.""

""Then I wish him a happy marriage.""

Megan nearly jumped out of her seat. ""Keep telling yourself that!

""Anyway, I told you about this. Your call whether you show up or not.""

I scoffed and reached for the office phone.

Megan thought I'd finally come to my senses, wearing that smug look.

I picked up the phone. ""Send two security guards to my office. If you let Megan in again, you're fired.""

""Sylvia!"" Megan shrieked.

\*\*\*\*\*

Charles had downed an entire bottle of red wine tonight.

The living room buzzed with activity.

Charles' friends were busy setting up for his proposal to Chloe.

Megan stormed in.

Charles knew exactly where she had been.

Yet, he hadn't stopped her.

Lately, he'd been a bit obsessed with Chloe, but Sylvia just had to anger him.

So if Sylvia came to make a scene tomorrow, he'd just do as she said.

After all, this whole proposal was meant for her anyway.

And proposed to Chloe? No way.

Chloe was always at her most obedient when she thought she had him hooked.

But once she got too docile, she was no different from any other woman.

But Sylvia knew what to do.

Sylvia might complain to his grandma or have Megan threaten those women.

Either way, those troubles just vanished without a trace.

She saved him a lot of headaches.

Charles was surprised Megan came back so soon.

Normally, she and Sylvia would spend hours scheming how to ruin the proposal.

After days of silence, he knew Sylvia would beg through tears for him not to fall for someone else.

Megan snickered, ""Charles, Sylvia totally lost her temper. You really carried her off her feet.

""If Sylvia really tries to ruin your proposal by pulling the suicide stunt? Would you actually fall for that?""

One of Charles' friends seemed shocked. ""So that's why Sylvia has not shown up for a month. She's been planning something big.

""Man, only you could drive a girl to suicide over love.""

Charles set down his glass, feeling things were getting tricky.

If Sylvia hurt herself, his grandma would freeze his accounts again.

It'd been this way since they were kids.

If Sylvia cried, it was his fault.

As if she were related by blood.

Charles was just about to open his mouth.

Then someone muttered, ""But, didn't the Chapmans recently put the word about an engagement out?""

Megan rolled her eyes.

""Hasn't Sylvia already tried this trick? Spreading rumors about getting engaged to Charles to pressure him into playing along. Now she's using it again?"" Megan sneered.

The guy scratched his head, struggling to recall. ""Was it... Charles?""

""Enough,"" Charles cut him off.

Same old Sylvia, an idiot who was infatuated with him.

Before he finished his words, someone pressed against the floor-to-ceiling window and called out excitedly.

One of them shouted, ""Look! It's Sylvia. She's downstairs! She's coming in!

""This is gonna be fun.""

Charles frowned.

Too early. He had a candlelit dinner planned with Chloe tonight.

One last fling before dumping her tomorrow.

His voice turned icy.

He demanded, ""Stop her.

""Don't let her ruin my proposal.""

Megan watched in surprise as his friends bustled out, while Charles didn't even blink.

""Charles,"" she teased, ""you really don't have any feelings for Sylvia at all?""

Even Megan couldn't stand the way Charles' friends do things sometimes.

Before, for the sake of Charles, they'd at least show some respect for Sylvia.

But now Charles was proposing to another woman.

Who knew what tricks those guys might pull to stop Sylvia.

Charles seemed to have thought of something, frowning slightly.

""She brought this upon herself,"" he answered.

Megan broke into a smirk.

""Exactly. A woman who chases after a man is pathetic.

""At least Chloe knows how to play hard to get. That's why you're into her, right? Make her yours tonight?""

It was not that Megan looked down on Sylvia.

Charles needed a shrewd and calculating woman as his wife.

But Sylvia's whole world was Charles. She only degraded herself, and she would never measure up.

That was why Megan had made sure Sylvia got the news‚Äîlet her make a fool of herself.

# Chapter 5

The smugness overwhelmed Charles after hearing Megan's words, and he waved his hand.

He kept going. ""Alright. Go keep an eye on them. Don't let things get out of hand. I don't want Chloe to know about it.""

For a man like Charles, bedding a woman was just another victory.

As for the woman he slept with? Just something ought to be discarded.

Once he was done with Chloe, he could make it up to Sylvia.

Megan was confused. ""You're still worried about her?

""If you want her to give up, you can't give her hope again. Just let them humiliate her. Or she won't leave you‚Äî""

""That's it!""

The words ""give up"" grated on his nerves.

""Just do as I say!""

It was just that Sylvia had always been around him ever since he was a kid.

It was annoying.

Years ago, Sylvia was a cute, round-cheeked little thing.

And she'd follow him everywhere. So many kids were jealous of him.

He didn't always find her this irritating.

When did it all begin?

It was after they started high school.

He grew tall, and suddenly, it wasn't just boys around him anymore‚Äîgirls started noticing him.

The first was the head of the art group in the class‚Äîtall, flawless-skinned, and always a bit aloof.

But he was the only guy she ever let get close.

His friends were green with jealousy.

And Sylvia?

In high school, she was still short with a baby face.

Always grinned at him, tagging along like a puppy he couldn't shake off.

Then came the school sports meet.

Charles took first place in the two-mile race.

The head of the art group handed him a bottle of water in front of people.

All eyes on the field were fixed on the two of them.

At this glorious moment, Sylvia showed up.

Clad in an oversized wolf costume, she clambered onto the podium.

Right in front of the whole school, she smacked him over the head with a cheap frying pan.

The crowd roared with laughter.

But Sylvia just blinked with innocence.

Even the head of the art group cracked up.

She laughed, ""Charles, you're such a baby.

""Do this silly thing with Sylvia?""

\*\*\*\*\*

Charles shook his head.

He didn't know why he thought about that humiliating memory again.

He realized Megan was still watching him.

Then Charles snapped in a fit of rage.

""Just make sure she's gone by tomorrow,"" he ordered.

\*\*\*\*\*

I had just finished signing the contract with my client.

And when I was about to leave, Chloe and her lackeys came to corner me.

One of Chloe's friends snapped, ""Sylvia, how can you be so shameless?

""Trying to ruin the proposal? You're just so wicked!""

I racked my brain.

But I just couldn't remember the address Megan had mentioned.

Now, it seemed okay even if I didn't remember.

Chloe stood at the center of the group in a white dress, her eyes red-rimmed.

""Don't say that,"" Chloe said sweetly. ""Maybe Sylvia just came here in goodwill. After all, she and Charles are childhood friends.""

One of them went furious. ""Childhood friends? More like a crazy woman clinging to him.

""Charles said it himself‚Äîhe doesn't want her ruining the proposal. She never even mattered to him.""

The accusation just made it sound like I was some villain trying to ruin this perfect love story.

I unfolded the documents in my hand.

""I had no idea you'd be here,"" I said coolly, ""nor do I care.""

I tried to leave, but they blocked my path.

One of them sneered, ""Still acting tough? Just as Charles said, no dignity at all.

""Don't go soft on her, Chloe. Who knows what this scheming woman is plotting? Get her.""

Chloe pretended to hesitate, while her lackeys couldn't wait to act.

They shoved me back into the private room. I stumbled, and my phone slipped from my pocket.

Before I could reach my phone, someone kicked it away.

My expression hardened as I intended to call the police.

""Get away from me!"" I snapped.

But in their eyes, I just looked furious with humiliation.

That only made them even more thrilled.

I was completely surrounded‚Äîthere was no way out.

The moment I was locked in the closet, I saw Chloe standing at the back of the crowd through the crack.

She looked at me with her arms crossed and chin lifted.

I clenched my fists and steadied my breath.

I tried to talk reason with them. ""This is illegal! I will hold every single one of you accountable.

""For the last time, I don't care about who Charles marries.

""Let me out.""

Maybe my tone startled them.

But behind the crowd, Chloe started sniffling.

She seemed afraid. ""Why did you do this? Let me call Charles‚Äîplease, don't make things out of the hands.""

The call connected after three seconds.

Chloe used her typical voice. ""Charles, we've found Miss Chapman, but she's quite upset and things are getting a little out of hand.""

His reply was instant. ""Throwing another fit? I don't wanna hear anything about her. Just tell her to get lost.""

""Charles, that's too harsh.""

""She deserves it.""

The call ended.

And I heard every word.

Good.

Call logs meant evidence.

Charles could be held accountable, too.

What a joke.

I wasn't even surprised when I heard what he said.

Then one of her friends said, ""Did you hear that? Charles wants her gone.

""Lock her in. We'll let her out after tomorrow's proposal. No way she's ruining this.""

The click of the lock plunged me into darkness.

Only a thin sliver of light remained.

They swaggered off without a second glance.

But moments later, someone returned.

A phone slid through the crack and its charger was still plugged in.

The screen was lit with a livestream.

Flowers, balloons, and three words‚Äî""Chloe, marry me.""

I snorted.

I really couldn't help it.

I raised my voice. ""Is this really necessary, Chloe?

""How many times do I have to say it? I don't care about you.""

The footsteps outside paused for a second.

Without a word, Chloe turned the key in the lock.",1,1752493594.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

1lzk6mv,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvicecanada/comments/1lzk6mv/wrongfully_being_evicted/,Wrongfully being evicted,"Hello all,

My husband and I are (we believe) being wrongfully evicted. 

We have lived in our home for 3 years in August, have always paid our rent on time. With the exception of once when my bank account was compromised and completely drained. I was I communication with my landlord, showed her my bank statements and paid as soon as my money was back in my account. 

When we moved in we had 2 cats (on the lease) and in October 2024 we added a dog (i have written proof of landlord consent for this)

In 2022 our cat got accidentally locked in our bedroom while we were at work and he destroyed the carpet by the door trying to get out. We informed the landlord when this happened and she stated that she would fix it when we move and take it from our DD. 

In july 2024 they came to do an inspection and saw the carpet at this time. They reiterated that they would fix it when we move out. 

In May she informed us that their mortgage was up for renewal in September and that they were thinking of selling the house- unless we wanted to stay. We told them that we wanted to stay, they said that our rent would probably increase by $100. We said that would be okay. I also informed her that we were expecting a baby due in September at this time. 

In June she told us that they were coming down to fix the carpet in the bedroom. (They live in Victoria BC and we are in Alberta) this made me extremely nervous as they had previously stated that they would fix the carpet when we left. She asked if we would br out of town at all in thr summer and we planned to be away for the first week of July, and so they planned their trip to Alberta for this time. 

We made sure that the house was clean. My husband mowed the front lawn on Tuesday and the back lawn on Thursday and they arrived on Saturday. 

We washed all the walls, baseboards, light switches, cleaned all the floors, tidied all the spaces. I won't say it was show home worthy but it was not dirty. 

We received a text message stating that the landlord was extremely unhappy with the state of the house. She didn't give any specifics at this time but stated that after our baby was born they were going to sell the house before ""this is obviously too much house for you guys""

On July 2 we received what was essentially an eviction notice. It stated that if we wanted to remain tenants that we had to make the following changes:

-removal of all pets from the home by july 16
-remove the inoperable vehicle from the driveway (my husband's operable vehicle, just currently uninsured)
-Empty all personal items from the shed in the yard
-fire alarms in working condition (they all are? We took video proof of this as soon as we got home)
It also stated that our house was too full of personal belongings and if we want to stay they have to be removed. Everything has a place, we are not walking through piles of garbage to get around. Our living room has a bookshelf with 4 bins where we store things. The kitchen has limited storage space so there are items on the counter (air fryer, dish rack, microwave, coffee maker, toaster)

Our daughters room has a bin of stuffed animals and a bin of Lego. 

Downstairs there in a storage room where wr have our Christmas decorations (all in boxes) and boxes of clothes that our daughter has outgrown (labeled and in boxes)

There is a living room where wr have a TV, a recliner and a spare bed and there is a small room under thr stairs that has served as my daughter's playroom. The toys were all cleaned and put away in an organizer. 

All of these items were like this when the landlords did their inspection last year.

The only difference this year is that they asked us to empty out our bedroom so they could replace the flooring. I stated that we would put it all into our third (very tiny) bedroom. The furniture fit but barely and it was very cluttered however we had discussed this prior and it was done as per their request. 

-they also stated that our entire home smells like pet urine. Genuinely the only room that smells like this to me is the room where thr litter boxes are stored (downstairs basement storage room) i have never observed the cats peeing outside of the litter box.

The landlords stated that if we wanted to stay that our rent would increase by $800. 

If all of these changes were not made by july 16 that they would serve a 14 day eviction notice. 

We never intended to stay however were afraid that if wr told them we would be leaving that they would serve the 14 day eviction notice then. So the intention was to tell them by day 14 that wr will be leaving 14 days after the notice. (So Wednesday)

Yesterday we received an email from the landlord's husband stating everything that had already been said as well as he claimed he pricked his finger on a weed in our yard and stated this, ""While working in the yard I was stung by a thistle and it burned for three days. Imagine if this happens¬†to a child.""

‚Ä¢ He also added, ""belongings that are packed into the bedroom at the back need to be put into storage. Whatever does not reasonably fit into the house should be removed. We need access to all rooms within the house without having to clamber over things.""

The reason this bedroom was ""packed"" was because they asked us to empty our bedroom and so it had our bedroom furniture inside it. I have the text messages where this was discussed. 

And later in the evening another email was sent stating everything that was previously stated with the addition of, ""Upon further inspection of the home after the original July 1, 2025 inspection, we noted 
the extreme dirt or smoke buildup on the ceiling of the master bedroom ‚Äì the ceiling is 
now brown/black in colour. This was newly painted white prior to your moving in. I do 
not have proof of vaping in the home, however, this discolouration indicates such an 
issue. Smoking and vaping in the home are NOT ALLOWED. Please rectify to bring 
the ceiling back to the original white colour.""

We have never smoked or vaped inside our home. I also don't think that the ceiling is black/brown. It looks white to me. I will make sure that we clean them before we leave but to me this feels like they are looking for genuine reasons to terminate our lease as nothing has been grounds thus far. 

I also reviewed our lease and it states that we are allowed to use the driveway for parking vehicles and says nothing about the vehicle needing to be insured or not. 

It also doesn't say anything about the shed at all. When we did the move in walk through they stated we could use it however this is the ONE thing I dont have in writing. Everything else is documented through either email or text message. 

They have their brother in law coming on july 19 for an inspection but I dont know if they will go through with this as we are going to tell them wr haven't met their terms and will be leaving

What do we do? We are leaving still but we want to take them to small claims court over this. Do we have a case? I imagine they will keep our entire DD ($850+550 refundable pet deposit) so that might be something wr could bring up

Other things I think could stand in court would be: 

-unreasonable eviction (we didn't breach any of thr terms in our lease) when we got home we recorded a walk through of our home to show the ""mess""

-less than 30 day notice to remove pets from the lease (lease states this:  The Tenant may keep 2 cats in or about the Property. Prior written consent of the Landlord is required
prior to keeping any other pets at the property. The Landlord may revoke this privilege upon thirty (30) days' notice.)

-increase of rent without 3 months notice (we are on month to month term)

Anything else? Does it sound like we are being unlawfully evicted? We think that they just want us out so they can sell easier and do renovations on the home in order to get it on the market. 

When we leave we will make sure that thr house is clean and that the carpets have been professionally done as well. 

I have rented from 6 other people and have always received my DD back in full. 


If we have a case, what do we do next? Anything else we could try to settle for? I am hoping wr can get them to pay for our move and the DD back (minus the damaged carpet.) Maybe emotional damages too if that is a thing? I am 31 weeks pregnant and all of this packing and lifting has been excruciating on my body. We will be moving when I am 33 weeks pregnant and I imagine that the move will be very hard on my body 

This was a very long post and I appreciate everyone who made it this far and who has any advice for us!

# Chapter 1

On the day that Charles Sullivan proposed to Chloe Jensen, he worried that I'd cause a scene, so he had someone lock me in a closet for a full day and night.

He spoke softly, ""Chloe, don't worry. On such a special day, I won't let Sylvia ruin this for us‚Äînot today, not ever.""

All their friends cheered for them‚Äîafter all, everyone knew Sylvia Chapman was obsessed with Charles and couldn't stand any other woman coming near him.

But Charles didn't know Chloe had livestreamed the whole thing, and I watched every second of it, curled up in the closet.

What he also didn't know was that I couldn't care less about his proposal.

Because I had married someone else.

Later, I dumped every last trace of Charles into the trash right in front of him.

Staring at his face twisted with rage, I left him with a few words. ""You're pathetic.""

\*\*\*\*\*

I rushed into the private room with cold medicine in hand.

The atmosphere was electric.

But not in a good way. They were laughing at me.

The jeering went on for several minutes.

Then, Chloe pulled herself out of Charles' arms and took the medicine from my hand with a polite smile.

She said softly, ""I just got a little dizzy from the wind. There weren't any delivery guys available so late, and Charles was really worried about me. Sorry to trouble you, Miss Chapman.""

One of the crowd laughed at me. ""It's really pouring out there‚Äîlook at her, she's soaked.""

I heard someone snicker.

Some sneered, ""Just like a yes-man.""

Their mocking gazes burned into me. I shivered from the cold but didn't move.

Charles sat in the center of the crowd, completely oblivious to my misery.

Charles finally opened his mouth. ""Sylvia, consider this a lesson.""

He pulled Chloe back into his arms and warned coldly, ""I love Chloe. If I know you give her a hard time again just because you think my grandma likes you, don't blame me when I cut off your ties with my family.""

My voice came out hoarse. ""You told me I meant the world to you.""

""My grandma thinks you're important.

""She's old. I just didn't want to upset her.""

""And three years ago? When you said you would take care of me for the rest of my life?""

Charles' eyes turned icy, his voice dripping with impatience.

""So what?

""Did I ever say I loved you?""

This was absurd.

So absurd that I actually laughed.

I scanned the crowd, taking in their faces, before finally settling on Charles.

""No, you never said you loved me.

""But all these years‚Äîyou held me, kissed me, chased away every man who ever showed interest in me, and even said something about taking care of me.

""How do you explain that?""

Charles laced his fingers with Chloe's.

""Holding you? Because you were like a sister to me. That kiss? I was drunk and mistook you for someone else. As for those men, they were merely my business rivals.

""Back then, I treated you as my sister. I would surely look out for you. But now, you've crossed the line.

""Chloe is my everything. I'll be with her forever.

""So stop playing your little games with the woman I love. It's disgusting.""

He was so protective of Chloe.

Chloe buried her face in his chest, blushing. ""Stop it, Charles...""

Then, they kissed, just like some fairytale couple celebrating their victory.

The crowd around them erupted in cheers.

And I stood at the doorway, like a villainess, utterly defeated.

Charles laid the truth bare and shattered every fantasy I had.

Each word landed like hammer blows, crushing the image of the man I had once believed in.

The truth hit me like thunder.

None of what I believed had ever been real.

\*\*\*\*\*

It had been over a month since I last saw Charles.

Rumors said Charles took Chloe to meet his family.

And he told her to move into his villa at Golden Leaf.

My mind went blank for a moment when I heard the news.

That was his house‚Äîbefore Chloe, I was the only one who had ever been allowed inside.

That day, Charles had lost a big deal and been drinking.

And just then, the power went out.

I tried to help him to bed.

But then, Charles suddenly pulled me into his arms, his lips brushing against my cheek.

My heart raced with this intimacy.

If it weren't for that moment, how could I have ever believed I was even a little bit special to Charles?

# Chapter 2

Like I used to do, I would have thrown a fit in front of Mary Sullivan, demanding Charles get away from any woman who got close to him.

But now, I couldn't care less.

I was swamped with work.

I wasn't just adored by Mary‚ÄîI was also the sole heiress of the Chapman family.

Fresh out of college, I was gearing up to take over my family business, drowning in work.

One particular deal required my full attention, so I arranged to meet the clients in a private room with the files.

Little did I expect to run into someone I knew all too well.

Chloe interrogated me. ""Sylvia, are you doing this on purpose?""

Chloe sat among several business partners in a professional skirt suit with a slit up to her thighs.

I frowned, ""Are you talking to me?""

Then, Chloe burst into tears right in front of everyone.

""I'm not lucky enough to live next door to the Sullivans or win Mrs. Sullivan's affection as easily as you do. But is it my fault that Charles loves me?

""Now you're even trying to steal my clients? Are you that scared I'll outshine you in both love life and career?""

The Sullivan family was influential. The clients instantly understood that Chloe was Charles' woman.

I tightened my grip on the files. Obviously, this deal was dead in the water.

But Chloe wasn't finished. ""Charles told me how you've tried every trick to chase away his admirers over the years.

""Loving someone who doesn't love you back is truly painful, but you can't force things. And that doesn't give you the right to take it out on other girls.

""Sylvia, are you really this vicious? Stealing my clients just to make Mrs. Sullivan think I'm useless?""

I was not a pushover.

Without hesitation, I hit the record button on my phone. ""Slander is illegal, Miss Jensen. Care to repeat that?""

To my shock, Chloe walked up to me and slapped herself.

""There, Sylvia. Happy now?

""You can have my clients. And you can do whatever you want to me, but Charles... I love him.""

I was struck dumb, instinctively stepping back.

Then the door was kicked open as Charles stormed in, his face twisted with fury.

""Sylvia, what do you think you're doing?"" he shouted.

A shadow loomed over me, and the next instant, Charles' hand struck my face with brutal force.

My vision blacked out‚Äîhalf my face turned numb.

I crumpled against the chair by the blow. Drinks from the table splashed all over me.

""Charles? What are you doing here? It's not what you think‚Äî"" asked Chloe.

""She did lay a hand on you!"" Charles cut her off.

Charles cupped Chloe's face, where a faint mark barely showed.

The hand he had hit me with was even redder than the mark on Chloe's face.

But when Charles looked at me, there was nothing but disgust in his eyes.

He glared at me. ""If you don't want my grandma to hate you, apologize to Chloe.""

""Charles‚Äî"" I tried to defend myself but failed.

""Now! And beg for Chloe's forgiveness!""

Chloe buried her face in Charles' shoulder, her body trembling with soft sobs.

My face was badly swollen, and my waist throbbed where I'd slammed into the edge of the table.

Everyone in that room knew full well that I hadn't laid a finger on Chloe.

But no one would go up against Charles in the middle of his heroic rescue.

And Charles couldn't wait to ""sentence me to death"".

I met Charles' gaze with a mocking smile.

""Fine.""

Charles froze for a second.

Then his eyes darkened.

""What about your family business? You don't care about that, too?""

Charles even thought about ending years of business partnerships for his girl and threatened me with it.

Clutching my throbbing waist, I pushed myself up and met Charles' gaze head-on.

""You can say that.""

And I was also done with him.

Charles frowned under the intensity of my gaze.

But then, Chloe's honeyed voice murmured in Charles' ear.

Chloe persuaded him. ""Let's forget about it, Charles. Miss Chapman has her pride. I won't hold it against her.""

Just like that, Charles brushed aside all his doubts and scooped Chloe up in his arms, as if she were something delicate.

Then, he added, ""Sylvia, don't think your compromises will change anything between us.

""Hurting Chloe only makes me hate you more.

""And don't even think about telling my grandma about this.

""Now, I know exactly what I want.""

With that, Charles carried his beloved out in triumph.

The clients also left after that.

I started to drink all alone.

Until I vomited my guts out.

I got drunk and then sobered up.

This was how I punished myself for a decade of foolish devotion.

And after tonight?

The rotten seed that had taken root in my heart would be uprooted once and for all.

Charles, a man who knew what he truly wanted, started to make good on his threats.

His revenge against my family and me had begun.

He severed all business ties with the Chapman Group and introduced all his business partners to Chloe's barely month-old startup.

Chloe started making frequent public appearances with Charles.

He officially claimed her as his girlfriend.

I had no interest in those things, but people made sure I heard them anyway.

Back then, Charles would take me to formal events with an annoyed look.

He just needed a presentable and obedient companion.

And I let myself entertain foolish hopes just because of that ""privilege"".

Charles never explained it, but I convinced myself there was something real between us.

That was why I'd felt so jealous whenever another woman was around Charles.

And Charles never once corrected me.

But now, everything about them was just gossip to me.

I took a sip of my coffee‚Äîbitter, yet bracing.

The man sitting across from me chuckled.

He suggested, ""I did warn you, Miss Chapman‚Äîcoffee isn't really your thing. Let's get you some juice instead.

""So, maybe reconsider my proposal?

""We'd make a good match.""

# Chapter 3

My parents had me late in life‚Äîmy mother was already forty when I was born.

Mary and my mother were close friends despite their age difference, and our families had been neighbors for two generations.

Charles' parents were always jet-setting for business until a plane crash took their lives.

As a result, Mary came out of retirement to take over the Sullivan Group.

And Charles was often left in my parents' care.

That was how we grew up together.

One day, Mary said she would take me as her own, though deep down, what she truly hoped for was that I'd become her granddaughter-in-law.

My parents, however, had never been fully on board with the idea.

Charles was a typical ""left-behind"" child‚Äîproud and sensitive with strong self-esteem since young.

Losing both his parents only made it worse.

But back then, I was so head over heels for him that my parents bit their tongues.

Now, Charles openly targeted my family, and they couldn't ignore it.

Father scoffed, ""I knew he was trouble!""

I thought they would be angry, but instead, they seemed relieved.

Mother added, ""There are plenty of fish in the sea. If he's not the one, just dump him.""

I didn't mention the slap from Charles.

If my father had known it, he would've confronted Charles and knocked that brat's teeth out.

Not that I cared about Charles‚ÄîI just didn't want my father to get too worked up at nearly seventy.

Mother made a secretive call in her room, then came out with a grin.

She said, ""Syl, there's something we have been keeping from you.

""You have a fianc√©, in Strico.""

My breath caught. ""What?""

""You were head over heels for Charles, so we put it on hold.""

My parents' faces lit up when they were talking about my fianc√©. They'd never shown that look to Charles.

Honestly, marriage was the last thing on my mind.

But I knew‚Äîeven though my parents never mentioned it‚Äîthe group had taken a hit from Charles' targeted attacks.

And apparently, my fianc√© came from money.

My parents weren't trying to push me into marriage‚Äîthey always put my happiness first.

But they were getting old.

They had given me everything. I couldn't let our family group go under on my watch.

The business circle in Maris was all waiting for my downfall.

After all, I'd been the only woman by Charles' side for years.

They all expected our wedding‚Äîuntil Chloe came along.

Now they also wanted me to go broke.

I wouldn't give them the satisfaction.

My parents' praises for that fianc√© hit me.

I used to think I'd never want anyone but Charles.

But here I was.

I sat here, talking about marriage with someone else.

That was when I realized things were just okay.

My world didn't collapse over Charles.

Life went on.

Love could be a long thing.

But falling out of love with Charles only took a heartbeat.

\*\*\*\*\*

Megan Sullivan stormed into my office.

She shouted, ""Charles is proposing to Chloe. What are you doing?""

What was I doing?

I looked down at the lunchbox in my hands while the voice continued through the phone.

The flight from Strico to Maris took two and a half hours.

I was confused. ""So you had this lunchbox sent to me just because you thought it tasted good?""

When I found out Julian Russell was my fianc√©, no one would know how shocked I was.

The Russells in Strico only made my family look like a small fry.

I'd heard of Julian long before I ever met him, but most stories painted him as a ruthless businessman.

But the man I met‚Äîclassic tycoon looks, yet with a warm smile‚Äîflashed through my mind.

The two images didn't quite match.

And Megan kept yelling, ""Lunchbox? Who are you even calling at a time like this? Forget about food.""

Megan was shouting at the top of her lungs, so I leaned back slightly.

Julian's deep voice came through the phone.

""Got it, my fianc√©e. Next time, I'll deliver it personally,"" he offered.

His words somehow made my ears burn.

""That's not what I mean.""

""I heard some noise. Need my help?""

""No. I'll call you back.""

# Chapter 4

I talked to Julian about my past.

My complicated ties with the Sullivans, my decade-long unrequited love for Charles.

And the real reason I agreed to meet him was because my group needed his financial backing.

Julian didn't even bat an eye.

Instead, he analyzed market trends, advised the Chapman Group to pivot its business, offered an investment, and even produced a business plan.

All on one condition‚Äîour engagement stood.

I really had no reason to refuse.

So he had another formal dinner with my parents.

Then, our engagement was official.

He seemed to be a natural at charming the elderly.

My mother already saw him as part of the family. Even my father's white beard seemed to darken with joy.

But I wanted no public announcement about our engagement until the group was back on track.

Julian agreed.

Before Julian left Maris, he clasped a necklace around my neck.

It was a simple chain with a rose pendant, a design unfamiliar to me, as an engagement gift.

I hung up the phone.

Megan dropped into the chair across from me.

She started, ""Sylvia, tomorrow at 8 PM sharp‚ÄîCharles is proposing on the Sullivan Group rooftop. Don't say I didn't give you a heads-up.""

A casual remark from me. ""I see.""

""So what's your plan? Fake a suicide to get Charles out of there, or ask for my grandma's help?""

""Now, I'm clocking out.""

""That's my girl. Leaving early to get ready. I'm telling you. This is serious.""

""Get ready for what?""

I met Megan's gaze without flinching.

""Megan, are you egging on an outsider to fake a suicide just to ruin your cousin's proposal?

""You hate him that much?""

Megan paused, finally realizing something was off about me. ""Sylvia, have you lost your mind because of Charles?

""I know you're just playing hard to get to catch Charles' attention, but once he's engaged, it's over.""

""Then I wish him a happy marriage.""

Megan nearly jumped out of her seat. ""Keep telling yourself that!

""Anyway, I told you about this. Your call whether you show up or not.""

I scoffed and reached for the office phone.

Megan thought I'd finally come to my senses, wearing that smug look.

I picked up the phone. ""Send two security guards to my office. If you let Megan in again, you're fired.""

""Sylvia!"" Megan shrieked.

\*\*\*\*\*

Charles had downed an entire bottle of red wine tonight.

The living room buzzed with activity.

Charles' friends were busy setting up for his proposal to Chloe.

Megan stormed in.

Charles knew exactly where she had been.

Yet, he hadn't stopped her.

Lately, he'd been a bit obsessed with Chloe, but Sylvia just had to anger him.

So if Sylvia came to make a scene tomorrow, he'd just do as she said.

After all, this whole proposal was meant for her anyway.

And proposed to Chloe? No way.

Chloe was always at her most obedient when she thought she had him hooked.

But once she got too docile, she was no different from any other woman.

But Sylvia knew what to do.

Sylvia might complain to his grandma or have Megan threaten those women.

Either way, those troubles just vanished without a trace.

She saved him a lot of headaches.

Charles was surprised Megan came back so soon.

Normally, she and Sylvia would spend hours scheming how to ruin the proposal.

After days of silence, he knew Sylvia would beg through tears for him not to fall for someone else.

Megan snickered, ""Charles, Sylvia totally lost her temper. You really carried her off her feet.

""If Sylvia really tries to ruin your proposal by pulling the suicide stunt? Would you actually fall for that?""

One of Charles' friends seemed shocked. ""So that's why Sylvia has not shown up for a month. She's been planning something big.

""Man, only you could drive a girl to suicide over love.""

Charles set down his glass, feeling things were getting tricky.

If Sylvia hurt herself, his grandma would freeze his accounts again.

It'd been this way since they were kids.

If Sylvia cried, it was his fault.

As if she were related by blood.

Charles was just about to open his mouth.

Then someone muttered, ""But, didn't the Chapmans recently put the word about an engagement out?""

Megan rolled her eyes.

""Hasn't Sylvia already tried this trick? Spreading rumors about getting engaged to Charles to pressure him into playing along. Now she's using it again?"" Megan sneered.

The guy scratched his head, struggling to recall. ""Was it... Charles?""

""Enough,"" Charles cut him off.

Same old Sylvia, an idiot who was infatuated with him.

Before he finished his words, someone pressed against the floor-to-ceiling window and called out excitedly.

One of them shouted, ""Look! It's Sylvia. She's downstairs! She's coming in!

""This is gonna be fun.""

Charles frowned.

Too early. He had a candlelit dinner planned with Chloe tonight.

One last fling before dumping her tomorrow.

His voice turned icy.

He demanded, ""Stop her.

""Don't let her ruin my proposal.""

Megan watched in surprise as his friends bustled out, while Charles didn't even blink.

""Charles,"" she teased, ""you really don't have any feelings for Sylvia at all?""

Even Megan couldn't stand the way Charles' friends do things sometimes.

Before, for the sake of Charles, they'd at least show some respect for Sylvia.

But now Charles was proposing to another woman.

Who knew what tricks those guys might pull to stop Sylvia.

Charles seemed to have thought of something, frowning slightly.

""She brought this upon herself,"" he answered.

Megan broke into a smirk.

""Exactly. A woman who chases after a man is pathetic.

""At least Chloe knows how to play hard to get. That's why you're into her, right? Make her yours tonight?""

It was not that Megan looked down on Sylvia.

Charles needed a shrewd and calculating woman as his wife.

But Sylvia's whole world was Charles. She only degraded herself, and she would never measure up.

That was why Megan had made sure Sylvia got the news‚Äîlet her make a fool of herself.

# Chapter 5

The smugness overwhelmed Charles after hearing Megan's words, and he waved his hand.

He kept going. ""Alright. Go keep an eye on them. Don't let things get out of hand. I don't want Chloe to know about it.""

For a man like Charles, bedding a woman was just another victory.

As for the woman he slept with? Just something ought to be discarded.

Once he was done with Chloe, he could make it up to Sylvia.

Megan was confused. ""You're still worried about her?

""If you want her to give up, you can't give her hope again. Just let them humiliate her. Or she won't leave you‚Äî""

""That's it!""

The words ""give up"" grated on his nerves.

""Just do as I say!""

It was just that Sylvia had always been around him ever since he was a kid.

It was annoying.

Years ago, Sylvia was a cute, round-cheeked little thing.

And she'd follow him everywhere. So many kids were jealous of him.

He didn't always find her this irritating.

When did it all begin?

It was after they started high school.

He grew tall, and suddenly, it wasn't just boys around him anymore‚Äîgirls started noticing him.

The first was the head of the art group in the class‚Äîtall, flawless-skinned, and always a bit aloof.

But he was the only guy she ever let get close.

His friends were green with jealousy.

And Sylvia?

In high school, she was still short with a baby face.

Always grinned at him, tagging along like a puppy he couldn't shake off.

Then came the school sports meet.

Charles took first place in the two-mile race.

The head of the art group handed him a bottle of water in front of people.

All eyes on the field were fixed on the two of them.

At this glorious moment, Sylvia showed up.

Clad in an oversized wolf costume, she clambered onto the podium.

Right in front of the whole school, she smacked him over the head with a cheap frying pan.

The crowd roared with laughter.

But Sylvia just blinked with innocence.

Even the head of the art group cracked up.

She laughed, ""Charles, you're such a baby.

""Do this silly thing with Sylvia?""

\*\*\*\*\*

Charles shook his head.

He didn't know why he thought about that humiliating memory again.

He realized Megan was still watching him.

Then Charles snapped in a fit of rage.

""Just make sure she's gone by tomorrow,"" he ordered.

\*\*\*\*\*

I had just finished signing the contract with my client.

And when I was about to leave, Chloe and her lackeys came to corner me.

One of Chloe's friends snapped, ""Sylvia, how can you be so shameless?

""Trying to ruin the proposal? You're just so wicked!""

I racked my brain.

But I just couldn't remember the address Megan had mentioned.

Now, it seemed okay even if I didn't remember.

Chloe stood at the center of the group in a white dress, her eyes red-rimmed.

""Don't say that,"" Chloe said sweetly. ""Maybe Sylvia just came here in goodwill. After all, she and Charles are childhood friends.""

One of them went furious. ""Childhood friends? More like a crazy woman clinging to him.

""Charles said it himself‚Äîhe doesn't want her ruining the proposal. She never even mattered to him.""

The accusation just made it sound like I was some villain trying to ruin this perfect love story.

I unfolded the documents in my hand.

""I had no idea you'd be here,"" I said coolly, ""nor do I care.""

I tried to leave, but they blocked my path.

One of them sneered, ""Still acting tough? Just as Charles said, no dignity at all.

""Don't go soft on her, Chloe. Who knows what this scheming woman is plotting? Get her.""

Chloe pretended to hesitate, while her lackeys couldn't wait to act.

They shoved me back into the private room. I stumbled, and my phone slipped from my pocket.

Before I could reach my phone, someone kicked it away.

My expression hardened as I intended to call the police.

""Get away from me!"" I snapped.

But in their eyes, I just looked furious with humiliation.

That only made them even more thrilled.

I was completely surrounded‚Äîthere was no way out.

The moment I was locked in the closet, I saw Chloe standing at the back of the crowd through the crack.

She looked at me with her arms crossed and chin lifted.

I clenched my fists and steadied my breath.

I tried to talk reason with them. ""This is illegal! I will hold every single one of you accountable.

""For the last time, I don't care about who Charles marries.

""Let me out.""

Maybe my tone startled them.

But behind the crowd, Chloe started sniffling.

She seemed afraid. ""Why did you do this? Let me call Charles‚Äîplease, don't make things out of the hands.""

The call connected after three seconds.

Chloe used her typical voice. ""Charles, we've found Miss Chapman, but she's quite upset and things are getting a little out of hand.""

His reply was instant. ""Throwing another fit? I don't wanna hear anything about her. Just tell her to get lost.""

""Charles, that's too harsh.""

""She deserves it.""

The call ended.

And I heard every word.

Good.

Call logs meant evidence.

Charles could be held accountable, too.

What a joke.

I wasn't even surprised when I heard what he said.

Then one of her friends said, ""Did you hear that? Charles wants her gone.

""Lock her in. We'll let her out after tomorrow's proposal. No way she's ruining this.""

The click of the lock plunged me into darkness.

Only a thin sliver of light remained.

They swaggered off without a second glance.

But moments later, someone returned.

A phone slid through the crack and its charger was still plugged in.

The screen was lit with a livestream.

Flowers, balloons, and three words‚Äî""Chloe, marry me.""

I snorted.

I really couldn't help it.

I raised my voice. ""Is this really necessary, Chloe?

""How many times do I have to say it? I don't care about you.""

The footsteps outside paused for a second.

Without a word, Chloe turned the key in the lock.",2,1752493190.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

Keep a cleaning schedule. It‚Äôs easy to let things pile up when no one‚Äôs watching. But a clean space = calm mind.

Fix one thing a week. A drawer, a loose bulb, your messy files. Makes your space feel more yours.

Talk to yourself. Seriously. Out loud. It helps.

Create rituals: Sunday reset, Friday movie night, weekday coffee by the window. These anchor you.

It‚Äôs okay to feel lonely sometimes. That doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre doing it wrong.

I'm hoping this community can give me impartial opinions and advice. If I'm the one in the wrong, please tell me. Also, sorry, this post is SUPER long. 

I (31F) and my boyfriend Brian (31M) have been dating for 9 years. I know some people might find it weird that we've been dating so long and haven't gotten engaged or married, but honestly, it's not something either of us sees as a must. At this point, we kinda feel married already. A wedding would just be an expensive formality.

We met and started dating in college, and we've both spent the last 6 years focusing on furthering our education, building our careers, investing where we can and moving countries together. 

In the beginning, the relationship was great, but I admit that I ignored a few red flags. I was a young college kid with not a lot of dating experience, and at the time, I didn't see certain things that I should've paid attention to. He would lie about where he was going or who he was with. When I would find out the truth and ask him about it, he'd say that he lied because he knew the truth would upset me. But I never gave him reason to think this about me before, and I honestly had no issues about who he hung out with. I trusted him. I was upset about the lying and that he felt the need to do so in the first place. Our mutual friends kept reassuring me that he was just being an idiot and had made assumptions based on past experiences with previous girlfriends. He stopped, we moved on from it, and things were really good.

However, over the years, his behaviour towards me has become progressively less romantic and more like a mix between a manager/employee situation when things are bad and a friends-who-live-together situation when things are good. He has always blamed it on the stress of his job. I've started to feel like I'm one of the 'bros' and his employee at the same time. 

He'd downplay my promotions at work by picking them apart and stating why they weren't good enough for me to accept (I took them anways), he'd pick arguments with me just as we were on our way to spend Christmas or new years with my family making it tense and not enjoyable, told me that his job is more important than mine (his dad said the same thing to me) so if his job requires us to move, I need to quit mine in favour of his. He suggests breaking up in almost every argument, shouts at me when I make mistakes, blames me for being 'too sensitive', and expects affection from me, but then is too tired to reciprocate. 

A couple of years ago, I suggested couples counselling as a way to address the issues that had been building up over the years because I believed it was a communication problem. We just needed help learning how to communicate our needs to one another, but he flat out refused to go with me.  

I spent hours and hours doing research on how to fix things between us on our own. I started to consider that perhaps I am the problem, and I'm asking for too much or have unrealistic expectations. Because this is the only serious, long-term relationship I've had, I don't know if what I'm experiencing is normal or not. Or if I am indeed being unreasonable. 

When I explain that I'm feeling lonely and in need of affection, he laughs and tells me it's unrealistic and ""that's for the movies"". I gave up on trying to show affection because it's been one-sided for years. 

When things are good, we get along so well, we laugh until we cry, we bond over the shows we're watching, go sightseeing together, and we support each other financially. Over the years, when I was strapped for cash, he would help me out, and when he was strapped for cash, I would do the same. He's been amazing at helping out my immediate family when they needed it, he's helped me care for my pets or fix my car, or help my parents around the house, and he's put a lot of thought into my birthdays and our anniversaries. He's managed our finances responsibly to ensure we reach our goals without breaking the bank or going into debt. He's also taught me a lot in terms of personal finance, filing taxes, etc. I will give credit where it is due. Over the decade together, I've learnt so much from him and vice versa, we supported each other while doing our post-grads and while he messed up in so many ways as did I (nobody is perfect), he's also stepped up to the plate in many others. And I appreciate him for that. 

It's how he treats me when life gets rough or when he doesn't get his way that has me feeling defeated. He can get very mean. He has sworn at me during an argument, telling me to ""eff off and get out"". If he wants to be intimate and I'm not into it, he sulks and holds it against me. But there have been times when I would initiate intimacy, and he wasn't in the mood, and it didn't bother me. We're human. Sometimes we're in the mood, sometimes we're not, and that's okay. 

He doesn't help with cooking dinner, even though he works from home while I'm at the office three times a week. By the time I get home from my commute (2 hours each way), I'm exhausted and would appreciate at least some help with the prep work. Apparently, this is too big of an ask. I'm also expected to make his coffee, cook breakfast and lunch when we're both home, make all the appointments for doctors or dentists on his behalf, do the cleaning, the managing of the house, our meal planning, etc. If I rest, I get reprimanded for ""doing nothing around the house"". He does help with laundry and sometimes tidying up, though. I've tried talking to him about evening out the workload, but it never gets anywhere. 

If I voice what I'm feeling or how I need more help around the house, he calls me ungrateful and says, ""After all I've done for you over the years"", and ""fine, I'll just never ask you for anything ever again"" or ""do you even love me anymore?"". It's like nothing I try helps us move forward.

I've also noticed his hostility towards me since I got my current job six months ago. He was always the breadwinner, and I was super appreciative of it, and I'd do my best to balance things out, but now that I bring home around $200 a month more than him, he has started acting weirdly. He jokes about being proud to have a sugar mommy, but then ""jokes"" that I'm going to leave him now because I have the money to do so. He gives me back-handed compliments when talking about my job to family and friends back home. When we argue about anything, I'm always left feeling confused and hurt - he picks fights with me over nothing, backtracks on his argument halfway through when I try to get to the crux of the problem by asking questions, insults me in some way and then finishes off with a joke to lighten the mood again. Like what? The whole thing feels like a weird rollercoaster. 

My heart and my head are at war with each other. My head knows it would be better to walk away or go on a break because I'm unhappy, but my heart isn't ready to consider either of those things. I don't know how to take that step. I also don't want to just throw away 9 years. He once told me that if we broke up, it would mean we'd wasted each other's time, and he wouldn't forgive me for that. I don't want him to hate me. 

Our lives and families are so intertwined already that I feel as though parting ways wouldn't just be a breakup but more like a divorce. A really ugly, heartbreaking and messy one. We immigrated together a while back, so it would be a difficult and awkward living situation if things ended between us. I'm considering flying back to my home country for a month to give us some time and space. Maybe this would finally help us. I don't know.

However, my cousin (32M) said something that I haven't been able to stop thinking about. ""Think about the last 9 years. Would you rather walk away and be free of that weight on your shoulders and start a new chapter, or do you want to have those same 9 years ahead of you? Do you want to look back in another 9 years' time and realise nothing got better? He has been promising you for years that things will get better, but they never have.""   
Honestly, that was a real punch to the gut. I just don't know how to get my heart to catch up to my head because I still love him. I'm just so defeated, and I'm worried that any decision I make will be the wrong one. 

If you can offer me advice on how to move forward, I appreciate your time. Thanks for reading this far.

1lzjv14,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lzjv14,Toni and Barb Update,"Hi everyone,

Just thought I‚Äôd give an update on Toni and Barb!! 

Both birdies are doing great. The first vet gave Barb some eye drops, these seemed to clear up the gunk but didn‚Äôt help the swelling. So we took her to another avian vet who was sure she had bird chlymydia (you learn something new everyday). 2 weeks of antibiotics and her eye was already looking much better. So we had to take both of them back and get a 2 month course to treat them both (vet said it was very likely Toni had it too with no symptoms). We‚Äôve almost finished the antibiotics and Barb‚Äôs eye is looking soooooo much better (warning there is a bit of a gross pic at the end for comparison). 

Unfortunately the vet did say that Barb has some permanent scarring/vision loss in one eye from not getting treatment for so long. But her other eye is completely fine. Since starting antibiotics she‚Äôs really started to show her personality! 

We‚Äôve essentially now converted our house to a bird house. Our office is now the bird‚Äôs bedroom. And we got a little play gym for our coffee table so they can sit out with us whenever they want. 

Toni‚Äôs favourite activity is clinging to me, and screaming whenever I leave the room. And Barb‚Äôs favourite activity is chewing whatever she can (except all the toys that I‚Äôve bought her üòë).

They‚Äôve grown their feathers back a fair bit, but still can‚Äôt fly. The vet did recommend potentially clipping Barb‚Äôs wings once they‚Äôve grown back since she has some vision loss and it might cause accidents. 

Both of them are now eating pellets, fresh fruit/vege and seeds. I‚Äôve been making a weekly chop which they love! 

I‚Äôm still on the hunt for a bigger cage for them. I‚Äôve tried searching high and low but bigger cages seem to have bigger bar spaces which I don‚Äôt think would be ideal for them. So if anyone has any cage recommendations (in Aus) please let me know! 

Thanks to everyone on my previous post for all the advice and kindness - I really appreciated it! ü•∞

1lzjuyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1lzjuyr/i_have_a_problem_with_indian_coffee/,I have a problem with Indian coffee,"Hi fellow coffee addicts. 

I have a problem with caffiene- it affects my period. I get spotting during my period and it also increases my stress and heartbeat for hours. 

Now, I've found that when I drink coffee from abroad, it doesn't have this effect at all. 

I have only tried organic coffee granules (powdered for use in a moka pot) and also instant coffee (either Tata Gold or Rage). I'm not a fan of instant coffee and I want to buy a coffee machine and such but because of how it affects my period and cortisol levels, I have been avoiding caffiene for the past 5 months ( I know, the horror!üòî). 

I have tried decaf coffee by Davidoff, but it gives me weird headaches(and no, it's not from caffiene withdrawal, I have experimented that)

So, I just want to know if anyone else faces such issues. I also want to know if there are authentic brands (machine use or otherwise) that are equivalent to the international coffee brands. I don't want to have anything imported at the moment, unless I'm sure it's really good.

1lzjsro,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1lzjsro/i_will_always_remember_family_weekends_away_in/,I will always remember family weekends away in the Yorkshire Dales. I just wish I could forget that night.,"I will always remember family weekends away in Yorkshire Dales. They were a lovely part of my childhood and teenage years, woven like bright threads through the more humdrum fabric of weeks and months. ¬†For several weekends throughout the year, we would drive up to a small group of stone-built cottages in a remote village at the upper end of the dale. From there, we would go hiking, cook food together, and laugh the hours away over games, drinks and conversation.

¬†

Nothing untoward had ever happened before - nor did it ever again ‚Äì but there was one night amidst all of the joy that would forever remain in the back of my mind‚Ä¶

¬†

At the time of the event, I was eighteen, and was just finishing my first term at university. We were meeting up with friends who had been my de facto family since before I could remember. Between us, we had rented the little huddle of three cottages that circled the parking area. Across from them, beyond the fast-flowing stream, lay only farmland and distant hills. They were in the two smaller cottages and we had the slightly larger house, facing the waterfall.

¬†

As the youngest, and at that time without a partner, I was assigned the smallest of the bedrooms ‚Äì if you could even call it that. It was more of a large cupboard, with a small single bed wedged into it, and a sloped ceiling leading to a small window, that I liked to keep open to enjoy the cool wintry air with its faint tang of woodsmoke and leaves. Despite being on the top floor, the layout of the cottage meant that the window looked out onto the narrow, winding road through the village, rather than the parking area.

¬†

We always made the space work for us, we would move tables and chairs into the middle cottage, cook in various ovens and transport the food to the shared tables to enjoy communal meals. Saturday had passed in its habitual manner ‚Äì long, sometimes muddy walks, often with odd detours, finishing, as if by law, in a pub. Down time and showers, glasses of wine and craft time, before gathering for my uncle‚Äôs famous roast dinner, at a table heaving with meat, vegetables, Yorkshire puddings, beer and wine, by a roaring log fire. The sound of several competing conversations, requests for potatoes and the general light-hearted joking accompanied the dinner, the dessert, and the cheeseboard. Hours flew by, and, full of dinner and good ale, combined with the fatigue of hill-walking in the country air, I was exhausted. Excusing myself, I retreated to our cottage, taking my beloved dog, Freddie, with me.

¬†

Outside, the air was crisp and frosty. Stars ‚Äì always so much more visible there than in the town ‚Äì enticed the watcher to stare at their distant beauty. I stood for several minutes, Freddie taking the opportunity to snuffle around and to drink from the stream before we entered the cottage. I opened the door, walked into the warmth of the living room, and closed the door behind me. Remembering my mother‚Äôs laughing instruction not to lock them out, I placed the key on the coffee table so that it would be clearly visible to the last one in. There was no risk of intruders that far up the dale, unless a random sheep invaded... I placed a log on the smoldering fire, and, with Freddie in tow, headed up the stairs to the cupboard room.

¬†

Sleep did not come immediately, nor did I want it to: my uncle‚Äôs amazing food always led to over-indulgence and I was content to lie in the warmth of my quilted bed, watching videos on my phone and enjoying time alone after the depleting my social batteries.

¬†

Somewhere after eleven, I heard the front door open, then close. So distinct was the sound that Freddie sat up, alert for the return of his family. I heard no conversation, however, nor did I hear the door being locked, so assumed that one but not all of them had returned. I could hear calm footsteps moving from the living room to the kitchen, light switches being turned on and off, and the crumbling of half-burned logs being prompted to new life by the poker. Having already said my goodnights, I didn‚Äôt call out or think any further of it, but simply turned off my phone, wriggled into a comfortable position next to Freddie, and went to sleep.

¬†

I startled awake ‚Äì I do not know how much later ‚Äì disturbed by the sound of banging on the window and Freddie barking hysterically. ‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù I thought groggily, still deeply immersed in the tide of sleep.

¬†

‚ÄúIain! Wake up!‚Äù The voice, from the roadside of the room, was that of my sister, straining to pitch her voice so as to wake me but not the entire village. Irritated, I moved over to the window, and opened the curtain, only to see my sister below the window, looking annoyed.

¬†

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I snapped.

¬†

‚ÄúOpen the - you‚Äôve locked us all out!‚Äù she snapped back.

¬†

‚ÄúNo, someone else came back after me,‚Äù I protested ‚Äì ‚ÄúHave a go at them!‚Äù

¬†

My sister snorted sarcastically ‚Äì ‚ÄúEr‚Ä¶. No. Mum, dad and Tim are all outside the door freezing their butts off because *someone* locked the door.‚Äù

¬†

I froze. Contemplating the words she had just said to me. I immediately wanted to think that I had ‚Ä¶ just locked the door. That I had just imagined the quiet footsteps downstairs, moving from room to room, stirring the fire. But my heart knew better: Freddie too had heard the sounds and responded to them. I realized that I was trembling; Freddie, as if in sympathy, let out a slight whine. If they were all out there ‚Äì who had been in here, with us?

¬†

Cautiously, I slowly opened the bedroom door, half expecting ‚Ä¶to find something waiting? To hear footsteps moving coming towards me?¬† Freddie was on edge, hackles raised ‚Äì but that seemed to be more in response to my fear than to something external. I descended to the living room, one hand tucked into Freddie‚Äôs collar, opened the door, to find the last embers of the fire, glowing a sullen red, the only light in the room. Someone ‚Äì or something ‚Äì had turned off the light.

I took a deep breath and edged my hand towards the light switch, fully expecting an intruder to be revealed when I switched on the light.

¬†

To my horror, the sudden brightness revealed ‚Ä¶nothing. In my fear, but not forgetting that my family were still outside in the frosty chill of the early hours, doubtlessly becoming increasingly irritable, I searched the coffee table for the key. Again. Again, including the floor around it ‚Äì but to no avail.

¬†

I was startled by a sudden rap on the window. Dad.

¬†

‚ÄúThe key‚Äôs in the door!‚Äù he grumbled, clearly realizing what I was looking for. A shiver ran down me once more, as I looked at the door and realized that he was right.

¬†

I could easily have brushed off the whole series of events, telling myself that I had imagined footsteps, door latches, light switches‚Ä¶. But I know where I left that key. This wasn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôd been expected to leave the door unlocked for others, and I had been meticulous about leaving it in plain view.

¬†

And it had been found and used. I‚Äôm just not sure by who. Or what.

¬†

A sudden urge to have strength in numbers washed over me. Without hesitating, I marched to the door and opened it, allowing the rest of my family to surge in with their reassuring noise and joking. I didn‚Äôt feel like laughing, though. I was scared, frankly. I retreated upstairs, part embarrassment, part terror, to cocoon myself in the quilt.

¬†

My mother had caught on to something, however; she came up to check that I was OK. I nearly cried, such had been me fear, as I explained how I felt and what I had heard. She ushered me into her bedroom and we watched TV to calm me down, until the normality of it made my fear dwindle. I lay there, safe in my mother‚Äôs embrace, eighteen, and feeling like a toddler after a bad dream.

¬†

The next morning was time to leave the cottages for a final walk before home. We didn‚Äôt discuss that night with anyone and carried on as normal ‚Äì although my understanding of reality had been subtly but permanently changed.

¬†

Yes, I will always remember family weekends away in the Yorkshire Dales. I just wish I could forget that night.

The ethical considerations are obvious, but I‚Äôm curious about the career paths opening up because of this. It‚Äôs not just marketing anymore, but a weird blend of data science, behavioral psychology, and understanding the nuances of why people listen to what they do on the road.

What kind of skills are really in demand in this field? is it data analysis, marketing strategy, or something else entirely? And what dose the future hold for this type of hyper-targeted advertising while we're driving? Interested in hearing other people‚Äôs thoughts and experiences.",1,1752492131.0,RevvCulture,0,1.0,False

Espresso Newbie here. Only the second shot with a light roast. Looking for advice/suggestions/recommendations.

Pulled a 40gms shot in 30 seconds with an 18gms dose. A slightly larger yield than the traditional 1:2 to allow the light roast to extract more. There is a bit of spraying at the beginning--possibly tamping/WDT technique issues or both? It tasted fruity and slightly sour, with a hint of bittersweet aftertaste.

**Gear:**

1. DeLonghi ECP33.21
2. MHW3-Bomber R3 Hand Grinder at 38 Clicks
3. Generic Bottomless Portafilter with the stock unpressurized basket
4. Generic WDT with Removable Needles
5. MHW3-Bomber 0.2mm puck screen
6. HiBrew 51mm Tamper

**Process:**

1. 15 Minute Machine Preheat with the Portafilter
2. Two-Blank Shots Through the Portafilter
3. Puck Prep with WDT and Tamping
4. Wait for the Machine to come up to temp.
5. Pull a blank shot into the cup without the portafilter
6. Attach the portafilter
7. Wait for the machine to come up to temp.
8. Switch the machine to steam mode for 2-3 seconds (temp-surf)
9. Pull the shot

This is a washed, light roast variety of coffee (altitude 1100-1200m) (Blue Tokai Seethargundu Estate) with Sweet Lime, Apricot and Black Tea tasting notes, and is primarily listed as suitable for Pour-overs and AeroPress. Just thought of giving it a try to see if the machine can pull it off.

Up next, planning to try it with a slightly coarser grind at 39 clicks, with a paper filter at the bottom of the puck, for a 54gms shot in 20-25 seconds for a tea-like finish, hopefully (Following Lance's recipe for the light roast in the Stilosa video).

Apologies for the bad video quality, esp. at the beginning and towards the end--recording the video, timing the shot and watching the weight--all was a bit too much for me, being the first time.

TIA for all the advice/suggestions/corrections.",1,1752492048.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

At twenty,

Hendrix Lee took me‚Äîa girl with nothing‚Äîand knelt outside his family‚Äôs doorstep for three days and nights,

just so this orphan could step into the wealthy Lee family‚Äôs world.

Three years into our marriage, we were still as sweet as newlyweds,

one of the rare golden couples in our social circle.

Until one utterly ordinary afternoon,

as I trimmed flower stems, he came downstairs and said,

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs pregnant. It‚Äôs mine. I need to be with her.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe child will call you Mom.‚Äù

My hand jerked, and the vibrant rose tumbled to the ground, its brilliance wilting.

‚ÄúWhy tell me now, of all times?‚Äù

His silence said it all. Our marriage was over.

I forced the words out, my voice raw. ‚ÄúHendrix, let‚Äôs get a divorce.‚Äù

‚ÄúLyra, haven‚Äôt I been good to you? Why end things?‚Äù

Even the most patient person would snap at that.

I grabbed the ashtray from the coffee table and hurled it at him.

‚ÄúWhy?!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?!‚Äù

‚ÄúHendrix, you got another woman pregnant, and you dare ask me why?‚Äù

‚ÄúDoes that even make sense to you?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt dodge.

Glass shattered across the floor, a bruise blooming on his forehead.

But it wasn‚Äôt enough. I swept books, magazines‚Äîeverything‚Äîoff the table, throwing them at him.

Hendrix didn‚Äôt flinch. He stood there, unyielding, not even a flicker of pain on his face.

Finally, I smashed my favorite vase. The flowers inside had been freshly picked that morning.

Hendrix had always been cold‚Äîbefore we married, his room was all sterile grays and whites, lifeless.

Every week, I‚Äôd bring fresh flowers to breathe warmth into it.

After the wedding, I‚Äôd spent months working with designers to turn the estate into a home. Every piece of furniture, every detail‚ÄîI‚Äôd chosen them all.

The home that had once been our sanctuary now lay in ruins. Destroyed by my own hands.

Hendrix watched me silently, his gaze strange, as if I were some madwoman.

Exhausted, I crumpled to the floor, sobs wracking my body.

He stepped closer, looming over me.

Then, after a long pause, he lifted me up, cleared a spot on the couch, and set me down.

Kneeling before me, his thumb brushed away my tears, his eyes almost tender.

‚ÄúLyra, don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ It kills me to see you like this.‚Äù

In his eyes, I saw my reflection‚Äîblurred, shattered.

For a moment, I froze.

How had it come to this?

I wiped my cheeks, steadying myself.

‚ÄúDo you remember what you promised me?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou said we‚Äôd stay together forever. Grow old together.‚Äù

But Hendrix, it‚Äôs only been three years, and you‚Äôve already betrayed me. Betrayed us.

‚ÄúHow long has it been with her?‚Äù

He looked away, unable to meet my eyes.

‚ÄúAlmost a year.‚Äù

So they‚Äôd been together that long?",1,1752492014.0,novelsfree,1,1.0,False

When Sarah Hopkins was struggling through a difficult childbirth, her husband was in the neighboring ward, attending to his first love. ""Dr. Hopkins won't be coming over. Other doctors can take care of you here,"" a nurse said cautiously. Sarah closed her eyes in despair, her heart aching even more than the tearing pain in her body. Matthew Hopkins, her attending physician, had been in charge of her health throughout the entire pregnancy. Now, he had abandoned Sarah for his first love. Bed number 21, Yvonne Kennedy, was Matthew's beloved. They had even planned to get married once.

If it hadn't been for that accident, Yvonne would be carrying Matthew's child right now. With her last ounce of strength, Sarah looked at her deflated belly. She hadn't even had a chance to see her baby. She didn't know if it was a boy or a girl, or if it looked more like her or Matthew. Sarah closed her eyes, feeling an overwhelming exhaustion she had never experienced before.

The pain in her lower abdomen was tearing her apart, and the rapidly bleeding blood seemed to be counting down the final moments of her life. She couldn't hold on any longer. Her eyes rolled back, and she fainted. Someone's scream echoed in the background, ""Get the defibrillator. The patient isn't breathing.""

\*\*\*\*\*

In the neighboring ward, ""Darling, Matthew, it hurts so much,"" the frail figure on bed number 21 trembled slightly, clutching both Matthew's and Samuel Pearson's hands tightly. Concerned, Matthew looked at Yvonne, who was so thin and frail, with a big belly, and pursed his lips tightly. 'Damn it, how could Samuel let Yvonne get pregnant and give birth at such a young age?' Matthew thought to himself.

Yvonne was already thin. During her pregnancy, she had no appetite at all and was now skin and bones. Matthew couldn't even imagine how much suffering Yvonne would have to endure to give birth to this child. Without caring that Samuel was still there, Matthew tightly held Yvonne's hand, his voice trembling. ""Yvonne, don't worry. I'm here. You and the baby will be fine. I'll always be by your side."" Matthew's eyes were bloodshot, with an endless determination in them. ""You will give birth smoothly. You will."" \*\*\*\*\*

Sarah felt like she was falling into a deep sleep, occasionally hearing sounds from the outside world. Time dragged on endlessly. She was carried up and down by the wind, helpless, much like her days and nights in the Hopkins residence. On those countless nights when she was bullied and belittled by the Hopkins family, she had thought about giving up. It was her purest love for Matthew that gave her the courage to keep going. She never imagined that after trying so hard to please them for so long, she would still end up being discarded like trash. If she could wake up, she really wanted to change everything.

Three years passed in the blink of an eye.

A boy in a fluffy jacket was peering through the window, stretching his neck to get a better look inside. The woman lying on the hospital bed had a pale complexion and was motionless.

""Karen, when will Mommy wake up?"" he asked.

Karen Crawford lovingly patted his head and replied gently, ""When you grow up to be a good boy, your mommy will surely wake up.""

Mike Hopkins nodded and pressed his cheek softly against the cold glass.

He stared intently at Sarah on the hospital bed, clasping his hands together in front of his chest. ""I'll be good and listen, Mommy. You have to wake up soon. I don't like Yvonne. She always says bad things about you.""

The next moment, it seemed like God had heard Mike's plea. Sarah's fingers twitched ever so slightly.

Mike scrambled to his feet and grabbed Karen's hand tightly. ""Karen, Mommy moved.""

**Chapter 2**

Karen immediately scooped up Mike and rushed to the nurse's station. ""Doctor, Mrs. Hopkins is awake.""

Sarah had been having a very long dream.

In this dream, she was no longer the orphan picking up dirty food in the pouring rain.

She had a loving father, a loving mother, and a brother who cherished her badly.

She was wearing a beautiful white dress, dancing gracefully in a house that looked like a castle. Her parents and brother surrounded her, praising her as the most beautiful little princess in the world.

When she grew tired from dancing, her brother would bring a towel and gently wipe the fine sweat from her forehead. ""Sarah, you danced so well. You are going to be the greatest dancer in Jabrine someday,"" he said.

The little girl giggled at the praise, revealing a set of uneven baby teeth.

But as she laughed, her parents and brother began to fade away. She tried to reach out to them, but they were slipping out of her grasp.

All she could hear was her brother's voice growing fainter and fainter in the air. ""Sarah, you have to hold on. We'll come for you.""

Sarah took a deep breath, like a drowning person, and suddenly opened her eyes wide.

""Dr. Cooper, the patient is finally awake,"" someone said.

Sarah turned her head with great effort and saw Julian Cooper and Mia Bailey. They had been standing by her side the whole time.

She looked around hopefully, but Matthew wasn't here.

Julian's heart finally settled when he saw that Sarah was awake. He let out a sigh of relief and said softly, ""Sarah, you're finally awake. You've been in a coma for far too long.""

Sarah tried to speak but found she couldn't make a sound.

Mia saw Sarah's mouth move and quickly fetched a straw to give her some water. ""Don't worry, Sarah. It's normal that you can't speak after being in a coma for so long. Have some water and you'll feel better.""

After swallowing a few sips of water, the dryness in her throat was somewhat relieved, but her voice was still barely audible. ""Coma? What's going on?""

Mia forced a smile. ""Sarah, you had a near-fatal amniotic fluid embolism during childbirth. You've been unconscious ever since.""

Sarah cleared her throat. ""How long have I been in a coma?""

Julian reached over to change the IV bottle for Sarah. ""Three years.""

Sarah's eyes widened in shock. 'Three years? I have been in a coma for three years. What about my baby? Where is my child?' she wondered.

She turned to Julian. ""Dr. Cooper, where's my baby? Where is my child now?""

Before Julian could respond, the little boy of joy who had been waiting at the door rushed in impatiently.

""Mommy. I'm right here. I'm Mike,"" came the clear, cute voice from the doorway. Sarah looked down, tears welling up in her eyes.

Mike stood up but couldn't even reach the height of her hospital bed. He clung to the railing, staring at her intently.

Sarah looked at this child, connected to her by blood, and felt her heart melt. She couldn't help but gently touch Mike's face. ""Mike, you're my child.""

Mike nuzzled against Sarah's hand, feeling the softness and the familiar scent. Karen had been right. Mommy's touch was the best in the world.

Sarah struggled to pull herself together and lifted Mike onto the hospital bed, holding him tightly in her arms. ""Dr. Cooper, has Matthew come to see me?""

Julian, looking at the reunited mother and child, hesitated before speaking, ""Dr. Hopkins has been busy.""

Sarah, holding her child close, looked at Julian with a hint of despair in her eyes. ""For three years, hasn't he come even once?""

Seeing Sarah's tears flowing more and more, Mike quickly reached out to wipe them away. ""Mommy, don't be sad. Even though Daddy is with Yvonne, I have always been here for you.""

**Chapter 3**

\*\*\*\*\*

Matthew watched Yvonne and Lucia playing and laughing in the courtyard, a smile unconsciously spreading across his lips.

Ever since Yvonne and Lucia had moved into the Hopkins residence, he felt like the once-cold mansion had come to life. He even found himself coming home more often.

Wade placed a cup of coffee beside Matthew's hand. Matthew glanced at Wade and rarely spoke. ""Where's Mike?""

Wade paused for a moment. ""Mike went to see Mrs. Hopkins with Karen.""

Matthew let out a cold laugh. ""Yvonne has been truly devoted to him all these years. I never expected that someone who's been lying in a coma for three years would still matter more.""

Matthew casually turned his face toward Wade. ""He's three now. Do you think he looks like me back then?""

Wade smiled and spoke smoothly. ""Mike carries your bloodline, so naturally, he resembles you.""

""What about Yvonne? You've been with the Hopkins family for so long; you should know,"" Matthew warned.

Wade's response was as impeccable as ever, leaving no room for criticism. ""Ms. Kennedy has grown up with you since childhood. She is naturally a very nice person.""

Matthew fell silent for a long while, just quietly gazing in the direction of Yvonne and Lucia. It was impossible to tell what he was thinking.

Wade's eyes flickered with a hint of pity, but he still asked, ""Should we bring Mike back?""

Matthew shifted his gaze from Yvonne, stood up, and put on his coat, preparing to head to the hospital. ""Let him be. He's three now. If he still can't tell right from wrong, he doesn't deserve to be my son.""

\*\*\*\*\*

As Matthew was just about to leave, he ran into Julian, who had just finished a surgery.

Julian's lips curled into a mocking smile. ""Dr. Hopkins, are you here for surgery?""

Matthew gave a faint nod, not wanting to engage Julian in any conversation. He had always looked down on Julian.

Matthew had been a prodigy in the medical field since childhood, smoothly completing his master's and doctoral degrees.

After graduation, he had directly joined Jabrine Hospital and secured a position in gynecology and obstetrics.

Compared to Matthew, who was a naturally gifted talent, Julian had relied entirely on hard work. He had worked himself to the bone during his internship and graduate studies to become the deputy director of gynecology and obstetrics.

Even the hospital director favored Matthew a bit more.

For Matthew to acknowledge Julian with a greeting was already a sign of respect.

Seeing that Matthew wasn't responding, Julian continued, ""Dr. Hopkins, aren't you at all concerned about how your wife is doing?""

Matthew's lips curled into a cold smile. ""Sarah has been in a coma for three years. What more is there to know?""

Julian's eyes flickered, and a teasing expression appeared on his face. ""So you haven't heard yet?""

""Your wife woke up this morning and is having lunch with Mike right now.""

Matthew's eyebrows furrowed tightly. ""What? She's awake?""

Julian watched as Matthew's expression darkened dramatically. He couldn't help but feel a pang of sympathy for Sarah.

Sarah had been so eager for Matthew to visit her, yet Matthew's face turned darker than a storm cloud at the news of her awakening.

Julian hesitated for a moment, but in the end, he didn't say another word.

As soon as Matthew finished his surgery, he rushed straight to the ward he hadn't set foot in for three years.

If Sarah had woken up and found out that Yvonne had been living in the Hopkins residence all this time, she might try to make things difficult for her. He needed to lay down some ground rules with her first, to prevent any more trouble.

He had just reached the door of the ward when he heard the sound of laughter and playful noise coming from inside. Mike's voice was filled with a kind of happiness that Matthew had never heard before.

**Chapter 4**

Matthew pushed open the door, and there was Mike, tightly hugging Sarah's neck, showing a level of intimacy that was much greater than when he interacted with Yvonne, who had taken care of him for three years.

Matthew clenched his teeth in frustration, and his dislike for Sarah grew even stronger. Blood really did matter; no matter how sincerely Yvonne had treated Mike all these years, she had never earned a single smile from him.

Yet now, just waking up, Sarah could be this close to Mike at their very first meeting. Mike's ability to play people was just like his mother's, who once secretly schemed to sleep with him.

The mother and son, who had been playing, turned their heads toward Matthew at the sound of the door.

He cleared his throat and turned to Karen, who was peeling fruit. ""Karen, take Mike back first. I need to have a word with Mrs. Hopkins.""

Karen nodded, put down the fruit, and moved to pick up Mike.

But Mike squirmed in Sarah's arms, clearly unwilling. ""Daddy, I don't want to go with Karen. I want to stay with Mommy.""

Sarah, noticing the conflicted look on Matthew's face, gently patted Mike's back. ""Mike, be a good boy and go with Karen for now. Your dad needs to talk to me.""

Mike glanced at Sarah's face, and only then did he reluctantly climb down from the bed, though he was still very reluctant.

He clung to Sarah's hand and muttered, ""I'll come to see you again tomorrow, Mommy. You have to stay awake and not fall asleep again.""

After a bit of a struggle, Karen finally managed to take Mike away.

Matthew closed the door behind them, pulled up a chair, and sat down beside Sarah's hospital bed.

Sarah looked at the man who had left her on the operating table and hadn't visited her in three years, and tears welled up in her eyes. ""Matthew, why haven't you come to see me all these years?""

Matthew pursed his lips, thinking of a thousand things to say but unable to get any words out.

Even if Sarah wasn't the wife he had originally wanted, she had still risked her life to give birth to his son. It was wrong of him not to have visited her even once in all these years.

""Sarah, you know I'm the head of gynecology and obstetrics, and I've also been busy with the affairs of the Hopkins family. I really haven't had the time,"" he murmured.

Sarah, thinking of all the grievances she had suffered and hearing Matthew's feeble excuse, suddenly burst into anger. ""Matthew, just how busy have you been that you couldn't come to see me even once in three years?

""And tell me, where were you when my life and my child's life were hanging in the balance on the operating table?""

Matthew didn't expect the usually gentle and considerate woman to question him so aggressively, and he couldn't help but frown. ""Sarah, you know I'm the chief physician of gynecology and obstetrics. All the pregnant women are my patients. I can't possibly be by your side all the time.""

He rubbed his temples as if he were exhausted. ""Sarah, stop making a fuss. I just got off a three-hour surgery, and I'm really tired.""

Sarah looked at his displeased expression and felt like she had never really known him at all.

He had abandoned his wife and child to be with his first love during childbirth, and now he was turning things around, accusing her of being willful and unreasonable.

Sarah took a deep breath and held back the tears that were threatening to spill. ""Alright, then tell me, which patient were you operating on when you abandoned us?""

If Matthew could admit that he had left her to be with Yvonne, Sarah would finally give up on him completely.

**Chapter 5**

After all, if he could openly say that she was just his second choice, then he clearly didn't love her anymore. He wouldn't even bother lying to her anymore.

But Sarah didn't hear what she wanted to hear from Matthew.

His brows were furrowed tightly, and his face was very dark. ""Sarah, just because I didn't perform your surgery, are you going to accuse me of having an affair with another patient? Sarah, when did you become so vicious? I'm really disappointed in you.""

Sarah smiled bitterly. This was the man she had loved for three years. He had betrayed her and their child, yet he lacked the courage to even admit it.

She wasn't sure whether to feel relieved that he was still pretending in front of her or to despise his constant hypocrisy.

""Matthew, do you really want me to spell it out for you? I already know that you left Mike and me to go save Yvonne back then,"" she said, looking into his suddenly panicked eyes. ""But you can't even bring yourself to admit it.""

Matthew suppressed the flicker of panic inside him and looked at Sarah coldly. ""So what if I did operate on Yvonne? You owed her that much. Besides, you're a medical school student; you know how high the mortality rate of amniotic fluid embolism is.

""I was just trying to save a patient with a higher chance of survival. What's wrong with that?""

Listening to Matthew's excuses, Sarah felt the last shred of hope within her vanish. It was as if she could hear her heart shattering.

She wanted to cry, but the hot tears that had been burning in her eyes wouldn't fall anymore.

""Abandoning your wife and child to save your childhood sweetheart. How selfless of you, Matthew,"" she said sarcastically.

She couldn't rely on this deceitful, spineless man any longer. She would do whatever it took to take Mike away from the Hopkins family.

Sarah closed her eyes and leaned back against the bed in despair. ""Matthew, let's get a divorce. I was the one who wrongfully took Yvonne's place as your wife back then. Now, I'll give everything back to you.""

Matthew didn't respond, just let out a soft, mocking laugh. He touched Sarah's forehead, his tone uncharacteristically teasing. ""Sarah, you don't have a fever, do you? Why are you talking nonsense?""

Sarah swatted his hand away in disgust, her gaze cold. ""Matthew, I'm not joking. The moment you left Mike and me for Yvonne, we were already over.""

She turned her head to look at the crayon drawing Mike had eagerly brought for her. The two stick figures, drawn with crooked lines, were smiling happily; they represented her and Mike.

""You can keep all your money. I just want you to let me take Mike with me,"" she added.

Hearing this, Matthew knew Sarah had made up her mind.

In the year they had been married, he had come to understand her somewhat. Once she made a decision, nothing could change her mind.

He stood up and looked at Sarah coldly. ""Fine, you can have the divorce, but the child stays with me. He's the blood of the Hopkins family and cannot be allowed to wander outside.""

Matthew unconsciously twirled the platinum ring on his pinky finger, thinking for a moment. ""As compensation, I can give you the villa on the outskirts of town and the penthouse in the city center.""

Sarah felt a lump in her throat and almost cried. Matthew had already considered the possibility of divorcing her. He had even planned out the compensation he would offer her.

'Has he spent these three years I was in a coma, figuring out how to divorce me and then marry Yvonne?' Sarah wondered. 'What about the grievances I have endured in the Hopkins residence over the past year, the gentle care I have shown Matthew-what do all that mean?'

**Chapter 6**

""No way, I won't give up the child. Mike is still young. Even if we go to court, the child will be awarded to me,"" she said firmly.

Matthew's lips curled into a mocking smile. ""Sarah, it seems that even after all these years with the Hopkins family, you still haven't learned. If I want to keep the child within the Hopkins family, you won't have the power to take him away.""

Sarah's face turned pale. She knew Matthew was right. As an orphan, she couldn't possibly stand up to the Hopkins family, who had deep roots in Jabrine. She needed to think this through carefully.

Seeing Sarah's silence, Matthew thought she was about to give in. ""Sarah, although we've only been married for a year, we did have some feelings for each other. I don't want to resort to underhanded tactics against you. Wouldn't it be better if we parted ways amicably?""

With that, he headed for the door. Just as he was about to leave, Matthew turned his head and added, ""But don't even think about making things difficult for Yvonne. If I find out you're going to harm Yvonne, you won't get any of that compensation.""

After that argument, Matthew never came back. Even Mike, who was under Matthew's control, hadn't visited for several days.

After finishing the last bottle of IV fluid for the day, Sarah lay back against the pillow, bored and listless.

She was staring blankly at the potted plant in the ward when Margot Hopkins, accompanied by four bodyguards and several large boxes of gifts, entered the room.

Margot was well-preserved; though in her forties, she showed little sign of age.

She directed the bodyguards to put down the gifts and then sat down beside Sarah's hospital bed.

She glanced at Sarah's still pale face, her eyes flickering with a brief look of disdain before she smiled and said, ""Sarah, now that you're finally awake, my heart is at ease. With you here to raise Mike properly within the Hopkins family, I can rest easy.""

Sarah knew Margot was already aware of her plans to divorce Matthew. By mentioning Mike, Margot was trying to use him as leverage.

""Mr. Hopkins, Matthew and I can't go on like this. He abandoned me when I needed him the most, to save another woman. If it weren't for Dr. Cooper, Mike might not have survived at all,"" Sarah said.

Margot lowered her eyes, a rare flicker of guilt crossing her face.

Matthew had indeed been in the wrong. But then again, if Sarah hadn't taken Yvonne's place, Yvonne would have been Mike's mother. Matthew's abandonment was just what Sarah deserved.

""Sarah, now that you've given birth to a child for our family, you should settle down and focus on being a good wife and mother within the Hopkins family. Stop entertaining these absurd thoughts,"" Margot said firmly.

Sarah let out a cold laugh, looking at the well-nourished woman in front of her, whose good health was thanks to the medication Sarah had provided. She felt all her previous kindness toward the Hopkins family had been in vain.

""Absurd thoughts? Mrs. Hopkins, I don't understand what you're saying,"" Sarah sneered.

Margot took a deep breath, trying to keep her tone even. ""Sarah, although I didn't approve of you initially and wasn't optimistic about your marriage to Matthew, you've given us such a healthy and adorable grandson. I'm more than satisfied with you. But I've heard rumors that you're planning to divorce Matthew.""

Margot took Sarah's left hand and patted it gently. ""A woman should know when to be content. You have a handsome husband, a comfortable family, and a lovely son. What more could you want?""

Sarah looked down at Margot's delicate hand and curled her lips. ""Content? With what exactly? Mrs. Hopkins, if your husband had abandoned you during a medical emergency to tend to another woman, could you just brush it off and forgive him so easily?""

i had ecola infection of the urinary tract but its fully treated now, but the symptoms remain as they were, constant burning, feeling like im always holding in pee despite im not, frequent urination, weaker erections, ejaculations are less pleasant (they sometimes sort of feel like im just pissing), when i cough after ejaculating i always get something like a cramp of the penis? im not sure how to call it, its painful and like vibrating (this also happens when i vomit)?. And it was like this for around 2 years

uroflowmetry and urine tests show everything is fine,

now my urologists wants me to decide if i want to do urodynamics for free in 2.5 years funded by insurance or for 200‚Ç¨ in 2 months (i can afford it but its still painful to pay this much for something that may even not help me), also he wants me to visit a psychiatrist (he says the symptoms may be caused by anxiety/stress (i do have a few symptoms of depression/anxiety so it is very possible its related)), which is gonna be half a year from now if i do it for free through ensurance fund or even tommorow if im willing to pay 50‚Ç¨. my urologist also wants to see my voiding diary that i just did

urodynamics is probably gonna say everything is fine too.

currently what im doing is trying to avoid stress, take supplements (quercetin, curcumin, paw salmetto, magnesium), trying to avoid any coffeine/theine, spicy food, sweets, salt, nicotine, alcohol, weed, masturbation, sitting, i always sit while pissing unless its public toilet, then its too disgusting for me, i take hot baths and im going to start swimming more often soon

heres my voiding diary i made a few days ago

My Billionaire Best Friend Is My Groom Now Novel_ I leaned against the wall, carefully cradling my six-month bump as I waited for my prenatal checkup.","Chapter 1  
  
I leaned against the wall, carefully cradling my six-month bump as I waited for my prenatal checkup.  
  
Once the scheduled examination was done, I planned to visit my husband Aiden‚Äîmaybe we could head home together.  
  
After all, the rain was coming down hard outside. The rideshare app showed nearly 200 people ahead of me in the queue, and my phone signal kept cutting out sporadically.  
  
Aiden wasn't scheduled for specialist clinic duty today, but one of his team's doctor colleagues had called in sick last minute. So he'd been forced to cover a half-day shift.  
  
The heavy smell of disinfectant in the hospital corridors mixed with the damp scent of the downpour outside, making me nauseous.  
  
The waiting area was packed. Children crying, anxious inquiries, nurses trying to maintain order‚Äîall the sounds blended together into a headache-inducing chaos.  
  
I found an empty spot on the bench outside the obstetrics office and had just settled down when I spotted Aiden's tall figure emerging from a consultation room.  
  
He wore his crisp white coat, pressed to perfection, his face still bearing the exhaustion from last night's surgery.  
  
But his gaze swept across the crowd with that familiar sharpness and... intensity. This was the Aiden I knew‚Äîcalm, efficient, completely intolerant of chaos or rule-breaking.  
  
As one of the youngest deputy chief cardiologists at a top New York hospital, his professionalism and strict adherence to protocol were practically carved into his bones.  
  
I'd always considered this a strength.  
  
Just as I was about to call out to him, I saw a figure skillfully weaving through the queue, heading straight for Aiden's office.  
  
That silhouette... was that Vera?  
  
I frowned. Vera was an intern who'd joined the department just over a month ago. Young, pretty, always flashing that sweet smile.  
  
My first impression of her at the hospital had been positive‚Äîa breath of youthful energy.  
  
But here was the problem: she shouldn't be anywhere near Aiden.  
  
Or more precisely, she shouldn't be appearing in such a... privileged way.  
  
Because Aiden had a habitual ""rule""‚Äîto avoid unnecessary complications and distractions, all the interns and assistants he worked with were exclusively male.  
  
This wasn't something he'd actively demanded, but after several young female doctors had tried to ""get close"" through various methods‚Äî""accidentally"" spilling water, messing up reports, asking for ""guidance"" until late at night‚ÄîAiden had had enough.  
  
He'd requested that the training office only assign male interns to his team.  
  
Over time, it became an unspoken understanding within the department.  
  
Even the administrative assistants knew to simply leave documents on his desk‚Äîavoiding any accidental contact with Dr. Aiden.  
  
So what was Vera doing here?  
  
""Aiden!"" Vera's voice carried that deliberately soft sweetness. ""Sorry to bother you, but my stomach pain is really severe...""  
  
Aiden turned slightly. I couldn't even catch the change in his expression before I saw him raise his hand to pull open the consultation room door, gesturing for Vera to enter.  
  
Then, facing the patients and their families who'd been waiting outside for ages, he said flatly: ""Please wait. Handling an emergency.""  
  
Complaints erupted immediately.  
  
""Are you kidding me? We've been waiting all morning!""  
  
""Emergency? That girl looked perfectly healthy just now.""  
  
""Yeah, isn't Dr. Aiden supposed to be the most by-the-book guy here? Line-cutting?""  
  
Aiden's expression didn't budge an inch, as if those voices simply didn't exist.  
  
He was about to close the door when his gaze inadvertently swept across the crowd and landed on me in the corner.  
  
For a split second, I saw surprise flash in Aiden's eyes. Then it shifted into something almost imperceptible... annoyance?  
  
But he said nothing. With a sharp ""bang,"" he shut the consultation room door, blocking out everyone's stares.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
My heart plummeted. Ten minutes? Twenty minutes? The consultation room door remained firmly shut.  
  
The complaints outside grew louder, nurses tried to calm people down, but it was no use.  
  
An icy sensation spread through my limbs. Not from the air conditioning‚Äîbut from knowing that behind that closed door lay territory I, as his wife, rarely set foot in, yet another young woman had effortlessly claimed.  
  
Even with Aiden himself breaking the rules.  
  
Finally, the door opened. Vera emerged holding a payment slip, her cheeks flushed, eyes bright‚Äîshowing absolutely no signs of the ""severe abdominal pain"" she'd mentioned earlier.  
  
She walked toward the payment counter with light steps.  
  
As she passed by me, she even shot me a look that carried triumph, almost defiant in its smugness.  
  
Aiden followed, his expression restored to its usual calm, as if he'd never broken any rules at all.  
  
He looked at me, not giving me a chance to speak: ""Almost off duty.  
  
Finished with your checkup? I still have a few patients‚Äîafter that I'll drive you home. Too much rain outside, rideshares are impossible.""  
  
I said nothing.  
  
The crushing disappointment and sense of betrayal left me heartbroken. I followed Aiden silently to his break room to wait.  
  
Every minute of waiting felt endless.  
  
The break room still carried the faint scent of jasmine perfume‚ÄîVera's fragrance from earlier.  
  
I stared at the neatly arranged files on Aiden's desk and the no-smoking sign beside them, remembering that argument from a month ago.  
  
I'd just finished throwing up from morning sickness and felt suddenly hungry.  
  
When I went to see Aiden, I brought only the mildest lemon water‚ÄîI knew how sensitive he was to strong smells.  
  
But when I took a sip in his office, Aiden said coldly: ""Tina, this is a hospital, not a coffee shop. That smell will linger for hours‚Äîit could affect my clinical judgment. Please don't eat or drink anything in here again.""  
  
Just one sip of water. Aiden had used such harsh, cold phrasing as ""affecting judgment.""  
  
And now, Vera, merely an ""intern,"" had not only broken Aiden's rule about working with female interns, but had also been privileged enough to skip the crowded clinic queue and enter his consultation room because of a ""stomach ache""?  
  
Yet her lingering jasmine fragrance‚Äîwouldn't that affect his ""professional judgment""?  
  
When Aiden returned after seeing his last patient, I was standing by the window, watching the storm outside. ""Let's go."" He grabbed his car keys. ""I parked in the basement garage, no need to get soaked.""  
  
The underground garage felt somewhat damp from the storm's penetration. Aiden's black SUV sat in the spacious parking spot.  
  
When I reached the car, Aiden didn't immediately unlock it, instead looking toward the passenger side.  
  
I followed his gaze and saw the passenger door open.  
  
Vera poked her head out, her face a picture of ""surprise"" and ""apology"": ""Tina? Oh my God‚ÄîI'm so sorry! Earlier, Aiden saw I couldn't get a ride and with this terrible rain, he offered to drop me home... I didn't mean to intrude. Aiden, maybe I should sit in the back?""  
  
She pretended to unbuckle her seatbelt to get out, but Aiden simply unlocked the rear doors and said to me: ""Get in.""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Then Aiden turned back to Vera, his tone noticeably softer, carrying a hint of reassurance he probably wasn't even aware of: ""It's fine, stay put. You're soaked out there.""  
  
Vera sweetly said ""okay"" and settled back into her seat. Her face still wore that apologetic expression, but her eyes betrayed her current smugness.  
  
I supported my bump and awkwardly maneuvered into the back seat. The car started up and smoothly pulled out of the garage. We drove into the storm.  
  
The car shut out the wind and rain, but it couldn't shut out the silence inside. Aiden broke it first, his voice calm: ""Vera's apartment is pretty far. We'll drop her off first.""  
  
I said nothing, and the last shred of hope in my heart completely vanished. From the hospital to our home was normally a ten-minute drive. But Vera's apartment was in the complete opposite direction‚Äîthis ""far"" was definitely not just a little out of the way.  
  
I watched their silhouettes. Vera seemed a bit cold, arms wrapped around herself. Aiden immediately reached over to turn up the heat near the passenger seat.  
  
Vera said something quietly. Aiden tilted his head slightly, actually smiling, and responded in low tones. I clenched my fists, my body trembling involuntarily. Aiden was completely ignoring me.  
  
The warm air from the heater mixed with Vera's jasmine scent, wafting back toward me in waves. Pregnancy had made my sense of smell acute‚Äîin that moment, it made me nauseous.  
  
Instinctively, I cracked the window open slightly. A blast of cold, rain-laden air immediately rushed in. ""Ah!"" Vera let out a shriek from the passenger seat, dramatically hunching her shoulders. ""So cold!""  
  
Aiden glanced at me through the rearview mirror, his eyes showing displeasure: ""It's pouring. Close the window! Getting the car wet makes it smell worse.""  
  
My heart felt like it was being crushed by a giant fist. Three days ago, just because I'd taken that sip of lemon water in his office, he hadn't spoken to me since. But now?  
  
Vera could sit in his passenger seat wearing perfume, enjoying the heat he'd turned up for her. Just because she complained about being cold, Aiden immediately blamed me for opening the window.  
  
Principles? Rules?  
  
Apparently they only applied to me.  
  
A wave of nausea surged from my stomach, the baby kicking hard‚Äîmaybe sensing my emotional turmoil.  
  
I closed my eyes, took a deep breath of the cold air streaming through the window, forcing myself to stay calm. Then I expressionlessly rolled the window back up.  
  
The car returned to its enclosed warmth. But Vera's mood hadn't immediately recovered. She began complaining softly: ""This weather is awful. I should have grabbed a jacket before leaving.""  
  
""Are you hungry?"" Aiden suddenly asked, his voice surprisingly gentle. The car happened to be passing a brightly lit convenience store.  
  
Vera hesitated: ""Well... a little. I always seem to get hungrier when I'm not feeling well...""  
  
Aiden immediately put on his turn signal and smoothly pulled into the convenience store parking lot. Without looking at me, he unbuckled his seatbelt: ""Wait here.""  
  
Rain hammered against Aiden's umbrella as he got out, instantly soaking half his pant legs. He didn't seem to care, heading straight into the store.  
  
A few minutes later, he returned with dampness clinging to him and water droplets on his clothes. He handed Vera a hot cocoa and a paper bag containing a warm cinnamon roll.  
  
""Eat it while it's hot,"" his voice was low and caring. ""Warm your stomach.""  
  
Sweet, buttery, rich cinnamon scent immediately filled the small car interior. I watched Aiden's soaked sleeves and shoulders, watched the concern in his eyes as he handed Vera the food.  
  
In that instant, I gave up completely. I thought of countless late nights when Aiden came home exhausted after surgery, how I'd tiptoe around, not daring to make a sound for fear of disturbing his rest, because he'd said he hated being bothered most of all.  
  
I thought of all his prohibitions: the cleanliness of private spaces, the ban on eating in his office, the strict boundaries in personal relationships... I'd spent nine careful years maintaining all of Aiden's principles.  
  
Turns out, every rule could be broken.

Abbot‚Äôs reaction to Alex‚Äôs plant to call the Corvin *The Titanic* - including ‚ÄòThe‚Äô as part of the name had arrived in a moment of serendipity - got everybody‚Äôs attention, and coated the table in front of him in a fine layer of tea.

Alex had never seen someone actually do a spit take before. He wished he had not been seated across from Abbot when it had happened.

This of course led to Alex spending a good half hour defending this choice with enough of a shit eating grin that everyone knew he was putting them on. Just having a bit of a jape. His personal favorite reason was that as it was going to be the largest ship they knew about for who knows how far, it being the *The Titanic* just fit. That there were no airborne icebergs was a close second. About half the crew eventually came around. Williams gave it a very tongue in cheek endorsement as well.

Several good alternatives had come up. Alex had liked *Gigantic*, *Majestic*, and *Immortal* as a direct alternative for *The Titanic*, even if he wasn‚Äôt really going to be using it. *Civilian Applications* was funny if you had seen the Culture movies. *Flighty Boy* had amused him as well. Sergeant Karras floated *Shuttley McShuttle Face* and that had gotten a french fry thrown at the marine *while* he was being yelled at by all the Humans in the room. Conversely, Amalu had suggested *Anka‚Äôo* in an incredibly earnest manner - the very same name that Sergeant Zenshen had floated, but with the glottal stop that raised it from a function or job to a living embodiment of something. That was a bit much for an eight seat shuttle.

Alex wasn‚Äôt going to use any of them, and he never let slip what he was really thinking about calling it.

After the rather enjoyable banter surrounding naming the ship, even with a couple of cups of coffee in his system, Alex was beat. He wasn‚Äôt the first to depart, but he was pretty close, heading back down to Barracks 3 for the evening. It was cold but the snow was so light he left the faceplate on the helmet flipped up. A little fresh air was nice, even if it stung to breathe. The buildings were only about a minute apart if you hustled, anyway.

He just went and got ready for bed. Parked his armor, got clothes to sleep in. Zheng, Tokona, Amalu, and Crenshaw filtered in through two cycles of the airlock. Alex thought about slinking off to his bunk before any of them noticed him - difficult given both Amalu and Crenshaw had seen him standing there in the head while he brushed his teeth, Crenshaw on his way to take off his armor, Amalu headed for the showers.

A little bit more socializing would probably do him good. ‚ÄúHey, hey, hey. How‚Äôs everybody doing?‚Äù

Linda was the first to respond, yelling from her room. ‚ÄúHey Sorenson. How about the *Beagle*?‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean, it had a fairly big role in some scientific events... I feel like something happened to its first Captain, but I don‚Äôt remember what.‚Äù Alex was pretty sure that guy died bad. ‚ÄúGiven I‚Äôll be the first pilot, I think I‚Äôll pass.‚Äù

‚ÄúThought I heard you out here.‚Äù Crenshaw returned, dressed like he was about to continue his day - Naval deck trousers and a combat shirt. Bit of an odd combo, but he was a Navy employee by choice. They exchanged a fist bump and Dominic took a seat in the chairs that had been left in the hall. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs the hanger coming along?‚Äù

‚ÄúGood, got all the lighting, the ATC pod, and the crane installed. The walls are finishing their extrusion tonight, should be ready for the shuttle tomorrow.‚Äù Alex just leaned against the wall. He felt like he‚Äôd zone out if he sat down, or just fall asleep.

Crenshaw was a good guy, but he also had the energy of someone who would draw on your face if you fell asleep around him. Alex was past that part of his life, so he would not take the chance.

‚ÄúRight on schedule. I‚Äôve heard we‚Äôre getting some gravcycles, too.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, supposed to be getting two NS-12 Falcata‚Äôs. I don‚Äôt know who here has clearance for them. I‚Äôd guess Williams and Karras, at most.‚Äù Alex shrugged. It made sense that the two highest ranking marines would have some experience with what amounted to ride-on rockets. It wasn‚Äôt his problem to worry about.

‚ÄúWhy do they need clearance for a gravcycle?‚Äù He asked, apparently unaware of what a Falcata was.

‚ÄúOh, shit, let me take this - my first project with the Navy was overhauling three hundred original NS-12‚Äôs into NS-12j spec.‚Äù Zheng had come back out to the hallway, also dressed like she was going to bed soon.

Crenshaw nodded, a little worried at the enthusiasm there. ‚ÄúUh huh.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo the Falc shares compatibility with parts from the Tyrfing loitering anti-ship missile. The reactor and engine, and half the shielding components were lifted directly from it. All the rest is unique, but that‚Äôs the expensive parts.‚Äù Zhen was happy as can be to explain this stuff to somebody. ‚ÄúThis is the coolest part, in my opinion: in atmosphere, it uses interlocked shielding - the same stuff the Tsla‚Äôo use on their armor instead of helmets - to project selectively non-permeable surfaces for lift and control. In space that‚Äôs just used purely for protection.‚Äù 

Amalu returned from his shower, giving Alex a nod before settling into the empty chair across from Zheng. He leaned in, interested in what Linda was talking about, or at least faking it really well. Crenshaw‚Äôs outfit made a little more sense seeing what Amalu was wearing, the usual uniform pants and the military issue *daman* that looked like a tank top. Suppose they didn‚Äôt issue anything to sleep in, or it was just the *daman*.

‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs a missile you can ride?‚Äù Crenshaw had unknowingly set Linda upon a topic that she knew exceedingly well, and was looking for a way to curtail it sooner rather than later. Unfortunately, this knowledge had raised some questions for him. ‚ÄúWhat is that even used for? How do people survive flying that?‚Äù

‚ÄúSpeeds are limited to 100kph unless the wearer is equipped with powered armor. The top speed is said to be 1500 in atmosphere, but the Navy tends to understate capability.‚Äù There was a tone in her voice that said she knew what it really was, but was not supposed to actually say. ‚ÄúMain use case is delivering special forces.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen why did we get two of them?‚Äù Crenshaw was, understandably, a little concerned about that now.

It did raise some questions for Alex, too. Those were effectively cruise missiles. Not much bang on the front, but even a small reactor is dangerous when the pressure vessel becomes an open container at high speed. He doubted it would take a lot of mods to make it remotely operated, or turn it into a loitering munition proper.

Linda shook her head. ‚ÄúNo idea. If I had to guess, somebody probably thought we could use them to scout on the ground at relatively close locations.‚Äù 

‚ÄúShit, all right. They can have fun with that.‚Äù Crenshaw shook his head, not inclined to mess around with a vehicle that went that fast and offered no protection aside from shielding.

‚ÄúInteresting as this is, I think I‚Äôm going to go wind down.‚Äù Alex gave the group a little nod and retreated to the 

Alex sat at the desk, stared at the window in its frosted over privacy setting, and contemplated life. Something he probably shouldn‚Äôt be doing right at this moment. 

It was good to see the crew in general getting along. Alex had thought about hanging out with the rest of Barracks 3 while waiting for his wife- Bunk mate. Waiting for his bunk mate to show up as well. But he really only wanted to spend some surreptitious quality time with Carbon right now. Failing that, the inside of his eyelids would make a reasonable second choice

Alex actually found that really annoying. It wasn‚Äôt late at all. Today had not been a physically difficult day, nor a particularly taxing one mentally aside from a few technological puzzles and a hint of time management. He was completely sure that Abbot had done more labor than he had, even if their words guy was plugged into an external power source while doing so.

It wasn‚Äôt even keeping secrets, either. That had come with surprising ease, as it was just how things had been a few months ago. The memory was fresh.

He heard the main door cycle, and everybody greeted Carbon. They spoke for a few moments and she parked her armor in the frame just on the other side of the wall and walked in, closing the door behind her. She was wearing a robe that Alex had never seen her wear before. Electric blue that matched her eyes, silky looking. He wasn‚Äôt sure what exactly made him think this, but it had a distinctly human look to it. It was just a robe, though. A silky robe that wasn‚Äôt fastened very well and hung open a little bit and he could see thigh as she walked.

*Don‚Äôt comment on that, don‚Äôt comment on that, don‚Äôt comment on that.*

‚ÄúHey Lan. Burning the midnight oil?‚Äù Whew.

Wait. She didn‚Äôt come in here to get the robe and it hadn‚Äôt been in the hall when he came in. Where the hell had she gotten it?

‚ÄúIt-‚Äù Carbon stopped abruptly when she really looked at his face. Visibly alarmed. ‚ÄúIt is not yet midnight, but you look very tired.‚Äù

He sighed. Really shouldn‚Äôt have been sitting here stewing. ‚ÄúI feel very tired. I don‚Äôt think I slept very well last night and the excitement of being back here has worn off.‚Äù That was the crux of it. Interesting tasks and some fun banter had carried him along the day pretty well, but he was crashing.

‚ÄúYou should go to bed instead of...‚Äù Carbon looked around the room, squinting and suspicious. Her gaze swept over him and the empty desk, not even a cup sitting on it. ‚ÄúWere you staring at the wall?‚Äù

Alex laughed nervously, scratching the back of his head. ‚ÄúNo, I was staring at the window.‚Äù

She looked up at the window, the privacy setting still engaged and absolutely nothing visible through it. Carbon‚Äôs gaze returned to him slowly, dark lips pulled thin, obvious concern written on her face. ‚ÄúPerhaps you should go to bed.‚Äù

‚ÄúI just wanted to make sure everyone was in first.‚Äù Had he? He wanted to see her before going to bed more than anything, and since she was the last one in, it made sense in a roundabout, complete bullshit sort of way.

‚ÄúWell, as I saw that everyone else is here, you have no one left to wait for.‚Äù She shooed him from the chair, ushering him towards the bunks. ‚ÄúYou should go to bed.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll right, all right. I‚Äôm going.‚Äù Once out of the range of the camera in the door controls, he did sneak a hug. 

Carbon returned it with enthusiasm.

‚ÄúIs that silk?‚Äù Alex asked, voice low as he leaned on the ladder to his bunk.

‚ÄúPrinted, but yes.‚Äù She pinched the collar of the robe between two fingers, testing the fabric. ‚ÄúFrom a moth larva, originally. Fascinating.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is, yeah, but... Where did you get it?‚Äù

‚ÄúZheng suggested it as a test run on one of the matter compilers, and as a potential avenue to deal with the nudity issue. It is very light.‚Äù She gestured at the hemline, roughly knee height on her, and did a little twirl to demonstrate. ‚ÄúWhat do you think?‚Äù

It was cute in a way he thought was distinctly Human. Alex was completely sure that she‚Äôd never done that before, he would have remembered his brain shutting off like it just did as the hem of her robe briefly overcame the pull of gravity and revealed that yes, she was naked under there. ‚ÄúLove it.‚Äù Now, where she had picked up that move was a question for another day.

Carbon smiled, quite pleased with that as she went to get some more clothes. ‚ÄúI am glad. Now, as the Lan on this expedition, I must request that you get more rest for your physical and mental health.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I get it. If you need me for anything, I‚Äôll be in my bunk.‚Äù He climbed the slightly too flexible ladder and landed on his mattress like a dead weight. Even that little display wasn‚Äôt enough to overcome how tired he felt. ‚ÄúNight.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood night, Pilot.‚Äù Carbon favored him with another little smile as she pulled her *daman* on.

He was out before he even thought to slide the privacy shutter closed.

He stayed out until he noticed someone fuzzy trying to crawl over him in pitch dark in the very limited space of his bunk. Alex grumbled softly, shifting so his back was against the cool polymer wall. ‚ÄúThat had better be you.‚Äù

Alex swore to all of the Tsla‚Äôo hells, if this was anyone but his wife...

The soft chuckle that came in reply could only belong to Carbon. ‚ÄúOf course it is. I always lock the door.‚Äù She slid the privacy shutters most of the way closed.

‚ÄúMmh, figured. Get scared or something?‚Äù

There was a smile in her voice. ‚ÄúNo. Midnight has finally arrived, so I am here for a little celebration.‚Äù

Well, ok. It was fine that Carbon remembered his birthday. Expected, actually, given how good she was at remembering important dates and the marriage thing. ‚ÄúI suppose that‚Äôs a good reason for a visit.‚Äù

‚ÄúI told Williams that I seemed to recall you saying that you prefer a more private celebration when she mentioned it earlier. Family, close friends.‚Äù She slipped a hot hand under his shirt and slid it up his side. ‚ÄúI suspect she will recommend that everyone not make a... ‚Äòbig deal‚Äô out of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Nothing fancy.‚Äù He nodded, still half asleep as he pulled her close.

‚ÄúI did not bring you a gift, but I was thinking perhaps I could still give you something...‚Äù Carbon said in a very coy tone as she slipped her hand under his shirt and slid down his abdomen, palm searing hot against his skin.

Alex was now a hundred percent awake, possibly even a hundred and ten percent. ‚ÄúW-well... Who am I to say no?‚Äù

Everything is starting to come together, and Alex doesn't like big parties.

Certainly they won't throw him a big party, right?

So an unrelated question for you all. Do you folks like other social medias? Even though I'm on the tail end of this story, I still want to reach out to people better, expand the scope of people who read Bridgebuilder. Is a Discord server something folks still dig? Is that rizz or ohio? 

I don't think I slang very good anymore.

my mom's side is easy: two years ago i had a small disagreement with a cousin of mine - that's all it took for that side

little prelude to my dads side:
my dad is a full blown narcissist with alcohol problems. my brother has always been the golden child.

my dad (narc parent) on the other hand just threatened legal action and to kick me out of the house he gifted me (i legally own it) because ive had the gall to ask my brother to respect my house rules. 
when we inherited the house, we'd agreed that we'd share it (my brother and i). he built a studio in there but didn't move in - i moved in and have my job right next to it. 
once the studio was done, he'd come in whenever without telling me ever, he'd eat my food and drink my coffee and he'd make demands on how i should use the money of the loan i'd take out (havent yet) to restore the house.
the way he treated me made my mental health plummet and i was experiencing pretty heavy suicidal thoughts for weeks on end.

by the way, i pay literally all the bills for this house. we agreed on a sum he'd contribute every month that he never paid and once i actually asked him for the money he said it's way too much for the space he has. by that point i hadn't felt safe in my house for a few weeks. 
what followed were three talks. the first two were bad, he made demands upon demands and couldn't see eye to eye with me on anything. 
i turned shit around with the third talk - gave him 3 conditions (money + treat the house and me with respect) or a due date for him to have moved out by. the thing we fought over the most was treating me with respect.
we also agreed a bunch of times to not involve our dad because we were both afraid of his reaction to the whole thing.

now it's a good 6 weeks later. the due date is in two weeks.
my brother at least wrote me whenever he'd come to the house for like 2 weeks. then he stopped.
today, my dad was over to take our car and all of a sudden he said ""i got legal council before i came over here"".
turns out, my brother had kept him in the loop since the beginning. he's threatening legal action through some loophole in the gifting contract and has made threats of charging me rent or kicking me out (this not explicitly). at the same time he says that my brother shouldnt have to pay a cent for the house bc he ""doesnt live here"" and that i should be glad im not paying rent to my dad.
i told him that id like to explain my perspective on the whole thing but ofc he doesn't want to hear that.

i'm honestly still just shocked.
but i have a plan.
i'll get legal council and if i own the house, they're never stepping foot in here again.
if i don't, i'm going to get all the bills ive paid back from them and leave.",3,1752491009.0,narcissisticparents,2,0.8,False
1lzjfz2,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/14/trump-megabill-budget-nightmare-states-00449924,Trump‚Äôs megabill is creating a budget nightmare for states,"President Donald Trump‚Äôs landmark legislation is driving a giant hole in governors‚Äô budgets in a midterm year.

By slashing health care and food assistance for low-income Americans, Republicans in Washington are passing tremendous costs onto the states, leaving local leaders from both parties grasping for ways to make up for billions in lost federal dollars. The cuts are already threatening to endanger governors‚Äô education, public safety and disaster relief funds. 

And this is all happening as up to 20 state leaders face reelection in 2026, forcing them to figure out how to message the fallout as their parties battle for control over the House next year.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt put these budgets together that have a lot of fluff and rainy day funds that are easily accessible,‚Äù said Democratic Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, who chairs the Democratic Governors Association. ‚ÄúAll of us are trying to figure out how to mitigate the damage that will be done to our constituents.‚Äù
Kelly, whose term ends next year, said governors across the country are now in ‚Äúa world of hurt and concern.‚Äù

In deep blue New York, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul is contending with an $11 billion budget hole as she faces reelection next year, possibly against Trump acolyte Rep. Elise Stefanik. Some 2,500 miles away in Arizona, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs is warning the state can‚Äôt even begin to cover the losses from the federal legislation passed earlier this month. And in Nevada, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has to try to persuade his voters of the merits of his party‚Äôs tax cuts geared toward the working class as he runs for reelection, even though he too has warned against slashing Medicaid.

It all amounts to a serious financial problem that‚Äôs even more acute for governors up for reelection next year. Many will have to decide between politically unpopular tax hikes or further changes to Medicaid that could kick more people off the program. State leaders have begun crunching numbers as they try to account for the looming funding gap.


Kelly‚Äôs fellow Democratic governors are shackled with the same budget constrictions as Republicans ‚Äî and similarly will face fallout. But despite the impending headache, the party sees political upside. Democrats intend to slam Republicans in the midterms over their cuts to Medicaid and food assistance in order to pay for tax cuts that largely benefit the wealthy. That message will be a centerpiece of the minority party‚Äôs midterm strategy, and they‚Äôre anticipating voters will blame the GOP when they lose Medicaid coverage or experience the closure of a local hospital.

In a twist that stands to advantage Democratic governors, many of the GOP-backed cuts won‚Äôt take effect until after next year‚Äôs elections ‚Äî a provision Republicans instituted to armor itself.

‚ÄúWhile the legislation is terrible, it is good ammo for governors in battleground states,‚Äù said Matt Grodsky, a Democratic consultant in Arizona. ‚ÄúIn Arizona we know this will increase costs on families, utility rates will go up, for some families taxes will go up, and even if you‚Äôre not on Medicaid chances are your older relatives are.‚Äù

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a frequent Trump critic, will focus his campaign messaging on the president. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the federal government and MAGA Republicans that are at fault for your food assistance, your rural hospitals closing or you getting kicked off Medicaid,‚Äù said a person close to Pritzker‚Äôs reelection campaign, hinting at the Democratic governor‚Äôs strategy for maneuvering around state budget concerns.

Last week, Pritzker featured the owner of Billie‚Äôs coffee shop in Chicago talking about the local business affect of the president‚Äôs trade policies, as a way to localize Trump‚Äôs actions and influence swing voters. ‚ÄúPackaging bags, the costs have increased,‚Äù the owner Gina says in the video. ‚ÄúThose are things that I feel like President Trump has created. We have cut as much as we can at this point. We need some stability, and that‚Äôs not what we‚Äôve seen so far.‚Äù

Republicans are confident they can beat back the attacks by claiming they are effectively combating waste, fraud and abuse in welfare programs, while pointing to the bill‚Äôs popular provisions like eliminating taxes on tips or overtime.

Yet House Speaker Mike Johnson has privately conceded that the deeper Medicaid cuts pushed by the Senate will force House Republicans to lose their slim majority next year. Publicly, Johnson has struck a more optimistic tone, repeatedly telling reporters that he has ‚Äúno concerns‚Äù about the bill costing Republicans‚Äô seats.

Republicans know the megabill could end up hurting them. That‚Äôs particularly relevant in Arizona, where Hobbs might face a challenge from Republican Rep. Andy Biggs, who voted for the legislation. ‚ÄúI can imagine voters will be reminded on an hourly basis that any cuts will be laid at the feet of Congress and President Trump,‚Äù GOP strategist Barrett Marson said.

Should Hobbs ‚Äî facing one of the most competitive gubernatorial races next year ‚Äî successfully channel backlash to the megabill to help her win reelection, she will have other problems to deal with.

An estimated 360,000 Arizonans stand to lose their Medicaid coverage. And experts have identified five rural hospitals on the brink of closure due to reduced revenue from Medicaid patients. The federal government shifting Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program administration costs onto states could mean that Arizona will strain to continue feeding the 1 in 8 residents who rely on it to buy groceries.

The federal clawbacks are so significant that governors are warning they are entirely unable to make up the difference. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs billions of dollars that we don‚Äôt have,‚Äù Hobbs said as the Senate passed the bill. ‚ÄúEven if we cut every single thing in the state, we don‚Äôt have the money to backfill all these cuts.‚Äù

By design, the bulk of the Medicaid and SNAP changes won‚Äôt take effect until after the midterms, a legislative maneuver intended to shield Republicans from immediate electoral consequences that could also give governors more time to reconfigure state funding formulas. But state appropriators say they are already mapping out how to account for the steep federal losses, and may need to start moving around funds in next year‚Äôs budgets.

‚ÄúDo we fund food for hungry families, or do we fund our community colleges?‚Äô‚Äù said Arizona State Rep. Oscar De Los Santos, the Democratic minority leader. ‚ÄúDo we fund food for hungry families, or do we pay public school teachers? That is the position that Trump and the Republicans have put us in.‚Äù

Public polling shows the funding bill is widely unpopular. One recent Quinnipiac survey found 55 percent opposed the law compared to 29 percent in support.

The Republican governors who publicly supported the bill now have an especially difficult situation. GOP-led states with large populations of low-income Americans rely the most on federal assistance and lack the tax base or political willpower to support any revenue increases.

Repercussions from the megabill are unlikely to have any electoral bearing on the deep red states with upcoming gubernatorial elections. But it could pose problems for Lombardo.

In February, Lombardo urged Congress not to slash Medicaid funding to avoid ‚Äúserious consequences‚Äù for vulnerable populations and the health care infrastructure ‚Äì a rare break for a GOP governor against Trump and Congressional Republicans.

But when the bill was ultimately passed, Lombardo praised its no-tax-on-tips provision that influenced by Nevada and its thriving tourism economy, and said that while his administration assesses the bill ‚ÄúNevadans should be excited about the potential impacts of tax cuts, investments in small businesses and American manufacturing, and efforts to secure the border.‚Äù

Democrats who control the Nevada state legislature, however, believe that the legislation will create more harm than good, and when people start to lose their health insurance they will blame Lombardo for not speaking out more against the law.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just too early to tell how bad it is, but from what we know so far, it is going to be a life and death situation for many folks,‚Äù said Fabian Do√±ate, a Nevada state senator.

In New York, state officials are warning the funding cuts will lead to job losses. A projected 63,000 jobs will be eliminated, nearly half from the health care sector.

Democratic strategists believe that‚Äôs a compelling argument for Hochul to make ahead of her campaign for a second full term next year, when she faces potential GOP challenges from Stefanik and Rep. Mike Lawler.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt just focus on the cost of it, talk about what people aren‚Äôt going to be able to do going forward,‚Äù said Basil Smikle, the former executive director of the New York State Democratic Party. ‚ÄúTalk about what they‚Äôll lose. Kids aren‚Äôt going to a doctor, your child is losing SNAP benefits. That‚Äôs the way you talk about it ‚Äî not so much as a spending issue, but frame it as a right you used to have but no longer have.‚Äù

Yet Democratic state lawmakers in Albany worry there are limits to that strategy. New York‚Äôs budget next year was already estimated to have a $7.5 billion gap to fill. That hole is expected to grow to $11 billion as a result of the federal cuts.

‚ÄúGovernmentally this is an atomic bomb,‚Äù Democratic state Sen. James Skoufis said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing but bad news. It‚Äôs a massive gaping hole in New York‚Äôs budget and I imagine most state budgets around the country.‚Äù

New York has one of the costliest Medicaid programs in the country. About 44 percent of the state‚Äôs residents are enrolled in Medicaid or have state-sponsored coverage. Some Democrats fret the cuts will lead to hospital closures and impact other big-spending areas of the budget like school aid.

‚ÄúYou can blame the federal government all you want, but it‚Äôs the state that‚Äôs going to be making the cuts to the hospitals and the nursing homes and the health centers and the schools,‚Äù Assemblymember Amy Paulin said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs everywhere.‚Äù

His eyes narrowed slightly, studying my face.  
  
My wolf whimpered with terror. Just when I thought he'd caught me, he scooped me up and settled me back on the bed.  
  
""Baby, you scared the hell out of me. We already lost our pup‚ÄîI can't handle losing you too.""  
  
He dared to mention our pup.  
  
Thinking of all the puppies he'd murdered, I pressed a hand to my chest as grief threatened to overwhelm me.  
  
Those accidents, the attacks, the fall‚Äîall of it orchestrated by my own mate.  
  
""The heal needs to do a follow-up procedure. Just to make sure everything's healing properly.""  
  
""I know losing the baby hurts, but we'll try again. We'll have the most beautiful pup‚Äîstrong like their Alpha, gentle like their mother.""  
  
Cassian handed me a vial of potion. In the brief moment he turned away, I saw a thick, dark liquid shimmer as something else mixed in and vanished.  
  
He pulled me close, his expression soft with false concern.  
  
But I could see through the mask now. Every gentle touch was a lie.  
  
""Do I really need to drink this? I'm not very thirsty...""  
  
Cassian, you've slaughtered seven of my children. Now you want to steal my very ability to be a mother?  
  
He didn't even pause, stroking my hair with that practiced tenderness.  
  
""Come on, don't be difficult. You need your strength to heal. You want your Alpha to worry himself sick?""  
  
""Let me help you with that.""  
  
He pressed the glass to my lips, his grip firm enough that refusal wasn't an option.  
  
I closed my eyes, each swallow feeling like liquid fire burning down my throat.  
  
As the drugs took hold, I saw the healer slip into the room through my blurring vision.  
  
""Begin immediately. And...""  
  
Cassian's voice dropped to barely a whisper.  
  
""Make sure she can‚Äôt walk again.""  
  
Chapter 2  
  
""Alpha, is this really necessary? Isn‚Äôt that‚Ä¶ a little too cruel?""  
  
""Do it!""  
  
I knew Cassian was always calculating and paranoid, but I never imagined that just seeing me awake early would push him to such cruelty.  
  
My puppy, my chance at motherhood, and now even my ability to walk‚Äîhe was taking everything.  
  
Cassian, is this how you treat the mate the Moon Goddess chose for you?  
  
My wolf howled inside me, wild and silent with fury.  
  
I screamed silently in despair, struggling to sit up, but the darkness pulled me deeper.  
  
As the anesthesia began to wear off, I heard the healer's voice through the haze:  
  
""Alpha, her womb has been removed. And... she'll never walk again.""  
  
Cassian's voice was filled with satisfaction. ""Good. Perfect.""  
  
When I fully awakened, tears were falling onto my hands‚Äîhis tears, so convincingly real.  
  
""Evelyn, the healer says infection damaged your womb. You'll never be able to have children.""  
  
I ignored him, frantically trying to move my legs.  
  
Nothing. No sensation at all.  
  
I broke down completely, sobbing as I demanded:  
  
""Cassian, what did you do to my legs?""  
  
Tears streamed down his face, his voice breaking with practiced grief.  
  
""There were complications with the anesthesia. You're paralyzed from the waist down.""  
  
""Don't be scared, baby... no matter what happens, I'll never leave you. I'll always love you.""  
  
I'd never realized what a gifted actor my mate was.  
  
He dismissed the nurses, personally feeding me soup, cleaning my body, even tending to the post-surgical bleeding himself.  
  
He worked tirelessly until evening, then kissed my forehead tenderly.  
  
""You've suffered so much for our pack. I promise I'll spend the rest of my life making it up to you.""  
  
I studied his exhausted face, then looked away coldly.  
  
""You should rest if you're tired.""  
  
""I'll stay right here with you. Just call if you need anything.""  
  
Once he was asleep, I reached for his second phone.  
  
I'd always known about Cassian's other device‚Äîhis ""work phone""‚Äîbut had never thought to check it.  
  
The password worked on the first try.  
  
Annabelle's birthday.  
  
The lock screen showed their wedding photo.  
  
A wedding photo... He'd married her in secret. The white dress seared my eyes.  
  
With trembling fingers, I opened his messages. He called her ""baby"" in every text.  
  
Endless conversations that grew more horrifying with each scroll.  
  
Every business trip had been a lie‚Äîexcuses to be with her.  
  
All those times I'd been hurt that he never came to my doctor appointments.  
  
When physicians asked about the Alpha, I'd smile awkwardly and say he was busy with Alpha duties.  
  
His standard response was always the same:  
  
""I‚Äôve been tied up with pack affairs. Check-ups aren't a big deal‚ÄîI'd just be in the way. You can handle routine things yourself.""  
  
But he'd attended every single one of Annabelle's prenatal appointments. No matter how busy, he never missed one.  
  
He wrote about how excited he was for their child, calling them the most precious thing in his world.  
  
Scrolling further, my heart shattered completely.  
  
Every time I got pregnant, they planned how to kill my child.  
  
Even the car accident from a year ago‚ÄîAnnabelle had been behind the wheel.  
  
She'd said she wanted to experience the thrill of hitting someone. Cassian had eagerly agreed.  
  
His only instruction: ""Try not to kill her outright.""  
  
They discussed hurting me and murdering my children as casually as commenting on the weather.  
  
My nails dug into my palms until blood dripped between my fingers.  
  
The photo album contained thousands of pictures‚Äîall of Annabelle. Candid shots, selfies together, morning scenes, walks, intimate dinners where he'd prepared special meals for her pregnancy...  
  
There were 99+ videos. I switched to that section and felt ice water flood my veins.  
  
Countless recordings of their intimate moments, like they were documenting every encounter.  
  
Even role-playing scenarios that made my stomach turn.  
  
I pressed my hand to my mouth, fighting nausea.  
  
But worse were six videos labeled ""First,"" ""Second,"" all the way to ""Sixth.""  
  
Realizing what they contained, bile rose in my throat as blood filled my mouth.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
I bit down hard on my lip and opened the sixth video.  
  
Cassian and Annabelle were laughing together.  
  
In front of them lay...my unboren puppy.  
  
The blade might as well have been cutting into my own flesh. My wolf howled in agony, the pain causing my stomach to cramp violently.  
  
I couldn't hold back anymore, leaning over the bed rail as dry heaves wracked my body.  
  
I didn't sleep that night, my wolf pacing restlessly in my mind as tears soaked through my hospital gown.  
  
The next morning, Cassian brought me breakfast as usual‚Äîan elaborate spread he'd personally selected.  
  
Pancakes, fresh fruit, coffee, pastries...  
  
I'd once thought this was his way of showing love. Now I knew it was just thoughtless guilt, buying his way out of actually caring.  
  
Remembering the videos, I dry heaved again.  
  
Seeing my distress, Cassian's expression filled with concern:  
  
""Still feeling sick? Damn it, this is all my fault. I hate seeing my mate like this.""  
  
""I'm fine. I want to go home.""  
  
Something flickered across Cassian's face‚Äîa moment of tension.  
  
""You just lost another pup. My mother isn't... handling it well. If you go back to the pack house now, you'll just walk into a shitstorm. Maybe we should wait until things cool down.""  
  
I said nothing, but his expression told me everything I needed to know.  
  
That afternoon, while he was gone, I packed my things and wheeled myself to the pack house.  
  
I rolled through the front door to find Annabelle curled up in Cassian's lap, both of them cooing over a baby whose scent carried unmistakable traces of Graves bloodline.  
  
Margaret emerged from the kitchen with a bowl of bone broth, personally feeding Annabelle spoonful by spoonful.  
  
The three of them looked like the perfect family unit.  
  
The moment Margaret caught my scent, her eyes flashed with her wolf's displeasure.  
  
""Well, well. Look what crawled back to the den. You've got some nerve showing your face here after what you've done.""  
  
""My Alpha son treats you like a precious mate, and this is how you repay him? Another dead heir. You're cursed, and you're bringing that curse into our pack!""  
  
""Annabelle is the one deserves to be Luna of the Moonvale Pack. Get out of my territory‚Äîyou're poison to this pack.""  
  
Annabelle followed Margaret's gaze to me, her eyes glittering with the triumph:  
  
""Luna Margaret, don't be so harsh. What if Evelyn gets upset and starts spreading lies about Alpha and me to the other packs?""  
  
""Let her try. No pack leader gives a damn what a barren she-wolf has to say.""  
  
I knew Margaret had always despised me. She thought I was too headstrong for an Alpha's mate, too independent‚Äîthat I'd challenge her son's authority instead of submitting properly.  
  
Annabelle was everything she wanted: beautiful, submissive, making Cassian the center of her universe like a proper Luna should.  
  
She'd only wanted Annabelle as her son's mate, but then Annabelle married into another pack, and I'd given up everything to be the perfect Alpha's mate.  
  
Margaret had reluctantly accepted me into the pack.  
  
But years of failed pregnancies had pushed her resentment to the breaking point.  
  
Now that Annabelle was back‚Äîwith Cassian's heir‚ÄîMargaret felt free to unleash every bit of venom she'd been storing.  
  
If only she knew that every one of those lost pups had been orchestrated by her beloved Alpha.  
  
Every grandchild she'd mourned had been murdered by the woman she was now treating like precious pack treasure.  
  
In the past, Cassian would have used his Alpha command to intervene. Now he sat there holding Annabelle's child, acting like he couldn't hear a word.  
  
Annabelle nestled deeper into his arms:  
  
""Cassian, you're paying more attention to the pup than to me. Your wolf is making mine jealous.""  
  
Cassian's expression melted with adoration as he nuzzled her neck, scenting her:  
  
""You know you're my true mate. But look what I have for you.""  
  
I followed Annabelle's delighted gaze to a document on the coffee table: ""Pack Territory Transfer Agreement.""  
  
""Oh my God, Cassian! You're giving me pack lands?""  
  
She kissed the corner of his mouth, shooting me a triumphant look over his shoulder.  
  
I smiled back coldly, my wolf finally going still in my mind.  
  
Enjoy it while you can.  
  
Soon enough, you and your precious Alpha will be crawling back to me, begging.

**Chapter 1**

When Sarah Hopkins was struggling through a difficult childbirth, her husband was in the neighboring ward, attending to his first love. ""Dr. Hopkins won't be coming over. Other doctors can take care of you here,"" a nurse said cautiously. Sarah closed her eyes in despair, her heart aching even more than the tearing pain in her body. Matthew Hopkins, her attending physician, had been in charge of her health throughout the entire pregnancy. Now, he had abandoned Sarah for his first love. Bed number 21, Yvonne Kennedy, was Matthew's beloved. They had even planned to get married once.

If it hadn't been for that accident, Yvonne would be carrying Matthew's child right now. With her last ounce of strength, Sarah looked at her deflated belly. She hadn't even had a chance to see her baby. She didn't know if it was a boy or a girl, or if it looked more like her or Matthew. Sarah closed her eyes, feeling an overwhelming exhaustion she had never experienced before.

The pain in her lower abdomen was tearing her apart, and the rapidly bleeding blood seemed to be counting down the final moments of her life. She couldn't hold on any longer. Her eyes rolled back, and she fainted. Someone's scream echoed in the background, ""Get the defibrillator. The patient isn't breathing.""

\*\*\*\*\*

In the neighboring ward, ""Darling, Matthew, it hurts so much,"" the frail figure on bed number 21 trembled slightly, clutching both Matthew's and Samuel Pearson's hands tightly. Concerned, Matthew looked at Yvonne, who was so thin and frail, with a big belly, and pursed his lips tightly. 'Damn it, how could Samuel let Yvonne get pregnant and give birth at such a young age?' Matthew thought to himself.

Yvonne was already thin. During her pregnancy, she had no appetite at all and was now skin and bones. Matthew couldn't even imagine how much suffering Yvonne would have to endure to give birth to this child. Without caring that Samuel was still there, Matthew tightly held Yvonne's hand, his voice trembling. ""Yvonne, don't worry. I'm here. You and the baby will be fine. I'll always be by your side."" Matthew's eyes were bloodshot, with an endless determination in them. ""You will give birth smoothly. You will."" \*\*\*\*\*

Sarah felt like she was falling into a deep sleep, occasionally hearing sounds from the outside world. Time dragged on endlessly. She was carried up and down by the wind, helpless, much like her days and nights in the Hopkins residence. On those countless nights when she was bullied and belittled by the Hopkins family, she had thought about giving up. It was her purest love for Matthew that gave her the courage to keep going. She never imagined that after trying so hard to please them for so long, she would still end up being discarded like trash. If she could wake up, she really wanted to change everything.

Three years passed in the blink of an eye.

A boy in a fluffy jacket was peering through the window, stretching his neck to get a better look inside. The woman lying on the hospital bed had a pale complexion and was motionless.

""Karen, when will Mommy wake up?"" he asked.

Karen Crawford lovingly patted his head and replied gently, ""When you grow up to be a good boy, your mommy will surely wake up.""

Mike Hopkins nodded and pressed his cheek softly against the cold glass.

He stared intently at Sarah on the hospital bed, clasping his hands together in front of his chest. ""I'll be good and listen, Mommy. You have to wake up soon. I don't like Yvonne. She always says bad things about you.""

The next moment, it seemed like God had heard Mike's plea. Sarah's fingers twitched ever so slightly.

Mike scrambled to his feet and grabbed Karen's hand tightly. ""Karen, Mommy moved.""

**Chapter 2**

Karen immediately scooped up Mike and rushed to the nurse's station. ""Doctor, Mrs. Hopkins is awake.""

Sarah had been having a very long dream.

In this dream, she was no longer the orphan picking up dirty food in the pouring rain.

She had a loving father, a loving mother, and a brother who cherished her badly.

She was wearing a beautiful white dress, dancing gracefully in a house that looked like a castle. Her parents and brother surrounded her, praising her as the most beautiful little princess in the world.

When she grew tired from dancing, her brother would bring a towel and gently wipe the fine sweat from her forehead. ""Sarah, you danced so well. You are going to be the greatest dancer in Jabrine someday,"" he said.

The little girl giggled at the praise, revealing a set of uneven baby teeth.

But as she laughed, her parents and brother began to fade away. She tried to reach out to them, but they were slipping out of her grasp.

All she could hear was her brother's voice growing fainter and fainter in the air. ""Sarah, you have to hold on. We'll come for you.""

Sarah took a deep breath, like a drowning person, and suddenly opened her eyes wide.

""Dr. Cooper, the patient is finally awake,"" someone said.

Sarah turned her head with great effort and saw Julian Cooper and Mia Bailey. They had been standing by her side the whole time.

She looked around hopefully, but Matthew wasn't here.

Julian's heart finally settled when he saw that Sarah was awake. He let out a sigh of relief and said softly, ""Sarah, you're finally awake. You've been in a coma for far too long.""

Sarah tried to speak but found she couldn't make a sound.

Mia saw Sarah's mouth move and quickly fetched a straw to give her some water. ""Don't worry, Sarah. It's normal that you can't speak after being in a coma for so long. Have some water and you'll feel better.""

After swallowing a few sips of water, the dryness in her throat was somewhat relieved, but her voice was still barely audible. ""Coma? What's going on?""

Mia forced a smile. ""Sarah, you had a near-fatal amniotic fluid embolism during childbirth. You've been unconscious ever since.""

Sarah cleared her throat. ""How long have I been in a coma?""

Julian reached over to change the IV bottle for Sarah. ""Three years.""

Sarah's eyes widened in shock. 'Three years? I have been in a coma for three years. What about my baby? Where is my child?' she wondered.

She turned to Julian. ""Dr. Cooper, where's my baby? Where is my child now?""

Before Julian could respond, the little boy of joy who had been waiting at the door rushed in impatiently.

""Mommy. I'm right here. I'm Mike,"" came the clear, cute voice from the doorway. Sarah looked down, tears welling up in her eyes.

Mike stood up but couldn't even reach the height of her hospital bed. He clung to the railing, staring at her intently.

Sarah looked at this child, connected to her by blood, and felt her heart melt. She couldn't help but gently touch Mike's face. ""Mike, you're my child.""

Mike nuzzled against Sarah's hand, feeling the softness and the familiar scent. Karen had been right. Mommy's touch was the best in the world.

Sarah struggled to pull herself together and lifted Mike onto the hospital bed, holding him tightly in her arms. ""Dr. Cooper, has Matthew come to see me?""

Julian, looking at the reunited mother and child, hesitated before speaking, ""Dr. Hopkins has been busy.""

Sarah, holding her child close, looked at Julian with a hint of despair in her eyes. ""For three years, hasn't he come even once?""

Seeing Sarah's tears flowing more and more, Mike quickly reached out to wipe them away. ""Mommy, don't be sad. Even though Daddy is with Yvonne, I have always been here for you.""

**Chapter 3**

\*\*\*\*\*

Matthew watched Yvonne and Lucia playing and laughing in the courtyard, a smile unconsciously spreading across his lips.

Ever since Yvonne and Lucia had moved into the Hopkins residence, he felt like the once-cold mansion had come to life. He even found himself coming home more often.

Wade placed a cup of coffee beside Matthew's hand. Matthew glanced at Wade and rarely spoke. ""Where's Mike?""

Wade paused for a moment. ""Mike went to see Mrs. Hopkins with Karen.""

Matthew let out a cold laugh. ""Yvonne has been truly devoted to him all these years. I never expected that someone who's been lying in a coma for three years would still matter more.""

Matthew casually turned his face toward Wade. ""He's three now. Do you think he looks like me back then?""

Wade smiled and spoke smoothly. ""Mike carries your bloodline, so naturally, he resembles you.""

""What about Yvonne? You've been with the Hopkins family for so long; you should know,"" Matthew warned.

Wade's response was as impeccable as ever, leaving no room for criticism. ""Ms. Kennedy has grown up with you since childhood. She is naturally a very nice person.""

Matthew fell silent for a long while, just quietly gazing in the direction of Yvonne and Lucia. It was impossible to tell what he was thinking.

Wade's eyes flickered with a hint of pity, but he still asked, ""Should we bring Mike back?""

Matthew shifted his gaze from Yvonne, stood up, and put on his coat, preparing to head to the hospital. ""Let him be. He's three now. If he still can't tell right from wrong, he doesn't deserve to be my son.""

\*\*\*\*\*

As Matthew was just about to leave, he ran into Julian, who had just finished a surgery.

Julian's lips curled into a mocking smile. ""Dr. Hopkins, are you here for surgery?""

Matthew gave a faint nod, not wanting to engage Julian in any conversation. He had always looked down on Julian.

Matthew had been a prodigy in the medical field since childhood, smoothly completing his master's and doctoral degrees.

After graduation, he had directly joined Jabrine Hospital and secured a position in gynecology and obstetrics.

Compared to Matthew, who was a naturally gifted talent, Julian had relied entirely on hard work. He had worked himself to the bone during his internship and graduate studies to become the deputy director of gynecology and obstetrics.

Even the hospital director favored Matthew a bit more.

For Matthew to acknowledge Julian with a greeting was already a sign of respect.

Seeing that Matthew wasn't responding, Julian continued, ""Dr. Hopkins, aren't you at all concerned about how your wife is doing?""

Matthew's lips curled into a cold smile. ""Sarah has been in a coma for three years. What more is there to know?""

Julian's eyes flickered, and a teasing expression appeared on his face. ""So you haven't heard yet?""

""Your wife woke up this morning and is having lunch with Mike right now.""

Matthew's eyebrows furrowed tightly. ""What? She's awake?""

Julian watched as Matthew's expression darkened dramatically. He couldn't help but feel a pang of sympathy for Sarah.

Sarah had been so eager for Matthew to visit her, yet Matthew's face turned darker than a storm cloud at the news of her awakening.

Julian hesitated for a moment, but in the end, he didn't say another word.

As soon as Matthew finished his surgery, he rushed straight to the ward he hadn't set foot in for three years.

If Sarah had woken up and found out that Yvonne had been living in the Hopkins residence all this time, she might try to make things difficult for her. He needed to lay down some ground rules with her first, to prevent any more trouble.

He had just reached the door of the ward when he heard the sound of laughter and playful noise coming from inside. Mike's voice was filled with a kind of happiness that Matthew had never heard before.

**Chapter 4**

Matthew pushed open the door, and there was Mike, tightly hugging Sarah's neck, showing a level of intimacy that was much greater than when he interacted with Yvonne, who had taken care of him for three years.

Matthew clenched his teeth in frustration, and his dislike for Sarah grew even stronger. Blood really did matter; no matter how sincerely Yvonne had treated Mike all these years, she had never earned a single smile from him.

Yet now, just waking up, Sarah could be this close to Mike at their very first meeting. Mike's ability to play people was just like his mother's, who once secretly schemed to sleep with him.

The mother and son, who had been playing, turned their heads toward Matthew at the sound of the door.

He cleared his throat and turned to Karen, who was peeling fruit. ""Karen, take Mike back first. I need to have a word with Mrs. Hopkins.""

Karen nodded, put down the fruit, and moved to pick up Mike.

But Mike squirmed in Sarah's arms, clearly unwilling. ""Daddy, I don't want to go with Karen. I want to stay with Mommy.""

Sarah, noticing the conflicted look on Matthew's face, gently patted Mike's back. ""Mike, be a good boy and go with Karen for now. Your dad needs to talk to me.""

Mike glanced at Sarah's face, and only then did he reluctantly climb down from the bed, though he was still very reluctant.

He clung to Sarah's hand and muttered, ""I'll come to see you again tomorrow, Mommy. You have to stay awake and not fall asleep again.""

After a bit of a struggle, Karen finally managed to take Mike away.

Matthew closed the door behind them, pulled up a chair, and sat down beside Sarah's hospital bed.

Sarah looked at the man who had left her on the operating table and hadn't visited her in three years, and tears welled up in her eyes. ""Matthew, why haven't you come to see me all these years?""

Matthew pursed his lips, thinking of a thousand things to say but unable to get any words out.

Even if Sarah wasn't the wife he had originally wanted, she had still risked her life to give birth to his son. It was wrong of him not to have visited her even once in all these years.

""Sarah, you know I'm the head of gynecology and obstetrics, and I've also been busy with the affairs of the Hopkins family. I really haven't had the time,"" he murmured.

Sarah, thinking of all the grievances she had suffered and hearing Matthew's feeble excuse, suddenly burst into anger. ""Matthew, just how busy have you been that you couldn't come to see me even once in three years?

""And tell me, where were you when my life and my child's life were hanging in the balance on the operating table?""

Matthew didn't expect the usually gentle and considerate woman to question him so aggressively, and he couldn't help but frown. ""Sarah, you know I'm the chief physician of gynecology and obstetrics. All the pregnant women are my patients. I can't possibly be by your side all the time.""

He rubbed his temples as if he were exhausted. ""Sarah, stop making a fuss. I just got off a three-hour surgery, and I'm really tired.""

Sarah looked at his displeased expression and felt like she had never really known him at all.

He had abandoned his wife and child to be with his first love during childbirth, and now he was turning things around, accusing her of being willful and unreasonable.

Sarah took a deep breath and held back the tears that were threatening to spill. ""Alright, then tell me, which patient were you operating on when you abandoned us?""

If Matthew could admit that he had left her to be with Yvonne, Sarah would finally give up on him completely.

**Chapter 5**

After all, if he could openly say that she was just his second choice, then he clearly didn't love her anymore. He wouldn't even bother lying to her anymore.

But Sarah didn't hear what she wanted to hear from Matthew.

His brows were furrowed tightly, and his face was very dark. ""Sarah, just because I didn't perform your surgery, are you going to accuse me of having an affair with another patient? Sarah, when did you become so vicious? I'm really disappointed in you.""

Sarah smiled bitterly. This was the man she had loved for three years. He had betrayed her and their child, yet he lacked the courage to even admit it.

She wasn't sure whether to feel relieved that he was still pretending in front of her or to despise his constant hypocrisy.

""Matthew, do you really want me to spell it out for you? I already know that you left Mike and me to go save Yvonne back then,"" she said, looking into his suddenly panicked eyes. ""But you can't even bring yourself to admit it.""

Matthew suppressed the flicker of panic inside him and looked at Sarah coldly. ""So what if I did operate on Yvonne? You owed her that much. Besides, you're a medical school student; you know how high the mortality rate of amniotic fluid embolism is.

""I was just trying to save a patient with a higher chance of survival. What's wrong with that?""

Listening to Matthew's excuses, Sarah felt the last shred of hope within her vanish. It was as if she could hear her heart shattering.

She wanted to cry, but the hot tears that had been burning in her eyes wouldn't fall anymore.

""Abandoning your wife and child to save your childhood sweetheart. How selfless of you, Matthew,"" she said sarcastically.

She couldn't rely on this deceitful, spineless man any longer. She would do whatever it took to take Mike away from the Hopkins family.

Sarah closed her eyes and leaned back against the bed in despair. ""Matthew, let's get a divorce. I was the one who wrongfully took Yvonne's place as your wife back then. Now, I'll give everything back to you.""

Matthew didn't respond, just let out a soft, mocking laugh. He touched Sarah's forehead, his tone uncharacteristically teasing. ""Sarah, you don't have a fever, do you? Why are you talking nonsense?""

Sarah swatted his hand away in disgust, her gaze cold. ""Matthew, I'm not joking. The moment you left Mike and me for Yvonne, we were already over.""

She turned her head to look at the crayon drawing Mike had eagerly brought for her. The two stick figures, drawn with crooked lines, were smiling happily; they represented her and Mike.

""You can keep all your money. I just want you to let me take Mike with me,"" she added.

Hearing this, Matthew knew Sarah had made up her mind.

In the year they had been married, he had come to understand her somewhat. Once she made a decision, nothing could change her mind.

He stood up and looked at Sarah coldly. ""Fine, you can have the divorce, but the child stays with me. He's the blood of the Hopkins family and cannot be allowed to wander outside.""

Matthew unconsciously twirled the platinum ring on his pinky finger, thinking for a moment. ""As compensation, I can give you the villa on the outskirts of town and the penthouse in the city center.""

Sarah felt a lump in her throat and almost cried. Matthew had already considered the possibility of divorcing her. He had even planned out the compensation he would offer her.

'Has he spent these three years I was in a coma, figuring out how to divorce me and then marry Yvonne?' Sarah wondered. 'What about the grievances I have endured in the Hopkins residence over the past year, the gentle care I have shown Matthew-what do all that mean?'

**Chapter 6**

""No way, I won't give up the child. Mike is still young. Even if we go to court, the child will be awarded to me,"" she said firmly.

Matthew's lips curled into a mocking smile. ""Sarah, it seems that even after all these years with the Hopkins family, you still haven't learned. If I want to keep the child within the Hopkins family, you won't have the power to take him away.""

Sarah's face turned pale. She knew Matthew was right. As an orphan, she couldn't possibly stand up to the Hopkins family, who had deep roots in Jabrine. She needed to think this through carefully.

Seeing Sarah's silence, Matthew thought she was about to give in. ""Sarah, although we've only been married for a year, we did have some feelings for each other. I don't want to resort to underhanded tactics against you. Wouldn't it be better if we parted ways amicably?""

With that, he headed for the door. Just as he was about to leave, Matthew turned his head and added, ""But don't even think about making things difficult for Yvonne. If I find out you're going to harm Yvonne, you won't get any of that compensation.""

After that argument, Matthew never came back. Even Mike, who was under Matthew's control, hadn't visited for several days.

After finishing the last bottle of IV fluid for the day, Sarah lay back against the pillow, bored and listless.

She was staring blankly at the potted plant in the ward when Margot Hopkins, accompanied by four bodyguards and several large boxes of gifts, entered the room.

Margot was well-preserved; though in her forties, she showed little sign of age.

She directed the bodyguards to put down the gifts and then sat down beside Sarah's hospital bed.

She glanced at Sarah's still pale face, her eyes flickering with a brief look of disdain before she smiled and said, ""Sarah, now that you're finally awake, my heart is at ease. With you here to raise Mike properly within the Hopkins family, I can rest easy.""

Sarah knew Margot was already aware of her plans to divorce Matthew. By mentioning Mike, Margot was trying to use him as leverage.

""Mr. Hopkins, Matthew and I can't go on like this. He abandoned me when I needed him the most, to save another woman. If it weren't for Dr. Cooper, Mike might not have survived at all,"" Sarah said.

Margot lowered her eyes, a rare flicker of guilt crossing her face.

Matthew had indeed been in the wrong. But then again, if Sarah hadn't taken Yvonne's place, Yvonne would have been Mike's mother. Matthew's abandonment was just what Sarah deserved.

""Sarah, now that you've given birth to a child for our family, you should settle down and focus on being a good wife and mother within the Hopkins family. Stop entertaining these absurd thoughts,"" Margot said firmly.

Sarah let out a cold laugh, looking at the well-nourished woman in front of her, whose good health was thanks to the medication Sarah had provided. She felt all her previous kindness toward the Hopkins family had been in vain.

""Absurd thoughts? Mrs. Hopkins, I don't understand what you're saying,"" Sarah sneered.

Margot took a deep breath, trying to keep her tone even. ""Sarah, although I didn't approve of you initially and wasn't optimistic about your marriage to Matthew, you've given us such a healthy and adorable grandson. I'm more than satisfied with you. But I've heard rumors that you're planning to divorce Matthew.""

Margot took Sarah's left hand and patted it gently. ""A woman should know when to be content. You have a handsome husband, a comfortable family, and a lovely son. What more could you want?""

Sarah looked down at Margot's delicate hand and curled her lips. ""Content? With what exactly? Mrs. Hopkins, if your husband had abandoned you during a medical emergency to tend to another woman, could you just brush it off and forgive him so easily?""

1lzjdbs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1lzjdbs/traditional_new_zealandaustralian_gingernut/,Traditional New Zealand/Australian gingernut biscuits (cookies to many of you),"By special request, my perfected over many years gingernut biscuit recipe (and notes). Every kiwi baker has a different favourite recipe, this is mine. 

Gingernuts are a very hard biscuit that are intended to hold their shape when dunked into a cup of tea. They are typically baked to be so hard that they are difficult to eat without dunking. Store them in a container with a sprinkle of rice at the bottom to absorb moisture to keep them crisp. 

Some other uses for gingernuts are:
- use them instead of Graham crackers/digestives for a cheesecake base. So good! -  Crumble them onto the top of a parfait. - Make a retro dessert terrine by lining a loaf pan with cling film, brush gingernuts with a coffee liqueur and layer with vanilla-flavoured whipped cream, chill for at least an hour before serving. - Make them into little tart cases by sitting them in muffin pans and warming them in the oven until they soften and can be pushed down into the pans. Let cool then fill. Lemon curd and cheesecake is a good filling but use your imagination

Prep time 15 mins, Cooking time 15 mins*, Makes 35*

90g butter*
75g brown sugar (1/3C firmly packed)*
115g golden syrup (1/3C)*

200g (1 1/3C) plain flour
3/4 tsp bicarbonate of soda
20mL/ 4 tsp ground ginger*

*Optional: 1 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ground clove


Preheat oven to 180C or 160C if fan forced. Grease or line oven trays (I use baking paper). I recommend cookie trays with a double-layer base if possible so that heat will spread evenly.

In a saucepan, gently heat the butter, brown sugar and golden syrup until the butter melts and stir together. Remove from the heat.

Sift the dry ingredients into the saucepan. I implore you to sift it, I'm not normally one to demand sifting but this recipe absolutely WILL get lumps in if if you don't. Stir together and let the mixture cool until it is warm to the touch.

Roll rounded teaspoons* of the mixture into balls and place on the tray with plenty of space for spreading, flatten them slightly. Bake uncovered for about 12 minutes or until lightly browned. If you use multiple trays you will probably need to switch them around in the oven partway through cooking to get an even bake. Loosen the biscuits gently from the tray and let the biscuits cool on the trays.

Notes for all the things with *s

*Cooking time and number of biscuits depends on the size of biscuit you're going for. The original recipe uses rounded teaspoons to make a lot of small biscuits, I like to use a rounded dessertspoon which is about 3 tsp. Which makes larger but not ridiculous biscuits, and they take a couple of minutes longer to cook.

*this recipe is assuming the default butter in NZ which is salted grass-fed butter. Costco actually sells this as Kirkland butter if you want to ve authentic, Anchor is another NZ brand which is exported, or Kerrygold from Ireland is close. Or use whatever butter I don't know if it makes much difference. I don't think this recipe will work with a margarine or coconut oil but it's possible it might work with a firm vegetable shortening intended for baking. If you use an unsalted butter or shortening add a little pinch of salt

*Brown sugar could possibly be substituted with caster sugar + molasses, Google that if you need to

*Golden syrup is a cane sugar syrup and I don't think it's available in the USA. It has the same texture as Karo/Corn syrup and can probably be substituted with Karo + molasses, another thing to ask Google.

*this recipe really needs fresh ginger, if you use that stale ginger that's been sitting in the pantry it just won't be as good

*the recipe I originally adapted this from had cinnamon and clove as well as ginger. To me that's a spiced ginger biscuit not a gingernut. Both are great. Make whichever appeals to you. I also think you could play with spices like cardamom and black pepper if you're feeling fancy

1lzjcge,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sakartvelo/comments/1lzjcge/mestia_ushguli_hike_june_2025/,Mestia - Ushguli hike: June 2025,"There are great resources already on this trail (especially [https://www.caucasus-trekking.com/treks/trek-mestia-to-ushguli](https://www.caucasus-trekking.com/treks/trek-mestia-to-ushguli)), but posting about my personal experience because I still had a ton of questions/surprises on the trail.

**Getting to and from Mestia:**

Lots of blogs I read said 1. The train is better and the long ride is worth it over the marshrutka and 2. That the business class seats are worth it. I didn't agree with either.

The business class seat (44 GEL vs 17 for regular seats). The AC was bad, the seats weren't much more comfortable, and the outlets - unless you're at the table seats - aren't accessible. And this is the same for the economy seats.¬†

The train is 6 hours and service is spotty along the way. You can walk around and things, but the trip from Mestia to Tbilisi takes 8-9 hours with the new highway openings, and the worst part of the marshrutka ride (for me, who suffers from motion sickness) is the mountain road, and you‚Äôre on those roads anyway from Mestia to Zugdidi. Also, it is way cheaper. They both leave at 8am, but there is another that leaves for Tbilisi at noon. To Mestia was 40 GEL and to Zugdidi was 35 GEL.

There is also a bus option from Kutaisi that is coach bus - [https://georgianbus.com/en/page/timetable](https://georgianbus.com/en/page/timetable) (i had a ticket to take this but I missed my alarm and missed the bus) if you want to stop by Kutaisi (highly recommended - lots of things to do in the area)

**The hike:**

I merged the first two days of hiking and skipped over Zhabeshi. I even cut through Chvaniani and skipped walking past Zhabeshi, and folks I met along the way confirmed I didn‚Äôt really miss out on any views going there. Zhabeshi didn‚Äôt have anything special worth splitting up the hike into two days to stay here for the night. The first day to Adishi had a ton of snack and drink stands along the way selling ‚Äúfast food‚Äù (Kachapuris, cokes, etc).¬†

The signal along the way is LTE except around Iprali/Iprari. WiFi at the guesthouses are bad though. Water sources in June weren‚Äôt super available - even though it‚Äôs marked as so on AllTrails, there weren‚Äôt many streams I felt I could drink from.¬†

The views at the end of day 1 heading into Adishi and day 2 walking up from the glacier were great! The towers that you expect to see in Ushguli are everywhere along the trail. I didn‚Äôt see very many dogs, but there was a LOT of cow dung along the way. The flowers in July were inCREDIBLE.

I did not think Ushguli was worth staying in for the night. It was super cool and looked like Skyrim in person, but it is very small, and you‚Äôd probably be excited to back in a larger town.

Although the bus station folks told me the shuttles ran only once at 3pm from Ushguli to Mestia, they seem to run throughout the day as soon as folks turn up. There is one overpriced cafe that seems to have been built recently that is right by the entrance of the town where you can wait for the van to fill up.¬†

Hike was 7/10 overall. Nature wasn‚Äôt insane - especially if you‚Äôve done quite a bit of hiking. But the experience with the hut to hut hiking and the vibe of the towns were very cool and worth it.

[Maps.me](http://maps.me/) navigated to use the car road and I didn‚Äôt know how to force it to show me the walking path, so I got an Alltrails subscription and that seemed to work much better.

Didn't really need bug spray. It did get quite cold at night, so im glad I brought warmer clothes. The weather was rain then sun then cloud then rain then thunder on and off. Someone brought an umbrella, and I thought that was high key a good call since it wasn't windy at all. The trail was really wet - both muddy and from the plants that held the water.

**Towns/Housing:**

Lots of places use[ ](http://booking.com/)[booking.com](http://booking.com), but still plenty that do not. Even though they say they are booked out on [booking.com](http://booking.com), chances are that they are not actually. Qaldea, especially, was continuing to take people in even though online it said it was booked out. If you don‚Äôt book on [booking.com](http://booking.com), the cost is 14 GEL per person to stay in a shared room.

The showers are good - definitely bring shower shoes. Towels are included and the sheets felt and smelled all clean and fresh.

Iprali is a bit spread out - there really are 3 separate clusters - one at the earlier end, one at the later end, and another a few km north of the trail. 

My room in Adishi came with a (though weak) hair dryer. Here are the meals:

Iprali guesthouse apparently had one included. Raul‚Äôs in Iprali had a lot of meat though I hear for their dinner, but mine (Qaldea) had no meat.

**Cost:**

I spent 230 GEL on the trail (not including Mestia meals)

I spent 197 GEL for the transit to, between, and from Mestia.

**Housing costs:**

Mestia single room shared bathroom (Eka and Nino): 38 GEL

Adishi twin room shared bathroom (Bata): 46 GEL. Breakfast included for [booking.com](http://booking.com), 35 GEL for dinner. No meat for dinner. Eggs for breakfast.

Iprali twin room shared bathroom (Qaldea Resort): 14 GEL. Breakfast 30 and Dinner 40, but I didn‚Äôt eat here.

‚ÄúAhh yes yes,what did you say?

‚ÄúAre you okay Miss Pritchard,you don't look well .You look pale as if you have seen a ghost- maybe you need to be excused from this staff meeting-MissDaisy you can give Miss Pritchard the staff minutes later"" 

And there; l was  excused. Frankly speaking l had not been sleeping very well ever since l transferred to this little town of McLee to resume my job as a 3rd grade teacher. lf l had had my way ,l would have loved to continue at my previous school but according to the district ,this was best.Best for whom?

I had been called  to the principal office that fateful day for something warranting discussion. I remember a cold chill crawling in my bones.The principals‚Äô office  is not a place one can ever be comfortable being called to, even for us teachers . 

Before resuming my duties that day ,l had bumped my foot on the corner of  the chair in the kitchen as l was placing my coffee cup in the kitchen sink.Mum who had been kneading bread  with such viciousness ;flour dispersing everywhere,an intensity that worried me had suddenly stopped in her tracks and casted me a worried look.

‚Äú You know its-never a good sign to bump one's foot on a kitchen chair‚Äù. 

She had been raised in superstition. Every little act had to have a cosmic explanation. According to mum if any of your eyelids twitched above the eye ,it meant you were going to receive some good news.lf you dropped a cup or any kitchen utensils it meant you were to receive news of a funeral. Her superstitions had shrouded my entire childhood.

‚ÄúNo  mum; l just bumped my foot. Not a big deal"".

l responded, wincing with the painful burning sensation from my left toe.

‚ÄúI better give you some coarse salt mixed with sheep fat, okay-just to wade off any negativity you might attract today"".

She said as she dusted her flour caked hands on her apron.Her superstitions had crippled my childhood. Back then l couldn't act anyhow without her superstitions. Now that l was older l  had to contend with reason and logic.Superstitions couldn't be deduced and like a math equation l preferred events or things that followed rules and had structure.Superstition was not one of those so l limped away  from  her superstition.

I sat  cautiously across Mr Manly , whose frame l thought ironic given his name.Instead his chair seemed to swallow his tiny frame, making him look diminished.l gulped anxiously to the sort of news he wanted to deliver.
‚ÄúMiss Pritchard.‚Äù 

He adjusted his big rimmed glasses then proceeded to click the huge oak table with his long thin fingers.

‚ÄúThe board thinks it best to have you transfer to the town of McLee to resume your duties as a third grade teacher .I have done my best to shield you from leaving but this matter is beyond my control.You are one of my best teachers,seeing you go truly hurts me.‚ÄùHis words fell flat as if in a vacuum with no hint of emotion.

Bitter words.

Suddenly l had a  lingering metallic  taste on my tongue. I had been teaching  at this school for the past  10 years, molding my children to be able to read and write. l had taught so many the foundation now I was being cast aside.

‚ÄúCant l appeal the board's decision,l have poured so much into my class they are not quite ready.lt would truly hurt them to see me leave‚Äù.

I asked, my voice cracking with anger.

‚ÄúUnfortunately this matter was decided a long time ago.l do not have the power to turn their decision ‚Äù

‚ÄúI see‚Äù

‚ÄúThe school will be hurt to see you go‚Äù.

Bitter words.

I bid my tearful third graders farewell. My eyes welled up a bit. I guess the initial shock had worn off. Mum and her superstition was right. 

That is how l bid that school farewell  and came to Richmond Elementary  in McLee. Three months‚Äô ago. And my problems began soon after.

Espresso Newbie here. Only the second shot with a light roast. Looking for advice/suggestions/recommendations.

Pulled a 40gms shot in 30 seconds with an 18gms dose. A slightly larger yield than the traditional 1:2 to allow the light roast to extract more. There is a bit of spraying at the beginning--possibly tamping/WDT technique issues or both? It tasted fruity and slightly acidic, with a hint of bittersweet aftertaste.

**Gear:**

1. DeLonghi ECP33.21
2. MHW3-Bomber R3 Hand Grinder at 38 Clicks
3. THW Bottomless Portafilter with the stock unpressurized basket
4. Supvox WDT with Removable Needles
5. MHW3-Bomber 0.2mm puck screen
6. HiBrew 51mm Tamper

**Process:**

1. 15 Minute Machine Preheat with the Portafilter
2. Two-Blank Shots Through the Portafilter
3. Puck Prep with WDT and Tamping
4. Wait for the Machine to come up to temp. 
5. Pull a blank shot into the cup without the portafilter
6. Attach the portafilter
7. Wait for the machine to come up to temp.
8. Switch the machine to steam mode for 2-3 seconds (temp-surf)
9. Pull the shot

I do understand that this variety of coffee is primarily listed as suitable for Pour-overs and AeroPress, but just thought of giving it a try to see if the machine can pull it off. 

Up next, planning to try it with a slightly coarser grind at 39 clicks, with a paper filter at the bottom of the puck, for a 54gms shot in 20-25 seconds for a tea-like finish (hopefully).

Apologies for the bad video quality, esp. at the beginning and towards the end--recording the video, timing the shot and watching the weight--all was a bit too much for me, being the first time.

1lzj9om,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver60/comments/1lzj9om/ageing_and_changing_tastebuds/,Ageing and Changing Tastebuds?,"Hi Everyone, 

I turned 61 back in February, but when I think about it, I realize this change started a few years ago. Food and drinks just don‚Äôt taste the same anymore. No matter what it is, a meal, a snack, coffee, even gum, everything seems off. It‚Äôs hard to explain, but flavors feel dull, muted, just... different.

I‚Äôve read that taste buds can fade with age, but what I‚Äôm experiencing feels more dramatic than a subtle shift. It‚Äôs noticeably affected how I eat. For example, let's say I'm craving pizza and looking forward to it but when the food finally arrives, it‚Äôs just meh. Disappointing. Nothing is really good anymore.

Even my tolerance for spice has changed. Dishes that used to have just the right kick now fall flat, and I find myself reaching for more heat just to try and recapture the flavor I used to enjoy. It‚Äôs a strange adjustment, and honestly, kind of a sad one.

Another example, I made a salad for lunch yesterday and added a spoonful of cottage cheese. I opened a brand new container which was weeks out from the expiration date but it tasted sour to me and I threw out my salad. My husband (who is 10 years younger than me) said it tasted fine.

As I sit here this morning, sipping what should be a delicious cup of coffee with French Vanilla creamer, I can‚Äôt help but feel disappointed, it just doesn‚Äôt taste the way it used to. It got me wondering if anyone else noticed this happening too.",3,1752490397.0,AskWomenOver60,11,1.0,False
1lzj8zm,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedAtHome/comments/1lzj8zm/explore_the_hario_mizudashi_cold_brew_coffee/,Explore the Hario Mizudashi Cold Brew Coffee Maker: Is It Worth It?,"The Hario MCPN-14B has become a cherished addition to my daily coffee routine. This cold brew coffee maker, with its sleek design and efficient brewing system, has certainly transformed how I enjoy my caffeine fix, especially during warmer months. With its 1000mL capacity, it caters perfectly to my needs, whether I'm making a single serving or enough to share. I‚Äôve had enough experience with it now to offer a real take on what works and what doesn‚Äôt.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The design of this product immediately caught my attention. The minimalist, Japanese style is both elegant and functional. Crafted from heatproof glass, it feels premium in-hand while being lightweight. The black accents give it a modern appearance, blending easily into any kitchen aesthetic. I appreciate the sturdy, reusable filter which speaks to its practicality and environmental friendliness. The fine mesh basket feels durable, and cleaning it is a breeze‚Äîa huge plus when using it regularly.

**Ease of Use**  
This coffee maker‚Äôs simplicity is its superpower. Adding 80 grams of coarse coffee grounds to the basket, filling it with water, and giving it a quick stir sets things up for the magic to happen. I just pop it into the fridge overnight, and by morning, I‚Äôm rewarded with smooth, delicious cold brew. With its slender spout, pouring the coffee is controlled and mess-free. It‚Äôs especially handy when I serve guests who get to enjoy the brew straight from the carafe.

Check [Hario MCPN-14B price on Amazon.](https://ultrasonicstore.com/p/b001vpxebu/)

**Brewing Performance**  
Testing its performance was a highlight. The cold brew has consistent taste and quality every time I use it. If I grind my coffee coarser, the result is gentler and more delicate; finer grounds produce a brew with more body. Each tweak allows customization to match personal preference, and the flavor is refreshing and full-bodied. The reusable filter ensures no stray grounds end up in the brew, which I absolutely appreciate.

**Pluses**  
- High-quality heatproof glass construction  
- Easy and efficient brewing process  
- Sleek, minimalistic Japanese design  
- Reusable fine mesh filter  
- Slender spout allowing steady pouring  

**Downsides**  
- A bit fragile; not ideal for clumsy hands  
- Capacity may feel limiting for larger families  
- Plastic components may not appeal to everyone  

**Other Options in the Market**  
The competition is fierce when it comes to cold brew coffee makers. The OXO Good Grips Cold Brew Maker, for instance, has a larger capacity and a simpler dispensing mechanism. However, I find the Hario MCPN-14B‚Äôs compact design perfect for my fridge space. Another alternative, the Takeya Cold Brew Maker, is made from plastic rather than glass, which might be preferred by those with active households. Yet, in terms of taste, manual feel, and aesthetics, this product holds its own against these contenders.

**Value for Money**  
For its price point, the Hario MCPN-14B offers tremendous value. Its high-quality glass, elegant design, and repeat performance make it worth every penny for anyone serious about cold brew coffee at home. Unlike automated machines, this coffee maker gives complete control over the brewing process while still being easy to use, making the investment worthwhile.

I leaned against the wall, carefully cradling my six-month bump as I waited for my prenatal checkup.

Once the scheduled examination was done, I planned to visit my husband Aiden‚Äîmaybe we could head home together.

After all, the rain was coming down hard outside. The rideshare app showed nearly 200 people ahead of me in the queue, and my phone signal kept cutting out sporadically.

Aiden wasn't scheduled for specialist clinic duty today, but one of his team's doctor colleagues had called in sick last minute. So he'd been forced to cover a half-day shift.

The heavy smell of disinfectant in the hospital corridors mixed with the damp scent of the downpour outside, making me nauseous.

The waiting area was packed. Children crying, anxious inquiries, nurses trying to maintain order‚Äîall the sounds blended together into a headache-inducing chaos.

I found an empty spot on the bench outside the obstetrics office and had just settled down when I spotted Aiden's tall figure emerging from a consultation room.

He wore his crisp white coat, pressed to perfection, his face still bearing the exhaustion from last night's surgery.

But his gaze swept across the crowd with that familiar sharpness and... intensity. This was the Aiden I knew‚Äîcalm, efficient, completely intolerant of chaos or rule-breaking.

As one of the youngest deputy chief cardiologists at a top New York hospital, his professionalism and strict adherence to protocol were practically carved into his bones.

I'd always considered this a strength.

Just as I was about to call out to him, I saw a figure skillfully weaving through the queue, heading straight for Aiden's office.

That silhouette... was that Vera?

I frowned. Vera was an intern who'd joined the department just over a month ago. Young, pretty, always flashing that sweet smile.

My first impression of her at the hospital had been positive‚Äîa breath of youthful energy.

But here was the problem: she shouldn't be anywhere near Aiden.

Or more precisely, she shouldn't be appearing in such a... privileged way.

Because Aiden had a habitual ""rule""‚Äîto avoid unnecessary complications and distractions, all the interns and assistants he worked with were exclusively male.

This wasn't something he'd actively demanded, but after several young female doctors had tried to ""get close"" through various methods‚Äî""accidentally"" spilling water, messing up reports, asking for ""guidance"" until late at night‚ÄîAiden had had enough.

He'd requested that the training office only assign male interns to his team.

Over time, it became an unspoken understanding within the department.

Even the administrative assistants knew to simply leave documents on his desk‚Äîavoiding any accidental contact with Dr. Aiden.

So what was Vera doing here?

""Aiden!"" Vera's voice carried that deliberately soft sweetness. ""Sorry to bother you, but my stomach pain is really severe...""

Aiden turned slightly. I couldn't even catch the change in his expression before I saw him raise his hand to pull open the consultation room door, gesturing for Vera to enter.

Then, facing the patients and their families who'd been waiting outside for ages, he said flatly: ""Please wait. Handling an emergency.""

Complaints erupted immediately.

""Are you kidding me? We've been waiting all morning!""

""Emergency? That girl looked perfectly healthy just now.""

""Yeah, isn't Dr. Aiden supposed to be the most by-the-book guy here? Line-cutting?""

Aiden's expression didn't budge an inch, as if those voices simply didn't exist.

He was about to close the door when his gaze inadvertently swept across the crowd and landed on me in the corner.

For a split second, I saw surprise flash in Aiden's eyes. Then it shifted into something almost imperceptible... annoyance?

But he said nothing. With a sharp ""bang,"" he shut the consultation room door, blocking out everyone's stares.

Chapter 2

My heart plummeted. Ten minutes? Twenty minutes? The consultation room door remained firmly shut.

The complaints outside grew louder, nurses tried to calm people down, but it was no use.

An icy sensation spread through my limbs. Not from the air conditioning‚Äîbut from knowing that behind that closed door lay territory I, as his wife, rarely set foot in, yet another young woman had effortlessly claimed.

Even with Aiden himself breaking the rules.

Finally, the door opened. Vera emerged holding a payment slip, her cheeks flushed, eyes bright‚Äîshowing absolutely no signs of the ""severe abdominal pain"" she'd mentioned earlier.

She walked toward the payment counter with light steps.

As she passed by me, she even shot me a look that carried triumph, almost defiant in its smugness.

Aiden followed, his expression restored to its usual calm, as if he'd never broken any rules at all.

He looked at me, not giving me a chance to speak: ""Almost off duty.

Finished with your checkup? I still have a few patients‚Äîafter that I'll drive you home. Too much rain outside, rideshares are impossible.""

I said nothing.

The crushing disappointment and sense of betrayal left me heartbroken. I followed Aiden silently to his break room to wait.

Every minute of waiting felt endless.

The break room still carried the faint scent of jasmine perfume‚ÄîVera's fragrance from earlier.

I stared at the neatly arranged files on Aiden's desk and the no-smoking sign beside them, remembering that argument from a month ago.

I'd just finished throwing up from morning sickness and felt suddenly hungry.

When I went to see Aiden, I brought only the mildest lemon water‚ÄîI knew how sensitive he was to strong smells.

But when I took a sip in his office, Aiden said coldly: ""Tina, this is a hospital, not a coffee shop. That smell will linger for hours‚Äîit could affect my clinical judgment. Please don't eat or drink anything in here again.""

Just one sip of water. Aiden had used such harsh, cold phrasing as ""affecting judgment.""

And now, Vera, merely an ""intern,"" had not only broken Aiden's rule about working with female interns, but had also been privileged enough to skip the crowded clinic queue and enter his consultation room because of a ""stomach ache""?

Yet her lingering jasmine fragrance‚Äîwouldn't that affect his ""professional judgment""?

When Aiden returned after seeing his last patient, I was standing by the window, watching the storm outside. ""Let's go."" He grabbed his car keys. ""I parked in the basement garage, no need to get soaked.""

The underground garage felt somewhat damp from the storm's penetration. Aiden's black SUV sat in the spacious parking spot.

When I reached the car, Aiden didn't immediately unlock it, instead looking toward the passenger side.

I followed his gaze and saw the passenger door open.

Vera poked her head out, her face a picture of ""surprise"" and ""apology"": ""Tina? Oh my God‚ÄîI'm so sorry! Earlier, Aiden saw I couldn't get a ride and with this terrible rain, he offered to drop me home... I didn't mean to intrude. Aiden, maybe I should sit in the back?""

She pretended to unbuckle her seatbelt to get out, but Aiden simply unlocked the rear doors and said to me: ""Get in.""

Chapter 3

Then Aiden turned back to Vera, his tone noticeably softer, carrying a hint of reassurance he probably wasn't even aware of: ""It's fine, stay put. You're soaked out there.""

Vera sweetly said ""okay"" and settled back into her seat. Her face still wore that apologetic expression, but her eyes betrayed her current smugness.

I supported my bump and awkwardly maneuvered into the back seat. The car started up and smoothly pulled out of the garage. We drove into the storm.

The car shut out the wind and rain, but it couldn't shut out the silence inside. Aiden broke it first, his voice calm: ""Vera's apartment is pretty far. We'll drop her off first.""

I said nothing, and the last shred of hope in my heart completely vanished. From the hospital to our home was normally a ten-minute drive. But Vera's apartment was in the complete opposite direction‚Äîthis ""far"" was definitely not just a little out of the way.

I watched their silhouettes. Vera seemed a bit cold, arms wrapped around herself. Aiden immediately reached over to turn up the heat near the passenger seat.

Vera said something quietly. Aiden tilted his head slightly, actually smiling, and responded in low tones. I clenched my fists, my body trembling involuntarily. Aiden was completely ignoring me.

The warm air from the heater mixed with Vera's jasmine scent, wafting back toward me in waves. Pregnancy had made my sense of smell acute‚Äîin that moment, it made me nauseous.

Instinctively, I cracked the window open slightly. A blast of cold, rain-laden air immediately rushed in. ""Ah!"" Vera let out a shriek from the passenger seat, dramatically hunching her shoulders. ""So cold!""

Aiden glanced at me through the rearview mirror, his eyes showing displeasure: ""It's pouring. Close the window! Getting the car wet makes it smell worse.""

My heart felt like it was being crushed by a giant fist. Three days ago, just because I'd taken that sip of lemon water in his office, he hadn't spoken to me since. But now?

Vera could sit in his passenger seat wearing perfume, enjoying the heat he'd turned up for her. Just because she complained about being cold, Aiden immediately blamed me for opening the window.

Principles? Rules?

Apparently they only applied to me.

A wave of nausea surged from my stomach, the baby kicking hard‚Äîmaybe sensing my emotional turmoil.

I closed my eyes, took a deep breath of the cold air streaming through the window, forcing myself to stay calm. Then I expressionlessly rolled the window back up.

The car returned to its enclosed warmth. But Vera's mood hadn't immediately recovered. She began complaining softly: ""This weather is awful. I should have grabbed a jacket before leaving.""

""Are you hungry?"" Aiden suddenly asked, his voice surprisingly gentle. The car happened to be passing a brightly lit convenience store.

Vera hesitated: ""Well... a little. I always seem to get hungrier when I'm not feeling well...""

Aiden immediately put on his turn signal and smoothly pulled into the convenience store parking lot. Without looking at me, he unbuckled his seatbelt: ""Wait here.""

Rain hammered against Aiden's umbrella as he got out, instantly soaking half his pant legs. He didn't seem to care, heading straight into the store.

A few minutes later, he returned with dampness clinging to him and water droplets on his clothes. He handed Vera a hot cocoa and a paper bag containing a warm cinnamon roll.

""Eat it while it's hot,"" his voice was low and caring. ""Warm your stomach.""

Sweet, buttery, rich cinnamon scent immediately filled the small car interior. I watched Aiden's soaked sleeves and shoulders, watched the concern in his eyes as he handed Vera the food.

In that instant, I gave up completely. I thought of countless late nights when Aiden came home exhausted after surgery, how I'd tiptoe around, not daring to make a sound for fear of disturbing his rest, because he'd said he hated being bothered most of all.

I thought of all his prohibitions: the cleanliness of private spaces, the ban on eating in his office, the strict boundaries in personal relationships... I'd spent nine careful years maintaining all of Aiden's principles.

The other sutras and this one refer to how these 5 Kleshas are just not allowing the Purusha to disengage from the ego. The focus of this thread is Raga defined as attachments. 

So today I was finally on Amazon to look for a manual coffee grinder. I am a coffee aficionado. A few years ago I moved from instant coffee to coffee powders (to be used in a french press, a filter etc). Then just a few months ago, finally took the next leap and got into beans. One morning ritual is to take the medium roast beans...roast them more to the level I want, grind and then make my coffee. It relaxes me. That lil bit of ME time in this chaotic world. Not everyday- only whenever my schedule allows. 

When I was looking for a proper grinder today, it just hit me: am I strengthening this Klesha of my attachment (Raga) with coffee? 

As of now, of course, i am going to purchase a coffee grinder. The only things I'll be thinking of when scrolling Amazon is:  
\- not to go over my budget,   
\- make sure it's not an impulse purchase.   
\- Also, just as a hypothetical- before clicking the pay button if there is some big news (WW3?) where i now find my salary for the unforeseeable future is not guaranteed, I will not buy it.   
I know what to prioritize money in. But in the greater scheme of things as per Yoga, how does this help? It does not.

The Ethereum co-founder has steered SharpLink to adopt ETH as its main treasury asset. This was a first for a public firm. This is bigger than some people think, it is a potential turning point for Ethereum's adoption.

Joe is the perfect person to push Ethereum forward. First, he has deep roots in Ethereum and he is also a leader at ConsenSys. He has got the know-how, fame and influence to make an impact. Starting with institutions like SharpLink, which by the way now holds nearly 300,000 ETH, he is laying the groundwork to show big players that ETH can be a smart, stable treasury choice, backed by staking rewards and infinite DeFi potential. If this works it could make everyday people use ETH for coffee runs or even rent payments!! Real adoption.

It is understandable that ETH can be a risky investment right now, but Joe Lubin's vision is very likely to bridge the gap between Wall Street and Main Street. This will make Ethereum a household name. Time will tell but this could be the thing Ethereum has been waiting for.

""Come on, Shelley. You've been waiting for Johnny for five years, haven't you?""

Egged on by the cheering crowd, Shelley Jones grinned and moved in to kiss Johnny.

I stood outside the door, watching. My fists were so tightly clenched that my knuckles turned white, and my vision started to blur with rage.

In my previous life, I'd gotten into a fender bender on the way to this party, so I'd had no clue this was happening.

I took a sharp breath and pushed open the slightly ajar door. Staring at the two locked in a deep kiss, I snapped, ""What are you doing?""

Shelley, nudged by a friend, finally noticed me. Instead of looking guilty, she casually pulled away from Johnny's arms, her tone flat. ""Just playing a game. What are you doing here?""

I let out a bitter laugh, my words dripping with sarcasm. ""Didn't you invite me? So I could watch you and this home-wrecker making out?""

The word ""home-wrecker"" hit Johnny Lopez like a punch. He grabbed Shelley's hand, his voice intense. ""Listen up, Mr. Chapman. The one who's not loved is the real problem here.""

Shelley didn't pull away. She looked at me with pure disgust, clearly backing Johnny's words.

I laughed out of anger. In just ten days, she was supposed to be my wife. Now, I'd become the other guy. How pathetic.

In my previous life, she'd looked at me with the same disgust and said, ""Micah, you're such a useless doctor. You can't perform surgery, and now you can't even write a decent research paper?""

Later, I'd finally made a breakthrough discovery, pouring my heart and soul into that paper. But she'd stolen it and handed it directly to Johnny.

I'd confronted Shelley, but she'd just sneered, ""You're a useless doctor who can't even hold a scalpel. Someone's gotta do your work, right? Micah, you should be grateful.""

What truly enraged me was how she'd gotten her hands on my family's money and then pushed my dad into a fatal heart attack. And when my mom got sick, Shelley refused to let her get treatment.

As I remembered all of this, rage burned in my chest, threatening to explode.

Maybe my glare at Shelley was too intense. She frowned, backing down for the first time. ""Micah, knock it off. Why ruin everyone's night? Just sit down.""

Johnny glanced at Shelley, smiling, ""See? I told you Mr. Chapman would get upset.""

He stepped toward me, reaching to pull me over. ""Mr. Chapman, we were just messing around. No hard feelings, okay?""

Without thinking, I shoved his hand away, my eyes wild. ""Get away from me!""

In my previous life, after my research was stolen, I only wanted justice. I'd protested at home and online, only to get crushed by the public pressure. No one believed I was capable of that work.

When I stood on that rooftop, Shelley and Johnny showed up. Johnny was all talk about saving me, but as he got closer, he shoved me off.

I'd never forget the smugness in his eyes as he smirked, ""Micah, everything of yours is mine now. Enjoy watching from hell.""

Those memories hit me like a tidal wave, and my body started shaking uncontrollably, wracked with nothing but raw, burning rage and hatred.

Johnny fell, his head smacking into the edge of the coffee table. Blood welled up on his scalp right away.

I'd been glaring at him, so in that split second, I saw it clear as day: he'd twisted his body on purpose, guiding himself into that hit.

Shelley's eyes welled up with tears. She rushed over, helped him up, and gently wiped away the blood.

Johnny gave a weak, pitiful smile. ""Shelley, it's fine. Mr. Chapman didn't mean it. I just tripped.""

Same old trick‚Äîevery time we clashed, he'd play the victim, turning it all around on me.

And Shelley bought it hook, line, and sinker. She believed every word without question. But me? In her eyes, I was just a jealous, cruel monster.

My gaze remained icy, my voice cutting. ""Johnny did that on purpose. It had nothing to do with me.""

""Micah, are you done? First the attitude, and now you're trying to blame him?"" Shelley snapped, defending Johnny. ""You need to apologize‚Äînow.""

A bitter, mocking smile tugged at my lips. ""Shelley, let's call off the wedding in ten days. We're done.""

# Chapter 2 Is This How You Love Me?

Shelley froze for a moment after hearing me. But knowing how obsessed I'd been with her, she just scoffed. ""Micah, are you serious? Cancel the wedding? You don't get to make that call.""

The crowd around us burst into laughter.

""Weren't you head over heels for Shelley, Micah? How can you say that? This is insane.""

""Come on, just apologize and get it over with.""

Everyone assumed I'd back down, because I loved her. But loving her had left me with nothing.

That love had already died when she betrayed me in my previous life. By the time I took my last breath, it was gone, burned to ashes. Now, all I felt for Shelley was hate.

""I'll get all the invitations back,"" I said, ignoring the crowd. My eyes stayed cold on Shelley, my voice final. ""We're done.""

With that, I pulled off my wedding ring and tossed it at her.

I'd searched every jewelry store in Driston to find that ring‚Äîone of a kind, custom-made. In my previous life, I wore it until the day I died. But now, I wanted nothing to do with it.

Shelley stared at the ring rolling across the floor, her eyes wide with disbelief‚Äîthere was even a flicker of panic in them.

But I didn't care. I just turned and walked away, leaving the crowd buzzing behind me.

""He's for real this time, isn't he? He took off the ring.""

""Probably just another drama. He always pulls stunts like this.""

""Yeah, Johnny must've really gotten under his skin.""

""Let's be real‚Äîif he hadn't chased Shelley back then, and if Johnny hadn't left the country, he would've never stood a chance.""

Just as I reached the private room door, Shelley's voice cut through the air. ""Micah, stop! You don't need to apologize‚Äîjust quit acting out, okay?""

Even now, she thought she hadn't done anything wrong and I was throwing a tantrum.

I paused, glancing back at her with a cold stare.

The room was dimly lit; she couldn't read my expression. She stepped closer, gently touching my sleeve. ""Don't be mad. It was just a joke.""

I pulled away, took a step back, and said flatly, ""Don't touch me with hands that have been on another guy.""

Shelley was used to me bending over backwards for her, always giving in and practically begging. She loved displaying how much I'd put up with. So, when I shot back, her face darkened.

Her fingers clenched as she hissed, ""Micah, do you have to embarrass me in front of everyone? Can't you even take a joke?""

I glanced down at her. ""It's not about taking a joke. You two just don't know where to draw the line. And I'm not into sharing.""

The word ""sharing"" sucked the air out of the room. It landed like a punch, branding Shelley as some disposable hookup.

Shelley's mouth twitched, her voice tight with anger. ""Micah, if you walk out that door, I'll never forgive you.""

I shot her a sideways glance, a faint, mocking laugh escaping me. ""I hope you mean it.""

Stepping out of the bar, I let out a long sigh. My phone kept buzzing, and I pulled it out to check.

Raymond Duncan, our department head, was texting‚Äîeveryone needed to come in ASAP. A massive highway pileup, tons of casualties being rushed to the hospital.

This happened in my previous life too, but back then, I'd been injured, stuck in a hospital bed, unable to help.

I'd planned to head home first, telling my parents about calling off the wedding. But with lives on the line, the hospital took priority.

I pulled an insane shift, performing five back-to-back surgeries. By the time I staggered out of the OR, I was dead on my feet.

I changed into my street clothes and checked my phone. There were twenty-odd missed calls‚Äîall from Shelley. I narrowed my eyes, hesitated for a second, then hit callback.

The moment she answered, she erupted. ""Micah Chapman, are your patients more important than my dad? He just had a heart attack, and you ghosted me! Is this how you love me?""

# Chapter 3 Why Obsess Over This?

Shelley's family owned a private hospital‚Äîher dad had plenty of doctors on call. And in my previous life, her dad never had a heart attack. I'd bet this was just another one of her manipulation tactics.

After her rant, I let out a dry laugh. ""We broke up, Shelley. Find another doctor for your dad. I don't even work at your family's hospital. Where do you get the nerve to boss me around?""

Without waiting for her response, I cut the call.

Skipping going home, I grabbed a quick bite in the office, then crashed for a few hours. But my dreams were a nightmare reel.

Shelley's cruelty, indifference, all those gut-wrenching moments that nearly broke me‚Äîsleep was anything but restful.

I jolted awake at the memory of falling from that rooftop. Sweat beaded on my skin, my face ghostly pale.

""Bad dream?"" Shelley's voice cut through, her eyes bloodshot as she stared me down.

I paused, frowning hard. My coworkers knew how whipped I used to be. So, when she walked in, they didn't even try to stop her. But something was off about her look.

She stood in front of me, one hand resting lightly on my desk, her expression cool. ""Micah, why were you calling my name in your sleep?""

I met her gaze, forcing down the hatred bubbling inside. ""Dreams are just dreams.""

Shelley dropped the dream thing, suddenly grabbing my hand. ""Come check on my dad.""

I didn't move an inch. In fact, I yanked my hand away, flexed my wrist, and said coldly, ""I don't work for your family's hospital. You can't tell me what to do.""

I worked at Driston Central Hospital. Taking private cases was strictly against hospital policy.

Her hand fell empty. She paused, then flashed a smile, leaning in slowly. ""You've been holding a grudge since yesterday. Want me to grovel and beg? I'm here now. Cut the drama, okay?""

I know Shelley's temper‚Äîthis was already her way of bending over backward.

I looked up at her, smiling coldly. ""I'm not throwing a tantrum. Your hospital's got plenty of top doctors. Why drag me into this? To put on a show? Your dad is not my patient. Not my problem.""

Shelley stared, stunned, like she couldn't believe her ears. ""He's your future father-in-law. How can you be like this?""

Father-in-law? What a sick joke. In my previous life, I treated him like family. Yet he saw me as nothing but a slave, a living punching bag to vent his anger on whenever he felt like it.

He always thought I was incompetent. Calling me worthless, crushing my spirit, chipping away at my confidence until I was nothing but a shell of myself‚Äîhe'd helped push me over the edge.

""Once you're dead,"" he'd said, ""my daughter can marry someone better. You're just in her way.""

Looking back, it was beyond ridiculous.

How blindly had I loved Shelley in my previous life? Enough to keep trusting her even after she betrayed me‚ÄîI was such an idiot.

I snapped back to reality and smirked, ""Shelley, we're done. Your business has nothing to do with me anymore!""

Shelley's brows furrowed sharply. ""I don't agree! Everyone knows we're getting married in nine days. What the hell are you playing at? Is this because of Johnny?

""I explained yesterday‚Äîit was just a game, nothing more. Why are you being so obstinate about this?""

# Chapter 4 Cutting My Losses

Maybe it was how I kept mentioning the breakup or how casually I dismissed her dad's condition, but a hint of panic crept into Shelley's voice.

I locked eyes with her. ""Is this my fault? I made you mess around with someone else?""

A mocking smile played on my lips. ""Fine, I'll help your dad. But first, go public with me to admit we've broken up and call off the wedding.""

Shelley's eyes widened. She finally seemed to realize that I meant every word‚ÄîI'd never joked about a life.

She stepped closer, her gaze intense. ""Micah, are you seeing someone else? Cheating before we're even married?""

I laughed coldly. ""You're still tangled up with your true love, and now you have the nerve to come accusing me? Do you even deserve to?""

Shelley's face flickered. She took a deep breath, probably weighing her options. Suddenly, she wrapped her arms around me, pressing her head to my chest and nuzzling softly.

""Micah, yesterday was just a joke. Don't take it so seriously. If you're upset, I'll stop hanging out with them,"" she whispered. ""I said yes to your proposal, remember? What are you so worried about?""

With that, she tilted her head up, leaning in for a kiss.

I turned away, dodging her lips. My eyes landed on her collarbone, where two tiny letters were inked: JL.

I'd asked about it once before, but she'd brushed me off irritably, saying, ""I just thought they look cool together. Got them tattooed on a whim.""

Like an idiot, I'd smiled and agreed.

My fingertips gently slipped into her clothes. She stiffened, her brow twitching.

She hated it when I touched her. All these years ""in love,"" I never pushed, because she never wanted it. I'd told myself to respect her, never noticing the disgust that flickered in her eyes now and then.

""Johnny Lopez."" I traced the letters, a sarcastic smile playing on my lips. ""Those are his initials, right?""

Shelley instantly denied it. ""No, you're reading too much into this.""

I chuckled, ""In all these years we've been together, you never once reached out to Johnny?""

After Johnny left the country, Shelley had been a mess for a long time. Back then, I was head over heels for her and couldn't stand seeing her so broken. I went all out to lift her spirits and win her over.

When she finally agreed to be my girlfriend, I thought I'd conquered the world.

Shelley bristled at my interrogation tone, like I was digging into her most private secrets. ""This isn't worth fighting over,"" she said.

She was dodging my question‚ÄîI saw right through her. ""Shelley, don't you feel cheap?"" I asked again.

Her eyes went wide with shock.

I let go of her, my gaze icy.

She stumbled backward, her chest heaving. Gritting her teeth, she snapped, ""You begged me to marry you! Don't you remember? Who'd even want you? Look at yourself‚Äî""

I shot her a frigid glance, cutting her off. ""You think you even deserve to belittle me?""

Shelley realized her little jabs weren't landing, frustration flickering across her face.

Suddenly, her phone rang. She picked it up, and in the next instant, her expression dropped.

After hanging up, she fixed me with a venomous stare. ""Did you tell your dad to pull funding from Jones Group?""

She shook with rage. ""Do you have any idea what that means? You can't just cut money like that. The hospital's research projects will collapse, and Jones Group will go under!""

I crossed my arms over my chest, watching her with zero sympathy. ""What does that have to do with me? Since we've broken up, all ties between us must be cut off completely.

""Your research projects don't even have government approval, but you kept bleeding Chapman Group dry. I'm just cutting my losses before it's too late.""

Back in college, I'd ignored my parents' wishes, pursued medicine. I was just a figurehead at our family company. But because of my relationship with Shelley, my dad had always helped and supported Jones Group.

However, now, I was done carrying their weight.

# Chapter 5 Let You Have Johnny

I caught the flash of rage in Shelley's eyes and let out a cold laugh. ""There's no contract between us. That investment was never legit to begin with.""

Shelley froze. She'd been the one pushing for no paperwork. Now, she was facing the consequences‚Äîno one to blame but herself.

She pointed a finger at me, her mouth opening, but no words came out. Her phone rang again; she took a sharp breath and rushed off, heading back to her company.

After she left, a coworker walked in, looking uncertain. ""You had a fight with her?""

I shook my head. ""I broke up with her.""

He clearly didn't buy it and tried to persuade me. ""Come on, you're getting married soon. Couples fight but make up quickly.""

I just smiled, not bothering to argue. I'd prove it through my actions.

\*\*\*\*\*

By the time I got home after work, it was past ten. My parents were still up, sitting in the living room.

Their faces were dead serious, like they'd been discussing something heavy. When they saw me, they went silent.

I went to the kitchen, poured them each a glass of water, and handed them over. ""Mom, Dad, just tell me what's on your mind.""

They must've heard about Shelley and me.

Dad spoke up cautiously. ""Heard you pulled funding from Jones Group?""

I responded with a soft ""Hmm,"" my posture calm and composed.

Their eyes widened. Mom pressed on, ""And you're calling off the wedding?""

I nodded. After taking a sip of water, I smiled, my voice steady. ""We're not right for each other.""

Mom automatically reached out, feeling my forehead. ""You don't have a fever,"" she mumbled.

I gently took her hand and held it. ""You two aren't happy about me ending things?""

Their expressions were complicated.

""Honey,"" Mom sighed, her voice soft but heavy. ""I know how crazy you were about her. This... it worries me. Are you really okay?""

My parents had never taken a liking to Shelley. Time and again, they'd warned me she wasn't being genuine, yet I'd clashed with them so fiercely over it that we'd nearly cut ties.

In my previous life, I'd let Shelley sweet-talk me into losing all sense. I'd even handed over our family company on a silver platter.

Once I was useless to her, she'd tossed me aside like trash. Then, she brought Johnny home, flaunting their love right in my face.

Back then, I'd begged Shelley to spare my parents. But she's just said, ""This is the retribution your family deserves!""

Retribution? Falling for Shelley was my retribution.

Now, my parents were alive and well, not yet crushed by my past mistakes, and a weight lifted from my chest.

Perhaps I'd been quiet for too long, because Mom glanced over at me, a flicker of worry crossing her eyes.

I patted her hand, my voice soft. ""It's late, Mom. Get some rest. I mean it‚Äîno need to worry.""

Then I went back to my room and contacted a private investigator, asking him to track Shelley.

Shelley and Johnny definitely didn't just meet recently. Details I'd ignored before came flooding into my mind.

Sometimes, Shelley took off for a while under the pretext of a business trip. Every time she came back, she'd be glowing with happiness and even spare me a few kind words.

She'd light up over cheap trinkets while the expensive jewelry I bought collected dust.

\*\*\*\*\*

The next morning, my phone pinged with a high-def video from the private investigator.

In the video, Shelley was drunk. ""Let's be together, Johnny,"" she slurred, drunk, leaning into him, eyes glazed. ""Don't leave again.""

Johnny kissed her, half-reluctant, half-eager, and things escalated quickly.

Suddenly, Shelley sobered up. She pressed her face to his chest, her voice soft and coquettish. ""Not now. I can't let Micah suspect anything. Just a little longer, Johnny. Be patient.""

Johnny twirled a strand of her hair between his fingers, his expression soft and tender. No matter how long I have to wait, I will.""

They looked like tragic lovers, while I was the villain tearing them apart.

Rage burned in my gut. It seemed that they'd been in touch all along, laughing behind my back and making me a fool.

I'd planned to take my time and make them pay slowly. But now‚Äîseeing their intimate hugging, listening to their sweet talk‚Äîmy anger was about to explode.

My fingers gripped my phone so hard my knuckles turned white, and my face went pale.

She had been playing me from the beginning. But I was a fool who thought she might actually care about me, who believed kindness could melt her icy heart.

I narrowed my eyes. Since Shelley was so damn determined to be with Johnny, I'd make sure they got exactly what they wanted.

# Chapter 6 Why Would I Help You?

I had just walked into the hospital when Shelley called.

It was like she'd completely forgotten our fight, and her voice was almost sweet. ""Micah, let's go take our wedding photos. The wedding's already set. Can we just stop fighting, please?""

I knew she only cared because I'd cut her funding, and Jones Group was going under. It was always about what she could get.

I listened, my tone flat. ""After work.""

I'd asked her to take these photos three times before. But every single time, she'd bailed on me with some excuse.

First, she said she had a business trip. Second, there was some ""super important"" collaboration.

Third, I'd booked an outdoor shoot like she wanted‚Äîonly for her to stand me up. I waited in the rain for three hours, and ended up getting really sick. And she had never once come to check on me.

After hanging up, I headed straight to the clinic. Once my shift ended, I pulled out my phone and checked the private investigator's latest messages.

A sharp scoff escaped me. Shelley wasn't trying to take wedding photos with me at all. She'd just used it as an excuse to meet Johnny.

The photos the private investigator sent to me told the whole story‚Äîthey were making out in the studio, not even trying to hide it.

After work, I went straight home‚Äîno stop at the photography studio.

Shelley called, her voice sharp with anger. ""I waited for you at the studio for three hours. What the hell is wrong with you? Is standing me up some kind of game?""

I knew she hated looking like an idiot. But I simply drawled, ""Kinda is. Worked for you three times, didn't it?""

She went silent.

Then I heard laughter in the background. Johnny called, ""Shelley, come on!""

""Shelley, you know exactly how long you waited there,"" I sneered.

The private investigator had confirmed she hadn't even stuck around half an hour before leaving with Johnny.

Shelley paused. Then the noise faded‚Äîprobably she'd stepped somewhere quiet. Her voice turned desperate. ""We'll go tomorrow, okay? I promise.""

I just hung up, cold and silent.

The private investigator texted me. Shelley and Johnny were at a bar, and they'd already gotten totally carried away.

\*\*\*\*\*

The next morning, I had just stepped out of my house when Shelley blocked my way. She smiled, ""I booked the studio for today. Take the day off from the hospital.""

It wasn't a request‚Äîit was a demand.

She tried to loop her arm through mine, but I dodged. As I tried to walk around her, she stepped directly in my path, blocking me.

""We're getting married soon. How can we not have wedding photos?"" she insisted, her eyes stubborn.

She didn't take our breakup seriously at all. She was dead set on the idea that I loved her too much to leave. And she was hell-bent on getting those photos today.

After a pause, she pressed her lips together, her voice softening slightly. ""Micah, just one day. That's all I'm asking.""

I agreed to go with her.

During the drive, Shelley started fishing for information. ""I heard Chapman Group just funded a school. Why? Those usually don't make any money.""

I shrugged it off. ""I'm just a figurehead at the company. Investment decisions aren't up to me.""

She kept driving, talking as if I hadn't even spoken. ""Our hospital's research project is solid. If it works out, we'll win awards, and Chapman Group will benefit too. Just talk to your dad. He spoils you‚Äîhe'll definitely say yes.""

Her constant nagging was getting on my nerves. I snapped, ""Bring the approval papers, and we'll sign a contract. No contract, no money.""

# Chapter 7 Enjoy Your Photo Shoot

I shot back bluntly, ""We run a business, not a charity. Go borrow the money yourself. Let's see which bank would lend a dime to Jones Group.""

Jones Group's private hospitals were in total shambles. They'd used cheap, dangerous drugs that had killed patients. Their reputation was destroyed, and most of their hospitals had already shut down.

Now, Shelley was suddenly eager to take wedding photos. I knew exactly what her next move would be‚Äîmarriage.

Once she married me, she could use the Chapman Group name to secure a bank loan and rescue some hospitals. If my research paid off, they might even make a comeback.

In my previous life, my research breakthrough had single-handedly saved Jones Group overnight.

Shelley's eyes wavered, and she seemed momentarily speechless. ""Micah,"" she finally said, ""you weren't this harsh.""

""It depends on who I'm dealing with,"" I replied, closing my eyes and avoiding her mad look.

Thirty minutes later, we arrived at the photography studio. Before we even entered, a familiar voice called out, ""Shelley, Mr. Chapman, here for wedding photos?""

Shelley's face instantly brightened when she saw Johnny.

I stood to the side, staying silent.

Shelley glanced at me. ""Johnny's friend owns this place. Let's go in together. Maybe we can score a discount.""

I didn't call out their little act, just shrugged, and followed her inside.

Halfway through, the hospital called. A patient's condition had worsened and needed emergency treatment. After giving instructions, I headed to the dressing room.

Right then, I caught Johnny helping Shelley zip her dress. Her bare back was completely exposed, his hand resting intimately on her lower back. They stood incredibly close, their body language screaming tension.

Johnny had changed into a suit and looked sharp‚Äîthey looked perfectly matched.

The salesperson smiled and said to him, ""Your wife looks amazing in this wedding dress. You two make a perfect couple.""

Shelley blushed, not contradicting the comment.

Johnny, looking slightly embarrassed, murmured, ""Let's go with this one, Shelley? It really suits your skin tone.""

Shelley nodded, smiling softly.

I walked in, sneering, ""Since when do a homewrecker get to act so openly?""

The salesperson froze, her face flushing with embarrassment.

Johnny's expression went stiff. He forced a laugh and said, ""Mr. Chapman, I was just trying this on to see if it goes with Shelley's dress. Don't misunderstand.""

He stepped back, his voice sounding hurt. ""Shelley cares about you. I'll go change right away.""

Shelley hated seeing Johnny upset. She whirled on me, eyes blazing. ""Johnny's my friend. Can't you show some respect?""

Then she softened, turning to Johnny. ""I'm sorry about him. Don't take it personally.""

Watching their little exchange made my stomach churn. ""Do whatever you want. I'm heading back to the hospital‚ÄîI don't have time for this drama,"" I sneered, knowing Johnny's appearance was obviously a territorial move.

I turned to leave, but his voice stopped me. ""Are you jealous, Mr. Chapman? There's nothing between Shelley and me. She really cares about you. You two shouldn't fight over me.""

I spun around. ""Jealous of you? Take a good look in the mirror. Do you seriously think you're worth it?""

Johnny's face froze.

Shelley frowned.

My voice stayed calm. ""Mr. Lopez, cut the act. You claim you're just friends with Shelley, but you're always hanging around like a desperate third wheel. That's pretty pathetic.""

My eyes raked over him, landing on the ring on his finger. No wonder the salesperson got confused‚ÄîShelley was wearing the same one.

The two were really shameless; they'd even snuck on ""wedding rings"" right under my nose.

I glanced at their matching outfits and scoffed. ""Enjoy your photo shoot. I'm out.""

Shelley rushed over and grabbed my arm. ""I'm supposed to marry you. What's the point of taking wedding photos with someone else?""

""Oh, so you suddenly remember you're marrying me?"" I fired back. ""Then why are you wearing a ring with him?""

""You're already making out with him in front of everyone,"" I pressed, my gaze cutting, ""What happens after we're married? You two gonna hop into bed together?""

# Chapter 8 Just Friends?

Shelley couldn't handle any one of my questions. Her eyes darted away, and she instinctively pulled her hand back and hid it behind her, too scared to meet my gaze.

I'd given her an engagement ring‚Äîa ring she'd never bothered to wear. How ironic.

Shelley froze, then huffed defensively. ""I'm just used to wearing this ring. Why are you making such a big deal?

""What you said is an insult to me and Johnny! We've been together for years, and this is how you see me? Micah, you're seriously disappointing me.""

I was so mad I almost laughed and clapped for her. She had to be the first person who could make cheating sound so incredibly innocent.

I flicked a glance at Johnny in the dressing room. His eyes were gleaming with an undeniable smirk.

I looked back down at Shelley, my voice flat. ""Believe whatever you want. Anyway, I'm not marrying you.""

Shelley's face went pale in an instant.

I didn't spare her another look. I turned and walked out.

\*\*\*\*\*

Back at the hospital, I'd barely entered the exam room when a critical patient was rushed in.

As I saw the woman on the stretcher, my breath caught. A strange, sudden wave of panic and guilt washed over me‚ÄîYetta Sampson arrived earlier than I'd expected.

The doctor with her said, ""Her heart stopped twice en route. It's cardiogenic‚Äîshe needs immediate surgery.""

I clenched my fists, my voice tight. ""Get her to the OR.""

As I moved to prep, the doctor called after me, ""Her health's been terrible for a while. She's been to every hospital in town. Dr. Chapman, please, you're her last hope.""

I nodded. Although Yetta's symptoms etched into my mind like a permanent scar, I still demanded every minute detail, meticulously thorough.

Memories from my previous life flooded back. Last time, I'd been so distracted by thoughts of Shelley during surgery that I'd royally screwed up, badly.

My father had covered up the mistake, but the real reason it didn't explode? Yetta never sued.

She'd survived, but with lifelong complications. Her heart deteriorated, and she had only five years to live.

In all my years as a doctor, that had been the one thing I could never shake‚Äîthe crushing guilt.

Yetta lay silent on the operating table, her skin as pale as a ghost. The nurses had prepped her exactly to my specifications.

I took her hand, giving it a gentle squeeze. ""Yetta, trust me. I'll make this right. You'll be okay.""

Yetta wasn't fully unconscious‚Äîpain kept her alert. She struggled to open her eyes, her gaze drifting until it found me.

I smiled softly, ""Just rest. Everything will be fine when you wake up.""

The surgery lasted nearly five hours. When it ended, the entire team let out a long breath, exhaustion hitting hard.

My assistant looked at me. ""That one had me on edge. You really care about this patient, don't you?""

I pressed my lips together, ache filling my chest. Yetta was the one person I'd ever truly wronged. Even after performing surgeries countless times, my hands had trembled. I'd been terrified‚Äîterrified of failing again, of leaving her broken.

Fortunately, it had gone perfectly. The anesthesia was still holding, though, so Yetta stayed asleep. I didn't leave her side.

Her face remained pale, her small frame swallowed by the hospital bed. Her brows were tightly knit, like she was in discomfort. I watched, and something in my chest just softened.

In my previous life, when everyone else had abandoned me, only Yetta had believed in me. She'd insisted the work was mine, that I'd been set up.

But we had no proof. Shelley, knowing how much I loved her, had secretly handed all my original research notes to Johnny in advance.

I'd trusted her too completely and paid for it with a backstab.

The first thing that caught my eye was the spotless ceiling.

The high ceiling, several meters tall, was adorned with an antique painting.

*Is it because I haven't seen it in a while? Or am I still not used to it?* The last time I saw it was when I was heading towards Hubei Province along the Yangtze River, so it‚Äôs been about two months since I returned.

Maybe that's why everything around me feels unfamiliar.

As I lay there feeling the soft touch of the blanket, staring at the ceiling for a while, I suddenly spoke up.

‚ÄúWhat was the title of that painting again?‚Äù

A soft voice responded.

‚ÄúThe original title is the Sistine Ceiling, but it's better known domestically as *The Genesis*. It's a masterpiece created by Michelangelo Buonarroti, a sculptor and painter of the Renaissance era.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, Michelangelo. That's right.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you heard of him?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs quite famous. Are you looking down on me because I have a GPA of 7?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat does your GPA have to do with anything? Right now, Jin Taekyung, you're much more famous than that painting.‚Äù

Soft leather slippers tapped against the marble floor.

As I turned my face, half-buried in the pillow, I saw a figure crossing the vast space.

*How does that guy look so handsome every time I see him?*

If he were just a bit less perfect, I might feel jealous, but he's so beyond that level that all I can do is admire him.

Especially since his looks are complemented by an aura that makes them feel natural.

I grinned at him, whom I was seeing for the first time in two months.

‚ÄúLong time no see, Team Leader Choi.‚Äù

The handsome man in a silk robe, Team Leader Choi, stopped in his tracks at my greeting.

‚ÄúYou speak as if you‚Äôve returned from a long journey.‚Äù

‚ÄúI had a dream of a place far away. A very long one.‚Äù

I had stayed in **Murim** for over two months, so my words were no lie.

In fact, considering all that had happened, two months felt like a short time.

""Seems like it wasn't a bad dream.""

""No, not really. I had to fight a dragon right from the start.""

""A dragon, you say?""

""Well, it's a bit different, but close enough.""

""Sounds like a nightmare. It's better to wake up quickly from those.""

Click.

Team Leader Choi placed the coffee cup he was holding on the bedside table.

""Here, drink this.""

""Is it some ridiculously expensive coffee made from cat poop or something?""

If it's anything like that coffee made from **Hyuk Mujin's** poop last time, I'll pass.

As I eyed the coffee cup suspiciously, a familiar scent hit my nose, making my eyes widen.

""Huh?""

Seeing my expression, Team Leader Choi chuckled.

""It's instant coffee. Gold blend. Strong.""

""Wow, Team Leader Choi, you really know your stuff.""

""At the very least, I know that Jin Taekyung and gourmet coffee don't mix well.""

""Good. Ten points to Gryffindor.""

Giving him a thumbs-up, I downed the coffee in one go.

Ah, this is it. Cheap but sweet.

Finally, something from the modern world that makes me feel alive again.

""Ah, that's good. This really wakes me up.""

""Does it? Well, you did sleep longer than usual today.""

Like other awakened ones or **Murim** warriors, I don't need much sleep, having surpassed human limits. Even if I do sleep, it's rarely more than two hours, and that's just for my own satisfaction.

*Unless I've really overworked my body or my mind is exhausted, it's not a problem.*

If someone like me sleeps for several hours as if dead, it's bound to raise suspicion.

Yawning widely, I stretched.

""Are you alright?""

""Sometimes I have days like this. Maybe all the fatigue hit me at once.""

Rubbing my eyes, I reached out.

Using Void Grasping, I pulled my smartphone from the bedside table into my hand like a magnet.

*Maybe it's because it's been a while, but this feels really strange.*

One of the disorienting things I experience every time I return to reality. I awkwardly tapped the screen to check the current time.

7:05 AM.

It's seven in the morning. I remember lying down shortly after midnight, so I must have slept for about seven hours...

""Huh?""

What's this? The date looks strange.

Staring at the smartphone screen, a thought suddenly struck me, making my eyes widen.

""Oh. I forgot because so much has happened.""

Today is a special day. That's why I returned to my room after midnight.

And just as the realization hit me, Team Leader Choi's voice reached my ears.

""As I mentioned last night, I need to say it again.""

Swish.

With an outstretched hand, he spoke in a low voice.

""Let's have a good year, Jin Taekyung.""

January 1, 2047.

That's right. Today marks the beginning of a new year in the modern world. And...

""Happy birthday.""

It's also my twenty-eighth birthday.

""Damn. Already?""

Just as the looming number thirty darkened my vision, two people burst in with a loud noise from afar.

""Hey! Twenty-eight! Mom says to eat seaweed soup!"" ""Congratulations on your birth!""

Correction. Those aren't people; they're **The Three Monsters**.

My long-time nemesis and family register mate, Hayeon, and the blonde foreigner next to her, the Skeleton King.

Seeing the two of them, I let out a deep sigh.

The time difference between **Murim** and the modern world is staggering.

From what I've learned so far, the moment you cross over to one world, time in the other flows very slowly. Ten days in **Murim** is equivalent to one hour in the modern world, so it's no wonder I sometimes feel disoriented.

*Especially with everything that happened this time.*

There were rapid changes both in **Murim** and the modern world.

And among those changes was this mansion where I currently reside.

Every step I took echoed on the gleaming white marble, surrounded by antique paintings and sculptures.

And above all...

""Wow, this place is ridiculously huge.""

It's vast. So vast that it leaves you speechless.

Even if I combined all the places I've used as lodgings while traveling between the two worlds, they wouldn't compare to the scale of this mansion.

But the mansion's owner didn't seem to think so.

""As you said, Mr. Jin Taekyung, it is quite large. It requires a lot of upkeep,"" Team Leader Choi said, and Hayeon, who had been following behind, suddenly spoke up.

""For a place that needs a lot of upkeep, I don't see anyone else around, right, mister?""

She wasn't referring to Team Leader Choi.

With hair like melted gold and mysterious golden eyes, the foreigner who looked like he could be a Hollywood heartthrob frowned.

""Surely, you didn't call me for this.""

Hayeon replied without missing a beat.

""That's right.""

""Huh.""

The foreigner, the Skeleton King, who had been reborn in human form thanks to Magic Johnson's illusion magic, let out a chuckle.

""You must be mistaken. As far as I know, 'mister' refers to an older male relative or a middle-aged man in this country.""

The Skeleton King, momentarily at a loss for words, squeezed out his voice.

""So what I'm saying is...

""You‚Äôre over thirty, right? So, you're a mister to me.""

""Well, I am over thirty, but...

""Oh, I get it. So you're a mister, but you don't like being called that, right?""

The golden eyes trembled. The Skeleton King, who had stopped in his tracks and was glaring at Hayeon, muttered.

""They say blood is thicker than water. You two are definitely siblings.""

Hayeon and I answered simultaneously.

""I'm an only child.""

""I'm an only child too, mister.""

Good grief, now there are two of these wicked humans.

With eyes that seemed to say just that, the Skeleton King looked back and forth between Hayeon and me before shaking his head in resignation.

""Alright, alright, both of you, knock it off. And you, insolent human girl. If you dare call me 'mister' again...""

The Skeleton King's words were cut off.

Hayeon had stopped in her tracks, staring at him with vacant eyes.

""What... did you just say?""

""No, that's not what I meant. I misspoke.""

The Skeleton King, glancing at me for help, was busy trying to smooth things over, while Team Leader Choi sighed as if he had been expecting this.

""You've really done it now. I'll take him away, so Mr. Jin Taekyung, please calm your sister down and make sure there's no misunderstanding.""

What the hell is this?

I blinked at Team Leader Choi.

""Why?""

""Pardon?""

""No, why do I need to calm her down?""

""What do you mean why? Miss Hayeon just heard some very insulting words...""

Just as Team Leader Choi was about to continue, Hayeon suddenly spoke up.

""Insolent human girl? Is that something you say to a person, you damn foreigner?""

""Huh?""

""...What?""

Here we go. I couldn't help but smile warmly.

*She's still the same.*

Yeah, this is the real Hayeon.

As my capillaries swelled with pride, I finally felt like I was back in the modern world. At that moment, Hayeon whipped her head towards me.

""Did you hear that? What that Yankee bastard just said?""

I nodded silently.

""I heard it.""

""Did he catch you doing something? Did you get caught filming a body cam or something? Why are you hanging out with a guy like that? That piece of trash...""

She was pretty spot on. I answered, impressed.

""Oh, right. He's really not human.""

""He called me an insolent human girl. Is he insane? How can he say something like that?""

""Well, it is just words. Just bad ones.""

""I'd rather he just called me a crazy bitch or something. What's with 'human girl'? It feels so disgusting.""

I pulled out my smartphone and whispered.

""Siri, what's the weather like today?""

* The weather today is clear.

""Are you kidding me? Do you think this is the time for jokes? Your only sister just got insulted by someone else!""

I quickly straightened my clothes and bowed politely.

""Hello, my name is Jin Taekyung, and I'm an only child.""

""This guy is a real nutcase.""

""You're being quite harsh for a first meeting. I'll sue you for defamation.""

In that moment, Hayeon's eyes turned icy cold.

""I'm telling Mom everything.""

""What?""

""I'm telling Mom everything, from start to finish.""

""Are you threatening me right now?""

Heh.

""You little...!""

I grabbed the Skeleton King by the collar with all my might.

Oh, of course, not Hayeon, but the Skeleton King.

""Apologize to my sister right now! You monster of a man!""

""I-I'm sorry! I was wrong! I'll apologize a hundred times, just please...

""Of course, she's insolent! And human! And a girl! But you can't just string those together like that!""

""Ugh! Ugh!""

""Say it properly! Use the right words!""

""Insolent! Human! Girl!""

Boom.

I thought I heard a sound like an explosion.

That was the sound of Hayeon's rage gauge maxing out, and she grabbed the nearest plaster statue.

""Die, both of you just die!""

Whoosh! Crash!

The hallway turned into a battlefield in an instant.

Hayeon charged like a fierce Viking warrior, and Team Leader Choi stood there, dumbfounded, watching the chaos unfold.

""What's all this commotion when I called you for dinner...!""

At the end of the hallway, the elevator installed inside the mansion opened, and a familiar face emerged, looking stern.

Dear Mrs. Kim Junghee. My mother.

""...What are you doing, you two?""

Despite her petite frame of barely 160 centimeters, I felt an aura from her that rivaled the Ten Kings.",1,1752489373.0,u_Dry_Code_7119,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm using this Reddit account just for writing -  very new to reddit anyway -  and haven‚Äôt posted much before, so maybe that‚Äôs a factor?

Thanks so much!

Prologue

My grandfather was a Catholic priest, through and through. His faith, unwavering in public, seemed to stand like a monument against the more fractured truth of his private life. He bore discomfort the way others might bear a calling‚Äîwith solemnity, and a kind of studied silence, as though endurance were not only expected, but sanctifying. He revered St √âtienne‚ÄîStephen‚Äîthe first to kneel beneath judgment without revoking his words. A deacon, appointed to serve, stoned for a conviction others could not bear to hear. He once sent me a small book about him, the pages brittle, the margins marked. In those quiet underlinings I think he found something to admire‚Äînot triumph, but submission. Martyrdom, to him, was not a blaze of glory but the still, obedient hush of one who believes to the end, and bears the cost without protest. Perhaps this was his way of making sense of his own divided life‚Äîthe secret whispered about in cloisters, the private sacrifice that came bundled with love and consequence.

He had a child‚Äîmy mother‚Äîwho arrived into the world as a scandal. She was conceived during an affair with a married woman, my grandmother, and that alone was enough to shape the course of several lives. My grandmother was sent away to carry the pregnancy in silence, hidden in a convent where the nuns offered more obedience than compassion, and whose midwifery training was spoken of only in whispers. After the birth, she moved counties but was allowed to remain, briefly, in her former husband‚Äôs house‚Äînot as wife, but as housekeeper, a gesture that said more about appearances than mercy. She left that life altered‚Äînot quite respectable, not quite forgiven. It was the kind of transgression the Church had no rite for, no absolution neatly prepared. Only silence, and the long echo of it.

For years, Mum and I lived with her. I remember Grandma smelling faintly of polish and lilies, moving with an upright stillness, like someone holding herself together by long habit more than conviction. Her house was the closest I ever came to safety, though even there, something low and electric hummed behind the wallpaper. The church sat nearby‚Äînot watching, but judging. And the judgment wasn‚Äôt resisted; it was received, as something righteous and enduring. My grandfather hung in a photograph above the mantel, holding me as a baby, his fingers careful, as though I might stain his sleeves. We even went to church every Sunday. Grandma never came. I didn‚Äôt understand why‚Äînot then. But some silences don‚Äôt fade. They deepen. They take root.

When Grandma moved into assisted living, my mother found us a place of our own‚ÄîKing Street. A narrow terrace with a garden of cracked paving stones and weeds that always returned, no matter how often they were pulled. I remember the door creaking as she pushed it shut with her thumb. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll make it ours,‚Äù she said, though even then her voice carried the tremor of uncertainty. I was seven or eight. The hallway sloped at a strange angle, and the curtains never quite met‚Äîlike halves of a promise no one had the strength to keep. Light came through, but it never settled.

My mother struggled to live independently. The freezer leaked a faint, sour smell. The radiators clanged like old bones waking in the walls. Bills came too often, too high. She moved through it all like someone caught in a riptide‚Äîstraining toward the shore, but dragged sideways by a stronger force. I stayed close. I made her milky coffee in the mornings. Slipped ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù notes into her coat pockets like offerings. I listened to her stories‚Äîhalf-believing, half-knowing‚Äîbecause sometimes even a child senses when a truth has been dressed up to survive.

One afternoon, she looked down at my worn school shoes and said, ‚ÄúI need to marry a rich man. Or I won‚Äôt be able to put shoes on your feet.‚Äù There was no anger in it‚Äîno sharpness, no plea. Just the flat chill of a forecast, the kind that comes after too many years of waiting for change. It was helplessness, worn smooth by repetition. I think she was tired‚Äîworn thin by the strangeness of her life, by the ache of compromises made too early and too often. And yet she clung to her faith, not as consolation but as contradiction‚Äîstill believing, somehow, in a God she imagined might disapprove of her.

She told stories like broken fairy tales, and my own origin was no exception. She said she was frightened when she learned she was pregnant, but after seeing a man with a wooden leg stumble by in an underground station, she found a strange sort of hope‚Äîif he could survive, so could she. She told me she‚Äôd hidden me in a drawer after giving birth. ‚ÄúBottom one. Next to the paracetamol,‚Äù she‚Äôd say, lighting a cigarette. I pictured myself curled there, among cotton wool and hairbrushes‚Äîhidden, but never safe. She whispered of strange things from nursing school: people who hurt themselves for attention, rumours of poison. ‚ÄúMad as anything,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSome people will do anything to be seen.‚Äù

Her stories seldom matched the world around me. There‚Äôs a photograph‚Äîme as a baby, cradled in Grandma‚Äôs arms‚Äîsoft light washing over a pink cardigan, her hands folded gently, as if offering a benediction. There was care there, even love, but it stood shadowed by contradiction. I was a child marked by the Church, yet never fully claimed by it‚Äîcaught in that silent space between belonging and exile. Even then, I sensed the dissonance, the fractures beneath the surface. Still, I was drawn to her whispered truths, captivated and wary, believing more than I dared admit.

Being the child of a priest leaves a mark that no rules can quite erase. The Church‚Äôs laws are clear about vows and silence, but they do not easily account for the lives caught in between‚Äîthose shaped by secrets too heavy to name. That weight doesn‚Äôt stay in the past. It slips into everything‚Äîthe way linens are folded, the hush when the phone rings late, the names no one speaks aloud. Grandma bore it in exile. Her daughter carried it not as grief, but as instinct‚Äîa carefulness that shaped her voice, her movements, her silences. And I inherited it too, though I didn‚Äôt yet have words for it. Only a sense that safety had to be earned through stillness. That love meant not being a burden. That disappearing was the surest way to stay.

The faith that surrounded us was not the radiant kind that ends in redemption, but a slower, quieter one‚Äîan endurance of what cannot be undone. Grace wasn‚Äôt a revelation, but a breath in the dark. And the quiet in the house was never peace.

It was the kind of silence that gathers like gas in a cellar. The kind you learn to breathe in.",1,1752489238.0,QuillandPen,0,1.0,False

If anyone wants it, comment below, and I'll find the link for you within 10 minutes.""","‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt do this.‚Äù I begged over and over, but no one was listening. I thrashed against their hold, but nothing. ‚ÄúI am your luna.‚Äù I screamed at the top of my lungs, but then his laugh from the other room broke all the fight in me. ‚ÄúLuke please.‚Äù I begged once more time, my voice horse.

‚ÄúKill it once it‚Äôs done. Toss her out. She will have to survive on her own from here on out.‚Äù

He can‚Äôt mean that. This was our baby. ‚ÄúOur baby.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs a mistake from the Moon Goddess. One I will rectify.‚Äù His voice called again from the other room. He wouldn‚Äôt even face me. ‚ÄúNow do it. That‚Äôs an order.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Alpha.‚Äù

It was a mistake to come here.

It was a mistake to give him everything.

‚ÄúOh, and doctor?‚Äù Her sweet voice called from the other room. My stepsister, Shannon. I gritted my teeth. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt use any anesthetic. She should feel everything.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Luna.‚Äù The doctor turned back to me with sad eyes, but when he picked up the scalpel, I knew I was screwed.

I‚Äôm sorry, baby. Momma couldn‚Äôt save you. She wanted you so, so much. I tried to rub my stomach, but the nurses had strapped me down. When the doctor approached, I realized he was using a silver blade.

‚ÄúSilver?‚Äù My whisper was almost silent, but he nodded. I knew then that Shannon didn‚Äôt want me to survive. She wanted my life so badly that she lied about me cheating on my mate, showing photos as proof. But I never touched another wolf, nor would I again, not after this betrayal.

Why, Moon Goddess, why would you give him to me just to take him away? My pup.

I cried silently as the doctor cut into my abdomen, and I felt my baby thrash inside. He knew it was too early to be born. This was a death sentence for both of us.

‚ÄúBring me the body of the pup.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes Alpha.‚Äù I felt every slice as he cut into me, and finally I could take it no longer. I started to scream, soon I felt the blood trickling down my side, every drip off of me hitting the floor. I thrashed against the restraints. But the silver had made me weak.

I‚Äôm sorry, baby.

They weren‚Äôt trying to keep me alive, which I expected, but I wished wasn‚Äôt true. I used to love my mate, but I felt the love die in me when I saw my pup being ripped from my belly.

‚ÄúPlease, let me hold him once.‚Äù I tried to move my arms to reach for him, but I was still tied down. The doctor, who was shedding tears, brought my pup and laid him on my chest.

He was perfect. I rubbed his scent on my face and mine on his. He would forever be a part of my soul.

My missing piece.

‚ÄúDoctor, now.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes Alpha.‚Äù The doctor picked the baby up and rushed out, leaving me spread open to the elements.

I felt my life slipping away as the door opened and Shannon came in. Her smug smile was firmly in place.

‚ÄúI told you I would take your life, Amy. I would have your mate. And I have, over and over, since he found out of your betrayal.‚Äù Shannon walked over and laid a kiss on my face as I snarled. ‚ÄúHe is perfection. And don‚Äôt worry. I will give him another son.‚Äù She laid her hand on her stomach and I started to laugh. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs so funny?‚Äù

‚ÄúI can smell the beta on you. That‚Äôs Derek's child, and it‚Äôs a girl. Nice try though.‚Äù

She snarled and raised her hand, growing her claws to deliver the final blow, but the door was ripped open and my mate, the man I now hated most in the world, stepped inside. His eyes were red, and I started to laugh again.

‚ÄúYou bitch!‚Äù He snarled and struck out, whipping Shannon to the other side of the room.

‚ÄúBrandon!‚Äù Shannon shrieked as she hit the wall. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù She staggered to her feet, but more blood dripped out of me and I closed my eyes.

‚ÄúYou lied!‚Äù He screamed, shaking the walls as his aura struck out, but I could barely feel it. I felt the silver travelling in my veins getting closer to my sluggish heart. ‚ÄúThis was my pup. I can smell me on him. He was mine.‚Äù Brandon's eyes grew redder as the tears gathered. ‚ÄúYou said she cheated on me and that it wasn‚Äôt my pup.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe did cheat on you. I guess I was wrong about the pup.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou said you smelt it.‚Äù From the sound of it, he lunged for her again, but him clutching our baby in his arm was the last thing I saw. And I wanted to never see it again. He did this to us. Not Shannon.

She played her part well, sure, but him not believing me, not waiting for a few more days to smell the pup, that was his fault. And all of our downfalls.

I prayed for the moon goddess to take me. I no longer wanted to be here. I wanted to be with my pup.

‚ÄúSave her.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Shannon screamed. ‚ÄúI am the Luna now, you marked me last night.‚Äù Ah, so that was the pain I felt last night. His betrayal had bile shoot into my mouth. ‚ÄúI am bearing your pup.‚Äù

I started to laugh again. I cracked my eyes to see my mate, Brandon, hovering next to me. ‚ÄúStay with me Amy.‚Äù

‚ÄúBeta‚Äôs baby. She is fucking‚Ä¶the beta.‚Äù I choked out the words and laughed as horror bloomed in his eyes. Blood flew from my mouth as I smiled again.

‚ÄúSave her.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù I slammed out, putting all of my power in it. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt move.‚Äù I used my Alpha strength to freeze everyone, including my mate.

‚ÄúHow?‚Äù Brandon looked down at me, pleading. ‚ÄúLet me save you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am descended from the Moon Goddess, and you don‚Äôt deserve to save me. You don‚Äôt deserve our pup. You were weak. And now you lost everything.‚Äù I smiled up at him as I felt my life from my body.

And then I was free.

I opened my eyes to find myself surprisingly alive. ‚ÄúAmy hurry, you‚Äôre going to be late.‚Äù I jolted up and look around, confused. What was going on? Where was I? ‚ÄúAmy!‚Äù The voice called again and I shook myself. I stood up from the bed and looked around again. I recognized this room. It was my childhood bedroom.¬†

I hadn‚Äôt stepped foot in this room since I found my mate, Brandon. I heard a knock on the door and my mother opened it. Before I could process what was happening, I ran into my mother‚Äôs arms. ‚ÄúMom, you‚Äôre here.‚Äù I started to cry. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve missed you so much.‚Äù

‚ÄúAmy. My girl.‚Äù She laughed as she patted my back. ‚ÄúI saw you yesterday.‚Äù She pulled back and I looked into her amber eyes that matched my own. ‚ÄúHappy birthday, baby.‚Äù

I leaned into her hands and realized that today was the last day I spent at home. I found my mate on my eighteenth birthday. ‚ÄúThank you, mom.‚Äù

‚ÄúHopefully, you will meet your mate today and start your new life.‚Äù She smiled at me and I felt my blood freeze. I didn‚Äôt want to meet Brandon. Not when I knew what was going to happen.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather stay here with you.‚Äù I smiled as I kissed her cheek. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to miss you and Morgan.

And I knew that when Brandon thought I cheated on him, before he killed my baby and me. He killed my mother for her involvement. Shannon‚Äôs father, my mother‚Äôs husband, watched her die. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I knew he loved my mother, and he was hurting, but his scheming daughter was the cause of all of this. He stood by and watched it all happen.¬†

I understood why he supported his daughter, but I didn‚Äôt like it, nor him, for that matter.

‚ÄúBaby. You won‚Äôt miss us. We will be there every step of the way.‚Äù She kissed my cheek, and I wrapped my fingers around hers.¬†

‚ÄúMom, can we just leave? You and me? Leave Shannon and Morgan and move back to daddy‚Äôs pack?‚Äù My father, the Alpha of the Silvermoon pack, wasn‚Äôt a good husband, but he was a good man. He cheated on my mother, betraying her when he was drunk. But he swore it was a mistake. It was another Alpha‚Äôs maneuverings to break them up, but my mother said it didn‚Äôt matter. It was too late.¬†

His betrayal cost the life of my brother growing inside of her, and she refused to move past it.

‚ÄúNo baby. I can‚Äôt go back.‚Äù My mother‚Äôs face fell as she turned away.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be betrayed, mom. Not like you and not any worse. I don‚Äôt want a mate.‚Äù I whispered my new truth.

‚ÄúMates don‚Äôt hurt each other, baby.‚Äù She tried to smile but I shook. I knew exactly what mates do to each other.

‚ÄúWould you be made if I refused my mate?‚Äù

‚ÄúGod no baby. The Moon Goddess makes a path clear, but it is up to us to choose it. If you don‚Äôt want your mate, you can reject him.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd if it is the Alpha‚Äôs son?‚Äù

My mother looked at me. She knew that if it was the Alpha‚Äôs son, I would be screwed. They wouldn‚Äôt allow me to leave. An Alpha has to mate his first mate, even for a day to come into his full power. ‚ÄúWhat do you know?‚Äù I watched as her eyes searched mine.

I pulled her back into my room and away from the door. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know for sure, but I am terrified that if I am mated to Shannon‚Äôs boyfriend, I will die after we are mated. Mom, the chances that he will match with an Alpha far outweigh the chance that he is mated to the daughter of the beta.‚Äù I pulled back. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want this for me.‚Äù

She weighed my words, and I watched as she came to the same conclusion. ‚ÄúOkay baby. But you can‚Äôt leave. It would be too conspicuous. You will have to mask your scent whenever he is around.‚Äù

I tossed my hands in the air. ‚ÄúHow would I do that?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere is much you don‚Äôt know that I would leave in the past but if you are sure‚Ä¶‚Äù She trailed off and I just nodded my head. ‚ÄúThen let me make a few calls. You don‚Äôt have to go to school today.‚Äù

I lept back into her arms. ‚ÄúThank you, mom. I don‚Äôt know what I would do without you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI love you, baby. You will never be without me. That I can promise you.‚Äù She kissed my cheek and then left me alone in my room.¬†

I ran to my phone and checked the date to make sure. It was twenty eighteen; I went back six years. Six years to the day that I met Brandon. I could relive everything, make better choices. I could live, and maybe this time around, so would my pup.

I rubbed my flat stomach. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, my pup. This time around, no one will hurt you.‚Äù

I went into my ensuite and jumped into the shower. No way was I going to face today, looking like I just crawled out of bed. I stood in side my closet in a towel trying to figure out what to wear when I heard my bedroom door open.¬†

I was about to turn and call out to my mother, but I heard a soft step, which my mother wouldn‚Äôt do. So I hid behind my winter coats and I waited.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm telling you, if she is Brandon‚Äôs mate, I‚Äôm going to kill her.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt mean that, Shan.‚Äù The nasily voice of Megan, Shannon‚Äôs best friend, came from the cell phone pressed to her ear.

‚ÄúOf course I do. Brandon is mine.‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly because you put out. He was hoping Shannon would notice him.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou shut your fucking mouth, Megan.‚Äù Shannon snarled and her eyes flashed. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs mine.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhatever I gotta go. Hurry the fuck up before I leave your ass,‚Äù Megan called, and then the line went dead. A honk sounded from outside and Shannon was snatching something before I grabbed her hand.¬†

‚ÄúWhat do you think you‚Äôre doing in my closet?‚Äù

‚ÄúAmy?‚Äù Shannon‚Äôs mouth dropped out. I squeezed her hand until I heard a crack. Her scream was muffled by my hand.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky I only broke one finger. You just threatened to kill me. Didn‚Äôt I hear that correctly? A beta‚Äôs daughter threatening an alpha.‚Äù I tsked.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do shit.‚Äù She snarled back at me as her hand reformed.¬†

‚ÄúLie again and I will break all of your fingers and hold them while the bones heal.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt stop my grin as I felt her tremble. ‚ÄúDid you threaten me?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù she screamed at me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to take Brandon from me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want your pathetic alpha now or ever. Keep him.‚Äù I pushed her away. ‚ÄúNow get out of my room before I change my mind about maiming you.‚Äù I turned back to my clothes and picked out low-rise jeans and a tank top.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck is your problem?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou. Now leave.‚Äù I let my wolf come forward and my eyes flashed. I pushed my alpha command into my words and forcing her out of my room. Stupid bitch. How dare she come into my room to take something of mine? My wolf growled lowly. This was our den. I shook myself and refocused. Closing the doors, I hopped back into bed, pulling out my phone. I tried to remember everything that happened in the last six years that could help me with my plan. Because make no mistake, Brandon and Shannon would pay.

‚ÄúPack your bags, Amy.‚Äù My mom came in, surprising me from the list I was making.¬†

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I looked up. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are going to spend the summer with your father. I already got the approval from the Alpha.‚Äù Mom smiled down at me. ‚ÄúCome on, baby. Pack your bag and get ready.‚Äù

I jumped to my feet and ran to my mom. ‚ÄúI can go?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust for the summer, baby, then you will be back here with me. I had to promise that you would be returning here.‚Äù

I pouted. ‚ÄúMom, I really don‚Äôt want to be here.‚Äù I wanted to make them pay, but I wouldn‚Äôt risk him finding me.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay baby, you will understand once you see your dad.‚Äù She patted my hair and kissed my cheek. ‚ÄúNow get ready.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay mom.‚Äù I kissed her back then she left me alone. I grabbed my phone to lock it and then turned back to my closet. I packed my bag and then headed into my bathroom when I heard the downstairs door slam open.¬†

‚ÄúI fucking knew it.‚Äù I heard Shannon scream down stairs. I ignored her as I grabbed everything from my bathroom and then I grabbed my laptop and chargers. I stuffed everything in to my backpack and headed downstairs.

‚ÄúShannon, why are you screaming?‚Äù Morgan was at the table with his coffee, and my mom was running around when I pushed my suitcase into the room.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not Brandon‚Äôs mate, daddy.‚Äù Shannon flew into the room and dove into his arms.¬†

‚ÄúHow are you so sure?‚Äù Morgan wrapped his arms around her, but I just snickered. She snapped her eyes to me and she flew at me.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs you. You stupid whore.‚Äù Shannon tried to claw out my eyes. But I just sent her flying with a backhand.

‚ÄúAmy!‚Äù Morgan got to his feet but my mom tsked.¬†

‚ÄúMorgan, you can‚Äôt yell ay Amy for protecting herself. Shan attacked her first.‚Äù My mom placed my breakfast on the table. ‚ÄúAmy, come eat. You have a long day ahead.‚Äù

‚ÄúBabe? Why does Amy have a suitcase?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe is going away for the summer. To her fathers.‚Äù My mother turned to me and opened her arms. ‚ÄúCome baby. Come eat. The car is coming and you need to be ready to go.‚Äù

I walked over and sat down, and dug in.¬†

‚ÄúWhy is she going to her dads?‚Äù Morgan walked over to pick Shannon up.¬†

‚ÄúShe wanted to spend the summer with her dads before college and who am I to say no?‚Äù My mom smiled down at me and I smiled back at her. I didn‚Äôt know what was going to happen this summer to protect me from Brandon finding out I was his mate, but I needed it. Whatever it was, I needed it.¬†

‚ÄúYeah, my dad called me this morning and since I haven‚Äôt seen him since Christmas break and when he offered to fly me out, I asked my mom.‚Äù I smiled sweetly over at Morgan, and Shannon smiled.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre leaving?‚Äù Shannon stood up.

‚ÄúYup. I‚Äôll be gone the full summer.‚Äù I smirked over at her. ‚ÄúBut my room is locked, and it will stay that way.‚Äù My smile dropped away as I stared at her and used my alpha command.¬†

‚ÄúAmy!‚Äù Morgan yelled out. ‚ÄúYou know you‚Äôre not allowed to alpha command your step sister!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAnd I wouldn‚Äôt have Morgan, if I hdn‚Äôt found her in my room this morning, trying to take things out of my closet.‚Äù I turned and raised my eyebrow, daring her to try to lie.¬†

‚ÄúIs that true?‚Äù Morgan looked down at Shannon and I just stared at her. I watch her open her mouth to deny it.

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt lie. I‚Äôll just command you to tell the truth.‚Äù She screeched and stomped her foot.

‚ÄúYes!‚Äù she screamed. ‚ÄúAre you happy? Yes, I went into her closet to steal some clothes because I know she is Brandon‚Äôs mate.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow?‚Äù I threw up my hands, playing like I didn‚Äôt know the truth. ‚ÄúHow could you possibly know that I am his mate? Neither of us has scented each other.‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause he scented you on me!‚Äù Her voice was hitting a higher octave, and my ears were starting to hurt.

‚ÄúCalm down. You‚Äôre hurting everyone‚Äôs ears and just explain yourself.‚Äù My mom sat next to me at the table, rubbing her head.

‚ÄúLast month, Brandon turned eighteen, and I was wearing Amy‚Äôs dress. He scented around me and said I smelt divine. But when I‚Äôm not wearing her clothes, he has zero interest in me.‚Äù Shannon pouted.

‚ÄúSo he likes the way I smell, doesn‚Äôt mean we are mates.‚Äù I pointed out. Completely and utterly denouncing Brandon as a mate. If I didn‚Äôt accept him, he would never be my mate anyway, and I would never accept him. That was the only thing I was sure of.

Brandon would be the last male I would ever touch this time around.

‚ÄúStop being obtuse Amy. We all know what it means when a wolf likes your smell.‚Äù Shannon started to cry and buried her head in her hands. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the male I want, daddy. The only one I would ever accept. But he wants her.‚Äù She pointed to me.¬†

I scoffed. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want your sloppy seconds, Shannon. Even if he was my mate, and I am not saying he is. It would be a cold day in hell before I accepted him as a mate. I would take the Lycan King over Brandon.‚Äù I threw my head back and laughed when she gasped.

The Lycan king was the bogeyman of all wolves.¬†

The last Lycan to exist and one who lives in the wild. It‚Äôs said the only wolves that ever see his face are the council that oversees the packs.¬†

But either way, I wasn‚Äôt lying. I would take the King as a mate before I would even look in Brandon‚Äôs vicinity.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lying. He‚Äôs the alpha.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd?‚Äù

‚ÄúEveryone wants to be the luna.‚Äù

‚ÄúIdiots want to be the luna.‚Äù I turned back and finished my food as Morgan calmed her down. My mom stood when she heard a horn.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs for you.‚Äù

I nodded as I stood and kissed my mother goodbye before I left.",1,1752489231.0,BlackNovel,1,1.0,False

Hazel Diaz

My palms grew sweaty as my gaze trailed down the list of signatures on the documents before me. Tears welled up in my eyes, blurring up the text I was still reading through. Unable to bear it anymore, I shut the document. My hands shook uncontrollably as I held my head between them and pressed hard to stop it from trembling so much. I needed to think, but suddenly, I didn't know how to.

My family's legacy, which I had spent my life building, had been ripped apart with no room for recovery.

Shit!

I was losing it.

My brain tried to understand what this meant. All nine board members had voted me out as CEO of Diaz Textile, and the time stamp showed the last signature was added today. This decision will take effect on Monday. Yet, I am only finding out now after receiving a strange email telling me to go through my report.

The nine board members would only vote out a CEO if they already had a replacement. I flipped open the page to look through, and there were nine signatures voting in Summer Biggs as the new CEO of Diaz Textile, effective Monday morning.

Summer Biggs, the biggest rival of Diaz Textile and my childhood bully.¬†

My heart sank in horror as my worst nightmare just became my reality.

‚ÄúYou are a worthless piece of shit that shouldn't even exist. I'm sure those around you feel the same.‚Äù Those were the words she said to me when we met last year at the business summit in Manchester.

Summer was taking over the company to which I had given my sweat, blood, and tears with the help of my board members. Not one‚Äînot even one voted against this takeover, and it showed just how much they wanted me out. This was a hostile takeover, and I didn't even have the chance to fight it. Summer had wanted to see me on my knees, and she had successfully brought me there.

I suddenly couldn't breathe‚Äîthe air was too hot for me, and my head hammered painfully against my skull.

Everything I've worked for‚Äîeverything my family has sacrificed themselves to build was crumbling away like stacks of cards before me. Tears pricked the sides of my eyes, begging to be let out as the weight of this new reality dawned on me.

I blinked.

Whoever sent me this email knew what was coming for me on Monday and wanted me to avoid it. They wanted to save me from the coming shame and embarrassment.

I picked up my phone and dialled Myron Rains, my fianc√©'s number, but he didn't pick up. I needed to tell someone, and he was the one person I trusted. After three tries and failing to reach his number, I gave up, grateful he didn't pick up because my parched throat would have hindered speech. I gathered my things from the table with trembling hands.

I wiped the tears streaming down my face away and got up on my feet, which felt both as heavy as lead and weak as water. I was at my breaking point, and I had little strength or readiness to face this terrible reality. Courage was necessary for times like this, and I was ashamed to admit I had none.

I glanced back at the office once more, knowing I would not return to it, and shut the door behind me as I stepped out. I had taken over the company after my father died four years ago, and now I had to look my mother in the eye and tell her I had lost the family company.

When I reached the parking lot, I wasn't surprised to find that my car was the only one left. It took me two hours and thirty minutes later than my usual closing hour because I had spent that time on the thirty-page document detailing the takeover.

I still had time, and I could build back everything as long as I had life.¬†

I opened my car and got in, and as I turned on the car and its headlights, I saw a bald man in a black hood pointing his gun at me. My breath cut in my throat, and my eyes widened in alarm, knowing what this meant.

""Get the fuck out of the car!"" he yelled at me, and my hands raised in fear and panic. The feeling of hopelessness and sadness I had had earlier turned into fear and confusion. This was one of the safest blocks in the town, and people rarely got robbed. No one came here to steal‚Äîunless he wasn't here to rob me, he was here to kill me, and the worst thing I could do was get out at his command.

""Don't try anything stupid, lady! I said get the fuck out."" He said and cocked the gun, ready to fire, and his eyes blazed with menace and intent to harm.

I shook my head. ""I'm getting down; I am getting down."" I said, but instead of opening the door like he had ordered me to, I locked my door and pressed down on the accelerator. The car immediately took off at full speed, hitting the bald man and throwing him onto the ground. As I held onto the steering wheel, my hands shook, my knuckles pale, and my heart pounded loudly. I heard the screeching of tyres, and through the mirror, I saw the hitman rise to his feet and fire shots at the back of the car multiple times, but the bullets narrowly missed me as I fled.

I felt my heart pumping with adrenaline as I quickly drove away from the parking area, tyres making a loud, screeching noise. My hands trembled, knowing I just survived death in the most unexpected way. I still couldn't believe what just happened. Someone wanted me dead, but who?

Summer.

I didn't doubt it. Taking my family's company wasn't enough; she wanted my life too.

I wanted to go home to Myron. He would care for me and know how to put my mind at ease. I needed to go home to him. It was the comfort I needed with everything that had happened so far. Tomorrow I will make the report of everything to the police, but tonight I just wanted him.

I pulled up at our penthouse and made my way inside. My heart was now beating steadily, but a headache slowly crawled in. The thought of collapsing into Myron's arms while he cradled me to sleep gave me something to hold on to and breathe for.¬†

I noticed the study door slightly ajar, and light came through and into the passage as I made my way towards the bedroom. Myron had never left the door open before; I thought to myself when I heard his voice say my name from within, but not how he usually did. I approached quickly, anxious as I stepped into the study, but I found no trace of him there, leaving me perplexed, and I shut the door.

The study's inner door, which led to our bedroom, was left open like the outer door. As I was about to reach the slightly open door, I stopped in my tracks upon hearing a familiar female giggle.

Taking a deep breath, I looked through the gap in the door, and my heart sank. I was utterly unprepared for what I saw. On our bed was Summer Biggs, the woman who had just taken everything from me in my fianc√©, Myron's arms.

# Chapter 2

I gasped and stepped back, shattered by the scene I just saw‚Äîa scene I didn't want to accept as real: Summer Biggs and Myron tangled in sheets and sharing an intimate moment. I couldn't accept it. The day was already bad enough with losing my company and almost losing my life. I didn't want to add Myron, the man I loved with all my heart, to it. It would be the end of me, for sure.

As if fate wanted to assure me what was happening was real, Summer chuckled at something Myron said, but I had been too gone to hear it. My eyes blurred up, fighting with every fibre of my being to keep myself from crumbling onto the ground in pain, sorrow, and despair.

Her voice, however, pulled me back to reality, and I heard Myron muttering things to her.

He reached out and stroked her face tenderly, his grey eyes beholding her with so much tenderness and adoration, one he never held all the years he looked at me. ""It's you. It has always been you. A few setbacks don't change that.""

She scoffed and slowly moved his hands away from her face, pulling herself up to sit in bed, so now her back faced me. ""That was four years of my life put on hold just so you can play perfect boyfriend to that bitch,"" she hissed in irritation, not hiding her dislike for me.

I wasn't surprised to hear that, though. Summer and I had always been rivals, and I considered her a witch. What surprised me was Myron, who, for the longest time, I thought I knew.

Myron also sat up in bed and placed his hand on her back. ""It was for a reason; you have to see that. Now I will get my father's backing, and you have taken everything from her like you have always wanted.""

She nodded and turned to him, ""It was so hard watching you with her when you belonged to me,"" she mumbled.

He pulled her closer, and her head lay against his chest. ""I know, love. It was hard for me too, but this was what we've always wanted, and now the hitman will finish the job, and you and I will live happily ever after,"" he said, kissing her temple.

My heart dropped into my stomach, and I stopped listening after he made mention of the hitman and his role in my attempted murder. My body trembled, and I stumbled back, lacking grace; I crashed into the study desk and threw the aquarium on it off. It crashed to the floor, making a loud noise in the process.

Startled that the noise might have given my presence away, I glanced through the door into the bedroom, and I found Summer and Myron's gaze on me. I swallowed when Myron's gaze narrowed on me, probably figuring out that I had not only escaped death but had also overheard their plan to have me killed.

Without waiting another second, I dashed out of the study, shutting the door behind me and running through the hallway and down the stairs. I reached outside the house I once called home and realised it had begun to rain heavily. I raced towards the car; only then did I hear heavy footsteps behind me.

My heart was leaping at this point, but I needed to get out, get away from here‚Äîas far away as possible. I opened the door, got in, and shut it when I heard a bang against the window. I jumped and glanced up at Myron, who had a sinister look I had never seen him with before while the now heavy rain beat on him. Evil intent and the desire to harm were present in his eyes, and this intent was directed towards me. I knew if not for the protection of the car, I would be dead.

I drew a sharp breath and, not willing to take the chance of him breaking through the window and grabbing my neck, I started the car and drove off.

I needed to get as far as possible from this place and get away to safety. I had lived here with Myron for over three years, and he was the only friend I had. My family was seven hours away, and they were not the best option. I needed to go to the police station and report everything that had happened to them, so I made a turn to the closest police station, which was about five miles from my current location.

I glanced at the red light ahead, and through the rearview mirror, I spotted Myron's black Grand Cherokee Trackhawk jeep following behind at full speed in the heavy rain. He wanted to finish what the hitman could not.

""God, no!"" I cried out in panic, knowing this might be the end. The road barely had any cars going and coming since it had few residences. I had never thought it was a bad thing; I always appreciated the privacy that came with our location until today. This would give Myron the grace to get away with anything.

This morning, I woke up thinking about what a wonderful man Myron was, and now I was running away from him to save myself.

Bang!

The slam yanked me out of my thought, and looking through my rearview mirror, I saw Myron trying to run me off the road. I sped off, but my Audi was nowhere near the speed of his car, and it tailed me down in seconds and rammed into the car once again, and this time, I lost control of the steering wheel.

I took control of my wheel but knew I would not get to the station at this point. I reached into my bag and quickly pulled out my phone, dialling 999 and pressing the speaker button; I tossed it onto the empty seat beside me.

""999 emergency line, what is your name, and how may we help you?"" a feminine voice came through the phone.

""I am being chased by my fianc√©."" I said as I rode onto the bridge.

""Ma'am, are you with me? If you are, I will need you to repeat what you said. I couldn't hear you."" the feminine voice replied.

I opened my mouth to tell them my fianc√© was about to kill me when bang! This time, the slam ran me off the road. Everything spiralled out of control, and my attempt to steer the car back in control only sent it tumbling off the road and off the bridge.

I felt a cold substance trickle down my face even as I hung upside down in my car, unable to open my eyes. I felt water rushing into the car, but I didn't know where it was coming from or how it was getting in.

""Hello, ma'am? Can you hear me? What just happened? Are you okay?"" I could hear the voice, but I couldn't bring myself to speak.

""Hello, ma'am?""

Everything hurt so much; it felt too dark here. and I was getting too cold.

I just wanted the pain to stop, and after a few seconds, it did.

# Chapter 3

The pain was the first thing I felt. It was unbearable, lasted longer, and made me feel like it was for an eternity. I wanted it to stop. I hissed, and my eyes flickered open to find I was surrounded by people with blue masks on and holding a light to my face.¬†

I had many questions, one of which was where I was and who they were, but I couldn't speak. My mouth felt too heavy to open, so all I could do was blink and watch them move around me.¬†

I winced when one of the masked people placed their hand against my skull. ""Stay with me,"" the deep masculine voice said. My lashes fluttered, choosing to do the opposite of the instruction, and my senses followed soon after.

...

It felt like a dream because I was walking in the air and I wasn't falling, but there was someone‚Äîa man standing far off, wearing a grey suit. This wasn't the afterlife because I felt pain in my head and sorrow in my heart. The afterlife had no pain or sorrow. I wanted to get to the stranger behind me and ask him where we were.

He turned around as I tried to reach out for him, and I froze. His piercing blue eyes stared into my soul, bringing peace and comfort to my weirdly troubled being.

It felt like sorcery.

I opened my mouth to speak, but their eyes told me he knew what I wanted to say. I tried to figure out why this man looked so familiar but couldn't remember. The more I tried to remember, the harder it became.

""It's time to wake up, Haze."" The familiar voice called to me, and my eyes snapped open, following the command.

I found myself in a white-painted room with a chandelier hanging in the centre where I lay. Like the dream, there was an ache in my head and sorrow in my heart.

I felt a sense of peace, but questions still lingered: Where was I, and how did I get here? I was unable to move or feel my leg; I was in a vegetative state, only able to move my neck.

While I still wondered where I was, the door cracked open, and my eyes travelled over, but the angle I lay at barely gave me a clear view. A man in a three-piece grey suit and trousers, with long black hair and a full beard, walked further into the room, shutting the door behind him.

Though his attention lingered on the phone in his hand, he walked with so much grace and dominance. He stood around six feet two inches, and his mesomorph physique made him look dreamy. When he looked up from his phone, I noticed his piercing blue eyes mirrored the ones I had seen in my dreams.

He was the man in my dreams.

A part of me felt I knew him, but I couldn't remember how.

His cold gaze found mine, sending chills through me. ""You are awake,"" he said and slipped his phone into his pocket. I couldn't tell if that was good news to him or bad news.

I opened my mouth to speak, but no words came out. My mouth felt heavy along with my head, almost as if something was keeping it shut.

""Don't struggle; you will only make your headache worse,"" he said, but I didn't listen and continued to struggle, which made my head hurt like he said it would.

I needed to speak, though, and my stubbornness wouldn't give up. I was trapped in the same room with a stranger I couldn't remember. ""Who are you, and where am I?"" I finally forced the words out of my mouth.

My lashes fluttered from the pain that followed the triumph of speech I had. I was weirdly comfortable with this strange man's presence, but this place didn't feel like home. I didn't know where home was or why I left there to come here.

Nothing made sense.

""You are at my house,"" he replied. He stepped further into the room, and my heart picked up an unsteady pace.

What was I doing in a stranger's house? What was happening, and why couldn't I remember?

If he noticed the panic mode I had gone into since he told me I was at his house and took a step closer, he did nothing to change it.

""Where is that?"" I asked, my gaze not leaving him despite the tingling sensation I got from staring at him.

""Argentina,"" he replied and stuffed his hand into the grey trousers.

My eyes widened. I couldn't be in Argentina. How did I get to Argentina? Argentina seemed so far from where I should be. Somehow, I knew this, but the more I tried to remember what led to me coming here, the harder it became.

""Who are you?"" I asked again, realising he hadn't answered my first question.

His eyes narrowed in response to my question as if expecting me to know who he was. ""Nikolai. You do not remember me.""

I stared blankly at him while scanning my brain to see if that name was familiar. It was familiar, yet I didn't know why.

""I am Myron's older brother,"" he added after watching me struggle for a while and not remembering the name.

At his words, the memory that had been void in my mind came rushing back like a strong tide. I didn't prepare for it, and it knocked my breath out and made my head hurt even more than anything else.

I remembered everything, from losing my company to almost getting shot at by the hitman. I remember going home to Myron, finding him with Summer, and then having to run for my life while being chased in the rain. My quest to get away didn't work because he succeeded in running me off the bridge and into what now seemed like a river. I thought I had died, but it turns out I didn't. I was now in Argentina, thousands of miles away from home.

He was Nikolai Rain. He was Myron Rain's older brother.

He was the older brother I've heard so much about.

That meant if Myron was evil, Nikolai was a monster.

# Chapter 4

Nikolai was Myron's cold-hearted billionaire brother, who had bested him at everything. According to Myron, Nikolai wanted only the worst for him and everyone he cared about. The coldness in his eyes was the exact one Myron had described for years.

The family sent Nikolai Rain far away from the United Kingdom after he tried to kill Myron when they were both younger, according to Myron. Bella Rain, Myron's younger sister, also confirmed the tales of their evil brother, who harboured nothing but menace for them.

I wasn't safe; I might have survived a monster, but I was in the den of another.

My heart tightened at this realisation, and I wanted to run off the bed, but I couldn't move. I couldn't bring myself to. I didn't give up, and after so long, I succeeded in moving my hands. My head ached, and my heart shrank away in dread of the worst fate yet to come. I struggled on the bed with my working hands, dragged myself up to sit in bed, and found I had a white robe on.¬†

""You are afraid,"" he pointed out, but his expression remained blank even as his gaze remained on me.

If Myron could do what he did to me, what would stop his cruel older brother from doing worse? I needed to get out of here and get away from him as quickly as possible. I couldn't move.

Damn, I couldn't move!

I was as useless as a potato. Despite all my chances, I couldn't escape Myron, and now I had even slimmer chances.

My lashes fluttered, and I muttered a prayer of rescue in my mind even though I had high doubt rescue would come for me at this point.

""What is your plan for me?"" I demanded, my fear showing itself in my face. He hesitated, and I lost it. ""Are you going to finish what your brother couldn't?!"" I snapped at him.

His gaze darkened, and for the first time since he walked into this room, a frown settled between his brows and did not leave, and it deepened with every second that went by until it became a full-on anger. ""You think I brought you here to kill you?"" he demanded with his brows narrowing down on me. ""I am not Myron,"" he said in a tone brittle with annoyance.

""No, you are his brother!"" I exclaimed. I did well not to add monster to the prefix.

""That fucking means nothing!"" He growled at me.

""What did you want me to say?"" I demanded, as my head pounded because I had raised my voice.

""Maybe thank you? Not treat me like I am the same monster who tried to have you killed."" He hissed at me, his annoyance growing, but somehow his tone remained the same.

My eyes welled up, and my lips quivered, grief over everything that happened so far taking over. ""I am sorry; I panicked. My fianc√©‚Äîyour brother tried to kill me. He tried to kill me twice.""

""I know, I saved you,"" he said, but his tone suggested he was reconsidering that decision.

How did he know? And why should he care? Myron said he had no heart or soul.

Myron also lied to you for years, took the company you loved away from you, and tried to kill you. He isn't the best person to take their word.

I bit down on my lower lip to regain control of my almost outpouring emotions.

Nikolai watched from where he stood without coming close or offering to help, and that was so much appreciated because he might have saved my life, but we weren't friends.

My entire body hurt, and my head was banging like a loud gong, but the physical pain was nothing compared to the emotional pain I felt thinking about everything that had happened to me. I lost everything and escaped with only my life. My childhood best friend and the same man I have slept next to for years wanted me gone, and I didn't realise this until it was too late. How could I have been so stupid?

""How did you know?"" I asked, wanting to hear it from his mouth.

He pulled his hand out of his pocket and folded it across his chest. ""He is my brother and hasn't been the cleverest of villains."" He shook his head, his tone slightly disappointed.

That made Nikolai the clever villain, then?

""I saw him with Summer last Christmas. They tried to keep things quiet, but I could tell something was going on between them, and I was right. I learnt their plan without trying hard."" He replied as though it wasn't a big deal.

Myron didn't let me come along last Christmas. He insisted I spend the day with my family despite his father's birthday party being on the same day. He told me he didn't want his evil brother putting me on his blacklist since Nikolai was also spending Christmas with them. I listened to him and spent Christmas with my family instead, and he took Summer with him.¬†

He kissed me while lying through his teeth.

If Nikolai figured something was going on between Myron and Summer, that meant Bella Rain also did. She was an intelligent woman and would have figured it out in seconds. She knew her brother was unfaithful, yet she smiled every time we met for coffee.

I was the fool all along.

My heart ached, but more than that, anger surged through me. They had all treated me like a fool, and I wanted the worst for them all.

My tears fell, and I tried to wipe them off but realised there was a mask over my face. My hand moved over the rest of my face, and then head, in panic, and I realised it was wrapped in a bandage. I turned to Nikolai with eyes filled with panic.

He didn't let me suffer with my confusion or make me ask why my face was wrapped up because he spoke up a few seconds later.

""The shattered windscreen on impact damaged your face beyond repair. It had to be wrapped up. We needed you to wake up and decide what you want to do.""

By the time he finished speaking, I was bawling uncontrollably.

Myron took everything away from me; he didn't kill me, but he made sure I would never get back to the life I once had.

Nikolai stepped closer, and unlike before, I didn't flinch. I didn't think anything could be worse than what had already happened, and a part of me felt safe with him despite everything I'd been through.

He dipped his hand into his pocket and pulled out a white handkerchief. He gave me a pitiful look and handed it to me.

I took it, and after wiping off the tear stains, I blew my nose noisily even as my head ached terribly. ""What are my options?"" I didn't think I had any, but a

sking was best.

""There is only one; you will need a complete face change.""

# Chapter 5

Nikolai's POV

I watched as Hazel's face dropped, hearing the words from my mouth, and my heart grew heavy in my chest. I knew that look; it was one of helplessness and hopelessness. I wanted to reach out and assure her that she would get through it, but I didn't know how she would respond.

She whimpered pathetically and tried to hide from my gaze as though I would judge her. If only she knew I would never judge her for this.

The silence went by for a few seconds, and she revealed her dilemma: ""I cannot afford a face change."" Her eyes still held the same innocence as when I last stared into them. She might need a face change and a lot of things, but she will always be Haze, the saviour to me.

I shook my head. ""You do not have to worry about any of that. I will cover it."" I assured her.

She searched my gaze as if trying to see something different from what I said. She must not have found it because she asked, ""Why would you do that for me?""

I smiled. ""Because I know what being helpless feels like and also because I want to.""

That was all I could say, even though I wanted to say much more. I was still Myron's brother, and thanks to him, a part of her saw me as a monster. She feared me as such, and it was something I never thought I would find so painful.

I wasn't a monster; I was the man who loved and lost her. I was the man who had to remain on the sidelines and watch my brother do a poor job of loving her. I was the man who knew the girl of my dreams deserved more than she was getting but couldn't do anything about it because, once again, fate had screwed him over.

She was always the girl of my dreams, but I wasn't the man of hers; Myron was.

I vowed that though she was his, I would protect her, but I failed. I didn't protect her from the monster called Myron. I remember coming in to see her immediately after she was rescued and brought to the hospital. My heart broke at her sight in a coma; her face had been badly damaged, and the bandage was the only way to stop bleeding and infection.

I failed her. I couldn't live up to my promise to keep her safe. I failed.

I stepped back and undid my suit button, freeing its grip on me because suddenly I couldn't breathe. I needed to step out, and even though I didn't want to leave her again, I knew this was necessary.

Stepping into my room, I removed my clothes and entered the bathroom. I needed a cold shower to help diffuse the anger coursing through my veins, as there was no proper way to disperse it.

The cold water descended on my skin, and it tightened in response, but I stood under it and regulated my breathing, slowly in and out, until I was back in control. There was still a long way to go in actualising my plan, and letting anger in would destroy everything that had taken years to plan out.

My phone buzzed when I stepped back into the bedroom, and I answered it.

""Margeret. Do you have any good news?"" I asked straight to the point and waited for her to speak.

""Oof, do you kiss your mother with that mouth, sir?"" she asked.

I rolled my eyes. ""It's a good thing she is not here to know. Do you have good news?"" I asked again, my impatience rising.

""The police just found the car, and it is exactly how you wanted it; they will move it to a missing person report now."" She replied.

""Alright, Margeret, keep me updated.""

""Sure thing, boss."" She replied, ""Also, check your system for updates; it's officially seven months before the date. I have forwarded all the information you need to be informed and ahead of the latest happenings of the Rain's company's next step.""

""Thank you,"" I said and ended the call.

I went to work, feeding myself all the details about the upcoming event in Rain. Seven months was a long time, but compared to thirteen years, it wasn't such a long time; I could wait.

After hours of patching all my plans, I rose from the study table and walked to the left corner of the room where more than two dozen pictures hung, and I stared at the faces of each of them, most of them being the three people that destroyed my life.

Kenneth Rain, my father.

He destroyed my family and betrayed my mother and the vows he made to her to be faithful and true to only her. He opened the door to her heartache and left her when she needed him the most. His betrayal brought my mother's death, and I will never forgive him.

Cynthia Rain, his wife.

The snake that pretended to be a friend of my mother when all the while she was an enemy. She's the very one who had me sent away from home at the age of seventeen to live in a strange world and amongst strange people to make her son happy. She would wish she had killed me along with my mother all those years ago.

Myron Rain, their son.

The bastard has a special place in my heart. Not only did he take away the girl I wanted, but he also broke her beyond recognition. For every tear she shed, for every moment she felt helpless and hopeless, he would pay double-fold. Hazel was perfect without a doubt, but just like Myron's father did to my mother, he betrayed Hazel and left her for dead.

I had so many scores to settle with them, and they will play a part in their undoing. One destroyed my family; the other took me away from the girl of my dreams, and the last tried to have her killed.

I tried to sleep, but I couldn't; all I did was toss and turn in bed. I glanced at the clock on the nightstand and saw it was 11:53 p.m. I needed sleep, but I knew I wouldn't get any; there was something on my mind.

I wanted to see Hazel; I needed to. I've gone to see her every day since she was in a coma, and I hadn't today because she had awoken, but my body had gotten used to the routine and wouldn't rest until I did it.

I opened the door to her room and found her soundly asleep in bed. I stood at the door, not daring to go further for fear of waking her. There was so much left to do, but she was awake; she was safe.

""I am sorry I failed you, Haze, but I swear on my mother's grave that I will never let another harm come your way. I will protect you from everything that will cause you pain."" I vowed.

If anyone wants it, comment below, and I'll find the link for you within 10 minutes.""","‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt do this.‚Äù I begged over and over, but no one was listening. I thrashed against their hold, but nothing. ‚ÄúI am your luna.‚Äù I screamed at the top of my lungs, but then his laugh from the other room broke all the fight in me. ‚ÄúLuke please.‚Äù I begged once more time, my voice horse.



‚ÄúKill it once it‚Äôs done. Toss her out. She will have to survive on her own from here on out.‚Äù



He can‚Äôt mean that. This was our baby. ‚ÄúOur baby.‚Äù



‚ÄúIs a mistake from the Moon Goddess. One I will rectify.‚Äù His voice called again from the other room. He wouldn‚Äôt even face me. ‚ÄúNow do it. That‚Äôs an order.‚Äù



‚ÄúYes, Alpha.‚Äù



It was a mistake to come here.



It was a mistake to give him everything.



‚ÄúOh, and doctor?‚Äù Her sweet voice called from the other room. My stepsister, Shannon. I gritted my teeth. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt use any anesthetic. She should feel everything.‚Äù



‚ÄúYes, Luna.‚Äù The doctor turned back to me with sad eyes, but when he picked up the scalpel, I knew I was screwed.



I‚Äôm sorry, baby. Momma couldn‚Äôt save you. She wanted you so, so much. I tried to rub my stomach, but the nurses had strapped me down. When the doctor approached, I realized he was using a silver blade.



‚ÄúSilver?‚Äù My whisper was almost silent, but he nodded. I knew then that Shannon didn‚Äôt want me to survive. She wanted my life so badly that she lied about me cheating on my mate, showing photos as proof. But I never touched another wolf, nor would I again, not after this betrayal.



Why, Moon Goddess, why would you give him to me just to take him away? My pup.



I cried silently as the doctor cut into my abdomen, and I felt my baby thrash inside. He knew it was too early to be born. This was a death sentence for both of us.



‚ÄúBring me the body of the pup.‚Äù



‚ÄúYes Alpha.‚Äù I felt every slice as he cut into me, and finally I could take it no longer. I started to scream, soon I felt the blood trickling down my side, every drip off of me hitting the floor. I thrashed against the restraints. But the silver had made me weak.



I‚Äôm sorry, baby.



They weren‚Äôt trying to keep me alive, which I expected, but I wished wasn‚Äôt true. I used to love my mate, but I felt the love die in me when I saw my pup being ripped from my belly.



‚ÄúPlease, let me hold him once.‚Äù I tried to move my arms to reach for him, but I was still tied down. The doctor, who was shedding tears, brought my pup and laid him on my chest.



He was perfect. I rubbed his scent on my face and mine on his. He would forever be a part of my soul.



My missing piece.



‚ÄúDoctor, now.‚Äù



‚ÄúYes Alpha.‚Äù The doctor picked the baby up and rushed out, leaving me spread open to the elements.



I felt my life slipping away as the door opened and Shannon came in. Her smug smile was firmly in place.



‚ÄúI told you I would take your life, Amy. I would have your mate. And I have, over and over, since he found out of your betrayal.‚Äù Shannon walked over and laid a kiss on my face as I snarled. ‚ÄúHe is perfection. And don‚Äôt worry. I will give him another son.‚Äù She laid her hand on her stomach and I started to laugh. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs so funny?‚Äù



‚ÄúI can smell the beta on you. That‚Äôs Derek's child, and it‚Äôs a girl. Nice try though.‚Äù



She snarled and raised her hand, growing her claws to deliver the final blow, but the door was ripped open and my mate, the man I now hated most in the world, stepped inside. His eyes were red, and I started to laugh again.



‚ÄúYou bitch!‚Äù He snarled and struck out, whipping Shannon to the other side of the room.



‚ÄúBrandon!‚Äù Shannon shrieked as she hit the wall. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù She staggered to her feet, but more blood dripped out of me and I closed my eyes.



‚ÄúYou lied!‚Äù He screamed, shaking the walls as his aura struck out, but I could barely feel it. I felt the silver travelling in my veins getting closer to my sluggish heart. ‚ÄúThis was my pup. I can smell me on him. He was mine.‚Äù Brandon's eyes grew redder as the tears gathered. ‚ÄúYou said she cheated on me and that it wasn‚Äôt my pup.‚Äù



‚ÄúShe did cheat on you. I guess I was wrong about the pup.‚Äù



‚ÄúYou said you smelt it.‚Äù From the sound of it, he lunged for her again, but him clutching our baby in his arm was the last thing I saw. And I wanted to never see it again. He did this to us. Not Shannon.



She played her part well, sure, but him not believing me, not waiting for a few more days to smell the pup, that was his fault. And all of our downfalls.



I prayed for the moon goddess to take me. I no longer wanted to be here. I wanted to be with my pup.



‚ÄúSave her.‚Äù



‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Shannon screamed. ‚ÄúI am the Luna now, you marked me last night.‚Äù Ah, so that was the pain I felt last night. His betrayal had bile shoot into my mouth. ‚ÄúI am bearing your pup.‚Äù



I started to laugh again. I cracked my eyes to see my mate, Brandon, hovering next to me. ‚ÄúStay with me Amy.‚Äù



‚ÄúBeta‚Äôs baby. She is fucking‚Ä¶the beta.‚Äù I choked out the words and laughed as horror bloomed in his eyes. Blood flew from my mouth as I smiled again.



‚ÄúSave her.‚Äù



‚ÄúNo!‚Äù I slammed out, putting all of my power in it. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt move.‚Äù I used my Alpha strength to freeze everyone, including my mate.



‚ÄúHow?‚Äù Brandon looked down at me, pleading. ‚ÄúLet me save you.‚Äù



‚ÄúI am descended from the Moon Goddess, and you don‚Äôt deserve to save me. You don‚Äôt deserve our pup. You were weak. And now you lost everything.‚Äù I smiled up at him as I felt my life from my body.



And then I was free.

  
I opened my eyes to find myself surprisingly alive. ‚ÄúAmy hurry, you‚Äôre going to be late.‚Äù I jolted up and look around, confused. What was going on? Where was I? ‚ÄúAmy!‚Äù The voice called again and I shook myself. I stood up from the bed and looked around again. I recognized this room. It was my childhood bedroom.¬†



I hadn‚Äôt stepped foot in this room since I found my mate, Brandon. I heard a knock on the door and my mother opened it. Before I could process what was happening, I ran into my mother‚Äôs arms. ‚ÄúMom, you‚Äôre here.‚Äù I started to cry. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve missed you so much.‚Äù



‚ÄúAmy. My girl.‚Äù She laughed as she patted my back. ‚ÄúI saw you yesterday.‚Äù She pulled back and I looked into her amber eyes that matched my own. ‚ÄúHappy birthday, baby.‚Äù



I leaned into her hands and realized that today was the last day I spent at home. I found my mate on my eighteenth birthday. ‚ÄúThank you, mom.‚Äù



‚ÄúHopefully, you will meet your mate today and start your new life.‚Äù She smiled at me and I felt my blood freeze. I didn‚Äôt want to meet Brandon. Not when I knew what was going to happen.



‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather stay here with you.‚Äù I smiled as I kissed her cheek. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to miss you and Morgan.



And I knew that when Brandon thought I cheated on him, before he killed my baby and me. He killed my mother for her involvement. Shannon‚Äôs father, my mother‚Äôs husband, watched her die. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I knew he loved my mother, and he was hurting, but his scheming daughter was the cause of all of this. He stood by and watched it all happen.¬†



I understood why he supported his daughter, but I didn‚Äôt like it, nor him, for that matter.



‚ÄúBaby. You won‚Äôt miss us. We will be there every step of the way.‚Äù She kissed my cheek, and I wrapped my fingers around hers.¬†



‚ÄúMom, can we just leave? You and me? Leave Shannon and Morgan and move back to daddy‚Äôs pack?‚Äù My father, the Alpha of the Silvermoon pack, wasn‚Äôt a good husband, but he was a good man. He cheated on my mother, betraying her when he was drunk. But he swore it was a mistake. It was another Alpha‚Äôs maneuverings to break them up, but my mother said it didn‚Äôt matter. It was too late.¬†



His betrayal cost the life of my brother growing inside of her, and she refused to move past it.



‚ÄúNo baby. I can‚Äôt go back.‚Äù My mother‚Äôs face fell as she turned away.



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be betrayed, mom. Not like you and not any worse. I don‚Äôt want a mate.‚Äù I whispered my new truth.



‚ÄúMates don‚Äôt hurt each other, baby.‚Äù She tried to smile but I shook. I knew exactly what mates do to each other.



‚ÄúWould you be made if I refused my mate?‚Äù



‚ÄúGod no baby. The Moon Goddess makes a path clear, but it is up to us to choose it. If you don‚Äôt want your mate, you can reject him.‚Äù



‚ÄúAnd if it is the Alpha‚Äôs son?‚Äù



My mother looked at me. She knew that if it was the Alpha‚Äôs son, I would be screwed. They wouldn‚Äôt allow me to leave. An Alpha has to mate his first mate, even for a day to come into his full power. ‚ÄúWhat do you know?‚Äù I watched as her eyes searched mine.



I pulled her back into my room and away from the door. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know for sure, but I am terrified that if I am mated to Shannon‚Äôs boyfriend, I will die after we are mated. Mom, the chances that he will match with an Alpha far outweigh the chance that he is mated to the daughter of the beta.‚Äù I pulled back. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want this for me.‚Äù



She weighed my words, and I watched as she came to the same conclusion. ‚ÄúOkay baby. But you can‚Äôt leave. It would be too conspicuous. You will have to mask your scent whenever he is around.‚Äù



I tossed my hands in the air. ‚ÄúHow would I do that?‚Äù



‚ÄúThere is much you don‚Äôt know that I would leave in the past but if you are sure‚Ä¶‚Äù She trailed off and I just nodded my head. ‚ÄúThen let me make a few calls. You don‚Äôt have to go to school today.‚Äù



I lept back into her arms. ‚ÄúThank you, mom. I don‚Äôt know what I would do without you.‚Äù



‚ÄúI love you, baby. You will never be without me. That I can promise you.‚Äù She kissed my cheek and then left me alone in my room.¬†



I ran to my phone and checked the date to make sure. It was twenty eighteen; I went back six years. Six years to the day that I met Brandon. I could relive everything, make better choices. I could live, and maybe this time around, so would my pup.



I rubbed my flat stomach. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, my pup. This time around, no one will hurt you.‚Äù



I went into my ensuite and jumped into the shower. No way was I going to face today, looking like I just crawled out of bed. I stood in side my closet in a towel trying to figure out what to wear when I heard my bedroom door open.¬†



I was about to turn and call out to my mother, but I heard a soft step, which my mother wouldn‚Äôt do. So I hid behind my winter coats and I waited.¬†



‚ÄúI‚Äôm telling you, if she is Brandon‚Äôs mate, I‚Äôm going to kill her.‚Äù



‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt mean that, Shan.‚Äù The nasily voice of Megan, Shannon‚Äôs best friend, came from the cell phone pressed to her ear.



‚ÄúOf course I do. Brandon is mine.‚Äù



‚ÄúOnly because you put out. He was hoping Shannon would notice him.‚Äù



‚ÄúYou shut your fucking mouth, Megan.‚Äù Shannon snarled and her eyes flashed. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs mine.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhatever I gotta go. Hurry the fuck up before I leave your ass,‚Äù Megan called, and then the line went dead. A honk sounded from outside and Shannon was snatching something before I grabbed her hand.¬†



‚ÄúWhat do you think you‚Äôre doing in my closet?‚Äù



‚ÄúAmy?‚Äù Shannon‚Äôs mouth dropped out. I squeezed her hand until I heard a crack. Her scream was muffled by my hand.



‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky I only broke one finger. You just threatened to kill me. Didn‚Äôt I hear that correctly? A beta‚Äôs daughter threatening an alpha.‚Äù I tsked.



‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do shit.‚Äù She snarled back at me as her hand reformed.¬†



‚ÄúLie again and I will break all of your fingers and hold them while the bones heal.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt stop my grin as I felt her tremble. ‚ÄúDid you threaten me?‚Äù



‚ÄúYes.‚Äù she screamed at me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to take Brandon from me.‚Äù



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want your pathetic alpha now or ever. Keep him.‚Äù I pushed her away. ‚ÄúNow get out of my room before I change my mind about maiming you.‚Äù I turned back to my clothes and picked out low-rise jeans and a tank top.



‚ÄúWhat the fuck is your problem?‚Äù



‚ÄúYou. Now leave.‚Äù I let my wolf come forward and my eyes flashed. I pushed my alpha command into my words and forcing her out of my room. Stupid bitch. How dare she come into my room to take something of mine? My wolf growled lowly. This was our den. I shook myself and refocused. Closing the doors, I hopped back into bed, pulling out my phone. I tried to remember everything that happened in the last six years that could help me with my plan. Because make no mistake, Brandon and Shannon would pay.

  
‚ÄúPack your bags, Amy.‚Äù My mom came in, surprising me from the list I was making.¬†



‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I looked up. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù



‚ÄúYou are going to spend the summer with your father. I already got the approval from the Alpha.‚Äù Mom smiled down at me. ‚ÄúCome on, baby. Pack your bag and get ready.‚Äù



I jumped to my feet and ran to my mom. ‚ÄúI can go?‚Äù



‚ÄúJust for the summer, baby, then you will be back here with me. I had to promise that you would be returning here.‚Äù



I pouted. ‚ÄúMom, I really don‚Äôt want to be here.‚Äù I wanted to make them pay, but I wouldn‚Äôt risk him finding me.



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay baby, you will understand once you see your dad.‚Äù She patted my hair and kissed my cheek. ‚ÄúNow get ready.‚Äù



‚ÄúOkay mom.‚Äù I kissed her back then she left me alone. I grabbed my phone to lock it and then turned back to my closet. I packed my bag and then headed into my bathroom when I heard the downstairs door slam open.¬†



‚ÄúI fucking knew it.‚Äù I heard Shannon scream down stairs. I ignored her as I grabbed everything from my bathroom and then I grabbed my laptop and chargers. I stuffed everything in to my backpack and headed downstairs.



‚ÄúShannon, why are you screaming?‚Äù Morgan was at the table with his coffee, and my mom was running around when I pushed my suitcase into the room.¬†



‚ÄúI‚Äôm not Brandon‚Äôs mate, daddy.‚Äù Shannon flew into the room and dove into his arms.¬†



‚ÄúHow are you so sure?‚Äù Morgan wrapped his arms around her, but I just snickered. She snapped her eyes to me and she flew at me.



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs you. You stupid whore.‚Äù Shannon tried to claw out my eyes. But I just sent her flying with a backhand.



‚ÄúAmy!‚Äù Morgan got to his feet but my mom tsked.¬†



‚ÄúMorgan, you can‚Äôt yell ay Amy for protecting herself. Shan attacked her first.‚Äù My mom placed my breakfast on the table. ‚ÄúAmy, come eat. You have a long day ahead.‚Äù



‚ÄúBabe? Why does Amy have a suitcase?‚Äù



‚ÄúShe is going away for the summer. To her fathers.‚Äù My mother turned to me and opened her arms. ‚ÄúCome baby. Come eat. The car is coming and you need to be ready to go.‚Äù



I walked over and sat down, and dug in.¬†



‚ÄúWhy is she going to her dads?‚Äù Morgan walked over to pick Shannon up.¬†



‚ÄúShe wanted to spend the summer with her dads before college and who am I to say no?‚Äù My mom smiled down at me and I smiled back at her. I didn‚Äôt know what was going to happen this summer to protect me from Brandon finding out I was his mate, but I needed it. Whatever it was, I needed it.¬†



‚ÄúYeah, my dad called me this morning and since I haven‚Äôt seen him since Christmas break and when he offered to fly me out, I asked my mom.‚Äù I smiled sweetly over at Morgan, and Shannon smiled.¬†



‚ÄúYou‚Äôre leaving?‚Äù Shannon stood up.



‚ÄúYup. I‚Äôll be gone the full summer.‚Äù I smirked over at her. ‚ÄúBut my room is locked, and it will stay that way.‚Äù My smile dropped away as I stared at her and used my alpha command.¬†



‚ÄúAmy!‚Äù Morgan yelled out. ‚ÄúYou know you‚Äôre not allowed to alpha command your step sister!‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúAnd I wouldn‚Äôt have Morgan, if I hdn‚Äôt found her in my room this morning, trying to take things out of my closet.‚Äù I turned and raised my eyebrow, daring her to try to lie.¬†



‚ÄúIs that true?‚Äù Morgan looked down at Shannon and I just stared at her. I watch her open her mouth to deny it.



‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt lie. I‚Äôll just command you to tell the truth.‚Äù She screeched and stomped her foot.



‚ÄúYes!‚Äù she screamed. ‚ÄúAre you happy? Yes, I went into her closet to steal some clothes because I know she is Brandon‚Äôs mate.‚Äù



‚ÄúHow?‚Äù I threw up my hands, playing like I didn‚Äôt know the truth. ‚ÄúHow could you possibly know that I am his mate? Neither of us has scented each other.‚Äù



‚ÄúBecause he scented you on me!‚Äù Her voice was hitting a higher octave, and my ears were starting to hurt.



‚ÄúCalm down. You‚Äôre hurting everyone‚Äôs ears and just explain yourself.‚Äù My mom sat next to me at the table, rubbing her head.



‚ÄúLast month, Brandon turned eighteen, and I was wearing Amy‚Äôs dress. He scented around me and said I smelt divine. But when I‚Äôm not wearing her clothes, he has zero interest in me.‚Äù Shannon pouted.



‚ÄúSo he likes the way I smell, doesn‚Äôt mean we are mates.‚Äù I pointed out. Completely and utterly denouncing Brandon as a mate. If I didn‚Äôt accept him, he would never be my mate anyway, and I would never accept him. That was the only thing I was sure of.



Brandon would be the last male I would ever touch this time around.



‚ÄúStop being obtuse Amy. We all know what it means when a wolf likes your smell.‚Äù Shannon started to cry and buried her head in her hands. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the male I want, daddy. The only one I would ever accept. But he wants her.‚Äù She pointed to me.¬†



I scoffed. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want your sloppy seconds, Shannon. Even if he was my mate, and I am not saying he is. It would be a cold day in hell before I accepted him as a mate. I would take the Lycan King over Brandon.‚Äù I threw my head back and laughed when she gasped.



The Lycan king was the bogeyman of all wolves.¬†



The last Lycan to exist and one who lives in the wild. It‚Äôs said the only wolves that ever see his face are the council that oversees the packs.¬†



But either way, I wasn‚Äôt lying. I would take the King as a mate before I would even look in Brandon‚Äôs vicinity.



‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lying. He‚Äôs the alpha.‚Äù



‚ÄúAnd?‚Äù



‚ÄúEveryone wants to be the luna.‚Äù



‚ÄúIdiots want to be the luna.‚Äù I turned back and finished my food as Morgan calmed her down. My mom stood when she heard a horn.



‚ÄúThat‚Äôs for you.‚Äù



I nodded as I stood and kissed my mother goodbye before I left.

1lziu9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXIndia/comments/1lziu9a/how_do_i_make_myself_eat_food/,How do I make myself eat food ??,"I‚Äôm 20F, 5'5"", and around 51kg. I‚Äôve always been a bit of a picky eater, but I used to manage fine. Over the past year though, my appetite has gotten really unpredictable. Some days I can go all day on just coffee, and other days I‚Äôm starving.
I'm currently on summer vacation and will soon begin my fifth semester.  It's a critical time for engineering undergrads because of the internship and placement season, and I'm also dealing with some personal life issues too.  It was fine when I was in college, but I've noticed that anytime I'm in a stressful position like this, my appetite suffers first. It‚Äôs like I know I‚Äôm hungry, my stomach growls, but the moment I try to eat, I physically can‚Äôt get the food down my throat. I feel like I‚Äôll vomit if I try to force it.

I told my parents about this back in February when it happened last time. They gave me some deworming tablets and syrup, and it helped for a few weeks. But here I am again.

I often hear people joke about surviving the day on coffee or just fruits, but in my case, it's actually harming my health. I get extreme headaches, I feel tired and dizzy when I go out, and I‚Äôve noticed that I‚Äôm getting thinner and weaker. It‚Äôs ruining my energy and productivity.

I‚Äôm scared to bring it up with my parents again because they always tell me to ‚Äújust eat properly.‚Äù But I don‚Äôt know how to explain that I want to eat, I really do, but when I try, it just won‚Äôt go down and I feel nauseous.

Even right now, while I‚Äôm writing this, my stomach is growling. But I know that if I try to eat something, it‚Äôll just sit in my mouth or get stuck in my throat, and I‚Äôll feel like throwing up.

If anyone has experienced something similar, losing appetite under stress, struggling to eat even when hungry, please let me know how you managed it. What helped you start eating again? How do you build a routine when food feels so hard to take in?

Any advice would mean a lot. Thank you!",11,1752488880.0,TwoXIndia,8,0.82,False

Lucy Barrett was reviewing a divorce case when she got the text: ‚ÄúNathan Douglas checked into a hotel with another woman.‚Äù

Her client that morning had been a woman too‚Äîfurious, betrayed, and armed with a stack of photos showing her husband in bed with someone else. She wanted a divorce and wanted to leave him with nothing.

""Ms. Aubrey, infidelity isn‚Äôt recognized as legal grounds for divorce,"" Lucy said calmly. ""Unless other faults are involved, if your husband refuses, you‚Äôll most likely lose the case.""

She wrapped up the meeting in five minutes and drove straight to the hotel.

Nathan answered the door.

A loosely tied white towel hung low on his hips, revealing part of his sharply defined V-line. Droplets of water clung to his dark hair, sliding down his jawline before landing coolly on the back of Lucy‚Äôs hand.

His expression was distant. Almost indifferent.

Lucy pulled out a stack of envelopes from her purse. ""These are pictures of you and that woman entering the hotel. You‚Äôve got two options. Send her away, or I show these to your grandfather.""

Nathan‚Äôs expression didn‚Äôt flinch. He looked at her like she was a stranger.

He motioned to the woman inside the room. ""Leave.""

The woman, instead of being upset, smiled as she walked out. ""See you around.""

Her red camisole slipped off her shoulder, revealing faint kiss marks. She looked back with a flirtatious grin‚Äîflawless face, confident walk, absolutely magnetic.

A total contrast to Lucy, with her crisp white blouse and tailored black skirt‚Äîsharp, formal, and completely put-together.

The woman gave Lucy a quick once-over, her smile fading just a touch. Gorgeous‚Ä¶ but ice-cold. Still, something about her struck deep. That poised, distant face, paired with those clear, luminous eyes‚Äîabsolutely stunning. Impossible to ignore.

Once the woman disappeared down the hall, Lucy handed Nathan the photos. ""You sure change it up fast. Weren‚Äôt you all about the sweet, innocent type just last month?""

Nathan‚Äôs brow twitched ever so slightly. It was impossible to read his thoughts. After a moment, he replied coolly, ""So, what do you want this time?""

Lucy lowered her eyes and thought for a second. ""I want another storefront. Downtown.""

""Fine,"" he said without hesitation. Then he crooked a finger at her.

She knew what that meant and stayed rooted where she stood.

Nathan gave her a lazy once-over. ""Don‚Äôt tell me you think a couple of photos are worth millions.""

Property in the city center was worth a fortune. He knew Lucy never aimed low. A few hundred grand? She wouldn‚Äôt even blink.

Lucy said evenly, ""I‚Äôve got backups of the photos.""

His cold eyes flickered for a brief moment. ""You‚Äôre blackmailing me?""

She didn‚Äôt say a word‚Äîjust held his gaze, steady and unblinking, eyes locked onto his.

The next second, Nathan dragged her inside and slammed her against the cold wall. One hand gripped her waist, tight and possessive.

She looked up at him, unfazed.

Nathan had a way of keeping people at arm‚Äôs length. Even in the middle of this, he still felt distant and detached.

But he knew exactly what he was doing. His hands were skilled, his rhythm calculated and precise.

*No wonder he was the golden boy of Norevia Central‚Äôs surgical team‚Äîhe definitely lived up to the hype.*

Lucy enjoyed every second of it. No lies‚Äîshe was completely satisfied. At the end, Nathan caught the faint redness in her eyes.

She sat on the edge of the bed, her white blouse slightly undone, her black skirt still crumpled on the floor. Her smooth legs were crossed, faint red marks from his grip still visible on her skin‚Äîthere was something raw and quietly beautiful about it.

Nathan‚Äôs desire, which had just cooled off, flared back up. ""Are you hurting?"" he asked.

Lucy shook her head. ""I'm fine.""

As she spoke, he buttoned up his shirt and adjusted his slacks. His tone remained indifferent. ""You didn‚Äôt do so well today.""

Barefoot, Lucy stepped across the carpet. As she bent to pick up her skirt, she paused and looked at him, waiting.

He tugged at his tie. ""You were way more into it when you first got into my bed to marry into the Douglas family. You were better back then too.""

He said it like it couldn‚Äôt have mattered less.

That quiet, icy scorn in his eyes made him seem even more distant.

Lucy zipped up her fitted blouse and black skirt, the outfit wrapping her in a cool, almost untouchable composure‚Äîas if the woman lost in desire just moments ago had been someone else entirely.

She said lightly, ""Exactly. I wanted to be in the Douglas family, so of course I put in the effort. Who keeps studying after passing the test?""

*Into the Douglas family.*¬†*Not*¬†*to marry you.*

Nathan‚Äôs hand paused on his tie. He turned, looked at her with disgust and detachment, and said, ""Don‚Äôt keep pulling crap like this. Don‚Äôt start thinking you‚Äôre Mrs. Douglas for real.""

""We‚Äôll see,"" she said softly.

She fastened the top button of her blouse and murmured without a hint of obedience.

The door slammed shut behind him.

On the drive back to the office, it hit her‚Äîshe was right in the middle of her cycle. She turned the car around and headed to Central Hospital.

After picking up the emergency contraceptive, she went to the break room to get some water. While filling her cup, she overheard two women gossiping.

""I saw this gorgeous girl get into Dr. Douglas‚Äôs car yesterday!""

""What‚Äôs the big deal? With that family background and body? Women lining up to sleep with him isn‚Äôt surprising. It‚Äôd be weird if they weren‚Äôt.""

""This one was different,"" the second nurse whispered. ""She was a patient. Appendectomy. Dr. Douglas did the surgery himself. Did all her post-op care. Drove her home, like, personally.""

Standing by the water dispenser, Lucy stayed quiet.

Until the burning started.

She looked down. The cup had overflowed, and scalding water was running over her fingers, already forming a blister.

The two nurses from earlier came out from the back. They saw her, fell silent, and hurried off.

Lucy filled her cup and sat on a bench in the hallway. Her mind drifted back to the woman from the hotel.

Those kiss marks were faint. That exit? Way too smooth. The whole scene had felt staged‚Äîscripted.

*It looks like Nathan did it on purpose.*

After sitting for a while, Lucy took the elevator up to the third floor‚Äîsurgery.

At the nurses‚Äô station were the same two girls from earlier.

""Dr. Douglas is in surgery. He probably won‚Äôt be out for another hour. If it‚Äôs urgent, you could see someone else.""

Lucy said coolly, ""I‚Äôll wait for him.""

Her tone was casual, almost familiar. The nurses couldn‚Äôt help but give her a second look.

She had an aloof beauty about her, distant eyes that still held a strange kind of warmth, enough to make it hard to look away.

She didn‚Äôt look like a patient. More like someone who came looking for Nathan.

One of the nurses blinked and noticed the faint red marks under Lucy‚Äôs collar. She opened her mouth without thinking. ""You and Dr. Douglas‚Äî""

**Chapter 2 Get Out**

Lucy gave her a sidelong glance‚Äîcool, steady, and sharp enough to shut her up without a single word. The young nurse‚Äôs words caught in her throat.

Nathan‚Äôs surgery had run long. There‚Äôd been heavy bleeding midway through, and it didn‚Äôt wrap until sunset.

Lucy stood quietly in the hallway, leaning against the wall, watching as he stepped out of the OR.

His scrubs were stained with blood. Behind his mask, his dark eyes flashed with a brief wave of exhaustion.

Her gaze lingered too long. He noticed, and when he looked her way, his gaze was just as cold as always.

""What are you doing here?"" Nathan‚Äôs voice was flat, but the chill in it was obvious.

Lucy could tell‚Äîhe was in a bad mood.

Which made it the perfect time to stir the pot.

She gave the little box of emergency contraceptives a casual shake. ""Came to grab some meds. Figured I‚Äôd drop by.""

Nathan glanced at the box, and his expression immediately soured.

It didn‚Äôt take long for people to start staring. He was good-looking, she was gorgeous, and the tension between them was so thick it practically screamed complicated.

""Wait in my office,"" he said.

When Nathan came in after changing out of his scrubs, Lucy was just finishing her water, the pill already down.

""I told you not to come here,"" he said as he walked over, still wearing his surgical mask. His tone was flat. When she looked up, she caught the sharp disapproval in his eyes.

Her eyes drifted over his broad shoulders. She wasn‚Äôt bothered by his attitude‚Äîjust paused for a beat and said, ‚ÄúI came to pick up some meds. Started feeling off, so I thought you could check me out.‚Äù

""What‚Äôs wrong?"" he asked.

""It hurts."" She placed a hand over her lower abdomen.

He gave her an indifferent. ""I‚Äôm a surgeon. You should see an OB-GYN for that.""

""There‚Äôs a male doctor on duty today. Not exactly ideal."" Lucy looked up at him, steady-eyed. ""Besides, you're familiar with me. I trust you more.""

He held her stare for a beat, then motioned to the exam table. ""Lie down. I‚Äôll check.""

Lucy followed instructions without fuss, lying flat and staring straight at him as he examined her.

When Nathan was in work mode, he was all focus. The chill in his eyes had faded a little, and‚Äîstrangely enough‚Äîhis touch was gentler than it had been in bed just a few hours ago.

Wearing his white coat, Nathan felt distant‚Äîalmost untouchable. Thinking back to what had happened just hours earlier, it all felt oddly unreal.

""You‚Äôll be fine. Just put some cream on it and take it easy,"" he said, stepping back.

Lucy gave him a long, meaningful look.

Nathan didn‚Äôt flinch. He peeled off his gloves, handed her the prescription, totally composed.

She glanced at the paper and raised an eyebrow. ""Burn cream?""

Nathan looked down at the blister on her hand.

Her fingers tingled. As he started taking off his coat, she asked, ""Dinner?""

He paused mid-movement, then turned, giving her a long, unreadable look.

Lucy curled her fingers slightly. ""It‚Äôs been six months since we had dinner together.""

Nathan didn‚Äôt answer right away. He took a long stride and walked up to her.

Out of the white coat and back in a suit, he no longer looked like the calm, untouchable doctor. Now, he had an edge‚Äîsomething bold and quietly aggressive.

He stepped in close, and for a moment, it was just a little hard to breathe.

""You actually care about that?"" he asked, his voice calm, like it didn‚Äôt involve him at all.

Lucy took a step back, her expression unreadable. ""Not really. Just figured... why not?""

As Nathan moved past her, she caught the subtle scent of cologne‚Äîmasculine, clean, and unfamiliar. She frowned.

His eyes skimmed over her. He didn‚Äôt say another word and walked out.

It wasn‚Äôt until she picked up the cream at the pharmacy that she saw his text.

‚ÄúTurn right after the hospital. Second intersection.‚Äù

She paused for a beat and realized‚ÄîNathan was inviting her to dinner. So she turned away from the parking lot and walked toward the street.

Only one car was parked out front. A sleek, black Audi A8L‚Äîthe newest model, easily six figures.

Lucy hesitated. Then the taillights blinked twice.

She walked over as the window rolled down, revealing Nathan‚Äôs sharp, perfect profile. His shirt sleeves were rolled up to his elbows, the muscles in his forearms clearly defined, and his long fingers tapped the steering wheel with easy confidence.

For some reason, her mind flashed to how those hands had touched her earlier. Her ears started to burn.

""Get in,"" Nathan said, voice cool as ever, snapping her out of it.

She buckled up, then asked casually, ""When‚Äôd you get the new car?""

""A few days ago."" He glanced over just as she locked eyes with him.

She had sharp, beautiful eyes that held your attention without even trying. When she really looked at someone, it felt personal‚Äîlike she was saying more with her eyes than with words.

The car picked up speed without him noticing.

""There are already three cars in the garage. One of them you bought just six months ago."" Her gaze shifted forward. ""It‚Äôs not like you to lose interest that quickly.""

Nathan slowed down. His expression didn‚Äôt change. ""So?""

""Just saying. You‚Äôre not the impulsive type.""

He was rich but practical.

Lucy liked that about him.

After all, they were married. And when it came to money, he was generally generous with her.

Sometimes, she just had to push the right buttons.

She laid it all out in her head, neat and logical. The faint scent in the car was pleasant, subtle, and alluring.

But it wasn‚Äôt Nathan‚Äôs.

""Lucy."" His voice cut through the air, sharper than usual. ""Whatever game you're playing, drop it. If it‚Äôs not your business, keep your mouth shut.""

She turned to the window, her voice calm. ""I said one sentence, and you‚Äôre already getting defensive. What, hiding someone special this time?""

Nathan slammed the brakes. ""Get out."" His voice was cold. Too cold.

Even Lucy, usually unbothered, froze for a second.

But her body moved on instinct. The next thing she knew, she was standing on the sidewalk in the middle of the night, cold wind blowing through her hair.

Nathan‚Äôs Audi drove off, leaving a faint trail of exhaust behind.

The cold wind cleared her head. Nathan wasn‚Äôt playing this time. Whoever she was, he was serious about her.

He cared enough to toss Lucy out of the car without blinking.

They‚Äôd been married for two years, and this was the first time Nathan had ever left her like that‚Äîno warning, no pretense, just tossed her aside without a second thought.

Standing under the streetlight, Lucy pulled out her phone and called her assistant. ""Mila, keep following Nathan.""

""Got it, Ms. Barrett,"" Mila Myers replied cheerfully, then hesitated before hanging up.

Lucy asked, ""Something else?""

""It‚Äôs nothing, Ms. Barrett. I‚Äôm just honestly curious‚Äîwho even is Nathan‚Äôs wife? I‚Äôve been following him for months, caught him cheating more than once, and she hasn‚Äôt reacted at all. It‚Äôs like she couldn‚Äôt care less. If it were me, I‚Äôd have Nathan tied up and knocked around by now. Just because he‚Äôs rich and hot doesn‚Äôt mean he can do whatever he wants.""

Lucy‚Äôs brow twitched. ‚ÄúAre you done?‚Äù

**Chapter 3 I'm Taking a Shower**

Mila actually hadn‚Äôt finished talking, but she could hear the edge in Lucy‚Äôs voice and quickly backed down. ""That‚Äôs all, Ms. Barrett. Have a good night,"" she murmured.

Lucy gave a soft ‚ÄúMm-hmm‚Äù and ended the call.

Right after, she texted Mila the license plate number of the Audi A8 and told her to keep an eye on it.

When Lucy walked through the door, the housekeeper, Sarah, looked up in surprise. Seeing her come home alone in nothing but a thin blouse, Sarah quickly poured a cup of hot milk and handed it over. ""Mrs. Douglas, didn‚Äôt Mr. Douglas come back with you?""

Lucy took the cup, her fingers tightening slightly around the warm glass. Her gaze dropped.

""Isn‚Äôt it normal that he doesn‚Äôt?"" she replied calmly.

""Did you eat yet?""

After Nathan kicked her out of the car, she walked back, so she was a little hungry.

""No.""

""I got you a birthday cake. Happy birthday, Mrs. Douglas.""

Lucy looked up in mild surprise. ""You remembered it‚Äôs my birthday?""

Sarah smiled shyly. ""Last year, Mr. Douglas brought you flowers and gifts on this day. It stuck with me.""

Lucy‚Äôs expression cooled at the mention of him.

Last year, they‚Äôd only been married a year. Nathan had at least gone through the motions‚Äîa gift, flowers, and a dinner. This year, he didn‚Äôt even bother pretending to care.

She was eating the cake when Nathan came home.

He saw her sitting there like nothing had happened. His usually unreadable gaze narrowed slightly. Without a word, he tossed her coat‚Äîleft behind in the car‚Äîonto the table.

Lucy calmly set down her fork, leaned back in her chair, and glanced at him. ""Didn‚Äôt expect you to come back.""

Nathan still carried the chill from outside. ""I live here. Do I need to explain myself?""

She raised an eyebrow and slowly dabbed her lips with a napkin.

Nathan pulled out a chair and sat down across from her, legs slightly spread, leaning back like he owned the place.

Sarah, always attentive, quickly cut him a slice of cake too.

He ate without saying a word.

The cake on Lucy's plate was still only half eaten. She glanced at Nathan‚Äîhe ate in that calm, deliberate way of his, and somehow, his usual cold presence had mellowed just a bit.

He caught her staring and glanced up. ""Done?""

She shook her head lightly and went back to her cake. They both finished around the same time.

Nathan stood and headed upstairs. As he passed her, he said, ""Gift‚Äôs on your nightstand.""

That caught her off guard. She looked up. ""You didn‚Äôt forget?""

Nathan paused on the stairs and looked back, expression unreadable. ""Last Valentine‚Äôs Day, when I didn‚Äôt get you a gift, Grandpa and Grandma heard about it the next morning. That wasn‚Äôt your doing?""

Lucy didn‚Äôt deny it. Instead, a faint, almost playful smile tugged at her lips. ""Either way, thanks,"" she said, her tone a little lighter than before.

She usually kept her expression cold and unreadable. But when she smiled, even just a little, it changed everything. It gave her a quiet warmth that was hard to ignore, especially with a face like hers.

And with how pretty she was, even the slightest smile had a way of pulling you in.

Nathan‚Äôs eyes darkened. ""I‚Äôm taking a shower.""

When he said he was taking a shower, they both knew exactly what that meant. Their marriage didn‚Äôt have much in the way of love or conversation, but physical chemistry? He knew her body better than anyone, and she knew exactly when he lost control.

Tonight, though, Nathan was wilder.

He was rough‚Äîalmost reckless. Lucy‚Äôs skin was too delicate for that kind of grip‚Äîhe left red marks everywhere he touched. But instead of backing off, it only pushed Nathan further. She didn‚Äôt even know when she finally blacked out.

The next morning, she woke up to her phone ringing nonstop.

She was sprawled facedown on the bed, barely able to move. Her fingers, still numb with sleep, fumbled under the pillow, searching for her phone. Before she could reach it, Nathan‚Äôs arm slid past her and grabbed it first.

""Yeah?"" His voice was low, raspy from sleep, and unintentionally seductive.

There was a pause on the other end. Then a cautious voice asked, ""Ms. Barrett?""

Nathan‚Äôs brow instantly furrowed. He tossed the phone onto the bed beside her. ""It‚Äôs yours.""

It was Mila.

Apparently, the morning meeting had been going for half an hour, and Lucy still hadn‚Äôt shown. People were starting to wonder if something had happened.

Lucy rubbed her forehead.¬†*I can‚Äôt believe I actually overslept because of sex with Nathan.*¬†Completely out of character for her.

""Sorry for the delay. Tell everyone to get back to work. I‚Äôll have someone send out a follow-up with what we were going to cover.""

""Got it, I‚Äôll let them know. Talk soon, Ms. Barrett.""

Mila hung up quickly. Lucy didn‚Äôt think much of it‚Äîprobably just awkward about Nathan picking up.

It wasn‚Äôt until she got to the office that she noticed it‚Äîeveryone‚Äôs eyes kept drifting her way, full of curiosity and barely hidden gossip.

After a few client calls, Mila came into her office holding a coffee in one hand and a stack of documents in the other. She set them down quickly on Lucy‚Äôs desk.

Lucy took a sip of the coffee.

Before Lucy could say a word, Mila spun on her heel. ""Okay! I‚Äôll leave you to it, Ms. Barrett!""

Her guilty look was impossible to miss.

Lucy lightly tapped her fingers on the desk. ""Stop.""

Mila froze, clearly panicking.

Lucy looked up. ""What did you screw up?""

""Screw up? I‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶"" Mila panicked, waving her hands, but quickly gave in under Lucy‚Äôs stare. ""Okay, look. Please don‚Äôt be mad.""

Lucy didn‚Äôt say a word. Just waited.

Mila sighed in defeat. ""This morning, when I called you‚Ä¶ I kind of accidentally hit speakerphone.""

And just like that, it all made sense. Which meant now the entire office knew their boss had spent the night with a man.

And not just any man‚Äîhis voice alone was enough to fill in the rest. Low, rough, effortlessly sexy. The kind of voice that practically promised a perfect face and a body built to ruin you. And considering who their boss was‚Äîbrilliant, beautiful, and wildly successful‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt like just anyone could measure up. No wonder everyone wanted to know who, exactly, had ended up in her bed.

Nathan was exactly the kind of man people noticed. Rich, ridiculously hot, and the definition of hard to resist. Women were always looking for a reason to get close. Lucy knew that better than anyone‚Äîshe‚Äôd used his flings as leverage more than once. She had more than enough photos to prove it.

At the moment, all she felt was a headache coming on.

She kept her personal life locked down for a reason‚Äîand the last thing she needed was for anyone to find out she and Nathan were married.

Mila could see her boss‚Äôs blank expression and started panicking even more. Lucy was the type who got scariest when she looked calm.

Mila blurted, ""I swear I didn‚Äôt mean to! I was just trying to get you on the line‚Äî""

Lucy held up a hand, cutting her off. ""Fine. I‚Äôll give you one chance to fix this.""",1,1752488825.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

""My birthday wish is for Phoebe to be my mommy,"" Estela Leon heard her daughter Rowena Leon say from behind the door.

She clutched her mouth, trying to muffle the sobs that broke out-Phoebe Silva was her husband Vance Leon's mistress.

She had already stolen Vance. Now, she wanted to take her children too.

But today was Rowena's birthday. Estela didn't want to ruin the celebration.

She wiped away her tears and stepped into the room with a gift. Rowena, who loved looking pretty, pulled away the moment she reached to touch her head.

""And Mommy, you have a cold. Stay away from me-don't mess up my hair. Phoebe did these braids. If they get messed up, she'll be upset.""

Estela watched Rowena and her son Josh Leon excitedly talk about making clothes for Phoebe. In the corner, a little doll meant to be ""Mommy"" lay forgotten, tossed aside.

Her chest tightened, and a bitter taste spread in her mouth.

She had been in a secret marriage with Vance for three years. To everyone else, Phoebe was seen as his rightful wife.

But after just a few months apart, even her own children-flesh and blood-now seemed to prefer another woman.

Estela lowered her eyes and stood in silence for a long while, only heading upstairs to shower and rest when the housekeeper quietly reminded her.

Just then, Vance's secretary arrived. He paused for a moment, surprised to see her.

""Ma'am, Mr. Leon won't be coming home tonight. He asked me to pick up the gift he prepared for Ms. Silva,"" the secretary said.

""Alright,"" Estela said softly.

Once the secretary left, a sharp pain shot through her chest.

He remembered to prepare a gift for Phoebe-but not once had he ever given her anything.

She dialed a video call.

It connected quickly.

""What is it?""

The screen showed Vance's private lounge.

Elegant, luxurious, bathed in dazzling light-every inch oozed the extravagance that Zrefast was known for.

He wore a six-figure tailored suit, held a wine glass, and lounged casually on the sofa.

There was nothing calculating about him-just cool elegance. His expression was calm, aloof, and untouchable, like frost or snow. He was the kind of man people dreamed of but could never reach.

Estela had loved him for six whole years.

Her voice softened. ""It's been a while since we saw each other. Tonight, maybe-""

""Vance-""

Before she could finish, a soft, feminine voice chimed in on his end.

It was Phoebe.

The call cut off immediately.

Just before the screen went black, Vance said simply, ""We'll talk later.""

Estela tightened her grip on the phone, staring out at the towering skyline beyond the window.

Cars streamed through the streets like rivers of light. The city shimmered-so bright and beautiful it almost didn't seem real.

Her husband, Vance, controlled a financial empire and moved markets with ease. But for her-his wife-he had no warmth, no time, no care.

Six years, and he'd never changed. Always cold. Always distant.

Behind every kind word or gentle look was a wall she could never get past.

She'd spent all these years trying to win back his heart.

But in that moment, for the very first time-Estela felt something shift. She was tired.

Estela didn't call him back. She drifted into a restless, heavy sleep.

The next day, Vance finally sent a message: \[Sorry. Happy third anniversary.\]

Then another: \[This is to make up for it.\]

Not long after, a bank alert came through-an eight-figure deposit.

She scrolled past the messages, just as a notification popped up from Phoebe's social media.

\[A custom-made diamond ring from Egoset-eight months in the making. A once-in-a-lifetime piece. Thank you, Mr. Leon.\]

In the post, Phoebe was all smiles, radiant and charming. A dazzling diamond sparkled on her pale, delicate hand.

Dressed in a rose-red gown, she posed beneath a famous tower, the fabric swirling around her like wine. The whole image screamed luxury, decadence-and intention.

Estela suddenly remembered the day before she married Vance.

It was in the family's quiet, old estate. He'd walked past her along the corridor. His eyes were calm, unreadable-but they had seen straight through her illusions.

He said, ""I'll marry you. But that's all.""

Back then, she'd thought the line ""I want love, not money"" sounded childish-naive, even.

But now, for the first time, she got it.

For six years, she'd chased a fantasy-thinking all she wanted was his love.

And she'd never had it.

She forced down the emotions building inside her and quietly went downstairs.

In the garden, she heard Rowena's innocent, sing-song voice, laced with a hint of complaint. ""Why did Mommy come back? Phoebe promised to take us to see the bear ballet today. I wish Mommy just never came back.""

Chapter 2

""Yeah,"" Josh said softly, eyes downcast. ""Billy said Daddy only married Mommy because he couldn't marry Phoebe. Mommy's pretty, but I still like Phoebe more.""

The words hit Estela like ice water down her spine-sharp, sudden, cruel.

'He couldn't marry her?' she thought.

The shock took a moment to fade, and when it did, her heart felt hollow.

She looked at her children.

She'd nearly died giving birth to them-both times. Complications, hemorrhaging.

They'd been weak, sickly babies, and she'd cared for them around the clock. Barely slept, barely ate. It ruined her health.

Then something happened in Zrefast. Vance's father Reggie Leon fell gravely ill.

Vance went back to take charge-and brought the kids with him.

Since then, she'd been traveling back and forth between two cities. But every time she came back, the children seemed farther and farther away.

She didn't even remember how she got back to her room.

The kids had private lessons scheduled. The nanny took them out.

Even with everything on her plate, Estela messaged Vance again to ask for a meeting.

She was his wife. Whether it was about the kids or about Phoebe, she had every right to demand answers.

But he brushed her off with a single line. ""I have something important. Let's talk tomorrow night.""

There was no way to describe the bitterness welling up inside her.

She left the house without thinking and wandered to the place where she and Vance had first met-an old amusement park.

It was small, tucked away in a corner of the city.

Just as she stepped in and approached the Ferris wheel, she heard a familiar little voice. ""Phoebe, I want to ride the Ferris wheel!""

""Okay, I'll go get the tickets.""

Estela looked up-and there they were.

Not far away, Phoebe and Vance, each holding one of her children's hands. They looked, unmistakably, like a perfect family.

Soon, Estela heard her children's voices. ""You're the best. I want to be with you forever.""

Phoebe laughed softly, teasing, ""If your mom hears that, she won't be happy.""

""I don't like her. Why should I care if she's mad?""

The words hit Estela like a blast of arctic wind.

She stood frozen, watching in silence as Vance and her children walked hand in hand with Phoebe into the Ferris wheel.

The man she had loved for six years. The children she had brought into the world.

Without another moment's hesitation, Estela turned and walked away.

She'd been holding on for six years-it was time to let go.

Back at the old house, she quietly packed up all of her belongings.

Then she sent Vance one final message: \[Have the divorce papers ready.\]

She left her wedding ring on the nightstand, walked out without a backward glance, and called a cab to the airport.

\*\*\*\*\*

After leaving the church, Vance returned to the old house with the children.

The area outside the church was packed. Just as he was about to check his phone, someone shouted-

""Stop! Thief!""

A commotion erupted.

The bodyguards instinctively moved to shield him, but in the chaos, Phoebe was shoved forward-right into Vance's arms.

His phone slipped from his hand, crashed to the ground, and was crushed under the stampede of feet.

""Vance, I'm so sorry-your phone."" she said.

He frowned briefly, then said calmly, ""It's fine. I'll get another one.""

The phone was mostly used to keep in touch with family anyway.

Not that anyone in the Leon family texted much. If anyone messaged him at all, it was usually Estela.

But her messages had never seemed urgent.

\*\*\*\*\*

On the way home, the kids were buzzing with excitement.

Rowena tugged on his sleeve, eyes sparkling. ""Daddy, is Phoebe really going to stay with us soon? She promised to take me to Candyland!""

Even Josh looked hopeful.

""Yes,"" Vance nodded.

But Josh hesitated, frowning slightly. ""But Daddy. Mommy said we're not very healthy, and the air at Candyland might make us sick. She didn't want us to go. Won't Mommy be upset if she finds out Phoebe's moving in?""

Vance responded gently, ""Phoebe is trained in medicine. She once saved Daddy's life. With her here, you'll both be fine. Your mommy won't be staying long anyway. Phoebe's just visiting for a while to help take care of you.""

The kids had always been frail. Having Phoebe around might actually do them some good.

""Yay!"" They both shouted in delight as they arrived home.

But the moment they stepped inside, they found something that made them even happier-Estela had gone back to Trurgh.

Vance noticed the wedding ring placed neatly on the nightstand and paused, mildly surprised.

Ever since they got married, no matter how badly they fought, Estela had never taken off that ring.

Chapter 3

Now she had left without a word-and taken the ring off, too.

'Is she upset again? Feeling neglected?' he thought.

Estela had always been gentle and soft-spoken-like most women from Trurgh, traditional and reserved. No matter how coldly he treated her, she never pushed back.

'Well, even the calmest person has a breaking point,' he thought.

Still, Vance didn't take it too seriously.

He tossed the ring aside without a second thought.

""Mrs. Leon won't be coming back for a while. Pack up her things. Clean out the room-Ms. Silva will be moving in soon,"" he ordered.

Rowena and Josh's eyes instantly lit up.

'Now that Mom is gone, Phoebe can finally move in,' they thought.

'And no one would be breathing down our necks anymore-asking the doctors endless questions about our physical activity.'

'Mom always makes such a big deal out of everything. She insists we meet our monthly exercise quotas and hovers over us every time she comes home.'

""It's just a pity,"" Josh muttered gloomily. ""Mom said she'd help us finish building that spaceship. It's super hard.""

The puzzle had thousands of tiny pieces. Once completed, it would become an intricate model of a spaceship. Josh had been planning to give it to Phoebe as a birthday gift.

But it was exhausting and hard on the eyes-he'd been waiting for Estela to help.

Rowena pouted too. ""She was supposed to finish sewing clothes for my doll before she left.""

Every time Estela came back, she'd make a whole new wardrobe for the dolls. Phoebe always said how good Estela was at picking fabrics and matching colors.

But this time, Estela left so suddenly that the clothes weren't ready.

Now Phoebe wouldn't see them, and there'd be no compliments.

Estela wasn't as fun or glamorous as Phoebe, but when it came to fiddly little projects like this-she was actually really good.

\*\*\*\*\*

Meanwhile, in Trurgh-miles away-Estela returned to the home she once shared with Vance.

After he moved back to Zrefast with the kids, Estela had stayed behind. Officially, it was for work, but in truth, it was mostly to care for his parents.

Reggie had long settled in Zrefast, but the rest of the family had moved to Trurgh over a decade ago.

High society in Zrefast had its own rigid rules-everything from dress codes to dinner etiquette was micromanaged.

Rosalyn Leon never got along with Reggie and had no interest in returning to that life. She was used to being pampered and calling the shots-and preferred life in Trurgh, where things went her way.

The Leon family wasn't fond of women who were too outspoken or ambitious, so for Vance's sake, Estela had kept a low profile and stayed behind as the dutiful daughter-in-law.

Her job at Leon Group had always been in name only.

But now that she had made up her mind to divorce Vance, none of that mattered anymore.

She packed up everything in their marital home and prepared to hand over the keys.

Just as she came downstairs, suitcase in hand, the butler happened to see her.

""Mrs. Leon, you're back. Rosalyn mentioned she was craving that fish soup you made last time.""

But when he saw the luggage, he froze mid-sentence.

Estela handed him the house keys.

""I won't be living here anymore,"" she said with a faint smile. ""If she wants soup, tell her to hire a chef.""

Without waiting for a response, Estela turned and walked out-ignoring the butler's stunned expression.

That night, Rosalyn didn't get her fish soup.

\*\*\*\*\*

Later that evening, Vance video-called Rosalyn. She didn't waste time voicing her discontent.

""Honestly, you never should've married a woman from Trurgh. Can't even cook a simple dish of fish soup,"" she said.

He looked mildly surprised.

Estela had always been respectful and compliant, especially toward elders. Her defiance this time? Unexpected.

""It's just a dish,"" he said indifferently. ""If she won't make it, get someone else who will.""

Rosalyn looked uncomfortable.

Truth be told, she'd already tried hiring several chefs-but none of them could get it quite right. Not like Estela did.

Still, she couldn't admit that in front of her son. She muttered a vague reply and left it at that.

Off to the side, the butler hesitated, unsure whether to say anything about Estela moving out of the house.

""Mr. Leon. Mrs. Leon, she. she's moved out.""

He barely got the words out before Vance cut him off, voice cold and flat. ""Forget it. Leave her alone.""

Vance ended the call without a second thought.

Through the floor-to-ceiling windows of his office overlooking Zrefast, a faint trace of annoyance flickered across his otherwise impeccable face.

He glanced at his newly replaced phone, but in the end, didn't call the contact at the top of his list.

Chapter 4

Back at the church, both his phone and SIM card had been destroyed.

At first, he'd intended to let Estela know-she was still his wife, after all.

But lately, it seemed all the special treatment he'd given her over the years had gone to her head.

A little lesson wouldn't hurt.

Unaware of any of this, Estela slept soundly through the night.

The next morning, she returned to the Leon Group and submitted her resignation.

It went through without a hitch.

When Vance had placed her in the company, it was a low-level, nominal role. No one really knew her true identity.

So once she completed her handover, she could leave cleanly.

When word got out, a coworker remarked with a knowing smile, ""Must be for your kids, huh? They're what, four? Five? That age clings to their mom like glue. You always had their pictures on your desk-and that necklace with their little faces on it. You've always treated them like treasures.""

Estela paused.

She had loved Vance-deeply. And naturally, she loved the two children they had together. Even now, separated by cities, she still cared deeply for Rowena and Josh.

But.

She shook her head, offering a small smile. ""It's not about them.""

And that was the truth.

The Leon Group was massive and well-connected internationally, but its focus-construction and real estate-was never her passion.

Before, as Vance's wife, she hadn't questioned it. The expectations from the Leon family left little room for her own ambitions.

But now that she had chosen to leave him, she needed to choose her own future.

Her gaze drifted to her phone, where a headline flashed across the screen. \[National Heritage Expo: The Fragrant Arts.\]

Perfume blending. Coffee ceremony. Modern reinterpretations of traditional craftsmanship.

Something about it caught her eye.

Without hesitation, she texted her cousin, Wilford Warren: \[Any chance you can get me a ticket to this event?\]

He responded almost instantly. \[Of course. But aren't you always too busy? Between the Leon family and the kids, when do you ever have time for this kind of thing?\]

\[I do now.\] Estela replied calmly. \[I'm divorced.\]

There was a pause.

\[Wait-seriously?\] Wilford's response came with a stunned breath. \[You actually divorced into that Leon family?\]

The same Leon family who had built a private rooftop amusement park in the heart of Zrefast-just for their grandchildren. No outsiders allowed.

Back when Estela's parents died, the only reason the Leon family even considered the marriage was because her grandfather Keven Warren had once done them a great favor.

Otherwise, no way would they have let Vance marry the daughter of a university professor.

Even if that professor's father was none other than Keven-the renowned scholar of classical arts.

\[If it doesn't feel right, walk away.\] Estela replied lightly, with a smile.

Wilford couldn't tell if he admired her courage or pitied her choices. Maybe a bit of both.

Wilford: \[But... what about Rowena and Josh? Can you really let them go?\]

Estela glanced at her phone.

When the kids had moved back to Zrefast, she'd made sure they each had a phone-just in case they missed her and wanted to call.

But over the past year, unless she reached out first, neither of them had ever called her.

They had everything now: a powerful family name, a life of privilege. and a woman they already saw as their mother.

'So why should I keep clinging to a connection that only exists in blood?' she wondered.

\*\*\*\*\*

Back in Zrefast, inside the Leon family's estate, the nutritionist gently reminded the children, ""Josh, Rowena, did you forget what Ms. Warren said? No being picky with food. Your bodies are still fragile-you need a balanced intake of fat to grow up healthy. And no overdoing it with sweets.""

Josh hesitated, looking uncertain.

But Rowena waved it off like it was nothing.

""Mom already missed her check-in call! She won't know anything. Besides, Phoebe said kids should be happy! And right now, the thing that makes me happiest is eating all these cupcakes!""

Just then, a light laugh floated down from upstairs.

Phoebe came down, smiling as she walked over and gently tapped Rowena on the forehead. ""You little troublemaker. Alright-whatever Rowena and Josh want, they can have.""

""Yay! Phoebe, you're the best! I wish you could stay with us forever!""

Their innocent cheers made Phoebe's smile deepen.

The nutritionist frowned. She opened her mouth to object, but when her gaze landed on Phoebe, she hesitated-and fell silent.

At first, she had assumed Estela was the lady of the house. But now it was clear: Phoebe moved around the Leon family like she belonged. The kids were clearly attached to her.

If she upset Phoebe, it might not sit well with Vance.

Josh, meanwhile, was conflicted.

Chapter 5

Last time he ignored Estela's advice, he ended up really sick.

Phoebe was sweet, and he did like her-but Estela had warned him that if he kept eating recklessly, he'd get seriously ill again, and Vance would be worried too.

He didn't want to cause either of them stress. So as he ate, he held back, choosing more carefully.

Rowena, however, wasn't as cautious. She ate too much-mixing cold and hot foods, creamy desserts, and sugary treats. By nightfall, she was doubled over in pain.

Curled up on her bed, she trembled from the stomach cramps. Her soft, pale face looked pitiful, flushed and tear-streaked.

When Vance heard Rowena wasn't feeling well, he rushed home immediately.

Rowena tugged on his sleeve with teary eyes and a trembling voice.

""Daddy. did I get sick because I was bad? Did Mommy punish me with a stomachache? She said if I ate too many cupcakes again, a witch would curse me. I didn't mean to. I want Mommy to come back and undo the spell."" she said.

More than anything, she missed how Estela would always make her warm soup whenever she was feeling sick.

Now, all she could do was cry, a mess of tears and runny nose.

Beside them, Phoebe bit her lip, looking guilty. ""Vance, I'm so sorry. I wasn't paying close enough attention. I let Rowena eat too many sweets.""

Rowena quickly jumped to her defense, worried her father might be upset with Phoebe. ""Daddy, it's not her fault! It's because Mommy forgot to call me! She doesn't care about me anymore.""

Josh blinked in confusion. Thankfully, he'd remembered what Estela said last time he got sick.

Even if Estela didn't laugh and play like Phoebe, she always paid close attention when it came to their health.

Still, since Phoebe was always so kind, he couldn't help but speak up for her too.

""Daddy. Mommy used to remind us a lot. Rowena's still little-she just forgets things sometimes.""

""Understood,"" Vance said, his tone a bit firmer now. ""From now on, both of you need to follow the nutritionist's instructions. No more sneaking snacks.""

He didn't blame Phoebe for what happened. In fact, he found himself even more frustrated with Estela.

'Isn't this exactly what she is supposed to be doing? She used to handle all of Rowena's meals and routines,' he thought.

But now that she couldn't even be bothered to check in properly, Rowena had gotten sick. As far as he saw it, this was on her.

Estela had no idea Rowena had been sick.

That Sunday, she still thought to check in and called the kids over video chat.

She was their mother, after all. Even if the emotional bond wasn't what it used to be, she still had a duty to them.

When the call came through, Rowena and Josh were busy helping Phoebe try on evening gowns.

In just a few days, Reggie would be discharged from the hospital.

Normally, that would mean Vance had no reason to stay in Zrefast and would head back to Trurgh to continue expanding the business.

But the idea of returning made the twins visibly glum.

They weren't ready to see Estela again. And they definitely didn't want to leave Phoebe.

Seeing their downcast faces, Phoebe smiled and gently ruffled their hair. ""Hmm. let me guess. Why are my little prince and princess so upset?""

She paused dramatically. ""Is it because we're heading back to Trurgh? I thought you'd be excited to see your mom again.""

Rowena's eyes welled with tears. She pouted and mumbled, ""What's so great about seeing Mom? We don't want to leave you.""

Josh nodded. He did miss Estela a little, but the thought of parting with Phoebe made him hesitate.

""Well then,"" Phoebe said with a playful glint in her eye, ""I have some good news.""

She let the suspense hang for a second, then smiled.

""I've got work to do in Trurgh. I'll be staying there for quite a while-so I'll be coming with you!""

""Really?"" Rowena lit up, cheering with joy. If Phoebe was coming to Trurgh too, then everything would be perfect.

Right at that moment, Estela's video call came through.

The ringtone echoed a few times. Rowena stared at the screen, then deliberately let it ring out before hanging up.

Estela called again. And again.

Annoyed, Rowena finally blocked the number.

Phoebe chuckled and gave her a gentle poke on the forehead but didn't scold her. ""Rowena, why didn't you answer your mom's call?""

""She didn't call me the other day on purpose, and I got sick. She's so mean-I don't want to talk to her!"" Rowena pouted.

Besides, they'd be going back to Trurgh soon. She'd see Estela then anyway.

And if Estela found out Phoebe was moving in, she'd definitely be upset.

Chapter 6

Rowena didn't want anyone messing with her and Phoebe's time together.

Phoebe pinched her cheek with a warm smile. ""As long as our little princess is happy, that's all that matters.""

Josh had a fleeting sense that something about all this wasn't quite right. But when he saw the calm expression on Phoebe's face, his doubt faded.

Vance always said Phoebe was special-not like other women.

And if she didn't think Rowena had done anything wrong, then maybe it really wasn't a big deal.

Besides, they'd be seeing Estela again soon anyway.

On the other end of the line, Estela stared at the red exclamation mark on her phone screen, stunned.

This was a phone she had specially set up just for the twins.

No one else used it. No one else had access.

She'd known their relationship had grown distant since they'd gone to Zrefast-but she never imagined they would block her.

Still worried, she called the housekeeper at the villa, the one in charge of the children's daily care.

""Ma'am, the children are doing great,"" the woman said cheerfully. ""Right now they're helping Ms. Silva try on dresses.""

The mention of ""Ms. Silva"" hit Estela like a pin to the chest.

Those were her children-children she had nearly died bringing into this world.

And now, they were looking to another woman for comfort and care.

""As long as they're okay,"" she replied quietly.

She didn't bring up the fact that her children had blocked her.

She knew their personalities-spoiled since birth, prone to sulking. Blocking her was just another form of acting out.

If this had happened before, she might have kept calling. Again and again. Refusing to give up.

But now. she found she no longer had the energy.

As long as they were safe and healthy, that was enough.

Whether or not they still saw her as their mother-that was no longer something she could control.

Two days later, Reggie was discharged from the hospital.

Vance soon made the decision to return to Trurgh and expand the Leon Group's presence there.

Before leaving, Rowena and Josh said their goodbyes to classmates at school.

The farewell gifts were chosen by Phoebe.

But the kids who received them didn't seem all that thrilled.

""Barbies and toy cars? These are kinda old now,"" one of their closest friends muttered. ""I liked those teddy bear cakes your mom made way better. Why didn't you bring those?""

Rowena pressed her lips together.

Those teddy bear cakes were Estela's specialty. They were complicated to make-Estela had burned her hands several times trying to get them just right.

But Phoebe didn't know how to make them. 'If only Mom were here.' Rowena thought.

Josh looked down too.

Ever since Rowena had blocked Estela's number, she hadn't called them once.

He hadn't heard her voice in what felt like forever-and honestly, he kind of missed her.

Still, he'd be seeing her soon.

But if Estela was back, that probably meant less time with Phoebe.

Vance had no idea what the kids were thinking.

When the housekeeper called to inform him, she said, ""Sir, Mrs. Leon hasn't been back to the villa for over a week. Would you like us to let her know you're returning?""

He frowned. His tone cooled immediately. ""No need. If she's not coming back, then clear out the master bedroom. I'll be moving in there with Rowena, Josh, and Phoebe.""

In the past, he'd only stayed in the marital home when visiting the children.

But since Estela insisted on giving him the cold shoulder, she had no business returning to that house.

Meanwhile, back in Trurgh, Estela had moved into her old apartment and started growing flowers on the balcony.

She wasn't particularly skilled at gardening, but maybe it was the peace of being on her own-or simply being free from her marriage-that made everything feel lighter.

Her neighbor, Cleveland, was quick to scold whenever he saw her plants. ""Girl, if you don't know how to grow flowers, stop drowning them! They're about to keel over!"" he'd grumble, beard twitching with annoyance.

After stepping in to rescue the plants himself, another neighbor pulled Estela aside, smiling apologetically.

""Don't mind the old man-he's been extra cranky lately. Word is his grandson's refusing to get married, and they had a big falling out. He stormed off and moved in here to cool down.""

Estela just smiled.

The Leon family had been steeped in strict rules and formality. She'd spent years tiptoeing around, doing everything to please them.

Cleveland might be grumpy and old-fashioned, but with his help, gardening suddenly felt more manageable.

Over time, the two formed an unexpected friendship, one that felt strangely comforting.

That evening, Estela got a message from Delia Allison, her senior from university.

Chapter 7

When Delia learned Estela would be attending the National Heritage Expo, she immediately suggested they go together.

Estela had studied design in college-sharp, creative, and full of fresh ideas. She had once joined Delia's design studio under the pseudonym Smile, contributing to several dazzling, standout projects.

But after marrying into the Leon family, she'd quietly stepped away.

Delia's studio, meanwhile, had steadily risen to prominence. It was no surprise she'd been invited to such a major industry event.

When Estela arrived, Delia was already surrounded by admirers, navigating the room like a star.

In recent years, she'd made quite a name for herself, with a strong presence in the design world.

People gravitated toward her effortlessly, eager to introduce themselves, eager to be seen.

A successful woman always shone brightest-men, in contrast, felt more like props in the background.

Estela watched from a distance and lowered her gaze.

For years, she had poured her heart into Vance and their children-so much so, she had nearly forgotten who she used to be.

'Could I still be that bold, brilliant designer I once was?' she wondered.

Just as the thought surfaced, Delia made her way over.

""This year's expo is really something. A lot of new talent showing up,"" she said with a knowing smile. ""Watching them today reminded me of you. Back when I tried to keep you at Allison Group-it's a shame how things turned out.""

Allison Group had been the name of Delia's college startup-the predecessor to her current firm.

Estela gave a small, bittersweet smile. ""Allison Group's doing just fine without me.""

In the world of design, fresh talent emerged constantly. No one could stay on top forever.

Besides, she hadn't been part of that world for years.

""I don't agree,"" Delia said, lighting a cigarette and finally saying what she'd been holding in all these years.

Estela looked up when she heard the words, her long lashes fluttering slightly as she gazed at the artwork on display.

Delia raised an eyebrow. ""The Rangel Group has been focused on developing a modern aesthetic these past couple of years - from jewelry to fashion. That just happens to be your area of expertise. Estela, I need you.""

Estela was no stranger to the Rangel Group.

In recent years, it had expanded rapidly, especially in traditional industries.

Its head, Wesley Rangel, though young, had already earned a reputation for being ruthless and calculating, with a sharp eye for the future.

It didn't surprise Estela that Delia was trying to team up with the Rangel Group to carve out a space in the design market.

'But... could I really go back to that world?' she wondered.

Just as the thought crossed her mind, a cold, aloof voice called out from nearby. ""Estela? Shouldn't you be taking care of Mom? What are you doing here?""

It was Thelma Leon- Vance's younger sister, and a star student at Choross University.

Ever since Estela married into the Leon family, Thelma had kept her at arm's length.

She had nothing but disdain for women like Estela - women who relied on men, buried themselves in housework, and, in her eyes, had no real worth.

Estela hadn't expected to run into her here.

She didn't offer much explanation. ""Just came to take a look.""

""These pieces have significant artistic value,"" Thelma said coolly. ""Even the simplest design here is probably beyond your understanding. My brother, Josh and Rowena will be back soon. You'd be better off focusing on them.""

To her, Estela was nothing special. Sure, she'd heard that Estela had a decent education and some design talent before marrying in, but in the end, she was just another woman who landed on her feet by marrying well. 'What real ability could she possibly have?' she wondered.

Estela stood frozen for a moment. 'Vance is coming back?' she thought.

Her fingers curled slightly, a trace of bitterness rising in her chest.

Even though they were getting divorced, he was returning with the child - and he hadn't even bothered to tell her.

In his eyes, the woman who had once been Mrs. Leon really didn't matter at all.

Thelma, never one for small talk with Estela, was about to leave when something crossed her mind - the fish soup Rosalyn had been craving.

""Oh, right,"" she said offhandedly. ""If you've got time, make some of that fish soup. You're not exactly busy, and your cooking's still passable.""

In the past, Estela would've agreed without a second thought.

Back then, she'd done everything she could to win the Leon family's approval. No matter how complicated the request, if Rosalyn asked for it, she'd make it happen.

But now? She didn't care anymore.

""Sorry. I've got my own things to take care of. Let the chef handle it.""",1,1752488761.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False
