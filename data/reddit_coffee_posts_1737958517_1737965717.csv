She’s always been blunt and I love that for her, but ever since we started living together she’s had major controlling issues, and has gotten more loud and violent if I did something she didn’t like. Like I went to use my coffee machine that she put on her desk and she screamed at me in the morning and stated I touched her stuff and threw her medication container spilling it every where, then it happened again when I went to grab something that was mine she put in there actively, and yelled about touching it. She’s hurt me physically and verbally more times then I can count, we’ve had multiple sessions with our RAs about fights and they just want us to work it out, but I’m tired of being the good guy. Because when that happens she just belittles me in front of the other saying I didn’t come to her but I do every time and she ignores me until another person is involved.  I’m sitting outside in the cold because I’m too scared to sleep in the same room as her right now and it’s 2 in the morning. I’m sick and tired of it, she keeps treating me like I’m stupid and worthless and it really hurts because I try to do so much for her. And anytime I stand up for myself she tells me my life is so much better then hers when she don’t even see the pain she’s causing me.

1ib3ac3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1ib3ac3/things_i_can_do_to_help_my_wife/,Things I can do to help my wife,"Hey everyone, I am new here. Apologies for the long post. But I am feeling a bit lost and in need of help.

Wife (26F) and I (30M) have been married for almost 3 years now. She's a teacher and I'm working in the Software industry (mostly working from home). We've been wanting to have kids for the better part of the last 2 years. However, wife had to go through a surgery (craniotomy) in mid 2023 and the meds she had to take for recovery put our plans firmly on pause.

The doctor advised to stop the meds somewhere around March last year. We've been trying for months and finally it happened! We are pregnant!!

We are so happy and it still feels surreal. The more this feeling settles in, the more I'm realising how clueless I am to this.

I have a few questions I'd love some opinions on.

1. What is a good morning drink to start the day?
   * Both of us are (forced) early birds. We wake up around 5.30 to prepare for the day. So we have a cup of black coffee in the morning before we go to work. But we have stopped coffee as it is not good for the baby.
   * She likes to drink something I make for her (even if it tastes like dishwater sometimes lol). What are good alternatives I can try? She likes to drink black tea, but I hear it has caffeine as well. Neither of us like to drink milk. I'm out of sorts here.
   * Right now we are drinking a cup of hot water as a substitute. Please help!
2. Are we working too much to focus on the pregnancy?
   * I am working full time (albeit from home) and I am reading for my Master's degree. Which leaves me little time to help her out more than what I'm doing now.
   * I am leaving my current company to a new one in hopes to be less overworked than in my current position. But it's still a new place where I probably have to focus a little extra to set a good starting impression.
   * She's teaching for Cambridge exam students (both ordinary and advanced level). Which is a little bit stressful in her mind but she is doing a great job at it.
   * In addition to this, she is teaching in an online academy in the evenings. She's not a fan of this though. I am feeling a little guilty about this as I was the one who pushed her to try this to see if it works out as a potential alternative career (from the school) for her.
   * She is reading for her Master's degree and she has to start her thesis in the upcoming weeks. The submission of the thesis will likely fall close to the potential delivery date.
   * This over-busy schedule was a ""3 year plan"" we came up for both of us to complete our higher studies and plan for a better future. We knew this would mean sacrifices have to be made with time for each other. Stupidly enough, we never considered a child in this equation even though that's exactly what we wanted.
   * Does this seem too much for us to handle?
3. What to expect/prepare for?
   * I think we are 4-6 weeks into the pregnancy right now. What can we expect in the coming weeks/months? What are things we need to prepare for? What are things I should prepare for?

Beyond these, I am looking for general advice on what I can do to help my wife during the pregnancy. Videos/articles to read that can be helpful, things I can make for her, activities/exercises we can do, things NOT TO DO, etc. etc.

Thank you so much in advance for taking the time to read through my ramblings. Any help is highly appreciated.

I'm at a crossroads in my relationship.  My partner and I have been together a little over a year.  We've hit a rough patch lately and it's honestly miserable.  Fighting all the time, no romance, no sex.  

I'm considering leaving.  He's a great person, but I'm questioning our long-term compatibility.  One question I have is how important are shared hobbies and interests for long-term compatibility?

For example, I love going to wine bars, breweries, trivia nights at pubs, etc.  My partner is sober and wants to avoid those places at all costs.  Of course I support his sobriety, but it sucks because I really enjoy those sorts of things and would want to share them with my partner ideally.  I also love cooking, as does he, but he doesn't like cooking together because it distracts him.   I love exploring new neighborhoods and popping into shops, grabbing coffee, etc.  He hates that sort of thing.  His hobbies are all solitary in nature and ones I can't really be incorporated into.  I've tried to brainstorm ideas of things for us to do together, but I'm struggling.

I look at other couples in my life and they do fun things together.  They seem to have overlapping interests and spend them together.  I'm so envious.  My partner and I usually end up eating dinner and watching TV, maybe going to the occasional concert or something.  On the bright side, he is a sweet man and tells me he's committed to building a future with me, and to changing our dynamic so we have better conflict.

Am I reading too much into this?  Can relationships make it long-term if there aren't shared interests/hobbies?  Growing up, my parents never did anything together and now they're divorced (of course, there were many other reasons), so I'm worried that this is something to be concerned with.

I’ve been reflecting on how we, as Nepali consumers, spend money on daily necessities like coffee, momo, or snacks but hesitate to pay for apps. Outside Nepal, subscription-based apps have established thriving businesses, creating jobs for hundreds while providing real value to users.

Here, we see the opposite—most Nepali apps rely on ads because in-app subscriptions don’t work. Why is that?

Let’s break it down:

• A cup of coffee: Rs100+

• A plate of momo: Rs150+

• Bottled water: Rs30-Rs50

We spend this daily without blinking. Yet, when an app asks for Rs100-Rs200 a *month* (about Rs3-Rs6 a day), there’s resistance—even if the app saves us time, money, or helps us build better habits.

So, why does this happen?

1. Do we not see apps as “tangible”?

2. Are we conditioned to think apps should be free?

3. Is it because we’re used to free apps with ads?

4. Do Nepali apps lack the trust factor or haven’t proven their worth?

5. Does the idea of subscriptions feel like a bigger commitment than one-time payments?

6. Is it like we'd rather use the free alternatives than use the paid version, like we've been doing since we are kids, like using cracked Microsoft softwares, games, and more? 

Here’s the thing:

• A productivity app could save hours of your time, helping you earn more or simply relax.

• An educational app could teach you skills that boost your income or career.

• A habit tracker might help you stick to goals that improve your life.

Isn’t that worth Rs100-Rs200 per month?

I’m genuinely curious—what stops us from paying for apps? If you’ve hesitated before, why? What would make you feel an app subscription is worth it?

Let’s discuss—no judgment, just trying to understand the mindset!

And how do you think this could be changed - which could eventually pave way for innovation and economic development?",1,1737965357.0,technepal,1,1.0,False

Hello Comrades,

So I recently started a business and used Ai to generate the logo. My friends (who apparently have better eyesight than I do) have kindly pointed out that my “branding” screams “Amateur Hour”—and I can’t even argue with them.

Here’s the sitch:

I have the logo files already (they're… something).

I just need a talented beginner or student to transform them into a crisp, clean vector/SVG that doesn’t make people squint and wonder if they’re seeing a bird or a coffee stain.

I can offer you:

A student-friendly rate (think: “treat yo'self and maybe a few friends) 

The chance to practice those design muscles and add to your portfolio.

My eternal gratitude


Please don’t roast me too hard for seeking out a student designer. I’m a baby business owner trying to gain traction while also giving someone else a shot to shine. If that speaks to your soul (or your wallet), I’d love to hear from you.

DM me if you’re interested or if you know someone who’s at the “learning but definitely not clueless” stage in graphic design. I’ll throw some funds your way, you’ll get experience, and hopefully my logo will graduate from “AI kak” to “Ayeee, that’s lekker”

Morocco is magical year-round, but the cooler months (October to April) bring a unique charm.  While you'll miss the scorching summer heat,  you might find yourself needing extra layers.  Don't let a little chill dampen your Moroccan adventure!  This guide will help you stay toasty and enjoy every moment.

**Understanding Moroccan Weather:**

Morocco's weather varies dramatically depending on location and altitude. Coastal cities like Casablanca and Tangier tend to be milder, while inland areas like Marrakech and Fes can experience significantly cooler temperatures, especially at night. The Atlas Mountains are considerably colder, even experiencing snowfall in higher elevations.

**Packing Essentials for Staying Warm:**

Forget flimsy summer clothes! Pack strategically to combat the chill:

* **Layering is Key:** Think thermal underwear (base layer), cozy sweaters or fleece jackets (mid-layer), and a warm waterproof outer layer (jacket or coat).
* **Warm Socks & Hats:** Your extremities lose heat quickly.  Pack several pairs of warm socks (wool or merino are best) and a hat that covers your ears.
* **Gloves:** Even in milder areas, evenings can get chilly.  Gloves are essential.
* **Scarf:**  A large, soft scarf is wonderfully versatile – it can keep your neck warm, double as a head covering, or even be used as a blanket if needed.
* **Comfortable Walking Shoes:** You'll be doing a lot of walking.  Choose sturdy, waterproof shoes to protect your feet from the elements.

**Staying Warm in Your Accommodation:**

* **Check for Heating:**  While many riads and hotels offer heating, it's always a good idea to confirm beforehand, especially if you're traveling during the coldest months.
* **Embrace the Cozy:** Even if your accommodation has heating, extra layers in your room can make a big difference. Consider bringing a travel-sized electric blanket or a warm throw.

**Enjoying the Cooler Weather:**

The cooler months offer their own unique advantages:

* **Fewer Crowds:**  You'll experience many sites with fewer tourists, allowing for a more peaceful and immersive experience.
* **Pleasant Hiking Weather:** The cooler temperatures make hiking in the Atlas Mountains more comfortable.
* **Cozy Atmosphere:**  Snuggle up in a traditional riad, sipping mint tea by the fireplace, and revel in the charming atmosphere.


**Tips for Staying Warm on the Go:**

* **Drink warm beverages:**  Mint tea is a Moroccan staple, and hot drinks like coffee or herbal infusions can warm you from the inside out.
* **Eat warming foods:**  Enjoy traditional Moroccan tagines – hearty stews that will warm you up nicely.
* **Find shelter from the wind:**  Wind chill can make temperatures feel significantly colder. Seek shelter in cafes or shops when needed.

**Don't Forget:**  Even with preparation, some areas might be colder than expected. Be flexible, listen to your body, and adjust your plans as needed.


With a little planning, you can enjoy a comfortable and unforgettable trip to Morocco during the cooler months. So pack your warmest clothes, embrace the cozy atmosphere, and prepare to be captivated by the beauty of Morocco in autumn and winter.  Happy travels!

We have our third date planned for a few days from now, and there are a few things that I’ve been thinking about that I feel kind of anxious about going forward:

* for our first 2 dates, we met up at the date spot. But this time, I’ll be picking her up from her place. Should I knock on her door when I pick her up or text her when I’m there and wait in the car? On one hand I want to be considerate and walk her to the car from her door, but on the other hand she lives with family and I don’t know if she’d be comfortable with any of them meeting me at this point if any of them happen to open the door when I knock

* we haven’t kissed yet. We’ve hugged when greeting and parting ways both dates and locked arms during our walk on our second date, so the touch barrier has been broken, but we haven’t kissed. I don’t want to force it, but I also worry because I’ve heard that if you wait too long before kissing then the girl could lose interest. I also have never kissed anyone before, so I worry it could ruin things if our first kiss is bad because I don’t know what I’m doing. I also feel like I won’t be able to tell when a good time to go for it would be, or if she’s even ready to kiss yet.

The Langtang Trek is a perfect destination to discover the majesty Langtang Himalayas with unique Tamang culture with various landscapes. The path ahead promised an extraordinary journey through one of Nepal's third most popular trekking regions after[ Annapurna ](https://www.nepalhightrek.com/activities/7-days-annapurna-base-camp-trek/)and Everest. The Langtang Valley, often referred to as the ""Valley of Glaciers,"" beckoned with its pristine landscapes, rich Tamang cultural heritage, local yak cheese factories, and the allure of solitude.

My decision to tackle this trek solo was born from a desire for self-discovery and a yearning to connect with nature on a profound level. The Langtang region, less crowded than its famous counterparts like [Everest Base Camp](https://www.nepalhightrek.com/activities/everest-base-camp-trek/) or [Annapurna Circuit](https://www.nepalhightrek.com/activities/annapurna-circuit-trek/), offered the perfect backdrop for such an intimate adventure. As I took my first steps on the trail, I knew that the challenges and rewards that lay ahead would shape an unforgettable experience.

In this article, I'll share my journey through the [Langtang Valley Trek](https://www.nepalhightrek.com/activities/langtang-valley-trek/), offering insights, tips, and reflections for those considering their own solo expedition. From the practical aspects of preparation to the emotional highs and lows of solo trekking, I hope to paint a vivid picture of what awaits in this hidden gem of the Himalayas.

**Why Choose the Langtang Trek for Your Solo Journey**

The Langtang Trek stands out as an ideal choice for solo adventurers for several compelling reasons:

1. Accessibility: Located just north of Kathmandu, the trek is easily reachable, minimizing logistical challenges for solo travelers.
2. Diverse Landscapes: The trail offers an incredible variety of scenery, from lush forests to alpine meadows and glacial moraines.
3. Cultural Immersion: The route passes through traditional Tamang villages, providing unique opportunities for cultural exchange.
4. Moderate Difficulty: While challenging, the trek is manageable for those with a reasonable level of fitness, making it suitable for solo trekkers.
5. Less Crowded: Compared to more popular treks, Langtang offers a sense of solitude and tranquility.

For me, the decision to embark on the [Langtang Trek ](https://www.nepalhightrek.com/activities/langtang-trek/)solo was driven by a desire for introspection and personal growth. The relative quietude of the trail promised ample time for reflection, while the physical challenges would push me out of my comfort zone. Additionally, the tragic history of the region, which was severely affected by the 2015 earthquake, added a layer of poignancy to the journey, making it not just a trek, but a pilgrimage of sorts.

As I delved deeper into planning my solo Langtang adventure, I realized that this trek would offer a perfect balance of natural beauty, cultural richness, and personal challenge – all essential elements for a transformative solo experience in the mountains.

**Preparing for Your Solo Langtang Trek: Essential Tips and Gear**

Preparation is key when embarking on a solo trek, and the Langtang region demands careful planning. Here's a comprehensive guide to help you get ready:

**Physical Preparation**

1. Cardiovascular Training: I spent months building my endurance through regular hiking, running, and cycling.
2. Strength Training: Focus on leg and core exercises to prepare for steep ascents and descents.
3. Altitude Acclimatization: Consider arriving in Kathmandu a few days early to adjust to the elevation.

**Essential Gear**

* Backpack: A 40-50 liter pack is ideal for this trek.
* Trekking Boots: Well-worn, waterproof boots are crucial.
* Sleeping Bag: Rated for temperatures down to -10°C (14°F).
* Layers: Moisture-wicking base layers, insulating mid-layers, and a waterproof outer shell.
* Trekking Poles: Essential for stability on uneven terrain.
* Water Purification: Tablets or a filtration system.
* First Aid Kit: Include altitude sickness medication.
* Navigation Tools: Map, compass, and a GPS device.

**Documentation**

* Valid passport
* Trekking permit (obtainable in Kathmandu)
* Travel insurance covering high-altitude trekking

**Mental Preparation**

Solo trekking requires mental fortitude. I spent time meditating and visualizing potential challenges to build mental resilience. It's also crucial to inform someone of your itinerary and establish check-in points.

By meticulously preparing both physically and mentally, I felt confident in my ability to tackle the Langtang Trek solo. This preparation not only ensured my safety but also allowed me to fully immerse myself in the experience without unnecessary worries.

**Navigating the Langtang Trail: Route Overview and Highlights**

The Langtang Trek offers a diverse and captivating journey through the heart of the Himalayas. Here's an overview of the route and its key highlights:

**Day 1-2: Syabrubesi to Lama Hotel**

The trek begins in Syabrubesi, a small town accessible by bus from Kathmandu. The trail follows the Langtang Khola (river), winding through dense forests of rhododendron and bamboo. Wildlife sightings, including langur monkeys and colorful bird species, are common in this section.

**Day 3-4: Lama Hotel to Langtang Village**

As the trail ascends, the landscape transforms dramatically. The dense forests give way to open valleys, offering the first glimpses of snow-capped peaks. Langtang Village, once devastated by the 2015 earthquake, has been rebuilt and stands as a testament to the resilience of the local community.

**Day 5: Kyanjin Gompa**

This Buddhist monastery serves as a cultural and spiritual center of the region. The panoramic views of Langtang Lirung (7,227m) and surrounding peaks are breathtaking. I spent an extra day here for acclimatization and to explore the nearby glaciers and yak pastures.

**Day 6-7: Optional Side Treks**

* Tserko Ri (5,033m): A challenging day hike offering 360-degree views of the Langtang range.
* Kyanjin Ri (4,773m): A shorter but equally rewarding ascent with stunning vistas.

**Day 8-10: Return Journey**

The return follows the same route, but with fresh perspectives and descending terrain. This allows for a deeper appreciation of previously passed landscapes and more opportunities for cultural interactions in the villages.

Throughout the trek, I was constantly amazed by the ever-changing scenery. From the lush lower valleys to the stark beauty of the high-altitude landscapes, each day brought new wonders. The trail itself varies from well-trodden paths to more rugged sections, especially at higher elevations. Navigating solo required constant attention and regular map checks, but the sense of accomplishment at each milestone was unparalleled.

**Challenges of Solo Trekking in Langtang: What to Expect**

Embarking on the [short 5 days Langtang Trek](https://www.nepalhightrek.com/activities/short-langtang-trek-5-days/) solo presented a unique set of challenges that tested my physical endurance, mental resilience, and problem-solving skills. Here's what I encountered and how I navigated these obstacles:

**Physical Demands**

The trek involves long days of walking, often 6-8 hours, over varied terrain. Steep ascents and descents were particularly taxing, especially when carrying a full pack. To manage this:

* I paced myself, taking frequent short breaks.
* Proper hydration and nutrition were crucial; I always carried energy-dense snacks.
* Regular stretching in the evenings helped prevent muscle soreness.

**Altitude Sickness**

As the trek reaches elevations over 3,500 meters, altitude sickness becomes a real concern. Symptoms like headaches and nausea can be debilitating. My strategy included:

* Gradual ascent, never increasing sleeping altitude by more than 500 meters per day.
* Staying well-hydrated and avoiding alcohol.
* Carrying and knowing when to use altitude sickness medication.

**Navigation and Trail Finding**

While the main trail is generally well-marked, there were instances where the path became less clear, especially after rain or in areas affected by landslides. I relied on:

* A detailed topographic map and compass.
* GPS device with pre-loaded waypoints.
* Asking local villagers for directions when in doubt.

**Psychological Challenges**

The solitude of solo trekking can be both a blessing and a curse. There were moments of loneliness and self-doubt, particularly during difficult sections of the trail. To cope:

* I maintained a journal, writing daily reflections.
* Practiced mindfulness and meditation techniques.
* Engaged with other trekkers and locals when the opportunity arose, balancing solitude with social interaction.

**Weather Unpredictability**

Mountain weather can change rapidly, posing risks of hypothermia or heat exhaustion. I prepared by:

* Checking weather forecasts regularly.
* Carrying appropriate gear for all conditions.
* Being willing to adjust my itinerary when necessary for safety.

L**anguage Barrier**

While many locals in the trekking regions speak some English, communication can still be challenging. I found it helpful to:

* Learn basic Nepali phrases for greetings and emergencies.
* Use a translation app (downloaded for offline use).
* Rely on non-verbal communication and patience in interactions.

Facing these challenges solo was daunting at times, but each obstacle overcome added to the sense of achievement and personal growth. The key was to stay flexible, maintain a positive attitude, and always prioritize safety over sticking rigidly to plans.

**The Rewards of Going Solo: Personal Growth and Self-Discovery**

Embarking on the Langtang Trek alone proved to be an incredibly rewarding experience, offering profound opportunities for personal growth and self-discovery. As I navigated the trails and challenges independently, I found myself evolving in ways I hadn't anticipated:

**Enhanced Self-Reliance**

Being solely responsible for my journey forced me to trust my instincts and capabilities. From making critical decisions about route-finding to managing my resources, every aspect of the trek reinforced my self-reliance. This newfound confidence extended beyond the trail, influencing my approach to challenges in everyday life.

**Deeper Connection with Nature**

Without the distractions of companionship, I found myself more attuned to the natural world around me. The solitude allowed for moments of profound connection with the landscape:

* Observing the subtle changes in vegetation as I ascended.
* Listening to the symphony of mountain streams and birdsong.
* Witnessing breathtaking sunrises in silent awe.

**Mindfulness and Present-Moment Awareness**

Solo trekking naturally lends itself to mindfulness. With each step, I became more aware of my breath, the sensation of my feet on the trail, and the ever-changing environment. This heightened state of presence brought a sense of peace and clarity that was deeply rejuvenating.

**Overcoming Mental Barriers**

Facing fears and doubts alone pushed me to develop mental resilience. Whether it was crossing a precarious bridge or pushing through physical exhaustion, each challenge conquered built my mental strength. I learned to quiet the voice of self-doubt and tap into reserves of courage I didn't know I possessed.

**Cultural Immersion and Personal Interactions**

Traveling solo often made me more approachable to locals. Without the buffer of companions, I found myself engaging more deeply with the Tamang communities along the trail. These interactions led to:

* Invitations to share meals with local families.
* Impromptu language exchanges and cultural lessons.
* A more nuanced understanding of the region's history and customs.

**Self-Reflection and Clarity**

The long hours of solitary walking provided ample time for introspection. I found clarity on personal and professional goals, worked through long-standing emotional issues, and gained new perspectives on my life's direction. The mountains seemed to strip away the non-essential, leaving me with a clearer sense of purpose.

**Appreciation for Simplicity**

Living out of a backpack for days on end taught me the value of simplicity. I realized how little I needed to be content, leading to a reevaluation of my priorities and consumption habits back home.

**Boost in Problem-Solving Skills**

Every challenge faced alone – from navigating unclear trails to managing unexpected weather – honed my problem-solving abilities. This increased adaptability and resourcefulness has proven invaluable in various aspects of my life since returning.

The rewards of solo trekking in Langtang extended far beyond the physical accomplishment. The journey became a catalyst for personal transformation, offering lessons and insights that continue to shape my worldview long after leaving the mountains. While the challenges were real, the growth and self-discovery made every difficult moment worthwhile.

**Breathtaking Vistas: Must-See Spots Along the Langtang Trek**

The Langtang Trek is renowned for its stunning landscapes and panoramic views. As a solo trekker, I had the luxury of taking my time to fully appreciate these vistas. Here are some of the most awe-inspiring spots I encountered along the way:

**1. Kyanjin Ri Viewpoint (4,380m)**

This viewpoint near Kyanjin Gompa offers a 360-degree panorama of the Langtang range. The relatively easy ascent makes it accessible for most trekkers:

* Best time for views: Early morning for clear skies and golden light on the peaks.
* Visible peaks: Langtang Lirung, Kimshung, and Yansa Tsenji.

2. **Tserko Ri (5,033m)**

A more challenging day hike from Kyanjin Gompa, but the views are unparalleled:

* Panoramic views of Langtang Lirung, Langtang II, and Yala Peak.
* Glimpses of Shishapangma in Tibet on clear days.
* Start early to avoid afternoon clouds and allow plenty of time for the ascent.

3. **Langtang Lirung Viewpoint**

Located just above Langtang Village, this spot offers a close-up view of Langtang Lirung's imposing north face:

* Best visited in the late afternoon for dramatic light on the mountain.
* A poignant place to reflect on the 2015 earthquake's impact on the region.

4. Gosainkunda Lakes (4,300m)

While technically part of an extended version of the trek, these sacred alpine lakes are worth the detour:

* Stunning reflections of surrounding peaks in the calm waters.
* Rich in Hindu and Buddhist mythology.
* Requires an additional 2-3 days from the main Langtang trail.

5. Cherko Valley

A lesser-known side trip from the main trail, offering solitude and raw natural beauty:

* Pristine alpine meadows dotted with grazing yaks.
* Views of glaciers descending from Langtang Lirung.
* Ideal for those seeking off-the-beaten-path experiences.

6. Langtang Glacier Viewpoint

Accessible from Kyanjin Gompa, this spot provides a close-up view of the Langtang Glacier:

* Witness the raw power of glacial movement.
* Best visited in the morning when the ice gleams in the sunlight.
* Listen for the occasional rumble of distant avalanches.

7. Numthang

A high point on the trail between Lama Hotel and Langtang Village:

* First clear views of the Langtang range emerge from the forested hills.
* A perfect spot for a lunch break and photo opportunities.

8. Briddhim Village Viewpoint

If taking the Tamang Heritage Trail extension:

* Panoramic views of terraced fields and distant peaks.
* Insight into traditional Tamang architecture and lifestyle.

Each of these locations offered not just stunning views, but moments of profound connection with the landscape. As a solo trekker, I found myself lingering at these spots, absorbing the beauty and grandeur of the Himalayas. The solitude allowed for a deeper appreciation of the vistas, turning each viewpoint into a personal meditation on nature's magnificence.

Cultural Encounters: Interacting with Local Communities

One of the most enriching aspects of my solo [Langtang Tamang Heritage Trek](https://www.nepalhightrek.com/activities/langtang-tamang-heritage-trek/) was the opportunity to engage with the local Tamang and Sherpa communities. These interactions provided deep insights into the region's culture, traditions, and way of life. Here's a glimpse into my cultural encounters along the trail:

Tamang Heritage Trail

The Langtang region is predominantly inhabited by Tamang people, known for their rich cultural heritage:

* Traditional architecture: I observed unique house designs with intricate woodcarvings.
* Colorful attire: Women often wore vibrant, handwoven clothes and distinctive jewelry.
* Language: Learning a few Tamang phrases helped break the ice in many interactions.

Buddhist Influence

**Buddhism plays a central role in the local culture:**

* Prayer wheels and mani walls lined the trails, offering opportunities for reflection.
* Monasteries, like Kyanjin Gompa, provided insights into local spiritual practices.
* I was fortunate to witness a Buddhist ceremony, a mesmerizing display of chants and rituals.

Local Diverse Cuisine

Sharing meals with locals offered a taste of authentic Himalayan cuisine:

* Dal Bhat: The staple meal of lentils and rice, often served with local vegetables.
* Tsampa: Roasted barley flour, a traditional high-energy food.
* Yak cheese: A local delicacy, rich in flavor and nutrition.

Homestay Experiences

Opting for homestays in villages like Langtang and Briddhim provided intimate glimpses into daily life:

* Participating in household chores like collecting firewood.
* Learning traditional cooking methods from host families.
* Evening conversations around the hearth, sharing stories and laughter.

Festivals and Celebrations

Timing my trek with local festivals added an extra layer of cultural immersion:

* Witnessing the vibrant Lhosar (Tibetan New Year) celebrations in a mountain village.
* Observing how ancient traditions blend with modern influences in these remote areas.

Economic Realities

Interactions with locals provided insights into the economic challenges and opportunities in the region:

* The impact of tourism on traditional livelihoods.
* Efforts to rebuild and revitalize the area post-2015 earthquake.
* Sustainable tourism initiatives led by community members.

Sherpa Culture

While less prevalent than in the Everest region, Sherpa influence is still noticeable:

* Learning about their legendary mountaineering skills and contributions.
* Understanding the spiritual significance they attribute to the mountains.

Language and Communication

Despite language barriers, I found numerous ways to connect:

* Using basic Nepali phrases learned before the trek.
* Relying on universal gestures and expressions.
* Sharing photographs and small gifts as conversation starters.

Traditional Crafts

Observing and participating in local crafts offered hands-on cultural experiences:

* Watching the intricate process of Tibetan carpet weaving.
* Learning about the significance of prayer flags and helping to hang them.

These cultural encounters were often spontaneous and always memorable. As a solo traveler, I found myself more open to these experiences, often being invited into homes or included in local activities. These interactions not only enriched my trek but also fostered a deep respect and admiration for the resilience and warmth of the mountain communities.

The cultural dimension of the Langtang Trek transformed it from a mere physical journey into a profound human experience, leaving me with lasting memories and a greater understanding of life in the Himalayas.

Safety Considerations for Solo Trekkers in Langtang

Embarking on a solo trek in the Langtang region requires careful attention to safety. While the experience can be incredibly rewarding, it's crucial to be prepared for the unique challenges that come with trekking alone in a remote mountain environment. Here are key safety considerations I adhered to during my journey:

[Stunning Langtang Himalayas](https://preview.redd.it/is0pmsn0thfe1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=44a4e33779c8d40a12620530ac23d11ce1acc96c)

1. Proper Acclimatization

Altitude sickness is a serious risk in Langtang:

* Follow the ""climb high, sleep low"" principle.
* Ascend no more than 300-500 meters per day in sleeping altitude.
* Include rest days for acclimatization, especially at Kyanjin Gompa.

2. Communication Devices

Staying connected is crucial when trekking solo:

* Carry a satellite phone or personal locator beacon for emergencies.
* Invest in a local SIM card for areas with cell coverage.
* Inform someone of your daily plans and check in regularly.

3. Weather Awareness

Mountain weather can be unpredictable and potentially dangerous:

* Check weather forecasts regularly.
* Be prepared to alter your plans if conditions deteriorate.
* Understand signs of approaching storms or dangerous weather patterns.

4. Trail Navigation

Getting lost is a significant risk for solo trekkers:

* Carry detailed maps and a compass, and know how to use them.
* Use a GPS device with pre-loaded waypoints.
* Stick to marked trails and avoid shortcuts.

5. Health and First Aid

Being prepared for medical emergencies is crucial:

* Carry a comprehensive first aid kit and know how to use it.
* Include medication for altitude sickness, diarrhea, and other common ailments.
* Consider taking a wilderness first aid course before the trek.

6. Water Safety

Waterborne illnesses can derail your trek:

* Always purify water, even if it looks clean.
* Carry water purification tablets or a reliable filtration system.
* Avoid drinking untreated water from streams or taps.

7. Physical Preparation

Being in good physical condition reduces the risk of injury:

* Train adequately before the trek, focusing on cardio and strength.
* Know your limits and don't push too hard, especially when alone.
* Use trekking poles to reduce strain on knees and improve balance.

8. Wildlife Awareness

While rare, wildlife encounters can occur:

* Make noise while trekking to avoid surprising animals.
* Know how to react if you encounter wildlife like bears or leopards.
* Never feed or approach wild animals.

9. Cultural Sensitivity

Respecting local customs ensures positive interactions:

* Dress modestly and behave respectfully in villages and religious sites.
* Ask permission before taking photographs of people or religious objects.
* Learn basic Nepali or Tamang phrases to communicate with locals.

10. Insurance and Documentation

Proper documentation can be lifesaving in emergencies:

* Obtain comprehensive travel insurance that covers high-altitude trekking and helicopter evacuation.
* Carry copies of important documents (passport, permits, insurance) separately from originals.
* Register with your embassy or consulate before the trek.

11. Trust Your Instincts

As a solo trekker, your judgment is your best safety tool:

* If a situation feels unsafe, trust your gut and err on the side of caution.
* Don't hesitate to turn back or seek help if you're unsure about conditions or your ability to continue safely.

By adhering to these safety considerations, I was able to enjoy the solitude and beauty of the Langtang Trek while minimizing risks. Remember, there's no shame in being overly cautious when trekking solo – your safety should always be the top priority.

Accommodation and Food Options on the Langtang Trail

The Langtang Trek offers a variety of accommodation and dining options, ranging from basic teahouses to more comfortable lodges. As a solo trekker, I found these facilities not only provided essential services but also opportunities for cultural exchange and meeting fellow trekkers. Here's an overview of what to expect:

Accommodation Types

1. Teahouses Most common form of accommodation along the trail. Basic rooms with twin beds and shared bathrooms. Prices range from 200-500 NPR per night (as of my trek). Often include communal dining areas where trekkers gather.
2. Lodges Found in larger villages like Langtang and Kyanjin Gompa. Slightly more comfortable than teahouses, some with attached bathrooms. Prices typically between 500-1000 NPR per night.
3. Homestays Available in some villages, offering a more authentic local experience. Basic accommodations but rich in cultural immersion. Similar pricing to teahouses, sometimes including meals.
4. Camping Less common but possible for those carrying their own gear. Requires more planning and preparation. Offers maximum flexibility and solitude.

Food Options

1. Teahouse Menus Dal Bhat (lentils and rice): The staple trekking food, often with unlimited refills. Momos (dumplings): Available in vegetarian and meat varieties. Thukpa (noodle soup): Warming and nutritious. Sherpa stew: Hearty vegetable soup. Western options: Pasta, pizza, and pancakes are common.
2. Breakfast Choices Tibetan bread with jam or honey. Porridge or muesli. Eggs prepared in various styles. Pancakes or chapati.
3. Beverages Tea: Black, milk, lemon, or the famous ginger tea. Coffee: Instant coffee widely available, some places offer French press. Hot lemon: Popular for hydration and vitamin C. Alcoholic drinks: Beer and local spirits available in some locations.
4. Snacks and Trail Food Energy bars and chocolates: Available but expensive. Dried fruits and nuts: Good to bring from Kathmandu. Boiled eggs and potatoes: Often sold by locals along the trail.

Tips for Solo Trekkers

* Book Ahead: During peak seasons, it's wise to have your guide or porter (if you have one) call ahead to secure accommodation.
* Eating Schedule: Most teahouses serve breakfast (6-8 AM), lunch (11 AM-1 PM), and dinner (6-8 PM). Plan your trekking day accordingly.
* Water: Bottled water is available but expensive and environmentally unfriendly. Use water purification methods instead.
* Special Diets: Vegetarian options are plentiful, but vegan or gluten-free diets may be challenging. Communicate your needs clearly.
* Hygiene: Carry hand sanitizer and be cautious with uncooked foods to avoid stomach issues.
* Social Opportunities: Dining areas in teahouses are great places to meet other trekkers and share experiences.

Seasonal Variations

* Spring and Autumn: Fuller menus and more accommodation options due to higher trekker numbers.
* Winter: Some teahouses may close, and menu options might be limited.
* Monsoon: Fewer trekkers mean more personal attention but potentially limited services.

As a solo trekker, I found the teahouse system in Langtang to be convenient and social. The simplicity of the accommodations and the hearty, no-frills meals perfectly complemented the trekking experience. Each night in a different teahouse brought new conversations, local insights, and a deeper appreciation for the hospitality of the mountain communities.

1ib2xd7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cavesofqud/comments/1ib2xd7/macro_for_filling_a_map_with_bullets_for_warm/,Macro for filling a map with bullets for Warm Static,"In case you dont know, if you pour warm static onto an empty space on a map, it will randomize all items on the map with a low percent chance.

So I wrote a full macro that fills up the whole map with bullets with a single press of F6 over the course of around 10 minutes. Your character walks in a snake across the map using the throw function to place bullets (you need to put some type of ammo in the throw slot.) It leaves the bottom right square of the map open so you can go to the map to your right, and pour left across the border with a left arrow key press.

HOW TO USE:  
F6 (Full Map): Stand one below the top left corner of a salt dune and press F6  
F7 (Single Row): Stand one space to the right of the left-edge of the row and press F7  
Both functions are TOGGLEABLE, if you press the key again, it will stop

REQ:  
AutoHotkey program

VERY IMPORTANT NOTES:  
The Macro is actually very simple, its snakes you around, throwing the bullets above you, and switching it  to throwing to the side of you for the last row so you dont leave the map.  
HOWEVER, while the Macro does exactly what its suppost to, it most likely will not 100% work depending on your PC, this is a macro not a mod, all it does is press keys. So if you are like me, and your game has even a half second of stuttering every once in a while when traders refresh or something similar, the keys will press during the stutter and mess up the chain.

All this means is you need to press F6 again to stop the macro, fix the messy row by manually throwing some bullets, and then just start it again below the last completed row. This situation is why F7 exists, so when you get to the bottom row of the screen after the F6 Macro bugged at some point, you can fill in the bottom row with F7. I have to press F6 and fix rows around 4 times.

If you want this to be ""true afk"" all you need to do is to make the delays between inputs longer, significantly slowing the process, but creating enough delay to hopefully skip over lag. The delays are defined by dir\_speed and throw\_speed, at default they are 50 milliseconds and 200 milliseconds.

If you want to actually leave the pc and make some coffee or something, you can clear the adjacent 8 maps, set these milliseconds higher depending on your PC, and go about your day. As long as those 8 maps are clear, the macro autostops before you enter somewhere you havent explored, even if it still bugs out, making coffee safe.

Also please dont toggle both F6 and F7 keys at the same time, I actually dont know what happens if you do that.

HOW TO GET IT:  
I will indeed not put in a download link, sketchy and all that, Ill just put the Macro Code in the post. You need AutoHotkey which allows you to create .ahk files and run them, then you just paste the code in Notepad on a new AHK file you make. When you run it you can turn it off in the toolbox or little up arrow at the bottom right of your desktop.

1ib2vbc,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodieSnark/comments/1ib2vbc/a_response_to_can_we_talk_about_steakandbuttergal/,A response to “Can we talk about steakandbuttergal?  Let’s!,"Well I certainly appreciate the fact that you recognize as you put it “not one-size-fits-all” ~
so let’s dig into her content. 
Is the carnivore diet dangerous? Then we should see people getting sick and dying from it. 
Is “the standard American diet” dangerous?; yes ~because we are seeing people getting sick and dying from it. Dying all around us. Sick fat diseased obese inflamed unhappy depressed~ hopeless. 
(That’s the most often used word that comes up in carnivore diet testimonies—“hopeless“.)
I have increasingly seen it for the last half century. wasn't like this in the 1950s!
If her way of eating (this carnivore diet) has a mountain of what is called “anecdotal evidence” then it cannot be refuted for we/you cannot discount other people’s experiences because it’s their experience not your experience thus proving again that “not one size fits all”~bingo!
So next let’s take a look at what you say about her eating sticks of butter as a snack…. Once again she absolutely LOVES it, it might make you gag but shouldn’t we say Viva le difference? 
As I understand it steakandbuttergal is what is called a “high fat carnivore”. 
Butter is total fat so at least she’s consistent. 
Then in regards to eggs even doctors tell us “Eggs are the perfect food”!
But then haven’t we all noticed one expert saying one thing then it’s contradicted 100% by another so-called “expert“ saying the complete opposite?
 Haven’t we watched them bounce off the walls for 50 years!? I have. 
I now don’t believe a word Western medicine says.  I don’t believe a word of what “the experts” say. I don’t believe a word that I hear on the internet pretty much anymore but I WILL BELIEVE people telling their personal experiences.  Testimonials.
So if she wants to eat steak and butter that’s fine by me. 
Finally when I went to investigate the carnivore diet I listened to a good 3-4 dozen videos from all different kinds of people starting with SABG, Dr. Ken Berry and all the rest of the gang all the top-notch guys (all they’re doing is telling their personal experiences) Nobody else has to do it, you don’t have to do it. 
But eating steak all the time certainly was not an idea that “made me gag”. I was absolutely thrilled! 
I thought it was very odd that she ate butter but I just tucked it in the back of my mind thinking “Nope. That’s not me. I’m not gonna be doing that.” 
That’s OK. 
But steak? Check. Lamb chops? Check.  Eggs? Check. Cheese limited dairy products yogurt is also allowed? Check. 
 “Heck I can do this” I thought! 
So I took Ken Berry’s challenge that “Everyone should try it for 90 days.” 
Here is my carnivore diet testimony: 
It seemed like overnight I dropped 20 pounds. When I started I looked 8-9 months pregnant and I looked down and my gut had just dropped off. Fell off! Then I got my first big miracle~ 42 years of migraines– gone! Eight years of horrific rhinitis-gone! All brain fog and memory issues – gone! 
All within about the first 4-6 weeks but seemingly overnight. I’ve been on it now for about five months and in fact my memory/ recall astonishes me all the time. 
I have to give Lion’s Mane some of the credit for that. I had been putting that in my coffee for some time.
A huge surprise is that I’m sleeping better.  I’m sleeping deeply now and I wake up happy. That is a shock for many people ~you will hear a lot of testimonies about depression being completely CURED by the carnivore diet. And it’s not about restrictions it’s more the concept of eliminating things that are not helping me that are not healthy or good for me that are perhaps an addiction (I thought about food all day). Thought about all the tons of ingredients I needed for this new gourmet recipe I cooked all the time was increasingly making gourmet meals FOR ONE ~it was just getting to be such a burden!
Food food food. And the more I ate the more I wanted sugar. Every night 11:30 at night ravenously hungry. Got a bowl of cereal~ didn’t matter if it was “good” stuff.  
I am a carboholic ~all I wanted was coffee and almond chocolate croissants from Nugget! Have you seen their desserts!?
Now I just wake up happy. I haven’t weighed in the 140s since 2000! Now I’m on track to dropping probably another 30 pounds because I have a tiny frame from being sick as a child and I was 98 pounds my entire adult life clean into the middle of my second pregnancy! I can hardly wait to be a Size 5 again. Ladies!
But I wanna go back to this thing about being happy because Western meds “pills” don’t cure anybody's anything! Everything’s a lateral move>there’s always side effects and you’re gonna be taking more and more pills and that’s why the elderly wind up with 30 pills on their bedside tray.  Sicker than ever! 
But the carnivore diet DOES cure stuff and it’s being verified every single day all day the reports are pouring in. Diabetes is a big one. Tons of reports pouring in about that being cured. I think it’s Scriptural! Because God said I will give them the herbs for the healing of the nations” Food is medicine~ we’ve known that for a long time. Haven’t we?
So as far as being happy because I’m a Christian I wasn’t doing all that bad before but I wake up REALLY happy now! 
Who wouldn’t love that?  In other words I have seen testimony after testimony of it curing depression; after what this country has been through are you kidding me!?~ that’s huge!  It’s curing depression,  carnivores are super super happy today and it’s not just because of Trump~it’s the carnivore diet!
People are doing it because it works.  People are doing it because it’s delicious! People are doing it because it makes them happy! Isn't it sort of the Atkins diet on steroids? Dr. Acton saved a lot of people's lives!
And now let’s get back to that disgusting stick of butter. The first time I did that~ MEH.  Then I was watching  another video by steakandbuttergal and she was talking about those sticks of butter ….and so I went and tried it again but this time I smashed it up against the roof of my mouth and this incredible melting delicious yummy sensation flooded my whole mouth & it was like my brain went WHOA!!!  It was SO good. 
In fact I just had some (all it takes is about what you would consider a pat of butter at a restaurant.)

Like I said I just had some – and then I saw your post! Ta-da!!!

My fiancé and I have been having issues, since he lost his job he’s been drinking so much, barely home. Just not there at all.

So naturally I ask him, he immediately gets in my face, yelling at me, threatening me for snooping when I literally didn’t touch his iPad. He kept claiming, “oh it’s spam, it’s a fake message”

I literally saw the fucking follow up texts pop up, with his name… her name. I mean. It’s not spam, I’m not a moron… but am I atleast safe to go home?

>The cost-of-living survey, which was conducted on 1,074 respondents in July 2024, found 37 per cent said they would be unable to cover an unexpected $500 bill without either borrowing, selling assets or using a form of credit.

I understand that Dutch don't like credit cards and there's not many offers of them available, so how would typical Dutch person handle situation of unexpected expenses where Australian, American or Canadian would just reach for credit card?

Are Dutch savings oriented society and have large saving squirreled in banks and mattresses? I'm sort of doubtful about that, considering that your government thinks 57K savings is a wealth that need be taxed.

I'm fairly new to mini painting. I've done a few in the past, but I got a new paint set that requires dilution with water, and I've never had to do that before. My husband also gifted me (in addition to the paint) brand new brushes, and entire mystery pack of minis, and entire mini sets to build and paint to support growing hobby. Now, as far as campaigns go, I'm running CoS and while this mini is not involved, he was my first bigger one and I wanted to practice on him before I tackled any more PC minis. My husband's turned out fine, but...I think I could have done better. 

This is my take on Polyphemus, specifically from the Hercules animated film! (Also, if there are any Epic fans in here, the entire time I was painting him, ""POLY-PHEMUS"" was on repeat in my head 😂)

I have a sleep disorder and have been running on fumes since New Year, headaches every day, drowsy etc.

My anxiety has been through the roof so I stopped drinking coffee, I moved onto green tea but now even that gives me horrible jitters and irrational thoughts.

I haven't slept for the last 2-3 days. I'm quitting caffeine all together as of today and will get my sleep back at some point. I'm wondering if it's safe/advisable to take the L Theanine at 1000mg twice a day?

I took one earlier and didn't really feel anything but I do feel better than I normally would given the fact I've been awake for roughly 72 hours.

I'm thinking take another after my evening meal, watch a movie and try to relax. Afte that, keep it at twice per day. Thoughts?

My only goal was to be consistent. I did 16:09 fasting, ate whatever I wanted in my eating window, and also started hitting the gym for 3 days a week. Previously I was addicted to chai ( milk tea with ginger/cardamom and a teaspoon of sugar) and used to drink it 5-6 times a day. When I started IF, I switched to black coffee and I was so proud of myself that I was sticking to it. My tea intake reduced to 2 cups that too during the eating window. However, a week ago I had acute pharyngitis (inflammation of throat) and put a stop to IF in order to recover. The tea soothed my throat so I had quite a bit. And now, I am trying to get back to IF but cant stop craving it. I somehow could complete 14:09 but I know I can do more. I did it previously. How can I go back on track? I am feeling disappointed and demotivated. Please help!",1,1737963071.0,intermittentfastwomen,0,1.0,False

A lot of people have said why and I get a bunch of different reasons. Saying not because of their looks but they don't like black women because they use you for snacks and money, getting their nails done, hair done and seeing other guys while they're doing all of this, meanwhile white and asian girls will be down to get a cup of coffee, pay for things themselves, do their hair at home (but tbf as a mixed/black person with curly hair I think they should pay for it to get done themselves, but give them a pass as most races that aren't black have straight hair and that is a commitment you should be willing to make when dating someone like that.), buy you some lunch after a hard day at work, etc. some people say that black women are ugly (it's mainly racist people who say that I don't hear a lot of people say that, mainly the first one) And honestly I kind of agree with the first point I stated. As a poc black not all of us are like that, however a lot of us are. I've firsthand seen BLACK girls use other people for personal gain, talking about others, bullying people, and overall doing things that ruin our reputation. (Also influenced by rap music iykwim) Mean while, whites and asians aren't seen doing that, not even hispanics do that unless provoked. So why do you guys hesitate to dating black girls?

1ib2le9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ib2le9/wibtah_if_i_skipped_my_husbands_family_gathering/,WIBTAH if I skipped my husband’s family gathering?,"My husband and I got married in July 2024, after dating for the last 5 years. 

A bit of backstory before the issue:
We had a destination elopement, no wedding, except a small celebration with friends. I personally have always wanted to elope because I really dislike being the center of attention, it makes me uncomfortable. I don’t celebrate my birthday either for this specific reason. I prefer a small, calm celebration with just my husband, or either my close family, like literally just a 1 hour cake and coffee type situation. But I do like gathering/weddings/parties that do not revolve around me.

Now to the issue:
My MIL mentioned a few days ago that they are planning to have a family reunion type thing to celebrate what would have been her late father’s (husband’s grandad) 100th birthday. In the country where I come from, it is normal to celebrate the life of a late close relative on death anniversaries or what would have been big birthdays. I did attend my husband’s grandmother’s 10 year death celebration of life gathering. 

When my MIL was talking about her plans for the gathering, which will be this coming June, she said she will be INTRODUCING ME to the extended family. For context, my own husband does not know some of these distant family members.. her plan is to place me in-front of all the people who will be there for the introduction as their new daughter in law. 

I would be fine with this if we went to the gathering and my husband would just introduce me to family members that have not met me. The rest of his extended family like closer cousins, aunts and uncles all know me and know that we got married and congratulated us etc., so i really don’t understand this whole “standing on a stage like a trophy” type introduction, especially not at a celebration that is supposed to be for their late family member. 

I told my husband that I would prefer if this “introduction” would not happen. He says to just do it for his mom to make her happy, and that he has gone to my family’s reunions, birthdays etc., and that now it’s my turn. However, at my family’s gatherings, he has never been held up by the armpits like in Lion King to be displayed to everyone, so I don’t think what he is saying is fair. I also have never skipped any celebration held by his family anyway… 

I am seriously considering to make up plans to skip this.. i feel bad, but at the same time, I can’t imagine being there being introduced in such a way. It gives me so much anxiety just thinking about it. 

Any suggestions?

I will be at a conference in SFO in May and would like to add about a week to make the trip from Europe worth it. I can only add time before the conference.

I am thinking to either fly in to San Diego or Seattle. I am aware the weather might not be the best (especially north of SFO), but I don't mind if it's not absolute perfection (just consistent storms / snow / rain would be a bummer; cold is fine).

San Diego makes sense as the weather might be better and I have friends along the coast to visit and show me around (I have been to SBA before and usually drove from LA airport; I've also done LV>SLC). I am aware of the fires and trouble with landslides on the coastal road, so I want to 100% respect the locals here and stay away if preferred.

The path from Seattle however seems more exciting landscape-wise and as if I could find some less touristy and hidden gems.

I also heard great stuff about Lake Tahoe, but I assume I don't wanna risk snow / closed passes.

My priority is getting to know locals, finding some nice coffee shops and view points, maybe small hikes (as I'll be travelling alone and as a woman, nothing too crazy) and guided adventures.

Thanks for any replies and inspiration! 🤗",1,1737962960.0,roadtrip,1,1.0,False

Never been there, obviously it’s a pretty long distance from the 49th State but we are ready to explore something new! We are coming for ya for 2 weeks in May!

We likely will rent an Airbnb and try to blend in with the locals. Looking for a spot that is laid back with most access to beach and pools for the kids, running trails or opportunities for the husband, and a nice coffee spot for myself. Some people have suggested Destin or northern gulf area but it’s much easier for us to fly into Tampa/Orlando/Miami since we are coming in from Alaska. What do you think my Floridians????

1ib2kic,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1ib2kic/can_we_talk/,Can we talk?,"Dear a now stranger,

I did and sent a lot of things out of anger. Even before doing so I had told a friend that I was aware my actions were petty and childish, but I still wanted to do them because I ""didn't care anymore"" and was pissed off. But now that I'm not angry anymore, I'm just kind of sad.

Is this really how everything ends? Will we both be too prideful to reach out first? Will everything fade into oblivion? I would normally reach out now and apologize for my rash actions, but the last thing I sent has remained unresponded to. I don't know if that is also out of anger or you genuinely hate me and never want to speak to me again. I wouldn't want to bother you again if it was the latter.

So I let every day pass without giving it too much thought, but if it gets quiet enough my thoughts begin to linger. I don't know what the right thing to do is in this situation, so I sit idly by with increasing unease. This isn't a text because I'm pretty sure you are just completely done with my shit. But if it is a prideful silent standoff...can we talk? I really just want to sit down and talk. I don't know about what, but it can't end like this. Not about dating or relationships at all, but whether we will even acknowledge each other exists. This can't be the way it was supposed to go down, none of this feels right at all.

Please reach out, I miss you. Maybe we can have a normal chat over coffee? I don't know. These past few months gave so few windows of proper communication that I fear misunderstanding has piled on top of misunderstanding and ruined a friendship I truly would have loved to maintain.

I guess I lied when I said it was my last letter,

1ib2k8u,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlienStage/comments/1ib2k8u/ivantill_overshadowing_mizisua_isnt_because_of/,Ivantill Overshadowing Mizisua Isn't Because of Misogyny,"So I keep seeing the same stuff about people being confused why Mizisua isn't as popular and blaming fujoshi's or people just being misogynistic which yeah definitely could play a part in it but it is NOT the main reason. It's a narrative structure that puts more focus on Ivantill than Mizisua.

So the first issue is the fact that Sua dies before we learn anything about her like we don't know her personality is besides liking Mizi. Sweet Dream the video isn't even focused on Sua rather just introducing the world, her singlular solo isn't focused on her at all. Like we had to wait for the mini episode to find out how they met but the only extension to Sua herself is she was sad as a kid. We don't know why she's sad. We can guess and headcanon but we don't know. We can guess Sua liked Mizi because Mizi made her happy but like... what does she love about her? And yeah Till loves Mizi for similiar reasons but the difference is his entire character is not reliant on simping for Mizi.

The only way you could get an inkling for Sua's deal is tracking down several patreon posts or scrolling back months and months of comics. But the main episodes never really indicate extra content exists at all. Like not even a mention in the credits about that so an average viewer isn't going to know that information hell i didn't know that! Like I only found out by joining this subreddit which only has a fraction of the fandom here. Like the videos get millions of views and the subreddit does not even have a 100k members. 

And because it's extra content it shouldn't count as necessary material especially when the creative team aren't actively encouraging their audience to look into it. This especially is difficult when you join the fandom later like i did after getting round 1 recommended to me a few weeks after the final round released. If i didn't have the pinned google doc on this subreddit there would be absolutely 0 way for me to know extra details. And even with the side material that expands Sua's personality a bit there's just not enough compared with the other character's, like Hyuna has more to her than Sua. Like the prime narrative issue I can point to is the fact Ivan's sacrifice loses a bit of the narrative weight and irony if you haven't read the stuff where he calls out Sua for planning to sacrifice herself. And this goes into my next arguement. 

Nobody besides Mizi gives a fuck about Sua. Like including the side material we know the main group all knew each other at the garden and were in relatively the same friend group. Sure Ivan and Sua hated each other but like a facepalm would've gone a long way visual storytellingwise and I assume Till the guy notorious for not being able to hide his emotions would react in some way. But no Sua doesn't matter until Luka shows up. And Round 5 isn't even fully about her and Mizi's relationship but rather it's Luka focused. Like Sua is used as a device to show Luka's personality and intelligence. Sure the psychological warfare on Mizi is hell and a good way to show Mizi's personality but again it kinda falls flat when their relationship is barely focused on/Sua no longer existing in the plot afterwards.

Mizi and Sua also suffer from the fact they both don't get as much focus as other character's. Like the most they get is Round 1. Round 2 is Till being a simp for Mizi but seeing how emotional and ruthlesss he can be to win. Round 3 showcases more worldbuilding and the past plus developing both Ivan and Till. Round 5 again has the spotlight mainly focused on Luka than the girls. All In is the Hyuna episode and we see more worldbuilding plus we see the origins of both her and Luka. Mizi gets slight development as a badass rebel but with her massive lack of focus it doesn't hit like it should. And Mizisua the episode i suppose they get something but again Sua still barely gets stuff and we don't learn anything new besides Sua was a sad child. Round 6 is the most dramatic and intense episode and its focused on Ivan and Till.  

Round 7 is I feel like the only episode so far where Mizi gets even focus as other character's for once and Sua doesn't count cause she's dead like Ivan. 

Then like we get into the fact of the lack of focus Mizi and Sua get means the only intense and striking moment they share together is Sua dying instantly. 

The other characters and their relationships also feel more like there was development because of the fact that time has actually affected their relationships. We see Ivan literally simping for Till for years on end. Till also simps for Mizi for years and it feels more intense than the canon relationship because he hallucinates seeing her again after believing she's dead and just experienced one of the most horrific traumas and we know it stemmed from childhood his affection that is. I've experienced that feeling of reaching out to one single person in my own darkest moments because when they are here everything feels like it will be ok. Hyuna and Luka started off as friends as kids but then Luka... was Luka but their connection with each other is still part of their lives. Like Hyuna looks horrified seeing Luka again and Luka is literally like ""What the fuck your not dead?!"" 

Don't get me wrong someone had to die in Round 1 in order to hook the audience after tricking them into thinking it's a happy show. It's just basic story set up the issue is i feel like they are attempting the trope of Sua haunting the narrative but it doesn't work if nobody else cares about her and the one person who does gets screwed over in focus. And that leads to fan content limitations.

So from what i remember in my early days of fandom canon couples back then got the least amount of attention because well there's cases of it being bland, badly written or the series had done everything with the canon couple already so what is there as a writer for you to explore? Like rewrites or AUs? It's actually a very recent thing in fandom spaces i've noticed where canon couples are now just starting to get the same amount of content. I'm not gonna theorize about that atm but again recent stuff. 

Mizisua just does not have enough content especially if you only look at the videos which is the majority of the fanbase. Then when you have the extra content combined with fandom flanderization you get a typical Sua who is just an aloof woman who needs coffee to function at her day job. Then your storytelling options are even more limited with the lack of content combined with them being canon. Like you literally just have AUs or making people cry with a picture you drew. 

Compared to everyone else but especially Ivantill there's just so much a fandom can extract. For Ivantill you hae the intense scenes and heartache that leave an impact on the audience's minds. Like Ivan has an even more dramatic death than Sua that makes you scream WHAT over and over. Then when he falls over your just left in silence. Plus the questions that are raised of what if. Like Till's face at the end it burned into my mind as well because Till had development before this and we knew his current mental state was not good. Like after all that having one of your friends pull that and then you realize oh my god I was in a love triangle? But it also makes the audience want Till to win because some people may hate Luka and the fact he deserves something good after that entire thing. 

There's also a secondary affect of Mizi barely singing outside Round 1 and My Clementis being very soft soundwise. 

And genuinely I feel like there was a missed opportunity on Mizi and Hyuna. Like they could've had a very interesting dynamic and stories whether official or fanmade could've been much more striking. Like rebel leader helps recruit another woman who also got screwed badly by the system. Hyuna literally brings Mizi out of her grief and helps her grow as a character. Plus them both hating Luka. There's also potential for either official or fanworks to see how Mizi would process her grief in that scenario would she feel guilty for falling in love with Hyuna?

It's sad to me Mizisua does get treated not the best in Alien Stage writing wise because they introduced us to this world and yet they both get the least amount of focus. Just like I want Mizisua to be equal in the focus as the others but it just isn't and I'm confused why I keep seeing the question of ""Why is Ivantill more popular"" and blaming other things instead of fully analyzing how the characters are presented in the narrative. Now your free to disagree in fact I welcome debate on this as long as we keep it respectful. 

Either way, I wrote this very long post that took an hour and a half and I'm ending it here.

His diet was clean, he was meditating 5-7 minutes daily, and he didn’t even have tea or coffee after lunch. He worked out regularly and slept 6-7 hours most nights. on paper, everything seemed fine, but he still didn’t feel better.

We thought his diet might need extra nutrients, so we made a few tweaks, but nothing changed. then, we adjusted his workouts, thinking he might be overdoing it, but still, no big results. Finally, we found the real issue—his mobile! every night, he would scroll on his phone or binge Netflix right before bed. Even though he was in bed by 11, his mind wasn’t relaxing.

We suggested one simple fix: no phone or screens for one hour before bed. He started reading instead and kept his phone outside the bedroom. Within weeks, his sleep got better, his energy came back, and he finally started feeling happier and more focused.

*Here is the science:*

Good sleep helps clean our brains, heal the body, and balance hormones. If we don’t sleep enough, stress hormones like cortisol go up, making us tired and cranky.

1ib2coz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkTherapy/comments/1ib2coz/how_do_i_find_a_therapist_based_on_political/,How do I find a therapist based on political ideals,"I'm at a loss, I don't know what to do. I need a new therapist but I don't know how to find one that fits one specific category: similar political ideations.

I live in America and I don't want to sound too egocentric, but I don't think I'm incorrect when I say a lot of people are probably aware of how politically charged the American atmosphere in general has been for around the last ~10 years. I am decently well informed about the politics in my country and I lean very, very heavily toward one end of the political spectrum (Left-Right, Liberal-Conservative, Democratic-Republican, whatever you want to call it). Politics affect nearly every aspect of my life, from my job, to my liberties, to the media content available to me, to the opportunities I can access, etc. My ideals, values, and beliefs clash EXTREMELY with what the 'other side' of the political spectrum believes in.

I had a therapist. I had been going to her on and off since 2019. The last appointment I had with her was the week after the election in November. Halfway through the appointment, I noticed that her coffee tumbler had a degrading comment on it about 'my' side of the political spectrum. And I just instantly felt so betrayed. Some people say people can separate political beliefs from who a person is, but with the way politics affect our lives, I 100% do not believe that is possible. Political beliefs shape how people view the world and the people around them. It's impossible to separate. Some people also believe that therapists can separate who they are as a person and who they are as a therapist but I don't believe that either. And to be quite frank, I do not trust my vulnerabilities, my deepest insecurities, my anxieties, the darkest parts of myself - literally the reasons I need a therapist - with someone who believes in things that so vehemently oppose what I stand for. I don't trust her anymore. I can't!

So I can't go back to her. I refuse. But I really, really need therapy. But how on earth do I find out a potential therapist's political leanings? I live in one of the most 'other side' leaning states in the country so almost everyone around me supports the 'other side'. My chances of being able to randomly select a therapist in my area with the same political ideals as me is statistically unlikely. I know there's certain communities of people that are more likely to vote the same as me, but considering I personally know two certified therapists (I work in the mental health field, as a residential group home staff member) who belong to one of those communities and still voted opposite 'my' side, I don't have a lot of faith in that process.

I've more or less accepted that I'll have to find a therapist online (I'd prefer in person, but that's looking less possible by the day) but I can't figure out how to search for a therapist based on political parties. I've tried the search for a therapist tool from Psychology Today, and I've filled out that silly Better Help survey to 'match' me with a therapist, but none of the search criteria or filters avaliable have anything to do with political ideals. I don't want to be vulnerable and open up to another person only to find out later on that they believe in and want policies enacted that actively harm me and people like me. And I'm pretty sure it's inappropriate to straight up ask the poor receptionist who schedules appointments who a therapist voted for in the election.

Does anyone have any ideas? I haven't actually asked a receptionist if I'm allowed to know a potential therapist's political values, but I'm pretty sure if I did ask, they wouldn't be allowed to tell me. I have no idea what to do and anyone I've asked for advice in my personal social circles all think I'm being silly about this but I just...I can't trust the other side. They scare the hell out of me, to be honest. I can't tell you how many panic attacks I've had that have been triggered by politics in the last 10-ish years. 

I'm sorry, I know I like basically wrote a novella about this but I'm just...scared and anxious and desperate and I don't know what to do. I need help. And it seems I have severe trust issues that I cannot and maybe don't even want to compromise on in this matter specifically. What do I do?

So, I’m wondering—what if I started a business to fix this? Picture this: zero-calorie, electrolyte-packed, carbonated herbal teas. Refreshing flavors, no sugar, perfect for staying hydrated while crushing it on the course.

I crushed on him silently for months. My best friend kept teasing me, “Tujhe toh K3G ka ek tarfa pyaar ho gaya hai.” I laughed it off, but the truth? She wasn’t wrong.

Fast forward to last week—our school was hosting this massive Republic Day event, and I was in the cultural team, handling decorations. Guess who volunteered to help? Yup, Arjun. Cue internal screaming.

We ended up spending hours together, tying tricolor streamers, putting up posters, and talking about everything from A.R. Rahman’s music to how overrated Pathaan was (he agreed—instant bonus points).

Then came the moment. He casually asked, “Are you performing in the cultural show?” I panicked because, duh, I wasn’t. But then I blurted, “No, but if I were, I’d dedicate the performance to you.”

DEAD SILENCE. My brain was like, Ab toh gayi, sharam se zameen mein chali jaa.

But he smiled and said, “Guess I’d better watch out for your next performance, then.” I DIED. Not literally, obviously, because I’m writing this post, but yeah.

A week later, I worked up the courage to just say it outright. I told him, “Look, I like you. Not in the ‘crush from a distance’ way, but in the ‘I actually want to know you’ way.”

I would like to know if I should buy a new basket or not.

Although I have been in the world of pour over for a few years, I am a newbie when it comes to espresso.

Since I know that the coffee community, in general, is always looking for something to spend money on and companies take advantage of this by creating useless devices… I came to ask for your help before acting on impulse. 😂

All these nomenclatures and types (IMS, VST, E&B, pressurized, non-pressurized, nanotech, single/double layer, high extraction, low flow, high flow, etc.) have been causing me a bit of confusion when it comes to choose a basket.

My equipment is: Breville Bambino Plus, DF54 Grinder, Normcore V4 Tamper and WDT Tool, and a Matow 54m Espresso Dosing Funnel. My portafilter and basket are the standard ones that come with the Breville Bambino Plus.

To give a little more context, I always make coffee with 18g, and I really like dark roasts (I don't know if this makes a difference when choosing a basket). Also, I would like to know if I should use a puck screen or a paper filter at the bottom of the basket.

Off topic: although I have read that it is not necessary to buy another portafilter, I have been tempted to do so, because sometimes I can't get the tamping to be perfectly level. When this happens, the puck seems compacted, but one side is higher than the other in the portafilter. Does this happen because I am a beginner and still don't know how to tamping, or because the portafilter doesn't balance well?

I am a 29M and up until 27/28, I had no issues at all. I am pretty athletic, gym, play sports and stay relatively healthy. No prior medical history. In March 2023, I was on vacation with my gf and was drinking a beer at a ski resort. Half way through, I had the most terrible right flank pain. I mean it was unbearable. A few weeks later, I went to a urologist and they did a CT scan as well as a renogram, where he concluded that I had hydronephrosis or Dietl crisis. The doc said to wait a year to see how it goes… over the past year it would be almost like flare ups. Usually caused by BEER, alcohol, over eating, or just eating something too greasy/oily etc. however sometimes even just something as minor as coffee. 

The most recent “flare up” I had was 4 days ago when I took a pre workout .. worked out then had a protein shake + dinner after. I had the most unbearable pain overnight and into the day (next day) I mean we’re talking almost 6 HOURS. I was rolling in bed, taking a shower, going into the tub .. basically doing anything to try to occupy myself.

I don’t want to say what I do for a living to stay somewhat anonymous but I have a high position at a large company and we had board meetings the day of my flare up. I had to skip out on an important day for the company where several members of the board and investors flew in for. Even though my colleagues backed me up, it was embarrassing and I knew I had to do something about my health.

I am scheduled in March with a good doctor in my area who performs laparoscopic robotic pyleoplasty. Has anyone done this surgery?  And why does the pain only come to me with things like beer and not soda or even junk food?? Really weird. 

I can post my scans if needed.

Last year, my accountant said I should be sending John a 1099. When I notified John and asked for his W9, he seemed hesitant. He keeps a separate checking account that our rent goes into, and he pays the office rent directly out of that. The little extra that’s left goes towards utilities, cleaning, shared office stuff (coffee, snacks, water, etc), and occasional office parties. He asked if my CPA could mark it as ‘Office Rent’ instead of a contractor expense, and that he needs to be careful that this doesn’t look like profit or income on his end.

A’s break finally comes around and she’s in the computer (btw only the manager and the leads can use the computer so I have no idea what B could have possibly been doing on google) all of A’s break (btw this isn’t a 15 minute break, I’m talking lunch break) she spent chatting it up with A, both just casually sitting like it was nothing, just doing a whole lot of NOTHING, I’m nosy so I was restocking in the back. Those ladies were NOT talking about work, or anything work related. This whole B doing absolutely nothing thing went on for a few hours before she finally decided to come to the front, whole time the most she did was make a few drinks most of the time was spent standing next to A while she was doing her work, A was talking to the customers? B was right next to her ready to start up a conversation. B did a whole lot of nothing the whole day, talked to another coworker and she noticed it as well, A constantly get mad at us for “not doing enough” or “talking when you’re supposed to be working” yet she won’t mind her favorite employee sitting in the back for hours just casually being on the computer and drinking coffee. I asked another coworker what B was doing since she wasn’t doing squat “oh she’s just having a bad day” just because she’s having a bad day she gets to do nothing? I’ve had a breakdown in the back only for A to get mad at me and tell me “its too busy for you to be doing nothing” today wasn’t a busy day, but even when it isn’t busy B gets away with doing absolutely nothing every single day, today was just the worst example. I can’t even say anything because A’s related to the owner, and I would be the one getting in trouble for voicing my thoughts ",1,1737960908.0,Rants,0,1.0,False

Hi :) 

I didn’t sleep so well again, or maybe I slept fine but just woke up a lot, or what felt like a lot. 

I don’t have a totally packed day today! 

I love fairy music. I mean, *fairy music* isn’t the right term but I mean it also feels right. It’s basically just instrumental piano and harp and violin and things. I love it? It’s so… hm. Sometimes I wish I was just a little fairy living in a little sparkly grotto with my fairy friends and I could take naps inside a flower and had a little ladybird pet and all my house things were made of little things like a little half acorn shell is a bowl and things like that. I think I’m just regressing back to mini me and my fairy books, it’s been on my mind since Toad came up on connections and I was thinking about his quaint little life and how lovely it would be. Though I’m not even really thinking of him because he has the big Toad Hall. I’m mostly thinking of Martha B Rabbit and all the Shirley Barber books I adored as a little girl. Like the enchanted woods?  Sometimes I want a child purely so I can share my favourite childhood things with them. What would I want to share the most? Hmmm… 

* The Madeline books, I still have a lot of my own copies with little inscriptions from my mum saying “Happy birthday to my darling girl on her third birthday” and things :) 
* Shirley Barber books, specifically Martha B Rabbit, The Enchanted Wood and the one with a wedding? 

Wait I’ve literally done this list in a journal before. Is my memory truly so bad? Godddd. Okay I won’t do it again. I think I will find some copies of these books though. Anyway I love their cutie little lives! Like how Martha lives in a tree trunk? And she has a real little house in there. It’s my favourite. So cosy and sweet. I wish I was a bunny who worked as a cook for some fairies. But no I think I would still rather be the fairy. Maybe I should play with my makeup again soon, I haven’t in so long as it’s all sort of packed away in my closet but I could do a fairy princess makeup look! How cute! I like playing with it sometimes, it’s always right before my shower when I’ve done it in the past as I get nervous someone will see me and think I’m wacko. Now I have the *dogs go wacko for schhhhhhmackos* ad in my head. Anyway but how cute and fun and pretty! I mean it would be prettier on someone with a decent face but sadly I do not have such a canvas to work on, I am limited to the mug god gave me. But maybe super pinky lilac shimmery cheeks and similar look on the eyes with glitter and big lashes and light pink lips with a silvery sparkly gloss and hmmmm. I probably won’t. Or maybe some time. I’m too allergicky still. And I think it will just make me feel really ugly - more like a troll than a fairy. So maybe I won’t. 

I need to go to the post office today. I feel so pathetic that my anxiety is hitting so high because of that? I can feel my hands trembling and it’s made me clumsy and then that’s just the physical side of it. It’s also in part because I’ve never been to this post office before, and I’ve also never really ever spent time in this suburb/area of shops? So it’s not familiar to me and therefore more daunting. It will be entirely fine. I just have to do it. 

I DID IT. Parcel sent. Given how goddamn late it is I would have been better to just send nothing but oh well. It all went fine - though the woman at the post office spoke so quietly and was behind glass and there was music playing and she was leaning really far back for some reason so I didn’t hear everything she was saying which made me anxy, especially as I had a line behind me, and then she said how I have to write his address on it when I’ve never had to do that before? So I had to leave the line and do that then line up again and go back and then she said how it would either be $78 or $98 for basic shipping and I asked why given it was a small box and she said yeah idk it just is so I said that’s so odd because I’ve been quoted far less than that for far larger items at the central city post office so she said well I could measure it again so she did and she said oh well yeah okay it’s $28 for basic shipping then so I said great thank you for checking. I was going to do a more express courier but it was a two day difference for $50 and I thought he’d be mad with me if I told him I did that so I didn’t even though I’m telling him none of this. Anyway. So it’s done. It was *pouring* with rain and I felt so on edge? Like I was standing outside under a shop front wondering if I should walk home, train home or uber home and a woman walked past me holding a takeaway coffee and I felt so certain she was going to throw it in my face and another guy walked past but behind me which I thought was odd so I thought he was going to shove me into the traffic and a car was doing a u-turn in front of me and I thought I was going to get driven into on purpose and die between the car and the wall and all throughout this I look normal and am just standing there checking my phone the train times and weather and walk route and stuff (even though I’d done this ten times before I’d even left my house) but so I was looking regular enough but I was losing it internally. Like when planes are about to depart and I’ll be sat in my seat certain it’s going to crash and internally *panicking* but on the outside I’m just some girl with headphones in looking ahead or at her phone or book or whatever. I definitely have tells, but they’re more when I speak because I find it harder to cover that up as I already don’t feel comfortable speaking with a lot of people as it is. So like to be still and in silence? I can manage, I might be a bit fidgety and trembly if I’m really bad but I can be still okay enough. But if I have to talk I struggle, like my voice will crack as if I’m going to cry and I’m prone to getting irritable and snappy when really anxious - I just don’t handle people well when I think everything is falling down around me the only time I seem to be okay is if they match my energy in a way? - anyway what am I even talking about. Basically it all went fine, I struggled and then I felt stressed as I knew I hadn’t been messaging Andy much because my mind was elsewhere and idk. The parcel was sent, that’s all that matters. It’s DONE. In the end I took out practically *everything*, that isn’t even an exaggeration. I had got him two nice candles - one in a white sandalwood scent and one in a ‘dark vanilla’ scent - both of which are delicious and would make his place smell nice. I got him a set of chopsticks and a fancy little ceramic chopstick rest, as he said he wanted to learn to use them better. I got him two novels, a Brandon Sanderson and the name of the wind one which has wildly good reviews but also I realised it’s an unfinished series *after* I bought it for him so it’s better I didn’t send it anyway given his feelings about unfinished series and also idk if it will ever be finished by the sounds of it. Anyway and then what else? I got him an f load more lollies. Oh I got him truffle powder, truffle salt and Manuka chilli salt to amp up his toasties especially with winter coming up. What else? I think that was it. And then I got him that $100 perfume voucher and the ring. So. Okay yeah it’s a lot. It is from guilt, isn’t it? I mean it is, but also I goddamn love buying things for him. Even when we’re *together* and have been for ten years I’ll be getting him little things here and there. Even if it’s just his favourite snack en route home or if I see a book I think he’ll like or whatever. I think it’s just a way I show love. I know it is. Anyway. So now I’m sending him *one* book and *some* lollies - it’s such a fail of a gift but it’s little and that’s what matters. I’m so nervous about the book. Is it the right one?! I researched it for so long and couldn’t tell so I hope it is. I couldn’t find the other edition anywhere other than a singular secondhand copy in the UK anyway. Anyway. It’s off now. It’s such a nothing present. I also didn’t do a card. I didn’t want it to be soppy so I kept it… well I didn’t do what I always do. Anyway I guess I’m now the new owner of a couple novels, a couple candles, a chopstick set and trio of truffle things. Idk what to do with the lollies. I don’t want them here cause I’ll eat them but it seems stupid to throw them away. Hm. Im nervous for him to receive it. I usually am because of the soppy card stuff, but now it’s more the present and it being wrong. Anyway. It’s done now. Try not stress, I can’t change it after all. 

Okay I’ve run out of more time to journal anything more so night night",1,1737960753.0,u_createdjustforthi-23,0,1.0,False

I have been friends with a girl that is also my age for almost four years now, let’s call her K. We first met because I volunteered to DM a DND group (of 10 people) at a summer thing. Due to the nature of the summer thing, I knew almost no one in the group and spent three weeks playing and getting to know everyone. K was super cool and was a lotta fun to be in a group with. After the summer thing was over we all parted ways but we were going to try to continue the campaign online (obviously, it didn’t work out because everybody’s schedules didn’t align, but as a result, I did receive everyone’s contact info: including K’s).

I kept in somewhat regular contact with K (messaging maybe 2 or 3 times a month. We lived in different towns and I sucked at messaging). Flash forward a year and it turned out we were going to the same college. I was kind of excited since I would at least have one friend for sure when I got to campus! 

After getting to campus we decided to hangout a bit and it was very nice. I have always been super oblivious to social cues, and very introverted in a romantic sense, so I hadn’t really had feelings for anybody before this. At the time, I don’t think I really knew or realized I liked her, because I hadn’t had those feelings before.

Jump forward a couple months and there is a big dance happening on campus. I had been asked by a couple friends to go, but two hours before they flaked, so I decided I wasn’t going to go. I went to the dining hall and was grabbing a meal and saw a mutual friend of mine and K’s. I went over and said hello. 

She seemed a bit confused and asked if I was going to the dance. 
I said, that I planned on it but my friends that were going with me flaked so I decided to forego the event.
She then casually mentioned that a couple of her friends were going, but she wasn’t interested in attending. It just so happened that K was one of those friends.

Immediately, something in my stomach told me I needed to be at that dance. Call it a premonition or FOMO, but a switch flipped in my brain. I excused myself and ran back to my dorm to get ready. I put on a stupid sequin vest and bow tie and headed for the shuttle to the event. I was going to be a few minutes late but it was a three hour dance so I didn’t figure it mattered much. 

When I got to the dance, I walked around looking for anyone I knew but didn’t see anyone. So, I started talking to some other party goers who were friendly enough to make conversation. About fifteen minutes later, K walked in. I tried to play it cool and went to say hello. She seemed genuinely excited to be there, and if I’m being honest, her excitement was contagious. I asked if she was okay with me hanging out with her friends and her and she didn’t seem to mind.

We broke off from the group and for the next 2 hours we danced like lunatics (I’ve always enjoyed dancing even though I suck at it lol). The event was a lot of fun and I have a lot of great memories/ pictures from that night. We parted ways and that was it.

Two weeks later she asked if I wanted to grab coffee and hangout. Of course I said yes. We got coffee and spent the next hour and a half talking about life and our latest obsessions lol. Retrospectively, I realize now that she seemed kind of nervous while we were talking, but again, I suck at social cues so at the time I did not pick up on it. A little while later, I excused myself to go to the restroom. While in the bathroom, I was thinking of an awesome topic of conversation. And then it came to me…

As soon as I got back, I went to sit down and we both started speaking. I nervously laughed cause I felt bad interrupting her. I prompted her to go first, but she insisted that I say what I was going to say. So then I said it:
“Do you think the trees are alive?”

She started breaking out laughing, and I realized I said something really stupid.

“No, I mean like do you think they are alive, alive? Like they’re having conversations and will one day come to take their revenge?”

We both started laughing and I dismissed my question. 

“So what were you going to say?” I asked her.

Then she asked:
“Soooo, I was wondering if you would be interested in going out with me.”

I was taken a back. I had not viewed her in that light before, so I wasn’t expecting her to ask that. I’m sure, I made some kind of face while I was thinking that may have been misconstrued because then she started backtracking.

“I just had a lot of fun with you at the dance the other night, and I like hanging out with you, but if it’s not something you’re interested in, I totally understand and I…”

I said that, I thought her asking was very sweet, and I was honest that I hadn’t really seen our friendship in a romantic light before, but I made it clear that, that did not mean that I couldn’t see her in a romantic light. So I said yes!

Then I did this really stupid awkward thing where I double thumbs up and said “awesome. Cool. Alrighty.” And kind of made the whole thing stupidly awkward lol.

Long story short we went on two-ish dates and I was not super sure about my feelings (as I’d never had feelings for anyone before), so I tried to be a communicative as possible that I wasn’t sure if I had feelings, but I was still very open to continue dating to see if I got clarity.

I tried to communicate my feelings as much as possible, because I know that’s where people usually go wrong in relationships. 

We got coffee one day to clarify our relationship/ relationship goals, which then led to us being more confused about what we were then when we started lol.

So later on K messaged me to get dinner so we could “actually figure this out lol”. So we got dinner and talked, and decided that maybe it would be best if we were friends. I felt really bad for reasons I couldn’t place, but still wanted to be her friend. I think I was just scared I was going to hurt her feelings.

One month later, it kind of all hit me. The feelings that I had for her. I think I rationalized that I didn’t have feelings for her because I didn’t like where I was mentally at that time. I’ve always had a lot of self image issues, and didn’t think I was really in a place where I deserved to date/ be in relationship. 

So I bottled my feelings. Two years later we are still good friends, are in a DND group together, and still hangout. 

I still have a crush on her, but I’ve told myself that I don’t deserve to pursue her because I already had my chance. I don’t know if the whole relationship thing bummed her out, and I would hate to hurt her feelings or confess and her not be interested which would possibly impact our friendship. 

I am just sitting on these feelings, and I needed to get them out somewhere. I can’t afford therapy, so I figure Reddit was the place to go.

Managing Type 2 Diabetes isn’t exactly a walk in the park.

The constant need to monitor blood sugar, plan meals, and resist tempting treats can leave anyone feeling frustrated. For many, the thought of relying solely on medications can feel discouraging.

[Diabetes Freedom](https://theworldhealth.org/diabetes-freedom-official) is a program that promises to take a natural route to help people regain control. With its focus on targeting **fat deposits and diabetes**, it claims to offer an alternative that’s more empowering and sustainable.

But does it deliver on these promises? Let’s dig in and see if it’s worth your time—and wallet.

# Product Overview

* **Product Name**: Diabetes Freedom
* **Category**: Diabetes Management Solutions
* **Overall Verdict**: 4.6/5

This program claims to provide a **step-by-step diabetes program** that targets the root cause of insulin resistance. Its combination of lifestyle changes and dietary adjustments is designed to help individuals **reverse type 2 diabetes naturally**, improve energy levels, and reduce dependency on medications.

# How Does Diabetes Freedom Work?

**Diabetes Freedom** is built around a three-step approach designed to tackle **insulin resistance solutions** head-on.

The process kicks off with a 14-day detox plan, filled with **dietary strategies for diabetes**, like antioxidant-packed foods and cleansing detox drinks. It’s a tough start, but for many, the results make it worth the effort.

Next comes the **meal plans for diabetes**, where timing plays a major role. By [eating at specific times](https://theworldhealth.org/diabetes-freedom-official), you can stabilize blood sugar and promote fat loss—no fancy tricks required.

Finally, the program introduces foods designed to boost metabolism and help manage blood sugar over the long term. Sally, my mom’s friend with **mild Type 2 Diabetes**, described it best: “It’s not just a plan; it’s a wake-up call for my diet.”

# What’s Included in the Program?

When you purchase **Diabetes Freedom**, you’ll gain access to:

* **Video Modules**: Easy-to-follow guides that simplify the program into digestible steps.

The program offers practical tools to turn these concepts into actionable steps, giving you clear advice instead of overwhelming theory.

# The Science Behind Diabetes Freedom

The program’s foundation rests on addressing **pancreatic fat removal tips**.

According to its creators, excess fat around the pancreas can worsen insulin resistance, making it harder to control blood sugar. By reducing these fat deposits through specific dietary changes, the program aims to restore insulin sensitivity.

While not all medical professionals fully endorse these methods, studies do support the idea that **natural diabetes remedies**—such as antioxidant-rich foods and calorie-controlled diets—can improve metabolic health.

This science-driven approach is what makes the program worth considering for those wanting **natural ways to manage diabetes**.

# Personal Experience

Sally, my mom’s friend, has been dealing with relatively mild Type 2 Diabetes for a few years now. She’s always on the lookout for natural ways to improve her health without relying too heavily on medication.

When she [came across Diabetes Freedom](https://theworldhealth.org/diabetes-freedom-official), she decided to give it a shot, and I got the chance to hear her thoughts.

What she loved most was how easy the program was to incorporate into her life. The recipes didn’t call for exotic ingredients, and the meal-timing strategy was simple enough for her to stick with, even on her busier days.

She particularly enjoyed the morning detox drinks, which she swears gave her more energy to tackle her garden projects.

That said, Sally admitted the initial two-week detox phase took some getting used to. She missed her afternoon coffee routine, but by the end of the first week, she noticed fewer cravings and steadier blood sugar levels.

For her, the small sacrifices were well worth the improvements she felt.

Sally told me she’s not one to try every fad that comes along, but she found **Diabetes Freedom** to be practical and supportive of her goals. It didn’t just fit her needs—it gave her confidence that better health was within reach.

If you did not know, Isayama was inspired by many works throughout the writing of the manga, in this post we will touch only on the manga called Himeanole. But unlike similar articles on this topic, for the first time in this topic we touch not only on the manga, but also on the film adaptation of this manga, filmed in 2016, and its features.

**Part 1 What is ""Himeanole""?**

Himeanoles can be divided into two parts, depending on which of the main characters is responsible for the actual plot of the chapter. One of them is an ordinary guy named Okida, he is kind of a shy person, he does not have many friends and does not have a girlfriend. This changes when he goes to a local coffee shop where he meets a woman named Yuki, who later becomes his girlfriend. There are various comedic and awkward moments in this part, most of which will belong to the secondary characters (Ando, ​​Okada's teacher friend), but for us, the important one is the second main character, whose name is **Morita**.

Morita is not normal. He is almost a psychopath. In fact, he has killed in the past and is prone to do so again (he killed a bully who bullied him in collaboration with his classmate). He also asks the classmate **(Wagusi)** with whom he killed the bully to send him money on a regular basis, while not working for 7 years and spending the money on a pachinko machine. But still, his storyline starts, oddly enough, as a minor character whose goal is to help his ""friend"" kill a man for money (an insurance scam), unfortunately, the plan fails and the ""friend"" plans to escape because he is afraid of being arrested, but suddenly something unexpected happens and Morito just kills him.

Later, he calls his ""friend"" Wagusi (a classmate who helped him kill a bully from school) from whom he extorts money and asks him to help him with the body of the murdered man (he doesn't know about the murders), which leads to this dialogue.

**""Chapter 22""** (Warning: possible translation errors)

(Wagusi: Hey, ...don't you fee any guilt?

Wagusi: Haven't you ever imagined the sadness of those who die and the people around them?

**Wagusi: Do you really think it's οκαυ το go that far just for pleasure?**

Wagusi: Even if there's someone similar to **you... that person might be enduring it rationally for their whole life**

Wagusi: You talk about being unlucky**...about feeling sorry for yourself, as if it's all just inevitable.**

Wagusi: But that's the same as saying you're **just like a rapist or an arsonist.**

Morita: Guilt, yes... I never thought about it... But inside me there's always a feeling of striving forward, as if I'm constantly flying towards danger.

Morita: You're only holding on because you can handle it, right? that's why i'm already... done with it.. 

Morita: I remember a moment in middle school when i thought, 'was i just **born to kill people?**' it really gave me chills.

Morita: since that day, something feels like... i'm living half in a dream. i have no sense of reality. every day, what am i doing? it's completely uninteresting...)

[Dialogue](https://preview.redd.it/l0a8kafbfhfe1.png?width=1088&format=png&auto=webp&s=b462ca0658ce83770de82783bf755c7d6b07cae8)

And yes, he doesn't seem to feel any self-loathing or pity for other people, he also directly states his main goal (to kill Yuki and torture her) several times throughout the manga and his number one goal never changes. Later on, the plot switches from killing Yuki to killing Okade when Morito finds out that they are dating and that Okade can become a ""threat"" (my understanding) and tries to get rid of him, he even hires a homeless man who has a driver's license to help him if Wagusi can't (while lying that he wants to teach Okade a lesson as a bad person who insults his ""girlfriend"" Yuki). However, this event becomes the last straw for Wagusi, he plans to turn himself in to the police to stop Morito and his future murders, but his girlfriend suggests to just kill him and he agrees to it, unfortunately, the plan fails and they die at the hands of Morito.

Now Morito uses a homeless man to dispose of the bodies (while threatening him that if he doesn't help, he'll kill him) and burns down his house to delay the police in their investigation of missing people (people die as a result of the arson). After this, several more bad things happen to him (the murder of a woman with cancer who sheltered him, the murder of a policeman after which Morito gets a weapon, the murder of Yuki's neighbor in an attempt to carry out his plan, as well as the man who investigated his case and warned Okada, causing Yuki and Okada to flee the city). In the end, in an attempt to achieve his goals, he killed 7 people and lost everything he had, but never got to Yuki, for the first time he starts thinking about himself and others, and ends up in the hands of the police (knowing that he faces the death penalty).

**Part 2. Those Were Not Human Eyes.**

Honestly, there's a lot to say about the adaptation, but we'll focus on the last 20 minutes of this movie, where things happen that weren't in the manga, and the first thing we'll touch on is the dialogue between Yuki and Okade in the hospital after Ando meets Morita (a completely original scene).

[Dialogue in the hospital](https://preview.redd.it/5rl22l3hfhfe1.png?width=763&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf744f82c60f39761b5292c64f579e566ba4e8b7)

**(01:20:33-01:22:00)**

(Yuki: Mr. Ando will not die.

Okade: It's all because of what I did.

Yuki: What can I do?

Yuki: It is not your fault.

Okade: Of course it is.

Okade: Morita...came for me.

Yuki: It all started when we were dating.

Yuki: It is not your fault.

Okade: Me too...did something.

Yuki: What did you do?

Okade: The truth is...when we got to high school...

Okade: I became friends with Morita.

Okade: We liked the same games.

Okade: But when Morita...

**Okade: Kawashima mocked him...**

**Okade: I started keeping my distance.**

**Okade: Then Morita...stopped coming to school.**

Okade: And Kawashima...there was no one to intimidate and it became boring.

Okade: I forced Morita to go back to school.

Okade: I told him that Kawashima ready to apologize.

Okade: I lied to him.

**Okade: I brought Morita to school. I teamed up with the hooligans.**

**Okade: I looked at him with contempt.**

**Okade: I'll never forget how**

**Okade: He looked at me.**

**Okade: With despair.**

**Okade: He was dying. These were not human eyes.**)

And you got it right, in the 2016 movie we have a different Morito, unlike the original, where it is often said that he was like this from birth, in the movie he is just an ordinary guy who was broken and succumbed to the ""darkness of man"" and started killing. What is even more remarkable is the changed dynamics of the relationship between Okade and Morita, because in the movie they are more like friends than in the manga (**in the original they only had one dialogue at the beginning, and in the movie there are as many as 4**), although you can say that all these dialogues were added only for the sake of the ""final battle"" between school friends.

[Completely original scenes \(rescue Yuki and capture Morito\)](https://preview.redd.it/z87cf7qqfhfe1.png?width=1403&format=png&auto=webp&s=9058af129fe19b81480034b63d91e645c4333866)

[The ending of the film](https://preview.redd.it/f65som8ufhfe1.jpg?width=1544&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00ab69f3f4883b224550c1032fc44be4d5c1f994)

**Part 3 Eren and the Problems of an Idea**

So now we know that Isayama's idea of ​​someone being ""born the way they are"" seems to mostly come from Himeanole, where Morita was never able to become a normal person who could live in society and knew there was always something wrong with him (except for the 2016 movie). Isayama hinted at this idea for Eren at various points in the story, most famously Chapter **121**.

[This implies that there was always something \\""off\\"" about Eren.](https://preview.redd.it/23db055yfhfe1.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a5181be953cbdcea97b02255b6b5965a11ddff5b)

On its own, if you don't take 131 and 139 into account, this is just Eren stating that he would always fight for freedom and that he doesn't hesitate to be violent towards those who tried to rob him of his freedom. Pretty much in line with how most viewed Eren anyway, yes?

A guy who is naturally violent when it comes to his pursuit of freedom but also empathetic enough to care about those around him.

That would be the case, right? Sadly not. And here is where the influence of Himeanole arrives.

In Himeanole, the serial killer was severely bullied as a teenager, but also claims (by himself) that he was born ""different"" (but not in the 2016 film, this plot point is cut).

So what does this have to do with Eren?

He wished for it. He wanted it to happen.

In other words, 131 paints Eren as if he wanted to create the Rumble because he wanted to see the very world that was presented to him in Armina's book: In conclusion: Eren was born with a twisted desire for freedom, that freedom = flat earth (yes, as stupid as that may sound), and because of that, he committed the Rumble. He just wanted a clean surface and wanted to kill humanity because they were in his way.

The Himeanole check here is great. Morita, like Eren, wasn't born ""normal"" and he also had a sick and twisted desire. For his desires, it was to get pleasure by killing people. For Erena, it's a flat world that he wants to have and the only way to achieve that is to kill everyone.

https://preview.redd.it/baiqe1h5ghfe1.png?width=528&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b42ce97c71df252029332780a4c3ef4a025cee7

So why doesn't it just work!!!

The difference between Himeanole and Attack on Titan is that the author of Himeanol portrayed Morita as a villain after his first kill. While you can feel sorry for him, it's hard to ever sympathize with him when you know he's doing it simply because he's an evil pervert who gets pleasure from these people.

Meanwhile, in Attack on Titan, Isayama wrote a ton of reasons why someone should root for Eren. Hell, we see Eren's mother get eaten (reveals he did it, thanks to 139 for that), which would make just about anyone angry. We see him become more calm and rational in Brawl, we see him get genuinely upset at what his father did. We also see Eren even give up his own life to save humanity in the Historia cave.

That doesn't fit a character who apparently just wants to flatten everything because of a random book. Hell, even Eren himself said that he FORGOT the dream he shared with Armin in Chapter 84.

https://preview.redd.it/16htozr7ghfe1.png?width=979&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b34fe364c853771b6010db55ff571df402f38ff

131 wants to tell us that ever since he was a child, Eren has been inclined to see the Earth as flat and devoid of people, and yet in Chapter 84, Eren says that he has long forgotten about that dream and that it has been replaced by a desire for revenge.

He wasn't interested in the sea, he was interested in seeing these things without being bound by any restrictions.

But then the number 131 comes up, implying that ""**seeing this scenery**"" was what Eren had wanted all along, ever since he was a child. There's a reason why these two panels use the image of Eren as a child.

https://preview.redd.it/t832gp0aghfe1.png?width=528&format=png&auto=webp&s=76ca5c7267ee42f8b26f5848e94751a7e5b44425

Suddenly, what he wants to achieve isn't the freedom he would get from killing his enemies, not recognizing the freedom of whatever he wants to think, but the view itself.

The implication is disturbing. In fact, even if the outside world was completely peaceful, Eren would still have caused the Rumble because he was disappointed that humanity even exists outside the walls (**131**).

https://preview.redd.it/luctjd2cghfe1.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=b51927dcabc977a3c4a270875d1f25e148bba354

So Eren wanted to do the Rumbling because he wanted a flattened world, he states so in 139, he states in 131 that he was disappointed that humanity still existed and that he wanted to wipe it all out. He also states that this is primarily because the world wasn't like the one in Armin's book.

But how does this fit with the same guy who himself previously stated that he forgot about this dream? How could something that Armina's book told him be taken to make him want to destroy the world?

Isayama couldn't answer any of these questions. He took only one part of Morito's character and ignored all the others or replaced them with something that was never part of his character. Morito is honest with himself, he knows what he wants and what he will do (get rid of any threat that could stop him from catching Yuki) for his dream, in the movies he almost achieved this goal, and we see what could have happened to Yuki. Morito deceived and killed people without having to pretend or justify his actions with heroic goals (not much effort in the movie) because most of the time he killed without remorse for his dream, **this is how he was from the beginning to the penultimate chapter**.

And what's funny is that when his conscience woke up and asked about the dead, he again thought only about himself.

So yeah, Eren's character becomes messy because Isayama got too inspired by a work that was created too late and implemented it in a bad and rushed manner, which hardly makes any sense.

**TL;DR**

**The ending was messy and confusing, Isayama shouldn't have tried to force the ""born this way"" theme that he read about in Himeanole and also add new features that were not typical of the original and contradicted.**

**P.S.**

**Although it's also worth noting that the work ""Himeanole"" is surrounded by strange facts and if you know these facts, you can ask very strange questions.**",1,1737960389.0,attackontitan,6,0.99,False
1ib1zan,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1ib1zan/huge_lump_on_chest/,Huge lump on chest,"Hello, I am 25/f, current medications are Levothyroxine .112mcg 1dx, Vyvanse 50mg 1dx, Zoloft 100mg 1dx. Current diagnosis of past thyroid nodules & goiter, hyperthyroidism (Total thyroidectomy in 2021, pathology came back with 9 nodules and entire mass of 90grams, the slide was benign), depression and adhd. 

My current issue is, about 2-3 months ago I noticed a decent sized large hard lump on my sternum. It ran parallel with my ribs, starting just slightly off center and went about 2 inches out to the right (I will try to attach a diagram). My doctor felt it, and sent me for an ultrasound. During which, we saw a weird crescent shape, right above the rib bone, the ultrasound tech was so confused that she grabbed the other senior tech. The senior tech came in and once again saw the weird shape. They scanned the other side of my right ribs, and found one other similar shape. Both techs went to the head of radiology, who told them to switch the ultrasound from “chest wall” to a breast ultrasound.. 6 images later and both techs come back saying that the head radiologist said absolutely nothing was there, I’m good to go. Well in the past few months since, the lump has tripled if not quadrupled in size and shape. It has displaced my breast tissue, it’s visible to the eye now. It spans from sternum to just about armpit length. It’s hard but not? Almost like it “pops” back in between the ribs when pushed? It was not painful until a few weeks ago, when it’s just constantly sore and tender. My underarms are sore all the time (like armpit/down the rib), I have to sleep with a full sized pillow under me, like a koala, on my stomach or else I wake up feeling like I had a UFC fight the night before. I can feel my chest getting tighter almost when I breathe? Like the amount of room I have is smaller than it used to be? My legs, arms and face are swollen most days, I’ve lost most feeling in my fingers and the soles of my feet burn and itch. My whole body itches. The other day a bunch of red and purple dots popped up all over my hands and I feel like I have hives constantly, without physical hives. I’m so tired, so tired. It doesn’t matter if I take my Vyvanse and down coffee or not, I’m falling asleep by 10:30 am, like can’t control it. I’ve barely been able to stomach food or eat a lot for the past few months, yet I’ve maintained the same weight (I’ve always always dropped weight the second I don’t eat. My goal is obviously not to lose weight but this is a bit of a concern when I’ve lost not a single pound). I wake up every night drenched in sweat, soaked through my sheets. My body hurts, my bones hurt. Everything hurts. I can’t hardly do a simple chore without having to stop halfway through from exhaustion. I feel like everyone around me thinks I’m being dramatic, but I don’t even tell them half of my pain. 

All of this to say; I had messaged my doctor after the ultrasound. Explaining the weird shape all of us saw. The tech commented on how she’s never seen anything like that. I messaged the doctor about this all, and felt very dismissed. Just her assistant messaging back, ignoring 99% of the message and suggesting one thing. I never messaged back. I finally messaged again mid January, about the lump growing, and they scheduled me for Feb 5th. I genuinely feel like this warrants a CT scan.. obviously Doctor Google is a nightmare. And I’m sure most of anyone who’s read this can guess what I’ve come across on Google. But, I have this deep feeling that something is actually wrong. It’s been like this (this like feeling of doom/there’s something not ok) for a while now. I know it seems like anxiety, and it absolutely could be. But I’ve also been in therapy for 15 years, been on medication for 15years, I like to believe I am a very self aware of my mental illnesses and how it can present. I see a psychiatrist monthly (she’s aware of my feelings), I do therapy. I don’t necessarily think it’s anxiety. However, 


I’m here asking for advice on how to go into this appointment and ask for a CT scan. Without sounding like an arrogant ass who is challenging the doctor. I also would like advice on how to advocate for myself, as I’ve had incidents in the past of not pushing and it having dire consequences. I really don’t think it’s out of the question to ask for a CT despite the ultrasound being “clean”.. I have read a few medical papers that mention the lack of accuracy when it comes to chest wall masses (that being said I never went to medical school and could be misinterpreting the papers and research). But anyways, my whole question is, does this seem to warrant pushing more despite a clean ultrasound..? And if so, how do I ask sternly but politely without stepping on toes.. I’m worried i seem like I’m making a huge deal over nothing but something keeps nagging me about it and is worried to an extent. ",1,1737960348.0,AskDocs,3,1.0,False

1ib1xn6,https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/1ib1xn6/weird_values_in_romantic_relationships/,Weird values in romantic relationships,"I’m wondering if I should be more compromising about a value/expectation that I hold for romantic relationships.

**The thing is that I think it’s disrespectful and inappropriate for my partner to hang out with friends of the opposite gender one-on-one (ie movies, dinners, etc - although a coffee run during the day is fine).**

In the past, the unhealthiest relationships I’ve had were when I dated people like this. Not to say that these people are “bad”, because they aren’t. However, no matter how much they try to reason that it’s normal and even good to have close friends of the opposite sex (ie they say “it shows that i can have platonic relationships with people of the opposite gender and don’t view them as sex objects”), it still doesn’t make me feel good nor does it actually change my opinion that it’s disrespectful and inappropriate to hang out with them one-on-one while in a relationship. I’ve tried to stay in these relationships and convince myself that it’s okay, but always ended up miserable and would ultimately feel like I had to distance myself emotionally from these partners. Then, as an INFJ, not having that safe feeling for emotional connection pretty much means there’s no point to a relationship.

I think I continue to hold this value because 1) I would not do that myself if I had a partner and 2) I have experienced a relationship with a person who also felt it was inappropriate to hang out with people of the opposite gender (they actually had friends who were primarily the same gender as them), and it was the happiest and safest relationship that I’ve ever had - we both ended up giving each other an abundance of genuine care and tender affection in exactly the way I needed.

**My question is whether this is an unrealistic expectation to uphold?**

**I know from experience that other people with similar values exist, but it is extremely rare. I am afraid that if I write off the people who don’t meet this value/expectation, that I would be risking losing a potential “soulmate” or otherwise good partner.**",8,1737960155.0,infj,17,0.84,False

I was raised in Springfield VA and DC has always been part of my life (school trips, weekend family outings, etc.) As an adult, however, I really haven’t done much in DC. When I was 22 I went with friends to a house party via the metro. When we got to Metro Center to change lines, there was a shooting (you may remember this, it was one-on-one situation with an off duty fed). This severely traumatized me, as no one knew whether the gunfire was the beginning of a mass shooting or something—it was chaos, everyone running for their lives out of the metro, jumping over the turnstiles and screaming. I’ve been struggling with getting over this fear with the knowledge that this was a rare occurrence and it likely will never happen again. 

So, earlier last year I made another attempt to go into dc with some friends via the metro. The evening was fun and nothing happened—until the metro ride home. At one of the stops, a man who seemed mentally ill got on and made his way over to where we were sitting. I then saw he had a large machete style knife tucked into his waistband (my grandpa owned a ranch and had many knives like this so I’m familiar with what they look like. It was def a machete). He then sort of paused right next to me and sat in the seat across the aisle from me. I was terrified bc he was staring at me, and so I communicated silently to my friends that we needed to get off the train. We did, and the night ended. So that was the second traumatizing thing to happen in DC/on the Metro.

So, basically, now that my grad program is ending (at GMU) and I’ve decided to stay in NOVA for a few years to work and save money before leaving to live elsewhere, I’ve made it a goal in 2025 to go to DC much more often to do fun things, either by myself or with friends. I don’t know where I’ll be working in May when I graduate, but if it’s DC then I’ll need to gain familiarity with the metro and dc in general. I think because I was raised so close to dc that I’ve taken advantage of it—it’s the capital and a major city and I never go. Obviously the two traumas I experienced haven’t helped, but I never went even before these things happened. 

My request is this: could you please share your fav things to do and see in dc?

The museums are obvious since I grew up going to them, but I’m sure there are plenty of hidden gems. I love to shop, go to hipster/artisanal coffee shops and matcha cafes, and drink craft cocktails. Fashion and food are passions of mine, as well as art/design. I’d love to make a goal to go into dc once per month. Thanks in advance for your suggestions! ",7,1737959837.0,washingtondc,3,0.89,False

Spoke this aloud today, but here's it in text too :)

Every Colour of White

  


“Why do you like white?”



“It’s every colour.” She laughed, bright and cheeky, as if the answer were simple, yet hiding a universe.  
  


He turned to her on the muddy field, his hair dark as ink, raindrops tracing the lines of his face. A smile spread across his lips, dimples sinking deep, his eyes crinkling along the waterline, and the world bent at the corners of his mouth.



 The cold hugged the mist from his breath, “You always feel everything, all at once.”



Rain pounded. Silver serpents ribboned through the field, as flowers hugged the corners. The world was smeared into colours without lines as if God had too much paint. The air hummed with electric gold. Scintillation and wet eyelashes refracted the world into geometries.



He pushed himself up, extending his hand. His eyes were clear as glass. “Rain is beautiful, without the noise.” He nodded toward the car.



Her heart fell. Her arm raised.



He never made sense, but he loved puzzles. His face had become a blur, lost to the rain.



Looking outside, the city too seemed unrecognisable. Lights bled, buildings waited, and umbrellas bobbed like boats on restless seas. The streets beneath seemed to breathe.



She shut the door, sealing out the storm and keeping the carpet from darkening, then moved to the coffee machine, hands mechanical.



Beans crushed. Milk soft. Crema atop. Steam swirled.



She filled her cup and brought the milk jug with her. Slowly, she drank, filling it to the top with milk each time she sipped. Eventually, it was just milk, and that was enough. 



Silence. People said it was healthy. She was willing to try. Her hand hovered over the mug. Fingers trembling. Was it the coffee? The stillness?  
  


Then, laughter: sharp, unexpected.

“Quiet!”



She pressed her palm into the warm ceramic, nails digging inward. The walls... the walls felt closer today. Or maybe not. Maybe her eyes had started to play tricks on her. She hadn’t trusted them for months.



Her body slid against the wall, crumpling to the floor where the tiles were cool beneath her hands. Her fingers tangled in her hair, pulling gently, then harder. The pull anchored her - just enough to feel the ache in her chest. Her chest heaved, and uncontrollable laughter bubbled up, spilling over. Her eyes were glassy, and she pressed her hands to her m+outh, muffled. 



The mug shattered, but she didn’t hear it.



Milk spread across the tiles, porcelain icebergs scattered in the sea of white. The silence didn’t settle. It hung in the air, viscous, like a second skin she couldn’t shed.



 Tears streamed down her cheeks. White as the storm that washed the world away.



Outside, circles of white bled into rectangles of black. It didn’t look like a city. Her reflection stared back, pale. The raindrops adorned her, marred the glass. Snow white.



“Every colour.” she whispered to herself.



Her heart fell. 

The noise fell.

#Where is the love#
~ by Rahlia Aumat

I often find it frightening how he always seems to know what I want.

Like this past morning, he took the last of his coffee to the kitchen to add some iced milk, ice, and caramel syrup, before bringing it back and setting it on the small table where we were working.

""Here. A morning cup of coffee, and you still look tired, ma'am.""

I couldn't figure out if it was the perfect amount of syrup he added or the little smile he wore that made that iced caramel latte so delicious.

With him, it's always a little bit of both.

""Thank you, sir. That's exactly what this text and I needed.""

One of my favorite things about him is how we always play at being super polite to each other.

But of course, everything we do together is always my favorite thing. We went back to our Saturday work as the day wore on.  You know, if he wasn't in my apartment, I would probably have spent the whole day curled up on the couch watching Netflix. 

Having a boyfriend who keeps you company in silence while you both do your work really does improve your performance, that's a fact. 

I keep thinking that I would like to bring him to the office to replace my hard chair. I wonder what my boss Jolene would say. She would probably be mad, but I could argue that he really does bring out the best in me and makes me less bitter at work. The increase in work performance has to be worth it. 

I was still forming the right argument for my theoretical debate with Jolene when he closed his computer with a long yawn that sounded like satisfaction. 

""Is it over yet? Lucky me."" 

""Well, I'm not stopping every five minutes to get high, am I."" 

He played with my hair as he spoke. I could feel his fingers untangling the morning knots in my hair one by one. 

""You don't have your boyfriend messing with your hair while you work, so of course it's over.""  ""Do you want me to leave, then? You know I have to go home at some point.""

""No. Stay for lunch.""

""As you wish, ma'am.""

He continued to gently stroke my hair, sometimes trying to braid it, but soon giving up and letting it fall apart.

I fought the urge to turn around and kiss him hard, report be damned.

Maybe having him in the office is a bad idea. You win, Jolene.

We stayed like that until lunch. You know, one of those moments where an ""I love you"" from him would make the moment perfect, but we just sat there without saying anything.

We stayed like that until lunch. You know, one of those moments where an ""I love you"" from him would make the moment perfect, but we just sat there without saying anything.

The thing is, he never says those words first. I don't understand why. He's a published poet and yet he doesn't seem to understand the importance of those three damn words that every girl wants to hear.  If it weren't for that, he'd be perfect.

I know I'm being a bit of a whiner here, but whatever. It would be nice to hear that every now and then.

""So... lunch?""

He let go of the hug to look me straight in the eye. My nose was still buried in my computer, drowning in numbers and boring spreadsheets.

""Okay, but let's order. I'm not done yet.""

""We'll have pizza, then. I'm sure I still have some coupons.""

He was spot on, both with the food selection and the coupons. Again, it's almost scary when someone knows every inch of you.

I'd be terrified if it were anyone else, but with him it's okay.

Because, you know, I love him.

He stood up and picked up the phone he'd left on the kitchen counter to place the order.

""Pineapple?""

He shouted from the kitchen.

""Of course! Do you think I'm a monster, do you?""

I could hear him laughing from the kitchen, followed by the sound of a drawer opening.  The exact drawer where I keep all my restaurant coupons.

Everything about me comes to him like an instinct.

You know, maybe it's okay for him not to say ""I love you.""

His readers may read his poems and be enchanted by his words, but I know he writes about me.

I know it's me he loves.

I'm the one he understands like no other.

After all, he knows where the caramel syrup and the pizza coupons are.

Known for its tiny, vibrant mints, [**Tic Tac Gum**](https://candyville.ca/collections/all/tic-tac) has become a household name not just in Canada, but around the world. But how did this refreshing brand manage to capture the attention and loyalty of Canadian consumers?

[Tic Tac Gum’s Marketing Strategies: How They Captured the Canadian Audience](https://preview.redd.it/mh5o1yhtbhfe1.png?width=2240&format=png&auto=webp&s=688d4ec1f4597a9bc93d227b9328446e75b4dcc8)

**1. Understanding the Canadian Market**

Before launching their campaigns, Tic Tac Gum understood the importance of knowing their audience. The [**Canadian candy store**](https://candyville.ca) market is diverse, with a mix of both traditional and modern candy lovers. Whether it’s the big city dwellers in Toronto or the laid-back consumers in Vancouver, Tic Tac Gum made sure to cater to all preferences.

What’s unique about Canadian consumers is their appreciation for brands that speak to their values—sustainability, diversity, and convenience. Tic Tac took these factors into consideration when designing its Canadian campaigns, and that’s one reason why they’ve been so successful.

**2. Appealing to Canadian Taste Buds with Custom Flavors**

One of the standout marketing strategies that Tic Tac used was creating flavors that resonated with Canadian tastes. While the brand’s original mint flavor was always a hit, Tic Tac was quick to experiment with new, localized flavors to appeal to the diverse Canadian market.

For example, Tic Tac introduced flavors that tied into popular Canadian experiences—think of flavors like ""Maple Rush"" and ""Citrus Burst,"" which align perfectly with the natural preferences of Canadians. This not only sparked curiosity but also created a sense of connection between the brand and its Canadian customers.

By using flavors that reflected the rich Canadian culture and natural elements, Tic Tac Gum differentiated itself from other brands in the competitive candy store industry. It made Canadians feel seen and heard, fostering loyalty and excitement for each new release.

**3. Engaging with Digital Marketing and Social Media**

In today’s digital age, connecting with audiences on social media is more important than ever. Tic Tac Gum has leveraged platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok to engage with their Canadian audience in unique ways.

In particular, TikTok has proven to be a goldmine for reaching younger demographics, especially Gen Z. By creating fun, shareable content like quirky challenges and partnering with Canadian influencers, Tic Tac has managed to tap into the ever-growing trend of viral marketing. Influencers, who have a strong connection with their followers, showcased Tic Tac products in a lighthearted way, often encouraging their followers to try new flavors or share their own experiences with the candy.

Moreover, the brand didn’t just stop at sponsored posts. Tic Tac hosted interactive contests, asking fans to share their own creative content using Tic Tac products. This engagement was a two-way street—fans felt involved in the brand’s story, and Tic Tac was able to gather valuable insights into what their Canadian audience truly wanted.

**4. Collaborating with Canadian Retailers and Pop Culture**

Another major aspect of Tic Tac’s marketing strategy was its collaboration with Canadian retailers. By ensuring that Tic Tac Gum was readily available in key retail locations, such as popular Canadian grocery stores and convenience chains, the brand positioned itself as a go-to impulse buy. Whether a shopper was running errands or grabbing a coffee, Tic Tac’s presence on the shelves was hard to miss.

In addition to retail partnerships, Tic Tac also aligned itself with Canadian pop culture. Through limited-edition packaging that reflected local sports teams, festivals, or even notable Canadian events, Tic Tac created a sense of exclusivity. Think of the Tic Tac packaging with images of hockey players or the brand’s involvement in the Toronto International Film Festival. These campaigns resonated with Canadians' pride in their local culture, tapping into a shared sense of identity.

Such efforts made Tic Tac more than just a candy—it became a part of Canadian celebrations and daily routines, sparking conversation and creating memories.

**5. Sustainability and Eco-Friendly Practices**

Canadians are increasingly concerned about the environment, and they’re looking for brands that align with their values. [**Tic Tac Gum Canada**](https://candyville.ca/collections/all/tic-tac) recognized this shift and adapted its marketing approach accordingly. One of the key factors that helped Tic Tac resonate with the Canadian audience was its emphasis on sustainability.

In recent years, Tic Tac has introduced eco-friendly packaging, reducing plastic usage and ensuring that their packaging is more recyclable. This move was met with positive feedback from Canadian consumers who were eager to support brands that were taking steps to reduce their environmental footprint.

By making sustainability a core aspect of their marketing strategy, Tic Tac not only appealed to eco-conscious Canadians but also positioned itself as a forward-thinking brand that understands the changing priorities of its consumers. As environmental concerns continue to be top of mind for many Canadians, this approach will likely continue to serve Tic Tac well.

**6. Innovative In-Store Experiences**

In addition to digital and social media campaigns, Tic Tac also invested in creating memorable in-store experiences for Canadian consumers. This included interactive displays and tasting stations where shoppers could try new flavors before making a purchase. By creating an immersive experience that went beyond just the product, Tic Tac turned a regular shopping trip into an event.

Such in-store marketing strategies not only increased foot traffic to participating retailers but also enhanced the brand’s visibility and appeal. Consumers were more likely to share their in-store experiences on social media, generating additional buzz around the Tic Tac Gum brand.

**7. Celebrating Canadian Holidays and Seasons**

Canadians are known for their love of seasonal celebrations, whether it’s Thanksgiving, Christmas, or even the National Hockey League playoffs. Tic Tac capitalized on these seasonal moments by releasing special edition flavors and packaging that aligned with the spirit of Canadian holidays.

During the winter holidays, for example, Tic Tac introduced peppermint and gingerbread flavors, tapping into the festive mood. During the summer months, flavors like tropical fruits or iced tea offered a refreshing change, aligning with Canadians’ desire for light and fun flavors during warm weather.

By timing their releases with these key moments, Tic Tac not only appealed to the seasonal preferences of Canadian consumers but also integrated itself into their lifestyle and cultural celebrations.

**8. Building Long-Term Brand Loyalty**

Through these strategic marketing initiatives, Tic Tac has succeeded in building a lasting relationship with Canadian consumers. The brand’s ability to stay relevant, engage with its audience in meaningful ways, and provide a product that aligns with their values has ensured its place in the competitive Canadian candy store market.

But Tic Tac’s success didn’t come overnight. It’s the result of years of consistent marketing efforts that involved understanding consumer trends, creating innovative products, and aligning with Canadian values. As the candy industry continues to evolve, Tic Tac is well-positioned to remain a favorite in the hearts and homes of Canadians.
