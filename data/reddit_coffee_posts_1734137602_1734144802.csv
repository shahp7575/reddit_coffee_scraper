My problem is that I'm not quite sure what gay/bi men enjoy seeing. I've heard SFW stuff does well, like making coffee or doing everyday things with your shirt off, etc., but what about NSFW stuff? Do they like seeing guys with toys (fleshlight, dolls, etc.), JO sessions, butts, specific poses?

1hdt7yt,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hdt7yt/my_gf_f20_and_me_f21_had_a_pretty_big_fight/,My gf (F20) and me (F21) had a pretty big fight recently due to my pride,"TL;DR: My girlfriend cancelled on our plans last moment due to the fact that her friends called her selfish for not joining her for their impromptu dinner plans. Days prior, the reason why our plan was made in the first place was because her friends cancelled on their plans to eat at a local coffee shop and instead switched it with a plan for a drinking session, my girlfriend disliked drinking and I guess to fill in with their switched up plan I parred it up with our formerly cancelled plans to go out with her.

Fast forward to the day of the plan, I brought her flowers and was so excited I came early at our meet up place, she had a class prior so I made it a mission to, for once, be so early for her I came an hour before our meeting time additionally, I did not eat for the entire day so that I could par up with her appetite, see, she hates it when someone finishes their meal before her and I get full very quick so I have to have an appetite for heavy meals when I am with her. 30 minutes in, she chatted me that her friends changed their plans once again from a drinking session to a dinner to cater to my girlfriend's request.

Now I have no problems with her meeting up with her friends, in fact, I have been pushing her to bond more with her friends since her time is spent mostly on me, it was just that day was planned, and I was waiting for her. For the past 2 days I have also been pestering her about making sure that she really had nothing going on for that day since that plan that I proposed to her has also been replanned for three times already, it involved walking to a park where the christmas season is being celebrated in and I was not able to walk through it last year so I was looking forward to it today.

Fast forward to the day of the ""plan,"" since I was already in the place of meet-up, she insisted on meeting me before going to her friends, I agreed because I thought we will be, at the very least, eating at a coffee shop nearby to make up for cancelling our plans but then she texted me again if it will be okay for me to accompany her to walk to their dinner destination, agreed. But then 10 minutes came, my order came and she was not even there. This disappointed me so much I threw away the bouquet I brought for her and pretended my order did not arrive yet so that I have an excuse to stay at our meetup place.

She arrived, saying that her friends were already there so I told her to go without me since ""my order was not there yet"" she reluctantly walked away and when I saw that it did not even take her a single look back to check up on me, I proceeded to just go home. I know I am so petty for being mad, I even told her that I don't like her male friend and that she should cut him off because him constantly getting his face close to her did not bode me well.

Now, I can count reddit to humble me down, can anyone please give me advice on how I could bring down my pride and make it up to her for. I was being mean and it's true, it's only rare for her friends to include her in their plans and omit drinking from their plans. Please anyone tell me what I should do to make it up to her for being so mean",1,1734144452.0,relationships,0,1.0,False
1hdt7xj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeachersInTransition/comments/1hdt7xj/leaving_changes_the_little_things/,Leaving Changes the Little Things,"I have been in a good fit outside of teaching - working nonprofit from home - full time for a week now. 

For context, I taught for over a decade in mostly public high school English. I resigned this fall when I realized my life was not one worth living. 

Here are just some things I've noticed: 

- I'm not as concerned about finances as I thought I would be. I think I underestimated how much of my own money I was draining into my role as a teacher. I also mistakenly believed that it would be difficult to find a starting salary near that of a certified teacher over a decade in. 

- It's easier to be patient - on the inside - with strangers. I've always been outwardly friendly and deferential to others, but now I really feel internally unbothered by inappropriate social choices in public places. I'm realizing that the examples parents set for their kids are not my immediate problem, and I am now not able NOR expected to remedy that in my professional life. 

- Food tastes better. The coffee. The tea. Celery. All of it. Sunlight, when I have an hour off for lunch and can take a walk outside, feels like a chemical high. 

- I daydream about good things - I daydream about the future. And my dreams at night are silly and vivid - not the constant nightmares with school spaces as the recurring setting. I thought nightmares were so much more normal than they are. 

- Being out - fully out and in another job - is absolutely nothing like summer break. This might be a personal thing, but I'm realizing now that I must have been absolutely bound by the knowledge that another school season was just a few days away. I enjoyed my summer jobs, but never stopped belonging mentally to the one that made me feel that dying in August would be the best possible thing to happen to me. 

- My former students are happy for me. I've run into a few (now graduated) since resigning, and they've expressed relief and kindness before wishing me luck. Their goodness has washed away the guilt I felt for leaving. 

- I - and you - CAN be good at other, new things. I felt immense regret for how I spent my skill-building years as an excellent student in what happened to be an awful choice of study. Now, I have team members asking me to teach them anything they don't understand - because even coworkers who don't know my background can detect that I'm an experienced and skillful teacher. That doesn't go away, even as I learn how to add new abilities to my arsenol. 

Just some last encouragement to anyone looking for the door: I feel like my new job placement came from pure dumb luck. Please remember that the dice will roll in your favor eventually. Do anything to cut and run, because now I feel a little silly for being so terrified to resign. I shudder to think what would have happened if I let my fears deny me another chance at life.

1hdt7sw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/1hdt7sw/relationship_rant/,relationship rant.,"Hey guys,

I’m a freshman and I met this chill girl during move in week. She helped me get acquainted with the campus and was good company. I asked her out, she agreed, and we have been vibing. But recently I’ve been concerned for her health. She’s neglecting her sleep, eating little, and letting her grades slip. This finals season she absolutely lost her shit and flipped out at me because I refused to write her paper for her. I don’t know why she is acting so PETTY and entitled all of a sudden. I haven’t been the best boyfriend and probably spend too much time with my nose in a book but it just feels like she’s using my inadequacies to unjustly justify her bout of high-strung behavior. She was never like this before and she just snapped at me this December. On top of that I’ve heard she’s been slandering my name and talking shit about me to her church friends — that could just be a rumor tho. She’s calmed down since but it’s kind of awkward talking to her. I have faith that she’s a good person but after that experience I’ve come to also learn that she is unhinged and unpredictable. Thank God I didn’t spend more time with her — I would’ve been slobbering over the idea of her like a puppy.   
  
However I’d say I’m a patient person and I like to keep an open mind. If someone crosses my lines, I will call them out for it and expose their red hand, however blunt I have to be. She nearly triggered me with her ranting and rambling which in turn nearly made me snap. I had to block her and then unblocked her a day later, when I told her off and to quit playing mind games. But she was still delirious and kept texting me a bunch of weird crap. A few days later she chilled out but at the same time she hasn’t even apologized or shown any action that indicates an apology. I can’t assume, but my senses tell me she is now just wandering by with our relationship, all dilly-dally, which is ironically what I find to be one of her most attractive features. She doesn’t live a life giving fucks, both before and after this strange occurance lol. However because of that she is probably scared to commit to something more serious and I’m kind of getting turned off by what I assume to be her internal illusion of blissful ignorance. I’ve tried talking to her about her freakshow incident but she just deflects the conversation and says it’s no big deal and that she was just trying to be funny (it was not funny). Now, I feel like she feigns naivety when deep down I know she is mature. I’m afraid I’ll have to break up with her if she isn’t willing to place at least some trust in my hands. My affection for her is like coffee and honestly it can go one of two ways at this point — repulsively bitter and impossible to swallow or sweet and analgesic. It’s not bad to have a sweet relationship but it can be kinda boring imo. My friends are all telling me she’s toxic as fuck and that I need to veer away but unfortunately I’m a very loyal person, so I think that may be the reason why I haven’t called it quits yet. In a perfect world I’d love a bittersweet relationship like something you see in the movies. I do think we have that potential to achieve that —  but she would have to somehow repair the havoc caused by her end, which honestly I don’t even understand where she would even begin because it may bleed deeper than I’m aware of. I’ve also suggested for her to seek mental help as it’s greatly helped me with my own shit but she told me she doesn’t want to be “reliant.” Love is quite confusing, alas 🥲🤡😭.   
  
PS. Make sure to get good grades and build your resume before participating in relationships. NGL, I feel like I’ve somehow become more stupid once I dated her lmao",1,1734144436.0,ucla,0,1.0,False

2) All it has is a defrosting machine to defrost your food and heat it up

3) Most of the recipes are saved cold for days and delivered by heating in a microwave or a merry chef. The magic to make it look fresh are the chopped corianders and onions sprinkled on top

4) The masala Chas you drink is just two pack of Amul chaas poured into a glass with some chaat masala and coriander 

5) Have you ever noticed the food would go stale if you don’t consume it immediately? 

6) Agreed coffee is coming fresh from a coffee machine

7) May be time to rethink the way India consumes food. This is worse than what I used to eat when I was living outside India

On the other hand there’s a debate on what is tagged as fresh? Can frozen food saved in the freezer for many days be still called as fresh?

Dipper snapped out of his trance and looked at her, quickly lowering his gaze. ""Uh, yeah. I just... I was thinking, you know, since we're 22 now, it might be time to finally tell Wendy...""

Mabel raised an eyebrow, leaning in. ""Tell her what?""

Dipper shifted uncomfortably. ""That I like her. I've always liked her. I just... never said anything."" He looked down at his shoes. ""I thought it might be time to confess.""

Mabel's eyes widened in mock horror. ""Dipper, no! Don't do it like that! You can't just spring it on her like that. You need to make it special. You need to-"" she paused, thinking of a better plan. ""I got it! Go on a date with her.""

Dipper's eyes went wide. ""A date? How do I even do that?""

Mabel rolled her eyes and grabbed his shoulders, pushing him toward Wendy. ""It's simple, Dipper. Just ask her out! You've got this.""

Dipper took a deep breath, his heart pounding in his chest. With a nervous glance at Mabel, he slowly walked up to Wendy.

""Uh, hey, Wendy,"" he greeted, his voice cracking slightly. Wendy looked up from her magazine and smiled.

""Hey, Dipper. What's up?""

Dipper shifted nervously, scratching the back of his neck. ""So, uh, we've, you know, known each other for a really long time now, right?""

Wendy tilted her head, intrigued. ""Yeah, dude, like, forever. What's up with you? You look like you're about to explode.""

He let out a nervous laugh. ""Yeah, it's just, um... I've been thinking a lot about how, you know, we've been through a ton of stuff together. Like the whole summer of weirdness back when we were kids, and even after that, staying in touch over the years.""

Wendy nodded, setting the magazine aside and giving him her full attention. ""Totally, dude. Those were some wild times. I mean, how many people can say they fought gnomes and lived to tell the tale?"" She grinned, leaning on the counter.

""Right, exactly!"" Dipper said, his voice rising slightly. ""And, well, I guess what I'm trying to say is... you've always been there for me. Like, more than just a friend. You're... you're amazing, Wendy. You're brave, funny, and just... awesome.""

Wendy blinked, caught off guard by his sudden seriousness. ""Whoa, dude. That's... really nice of you to say. Thanks.""

Dipper swallowed hard, his palms sweaty. ""And I've always kind of felt... I mean, I do feel... more than just friendship with you. Like, I like you, Wendy. I've liked you for a long time.""

Wendy's expression softened, but there was a flicker of surprise in her eyes. ""Dude, I had no idea you felt like that. I mean, we've always been chill, and you're honestly one of the coolest guys I know.""

Encouraged but still nervous, Dipper continued. ""I just thought... maybe... we could, you know, hang out sometime? Like, go out. On a date, I mean. Nothing crazy, just... see how it goes?""

Wendy leaned back slightly, her lips curving into a thoughtful smile. ""A date, huh? You're full of surprises today, dude.""

Dipper felt his heart hammering in his chest. ""Is that... a good surprise or a bad surprise?""

She laughed, a light and easy sound that made him feel a little less tense. ""Good, dude. Definitely good. You're sweet, and honestly, I've always had a soft spot for you.""

His face lit up. ""Really? So, does that mean-?""

Wendy held up a hand, cutting him off playfully. ""Hold your horses, dude. I'll go out with you, sure. But you better bring your A-game, Pines. You know I don't settle for boring.""

Dipper grinned, feeling a wave of relief and excitement wash over him. ""Don't worry. I'll make it awesome, I promise.""

""Good,"" Wendy said, smirking. ""And, dude, no pressure or anything, but if you mess it up, I'm totally gonna make fun of you for the rest of your life.""

Dipper laughed nervously. ""Noted.""

Dipper's heart skipped a beat as he nodded enthusiastically. ""Alright, it's a date then."" He turned back to Mabel, his nerves still on edge, but now with excitement too.

Mabel, who had been listening from the doorway, couldn't resist stepping in with a mischievous grin. ""Ooh, Dipper's got himself a date!"" she teased, waggling her eyebrows. ""What's the plan? Fancy dinner? A moonlit walk? Or are you gonna make her fight zombies for a cute stuffed animal at the arcade?""

Dipper groaned, covering his face with his hands. ""Mabel, don't start.""

""Oh, come on! It's your first date! I have to make sure you're doing it right!"" Mabel winked, playfully hopping over to him. ""So, where are we going? Can I come? I promise I won't interrupt. I'll be super, super quiet. Like a ninja.""

Dipper immediately shook his head, his face turning slightly red. ""No, Mabel. I want to go alone with Wendy. You know, so we can... actually, you know... have a normal time?""

Mabel raised an eyebrow, genuinely confused. ""Wait, but why can't I come? I'm fun, right?""

Dipper sighed, trying to stay calm. ""I love your silliness, Mabel, I really do. But not... not when I'm on a date with Wendy, okay? I just want to spend some time with her without, you know, being interrupted by your... well, your Mabel-ness.""

Mabel blinked, her smile faltering for just a second before she shrugged it off. ""Alright, alright, I get it. You want some alone time with Wendy. I'll try to behave. I mean, it's not like I can't go spy on you later anyway."" She gave him a sly wink.

Dipper's eyes widened. ""Mabel!""

She giggled, tapping him on the arm. ""Relax, Dipper. You know I'll just keep my distance. But... if you need any tips or, you know, romantic advice... you know where to find me.""

Dipper rolled his eyes, feeling a little more at ease despite his embarrassment. ""Thanks, I think I'll be fine without the tips. But seriously, Mabel, thanks for understanding.""

Mabel grinned, her eyes sparkling with mischief. ""Of course, bro. I'll be waiting for all the juicy details later. You can count on me to make sure this is the most epic first date ever. Just... you know, without showing up in person.""

Dipper chuckled, shaking his head. ""I really appreciate that."" He turned toward the door, feeling a rush of excitement and nerves all over again. ""Alright, I'm off. Wish me luck!""

""Good luck, Dipper!"" Mabel called out with a wink. ""And remember, no kissing on the first date-unless it's totally epic and memorable, then go for it!""

Dipper could hear her laugh as he stepped out, his heart beating faster as he made his way toward Wendy. Mabel's teasing was always something to laugh about, but for once, Dipper was grateful that she'd agreed to leave him to his date... even if she was definitely going to be watching from the shadows.

Later that evening, Dipper and Wendy walked outside the Mystery Shack, heading toward a local restaurant. As they sat down at a table, Dipper couldn't help but feel both nervous and excited. He looked across the table at Wendy, who was casually scrolling through her phone.

Dipper glanced across the table at Wendy, nervously tapping his fingers against the edge of the menu. ""So, uh, Wendy... you're still working at the Shack, huh?""

Wendy looked up from her phone, smirking. ""Yeah, dude. Someone's gotta keep an eye on that place. Besides, it's not like Soos can do it all by himself, and Stan's still... well, Stan."" She chuckled, setting her phone down. ""Why? You think I should have moved on or something?""

Dipper shook his head quickly, feeling flustered. ""No, no! I didn't mean it like that. I just thought maybe you'd, I don't know, have your own... place or something by now.""

Wendy leaned back in her chair, crossing her arms thoughtfully. ""I mean, yeah, I thought about it. But, dude, the Shack's home, you know? It's where all the weird, crazy stuff happens. And honestly? I don't think I'd want to leave it behind. What about you and Mabel? You guys took off right after that summer. What's it been? Ten years now?""

Dipper nodded slowly, his expression turning a bit somber. ""Yeah... ten years. It feels like forever, but at the same time, it feels like no time has passed at all. It was weird leaving. Mabel and I, we were just kids back then, but we always knew we'd have to go home eventually.""

Wendy raised an eyebrow. ""And now you're back. What took you guys so long, dude? I figured you'd visit more often. I mean, Gravity Falls isn't exactly the easiest place to forget.""

Dipper sighed, his gaze dropping to the table. ""Life, I guess. School, college, trying to figure out what to do with our lives. Mabel went all in on her art and crafts business, and I got sucked into... well, let's just call it chasing mysteries in other places."" He gave her a small smile. ""But nothing ever felt quite like Gravity Falls.""

Wendy nodded, her expression softening. ""I get that, dude. Life's... complicated, right? But I gotta say, it's good to see you guys back here. It's been way too quiet without you two causing chaos everywhere.""

Dipper chuckled, his nerves easing a little. ""Yeah, Mabel and I do have a knack for that, don't we?"" He hesitated before adding, ""I missed this place. I missed you.""

Wendy smiled warmly, leaning forward slightly. ""Well, dude, it's good to have you back. Things just aren't the same without Team Mystery Twins running around town.""

Dipper's face lit up at the old nickname. ""You remembered that?""

""Of course I did,"" Wendy said, grinning. ""How could I forget? You and Mabel were like the ultimate tag team of weirdness. And now that you're back, I'm guessing it won't be long before Gravity Falls starts throwing more crazy stuff your way.""

Dipper laughed, shaking his head. ""Honestly? I wouldn't be surprised. This town has a way of pulling us into its weirdness whether we want it or not.""

Wendy smirked, raising an eyebrow. ""Well, you better not go disappearing again, dude. Gravity Falls doesn't need a ten-year gap between visits. Deal?""

Dipper nodded, his smile growing. ""Deal. No more disappearing.""

Mabel sat on the other side of the restaurant, casually sipping her soda, but her eyes never left Dipper and Wendy. She was sitting behind the cover of a menu, pretending to read, but it was clear she was spying on her brother. With a mischievous grin, she lowered the menu just enough to get a better look at Dipper, her eyes twinkling with curiosity.

""Well, well,"" she muttered to herself. ""What's this? Dipper, all alone with Wendy? Looks like someone's trying to rekindle the old Mystery Twins charm."" She took another sip of soda, her grin widening. ""Not that I mind-just making sure nothing too weird happens.""

As she continued her playful surveillance, something caught her eye. A figure in a long, leather coat walked past Wendy and Dipper, casting a shadow over the table. Mabel squinted, her curiosity piqued. The person's face was hidden.

She slowly raised the menu higher, hiding her face, and peeked over the top, trying to get a better look. The figure was moving fast, almost too fast.

Then, out of the corner of her eye, Mabel saw the figure glance toward her. The moment their eyes met, a chill ran down her spine. The stranger's eyes widened in recognition, and before Mabel could even react, he turned and broke into a sprint, disappearing into the crowded street.

""Hey!"" Mabel whispered under her breath, her heart racing. ""What the heck was that? Who was that guy?""

Without wasting another second, she jumped out of her seat, her soda forgotten on the table. She darted out the door after him, her footsteps echoing in the street as she tried to catch up. Her heart pounded in her chest as she weaved through the crowd, eyes locked on the retreating figure ahead.

Mabel chased the figure through the bustling streets of Gravity Falls, her sneakers slapping against the pavement as she darted around corners and weaved through clusters of people.

""Hey! Wait up!"" she called, her voice echoing. ""What's your deal, dude? Are you a spy or something?""

The figure didn't answer, only quickening their pace. Mabel groaned, determination blazing in her eyes.

As she ran, she encountered her first obstacle: a fruit cart blocking the sidewalk. The vendor looked up in surprise as Mabel launched herself over the cart, narrowly avoiding a stack of apples.

""Sorry! Mystery chase happening!"" she shouted back at the confused vendor.

The figure was gaining distance, slipping through the crowd like a shadow. Mabel pushed herself harder, dodging a man carrying a stack of books and almost knocking over a street performer's guitar case.

""Hey, watch it!"" the man snapped, but Mabel only waved apologetically as she powered forward.

She spotted the figure ahead making a sharp turn into an alley. ""Oh no you don't!"" she muttered, forcing her legs to move faster. She barreled through a group of teenagers, accidentally bumping into one.

""Hey, what the-?"" one of them yelled, but Mabel didn't stop.

As she reached the alley, she hesitated for a split second before plunging in. The dimly lit path smelled like damp concrete, and the air was cooler here. She scanned her surroundings, expecting to see the figure at the other end, but stopped dead in her tracks.

The alley was a dead end.

A tall brick wall loomed at the far end, and there was no sign of the mysterious figure. Mabel squinted, her breath coming in heavy gasps.

""What...?"" she muttered, stepping forward cautiously. ""He was just here! There's no way he could've climbed that wall that fast. Did he-did he vanish or something?""

She walked up to the brick wall, pressing her hand against it as if expecting it to ripple or give way. Solid.

Mabel stepped back, scratching her head. ""Okay, Mabel,"" she said to herself, ""let's think this through. Either you just chased a ninja, or... Or that was the weirdest game of hide-and-seek ever.""

She turned, looking back toward the mouth of the alley. It was eerily quiet, the chatter of the street outside seeming distant now.

""Where did you go?"" she whispered, her eyes darting around the walls for any clue. ""What are you hiding, leather-coat guy?""

Her curiosity wasn't just piqued now-it was on fire. ""This is so going in the journal,"" she muttered, taking one last look at the empty alley before heading back to the street. As she left, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was still being watched.

Later that night, back at the Mystery Shack, Dipper was already asleep in his room, unaware of his sister's wild pursuit. Mabel, however, was wide awake. She sat in front of her laptop, her eyes scanning the screen.

She stumbled upon a website called ""Serial Killer on the Loose."" The title caught her attention, and she clicked on it. The first image that loaded made her gasp-it was the same man she had chased earlier, his face obscured by a mask. The caption read: Wanted for Multiple Murders.

Mabel scrolled down, finding more photos and reports of the man in various places around the world, always with the same description-a man in a leather coat, masked, highly dangerous.

She found herself glued to the screen as a video began to play. The footage showed the man standing on top of a church, watching as a figure below struggled for their life. The image froze, and the news report continued. ""Authorities believe the suspect is responsible for multiple deaths globally. He is considered armed and extremely dangerous.""

Mabel stared in shock, her mind racing. ""A serial killer... in Gravity Falls?"" She whispered, her eyes wide with disbelief. It didn't seem real.

But then, as the adrenaline surged, she quickly shut her laptop. ""No, I can't let anyone know about this. Not yet. If the town finds out, there'll be a panic."" She glanced at the sleeping Dipper, who had no idea what was going on. ""It's just a serial killer. Nothing to worry about. I can handle this."" Mabel murmured to herself, trying to shake off the unease crawling under her skin.

Later, Mabel was sleeping, then suddenly, a loud knock echoed through the quiet house, jolting Mabel awake. Her heart raced as she sat up in bed, confused and disoriented. It was well past midnight, and everyone else was asleep.

She rubbed her eyes, her thoughts still racing from the chilling discovery on her laptop. ""Who could it be at this hour?"" she muttered, her voice barely above a whisper. Hesitating for only a moment, she grabbed her phone, checking it for any missed messages or calls, but saw nothing unusual.

A second knock came, more urgent this time.

""Alright, alright, I'm coming!"" Mabel said, trying to sound calm as she slipped out of bed. Her feet met the cold floor with a soft thud, as she walked out of her room. As she crept down the stairs, her mind raced back to the mysterious man she had seen earlier. She could still picture his masked face, his cold, calculating eyes.

When she reached the front door, she paused, her hand hovering over the doorknob. With a deep breath to steady her nerves, she turned the handle and swung the door open, expecting to find someone-or something-on the other side.

But there was nothing. The porch was empty, and the night air felt unnervingly still.

Just as she was about to shut the door, she spotted something on the ground-a folded letter, its edges slightly curled. She bent down to pick it up, her fingers trembling as she read the message scribbled on the paper:

""I'm not what you think.""

Mabel's heart skipped a beat. The words felt like a punch to her gut. Her mind screamed at her to close the door and lock it, but she couldn't pull her eyes away from the letter. Something was wrong. Something didn't feel right.

She glanced up, and in the dim light of the yard, she saw him. The man in the leather coat, his face still hidden behind the mask, standing in the shadows of the trees. His cold eyes seemed to pierce through the darkness, watching her. He didn't move-he just stood there, waiting.

Panic surged through Mabel's chest, and before she could even think, she slammed the door shut, her breath coming in short, panicked gasps. She backed away from the door, stumbling as she bolted up the stairs and ran straight to her room.

She threw herself onto her bed, burying her head in her pillow to muffle her frantic thoughts. Was it real? Was he really out there? She shook her head, trying to calm herself. It's just a nightmare. It has to be. Just a nightmare.

The silence in the house felt suffocating as she lay there, her heart still pounding in her chest.

The next morning, Mabel awoke to the sound of Dipper's voice calling up the stairs.

""Mabel! Breakfast is ready!"" Dipper's voice was groggy but cheerful, as if nothing unusual had happened.

Mabel blinked a few times, her mind slowly pulling her out of the fog of sleep. She rubbed her eyes, glancing around the room. Everything was the same as it had been the night before.

""Yeah, I'm up,"" she mumbled, wiping her face with the back of her hand.

As she got out of bed and stretched, she glanced at her window, half-expecting to see the man in the trees again. But the morning sunlight streamed in, bright and peaceful, casting a warm glow over the room.

Mabel breathed a sigh of relief. Maybe it had been a nightmare after all. She shook her head, chuckling at herself. ""No, I'm just being paranoid,"" she whispered to herself, though the uneasy feeling still lingered in her chest.

She quickly got dressed, trying to shake off the eerie feeling from the night before. As she made her way downstairs, Dipper greeted her with a smile as he poured himself a cup of coffee.

""Sleep well?"" he asked casually, looking over his shoulder at her.

Mabel hesitated, wondering if she should tell him about what had happened. But as she looked at her brother's innocent face, she couldn't bring herself to say anything. It would just sound too crazy.

""Yeah... I just had a weird dream,"" Mabel said, brushing it off with a forced smile.

Dipper nodded, sipping his coffee. ""Well, you're not the only one. I had this dream where everything at the Mystery Shack turned into a giant escape room, and I had to solve riddles to get out. Weird, huh?""

Mabel chuckled nervously, trying to focus on something else. ""That's... weird. But, you know, classic Dipper stuff. I guess it's time to eat, huh?""

""Yeah! Let's go, I'm starving,"" Dipper said with a grin, leading the way to the kitchen.

As Mabel followed, her mind kept drifting back to the man in the trees. It had to be a dream, she told herself. But if it wasn't...

She quickly pushed the thought aside as she joined Dipper at the table, hoping that whatever had happened the night before was just a figment of her imagination.

But deep down, she couldn't shake the nagging feeling that it wasn't over.

Then from across the parking lot she looks at me and tells “we should totally get coffee sometime”. Again I was like sure of corse! After wards, I started thinking, what was that about. So I text her to see if she was being friendly or genuinely wanted to get coffee sometime. So I text her “hey” and she immediately responds “hey” back, and then onto the conversation of getting coffee again. At first I thought “maybe she was just being friendly” then I realized she didn’t ask anyone else to get coffee, it was only me. Am I reading too much into this or did she ask me out on a date?

I drank coffee there almost daily, sometimes 1-2 times per day. I never drank coffee daily until then. About 2 months into my stay I suffered a really bizarre panic attack, although I do suffer from anxiety i wasn’t anxious at all that day until I drank an espresso. I ended up getting my heart tested there, got wired up to the machine and such. The results came back completely fine, my vitals were healthy. I ended up taking a 2 week long break from caffeine, the results were night and day. I stopped suffering from anxiety and had zero palpitations. When I came back to America I began the habit of drinking frequently again, maybe 1-2 cups a day. 

During my every day workouts now back at home I have zero problems, but whenever I would do a cardio exercise I notice myself getting weird flutters or palpitations then it dissipates and returns to normal after I step aside and take a break.

1hdsyg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1hdsyg0/i_hate_feeling_unwanted/,I Hate Feeling Unwanted,"(This got way longer than what I meant it to, but it just came pouring out, so... TL;DR: I want more than anything to find my special someone to love, but feel like no one wants to love me back.) 

I like girls. I like pretty girls. And I can tell when a girl IS pretty. Pretty, however, was never what drew me in.

The first girl I ever really felt anything special for, I was in middle school. Girl's name was Ashley. I just moved to the little Podunk town in middle America and the second I laid eyes on this girl, I knew there was something special about her. And when I say special, I don't mean the typical, ""Wow, that girl's gorgeous. I wanna see her naked,"" that the teenage boy in me had experienced before. It was... different. It wasn't just a want, but something closer-feeling to a need... like being underwater and not being able to take a breath. Yes, she was pretty, but something about her drew me to her like a moth to a flame. I was in *awe* of her. It almost felt like my life wouldn't be complete without her. There was a feeling of peace and magic that went with her whenever I saw her.

And so what did I do? 

Well, I did what any socially-awkward, Asperger's-diagnosed guy would do in my shoes: Admire her from a distance, and try for years to think of some way to broach my feelings. I fantasized about holding her in my arms and just admiring her while she napped, snuggling with her on cold winter mornings under the covers, and even just listening to her rant about the bad days she'd have, or just anything and anything she'd want to talk about. I just wanted so badly to be in her presence as much as I could be, and even a few seconds each day with or without a word between us was always the highlight of my school day.

In the end, of course, I managed to awkwardly eke out a desperate confession towards the last bit of high school (before we moved away for my senior year), and of course she declined me. Naturally I was devastated. It had been the only girl I ever felt such a way for, and it would be that way for decades after. 

The only other time I made a real attempt to ask another girl out was a girl in my senior year. I didn't have that ""special feeling"" that I'd felt for Ashley before, but everyone I ever knew always resorted to the old ""get back on that horse"" cliche. I'd never shared how deeply I had felt for Ashley before, but I knew that one rejection shouldn't have been any reason to despair. I'd just turned eighteen and we were approaching the end of high school, ready to head off into the open world beyond. I had held onto hope that in the wide world out there someone would find their way into my life and complete my existence.

And yes, I know, I'm an old, sappy romantic.

It was in the middle of spring my senior year when they had started selling carnations as a kind of spring pick-me-up at school. Kids the school over were buying them and decorating the school, book bags, sport fields, etc. with them. This girl I'd gotten to know a little (can't even remember her name now) was by no means special, but I liked spending time with her and wanted to try breaking out of my isolation again. I had bought her one of these carnations -- prettiest one I could find. That's when I approached her with it.

I didn't even get a word in when she saw me approaching with that flower in my hand before she burst out laughing and ran for the nearest exit -- in front of God, the world, and everyone else. Needless to say, the normally-rowdy halls got real quiet real quick, and all those eyes had only me to turn to.

I have never again experienced such humiliation or trauma.

Through my brief few years in college I never approached any girl ever again, what with that horrifying moment to haunt me for the rest of my days. I had put the thought of love and affection and ever having a partner that I could give my heart to entirely out of my mind. Or, I did until a particular class assignment in my Creative Writing course.

I don't have the piece I wrote anymore, but it had been a short story about whatever subject we wanted, so long as it was something we were passionate about. The goal was to stir the instructor's emotions with our craft, so I wrote about the only thing I really ever felt any passion about.

After that assignment, the instructor had taken me aside and asked if I had ever been hurt by my feelings for someone before. He had been able to tell from the piece I'd done that I'd not been particularly fortunate in that arena. He did tell me, though, that it was his opinion that if one could just pour the words onto paper of how they felt for someone, that one could tell if they were truly in love with a person. I hadn't really thought about it to that point, but when he mentioned this, I realized I had put a lot of what I had felt about Ashley on the page, if only to change the names and circumstances around. Even so, the emotions were there, and that's when I kind of figured out that, somewhere along the line, I had fallen head-over-heels in love with Ashley, and that was what had hurt so badly about her rejection.

Past that point, however, as I passed out of college and moved on with life, I found myself more and more isolated once again. I had purposefully forgotten as much as I could about Ashley and everything she'd ever made me feel. For all intents and purposes, I thought I had finally put that chapter of my life to bed and could move on, and I had -- up until a few months ago.

The first time I laid eyes on this girl at work -- we'll call her ""Dee"" -- it was like a riptide of nostalgia had come out of nowhere and pulled my feet right out from under me. Everything I had ever felt for Ashley before suddenly came flooding back as I almost swore I saw her ghost for a moment. Dee carried that same peaceful and pleasant aura with her with every step she took. She was pretty yes, but she was oh-so-much-more than that, somehow.

And, like the reboot of an old series, I suddenly felt that same desire as before -- I *needed* to know her. I had to meet her. My heart and every fiber of my being wanted to be immersed in her presence and just... *be.*

Now, for a while, I managed to resist. I have grown a lot since my youth, I've matured, and I immediately put a firm damper on myself, partly out of fear, and partly out of self-defense probably. I told myself even without knowing that she had to have a boyfriend or husband. She won't stop or talk or introduce herself. She's not interested. She's not in the market. She's out of your league. Etc., etc., ad infinitum. Anything and everything to try and kill it in the cradle. I didn't want to go through what I'd felt before because *to this* *day, all these years later,* I still bear the scars from my previous attempts, and that pain of rejection never really heals, especially when you've only felt such desire once.

Of course, however, no matter how hard I tried to tell myself otherwise, no matter how badly I wanted to convince myself that I would dearly regret it. I knew it would only end in heartbreak. But as I kept learning little things about her -- I accidentally passed by her desk one day and happened to learn her name, a coworker would mention her in passing, the two of us would share a ""hi"" as she would walk past my desk occasionally. We would never say much, but like before, every little moment I ever got to spend just in her presence, whether we would exchange words or not, were always the best, brightest part of my otherwise lonely and largely-meaningless days. Even my good days were only made even better when I saw her, and the sharpest edges of my worst ones were smoothed over when I would imagine her leaning on my shoulder, stroking my hair and just being with me.

Like a dam can hold back only so much water, though, I could only keep back how I felt for so long before Mother Nature's fucking curse finally won out.

It had been twenty years since I had previously approached a girl. Needless to say, in spite of all my practice and teaching myself how to ""act normal"" around others through the years, I had next to none in trying to approach a girl that my heart so badly wanted. The first time I remember giving in and speaking with her was rather impromptu. Though one of my coworkers had introduced us before, I had never really attempted to strike up an actual conversation with Dee before. That changed when I had asked her how her weekend had been the Monday after. Her answer of what amounted to ""meh"" was like a fuse being lit. I managed to hold my tongue the first time, but as we passed by later that day, I (rather awkwardly -- even *very* awkwardly) made the suggestion that if she wanted to do something together, maybe we could go to Cars and Coffee of a Saturday morning together.

Trying to think logically at the time, I had made the suggestion to try and introduce a bit of myself and my interests, while also hoping she would agree so perhaps we could spend a bit of time together doing something fun. (I'm quite old-fashioned, so I'd like to try and get to know someone to know they are who they seem to be before trying to enter into a proto-relationship.) Dee rather... awkwardly agreed (""Yeahsure!) before quickly turning away and heading back towards her desk.

In hindsight, that should have been my first hint to slam on the brakes -- strike one. Instead, of course, trying to remain hopeful, I put it in the ""ball"" column. After all, maybe she had been in a hurry, right? She could have been busy that day. She didn't necessarily feel weirded out by my out-of-the-blue proposal that *certainly* didn't come across as a completely idiotic attempt to ask her out completely at random.

Surely! :eyeroll:

Now, I work closely with a manager, my supervisor, whom he and I are kind of casually acquainted at this point. I didn't really have anyone else to talk to about this sort of thing, but (we'll call him) ""Jay"" had mentioned that he didn't think she was seeing anyone. I had mentioned Dee in passing before, so he had an idea of what was on my mind. As Dee was passing by my desk later in the week, I'd had some time to reflect on what I had said and wanted to have a chance to clarify. In the past, I had confided with Jay how I felt -- how Dee was the light of my day, and how I only wanted her to look in my direction and see me. With his encouragement and him describing the joy of ""seeing their face light up"", I had finally worked up enough courage to try to have a moment with her. I had asked her in passing if she would mind if we talked a moment after she came back from where she was going.

You can probably guess, at this point, she never *did* come back to talk, and that felt like a body blow in itself.

Strike, the second.

It was the following week when I'd pulled myself together enough to try and came up with more excuses for why she hadn't come back. (Are you seeing the despair and desperation in my thought patterns yet? I know I'm pathetic, so no need to remind me.) One particular day that week I'd had to step out at lunch for a dental appointment, so my thought was that I would ask as I was leaving if she would be interested in going and grabbing a bite to eat together sometime.

""I don't think so.""

That should have been strike three. I should have stopped the bleeding, cut my losses, and walked away right then and there. Should have. And, if I were wired differently maybe, I most certainly would have, just to try and avoid the real rejection that I knew would come if I didn't give up. For several weeks after I distanced myself, trying desperately to get out of this self-destructive spiral I was in. No matter what I tried, no matter how much I tried to find anything I could to free myself from her gravity, Dee stayed on my mind, and I couldn't break free. I still wanted her as badly as I ever had before, and I knew that probably would never change.

The lovesick fool in me, however, and whatever is fucked up in my head wouldn't let go of it, though. I remember happening to hold the door open for her one morning -- I had forgotten my badge and had to get the parking code to get into the garage. She had just so happened to enter as I was going out to my car to move it from the customer lot when she smiled at me and said a simple, ""Thanks, Anon (me).""

It felt like I was hooked all over again. No matter how many times I screamed internally that she just was saying thank you for the courtesy, my curse simply refused to die no matter what unhinged thing I tried to conjure up to kill it.

It was a while longer before I acted again. I finally managed to wrest back a little bit of my logic, and again I was trying to keep it buried and respect her space and what I presumed to be her decision. I knew what I needed was distance, time, and isolation from her, and I kept as much of it as I could for quite a while. I'm not sure what sparked it, but one day as I was passing by Dee's desk to retrieve some supplies, I mentioned in passing a funny story that happened that morning to me, when I had missed a patch of hair during my morning grooming. She wound up laughing a bit and we had a brief conversation. She didn't seem offended by my presence, and I was simply over the moon to feel like I might have broken the ice a little.

Dee, however, was simply playing it cool, as I would later find out.

I would tell her again the next day how the guys at game night had reacted to my story and the nickname ""Patches"" that they had given me, and how they joked that I looked ""mangy"". Again, she seemed somewhat amused, and even a bit interested in my gaming group. Again, I felt like maybe I was finally letting her see through to the real, more open part of me that I had struggled so long with. I didn't go over to visit every day, lest I come across as suffocating, and I always kept in the back of my mind that we were acquaintances at best, but whether I wanted it or not, an ember of hope still flickered within me that maybe she would come to like me for me.

It was shortly before the holiday when I had started letting my thoughts run away with my heart again, and I was watching a psychology video that had popped up on how to recognize your feelings for what they are. For whatever reason, the video took me back to my college writing course, and I had sat down out of curiosity again to see what I could pen when I thought of Dee. Like before, when I had thought of Ashley, the words just flowed from my fingertips and onto the page. In a single evening I had composed a poem longer than any I ever had in my life, rhymes and all. I spent hours tweaking a word here, rearranging passages there, and only at the end of it did I really understand that I had fallen in love with this girl who I barely even knew.

It felt like a weight was lifted off my chest when I finally decided to admit it to myself. ""I'm in love with this girl, and I would blissfully spend every moment of the rest of my life to try to make her feel as happy and as precious and as loved as humanly possible."" 

Don't even ask me how I could possibly feel this way if I barely knew the first thing about her -- I don't know how it works myself. I don't know if my desperation and loneliness conspired together to convince me I was, maybe I just convinced myself with the smoldering ruins of what remained of my optimism, or maybe it was even some kind of spiritual draw or something else beyond comprehension. At the risk of coming across as a little stalker-y, all I knew in that moment was that I would have given anything for someone to feel the same way I felt about Dee about me. I cannot begin to describe how badly all my life I have needed someone to care about me that way. I was smitten by this puppy love-like feeling, and I so badly wanted my partner to some day be her.

As the holiday drew closer I began to have thoughts about how I could best express myself. How could I show her what she had inexplicably come to mean to me? I've known a long time now that I best communicate in *any* manner other than spoken word, and the written one has always been a far superior  talent of mine. Again, being the old-fashioned lame-ass sap that I am, I immediately turned to the thought of hand-writing out the perfected version of the poem I had written while thinking of Dee. I wanted my efforts just as much as my words to express just how much and how highly I thought of her and how much happiness just thinking about her brought me, just like the poets of yore. In their spirit, I had planned to purchase a piece of parchment and artificially age it with a lighter and practice the art of calligraphy. I was eying a beautiful red satin lace ribbon to tie the letter together in a heart shape, and was searching for a unique long-stem rose to slip into the rolled sheet and present it to her later that next month for the upcoming Christmas and New Year holiday.

Now, in our workplace, some secret individuals had begun leaving little ""critters"" hidden about the office to find as kind of a fun little morale booster. I wasn't interested in the collecting, just the hunt, and I had helped my coworkers amass quite a collection each. At some point, however, I had heard through the grapevine that Dee was trying to collect some of these critters and I had happened to find one while away from my desk. I had tried to Secret Santa it to her by leaving it on the edge of her desk without being seen. Then, a few hours later, towards the end of the day, I heard a gentle knocking at my desk. My heart skipped a beat at first when I saw Dee standing there, holding that figurine that I had gifted her. Some foolish part of me thought in that moment that maybe she had come to express gratitude for the gift. And then, the words came.

""I am *not* interested.""

And for all the gleaming, warm, happy dreams I had built in my mind for months of what a life of love, compassion, care, and warmth might be like, it all evaporated instantly in a burning cloud of ash and ruin. The only reply I could even muster as ice filled my veins was a meager and pathetic little, ""Sorry for bothering you."" I'd never felt so small and worthless and unwanted and insignificant in my entire life. I've never experienced despair and depression this dark and deep before. The warm and happy dreams I had become accustomed to for those few months were replaced by being alone in that hallway holding out that refused carnation to empty air and those judging eyes on me all over again. All of my ""what ifs"" turned into ""why bothers"", and that glimmer of hope that I had that maybe one day I would find that one light in this otherwise-darkening world went out forever.

I don't know if anyone has ever experienced something like I've gone through. I'd like to think that I'm not the only one left these days who has put their entire life's highest hopes in finding that love that lasts a lifetime and just brightens the entire world around you. I don't know what's wrong with me and why I can't let go of things I know are out of my reach. I wish I could just turn it off and live more like a truly normal person, rather than this sad, lonely, and miserable excuse for an existence. I don't know what else worthwhile life has to offer outside of loving someone, but it's the one thing I held on a pedestal above all else. I always believed it was the greatest thing anyone could ever aspire to in life was to give yourself to someone, body, mind, and spirit.

Now I just don't know what's left anymore. I don't know if anyone ever bothers to read a post this size, but I have no one to talk to about it, and I just wanted to find somewhere to vent my emotions where maybe someone out there might have some idea what I'm feeling. I just wanted to feel seen for a moment.",1,1734143556.0,Vent,0,1.0,False

1hdsx30,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hdsx30,Liquid AIO performance decreased after only a Year and a Half,"So back in July 2023 I bought an MSI Mag CoreLiquid 280R AIO and installed it on my setup. I regularly run some routine tests on my pc once in a while in order to check its running state and make sure everything’s always ok. Yesterday I ran a multi core stress test on cinebech while monitoring temps and noticed all of the 6 cores of my 9600k reaching 100 degrees Celsius almost immediately (like 3/4 seconds after starting the test). I’ve found a picture of the temps I took a couple of days after  installing the AIO in 2023 while I was testing the cpu overclocked at 5.0 GHz, temps were stable at 85 degrees while running the same cinebench test back in the day. Anyway that same day I ended up clocking it down to 4.8 due to slight instability caused by some voltage drops at 5.0 GHz and I’ve been running that overclock since then with no problems whatsoever. So it’s clear that the AIO isn’t performing as it should after just 1.5 years of work.
I checked the AIO temps by touching it, everything seems to function as intended; one tube is hot while the other one is cooler, I feel the water flowing and hear the pump functioning, however there’s one anomaly, the radiator gets partially hot and the rest remains cold to the touch. The only parts I’m feeling significantly hot are the ones on the top edge of the radiator where the hot liquid “intake” is, then it gradually feels cooler while sliding my hand downward (I’ll include a pic of how the radiator is mounted to make sure you understand what I’m talking about) also basically all parts of the radiator heatsink feel cold as ice except the part where the pump is mounted.
I’ve read that this specific model of AIO from msi suffered some severe clogging problems for a lot of users. What do you think the issue could be? Just some air bubbles or a clogged radiator?

P.S. the first pic is the temps back in 2023 with the cpu clocked at 5.0 GHz while the other one was taken today with the cpu clocked at 4.8 GHz

Often speak too fast and often. During any season.

It’s annoying because I was told that’s normal for everyone.

Cycling through codes and thoughts in a hurry.

Who end up doing nothing but translate.

Obviously that must mean the days all end the same for them

As they sit in their stiff backed chairs watching the smoke 

Burn from their cigarette.

 

Selfishly I believe they try to add dimension to their lives by reading poetry.

And they smile when it’s about colorful women and unorthodox parallels about humanity.

However, they enjoy them the most when the poems are about selfish desire and unfortunate loneliness.

***One:***

An awful, ungodly stench struck Charlie the moment he opened the creaking front door of the nearly abandoned apartment complex. He winced, reflexively jerking his face away from the entryway so that his lungs might find new air. The thief’s chest audibly rattled as he voraciously sucked in the atmosphere outside the doorway, hand still gripping the brass doorknob. Curious, Theo leaned into the building, inhaling a sample of the escaping vapors. With a chastising shake of his head, he exhaled, chuckling as he did. The younger of the two thieves ducked under Charlie’s arm and pushed forward, seizing the opportunity emasculate his colleague’s fragile sensibilities - teasing him for being so dumbstruck by an aroma. However, Theo’s chronic sinusitis had diminished his sense of smell, unbeknownst to his older colleague. So, despite Theo being able to detect the potent aroma, it was unable to restrain him like it did Charlie.

Theo admired Charlie as a mentor and felt a hint of jealousy towards him, so he found satisfaction in having something to hold over his head. His untimely demise in one of these flats would prevent Theo from ever disclosing this admiration.

“*C’mon now, old man. No time to stop and smell the roses,*” Theo mocked, now leisurely strolling down the narrow, dimly lit lobby.

He wanted to move himself along, imaging himself running ahead to overtake Theo. But Charlie could not force his body through the partition and further into the corrosive scent, the intensity of which continued to increase as more stale air poured from the dilapidated building. Charlie struggled to identify what exactly could produce such a foul odor. It was acrid and gamey, reminiscent of meat spoiled in the summer sun; but at the same time, it also had a metallic and artificial quality, similar to the inside of a bustling factory. Stagnant, putrefied water closely resembled the stench, he considered, but it didn’t quite match.

Instead of following Theo in, Charlie raised a defiant middle finger as he bent over to retrieve the Vicks Vaporub from his backpack. From somewhere further down the hallway, he heard his partner flippantly squawk about Charlie’s feminine constitution. As he listened to the continued goading, Charlie could not fathom how Theo had developed such a bravado. The man was nearly as broke as he him, he had no girlfriend, and he carted around a body shaped like a neglected pear, one that had sat in the fruit bowl for a few too many days - rotting and sagging in all the wrong places. With Theo somehow *still* chattering on, Charlie sighed and smeared the waxy material over the crest of his upper lip as a barrier against the assaulting odor.

He wasn’t much better in comparison, though, Charlie lamented to himself. Gaunt and skeletal, he stood at a monstrous six foot seven inches. Though potentially commanding, his great height was offset by a total absence of muscle. Last time he checked, his weight clocked in at just shy of one hundred and twenty pounds. If Theo resembled a decaying pear, Charlie embodied an anemic popsicle stick. Perhaps, he mused, he and Theo were actually a perfect match - both objects that had well outlived their usefulness and only truly belonged at the heart of a landfill.

He at least possessed some companionship, he reflected, however meager it may be. Charlie could not stand the notion of being truly, utterly alone. He had grown to avoid it at all costs.

Protected from the disabling scent, Charlie took a beat to more thoroughly survey the street. Not that there was that much to see. The area was completely deserted and dilapidated, devoid of any sign of human habitation. That wasn’t always the case, though. Lutzwater boulevard used to represent the cornerstone of the city’s downtown, with this apartment complex acting as the linchpin that held it all together. Charlie relocated from the suburbs to the city at age ten, and could remember well the awe that the street’s opulence and glamour inspired when he rode his bike past with friends. A lot can change in thirty years, though. What remained was a mere shadow of what this place had once been. The many competing taverns and night clubs closed, the rowhomes that once contained up-and-coming senators and actors were derelict, and Lutzwater Heights, the nexus of it all, was almost empty. Only the son of the original owners, Christian, still resided inside, at least according to Theo’s contact.

Charlie didn’t let his eyes linger on any one part of Lutzwater boulevard for too long. The destruction was just too depressing, and in a certain sense, symbolic - the beauty of life and the promise of abundance in childhood turning to ash and shit as he aged.

One tiny piece of the deteriorating scenery, however, did strike Charlie in a way that gave him pause - it was something he had never noticed before. At its peak, Lutzwater Heights showcased an immaculately groomed front garden. Ochre and lavender flowers lined the entrance, greeting longtime residents, guests, and prospective residents of the prestigious building with an equal enthusiasm. Similar to the surrounding area, the garden had devolved into an abandoned wasteland, consisting only of overgrown shrubs and discarded liquor bottles. Close to his location at the stoop of the building, on the edge of the dead garden, however, sat a well that he did not recognize. He rode past the apartment complex thousands of times during his youth, and somehow never noticed the stone hatch with the accompanying wooden frame and bucket before now. The object’s presence was jarring against the backdrop of the dilapidated, contemporary architecture - and it would have been *even more* out of place when the location was at its prime. Now, it was able to partially conceal its uncanniness among the ruins. But thirty years ago, a pillory or a telephone booth sprouting out of the garden would have been less conspicuous than the well.

That said, it couldn’t have been new. To Charlie, that was infinitely more incomprehensible.

Another whiff of the horrible aroma broke his trance and reoriented Charlie to his current purpose on Lutzwater boulevard; Christian Lutzwater and his theoretical wealth. With information passed along from another career criminal, Theo believed there was a fortune hidden somewhere in the bubbling carcass of what *used* to be Lutzwater Heights, despite his parent’s real estate ventures going up in financial flames after their abrupt and cryptic disappearance over two decades ago.

*No idea how he could live with this fucking smell*, Charlie thought, zipping his bag and placing the Vaporub in his coat pocket, assuming correctly that he would need to reapply the wax a few more times during their scheduled security system consultation/covert casing of the building and their target. Before following Theo into Lutzwater Heights, he rummaged through his wallet for coins to throw down the well, seeking to obtain good fortune from the pagan deities who might be able to affect the outcome of their so-called business venture. Without looking away from the inside of his wallet, he stood up and began to pace towards the well.

Unexpectedly, a sharp pain crackled from his big toe and radiated through his foot. Not paying attention, Charlie had slammed his boot into the well’s hard stone mid-stride. Apparently, he had misjudged his distance between the stoop, himself, and the well. Charlie felt sure that it had been a meter away, at least it had been before he started searching for coins, but the new throbbing discomfort sincerely disagreed with his previous assessment.

Apparently, the well was practically next to him.

Absentmindedly, he tossed the coins into the abyss without gazing into its inky depths. But as he did, pain and confusion had sidetracked his intended wish. Seeing Theo turn a corner and disappear from view, his mind was instead dragged back to its more fundamental concern as he provided the well with its tithe.

With his subconscious behind the wheel, Charlie wished to never be alone again.

As soon as the coins were swallowed by the blackness, the well instantly began to exude the ungodly odor, like fumes exploding from an exhaust pipe. Charlie didn’t understand what had changed, but he the let vapors propel him into action, finally sprinting to catch up with Theo. As he entered Lutzwater Heights, Charlie thought he heard the metal clink against the well’s bottom, but there was something off about that, too. The sound he heard wasn’t exactly that of a handful of coins briefly clattering against stone. Instead, a sort of quiet but frantic skittering emanated from somewhere in the darkness, like thousands of human nails tapping nervously against chalk - almost in perfect synchrony, but not quite.

\----------------------------------------------

***Two:***

Christian Lutzwater looked profoundly unwell. Huge, dark half-moons shadowed the flesh below his eyes, pulling his face down so much that he appeared unshakably joyless, the resulting creases injecting a deep gloom into every facial expression he could manifest. By Theo’s estimation, the man was only forty years old, but his emaciated cheeks and greying comb-over could have given anyone the impression that he was, at best, pushing sixty. Despite those features, his well-pressed, blue pin-stripe suit and solid black tie indicated he was still interested in appearances. At the kitchen table in the building’s largest suite, situated at the very back of the third floor, the thieves watched as Christian humbly brewed them a pot of coffee. As he did, Charlie clandestinely scanned the area, determining where they could install a remote camera or two when he wasn’t paying attention.

*“So…where do you need the cameras? In the entrance, the alleyways…?* Theo paused, hoping Christian would pick up where he left off.

Despite not being an employee at Charlie’s security agency, Theo seemed to enjoy steering the consultations, occasionally giving the impression to their soon-to-be victims that he ran the company or that security was a family business he grew up in. In actuality, Theo didn’t know the first thing about installing security systems. Yet, his self-assured manner brought the trust of their targets more often than it didn’t.

As long as Theo successfully pulled off the his part in the robberies while wearing the uniform Charlie stole for him, he happily relinquished control. Time and time again, the blueprint worked. From Charlie’s perspective, why mess with a good thing just to feed his ego?

The operation was both clever and profitable. The thieves would steal from their marks a few days *prior* to installing the purchased security systems, which helped them avoid suspicion. It was a simple and easy to execute plan: they would attend consultations with their marks, confirm that they had valuable belongings and no preexisting security measures, and then they would strike. The marks suspected their wealth needed better monitoring - that’s why they had reached out to Charlie’s company in the first place, so it was no surprise when a burglary actually came to pass. After many of their targets were robbed, their only lingering regret was that they had not called Theo and Charlie sooner, as they imagined a security system may have been able to prevent the financial losses.

*“There are several sewer grates around the periphery of the property, a majority of them near the parking lot, ""* Christian remarked matter-of-factly.

*“I need them all covered by a remote video feed that I can have access to.”*

Theo, for all his virtues, did not have a talent for improvisation, and Christian’s answer had caught him off-guard. Stunned and at a loss, Theo turned to Charlie for help.

*“…I’m not sure that will cover the front gate or the entrance, Mr. Lutzwater.”* Charlie mumbled, who was also recovering from the overwhelming strangeness of his original response.

*Who the hell would try to enter the complex through the fucking sewers?*

From across the kitchen table, Christian set his pallid gaze on Charlie, visibly upset by the insinuation that he didn’t know what he wanted. He was not accustomed to being questioned by anyone, let alone by some blue-collar nobody. Slowly, however, his expression melted from righteous indignation back to its baseline, sorrowful state. Only after a short time did Mr. Lutzwater grasp that his request could be seen as outlandish to anyone unaware of what writhed within his apartment complex.

Without breaking eye contact with Charlie, he slowly conjured a synthetic grin to his face, the corners of his mouth seemingly held up and in position by imperceptible marionette strings.

*“Of course, the entrance will need to be monitored as well. I mentioned the sewer grates first because we’ve had local children spraying graffiti on those areas - seems like I can’t get it off my mind,”* he replied, following the statement with a mechanical chuckle and a sip of his coffee.

Feeling like the flow of conversation was back on track, Theo eagerly returned to the fold.

*“You sure you don’t want a camera for your apartment, too? Can never be too safe with gangs of delinquents roaming the streets,”* Theo proclaimed with a toothy smile.

*“Oh, I don’t live here, young man. I visit the property daily to make sure everything is still somewhat maintained, but I…but I certainly don’t sleep here.”*

A subtle tremor of fear creeped into Christian’s voice when he implied he would *never* spend the night at Lutzwater Heights. Not only did the prospect of sleeping here scare him, but it appeared like he believed he said something that he should not have. He abruptly shifted the conversation to finalizing his order. After signing the agreement, he excused himself to the restroom, allowing Charlie the opportunity to plant a small camera into the kitchen’s smoke detector.

*“Okay gentleman,”* Christian proclaimed as he returned from the bathroom, sitting down across from Charlie as he did, *“I believe we have negotiated the first part of the deal…”*

“*What other parts are there, sir?”* Charlie interjected. Mr. Lutzwater had already signed and paid for the security system. The older thief turned to his left, looking to see if his younger compatriot understood what Christian meant. But he was not at the table. Charlie darted his head wildly around its axis, trying to locate where Theo had gotten off to. Just moments before, he’d been beside Charlie, yet there had been no sounds of a chair scraping or Theo’s footsteps to suggest he’d left the table while he was briefly distracted by Mr. Lutzwater’s return.

When Charlie’s gaze found its way back to Christian, terror bloomed thick and ravenous deep within his chest. His pulse quickened, blood vibrating ferociously through his entire body. He blinked over and over again, but the image in front of him did not change.

Without warning, Mr. Lutzwater’s face has evolved into something else entirely.

*“You know what I mean, Charlie. How many times have we had this conversation? I need your answer. I need your answer now.”*

The phrase seeped listlessly out of one Christian’s new cavities. All of his facial features had been replaced by three oval slits, overflowing with impenetrable, inky darkness. Two vertical slits run parallel to each other over the top two-thirds of his skull, with one horizontal slit laying flatly under the both of them on the bottom third. The steel-blue skin in between the holes was smooth and blemishless, but it appeared dangerously taut, like a plastic bag that had been filled to brim and was primed to split and rupture at any moment - or, maybe, that tightness had already caused the skin to break, resulting in the three slits that were currently staring at him.

Charlie’s aching psyche interpreted the slits as a face, but they looked just as much like the holes in a power outlet as they did two long eyes and one even longer mouth. Yes, language had come from it, but the words had not emanated from his so-called ""mouth"". Instead, the statement leaked out of what Charlie assumed was Christian’s new left eye, causing the crevasse to widen slightly and tremble as it did.

*“You made your request - a cure for loneliness. That is something we can provide, but at a cost. We will want the first of your bloodline, as payment for our generosity.”*

*“I…I…”* Charlie blubbered.

In response to his indecision, all three slits began to ripple soundlessly, like a frustrated scream imperceptible to Charlie was being unleashed from all three orifices simultaneously.

Every night since the consultation, he had experienced the same nightmare. It always started as a memory, a replaying of events, but inevitably culminated with Christian’s transformation. But this was first one where he had actually answered the question. All the times before, the vision ended before he had made a decision.

For the remaining three days prior to the heist, Charlie’s sleep would be barren and nightmareless, but it would not be restful.

In that last nightmare, he agreed to the terms.

\------------

Each day, Theo checked the hidden camera’s recorded feed. In doing so, he determined that there may be something valuable secretly stored within the third-floor suite. In addition, he had confirmed that no one else currently lived inside Lutzwater Heights. No room had been rented out for at least half a decade.

Christian was not lying when he claimed that he visited the premises daily. Every day, about an hour before sundown like clockwork, Mr. Lutzwater would enter the apartment. Without wasting a second, he would pace over urgently to a painting on the wall. He would pull it aside, revealing that it was connected to the wall on a hinge. Because of the camera’s position, it was impossible to discern what lay beyond the painting; the camera’s angle hid that view. However, Christian very clearly took a key that hung around his neck, inserted it into something on the wall, and then reached in to the wall. To Theo, that meant there must be cash, jewelry, or something similarly worth our trouble concealed in that space.

Charlie squinted at the footage proudly displayed by Theo from his old and well-worn laptop. Something caught his eye that the younger thief had neglected to mention.

His lips were moving.

*“Who do you think he’s talking to?”* Charlie asked, praying that Theo had a good explanation.

*“Oh…uh…he’s probably on a call. Bluetooth or something,”* Theo replied while scratching the side of his head, clearly unbothered by the finding.

*“Hm. Yeah, I guess that makes sense.”* Charlie halfheartedly remarked, lying mostly to himself in that moment. There was no evidence to back-up Theo’s deduction. Christian didn’t appear to have ear buds in, nor did he ever take out a phone to indicate he was taking a call, and whenever he was in that apartment, his lips were *always* moving.

But the camera never caught anyone else in that apartment, Charlie told himself.

Theo must be right.

company. You hustle, grind, and soon enough, your business takes off like a rocket. Next thingyou know, you’re a billionaire. But dealing with Chinese regulations? Yeah, no thanks. Youdecide to relocate the entire company to a small, obscure European island. Why? Because it’sfar from the prying eyes of government regulators.

With your company booming, you become one of the richest people in the world, with more than$60 billion to your name. That’s right, billions. And as if that wasn’t enough, your customers loveyou. Not just for your product, but for your personality. You become a public figure, a financialrock star, with more Twitter followers than Billie Eilish. Think about that for a second: a financialCEO is outpacing one of the biggest pop stars on social media. Your power? Unmatched.You’ve got the world in the palm of your hand—money, fame, influence. You’re untouchable. Orat least, you think you are.

But there’s one tiny detail you overlooked. In 1970, the US government passed a law, the BankSecrecy Act, that forces every financial company to act as a spy-arm for them. By law, you'resupposed to track every American citizen’s financial transactions and report them to the feds.And if you don’t? Well, let’s just say Uncle Sam doesn’t like it when you don’t play by his rules.But here’s the thing: you're not American. Neither is your company. So, logically, none of thisshould matter to you, right?

Wrong. Despite not being American, despite your company not operating on US soil, the long
arm of the US government doesn’t care. You're too powerful, too influential, and you can’t just
dodge Uncle Sam that easily.

One day, without warning, you're sitting in your luxury villa on your private island, sipping yourimported coffee, when you get a call. It’s not a business call. It’s not even a PR call. It’s a legalcall. The US government has indicted you for violating their financial laws—laws that you didn’teven think applied to you.

You laugh it off at first. I mean, you don’t even live in the US! But then it gets real. Your assets inUS banks? Frozen. Your ability to travel freely? Gone. And before you know it, you're detainedat an airport in Seattle during a business trip, caught by U.S. authorities who were waiting foryou.

Suddenly, all that wealth, all that power, means nothing. You're escorted to prison like some
common criminal, facing charges for not playing ball with the government’s surveillancemachine. And here’s the kicker: it doesn’t matter that your company was based offshore. Itdoesn’t matter that you weren’t American. If you so much as touched a dollar in their system,you’re under their thumb.

In the end, it didn’t matter how rich, powerful, or distant you thought you were. The USgovernment is the ultimate power broker, and when they decide to come for you, nothing canprotect you.",0,1734142432.0,CryptoCurrency,6,0.5,False

1hdsie5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hdsie5/aita_for_wanting_to_breakup_because_i_feel_like_i/,AITA for wanting to breakup because I feel like I can do better?,"I (24F) have been dating my boyfriend “A” (25M) for two years, and while I love him deeply, I’ve recently started questioning whether I’m settling. My parents, who have always been supportive of me, have expressed doubts about our relationship, saying A isn’t “good enough” for me. I brushed it off at first, but now I’m wondering if they’re right.

For some context, I work in investment banking and earn about $200k a year. I went to an Ivy League school, worked hard my whole life, and never took money from my parents. I’m proud of where I am and how I’ve built my life from the ground up. A and I met volunteering at a dog adoption center—he was so sweet and gentlemanly, and I fell for him almost immediately. But as the relationship has gone on, some cracks have started to show.

Here are the main issues:

	1.	Finances: A is currently working part-time at a coffee shop and doesn’t have stable income. When we go on dates, we always split the bill, and I don’t mind paying for myself sometimes, but it feels like I have to do it because he can’t afford to treat me. My dad once said, “A can’t afford to be in a relationship,” and while it’s harsh, I can’t help but feel a little resentful when I compare this to past relationships where I was taken out and treated.

	2.	Living situation: A still lives with two roommates in a small shared apartment and doesn’t have plans to move out anytime soon. I suggested we move in together, but he said he couldn’t afford rent or groceries on his own. It’s made me question how we could ever build a life together when I feel like I’d have to take on all the financial responsibility.

	3.	Social circle: A’s friends are lovely people, but they’re not particularly ambitious. They spend most of their time gaming, hanging out, or watching sports. I’ve tried to engage with them, but I’ve never had a deep or interesting conversation with any of them. I just don’t feel inspired or challenged by the people A surrounds himself with.

	4.	Resentment: I’ve started to feel resentful about how much I’ve had to lower my expectations. The gifts he gives me, while thoughtful, are things like secondhand books or handmade crafts. I appreciate the sentiment, but it’s hard not to compare it to my ex-boyfriend Liam, who planned surprise trips and gave me meaningful, high-quality gifts.

	5.	Values: A is indifferent about education, which is hard for me to understand. He didn’t finish college and doesn’t think it’s important. When we talk about our future kids, he says things like, “They don’t need to go to college if they don’t want to,” which clashes with how much I value academic achievement.

Despite all this, A is the kindest, most loving person I’ve ever been with. He treats me with so much respect and makes me feel safe and cared for. I love him deeply, but I can’t shake the feeling that I’ve worked so hard to build my life and deserve to be with someone who’s on the same “level.”

I’m torn. Does this make me shallow or materialistic? AITA for questioning the relationship?",1,1734142081.0,AITAH,15,0.67,False

Yes, we broke up last friday. this whole week i was at the hospital and her cat died so we did talk to each other a bit about these crazy sad things happening. 

But i still dont know if i should see her. When we broke up both of us said that we dont want to break up but later during that call she kept pressuring me to break up and encouraged me to move on from her so that i could focus and work on myself. I kept trying to save it offering her ways to talk through/work out our issues and work together. She kept refusing.

I cant make someone work on things if they dont want to. So i agreed to a break up because all i offered and all i said how i feel about her was not enough and i cant fight alone. Then she kept telling me that she is scared if we break up i will never talk to her again or i wont want to date her again or see her romantically. Which is such a weird thing to say and ask since she just pushed for a break up. 

Tbh i still feel hurt that i put all of myself out there and tried to work everything out but she completely shut me down and kept repeating that i need to fix myself and get better mentally and physically because how i am now is “exhausting” for her. I know i have some mental difficulties rn but im seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist. I did think i was getting better but she basically told me that im getting sicker and sicker and that she cant take it anymore. That also hurt me. Even if im not super good i still put her as my priority always making time to see her, get her flowers, talk to her non stop, run to her at night when she cant fall asleep etc. 

I really think i put my everything in this girl and now i just feel exhausted and let down that she is running away when i have a harder period and as she says “its not fun anymore” and “that im a downer”. which is smth you dont say to someone with a depression…

Anyway i still love her and i want to know what she has to say or why she want to see me. but idk if i should. this week i already had hard time being at the hospital and crying almost every day about her not wanting to fight for us. Im scared that seeing her will affect me and give me more stress since im trying to accept the break up and very slowly adjust to a life without her (which is so hard for me). but again, i dont want to live with a regret and not knowing what is it that she wants.

My friend told me, that she wanted to break up but couldnt do it thats why she pressured me to do it. And now she is texting me just to see if she still has a hold of me and if i will run back to her when she suddenly changes her mind or gets bored.

That you had ended up somewhere that requires making turns and stops, but you can't really remember making those turns or stops. You just suddenly realize, holy shit, I'm driving.  Well, that's how it started. 

 I was on my way home from college for the holidays. It was a drive I had made half a dozen times at this point. So, naturally I had become pretty familiar with the road. My mind was somewhere a million miles away, when I finally noticed the road ahead of me. I looked down at my hands on the steering wheel, I had been gripping it like a vice. The clock on my dash read 12:00 AM.  

“Shit.” How long had I been driving on auto pilot? I tried to remember but my mind felt so groggy. The last thing I could remember was flying down the road, jamming out to paranoid by black sabbath. Now though, nothing looked familiar. I was seriously tired, I needed to stop and get an energy drink or something. I looked further on up the road but beyond the headlights was just pure blackness, hopefully there would be a gas station or something within the next few miles, I seriously needed a pick me up. 

After a few more miles, and no sign of civilization I began to wonder where the hell I actually was. I should have been on Highway 9, which was the last stretch before I made it back home. At least that's where I thought I should have been. But, the farther I drove, the longer the empty darkness went on, the more convinced I became that somewhere along the way I had made a wrong turn. 

I reached into my pocket for my phone, but it wasn't there. Confused, I began to search around the inside of my car, but all I could see was a few discarded food wrappers and a half drank bottle of Gatorade. I decided to pull over and search for the little black dependency brick. I had never been very navigationally inclined. Honestly, I think I depend on google maps entirely too much, but right now I didn't care. I was lost and needed directions. After about 5 minutes of scrounging around under the seats and between the center console, I realized my phone was gone. I had no idea where I had lost it, maybe I had left it back at my dorm or maybe it fell out of my pocket somewhere, I didn't know. The only thing to do now, I guessed, was to just keep on driving and hope I find somewhere to stop and ask for directions. 

I reached down to turn up the radio but was met with only silence. I sighed, the radio in my car had crapped out on me a while back and I thought I had fixed it, apparently not well enough though. The next hour or so of driving was going to be mind numbingly dull without tunes. I glanced down at the clock on the dash and sighed, oh great, I thought, now the clock is busted too. The numbers still showed 12:00 AM. 

 I shook my head, “Baby, I love you, but you have some serious issues.”  

My car was my pride and joy, even if she had seen better days. A 1991 Camaro Rs, it was white with red racing stipes. The paintjob was custom but had seen better days, not to mention that the radiator was held together with JB weld, and it had over 200,000 miles on the engine. Needless to say, the old girl could use some TLC, that is, when I could afford it. I shrugged off my worries about the time and the radio and kept on driving. 

Eventually, up ahead in the distance, I thought I could make out a faint light. As I drove on, the solitary beacon grew brighter and brighter. A lighthouse shining in a sea of night. After what felt like miles and miles, the light finally resolved into a bright neon sign. The sign had a long green snake looped around fiery red words, The Midway Saloon. 

I pulled into the parking, and thought it looked about like any other dive bar I had ever seen. There were a handful of classic cars and Harley Davidsons parked out front, but the thing that stood out the most was standing there hitched to a post staring at me. It wasn't too unusual to see horses at bars, this was the south after all. But this horse was different, it was absolutely massive, solid black with a gleaming black saddle. The way the big animals' eyes reflected the light, almost seemed to make them glow.  

I parked next to an old Cadilac and stepped out onto the gravel lot. The warm air seemed to grow cooler under the giant horses' gaze, it watched me all the way to the door, the glow in its eyes never faltering.  Stepping through the saloon doors, I was met with the familiar smell of cigarette smoke and spilled beer. A jukebox in the corner played a song I had heard at least a hundred times but for some reason I couldn't place it, the patrons played pool, darts and leaned against the bar talking loudly.  

The bartender looked up from behind the bar. He was a big guy in a crisp white shirt and rolled up sleeves, he had a bushy beard and dark slicked back hair. He put down the glass he had been cleaning and met my eyes. 

“New around here huh? Well, what can I get you?” 

I nodded, “Uh yeah. Actually, I'm just passing through, but I'm not really sure where here is.” 

He smiled and shook his head, “Passing through. Thats a good one.”  

I sat down at the bar and ordered a beer, “So, I'm trying to get to Highway 9, but I think I made a wrong turn somewhere. Could you tell me how to get to where I need to be?” 

The bartender shook his head and sat the beer in front of me, “No, I can't tell you that. I can tell you however, you are a long way from where you want to be.” 

“What does that mean?” I asked. 

The big man just smiled and went back to cleaning the same glass. I glanced around the bar, noticing the way the people were dressed. It was like some crazy decades party or something. In one corner I saw a guy dressed like a 1950s greaser, playing darts with a guy who looked like an 90s punk rocker, blue mohawk and everything. At the other end of the bar sat what looked like a Wallstreet banker talking with a couple civil war reenactors.  

“You all having a costume party or something?” I asked the bartender. 

 He just smiled at me again and continued cleaning the glass. I shook my head and took a sip of my beer. 

Glancing around the bar again, I noticed a man sitting alone in one dark corner. He had a long black coat and a wide brimmed cowboy hat. “Is that the guy who owns that beast of a horse out there?” I asked, motioning to the man. 

The bartender stopped cleaning the glass as the bar went silent. I could feel every eye in the room fixed on me. Almost every eye. I looked around at the people surrounding me, then to the back of the room, where the man sat alone. His dark hat tilted up as he looked at me, he had the same cold glow in his eyes I had seen in the horse outside. I felt a chill run up my spine and my skin grew hot under that gaze. He didn't just look at me, he looked into me. It was like he could see down to my soul, to the very fiber of my being. I felt panic rising from nowhere. 

Just then I felt an iron grip on my arm. I turned away from that unnatural gaze and looked at the bartender. 

“You had best be on your way son.”  

I nodded and stood up from the bar, “Uh, which way do I go?” I asked. 

His face took on a grim countenance, “Just keep following the road.” 

I nodded, “What do I owe you for the beer?”  

Smiling warmly again he said, “First ones always free.” 

I frowned at that and he went back to cleaning the glass. As he did, the commotion of the bar resumed, as if it had never stopped. 

I stepped out of the strange saloon and avoided looking at the horse as I made my way back to my car. I just needed to get back on the road, and away from whatever the hell that was. Pulling back onto the blacktop I quickly left The Midway Saloon far behind me. 

 I had been driving for what felt like hours at this point, where the hell was I? How could I have become so lost?  

Just then I saw something up ahead in the distance. At first it was just vague dark shapes against more darkness, but as I got closer the shapes resolved into buildings and houses. It was a town. As the town came into focus, my exhausted brain caught up with what seemed so out of place. It was a town with no lights.  

“What the hell?”  

The road I was on led right down the center of the dark town. As I slowed down, I looked from side to side at the buildings lining the street. The buildings looked old, made of dark red brick and wood, but they weren't run down or abandoned just empty and dark.  

There were streetlights but none of them were on. I didn't see any other cars in the town either. Come to think of it, I hadn't seen any other cars all night.  

I pulled my car to a stop at the center of town and rolled down my window. The sound of my car's engine reverberated through the town; it seemed so incredibly loud in the utter emptiness. I killed the engine and stepped out onto the dark empty road. My headlights were still on and out of the corner of my eye, I thought I saw something move out of the beam. I turned to look for whatever, or whoever was there. But I didn't see anything. 

“Hello?” I shouted.  

The echo of my voice bounced around and distorted before going silent. After a moment more of silence, I began to get back into my car when I heard it. 

“Hello?” 

Goosebumps rose on my skin. As I whipped around, looking for the answering voice. The voice that sounded almost exactly like mine. My eyes scanned the darkness, but I couldn't see anyone. This was wrong, this place it felt wrong. I couldn't understand it but I felt eyes on me from every direction, just like back at the bar. But I couldn't see anyone. 

“Hello?” I whispered under my breath.  

The moment stretched as the silence of the town seemed to swallow the sound of my voice.  

“Hello?” A voice whispered back. 

I spun and jumped into my car, my heart pounding. The voice had been right behind me, I could swear I felt a warm breath on my neck. I frantically rolled the window up and looked around for the voice but there was no one there. I reached for the ignition and turned the key, but the damn thing wouldn't start. 

Suddenly a streetlight at the end of the block started flickering on and off.  Standing directly under the light was a man. I couldn't make out many details at this distance but what I could see chilled me to the bone. His clothes hung on him like rags and his skin looked cracked and dark, like charcoal. He stood there crookedly, staring at me. When the light flickered back out, he was gone. I could still see the darkened streetlight but the man had disappeared, he was just gone. I turned the key again and again, 

“Fucking come on!” I shouted. 

When the streetlight flickered back on, I could see the man again, only this time he wasn't alone. There was at least a dozen charred figures standing under the light now. They jerkily moved and shifted towards me as the light flickered 

“Fucking come on!” The all shouted, in my voice. 

I watched in horror as they broke into a run just as the light flickered back out. 

Finally, the engine roared to life and I slammed it into gear. As I tore through the dark town my headlights illuminated dozens more charred figures. Their skeletal hands reached out for me as I blazed past them, I could hear their nails scratching into my cars paint as I passed them by. I accelerated faster out of the town and back onto the long dark road. 

My head was spinning, they weren't real, they can't be real. I could barely see straight, I briefly thought about heading back to The Midway but I couldn't stop. Real or not, I had to get away from that town. I had to keep driving, the only problem was, I could no longer tell how long I have been driving; time seemed strange. I stared down at the gas gage and prayed it was broken also; I couldn't remember how long I had been on half a tank. The road and the endless darkness beyond it seemed to stretch on for eternity,

 After another indeterminate time of driving, trees began appearing sporadically along the sides of the road. Eventually they grew in numbers until both sides of the road were heavily forested. 

The road began to twist and wind, what was once a long, straight stretch of emptiness was now a serpentine path through towering trees and woodlands. I was truly lost, but I couldn't bring myself to turn around, to face those things in that town again.  

When I came around the next curve, I slammed hard on my brakes. Right in front of me was a large old iron bridge. My mind raced; this was the first time the road had deviated from being anything but blacktop. I shook the feeling off, it was just a road. A very long uninhabited road. 

I stepped out of my car and looked around at the surrounding forest. It was so quiet, there should have at least been animal noises, right? Crickets, owls, coyotes, something. But there was absolutely no sound. 

I walked toward the old bridge; I wasn't sure it would be safe to drive across, I needed to get a closer look before trusting it to hold. My footsteps echoed through the forest as I stepped up to where the asphalt met the wooden planks of the bridge. The stared down, the dark pristine asphalt gave way to rotted looking wood. I cautiously extended my foot and placed it down onto the wood. The step seemed louder than it should have been and echoed down into whatever was below the bridge. It seemed sturdy enough, so I walked out onto it testing the structure by jumping up and down.  

“Is someone there?” 

I froze. It was a woman's voice, and it came from under the bridge.  

“Hello? Is... Is someone there?” she called. 

I turned as quietly as I could, began to make my way back to my car. The voice wasn't a mimic of mine this time, but I still didn't trust anyone who hung around under bridges. I made it three steps before the boards creaked under my step. 

The womans voice came again, “Hello? I need help. Please, I'm hurt.” 

I swallowed hard, the voice sounded sincere. What if it was someone like me, lost on this road and trapped down there? How could I just leave her down there? I decided to take a chance. 

“Hello. I'm here. Where are you?” 

The voice sighed in relief, “Oh thank God. I'm down here, under the bridge, I fell off and my leg is pinned under a rock. Can you please come down and help me?” 

“Okay.” I said, “Let me go get a flashlight from my car. Is there a path down I can use to get to you?” 

“Yes, I can see a path down. Just follow the sound of my voice.” 

I hurried to my car and grabbed a heavy Maglite from my trunk. Luckily the batteries were still good, and I was able to find the path that led below the bridge, “Okay, I'm coming.” 

“Please hurry, I've been down here so long. No one would stop to help me.” 

I was halfway down the path and paused, “You’ve seen other cars on the road?” I asked. 

The voice was silent for a moment, then she said, “Please hurry, it hurts.”  

“One minute” I said, “I think I have a first aid kit in the car. I'll just run grab it really quick.”  

“NO!” The voice shouted in anger before softening again, “Just come a little closer, I can see your light, you're almost there.” 

From where I was standing, the bridge blocked my view underneath it, but if I knelt down, I would be able to see. Slowly I bent down and shined my flashlight across the rocks under the bridge. 

“Thats it.” said the voice, “A little farther.” 

I panned the light to the left and saw a scrap of dirty white cloth. I stepped forward, looking closer. The cloth was part of an old stained dress. The womans body lay brokenly among the rocks under the bridge. She looked like she had been dead for some time. When my light shined on the womans face, she smiled. Her smile spread wider and wider and her eyes took on a manic excitement. 

“You found me.” She said, before bending straight up at the waist, her joints cracking like old kindling. 

As I began to back away, she leapt to all fours and darted toward me. I turned and ran as fast as I could up the hill and back to my car. My heart pounding. I could hear her right behind me, her hands and feet scrambling across the ground like a deranged spider. 

Just before I made it to my car, I felt an impact on my back. She was on me, biting and scratching. I fell to the ground and rolled across the road throwing her off of me. I jumped to my feet just as she lunged at me. I leapt back and swung the heavy Maglite, striking her in the head. She recoiled in pain and fell to the ground, sobbing.  

“Please don't hurt me. I just needed help.” She cried, holding her hands up in defense. 

I stepped back in confusion, “What? You attacked me!” I shouted.  

“No, I just needed help. And you hit me.” She sobbed. 

I shook my head, “I'm not doing this, just stay back and I'll leave.”   

I stepped back away from her to my car and opened the door. I only took my eyes off of her for a second, and suddenly she was on me again. Slapping the flashlight away and knocking me to the ground. She dug her nails into my shoulders and chest as she tried to bite my face. Her eyes bulged and her teeth were impossibly large and jagged. I couldn't push her off of me so I wrapped my hands around her neck and squeezed as tightly as I could, fear and adrenaline running through me. I squeezed my eyes closed and kept up the pressure until finally she slowly stopped fighting and went limp.  

I flung the body off of me and looked at it in horror. In death, she just looked like a normal woman, dirty and beaten, but normal. And I had killed her. I bent over and puked, disgusted and horrified at what I had just done. 

I had to get out of here, as I turned to get back into the car, the dead woman behind me started laughing. Looking back at the body, I could see she was still laying there. The toothy smile back in place, but her eyes were completely vacant. 

“Please don't hurt me.” She laughed. 

My breaths came quicker and quicker, ""What the fuck are you?”  

Her head turned to face me as her smile spread even wider. “I’m what you will become.”  

In an instant she was back on her feet and wrapping her hands around my neck. I felt my feet leave the ground as he squeezed my throat, tighter and tighter. 

I choked and kicked but I couldn't break free. Her jaw unhinged and stretched, revealing row after row of jagged, serrated teeth. I couldn't believe it, this was the end, and I didn't even understand what was happening. 

Just as consciousness started to fade, I heard a boom, like a thunderclap as a flash lit up the sky. I fell to the ground, choking and gagging. One of the woman things arms still holding onto my throat. I managed to pry it loose and looked up to see the stunned look on her face. Another boom lit up the sky and a burning hole appeared between the things eyes just before she crumpled to the ground in a pile of ash.  

I stood and looked back up the road, but I couldn't see anything. I heard him first, heavy footsteps accompanied by the jingle of spurs. Then out of the darkness, a pair of cold glowing eyes.  He was coming, and I wasn't waiting around to see what he wanted. I just needed to get the hell out of there. I jumped over the smoldering ash pile and into my car. I stomped on the gas pedal and tore across the bridge, praying I would find a way off of this fucking road. 

As I left the forested area, I pressed the accelerator even harder. The needle on the speedometer rose to 85 then to 100 then 120, I put the pedal to the floor and screamed out all of my fear, anger and frustration, “AAAAAHHHHHH!!!”  

 

Time and miles passed in a haze, I never stopped. Several times I came to places on the road where someone or something wanted me to stop. A tree in the road, a hitchhiker waving for me to stop, another rickety bridge. None of it mattered, I had to keep going. I’d swerve around or drive over whatever was in my way. My car took a beating, but she never stopped.  

I saw the horseman a few more times; I think he even chased after me once. I didn't care I just sped on. Whatever this place was it had an end somewhere, a way out or a way back, or something. I just had to keep driving...driving...driving...

 

I started woke up in the parking lot of a cafe. Glancing around I saw several cars in the lot and a big sign out front that said Al’s. Through the window. I could see several people inside sitting and eating, and going about their business. 

Had it all been a dream? Yeah, yeah of course it was a dream. A long terrible dream. I stepped out of my car and made my way to the door, I felt groggy and exhausted, that way you do after a restless night of sleep. I pushed open the cafe door and heard the bell jingle. Sitting at the counter I motioned to the waitress and she came over.  

“Hey Hun, what’ll it be?”  

I smiled up at her, “I could use a coffee.”  

She nodded, “Coming right up.” 

Setting a white mug on the counter, she filled it to the brim with the steaming beverage. I inhaled the aroma and smiled. I couldn't believe I was finally out of that nightmare. 

“You don't fucking belong here.” 

I looked up at the waitress, “Excuse me?” 

“I said, do you want sugar with that?” she said grinning down at me. 

I blinked in confusion, “uh... No. No, I don't.”  

The waitress smiled and nodded before turning back to the kitchen. I must still be a little out of it. I thought.  

Shaking my head I took a sip from the mug and immediately spit it out. The coffee, it... it tasted like... I couldn't even bring myself to think it. I looked down at the mug, and felt my stomach drop. What had just been a cup full of dark warm coffee, was now filled to the brim with a dark red liquid that smelled like copper and rot.  

I stumbled back from the counter, gagging and knocking over the stool, as the cafe erupted into laughter. I looked around at the cackling faces as the vile liquid in the mug began to poor over the brim and continued flowing out onto the floor, like some macabre fountain.  “No...” I was still on that fucking road.  

Just as I was about to turn and run for my car, every single person in the diner stood up as one and turned to face me. The laughing stopped and their smiles were replaced with an expression of pure hatred. Then they began to speak.  

A trucker in the corner, “You’re a unique one...” 

The waitress behind the counter, “We don't get one like you here often...” 

A little girl in a booth, “Not nearly often enough...”  

An elderly man at the counter, “The half ways always...” 

A young woman at the register, “Taste...” 

The cook by the flat top, “So...” 

A mother of three by the door, “Much...” 

All as one, “Sweeter.” 

I stood there, petrified as the moment stretched. I have to get out of here, now. I ran for it; I was going to shove and punch and kick every single one of these fuckers out of my way if I had to.  

I didn't make it past the first one. It was a middle-aged balding man, who looked like he weighed maybe 120ibs. I tried to shove him and run past, but his skin was like one of those sticky mouse traps and my arm got immediately stuck against his face. I tried to rip myself free but the others began closing in around me, their hands reaching out to take hold of me. I could feel dozens of hands sticking to me and pulling from every direction, I didn't know what would break first, my body or my mind. I screamed in fear, and the assembly howled in joy.  

Just as I thought I would be ripped limb from limb, thunder boomed through the diner over and over again. The tacky hands began falling away, and I collapsed to the floor. As I lay there trying to catch my breath, I felt a different set of hands of me. Large, ice-cold hands. I felt myself being pulled to my feet and dragged through the diner and out into the parking lot. 

As I was thrown to the ground, I looked up at my savior and winced under the glare of those eyes. This was the closest I had seen him, and it was horrible. His skin was pale and sunken, like an aging corpse. And his white hair hung in strands down to his shoulders.  

He glared down at me and pointed one long finger, “Stay.” 

His voice was deep and gravely, full of both age and power. He turned and started back to the diner pulling two massive revolvers from his belt. 

Through the window of the cafe. I saw the corpses climbing to their feet, most of them had large chunks missing from their bodies. One after another, the bodies began falling into each other. They clumped together in a fleshy gore coated mass, arms and legs and mouths jutting out in all directions. The mass began shifting its way to the door, all of the thing's eyes were still fixed on me. The pale gunslinger kicked the door open and began firing both thundering revolvers, knocking the thing back and blowing off massive chunks of smoldering flesh. 

 I didn't stay to watch the rest. Even though he had saved my ass twice now, he still filled me with a kind of dread that was all consuming. I jumped to my feet and ran around the massive black horse between me and my car. I cranked the engine to life and floored it away from the cafe and on down the road. I kept driving... and driving... and driving... 

Time lost all meaning, I never got hungry, never got thirsty, never stopped driving. I believed that I had found my way to hell. My suspicion was confirmed hundreds of miles later, when I saw a bright neon sign up ahead in the distance...  The Midway. 

I stood there on the gravel lot, staring up at the sign. The glow of the neon painting the night in shades of red and green. Only now could I see the snake for what it really was, an ouroboros. The paradoxical serpent, forever eating its own tail. There was no end to the road. No end. No beginning. Just an eternal loop of misery and darkness. I stared at the sign, my eyes following the coils of the snake around and around. My mind cracked even further and I began to laugh. I doubled over and fell to the ground laughing harder and harder and for a while I just slipped away... 

I don't know how long I lay there like that. After a time, I came back to myself. Sitting up from the cold ground and climbing to my feet, I made my way to the door and pushed through it. 

The bar tender looked up from wiping down the bar top, “Back so soon?” 

I numbly walked over to the bar, sat down on a stool and met his eyes, “I have been driving for days. Maybe even weeks. I can't even fucking tell anymore.” 

The bartender nodded, “Weeks, months, years...” 

My eyes had dropped to the bat top, but shot back up at his words. Had it really been that long?  

He noticed my panic and chuckled, “They're just words. They don't really mean anything here.” 

“So... Is this hell?” I asked  

He laughed, “No, it aint hell. It's just the road.” 

I shook my head in confusion, “But what is the road?” 

The bartender studied me for a moment before answering, “Well, some have called it purgatory, or limbo. But it aint really that either. This is the traveler's road, its where the lost souls of travelers end up.” 

My heart dropped, “So, I am dead.” 

He shrugged, “Not entirely. I couldn't see it before but there is still a thread of life within you.” 

“Wait, what? I'm still alive?” 

He shrugged again, “Partially, your life is in the balance as we speak.  I reckon that's why the Rider has such an interest in you.” 

“Why would that interest him? What is he?” I asked. 

“What he is, I don't rightly know. Around here, we just call him “The Rider”.  What I do know, is that he is a hunter. He wanders through all worlds and finds things that don't belong... and removes them. You not being fully dead, don't fully belong here. So, he isn't quite sure what to do with you.” 

I thought about the woman from the bridge and how he reduced her to a pile of ash. Would that be my fate? I didn't think so. He had his chance to end me on the road, instead he protected me. 

“On the road, there were things. Things that tried to kill me... 

He nodded, “The unnaturals. Vengeful souls that died of unnatural or supernatural causes. They feed off of pain and fear.” 

I swallowed a lump in my throat and asked, “What would have happened if they killed me?”  

His face turned grim, ""Then you would stay here and become one of them.” 

I shuttered thinking of the people in the diner. Were they lost souls too once?  I didn't think I wanted to know the answer. 

“If I die, will I stay here?” 

He smiled sadly, “I wish I could tell you, you'd move on. But I don't know. My guess is that since you wound up here in the first place, this is where you'll be.” 

I shook my head, “But why?” 

“Kid, I still don't know why I'm here. Some people do move on from the road, but not many and not often. It's one of life and deaths great mysteries.” 

Just then I heard the snorting of a horse from outside, followed by heavy, spurred footsteps. I turned to face the door just as it swung open. As the Rider entered the barroom the temperature dropped. I felt goosebumps on my skin as I stood and met his gaze.  

“Thank you.” I said my voice trembling, I took a steadying breath and started again. “Thank you, for helping me.”  

He stared down at me with that terror inducing gaze. The moment stretched but I didn't look away. Eventually, the Rider gave a small grunt and a nod of his head before turning and heading to his seat in the back of the bar. 

I turned back to sit back at the bar when I felt myself growing increasingly dizzy. My vision began to blur and I spun and fell to the floor. For a moment all I could see was the dim bulb hanging from the ceiling. But then the bulb grew brighter and brighter, until all I could see was a blinding white light and my ears were filled with a deafening ringing.  

Eventually I was able to make out a distant voice, “Hey. Hey Kid, can you hear me?” 

I tried to speak but, I had no voice. 

“If you can hear me, follow the light.” 

I did, or at least I tried to.  

“Good.” Said the voice. “Can you tell me your name?” 

I blinked over and over again. My eyes were so dry.  

“Hey, I think he's coming out of it.” The voice was calling to someone else.  

Reality slammed back into place. I was on my back, with a flashlight in my face, surrounded by paramedics. I turned my head to look around. Someone told me not to move, but I had to see. My car was wrapped around a tree about 20 feet away.  

“What time is it?” I asked. 

The paramedic leaning over me looked down at her watch and said, “12:01.” 

I felt tears burning in my eyes, I was alive. 

“You must have been having some dream.” Said the paramedic as I was loaded into the ambulance. “You were talking about bars and monsters and gunslingers. I think I would have liked to see that.” 

I smiled, despite the pain I was in, “Yeah, some dream. I'm just glad it's over.” 

It was a dream, wasn't it? Thats what I tell myself anyway, it had to be a dream. The heavy, jingling footsteps I heard as they closed the ambulance doors were just in my head. Weren't they?

   I'm 26 now, but first some background info. think I gave myself hyperthyroidism by self-medicating with iodine supplements at least throughout 2022 and 2023. I unknowingly had my first thyroid storm around New Year's of 2023 from mixing a lot of a weed pen, a lot of white vein kratom, and one of every health supplement I had. Chest pain & a pounding heart lasted for about four months, then I started recovering from it. That summer, after going back on iodine, starting vaping nicotine again, drinking coffee, and watching p*rn, I started having a fast heartrate when trying to fall back asleep sometimes. In October of 2023, I started vaping weed and/or drinking alcohol almost daily until February 2024, when I had another thyroid storm after not sleeping and having a cup of black coffee. 

   I didn't believe my doctor about his diagnosis of hyperthyroidism from the latter half of 2023 due to us disagreeing on some other issues (COVID-19 vaccines), but I started taking the methimazole he prescribed out of desperation. It was 5 mg twice a day, and after I met with him to discuss the symptoms, he bumped it up to 10 mg twice a day, but said that I could cut it if I wanted, and after trying it once, I did cut it back to 5 mg, and had him lower my dose. I didn't like the effect the medication had on my personality, my body, nor the fact that I became reliant on it and had a thyroid storm whenever I didn't take it.

   From the year before, I knew that I didn't need the medication, and that my body would heal by itself. My doctor had said that it was inevitable for my immune system to kill my thyroid gland, and that I'll then become dependent on artificial thyroid hormone supplements for the rest of my life, but after some research, I found a doctor who has hyperthyroidism and treats it naturally by healing his thyroid rather than killing it; his name is Dr. Eric Osansky. He has two websites with a plethora of articles, at least two books about naturally healing from hyperthyroidism, and a free podcast that regularly releases new episodes; it's called Save My Thyroid, if I recall correctly. I bought his two main books, but due to my ADHD habits, I still have hardly read any of them, but his website, podcast, and books are good resources.

   I started weaning off of my medication slowly, giving my body plenty of time to adjust, since when I stopped taking it cold turkey, I had the worst thyroid storm I'd ever had. I reduced my medication by maybe 1/16th-1/9th of a tablet or so every week that I could, but some weeks I would stay on the last week's dose to let my body catch up, usually if I had been drinking caffeine, watching p*rn, or spending a lot of time near the WiFi router. (I'm also sensitive to EMF's, and the difference between before and after replacing the new smart meter with a normal electric meter a couple years ago was like night and day - constant rage versus peace.)

   I had kept track of every time I took my medication in a health journal, and in late November 2024 (a couple weeks ago), I took my last dose of methimazole. If I recall correctly, it was about 1/16th of a 5 mg tablet, which I switched to taking once a day from the week before, instead of twice. Now, I just avoid using much caffeine, any alcohol, cannabis, or other drugs, try to abstain from ej*culating as long as possible, keep my distance from the WiFi router and try to reduce EMF's (as I did before), definitely don't take any iodine, take supplements to help my hyperthyroidism, get regular sleep, and get at least light exercise. Trying to get back to a sleep schedule aligned with the sun again, too (right now I sleep during the day and take Vitamin D supplements to cope).

   The week after weaning off of methimazole, I wanted to take some selenium since I remembered that Dr. Osansky always recommended it, and though I don't have selenium alone, I have a supplement with NAC + selenium. I researched whether NAC is safe for hyperthyroidism, and what I discovered shocked me. Apparently, hyperthyroidism is associated with severe brain damage, and no one even told me once, not even my own doctor. Luckily, in the same study's article, it suggested that NAC & safranal may prevent brain damage induced by hyperthyroidism, as it worked for rats: 

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32264788/

   So, safe to say, I'm taking NAC & saffron everyday now; I just don't take them altogether at the same time as Vitamin D & an immunity-boosting mycelium blend I also take sometimes, as spacing them out is much easier to metabolize.

   Some other methods I found to help keep a steady heartrate and head with hyperthyroidism, that I can remember off of the top of my head out of the many methods I've written down, are: using a cold ice pack on my forehead and squatting to reduce my heartrate by activating the vagus nerve (I think it's called), getting a cold shower or rinsing my face with cold water with the same reasoning, drinking enough water, getting regular sleep (as I stated before), listening to a story or a livestream to help me drift off to sleep when I've felt too high-strung to fall asleep with my own thoughts, sleeping on the floor if my heartrate reverberating through the mattress causes too much anxiety to fall asleep, remembering to breathe, using the 5-4-3-2-1/5 senses technique to ground myself, grounding by putting my bare feet or just socks on the ground outside to release negative EMF's and attune to a healthier vibration, drinking herbal or decaf tea, getting light to moderate exercise as I said before, petting animals, having a relaxed conversation with my brother in his bedroom, listening to relaxing music, praying, meditating, eating healthily, avoiding bad ingredients like seed oils and artificial colors, choosing non-GMO or organic if/when possible, and regularly de-stressing, such as through some of the ways described in this sentence. Regularly de-stressing is another essential activity recommended by Eric Osansky.  

   I also tune into something called CLRLY now and then that suggests a liver-detoxing protocol, but I haven't tried that yet.",0,1734141190.0,Hyperthyroidism,1,0.5,False

First tme poster, long time lurker/reader.

I lost my dad due to a sudden hart-arrest early 2018.  
Mind you, it was before covid, and he was fully healthy at 61 years old

The last night I even spent with him. I was 32, and had a barber at my parents place.  
We both had our hair cut, and some family members were around as well for the same. It was a 'call at home' barber, we could call in to do their job for a number of people.  
I sat next to him on the couch, and did notice he was breathing heaviliy.  
So I asked, everything okay? He told me he was having a cold, and would join me for a beer,  
He opted for a spirit drink to sip, to clear his throat I guess. He usually woulnd't decline a beer with his 32yo son.  
It was getting towards 11pm, and the barber was done. He asked me, you want to do 1 more beer?

Told him nah, I've got work in the morning. Alarm clock at 7. But he and I both knew I would go home and drink one with my girl (just god engaged, he was my best man).

  
Long story short, he passed that night of a sudden heart attack. He got up at around 4-ish, went down o the living room and stayed there for about an hour. My mom got worried so she checked up on him then. Asked him he he was ok. He told her no not really, but wasn't really sure what was going on.

My mom called 112 (or 911 for us) and went to the bathroom.

When the ambulance arrived he was down and had a hart-arres. They got him in an ambulance to get to the hospital. They succesfully 'revived' him on the way 3 times.

Around that time, my bro and sis came to my place. They were woken up by my mom, but she coulnd't reach me. So my brother and sister came to my ome and tapped / bounced on the window of my bedroom. 

That scared the shit out of me and my wife in the first place, in the middle of the night. But the worst was yet to come. 

We offered them some coffee, and went to the hospital.

Unfortunately my dad was out, no way to have contact. His hart has been stopped for too long, so no hope for full recovery. He was in a coma for a few days, but we had to let him go eventually.

  
Thi shit fucked me up so hard. Every day I think, why didn't I take that drink?

Now, almost 6 years later. I can't sleep. When I go to bed normally, I will dream about him/my mom. When I wake up I feel real bad, because I just 'casually talk' with him, or just notice he's there but nothing else.

No option to talk about stuff, or just ask anything. He's just there and it's normal(?).

That feeling got me so weirded out that I started drinking more.  
No more dreams, just go knocked out to bed and no thought about it after.

Again, this has been 6 years. with about 8-12 beers a day. Thoughts?  


ps. Yes I've been to a psychiatrist, multiple. Didn't mention the beer thing, but they did make me write a letter to him with my thoughts. Made me write (and read) a letter to my mom with my thoughts.   
Also got prescribed Citalopram as an aid. No help.",1,1734141109.0,GriefSupport,1,1.0,False

1hdry04,https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/1hdry04/shallow_review_shattered_only_very_mild_spoilers/,"Shallow Review:  Shattered (only very mild spoilers) -- TLDR:  it's nifty, try it","So I just tried *Shattered* for the first time last night and I am... well not *shattered* exactly, but kinda blown away :-)

Not so much by the gameplay -- it is more or less your standard ""collect clues, watch flashbacks, solve mystery, escape from scary place"" game.  Escape/mystery/horror, a pretty well understood genre..  But the ways in which the devs have used MR are ... *startlingly original* and effective -- I experienced several moments of that original ""magic WOW"" feeling that you get when you first encounter VR.  They have come up with some great mechanics and visuals.

So the novelty here is that (rather like a bigger version of walltown wonders) instead of going to full VR, the game slaps ""portals"" onto walls in your home.  Your wall now has a jagged opening in it through which you can see into a neighbouring (VR) space, fully modelled and animated.  Obviously you can't step into the imaginary neighbouring space, but the game offers a mechanic by which you can remote-grab items from that space and bring them into your own room (MR), placing them wherever they will fit.

So for example:  I am staring through a hole in my IRL wall, into a sort of prison cell in which our protagonist is being held.  I want to investigate her desk.  I remote-grab the desk and haul it into my livingroom, where I place it on the floor in an open spot.  I can then walk up to it and look through the drawers.  Or I can grab a storage chest out of a VR space and put it on my coffee table at a convenient height for messing about with the lock.  Since it's MR I can see my furniture and family members, so there's low risk of walking into stuff, and this means I can use my entire LR/kitchen as play space.  This feels very spacious and refreshing compared to full VR with boundaries.

The interaction of the virtual objects with the realworld space (so far) is remarkably good.  It feels strangely cool and magical to be able to put VR game objects on your couch, table, coffee table, floor.

Moreover, some of these objects have unexpected properties.  I pulled a painting off a wall in a neighbouring VR space, put it on my local wall, then grabbed it with ""hands"" (controllers) and took it down -- thinking there might be a letter or other document concealed behind it.  But what actually happened was that >! it revealed a small hole in my wall leading into... a mini neighbouring VR space with more clues in it!!<

Similarly a ventilation grille in a neighbouring space might be >!transportable to your home space, where it opens and reveals the ventilation ducts of the facility !<(and more clues).  It was pretty wild to attach the grille to a cupboard door in my kitchen, then >!open it and find myself peering into a ductwork junction inhabited by Creepy Things.!<

The quality of the 3D modelling is excellent (for a standalone game) and the materialisation of VR objects in your MR space is flawless so far.  If you drop things -- like the in-game flashlight -- they fall to your IRL floor, including an appropriate thump if they are heavy.  You can bend down and pick them up again, or respawn them from inventory.  Having game objects behaving more or less correctly in your familiar living environment really adds to immersion and the illusion of reality. 

There are quite a few control inputs involved, and it will take me a little while to get these memorised so I don't have to think about which button does what;  but my initial 20 minutes or so fooling around with the game has left me really impressed.  I was actually too beguiled by all the MR effects to pay that much attention to the quest/puzzle, so will probably have to start over.

Originally when MR started to be seriously discussed for gaming I confess I was not excited about it -- full VR seemed far more immersive and interesting.  Now I've experienced several MR games that have completely changed my mind:  the integration of MR with the real physical environment is actually exciting -- when done right, it can be even more magical than full VR.

I have done no more than taste this game --  but wanted to leave an initial or exploratory positive review to encourage others to try it.  Kudos to the devs for an original approach and *excellent* use of MR.",5,1734140243.0,OculusQuest,1,0.78,False

I really like the option to type on a qwerty keyboard. I really like when the braille display has a decent word processor that you can use without having to huse your laptop along with it. I also really like text to speech.

I know that braillenote touch has all these capabilities and and probably other notetakers probably have all the above capabilities as well, but these are very expensive. Also, braillenote touch is heavier than I like because of the screen, and I really don’t need a screen nor do I find it desirable.

I tried the braillant bi20x, and it is fun to use with a little word processor and text to speech to read back what you typed, but I don’t think there is any way to connect a qwerty keyboard to it for input. Also, there is no way to open two documents at once and flip back and forth between them efficiently.

Orbit q40 and Mantis q40 have full qwerty keyboards and their own built-in word processors,but there is no text to speech.

Does anyone know about braille displays from other companies? Do any of them have their own word processor and the ability to either bluetooth or connect a qwerty keyboard by usb for qwerty typing directly into the display? And text to speech, too?

I’d like to leave my laptop behind and edit my novel in a coffee shop or library.

Thanks.

(And if you have a different braille display that I didn’t mention and just want to tell me about it’s features, I’d be interested.

-------------------------------------------

In the quest for healthier eating habits, smoothies have emerged as a favorite for many. They are quick, easily customizable, and can be made with a variety of ingredients. One popular addition to smoothies that you might not have considered is granola. You might wonder, can you put granola in smoothies? The answer is yes, and there are several benefits to doing so!

Granola adds a delightful crunch and texture to your smoothies. If you enjoy a thicker consistency, granola can help achieve that creamy feel while still maintaining some chewiness. This textural complexity can elevate your smoothie from a simple drink to a satisfying meal or snack. The crunchiness of granola contrasts beautifully with the smoothness of blended fruits, making each sip enjoyable.

Another advantage of adding granola to your smoothies is the nutritional boost it provides. Many granola blends are rich in whole grains, nuts, seeds, and dried fruits. Here’s what you can get:

Check The Details Here: https://smoothiediet.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Fiber:** Granola generally contains whole grains, which are high in fiber. Fiber is essential for digestion and can help keep you feeling fuller for longer.
- **Protein:** Depending on the ingredients, granola can provide a good amount of protein. This is especially true for varieties that include nuts and seeds.
- **Healthy Fats:** Some granola options contain nuts, adding healthy fats that can help in maintaining heart health while also providing long-lasting energy.
- **Vitamins and Minerals:** Ingredients like dried fruits and seeds can contribute vitamins like Vitamin E and minerals like magnesium and zinc to your smoothie.

Why not enjoy a smoothie that tastes good and is good for you? Granola doesn’t just serve practical benefits; it also enhances the flavor profile. If you choose a sweet or flavored granola, it can add an extra layer of sweetness without the need for added sugars. Think about how delicious a strawberry banana smoothie could be with a hint of cinnamon or honey-flavored granola sprinkled in. The flavors harmonize perfectly, making your smoothie even more tempting.

Mixing granola into your smoothie can also help with meal prep. If you often find yourself rushed in the morning, preparing your smoothie with granola can save you time. You can blend your favorite fruits and greens with a scoop of granola in advance. Just find a convenient container, pop your smoothie in the fridge, and you have a quick breakfast ready to grab when you’re running out the door!

Moreover, if you’re engaging in physical activities, smoothies with granola can act as an excellent post-workout recovery meal. The protein and carbohydrates found in granola can replenish glycogen stores after exercise. Adding granola to your smoothie can also be a delicious way to refuel your body while nurturing your taste buds!

When you decide to incorporate granola into your smoothies, be mindful of the serving size. It’s easy to get carried away with the crunch, and while granola is nutritious, it can also be calorie-dense. A small handful usually suffices to provide the texture and benefits without overwhelming the other ingredients.

Check The Details Here: https://smoothiediet.myofferdeals.com  
  
If you’re unsure how to combine granola into your smoothies, here are a few flavor ideas to get you started:

- **Berry Bliss:** Blend mixed berries, banana, and yogurt with a sprinkle of granola on top.
- **Tropical Delight:** Use mango, pineapple, and coconut milk, finished with granola for a tropical twist.
- **Green Goodness:** Spinach, avocado, apple, and your favorite granola can make a refreshing smoothie packed with nutrients.
- **Chocolate Fix:** Blend banana, almond milk, and cocoa powder, topping with chocolate granola for a treat!

Granola into your smoothies is not just about taste; it’s about creating a delightful, nutritious experience. You can enjoy the benefits of added fiber, protein, healthy fats, and essential vitamins, all while tantalizing your taste buds. So, the next time you blend up a smoothie, consider adding granola for that perfect crunch and nutritional boost!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening has become a popular choice for individuals seeking a brighter smile. Many people hesitate to begin this journey, unsure of how effective the treatment will be. The results can be dramatic, showcasing the transformative power of a beautiful, white smile. Understanding what to expect before and after the procedure can help you make informed decisions about your dental care.

### What to Expect Before Teeth Whitening

Before undergoing teeth whitening, it’s important to prepare. This preparation can significantly enhance your experience and ensure optimal results.

- **Consultation with Your Dentist:** Schedule a visit to your dentist for an evaluation. They can assess your dental health and recommend the best whitening method for you, whether it's in-office treatment, custom trays, or over-the-counter products.
- **Understanding Your Goals:** Identify why you want to whiten your teeth. Are you preparing for a special occasion, or seeking to boost your confidence? Knowing your goal can help your dentist tailor the treatment.
- **Teeth Cleaning:** It's often recommended to have a professional cleaning before whitening. This removes surface stains and plaque, ensuring the whitening product can work more effectively.

### A Look at Different Teeth Whitening Options

There are several approaches to teeth whitening, each with unique benefits. Here are the main options:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **In-Office Whitening:** This method utilizes powerful bleaching agents applied by a dental professional. Results can be seen in just one session, making it an excellent choice for quick transformations.
- **At-Home Kits:** These kits, provided by your dentist, include custom trays for better fit and results. They often take longer to show effects but can provide superior, long-lasting results.
- **Over-the-Counter Products:** Whiteners such as strips, gels, and toothpaste are easily accessible. While they are convenient and cost-effective, they may offer less dramatic results compared to professional treatments.

### Aftercare: Maintaining Your Bright Smile

Post-treatment care is essential to keep your teeth looking vibrant and white.

- **Avoid Staining Foods and Drinks:** Limit consumption of coffee, wine, and berries for the first few days. These can cause discoloration if consumed right after whitening.
- **Practice Good Oral Hygiene:** Regular brushing and flossing prevent plaque buildup and maintain your smile. Use a toothpaste designed for sensitive teeth if needed.
- **Routine Dental Visits:** Schedule regular cleanings to monitor your teeth’s health and touch up any fading of your whitening results.

### The Transformative Effects of Teeth Whitening

The impact of teeth whitening is evident in the before and after results that many individuals experience. Here are some standout changes:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Boost in Confidence:** Many people report feeling more confident in social situations after whitening. A whiter smile can enhance your overall appearance, helping you feel good about yourself.
- **Youthful Appearance:** Bright teeth are often associated with youth. Whitening can take years off your look, making you appear more vibrant and lively.
- **Improved First Impressions:** A bright smile can leave a lasting impression. Whether meeting new people or presenting at work, a well-maintained smile can help you shine.

### Visual Evidence: Before and After Pictures

Many dental offices showcase before-and-after photos from past clients. These images serve as powerful testimonials to the effectiveness of teeth whitening treatments. They illustrate the stark difference that a bright smile can make, reinforcing the decision to pursue this dental care option.

The journey of teeth whitening, from the initial consultation to the final results, is both exciting and empowering. By understanding the processes involved, you can confidently take the first steps toward navigating your own transformation. Remember, a whiter smile is not just about aesthetics; it’s also about enhancing your self-esteem and overall happiness. Let the world see the brightest version of you!

Comparing At-Home and Professional Teeth Whitening Results: What to Expect
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to teeth whitening, many people find themselves torn between at-home kits and professional treatments. Both options promise brighter, whiter smiles, but the results, methods, and expectations can differ greatly. Understanding what each option entails can help you make an informed decision.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### At-Home Teeth Whitening

At-home teeth whitening products are highly accessible. You can purchase them at drugstores, supermarkets, or online. Here are several common forms of at-home teeth whitening:

- **Whitening Toothpaste:** These toothpastes contain mild abrasives and chemical agents to help remove surface stains.
- **Whitening Strips:** Thin, flexible strips coated with a whitening gel that you apply directly to your teeth.
- **Whitening Trays:** Custom or store-bought trays filled with a gel, which you wear for a specified amount of time.
- **Whitening Pens:** Portable devices that allow you to apply a whitening gel directly to your teeth.

Results from at-home products can vary based on the strength of the whitening agents used, your original tooth shade, and how consistently you use the products. Many users report seeing a noticeable difference after a few days to a couple of weeks of regular use. However, these results are often less dramatic compared to professional treatments.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Professional Teeth Whitening

Professional teeth whitening is typically conducted in a dental office. There are a few notable methods that dentists utilize:

- **In-Office Whitening:** This method employs a stronger whitening agent that a dentist applies directly to your teeth, often activated with a special light.
- **Take-Home Kits:** Dentists can provide custom-made trays and a professional-grade whitening gel for you to use at home.

The primary advantage of professional whitening is its efficacy. You can expect to achieve significant results in just one session, sometimes lightening teeth by several shades. Many patients see immediate results, allowing for a more dramatic transformation.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Comparing Results

When comparing at-home and professional whitening methods, you might ask: What kind of results can I expect from each?

- **Speed of Results:** Professional whitening often provides immediate results, while at-home products may take longer to show effects.
- **Effectiveness:** In-office options tend to lighten teeth more substantially due to the concentration of the whitening agents.
- **Longevity:** Results from professional treatment can last anywhere from six months to two years, depending on your dental hygiene and lifestyle. At-home products typically require more frequent touch-ups.
- **Cost:** At-home options are more budget-friendly, while professional treatments can be more expensive due to their effectiveness and quick results.

### What to Expect Locally

Individual results can vary widely based on several factors, including baseline tooth color, age, and lifestyle choices like diet and smoking. Here are some personal goals to consider before you choose:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- Assess your current tooth shade. Are you looking for a subtle improvement, or do you seek a striking transformation?
- Consider your time frame. Do you need results right away? Professional whitening is your best choice.
- Think about your budget. How much are you willing to spend?

### Post-Whitening Care

Regardless of which option you choose, post-whitening care is vital for maintaining your new smile. Avoiding certain foods and beverages—like coffee, red wine, and soda—can help minimize staining. Regular brushing and flossing, combined with routine dental check-ups, will keep your teeth looking their best.

The choice between at-home and professional teeth whitening boils down to your specific needs. If you desire fast, significant results and are willing to invest in your smile, professional whitening is the way to go. However, if you prefer a cost-effective option and have some patience, at-home kits can still lead to a beautiful smile, albeit over a longer period.

### Conclusion

Teeth whitening can be a life-changing experience for many individuals, significantly boosting self-confidence and enhancing smiles. The transformative effects of undergoing teeth whitening treatments are evident when comparing before and after results. For those who have felt embarrassed or self-conscious about their teeth, the noticeable change can lead to a remarkable shift in how they perceive themselves and how others perceive them.

When considering the journey to a brighter smile, it's essential to weigh the options between at-home and professional teeth whitening. At-home kits may offer convenience and affordability, but the results can vary widely based on individual commitment and technique. On the other hand, professional whitening treatments, while often more expensive, tend to deliver more dramatic and consistent outcomes. Factors such as the strength of the whitening agents and precise application by a dental professional play a crucial role in achieving optimal results.

Ultimately, the choice between these methods will depend on your personal goals, budget, and willingness to maintain teeth whitening for lasting results. Regardless of the path you choose, celebrating the “after” phase is important. It’s not simply about having whiter teeth but also about how they can enhance your overall appearance and self-esteem. Whether you opt for at-home treatments or professional services, taking the plunge into teeth whitening can lead to a rewarding and empowering experience, giving you the bright smile you’ve always dreamed of. Remember, every smile has the potential to shine brilliantly!

 Hello! So 2 months ago I moved to a new town and got a job as a barista at a European-inspired cafe, now I'm moving back to my hometown and have to quit this job. I've been spoiled by having great coffee at my fingertips at work and I'd love to continue that even when I'm not working at a coffee shop anymore. I knew nothing about espresso before getting this job, and I've learned a lot! I was trained by several very experienced baristas so I have a decent amount of knowledge and skill but am still very new to this universe. Basically I want a set up that's not crazy complicated, but is also not fully automated. I want to be able to froth milk by hand (it will be plant-based milks only, if that makes a difference) but other than that, I don't need anything too crazy. I already know how to calibrate the grind, use a scale/timer to calibrate the shot, etc. I'm not trying to go balls deep on a $6000 machine or get too deep into the technical side of it, like tinkering with the innards of a machine or whatever, but I want to actually make the espresso myself and not have the machine do every single step. I'm located in canada and not trying to break the bank on this, but I don't want to cheap out on a garbage machine either.

My parents got divorced over a decade ago. It was a messy divorce (my dad had to leave weeks at a time due to work, which led to my mom cheating on him).

My grandma (moms side of the family) has been close with me and my siblings ever since my mom let her back into our lives. (I don't know the reasons for why they had a falling out, but they are both very stubborn and opinionated people).

Since my dad had shared custody over me and my siblings, he and my grandma stayed in contact. That's understandable since i was young and still wanted to see my grandma even if i was at my dads.

The problem that i have is that, years later, my grandma still talks to my dad regularly, and even comes by his house for coffee.

I understand that grown people can choose to hang out with whoever they'd like, but after putting myself in my moms shoes i would feel betrayed that my mom talks to my ex behind my back. It would make more sense if it was a divorce where my parents chose to stay friends and keep in contact, but it's much different than that.
My mom claims to have been abused (verbally) by my dad, and there has been an instance where the cops showed up to our house (idk who called the cops on who, i was 4).

I am currently staying at my dads this upcoming week, and we are planning to have a supper/dinner which includes me, my siblings, my dad, my step-mom, and my grandma. My grandma is skeptical about driving here because she doesn't want my mom to see her car in my dads driveway, so i guess i'm going to have to pick her up.
(knowing my mom, if she finds out, she will freak out on everybody for going behind her back and will cut off my grandma).

I'm not sure if i have a say in this, because i want to keep the peace but i also feel it is wrong to do this to my mom (even though i don't like her much to begin with).

Just hoping to get an outside perspective on this shitty situation. Thanks

Another good site for tips on home bluing.

Bluing, like any other finishing process is all about the prep work. If your prep work isn’t of good quality, no amount of effort or time at bluing can make the parts look good. 
The parts should be completely stripped and polished bright and shiny. The better you prep, the better the result. A nice bluing job after a complete and high-quality prep job looks very nice.

**Warning: These chemicals are very alkaline. That is high on the PH scale.  If any amount gets on the skin, it will burn it (Vinegar can help stop the burning).  If it gets in the eye, you are blind in that eye instantly! No Dr. can help you.  The eye is blind.  You must use a face shield and/or goggles at all times and be super careful! Don’t be careless. Don’t get distracted. Pay close attention to what you are doing the entire time. Heed this warning. I cannot stress it enough! **


****Ken Mays procedure and Homemade Hot Blue Formula****
All ""bluing"" is really blacking. The blue shine is due to additional chemicals such as manganese that are added to the mix. They are usually less abrasion resistant than blacking and perforce are thinner to give the blue refraction. They are a lot fussier to do and the results vary more than straight blacking on different metal alloys and heat treatment in my experience. I generally use a lye, fertilizer mix that gives the hardest blacking I have ever seen and it’s so simple anyone can do it, plus the ingredients are available at the hardware store rather than paying UPS hazardous shipment fees. 
The mix ratio is 5 lbs. lye (sodium hydroxide) to 2 1/2 lbs. ammonium nitrate (fertilizer), to 1 gallon distilled or clean rainwater. (No rainwater from polluted industrial cities or collected off a roof which can have impurities from the roofing material, gutter and down-spouts.  Get rainwater collected directly into a plastic or non-reactive container and free from industrial pollution.) 

Here is the balanced chemical equation.

NH4NO3 (aq) + NaOH (aq) → NaNO3 (aq) + NH3 (aq) + H2O (l)
Reactants:

NH4NO3 – Ammonium nitrate 
Other names: Nitric acid, ammonium salt 
Appearance: White/grey solid that is often sold in small graduals 

NaOH
Names: Sodium hydroxide 
Appearance: White, waxy, opaque 
Products: drain cleaner

NaNO3 – Sodium nitrate 
Other names: Peru saltpeter 
Appearance: White powder or colorless crystals 

NH3
Names: Ammonia
Appearance: Colourless gas

H2O – Water, oxidane 
Other names: Water (H2O) 
Appearance: White crystalline solid, almost colorless liquid with a hint of blue, colorless gas




Granular lye can be ordered online from pluming sites or soap making sites or found in some home stores, hardware stores and plumbing supply stores] and ammonium nitrate fertilizer (at least 30%). Make sure you are buying actual ammonium nitrate; many brands today are made from urea or some other source.
 https://ammoniumnitrateforsale.com/ (Possible source of high quality amonium nitrate. I have used this to great effect)
 Make sure to not use tap water. Buy distilled or use clean rainwater. Some claim that rainwater works best.  
If ammonium nitrate is not obtainable, sodium or potassium nitrate can be substituted at close to the same ratio.  (See below)
To keep the concentration of nitrate equal to the original formula (ammonium nitrate), you have to use 6.25 percent more if you are using 16-0-0 nitrate of soda is used, which is sodium nitrate.  26.5 percent more if you use potassium nitrate stump remover. Also, with sodium nitrate, the temp. boils at a lower temp.  253 to around 265-270 max operating temperature as opposed to 290.  

Mix outdoors as lots (and I mean LOTS) of ammonia gas evolves and will rot your lungs out if you sniff it. (Not an issue with sodium nitate recipe) Wear goggles as this stuff foams and bubbles like mad. There will be a very violent exothermic reaction. Mix in an iron pail (not galvanized). [I use a 16qt enameled stock pot.] Once mixed and operating, the bath, will have no off gassing, but the vapors are corrosive so don't do it in your gun room or machine shop. Use plenty of ventilation. [I added water first, then added 1lb of lye and alternated with fertilizer. Add slowly to avoid boil over. Also, use a full-face shield and a respirator that will filter out ammonia. It’s good to do the initial mixing outside until the ammonia is done off gassing. After mixing, the solution will be over 100 degrees, even with no heat source, due to the heat of the reaction. EXOTHERMIC. I like to do this outside.   
The bath operates at 275 to a max of 290-degree F.  I find 295 just a bit too hot.  It can cause a red slag, or smut, to build up on the outside of the blued surface and must be wiped off after boiling. Remember that thermometers are not perfectly accurate. It sometimes takes a bit of experimenting to get the temperature correct.  If you don't have a thermometer, heat until a sample part will just sizzle cold water. [I use a steel deep fry thermometer. Make sure the one you buy will reach the bottom of your pot without touching.  This is the hottest part of the pot. Many thermometers only go in about 4 inches.  This may explain why my solutions works better at lower temperature readings on my thermometer.  I also use a propane deep fryer kit. Takes 15 to 45 min. depending on the steel and how dense a film you want. [I removed my gun after 20 minutes.] With nickel steel you will find it takes longer and the temp might need to be just a bit higher to get a good blue. This will be seen with guns like the nickel steel versions of the Winchester Model 12. Some smiths get the temp as high as 325 for nickel steel. Too hot, however, and the solution is ruined.  
Suspend the parts with steel wire to keep them away from the bottom and sides of the pot. Ideally you want to have a vigorously boiling solution surrounding the parts on all sides. If they get into a hot spot, you will often see red smut on the parts, or it may impart a plum color to the blue. Small parts can be strung together with iron wire or placed into a steel basket.
After you are done, take parts out, put them in cold water for 10 minutes then rinse in clean hot water or boil them in hot water for 10-15 minutes. [I like to have a smaller pot of water near boiling to rinse the parts. This is the best way to wash away the lye, which will begin to congeal as it cools. Lye left on the parts will cause rust later on. Don’t skip this step. Dry and oil.  I like Marvel Mystery oil. Brownells makes an oil specifically for this but it’s expensive.  You are ready to go. If you don't like the depth of color after it's dry, after you boil the parts, and before you oil it, just put it back in the bath and cook it some more. 
The bath will do 10 to 15 jobs before you have to add about 1 lb. lye to a 5-gal bath to make up for boil off. Add water as required to keep the concentrations correct, but this does not seem critical. 
You MUST add enough water at bath cool down, to more than make up for boil off or it will solidify, and you can't re-melt easy. If you add too much, it will just boil off next time. [This stuff takes several hours to cool back down. Once it gets hot, it really stays hot for a while.]
Make sure the parts are clean before you suspend them in the salts. Any oil will ruin the bath and job. Boil parts in TSP, Oakite, 909 or such first. I found some TSP at Home Depot. Acetone or Simple Green is used to good effect by some. I like non chlorinated brake cleaner.  Be sure to cold water bath everything before the parts go into the bluing tank. Be sure you have wiped away any water spots, or they will show up under the bluing.
Store in glass or plastic jugs between use, if it crystalizes, it is shot. (At least it will take a bit of effort and heating time to get the crystals back into solution.) 
You do not have to plug the barrel bore as the magnetite film is harder than the steel and, if anything, should improve it. Possibly a little chemical milling too. I have made test coupons and put them in an open beaker of water for a month with no corrosion. Even light sanding will not break down the surface.  If you do plug the bore, pressure can build up inside the barrel and pop out the plug violently.  This can cause the bluing solution to splatter all over, which is obviously not good. (See warning on page one.)  


Helpful Tips
 The homemade salts are great for nearly anyone doing small jobs -- it is very quick and economical to heat only 1 gallon of salts, blue the parts, and shutdown in less than an hour start to finish. 
I have not had bad or funky results with the homemade recipe. It works great even though I have not intentionally abused the process to find all potential pitfalls. If the item is clean and prepared properly the lye will finish ""degrease"" the part while the solution is heating up. I have even added parts that were degreased with Simple Green, quickly bead blasted, and then added to the salts and still gotten good results. I am not sure how many sessions I will get but it is nice to know the salts are inexpensive and there are no hazardous shipping fees or large quantity minimums needed or wasted.

Pitfalls
With the recipe the sodium nitrate salts will boil @ around 253 degrees Fahrenheit. Note the boiling point is directly related to the amount of water, as the water boils off the salts will slowly increase temperature and if allowed will fail to blue.  Too hot and the color is more of a red/bronze. Do this and if the salts get hotter than around 330 degrees the high temperature will destroy the salts. The salts will blue in a temperature window in the 253-280 range. With sodium nitrate the temp. boils at a lower temp.  253 to around 265-270 max operating temperature. (275-290 for ammonium nitrate recipe) Use carefully ladled distilled cold water to drop the temp back down, don’t add water to parts in the boil. (Use a steel dipper ladle.  Carefully add or you will have solution and water spatter all over!) Plan ahead and allow 20-30 minutes to boil. So, if the salts start boiling at 275 degrees after 30 minutes the temperature will rise even higher and risk failing to blue or worse overheating and turning the steel red/bronze then eventually destroying the salts.  

At first boil around 253 degrees (275 if ammonium nitrate is used), put your parts in the mix. As the temperature gets above 275 (290 with ammonium nitrate recipe.) Sometimes the reading will need to show higher due to inaccuracies on the thermometer and if the thermometer doesn’t go deep enough into the solution. Use a ladle and slowly add cold distilled water. It will bubble and steam, so allow the salts to enter the ladle to avoid spewing fluids. Dump it in and it will splatter hot alkaline lye everywhere, get it in your eyes and you’re blinded (No doctor can help you at this point!  You are permanently blind. I use a face shield and goggles to avoid permanent loss of vision. Does it seem like hyperbole? It’s not. Be careful!) If the mix gets on your skin, even the slightest amount, you will know it, to stop the burning neutralize it with white vinegar. I pour it in a towel and wipe the area and instant relief occurs.
If you have too much water, it will boil below 253 (below 275 if ammonium nitrate is used) degrees. Too much and it boils at a higher temp. Just keep boiling it until it gets to above 253 (or 275) degrees, boiling the excess water off then, put your parts in at the correct temperature range.
You can use TSP in boiling tap water to degrease parts. Don’t touch the surface with anything other than fresh clean white paper towel, the faintest oil will give an uneven color.
Disposal is a big issue for any of these salts and neutralizing the sodium hydroxide can be done with vinegar, water, and a PH test kit. I have heard of people putting the results down the drain, but I will not recommend disposal methods except to say consult the local waste disposal or sewer authorities and follow their rules. I consider disposal costs to be part of the job and I would not consider illegal disposal an option. 
I may do more experiments with future batches. Steel is the only metal I let come in contact with the salts. I stick to steel or non-reactive materials for everything. I know some people say stainless steel would work fine, but I do not use it for the pot -- some say the pot can be stainless, but others say it can affect the results. I find the enamel pots work great and are not that expensive. 

Aluminum will destroy your salts with a quickness and makes hydrogen gas, not wise around an open flame-boom! The enamel pots do ok but the glaze is eaten off fairly quickly and will need replaced. For the cost of two pots a black steel half tank from Brownells can be bought for around $50. The tank will need a batch and half of salts to fill the tank a little over half full.
The depth of the blackening color increases with more time in the bath and a repeat session can be done if there are touch-ups or to add more/depth of color. I found the exact same results from the process, and it matches perfectly even after sanding, filing, bead blasting, etc. I scratched a part and just filed off the scratch, did a quick bead blast, and returned to the salts and reblued the exposed steel until it matched the rest of the part. If I cover the heated salts and turn off the heat it stays hot for quite a while so I can bring it back up to boil in 5 to 10 minutes for rework or additional sessions post inspection/cleanup on the first run. 
I prefer to watch the pot while it is going, so I never leave it unattended while doing cleanup. 

(Not circulating the salts can produce an uneven color. I agitate it and move the parts, hanging from an untreated wood square rod and use a mild steel rod-not galvanized to stir the hot salts.) 
The ingredients and process are so simple nearly anyone can make it. If you can make instant coffee, you can make this bluing recipe!

SHOPPING LIST:

Chemicals:

(5) 16 oz or 18 oz containers of Sodium Hydroxide (lye), Recommended Brand: Lewis Red Devil Lye Drain Opener (100% Lye). It must say 100% lye. Drain openers that explicitly say 100% lye are acceptable, however, any drain opener that does not say 100% lye will not work! Lewis Red Devil Lye is a very common item so it should be available at a local home center, hardware or grocery store. The package is an 18oz container that costs about $3.19.  I used Santeen drain cleaner in 2018, that I bought at Menards. As of June 2020, they still carry this brand.
(It has been brought to my attention that Red Devil Drain opener is no longer available.)
After a bit more research I did find that tech-grade sodium hydroxide is still available for sale at a variety of places with the most common being those that supply the homemade soap and candle making hobbies. I went ahead and ordered 10 lbs. and with shipping it still only came out to $3.00 a pound which is comparable to the Red Devil lye if it had still been available. I

(food service lye is the cheapest at around $3/2lbs) 

(1)	4 Pound Box/Bag of Sodium Nitrate (Nitrate of Soda), Recommended Brand(s): Bonide Nitrate of Soda Fertilizer, Dragon Nitrate of Soda Fertilizer, Hoffman Nitrate of Soda Fertilizer. This item is Sodium Nitrate and comes in 4lb bags or boxes. Garden centers and hardware stores carry this or can get it. It is listed as containing 16-0-0 or 15-0-0 Nitrate Nitrogen. If you prefer, you can order online by using a search engine such as google.com, froogle.com, shopping.yahoo.com, or bizrate.com to search for ""Nitrate of Soda"" and you will find merchants that sell it from $6.49 for 4lbs to $14.95 for 8lbs.  I used ammonium nitrate fertalizer.   34-0-0

https://ammoniumnitrateforsale.com/
Ammonium nitrate 34-0-0 is supposedly better than of nitrate of soda 16-0-0. (Sodium nitrate or ammonium nitrate or potassium nitrate when used with lye, sodium hydroxide, to make bluing salts) Use almost the same proportions.  2.5lbs of ammonium nitrate and 5lbs of lye.  With the nitrate of soda 16-0-0 use 6.25 percent more fertalizer and with potassium nitrate stump remover use 26.5 percent more stump remover.  

(Hi-Yield nitrate can be purchased at the Macon feed store and shipped.) 

(2) 1 Gallon Containers of Distilled Water. Some people have no trouble with tap water, but I think it must be distilled so it does not contain minerals and it is available at every grocery store. I prefer to keep track of the water I add to the salts.  Good clean rainwater can also be used.  No acid rain or water that comes off a roof!  Too many contaminates.   




Equipment:

(1) 16 Quart Graniteware or Enamelware Stock Pot/Seafood Steamer Pot (size works great for pistols). Do NOT buy aluminum. I have seen the enamel type of pots available online and in camping supply stores. I purchased from http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com for $19.95 plus shipping. Other containers of a similar size that are steel or black iron will also work. Mills Fleet Farm in 2018 had 15.5-quart steel/porcelain pots that are enameled.  

(1) Propane burner and propane tank setup. I purchased a Turkey Fryer setup. You can select any setup and the aluminum or stainless pot will work great for post bluing cleaning/boiling to remove the salts. Most of these setups include a pot, thermometer, and the burner with regulator and cost from $30 to about $50 from home centers, hardware stores, or online.  I have used the stove but mixed the ammonium outside on the grill burner until the ammonium gas stops coming out. 
The salt vapors will eat aluminum, whatever your heat source, insure it has generous ventilation. Clean up the area with towels soaked in vinegar-neutralizer, clean that with water. Stainless steel is not recommended. It imparts a color variation. The stainless in the thermometer and the ladle-mixing cold water back in to reduce the boiling point all seem to have no detrimental effect. 

(1) spool of ductile black iron/steel wire. Must be steel and appear either rusty or black. This is found in many home centers and hardware stores. Dip the wire into a degreaser to remove oil and diluted muriatic acid bath to prep for use. 

(obtained at ACE hardware as well as the TSP degreasing powder-added to boiling tap water) 

(1) steel stir stick for mixing ingredients and stirring the bath to get the salts into solution when re-heating. Can be found in home centers and hardware stores. Select a piece 18"" to 24"" in length, 1/8"" diameter to 3/16"" diameter. You will know when the salts are ready when the stir stick starts to blue.

(As you mix in the Nitrate the rod will turn a gorgeous dark color when it gets hot enough. One idea I have had is to use a new steel stick each time. That way you will know when the salts are hot enough to blue steel. If it blues the stick, it should be close to where it blues the gun parts. Variations in metallurgy notwithstanding.)  

(1) 2-gallon plastic container with lid. Available at home centers in the paint department for storing the bluing salts between uses. Let the solution cool, then scrape out the pot and put the salts and solution into the pail. 

Don’t put your salts away without slowly adding-ladling cold water back in to drop the temperature and prevent a rock-hard block to deal with the next time you plan to hot blue) 

SAFETY: Lye is poisonous, corrosive, and can cause severe burns if not handled carefully. The heated solution can burn you. Follow all safety warnings for the chemicals and the equipment and always mix in the recommended order out of doors in adequate ventilation. Never breathe the vapors, stand up-wind or at a safe distance when possible, and protect your eyes from the vapors or splashes. Rinse any solution from skin immediately. 

(Wipe the skin with vinegar/neutralizer-DO NOT get this in your eyes, it’s worse than acid.  It will permanently blind you! See the pattern here? I cannot stress enough that you must protect your eyes.)

MIXING: (All mixing should be done outside in good ventilation). Use a metal 16 Quart Steamer Stock Pot. Setup the heating source (propane turkey fryer burner). 

1. Add 1 gallon of water into the pot.

2. Use a scale to measure five pounds of lye into a container. Slowly add 1 cup at a time to the room temperature water. Stir with a steel stir rod until each addition is dissolved into solution. If you add too much, it will clump on the bottom and be more difficult to dissolve. Continue to slowly add the lye -- the solution will heat up and there will be some fumes as the lye dissolves into solution. Avoid breathing fumes and go slowly with the mixing. 

(The lye will heat up to about 150+ degrees without a heat source.) 

3. Place the pot of lye solution on the burner and start heating until the solution is warm. 

(It’s pretty darn warm already.) 

4. Use a scale to measure 2 1/2 pounds of the 34-0-0 Fertilizer into a container. 6.25 percent more if 16-0-0 sodium nitrate is used instead of ammonium nitrate. 26.5 percent more if potassium nitrate stump remover is used. Slowly add the fertilizer to the lye solution in the pot, stirring gently and allowing it to dissolve. As the temperature comes up closer to the boil, the fertilizer will go into solution.
Congratulations, you have just mixed your bluing salts!

STORAGE:

If you are not planning to use the salts immediately, turnoff the burner and allow the solution to cool back to near room temperature. When the solution is not hot or too warn, you can pour the liquid into a plastic storage container and scrape the crystals to loosen and add them to the plastic storage container too. Rubber gloves and a plastic scraper help to completely clean out the crystals in the pot. Wash the residue from the pot with plenty of water to dilute and rinse it away. 


BLUING:
Heat the solution until it reaches a minimum of 253 to 265 degrees F (Higher, like 275, if ammonium nitrate is used) and is vigorously boiling. Suspend the parts to blue using the steel wire to suspend them from a rod or piece of wood across the top of the pot. Let them remain in the boiling solution for 20 to 30 minutes depending on the steel and the depth of finish desired.
Allowing the parts to stay in contact with the pot-creates hot spots, try and keep the parts just below the surface-the hottest level of the boiling salts and I use untreated wood to adjust the height of the steel being blued.)
When you remove the items from the salts, they are very hot. Place them into hot but not boiling water for about 10 minutes to flush the salts out of any threads or captive areas. Dry and inspect. If the item is not blackened to your satisfaction or there are areas where it is not even return it to the solution and let it go longer. When final color is reached and the part is washed of all salts, completely coat the part in oil (WD-40, Gun Oil, Marvel Mystery Oil). I have also submerged the parts in warmed oil overnight before hanging them up and letting the excess drip off. I have not seen adverse effects from wiping down the parts and admiring the beautiful black finish immediately.
(For small parts with many nooks, I use an ultrasonic cleaner and hot water to cleanse the salts out. Be very careful of nooks-holes and barrels. The hot metal will vaporize water and vent steam wherever the up end is pointed) 

TECHNICAL ISSUES:
Items can sometimes be covered with a soot -- this seems to be caused by excess heating, usually the result of letting the part sit on the bottom of the pot where the burner is elevating the temperatures. Other times, it just seems to happen for unexplained reasons. Underneath the soot, the finish is black, so let I always let it run and remain patient. After removing from the salts, I place the part in a warm water bath and use a paper towel, rag, or a toothbrush to scrub off the soot. It will scrub or rub off and the finish underneath is usually very nice and black. Pipe cleaners will remove soot from small holes or screw threads. Once the surface looks clean, you can either return it to the salts for a few minutes or continue in a full hot water rinse, dry and oiling process.

(The toothbrush works well; I will also wipe with white paper towel to check the color depth. Irregular, mottled or too light put back in the salts for an extra 10 minutes or so.) 

Items that do not blue or appear plum colored usually need a little more time in the solution. Various steels blue differently, and contaminants on the surface can lend a hand in making the process go funky. Usually, a good degreasing and return to the solution, use of a slightly higher temperature or a longer time will get them black.
Too hot and the bluing process will slow, the heat rises, and the color turns more red bronze.
If you have touch-ups or areas with defects that you want to fix you can return to the solution after corrective measures and a degreasing. I usually do touch-ups immediately while the salts are still running so I can assure the results come out the same. 
If you add lots of parts to the solution, it seems to take a little longer than when doing smaller bit of parts or touch-ups. 
Ken Mays has more extensive experience with the original formula. Practical use is the same, but his recipe and mixing is different because ammonium nitrate fertilizer has several negatives: First, it gets attention from the FBI, and you can end up ""a person of interest"". Second, when adding it to the lye, copious amounts of concentrated ammonia gas are produced, and ammonia is very dangerous to living things! After his salts are mixed and working things are the same as what I am using, although he reports his solution boils at a higher temperature.  

Experiments with the temperature may be needed.  In my experience these are the temperature ranges in degrees Fahrenheit. 
Sodium nitrate-Nitrate of soda 253-275 
Ammonium Nitrate up to 285 or 290.  
Much higher and I have gotten a red slag or smut build up on the outside of the bluing.  290 might even be pushing it.  I start by getting the solution boiling at around 260 and drop in the parts.  As water boils out the boiling temp gets higher.  I generally don’t let it get above 285 by using a steel dipper to slowly add distilled water.  Thermometers are not perfectly accurate and this needs to be kept in mind.  Also remember that how deep the thermometer is in the solution and where in the pot it is placed will also affect the temperature readings.     

I like to soak the parts in Marvel Mystery Oil for at least two days.  I completely submerge them. Somtimes I will duct tape a hand warmer to the plastic pail.  Heated oil works well. The reaction is still going, as there is some off gassing, and the oil keeps water away.  Bluing is a bit tender for the first day or two so, it’s better to wait a while before reassembling and using the firearm.  Rubbing the parts down with bit of mineral oil and brown paper bag can even out slight shade differences and deepen the bluing.  000 steel wool and mineral oil has been used by some.  Either way one needs to treat new bluing with care. CLP, Lucas, Hoppes or G96, which is what I like, can then be applied just like one would to any gun.   
With reasonable safety measures an awesome dark black oxide (“known as bluing”) rich color can be obtained. The salts can be reused. I know some who have gotten as many as 15 guns done with the same batch. Give yourself a good half-day to do this. It is not an effort to be rushed.

The Bluing Procedure is Simplicity itself.  It consists of the following basic steps after the gun has been polished.
 1 - Clean the properly polished gun and parts in Dicro-Clean 909™.  Or degrease somehow. 
2 - Rinse and scrub in cold, clean water.
 3 - Immerse in mixed and heated bluing salts solution for 15 to 30 minutes (I have done as long as 45 to get a nice deep black oxide finish).
 4 - Rinse and scrub in cold, clean water. 
5 - Rinse in hot, almost boiling, water.   
6 - Immerse in Water Displacing Oil. 
7 - Apply optional “after-treatments”, if desired

Hint: If you take the gun or parts out of the bluing solution to check them, don’t do it for long.  The salts can dry on the gun or parts. Then, when you are done, you will have spots on the metal. If you take them out of the bluing solution to check them, put them in the cold water so as not to dry out the salts. Then if they are not ready put them back into the bluing solution for more time.    

STEP-BY-STEP BLUING PROCEDURE per Brownell’s for those interested. 

1. SUSPEND PARTS IN FRESH 909 CLEANING SOLUTION to remove all dirt, grease oil and crud. “Cleanliness is Next to Godliness” - Always! Operating Temperature: 180° F. Immersion Time: 10-1 minutes.
2. RINSE CLEANED PARTS in flowing Cold Water Rinse Tank. Scrub parts thoroughly with soft brush to remove all traces of Dicro-Clean 909 Cleaning Solution. Work rapidly. Immersion Time: Not to exceed 2 to 3 minutes.
3.     SUSPEND RINSED PARTS IN THE OXYNATE NO. 7 BLUING SOLUTION. Optimum Operating Temperature: Vigorous rolling boil at 292° F. Typical Time in Bluing Solution: 20-30 minutes.
4. RINSE BLUED PARTS in After-Bluing Cold Water Rinse Tank. Agitate and swish parts around thoroughly to remove all traces of Bluing Solution. When parts have cooled to room temperature in the cold water, carefully examine for blemishes, discolorations, flaws in bluing. 
5. SUSPEND RINSED PARTS IN HOT WATER TANK to remove all final traces of Bluing Solution/Salts. Operating Temperature: Vigorous boil. Immersion Time: -10 minutes for simple parts; 1-30 minutes for complex parts. (Some water sources damage/lighten/remove new bluing with long immersion. Watch carefully. Or.
5B. SUSPEND RINSED PARTS IN B.O.N. TANK instead of Hot Water Rinse Tank. Mixing: 6 oz. (by weight) to 1 gallon water. Operating Temperature: 130° to 140° F. Immersion Time: With intermittent agitation, 30-4 minutes. Transfer to Hot Water Tank and complete Step.
6.  SUSPEND HOT RINSED PARTS IN WATER DISPLACING OIL. Transfer the parts quickly to Water Displacing Oil Tank and plunge into tank, agitating vigorously for a minute or so. Allow parts to cool immersed in the Water Displacing Oil. Use full strength. Operating Temperature: Room Temperature; recommended 68° F. min. to 90° F. max. Do Not Heat Oil. Immersion Time: Until cool; typically, 40-60 minutes, to allow maximum displacement of entrapped water.77 or “CURE”.
Remove from Water Displacing Oil Tank and hang on rack over tank to allow excess Oil to drain back into tank. Because new blue is very tender, minimum handling recommended for 24 hours to allow blue to “cure”. When cured, wipe excess oil off parts with soft cloth and reassemble gun.

As the title above goes, may nalaman kasi ako and now I'm kind of hesitant to go out with him even though I feel na he's serious with his intentions. 

To give you guys more context, October this year may na meet akong guy sa isang kilalang spa nd we did the thing sa shower. Lets just call him V (26M) The next day after our shower encounter, we decided to check in and hook up. Which was a better scenario compared sa shower sex.

We kinda vibed so we decided to go out on a date. But before we actually went out on a date, I had to go to Taiwan for a week of vacation and it happens to be with my ex suitor who I decided to reject months before kasi that time I really don't see myself with him in the long run but the Taiwan trip was prebooked and we happened to be kind of friends after the courtship ended. So sinabi ko to lahat kay V before ko magpunta ng Taiwan and although he understood, he wasn't too happy about it. 

After I got back from Taiwan, V and I decided to meet and he took me to Okada for our very first date. And I feel so happy because it was my first time to go there and we watched the dancing fountain. I felt really contented. We ate at this nice restaurant inside Okada and then I gave him a gift that I got for him from Taiwan. 

After the date which I think a perfect date at least, he started to become cold sa replies niya and I feel a lot more anxious than happy. I exerted so much effort into connecting with him but then his one word replies made me really sick. The fall out was too fast and I feel really upset kasi siyempre I thought that was it. Na finally, maiinlove na ako. And I told him that the next time a guy would express interest towards him, wag niya sanang i-take for granted. 

Fast forward. Since wala namang deeper level yung connection namin, I let myself become available sa dating pools again. Coz why not? 

Then I met this guy, lets call him P (28M). But this time, I am more reserved and guarded. Which made P do extra effort to chase me. I feel his sincerity and pure heart. And whenever we go out, I always offer to pay for the date or at least half of it so I can share some effort kasi hatid sundo niya ako pero he always decline saying he doesn't believe in 50/50 sa dating. He asked me out, he's responsible for the bills all through out. 

P started to flex me sa socmed. Posting stories of our date and I feel extremely confused thinking everything's too good to be true. So I guarded myself some more but I still entertain him diligently kasi I genuine like him too. We have mutual interest with each other and there were no mixxed signals. 

Just when I am finally ready to put my guard down, to finally show vulnerability, I received long rage message from V. 

He said some horrible words to me saying I'm a slut, snake and petty. He then told me that the guy (P) who I'm currently dating was his ex-boyfriend who broke his heart in the worst way possible. He told all of these in details and accusing me of hurting him some more. Told me that I am so petty kasi I dated his ex. And I can feel, considering the words that came out of that long rage message. He's definitely not over P.
 
God knows how much I wanted to tell him that I'm honestly not aware about them but then I was hurt with the words he said I just replied ""Bite me"" and then proceeded to play along with his running rage. I embodied the pettiness he is accusing me of and smash him more. I feel guilty of course kasi I'm not the kind of guy who would take revenge like that kasi honestly if I really did that kind of thing, what he is accusing me of is so fucked up nd straight up petty talaga. But I am completely unaware. And how would I possibly know? V and I never went to that stage where we talk about exes except that Taiwan trip of mine. 

I haven't told P about all these yet. And our first meet was a chance encounter at a coffee shop. I don't have any idea who he was before I met him so I was questioning every decisions I made. Thinking what if sinadya ko? What if I stalked V to find something I can use to get back at him and hurt him? I am questioning my reality. 

P is asking me out ulit and wants me to meet his friends. I can feel sincerity sa intentions niya but I am completely fazed with what I discovered that I can't bring myself to respond sa kanya. 

Should I continue seeing him? Now that I am aware of the history, if I continue seeing him, wouldn't that make me a bad guy?

I'm torn right now.

Angelino breathed heavily, on the verge of a panic trying to recollect himself. ""No... I'm sorry... I'm *sorry*...""

There was something still angry and full of vitriol within the man, pouring an endless stream of tears from his eyes yet staring with the provocation that *make one sudden move, and I'll* ***kill*** *you in an instant.* Fear kept those weaker than him in line, but *'fear'* wasn't the way things *should* be.

He was *not* an image of terror and destruction. He was not a mere dragon. He was someone who [loved](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1h3rjqz/comment/m0hzxjg).

...was he? He had to be. ""You don't really want to stand alone at the edge of the world, do you?""

""One day, someone will see that your crown is formed from fear and fool's gold. When that happens, they will topple your hoard and pillage all you love. It will be a dishonorable and disgraceful death.""

He doesn't have many more words; after all, in the end of all things, he wasn't really better. So who was he to direct the Kid on his path? …but he could at least try to give his advice.

""Come train with me."" He cleared his throat from all the shouting. ""You can be strong in a real way.""

Kid stared back at him, tears pouring from his eyes—and yet, he was quiet. The man before him was one he hated. He had showed so much kindness to everyone here, and that *infuriated* him, but to Kid’s utter bewilderment, for once in his miserable life *he had not been ignored.* Angelino’s voice forced him, for once, to a complete and utter stop. For once, Kid Savage stood perfectly still.

“I-I work at a gym, fucker…” He barely managed to force, his voice sounding a lot less scary than he’d like. “...C-Come by sometime. If you want. I g-guess.” 

Angelino smiled wide. “Sure. Let’s, um, treat those wounds, now, haha…”

**Scenario: Somewhere in eastern Europe, Weeks Ago — 4:17 PM**

On a windy street, in a brick-and-mortar building that looks about the same as—if a little more clean than—its neighbors, there sat a half-full parking lot. It seemed like any other office building, save that the front doors were blacked out, so nobody ever paid it any mind.

Within its austere halls, among its many conference rooms, break rooms, and ready-made pots of coffee, there was one active meeting of note. Three people, all with dossiers in hand, sat in practical silence in various positions around a central table. Of the twelve chairs at it, only one was taken. In this tense atmosphere, one could only hear the sounds of the woman at the table drinking tea from a coffee mug, the man by the window turning the pages of his dossier, and the person pacing at the front of the room.

[“Æther Realm…”](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1ejhqac/) Major Tom turned from the window towards the table, his words shattering the apparent silence. “Do we have the full breadth of their activities in the region, or is this it?”

“They were [quashed](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1gt2922/), and we've recovered a fair bit.” The once-pacing person stopped in their tracks, her white lab coat hiding the cacophony of pinks and magentas that composed her outfit. While Lingua Ignota was an anthropologist at heart, her cross-disciplinary work led her to study, if not the Nightblooms themselves, those who studied them. “When Terminus pulled out following the [debacle at Showtek](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1djxytw/), Æther Realm swooped in and continued their research.”

The hitherto quiet woman at the head of the table, bedecked in warm crimson and orange robes, spoke clearly. “It's enough to digest, is it not?” Her hand pressed her coffee mug against the conference room table. “We have at least enough to sift through what they accomplished.”

Major Tom stroked his chin. “True enough.” He crossed the floor, heading for the table with a slow, steady gait. “Stand research and artifact hunting abound on most of these pages.” He looked back and forth between his cohorts while his hand came to rest on a chair. “So, what actionable opinions have the both of you made on those?”

Lingua made for the table, having watched Major Tom take a seat. “The Nightblooms have served as a wellspring of fine data, so it's no surprise that organizations would seek to exploit them.” Lingua sat across from Major Tom, leaving the robed woman practically cornered at the head of the table. 

Major Tom winced. “I won't discount our involvement in that, even if we skate by by not doing things ‘wrong’.”

“We haven't had the chance to do them ‘wrong’ because we didn't have enough incentive to do them in the first place.” Ignota spat. “If generations of warnings weren’t any clue, Showtek’s own ‘Inflorenza’ research dating back centuries confirms that mishandling Nightblooms can be disastrous, and yet firm after firm has thought they were different.”

Another voice perked up at the table, “And firm after firm has fallen for their hubris.”

Lingua practically scoffed at that. “And will the higher ups look any deeper into what's been going on?” Lingua aimlessly flipped through the dossier they'd put down at the table. “For all our apparent clout as a watchdog within the research communities, all Speedwagon could think—or, better, afford—to do was send **a child.**”

“To take pictures and to warn us of anything out of the ordinary,” called Major Tom from across the table, holding onto one of his earmarked pages. “Agent Grace Papaka is a capable lad, if his mission binder is anything to go by.” He flipped it and scanned the page beneath it. “The lack of recent updates is concerning, I'll admit.”

Another scoff came from Lingua, which earned them another stern look from the woman at the head of the table. “The city is in shambles, Tom! Protests rock the streets, businesses with hands in keeping those protestors repressed have been churning out one after another, and-”

“There is a time and place for this, here and now are neither.” The woman at the head of the table picked up her mug. “Yes, we sent an agent into the city, yes, we underestimated the danger, yes, we've lost contact with our agent.” She took a long, slow sip to punctuate her thought. “We can sit here and wallow amongst ourselves over budgets and horrors until the cows crest the horizon, or we can do the sensible thing and send someone to check on our agent.”

Major Tom gave the woman a nod. “Who would we send, given the circumstances?”

Lingua gave the woman a tidy glare, one she packed up behind a set of crossed arms. “I doubt Speedwagon is willing to chip any more of its budget our way, at least for now.” Lingua's eyes turned to the open page on their dossier, where a picture of a dormant Nightbloom stared back at them.

The woman at the head of the table finished her tea. “I'll go.” She pressed her mug against the table. “Our higher ups won't mind sending an old lady home, and if I bring back research notes or materials, all the better.” 

Both of the woman's tablemates gave her soft, if knowing, stares. “Waiting gets us nowhere, and we have a potentially missing field agent.” An almost giddy smile cracked across her face. “Besides, I've been meaning to climb Mount Rakin again for some time now! The dirt in my soles has lost the color of my home.”

Major Tom nodded along. “Whether it's a vacation request or a job on site, I'll do what I can to push the papers through. All I ask is that you be safe out there, Alapu.”

The woman at the head of the table, Alapu Upala, smiled in return. “You have my thanks, Major. I don't mind the plane ticket price, though I will enjoy having it comped…”

Lingua rolled their eyes in turn. “Field research should be its own reward, but on that topic.” They leaned in close to Apalu. “Tell the bastards at the top what needs to be said. An organization we may be, but where you're headed has killed its kind like the heads of a hydra.”

Major Tom’s orange eye practically burrowed into the side of Lingua's head. “That's why we're going. We aren't in the company of monsters, nor do we carry ourselves like them.” Lingua met Major Tom's burning gaze.

Before she could speak, Apalu stood up from her chair. “There's no time to waste here, at least, not anymore.” She looked back and forth between her compatriots one last time. “Until we meet again, in this cycle or the next.” Apalu pushed her chair in, and left the room.

**Scenario: Showtek Hospital, Mist City — 8:47AM**

Grace Papāka sat in the waiting room, hands folded in his lap, his foot bouncing.

He sighed, feeling his lungs swell with air and knitted muscles pop and stretch. As the discolored crablike flesh beneath his shirt fading to his usual skintone showed, he was a monster who could [survive monsters](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1cjmv3u/), but while he had persisted in the weeks since, the soreness that had followed him the whole while was a reminder of the difference between healing and healing *properly.* Thus, Despite his protests, Nat [had sat him down](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1evnwry/) and demanded he return to Showtek for physical therapy.

Sections of the hospital had been cordoned off for construction after some major incident that he hadn’t been privy to. From beneath the brim of his bucket hat, Grace watched doctors wheel and walk patients across the hallway. The cacophony of babbling newborns, clumsy teenagers, and worried parents filled his ears, but he bowed his head, focusing on the tapping of his feet.

“Mr. Papatika?” A soft voice pressed through the noise, lifting Grace’s head.

*“Papāka,”* he corrected.

“I’m well aware.” A Speedwagon Badge was pushed into his field of vision, held by a small, old woman, one whom Grace would have mistaken for one of the grandmothers accompanying their children. “Dr. Alapu Upala. Paranormal Field Research; we’ve been looking for you, Grace.”

He froze, his expression setting behind his gas as his teeth clenched. He had been sent to Rakin as a Speedwagon Agent, one who was capable of what was assigned of him and then some, only to go AWOL. That he hadn’t been discharged was a miracle, but he had not only failed to save Rakin as he had sworn to do so, he had failed the Foundation. The scars along his side felt rough as he gripped his shirt.

“｢Papatika｣, Pāli for ‘young shoot’ or ‘sprout,’” she recited, sternly, professorially before she crouched down to Grace’s level, gently grasping his hand. “You’re growing, Grace. Speedwagon sent you to scout ahead so we could *assist* you, and take over if necessary.” A calm silence took the air around her.

“You’re not mad at me?”

“I didn’t say that,” Alapu winked before standing. “One day you will be *Parpharīka,* but for now, come with me.”

Grace had to scramble to their feet to chase after Alapu who strode further into the hospital, flashing her badge to get past security and cordons of rope. Soon they had arrived at a patient’s room, Speedwagon agents flanking the door. Alapu turned to Grace, her expression grave. “I’ll ask that you brace yourself, Papāka.”

He nodded.

Alapu opened the door to a woman laying in the hospital bed—a clipboard listed her as ‘Mei Kamino.’ As machines and monitors bleeped and dripped to stabilize her, black ichor continued to weep from her eyes as her body wasted away, silicon based mosses sprouting along her skin. Death had crept into her ribcage, hollowing it out to create for itself a garden, yet her expression was one of rapture as she was being swallowed by the flower that parasitized in chest.

“I arrived in Rakin [a few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1h3rjqz/) and saw these sprouting along Mount Parapollah.” Alapu bowed her head in silent prayer before continuing. For what, Grace couldn’t tell. “Given all that happened at Showtek, getting Speedwagon to look into these ‘Nightshades’ was easy, but research is slow, and all the while this infection spreads.”

*You should have reported this,* rang out in Grace’s head, but before he could dwell on the thought, she presented him a small black flower, not dissimilar from the one in Mei’s chest. He looked apprehensively between it and Alapu.

“Ah, the Nightblooms have also taught you well, I see,” she chuckled slightly. “I have full faith in your ability to survive it, and in my own to save you.”

With a few breaths to ready himself, a claw lashed out to grab the flower and stuffed it into Grace’s mouth. 

Immediately a cloyingly darkness flooded his throat and his senses, one that sung to him. The Nightshade sung to him of how lonely and unloved he was. Of how much his physical and spiritual wounds ached, and how he could be comforted and made whole. To let go and lull would be such bliss…but it would be false. To continue the cycle into a singularity where all would be. He had a world to save, with people who loved him, relied upon him, told him to go physical therapy, to take and share pictures, to chew twenty times before— 

He swallowed.

“How was it?” Alapu watched as Grace’s pupils dilated and slowly constricted back to normal.

“Sweet,” Grace spat, wiping his mouth on his wrist. The taste remained on his tongue, but he could smell it in the air, wafting from Mei and from the mountain to the south. He spun around, instinctively turning to the source. “Made me feel weak and tried to comfort me for it.”

“So an emotional vector as well as a biological one,” Alapu murmured as she excitedly took notes. “It’ll take some time to synthesize these observations into a paper, but your physiology gives us an edge.”

Alapu stuffed her notes back into her satchel and hurried to the door, Grace more deftly keeping by her side. The woman’s eccentricity suggested that she knew and spoke for more than she let on. “I’m glad to whet your appetite; a greater feast awaits.”

**Scenario: Lakeside Village, Sapatibhatt — 11:25AM**

In the shadow of Rakinnagarh, far from its many lights, lay [the village](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1ebgq72/). As the city looked to rebuild, the village remained untouched by the tides of change. The issues besetting the city demanded resolution. The people of its districts spoke up and chanted to the skies, making themselves known. But the Lakeside Village had nobody who would speak for it. They had tried, none had listened. All they were offered were empty gestures. Such a shame, that all the fish had gone, that so many had to leave their homes behind…

The Lakeside Village had nobody who would speak for it. Not in the language of endless platitudes, broken promises, the skin of meaning with nothing underneath. This was not a language that the villagers cared to understand. Theirs was a deeper, older tongue, a curse upon the city, spurning its light.

Though, a fated few people could come to know the ways of monsters; those who had seen past civilization’s beautiful facade, and chose to free themselves of its false pleasures. 

People like Lucil Caravan. 

The monsters knew she would return. There was no escaping from the truth, and the truth was thus: no matter how tightly she clung onto the name Lucil, it would never fit her. Even now, with her nails and knuckles stained with [that stage-woman’s](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1giahrr/) blood. Because when she stood triumphant above the broken body of her *forgery,* as it whispered that it would no longer be ‘Lucil’, that the name was *hers,* Agatha still ran to hold the *fake* instead. 

She claimed that name. It should have been enough, and yet there was no band to harmonize with. No hands would hold her own. There was only a crawling feeling deep beneath the gauntlet, a discordance she could never fix. She was Lucil Caravan, a star, an icon, a hero, and *yet…* her victory was all but hollow. Just a name that no one called.

But as she walked through the streets, gauntlet rattling as she clenched her fist, the wind whispered of a different name, a piece of gossip spread through all those hungry shadows. 

**The Caravan is here again.**

It didn’t take long for her to find the Rakshasa. Through the streets, up the hill, beneath the lighthouse where the mushrooms clustered, she would find it there. The moment she caught a glimpse of those seaglass eyes, she whispered words that had been simmering beneath her skin for so long.

*“I’m back.”* She wouldn’t give them more than this. She couldn’t let them know how badly she wanted to reclaim the clarity that only her unseeing eyes could give. The revelation she had nearly grasped in her own claws.

***“So you are.”*** It was leaning against the lighthouse, its grimy hair drifting in the dusty breeze. It regarded Lucil with a sneer, before drawing forth its fishing pole, turning to cast its invisible line off the cliff and into the river below. There it remained, saying nothing, as if Lucil were invisible herself.

There was a long silence, before Lucil suddenly started forwards. *“That all?”*

***“If all you wish for is a greeting, that is hardly worth the interruption—my line has already been cast. You will simply have to wait until after it is bitten.”***

Lucil only noticed that she’d been gnawing on the inside of her cheek when the taste of copper filled her mouth.

“I-” she paused, glaring the beast down, before her shoulders slumped. “I’m here for a reason. You must know that.”

***”Should I know? I do not concern myself with the affects of humankind.”***

“Well—maybe I don’t *want* to be human anymore.” The confession echoed in the empty air. Even the river went still, as if to listen.

Finally, the Rakshasa turned, its blackened lips splitting into a jagged grin. ***“You say this as if you ever were.”***

Lucil’s fist rattled by her side, the coagulated sludge of steel and wire bubbling beneath. No matter how she hid the hand, she could still *feel it.* Yet she couldn’t bear to sever the limb as Steric had, to admit to her infection. To admit defeat. No, she would reclaim what the Rakshasa revealed in her—the power to reshape the truth itself.

“That doesn’t matter–what matters is that I’m here now-”

The Rakshasa, seeming to grow bored, turned back to the river.

“-and I can do something for you in return. I have intel, about the Nightblooms-”

It inclined its head slightly. ***“If you speak of the plague, I already know. It is not the first to seize the Nightblooms, nor will it be the last.”*** It paused before turning back to Lucil with a sharp shrug. **“It is Rakinnagarh’s problem. I have little hope for them, but if the yakshimi wishes to be a bridge between the Nightblooms and the world of man, then she can solve this one.”**

“Is that *really* what you want?” Lucil challenged, eyes gleaming in the glow of the lighthouse. “For that disease to run rampant? For it to mock your power by warping people into lumps of flesh? You want that lady to claim credit for its defeat, when she doesn’t even deserve it!?”

Lucil’s teeth were bared as she stepped forward until she was close enough to smell the brine on the Rakshasa’s skin. It should be her name. It should be *hers.*

“You’re the one who cared about this place, even when it was abandoned. There’s lots of people who aren’t human out there, puppets and viruses and all sorts of things. But w- but *they* only matter when they’re put on display. Gawkers will never understand… but you do. *I* understand.” The tremor in her voice kept time with the shaking of her fist. “So let me do this for you.”

The Rakshasa considered this a moment, before it laughed like the sea swallows a ship.

***“Very well, Caravan. Eviscerate the plague ‘til not a speck remains, and I shall let you return to the truth.”***

**Scenario: Mount Parapollah — 1:37PM**

To the untrained eye, Mount Parapollah might look no different in the rising of Winter, but Vasant Bulsara knew otherwise. That same greying hue had leached into the world around it, pooling in darkened spots where the earth became soft. Vasant quickly learned not to step on them lest it tear the earth like wet bandages skin over an infected wound.

Vasant had seen this infection’s face, seeping from that woman as pus weeps from an open sore. An undying necrosis, melting the soul into cadaverine which, bleeding into the body, destroys its composition. Eternal suffering with no hope of escape. He had seen the hell that ｢Anthrax｣ wished to create. [Vasant thought an exorcism might have been enough](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1ehvw8r/), but it was not. Instead, even as Mount Parapollah stood firm, he could feel the rot eating at the Nightblooms’ roots.

He still had faith in their potential as a means of enlightenment; the trial of the [Soul Train](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1fpj5v7/) had convinced him of that. These flowers, knowing of the land and spirit, able to cultivate the essence of other beings, could be friends in the search for a better world. Yet, recent stories had told him that those who saw a certain black flower would experience a different sort of trial. A lightless, pulsing place, as if buried in soft, mouldering soil where bodies contorted and tarnished within crevices and cracks. 

There was hope hidden beneath the hush of their voice. Many said they had gone so long without touch; at last, the earth would hold them close.

With a breath, Vasant let these thoughts pass, returning to the present. There, his eyes settled on something new—a figure crouched in the distance, cradling something. As he approached, the blossoms on their skin shifted into focus—Muuru had spoken of this woman, a local legend, a human and a Nightbloom intertwined. The amicable forest spirit, Darling.

He stepped forwards, pleased to see a guide who could help—before he stopped in place. As she noticed him, she turned sharply, her petalled ears pinned back, her tail lashing. Her clawed hands shook around a Nightbloom, half-rotten, choked by weeds. The rage in her eyes swirled as heavy as the perfume of her orchids.

*“Who are you and what are you doing here?”* A tone so terse she practically snarled.

“My name is Vasant Bulsara, I am a wanderer, and I hope that I am following the path to an enlightened world.”

She bared her fangs in a chuckle, sounding as though it was wrung from her body.
“If you wish to walk into the wilds and *learn* from the Nightblooms, to seek the wisdom of Kokomo, then you have chosen an *awful* time.”

“I’ve heard the Nightblooms have fallen prey to a sickness. I am here to offer my help-”


“Ah, *now* there is finally help for us, only now, only when we in our pain and our sickness bring harm to your city.” Her wings twitched across her back, shedding orchid feathers. “How long it has taken for anyone to offer help—I have aided you while watching as you pluck our loved ones from the ground, dissect them, pull all you can from their bodies, devour them, over, and over, and over again.”

By this time she was shaking, flute held white-knuckled in her hand. “I did this because your city was a fragile thing, breaking the chains that bound it, becoming new. I did this because I was human once, and felt the chains, and wished them broken. If the land and all its rage flooded your city, it could destroy your chance, and so finally I aided you. Oh, the Nightblooms mourned for their companions, oh, how Kokomo shook, weeping sap and oil for the blossoms that had grown so long across its skin. But I calmed them down, I told them that it would be alright, that humans were not so bad, that they should not hate you.”

She was upon him now, eyes wild, clutching at his shoulder. 

“I, who was supposed to speak for them, in words you cared to understand, told them to swallow up their anger, for *you.* Now it has festered in them, you cannot know the agony they feel, so few of you have ever *tried!”*

A voice rang out, ""Did you…just feel despair?”

Darling whirled around, nose up and claws out for the source of the taunt. She rocked back on her haunches to dive at the old woman who swatted at the underbrush, but relaxed when she saw Grace follow shortly behind her. Alapu’s expression was as placid as ever, “You haven’t aged a day since we first met, Darling, but did I hear you wrong? I can’t hear you too well, let me see your face.”

“And you have joined *them* since we last parted,” Darling hissed. Grace was young, grappling with a world which he barely understood and which barely understood him in turn, but Alapu should have known better than to join Speedwagon. “Do you too come to pluck the Nightblooms in the name of your masters?”

“Do you let any of your conversation partners get a word in edgewise?” Alapu groaned, motioning towards Vasant. “This young man has been listening patiently; is he your pupil or your punching bag?”

Darling bared her fangs but remained silent.

“Having found Agent Papatika, the Foundation has been investigating the various organizations that have ‘researched’ the Nightblooms, now focusing its paranormal and medical expertise to contain the spreading ‘Nightbloom’ infection."" At this, Vasant realized the gravity of the current situation. “With most of our agents focusing on treating victims, Pāpaka is more uniquely suited to targeting the infection at its source. I’ll order the Foundation to cease all further research at the end of this operation.”

“I’m glad some giants have the grace not to trample upon us once they have learned all they can.”

“I do try to watch my step.”

“May I speak?” Vasant asked, regarding them all with a steady gaze. Darling glared at him, hunting for that glint of smug satisfaction on his face. She didn’t find it. With a slump of her shoulders, she motioned for him to go on. 

“I understand-” He paused at Darling’s bristling. “I understand that my knowledge has its limits, at least right now. I believe in the connection between humans and Nightblooms.” Each word was more considered than ever. This could not be a conversation between gurus. Right now, this was her moment of grief. He thought to [the lanterns glowing over the rice fields](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1glee9c/) and was still.

“But I haven’t walked their path. I cannot hope to seek their aid in reaching enlightenment without aiding them in their own.” He straightened himself, unwavering. “I recall seeing a vision of the first Nightbloom in this region, after the eruption. They have spent a long time cultivating others. But just as they’re part of the city, the city is a part of them. I am here to offer my help, to cultivate them in turn, so that we might walk the path together.”

At this, Darling finally relaxed, her tail going still. “I… was the one who helped you see that history. I knew then that your heart was good, and still it is…you do not deserve my ire, I’m sorry.”

“And me? Do I get an apology, my Darling?” Alapu smirked.

“You should be fortunate if you don’t get bitten,” she glowered back, though some mirth had returned to her tone. She continued, gesturing over at Grace, “So why bring a child to do such dangerous work?”

“Because, with supervision, he is the one capable of doing it. A more conservative approach would let the Nightshades spread throughout Nightblooms and Rakin alike; the Parapollah Conservation Team already is reporting missing persons, and unofficial investigations have reported higher numbers. The sooner we understand their target and their source, the quicker we can excise it.”

Before his ego could swell too much, Alapu placed a hand on Grace’s shoulder, grounding him and encouraging him to speak. “Prey on the lonely. Make you feel unloved, but offer their…*support.* If you accept them.”

“And the events of the past months have provided fertile ground,” Darling put her head in her hands, gritting her teeth. “Many forces have worked hard to sever your bonds to your land and your fellows. Without roots, the earth is easier to erode. A single strand, untethered, is far easier to snap. We work against infection that runs deep. The four of us, even with Speedwagon’s help, wouldn’t be enough to tear out these weeds.”

Vasant looked upwards, to the clearing peeking through the forestline, before continuing onward. Through all this talk of monsters and men, Darling had wanted someone to listen, so he would. Only once they had surveyed the infection’s damage could they decide what to do.

With a breath, he nodded at the hijra, and then looked towards the future. “Let us focus not on the result, but on the work itself.”

---

The center of the crater pulsed as though it were metastasizing. The earth was slick with cadaverine, bleeding from the blossoms that squirmed through its surface. Each one spasmed with torment and ecstasy, promising transcendent intimacy, everything dissolving into one.

Yet, in the center of it all, a woman stood half-hunched, snarling as she dug her hands into the sludge and tore the blooms away. They shrieked inside her bones, promising absolution for her abandoned soul. But she would not listen. For she loved Lucil Caravan, she idolized all that she was and could be. She was Lucil, she *was,* and so she loved *herself.*

Grace stepped forwards first, lingering at the crater’s edge, just watching her. It wasn’t far from here, the site of [his own trial](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/18zn44h/); fighting on a mountain in miniature, an offspring of Parapollah. He could not acknowledge that he was just a child, fighting children. He thought it the burden of the future, a trial that only he could beat. If he destroyed enough evil, he would claim a safe and certain future–for him, and for his friends. He would not have to face the world where people boiled in the Brahmaputra.

But where had it gotten him? Grace knew now that he was still a child, and yet, the fight continued. Yet, he also knew that the future was less burdensome alone.

“She needs help,” he muttered. Darling stood close to him, letting him breathe in the calming scent of orchids, though her muscles were still tensed with agitation. There was another scent beneath the perfume, clinging to the woman in the crater.

“The brine…she smells of Robyn—the Rakshasa of the Lakeside Village. She still seems human, but beware- the maneater twists the human form in other ways.”

Still, Vasant wheeled his bike down to meet her. “Lucil Caravan, correct? You’ll never uproot the Nightshades on your own. Hold on, we’re here to h-”

“I don’t *need* it,” she snapped back, stained from nail to elbow. Her wary gaze flicked across the crowd: a child, an old woman, and- Lucil’s shoulders tensed, lip pulled into a sneer. Steric would have said that Darling saved them both. Of course *he* would see it that way. 

Then there was that *biker.* She had heard of him–part of that clubhouse whose members hounded her wherever she turned. With a sharp wave, she plunged her arm back into the ground. “I’m ***fine on my own.”***

“That is where you’re wrong, dear.” 

Suddenly, the pungent smell of fruit and flower filled the air as waves of power blossomed from Alapu, stronger than what her body should be able to contain. Strange plants forced their way through the black and rotting mire throughout the crater as Alapu sighed. “Growth by competition, sharpening and honing the self and the other in synthesis. That is my ｢Fame Monster｣, gifted to me by the Nightblooms decades ago.”

“Finally your Stand gives back to the cycle that birthed it,” Darling snidely commented, before a seed coalesced in her hands that soon unfurled into a reptilian creature the size of a human infant. The stamen-like antenna on its head wafted as it opened its eyes for the first time, cooing  and clinging to its newly imprinted mother.

“One of my colleagues would have thoughts about calling it a Stand, but I digress,” Alapu chuffed, gently rocking another baby; it had fallen asleep in her arms. “Our spirits grow by overcoming challenges, our spirits spread by blossoming within another. But the world can be cruel; threads woven today may be torn tomorrow. So you must teach the future how to hold them tight, and damn the darkness for daring to try. I trust you two to figure it out as you go.”

Vasant nodded, though his gaze was on the baby in his arms. To have a family was to settle; nourishment requires planting roots. It would never be the life for him, and yet, as the kaiju’s little arms flailed to grab his jacket, he did not hesitate to let it rest against the denim.

Lucil could only grimace at the alien thing blinking back at her with big, bright eyes. She tensed under its gaze, feeling the weight of its infantile expectations. The creature needed someone to care for it, and surely, no one else would. It was too strange to be loved for what it was—and even as she held the baby at arms’ length, something about that spoke to her.

“A child wasn’t enough, so you enlisted two strangers to feed your Stand, as if you alone could cure this infection.” Darling held the baby kaiju against her shoulder, petting it lest it nibble on her hair. “I see Speedwagon has taught you well.”

“As I said, Grace could lead us to and diagnose the source, but none of us could raise ｢Fame Monster｣ alone. Running into Ms. Lucil was a fortunate, precipitating element. As Mr. Vasant said, we cannot focus on the result, but only have faith in the work.” Alapu admitted before she bowed her head in prayer. “May their clash cultivate them and their children so that a miracle may occur.”

She turned to Darling, and for once, Alapu truly seemed her age, burdened by the decades that had given her her wisdom. “Do you truly think I approve of or am even consulted on the Foundation’s every act? I am an old Assamese woman who walks the same halls as British and American men believing themselves to be James Bond. My love makes me a monster within those walls just as my institution makes me a monster beyond them. Yet, if we wish to teach our children how to walk, we must stumble forward wherever and however best we can. The old world is dying, and the new struggles to be born.

“Now is the time of monsters, midwives, and mothers.

**“Open the game.”**

**Location:** A clearing and surrounding cliffs near the summit of Mount Parapollah. The clearing has a 60m diameter, with passages through the cliffs. [The map](https://imgur.com/a/4BgRtnh) has a scale of each square being 3x3m (total area of 120x120m, or 40x40 squares). More on this later, but the passages between the cliffs are only large enough for Kaiju up to Adolescent size; Adult Kaiju can only comfortably exist in the central clearing.

The ground is overall barren and rocky, but due to the effects of Alapu’s Stand, several Plants are growing in the area, represented by the red, green, and blue circles. Plants are valid teleport points for Lucil. 

**Goal:** RETIRE your opponents’ Kaiju! (Due to damage transference, this will RETIRE your opponent as well.)

**Additional Information:** Upon activation of Alapu’s Stand, ｢Fame Monster｣, the stage is filled with a variety of odd plants, predominantly fruits and flowers, in three colors; red, blue, and green. Plants will regrow if eaten or destroyed after 20 seconds. Each Stand user in the area has been granted a Baby Kaiju, but Alapu and all other Stand users are irrelevant for the sake of the match.

The Kaiju has five life form stages, beginning at the size of a human infant (Baby), growing to the size of a large humanoid Stand (Child), then to one story tall (Adolescent), then three stories (Adult), then five stories (Ascendant). At each stage, its Power scales from E to A, though its Speed starts at E and caps at C at the Adolescent stage. Its Durability is flatly capped at A. However, they are barely controllable, with E PRE and only listening to orders until reaching the Ascendant stage, at which case they will seek out the other Kaiju in the area and attempt to fight them.

While Baby is more effectively carried than allowed to waddle around, once a Kaiju becomes a Child, it gains access to its Breath attack, a cone of fire that begins at 2m long. It’s 5m long once it reaches the Adolescent stage, 10m long when Adult, and 20m long once Ascendant.

A Baby can eat any 5 pieces of Stand material to grow the Child stage (a Lotus and a Plant are each one piece), afterwards it must only eat Plants, going on an evolutionary path. Depending on which path is chosen, it can only consume plants of that color and gains abilities from that path. Each stage requires eating 10 Plants of that color.

Color|Adolescent|Adult
:--|:--|:--
Red|Breath does additional damage over time|The Kaiju leaves behind a “radioactive trail” so that anything in its wake takes damage over time.
Blue|Breath does bonus damage to structures and constructs.|The Kaiju can turn matter into “unusable slag” on breath or contact which cannot be used or affected by Stands.
Green|Breath can cover what it hits with X Durability moss, where X is current Power.|The Kaiju and its parent gradually heal over time.

Once a Kaiju reaches the Adult stage, it can eat 10 Plants of the other two colors each to reach the Ascendant stage. Doing so gives it the abilities of the other two evolutionary paths it didn’t take.

Incidentally, Alapu has never created an Ascendant Kaiju before.

Lucil has a bag full of ginger hard candies with her, and Vasant has a first aid kit, both items from Alapu’s inventory.

Vasant cannot grow Lotuses from Kaiju or Plants.

1hdr823,https://i.redd.it/5ql2pgbnqp6e1.jpeg,First nosedive report! ,"The day finally came as I knew it would! I would say this one was on me. Took off for a ride to the local coffee shop, coming back is uphill and I had maybe 40-45% battery left. Riding like normal, 15-18mph, not really sure if there was pushback, the sidewalk was bumpy and I had headphones in. It’s funny, I had installed fangs this morning to help with the eventuality.

I’m pretty pleased with how the crash went all considered. I’ve had lots of previous injuries with skateboards, mtn bikes, dirt bikes etc so I knew the importance of “rolling” out and wearing gear. Enduro helmet, hillbilly wrist guards and Sisu mouth guard every time. I visualize rolling upon a nosedive at the start of every ride to internalize the action. I’ve got about 200 miles in between the boards. I was on the Pint X today. 

If the fangs helped I couldn’t say as it happened pretty fast but I managed to get one step planted with my right foot before rolling, I definitely used the wrist guard on my leading hand. It wasn’t a perfect roll but I’ll take it! A little road rash on knees and one elbow but nothing broken or torn besides my pants. 

My lesson: Have boards fully charged before riding and take it easy when the battery is lower (duh).

1hdr7o6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1hdr7o6/22f_and_can_never_drink_again/,22f and can never drink again ,"since moving in with my grandma, i’ve struggled to control my drinking. she always has a huge bottle of vodka and encourages me to drink. she’s also always drunk and gets very nasty/emotional, so drinking made living with her more bearable. i’ve gotten to the point where i’ll get drunk off of vodka 5-7 times a week. 

two nights ago i got a bad ache in my stomach. i’d downed 20oz of coffee with no food so i figured that was it. it got worse and worse until i couldn’t sleep it hurt so bad. i threw up at least 5 times from 12am-8am. i told my aunt and that’s when she drove me to the hospital. 

after running some tests, i was informed that i have pancreatitis. i threw up a good 7 more times while being at the hospital and i cant eat solid foods. its the worst pain i’ve ever felt in my life. my doctor confirmed that i shouldn’t drink again. i feel shocked and ashamed to be so young and have this happen to me. i wish i could’ve saved drinking for nights out with my friends, but clearly moderation does not exist in my world. 

now i have to focus on what i should’ve been doing in the first place: no drinking, eating healthy, exercising, and going to therapy. i wanted to but drinking was a replacement for it all. for that, i’m almost thankful this happened to me. i never want to feel this way again.

A little about me: I’m in nursing school and a huge fan of coffee, matcha, desserts, sushi, pasta, and shabu shabu. I have 2 dogs and 3 cats, and I’m into all kinds of media—movies, shows, books, music, and games. As much as I hate to admit it, I’m lowkey a cinephile. I love genres like fantasy, romance, crime, thriller, mystery, and sci-fi. 

Outside of that, my hobbies include going to the gym, journaling, exploring new cafes and bookstores, collecting cute trinkets/tote bags, PC gaming, and makeup.

I’m hoping to meet platonic friends around the age of 24-45 (anywhere close to my age is fine, just no minors). 

I’d love to talk about life, dreams, fears, and other deep/intellectual topics. I also enjoy back and forth banter. It would be great to chat about shared interests, but I’m also open to learning about yours! While I’d love consistent conversations, I’m also pretty busy with school, so I might not always reply quickly if that’s ok!

Please, no creeps or anything sexual :( I’ll just ignore it. If you’re interested, DM me and introduce yourself! 🫶🏼",1,1734137834.0,Needafriend,2,1.0,False
