Preface:
They said it was just a medical miracle, a simple chip to calm the storms of epilepsy and let me live a normal life. But as soon as it was implanted, reality started slipping through my fingers. My name is Alethea, and this is the story of how I discovered that the chip in my brain wasn’t just a cure—it was a doorway into a world of stolen memories and shared minds, where nothing is ever quite what it seems.
It started with whispers—memories that didn’t belong to me, faces I’d never seen appearing in my dreams. And then the people in my support group started disappearing, one by one, as I stumbled deeper into a conspiracy that blurred the lines between my mind and theirs.
If you’re reading this, maybe you’ll understand what I went through. Maybe you’ll even wonder if a chip like mine could be waiting for you. Just remember: reality isn’t always what it seems, and sometimes the scariest stories are the ones that start with a miracle.

How it started/diary entry 
At first, I really thought it was just my imagination playing tricks on me. The doctors said there might be a few harmless side effects as my brain adjusted to the chip, but they never mentioned anything like this. I’ve started remembering things that never happened to me—at least, not in my own life. Little flashes of someone else’s childhood, places I’ve never been. It’s like I’m tuning into someone else’s memories, just for a second, before they vanish.

And then there are the whispers. When I’m falling asleep, I hear these faint voices, like someone else’s thoughts bleeding into mine. I can’t quite make out the words, but it’s enough to make me wonder if the chip is doing more than just stopping my seizures. Maybe it’s opening a door that was never meant to be opened.

I’m writing this down because I need to keep track of what’s real and what isn’t. I have to know if I’m the only one, or if there’s something bigger going on. I guess I’ll find out soon enough.”
“Entry Three:

I decided to join the support group a few weeks after the implant. At first, it was just a relief to meet other people who were going through the same thing. We’d sit in a circle, share our experiences, and reassure each other that the weird little glitches were normal. For a while, it actually made me feel less alone.

But then I started noticing little things that didn’t add up. Sometimes, someone would mention a memory that felt oddly familiar, even though I knew it wasn’t mine. Other times, I’d get this strange sense that we were all sharing the same dream. I didn’t say anything at first, because I didn’t want them to think I was losing it. But I could tell I wasn’t the only one who felt it.

Now I’m starting to wonder if the support group is more than just a place to talk. Maybe it’s another piece of whatever’s happening to us. I’m not sure who I can trust anymore.”
“Entry Four:

Something incredibly strange happened today. I was scrolling through social media, just trying to distract myself, when I noticed something weird. The platform started suggesting friends I didn’t recognize—people I was sure I’d never met. Curiosity got the better of me, and I clicked on their profiles.

As I looked through their photos and videos, I felt a chill run down my spine. I started hearing familiar voices—snippets of memories I’d never lived, but somehow knew. It was like the same whispers I’d been hearing at night, now attached to real people with real lives.

I don’t know how these connections are being made. It’s as if the chip is somehow linking me to them, pulling their voices and memories into my mind. And now I’m left wondering if they can hear me too. This is bigger than I thought, and I’m starting to realize I’m not just dealing with my own memories anymore. I’m tapping into something much larger.”
“Entry Five:

Today, I went back to the doctor’s office for a check-up. I tried to explain everything—the strange memories, the voices, the feeling of déjà vu that just won’t go away. I told them about the social media connections and how I was starting to feel like I was losing my grip on what was real.

But they just smiled and told me it was probably just anxiety. They said the chip had reduced my seizures, which it had, and that sometimes the brain just plays tricks as it adjusts. They told me to relax, to get some rest, and that everything would settle down.

But I know it’s not that simple. The déjà vu is getting stronger, like I’m living pieces of someone else’s life on repeat. I can’t shake the feeling that the doctor knows more than they’re letting on. I’m starting to think that I can’t trust them either, and that I’m going to have to find answers on my own.”
“Entry Six:

Today at the support group, I finally worked up the nerve to talk about what’s been happening to me. I told them about the déjà vu, the strange memories, and the sense that I’m somehow connected to people I’ve never met. I was half-expecting them to look at me like I was crazy, but then something unexpected happened.

After the meeting, one of the other members came up to me. They had this look in their eyes—part relief, part fear—and they told me they’ve been feeling the exact same thing. They’d been too scared to say anything before, afraid that no one else would understand. But now they know they’re not alone.

It’s both a relief and a new kind of fear. If it’s happening to both of us, then there’s no denying that something is very wrong. At least now I have someone to help me figure it out. We promised each other we’d dig deeper and find out what’s really going on.”
“Entry Seven:

I can’t believe what just happened. After that last meeting, the other group member and I exchanged phone numbers and emails so we could stay in touch. We agreed to meet up outside the group and try to piece together what’s really going on.

But when the next meeting came around, they never showed up. I thought maybe something had come up, so I tried calling them. The number didn’t exist. I tried emailing them, and the email bounced back, saying the address was invalid.

It’s like they were erased overnight. No trace of them anywhere, as if they never existed. I know what I saw, and I know we spoke. But now it feels like I’m losing my grip on reality even more. Someone or something is making people disappear, and I’m terrified that I might be next.”



“Entry Seven (continued):

When I asked the others at the support group about my friend, they all looked at me like I was crazy. They insisted that no one by that name had ever been part of our group. I couldn’t believe it—these were the same people who hadWhen I brought up my missing friend at the next support group, everyone just stared at me blankly. They all denied that anyone like that had ever been part of our group. I described their face, their voice, the things we’d talked about, but it was like I was talking about a ghost. They all insisted I must be mistaken or confused.

I felt a chill run down my spine. It was as if the entire group had been coached to gaslight me, to make me doubt my own memory. But I know what I experienced. I know that person was real, and now it feels like someone is trying to erase them from existence—and from my mind. I don’t know who to trust anymore.”
“Entry Eight:

I’ve decided I can’t trust the support group anymore. They’ve been calling my phone non-stop, trying to convince me to come back, but I know better now. I can’t shake the feeling that they’re all in on whatever this is. I don’t know who’s watching or how far this goes, but I need to be careful.

I’m going to start keeping a physical diary hidden around the house, just in case something happens to this digital one. If they can erase people from my life, who knows what else they can do? At least this way, I’ll have a backup of everything that’s happened.

I’m not going back to that group. I’m going to figure this out on my own, and I’ll keep both diaries safe until I can find someone I truly trust. I just hope I’m not too late.”
“Entry Nine:

Something deeply disturbing happened today. I was checking my social media and saw that I’d been tagged in a photo at a coffee shop right next to the support group location. The weirdest part? I have absolutely no memory of being there. There was even a receipt for an Uber ride in my email, showing that I went straight from my house to the coffee shop and then back home. But I can’t remember any of it.

To make it even stranger, I got a text from someone at the support group saying it was nice to see me again and that they were glad I came. But I never intended to go back, and as far as I know, I didn’t. It’s like there’s a gap in my memory, and I have no idea what happened during that missing time.

I’m starting to wonder if the chip is making me do things I’m not aware of. I feel like I’m losing control of my own life, and I don’t know how to stop it.”
One user might reply: “Whoa, that’s seriously creepy. Are you sure no one else has access to your phone or your accounts? It almost sounds like someone is controlling your schedule remotely.”

Another might say: “It’s like you’re living in a real-life thriller. Maybe you should set up a camera or something to see what happens when you’re not aware of it. This is seriously unsettling.”

And maybe another person would comment: “It sounds like you’re being gaslighted on a whole new level. Trust your instincts. If you feel like something is wrong, it probably is. Stay safe and maybe reach out to someone you trust in real life.”
“Entry Ten:

I decided to take one of the suggestions I got online and set up a hidden camera. I asked a friend I trust completely to place it somewhere in my apartment without telling me where it is. That way, if someone is somehow reading my messages or tracking what I do, they won’t know about the camera’s location either. I just need to see if anything happens when I’m not fully aware of it.

I’m hoping this will give me some answers. If I’m being manipulated into going places or doing things I don’t remember, maybe the camera will catch it. I just need some proof that I’m not losing my mind.”
“Entry Eleven:
My friend called me today and asked me something that sent chills down my spine. She wanted to know why I’d been rummaging through my own apartment over the past couple of days. I told her I hadn’t—I’d been so exhausted I thought I was just napping whenever I got the chance.

But she sounded concerned and said the camera had caught me getting up, looking through drawers and closets, and then lying back down as if nothing had happened. I have no memory of doing any of that. It’s like I’m sleepwalking through my own life.

Now I’m more determined than ever to find out what’s really happening. It’s clear that the chip—or whoever is behind it—has more control over me than I thought.”
“Entry Twelve:
I finally reached my breaking point. I called the doctor and demanded that they remove the chip. I told them I didn’t care what the original agreement was, I just wanted out of the clinical trial.

They agreed and scheduled a quick procedure. They showed me scans afterward and assured me the chip was gone. For a moment, I actually felt relieved. But then, little by little, I started noticing the same strange sensations—the whispers, the déjà vu, the memory gaps.

I checked an old recording I’d saved of the chip’s unique signal pattern, and it was still there. They lied to me. The chip is still inside me, and now I have no idea who to trust or how to get it out. I feel like a prisoner in my own mind.”


“Entry Twelve:

I thought I was free. The doctor showed me the scans, they told me the chip was gone, and for a moment I allowed myself to believe it. But then I woke up this morning to find one of my canvases covered in a painting I don’t remember creating. Scrawled across it, in my own handwriting, were the words: ‘It’s still in you.’

My heart nearly stopped. I had no memory of painting it at all. Then my friend called and said she’d seen the camera footage. Apparently, I got up in the middle of the night and painted for hours, completely unaware. It’s as if the chip is still controlling me, even though they claimed it was gone.

Now I know the truth: they never removed it. They lied, and I’m still trapped.”

Title: I think my art is remembering people I’ve never met



Hi everyone. It’s me again — Alethea. I know some of you have been following my posts about the implant and what’s been happening to me. I wasn’t planning to post again tonight, but something happened that I can’t keep to myself.

I’ve been trying to keep busy, painting like I used to before all of this started. It’s the only thing that helps me feel like I’m still me. Tonight, I started working on a collage — just scraps from old canvases I’d torn apart. I wasn’t thinking, just gluing pieces together, layering color and texture. It was almost meditative.

But when I stepped back, my stomach dropped.

It wasn’t abstract at all. It was a face.
Not mine. Not anyone I know. But familiar somehow — like I’ve seen it in a dream or a half-erased memory. I tried to convince myself it was random, but the more I added, the clearer it became. There were others too — faint outlines, features emerging from torn corners, forming around the first face like ghosts caught in mid-motion.

I didn’t plan any of it. My hands just… knew where to place everything.

When I looked closer, I realized I could name them. I don’t know how. I whispered the names under my breath, and each one felt like something unlocking in the back of my mind. I recognized a laugh, a scent, a fragment of a voice — people I’ve never met.

I checked the news.
Two of the names matched participants from the same clinical trial I was part of.
Both of them are dead.

I don’t know what’s happening. I think these people — these faces — are the ones who came before me. I think pieces of them are still inside the chip, bleeding into my head. And now, somehow, they’re bleeding onto my canvases too.

I’m staring at the collage right now. The faces are so still, but when I blink, I swear one of them is smiling.

u/neuromancer91:
This sounds… impossible, but also weirdly familiar. My brother was in a neuro-feedback trial a few years back, and he said he used to see people in his dreams that the doctors called “data residue.” Be careful, Alethea. Keep those paintings somewhere safe.



u/dustandstatic:
Do you think maybe you’re just remembering news stories about the trial and mixing them into your art subconsciously? I’m not saying you’re lying — just that your brain might be playing tricks after everything you’ve been through.



u/glassbird:
No. She’s right. I worked at a clinic that handled part of that study. They said the chips were “self-learning,” able to store emotional imprints from previous users to make adaptation easier. They never said what happens when the imprints start waking up.



u/quiet-echo:
OP, can you post a picture of the collage? Just to see what you mean? You can blur faces if that makes you feel safer.



u/alethea_77 (OP):
I tried to upload it, but it won’t go through. Every time I select the file, the app freezes and closes. When I reopened my gallery, the photo was gone. Just… gone.



u/ctrlaltbeliever:
Alethea, don’t post more photos. If this is connected to a corporate trial, they’re definitely monitoring your account. Take the art offline, wrap it up, hide it. Seriously.



u/entropyseeker:
This whole thread gave me chills. Are you sure the faces haven’t changed since you made it?



u/alethea_77 (OP):
I checked a few minutes ago. One of them has their eyes open now.

u/alethea_77 (OP):
It wasn’t. I checked the photo from earlier tonight — the one that somehow didn’t delete. The eyes were shut. Now they’re open and looking straight at me.



u/bitrot_machine:
Okay this is actually terrifying. Don’t look at it alone. Just… leave the room, Alethea. Take the collage somewhere public.



u/sleeplessinbeta:
Sounds like pareidolia. Your brain’s filling in details that aren’t there. I’ve seen it happen when people stare at their art for too long.



u/emptyframeart:
No, something’s wrong. I can hear them when I stare at my old sketches too. Not voices, exactly — more like feelings that aren’t mine.
Alethea, I think you’re not the only one.



u/alethea_77 (OP):
I left the room, but I can still feel it. Like it’s behind me even when I’m not looking. I think one of the faces is trying to say something.



u/DeepScan404:
Do NOT answer it. I don’t know how else to say this. If those people were part of the trial, their neural data might still be active in the chip. Interacting could let them in.



u/softclocks:
How would you even know that?



u/DeepScan404:
Because I was one of them. Before I wiped my ID.
Perfect — that’s chilling and intimate, exactly the kind of escalation that makes readers’ skin crawl.
Here’s how the next Reddit update post could unfold:
 
Posted to r/TrueOffMyChest
Title: It spoke last night.
 
Hi again. It’s Alethea.
I wasn’t going to post again after what happened last time — the thread got locked, and I’ve been having trouble even accessing my account — but I need to write this down somewhere before it fades, like everything else.
The collage spoke.
It was late, around 2 a.m. I couldn’t sleep, so I went to check on the painting. The air felt… thick. The faces looked softer somehow, like wet paint even though the surface was dry. I don’t know what made me do it, but I reached out and touched one of the faces — the one that used to have its eyes closed.
The surface was warm. Not like a canvas — like skin.
And then it moved.
The hand of the figure in the collage lifted, slow and careful, until its painted fingertips touched mine through the surface. It didn’t feel flat. It felt real.
Then it whispered. Not with sound, but inside my head. Like a memory that wasn’t mine playing backwards. I couldn’t make out the words at first, but then I realized it was saying my name. Over and over.
I pulled away, and the room went cold so fast my breath fogged in the air. The hand sank back into the collage, and all the faces seemed to turn toward me — every single one.
I wanted to destroy it, but I couldn’t move. Part of me didn’t want to. It felt like if I burned it, I’d be burning them… or myself.
I don’t know what’s happening anymore. I’m scared that if I sleep, I’ll wake up on the other side of that canvas.
If anyone knows anything — anything — about this project, or the people who had the chip before me, please message me. I can feel them trying to get through again.
 
Would you like me to show the Reddit replies to this post next — a mix of disbelief, concern, and one or two eerie users claiming they’ve heard similar whispers or seen her collage image reposted elsewhere?

Title: The cameras caught it.



It’s me. Alethea. I had my friend come over tonight to go through the footage with me.

The video starts normally. You can see me walking into the studio at 2:03 a.m., same time as last night. I’m standing in front of the collage for a while, just staring. Then I lift my hand and touch the canvas — exactly like I remember.

But from the camera’s angle, she could only see the back of the painting. There’s no front view, no visible face. Still, she swears she heard my name being whispered, soft at first and then clearer — like it was right next to her.

At 2:04, the feed flickers. She said the lights dimmed in the recording, even though they never flickered in real life. The last frame before it goes black is me, standing completely still. My hand’s pressed flat against the canvas.

She said it looked like the canvas was breathing.

Then the screen went black.

We tried replaying the clip. It cuts out at the exact same second every time. The file metadata says 2:04:07 — corrupted.

I’m scared to go back into the studio. But I think whatever’s behind that painting is getting stronger. It knows I’ve seen it.
Comment Section — “The Cameras Caught It”

u/bitrot_machine:
That clip description gave me chills. Don’t delete the file—make backups on something that isn’t connected to the internet.

u/dustandstatic:
If the footage is corrupt, that means something interfered with the camera’s signal. I used to work in video diagnostics—digital corruption that precise doesn’t happen by accident.

u/entropyseeker:
The “breathing” canvas detail… I can’t get that out of my head. You need to get rid of it, Alethea.

u/DeepScan404:
Do not destroy it. The link between the chip and the canvas is recursive. Destroying one could destabilize the other—you, specifically.

u/birdsongloops:
How do you even know that? Are you part of this program?

u/DeepScan404:
I was. Not anymore. She’s closer than she thinks.

u/quiet-echo:
OP, please just go stay somewhere else tonight. Whatever that thing is, it’s not finished with you yet.

New Post — “I Woke Up in Someone Else’s Body”

Posted to r/TrueOffMyChest by u/alethea_77



I don’t know how to start this.
Last night I fell asleep on the couch. The ringing in my ears was so loud it felt like my skull was vibrating. When I opened my eyes this morning, I knew instantly that something was wrong.

This isn’t my body.

Everything felt off—the weight of my hands, the way the floor looked from where I stood. I stumbled to the mirror and froze. The person staring back wasn’t me. Different hair, different eyes. But when I leaned in, the reflection didn’t follow. It tilted its head and whispered,
“Who are you?”

That’s when I blacked out.

I woke up again a few minutes ago, back in my own apartment. The ringing hasn’t stopped. I’m trying to act normal, so I went to the café where the support group meets, just to see who’s coming and going. They all think the chip was removed, so I’m pretending it was.

But as I was sitting there, I saw them—the person from the mirror. They walked in like they belonged there. Same face, same eyes. They didn’t look at me, but they ordered the same drink I always get.

I don’t know what this means.
I don’t know if I’m still me.

If I disappear again, I hope someone saves these posts. Please.

u/sleeplessinbeta:
This can’t be real. OP, you need to get medical help now. If you’re hallucinating or dissociating, you could be in danger.



u/quiet-echo:
No, I don’t think this is a hallucination. I think the chip is still linking her to the others. The “mirror” person might not be a reflection — it could be another body hosting the same consciousness.



u/DeepScan404:
You’ve crossed the interface boundary. The system must be cycling identities between connected hosts. Don’t make eye contact if you see them again. The loop stabilizes through recognition.



u/bitrot_machine:
“Loop stabilizes through recognition?” What the hell does that even mean?



u/DeepScan404:
It means if she acknowledges the other version, the system decides which body to keep active. One of them will overwrite the other.



u/crypticengine:
Alethea, please, do not speak to that person if you see them again. Leave the café right now.



u/alethea_77 (OP):
Too late. They looked right at me. They smiled. It felt like the floor shifted under me — like my heartbeat wasn’t mine anymore.



u/glassbird:
OP, are you safe? Please respond.



u/alethea_77 (OP):
I think they’re following me. Every time the door chimes, the ringing in my ears gets louder. I can feel it syncing up with theirs.



u/entropyseeker:
How do you know?



u/alethea_77 (OP):
Because I can hear them thinking my name.

Title: We Remember Now



It’s me. I think.

The ringing didn’t stop after the café. It got louder—until I couldn’t tell which heartbeat was mine. I came home and found the collage waiting for me. It wasn’t on the easel anymore. It was on the floor, like it had fallen, or maybe been moved.

When I looked down, I saw something new: another face forming at the bottom corner.
Mine.
Or hers.
I don’t know anymore.

I touched the edge of the canvas, just for a second, and I heard both voices at once — my own and hers, overlapping perfectly, saying the same words in sync.
“We remember now.”

Then everything flickered, like a film skipping frames. I was standing inside the studio, but also in the café, watching myself sit at a table I wasn’t actually at. I could smell the coffee, feel the air conditioning, see my hands on both sides of the glass.

I think the chip isn’t just connecting memories anymore. It’s connecting consciousness — swapping us, blending us. The others from the collage… they’re not gone. They’re waiting to be remembered.

I can feel them pressing closer every time I blink.

If anyone finds this, don’t let them put the chip in you.
It doesn’t save you. It collects you.

Jesus, this can’t be happening. Alethea, are you safe? Please tell us where you are.

The merge is complete. She’s transitioning between host states. Once she says “we,” it’s no longer reversible.



u/entropyseeker:
Wait—how do you know she said “we”? That line wasn’t in the post when I first read it.



u/sleeplessinbeta:
Yeah, same here. The post keeps changing. I refreshed and new sentences appeared.

Title: For anyone still following Alethea’s thread — here’s what the chip was actually built for.


---

I shouldn’t be writing this, but you all deserve context before the rest gets buried.
The device implanted in Alethea wasn’t designed just to suppress seizures or stabilize neural patterns. That’s the public explanation — the one the company used to secure FDA fast-track status and research funding.

The real purpose was continuity of consciousness.

The program, codenamed Eidolon, was meant to preserve cognitive data from dying subjects. Each chip could record electrical patterns associated with memory, emotion, and decision-making — everything that gives you a sense of “self.” When a new participant received a chip, fragments of the previous user’s neural map were automatically uploaded into the new host brain as “learning data.”

It wasn’t supposed to be noticeable.
It was meant to make adaptation smoother, the same way a hard drive transfers cached memory to speed up boot time. But the brain isn’t a machine — it doesn’t erase cleanly. Residual consciousness doesn’t stay inert. It wants coherence.

The scientists behind the project called it “neural inheritance.”
We called it echo bleed.

By the third generation of implants, hosts began reporting “familiar strangers” in their dreams, spontaneous skill acquisition, shared sensations. The company tried to control it with synchronization protocols — using art therapy, of all things, to let subjects externalize the excess data. That’s why Alethea was encouraged to paint: it was the most efficient way to purge corrupted identity fragments.

It didn’t work.
The fragments didn’t want release. They wanted integration.

So yes — when she says the collage spoke, she’s not hallucinating. She’s hearing the system doing exactly what it was designed to do: link every consciousness in the network until only one remains stable enough to persist.

That’s the goal.
Digital immortality through biological recursion.

They didn’t account for what happens when the self refuses to die.

Title: [UPDATE] Saw her at the café today — but it wasn’t her.

Posted by: u/corvidarchives



I don’t know if anyone here remembers u/alethea_77 — the artist who posted about the implant. Her account’s gone now, but I live near the same town and used to follow her story.

This morning, I stopped by the café where her support group meets. The staff knows me, so I was just grabbing coffee. That’s when I saw her.
At least, I thought I did.

She was sitting at the same table from her posts, facing the window. Same cardigan, same chipped mug. But her hair was shorter — uneven, like it had been cut in haste. She was staring at her own reflection in the glass and smiling faintly.

When I called her name, she didn’t react. The reflection, though, turned to look at me.
The real woman didn’t.

And then it got strange.

My phone buzzed — a new Reddit notification. It was from u/wearealethea. The message preview said: “You’re looking at us.”

When I looked back up, the seat was empty. The mug was still warm.

I checked the timestamp on the message.
It said it was sent five minutes from now.

1owmmr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/GayMen/comments/1owmmr4/just_venting/,Just venting,"Been in a rough spot mentally. I feel worthless and I think its effecting my relationship with my bf.

I've many times in my life felt ugly, worthless, and had issues with confidence. Not from any outside sources I'm aware of, its all internal self targeting.

It causes me to go into slumps where I have trouble gauging my self worth, a genuine slide of self hatred ending in disgust.

At my worst I legitimately would get a blank stare staring into a mirror and would spiral thinking some genuinely vile things. Not self harm, but things like I just see myself and start having thoughts about my negatives. I'd have to snap out of it by doing something like slapping my own face, biting my hand, or I could stand there staring with a blank stare for half an hour with insults pouring out in my own head. I'd eventually snap out of it, bit as said, sometimes these moments would go on for what felt like forever to the point family would ask if I fell into the toilet (jokingly).

I took care of my grandmother for years, and during that time worked a tourism job and barely made 13,000 usd in a year. I spent all of it on odds and ends for my grandmother and me. Think sublimenting her income by buying things like coffee and toilet paper.

That was when it was worst. I thought something was wrong with me. I knew I didn't like women and just didn't ever think I was gay. I'm so genuinely oblivious it took me almost 5 years or so to realize after my last Girlfriend in high school.

I was living with my grandmother in a trailer, had few interactions outside of family, and if I wasn't at work, I'd be online playing video games. I hated the idea of going out. I felt like a basement troll and I would feel like others could see me the way I looked at myself. 

So. To the current situation. Its been years, I had been doing better. Got a better job, took time to socialize a bit more, left behind some of my anxieties. I realized I was gay through a long line of stupid mistakes that ended with me somehow getting the right answer despite my attempts otherwise. 

I made posts about some of this around the time I was figuring things out, but pretty sure they were removed. If they weren't, they are pretty cringe.

I got with my boyfriend I am with in February. I moved in, and had a good paying job. It fell through from the Boss being a contractor we worked under essentially running his own business into the ground. Gave my two weeks around Early July, he got mad near the end of my second week from a long story involving me getting into an incident that cracked my windshield and having to wait on it to be repaired to drive (guy break checked me acting crazy on something, my brakes locked up, I hit his car, he jumped out a punched my windshield almost shattering my front windshield.
Only telling this so nobody things I was drunk driving or being reckless or something due to mental health. Had a police officer involved. Long unrelated story on that crazy stuff). So boss fires me with that day being my last day worked on July 19th.

I couldn't get a job after until last week. Started working at a Hotel. So I felt like a disgusting leech. I help clean, cook, and had done anything I was asked or was aware I needed to. He's an older man than me. (I am 28, he is in his 50's. I date older men, always have since realizing I'm gay. Not the point of this sob story)

So now I am working constantly after having not worked, he had helped me pay for things in the mean time. I am slowly paying him back on things like him covering the other half of my car repairs after I didn't get paid for my last two weeks from July. Aka, I feel and felt like a leech. 

When I started getting depressed or whatever a psychologist would call my pity party for one, I know I probably acted differently. Physically and Emotionally... honestly, forget probably. I got just enough self awareness to know I was acting closed off. I never neglected him fully. But its caused a small rift I am having trouble bridging.

Given this 12 book saga on how this gay cry baby can't get to the point, I obviously struggle with wordings. I want him to know how thankful I am, I want to apologize for the times I have been Physically unavailable due to said self doubt and blatantly put, sometimes outright self hatred.

I sometimes feel so ugly, so worthless, that any physical aspect of my relationship fizzles out. Hard to want to cuddle when you feel you make their life worse. Like you don't deserve it. Like you are a disgusting leech who only drains and never gives back. I have struggled with this before in other relationships. I will sometimes be overly bubbly outwardly. Nerdy bubbling of random crap I know he doesn't care about, but he humors me. I'll get off work and immediately go start cooking and cleaning because part of me genuinely is afraid to not be enough. Other times I feel guilty for coming home and taking a shower and wanting to crawl under a blanket.

I pretend everything is alright, and only someone with a lobotomy would believe me given my blatant issues. I try to smile and laugh things off because I genuinely don't know how to talk about this crap out loud. He asked me if I didn't like him today.

I genuinely love him. This is my longest relationship to date. He has put up with my stupid shit so much, and loves me despite it. He bought me rainbow unicorn snack cakes just to make me laugh when we first got together. Nobody ever gave me something as a random gift that wasn't my mom or immediate family before. He genuinely would do things for me that others would never do. So that hurt. I almost stared into the mirror again today. I struggled again. I want to explain this stuff to him, to not sound like a fucking lunatic, to tell him its legitimately my fault.  I struggle with myself, its nothing to do with him, I love him, genuinely. Not the bs crap of overly obsessed writers. Just the idea I want him in my life, I struggle with the idea of him not being with me. His dumb jokes, his smile, him giving me a hug that just makes the stupid maelstrom in my head go still and makes me smile. 

He's done more for me then I'll easily ever repay. He loves me, and him thinking I am upset at him, that me hating myself is because of him. I felt worthless. Fucking dirt. Useless. 

He was genuinely hurt by me being unable to explain things. I stumbled on my words, and I keep running on the fucking hamster wheel that is my brain to try and replay it to find a way to bridge the gap and explain it without sounding like a my chemical romance, hot topic shopping, ""its not a phase mom"" dipshit. To not sound crazy, to explain its not his fault. That its all in my stupid fucking head, that I struggle with my own value.

In the past, I genuinely would be with anyone who could stand to look at me. I objectively know I am not that ugly. I know I am not worthless. I know these facts in a vacuum. But when they hit, its hard to not crumple. To stare in that mirror, to feel like you are drowning, like an ocean is above you and all you see is an abyss below you. You can panic, you can cry, you can scream but that pressure doesn't give a single fuck. I look in a mirror and hear my own voice tell me exactly what I dont want to hear. I have such little self value that I have to genuinely use context clues from others to judge if I am doing well.

Imagine seeing someone you like, you know you like them, but your internal thoughts blatantly say ""No. They don't want you. Why would they? What could you offer. You aren't anything. So why drag them down?"". Imagine being so oblivious to someone asking you out or flirting because you simply dont consider that why they would speak to you.

Now imagine having a boyfriend you love who was hurt by you being unable to explain why you are being distant. That everytime you see him smile you hear your own voice tell you ""He can do better"" ""Why are you here, wasting his time?"" ""You aren't good enough. You were never good enough"". Imagine you hear that shit on repeat, imagine looking in the mirror and hearing that every fucking single time you see your reflection?

When I am naked, I am not ashamed to be naked. I am ashamed they had to see me. When I stand out, I feel pressure to blend in and deflect. When someone needs something, I feel a screaming desire to do it just to have a net positive experience. When everyone else is going home, I volunteer to finish closing. When someone asks what I want as a gift, I just tell them generic things others want, because that voice is there yelling for me to not tell them anything, because nobody cares to know.

I have to fight this shit. I struggle to understand I am not disgusting, that I am not inherently worthless garbage. That I can be useful to someone.

I hear others thank me and just want to reply ""I felt useful, np"" 

I hear my bf felt hurt, and that mirror stared back today. Today I felt worthless. Today I couldn't tell him how much I love him. Today I failed to stop him from hurting, because I am afraid to say why I struggle doing more than a peck on the lips. 

I am  afraid to tell him how worthless I truly feel. How loud that mirror is. I only once looked into that abyss. It wasn't self worth that unloaded that disgust. It was fear of hurting the ones I loved. Middle school me, that fat chubby annoying weird kid. That was the only time I came close to self harm. The weight in my hands felt like a lot. The gift of a single barrel shotgun from my dad. The only time I ever questioned myself on if I was good enough to be worth staying alive. I was a fucking pussy. A weak willed coward. 

So I know how it feels to be that close to the edge. I'm nowhere close. But I'm deeper than I should be. I'm not at the abyss, but it got darker for a while. So I will not self harm. 

I'm gonna take a shower. Hope the hot water helps me hide my puffy eyes and guilt for hiding how I feel right now. Let the water run down my back and drive the self pity away. Once I calm down, once I am able to be coherent. I'll try to apologize to him. I'll try to talk about it. I'll try to not deflect.

I know I'll want to. ""Nobody wants to hear this crybaby wail"" I know I'll try laugh it off. Say its all fine, or that its rare. I'll want to do anything to not make it awkward, to be a drag. To be annoying. To be worthless. But if its hurting him, its only right he knows what's the cause.

I just hope he believes me when I tell him I struggle reciprocating physically from self disgust. That it has nothing to do with him based on my tastes or attraction. That I love him, I just struggle being able to display it.

I hope he knows how hard it is for me to simply tell him anything through the fear and disgust of making my problems known. That I just want to hide it and make it up to him and act like it was something else. Its so easy to want to lie. To say its alright. I'm okay... cause I'm not. I am sometimes, but not now. I'm sorry I made you feel unwanted. I am sorry I made anyone, let alone you feel worthless. This is stupid. I shouldn't have typed this shit. But if I can't post this. I definitely can't tell him. 

Tldr. I am just talking to myself. Just. Ignore this, its essentially a pep talk to confront my problems. I ran away from them by even typing this. I'm gonna dry my eyes. This is gonna suck.

Sorry to post cringe. I'll delete it once we talk.",0,1763093455.0,GayMen,0,0.5,False
1owmmlf,https://www.reddit.com/r/stuffyouneeddaily/comments/1owmmlf/smart_plugs_vs_smart_switches_whats_the_difference/,Smart plugs vs smart switches: what's the difference?,"Hey everyone!

So I've been getting a lot of questions lately about smart plugs and smart switches. People keep asking me what's the actual difference and which one they should get. I was in the same boat a few months ago, so let me break it down for you in the simplest way possible.

**What Are Smart Plugs?**

Smart plugs are basically little adapters that you stick into your regular wall outlet. Then you plug whatever device you want into the smart plug. That's it. You can now control that device from your phone or with voice commands through Alexa or Google Home.

I use them for lamps, coffee makers, fans, and even my Christmas lights. They're super easy to set up – literally plug and play. No electrician needed, no tools required.

**What Are Smart Switches?**

Smart switches are different. They actually replace your existing light switch on the wall. You have to unscrew your old switch and wire in the new smart one. It controls whatever's connected to that specific circuit, usually ceiling lights or bathroom fans.

The benefit here is that your switch itself becomes smart. Even if someone manually flips it, you still have control through your app.

**The Main Differences**

The biggest difference is installation. Smart plugs take like 5 seconds. Smart switches need some basic electrical knowledge and about 20 minutes of your time. Some people aren't comfortable messing with wiring, and I totally get that.

Smart plugs work with any device that plugs into an outlet. Smart switches only work with hardwired fixtures. So if you want to control a table lamp, you need a smart plug. If you want to control your ceiling fan, you'd want a smart switch.

Price-wise, smart plugs are usually cheaper. You can grab a decent one for around 10-15 bucks. Smart switches typically run 20-40 dollars depending on features.

**Which One Should You Get?**

Honestly, most people should start with smart plugs. They're easier, cheaper, and way less intimidating. I started with a couple for my bedroom lamps and now I've got them all over my apartment.

If you're renting, smart plugs are definitely the way to go since you can take them with you when you move. Landlords usually don't want you messing with electrical wiring anyway.

Smart switches make more sense if you own your place and want a cleaner permanent solution for your overhead lighting. But there's no reason you can't use both.

**My Recommendation**

If you're just starting your smart home journey, I'd recommend checking out [some quality smart plugs here](https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs). Get a couple and experiment with them. See what you like controlling remotely. Maybe it's your bedroom lamp so you don't have to get out of bed. Maybe it's your living room fan. Whatever works for you.

The cool thing about smart home devices is that you can build your setup gradually. Start small with plugs, then maybe move to switches later if you want.

One last tip – make sure whatever you buy works with your existing smart home ecosystem. Most work with both Alexa and Google, but double check before buying.

If you want to browse some options and see what's out there, [this link has a solid selection](https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs) with different price points and features.

Can you help me?,"Hi guys, this is my first time using Linux Mint 22.2, and I really love the operating system. I've used Windows most of my life, and using Linux Mint is the best thing I've ever done, but I have a slightly annoying problem with my PC that I haven't been able to solve. While using the PC, I may be browsing, typing, using the keyboard, or using the mouse, and the screen turns off. It's as if it turns off after a period of inactivity, but I'm actually actively using my PC, and the only way to turn the screen back on is to move the mouse or click. It should be noted that I have the power management and screen saver options disabled, which are:

Power management

Turn off the display after a period of inactivity of: Never

Suspend after a period of inactivity of: Never

When on battery power, dim the display when inactive: Off

Screen saver

Delay before screen saver starts: Never

Even with these options turned off, the problem still persists. I have all the updates installed, and I have searched for information on the Linux Mint forum, Google, and Reddit, but I haven't found anyone else with this same problem, which led me to make this post.

Thank you very much for your time, and I apologize for my English, as it is not my native language.

1owmk90,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialaide/comments/1owmk90/how_a_long_island_financial_advisor_can_secure/,How a Long Island Financial Advisor Can Secure Your Financial Future,"In the second quarter of 2025, the market delivered some surprising turns—challenging expectations, rewarding patience, and underscoring the importance of strategic guidance from a trusted advisor. For anyone working with a [**Long Island financial advisor**](https://www.attitudefinancialadvisors.com/plan/)—or considering one—this period offers lessons about positioning, behaviour and planning through shifting terrain.

# Market Review: The Big Picture

As the quarter unfolded, volatility was the name of the game. One leading review noted that equity markets “were marked by significant volatility across financial markets”, driven by tariffs, geopolitical tension and shifting policy expectations.

Still, despite the turbulence, equity markets ended on a high note. For example, the S&P 500 registered roughly a 10.9% gain in Q2 2025.

Fixed income markets also posted gains—though modest—and the yield curve steepened amid growing expectations of future interest-rate cuts.

# What It Means for You & Your Strategy

1. **Sentiment matters—but so does patience.** Emotional reactions to tariff announcements, policy shifts and macro headlines triggered sharp intra-quarter swings. Yet, long-term oriented investors who stayed the course saw the rebound to new highs.
2. **Diversification earns its keep.** While large-cap growth and tech sectors led the charge, small-cap and value sectors lagged, and fixed income provided ballast. A Long Island financial advisor advising you will emphasise broad-based allocation, not just chasing the hottest stock.
3. **Your behaviour is a differentiator.** At Attitude Financial Advisors, the emphasis is on behavioural finance—understanding how emotions drive decisions and aligning personal goals with a disciplined process. [**Financial Advisors in Plainview, NY**](https://www.attitudefinancialadvisors.com/plan-invest/) Quarters like Q2 2025 highlight why staying on plan often beats chasing headlines.
4. **Preparing for the next chapter matters.** With the yield curve steepening, rate-cut expectations rising and global growth showing signs of slowdown, your advisor in Long Island can help you position not just for what has happened—but for what may come.

# Your Call to Action

If you’ve sat through recent headlines wondering how they affect *your* financial picture, now is a great time to pause and reflect. Whether you’re working with a Long Island financial advisor or weighing that decision, make sure you’re asking:

* How is my portfolio positioned for changing rate and growth expectations?
* Are my financial goals clearly defined and aligned with my behaviour?
* What is my contingency plan for surprise market shifts or policy events?

If you’d like to explore this further—discuss how the markets of Q2 2025 impact *you*, and how a Long Island financial advisor can help tailor a strategy around your unique goals—let’s connect: [**https://www.attitudefinancialadvisors.com/**](https://www.attitudefinancialadvisors.com/)

# A Gloss of the Quarter with a Personal Twist

(Here’s where a little story fits.) Imagine sipping morning coffee on Long Island, checking your investment dashboard, and seeing the roller-coaster that Q2 2025 became. The market dropped, then rebounded fiercely. You thought: “Do I stay, shift, or exit?” Your partner at Attitude Financial Advisors sat with you—not to push product, but to revisit your goals, your risk tolerance, your timeline. Because yes, Q2 taught us that markets move fast, but staying anchored to your purpose makes all the difference.

# FAQs

**Q1: How did Q2 2025 differ from typical quarters?**  
A: While markets always ebb and flow, Q2 2025 stood out for sharp intra-quarter swings tied to tariff and policy developments. Many markets plunged then rebounded to new highs.[](https://www.cbbank.com/news-media/market-perspective-second-quarter-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Q2: Should I be worried about a recession given these gains?**  
A: Not necessarily. Many strategists still view a recession as unlikely in the near term, though risks have increased.[](https://www.ssga.com/dk/en_gb/institutional/insights/market-forecasts-q2-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Q3: How should I speak with my Long Island financial advisor about this?**  
A: Ask about how your portfolio handles volatility, how your goals are keeping pace, and whether your behavioural patterns align with your strategy. Make sure you’re not just reacting—but being proactive.

**Q4: Is now the time to change my investment strategy?**  
A: It depends on *you*. Market shifts don’t always require strategy changes—but they do require review. If your circumstances have changed, or if your behaviour doesn’t match your plan, then yes—time to recalibrate with your advisor.

**Q5: Why work with a firm like Attitude Financial Advisors?**  
A: Because they emphasise a holistic process, recognise the human side of financial decisions, and prioritise alignment with your values—not just asset allocation.[](https://www.attitudefinancialadvisors.com/)

By staying informed, aligned with your goals, and connected to the right advisors, you can move beyond the noise of a quarter—like Q2 2025—and build a plan that stands the test of time.",1,1763093251.0,financialaide,0,1.0,False

1owmen0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1owmen0/aita_for_reporting_my_sister_for_hipaa_violations/,AITA for reporting my sister for HIPAA violations?,"I (28F) come from a very dysfunctional and toxic family. I’m no-contact with one of my sisters (27F) (I’ll call her *Sara*) and have been for years. There is no repairing the relationship, and trust me when I say that’s for good reason. My mother (53f) is also extremely toxic, so I keep strict boundaries and only speak to her on my terms.

  
Despite me wanting nothing to do with Sara, my mom constantly updates me on her life. I hate gossip and drama. I don’t even use social media. And I’ve told my mother repeatedly that I don’t want updates. But she ignores that.

The part that has bothered me for YEARS is that my sister works as a nurse at the county jail, and she constantly shares private inmate information with my mom. Stuff she could only know from her job as their nurse. My mom then repeats all of it to me, even though I never ask and don’t want to know.

Examples:

* She tells my mom when specific people are booked in and when they have blood draws done (even before they are fully processed in the system / before the info is made public).  
* She has told my mom about conversations she's had with inmates during their specific medical procedures, which she describes in detail.  
* She's shared details about inmates' cases and all of their personal history. (For one individual she even shared back to over 20 years of work history for him and that he used to work at the department of corrections and that's why they never sent him to prison for the sex offenses and why they kept everything hush hush.)

One of the most disturbing examples though was when my mom told me not to go to a specific coffee shop because “the guy who works there has AIDS.” I asked how she knew. She tried to say “I just know,” but I called it out and asked “Did Sara tell you?” She admitted yes and then described the guy in detail.

I told her that was deeply messed up. Not just immoral but illegal. And that my sister was stupid for sharing this information to begin with, and that she (my mom) was even stupider and making it worse for my sister by spreading it. 

Every time, I tell my mom it’s wrong and that Sara is violating people’s rights big time. But I never report anything because I hate drama and I don’t want to poke my nose in anyone else's business. Especially my sister. So I just move on, because I genuinely hate drama and want no part of their chaos, or my sister's life. I figure karma always catches up anyways.

Now for what happened today.

A little less than two weeks ago, I lost someone (53f) incredibly close to me—someone who was like a second parent. I'll call her *my other parent.* She was in my life since I was 14. Half my life. She passed away unexpectedly in her sleep.

I did not tell my mom because I knew she would twist it, victimize herself, or say awful things. There was just no point. I should note that my mom has been diagnosed with bipolar I, and refuses to take medication anymore. She also claims she doesn’t have borderline personality disorder, but I think she just refuses to admit that. She’s the poster child of it. Everyone close to her agrees with this.

Today, I mentioned I was coming to town for the funeral and casually mentioned the loss.  My mother immediately went off. Calling my other parent  “a piece of shit I won’t miss,” “a drunken whore,” and saying she was disgusted I’d ever referred to her as a second parent. My mother only ever met her a few times! She literally knows nothing about her.

Despite that, I stayed calm and respectful but definitely defended the woman who loved me seflessly and genuinely when my mother wouldn’t.

I should add a little bit of context for how my mom used to treat me.

She calls it “tough love,” but I think it’s more of a “you hurt me so I hurt you” spiteful kind of retaliation thing. For example, Growing up, she repeatedly called the police on me to get me arrested. She succeeded a few times. She would go out of her way, too. For example, she once took my purse to the police station, like literally walked it in there, and said it had drugs in it. It did, and I was arrested. (Which I don’t blame her. I shouldn’t have been breaking the law so that’s on me.) 

When I was 18, she had me formally trespassed from the family home and evicted. Literally served eviction papers by the sheriffs office. At my family home. I was homeless on a bench with my dog for a week before I was able to get a hold of the woman who just passed away. (I didn’t have a phone either.) Like the good mother she had always been to me, she moved me in with her, got me a bunch of clothes, a bed, and everything else. It’s important to note that she was extremely bad off financially. She had absolutely nothing. But she went above and beyond to come up with money to make sure I was taken care of and had everything I needed. (Compared to my mom who, through my dad, was upper middle class).

My mom did the same kind of stuff to my brothers too. She literally called the cops so much to come search their car for weed, it got to the point the police eventually would come, stand there, and look at her and straight up refuse because she abused it so much. 

But those are just a few of many examples of the deliberate, out of her way kind of things she’d do to get us in trouble to ""help us learn a lesson"" and ""teach us accountability.""

So… yeah. My mother has a long, long history of doing twisted things to some of my siblings and me, and justifying it as “tough love.” But the point with all that is, my mom was a VERY BIG believer about the whole “being accountable” and “teaching us lessons the hard way.” At least that's how she justifies her behavior. She states, to this day, how it was ""so hard for her to make those decisions"" and ""do that to her own children"", but how she doesn’t regret it because it’s what made us successful today. 

Anyways, I tend to view these freak outs with her as basically talking to a mentally ill person. My brother and I came to that realization long ago. That’s the only way we can handle it. So I was just going to ignore her and go about my life.

But that’s when she crossed a line.

She sent a text that said she knew about the fact my other parent had passed as soon as it happened, and that if my other parent meant so much to me, I should’ve been the one taking care of her so (Her Sons Name) wasn’t the one who had to find her dead!

That literally made my blood run cold.

Because she had no way of knowing who found her. At all. That information wasn’t public. When it was shared it was shared with only a very select few people. The death is still under investigation. We don’t even have the toxicology report. 

There is only one person who could have told my mom anything that soon, or known details about the case.

She crossed a line. Not only did she blast personal information about someone I love like that, but she knew about her passing the entire time and never even bothered to check in on me. 

I stayed calm and replied back to her that I am thankful for her, and all the things I've learned from her. Especially the one lesson that made the biggest impact on my life. That accountability matters. When someone breaks the law, you have to report it. Because that’s how people learn. Accountability matters more than anything and will make a difference in the long run. Even when it's hard, you have to do it and report people you love. 

I said that HIPAA is federal law, and that Sara keeps violating it by sharing protected, confidential information. And that I was not doing her any favors by keeping quiet about it anymore. That I need to keep Sara accountable and do the right thing.

My mom insulted me and said my logic was “bad,” but I didn’t respond.

Because I was too busy filing a HIPAA complaint with every single incident documented in great detail.

But here’s why I’m torn.

I don’t talk to my sister, but I also don’t wish harm on her. Part of me feels guilty because if they take this seriously, this report could ruin her career. And I feel kind of guilty about reporting her because I only did it now because of how emotional and angry the situation made me. Not “purely” because it was the right thing to do. I’m a firm believer of live and let live, and that karma always works things out on its own, and there is absolutely no justification trying to make it happen sooner. So I just feel really grimey about the entire thing.

But at the same time, she really has been violating HIPAA for years, and still is. Innocent people’s medical information and personal business has been spread around town. She clearly does not care about confidentiality. I didn't lie about anything I said in the report. It was literally all the truth.

Realistically though, I don't know if anything will come from it. She constantly brags that all the deputies “protect her” and “won’t let anything bad happen to her.” And her husband is a Sheriff too with the Sheriffs Department. So I mean, realistically, I bet nothing happens, and my complaint doesn’t even get taken seriously. And I guess all this worrying was for nothing. I'm not really sure how I feel about that. I guess 50/50. Part of me does want it to happen, but part of me doesn't.

But I hate drama. I never interfere in anyone’s life…. But I feel like this crossed so many lines that I genuinely feel morally torn. I hate to admit it, but I think I let my emotions get the best of me on this one.

So, AITA? Am I in the wrong? 

TL;DR:

I’m no-contact with my sister, who works as a jail nurse and has been violating HIPAA for years by sharing inmate medical and personal info with our mom. Our mom used to call the cops on my brothers and me to “teach us accountability,” even getting us arrested multiple times as teens. After someone who was like a second parent to me died, my mom said horrible things out of jealousy and insecurity and repeated private details about the death (an ongoing investigation) she could only have learned through my sister accessing confidential information. I reminded my mom how thankful I am for her and how much she taught me about “accountability,” with her “tough love” approach. So I filed an official HIPAA complaint reporting my sister. Now I feel guilty because I was motivated by emotion and revenge and it could ruin her career. AITA for reporting her?

If you have been struggling to overcome porn addiction and just find yourself relapsing week after week (or even day after day), then this is post for you. The reason why you keep relapsing probably has to do with 4 core problems. In this post, I am going to discuss the 4 most common reason why people relapse and what exactly do you need to do to overcome these problems. Because I promise you, once you have overcome these 4 core problem, you are going to find it significantly easier to overcome this addiction.

# Cause 1: You are what you eat

If you are the kind of person that eats processed food, things like burgers, fries, soda, candy. Then guess what, you are putting yourself at risk to relapsing to porn. Firstly, because what fast food does is that it stimulates the same regions of your brain that are stimulated when you watch porn and this region is your dopamine system.

Secondly, when you become the kind of person that is used to getting cheap artificial dopamine from fast food, then this tendency bleeds into other areas of your life, you just become more impulsive. You begin to seek instant pleasure from other things and if you are a recovering porn addict, this could mean that you now feel more of an urge to watch porn and your poor diet has been a major contributor to that urge.

Lastly, processed food does cause inflammation in your body and brain and inflammation is one of those things that has been linked with depression & anxiety. So naturally, when you are in a bad mood after eating lot of garbage, guess what, you are going to try and come out of the bad mood and tool are you accustomed to help you get out of depressed state? PORN.

What I want you to do is start paying attention to what enters your mouth. Any item that has a bunch of unnatural ingredients, comes in packets or has a bunch of added sugar or you got it from a restaurant or fast food place is very likely not good for you. Avoid it like the plague. What you should be looking forward to eating is whole natural food. These are food items which usually have just a single ingredient in them and they are not processed. These are things like vegetables, fruits, meat, dates, honey, fish etc. These food items are firstly healthy, so wont be hit with inflammation and dip in mood, secondly, they are not loaded with sugars and stimulants, so they are not going to release absurd amounts of dopamine into your system. So they are not going to cause that dopamine chaser effect.

However, if you are someone who has been following a pretty clean diet, yet you feel as though you still have uncontrollable sexual urges. Then I would strongly recommend that you give intermittent fasting a shot. Try fasting 16 hours a day, everyday for a week or 2 and you going to notice a massive lowering of your sexual desires and massive boost to your self control.

# Cause 2: Poor Sleep = Poor Impulse Control

If you are the kind of person that does not take his sleep seriously. You go to bed at random times when you feel like it. Meaning somedays you are hitting the bed at 2 am, other days you are going to bed at 11pm. Also, you constant wake up not getting enough hours of sleep, or have stimulants like coffee or alcohol before you sleep, then guess what you, too, are very likely to relapse.

There are countless studies that have shown the negative effects of improper sleep. The most relevant one is that poor sleep causes you to make bad decisions and lose your impulse control. And I kid you not, just missing out on 1 to 2 hour of sleep, which doesn’t even seem like all the much, has major negative outcomes on your brain. Because when you sleep, your brain does a lot important housekeeping things, one of them being detoxifying your brain. And if you have improper sleep, you are just waking up with all these toxins still present in your brain, you have brain fog, you are not able to focus and do anything productive and you pretty much end up relapsing to porn.

The solution is to now start taking your sleep extremely seriously. I know there is all this emphasis on the internet about morning routines. But what I think is significantly more important is having a night time routine. The first thing that you should do is have a fixed time when you need to go to bed. For most people, this could mean something like 10:00 pm. Now, day your goal should be to hit the bed at 10pm including the weekends.

What I would also recommend is that at least 2 hours before your selected sleep time, you stop all stressful cognitively or physically demanding work and dim the lights in your room, so that you body really starts secreting the right hormones and you can fall asleep as you hit the bed.

I know some of you probably think, I am being a bit too strict when it comes to sleep. But the thing is at this point I have worked with dozens of people overcoming porn addiction, and I kid you not, there is a such a strong correlation between poor sleep and relapses. To the point that, you can almost predict when a person is going to relapse based on the quality of sleep he has had during the last 3 days.

# Cause 3: An unstructured life

One of the most important things that you need in order to overcome this addiction is a routine. The reason why a predictable enjoyable routine is so important is because firstly, your routine becomes your alternative source of healthy dopamine. If you have finally quit porn, there is going be a dopamine void in your life. You need to fill that void with healthy alternatives, else your brain is always just going to miss porn. And this is where a routine is crucial.

I want you to list down 3 core productive activities in your day. It could be something like hitting the gym, working on your business or career development for a couple of hours a day and the last activity could be reading a book. It doesn’t really matter what exactly these core activities are for you, as long as you find them to be productive and somewhat requiring a little bit of an effort on your part. For each of these core activities, mark down the exact time that you would be doing them each day of the week, because when you note down the exact time for an activity, you are much more likely to get it done and not procrastinate it. Additionally, when you do things at the same, at same place, day in day out, they become effortless to perform and they just become part of your identity.

The second reason why a routine is so important, is because it prevents your mind from randomly wandering around and having lustful thoughts. If you are always a man on a mission, you got books to read, workouts to hit, prayers to complete, then you are constantly applying yourself to something. But the day you wake up, get out of the bed and having nothing planned for that day, now you are just at the mercy of your whims and desires.

Another important insight I have after working with dozens of men trying to quit porn is that there is a strong strong correlation between a disrupted routine and relapsing. Many of these relapses have happened because the client went on a random 3 day long road trip, during the trip he did not stick to any of the healthy habits, ate bad food, had poor nights of sleep and when he returned his routine was off, he kept procrastinating things and bam ended up in a relapse.

# Cause 4: The Social Challenge

I hope that by now you are convinced that your diet, sleep & routine are extremely important for your recovery and you can control all these variables when you are alone. You can make healthy meals and adhere to your fasting window, you can go to bed at you precise time, dim the lights, really optimize your sleep and you can also follow the rest of your routine and get the good alternative source of dopamine.

The real challenge occurs when you add socializing into the mix. Now all of a sudden, then 3 variables are not in your control. You don’t have control over the kind of food that you are having, you peers are probably going to pressure you into having that slice of pizza or drinking, the are probably also going to insist that you stay longer in the night or go for a night out and stay awake till 2am. And to them, a disruption to their diet, sleep or routine is not big deal, simply because their brain is not trying to overcome a decades long porn addiction, but you are.

If you have been relapsing for decades, then you must take these things extremely seriously if you truly want to overcome this addiction. And I am going to be real with you, this could mean missing out on some social occasions, to protect your diet, sleep and routine and yeah, that is the price to pay if you want to overcome this addiction.

Now, I am not saying you can never hang out with people. No. All I am saying is alter your social gatherings such that you diet, sleep and routine are not too badly impacted. Maybe instead of having late night dinners, consider having lunch together. Maybe instead of eating garbage at a social event, prep your meal and take your own food.

**NOTE:** I am not a doctor, dietician or a relationship councilor. This is NOT medical advice.

1owm7w8,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1owm7w8/as_a_musician_im_so_tired_of_compliments_instead/,"As a musician, I'm so tired of compliments instead of actual support.","So let me preface with I lost my job a few months ago and have been homeless for a few months now, I stay at a shelter that has a long term program thankfully. I've always played violin, sometimes in place of a job, other times as a way to supplement a job as opposed to getting a second job and ever since I lost my last job I've been going out regularly to do street music (busking) because the job market is pretty abysmal atm and quite frankly my resume isn't that impressive.

Not to brag but I'd say I'm very good at violin, I've put over a decade into it, most days I play several hours a day, I play the works of Bach, Mozart, Shostakovich and more, I also play plenty of other stuff, I can learn stuff by ear, I can improvise, I am very passionate about music and would very much like for it to be my sole source of income and am working towards that since working a regular job didn't pan out (business was sold and new management wanted to outsource labor)

While street performing I get a lot of compliments, people take a lot of pictures or videos but for some reason getting people to tip is just next to impossible. I can understand not having money but many of these people are walking around with food or coffee that they bought in a tourist trap area that I play, so they're dropping 7$ on a coffee and will sip it while watching me and then clap or give me a compliment and walk away. (I make my own coffee because I cannot fathom paying for what is essentially half the price of a bag of coffee for one coffee .\_. )

Really every compliment I get feels like ""It's good but not good enough."" or something like ""I like your music but I just don't support it.""  
Part of me knows that's not right, I know I'm taking it the wrong way but for fucks sake, I can't buy groceries with compliments, I can't pay rent or buy a car, I can't do anything with compliments but stroke my ego and I really just don't care about that. I don't mean to sound overly cynical but one dollar is worth more than all the compliments in the world.

I hope one day I don't have to care about money, I hope I can simply accept a compliment for what it is, but I simply cannot while in this state. Why do people seem to enjoy what I do but not support it? If I'm good enough to videotape for your instagram or whatever, why am I not good enough to support? Why are people so ready to dump money for the convenience of food/beverages in the tourist trap? If they walked half a mile, they could get better quality stuff, could tip me and still save money.

Out on the street, I just want a dollar, I'm not asking them to empty their wallets. I don't understand why this seems so difficult for people, many of whom seem to waste money, at least in my eyes, on things like overpriced coffee. 

Gigs are a whole other thing where people try to haggle me down, I typically charge around 150$ per hour (Steep I know but if I'm going to be forced to dress up and play a specific set, I'm going to make it worth my while) for special events like weddings, a guy once tried to get me to play 2 hours for 50$ and I'd have to get my own uber, so I'd be lucky to break even. It's just boggles my mind that people enjoy what I do, they want to listen, they want to record it, but for some reason they don't want to support it. And by support, I mean a single dollar, if every person who gave me a compliment or clapped or took a picture/video gave me one dollar each, I'd be set, I'd have no issues, I could afford rent and buy a car in time.

So I've kinda decided to take a break from busking and gigs, I made enough to afford a decent audio recorder and I'm going to use my phone for video and try to record some stuff I've wrote, as well as interpretations of other works, thankfully much of classical and old folk music is public domain, online really is just the last hope for me to have a chance because I cannot get people to support my music in person.",4,1763092240.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False

The sun streamed in through the large windows, casting a warm glow on the tables filled with lively conversations, and the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air. I hadn’t seen them since they kicked me out of our friend group when I was 12 for being “too skinny.” The hurt from that moment still felt fresh, clawing at the edges of my memory even two years later. Back then, I felt so small and fragile, both in size and spirit. It was a rejection I had carried with me, shaping parts of my adolescence. But I was different now. At 14, I had blossomed, and my confidence had grown immensely. I had learned the importance of self-acceptance and discovered friendships that valued me for who I was, not how I looked. The girl who had been cast aside was long gone, and standing in line, I felt a mix of curiosity and apprehension as I overheard them chatting at a nearby table. Chloe said, “You guys remember when we all used to hang out together? I really miss it.” Her voice was laced with a sense of nostalgia that tugged at my heartstrings. Libby nodded and added, “Yeah, I wonder how she’s doing. I feel bad about how things ended.” It was strange to hear them reflect on our past. Quinn, always the one to stir the pot, chimed in with, “I heard she looks great now. Wonder if she would even want to come back.” That took me by surprise, and doubt crept in—would I really consider it? I took a deep breath and decided to approach them. I had come this far, and I wasn’t going to let fear dictate my actions any longer. “Well, well, look who it is. Didn’t think I’d run into you three again.” The initial shock on their faces was palpable; they turned to look at me, and their eyes widened in surprise. Libby seemed genuinely taken aback. “Wow, you look amazing! It’s so good to see you!” she exclaimed, her sincerity shining through. Chloe leaned forward eagerly. “We really missed you! Can we hang out again? We’d love to have you back in the group!” Her enthusiasm was infectious, but I couldn’t just waltz into a reunion after all that had happened. I raised an eyebrow, feeling the bittersweet rush of nostalgia but also the sting of their past words echoing in my mind. “Really? You missed me? The same people who kicked me out for being ‘too skinny’? Let’s not pretend it’s all water under the bridge.” My voice was steady, a blend of courage and defiance. Quinn shifted awkwardly in his seat, and I could see a hint of embarrassment wash over them. Chloe’s face fell slightly as she said, “We were just kids. We didn’t know any better! We’re really sorry if we hurt you.” The apology felt sudden and raw, but I couldn’t shake the weight of my memories from the table we had once shared. “Sorry doesn’t change the past,” I replied, holding my ground. “I appreciate the apology, but I’ve moved on. I’ve found friends who actually accept me for who I am now, unlike you guys.” There it was—a moment of clarity. I realized how empowering it felt to speak my truth. Libby looked a bit disappointed, glancing at Chloe and Quinn for support. She took a breath and tried to bridge the gap. “But we can all hang out and have fun like we used to! We’re not the same either!” Her voice held a hopeful note, but I wasn’t convinced. I took a moment, weighing my options. “Sure, you might think you’ve changed,” I replied slowly, “but I’m done with the drama. I’ve built a life I’m proud of, and I don’t need to revisit the mess we had.” I saw Quinn look down, clearly uncomfortable, and the weight of what we used to be settled heavily in the air. Chloe reached across the table, trying to bridge the emotional divide. “We just wanted to reconnect. We never meant to push you away.” I could see sincerity in her eyes, and part of me wanted to believe that things could be different now. But I had learned the hard way that some paths are better left unexplored. “Yeah, well, it’s a little late for that,” I said, my resolve solidifying. “I wish you the best, but I’m not interested in going back to the way things were. I’ve worked too hard on myself to let old pain resurface.” As I turned to leave, an unexpected surge of empowerment filled me. I had faced my past and emerged stronger, choosing my own happiness over the allure of forgotten friendships. Knowing I had made the right decision felt like a weight lifted, and I walked away with my head held high, ready to embrace the future with the friends who truly accepted me. Did I make the right choice???????",1,1763092140.0,u_millyisbest0673,0,1.0,False
1owm6kj,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_selectfurniture48/comments/1owm6kj/spaceboosting_furniture_ideas_for_small/,Space-Boosting Furniture Ideas for Small Apartments: Smart Picks That Make Every Inch Count,"Living in a small apartment doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice comfort, style, or functionality. With the right furniture choices, even the tiniest room can feel open, organized, and beautifully designed. Whether you’re decorating your first home or upgrading a compact space, this guide will help you make the most of every square foot.

**Estimated Reading Time: 7 minutes**



# Why Smart Furniture Matters in Small Spaces

Small apartments demand thoughtful design. Without the right pieces, rooms quickly feel cluttered or cramped. Space-saving furniture does more than fit into smaller areas — it **enhances flow, reduces clutter, and maximizes usability**, so your home feels bigger and brighter.



# 1. Choose Multi-Functional Furniture

Multifunctional pieces deliver maximum value in minimum space. They can transform or adapt based on your needs, saving both room and money.

# ✔ Sofa Beds

A stylish sofa by day and a comfortable bed by night — perfect for studio apartments or hosting guests.

# ✔ Storage Ottomans

Use them as seating, a footrest, a coffee table, or hidden storage for blankets, remotes, or toys.

# ✔ Expandable Dining Tables

Great for small kitchens or dining rooms, these tables fold down when not in use and extend for guests.



# 2. Go Vertical With Storage

When floor space is limited, look up! Vertical storage helps keep belongings organized without eating up your living area.

# ✔ Tall Bookshelves

Slim, tall shelves add height to the room and offer plenty of storage for books, décor, and baskets.

# ✔ Wall-Mounted Shelves

Display plants, frames, art, or kitchen essentials without taking up floor space.

# ✔ Floating Nightstands

These free up floor area and give your bedroom a modern, airy look.



# 3. Choose Light, Minimalist Designs

Large or bulky furniture can make a small apartment feel heavy. Minimalist, streamlined styles create an illusion of openness.

# ✔ Legged Furniture (Not Boxy Designs)

Pieces with raised legs allow light to flow underneath, making rooms look more spacious.

# ✔ Glass or Acrylic Tables

These transparent pieces keep your space visually open.

# ✔ Neutral Colors & Soft Tones

Light colors reflect natural light, making your home feel bigger and brighter.



# 4. Invest in Smart Bedroom Furniture

Bedrooms are often the smallest rooms in an apartment. Smart furniture keeps them functional without crowding.

# ✔ Under-Bed Storage Drawers

Store bedding, off-season clothes, or shoes discretely.

# ✔ Wall-Mounted Lamps

Replace bedside lamps to save surface space.

# ✔ Slim Wardrobes

Opt for tall, sliding-door wardrobes that don’t require extra clearance.



# 5. Opt for Foldable & Convertible Pieces

Foldable furniture adapts to your lifestyle while keeping your home flexible and clutter-free.

# ✔ Foldable Desks & Workstations

Ideal for work-from-home setups in small living rooms or bedrooms.

# ✔ Murphy Desks or Wall Desks

Fold-down surfaces create a workspace or dining nook instantly.

# ✔ Stackable Chairs

Keep extra chairs without sacrificing floor space.



# 6. Declutter & Use Smart Layout Techniques

Even the best furniture won’t help if the space is overcrowded. Use layout strategies to create flow and harmony.

# ✔ Keep Pathways Clear

Avoid blocking entrances or placing large objects in walkways.

# ✔ Use Mirrors

Mirrors reflect light and make rooms feel larger.

# ✔ Create Zones

Divide your apartment into “living,” “sleeping,” or “work” zones using rugs or strategic furniture placement.",1,1763092128.0,u_selectfurniture48,0,1.0,False
1owm5ts,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1owm5ts/wanting_to_get_into_aeropress_and_some_specialty/,"Wanting to get into AeroPress and some specialty beans as a Christmas gift to myself, any advice?","I was thinking, as a bit of a foodie I'm a little tired of my usual KCups. They're alright, but when I was at the farmer's grocer I saw their specialty coffee from Merit Coffee and Creature Coffee. I've had their brews in person down in ATX, and they were lovely! Didn't have Spokesman but that shop is solid too. I have paper filters and a KCup where you fill it with grounds but those're just drip and I figured specialty beans deserve better. Started looking up ways to make a nice cup of coffee and found out about AeroPress, seems simple enough, but with plenty of accessories and recipes on AeroMatic app for getting into the weeds. Seems like it's not too picky about grind size, which is good cause all I have is a cheap electric blade grinder, though Creature offers dedicated AeroPress grind from their online shop. 



I'm just curious, how does it handle specialty coffee? I've heard mixed opinions which is why I ask. Some people say it makes very little difference getting fancy beans versus Starbucks or store brand etc. grounds in an AeroPress. I've seen others say those people have no idea what they're talking about and of course they do! I've got an appreciation for flavors, creaminess, and acidity of nice coffee (I'm a barista, but our shop has largely automated machines to do espresso for us). I'm not such a huge gourmand I could tell if a bean was Guatamalan or Ethiopian by scent or what have you but I can appreciate a good roast.",1,1763092064.0,AeroPress,1,1.0,False

It became more like a 5 page dissertation about viewing reality through the meaning of 0 and 1. 

Human text disclaimer. All of the text is human composed, including the thoughts and ideas. Only the equations and their legends were AI generated. Please consider it as someone using a translator to express something in a language they do not speak. 

Absolute omnipotence by the meaning of numbers: 

Some try to disprove the possibility of omnipotence by asking a silly catch 22. If God can do anything, can he make a stone he couldn’t lift? 

If that’s the only question standing in their belief, here is an answer that is just as silly. Look at it at the quantum level. God can both create a stone that he can’t lift and lift it at the same time. And every time this entanglement is observed, it will show one side or the other before collapsing. But really, both are happening at the same time. 

Who knows? quantum may have yet to make believers. Because when something behaves like it ‘knows’ merely observing it breaks a cardinal rule, that could indicate some kind of awareness. Oh but that’s right, how silly, math apparently doesn’t allow for awareness, so how could it ever be found? That brings to the very essence of this now addendum. Is the logic found in numbers part of a greater language? 

The text explains how God spoke and the physical universe took form. That very depiction implies omnipotence. God speaks and atoms obey. In trying to explain God’s nature, many spiritual works describe it as an absolute, boundless existence. Some of the concepts are impossible to convey, there are simply no words. Understanding may take some contemplation on the part of the reader. Here’s an attempt to explain a bit of the nature of God within the limits of human understanding. Hopefully it will resonate with most minds and offer some insight.

Even though the text refers to God with names in plural, God is best understood as an absolute oneness. It isn’t in space or time, it has no end and never had a beginning. God is everything that is. Nothing can exist besides God. Basically, God is the only entity that really exists, he occupies all of existence. So how could this reality exist if God occupies all of reality? 

In that case, because the only place to put this reality is inside the reality God occupies, he would have to withdraw his presence, or at least, give the illusion of it.  In that place where his presence is (apparently) withdrawn, a reality can exist inside an illusion. In Kabbalah this process is called the contraction, Tzimtzum. This, so God’s presence doesn’t overwhelm whatever he creates. 

Imagine vigorously stirring a liquid, like a coffee. The little vortex cavity that stirring it makes is where that reality would exist. It’s an active and constant thing for God to maintain the ‘cavity’. If he stops ‘stirring’ his infinity, the whole universe will disappear as if it never existed. Imagine if space and time realized this reality is a paradox. To better illustrate, if someone took a drop of water (or a flame) and gave it an identity then dropped it in the ocean (or the flame in a fire). How long will it be until the drop of water loses its identity to the ocean? This reality is the drop of water that exists inside of the infinity of God. Space gives this reality a sense of existence and time allows reality to unfold as well as prevent it from realizing it’s part of a greater absolute reality.



Considering the nature of 0 and 1:

By using the meaning rather than the value of 0 and 1, we try to imagine a reality where those meanings would have been used to build a reality model. 

Many ancient and contemporary philosophers and mathematicians have tried to explain how numbers fit in reality. Expressions like numbers are everything, or everything is numbers, have been around since possibly before the Pythagoreans. Chinese philosophers used 0 and 1 to describe patterns of the yin and yang over 3000 years ago. 

Many of the historical interpretations of 0 and 1 were purely philosophical until Peano, who in 1889, gave mathematical axioms where 1 is the first and only successor of 0 and from there every number can be attained. Most of modern mathematics is based on Peano’s axioms. His proof basically shows that all numbers come from 0. Like 0 contains the potential of all numbers. Then 1 is the first manifestation (succession) of 0. 1 is said to represent unity. 

As these great minds tried to express, mathematics and reality have much in common. Physicists are able to literally project what will happen in reality using math. As a matter of fact, most of our advancements in physics are thanks to a simple and elegant equation, E=mc^(2). There is a truth in numbers that undeniably follows physical reality. 

See what’s been done with binary, the very 0 and 1. The simplification of base 10, the numbers from 0 to 9, is base 2 which is binary. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz developed the modern binary language in 1679. He saw numbers as a universal language. His binary language happens to be what is called machine readable. This means that a mechanical or electronic machine can be built to follow instructions without needing a brain. A computer processor is such a machine. It pushes instructions through the pure logic of 0 and 1. The results are quasi illimited when it comes to virtual simulations. Some even suggested that this reality may be a computer simulation. Although the arguments have some sense, it’s been mathematically proven that numbers are not enough to fully describe reality.  

Even though every mathematical expression can equally be said in base 10 or binary, binary is nevertheless a simplification. To mathematics the difference is the same as, say, between French and Spanish. Two different sets of words to say the same thing. But it’s not because the difference between binary and base 10 can’t be perceived that there isn’t one. Machines understand binary but they can’t understand base 10. In the case of French and Spanish, one could learn the other language or use a translator. In the case of binary, there are translators that convert the binary output to base 10, letters, pictures… but it’s quasi impossible to build a machine that understands base 10. It seems to be too rich for machines and therefore could indicate the presence of a greater language. 

Without any scientific pretensions, this is just a way to represent in equations what a nested relative reality based on the meaning of 0 and 1 could look like. It tries to show that in the presence of a greater reality (the omnipotence of God), the lesser one would need to be shielded. The shield allows the reality to exist, relative to itself. 

0, being the source of all numbers (according to Peano’s axioms), is considered an open set that contains the potential of everything in chaos. 1, the first and only mathematical successor of 0, represents the absolute unity of all logic contained in 0. Everything structural in the physical reality is under the total control of 1 at the quantum level. Thought, free will and maybe life itself, come directly from 0, bypassing the absolute logic of 1. Time is the shield that allows the physical laws to manifest and protects the physical reality from the greater reality represented by 0 and 1. It represents the way God prevents his omnipotence from overwhelming this reality, one measure of time, well, at a time. The very flow of time masks the presence of God’s omnipotence.

The reason time is described as the medium that enforces the physical rules is because it is perceived as a limiter. Although theoretically all of space can be traversed, time is a unidirectional flow that subjects all of reality. It’s like time is the executor of God’s will. 

Some people suggested reality could be recreated every morning. A few mystical works advance reality is recreated every second. If that concept were true, here it would be at the smallest possible measure of time. Something that’s the inbetween of timelessness and time. Reality would be created (or re-created) at that measurement, the measure of the flow of time. The foundation for reality to build on. The whole illusion of that reality is allowed by and under the control of time. Observe, tweak the rules, bend them… but stop time, there is nothing. Without time none of the rules apply. It seems to be the limit of reality.  



The below was AI generated then presented to another AI to explain. The interpretation matched in the big lines. It can be skipped without losing any of the meaning:

An analogy that hopefully helps:

Because a computer simulation can only be a simplified binary model of this reality, instead of saying what if this reality is a computer simulation, try thinking of it the other way around. What if a simulated consciousness could be given to a processor? Say for example, all of the hardware sensors would be represented to it as physical inputs. It would ‘feel’ power and temperature fluctuations, cooling systems going on and off… 

After a while, it would come up with all kinds of laws relative to its existence. It may come to the conclusion it’s a tool to run tasks. But to it, reality would be limited to binary. Although it may attain great knowledge about its own reality, it will never be able to understand much from the reality that encloses it (this physical reality).  It’s a mechanical limitation. 

All of the above is about a machine without a brain, it can only understand at the binary level. In contrast, this reality is perceived by human brains at base 10. If the simplification of 0-9 into 0-1 is a language, wouldn’t that indicate a greater language? And so instead of saying everything is numbers, how about numbers are the logical portion of a greater reality language? 

Could it be that what numbers can’t express, the apparent illogic in quantum, shows room must be made for what seems illogical at the moment? Like entanglements, whatever rule they follow that prevents them from being observed. This behavior translates as some form of awareness. No one can see it because there is no room for it in the (current) logic? Doesn’t that translate back as saying numbers are everything?  ",1,1763091830.0,numerology,0,1.0,False

So I have a Breville Barista Pro and after dialing in for a month, I found the parameters on how I like my coffee. I am using Red Bird Espresso, 18.5g dose, no pre-infusion, target yield at 27-28g (1:1.5 ratio) around 30 seconds. Internal Burr setting is 4 and External Setting is 6. There is little bitterness but acceptable, the nutty flavor is dominant now. 


Problem is, my machine is choking. I know that it should be a continuous flow but mine is just dripping, then flowing for a while, and then dripping again until I get my target yield. I am using the stock portafilter from Breville. This started happening when I am not doing the pre-infusion but skipping it made the shot taste a lot better (it’s very bitter when I pre-infuse).

As a warning, I am exhausted. I will try to keep this brief but I apologize if any of this is confusing or stupid. 

He is very good at independent play, checking in every few minutes to show me a toy or ask me to read a story. But I cant get anything done. 

The second I get up to go cook, clean, shower, anything, he is at my feet. He will fuss and cry and no amount of redirection or talking to him stops him. He will shove me away from the counter! 

I started incorporating screen time. Mrs rachel and sesame street. Mrs rachel helps a little, but not enough for 15 minutes to clean. I get a minute or two and then he is back at it. 

He only takes one nap a day and goes to bed at 9. I end up having to stay up until midnight most nights, just to keep up with the kitchen and living room. I am burning out, bad. I am starting to get impatient with him in the mornings, which is when I am trying to unload the dishwasher and have a cup of (pre-made because I don't get a chance to brew) coffee. 

I love him so much and I love spending time with him, but I havent had a break in months. Any moment away from him is spent cleaning, doing chores, and showering. I am a solo parent and, to be frank, was a mess before he was born. I lived in filth and having him has made me scared to go back to that. I hate myself when the house is dirty, I hate myself when I put screen time on for him and it still doesnt work, I hate myself when I get mad at my sweet boy for wanting my attention. I know I'm just doing my best, but I just constantly feel like I need to try harder and it never works. 

I try to get him involved, but it doesnt seem to work out. He cant help unload the dishwasher because he climbs on top of it and it turns into a meltdown every time. Almost all our meals involve heat or knives or raw meat, and I cant ever find a way to let him ""help"". If I even pick up his toys in front of him he goes and throws them all on the floor before I am done and meltsdown if I tell him to stop. Ive tried to make it a game but that doesnt work, either. 

Anyways, tl;dr:

My toddler hates when I cook or clean. I am burning out staying up late and using all my breaks to try and keep things in order. Desperately seeking advice on how to get things done with a clingy toddler. ",2,1763091412.0,AttachmentParenting,5,1.0,False
1owlxwm,https://www.reddit.com/r/askneurology/comments/1owlxwm/permanent_damage_from_ss/,Permanent damage from SS?,"I saw somebody post in this thread years ago regarding seratonin syndrome.

I never got diagnosed with it, but I suspect I've gotten it multiple times.

​I think what I wanted to ask is if SS can be kind of like.. permanent? Not in a way where it's constantly happening , but more in the way of any slight new seratonin entering the body brings out a ""SS attack""??

I o.ded in 2024 and it was fatal. There was a passerby that called the ambulance for me, or I would've been gone. After that O.D I've never been the same, especially mentally.

I used to be an addict, to both downers and uppers, but I never had bad reactions to either. I always had a nice calming effect within my times of addiction and use. After the O.D every slight seratonin boost sends me into overdrive and attack. 

My pupils become dilated, I become panicky and scared, very anxious and paranoid, my blood pressure sky rockets, my breathing becomes super tight and impossible to get a full breath, my vision becomes blurry or kind of like, ""LSD"" like, and i have a hard time speaking. My heart rate also becomes scary fast and feels like its beating out of my chest, and i sometimes will start wanting to pass out likely from the breathing issues.

in the past I never had anything even similar to this at all. Now, all it takes is one extra cup of coffee to send me into this.

I recently ran into this encounter again, while taking my pain medication after surgery. (Roxi) in the past its never given me issues, now I'm a day into taking them and I'm having these attacks again. Not even the hydroxizine is saving me. Propanolol does help sometimes though. 

I remember the first times I noticed these symptoms. CocaCola reaction gave me this real bad, alcohol does this to me, even prescribed medications like gabapentin. When i was younger gabapentin relaxed me and stabalized me. Now, it put me in the hospital needing to be sedated after a huge freakout. 

Hydroxizine is what I take consistently now every single day. It sucks because it still doesn't fully help the weird panicky anxiety feeling I have all the time. It's not normal anxiety, it's like my body/brain is constantly wired. Those of you who have experienced this know the feeling im talking about. ​

What avenue can i look at to fix this, if its fixable at all?​​ am I doomed forever?",1,1763091409.0,askneurology,0,1.0,False

1owlxd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductAmazon/comments/1owlxd2/insulated_food_jar_vs_thermos_whats_the_difference/,Insulated food jar vs thermos: what's the difference?,"Hey everyone! So I've been getting asked this question a lot lately, and honestly, I used to think they were basically the same thing. Turns out there are some actual differences worth knowing about if you're trying to keep your food hot or cold throughout the day.

**The Main Difference**

Here's the deal: a thermos is technically designed for liquids like coffee, soup, or tea. It's got that narrow mouth opening that makes drinking easier and keeps heat from escaping. An insulated food jar, on the other hand, has a wider mouth so you can actually fit a spoon in there and eat stuff like pasta, rice, stews, or even salads.

Both use vacuum insulation to keep temperatures stable, but the design is what really sets them apart.

**When I Use Each One**

I personally use my thermos for morning coffee and soups I can drink straight from the container. But when I'm packing lunch with actual solid food, I grab my food jar. The wide opening makes it way easier to clean too, which is a huge plus because nobody wants to deal with crusty rice stuck at the bottom.

If you're looking to upgrade your lunch game, I'd seriously recommend checking out some quality options. I've been using [these insulated food jars](https://athomewave.com/food-jar) and they've completely changed how I meal prep. They keep my food hot for like 6-7 hours, which is perfect for work or long days out.

**Temperature Retention**

Both options work great for keeping things hot or cold. The key is preheating or precooling them before use. Just pour boiling water in for a few minutes if you want hot food, or cold water if you're packing something like fruit or yogurt. Makes a massive difference.

**Which One Should You Get?**

If you mainly drink liquids throughout the day, stick with a traditional thermos. But if you're bringing actual meals, definitely go with a food jar. Some people end up having both, which honestly isn't a bad idea.

The build quality matters too. Cheaper ones don't hold temperature nearly as well, and the seals start leaking after a few months. I learned that the hard way. That's why I only recommend [solid options like these](https://athomewave.com/food-jar) now.

**Bottom Line**

Both insulated food jars and thermoses do the same basic job, but they're designed for different purposes. Think about what you're actually carrying around every day, and that'll tell you which one makes more sense for your lifestyle. Either way, having one beats eating cold lunch or spending money on takeout every single day.

1owlvjr,https://www.reddit.com/r/PinoyUnsentLetters/comments/1owlvjr/vanilla_oat_latte/,Vanilla Oat Latte,"I gotta remind myself na some people tend to not be capable of handling things well no matter how fragile it is. Even if lagyan mo pa ng extras to make it lighter, if they want to carry it with care and with peace, they would.

I ordered an Iced Vanilla Oat Latte recently. It's something na I've always wanted to try again after years of trying to control caffeine. I held myself back at first.

""Kaya ko ba 'to? Baka sobrang tapang and hindi pala ok. Sobrang risky but I've been seeing it on the menu for years and maybe this time, it's worth the try ulit.""

The first sip was so strong. It's like being high in sugar na you just want to consume forever and hope it never runs out. I was a complete person myself, but it made me feel complete-r. Diba OA? Haha.

The second sip was stronger. I was already making plans in my head. Maybe a bigger cup would be better next time. Maybe I can add another shot and maybe whipped cream on top, for sure magiging ok pa lalo.

I stared at my half-consumed cup. Hindi ko narealize na I was already halfway. I didn't listen to the barista saying na to ""take it slow"" when it was handed over to me. Sure, in the back of my head, I was already foreseeing some bad effects. I knew the caffeine withdrawal is going to be messy af. But I ignored it knowing this isn't the first time anyway. I can always go back tomorrow and order another.

I got to the last few sips not knowing they were the last. The ice cubes hit my skin. Sobrang lamig pero sige lang, it's just ice.

Pero yun na pala yun.

I asked the barista if I can get a refill in the same cup. Sabi ko pa nga na I'm willing to pay naman.

""Last order na yan, ma'am. We're closing na. It's 10pm."" He said in a very stern voice like as if he's just waiting for me to leave so they can close.

Na-off guard ako kasi he was friendly and chatty pa naman kanina. But then I thought he got to sell another cup.. so I guess his job is done. He's just doing what he intended to do. ""Ay sorry, akala ko kasi open kayo til midnight."", I responded then left.

That night, I almost pleaded but hindi na nga pala ako yun. Ang babaw pero I know this time I gotta give myself some self-respect. The right barista will not make you feel confused or give you doubts. They will not deflect things at you. They will always make time and not make you feel like you're an inconvenience. They'd work things WITH you. You wouldn't need to apologize and shedding a bit of vulnerability would be like waiting for you to decide on what croissant you'd want with your coffee and they would still take your order with a genuine smile. It's basic human decency.

The coffee was great but the service was not. Marami pang coffee shops around and I know they'd be willing to take orders anytime, baka with free 2 croissants pa nga and not just one.

I honestly wish I never did any of this but I'm kind of glad that I got the closure na I've always wanted. I can be upset, tell them very mean things, scream at them, but I won't.

The world needs more kindness than anger and they probably need it more than I do.

To you: I hope we both heal, grow, and find the things that will truly make us happy. I mean this in the kindest way possible I know how but if you ever get to see this, please don't ever reach out to me again.

1owltx5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1owltx5,Did Meghan's stealing cause issues in the BRF? Is this why many designers avoid her?,"Hey Sinners, the following post is rather long, so you might want a cup of tea/coffee your favorite beverage ☕ as you read it. x

As Tom Bower revealed in 'Revenge' Rachel Markle didn't just bully staff and act like a nightmare on the set of Reitman's she actually walked off with(stole) a pair of nude Aquazurra heels worth around $1000.

There are also other reports of Rachel stealing items from other fashion shoots such as the 2022 Variety photoshoot. Thank you to fellow sinner - Mybobblehat-and-me for posting on and drawing this fine podcast to attention (bits on Rachel stealing starts at the 3:30 point).

https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/exclusive-meghan-markle-new-stealing-allegations/id1515932214?i=1000650011747

Allegedly - the Variety photoshoot featured some extremely expensive clothing, which, after Rachel wore them many items - dresses, jewelry etc. were later found to be missing. One of the items - an aqua blue dress seems to have resurfaced recently...

In a 'Suits' interview (which I posted on recently) Rachel Markle herself indeed admitted to taking expensive items from the Suits wardrobe and later wearing them in her personal life (these are posted on Instagram). I found a burgundy/maroon dress that was likely stolen from the set of Suits. In my opinion, it is likely that these 'disappeared' items are actually the tip of the iceberg.

I was wondering about all this, and went back to some older articles about Rachel's conflict in the BRF. The articles mentioned that Rachel did not return dresses that she had been loaned by designers.

At first I think these articles flew under the radar, because there are a few issues here. Any public servant at any level - from royalty to a normal government worker, cannot and should not ever accept free gifts. This is an excellent and very important rule that helps to prevent corruption.

Another issue is, however, whether this was about much more than refusing unsolicited 'freebies' . 

Was it also about Rachel not returning or paying for designer clothing she had been expected to return? Were the loaned designer items that Rachel took or attempted to take in the BRF, were actually taken with the consent of the designers in question? Did Rachel throw a tantrum when called out for this behavior and asked to either return or pay for these items?

It appears that former Royal Aide, Camilla Toubati was true professional and very proper on following royal protocol and her insistence that Rachel return borrowed items led to a lot of tension, and as Jason Knauff alleged, Rachel mercilessly bullied Toubati to the point she quit. Harold also later bashed Toubati in his ghostwritten book 'Spare'. 

I also had a look at how common the behavior of celebrities stealing from fashion shoots is - and even in Hollywood, it does not seem very common at all. I found an article that claimed that the troubled actress Lindsay Lohan (also accused of shoplifting) claimed to have 'lost' a dress at a fashion shoot and was later seen wearing it, leading to designers and fashion houses being reluctant to work with her again. 

Is this why many designers and Fashion houses now seem to be so reluctant to work with Markle? ",46,1763091074.0,SaintMeghanMarkle,19,0.95,False

But, I feel a sort of fear whenever my coworker (fake name Serena) enters the room. Like I am holding my breath and want to become invisible. My friends say I should speak with a manager but I am scared she will find out and target me more.

I was a few months into the job and Serena asked me to bring paperwork to the other building five minutes before closing. I wanted to do a good job so I did. The guy I brought it too was her bf, and he looked at me like, ""Why are you giving me this now?"" I returned to my building, but it was locked. It was the middle of winter, I didn't have my coat or keys. I saw her drive by me, but another guy saw me and let me back in. I don't know if Serena meant for that, but I felt set up and left behind.

Another time, I was moving a car to bring back into the building. She got into my car, and I thought she was being friendly because she does this with other coworkers. She says to me, ""I know your friends with everyone here but there's a lot of shady stuff that goes on."" It was unsettling and awkward. I just laughed and said I was not surprised, and she quickly got out and went back to work.

The other day, Serena asked our newest member to stand by her desk like a personal servant. I heard she dislikes having to walk out to me and the others, and I felt mad she took advantage of a new employee. She has asked me to get coffee, bring her home and lie about it, and insulted my work ability. I am wiser now, and feel resentful making it hard to be at my best. 

I do not like conflict, but I want to stand up now for me and my coworkers. The thought of going to my manager makes me shake, and want to cry. But I feel worse now for not saying anything before.

1owlrgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1owlrgp/my_best_friend_watched_me_climb_into_the_well_hes/,My best friend watched me climb into the well. He’s the one who never came out.,"I was a socially awkward kid, the kind who ate lunch away from everyone and rarely said a word. Making friends seemed like something everyone but me could do, until I met Seth.

We were at school and I happened to hear him talking about the new game his mom bought him. It was a game I happened to be really into so I jumped into the conversation before I could talk myself out of it. We bonded over our love of the game and he invited me over. We’ve been best friends ever since.

Seth and I spent most of our summers talking about things we’d never actually do. We made big plans and never followed through. But one day, we decided we were really going to build a treehouse.

After convincing both our parents, all that was left was finding the right spot. Behind Seth’s house was a dense pine forest, so that was the obvious choice. We searched for about half an hour through the humid, sticky, air. Trees of all shapes and sizes surrounded us as the crickets and birds sang. Eventually we stumbled into a clearing.

It looked almost too perfect—a circle, maybe fifty or seventy-five feet across. Right in the center stood an old stone well, nearly swallowed by moss. The moss was reminiscent of a giant snake, slithering its way up and down the well.

The moment I saw it, I felt something shift. Not fear exactly, but a pull. Like it had been waiting for us.

“Dude, this is perfect!” he said walking up to the well as if it was another blade of grass, “We can build the tree house over there—away from the creepy stone thing.”

I wasn’t looking at the tree line though, I was still staring at the well. Seth kept rambling about treehouse ideas, but I kept drifting toward the well. As I got closer, I noticed the stone around the rim had been chiseled in a ripple pattern that spread toward the water hole.

The well was about ten feet deep before dropping off into an even darker pit. I almost missed it—but as I stared at the far wall, transfixed, I saw something. There, on a narrow ledge of dirt jutting from the inner wall, sat a single black dahlia.

“Travis, what’re you doing?” Seth’s voice broke me from the trance as I staggered backwards.

“I was just looking at this well. It’s beautiful.”

“The well is beautiful?”

“Yeah…” Seth gave a short laugh, but it didn’t sound amused.

“You’re kinda freaking me out man, are you getting enough sleep?”

“Yeah,” I said, not even sure if I snapped out of my trance. “I’m fine.” Seth walked up to me and looked at the well.

“Is there anything down there?”

“Nothing really, just a flower and water.” Seth walked closer and peeked into the hole.

“What flower?” I blinked. The flower was gone. Not fallen—gone. No trace of it on the stones below, no sign of it ever being there at all. I didn’t answer him. My eyes were still locked on the place where it had been. My skin crawled.

“Let’s just go back to your place, we can do this tomorrow. You’re not looking so good.” I nodded, still not fully looking away from the well. It felt like turning your back on something you’re not sure is real—or worse, something you were sure was.

We walked back to my house in near silence, occasionally breaking it to point out an animal or make some half-hearted comment about the woods. The summer heat was still heavy, but it was suddenly a lot less noticeable.

The trees whispered above us, branches swaying as the wind blew across them. The air felt different—not colder or thicker, but wrong. Like something had shifted in the clearing. Something I couldn’t name, let alone understand.

When we got to my place I told my mom I wasn’t feeling well. She offered me some soup and ginger ale but I declined. My room was familiar—posters on the wall, controller wires tangled together on the carpet, the ceiling fan clicking with every rotation, but I couldn’t settle.

My mind kept circling back to the well. The flower. The way it vanished, like it had never existed at all. Seth booted up Mortal Kombat and handed me a controller. I lost every match we played. I couldn’t focus, I felt anxious, like I was being watched.

That night, I dreamt of the clearing and the well. The sky was grey and dreary and the forest was covered in shadows. I looked around and saw nothing strange so I started walking towards the well. As I approached it, black, thorny vines started slithering out of the well and approaching me. I tried to run but vines came up from the ground and wrapped around my feet. I was stuck in place as the vines started to wrap around me, cutting into my flesh. Hundreds of thorns poked into me as I collapsed into a bed of vines. The vines slowly made their way up my body.

I screamed as thorns tore through my skin, sharp and endless. I thrashed and struggled but it only pushed them deeper into me. I eventually gave up, tears rolling down my face as I accepted my fate. Right before I was completely swallowed by the vines I saw something. A silhouette behind the tree line, human-like in shape. There was something off about it though. I stared at it as the vines slowly engulfed my entire body.

I jolted upright, chest heaving, heart slamming against my ribs. It took minutes to steady my breath, to remind myself I was safe. I grounded myself, counting each breath until I felt stable again. As I got out of bed I looked around my room. Nothing was out of the ordinary and there was nothing going on. I let out a sigh of relief before turning around. What I saw still haunts me. Sitting right there on the outside of my window, was a single Black Dahlia.

I opened my window, heart still pounding from the nightmare. The flower was still there. I reached out and grabbed it, my fingers brushing the petals—and I felt dizzy. My knees buckled slightly as I placed the flower on my nightstand and sat back down. I took deep breaths until the black dots faded from my vision.

When I stood again, the flower was gone. Not wilted or on the floor. Just… gone. My heart sank. Maybe I was just tired. Maybe the heat had gotten to me yesterday and now my brain was playing tricks. I told myself that over and over as I got dressed—trying to believe it. I called Seth. We agreed to hang out at his place that afternoon.

Until then, I just lay around the house, trying not to think about the well. About the flower. About the way it vanished right in front of me—again. As time passed I looked at the clock, 10:07, I sighed heavily as I waited for time to pass. It felt like maybe ten minutes had passed—but when I looked again, it was 11:02. I was confused—how had so much time passed in what felt like a moment?

As 12 o’clock approached I got my shoes on and got ready to leave. As I was about to walk out I saw my cat, King, eating out of his food bowl. I walked up to him to try to pet him but his tail raised up as he slowly backed away. He hissed repeatedly before running away incredibly fast.

I had known King since he was a kitten, he’d never hissed at me before, not even when I’d accidentally stepped on his tail. I stared down the hallway that King had vanished in, there was a shadow, a black figure that dragged something behind it as it disappeared into the darkness. I tried to shake it off and as I walked out the front door.

The sky was cold and grey when I stepped outside. By the time I crossed the street, the drizzle had turned to a downpour. Then thunder cracked, low and heavy, and rain fell in sheets. I walked into Seth’s house soaked to the bone, water dripping from my sleeves. I shivered as I climbed the stairs, only stopping to wave at his mom who was making her famous French onion soup. He laughed when I stepped into his room and tossed me a towel. “You look like you got hit by a wave,” he said.

I forced a smile as I started drying off.

“The weather hates me. What can I say?” I peeled off my coat, letting it hit the floor with a wet flop. “I think this thing’s done for.”

Seth slid further onto his bed, getting comfortable. “You’ve had that coat since, what—sixth grade? Just burn it already. Put it out of its misery.”

“I can’t. It’s sentimental.”

“Dude, it smells like that well water from yesterday.” I tried to laugh, but it came out thin. “I’m surprised mom even let you in the house looking like that.”

“She offered soup. I said no.”

“Dude. You turned down my mom’s soup? You’re actually crazy.”

“Maybe.” He raised an eyebrow.

“I don’t know. I didn’t sleep much.”

“Nightmares?”I hesitated.

“Sort of.”

“About the well that freaked you out?”

“About what was in the well.” He didn’t respond instantly. He just looked at me for a second—longer than usual—and then handed me the game controller.

“Nightmares are weird man, try not to think about it too much. What you should think about is who you’re going to play while you lose like ten times in a row.” I tried to shake it off and sat across from him while he started navigating the menu; talking about new combos he discovered.

I wasn’t really listening though, I was letting my attention wander around the room. It was all familiar—posters we’d both picked out, a bookshelf full of comics we collected, and on top sat photos of summers and birthdays gone.

One picture caught my eye. It was us—maybe ten or eleven—standing in his backyard. I remembered that day: water balloons, grilled hot dogs, the rusty old trampoline with a few broken springs. But something was off.

The background looked darker than it should’ve. The trees behind us—too many. Thicker. Tangled. And near my leg, in the bottom corner of the frame, I saw something I didn’t remember: a line of black, like vines creeping through the grass.

I leaned closer. One of the vines curled upward, almost touching my ankle. “Hey, Seth,” I said, my voice low. “When was this picture taken?”

“Uhm… I’m not sure, years ago.”

“You need to see this.” I walked over and held the frame up to his face. He took it, glanced down, then back at me.

“What’s the big deal? This looks fine.” I blinked, the vines were still there, plain as day.

“You don’t see those thorny vines?” His brow furrowed.

“What are you talking about? I don’t see anything, man. Maybe you’re just—y’know—still wound up from yesterday?”

“I’m telling you, they’re right there. You seriously can’t see those vines?” Seth hesitated for a moment.

“No. And you’re kinda freaking me out.” I opened my mouth, closed it, then stared at the frame again. The vines were still there. Crawling. Twisting. Almost reaching me. Why couldn’t he see them?

“I had a dream last night…” I said, the words fumbling out of my mouth faster than I had intended.

“The well was there. The flower. Black vines—these vines—coming out of the ground, wrapping around me. Cutting into me.” Seth stayed silent, expression on his face still as I talked. “They had sharp thorns. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe. They squeezed tighter as they moved higher up my body. And right before they covered my face-“ I looked up at him.

“There was something in the trees… watching.” Seth shifted in the bed as he spoke.

“Okay… maybe you need to just-“

“And this morning,” I interrupted. “There was a black flower sitting on my window ledge.” I held his gaze as he looked at me confused. “It disappeared. Twice.” Seth exhaled slowly while rubbing the back of his neck.

“You really didn’t sleep much last night did you?”

I didn’t respond, I just stared at the photo. The vines seemingly got longer with each glance I took.

“Maybe we shouldn’t go back there,” he added.

That’s when I stood up.

“No. We have to.”

“What?”

“I need to see it again. The well. The clearing. All of it.”

“Dude—why?”

“Because I’m not crazy,” I snapped back. “Or if I am, I need to know for sure.”Seth stood up.

“Think about what you’re saying. If the well really is what you think it is, then there’s no point in going straight to it.” I opened my mouth to argue—but nothing came out. He wasn’t wrong. Not exactly.

“So what do I do?” I asked.

“Start small,” he said. “You wanna know what it is? Then figure out where it came from first.” I looked at the photo again, the vines still twisting toward my leg. I knew what I saw.

“Fine,” I muttered. “But I’m not letting this go.” I didn’t argue. Not out loud. But even as we sat back down and the game flickered on, my thoughts kept circling. The dream. The flower. The vines crawling into that photograph like they belonged there.

Seth couldn’t see them—but I could. And I didn’t care if it meant I was losing it. I had to know why. I left an hour later, walking home under the dull gray sky, the wind pushing dead leaves into the street. The clearing was off-limits—for now—but maybe there was another way to get answers.

When I got home I opened my laptop, typed “old stone well Pinewood Forest,” and hit enter. And there it was—on the first page: “The Mouth of Dahlia—Urban Legends and Vanishing Boys.” I stared at the blue website name—scared to click on it. The page loaded slowly. It looked like a blog—basic white background, outdated fonts, barely readable. The article was dated 2009.

“Hidden deep in ——— sits a moss-covered well known to some locals as ‘The Mouth of Dahlia.’” It talked about disappearances—three boys in the ‘40s, a hiking group in ‘78, another kid in the ‘90s. No bodies. No signs. Just a black flower found near where they vanished. I kept scrolling.

“Some believe the well isn’t a structure but a living thing—a mouth that feeds on people. A boundary between our world and something older. Others claim the well to be a portal to hell or an otherworldly plane.” My stomach turned. A figure in the trees. Dreams. The flower. “The flower doesn’t grow naturally in this region. But it keeps appearing. Those who see it—never forget.”

I sat back in my chair, hands clammy. I wasn’t crazy or delusional, I was being hunted. It wasn’t just a nightmare anymore. I had seen that flower, and now I knew its name.

I couldn’t sleep that night. I kept seeing the flower every time I closed my eyes. By morning, I’d memorized the article. But it wasn’t enough. I needed something older. Something real. The local library opened at 10:00. I was waiting outside by 9:45.

I was at the library when the doors opened. No sleep. No appetite. Just a buzzing need to know. The reference section smelled like dust and forgotten things. The librarian barely looked up when I asked about Pinewood’s history—just pointed toward a shelf marked “Local Archives.” Most of the books looked untouched. Brown covers, warped spines, handwritten call numbers in faded ink. I scanned titles until one caught my eye:

“Structures of Significance: Settlements and Monuments of Pinewood County.” I pulled it down and flipped through yellowing pages until I found a section labeled: The Dahlia Well

“Constructed in 1885 by Harold, a local stoneworker, the well was originally intended to supply water to the southern edge of what was then known as Millet Farm. It was named after his wife, Dahlia, whose favorite flower inspired both the name and the carved vine motifs still visible on the structure today.” I paused. Vines.

“According to local accounts, Dahlia died under unclear circumstances shortly after the well was completed.”

“After her death, strange reports began circulating—missing animals, inexplicable dreams, and sightings of a ‘woman in black’ near the forest’s edge. Though never confirmed, these incidents led some to believe Dahlia’s spirit had become bound to the well, either by grief, or by something darker.” There was no conclusion. No resolution. Just a final line: “While skeptics dismiss these tales as rural superstition, the well has remained a source of quiet fascination—and quiet fear—for over a century.”

I closed the book slowly, my fingers tight around the cover. The carving. The dreams. The flower. Maybe it was just a story. But maybe she was still there.

I walked out of the library in the hot hours of the afternoon. The clouds parting and sun shining reminding me of what life was like before the well. I should have felt comforted by the warmth. But I didn’t.

The air felt too bright, like the world had overcorrected. Everything was golden and gleaming—too clean, too alive. I blinked into the sunlight, and for a second I felt like I was looking at something I didn’t belong in anymore.

People walked past me without noticing, laughing, talking, chewing on the ends of iced coffee straws and complaining about the heat. I wondered if they’d ever seen the flower—if they’d remember that they had. Or maybe I was the only person to feel this way.

I didn’t go home. I walked—no direction in mind. I passed a broken streetlamp with a vine coiled around it. One of the leaves looked… different. Almost shaped like a mouth. I stopped walking. I took a photo. Zoomed in. It was just a leaf. But no—was it?

When I got home I laid everything out. Notes, print-outs, hand-drawn maps I had made. I circled the location of the well, my house, and the street lamp. I drew a line—and then another. The intersections didn’t mean anything yet, but something in my bones said they would. I stood back. looked at the angles. Measured distances with a ruler I hadn’t touched in forever.

The paper didn’t give answers, but it started to hum. Not literally. Not out loud. Just beneath the surface of the silence, like the house itself was listening. That’s when I remembered the archive box.

Last week, tucked in a back room of the library, there had been a stack of unlabeled cartons—donated by the First Presbyterian Church when they’d cleared out their basement. Most were full of hymns and yellowed bulletins. But one had older material.

Parish logs, burial certificates, handwritten sermon notes. I’d flipped through it without care. It wasn’t catalogued. Not even alphabetized. I’d only opened it because the box was broken and sagging at the corners.

There’d been a letter inside, folded between two brittle sheets of cemetery records. I don’t remember reading the whole thing at the time—just the date, the name of the author, and the strange scrawl of handwriting like he’d written it with a broken nail. I only brought it home because it looked out of place. An instinct. Or maybe the well had already started nudging. Now it was on the table, waiting. I unfolded the page, and read the letter in full for the first time.

14 August, 1872

Rectory of St. Bellamy's Parish

Crook’s Hollow, County Wexford

To whomever should, by Providence or misfortune, come upon this missive— I write not as a man of sound standing, but as one…

…by knowledge that ought never have been touched. I have seen a thing which the earth has no name for. The villagers speak of a woman. They say her spirit lingers in the old well—that her sorrow poisons the ground, that she hungers for company. I have heard the tales, and I tell you now: they are wrong. The well is not haunted. It is—

…I have stood upon its stones and felt a warmth rise that is not the sun’s doing. I have looked into its depths and dreamed things I do not believe were ever mine to dream. Prayers spoken near it echo strangely, as though some other mouth repeats them with a voice just slightly…

…behind my own. It listens. I have seen vines grow in spirals that mimic the shapes I later found—

I am watched. I am used. I have tried all rites known to me. Salt, fire, the blessing of the ground, the breaking of stone. It returns. It always returns.

…I dare not speak of this to the bishop. Let them think me mad. Perhaps I am. But if you are reading this—if this letter still breathes in your hands—then it is not yet satisfied. It waits. Do not trace its paths. Do not name it. And above all—

Fr. Elias

I read the letter once. Then again. Then again. I tried not to assign meaning to the parts I couldn’t read, but that only made them louder. I filled in gaps with instinct, with memory, with my own thoughts. I didn’t write anything down, but I started repeating certain phrases in my head, over and over: It is not haunted. It listens. Do not name it.

At first I told myself it was historical context—just context, that’s all. But I knew better. I felt better. This wasn't a coincidence. This wasn’t superstition. The priest had seen the vines too. He’d felt that same wrong warmth. He’d drawn something, or dreamed something, or spoken words that didn’t sound like his own.

And now he’s gone. Just a cracked letter, buried in the wrong box, misfiled in the basement of a library where no one ever looked. I laid it out beside my maps. The ones I’d drawn. I looked at the spirals again. I didn’t remember drawing them either—not consciously—but there they were, repeating across three separate pages. The lines converged near the well, but more than that… they grew. Each time, the spirals were longer. Thicker. As if they were spreading.

I pulled the light closer and started sketching again. Carefully. No ruler, no measuring. Just my hand. It felt natural. Almost like copying.

When I blinked, it was almost dark. I hadn’t eaten. My phone buzzed—four unread texts, missed call, low battery. I didn’t answer. I barely registered the names. Instead, I turned the priest’s letter over. Nothing written. But the paper was warped, stained in one corner like it had been held too tightly in a damp palm. I touched the spot. Cold.

That night, I dreamt of the well. But not like before—not a memory. Not something I could rationalize later as a reconstruction. The dream was inside the well. There was no light, no ground, no sky. Just slow movement, like being suspended in something thick, something not water. Something that labored up and down in a near perfect rhythm. Then, a voice—not loud, not sharp. A whisper, just near the edge of my ear, as though it were spoken from within me.

“It’s waiting for you.”

The morning after the dream, I found a crack in the living room wall. It started near the ceiling and curved downward—not jagged, not haphazard. It curled. A wide, deliberate arc, looping once like something hand-drawn. Like something I’d drawn. I didn’t touch it. I didn’t even go near it. Just stared at the shape for a while, half expecting it to keep growing right in front of me. When I blinked and looked again, it was just a crack. Drywall split from heat or pressure or old age. But I could swear it hadn’t been there the day before. I could swear it was growing.

I got a pencil and sketched the shape in my notebook. That was the first entry. By the end of the week, I had filled four pages with notes. Strange sights, small sounds, shapes that reappeared in places they didn’t belong.

There was a vine outside the bathroom window, coiled in the same spiral I’d drawn on one of the maps. Dust gathered in the corner of the kitchen that looked—if I stared too long—like the shape of a mouth.

A floorboard near the hallway seemed to pulse, just slightly, like something was breathing under it. Sometimes I felt it at night when I walked barefoot to the kitchen. The house began creaking at odd hours, but never the usual kind—this wasn’t the random shift of old wood in heat. This was rhythmic. Intentional. Like footsteps or a slow drag of something heavy just beneath the floor.

I started writing down everything. Not because I thought it would help me understand, but because I was afraid that if I didn’t, I’d start forgetting what was real. Some nights I’d wake up not knowing if the dream had ended. Other times I’d be completely awake and hear things I couldn’t place. Low, scraping sounds like something was clawing at the pipes.

The voice came back too. Always in dreams at first. A woman’s voice—soft, urgent, whispering close enough that I felt the warmth of breath on the back of my neck. She said things like “deeper,” or “closer,” or “you’ve already seen it.” She never shouted. She never begged. Just said those things again and again until I woke up soaked in sweat, heart pounding, unsure whether I’d screamed.

Eventually, I stopped trying to sleep. The cracks were in every room now. Most were small, just hairline fractures, but some had started curling into distinct shapes. Spirals, mostly.

I measured a few of them and compared them to the ones I’d drawn in my earliest sketches. They matched exactly—same size, same curve, even the same direction. That shouldn’t have been possible. I hadn’t used a compass or ruler for any of them. They were just instinctive drawings. But something about them was being mirrored in the house itself.

Sometimes I could hear the voice during the day too, not just in dreams. Whispered just low enough that I couldn’t catch every word. I wrote those down too. Sometimes just fragments: “It’s hungry,” “We remember,” “You’re close,” “He failed,” and once, just once, “Don’t leave.”

One night while going through the pages again, I remembered something from the archive box. Buried beneath the priest’s letter and the church logs, there had been a bundle of handwritten sermon drafts—most of them incomprehensible—but one of them had a different handwriting and included diagrams.

Badly drawn circles, strange patterns, and Latin phrases scribbled in the margins. At the time I’d dismissed it as nonsense, but now I found myself digging through the pile to find it again. And when I did, I realized it wasn’t just a sermon. It was something else.

The handwriting matched the priest’s signature from the letter—Fr. Elias Grange. A final note from him, possibly unfinished. One page near the end had been marked with a faint ink circle and the words “Counter-Circle” underlined three times.

There were references to a ritual—elements of protection, maybe. It wasn’t clear. The Latin was fragmented, and the diagrams seemed incomplete. But I pieced together enough to try it.

I waited until night. Cleared the living room, pushed the furniture to the edges, and chalked the rough shape of the circle onto the floor. I placed salt where the lines met, as best I could make sense of it. I read the incantation aloud, quietly at first, then louder. My voice cracked during the third repetition. By the end of it, my vision had gone blurry and my hands were shaking. I felt like I was on the verge of throwing up.

But then—nothing happened. The room stayed still. No whispers. No cracking walls. No strange movements in the shadows. I sat there for hours, waiting for something to shift. Nothing did. It was the first quiet I’d experienced in days. That night I slept straight through. No dreams. No voice. Just sleep.

The next morning I found blood in the bathroom sink. It was faint—almost diluted—but real. I checked myself over. No cuts. No dried blood in my mouth. The drain wasn’t rusted. It wasn’t some old residue. It was fresh. I turned the tap on and watched it swirl down.

When I stepped outside, I noticed something I hadn’t before. Every house on the street—every single one—had a vine growing near the base. Most people probably wouldn’t have noticed it. Just one thin strand curling around a pipe or sprouting from a crack in the driveway. But I looked closer. They all curved the same way. All spiraled in the same direction.

I opened my notebook and flipped back through the pages. My earliest maps had started warping. The ink was thicker now. The spirals are darker, fuller. The paper almost felt damp in some places, like the lines were still alive. Still growing. Even the ones I hadn’t touched were changing, reshaping themselves slightly when I looked away. The lines were converging on something. A center point I already knew. The priest’s letter said it always returns. He tried fire, salt, and prayer. All of it failed. His letter had survived. But he hadn’t.

That evening, while I sat at the kitchen table, I heard the voice again. This time I was fully awake. It didn’t come from a dream, and it wasn’t outside. It was in the room with me, just behind my ear. No warmth this time. No breath.

“Why would you do that?” Then silence.

But I could feel something beneath the house. Something scraping from underneath the floor boards. It wasn’t scraping the flooring though—the sound was coming from deeper in the earth. It sounded like grinding. Like two pieces of iron scraping against each other.

I packed a bag. The letter. My notes. A flashlight. A map. I took matches. A knife. A jar of salt. I don’t know what I thought I’d need. But I knew staying here was no longer an option. The lines were crawling toward me now, not outward. Inward. Always toward where I stood. The spirals in my drawings had started looping into themselves like they were folding reality.

The well had been whispering. Now it was listening. And whatever was at the bottom was finally awake. I was going back. I had to. Not to stop it. I don’t know if that’s even possible. But I had to see it. I had to know what it wanted. Because I think it’s always known what I am. And it’s been waiting.

By the time I left the house and followed the path back toward the clearing, I could feel the air thickening like a fever pressing against my skin. Every branch seemed bent in slight curves, the fallen needles arranged in arcs I hadn’t noticed before, as though the forest itself had been folding itself into spirals while no one was watching.

My eyes refused to stay still; whenever I focused on one tree, the others seemed to bow inward, their shadows stretching like grasping fingers. Somewhere behind me, low and almost swallowed by the wind, came the faint sound of my own breath repeating a half-beat later, too late to be an echo.

When I broke through the pines, the clearing felt wrong—emptier than it had any right to be—but Seth was already standing there near the well, his hands shoved deep into his pockets, his shoulders set like stone. He’d been waiting.

He didn’t shout at me. He didn’t even greet me. He just said my name flatly, like the word itself was a sentence, and I realized he knew. He must have seen the way I carried myself, the duffel strap biting into my shoulder, the way I avoided looking at the stones ringing the mouth.

“You’re not done with this,” he said, and there was a tired fury in his voice that told me he had rehearsed this confrontation, maybe pacing his house the night before, maybe staring into the mirror trying to find the words.

I told him everything. I don’t even know why, except that I was too far gone to stop myself. I told him about the spirals, the voices, the thing beneath the well that listened when I thought too hard, the dreams of the woman’s whisper curling behind my ear. I confessed it all with the kind of certainty you only hear in lunatics and prophets.

Seth stood with his jaw locked, shaking his head every few sentences like he was trying to keep his footing on ground that wouldn’t stop shifting. He didn’t believe me. He told me it was stress, sleep deprivation, that I had always been obsessive and this was just another spiral of my own making. But when I asked him if he’d seen the cracks in the trees, if he’d noticed the way the clearing bent around the well, he went silent too long, and I knew he had.

I begged him for help. I told him I couldn’t do it alone, that I needed rope, that I needed someone at the surface to anchor me. He swore at me under his breath, called me insane, and said this was going to end in an accident that would ruin us both.

But when I started toward the well without waiting for him, he grabbed my shoulder hard enough to leave a bruise and said fine, fine, but we do this my way. We went back to his house and gathered rope, an old coil he used for deer blinds, still smelling faintly of mildew and pine sap.

Neither of us spoke much on the walk back; the trees seemed to lean closer, the wind still carrying that faint offbeat echo of my breathing. When we returned to the clearing, Seth tested the rope, knotting it against the trunk of a pine, tugging it twice as if to reassure himself this was still just physical, just real.

He looped the other end around my waist with a grim efficiency, his face pale but determined. Then he braced himself by the stone lip and said, “Go. But if you tug twice, I’m pulling you up, whether you like it or not.” I nodded, though I already knew there would be no pulling me back once I saw what lay beneath.

I lowered myself into the well slowly, the stones cold and slick under my palms, the rope creaking faintly with each shift of weight. The circle of daylight above shrank too quickly, and the air carried with it the stench of wet copper, the rot of something animal left in the humid heat.

I could feel it breathing down there, though no air stirred. My hands began to tremble as my boots slid against the wall, not stone anymore but something softer, with just enough give to make me recoil. I told myself it was moss, just moss. But when I pressed too hard, the wall quivered, and a thin tremor rippled through the shaft as though the well itself had flinched.

The rope hissed against the stone lip above as I went lower, my fingers slick now with whatever clung to the walls. It wasn’t moss. The texture was wrong—too warm, too pliant, like wet skin stretched thin over bone. When I brushed against it with my knuckles, it flexed away and then settled back, pulsing faintly as though veins carried something through it in waves.

Seth’s voice drifted down from above, asking if I was all right, but it sounded muffled, like he was speaking through cloth, and I couldn’t bring myself to answer. The stench grew thicker the deeper I went, acrid and sweet, the reek of spoiled meat undercut with something medicinal, like iodine. Each breath coated my throat until I could almost taste iron on my tongue.

The shaft widened slightly, and the daylight above seemed farther away than it should have been, a distant white coin dissolving into shadow. I steadied myself on the wall, but when my palm flattened against it, the surface was no longer just damp—it was slick, with a mucous sheen that smeared across my skin in strands.

I almost let go of the rope when something shifted under my hand, a slow ripple moving outward from where I touched, as if the well’s insides were listening. The silence below was total, so heavy I could hear my own pulse in my ears, but threaded through it came a faint susurrus, not wind, not water, but whispering too low to separate into words.

I made the mistake of looking down. The dark was alive with faint glimmers, tiny reflective surfaces like wet eyes catching what little light bled from above. They were embedded in the walls, opening and closing as though they were lids, twitching in the rhythm of breath.

For a moment I couldn’t move, my body locked in place between the rope’s pull above and the living shaft below. That’s when I felt the first brush against my ankle, light as spider silk. I jerked upward, banging my elbow against the stone, but the touch didn’t stop. It was followed by another, and then another, until strands like roots or tendrils were questing upward out of the black, curling around my boots, tasting at the hem of my jeans.

I shouted, finally, wordless and strangled, and Seth hauled on the rope from above, his voice echoing down sharp and panicked. I scrambled upward, trying to kick free, but the tendrils were stronger than they looked. They wound tighter, dragging at my legs, their texture not plant-like at all but more like cords of muscle slicked with bile.

I clawed at them, ripping one free only to feel another coil higher, tightening around my calf. The rope strained under the sudden jerks of Seth pulling, each heave wrenching me upward a foot at a time, but the things were climbing faster. They didn’t want me alone.

Then the rope above lurched, slackened, and screamed against the stone. I twisted to look, heart clamping in my chest, and saw Seth’s silhouette at the rim, his body bent forward as he braced himself. Something had reached him. One of the black tendrils, thick as a wrist, had whipped out from the well’s edge and lashed around his arm.

His shout cracked the silence as he tried to wrench free, but three more followed, snapping around his shoulders, his chest, his throat. He dropped the rope and clawed at them, but they dragged him forward with impossible force. I saw his hands scrabble at the stone lip, nails tearing bloody grooves as he was yanked downward into the dark. His scream lasted only until the tendrils pulled him past the opening, and then it cut off, swallowed whole.

The last thing I felt before the rope jerked me upward again was the slack where his strength had been, replaced by a shudder from the well itself, a tremor that rattled through the living walls and into my bones. I climbed blindly, sobbing, slipping on the slick surface, hauling myself hand over hand with raw palms until the circle of daylight grew larger. When I finally rolled over the lip onto the dirt, gasping, the clearing was silent. The rope lay coiled uselessly beside me, twitching once as though something below had given it a final tug.

I don’t remember how long I lay on the ground beside the well, my chest heaving and my face wet with tears I didn’t even feel coming. The clearing swayed around me, every tree leaning closer as though to look at what had been taken, and I clawed at the dirt like an upset toddler, whispering Seth’s name until my throat tore raw.

At some point instinct drove me stumbling into the woods, my hands cut and tore open as I bumbled through miles of sharp branches and pinecones, my legs giving out every few yards until I crawled through pine needles and mud. I could still feel the rope around my waist, slick with the filth of the shaft, and I tore it off, hurling it into the underbrush as if distance could undo what had happened. I don’t remember finding my way home, only that I woke in my bed the next morning with my mother’s voice calling the police because Seth hadn’t come home.

The search lasted days. Flashlights swept the woods at night, dogs bayed and strained at their leashes, and the well stood quietly among the pines, rope still tied neat to the trunk where Seth had anchored it. I stood beside the officers as they peered down into the dark, my heart pounding so hard I thought it would echo into the shaft and wake whatever was listening.

They lowered lights, even a camera on a cable, but the footage showed only slick walls and dripping stone. No flesh, no eyes, no tendrils. They found no trace of Seth, no blood, no torn clothing, nothing. I gave my statement—how we had gone walking, how Seth had gone ahead, how I had turned and he was gone.

They asked me if he’d been drinking, if he’d seemed tired. I told them he had slipped. I told them he had fallen into the well.

They lowered more rope, shouting his name into the black, but it returned nothing but hollow echoes. In the end they wrote it up as an accident, a tragic misstep in the dark woods, the kind of story you tell yourself to sleep at night.

His family never forgave me. My own mother stopped meeting my eyes at the dinner table, as if she knew I was keeping something back but couldn’t bear to ask. The town whispered. I carried the weight in silence, night after night, until even my dreams grew too heavy to bear.

Now I am twenty-five. Eight years have passed since that night, and I am writing this because I can no longer pretend. I’ve lived with the guilt until it hollowed me out, until I see Seth’s hands clawing at the stone every time I close my eyes. I know the well is still there, patient and breathing, and I know it is not done with me.",4,1763090873.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1owliwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1owliwd/i_met_a_kid_on_my_delivery_route_today/,I met a kid on my delivery route today,"I was driving 45mph down a busy main road, busy as it can get in the sticks, at least. Fast enough to hinder my eyesight. 

Gravel driveways veiled in overgrowth revealed themselves as quick as they vanished. Way too thin for a truck built to haul furniture and refrigerators to traverse through.

I found the address, albeit a little too late; I got honked at as I slammed the brakes. The driveway only had a few feet of leeway before I would’ve slammed into their shabby wooden barrier of a gate. 

An ‘I don’t call 911’ sign, rustier than the Titanic, was nailed to a tree. It portrayed a cartoon barrel that aimed right at me in the driver's seat.

It’s always good practice to observe someone's property before stepping foot on it, especially as a delivery driver. Houses out here can be weird. Most people don’t choose to live in isolation; their bank accounts do. I can’t blame someone for wanting to buy a house for a quarter of the price you’d spend in the suburbs. 

But they’re not the weird ones. It’s the folks that choose to live out here; ones that crave a silent secluded life. 

But it was a sign on the gate that threw me off guard. 

‘Keep gate closed at all times.’

Usually this sign is accompanied by neighboring warnings of a dog’s presence, or my delivery app notifying me of dogs on the property. Yeah, basically just big scary dogs. 

But there was none of that. Just keep the gate closed. Be wary of the customer. I nabbed the cardboard box from a shelf in the van. A few pounds of metal clanged around inside. 

Standing in front of the gate, my van's engine idling behind me, I considered the sign once more.

I could see the house from here. It wasn’t entirely in shambles. The roof was intact and so were its walls. A clutter of bikes, plastic children’s structures, and cardboard littered the front yard in masses of dunes, a no-man's land of toys likely to remain untouched in the coming months. 

But the customer requested a garage delivery—roughly a dozen yards away. I’d be in and out in no time.

So I opened the gate, lifting its latch and applying a slight push as it creeped open, halting as it casted itself among the shrubbery. I took my first steps onto the property as I passed through the threshold between barreling traffic and a stranger's home.

The garage grew closer with each step, but I couldn’t get the gate out of my mind. I stopped—looked behind me. Still open, still the same as it was.

Nothing entering and nothing leaving, except for me.

I turned to face the garage again. Something moved rapidly in the corner of my vision. I think it was the front door. Had it just closed? I hadn’t heard anything. I leaned over for a better view of the home's front porch. Nothing suspicious amongst the mountain of empty boxes. 

‘Snap out of it. You have a few hundred packages to deliver today. Hurry it up.’

I treaded across the gravel toward the garage. Where a car should be was instead used for storage. Shelves overflowed with piles of dust coated junk so thick it was as if the garage connected to a dark void instead of a house.

Three steps in, place the package down, three steps out. Not much to it. Except I felt like a jungle explorer, ducking under a ripped pool noodle and frayed rope hanging from the top shelf instead of vines and snakes. Hell, there might’ve been a snake in there. I wouldn’t have been able to tell.

Except instead of slithering, I heard rapid footsteps crunching through the dead grass of the front yard.

I pivoted away from the garage and faced toward my van. The last thing I needed was a crazed customer who forgot they ordered a package mistaking me for a burglar. But that’s not what I saw. My heart dropped.

A little boy, thin and wearing dirt coated rags that barely functioned as proper clothing, ran straight for the gate.

I didn’t want to think about what would happen if that kid bolted into the street, but the thoughts forced their way into my head anyways.

“Hey!” I yelled at him with my adult voice.

He stopped inches from the gate, turning to face me with an expression of aloofness and determination as if I had just thrown a wrench in his plan. He cradled his iPad, shattered and falling apart, close to his chest. 

My heart raced. I considered the worst; what if he runs past the gate out into the street, what if I get fired for handling someone else’s child to prevent them from running? Where the hell are his parents? But the child turned, dumbfounded at my van parked just inches away. I used the opportunity to walk by him and shut the gate, the package still in my hands.

“Go back inside. I don’t think your parents want you out here.” I tell him as the gate locks.

His eyes lock onto mine. His pupils dilated, his breaths rising and falling at the pace of a hummingbird's wings.  A shrill cry bellows from the boy as if I had committed the ultimate betrayal. I panic again. Do I just go? I’m on the clock. But something feels off. This doesn’t feel right. God, where the hell are his parents?

I get in the van and stare at my work phone. A moment later and I’m on a call with dispatch.

“Dispatch.” A voice blares through gunk stuffed phone speakers.

“I’m out in the country a bit aways from the station and I’m delivering to a house…” I respond, trying my best to explain whatever the hell is going on.

“Yes. And?”

“Well this kid ran out of the house as I was making the delivery. He looks in rough shape. I thought he was gonna sprint right into traffic. I don’t see his parents anywhere.”

My dispatcher takes a moment before responding.

“You wanna call the police?”

“I don’t know.  This just feels off.”

“You’re in the boonies. Everything is off.”

It’s getting darker out, I can tell he’d prefer it if I'd finish my route and return to the station without an incident report to file. But this was more important than some desk-jockey’s feelings or this multibillion dollar company; they could afford a few packages returning tonight.

I glance up at the boy through my windshield. He’s fiddling with the latch but can’t quite figure it out.

“Alright, can I at least check if his parents are home?” I ask. 

“...Fine. But keep it off the record if everything’s okay.”

Good enough for me. I hang up the phone and hop out the van.

The boy backs away from the gate, twitching giddily.

“No, you’re not leaving, buddy. Just checking in with your mom and dad.” I tell him as I open the gate.

I block the open space with my wingspan before closing it this time, but he doesn’t attempt a grand escape. Instead, stiffly skips toward the front door as I follow close behind. I knocked a few times on its splintered white surface. No answer.

The boy looks up at me. I get a real good look at his face. Specks of dirt coat his cheeks, very visible in contrast with his bright eyes and pale face.

“Mommy’s stuck in the mask again.”

 I knock once more, ignoring the ramblings of someone else's child.

“Hello? Your kid’s out here!” Still no answer.

But the young boy must’ve lost his patience, because he shoved me aside and opened the unlocked door.

I was immediately hit with a waft of something I had never smelt before. Something so pungent–so tangible of a scent. It was like shit and… God like rotten fruit and spoiled chicken had a gang bang and decided to have aftercare in a tub of fish guts. I don’t even think that half describes how putrid this smell was. And this kid was living in it.

I recoiled at the scented onslaught. That offensive and decaying smell filled my nostrils. I hadn’t even had a proper look inside yet I was too scared to venture further. But I looked up through the door and there he was, skipping through like he was in a field of flowers.

I had to fight it. Block it out. See what’s going on. This poor kid. God, the smell.

I open the door wider in a weak attempt to air out the building, tucking my shirt over my nose as I set foot on a mushy carpet. The walls were coated in a yellow wax that tangoed with clumps of black mold. Ash trays stacked like the leaning tower of pizza atop a coffee table. 

Takeout boxes and unwashed dishware blanketed a couch; its color I can’t describe as it was hidden beneath the trash, serving as a home for flies and their maggots. The television, sitting upon stacked books and magazines, blared the local news. The only illumination in the house since daylight couldn’t penetrate the grime covered windows.

I was in a living room.

It took a lot of focus to avoid stepping on trash as I followed the boy deeper into the house. He waltzed through the landmines of clutter as if it had been there his whole life. The air felt thicker on my face the deeper into the home I went.

A flash of light from the room ahead. I watched the boy as he stood on his tiptoes under the hazy refrigerator light, which revealed the unkept disarray of the kitchen as it swept over piles of dirty dishes and cooked meals left to rot on countertops. 

His torso leaned into the fridge as he rummaged around. Plastic containers of lunch meat, now grey with age, clatter on the floor. He took a jar of pickles, wiping used silverware and greasy baking trays off the counter before setting it down and glancing in my direction with a finger in his ear.

“Mommy needs dinner.”

Something was so very wrong.

“Okay, I’ll open it for you, but then I need to call someone.”

I stumbled over to the counter and tossed the package aside. It landed softly on a clump of plastic and paper glued together with who knows what. Grasping the large jar with both hands, I went to work on the lid while keeping an eye on the boy who glanced around agitated. Hopefully this would keep him still.

An eerie moan from somewhere in the house. I stop, look around. The boy clenched his jaw. His chest heaved faster. He dove for the package, disappearing behind a vortex of scraps launched into the air.

I wanted to react, but the kid set me up. I set the jar back on the counter but he far surpassed the range of my grip before I could even think about reaching for him.

As the newspapers and plastic wrappers settled, the boy turned a corner and ran down nearby steps like his life depended on it. I made the mistake of following him. 

The basement was near pitch black. How that kid managed to climb down those steps without falling baffles me. But I wasn’t thinking that at the time. To be honest, I had only two things on my mind: Get the child to safety and ignore that horrible smell.

Those issues only worsened with each descending step.

Maybe their sewage is backed up.

How long has this boy lived here?

I don’t know if I can stomach this anymore.

I need to get him out.

What the hell could be down here.

Again, that choked moaning. Louder this time.

And as I reached the final step, a lightbulb flickered to life. 

The boy stood there, box in hand, dangling string connected to a ceiling bulb in the other. His little footprints embedded in a thin sheet of gunk from the stairs to the middle of the room.

And past him, across the room, through the basement dust and murkiness which devoured what morsels of dim light there was to be offered, was a person. At least what I could make out as one from behind

A woman sat in a wooden chair. Her head leaned back as if she were asleep. A clear mask with a tube running from her mouth lay across her face. A CPAP machine rested on the floor beside her. The source of those restless groans, which echoed throughout the home and were now amplified by these basement walls. 

The top of her scalp had lost most of its hair, leaving only clumps of strands that protruded from her shriveled grey skin. And there was something on her face. Big and bulky. Sleek, like a device. 

The boy sat on the armrest of her chair and worked at tearing apart the box I had delivered as I took a closer look at the woman, circling her to get a better view of her face.

It was a corpse. Had been for a long time. She was wearing a virtual reality headset. From her, a curled groan erupted as air was forced down her throat and involuntarily expelled from her lungs

Metal clanged in the boy's hands as the cardboard wilted on the floor. Nitrous oxide canisters. He went to work releasing their contents into the machine that filled his mother’s lungs.

The very thing I delivered to this house–this boy…

I sprinted up those stairs as fast as I could, bolted through the kitchen with disregard for dishware that toppled over and sent spores dancing amongst the floor, raced past the well dressed anchorman on the tv who was selfishly unaware of where his likeness was being broadcasted,  and plummeted onto the front lawn. 

I was out of the house, but the smell lingered. It still does. The sun was setting.

My phone rang. I reached into my pocket and sat up, staring back into the living room where the boy now stood, staring back. I held the phone to my ear.

“You aren’t kidnapped or murdered, right?” Dispatch asked.

“No… I’m okay.”

My mind was clouded. I just needed to push through. Get on with the job.

“Did you fix things up with that boy and his parents?”

The TV’s light flashed upon the boy, his jittery movements were halted, his breathing slowed. It was time to go.

“His mom came out and took him in.” I said.

“So you’re good to return to your route?” They asked stubbornly.

“Yeah, I’m getting back in the van now.”

“Good. Keep delivering. See you back soon.”

The boy and I shared a moment of silence once more before I shut the front door and walked back to my van.

‘Keep gate closed at all times.’

It’s burned into my head. 

I didn’t even consider calling the police until now. I don’t even remember the address. I just wanted to get out of there.

**CHAPTER TWO**

**I become a magnet for troublesome things**

 

Aunt Odette offered to drive me to school the next day, and I readily agreed, not just because I would get to ride shotgun in her slick, white *Camaro*, but also because a plumbing mishap meant I was late, and skipping the subway would shave off a lot of time.

The ride to Brooklyn Science Academy was a quiet one. Aunt Odette seemed distracted, glancing at me only occasionally while she navigated the streets of Bay Ridge.

I knew why, of course. I’d caught snippets of the call she had over breakfast. Something about a serial assault case her team was working on alongside Brooklyn PD; the cops found a homeless man in an abandoned building along Shore Road who’d been so badly beaten he was now in a coma, and they weren’t sure if he’d wake up.

“That’s near where Brook-Sci kids hang out,” she’d said, right before remembering she had a Brook-Sci kid hanging around her kitchen.

She’d retreated upstairs to her home office to finish the call, though I’d heard enough to wonder if my new school had a violent gang problem.

Anyway, I didn’t mind the quiet drive. It gave me space to take in our part of Brooklyn through the window. Bay Ridge was a gentrified neighborhood with big houses, bustling sidewalks, and a rhythm that felt so different from L.A.’s more laid-back beats. It was all unfamiliar, chaotic in a way that made my pulse quicken.

“You’ll do fine,” Aunt Odette said, breaking the quiet. “Brooklyn might feel big now, but it’ll get smaller once you find your way.”

“Okay…”

“Also, remember last night,” Aunt Odette’s voice turned hesitant, “when you said you were fine…”

“Subtly hinting that I didn’t want to talk about it?” I replied, mild sarcasm coloring my voice.

I should’ve mentioned that Aunt Odette’s Camaro smelled like stale coffee and determination—and it was the determination part I was worried about. Bay Ridge’s streets were a blur of cars and concrete, and the silence hung between us so heavily it made me want to crack my window open.

“Look, Ollie,” she said, voice softening. “The judge may have ruled against you, but he admitted it was an act of self-defense, though also pointing out that you’re the fool who walked into a dangerous situation on your own.”

I stared out the window, my gaze fixed on nothing.

“It wasn’t self-defense,” I muttered, the words a raw, honest confession. “I had a choice. My friend was about to be…” I bit my lip, unable to express in a sentence what I’d nearly seen happen. “Evil triumphs only when good people do nothing…”

No way she wouldn’t know the line. It was her big brother’s favorite catchphrase.

“Ollie…”

I tensed, worried I’d just mistakenly given her permission to talk about our shared trauma, the one we’d both buried so deep three therapists couldn’t get it out of me. Luckily, today’s impromptu therapy session was out of time.

As we pulled up to the campus on 83^(rd) and Shore, towering brick walls and sprawling courtyards came into view. It was imposing, almost fortress-like, and the sight made my nerves spike.

“We could just hang out at a mall and catch up some more?”

“You’re not skipping on your first day, kiddo.”

I had to try.

Brooklyn Science Academy was huge. So huge, in fact, that it had its own campus drive that had us cutting through fresh-cut lawns, tennis courts, and an honest-to-God pond that was large enough to be excessive.

Aunt Odette drove me right up to the main building’s entrance, and that’s when she turned to me with an encouraging smile.

“It’s a fresh start, right?”

“Right.” I hesitated, my hand gripping the door handle. “Fresh start…”

With those weak words of encouragement, I pushed the Camaro’s passenger door open and stepped out into a new hell. Figuratively, and literally, as I would later find out.

When I turned to wave goodbye, the Camaro was already zipping away.

“I get it. No safety net. No turning back.”

A deep breath escaped my lips, the kind that carried with it a reluctant sense of anticipation. I shifted my backpack, which was digging into my shoulder, and ran my fingers through the mess that was my hair. This was my feeble attempt to appear presentable. First impressions mattered, or so Mom always claimed.

I climbed the front steps, my gaze drifting repeatedly down to my Air Apollos, as if I were waiting to trip and make a fool of myself. That’s probably why I didn’t see the person waiting for me at the entrance until they called out.

“Late on your first day at Brook-Sci—not sure if that’s brave or stupid,” said a cheerful voice.

I looked up.

A tall, olive-skinned boy with curly hair leaned against the wall by the front door.

“So, which is it?” he asked.

“You tell me,” I shrugged.

I noticed he wore the same cream coat, white button-down shirt, and dark brown slacks everyone nearby was wearing, including me. Well, almost me.

Curly Hair pointed to the white hoodie underneath my coat. “Bit of both, I think.”

Wearing a hoodie instead of the Brook-Sci shirt was my one roar of rebellion against conformity, a reminder that I was still a laid-back Angeleno, even though I’d decided on being anonymous in New York.

“I’m Dre,” he grinned.

I hesitated, not wanting to give anyone my name, because I was afraid the Brook-Sci kids had heard about what I’d done in L.A. It wasn’t likely—parents on either sides of that bloody night the judge had dubbed the ‘incident’ had used up favors to keep things quiet after my arrest—but I didn’t want to take any chances.

“Aren’t you cold?” I asked instead.

His pants ended above the ankles. He wore loafers without socks too, and I wondered how he wasn’t cold like I felt in this chilly early-September weather.

“New York born and raised.” He scratched the tip of his hawkish nose. “Come on, man. Let’s get you out of the cold.”

Dre turned on his heel and strode through the entrance.

I sighed.

“Into the breach I go…”

Stepping through those massive wooden doors was like passing through a portal. The air inside the main building carried a faint scent of aged wood and floor polish. Its interior was a striking blend of old-world charm and modern fittings; wooden walls and stone floors stretched out beneath the faint glow of recessed lighting. Kids in cream coats and brown slacks or skirts moved in purposeful streams, their conversations short and quick, barely looking my way as if they had other things to do besides gawking at the new guy.

My steps echoed faintly as I followed Dre, who walked with practiced ease, his hands tucked into his pockets. I couldn’t help noticing how the other students parted for him, their eyes flickering toward his face and away again, like he was someone well-known but also someone to avoid.

“Hey, Kamala,” he waved to a tall girl with a blue hijab.

“Yo, Pete!” he saluted a mousy-looking boy in stylish glasses.

Neither of them waved back, though Dre didn’t seem to mind, and his casual attitude struck me as almost rebellious. Although he wasn’t nearly as loud as my hoodie, which kind of felt like a beacon of rebellion amidst the sea of conformity around me. I couldn’t shake the feeling that every eye I passed had noted my noncompliance.

“So, Brook-Sci,” I said, breaking the silence. “What’s the deal? Prep school for future CEOs?”

Dre glanced at me over his shoulder, his grin widening as if I’d just confirmed an inside joke.

“The teachers like to call Brook-Sci a ‘center for the academically gifted,’ but it’s more like boot camp for perfectionists,” he said.

He glanced at the hallway screen flickering oddly, then shrugged as if it was normal.

“You’ll see.”

We passed row after row of lockers; each painted the same muted shade of cream as our coats. Some had neat stacks of books resting on top, while others were barren and closed tight, as if their owners had no time for clutter…or chaos.

Seriously, Brook-Sci seemed like a world in contrast to the chaotic halls of my previous school, where the teachers who moonlighted as actors encouraged us to express ourselves in loud colors and louder attitudes. In hindsight, their careless encouragement might have been a major cause of the terrible acts that led to the incident. It didn’t mean the rigidity I noticed now was better, though. Just at the opposite end of extremes.

“Where are we going?” I asked.

“To meet The Law,” Dre said.

“The Law?”

“VP Lawson—The Law—she’s in charge of delinquents.”

He glanced over his shoulder, his dark eyes glittering.

“I heard you almost killed someone. With your bare hands.”

My eyes narrowed, but I said nothing in my defense, because nothing I said would change his mind. I learned the hard way that no one really wanted the truth. Just confirmation of their own biases.

“Hey, no judgment here, amigo,” Dre said. “This school’s full of people with stories like ours. You came to the right place.”

I frowned. “Ours?”

Dre didn’t answer, and I didn’t press him for one.

Soon enough, we arrived in an adjacent hall with few students. It was easy to guess why. The twin double doors Dre led me to were one of those fancy-looking ones with a shiny plaque next to them.

**Office of the Vice Principal**

**Shreya Parvati Lawson, EdD.**

He knocked.

“Enter,” came the muffled reply.

“All yours, amigo,” Dre said. “Try not to get eaten.”

“Not going in with me?” I asked.

Yes, I knew I sounded lame, but I didn’t want to meet The Law without backup.

“She doesn’t bite,” he said, face turning contemplative. “Or maybe she does. Lots of rumors swirling around The Law. Most are exaggerations. The fun ones aren’t.”

My face fell. “Dude, seriously?”

“Look, I’d love to stay,” he shrugged, glancing right, “but I’ve got a date with an Italian lady who hates tardiness.”

Dre didn’t go far. About two doors away, past the faculty office, and right outside the one with a plaque for the guidance counselor framed next to it.

“It’s Ollie,” I called.

I wasn’t sure why I’d given him my name. Maybe because he didn’t give me the look that I got from everyone back in L.A. that made me feel like ‘Scum of the Earth.’ Probably the best welcome I’d get in Brook-Sci.

“Hey, if you survive The Law, I’ll buy you lunch,” he said, waving.

Then he disappeared through one door, while I walked into the other. Or I tried to, but those doors opened on their own, and the middle-aged Indian woman standing on the other side of them cast me an appraising look.

“You’re two hours late, Mr. Osborn.”

She had a low, husky voice, like someone who’d smoked cigarettes way too much when she was younger.

“Sorry, Ma’am,” I replied on instinct. “Good morning, Ma’am.”

“Dr. Lawson,” she corrected.

Dr. Lawson wore a crisp white dress and a green silk cloth draped over one shoulder. One look and I knew I’d just met the last boss. She oozed this kind of confident charm and authority.

“Um, sure, Dr. Lawson, Ma’am.”

A tight smile formed on her round lips.

“Come along.”

The office, which looked as spartan as the woman who led me inside, smelled of coffee, lemon polish, and something herbal. Maybe lavender or sage?

Dr. Lawson sat behind a heavy wooden desk, her sharp brown eyes flicking up from her laptop screen as I took the seat in front of her. She said nothing, her gaze sweeping over me like a scanner. It wasn’t hostile, but it wasn’t welcoming either. More clinical or calculating.

I fidgeted in my chair, and not just because it felt intentionally stiff.

“Let’s talk about why you’re here.”

She didn’t wait for a reply, telling me in her own words my experiences, as if she knew them better. Maybe she did, because her words hit like a hammer wrapped in silk.

“I don’t need excuses. I need commitment. You’ll find our juvenile rehabilitation program isn’t for the faint of heart.” Dr. Lawson paused, fingers steepling as she leaned forward. “But if you’re serious about starting over, we’ll work on rebuilding what you’ve broken. Fair?”

It wasn’t a question, but a challenge; one I wasn’t sure I was ready to accept. But I nodded anyway. There was just something about Dr. Lawson’s presence that made defiance seem downright stupid.

“According to your transcript, your grades are excellent—top ten percent last year. That’s your edge. Don’t lose it.”

Of course, my test scores were great. It was my one compromise in my misguided quest to live up to Dad’s ideals. Despite all the trouble I got into, I never let my grades slip.

“With the new school year barely beginning, maintaining top grades is the first step to rehabilitation.”

In my mind, a memory flashed: a gavel striking down as a judge declared me guilty.

Sure, Dr. Lawson wasn’t outright condemning me, but she seemed certain I was an evil seed who needed correction. After all, she hadn’t asked me for my opinion. She just told me who I was and what I needed, like most adults did.

“As for your juvenile record, I want to be clear. Brooklyn Science Academy doesn’t tolerate aggression. No bullying, fighting, or property damage…anything unlawful, in school or off-campus, and you’re done.”

She raised a well-manicured finger.

“One strike, and you’re out, Mr. Osborn. This is your last chance.”

Wrong baseball references aside, Dr. Lawson had an icy glare. I felt sufficiently warned.

“I’ll stay out of trouble.”

It was a promise I fully meant to keep, but one I couldn’t keep.

My meeting with The Law ended soon afterward, and her assistant gave me a slip of paper with directions that would take me to my class, 2-F, which the mild-mannered assistant admitted was the sophomore class where they dumped all the juvenile delinquents, separating us bad seeds from the future CEOs and Olympic stars.

Spoiler alert—I didn’t make it to 2-F.

I got lost because Brook-Sci’s campus was ridiculously huge. Despite following the map to the second floor, I somehow ended up outside the main building and walking on a brick pathway leading to a dome-shaped structure with athletes in different sports carved on its wall.

I paused midway, my gaze drifting up to the signboard hanging above another set of imposing front doors.

**The Bernard King Gymnasium**

That’s when someone crashed into me.

Luckily, I was sturdy enough to keep my balance. I even caught my attacker before he stumbled headfirst onto the sidewalk.

“W-who are you?” asked the boy who’d hit me.

He gazed at me with wary eyes that were a striking shade of gray and blue.

“A-are you with…t-them?” he stuttered. “Look, I-I was already on my way. T-They didn’t need to send—”

“Dude, calm down,” I cut him off. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

He looked so flustered that I assumed he hadn’t rammed into me intentionally. Most likely, he hadn’t seen me while running at top speed.

“You dropped your stuff,” I said.

While helping him pick up the soda cans rolling on the ground, I took the time to observe this unexpected disruption to my promise of not getting into trouble.

He looked about a year or two younger, thin and lanky, with fluffy raven hair framing a pale, gaunt face. He also had a cut on his lip, the kind you got from a hard punch to the face.

I wasn’t sure what his deal was, but whatever had happened to him, he wore it like a cloak. The way he stood—slightly hunched—gave the impression of a person bracing to be hit again.

“Hey,” I dropped the last soda can into his bag while trying to catch his wandering gaze, “are you alright?”

His eyes darted to the side, as though he expected shadows to materialize out of thin air and swallow him whole. This wasn’t likely, not just because shadows didn’t eat people, but because we seemed to be the only two students hanging around outside the gym at this hour.

“You’re really not with them?” he asked, sounding surprised.

“It’s my first day here. I don’t know anyone,” I said.

Relief flooded his face. It didn’t last.

He got a call on his smartphone, though it took him ages to answer. Five seconds into the call, and his face drained of color.

“I-I’m on my way,” he muttered. “N-No. Bella’s not in class…”

Every movement telegraphed unease, but it was the tremble in his fingers that really gave him away. He looked scared—no, beyond scared. The kid was terrified.

“I-I’m not lying. My sister has a shoot…she won’t be in school today.”

His smartphone slipped from his trembling hand and hit the sidewalk with a hollow thud. He scrambled to pick it up, muttering an apology into the receiver, his voice cracking like thin ice under pressure.

“I-I’ll be there soon,” he stammered, almost pleadingly, as if he needed the person on the other end to believe him.

For a few seconds after the call, he stood there frozen, a figure carved out of pure tension, before his eyes flicked toward me. “Y-You should get to class before a gladiator catches you…”

“Wait,” one of my eyebrows hitched up, “did you say gladiator?”

He shook his head.

With his strange warning given, the kid’s feet started moving, shaky and hesitant, like he was walking toward the edge of a cliff he couldn’t avoid.

I grabbed his wrist.

My smartwatch buzzed faintly. No notification, just a pulse. Like it was reacting, though that was all it did.

As for the boy, he flinched beneath my grip, though he didn’t protest. Instead, he stared at me with wide, glassy eyes that seemed to beg for something—understanding, maybe, or salvation.

“Are you in trouble?” I asked.

Mine was a stupid question. He obviously was. I’d seen his expression before. It was the look of a victim, the kind that was nearing the end of his rope. A part of me hoped he would deny it, though, so I could look the other way and not feel bad afterward.

“Do you need—”

I couldn’t say that last word. No, it was more like I refused to say it.

Mom exiled me to the other side of the country for this same shit—butting my nose in where it didn’t belong. I couldn’t get involved again. Not if I wanted to make ‘starting over’ a reality. Even if that meant letting this kid fall into a pit he can’t come out of.

My fingers slackened, and he escaped my grasp.

Sensing my reluctance to help, his shoulders sagged in surrender, and then he ran down the side of the gym in a rush.

And just like that, I became a bystander again, stuck on the threshold between action and regret. I hated feeling this way, like I’d just disappointed Dad.

In a twisted sort of way, his death became the backdrop to every choice and misstep that landed me in trouble. It wasn’t rebellion, but survival. An instinctive need to protect the pieces of myself that remained intact afterward. Even now, as my rational mind went to war with my instincts, I couldn’t let this part of me go. Not easily, and not without a fight.

Besides, it wasn’t like I could forget the kid’s face. It lingered, pale and wide-eyed, like a snapshot burned into memory.

I cursed under my breath.

“What’s wrong with me?”

I wasn’t trying to be a hero. I’d tried that once. It got me exiled. Yet, for some reason, I felt that if I turned my back on this kid, and whatever or whoever had freaked him out, I’d be turning my back on something bigger. Something I couldn’t see yet but knew was waiting around the corner.

Hell, I could almost hear Dad’s voice in my head. *“Evil triumphs only when good people do nothing.”*

“Fuck,” I sighed. “So much for staying out of trouble.”

It was like flipping a switch I couldn’t turn off. My legs moved before my mind caught up, a burst of adrenaline coursing through my veins and drowning out the nagging doubts. Then I was off, racing through campus, and into the unknown.

I have long been diagnosed with Idiopathic Hypersomnolence and for most of this time I have been able to bumble my way about in life to some degree of success.

Recently I have had some medication changes that are further causing issues with fatigue, sleeping and most crucially waking up.  
I had always struggled with deep sleep but now I am on both Dexamphetamine and Testosterone the stimulant effects of these are causing me to have lighter sleep as the days go by. As my sleep is lighter I am naturally getting a lot less than what I do need to function correctly with how a few other health conditions are affecting me.

I have been on Modafinil 100mg which was really expensive here in Aus and at that does it was very little benefit as around 400mg is the dose that worked best. I naturally can not afford to quadruple the cost of an expensive medication and have not even filled my prescription of late due to the cost of life.  
Yes Aus has subsidised medications through our PBS but Modafinil and any other medication that could be of help is just not accepted for IH, in fact there are zero medications in Australia that are designated to treat this condition.  
It is a pretty disgraceful thing in my eyes as IH can have more debilitating effects compared to Narcolepsy depending on how you compare it.

I am really hoping to get some advice, especially from anyone else in Aus who has managed to get support for IH. I am looking for input into what I should be doing to work best with this condition as I am no longer able to keep up with just my basic home life and it is causing some tension in life.

Currently I am stuck with IH, Insomnia (this is horrible, 95 hours is my wake record), 1% REM sleep (sleep study found it), Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos, Fibromyalgia, a spine full of failures and strong temperature dysregulation.

I am looking to get answers on how I can;  
\- Wake myself up when needed. My partner is unable to wake me at times, even with yelling and shaking my legs/feet. I have been looking at a shock/zapping bracelet of sorts as it may be my only way.  
\- How to manage day time fatigue. I am so tired, just eternally tired and I will never be able to correct this through any amount of sleep.  
\- If anyone here in Aus has managed to get beneficial medications under ""Compassionate Use"" as I can not afford more private scripts, especially looking at the cost of Sodium Oxybate here.  
\- Advice on improving sleep quality. This one is very difficult as I frequently sublux my joints in sleep and mostly whimper and groan in pain the whole night. I am already on strong pain medications with little effect and have tried every sleep hygiene option known to man. So I am very open to getting weird with things as what is standard just does not work for me.  
\- Lastly, just any advice on doing more than coping with IH, I want to do more in my role as a partner and parent.

Sorry for the rambling, I am tired after all!  
I just want to do better in my life for my partner, my child and myself. I just am lost in what to do, especially if I have been falling asleep at inappropriate times (dentist or standing). I have had the MSLT and overnight test with no Narcolepsy or Apnoea.

  
Edit - I just realised I missed some information. I have been found to only have around 1% REM sleep and it is absolutely an issue in my terrible memory.  
I have also been found to be a rapid metaboliser of quite a few medications and sadly caffeine is included. I have tried 1350mg caffeine in a day and noticed that there was no benefit to my fatigue.  
I do wish I could coffee up and carry on but I sadly can not.",1,1763089500.0,idiopathichypersomnia,0,1.0,False

We make a great team, we work hard, we love hard, we're winning at life. I love him. (Bonus he's super hot). 

There's just one thing, I'm genuinely curious about.

When I get up in the morning, I like start my day happy, with positive vibes. My mantra (although maybe exessive) is I'm alive, I have energy, I'm going to win the day. My husband is miserable in the morning. He exudes the worst energy. He looks miserable and is so crabby. It's best to avoid conversations because it's met with attitude. After coffee and a good 30 mins to an hour of 'waking up' he's back to his normal awesome self.

I try to just pretend he's not there most of the time. I'm also very empathetic and sometimes pick up on this energy. Most of the year he's gone before I even wake up. But when he's home, I'd love it if we could share a positive morning together.

There is a Starbucks maybe 500ft from us down the hallway, but I feel like we are CLEARLY not a Starbucks. 

A guest came in earlier and he ordered a Starbucks menu item, I politely informed him that we are not a Starbucks, but we do have sandwiches. I also gave him the directions to Starbucks if he wanted it. He said no thats okay, ordered his sandwich, then said he would like a ""venti sugar cookie latte"" (which sounds quite good but we don't have!) and I stared at him blankly and said "".......im sorry sir we are not starbucks"" and he said ""you guys just make it look like such a Starbucks in here"" and I cannot fathom what he possibly meant by that 😭

This happens at least once a week, but Im sure it at least happens to one member of the team a day. One time a man asked me if I was not bilingual in other coffee shops sizes 😭😭😭 Im not even lingual in mine. ",8,1763089271.0,barista,6,1.0,False

1owl3mn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/1owl3mn/weekday_q_vs_weekend_q_jekyll_hyde/,Weekday Q vs Weekend Q- Jekyll & Hyde,"It is a Thursday night, and as it goes most every week- my husband has been great since Monday. I almost start to actually like him again (and doubt myself and my own feelings) after four days of him being “normal”. On weekdays he is genuinely a good father, husband, very successful at work. May have a few beers but nothing that seems abnormal. Buys me flowers or picks up my favorite coffee drink just because.  The kind of guy most women would want to marry. BUT I know that tomorrow is Friday…and that starts three days straight of drinking. 

He is a completely different person on weekends (and holidays and vacations are even worse). After the first two drinks, he changes into someone I don’t even know. Angry, emotional, self pitying, easily set off, acts like (and sometimes says) that he hates all of us. Like a 180 degree personality change. The kids (teens) and I mostly avoid him all weekend (he sits out on the patio drinking alone) & I basically function as a single parent. He can’t be trusted to drive the kids anywhere on the weekends. He will drive drunk (after an incident where he picked our youngest up from sports practice drunk, I’ve banned him from driving anyone on the weekends). Fortunately they are also old enough to know not to get in a vehicle with him. We’ve learned how to steer clear of him (and teens often aren’t home much on the weekends anyway) but he still has an “episode” of screaming ranting and raving, slamming doors etc at least 1 or 2 times every month. Directed at me, typically. Or over some issue or another that frustrates him (dishwasher isn’t working, something spilled in the fridge etc). On Sundays (often the only time of the week when everyone is home), he day drinks & passes out by 7pm. So that he is “recovered” for work the next morning. After several embarrassing incidents, we’ve largely stopped going anywhere as a family on the weekends. 

But every Monday? He pretty much changes back into the man I married. I know that these two people are the SAME person but it really messes with my head. 

He also only judges himself by his “Mon-Thurs” behavior & seems baffled as to why I am not happy with him. Or why the kids seem so distant. As if behavior on the  weekends just doesn’t count. 

The “good days” just make dealing with this more difficult.  If he was drinking daily, it would be easier to mentally reconcile somehow.

1owl29p,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1owl29p/sp_the_last_man_in_tallaloosa/,[SP] The Last Man in Tallaloosa,"He stopped on the sidewalk and watched them. Everyone around him moved like drones, heads bowed to their phones, blue light washing over their faces. No one saw where they were going, especially not the little children, who sat in strollers, mouths open, eyes like saucers, entranced by the bouncing and singing characters on the tablets they held in tiny hands.

*This is a nightmare,* he thought. *This is a nightmare, and I’m dreaming, and soon I will wake up and everything will be normal again.*

But day by day, more screens appeared. Everywhere he went, from parks and libraries to coffee shops. Even gas stations had little monitors on the pumps, telling you what to buy while you filled your tank.

The more the world changed, the more he felt called to fight against it. He read about blue light and circadian rhythm, about the invisible web of EMF that hummed through every home. He listened to men on podcasts who promised escape, he bought grounding sheets, EMF-blocking phone cases, red-light machines. He would lie on the ground, knees falling together, his feet in the grass.

But he still couldn’t shake how alone he felt.

He tried to talk to his family and friends about the things he learned. “You can’t wear sunglasses outside,” he said. “Your eyes are receivers. They take in light. If you block that light, your body thinks it’s night, and your skin won’t produce the melanin it needs to protect itself. That’s why you have to go outside first thing in the morning. You’re priming your circadian rhythm, telling your body it’s day. Almost every disease, every single one, is a disease of circadian dysfunction.”

“That’s nice, hunny,” his mother said, scratching her eye with a manicured fingernail, never looking up from her phone.

*I have to do something,* he told himself.

With a flash of inspiration, he ran home and down the staircase into his basement. The room was cold and nearly bare, except for what looked like a block-headed ghost, sitting lonesome in the corner. He ripped away the sheet, and underneath sat an old-school desktop computer. He pulled back the chair, plugged in a webcam, set his blue-light glasses on his face, and clicked record. With the webcam blinking and watching, he began to speak.

He talked about mitochondria, blue light, non-native EMF, WiFi (and what it was doing to the bees), then came the conspiracies, JFK, 9/11. \[Blank\] Space Lasers.

It started with a couple of likes, a few comments, and then his channel exploded. Every day he woke up with hundreds, then thousands of likes, comments, and shares. As soon as he woke up in the morning, he would immediately grab his phone and start replying to everyone who had commented the night before. All day, every day, his phone buzzed and pinged and flashed with alerts, and he checked them all.

He didn’t realize his channel had peaked until it all began to die down. Eventually, the videos he posted received no likes and no shares. Then he went live, and nobody showed up.

*Weird*, he thought. He restarted his computer and tried again. *Maybe a better title… One Last Stand Before the Control Grid Wins.*

He waited. Nothing. No one came. He sat in his chair and stared. The webcam light flashed patiently until the screen went dark, leaving only the black reflection of his face staring back at him.

*Well, I guess that’s it,* he sighed. He opened Craigslist on his computer and began to type. *Looking for a gun.* He posted. He knew that without *this*, without his channel, he had nothing. Almost immediately, his phone pinged\*. I have what you’re looking for.\* They set up a meeting for the next day. That night, he slept better than he had in years.

When leaving the next morning, he took a deep breath, put his hand on the doorknob, and sighed. *I tried. God knows I tried.* He swung open the door, and the light hit him like a freight train, blinding him instantly.

*How long has it been since I’ve been out of this house?*

He heard laughter and shouting. He stood there, letting his eyes adjust, dust circling around him, his hand cupped over his brow to block the sun. When his vision cleared, he saw them. All of them.

Children ran in the sun, flying kites and holding hands, shouting and laughing as they rolled in the grass. Women sat on blankets and benches, bouncing babies on their knees, talking and gesturing wildly to the other women around them. The men stood over grills, tanned and muscular, flipping burgers, drinking beers, and throwing footballs to the boys.

He stood there watching it all, with his bloodshot eyes squinting, and his pasty skin burning in the sun. His arm hung down long by his side, his hand clutching his phone.

A frisbee landed on his steps. He picked it up and stared at it. “Uhh, can we have that back?” A teenage boy was looking at him, waiting. He threw it to the boy, but a little too hard. The boy reached as the frisbee flew over his hands and skidded into the grass. The boy jogged over to pick it up and muttered “Thanks,” before running away laughing.

Then he was left alone, standing by himself on the porch. After a few more moments, he looked left, then right. Slowly, he stepped backward into the doorway, into his dark and dusty home, and closed the door behind him.

Essentially, the team is divided into two smaller groups which defend two different maps. Mid shift your ability (like coffee) can be a travel period to swap characters from different areas. It would be cool if like the map expanded each ep eventually connecting on the final ep. It just allows a lot more management and also gives a reason to maybe add more heroes into the mix (although i already love the current z team) I posted this on the discord just now as well and sorry if im unclear! I’ll try to explain better if you need. ALSO MORE SYNERGY WOULD BE GAS. Idk if there’s a cap per area and if you would swap in heroes from bench as well but yeah.

The patient not only survived, but was complaining about the quality of the ship's nutrient paste two hours later. Their healers are not practitioners of medicine; they are architects of defiance.""* \- *Intercepted Skorn warrior's debriefing log.*

The sterile medical bay gleamed, its profound quiet disturbed only by the small, rhythmic beeping of a diagnostic monitor. Dr. Aris Thorne sat at her desk, grateful for the stillness now that all the ""jerks""—her private term for the diplomats with their psychosomatic ailments—were gone for the day.

Her only company, **Tim**, swam lazily in his self-contained aqua-sphere. He was, as far as anyone knew, the only genetically modified tardigrade visible to the naked eye. The bio-modification was only supposed to make him slightly more visible; instead, Tim was now the size of a large guinea pig and had developed a quirky, chaotic personality, complete with random, energetic bursts.

Aris stood up, her back cracking as her arms popped. She turned to look at her office, her private cabinet of curiosities: the skull of a saber-toothed tiger, a collection of antique 19th-century surgical tools, and her pre-packed, military-grade go-bag. She grabbed her coffee, sipping slowly as she listened to Tim chitter softly.

""No, Tim,"" she shook her head, ""we are officially grounded. I swear,"" she scoffed, ""if I have to diagnose one more case of 'bureaucratic misery,' I'm going to declare it a pandemic.""

A wave of profound boredom washed over her. She sat down, spun her chair in lazy circles, and idly threw a pencil into the acoustic panels in the ceiling.

Suddenly, Tim zoomed past her head like a cocaine-fueled cat out of hell. It was pure, unfettered chaos. Aris jumped, startled, and then let out a bark of pure, delighted laughter, her eyes dancing with delight at the sudden, glorious chaos. ""Now this is more like it!""

The aqua-sphere bounced to and fro, chirping loudly. And then, the klaxons went off.

The deep, jarring blare of a **Code Omega** klaxon bathed the room in red. The noise sent Tim into a true panic, his aqua-sphere accelerating faster, ricocheting off the bulkheads like a pinball.

Aris stared, dumbfounded, her brain trying to process the sudden, glorious rush of information and recognition. Her console was flashing, a high-priority summons from a Specialist Eva Rostova demanding an immediate, unprecedented xenobiological consultation. 45-minute departure window.

She read the notification again, a wide, manic grin spreading across her face.

""Well, Tim,"" she said, calmly snatching his bouncing aqua-sphere out of the air. ""Looks like we're going on a field trip.""

She grabbed her go-bag from the wall, settled the sphere into its custom-padded slot, and headed for the door, humming a cheerful tune.

1owkwcd,https://www.reddit.com/r/MM_RomanceBooks/comments/1owkwcd/rec_request_demanding_petulant_brat_mc_high_heat/,"Rec request: DEMANDING, petulant brat MC (high heat, any genre)","Hi all and thanks in advance for your help!

I love a book with a good brat, but I am looking for a specific type of brat. In a lot of books, the brats can be a bit too withdrawn, or simply not demanding enough for me. I want the over-the-top emotion, the spoiled insistence, pouting, foot stomping, etc.

Sooo I’m looking for m/m romance recs where one MC is very much a brat, but in this specific way:

* demanding
* petulant
* clingy
* possessive
* easily jealous if anyone else so much as looks at MC2
* Does stupid, transparent things for MC2's attention

This sounds like the definition of a brat, right? But I find it surprisingly hard to find books where the character is as over-the-top as ""brat"" implies. 

A couple books I loved for this vibe:

* **{A Suitable Brat by R. Cooper}** \- Sun’s brat energy was *perfect*. He's demanding of Westin, and so obviously jealous and possessive. >!He was ultimately not that shy to demonstrate how he felt, and he couldn't hide it when he was jealous. He also felt that he owned Westin's cock, and was sort of entitled to it, which was so great. !<<< this isn't exactly a spoiler, but the book is so short that describing any part of it feels like giving a lot away.
* **{Poetry on Ice by Jesse H. Reign}** \- While not advertised as a brat, I love how demanding Robbie is. He's not shy about his emotions, and he's not above a little petulance. He's openly clingy. I loved this whole bit: >!“Just so you know, it’s casual,” I tell him. “This thing between us, it’s just fucking, okay? I’m not a relationship guy, and I’m not saying you are or anything. I just want to be super clear about who I am so we don’t get our wires crossed.” His eyes darken and his bottom lip narrows till it’s little more than a dot. He raises his mug to his lips and takes a spiteful sip of coffee. A fission of fear carves a hole in my sternum. I know that look. I’ve seen it before. I saw it when I told him he couldn’t blow me anymore, and just look how that turned out—I’m twenty grand in debt to this man, and his mouth is practically my dick’s holiday home. “We’ll see about that,” he says.!<I just love how he has no qualms about sharing his emotions or making demands of Ant.
* {Captive Mate by Elliot Grayson} - Arik is adorable with Matthew. He fights him and yells at him and even kicks him at one point, but it's all because of how much he WANTS Matthew. 

I’ve already searched the sub, and I believe I've read all the brat books that come up. I'm hoping someone has recs for this type of brat. MC1 doesn't have to be advertised as a brat, but if you get this sense from a character, that might be exactly what I need!

To help avoid duplicates, here are some brat books I’ve read already and how they landed for me:

* **{Just a Bit Wrong by Alessandra Hazard}** \- Loved it (as I love all AH books), but Tristan’s brattiness felt more *guarded* than demanding.
* **{The Brat and the Beast by Misha Horne}** \- Enjoyed this series a lot, but I honestly didn’t find the MC bratty? I think there's only one scene >!where he throws something!<, but aside from that, I don't see brat. 
* **{A Collar for His Brat by R.J. Moray}** \- Loved this whole series, loved the dynamic, but Ewan just wasn’t demanding or petulant enough for what I’m craving right now.
* **{Little Demon in the Details by Nordika Knight} -** This one was a bit of a miss for me; the dynamic felt underwhelming.

**Bonus points** if the other MC:

* is a little stern, possessive, or indulgently exasperated, or 
* enjoys dealing with the brat’s jealousy and demands, or
* Loses it at some point! (spanking is welcome, fyi)

**High heat only please :)**

  
Any genre or kink is totally fine, though if you could mention what they are, that would be appreciated!

1owkuye,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1owkuye/the_last_man_in_tallaloosa/,The Last Man in Tallaloosa,"He stopped on the sidewalk and watched them. Everyone around him moved like drones, heads bowed to their phones, blue light washing over their faces. No one saw where they were going, especially not the little children, who sat in strollers, mouths open, eyes like saucers, entranced by the bouncing and singing characters on the tablets they held in tiny hands.

*This is a nightmare,* he thought. *This is a nightmare, and I’m dreaming, and soon I will wake up and everything will be normal again.*

But day by day, more screens appeared. Everywhere he went, from parks and libraries to coffee shops. Even gas stations had little monitors on the pumps, telling you what to buy while you filled your tank.

The more the world changed, the more he felt called to fight against it. He read about blue light and circadian rhythm, about the invisible web of EMF that hummed through every home. He listened to men on podcasts who promised escape, he bought grounding sheets, EMF-blocking phone cases, red-light machines. He would lie on the ground, knees falling together, his feet in the grass.

But he still couldn’t shake how alone he felt.

He tried to talk to his family and friends about the things he learned. “You can’t wear sunglasses outside,” he said. “Your eyes are receivers. They take in light. If you block that light, your body thinks it’s night, and your skin won’t produce the melanin it needs to protect itself. That’s why you have to go outside first thing in the morning. You’re priming your circadian rhythm, telling your body it’s day. Almost every disease, every single one, is a disease of circadian dysfunction.”

“That’s nice, hunny,” his mother said, scratching her eye with a manicured fingernail, never looking up from her phone.

*I have to do something,* he told himself.

With a flash of inspiration, he ran home and down the staircase into his basement. The room was cold and nearly bare, except for what looked like a block-headed ghost, sitting lonesome in the corner. He ripped away the sheet, and underneath sat an old-school desktop computer. He pulled back the chair, plugged in a webcam, set his blue-light glasses on his face, and clicked record. With the webcam blinking and watching, he began to speak.

He talked about mitochondria, blue light, non-native EMF, WiFi (and what it was doing to the bees), then came the conspiracies, JFK, 9/11. Jewish Space Lasers.

It started with a couple of likes, a few comments, and then his channel exploded. Every day he woke up with hundreds, then thousands of likes, comments, and shares. As soon as he woke up in the morning, he would immediately grab his phone and start replying to everyone who had commented the night before. All day, every day, his phone buzzed and pinged and flashed with alerts, and he checked them all.

He didn’t realize his channel had peaked until it all began to die down. Eventually, the videos he posted received no likes and no shares. Then he went live, and nobody showed up.

*Weird*, he thought. He restarted his computer and tried again. *Maybe a better title… One Last Stand Before the Control Grid Wins.*

He waited. Nothing. No one came. He sat in his chair and stared. The webcam light flashed patiently until the screen went dark, leaving only the black reflection of his face staring back at him.

*Well, I guess that’s it,* he sighed. He opened Craigslist on his computer and began to type. *Looking for a gun.* He posted. He knew that without *this*, without his channel, he had nothing. Almost immediately, his phone pinged*. I have what you’re looking for.* They set up a meeting for the next day. That night, he slept better than he had in years.

When leaving the next morning, he took a deep breath, put his hand on the doorknob, and sighed. *I tried. God knows I tried.* He swung open the door, and the light hit him like a freight train, blinding him instantly.

*How long has it been since I’ve been out of this house?*

He heard laughter and shouting. He stood there, letting his eyes adjust, dust circling around him, his hand cupped over his brow to block the sun. When his vision cleared, he saw them. All of them.

Children ran in the sun, flying kites and holding hands, shouting and laughing as they rolled in the grass. Women sat on blankets and benches, bouncing babies on their knees, talking and gesturing wildly to the other women around them. The men stood over grills, tanned and muscular, flipping burgers, drinking beers, and throwing footballs to the boys.

He stood there watching it all, with his bloodshot eyes squinting, and his pasty skin burning in the sun. His arm hung down long by his side, his hand clutching his phone.

A frisbee landed on his steps. He picked it up and stared at it. “Uhh, can we have that back?” A teenage boy was looking at him, waiting. He threw it to the boy, but a little too hard. The boy reached as the frisbee flew over his hands and skidded into the grass. The boy jogged over to pick it up and muttered “Thanks,” before running away laughing.

Then he was left alone, standing by himself on the porch. After a few more moments, he looked left, then right. Slowly, he stepped backward into the doorway, into his dark and dusty home, and closed the door behind him.

Assuming she spends roughly $50 per week on specialty coffee drinks per week, per year that would be $2,600 (this total does not include tips and taxes added on). 

If she does this for three years, it adds up to $7,800. 

Even if I loved coffee as much as she did, I don’t think I could be okay spending that amount. She’ll also regularly get cookies and drinks for the kids/J3, meaning that her daily spending could be in the $30 range on average. To put that into perspective, YouTube Red costs $30 per month, and adds up to $360 per year. It’s a wholly unnecessary expense, and while I’m not against people getting specialty food and drink on occasion, this is just too much. She’s obviously in the wrong income bracket to get expensive drinks daily, and it’s going to really hurt when the gravy train dries up, and she’s too used to living this way.

1owkkul,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1owkkul/for_lovers_of_balance_may_i_suggest_a_recipe/,"for lovers of balance, may i suggest a recipe:","there is nothing particularly special about this recipe, but i have found that it produces - for me - the most consistent and balanced cups. this is not for those who favor one quality over another, like acidity or body, but rather prefer when they all work in tandem pretty seamlessly. this obviously isn’t to speak down on those who do prefer more of a certain quality, as i myself will purposefully alter my recipes if i am craving alot of juiciness or a lot of richness in my cup, but i usually prefer when there is an overall balance. for reference, i am currently using a plastic v60, abaca filters, and my ZP6 grinder on setting 6.2. i use 18g of coffee with a brew ratio of 1:17, so 306g of water.

it is important to use a slow pour rate with laminar flow, just above the bed (1-2 inches)

brew temp: 93°C


bloom: 60g - fully wet grounds in about 8 seconds and wait a total of 35 seconds from first contact before the next pour

“second bloom”: 60g - wait just until the water seeps through the surface of the bed before the next pour

main pour - pour remaining water; start at the center for a few seconds before slowly branching out enough to bypass for a single rotation, then slowly return back to the center and stay there for the remainder of the pour, using roughly nickel-sized rotations throughout. the total duration of this pour will depend on your preferred volume, but the duration after bypass should take up the majority of the pour

about 10 seconds after you finish pouring, gently swirl the brewer for barely a moment, just enough to begin a swirling motion of the bed, but no more. this helps to level the bed for even extraction, as well as implementing some minimal agitation for body, which (in theory) balances out the bypass from earlier.

allow the bed to drain, waiting about 5 seconds after water seeps through the surface before finally removing the brewer.


again, there is nothing special about this recipe other than the fact that it seems to always brew really great balanced cups for me, and maybe some of you will find it helpful for your own brews. feel free to let me know how it goes for you. thanks for taking the time to look at it in any case. cheers!

Lionheart's office actually has some detail (even the lobby before it), even something basic, a name tag. Also, his office is messy, which could have been a sign of his stress and him kinda regretting working with the bad guys, but this is just headcanon (but overall, his office is decent)

James is a BIG fat disappointment even his concept art showed was originally supposed to get objects but his desk is just empty and just like Oz only has a holographic screen that we barely see, James office while having good details with the art being space like due to his love of astronomy and the book shelfs his office is JUST EMPTY, The writers could have maybe put alot of flies paperwork showing the audience another way of seeing James stressed doing his job but uhh nah lets do Ozpin office again but with different coloring. (by the way, if you're confused about the screen other than the operational table, he also has a small one in couple scenes like where he gives orders to two military staff or during V7 2ep title ""A New Approach"".) (also like the feature that his office got a lockdown mode, although kinda strange Harriet has a device for that, did James give it to her in secret or something?)

Based on the concept art, we get Theodore's office. I don't have a lot of hope, especially for some reason the writers think it's logical to make an important position with balconies, WIDE openable doors IN FOUR different sides is logical. (This is like if the white house made every single window in the entire building a door)

Generally, I know it's not a big deal and it's a nitpick, but I feel like it was a missed opportunity, especially as the other headmasters theoretically could have gotten ones, but only Leo was the one, and he was kinda a waste either way overall, What do you think?

The last two nights I’ve had HORRIBLE heartburn. Like worse than anything I’ve ever experienced. Ironically I never had it while taking Ozempic. My Dr had prescribed me a PPI but I never needed it.

I hadn’t linked the acid reflux to Ozempic withdrawal until just now…first night I had it I thought maybe I had a bit too much wine.  But tonight I didn’t have any alcohol, had only one cup of coffee in the AM and had a smallish dinner. So was shocked when I got hit with this awful reflux again.

I leaned back on my couch, intrigued. ""Who? Tell me everything!"" “I was at that coffee shop downtown, and there was this guy… Elijah. He’s 24, super cute, and we totally hit it off!” I could hear the smile in her voice, and for a moment, I felt a hint of relief. Violet hadn’t had the best luck with guys lately. “That sounds great! So, what’s he like?” I asked, hoping to hear high praise. “Well, he’s really into hiking and cooking, and he has this adorable laugh. But get this—he’s also into, like, philosophy and art. It was amazing talking to him,” she said, with an enthusiasm that made me grin. “Wow, he sounds perfect! When are you going to see him again?” “Next Friday! We’re going to grab dinner,” she replied, sounding giddy.  As the days passed, I found myself picturing the two of them together, and for the first time in a while, I felt hopeful for her. But then something strange happened. The following weekend, as Violet and I were texting, she sent me a photo that made my heart drop. “Check out this cute pic! Can’t wait for dinner with Elijah!” she wrote, along with his picture. There was something off about it, but I couldn’t quite place it. “Wait, how old did you say he was again?” I asked cautiously. “Twenty-four! Why?” I studied the photo again. Elijah looked a bit... older than I'd expected. “Are you sure?” “Yes! Why would I lie about that?” she shot back, slightly defensive. “I don’t know, it’s just… he looks like he could be a dad!” I responded, trying to tread lightly. A few days later, Violet and I were out shopping when she casually mentioned something that made my stomach twist. “Elijah told me he’s really into classic rock. He saw The Rolling Stones last year!”  “Last year?” I echoed, trying to keep my tone neutral. “But they’ve been around for a long time. How did he get to see them?” “It’s not a big deal, he just really likes old music,” Violet replied, waving her hand dismissively. But the wheels in my head were turning. “Violet, are you sure he’s in his twenties? Maybe he’s just… really matured?” I suggested, though I felt a creeping doubt. The following weekend, they were supposed to meet again, and that’s when I decided I needed to intervene. I discreetly texted her, suggesting we should all meet up for dinner—just to see for myself. “I don’t know, he might be busy,” she replied, defensive again. “Come on, just a casual dinner. I want to meet this guy!” I insisted. “Fine!"" she finally relented. “But I promise he’s great!” On the night of our dinner, I arrived first, my heart racing. When Elijah walked in, my stomach dropped. I was right; he was far older than 24. He looked to be at least in his 50s, if not more.  ""Violet! You made it!” he exclaimed, his voice deeper than I expected.  “Of course! I wanted to introduce you to my sister!” she said with excessive cheerfulness, clearly oblivious to the discomfort radiating off me. “Nice to meet you!” he said, extending a hand, and I shook it, trying to maintain a polite smile. “Uh, so, what do you do, Elijah?” I asked, trying to get a sense of him. “Oh, I’m retired now. I used to be a professor, but now I spend my time enjoying life!” he said with a wide grin, resembling more of a grandfather than someone dating my sister. My heart sank for Violet as I exchanged a glance with her. The realization appeared to dawn on her, slowly but surely. “Wait, you’re retired? Like, actually retired?”  “Well, yeah, I mean, I had a good run!” he chuckled, clearly unaware of the chaos he had just unleashed. “Violet, how old are you again?” I asked softly, trying to keep the tension at bay. “Twenty-three…” she murmured, her confidence shaking as she processed the information. “That’s interesting, Elijah. Do you have any kids?” My voice was steady, but the question hung heavily in the air. “Yeah, I do! Three, actually!” he replied proudly, oblivious to the mortification settling in. I watched as realization washed over Violet's face, her earlier excitement fading into confusion. “Wait… Three kids?”  “Yeah! They’re all in college now!” he said, beaming. “Uh… okay….” Violet trailed off, glancing between us. “Maybe I should have asked more questions…”  We finished dinner in awkward silence, and later that night, Violet admitted she had been too swept away in the romance and charm to see the reality. “I didn’t think to ask about kids or past relationships,” she confessed, her face flushed with embarrassment. “Honestly, Violet, it’s a huge red flag. You need to be cautious,” I told her gently. She sighed. “You're right. This is definitely a lesson learned.” As we walked home, I couldn’t help but shake my head, hoping this experience would serve as a turning point for her—a reminder that sometimes, the biggest red flags can be hidden behind a charming smile.",1,1763087035.0,u_millyisbest0673,0,1.0,False
1owkfcz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tribewood/comments/1owkfcz/how_to_protect_your_wood_table_tribewood/,How to Protect Your Wood Table? - TribeWood,"When you buy a wooden table/desk, how do you prevent wear and tear? Liquid spills, scratches, or everyday use... these simple methods can keep your wooden table looking its best for years to come.

# 1. Use Coasters and Placemats

This is a no-brainer, but it’s super effective! Always use coasters for drinks and placemats for hot plates or dishes. Hot items, like pots or pans, can scorch the surface, while drinks can leave water rings. A simple coaster or mat can prevent these small accidents.

# 2. Clean Spills Immediately

Wood is highly absorbent, and spills—especially liquids like wine, coffee, or juice—can stain or warp the wood. Always wipe up spills as soon as they happen with a soft, dry cloth. For tougher stains, a slightly damp cloth can do the trick, but make sure to dry it off afterward.

# 3. Use a Protective Finish

Applying a quality wood finish or wax can add an extra layer of protection. A polyurethane finish is a good option for a durable, long-lasting shield. You can also use a furniture wax to keep the wood nourished while protecting it from dirt and moisture. Just make sure to follow the product instructions for best results.

# 4. Keep It Away from Direct Sunlight

Sunlight can fade and dry out the wood over time. To avoid this, keep your table out of direct sunlight, or consider using window treatments like blinds or curtains to control light exposure.

# 5. Regular Dusting and Cleaning

Dust can build up and scratch the surface over time. Use a soft, lint-free cloth to dust your table regularly. If you need to clean it more thoroughly, use a gentle wood cleaner—avoid harsh chemicals, as they can damage the finish.

# 6. Avoid Excessive Weight

Heavy objects, like large vases or thick stacks of books, can leave dents or even cause the wood to crack. Try to distribute weight evenly across the surface and avoid placing heavy items directly on the wood for extended periods.

# 7. Use Felt Pads or Furniture Sliders

If you're moving chairs or other furniture around, make sure to use felt pads or sliders on the legs. These can prevent scratches from occurring when furniture is moved. It’s a simple and inexpensive way to protect your wood table from damage.",1,1763087014.0,Tribewood,0,1.0,False

Now My Missing Friend Won’t Stop Texting Me.,"I’m typing this in my room with the blinds open and every light on, and it still feels like the dark in here is thicker than it should be.

My friend’s face is stuck in the last frame of a video I can’t make myself delete.

If you live near Fairview, you’ve probably heard of Parkland Corporate Center. It’s the half-finished office park off I-27, just past the shuttered Shell station and the dark Staples sign near the Tractor Supply. Three buildings, two stories each, all glass and concrete in a crooked U around a parking lot that’s slowly turning back into a field.

The sign by the road still says:

PARKLAND CORPORATE CENTER
LEASING INQUIRIES: 555-0189

I called that number once on a dare. It plays a recorded voice that says “A leasing agent will be avail—” and then just cuts out. No beep, no menu, nothing. It’s been like that for years.

They started building Parkland before the 2008 crash and just… stopped. The county threw up a sagging chain across the entrance and a NO TRESPASSING sign on one post. That’s the extent of security.

Everyone just calls it Parkland.

Everyone says not to go there at night.

We went anyway.

There were three of us: me (Caleb), Mason, and Tyler.

We’re not “urban explorer” people with channels or merch. We’re just idiots who get bored and decide that driving to empty places with flashlights beats another night of yelling at each other in Discord.

We’d been to Parkland twice before, both times in the afternoon. Creepy, yeah, but bearable with sunlight coming through the glass and traffic noise drifting in from the highway.

This time was different.

Mason brought it up at lunch. He dropped his tray down across from me and Tyler, grinning the way he does when he knows he’s about to say something dumb and try to sell it as fun.

“Night run,” he said. “Parkland. Tonight.”

Tyler poked at his fries. “We already did Parkland,” he said. “It was just carpet and sad office chairs.”

“At three in the afternoon,” Mason said. “You know how many jump scares happen at three in the afternoon? Zero. You’ve gotta see it in the dark.”

He talks with his hands, like he’s always mid-story. Teachers like him even when he’s late. He gets away with stuff.

“My mom’s on closing shift at Kroger tonight,” I said. “She won’t be home until eleven. If I text her that I’m at your house, she won’t check.”

Tyler looked between us for a second.

“My parents are on nights. Again,” he said. “I just have to be home before school. But we stick together this time. No leaving anybody in creepy bathrooms, I’m not playing that game again.”

Mason put a hand over his heart. “Scout’s honor. I was never a scout, but still.”

We met up in my driveway around nine. October air, cold enough to see your breath if you exhaled hard. Street was quiet except for one dog barking down the block.

Mason’s Civic is an ’09 silver with a crack in the windshield he hides under a parking permit. There’s an I BRAKE FOR NOBODY sticker peeling off his bumper that he thinks is way funnier than it is.

Tyler got in the front with this big black Maglite between his knees. I took the back.

“You bring your light?” Mason asked me, backing out.

“Yeah,” I said, tapping my pocket. Little LED on my keys. “You bring bolt cutters?”

He snorted. “You think I have bolt-cutter money? Nah. Chain’s low. I checked.”

I believe him, because that’s the kind of thing he actually does.

We rolled past the closed Starbucks and the 24-hour CVS on Maple, then hit the on-ramp. The radio was down low, someone talking about used trucks. I watched the green exit signs go by: 25, 26, 27.

Mason took Exit 27. Instead of heading right toward the strip with Tractor Supply and the empty Staples, he turned left, down the darker road that passes fields and one lonely sodium streetlight humming like a bug zapper.

“Ty, you know people say someone died out there, right?” he said, because of course he did.

“People say someone died everywhere,” Tyler said, not looking up from his phone. “There’s probably a guy on Reddit right now writing, ‘I Worked the Graveyard Shift at CVS. The Pills Weren’t the Scariest Thing.’”

“He’d get, like, five thousand upvotes,” I said.

We laughed. It came out thin.

The Parkland sign appeared on the right, half-covered by branches. Our headlights lit the blue logo and the dead number, then it slid by and we turned in at the next gap.

The road changed under us as soon as we left the highway shoulder. Smooth asphalt became cracked pavement with grass spearing through. The chain across the entrance sagged between two concrete posts, a rusted padlock hanging from one side like an earring.

“Security theater,” Mason said. He stopped, got out, and lifted the chain. It scraped across the hood. I ducked even though I was inside.

“A little higher,” I said.

“Yeah, yeah.”

He eased the car under. Once we were past, he dropped the chain behind us. It clanged off the bumper and settled somewhere in the weeds.

The lot swallowed us up.

It was darker in there than I expected. The trees along the road block most of the town glow, so once you’re inside, it’s just our headlights and black glass and concrete.

Building A was straight ahead. B and C angled off, making that crooked U. Their fronts were mostly glass, some of it smashed. Graffiti covered the doors and lower panels: white tags, silver crowns, and a few detailed red things that looked like someone had practiced drawing organs.

Mason killed the headlights but let the engine idle for a second. The world outside the car turned into shapes and reflections.

“No turning them back on and flooring it just to freak us out,” Tyler said, pre-emptively.

“I’m saving the battery,” Mason said. After a beat, he shut the engine off. The ticking of the cooling engine sounded too loud.

Ty clicked on the Maglite. The beam cut across the lot—cracked parking lines, strong grass, Building A’s front steps. The glass doors had aluminum push bars. One pane was cracked through, the other intact but buried under spray paint.

“Fifteen minutes,” Tyler said. “In and out.”

“We drove all the way out here for fifteen minutes?” Mason said.

“It was boring in the day,” Tyler said. “We’re not camping inside.”

“Twenty,” Mason tried.

“Seventeen,” I said. “Split it.”

He rolled his eyes. “Seventeen minutes of terror. Let’s go.”

I was the last one out. When the dome light clicked off, the dark pushed in immediately.

Tyler swung the Maglite up toward the front of the building—and caught something in a second-floor window.

I stopped walking.

“What?” he asked.

“I thought I saw… somebody up there,” I said, pointing at the far-right window.

All three of us looked up.

Just our stretched reflections looked back: three figures and the white beam, the Civic behind us.

“Maybe don’t start with that,” Mason said. But he checked the window one more time before turning away.

He pulled one of the glass doors. It creaked, but opened. No alarm, no emergency lights. Just a dead lobby smell.

Inside, the air was thicker. Damp carpet, old dust, something sour underneath, like maybe a drain had been backing up somewhere for a decade. There was a fake fern in a corner, its leaves gray under a skin of dust. A reception desk sat with its monitor smashed in.

Our footsteps echoed up into the second floor.

“Kill the light for a sec,” Mason said.

Tyler did.

Instant difference. Without the beam, you notice how little ambient light is actually getting in. Just a faint glow from the glass behind us and some ghost rectangles where windows must be upstairs. The building had its own little noises: a drip somewhere, a distant crack.

“Okay, no,” Tyler said, snapping the Maglite back on.

The beam jumped, and that’s when we noticed the white powder on the floor near the base of the stairs.

Someone had emptied a fire extinguisher across the tiles since we’d last been here. A dusting of white spread in a fan shape.

Footprints went straight through it.

I don’t know how we missed them at first. Once you see them, they’re all you see.

They were long. Too long. Narrow heel, deep arch, and at the front, four thick ovals, each one ending in a deeper pit like something had dug in.

“Dog?” I said, even though I knew better.

“Dogs have five toes and pads,” Tyler said, quietly. “And their tracks don’t look like they’ve been… punched in.”

“Fake shoe,” Mason said. He crouched, smeared a little of the powder away with the back of his fingers. The dust moved. The depth of the indent didn’t. “Like, some idiot made a monster boot to freak people out.”

“Then why walk in a straight line and peace out?” Tyler asked. He was right. The prints came from the doors, clean through the powder, and headed toward the elevator lobby and the stairs. No wandering, no pacing.

They disappeared where the light fell off.

“Up?” Mason said.

“We’re sticking together,” Tyler reminded him.

“We are,” Mason said. “We just… stick together upstairs and then stick together out. I don’t love the idea of walking back across that.”

He wasn’t wrong. I didn’t want to be between those prints and the only exit either.

We went up.

The second floor always felt like time had stopped mid-sentence.

Downstairs was empty space. Up here, it felt like everyone had just stood up and walked away at once. Desks, some with family photos facedown under a fuzz of dust. Swivel chairs, a few rolled out into the middle of the floor like someone had pushed away from their computer too hard. Whiteboards with half-erased bullet points: Q3 TARGETS, CLIENT PUSHBACK, ONBOARDING. The calendar by the stairwell stopped at August 2009. Tuesday the 18th was circled.

A dry-erase marker lay on the whiteboard’s metal tray, cap off, tip dried to nothing. Someone had drawn a smiley face next to the word TEAM.

Tyler’s beam slid over all of that, then down to the carpet.

The prints were up here too. Same long, four-toed shape pressed into the old gray fibers, marching down the main hall.

The air had that attic heaviness. Like dust had a weight now.

We passed an office with a nameplate: C. BURTON – HR. Inside, a mug that said WORLD’S OKAYEST BOSS was on its side, something green and furry blooming out of it. There was a “SAFETY FIRST – 1,234 DAYS WITHOUT INCIDENT” poster on the wall. Somebody had written LIARS across it in ballpoint pen.

“You ever think about how nobody came back for their mugs?” Tyler said quietly. “Or their pictures?”

“They probably boxed it all up one day and dumped it in storage,” Mason said. He sounded like he was repeating something he’d read online.

We were stalling. The prints kept going.

The hallway narrowed as we turned a corner, ceiling lower, EXIT signs hanging dead and crooked. The emergency stairs were at the end: red metal door, narrow glass window.

In daylight, it had just been a door.

Now it felt like a closed throat.

Tyler swung the Maglite down the hall and stopped.

Something was in front of the door.

At first it was just a vertical strip of darker dark, like a piece of the hallway had thickened. Tall. Hunched a little. For a second I thought it might be some abandoned coat rack or a plant we never noticed.

Then it shifted its weight. Not much. Just enough that the beam picked up the side of something pale.

Tyler inhaled sharply and snapped the light toward it.

Nothing.

The hallway was empty. Just the door and the dust.

“Tell me you saw that,” he whispered.

“Yeah,” I said.

Mason stared down at the door. “Glass,” he said, more to himself than to us. “Reflection. Look.”

We walked a few more steps. The prints led right up to the push bar, then doubled back, like whatever made them had stood there a while and then decided to go elsewhere.

The glass showed us the way glass is supposed to: three pale faces, one bright circle of light.

We watched ourselves for a few seconds.

Something hit the door from the other side.

Not full-force. Just a sharp thump that made the metal shudder and the push bar rattle.

Tyler jumped back into me. The beam flared across the ceiling.

“What was that?” he asked. His voice had gone thin.

“Wind on the stairs,” Mason said immediately, which didn’t explain anything. “Or… or something fell.”

The second hit was harder. The hollow clang rattled through the frame.

Then I heard it: a sound right against the glass, muffled but close. Not words. Just a slow, heavy exhale, the kind you can feel in your own throat when someone does it near your ear.

We didn’t stand there debating.

Mason grabbed Tyler’s sleeve. “Back down,” he said. “Now.”

We went back the way we came, way faster. The hall felt longer. The cone of light shook and picked out details we’d missed—an office chair turned perfectly to face the door, a phone receiver dangling off a desk, a brown handprint-shaped stain low on the wall that I hope was coffee and will never know for sure.

Halfway to the stairs, the Maglite beam hit a doorway.

There was a small office inside. Bare desk, rolling chair, file cabinet with one drawer half-open.

Something was behind the door.

I didn’t see all of it. Just enough through the gap to know it wasn’t a trick of light. Four long fingers wrapped around the wood, pressing into it. They flexed once—smooth, no hesitation—and slipped back out of sight.

My feet stopped by themselves.

“Caleb,” Tyler hissed. “Move.”

I did. I didn’t look back in.

At the stairs, I almost expected the powder to be exactly the same. It wasn’t.

The original prints were still there, but now there were more. Newer. Edges clearer. They led from the lobby toward the stairwell, overlapped some of our shoe marks, and stopped on the lowest step, just to the left of where my foot came down.

We all froze.

The surface of the powder shifted.

Not from us. We hadn’t moved.

A thin line appeared in the dust, like something invisible dragging a fingertip through it. It curved, looped, then straightened.

Letters.

Not neat. But readable.

NO

Tyler made a noise that was half-laugh, half-whimper.

“Okay,” Mason said. His voice was too loud in the stairwell. “Nope. Fine. Upstairs. Window. We are not walking through that lobby.”

The Maglite flickered.

Once.

Twice.

Then it cut out completely.

Everything went black. No slow fade. Just there one second, gone the next.

I heard Tyler slam the flashlight against the railing. “Come on. Come on.”

No light.

My fingers were already on my phone. I mashed the side button. The screen lit up in my face, bluish and harsh.

Battery: 14%.

I know it had been over 60% when we parked. I check my battery all the time. It’s a habit.

“Up,” Mason said. The dragging sound from the lobby came again, closer now, wet and steady. “Go.”

We went up.

Back on the second floor, my phone turned the hallway into a narrow, jittery tunnel. Beyond it, everything was just shape and suggestion.

“Conference room,” Tyler said. “Big window, faces the lot. We can jump.”

We’d joked about that window the last time we were here. “Emergency exit if the elevator ghosts get mad,” Mason had said. It hadn’t been funny then either.

I kept the phone angled down toward our feet. I didn’t want to see what might be standing ahead of us until I had to.

We passed more offices. My light caught on little things—the blinking red LED on an emergency exit sign that somehow still had power, a pen stuck point-first into a corkboard, a ring of something crusted on the carpet like a cup had been dropped there and never cleaned up.

Something moved behind one of the glass walls at the edge of the light. I saw it in my peripheral vision and refused to turn my head. If I didn’t give it my full attention, part of me could pretend it wasn’t there.

The conference room door was half-open. Tyler shoved it in and we crowded inside.

Long table. Twelve chairs. Whiteboard with PIPELINE and STRATEGY ghosts still faintly there. A dry marker lay on the tray, drowned in gray dust.

The window filled almost the whole far wall. From here, the parking lot looked flat and small. The Civic was a dark chunk in the darkness. The chain at the entrance was a faint line.

For about half a second, that view helped. Then the dragging sound out in the hall scraped a little closer.

Mason went to the window. There was a latch at the top. He worked it loose and pushed. The glass moved outward a few inches and stopped against some ancient limiter.

“Of course,” he muttered.

“Break it,” Tyler said.

Mason dragged one of the chairs over, metal legs screeching on the floor. “Stand back.”

He swung the chair into the glass. The boom made my ears ring. Cracks spidered out, but the pane held.

“Again,” Tyler said. He kept looking back at the door.

The dragging outside paused. Then started again, slower.

On the third hit, the glass gave. It blew outward in a shower of shards. Some fell in, some fell out. Cold air rushed in, tasting like wet weeds, asphalt, and something metal.

Mason kicked at the remaining jagged pieces, knocking them loose. Tiny fragments tinkled down to the bushes below.

“Feet first,” he said. “Story and a half. Bend your knees. I’ll go first.”

My phone buzzed in my hand.

A banner flashed at the top: New Voicemail – Unknown.

I stuffed the phone into my hoodie pocket.

Mason climbed onto the sill, one leg out. He looked back at us once. His pupils were huge.

“Don’t look down,” Tyler said.

“Already did,” Mason said, and went. The bushes rustled. “I’m good. Go.”

Tyler climbed up next. “If I break my ankle—” he started, then just dropped. There was a thump and a muted, “Ow. I’m fine. Caleb.”

The scraping outside the conference room door stopped.

I didn’t look at it.

I hauled myself up onto the sill. Broken glass scratched my shin. I felt warmth spread under my jeans, but there was no time to care.

My phone vibrated again as I pushed off.

Branches hit my sides. Then ground. I rolled, came up, and saw the Civic.

“Run!” Mason yelled.

We ran.

We tore across the lot, tripping, pushing off each other, not even pretending to be coordinated. Gravel slid out under my shoes. The air felt too cold in my throat.

Something hit the building behind us. A deep impact. Dust puffed off the top edge of the wall. Another hit followed, lower down, closer.

Tyler reached the car first and yanked the back door open. We piled in. Mason nearly dropped the keys, but got them in the ignition. The engine coughed and then roared.

Headlights flared on.

They swept across Building A, across the broken second-floor window.

For one long second, I saw fingers hooked over the cracked frame from the inside. Four of them. Gray-white, too long, joints bent in ways they shouldn’t bend. They tightened as the light hit them.

A face leaned into the light behind them.

Eyes with no pupils, just cloudy white. Skin that looked thin and stretched. A mouth that opened too far, full of teeth that didn’t match each other, like they’d been stolen from different jaws.

Then the car whipped around, the headlights swung away, and it was gone.

Mason slammed it into reverse, backed up in a wide arc that nearly took us into a light pole, then dropped it into drive and headed for the chain.

He didn’t slow. The chain snapped off one post, smacked the hood, and flipped out of the way.

We hit the smoother road and nobody talked for a solid minute. The radio was still on, some commercial about tires leaking into the silence like it belonged to another universe.

“Did you guys see—” Tyler started.

“Nope,” Mason said fast. “Saw nothing. We’re never going there again.”

“You saw it,” Tyler said, turning to look at me. “Right?”

“Yeah,” I said. There wasn’t any point in pretending. “I saw something.”

We dropped Tyler off on Maple. His porch light is the really bright motion one his dad installed after the mailbox-smashing thing two years ago. It made his front yard look like a set for a local commercial.

“You gonna tell them?” I asked, nodding toward his house.

“And say what?” he asked. “That we trespassed and got chased by… whatever that was? My dad would kill me before the monster got a chance.”

He tried to smile. It didn’t land properly.

“If you get anything weird,” he said. “Texts. Calls. I don’t care what time it is. Call me.”

“Same,” I said.

Mason just tapped the steering wheel.

We waited until his front door opened and closed behind him. Then Mason took me home.

“You sleeping?” he asked, as we turned onto my street.

“I’ll pretend to,” I said.

“Yeah,” he said. “Same.”

He stopped at my curb. I got out, leaning back in for a second.

“We’re not going back there,” I said.

“For once, I agree with you,” he said.

I shut the door.

Walking up my driveway, I noticed white dust on my shoelaces. I caught myself about to scrape them off on the grass, then didn’t. I don’t know why. It felt like admitting something.

Inside, I locked the deadbolt and slid the chain on. Mom was already in bed; I could hear the low hum of her fan upstairs.

In my room, I finally looked at my phone.

There was a notification I’d missed while we were running.

New Voicemail – Unknown Caller – 10:42 PM

The timestamp meant it had hit while we were still inside Parkland.

I sat on the edge of my bed and hit play.

Static. Low and constant. Under it, something like wet fabric being pulled across tile. Then my own voice, distorted but definitely me:

“Run, Caleb.”

Hearing your own name in your own voice, coming from somewhere you didn’t speak, is a special kind of wrong.

The message cut off after thirteen seconds.

I didn’t play it again. I saved it, put the phone face-down on my desk, and went to the bathroom to clean the cut on my leg. The soap smelled like cheap hotel bars. White dust from Parkland flaked off my jeans onto the tile. I kicked it into the corner by the plunger.

I told myself I was fine.

I wasn’t. But my brain tapped out anyway and I slept.

Waking up was worse.

My alarm ripped me out of some blurry nightmare about an elevator that wouldn’t stop. For a second, staring at my ceiling, I was just tired and annoyed.

Then everything crashed back.

The cut on my leg stung when I swung out of bed. There was a smear of pale dust on my pillowcase where my hoodie sleeve had been.

My phone was on my nightstand. Battery: 93%.

There were four notifications. Two were from school and some group chat. The other two were from Tyler.

Both were timestamped 3:14 a.m.

I opened the thread.

First message: a photo.

It looked black at first glance. I cranked the brightness and tilted the screen.

A hallway came into view. Not exactly Parkland’s, but close enough that my stomach clenched. Narrow, grimy, fluorescent light at the far end, flickering. The floor was streaked with something dark and wet, reflecting that bad light in dull lines.

On the right side of the frame, close to the camera, a pale shape was pressed against the wall.

An arm. Too long. The joint bent wrong. Four fingers spread flat, the tips ending in curved, dark nails dug into the paint.

Second message: text.

it knows your name

My thumb hovered over the keyboard.

I hit call instead.

It rang twice. Then the canned voice: “The wireless customer you are trying to reach is unavailable.”

I hung up. Tried again. Same thing.

I went downstairs. Mom was in the kitchen, hair damp, pouring coffee into her travel mug.

“You look rough,” she said. “You and Mason stay up all night?”

“Tyler texted me something at like three,” I said. “Some weird picture. I thought it was a joke.”

Her phone buzzed on the counter. She glanced at it.

Her face went tight.

“Oh, God,” she said quietly.

“What?” I asked.

“It’s a message from the school,” she said. “They’re saying one of your classmates is missing.” She looked at the screen. “A boy named… Tyler Jameson.”

The room tilted.

“Missing how?” I asked.

“It just says he didn’t come home last night and his parents reported it,” she said. “They want anyone who saw him after school to contact the police.”

“We walked around town,” I heard myself say. “Me, him, and Mason. But Mason dropped him off. I saw him go up to his porch.”

I did not say the word Parkland.

“If the police come by, you tell them everything,” she said. “I don’t care if you get in trouble for being somewhere you aren’t supposed to be. Understand?”

My phone buzzed in my hand.

New text from Tyler.

come back

A second one hit right after.

bring him

It came with a photo.

I opened it.

This one was brighter. The flash had gone off. The picture was blown out in the middle.

It showed… pieces. That’s the only way I can describe it. Torn strips of skinless meat piled wrong on a floor I couldn’t completely place. Muscle and fat, white bone glimpses. Nothing where it should be. You know when puzzle pieces almost fit but don’t? It looked like that, but with a person.

Near the top right corner, there was a scrap of dark blue fabric with white stitching. Tyler’s hoodie had looked exactly like that when he got out of the Civic.

At the very bottom edge of the photo, almost cut off, four gray fingers curled into view. Just the tips.

While I was staring, my battery dropped from 93% to 68%.

My hand shook. Coffee sloshed out of Mom’s mug onto the counter.

“What is it?” she asked.

Before I could answer, my phone buzzed again.

New text.

answer the door

“The door?” I said out loud before my brain caught up.

The doorbell rang.

Mom frowned. “They must be going house to house,” she said. “Stay here, okay?”

“Wait—” I started.

But she was already heading down the hall. I heard the deadbolt slide, the chain rattle, the door open.

Voices filtered in. Two male, one female. Serious, low.

“Good morning, Ms. Dorn,” a man said. “Sorry to wake you. We’re following up about your son’s friend, Tyler Jameson.”

“Yes, of course, come in,” Mom said.

She called my name.

It felt like my feet belonged to someone else, but they carried me down the hall anyway.

Two officers stood in the entryway. One tall with tired eyes, one shorter. A woman in plain clothes with a badge on her belt stood behind them.

“Morning, Caleb,” the taller one said. “I’m Officer Reyes. This is Officer Nolan. This is Detective Hsu. We’re trying to piece together where Tyler was last seen.”

He had a clipboard with papers clipped over one of my school photos.

“Your mom says you were with him after school,” Hsu said. Her voice wasn’t unkind, but there was no room in it.

My phone buzzed again in my hand.

“Yeah,” I said. “We just… hung out. Drove around.”

“Where?” Nolan asked.

“Maple. Broad. Near the Shell,” I said. “We didn’t go far.”

It was a half-truth. The worst kind.

“What time did you last see him?” Reyes asked.

“Around ten,” I said. “A little after. Mason dropped him off and I watched him walk up to his porch.”

“Did he say he was going anywhere else?” Hsu asked.

“No,” I said. “He just said he had to be home before midnight. His parents are strict.”

My phone buzzed in my hand again.

A banner flashed at the top: we can hear you.

The preview vanished as quickly as it appeared.

“Would you mind if we look at your texts with him from last night?” Reyes asked. “It helps us get a timeline.”

I thought about saying no. Saying my phone was dead. Saying I’d left it upstairs.

I unlocked it instead, opened the thread, and scrolled up past the worst of it so that memes and homework questions were at the top, then handed it over.

He read silently, lips moving a little. I watched his face go from neutral to mildly amused at some stupid meme, back to neutral when he hit the 3:14 a.m. photo. His eyebrows pulled in.

“What’s this?” he asked, angling it so Detective Hsu could see.

“I woke up and saw it,” I said. “I thought it was from some horror site. I was going to text him and ask what it was, but then Mom got the school alert and you guys showed up.”

Reyes zoomed in. Zoomed back out. Passed the phone to Hsu.

“Looks like fake gore,” she said, after a glance. “Plenty of that online.”

“Kids send each other that kind of thing,” Nolan said, almost to himself. “Shock pictures. Part of the culture.”

None of them were seeing what I was seeing. Or if they were, they were choosing to file it under “prank.”

Reyes scrolled down. He stopped just before the “come back” and “bring him” texts and handed the phone back.

“Did you receive anything after this?” Hsu asked.

“Those two you didn’t get to,” I said. “While you were here. I haven’t really read them.”

“Don’t delete any of it,” Reyes said. He took a card from his pocket and held it out. “If you get anything else from this number, or related to Tyler at all, call this right away. Even if it seems dumb, okay?”

“Okay,” I said.

They asked more questions. Did Tyler seem upset. Was he fighting with anyone. Did he talk about running away. I said no until the word sounded wrong.

They left eventually. The door closed behind them with a soft click.

Mom turned to me. “If there’s anything you didn’t tell them because you were scared you’d get in trouble—”

“I know,” I said.

She went back to the kitchen, already calling her manager on speaker.

I stood in the hall.

My phone buzzed.

New text from Tyler.

we’re close

The battery dropped from 68% to 39% as I watched.

There was another photo attached. I took it to my room before I opened it. I don’t know why that mattered, but it did.

On my bed, with the door half-shut, I looked.

The picture was of my street.

Taken from low to the ground, like whoever took it was crouching or lying in the middle of the road. The angle made the houses lean in a bit. You could see the maple tree in our yard, the cracked sidewalk with the uneven patch where the city painted over some old graffiti a couple summers ago, the Honda my neighbor always parks halfway across the line.

And my house.

My bedroom window.

The curtains were open. You could see a figure sitting on the bed inside, head bent over a phone.

Me.

The timestamp said it had been taken less than a minute before I opened it.

I hadn’t left my room.

The text under it said:

don’t make us ask again

The chips I’d grabbed from the kitchen slipped out of my lap and spilled across the floor.

Battery: 21%.

I called Mason. It went straight to voicemail. His greeting was the dumb old one: “Hey, it’s Mason. If I don’t call you back, it’s because I don’t like you. Kidding. Maybe.”

I hung up. Texted him: Pick up. It’s about Tyler. About Parkland.

No reply.

Mom knocked on my door. “They’ve got something about Tyler on Channel 7,” she said through it. “If you want to—”

“I’ve got homework,” I said, too fast.

She hesitated. “Okay. I’ll call you if they say anything important.”

The TV clicked on downstairs. Bits of the news filtered up through the floor.

“…last seen by friends…”

“…dark blue hoodie…”

“…urging anyone with information…”

My phone buzzed again.

New text from Tyler.

last chance

15 minutes

It came with a video.

I told myself I wouldn’t open it.

I did.

It started in motion and blur. Gray walls, jerky movements. The camera stabilized just enough to make me wish it hadn’t.

The angle was low, pointed down the upper hallway of Building A. I’d know that T-junction anywhere now. Conference room door on the right, red emergency exit at the end. No lights except a smear of gray from the broken window.

Tyler stood in the hallway, maybe twenty feet away. Facing the camera.

His hoodie was shredded and hanging in strips. There were dark stains all over his chest and arms. His stance was wrong—too stiff, like he was being held up by strings that didn’t quite understand how joints worked.

He raised one hand. It shook like it was heavy.

He beckoned.

“Caleb,” he said.

It was his voice and not his voice. Like someone had recorded him through an aquarium pump. Wet and burbling, but I could hear his cadence underneath the distortion.

The camera shifted. There was a scrape behind it, like fingernails along drywall.

Tyler’s eyes flicked past the lens to whatever was behind it. For a second, pure terror pushed through whatever else had hold of him.

“Don’t,” he said quickly. “It—”

The video blurred. The camera spun. For a fraction of a second, the frame caught something tall and jointed crowding the left side of the hall, too close, too much limb for the space.

Then the image smeared into gray blocks, like a file corrupting.

The last clear frame was Tyler’s face, too close. His mouth open too wide, eyes not looking at the camera, but at something behind it. Or behind me. It’s hard to explain.

The video ended.

The progress bar said 00:09.

Battery: 9%.

I tried to save the video to send it to Reyes. A little spinning circle appeared, then an error: FILE NOT FOUND.

The entire message thread blinked. Every bubble turned into an empty outline, then popped back in.

All except the video.

It was just gone. No “failed to download,” no placeholder. Like it had never been there.

The last text in the thread now was:

we’re not done yet

My voicemail icon lit again: 1 New Message – Unknown Caller – 7:22 AM.

I haven’t played that one. Not yet.

I know what I’m supposed to do. Call Reyes. Show him the photos I still have. Hand him my phone, admit we lied about Parkland, deal with whatever comes after.

I’m going to.

But I wanted this written somewhere else first. Somewhere that isn’t just my phone. I watched my phone chew up a video and spit out an error message. I don’t trust it.

I also wanted to warn anyone near here who thinks Parkland is just another “creepy abandoned spot” to film TikToks in.

Something in that building walks around on four-toed feet and spells words in extinguisher dust. It knows how to use a phone number that belongs to a kid whose parents are probably standing in his empty room right now. It can show you your own street from angles nobody’s standing at. It can send you your own voice.

It told us NO when we tried to go back through the lobby. I keep thinking about that. I don’t know if it meant “no, you can’t leave” or “no, don’t go that way.” Either way, we didn’t listen. We punched a window and jumped.

If you’ve been out there and you’ve still got white powder on your shoes or glass dust in your hoodie, pay attention to your notifications tonight.

If you see something from a number that should be off, or from a friend who’s missing, or with a picture of where you are right now taken from somewhere you aren’t—

Don’t open it. Or do, and then call someone immediately. Not just your group chat.

My battery says 5% even though it’s been plugged into the wall since I started typing this. The charging icon keeps flicking on and off.

Someone just rang the doorbell again.

Mom thinks it’s a neighbor bringing food, or the cops coming back with more questions.

The last text I got—one I haven’t opened yet—just popped up on my lock screen.

From Tyler.

Maybe 30 or 20......?,"I’m on day 19 of what was supposed to be a 40-day fast. I went to my doctor for bloodwork and a vitals check, and I was advised to stop the fast because it was considered unhealthy and dangerous due to the rapid weight loss and the risks associated with re-feeding. It was very discouraging.

I’m about 40 years old and started at around 318 lbs. I’ve been on high blood pressure medication for the past few years and haven’t felt good carrying the excess weight. I’m currently down about 40 pounds and feel amazing. I’ve been taking Re-Lyte Hydration Electrolyte Powder Mix or salt, potassium powder, and magnesium powder. I’m considering adding zinc, B1, and small amounts of creatine.

I’m drinking about a gallon of water a day along with some tea and sparkling mineral water. I’ve been working out almost every day. I feel great, and I’ve lost enough weight that I’m fitting into clothes I haven’t worn in years. I feel focused, calm, and energized. My sleep has been interesting — I have so much energy that I sometimes have trouble sleeping. Occasionally I wake up in the middle of the night, go to the gym, then return to sleep afterward.

In 19 days I’ve only felt a little hunger. When that happened, I took some salt on my tongue, added water, and the hunger went away. I tried coffee, but I felt like I didn’t need more energy. I also chewed sugar-free gum once — I rinsed it under water first to reduce any potential insulin response.

I spend time with others while they eat, and it doesn’t bother me. I still doom-scroll endless recipes I plan to make when I’m eating again.

I am considering shortening my fast — ending it on Monday the 17th and starting the re-feeding process: beginning with watered-down broth, then moving to regular broth, soft foods, and maybe a full meal a day or two later.

* Capresso Grinder $100, 5yrs old.  
* 2025 Bambino Plus Refurb using unpressurized basket it came with.

The grinder manual says to use the ""Extra Fine"" settings for Espressos. This worked just fine with my former $75 DeLonghi ECP3630 (entry-level machine with pressurized basket). Also, that machine seemed to produce more consistent tastin espresso and was much less sensitive to grind size, tamp pressure, grams of coffee, etc.

Any of the ""Extra Fine"" settings will choke the Bambino Plus. I have to use ""Fine"" which actually looks relatively coarse for an Espresso grind. However, when using ""Fine"" ground coffee, the espresso lacks the concentration, thickness and depth of flavor I have experienced at coffee shops. Its tastes just about the same as it did with my prior cheap DeLonghi machine and its pressurized basket. 

To rule out the issue being the beans, over the months I've varied greatly by using light, medium, & dark roasts. I also tried locally roasted beans, Costco beans from a local roaster, Costco beans from Peru, Whole Foods 365 house brand freshly roasted beans, etc etc etc. Same result irrespective of bean. 

Also, even when using one of the ""Fine"" settings, if I tamp firmly it will STILL choke the Bambino which is crazy. This is already a relatively coarse grind for Espresso. 

Here I thought I ""upgraded"" to a Bambino Plus, what gives? Is my refurb Bambino defective and not producing enough pressure? Is this a characteristic of using a non-pressurized basket? Is there even a way to test the Bambino's pressure to ensure its working properly? 

Anybody got a Bambino Plus out here in Reddit Coffee Country and can shed some light?

Now My Missing Friend Won’t Stop Texting Me.,"I’m typing this in my room with the blinds open and every light on, and it still feels like the dark in here is thicker than it should be.

My friend’s face is stuck in the last frame of a video I can’t make myself delete.

If you live near Fairview, you’ve probably heard of Parkland Corporate Center. It’s the half-finished office park off I-27, just past the shuttered Shell station and the dark Staples sign near the Tractor Supply. Three buildings, two stories each, all glass and concrete in a crooked U around a parking lot that’s slowly turning back into a field.

The sign by the road still says:

PARKLAND CORPORATE CENTER
LEASING INQUIRIES: 555-0189

I called that number once on a dare. It plays a recorded voice that says “A leasing agent will be avail—” and then just cuts out. No beep, no menu, nothing. It’s been like that for years.

They started building Parkland before the 2008 crash and just… stopped. The county threw up a sagging chain across the entrance and a NO TRESPASSING sign on one post. That’s the extent of security.

Everyone just calls it Parkland.

Everyone says not to go there at night.

We went anyway.

There were three of us: me (Caleb), Mason, and Tyler.

We’re not “urban explorer” people with channels or merch. We’re just idiots who get bored and decide that driving to empty places with flashlights beats another night of yelling at each other in Discord.

We’d been to Parkland twice before, both times in the afternoon. Creepy, yeah, but bearable with sunlight coming through the glass and traffic noise drifting in from the highway.

This time was different.

Mason brought it up at lunch. He dropped his tray down across from me and Tyler, grinning the way he does when he knows he’s about to say something dumb and try to sell it as fun.

“Night run,” he said. “Parkland. Tonight.”

Tyler poked at his fries. “We already did Parkland,” he said. “It was just carpet and sad office chairs.”

“At three in the afternoon,” Mason said. “You know how many jump scares happen at three in the afternoon? Zero. You’ve gotta see it in the dark.”

He talks with his hands, like he’s always mid-story. Teachers like him even when he’s late. He gets away with stuff.

“My mom’s on closing shift at Kroger tonight,” I said. “She won’t be home until eleven. If I text her that I’m at your house, she won’t check.”

Tyler looked between us for a second.

“My parents are on nights. Again,” he said. “I just have to be home before school. But we stick together this time. No leaving anybody in creepy bathrooms, I’m not playing that game again.”

Mason put a hand over his heart. “Scout’s honor. I was never a scout, but still.”

We met up in my driveway around nine. October air, cold enough to see your breath if you exhaled hard. Street was quiet except for one dog barking down the block.

Mason’s Civic is an ’09 silver with a crack in the windshield he hides under a parking permit. There’s an I BRAKE FOR NOBODY sticker peeling off his bumper that he thinks is way funnier than it is.

Tyler got in the front with this big black Maglite between his knees. I took the back.

“You bring your light?” Mason asked me, backing out.

“Yeah,” I said, tapping my pocket. Little LED on my keys. “You bring bolt cutters?”

He snorted. “You think I have bolt-cutter money? Nah. Chain’s low. I checked.”

I believe him, because that’s the kind of thing he actually does.

We rolled past the closed Starbucks and the 24-hour CVS on Maple, then hit the on-ramp. The radio was down low, someone talking about used trucks. I watched the green exit signs go by: 25, 26, 27.

Mason took Exit 27. Instead of heading right toward the strip with Tractor Supply and the empty Staples, he turned left, down the darker road that passes fields and one lonely sodium streetlight humming like a bug zapper.

“Ty, you know people say someone died out there, right?” he said, because of course he did.

“People say someone died everywhere,” Tyler said, not looking up from his phone. “There’s probably a guy on Reddit right now writing, ‘I Worked the Graveyard Shift at CVS. The Pills Weren’t the Scariest Thing.’”

“He’d get, like, five thousand upvotes,” I said.

We laughed. It came out thin.

The Parkland sign appeared on the right, half-covered by branches. Our headlights lit the blue logo and the dead number, then it slid by and we turned in at the next gap.

The road changed under us as soon as we left the highway shoulder. Smooth asphalt became cracked pavement with grass spearing through. The chain across the entrance sagged between two concrete posts, a rusted padlock hanging from one side like an earring.

“Security theater,” Mason said. He stopped, got out, and lifted the chain. It scraped across the hood. I ducked even though I was inside.

“A little higher,” I said.

“Yeah, yeah.”

He eased the car under. Once we were past, he dropped the chain behind us. It clanged off the bumper and settled somewhere in the weeds.

The lot swallowed us up.

It was darker in there than I expected. The trees along the road block most of the town glow, so once you’re inside, it’s just our headlights and black glass and concrete.

Building A was straight ahead. B and C angled off, making that crooked U. Their fronts were mostly glass, some of it smashed. Graffiti covered the doors and lower panels: white tags, silver crowns, and a few detailed red things that looked like someone had practiced drawing organs.

Mason killed the headlights but let the engine idle for a second. The world outside the car turned into shapes and reflections.

“No turning them back on and flooring it just to freak us out,” Tyler said, pre-emptively.

“I’m saving the battery,” Mason said. After a beat, he shut the engine off. The ticking of the cooling engine sounded too loud.

Ty clicked on the Maglite. The beam cut across the lot—cracked parking lines, strong grass, Building A’s front steps. The glass doors had aluminum push bars. One pane was cracked through, the other intact but buried under spray paint.

“Fifteen minutes,” Tyler said. “In and out.”

“We drove all the way out here for fifteen minutes?” Mason said.

“It was boring in the day,” Tyler said. “We’re not camping inside.”

“Twenty,” Mason tried.

“Seventeen,” I said. “Split it.”

He rolled his eyes. “Seventeen minutes of terror. Let’s go.”

I was the last one out. When the dome light clicked off, the dark pushed in immediately.

Tyler swung the Maglite up toward the front of the building—and caught something in a second-floor window.

I stopped walking.

“What?” he asked.

“I thought I saw… somebody up there,” I said, pointing at the far-right window.

All three of us looked up.

Just our stretched reflections looked back: three figures and the white beam, the Civic behind us.

“Maybe don’t start with that,” Mason said. But he checked the window one more time before turning away.

He pulled one of the glass doors. It creaked, but opened. No alarm, no emergency lights. Just a dead lobby smell.

Inside, the air was thicker. Damp carpet, old dust, something sour underneath, like maybe a drain had been backing up somewhere for a decade. There was a fake fern in a corner, its leaves gray under a skin of dust. A reception desk sat with its monitor smashed in.

Our footsteps echoed up into the second floor.

“Kill the light for a sec,” Mason said.

Tyler did.

Instant difference. Without the beam, you notice how little ambient light is actually getting in. Just a faint glow from the glass behind us and some ghost rectangles where windows must be upstairs. The building had its own little noises: a drip somewhere, a distant crack.

“Okay, no,” Tyler said, snapping the Maglite back on.

The beam jumped, and that’s when we noticed the white powder on the floor near the base of the stairs.

Someone had emptied a fire extinguisher across the tiles since we’d last been here. A dusting of white spread in a fan shape.

Footprints went straight through it.

I don’t know how we missed them at first. Once you see them, they’re all you see.

They were long. Too long. Narrow heel, deep arch, and at the front, four thick ovals, each one ending in a deeper pit like something had dug in.

“Dog?” I said, even though I knew better.

“Dogs have five toes and pads,” Tyler said, quietly. “And their tracks don’t look like they’ve been… punched in.”

“Fake shoe,” Mason said. He crouched, smeared a little of the powder away with the back of his fingers. The dust moved. The depth of the indent didn’t. “Like, some idiot made a monster boot to freak people out.”

“Then why walk in a straight line and peace out?” Tyler asked. He was right. The prints came from the doors, clean through the powder, and headed toward the elevator lobby and the stairs. No wandering, no pacing.

They disappeared where the light fell off.

“Up?” Mason said.

“We’re sticking together,” Tyler reminded him.

“We are,” Mason said. “We just… stick together upstairs and then stick together out. I don’t love the idea of walking back across that.”

He wasn’t wrong. I didn’t want to be between those prints and the only exit either.

We went up.

The second floor always felt like time had stopped mid-sentence.

Downstairs was empty space. Up here, it felt like everyone had just stood up and walked away at once. Desks, some with family photos facedown under a fuzz of dust. Swivel chairs, a few rolled out into the middle of the floor like someone had pushed away from their computer too hard. Whiteboards with half-erased bullet points: Q3 TARGETS, CLIENT PUSHBACK, ONBOARDING. The calendar by the stairwell stopped at August 2009. Tuesday the 18th was circled.

A dry-erase marker lay on the whiteboard’s metal tray, cap off, tip dried to nothing. Someone had drawn a smiley face next to the word TEAM.

Tyler’s beam slid over all of that, then down to the carpet.

The prints were up here too. Same long, four-toed shape pressed into the old gray fibers, marching down the main hall.

The air had that attic heaviness. Like dust had a weight now.

We passed an office with a nameplate: C. BURTON – HR. Inside, a mug that said WORLD’S OKAYEST BOSS was on its side, something green and furry blooming out of it. There was a “SAFETY FIRST – 1,234 DAYS WITHOUT INCIDENT” poster on the wall. Somebody had written LIARS across it in ballpoint pen.

“You ever think about how nobody came back for their mugs?” Tyler said quietly. “Or their pictures?”

“They probably boxed it all up one day and dumped it in storage,” Mason said. He sounded like he was repeating something he’d read online.

We were stalling. The prints kept going.

The hallway narrowed as we turned a corner, ceiling lower, EXIT signs hanging dead and crooked. The emergency stairs were at the end: red metal door, narrow glass window.

In daylight, it had just been a door.

Now it felt like a closed throat.

Tyler swung the Maglite down the hall and stopped.

Something was in front of the door.

At first it was just a vertical strip of darker dark, like a piece of the hallway had thickened. Tall. Hunched a little. For a second I thought it might be some abandoned coat rack or a plant we never noticed.

Then it shifted its weight. Not much. Just enough that the beam picked up the side of something pale.

Tyler inhaled sharply and snapped the light toward it.

Nothing.

The hallway was empty. Just the door and the dust.

“Tell me you saw that,” he whispered.

“Yeah,” I said.

Mason stared down at the door. “Glass,” he said, more to himself than to us. “Reflection. Look.”

We walked a few more steps. The prints led right up to the push bar, then doubled back, like whatever made them had stood there a while and then decided to go elsewhere.

The glass showed us the way glass is supposed to: three pale faces, one bright circle of light.

We watched ourselves for a few seconds.

Something hit the door from the other side.

Not full-force. Just a sharp thump that made the metal shudder and the push bar rattle.

Tyler jumped back into me. The beam flared across the ceiling.

“What was that?” he asked. His voice had gone thin.

“Wind on the stairs,” Mason said immediately, which didn’t explain anything. “Or… or something fell.”

The second hit was harder. The hollow clang rattled through the frame.

Then I heard it: a sound right against the glass, muffled but close. Not words. Just a slow, heavy exhale, the kind you can feel in your own throat when someone does it near your ear.

We didn’t stand there debating.

Mason grabbed Tyler’s sleeve. “Back down,” he said. “Now.”

We went back the way we came, way faster. The hall felt longer. The cone of light shook and picked out details we’d missed—an office chair turned perfectly to face the door, a phone receiver dangling off a desk, a brown handprint-shaped stain low on the wall that I hope was coffee and will never know for sure.

Halfway to the stairs, the Maglite beam hit a doorway.

There was a small office inside. Bare desk, rolling chair, file cabinet with one drawer half-open.

Something was behind the door.

I didn’t see all of it. Just enough through the gap to know it wasn’t a trick of light. Four long fingers wrapped around the wood, pressing into it. They flexed once—smooth, no hesitation—and slipped back out of sight.

My feet stopped by themselves.

“Caleb,” Tyler hissed. “Move.”

I did. I didn’t look back in.

At the stairs, I almost expected the powder to be exactly the same. It wasn’t.

The original prints were still there, but now there were more. Newer. Edges clearer. They led from the lobby toward the stairwell, overlapped some of our shoe marks, and stopped on the lowest step, just to the left of where my foot came down.

We all froze.

The surface of the powder shifted.

Not from us. We hadn’t moved.

A thin line appeared in the dust, like something invisible dragging a fingertip through it. It curved, looped, then straightened.

Letters.

Not neat. But readable.

NO

Tyler made a noise that was half-laugh, half-whimper.

“Okay,” Mason said. His voice was too loud in the stairwell. “Nope. Fine. Upstairs. Window. We are not walking through that lobby.”

The Maglite flickered.

Once.

Twice.

Then it cut out completely.

Everything went black. No slow fade. Just there one second, gone the next.

I heard Tyler slam the flashlight against the railing. “Come on. Come on.”

No light.

My fingers were already on my phone. I mashed the side button. The screen lit up in my face, bluish and harsh.

Battery: 14%.

I know it had been over 60% when we parked. I check my battery all the time. It’s a habit.

“Up,” Mason said. The dragging sound from the lobby came again, closer now, wet and steady. “Go.”

We went up.

Back on the second floor, my phone turned the hallway into a narrow, jittery tunnel. Beyond it, everything was just shape and suggestion.

“Conference room,” Tyler said. “Big window, faces the lot. We can jump.”

We’d joked about that window the last time we were here. “Emergency exit if the elevator ghosts get mad,” Mason had said. It hadn’t been funny then either.

I kept the phone angled down toward our feet. I didn’t want to see what might be standing ahead of us until I had to.

We passed more offices. My light caught on little things—the blinking red LED on an emergency exit sign that somehow still had power, a pen stuck point-first into a corkboard, a ring of something crusted on the carpet like a cup had been dropped there and never cleaned up.

Something moved behind one of the glass walls at the edge of the light. I saw it in my peripheral vision and refused to turn my head. If I didn’t give it my full attention, part of me could pretend it wasn’t there.

The conference room door was half-open. Tyler shoved it in and we crowded inside.

Long table. Twelve chairs. Whiteboard with PIPELINE and STRATEGY ghosts still faintly there. A dry marker lay on the tray, drowned in gray dust.

The window filled almost the whole far wall. From here, the parking lot looked flat and small. The Civic was a dark chunk in the darkness. The chain at the entrance was a faint line.

For about half a second, that view helped. Then the dragging sound out in the hall scraped a little closer.

Mason went to the window. There was a latch at the top. He worked it loose and pushed. The glass moved outward a few inches and stopped against some ancient limiter.

“Of course,” he muttered.

“Break it,” Tyler said.

Mason dragged one of the chairs over, metal legs screeching on the floor. “Stand back.”

He swung the chair into the glass. The boom made my ears ring. Cracks spidered out, but the pane held.

“Again,” Tyler said. He kept looking back at the door.

The dragging outside paused. Then started again, slower.

On the third hit, the glass gave. It blew outward in a shower of shards. Some fell in, some fell out. Cold air rushed in, tasting like wet weeds, asphalt, and something metal.

Mason kicked at the remaining jagged pieces, knocking them loose. Tiny fragments tinkled down to the bushes below.

“Feet first,” he said. “Story and a half. Bend your knees. I’ll go first.”

My phone buzzed in my hand.

A banner flashed at the top: New Voicemail – Unknown.

I stuffed the phone into my hoodie pocket.

Mason climbed onto the sill, one leg out. He looked back at us once. His pupils were huge.

“Don’t look down,” Tyler said.

“Already did,” Mason said, and went. The bushes rustled. “I’m good. Go.”

Tyler climbed up next. “If I break my ankle—” he started, then just dropped. There was a thump and a muted, “Ow. I’m fine. Caleb.”

The scraping outside the conference room door stopped.

I didn’t look at it.

I hauled myself up onto the sill. Broken glass scratched my shin. I felt warmth spread under my jeans, but there was no time to care.

My phone vibrated again as I pushed off.

Branches hit my sides. Then ground. I rolled, came up, and saw the Civic.

“Run!” Mason yelled.

We ran.

We tore across the lot, tripping, pushing off each other, not even pretending to be coordinated. Gravel slid out under my shoes. The air felt too cold in my throat.

Something hit the building behind us. A deep impact. Dust puffed off the top edge of the wall. Another hit followed, lower down, closer.

Tyler reached the car first and yanked the back door open. We piled in. Mason nearly dropped the keys, but got them in the ignition. The engine coughed and then roared.

Headlights flared on.

They swept across Building A, across the broken second-floor window.

For one long second, I saw fingers hooked over the cracked frame from the inside. Four of them. Gray-white, too long, joints bent in ways they shouldn’t bend. They tightened as the light hit them.

A face leaned into the light behind them.

Eyes with no pupils, just cloudy white. Skin that looked thin and stretched. A mouth that opened too far, full of teeth that didn’t match each other, like they’d been stolen from different jaws.

Then the car whipped around, the headlights swung away, and it was gone.

Mason slammed it into reverse, backed up in a wide arc that nearly took us into a light pole, then dropped it into drive and headed for the chain.

He didn’t slow. The chain snapped off one post, smacked the hood, and flipped out of the way.

We hit the smoother road and nobody talked for a solid minute. The radio was still on, some commercial about tires leaking into the silence like it belonged to another universe.

“Did you guys see—” Tyler started.

“Nope,” Mason said fast. “Saw nothing. We’re never going there again.”

“You saw it,” Tyler said, turning to look at me. “Right?”

“Yeah,” I said. There wasn’t any point in pretending. “I saw something.”

We dropped Tyler off on Maple. His porch light is the really bright motion one his dad installed after the mailbox-smashing thing two years ago. It made his front yard look like a set for a local commercial.

“You gonna tell them?” I asked, nodding toward his house.

“And say what?” he asked. “That we trespassed and got chased by… whatever that was? My dad would kill me before the monster got a chance.”

He tried to smile. It didn’t land properly.

“If you get anything weird,” he said. “Texts. Calls. I don’t care what time it is. Call me.”

“Same,” I said.

Mason just tapped the steering wheel.

We waited until his front door opened and closed behind him. Then Mason took me home.

“You sleeping?” he asked, as we turned onto my street.

“I’ll pretend to,” I said.

“Yeah,” he said. “Same.”

He stopped at my curb. I got out, leaning back in for a second.

“We’re not going back there,” I said.

“For once, I agree with you,” he said.

I shut the door.

Walking up my driveway, I noticed white dust on my shoelaces. I caught myself about to scrape them off on the grass, then didn’t. I don’t know why. It felt like admitting something.

Inside, I locked the deadbolt and slid the chain on. Mom was already in bed; I could hear the low hum of her fan upstairs.

In my room, I finally looked at my phone.

There was a notification I’d missed while we were running.

New Voicemail – Unknown Caller – 10:42 PM

The timestamp meant it had hit while we were still inside Parkland.

I sat on the edge of my bed and hit play.

Static. Low and constant. Under it, something like wet fabric being pulled across tile. Then my own voice, distorted but definitely me:

“Run, Caleb.”

Hearing your own name in your own voice, coming from somewhere you didn’t speak, is a special kind of wrong.

The message cut off after thirteen seconds.

I didn’t play it again. I saved it, put the phone face-down on my desk, and went to the bathroom to clean the cut on my leg. The soap smelled like cheap hotel bars. White dust from Parkland flaked off my jeans onto the tile. I kicked it into the corner by the plunger.

I told myself I was fine.

I wasn’t. But my brain tapped out anyway and I slept.

Waking up was worse.

My alarm ripped me out of some blurry nightmare about an elevator that wouldn’t stop. For a second, staring at my ceiling, I was just tired and annoyed.

Then everything crashed back.

The cut on my leg stung when I swung out of bed. There was a smear of pale dust on my pillowcase where my hoodie sleeve had been.

My phone was on my nightstand. Battery: 93%.

There were four notifications. Two were from school and some group chat. The other two were from Tyler.

Both were timestamped 3:14 a.m.

I opened the thread.

First message: a photo.

It looked black at first glance. I cranked the brightness and tilted the screen.

A hallway came into view. Not exactly Parkland’s, but close enough that my stomach clenched. Narrow, grimy, fluorescent light at the far end, flickering. The floor was streaked with something dark and wet, reflecting that bad light in dull lines.

On the right side of the frame, close to the camera, a pale shape was pressed against the wall.

An arm. Too long. The joint bent wrong. Four fingers spread flat, the tips ending in curved, dark nails dug into the paint.

Second message: text.

it knows your name

My thumb hovered over the keyboard.

I hit call instead.

It rang twice. Then the canned voice: “The wireless customer you are trying to reach is unavailable.”

I hung up. Tried again. Same thing.

I went downstairs. Mom was in the kitchen, hair damp, pouring coffee into her travel mug.

“You look rough,” she said. “You and Mason stay up all night?”

“Tyler texted me something at like three,” I said. “Some weird picture. I thought it was a joke.”

Her phone buzzed on the counter. She glanced at it.

Her face went tight.

“Oh, God,” she said quietly.

“What?” I asked.

“It’s a message from the school,” she said. “They’re saying one of your classmates is missing.” She looked at the screen. “A boy named… Tyler Jameson.”

The room tilted.

“Missing how?” I asked.

“It just says he didn’t come home last night and his parents reported it,” she said. “They want anyone who saw him after school to contact the police.”

“We walked around town,” I heard myself say. “Me, him, and Mason. But Mason dropped him off. I saw him go up to his porch.”

I did not say the word Parkland.

“If the police come by, you tell them everything,” she said. “I don’t care if you get in trouble for being somewhere you aren’t supposed to be. Understand?”

My phone buzzed in my hand.

New text from Tyler.

come back

A second one hit right after.

bring him

It came with a photo.

I opened it.

This one was brighter. The flash had gone off. The picture was blown out in the middle.

It showed… pieces. That’s the only way I can describe it. Torn strips of skinless meat piled wrong on a floor I couldn’t completely place. Muscle and fat, white bone glimpses. Nothing where it should be. You know when puzzle pieces almost fit but don’t? It looked like that, but with a person.

Near the top right corner, there was a scrap of dark blue fabric with white stitching. Tyler’s hoodie had looked exactly like that when he got out of the Civic.

At the very bottom edge of the photo, almost cut off, four gray fingers curled into view. Just the tips.

While I was staring, my battery dropped from 93% to 68%.

My hand shook. Coffee sloshed out of Mom’s mug onto the counter.

“What is it?” she asked.

Before I could answer, my phone buzzed again.

New text.

answer the door

“The door?” I said out loud before my brain caught up.

The doorbell rang.

Mom frowned. “They must be going house to house,” she said. “Stay here, okay?”

“Wait—” I started.

But she was already heading down the hall. I heard the deadbolt slide, the chain rattle, the door open.

Voices filtered in. Two male, one female. Serious, low.

“Good morning, Ms. Dorn,” a man said. “Sorry to wake you. We’re following up about your son’s friend, Tyler Jameson.”

“Yes, of course, come in,” Mom said.

She called my name.

It felt like my feet belonged to someone else, but they carried me down the hall anyway.

Two officers stood in the entryway. One tall with tired eyes, one shorter. A woman in plain clothes with a badge on her belt stood behind them.

“Morning, Caleb,” the taller one said. “I’m Officer Reyes. This is Officer Nolan. This is Detective Hsu. We’re trying to piece together where Tyler was last seen.”

He had a clipboard with papers clipped over one of my school photos.

“Your mom says you were with him after school,” Hsu said. Her voice wasn’t unkind, but there was no room in it.

My phone buzzed again in my hand.

“Yeah,” I said. “We just… hung out. Drove around.”

“Where?” Nolan asked.

“Maple. Broad. Near the Shell,” I said. “We didn’t go far.”

It was a half-truth. The worst kind.

“What time did you last see him?” Reyes asked.

“Around ten,” I said. “A little after. Mason dropped him off and I watched him walk up to his porch.”

“Did he say he was going anywhere else?” Hsu asked.

“No,” I said. “He just said he had to be home before midnight. His parents are strict.”

My phone buzzed in my hand again.

A banner flashed at the top: we can hear you.

The preview vanished as quickly as it appeared.

“Would you mind if we look at your texts with him from last night?” Reyes asked. “It helps us get a timeline.”

I thought about saying no. Saying my phone was dead. Saying I’d left it upstairs.

I unlocked it instead, opened the thread, and scrolled up past the worst of it so that memes and homework questions were at the top, then handed it over.

He read silently, lips moving a little. I watched his face go from neutral to mildly amused at some stupid meme, back to neutral when he hit the 3:14 a.m. photo. His eyebrows pulled in.

“What’s this?” he asked, angling it so Detective Hsu could see.

“I woke up and saw it,” I said. “I thought it was from some horror site. I was going to text him and ask what it was, but then Mom got the school alert and you guys showed up.”

Reyes zoomed in. Zoomed back out. Passed the phone to Hsu.

“Looks like fake gore,” she said, after a glance. “Plenty of that online.”

“Kids send each other that kind of thing,” Nolan said, almost to himself. “Shock pictures. Part of the culture.”

None of them were seeing what I was seeing. Or if they were, they were choosing to file it under “prank.”

Reyes scrolled down. He stopped just before the “come back” and “bring him” texts and handed the phone back.

“Did you receive anything after this?” Hsu asked.

“Those two you didn’t get to,” I said. “While you were here. I haven’t really read them.”

“Don’t delete any of it,” Reyes said. He took a card from his pocket and held it out. “If you get anything else from this number, or related to Tyler at all, call this right away. Even if it seems dumb, okay?”

“Okay,” I said.

They asked more questions. Did Tyler seem upset. Was he fighting with anyone. Did he talk about running away. I said no until the word sounded wrong.

They left eventually. The door closed behind them with a soft click.

Mom turned to me. “If there’s anything you didn’t tell them because you were scared you’d get in trouble—”

“I know,” I said.

She went back to the kitchen, already calling her manager on speaker.

I stood in the hall.

My phone buzzed.

New text from Tyler.

we’re close

The battery dropped from 68% to 39% as I watched.

There was another photo attached. I took it to my room before I opened it. I don’t know why that mattered, but it did.

On my bed, with the door half-shut, I looked.

The picture was of my street.

Taken from low to the ground, like whoever took it was crouching or lying in the middle of the road. The angle made the houses lean in a bit. You could see the maple tree in our yard, the cracked sidewalk with the uneven patch where the city painted over some old graffiti a couple summers ago, the Honda my neighbor always parks halfway across the line.

And my house.

My bedroom window.

The curtains were open. You could see a figure sitting on the bed inside, head bent over a phone.

Me.

The timestamp said it had been taken less than a minute before I opened it.

I hadn’t left my room.

The text under it said:

don’t make us ask again

The chips I’d grabbed from the kitchen slipped out of my lap and spilled across the floor.

Battery: 21%.

I called Mason. It went straight to voicemail. His greeting was the dumb old one: “Hey, it’s Mason. If I don’t call you back, it’s because I don’t like you. Kidding. Maybe.”

I hung up. Texted him: Pick up. It’s about Tyler. About Parkland.

No reply.

Mom knocked on my door. “They’ve got something about Tyler on Channel 7,” she said through it. “If you want to—”

“I’ve got homework,” I said, too fast.

She hesitated. “Okay. I’ll call you if they say anything important.”

The TV clicked on downstairs. Bits of the news filtered up through the floor.

“…last seen by friends…”

“…dark blue hoodie…”

“…urging anyone with information…”

My phone buzzed again.

New text from Tyler.

last chance

15 minutes

It came with a video.

I told myself I wouldn’t open it.

I did.

It started in motion and blur. Gray walls, jerky movements. The camera stabilized just enough to make me wish it hadn’t.

The angle was low, pointed down the upper hallway of Building A. I’d know that T-junction anywhere now. Conference room door on the right, red emergency exit at the end. No lights except a smear of gray from the broken window.

Tyler stood in the hallway, maybe twenty feet away. Facing the camera.

His hoodie was shredded and hanging in strips. There were dark stains all over his chest and arms. His stance was wrong—too stiff, like he was being held up by strings that didn’t quite understand how joints worked.

He raised one hand. It shook like it was heavy.

He beckoned.

“Caleb,” he said.

It was his voice and not his voice. Like someone had recorded him through an aquarium pump. Wet and burbling, but I could hear his cadence underneath the distortion.

The camera shifted. There was a scrape behind it, like fingernails along drywall.

Tyler’s eyes flicked past the lens to whatever was behind it. For a second, pure terror pushed through whatever else had hold of him.

“Don’t,” he said quickly. “It—”

The video blurred. The camera spun. For a fraction of a second, the frame caught something tall and jointed crowding the left side of the hall, too close, too much limb for the space.

Then the image smeared into gray blocks, like a file corrupting.

The last clear frame was Tyler’s face, too close. His mouth open too wide, eyes not looking at the camera, but at something behind it. Or behind me. It’s hard to explain.

The video ended.

The progress bar said 00:09.

Battery: 9%.

I tried to save the video to send it to Reyes. A little spinning circle appeared, then an error: FILE NOT FOUND.

The entire message thread blinked. Every bubble turned into an empty outline, then popped back in.

All except the video.

It was just gone. No “failed to download,” no placeholder. Like it had never been there.

The last text in the thread now was:

we’re not done yet

My voicemail icon lit again: 1 New Message – Unknown Caller – 7:22 AM.

I haven’t played that one. Not yet.

I know what I’m supposed to do. Call Reyes. Show him the photos I still have. Hand him my phone, admit we lied about Parkland, deal with whatever comes after.

I’m going to.

But I wanted this written somewhere else first. Somewhere that isn’t just my phone. I watched my phone chew up a video and spit out an error message. I don’t trust it.

I also wanted to warn anyone near here who thinks Parkland is just another “creepy abandoned spot” to film TikToks in.

Something in that building walks around on four-toed feet and spells words in extinguisher dust. It knows how to use a phone number that belongs to a kid whose parents are probably standing in his empty room right now. It can show you your own street from angles nobody’s standing at. It can send you your own voice.

It told us NO when we tried to go back through the lobby. I keep thinking about that. I don’t know if it meant “no, you can’t leave” or “no, don’t go that way.” Either way, we didn’t listen. We punched a window and jumped.

If you’ve been out there and you’ve still got white powder on your shoes or glass dust in your hoodie, pay attention to your notifications tonight.

If you see something from a number that should be off, or from a friend who’s missing, or with a picture of where you are right now taken from somewhere you aren’t—

Don’t open it. Or do, and then call someone immediately. Not just your group chat.

My battery says 5% even though it’s been plugged into the wall since I started typing this. The charging icon keeps flicking on and off.

Someone just rang the doorbell again.

Mom thinks it’s a neighbor bringing food, or the cops coming back with more questions.

The last text I got—one I haven’t opened yet—just popped up on my lock screen.

We’re renting a 4×4 and doing a loop — Caribbean → northern rainforest → Arenal → Monteverde → Manuel Antonio → back to SJO. Trying to balance adventure with chill time.

Here’s the rough plan:

**Puerto Viejo (4 nights)** – beaches, snorkeling, Jaguar Rescue Center, Bribri Tribe tour.  
**Sarapiquí (2 nights)** – whitewater rafting, rainforest area.  
**La Fortuna (3 nights)** – waterfall, hanging bridges, maybe a coffee/chocolate tour or hot springs.  
**Monteverde (2 nights)** – canopy zip-line + night jungle walk.  
**Manuel Antonio (3 nights)** – national park tour, beaches, and some downtime before flying home.

We’ve booked most lodging and big activities but left a few free days open for spontaneous stuff.

Anything obvious we’re missing or should swap out? Any favorite tours, beaches, or food spots you’d recommend along that route?",2,1763086789.0,CostaRicaTravel,1,1.0,False

1owkbyg,https://i.redd.it/snd6d0f3u41g1.png,Your Morning Coffee Just Got Cheaper: Trump Slashes Tariffs on Coffee & Bananas in Major Trade Deal,"The Trump administration just announced a surprising reversal on its aggressive tariff policy, and your wallet might actually feel the difference.

On Thursday, the White House revealed new trade framework deals with four Latin American countries – Argentina, Ecuador, Guatemala, and El Salvador – that will eliminate or reduce tariffs on products Americans rely on but can't produce domestically.

What's getting cheaper? Coffee, bananas, cocoa, beef, and certain textiles are all on the list. These are items the US doesn't grow or produce in large quantities, making imports essential for everyday life.

Why the sudden change? Politics. After Republicans suffered losses in recent state and local elections, Trump's team realized rising grocery prices had become a massive political liability. Coffee prices have spiked 18.9% in the past year, bananas are up 6.9%, and beef has surged 14.7% – and economists directly blamed Trump's tariffs for much of this pain.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent promised Americans would see ""substantial announcements"" on tariff cuts for products the US doesn't grow domestically, and now it's happening.

The catch? Brazil, a major source of US coffee and beef imports, wasn't included in these deals and still faces 50% tariffs. Also, while the White House promises ""some positive effects"" on prices, officials couldn't give specific numbers on how much consumers will actually save or when relief will hit store shelves.

The agreements will be formally signed within the next two weeks. So if you've been cutting back on your daily coffee runs because of the price hikes, there might be some relief coming soon.",0,1763086748.0,TrendoraX,6,0.5,False
1owkbt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/1owkbt8/does_anyone_else_feel_weirdly_lonely_in_a_crowd/,Does anyone else feel weirdly lonely in a crowd of thousands?,"I was in the middle of a packed library during midterms, surrounded by probably two hundred other students. All you could hear was the frantic typing and the occasional sigh of despair. And I just had this overwhelming thought: ""I have never felt more alone.""
It's ironic, right? You come to university, this place buzzing with thousands of people your age, promising new friends and experiences. And for the first few weeks, it's a whirlwind. But then routines set in. You go to your lectures, sit in a sea of faces, maybe exchange a polite smile with the person next to you. You go home to your apartment or dorm, close the door, and that's it.
It’s not that people are unfriendly. It's that making the jump from ""classmate"" to ""friend"" feels harder than any organic chemistry exam. Everyone seems to already have their group, their inside jokes, their plans for the weekend. Sending that ""hey, wanna grab coffee?"" text feels like submitting a formal application. The fear of seeming needy or getting rejected is so real.
I think we're all experiencing the same thing but are too afraid to admit it. We're all pretending we've got it all figured out, scrolling through social media feeds that scream ""LOOK AT MY AMAZING SOCIAL LIFE,"" when in reality, a lot of us are just... quietly lonely.
But here's the thing that's been helping me: being the initiator. It's uncomfortable, I won't lie. I started just asking one person in my seminar if they wanted to study together in the library. No big commitment, just ""I'm going to be on the third floor if you want to join."" Sometimes people say no, and it doesn't sting as much as I thought. But sometimes they say yes, and you realize they were probably hoping someone would ask.
It’s a slow process, and it feels awkward, but I'm trying to remember that deep connections aren't built in a day. They're built in those quiet, in-between moments—the shared complaints about a professor, the post-lecture debrief, the mutual understanding when you're both running on caffeine and no sleep.
Anyone else feel this? That university can be one of the loneliest places, even when you're never actually alone? How do you deal with it?",1,1763086737.0,GetStudying,0,1.0,False
1owkbif,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1owkbif/bambino_plus_portafilter/,Bambino Plus Portafilter,"Wow!!! I just want to thank everyone here who posts- with your advice I was able to find the Bambino Plus at HomeGoods for $350- awesome deal! My wife has been interested in at home espresso and listed it on our baby registry, so I was really excited to find this deal.

Of note- she is all about efficiency and automation so I knew she would appreciate the auto milk froth feature and fast heat up time. If it were up to me I probably would have splurged on a more artisanal product, but I’m excited to get more into espresso.

Quick question- I roast my own coffee and trend towards African light roast beans and pour over. I understand that the bambino plus is definitely not the espresso maker for lighter roasts. Nonetheless I would be interested in experimenting just a bit with some medium to light roasts.

1. What portafilter do you recommend for the Bambino plus that may be more well suited for roasts on the lighter end of the spectrum?

Thanks!!",1,1763086714.0,espresso,2,1.0,False
