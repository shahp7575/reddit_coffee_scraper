While capitalism may not have caused colonialism, it was undeniably essential in both justifying and sustaining it. Understanding colonialism is thus key to understanding the evolution of economic systems and the rise of capitalism, especially in its modern form.

Colonialism, especially from the 15th century onward, relied heavily on the extraction of wealth from colonized territories. This wealth was accumulated through the theft of indigenous lands, the exploitation of enslaved people, and the extraction of raw materials to fuel European industries. For example, British colonial rule in India looted cotton, worth trillions of dollars in today's money, which became foundational to the British textile industry. These colonial practices laid the groundwork for global trade networks and the expropriation of common lands in Europe, creating a landless proletariat dependent on wage labor—key components of early capitalist systems.

With the rise of industrial capitalism during the 18th and 19th centuries, European powers faced a new challenge: how to procure enough raw materials to feed the expanding factories of the industrial revolution. Cotton, sugar, coffee, tea, and other commodities were in high demand, but many European countries lacked the resources within their own borders. The solution, unsurprisingly, was to colonize foreign lands and exploit the cheap labour and resources available there. This marked the beginning of 18th-century colonialism, which was built on older forms of trade-based exploitation.

As industrial capitalism grew, so did the need for cheaper labor and more resources. Colonialism, therefore, became an imperative for capitalist expansion. The newly industrialized nations needed access to both raw materials and cheap labor to maintain their production levels. This led to the development of colonial empires, with capitalist elites using their political power to push governments into overseas expansion. Through the mechanisms of colonial oppression—force, coercion, and the systematic extraction of resources—capitalism consolidated its control over both land and labor.

The interrelationship between capitalism and colonialism reveals a deeper structure: the **hegemonic nature** of capitalist dominance. Capitalism’s economic order is not only about the concentration of wealth but also the maintenance of social, cultural, and political dominance. **Hegemony** in this context refers to the way capitalist power maintains its control through ideological and material means, often by shaping cultural and social perceptions that justify economic exploitation. In colonial settings, this hegemony was projected through racialized ideologies that dehumanized indigenous peoples and African slaves, positioning them as inferior and fit for exploitation. These racial hierarchies were constructed as a natural justification for the domination and subjugation of non-Europeans.

European colonizers, for instance, framed their actions as a “civilizing mission,” casting themselves as bearers of progress, reason, and culture in contrast to the ""savage"" and ""primitive"" peoples they encountered. This **racialized hegemony** created a framework in which the economic exploitation of colonized lands and peoples was not only acceptable but deemed necessary for the advancement of civilization. Race, as a social construct, was essential in justifying this system of colonial capitalism. It allowed the capitalist order to portray itself as benevolent and superior, masking the brutal realities of exploitation.

The rise of **new colonialism**, or racialized capitalism, saw the continued expansion of this hegemonic logic. As European powers consolidated their colonial empires, they not only extracted raw materials but also imposed a racial order that tied economic exploitation to a belief in European superiority. In this way, the labor and resources of colonized peoples were seen as legitimate tools to fuel the economic growth of Europe. **Hegemony**, in this sense, is reflected in how capitalism institutionalized racial inequality: the exploitation of colonized labor and land was ideologically justified through the racist belief that European civilization was superior, and thus entitled to control non-European peoples and resources.

By the late 19th century, the drive for resources like cotton, coffee, sugar, oil, coal, and metals intensified. The capitalist system’s inherent need for profit maximization only deepened the reliance on colonial structures. The push for cheap labor, combined with the demand for raw materials, further entrenched colonial practices. These resources were extracted at the lowest possible cost—often at the expense of human life and dignity—and justified through the racialized **hegemonic ideology** that placed European civilization at the top of a racial hierarchy.

Capitalism, in its drive for profit, relies on the extraction of wealth from colonized regions at minimal cost, both in terms of labor and material. The capitalist system, as described by thinkers like Adam Smith, pushes enterprises to maximize profits by minimizing costs. This pressure, in colonial contexts, meant the systematic exploitation of colonized peoples. The role of **hegemonic ideology** here is critical: it creates and reinforces racial distinctions that enable the subjugation of entire populations, ensuring that their labor remains undervalued, and their resources extracted with impunity.

Moreover, the relationship between capitalism and colonialism was not merely economic but structural. Colonialism facilitated the establishment of the modern capitalist world order, with European powers using colonies not just as sources of raw materials but also as labor reservoirs for industrial growth. These capitalist elites, in turn, justified their expansionist ambitions by embedding racialized ideologies into the very fabric of their colonial policies. **Hegemonic power** manifested through colonial systems of governance, which shaped economic structures around racialized labour and control, consolidating a global order that placed Europeans in positions of political and economic dominance.

Settler colonialism, seen in the United States and Australia, represents the most extreme form of colonialism, where the colonizers not only exploited resources but also displaced indigenous populations to fully control the land. In settler colonial contexts, the drive for land and resources is tied to the desire to establish long-term economic control. The economic motivations for settler colonialism were clear: to appropriate valuable land, replace indigenous agricultural systems, and restructure societies in service of industrial growth. The racialized **hegemony** inherent in settler colonialism is evident in the way that indigenous peoples were not merely exploited for labor but were displaced, disenfranchised, and erased from the land they had long occupied. This economic restructuring—driven by capitalist profit motives—was built on a racialized system of domination that justified the extermination, displacement, and marginalization of indigenous peoples.

My local roaster often sells coffee that is 1 month old and I haven’t had any issues getting any oxidation or stale notes. But other roasters I find the peak at 2-3 weeks and after a month I do not get the same vibrancy. Maybe it depends on the roasting equipment. 

Both Apollons Gold and TPC roast super light but they recommend different resting times. Both great tasting. I find that quite interesting.

1glzks9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stepparents/comments/1glzks9/petty_but_irritated/,Petty but irritated ,"SD14 takes a lunch to school everyday. At the beginning of the school year (9th grade) we told her that she is old enough to get herself fed for breakfast and to pack her own lunches. She likes to eat fruit, so I would make sure grapes were washed and baggied up, or strawberries sliced in little tupperwares so she just had to reach in and grab. 

They leave the house at 6:20 every morning and when they leave, I start to get ready but I’m usually downstairs around 6AM to just hang out, drink coffee, let the dogs out. This morning at 6, SD14 asks me if we have any fruit, and I say yes we have 2 bags of grapes (one green one red). She stares at me and says “well they’re not washed?” and I say “No, I didn’t get to it but you can do it for today if you want some.” She shuts the fridge, walks around to the counter to sit down and says “that’s okay, I had salads for dinner the last 2 days anyway” (???????)

I realize this is so petty but it’s still irritating me. She sat there on her phone playing a game for 20 minutes instead of spending 45 seconds cutting a bunch of grapes off, rinsing them off and throwing them in a baggie. I feel like she expected me to rush over and take care of it for her. I get that’s the “norm” I’ve created that it’s usually ready to grab but like? You can do it to girlie!

1glzckx,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingTenerife/comments/1glzckx/what_i_liked_and_didnt_like_about_tenerife/,What I liked and didn't like about Tenerife,"Just came home to Sweden after one week on Tenerife (Los Cristianos). It was absolutely fantastic. Such a beautiful, open and mountainous landscape. Wherever I went the view extended for tens of miles. It reminded me of everything I love and miss about the part of sweden where I grew up (the mountains in the far north). Except the climate was warm and pleasant with beautiful beaches and the ocean.

I stayed in Los Cristianos but 30 minutes from the beach uphill by foot (to avoid noises at night). In retrospect it was the right decision. The touristy area right next to the beach was very intense. Where I stayed wasn't dead silent at night but I think it was as close to what can reasonably be expected unless you live completely by yourself. Also, staying further up meant I had a great view every morning sitting on the 9th floor balcony and drinking my coffee.

One thing I really liked was how easy and pleasant it was to walk around the community. It was obvious that pedestrian-friendlyness was part of the city planning. BROAD sidewalks, often on both sides of the road. In addition to what I have already described about the overall open and mountainous landscape, I also found that the houses and buildings often were constructed and spaced in such a way that the landscape felt open and ""airy"" even when walking in the more busy areas. This is something that is very important to me as I am allergic to enviroments that feel cramped up, like you are stuck in some pit somewhere and there is no air, no open spaces around you. I found walking to and from the beach every day really pleasant because of this. I just got such a great vibe from the physical enviroment.

Another highpoint (pun intended) was the Teide national park. Driving through it was like visiting Mars, with all the solidified lava and the dramatic rock formations. I just wish I had had more time to spend there.

A small bonus is that all foods and drinks were kinda cheap compared to Sweden.

As for what I didn't like, I can't come up with anything. One thing I could mention, altough it's not really something that affects me in any way, is that I can't really tell the difference between different mediteranean cultures. Spain, Portugal, Greece, Croatia... I realise these are different countries but from a tourist point of view I feel all these places look extremely similar with similar food and just general feel of the places. Much as I suspect tourists who visit Norway/Denmark/Finland/Sweden might feel.

So to sum it up, I really enjoyed Tenerife and I am so happy I went there.",2,1731009086.0,VisitingTenerife,0,1.0,False

The hype can die down, the community can abandon the project, you can inadvertently find yourself in a Solana rug pull or the dev can just drop the ball. That said, those who are able to turn a profit will look for certain hallmarks to find the perfect coin, like:

- A healthy history with steady climbs and redistributions
- No wallets holding a massive supply hostage waiting to dump 
- An ever-increasing holder count
- A stable base with some barrier to minting new coins to keep out low-effort rugpulls (like ETH)
- A solid story and a growing ecosystem that can enter the public consciousness 
- An active community doing their own marketing
- No paid shilling, all organic growth

Developer hallmarks:
- A dev with proven experience 
- Already succesful, so no need for a quick buck
- Doxxed so you know you're dealing with someone who takes responsibility 
- Ideally, a dev that already has a large following

At this point you're either thinking a coin like this couldn't exist, or you're recognizing it because you're already holding a hefty bag. I'm ofcourse talking about $KENDU, the best play of this cycle. 

Kendu Miazaki is the dev with prior experience (Shiba Inu OG), a large following, plenty of success in the bank and a drive to make another community rich.

And talking about community: $KENDU has almost 15k holders on a trustworthy base (ETH). Every message you saw on this project and the ecosystem was a real human being truly believing in the power of this community. Their motto: ""We don't gamble. We work"". No paid shilling here. We got community members who launched the Kendu energy drink, the Kendu coffee brand, Kendu jewellery, the list goes on. This brand name has already started to make its way into the public consciousness and the effects will compound until everyone in crypto and outside it knows the name. 

Add all this together and you can see why memecoins-enthusiasts are saying this has decabillions programmed. With a shout-out by Coinbase on Twitter, it's a matter of time until the hike upwards explodes.

Now if you're not as optimistic as most, you might feel the market cap is a bit high at 50M. Instead of convincing you that you're wrong, Id like to draw your attention to $MEGA, the sibling coin by the same doxxed superdev, in the same ecosystem, with all the advantages listed before and only 2M market cap. 

That's right, after a big green candle of +40% (!), this hidden treasure is still only at 2.5M market cap. Instead of resorting to unrelated and possibly shady coins trying to emulate Kendu's playbook, why not step into the next best thing and become a part of this succesful family.

As always, the choice is yours and DYOR, but I hope you consider joining one of this intertwined communities and together we'll shoot for the stars this cycle.

CA's for your convenience, but it's always safer to join the Telegram and double check the CA yourself. See you there!

1glz0io,https://www.reddit.com/r/squirrels/comments/1glz0io/just_beginning_my_squirrel_story_long/,Just beginning my Squirrel Story. (long),"Hello foks. I just found this group, and I thought I’d share my short Squirrel Story.

**Prologue: November 28, 2024**

Having a short break from cleaning the house, I was sitting on the steps of my front deck enjoying the nice weather and scrolling through my phone, when I heard a sound from the tree next to me.

I turned and saw a big, chunky-looking squirrel wiith a black walnut in his mouth, right at eye level with me. Startled, I said “Hello, Mr. Squirrel,” and to my surprise, he made some chattering squirrel noises back. Then we stared at each other for about a minute before he climbed the tree, sat on the branch right above me, and gnawed on that walnut for the next half hour.

It was pretty darn peaceful.

**Actual Story:**

Unfortunately, that was the last really peaceful moment I’d have for a while. That Monday, I was laid off from work, and had to start looking for a job after 22 years at the same company. My world was kind of turned upside-down, but I held onto that squirrel encounter as a reminder that there was still happiness to be found in simple things.

I saw the squirrel in that tree a couple more time. Once, I saw him eating some sort of apple from the neighbor’s tree in that same spot he munched on the walnut. I was just happy that he felt that place was somewhere relatively safe to eat.

I had relayed that story to my mother, who told it to one her friends. The next Saturday, I was gifted a gallon bag of peanuts “for my new squirrel friend.”

Well, I had some extra time on my hands, so any time I took a break from the job boards, I would go outside, drink some coffee, and leave a peanut or two in the same spot on my deck when I was done. Every time I came back out, the nuts were gone, so I figured that the squirrels were taking them and knew where to find them.

Then after about a week or two, things started to pick up. I came home from a quick run to the store to find a squirrel sitting on the railing of my deck, right where I usually left the nuts.

https://preview.redd.it/l9tqi0lf7jzd1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0bdabf0fdcb08c81f5be17428ed9c45b0928dd5

Then, I started noticing what was going on what was happening when I’d sit outside. It turns out there were at least THREE squirrels: the original larger one, and then a pair of squirrels who always seemed to be together. They seemed to either hang out in a different tree in my yard or in the trees across the street.

But I started noticing that whenever I came outside, I’d see at least one in the vicinity. So... I started “hiding” nuts in various places about my 10’ x 10’ deck; under the handle of my grill, under a piece of  wood, and ALWAYS one in the original spot. Every time I’d come out, they’d be gone, but there would always be at least one in the vicinity.

https://preview.redd.it/iklgvpek7jzd1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8f328589ef06ecd25ada75e3ef9e4f43bde0fc36

A few days later, I opened the door to find the bigger squirrel sitting on the railing, and when it saw me, flattened itself agains the railing for a few moments, then scurried up the tree. I just spoke softly and moved to the spot I usually sit.

After that, they started getting bolder. Within a minute or two of me sitting on my steps, there would be a squirrel. It REALLY got interesting when I watched one of them see me, then make a beeline RIGHT TOWARDS ME, but then scurry to the tree next to me.

I changed up my game a little and started leaving the nuts out WHILE I was outside. It took a while, but they started exploring the deck WHILE I was out there, but always a “safe” distance away. But that distance has been closing.

Last week, I set a peanut in the “usual” spot, which is on the opposite side of the step I usually sit. Eventually, the big one CAUTIOUSLY crawled along the railing from behind me and grabbed it before running off.

A few days later, I set one a few steps down from the one I sit on, and one of the younger squirrels came up and cautiously grabbed the nut, but didn’t scurry off immediately. It stopped for a second, looked at me, twitched its tail a couple of times, then hopped off back across the street.

By this time, whenever I was outside, there were at least one or two (sometimes all three) squirrels scampering about the deck. I figured I’d really up the stakes and stood while I had my coffee.

Last weekend, the big one was on the railing, a few feet away. I had peanuts in my jacket pocket, so I took the biggest one out and held it out to him, trying to keep still. He would inch forward, then psyche himself out and jump back, then repeating the whole thing. You could just SEE that he wanted that darned nut, but was still to nervous to get it from me. He eventually scurried up the tree, and I left him a consolation prize in the usual spot.

We’ve had rain the last few days, so I haven’t been outside as much, but I have still been “hiding” nuts about my deck, and today, it’s been back to the usual antics of the last month.

So... does anybody have any tips or tricks to help “enhance” our interactions?",5,1731008240.0,squirrels,3,1.0,False

I didn't get any of the advertised flavour from it until the last few sips when it was cold. There was a bit of a nutty tone, but it was more like if someone said, ""This coffee roast has subtle nutty notes"" as opposed to ""This is a flavoured coffee.""

The Almond Croissant tastes like Sunny Almond on steroids. Very prominent artificial almond flavour. I don't mind artificial almond, but this was almost too much and I was thinking, ""Do I really want to drink an entire cup of this?"" It became less cloying as it cooled down a bit, but I could see this grossing me out if I drank it when I wasn't feeling my best. I think this flavour would taste better iced and watered down a bit, and I'm curious to try it side-by-side with an iced Sunny Almond to see how they compare.

Will finish the sleeves, but won't drink either of these multiple days in a row, and not worth the $1.50 CAD price tag, imo.

I just met a stranger and it feels like I’ve know them in another life

I haven’t, right?

Is it fate?



Delusion?



Am I, crazy?





I have this list of ordinary questions that would be magical if you could answer:

What’s your coffee order?

What’s the one song you can’t help but sing or dance to?

What’s one thing you would change if you could go back in time?

Do the birds sing for you outside your window in the morning?

Have you ever listened for it?

Really listened for it?

What is your go to take out spot?

Favorite mov- no, no.
Top 3 favorite movies?

Do you want to be a mother?

Get married?

What are some qualities you would love in a partner?

Do you have dreams?

Things you’ll probably never read.

Maybe you will.

Putting it under this particular flair because it's told by my friend 

My friend's parents are in some advertisement production company and because of that, my friend gets access to the set of shooting sometimes. Once, Sargun was shooting an ad and my friend at that time was on the set. He is a good looking well built guy and was in a relationship with one of television starkid (not so famous though). After the shoot, he and Sargun talked a bit and then she invited him for a coffee. After sometime, they met again and (in this words) one thing led to another and they were in bed. 
She never shared numbers with him, she never saw him again.

Enter the world of Thedas, a vibrant land of rugged wilderness, ancient ruins, and glittering cities – steeped in conflict and secret magics. Now, a pair of corrupt ancient gods have broken free from centuries of darkness and are hellbent on destroying the world.

Thedas needs someone they can count on. You can be that person – as Rook, Dragon Age’s newest hero. Be who you want to be and play how you want to play as you fight to stop the gods from blighting the world. 

https://preview.redd.it/33gme2xq3jzd1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=63af916b2d23669c28811dbe7d4f35da5680b75d

But you can’t do this alone – the odds are stacked against you. Lead a team of seven Companions, each with their own rich story to discover and shape, and together you will become The Veilguard.

Unite the Veilguard and defy the gods in **Dragon Age™: The Veilguard**, an immersive single-player RPG where you become the leader others believe in.

# The Options Are Endless

Craft your personalized Rook with a robust character creator. Choose from a diverse set of appearance options for Elf, Dwarf, Human, and Qunari lineages. Each lineage includes several preset appearances, as well as the option to completely customize your Rook. These options include the ability to choose the basics, like hair and face shape, and include many more granular choices that allow you to make a character as unique as you’d like.

# Choose Your Way To Play

Choose from three distinct classes: Mage, Rogue, and Warrior. Mages wield powerful spells to control the battlefield; Rogues excel in agility and stealth, striking from the shadows with dual daggers or picking off enemies from a distance with a bow; while Warriors dominate close combat, using either two-handed weapons or a sword and shield. Each class offers unique abilities and playstyles to suit your preference. Experience new strategic depth as you combine fast-paced attacks, parries, and dodges along with the Companion ability wheel to exploit enemy weaknesses and seize victory with devastating combos. Customize a combat style that works for you.

# MAGE

Mages rain down fury with spells that incinerate, freeze, electrocute, and crush. Some cast from afar with a staff, while others prefer close-quarters combat using an orb and dagger.

# ROGUE

https://preview.redd.it/34zsq5ds3jzd1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2489001d27def1f9753fb7cf4a4d382ed72e9fa

Rogues utilize quick movement and reflexes. Whether wielding a bow or dual swords, they use powerful, precise strikes for lethal damage.

# WARRIOR

https://preview.redd.it/o8xqrq8t3jzd1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2894c83696b8934aff0bfe334d03542c1be60cf

Warriors command the flow of the battlefield. Some lay waste with sword and shield, while others use a two-handed weapon to send enemies flying.

You’ll also choose one of six factions for Rook to belong to. Major players on the stage of Thedas, all of these factions will prove useful allies throughout your story. Your faction choice will influence your Rook’s backstory, conversation options, and potentially the balance of power on this divided continent. Learn more about each faction [here](https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/features).

**Unite Your Team of Seven Companions**

**Meet Your Companions:**

Harding: The Scout

Neve: The Detective

Bellara: The Veil Jumper

Davrin: The Warden

Emmrich: The Necromancer

Taash: The Dragon Hunter

**Rich Companion Stories**

# Gameplay

https://reddit.com/link/1glywnm/video/k7ui1dgp4jzd1/player

**Combat**

Combat in Dragon Age: The Veilguard happens in real time, with players making split-second, strategic decisions that can turn the tide of battle. Use your unique class abilities in combination with your Companions’ to prime and detonate massive combos that exploit enemy weaknesses and lay them out. Bring up the ability wheel to pause combat and see what abilities of Rook’s and your chosen companions will prime enemies, and which will detonate combinations. Stack buffs and debuffs to control the battlefield, giving allies powerful advantages and cutting enemies’ power off at the knees.

https://i.redd.it/t19nl9zz3jzd1.gif

**Progression and Leveling**

Experience comes from completing quests, and the bigger and more momentous the quest, the better the bonus will be. Rook also gains experience from killing enemies and exploring, but gaining levels is most efficient when helping the people of Thedas or taking time to deepen Rook’s bond with the Veilguard. 

Rook’s Companions are equally important to success as the player endeavors to save Thedas. Members of the Veilguard each have their own Levels and each Level gained grants them 2 Skill Points. Each Companion will have quests to deepen Rook’s bond with them, and this is one of the main ways for them to gain experience. Companions also can gain experience through unique conversations and decisions with them. These quests and bonds are not limited to romantic interests; platonic friendships are just as important and in focus in Dragon Age: The Veilguard.

**Exploration**

Throughout the story, you will go through many diverse areas, from the beauty of the lush Arlathan Forests to the busy streets of Minrathous. Veterans of the series have heard whispers in the past about each of these places in Thedas, but now you will actually be able to explore and experience them in-game. Each area has its own unique feel and style. There are several areas for exploration; each inviting you to delve deeper into the narrative and uncover the many mysteries Thedas holds.

https://reddit.com/link/1glywnm/video/pl68c2284jzd1/player

While exploring the world, the Veilguard will come across many things to do and people to talk to. Of course, there will be new and upgraded equipment, but there will also be puzzles and lore! There will be ancient statues, letters, and artifacts left behind to read and collect those Codex Entries. There are also new modes of transportation to find throughout the world, including fast travel. 

https://reddit.com/link/1glywnm/video/an05ure94jzd1/player

There will be new ways for your Companions to interact with the world as well, with specific exploration abilities. For example, you may come across some ancient Elven artifacts for Bellara to Tinker with while you wander through Arlathan. Even when the Companions are back at the Lighthouse, Rook can use the Lyrium Dagger to take advantage of their exploration abilities. You may also spot Companions out and about, interacting with the world on their own. When heading to Treviso, we recommend finding Lucanis and enjoying a cup of coffee together.

The blistering heat of south USA summer has finally started to fall away into a gentle warmth paired with a cool breeze. Sam's father has the windows open, so he can feel the fresh air throughout the house. 

Sam takes a moment to smile at his reflection, happy that a young man is looking back at him. His beard is coming along nicely. His muscles have doubled in size. Testosterone injections have been life changing, and he's so glad he decides to start his transition years ago. 

He walks into the kitchen to make breakfast. His father is up and smiling as he pickles jalapeños. It's a new passion of his. In the background coming from the radio, Dennis Prager is loudly claiming that to be ""nonbinary"" is objectively a mental illness. 

""Good morning!"" Sam says as he enters. ""The weather's lovely today."" 

His dad agrees as he moves to the stovetop. As he speaks, Dennis Prager advertises his new course for conservative parents. Then he says that transgender people's hormones make them smell horrible.

Sam goes to grab his breakfast from where it was preprepared in the fridge. ""Just gonna grab these oats, excuse me.""

""No problem, Sammybelle!"" his dad says. ""Hey, you're taking the cat to the vet today with your sister, right?"" 

*Brother*, both twins are trans men, but Sam keeps quiet. ""Yes, it'll be later though."" Now a Rush Limbaugh impersionater is crying about poor 18 year old girls thinking they're boys and cutting their breasts off. 

""Thank you, that gives me more time to relax today,"" his father says with a smile. ""I appreciate you."" Pseudo Rush Limbaugh says that giving HRT to mentally ill people is immoral, and transgender ideology is a mental illness. 

""Of course. I care about our cat too,"" Sam says. He drops some blueberries into his oats. The speaker now says that trans people's skin works well for purse leather, and he advertises a new accessory brand. 

Sam finishes putting together his coffee as his dad turns on the television. The news reporter suggests that trans people's organs are extra donatable and should be forcibly removed before death and given to Biological People. ""I'm going to my room now. Love you!"" 

""Love you too, sweetie,"" his dad says in reply. ""You girls have fun at the vet later, okay?"" 

Sam bites his tongue and laughs at the absurdity of the statement. ""We will! Have a nice day too!""

I was/am a fan--not obsessed--and it was sad when she died. I may have had a brief cry or shed some tears, but _today_ I cried like she was a family member who just died. Of course I started thinking what the hell is happening, and started laughing because it felt so ridiculous.

Then, I was vacuuming recently, and got so _annoyed_ I had to move a stool to vacuum underneath it. I was angry. It immediately felt off because it's not a significant thing, and then I was upset that I was angered by such a small thing. And, I just can't handle visceral things like some gore in movies, a friend talking about their neck epidural for pain in their shoulders and back, etc. They make me actually feel sick, something that never used to happen.

**4 PM** \- I logged off work, then started packing for both myself and my dog. I thought about bringing my dog on this trip, but I worried about how she would react on a flight, especially on the return flight, which is over 5 hours. 

**7:30 PM** \- I dropped off my dog with her sitter and headed straight to the airport. Since reading a post here a couple of weeks ago about an OP who missed their flight and had to pay $800 to rebook, I’ve been stressing about this flight. I arrived over an hour before my flight, something I would never have done. Once I made it to my gate and settled down, I realized I hadn’t eaten all day, and I was starving, like a stomach-making-noise kind of hunger. This must be a cruel joke. Even though I had about 45 minutes before boarding, I was so scared of missing my flight that I decided to bear the hunger and stay at my gate. 

**9:30 PM** \- Time to board finally! Nope, the crew was running late, and they wouldn’t start boarding until they all arrived. A few people were not happy about that, and they made sure the lady at the gate knew it. I truly don’t understand this way of thinking. This lady at the gate is just an employee, and according to her, this is an FAA rule. Yelling and cussing at her and the airline won’t change anything but stress you and everyone around you out. For me, I leaned back in my chair, continued to suck on my lip, to self-soothe, and listened to my favorite book. Weirdly enough, I no longer felt the hunger pangs. 

**Midnight (Chicago Time)** \-  We boarded sometime after 10 PM. When we landed, I went straight to a restaurant at the airport and ordered lamb chops with potatoes, vegetables, a piece of cake, and a Diet Coke to go. Yes, I know I could have left the airport and ordered from any restaurant in Chicago, but at this point, I was one muscle away from snatching food from strangers and eating it right in front of them. - ($72) 

**1:30 AM** \- Checked into my hotel, showered, and ate. Surprise, surprise, I ordered way too much food than I could ever eat that night. I also made plans to see my little sister tomorrow. Did my nighttime skincare routine. Lights out. 😴

**Day Two: Saturday** 

**9:30 AM** \- I’m up, writing this diary. Texting with my sisters. I sent a Lyft to my sister; she lives outside of Chicago city limits. Showered and checked out. 

**10:30 AM** \- Met up with my sister (O). I took her to Eataly. My sister received some bad news earlier this week, so I’m trying to cheer her up. I ordered bucatini Cacio e Pepe, and O ordered cheese ravioli with wine. I picked up the check. - ($82) Once we were done in the restaurant, we browsed Eataly some more. O got some chocolate and dessert. I also treated her to coffee and pastry. - ($10) Hearing her laugh just warmed my heart. I’m just happy she has bounced back from the terrible news she got. 

**1:00 PM** \- We walked back to my hotel to get my luggage, and then I called a Lyft to take O home with a stop for me at Union Station. I checked in and went to the Amtrak lounge. I grabbed a cup of coffee and multiple snacks - based on tips from a YouTuber. 

**2:00 PM** \- All aboard! Our board attendant (P) introduced himself and explained how the train would work; and also took my reservation for dinner. I settled into my room and plugged in my laptop, tablet, and phone. Took a quick room video and sent it to my family. I then took a nap. Quick note: Based on my research, the first day is mostly Midwest states. For me, scenery-wise, it’s not interesting, so I’m not worried about missing anything. 

**6:15 PM** \- Woke up, freshened up, and headed up to the diner for dinner. One of Amtrak’s diner policies is that you can’t sit alone. You will be seated with someone when you’re in the diner. I sat with three other travelers. I was a little apprehensive about sitting with strangers, but five minutes into the dinner, the conversation flowed so easily that we stayed well after dinner. I ordered pasta primavera, and for dessert, I had white chocolate blueberry cheesecake. Given that food was added as part of my ticket, I didn’t have to pay, but I tipped my server. ($5) 

**9:00 PM** \- Headed back to my room and turned on the Megan Thee Stallion documentary; as a Black immigrant woman, this documentary, as we say in my language, “hit a bone.” You see the self-ascribed pillars of the community saying “Free Tory.” The sad thing is these men are parents to Black daughters. Given the statistics of violence against Black women, what will they say to their daughters and granddaughters; the day they too might become victims? 

**10:15 PM** \- The train stopped for the final smoke break of the day. I got out, stretched my legs, and headed back in. My seat had been turned into a bed by the attendant. I thanked him and did my nighttime skincare routine. Lights out. 😴

**2:30 AM** \- OMG, it’s hot. See, I’m a longtime anemic, and year-round I wear a sweater. During my research, a couple of people advised people to have a small fan, but I dismissed it. Oh boy, was I WRONG! I woke up drenched in sweat. There’s no way I was falling asleep. I saw online that the shower reviews were 50/50. Some people said it was dirty, but others praised it. However, with how I was feeling right now, I didn’t care. I needed to rinse off this sweat and lower my temperature. I’m happy to say our shower was big, clean, and well-stocked with towels, soaps, and even a lotion. I was in there for about 10 minutes, came back, and finally fell asleep with my door open and the curtains closing the entryway.

**Day Three: Sunday** 

**6:30 AM** \- Thanks to the change in time zone and DST, I’m up earlier than I would have on a Sunday. P swung by, and I asked if I could have my breakfast in my room. Luckily for me, the temperature had reduced greatly; actually, I had to put on a sweatshirt over my PJs. Ate breakfast, which was oatmeal with brown sugar and raisins, strawberries, and a fresh-baked croissant, and got dressed for the day. Our train had the first smoke stop of the day, and we would be here for a while, so I got off the train and walked around listening to a book. I also called my older sister and her children to show them around. Of course, my 2-year-old nephew started crying because he wanted to be on the train with me at that moment. Please, can someone tell this little boy no one has figured out time and space travel yet? 

**10:00 AM** \- One of the diner attendants took my reservation for lunch. Then I went to the observation car, where I met this lovely older couple in their late 60s from the South. In between taking pictures of the scenery, we chatted. He told me stories about how his grandfather used to work on trains in the 1900s. The car started to fill up with people and get a lot noisier, so I headed back to my room to finish the book I started yesterday. 

**1:30 PM** \- I headed to the diner for lunch. I was seated with two brothers. It was okay, but the conversation wasn’t as easy as last night. I ordered a beef burger with potato chips on the side and a butter cake for dessert. After I finished my food, I left and went back to my room. For a second, I debated between playing Mario or solving LeetCode. I chose LeetCode. I’m now realizing without someone watching you solve it or having an interview date looming over your head, LeetCode isn’t as bad. The train stopped. This was a small smoke break. I got out, chatted with P, took some pictures of the train station, and hopped back in. 

**3:30 PM** \- We were in the Rockies. The scenery was crazy. I oscillated between getting lost in the scenery and scrambling to take pictures before the train drove away. I don’t think I have the best pictures, but those images are locked in my memory. They were breathtaking! The dinner attendant came to take my reservation. Not long after, I fell asleep. 

**5:30 PM** \- Woke up, and the train was at a train station. I saw people outside and came down. I walked the length of the platform to stretch my legs, got back to the train, stopped to grab a coffee, and headed into my room to play Mario on my Switch. Dinner time! Headed to the diner and was seated with a passenger from the Coach. Coach passengers have to pay for their food. She was my favorite interaction I had on the train so far. She was so funny, we talked a little bit about the election, and we both had the same prediction for different reasons. For dinner, I had baked salmon with wild rice and vegetables in a lobster sauce, and the same dessert as last night. I left a tip for my server ($5). I came back to my room and continued writing this diary.

**11:30 PM** \- I now know how to take down my bed so I didn't need help doing it. I took a glorious shower and did my skincare routine. Lights out. 😴

**Day Four: Monday** 

**7:00 AM** \- I had a good night's sleep, a lot better than the previous night. I ate my breakfast, the same as yesterday, in my room again. Breakfast and lunch would be brief because today was the last day.

**10:00 AM** \- Again, I did LeetCode, using my hotspot for the internet as the train doesn't have any. I oscillated between doing LeetCode when I had a connection, taking in and admiring the scenery, and reading my book.

**1:30 PM** \- I went for lunch. I was seated with someone I met yesterday and a mother and son. Again, a wonderful lunch and conversation flowed easily among the adults, with the child chiming in once in a while. I decided to head to the observation car, but it was a little full for my liking. Also, my room had a good view, so I headed back to my room. I had a grilled chicken salad, no dessert as I was still full from last night.

**4:00 PM** \- Announcement: we will be getting to Emeryville in about an hour. Wow, we are ahead of schedule! I did some reading and packed up my bag to leave.

**5:15 PM** \- I left a tip ($20) for P and headed out to get on the bus. This bus will take us to SF!

**7:30 PM** \- Checked into my hotel in SF and ordered Chipotle from DoorDash using a gift card in my DoorDash account ($40). I showered, ate, called family, and sent some pictures.

**10:00 PM** \- I called the front desk because in the past hour, I haven't been able to log into the WiFi and my TV is saying ""not available."" She apologized and said AT&T is down; just my luck, I guess. Back to the hotspot. 😔

**11:00 PM** \- Did my skincare routine and lights out. 😴

**Day Five: Tuesday** 

**7:30 AM** \- Woke up, got dressed, and headed to the Starbucks across the street with my book. I ordered a large hot coffee with oat milk and a sandwich. I'm texting with an old friend I haven't seen since 2019; we plan to meet up once she gets off work at 5:30 PM. I booked a reservation at a restaurant she recommended ($17).

**10:30 AM** \- Headed back to my hotel to get ready for Alcatraz. I took a Lyft from the hotel to the Piers and boarded the boat. I took the guided tour; the man was wonderful, he made the tour so interesting. There was also an audio tour of the prison cells, which gave me chills listening to it.

**3:00 PM** \- Just got back from Alcatraz. I didn't know it would take so much time, but I'm happy I went. I finished up the last of my Chipotle order. Headed back to Starbucks to get something to hold me over until dinner ($10).

**6:30 PM** \- I met my friend at my hotel lobby. It turns out the restaurant isn't that far from my hotel. We had a lot to catch up on, but the best news is that she is moving back east in the new year. I'm so excited! We both ordered the same thing: Fettuccine Pescatore, but I switched my pasta to pappardelle. For dessert, we ordered profiteroles with white chocolate. After dinner, I picked up the check and we headed to my hotel. We talked some more. It was nice to see her after all this time ($85).

**10:00 PM** \- Since there's no internet, but I have an early flight tomorrow, I got ready and headed to bed. Lights out. 😴

**Day Six: Wednesday** 

**8:00 AM** \- Woke up, got dressed, and packed my luggage to head out. I called a Lyft to head to the airport.

**10:45 AM** \- I'm seated with a Peet's coffee and a pumpkin loaf at the gate. We should be boarding in about 15 minutes. The boarding went smoothly, better than the previous flight. Our plane departed on time ($10).

**8:20 PM (NYC)** \- Landed and headed to the Lyft area. The flight was uneventful. I ordered a Popeyes combo meal from Grubhub on my way home($27).

**9:45 PM** \- Texted my dog, the sitter, that I would be picking her up tomorrow. I ate, did my skincare, and lights out. 😴

I’ve felt so much shame, guilt, and regret and have done a lot of reflecting over the last 25 days. I’m feeling better now, but I have to say breaking up has made me see parts of myself I hadn’t before—things I need to work on to be a better partner in the future. It’s wild how much more you can understand about yourself when you look back with fresh eyes. Turns out, I wasn’t as loving, invested, or supportive as I thought. She deserved to be treated so much better. While our relationship was pretty amazing, there were some things I did that made it unhealthy. I’m not trying to beat myself up, but damn, I literally had the world in my hands and I dropped it. If you’re interested, here’s the story—just getting some things off my chest.

**Some background:** I dated this girl for about nine months. She treated me incredibly well—like a king. She had more of an anxious attachment style while I leaned more toward avoidance. She was very loving and open, while I was a little more reserved. She was everything anyone could ask for—beautiful, kind, and deeply in love with me. When we first met, I wasn’t necessarily looking for a relationship but things developed naturally. She wanted to move a bit faster than I did. About a month in, she tearfully asked if we were “official.” I looked at her and said, “Isn’t it obvious?” She was fully committed pretty quickly while I took a little longer.

The relationship was fantastic for a while, with no major issues. We shared nearly all the same values and interests, had a great sex life, and truly envisioned a future together. She would always buy me gifts and I tried to lean into her love language, often surprising her with flowers or her favorite snacks. Her eyes would light up whenever I brought her a bouquet. I remember giving her a charm bracelet from James Avery and the way she reacted was unforgettable. I’d pick her up from work regularly and we’d spend quality time together. I even bought her an iron, ironing board, and steamer when she mentioned her frustration with wrinkled clothes. We toured an apartment and excitedly talked about moving in together. I took her to Chicago and introduced her to my hometown—every second felt incredible. Whenever issues came up, she’d address them calmly and respectfully. Unfortunately, I tended to get defensive. Looking back, I realize I wasn’t handling things well and was probably too immature for a serious relationship at the time. She did admit to feeling somewhat insecure at times. I realize now that I didn’t understand our attachment styles until after we’d broken up.

Around the eighth month, I started a stressful new job and things began to unravel. I didn’t take my stress out on her directly but I brought it home. My libido dropped, we didn’t go on any “real” dates for about a month, and I pulled back on love and affection. One night, she tried to initiate intimacy and I told her I wasn’t in the mood. She ended up crying on the couch and instead of comforting her, I just rolled over and went to sleep. I became irritable with her for no real reason and withdrew emotionally. I wasn’t giving her the love, affection, or understanding that she deserved. I slept in the same bed with someone who was crazy about me and somehow lost attraction to her. I was complacent, way too comfortable, and selfish.

Things finally broke down one night in the laundry room. She was playfully pestering me and I turned around and put my hands around her neck—not aggressively or with any intent to hurt, but in a misguided attempt to “diffuse” the situation. I know now how wrong that was, and though I didn’t hurt her, it scared her. It was the worst thing I ever did. We talked about it immediately after and I apologized, saying I didn’t mean to hurt her, but I know I lost her that day. Between that incident, my cold behavior, and me frequently showing up late, she told me a couple of weeks later that she’d been crying all the time and couldn’t sleep. Yet on the surface, everything seemed fine based on her texts and the time we spent together.

A few weeks later, after more of my emotionally distant behavior, she suggested a break and then, a week later, told me she wanted to break up. I texted her three days later and she said to move on and that she never wanted to speak to me again. I went over to her place about five or six days later to return her things and we talked for about an hour. She admitted she was really angry at me and needed time to forgive me for when I put my hands around her. Turns out, she had immediately started seeing a coworker she had lined up when she suggested a break. I didn’t find out about this until a week and a half later when we were texting back and forth and she told me. That same day, I showed up at her place and she invited me in. We talked for two hours in a very peaceful way. She admitted she was seeing this guy because he showed her attention, and as way to get back at me in a vindictive way. She seemed extremely dejected, like she knew she had to move on but couldn’t. She said she didn’t even know what she was doing with herself, that all her friends were worried about her, and they didn’t think she was acting like herself. She admitted to feeling angry and mad at me. I went over the next morning with some coffee and she seemed even worse than the day before. She said she loved me but couldn’t come back so quickly (which felt like her way of saying she might never come back). The next night, she called saying she wanted to try again but looking back, I don’t think she was serious since she texted me an hour later, saying she still needed more time (an artificial date of 1 month) and wasn’t going to do anything. 

Then, as if my timing couldn’t get worse, the day after that call I got offered a new job that would require me to move away for three months. I called to tell her and she broke down sobbing in the parking lot of a restaurant. I’d never heard her cry like that—she said she didn’t know how long it would take to feel normal again. I told her I loved her dearly and just wanted to work things out between us. Shortly after, she blocked my number. When I called from another phone, she told me I’d never loved her, never listened to her, and that I should stay out of her life forever. I tried going over to her place to talk but she refused to open the door and told me to just go home and that I hadn't changed one bit. Later, she unblocked me on Instagram just to tell me again that we were over, to leave her alone, and that it felt like I was stalking her. I only went over to her place because 10 days prior she talked about getting back together and not doing anything with anyone... That was a bold face lie. 

Looking back, I can see where I went wrong at every turn. I’ve had a lot of time to reflect and feel like I’ve learned more about myself in the last few weeks than in the rest of my life. Moving forward, I think being honest with yourself and reflecting on who you really are is essential to maintaining healthy relationships—with both yourself and others. I guess it’s true what they say—you don’t know what you have until it’s gone! I’m so sorry, A. I wanted to give you the world and buy you some land in Colorado.",1,1731007360.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

She sat up straight and folded her hands neatly on the table between us. I mimicked her. She nodded approvingly. “Good! And never cross your legs at the knees. It looks unprofessional.” I leaned around the table to see that she had crossed her legs delicately at the ankles. I did the same.

“Perfect!” she said, smiling. “Always smile and be sure to ask lots of questions. That way, they’ll know you’re interested in their company. No one will talk to you if they think you aren’t interested.”

I nodded. “How did my résumé look?”

“It’s good.” She slid it across the table. She had underlined the name of our college at the top of the page. “But Ithaca College should be in bold font. You want people to see it right away.”

She glanced over at the clock. “The career fair starts in an hour,” she said. “You’ll have time to fix that font and put on a nice pair of slacks and a blouse.”

I nodded. “Is there anything else I can do for my résumé?” I asked.

She tapped the words “Ithaca College” at the top of the page. “Just make sure this is in bold,” she reiterated. “You want people to know that you’re proud of your alma mater.” 

“Right.” I took my résumé and headed back to my dorm. I had borrowed an iron from a neighbor the day before and my outfit - slacks, blouse, blazer, and uncomfortable black pumps - was hanging up neatly in my closet. I had taken the bus to the mall and gotten myself a couple of snazzy interview/career fair outfits from a department store that was going out of business. In spite of the sale, the clothes had been pricier than I was really comfortable with, but I figured I’d earn it all back once I got a job. The career fair was the first step.

\~x\~

I waited for my boyfriend, Ian, outside the career fair, but only for fifteen minutes. I tried calling his cell phone, but as usual, it went straight to voicemail. The career fair was set up in one of the larger lecture halls on campus; it wouldn’t be hard for Ian and I to find each other.

The first booth I approached had a large Japanese flag on its banner. “The experience of a lifetime! Discover Japan teaching English with CommuniCo!” the banner read in large red letters. The man behind the booth was leaning against the table, focused on a crossword puzzle. I gave a small wave and smiled as I approached.

“Hi!” My voice was high and chirpy, matching my enthusiastic smile. “Tell me about CommuniCo.”

The man didn’t bother looking up. “We’re hiring people to teach English in Japan,” he said.

I paused, waiting for him to say more. The girl at the career center had said that it was important to ask questions; it would let prospective employers know that I was interested. She had also said that smiling would let them know I was friendly and approachable. I kept smiling. “That’s so fascinating,” I said, “do I need to know any Japanese in order to apply?”

The man rolled his eyes. “No,” he said, “why would you?”

Well, I felt like saying, it would probably help to know the native language before I move there. I bit back the urge to be sarcastic. There were plenty of other booths at the career fair. There was no need for me to be rude just because this one was a dud. Too bad, I thought, teaching English in Japan could probably be interesting, but this guy clearly doesn’t care about finding potential employees here. Maybe there weren’t any open positions at CommuniCo; maybe it was his way of preventing people from applying and then being disappointed. 

“Well, thanks anyway.” I turned and left. There were other booths to investigate, after all. They couldn’t all be duds.

\~x\~

I met up with Ian after my third lap around the room. The career fair was much smaller than I had anticipated, and the booths weren’t much better than CommuniCo’s. Most of the companies were local to Ithaca and were only offering unpaid internships. I didn’t plan on sticking around after graduating; I didn’t have anywhere to live, and the local newspaper wasn’t about to provide room and board or pay enough for an apartment. At least it had been mildly amusing to see the Mormons and Jehovah’s Witnesses next to each other, competing for new converts willing to do charity work in third world countries.

“Have you checked out that Japan booth?” asked Ian, “it seems so cool!”

I arched an eyebrow. “The guy was super rude to me,” I said. “I didn’t really stick around.”

“Really?” Ian glanced over his shoulder at the CommuniCo booth, where the man behind it was still bent over his crossword puzzle. “He seemed really nice.” Ian pulled a pile of pamphlets out of his messenger bag. “He gave me a whole bunch of stuff and we talked about Japan. He’s been teaching over there for five years! He’s only stateside for a big conference and got stuck doing this.”

I shrugged, mildly disappointed that the man at the CommuniCo booth hadn’t seemed interested in me. He hadn’t even offered me a pamphlet. “Do you wanna grab lunch?” I asked Ian.

“Sure. It’s too bad they don’t have sushi on campus.”

“The best we can do is takeout Chinese food,” I said, “and I’m a little broke right now. How about sandwiches?”

Ian shrugged. “Sounds good.”

\~x\~

“Guess who got a job with CommuniCo?” Ian’s grin lit up his entire face. 

“You got a job? Ian, that’s fantastic!” I hugged him. “Tell me everything!”

“I’m going to Japan for two years.”

It felt like everything around me had suddenly stopped, like I had been plunged headfirst into icy water and was being held down. Was I hearing this right? Ian was going to move halfway around the world and stay there for two whole years? 

He frowned at me. “You know, you could be a little more excited for me,” he said.

“I - I am,” I stuttered. “It’s just - it’s such a big move.”

“I know. I’m leaving in a month.”

“But what about us?”

Ian tilted his head to the side like a confused puppy. “I’m not staying forever,” he said, “I’m only going for two years. It’s so I’ll be able to learn the language. Isn’t it cool?”

“But...I mean...” It felt like my brain was on fire, like every single cell devoted to words and language was burning up. My mouth felt like it was stuffed with cotton, like I was choking on it. I couldn’t talk, couldn’t articulate, couldn’t express. Ian kissed my forehead, oblivious to my distress.

“You can come and visit me,” he said.

“I just thought that we’d get a place together after graduating,” I said.

“We will when I get home,” said Ian. He patted my shoulder. “I’m not going away forever. I’ll be home before you know it.” 

“I didn’t even know you had applied.”

Ian frowned again. “I thought I told you.”

I shook my head. “No. This is the first you’ve mentioned CommuniCo since the career fair.”

“Yeah, I told you I was thinking about applying when we were eating sandwiches.”

I struggled to remember. We had both talked about how useless that career fair had been and how it was disappointing that the Mormons and the Jehovah’s Witnesses hadn’t actually fought each other. Ian had mentioned that it would be cool to teach in Japan and live there, but had never said anything about applying to CommuniCo. He’d never said that he’d actually do it or that he even wanted to, just that it seemed like a fun idea. 

“Look, I thought I brought it up,” said Ian, “but maybe I didn’t. It was over a week ago.”

“Yeah, but, we’ve been together for over three years, and I thought we’d, you know, stay together after we graduated.”

“And we are gonna stay together. We’re not breaking up or anything,” said Ian. He pouted. “I thought you’d be happy that I managed to get a job.”

“I am!” I used my chipper voice, trying more to convince myself than to convince Ian. “I am happy, but it’s...it’s so far away and you never talked to me about it - ”

“I did,” insisted Ian. “You said I should apply and you said you’d come and visit me.”

I shook my head. “No,” I said, “you never mentioned applying to CommuniCo or anything like that - ”

“Are you calling me a liar?”

“No! Of course not!” I wanted to keep going, to tell him that he hadn’t discussed CommuniCo with me at all and that this was the first I was even hearing about his desire to go to Japan. But I also didn’t want to argue. He was so happy about the new job and I didn’t want to spoil it by arguing. Maybe he did mention it, I told myself, even though I knew he hadn’t.

“I’m sorry,” I said. “I’m just stressed out. I didn’t find anything good at the career fair.”

I waited, wondering if he’d hand me a CommuniCo brochure and suggest applying. He only smiled and nodded. “That’s OK,” he said, putting his arm around me, “there weren’t many good options. Too bad the Mormons and Jehovah’s Witnesses never had that fight.”

\~x\~

“That career fair wasn’t super great,” I told the girl at the career center. She nodded in agreement.

“Yeah, they weren’t exactly on their A game,” she agreed.

“Is there an employment agency or something I can apply to?” I asked. She frowned, tilting her head in confusion. “Like, somewhere I can send my résumé, and they’ll keep it on file and then contact me if something matches it?”

“I don’t know if such a place exists,” said the girl after thinking it over. She tapped her fingers on the desk nervously. “The Ithaca paper is hiring.”

“I know, but I can’t really apply,” I said. “I don’t live here. Unless there’s a way I can work from Massachusetts or something.”

She shook her head. “No, they need someone who can come into the office.” She shrugged. “I’m sure something will come up. Just keep looking when you get back home.”

“OK. Do you know of any companies in Massachusetts that are hiring? Like, do you have a database or something? That way, I can send my résumé now and then schedule an interview for when I get back.”

The girl shook her head again. “No,” she said. “We don’t have anything like that. Sorry.”

“That’s OK,” I said, even as my heart began to sink. “I’m sure I’ll find something when I get back home.”

\~x\~

“Are you really going to be cooped up in your room all day?” My mother stood in the bedroom doorway, her hands on her hips. I looked over at the clock. It was a little after ten in the morning.

“I’m just waiting for Ian to call me,” I said. “It’s nighttime in Tokyo. He promised he’d call every night before bed.”

I hadn’t cried in front of Ian when I dropped him off at the airport. I hadn’t begged him to reconsider or stay home or take me with him. I had smiled stoically while he kissed me and assured me that two years would fly by.

“Just you wait and see,” he had said while we waited for his gate to open, “in two years, we’ll be renting an apartment together and saving up to go back to Japan for our first vacation!”

I had cried the entire way home. My mother had comforted me a little, but had reminded me that I needed to get a job before Ian and I could move in together. 

Now she was tapping her foot impatiently, her lips pursed as she looked me up and down. “You haven’t even showered!” she admonished. 

“Ian might call,” I said. “I don’t want to miss him.”

“What time is it in Tokyo anyway?” asked my mother. 

“Around eleven at night,” I said.

“He’s probably gone to bed.”

I sighed. “He promised he would call.”

“He probably went out with friends after a long day of work,” said my mother, emphasizing the word ‘work.’ “That’s what people do when they’re employed. They go out afterwards. They don’t sit around on the computer for hours and hours.”

I looked down at the screen. The Skype logo filled my computer screen. No missed calls. No calls at all. In the month that Ian had been gone, he’d only called me twice. “Look, I’m still getting settled in,” he had told me a few days ago, “my apartment doesn’t have internet yet.” 

My mother huffed. “You’d be more productive if you showered, got dressed, and got out of this room,” she said. “Maybe you can take the bus into town and ask for job applications.”

She had a point. I wasn’t accomplishing anything by sitting around and waiting for Ian to call. So I showered, got dressed, and printed out a dozen copies of my résumé to hand out. Maybe someone would be impressed by my initiative. Or maybe there was a job opening that I didn’t know about. It couldn’t hurt to try. I was eating breakfast when my mother came into the kitchen.

“I’m going into town,” I told her, smiling. “I’ve got a stack of résumés here, and I’m not coming home until I’ve passed them all out!”

She looked at me and frowned. “Is that what you’re wearing?”

I looked down at my clothes. I was wearing jeans and sneakers with a nice sweater. It would all be pretty much hidden under a coat anyway. “I’m going to be walking around all day,” I said, “I want to be comfortable.”

My mother rolled her eyes. “No one is going to hire you if you walk in there looking like a homeless person. Don’t you have any nice clothes?”

I changed into my slacks, blazer, and pumps. 

\~x\~

“Can I help you?” the receptionist looked up at me over the top of her trashy romance novel.

“Yes.” I beamed and offered her my résumé. “My name is Kylie Upton, and I’m looking for a job.”

The receptionist blinked. She stared at my résumé, but didn’t take it. “Who do you have an interview with?”

“Oh, I don’t have an interview,” I explained. I tapped the corner of my résumé. “I just wanted to drop my résumé off, in case you had any openings.”

The receptionist frowned. “This isn’t how we hire people,” she said.

I wasn’t sure what to do. I had expected her to thank me and take my résumé, probably place it in a folder to give to someone more important later. I clenched my teeth, struggling to maintain my smile. “I know it’s unusual, but I just thought - ”

Relief flooded through me when the receptionist finally took my résumé. “This is not how anyone does their hiring,” she said. “This is highly unprofessional and you will never get a job doing this.” I felt the smile finally slip away as she tossed my résumé into the trash can by her desk.

“I - I didn’t - I was told - ”

“This may be how your grandpa got his first job down at the steel mill after the war, but times have changed,” said the receptionist. “If you want a job, go online and apply like everyone else.”

Embarrassment shot through me as I turned and left. Why had my mother suggested this? Had she known that this would happen? Had she set me up to fail on purpose? Was this some kind of demented joke or a lame attempt at a life lesson? Ever since I’d come home, she’d been grumbling about how I didn’t have a job yet, implying that she had wasted money on my education because I wasn’t immediately employed. She’d been stomping around the house, glowering and tut-tutting every time she saw me waiting for a call from Ian. She’d been making passive-aggressive comments about my clothes and my weight since high school, and now that I was living at home again, she’d added my joblessness to her list. 

I walked back to the bus stop, trying not to cry. My feet ached. Thunder rumbled overhead as raindrops began to pitter-patter around me. I ducked under the awning, grateful that at least the bus stop had a shelter. I tried to stop replaying the whole embarrassing event in my mind. It wouldn’t be a funny story to tell Ian about later, I thought, it was a humiliation that I’d never live down, even if I never told anyone.

And would it have killed the receptionist to be a little nicer? Clearly I was way out of my depth on this one and she was acting like I’d stormed in and taken a shit on the carpet. And I had put in actual effort; she didn’t have to be impressed, but at least she had to know that I genuinely wanted a job if I was willing to show up and hand over my résumé in person. Did she really have to be so mean? She was probably telling everyone in the office about it, laughing behind my back as she recounted what an utter idiot I was.

The rain was coming down in full force when the bus finally arrived. I got on, thinking about the other résumés in my bag. Obviously, I couldn’t hand them out. I’d only be ridiculed if I did that. What if the receptionist was calling up other companies and telling them about me? Would she do that? Would she sabotage my job hunt like that just because I’d broken some unknown rule about office etiquette? 

“You’re home so early. Is something wrong?” My mother was standing in the kitchen, as if she had been waiting for me to come home so she could call me a failure for not returning with a full-time job.

I set my bag down on the counter and reached for a dish towel to dry my hair. “I’m not supposed to just go into offices and hand them my résumé,” I said.

My mother frowned. “What do you mean?”

I told her what had happened. Her frown deepened. “So, just because one secretary tells you not to hand her a résumé, you give up and come home? Is that what you’re saying? You just gave up?”

“Mom, this isn’t how people get jobs anymore,” I said. “I’m supposed to apply online like everyone else.”

My mother rolled her eyes. “Which is why showing up in person makes you stand out.”

“But Mom, that’s not what companies want!”

“How would you know?”

“Because that’s what the receptionist told me!” 

My mother signed. “If you’re this easily discouraged, then it’s no wonder you can’t get a job!” She glared at me, “sending you to college was such a waste of money.” 

\~x\~

“Are you still in your pajamas?! It’s eleven A.M.!”

My mother was standing in my bedroom doorway, droplets of rain rolling off of her raincoat and pooling on the floor by her feet. I looked back at the clock. It was just after eleven. I had been so preoccupied with waiting for Ian to call, I hadn’t moved since I’d turned on my computer. 

“I was waiting for Ian,” I explained.

My mother rolled her eyes. “Well, he obviously isn’t going to call you, is he? Unlike you, he’s busy at work.”

“It’s...” my heart sank as I counted on my fingers. “It’s midnight in Tokyo, Mom. Ian’s probably asleep.”

I hadn’t realized it was so late in Tokyo until I calculated the time. I’d been waiting since I’d gotten up at seven - had I really been sitting at my desk in my pajamas for four hours? I checked Skype one last time to be sure Ian hadn’t tried to call. Nothing.

“Well, I guess you can get off your ass and do something productive instead of moping around.” My mother stomped off and I heard her bedroom door slam. 

I got up and showered, wondering what had kept Ian. He’d been in Japan for three months and we’d only spoken four times. When he wasn’t telling me all about his adventures, he complained about the lack of internet connection in his apartment and how hard it was to find an internet cafe. Maybe he had gone out with his friends and lost track of time. Or maybe he realized that it was late but decided to skip the phone call because he needed his sleep for work. Or maybe he was having too much fun without me. I waved the thought away. He misses me, I told myself, he has to miss me.

\~x\~

The newspaper landed in my lap with a wet thump. Beads of water clinging to the plastic bag soaked into my pants as I stared dumbly down at the bag. Beside me, my mother folded her arms across her chest and cleared her throat.

“You know, I’ve never been unemployed, but I still read the Want Ads every single day,” she said. 

“Oh.” I fumbled with the slick plastic bag before tearing it open with my nails to get at the newspaper inside. The edges were soaked, the newsprint spongy and squishy beneath my fingertips. I tried to ignore the words “IS THE NEXT GREAT DEPRESSION HAPPENING?” written in gigantic type across the front page. There isn’t a depression, I told myself, there can’t be. There has to be a job out there for me.

I laid the paper out on the table in front of me and began rifling through the sections, searching for the Want Ads. My mother was tapping her foot impatiently, like she was waiting for me to open a gift and thank her for it.

“Did you even go to the career center?” she asked.

“Yes,” I said. “I told you.”

She pursed her lips and shook her head. “If you’d gone like you said you did, they would’ve given you a job. That’s what they’re supposed to do.”

“Well, they didn’t.”

She rolled her eyes. “I don’t know why I wasted all that money on your college tuition if you didn’t even bother visiting their career center.”

“But Mom, I did!” I felt hot tears stinging at my eyes and blinked them back. “Why won’t you believe me?”

“When I was in college, the career center helped get me my very first job,” my mother continued. “They helped me put together a résumé and they got me a job.”

I imagined my mother standing in front of the girl who’d looked over my résumé with her hands on her hips, shouting and stomping her foot until the girl conjured a job out of thin air for her. “Well, they don’t do that anymore,” I said.

My mother rolled her eyes again. “You know what I think?” she asked. “I don’t think you went to the career center. I think you took my hard-earned money and flushed it down the toilet with your worthless BA in English!”

I turned away from her, looking back down at the newspaper. If I kept arguing with her, I’d break down into tears and then she’d just keep going, berating and belittling me until I was sobbing. She had been the one to encourage me to get my degree in English in the first place, but if I pointed this out, she’d deny it and accuse me of tricking her. It would be just like in middle school, when she had badgered me because I wasn’t interested in seeing *Titanic*, telling me that all the normal popular girls were flocking to it and that everyone thought she was raising a weird little nerd because I didn’t care. Then, after I gave in and went to see it, she found out that Kate Winslet had appeared topless and accused me of tricking her into letting me watch a dirty movie. I could never win with her, so my best strategy was to just try and ignore her while she stood over me, squawking and calling me a liar. 	I finally found the Want Ads and bent closer to the paper, partly to get away from her incessant nagging and partly to make it look like I was actually interested in them. Maybe I would find a job and she’d finally stop shrieking about how worthless I was. My heart sank as I ran my finger along the smudgy black type. All the jobs advertised in the Want Ads were for construction companies. They were looking for forklift operators, welders, and bricklayers, not English majors. There weren’t even any secretarial positions advertised, just manual labor that I was woefully unqualified for.

“Have you even been listening to me?” my mother demanded. “When I was your age, your grandfather handed me a bill and told me that if I wanted to live in his house, I needed to pull my weight. And I did so without complaint and without tears!” My vision blurred as I bit my lip, struggling not to break down and cry. 

\~x\~

What’s the point in any of this? I wondered. I wasn’t sure how long I’d been standing in front of the medicine cabinet. I had zoned out while staring at my mother’s neatly organized collection of painkillers. Excedrin. Tylenol. Advil. Motrin. Midol. The bottles were solid white. I wondered what the pills looked like, how they would feel gliding down my throat and settling in my stomach. I shook the thought off. Just because things were a little hard now didn’t mean they’d stay that way forever, I told myself. There’s a job out there somewhere. Ian will come home. Or at least remember to call. 

“What are you doing?” my mother’s voice jolted me out of my thoughts. I grabbed the Tylenol without thinking.

“I have a headache,” I lied as I opened it and shook two pills into the palm of my hand. They were red and blue. I wondered briefly what they would look like dissolving in my stomach. Would the colors bleed together and turn purple? I popped the two pills into my mouth and placed the bottle back on the shelf.

\~x\~

I glanced at the clock. It was nearly ten a.m. I started counting on my fingers, trying to figure out what time it was in Tokyo. It was probably too late for Ian to call me. I sighed heavily, wishing that I had a better way to call him. It was almost eleven at night in Tokyo. Where was Ian? It wasn’t like him to stay out late. He was probably sleeping. I groaned with frustration; he’d gone to bed without calling me again. There has got to be a better way to reach him, I thought. He’d been in Japan for six months by now. Surely he’d have gotten his internet sorted out. Or at least found a reliable internet cafe.

I wondered if he was ignoring me on purpose, if he was biding his time and waiting for me to dump him out of frustration. I pushed the thought away. He would never want me to dump him. And, of course, he’d never dump me. He loved me. He was just busy. He was out with friends. His guy friends, I told myself. There was no way he’d ever cheat. If he had wanted to see other women, he would’ve broken things off before he went to Japan. 

I was about to close the laptop and take a shower when the Skype ringtone filled my headset. I grinned, clicking the icon harder than I really needed to in my excitement. Ian hadn’t forgotten! I brushed my hair out of my face, smiling as the call connected and Ian’s face filled the screen.

“Hey, babe!” he called, practically shouting. “Sorry I’m calling so late.”

“It’s OK,” I said. “It’s not late here.” I noticed a group of people pass behind Ian. They were holding styrofoam coffee cups and talking animatedly. “Where are you?”

Ian gestured broadly, as if I could see where he was. “This is an authentic Tokyo Internet Cafe!” He waved at someone off-screen. “Guys, come and meet Kylie!”

A man leaned in and waved at me before lifting his head to call to someone standing behind the computer.

“See! I told you she was real!” The man had a British accent, and he pointed at me as he addressed someone who wasn’t in the frame. “Pay up! You owe me!”

Ian rolled his eyes. “Knock it off, guys.” He smiled sheepishly at me. “How’ve you been? How’s the job hunt going?”

“Come on!” someone with an Australian accent called from off-screen. “This is boring! Let’s hit the karaoke bar!”

“Did your friend think I wasn’t real?” I asked. The words sounded stupid as soon as they’d left my mouth. My voice sounded high-pitched and whiny, and I forced a smile. I didn’t want Ian thinking that I was being babyish. Chances are his friends were just playing around, being silly. If I got offended by it, I’d look like a total nag. 

Ian laughed. “He thought I was doing the whole ‘I have a hot girlfriend who lives in Canada’ thing.”

“Kylie, I never doubted you were real.” The man with the British accent leaned into the frame again. I smiled, wishing that I wasn’t in my bathrobe. At least they couldn’t see my fluffy bunny slippers. 

“OK, fine, you win! She’s real!” the Australian called from off-screen again. “And I will buy the first round of drinks, but we need to get to the karaoke bar first!”

“Sorry,” said Ian. He glanced up, clearly addressing the Australian. “Dude, just give me a minute to say hi to my girlfriend.”

“You can talk to Hachiko later,” whined the Australian. Ian rolled his eyes in obvious confusion, but the British man’s eyes went wide, as if the Australian had insulted me. “It’s Friday night and I’m still sober!”

“What’s Hachiko?” I asked.

“Anime princess!” blurted the British man. “She’s this cute little anime princess - you look just like her.” He nudged Ian’s arm. “Come on, Jeff’s getting restless.”

“I’ll catch you later, babe!” called Ian.

“I love you!”

Ian was shouting something at the off-camera Australian as he hung up. I stared at the blank screen. I figured that I could watch the Hachiko anime show that the Australian had been talking about while I job-hunted, but when I tried to look it up, all I found were pictures of a dog statue at a Japanese train station. I sighed as I got up to take a shower. Maybe it was just too obscure for American audiences. 

\~x\~

The man sitting in front of me was about my age. He was wearing ripped jeans, a backwards baseball cap, a hoodie, and dirty converse sneakers. I crossed my legs at the ankles like the career coach had instructed, hoping that my pumps hadn’t gotten too scuffed on the walk over from the bus station. Surely this guy wouldn’t be paying too much attention to my clothes, given the state of his own wardrobe. I brushed the snarky thought away; at least this workplace was casual. If I got a job here, I could wear comfortable clothes.

“So I didn’t have time to read over your résumé,” said the man. 

He glanced at me, obviously expecting a response. I forced a smile and swallowed the urge to tell him that was unprofessional. “Well, that’s OK,” I managed to squeak out. I cleared my throat. “We could go over it together.”

He brushed the papers aside. “I’d rather hear directly from you,” he said, “what makes Kelly Upton good enough to work here?”

“Kylie,” I corrected.

“What?”

“My name is Kylie,” I said, “not Kelly.”

“Oh. Sorry.” He shrugged. “So, why do you want to work here?”

I wished I could scream at him, to tell him that I was willing to work anywhere - even with a jackass who couldn’t be bothered to read my résumé or get my name right - if it would get my mother off my back for five minutes. I clenched my fists, more to prevent myself from fidgeting than anything else, then took a deep breath. I can salvage this, I thought, and this will be a funny story to tell on my first work-anniversary. 

\~x\~

It was raining when I left the interview. I stood at the bus stop, wishing that there was a shelter or an overhang or something I could stand under. My feet ached from the too-tight shoes, and I could feel a blister forming on one of my heels. I was soaked and shivering when the bus finally came. I scrambled on, paid my fare, and took the last seat beside a heavily pregnant woman. She smiled wanly and scooted over, pulling her plump belly away from my soaked business suit as the bus rumbled along to the next stop.

“Excuse me.” I looked up to see a heavyset man wearing a tattered raincoat. He stared down at me, his eyes bleary and unfocused. “I’m disabled.”

I stared back at him, wondering what he wanted. The pregnant woman elbowed me, then nodded at the sign above our seats indicating that they were reserved for individuals who were pregnant, elderly, or disabled. I sighed and stood up. I limped away from the seats, giving the man space to sit down. He plopped down without acknowledging me. I held the strap, swaying as the bus continued to slosh through puddles.

The cold had seeped under my skin and was settling into my bones when I finally got off the bus and walked home. My body felt heavy, as if I had somehow absorbed the rain. My feet were waterlogged and sluggish, my uncomfortable black pumps completely soaked through, as I plodded up the steps, unlocked the front door, and trudged into the house. 

My mother was still at work. I was too tired to decide if I was disappointed or relieved. Maybe she would’ve comforted me over the crappy job interview. The interviewer had called me ‘Kelly’ two more times before telling me about the company’s occasional Saturday hours. He had promised to email me within two weeks. I changed into dry clothes before booting up my laptop and sending a thank-you email. 

The job sounded terrible, but I wanted it anyway. Working the occasional Saturday would at least get me away from my mother for a bit. And maybe Saturday hours meant more pay. I lay down on the couch, hoping that the soft corduroy cushions would provide some warmth.

\~x\~

“Are you sleeping?” My mother’s voice cut through the fog of sleep. I forced my eyes open and sat up. My mother rolled her eyes at me and shook her head. “The utter laziness!” she muttered just loud enough for me to hear.

“I had a job interview,” I said. 

“And? Have you followed up?”

“Yes,” I said. “I send a thank-you email - ”

“I meant with a phone call,” snapped my mother. She rubbed her temples. “You’re supposed to follow up with a phone call thanking them and telling them that you want to work for them.”

“And that’s what I said in the email,” I said. “Nobody wants phone calls anymore, Mom.”

“How would you know?” demanded my mother, “are you suddenly an expert?”

“Mom, I’ve had a really tough day,” I said, hating the whine in my voice almost as much as I hate the harshness in hers.

“You know, I saw Becky Wilson’s mother today,” said my mother, ignoring me. The name struck a familiar nerve, and I scrambled through my memories, trying to figure out exactly who Becky Wilson was and how I knew her. The incessant pattering of rain outside was distracting me, making me feel sluggish and out-of-sorts. 

“Becky’s mother says that she has two jobs,” she continued. “I, of course, had to tell her that you’re still looking for work.”

“Well, maybe I’d have a job if Becky Wilson wasn’t hogging them!” I shouted. The rain was so loud I could hardly hear myself. My mother blinked, flinching slightly. Despite the fact that I could barely conjure Becky’s face in my mind, I was filled with a sudden seething anger for her. How dare she hog all the jobs? How dare she not share? How dare she take something from me? That worthless greedy-guts, I thought.

“I - I just meant - ”

For the first time in my life, I interrupted my mother. “Can Kylie have a job? No, Becky Wilson just has to have two of them!” My mother flinched again, wiping at her face, and took a step back. I pressed forward, my hands flapping angrily as I shouted. “Does it matter that Kylie is doing her fucking best? Does it matter that she’s trying her hardest? No, Kylie’s a worthless piece of shit because Becky Wilson has two jobs!”

“Sweetheart, I never - ”

“I’ve never been unemployed, but I still read the Want Ads every day!” I mimicked. “I can’t do any of those jobs! I’m not qualified! I have a BA in English - do you honestly think I can just apply to be a construction worker?! ‘Can you work a forklift?’ ‘No, but I can write a ten-page paper about *Pride and Prejudice*.’ ‘Oh, of course you can have this job, let’s get you fitted for a hard hat.’ I’m not fucking qualified!”

My hands reached out and slapped my mother’s shoulders, shoving her back. My mother stumbled, her eyes wide, but managed to right herself. Her mouth opened in an O-shape. I wasn’t sure if she said anything. The rain was too loud. I stepped closer, forcing her back. My anger bubbled in my chest, boiling over and spreading out into the rest of my body. 

“I can’t get a job because Becky-fucking-Wilson stole them all!” I screamed, shoving her again. Becky’s face finally clicked in my brain; an image of a blonde girl in one of the school plays floated briefly before my mind’s eye before vanishing. I screamed, unable to articulate my rage. The world was suddenly hazy and red, my ears filled with the steady, relentless drone of the rain on the roof.

I was suddenly pressing down hard on one of the couch cushions. The grooved corduroy fabric dug into my hands, leaving lines on my palms. I stared down at the pillow, trying to figure out how it had gotten off the couch. I was sitting on something soft. When had I sat down? What was I sitting on? Where was my mother?

I looked down. It took me a moment to realize that I had been sitting on my mother’s stomach, straddling her with my legs and locking her arms to her sides. I didn’t bother lifting the pillow from her face. I stood up, swaying slightly, absently wondering when I had last eaten. Outside, the rain began to slacken. I wandered into the kitchen. Maybe once I had eaten and slept, I’d be able to figure out what to do.

My mother’s purse was on the kitchen table. I stared at it for a moment, then dumped its contents onto my placemat. I picked up my mother’s wallet with numb fingers and opened it. There wasn’t any cash, but her credit cards were neatly arrayed in little vinyl pockets. I closed the wallet and stuffed it into my pocket.

I can probably get a cheap flight to Japan, I thought as I picked up the car keys. The rain had eased into a drizzle, as if it somehow knew that I would need to drive to the airport. The whole Skype thing was too unreliable. I really needed to talk to Ian in person.

I (mostly) understand how it's supposed to be used! HOWEVER - I am brand new to budgeting in general, and I'm looking for tips to optimize YNAB to help me get out of debt/float.

Some things about me/my finances:

* I make $90k/yr, in Seattle WA (expensive AF city) (two paychecks a month)
* I'm single - so single income, single bill paying... etc.
* My rent is $2023/mo - which is ALMOST an entire paycheck (after direct deposit into savings and car payment account)
* Savings = $7k (and that took a looong time. ugh.)
* I only have credit card debt (currently about 4k) - no other big debts (car loan, but I pretend that doesn't exist by direct depositing the exact amount into it's own account, set up autopay... etc)
* I've been living on credit card float for years- carrying anywhere from 2-5k in credit card debt at a time (maybe it's not even considered ""float"" if I'm consistently in debt?)
* I have been able to pay off all credit cards a few times over the past few years (usually after a bonus at work, Christmas gift from family, big random side gig thing... etc) but immediately get right back into around the same about of debt.

Some things related to YNAB:

* I am still in the phase of seeing what all my expenses/expenditures are, so:
* I set up my categories, but keep overspending, so then take from other categories to cover the overspending... but then have no money in those categories.... so eventually over spend there too.
* I can't figure out what to do with the credit cards in YNAB - I can't assign all my money to cover the debt, because then I'll have no money to live that month. 
* How the heck do I ""age"" my money if I need to spend it all every month??

  
I'm not really looking for tips like ""stop buying coffee out in the world"" (yes I know I know), more looking for how to make YNAB work for me, to help me get out of debt and stay out of debt.

1glyk2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1glyk2g/one_month_sober_how_its_going/,One Month Sober — How It’s Going ,"Today I am thirty days sober and I wanted to share how it’s been going for me. 

Like a lot of people mention, the sleep is better already. I wasn’t drinking every day when I quit, so it probably came earlier to me than others. 

A lot of the emotions I was running from have returned. Initially, all I felt was gratitude and pride: I was finally committed to sobriety, I was making my friends and family proud, I had more time to focus on my hobbies. But as time goes on, I remember that the drinking wasn’t the only problem in my life. It was a symptom of deeper mental illness, and I have to face that now that I’m sober. I’ve had some great moments, but I’ve also felt really low. Thankfully, I’ve been able to feel my emotions without acting on them — which was impossible when I was drinking. I’m also remembering a lot of moments that should have been my wake up call to stop drinking, and I’m trying not to dwell on the shame. I can’t change the past, all I can do is stay sober today. 

A lot of my interests have lost their appeal now that I’m sober. I used to love going out dancing all night, but now I get tired. I don’t like being in big crowds. I’m a shy person, and I didn’t realize how much I’d come to rely on alcohol to make me more extroverted. I want to stay at home more, and while that bums me out at times, I know it’s more authentic to who I am. I’m bookish, I like sleeping, I’m bad in big groups — that’s how I’ve always been. It’s okay to let go on the person I thought I should be. I’d rather be a calm, introverted person than a hot mess of an extrovert. 

To the same end, I’ve put more effort into maintaining the relationships I do have. I’ve been a better friend, I quickly respond to people when they text or call me, and of course, I have a much better memory so I don’t have to ask people to repeat themselves all the time. I’m more present in conversations. 

I worry about all the damage I did to my brain. There were so many days I drank more than I ate. I feel kinda foggy a lot of the time, a little slow to respond. I hope this is just my body adjusting to life without alcohol. Knowing how much harm I was doing to my mind and body helps me stay sober, because for the first time in a long time, I want to be healthy. I want a strong body and a sharp mind. I want to become the best version of myself rather than just wasting away until my premature death. 

I raise my coffee cup to many more months of sobriety. IWNDWYT. ",6,1731007088.0,stopdrinking,3,1.0,False

I do have a operation in 4-5 weeks, which really needs to be done, but my doctor wants me to lose about 10kg. I feel like it's possible and I kinda of have a plan, but has anyone done it before in such a short time?

I'm 6'0"", female, 100kg and I work out a lot. I gained during my last 6 stressfull months and 90kg is my goal weight. I got to 85kg 2 years ago but I just continued working out and eating according to my appetite, which lead to weight gain. I have the same clothing size like my 80kg cousin (5'11"") so at least some is muscle.

I do endurance sports and run 7-10km 3 times a week since 2020, sometimes twice a week. My plan was to continue that, so I stay at about 2.5k - 3k of burned calories/day with an input of 0.5-1k calories on those days. Additonally I plan to cut to 500kcal on days without sports. I mostly eat vegetarian and without cheese and calculate my TDEE very conservatively.

Does that sound like a plan? I do have lots of HO now so I don't have to worry about dizzyness atm! I did eat about 500-1000kcal a day for the last few days and could do sports, and I'm doing fine, curiously, like I don't have hunger at all and am motivated. I drink some broth now and then aswell, and lots of coffee.

1glydjn,https://www.reddit.com/r/digital_agencies/comments/1glydjn/why_local_seo_is_a_gamechanger_for_digital/,Why Local SEO is a Game-Changer for Digital Agencies in 2024,"In an increasingly competitive market, local SEO has emerged as one of the most effective ways for businesses to connect with nearby customers. For digital agencies, offering local SEO services can be a game-changer, helping clients boost visibility, attract more in-store visits, and build trust with their community. As 2024 unfolds, here’s a closer look at why local SEO is essential for digital agencies and how they can implement it effectively to support their clients’ growth.

The Power of “Near Me” Searches

With the rise of mobile searches, more people are using phrases like “near me” to find services or products close to their location. Google’s algorithms now prioritize local results when users search for services nearby, making local SEO an incredibly valuable tool for businesses. For digital agencies, optimizing for local searches means helping clients show up when it matters most—when potential customers are actively searching in their area.

The impact of local SEO extends beyond search engine rankings. By appearing in local results, businesses benefit from improved visibility and credibility, especially if they appear in the Google 3-Pack (the top three listings in local search results). Agencies can drive more foot traffic to brick-and-mortar stores by helping clients rank in these highly visible positions.

Building a Strong Google My Business Profile

Google My Business (GMB) is the cornerstone of local SEO, and an optimized profile can significantly boost a client’s visibility. For digital agencies, creating and managing GMB profiles for clients is essential. Start by filling in every section of the GMB profile accurately—business name, address, phone number, website, operating hours, and business category.

Adding relevant keywords in the business description can help the profile appear in related searches. Agencies should also advise clients to upload high-quality images that reflect their brand, whether it’s the storefront, product shots, or photos of the team. Consistently updating the profile with new content, such as posts, announcements, or promotions, keeps it active and engages users.

Optimizing for Local Keywords

Keyword optimization is just as crucial for local SEO as it is for traditional SEO, but with a regional twist. For local SEO, agencies should focus on location-based keywords to ensure clients appear in searches for specific services in their city or neighborhood. Tools like Google Keyword Planner and Moz’s Keyword Explorer can help identify popular local search terms.

For instance, an agency working with a coffee shop in Miami might optimize for keywords like “best coffee in Miami” or “Miami coffee near me.” Including these terms in website content, meta tags, and GMB descriptions signals to Google that the business is relevant to local searches. This keyword approach also aligns with voice search optimization, as users often phrase spoken queries naturally, including location-based terms.

Collecting and Managing Online Reviews

Online reviews are among the most influential factors in local search rankings and customer decision-making. Positive reviews build credibility, enhance a business’s reputation, and can improve rankings on Google. Digital agencies should encourage clients to implement strategies for collecting reviews, such as follow-up emails or in-store prompts.

In addition to collecting reviews, agencies should help clients respond to them. Acknowledging positive reviews and professionally addressing negative ones shows potential customers that the business values feedback and is committed to a positive experience. Responding to reviews can also improve engagement on GMB, which may contribute to higher local search rankings.

Building Local Citations

Local citations are mentions of a business’s name, address, and phone number (NAP) on other websites. These citations are important for local SEO, as they provide additional validation of a business’s existence and location. Agencies should ensure that clients’ NAP information is consistent across all online platforms, including social media profiles, local directories, and review sites.

Popular citation sources include Yelp, Yellow Pages, and local business directories. Additionally, industry-specific sites can be valuable citation sources, such as Healthgrades for healthcare providers or Avvo for legal services. Ensuring NAP consistency across platforms helps avoid confusion and signals to search engines that the business is reputable.

Leveraging Local Link-Building Opportunities

Links from reputable local sources can improve a business’s local SEO by building authority within the community. Digital agencies can help clients identify local link-building opportunities, such as partnerships with nearby businesses, guest blogging on local websites, or sponsorships for local events. Agencies can also pursue backlinks from local news outlets, especially if a client has notable community involvement or hosts events.

Another effective tactic is to reach out to local influencers or bloggers. Collaborations or sponsorships can lead to backlinks and increased brand exposure within the community. The more relevant, local backlinks a client has, the stronger their credibility and ranking potential for local searches.

Utilizing Social Media to Enhance Local Presence

Social media platforms play a supportive role in local SEO by driving local engagement and reinforcing a brand’s presence in the community. For digital agencies, managing social media profiles for clients can help amplify local visibility. Sharing location-specific posts, tagging nearby businesses, and promoting local events are effective strategies to engage with a local audience.

Platforms like Facebook and Instagram allow agencies to reach local users directly through ads targeted by location. These ads can be especially effective for promoting in-store events, discounts, or new product launches. When combined with local SEO, social media provides an additional channel for connecting with nearby customers and building brand loyalty.

Tracking Local SEO Performance

To measure the success of local SEO efforts, agencies should monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) like local search rankings, website traffic, GMB engagement, and customer reviews. Tools such as Google Analytics and Moz Local can provide valuable insights into how local SEO efforts impact visibility and customer actions.

For instance, monitoring increases in local search traffic can reveal how effective the keyword strategy is, while GMB insights show customer interactions with the profile, such as calls, clicks, and views. Regularly reviewing these metrics helps agencies demonstrate the value of local SEO to clients and fine-tune strategies based on performance.

Conclusion: The Role of Local SEO for Digital Agencies in 2024

Local SEO is more than just a service—it’s a critical strategy for connecting businesses with their communities. For digital agencies, offering comprehensive local SEO services means helping clients stand out in a crowded market, reach more nearby customers, and build trust in their neighborhoods. By focusing on Google My Business optimization, local keywords, online reviews, and link-building, agencies can help clients thrive in the local search landscape.

As local SEO continues to grow in importance, agencies that excel in this area will be well-positioned to support their clients’ growth and establish themselves as leaders in digital marketing.

I was inspired by my girlfriend, who wanted to casually play Duel Masters, as well as the fantastic community of active Duel Masters players. So, I decided to revive the Duel Masters implementation in [OCTGN](https://www.octgn.net/Home/GetOctgn), even though my Python skills are pretty basic, I believed it was a task I could take on.

When I dove into the code, I quickly discovered that only a few essential actions and card effects were actually programmed, mostly those that trigger when a card is played or destroyed. I reached out to the community for a list of commonly used cards and got to work. After a few days, I compiled a pretty exciting changelog!

Here are some of the standout updates:

* **Many cards got an automation or got fixed:** Soulswap, Apocalypse Vise, Cranium Clamp, Slash Charger, Scarlet Skyterror, Emeral, **and many more!**
* **Automated Survivor Effects:** If you have **Factory Shell Q** on the table and play **Blazosaur Q**, you'll get a search.
* **Automated Wavestrikers:** If there are 3 or more wavestrikers on the board, their effects activate when played or destroyed.
* **Tap Effects Added:** During your turn, if you tap an automated creature with a Tap Effect, you'll get a prompt asking if you want to use the Tap effect.
* **Silent Skill Effects Added:** After your opponent ends their turn, during the untapping phase, if you have a Silent Skill creature tapped on your side of the board, you'll get a prompt to activate the Silent Skill effect!
* **""At the end of your turn"" Effects Implementation Added**
* **""At the start of your turn"" Effects Implementation Added**

My name is James, i’m 23 and from Michigan. I went camping about 3 months ago with 3 of my closest friends: Travis, Ellie and Rachel. This was supposed to be a fun and relaxing time where we could disconnect from the world and just have fun as we used to. Let me get into the story, firstly I was picked up by Travis who already had Ellie in the truck, and Rachel was to be picked up after me.

The car ride to the forest was pretty and the company was good so the start of this trip was amazing.

Then we arrived, the forest was dense. Darker than I’d expected. As we trudged up the winding trail to our campsite, I felt like we were descending into another world, one where the sun barely reached the ground. Shadows gathered between the thick trunks, and the trees seemed to close in around us, branches reaching overhead to form a sort of canopy that blocked out the sky.

Ellie, walking ahead of me, looked back with a grin, her blonde hair catching what little light filtered through the leaves. “You okay back there, James? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

I forced a smile, gripping the straps of my pack tighter. “Just… taking it all in. This place is a lot wilder than I thought it’d be.”

She chuckled, turning back toward the trail. Travis and Rachel, further up, were talking and laughing, completely at ease. Travis, always the jokester, had brought some ridiculous straw hat and oversized hiking boots, adding to his usual over-the-top charm. Rachel, usually quiet, was actually smiling, enjoying his antics.

Maybe I was just tired, but something about this forest unsettled me. The silence was deep, almost oppressive. No birdsong, no wind rustling the branches—just the soft crunch of our footsteps and the occasional crack of a twig.

It took us about an hour to reach our campsite, a small clearing surrounded by towering pines. As soon as we dropped our gear, Travis was already busy setting up his tent, joking about his “luxury suite” with all the extras he’d packed. Ellie and Rachel were chatting, laughing as they tried to figure out their own tents. I tried to join in, but I kept feeling like someone was watching us, eyes lurking just beyond the edge of the trees.

The sun was beginning to set by the time we finished setting up. Travis built a fire, and we all gathered around it as the darkness crept in. The flames cast flickering shadows across our faces, making everything feel surreal. I didn’t want to admit it, but the shadows in this forest felt wrong, somehow too deep, too alive.

Ellie leaned in, her face illuminated by the glow. “All right, who’s got a scary story? It’s not camping without one!”

Travis immediately launched into an exaggerated tale about a monster in the woods, a story he’d probably heard as a kid. It was about an old trapper who’d gone missing years ago, only to come back as a “forest wraith,” haunting the woods and dragging people into the shadows. He added his own dramatic touches, making the creature sound hideous, with claws like knives and teeth as sharp as razors. Rachel laughed, throwing a pinecone at him.

“Oh, come on! You don’t actually expect us to be scared by that, do you?” she scoffed.

I laughed too, but it felt forced. Part of me wanted to tell them how I felt—the sense that we weren’t alone, that something was lurking just out of sight. But I didn’t want to sound paranoid, so I kept quiet, staring into the fire instead.

The forest around us grew darker as the night settled in, the trees looming like silent sentinels. Eventually, the others drifted off to their tents, their laughter fading as they zipped up and settled down for the night. I was left alone by the fire, the last of the embers casting faint, fading light.

I wanted to go to bed, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was out there, watching me. I stared into the trees, my heart pounding, every muscle tense. The silence was complete, save for the soft crackle of the dying fire.

Then, I saw it.

Just beyond the firelight, half-hidden by the trees, was a figure. At first, I thought it was one of the others, maybe Travis messing around. But as I squinted, I realized something was off. The figure was… wrong. Its limbs were too long, its posture too stiff, like it wasn’t used to moving like a human.

I froze, my breath catching in my throat. The figure didn’t move, didn’t make a sound—it just stood there, staring at me. Its eyes caught the firelight, reflecting back at me in two pinpoints of dark, glassy light.

I wanted to call out, to ask who it was, but the words died in my throat. I felt an overwhelming urge to look away, but I couldn’t. The figure seemed to be drawing me in, holding me captive with its gaze.

Then, just as quickly as it had appeared, it melted back into the shadows, disappearing into the darkness. My heart was pounding, my hands shaking. I wanted to believe I’d imagined it, that it was just a trick of the light or a shadow cast by the trees. But deep down, I knew I hadn’t.

I sat there for a long time, staring into the darkness, half-expecting the figure to reappear. But the forest remained silent, the shadows undisturbed. Finally, I forced myself to get up, to douse the fire and crawl into my tent.

Inside, I lay awake, listening to the silence, every rustle and creak setting my nerves on edge. I kept telling myself it was just my imagination, that I was letting Travis’s story get to me. But even as I closed my eyes, the image of that figure lingered, etched into my mind.

The last thing I remember before sleep finally claimed me was a feeling of eyes on me, watching from somewhere in the darkness, just beyond the thin fabric of my tent.

When I woke up, the sunlight filtering through the trees felt like a relief. The forest seemed less oppressive in the daylight, less… aware. I stepped outside my tent, blinking against the brightness, and found the others already up, sipping coffee and chatting like nothing had happened.

Ellie looked over at me, grinning. “Rough night? You look like you didn’t sleep at all.”

I forced a laugh, rubbing my eyes. “Just couldn’t get comfortable, I guess.”

I wanted to tell them about the figure, but as I looked around, it felt silly. In the daylight, the forest looked almost normal. Peaceful, even. Besides, I knew they’d just laugh it off as a shadow or a trick of my tired mind.

Travis handed me a cup of coffee, a grin on his face. “You need to relax, man. This is supposed to be a getaway, not some horror movie.”

I nodded, taking a sip of the coffee, hoping the warmth would shake off the remnants of my fear. But as I looked out into the trees, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was still out there, watching, waiting for nightfall to return.

I’d like to say that breakfast shook off the unease from last night, but the nagging feeling wouldn’t leave me. I kept glancing over my shoulder, scanning the trees as if expecting that figure to materialize in the daylight.

The others didn’t seem to notice, though. Travis was busy making everyone laugh with a ridiculous story about his last camping trip. Ellie kept glancing over at him, her laughter bright against the morning stillness, while Rachel, ever reserved, offered a quiet smile. I tried to focus on the warmth of the coffee in my hands, the crackling of the fire. But it was no use. I was still haunted by the figure, by those two pinpricks of light in the dark.

After breakfast, we decided to explore deeper into the woods, take a look at the stream Travis had spotted on the map. I was hesitant but didn’t want to be the one to kill the vibe, so I pushed down my misgivings and followed along.

The forest seemed even darker today, somehow. The trees loomed overhead like silent guards, their branches clawing at the sky. The silence felt heavy, like it was pressing down on us. I noticed that even the others were starting to seem a little quieter, their laughter and conversation fading as we walked deeper.

Eventually, we stumbled across something that made us all stop.

It was a pile of stones, stacked in a rough, haphazard cairn in the middle of the trail. The stones were smeared with a dark, sticky substance that looked… disturbingly like blood.

“What the hell is this?” Ellie whispered, her face pale.

Travis shrugged, his tone a little less cocky than usual. “Probably some kind of prank. You know, to freak out campers.”

I could tell he didn’t believe that. None of us did.

I knelt down to get a closer look, my stomach twisting. The smell coming off the stones was faint but unmistakable—metallic, like blood. I reached out to touch one of the stones, but a sudden instinct made me pull back. Something told me it would be a mistake to disturb it.

Rachel took a step back, looking around nervously. “Maybe we should head back to camp. This doesn’t feel… right.”

I nodded, relief flooding through me. But Travis shrugged, trying to shake off the tension. “Come on, guys. We’re not going to let some creepy rocks ruin our trip. Let’s just keep going.”

No one argued, but as we continued down the trail, the silence felt deeper, more ominous. I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were being watched, like something was lurking just beyond the trees, waiting for us to let our guard down.

We reached the stream, but the usual relief of finding a clear, open area didn’t come. The stream ran through a small clearing, bordered by mossy rocks and low-hanging branches. It was beautiful, I suppose, but something about the place felt… wrong. The air was damp, heavy, and it felt like the shadows under the trees were watching us.

Ellie knelt by the water, filling her bottle, and Rachel joined her. I stayed back, glancing around at the trees, unable to shake the sense that we weren’t alone. Travis noticed and nudged me with his elbow.

“Hey, you good? You’ve been jumpy all morning.”

I forced a smile, not wanting to seem paranoid. “Yeah, I’m fine. Just… something about this place, you know?”

He nodded, his expression uncharacteristically serious. “I get it, man. It’s a little weird out here. But we’re probably just spooking ourselves.”

Just as he finished speaking, Ellie let out a soft gasp. We turned to see her staring at something carved into the bark of a tree, a few feet from where she was kneeling.

It was a symbol—a strange, twisted shape that looked almost like an eye with a line slashed through it. The bark around it was dark, charred, as if someone had burned it into the tree.

“Who would do something like this out here?” Rachel whispered, a tremor in her voice.

Ellie reached out, tracing the mark with her finger. “It feels… recent.”

Something about the symbol made my skin crawl. I wanted to tell them about the figure I’d seen last night, but I wasn’t sure how. I knew it sounded crazy, and they’d probably just laugh it off or think I’d had too much to drink. So instead, I just stared at the symbol, feeling an odd sense of dread settle over me.

“Let’s go back,” I said, my voice barely a whisper. “I think we should go back.”

This time, no one argued.

We made it back to camp just as the sun was beginning to set. The whole walk back, I felt like something was trailing us, keeping just out of sight. Even Travis was quiet, his usual jokes and comments nowhere to be found.

We sat around the fire that night, but the atmosphere was tense. No one wanted to bring up what we’d seen, but it was hanging there between us, an unspoken weight pressing down on us.

Ellie broke the silence, her voice barely audible over the crackling flames. “Do you guys… do you feel like we’re being watched?”

I looked at her, surprised that she’d voiced exactly what I’d been thinking.

Rachel nodded, her eyes darting toward the trees. “I haven’t felt right since we saw that pile of rocks. It feels like… like something’s out there.”

Travis scoffed, but I could tell he was rattled too. “Come on, guys. It’s just a creepy forest. We’re probably just letting it get to us.”

But even as he spoke, his eyes kept drifting to the shadows, his hands twitching nervously.

The fire crackled, casting dancing shadows across the trees. I was staring into the flames, trying to calm myself, when I heard it—a low, guttural growl coming from somewhere beyond the firelight.

I froze, my heart pounding. The others heard it too; I could see their faces go pale, their eyes wide with fear.

“What… was that?” Ellie whispered, her voice shaking.

We sat in silence, straining to hear. The growling came again, closer this time, a deep, primal sound that sent a shiver down my spine.

Then, before we could react, something lunged into the edge of the firelight.

It was the figure from last night, but now I could see it more clearly. Its limbs were twisted and unnatural, its eyes hollow and unblinking. Its skin was a sickly, mottled gray, stretched tight over sharp bones. And its mouth… its mouth was open, revealing a set of jagged teeth that gleamed in the firelight.

Travis let out a strangled scream, grabbing a branch from the fire and brandishing it at the creature. But it didn’t back away. Instead, it took a step closer, its eyes locked onto us, unblinking.

In the next instant, it lunged, swiping at Travis with one of its long, bony hands. He stumbled back, clutching his arm, blood seeping through his fingers.

“Get back!” I shouted, grabbing a burning log from the fire and swinging it at the creature. The flames seemed to startle it, and it retreated, melting back into the shadows.

We sat there, panting, our hearts racing. Travis was pale, clutching his bleeding arm, his face twisted with pain and fear.

Ellie knelt beside him, trying to stem the bleeding with a piece of cloth. “Oh my God… what was that?”

I didn’t have an answer. All I knew was that the thing I’d seen last night was real, and it wasn’t just watching us anymore. It was hunting us.

We sat in silence, too afraid to speak, too afraid to move. The fire crackled, casting flickering shadows that seemed to dance and twist, mocking us. The forest around us was silent again, but I knew the creature was still out there, lurking just beyond the light, waiting for its next chance.

As I glanced at Travis’s wound, a horrible thought crept into my mind: whatever that creature was, it had marked him. And I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were all next.

I barely slept after the attack. Travis’s wound throbbed and bled well into the night, and though Ellie tried to keep it clean, it only seemed to worsen. I could hear him muttering in his sleep, his voice feverish, like he was caught in a nightmare he couldn’t escape.

When dawn finally broke, it felt like a reprieve, a fragile shield against whatever stalked us in the darkness. But even the daylight seemed weaker, as if the forest itself was rejecting the sun. Shadows stretched long and dark between the trees, and the usual chirping of birds and rustling of animals was eerily absent.

Ellie, Rachel, and I gathered around Travis, checking on him as he drifted in and out of sleep. The cut on his arm looked… wrong. The skin around it was swollen, angry red, as if it were infected, but something about it seemed unnatural, almost as though it were spreading under the skin.

Ellie’s face was pale, her eyes wide with fear. “We need to get him out of here,” she said, her voice trembling. “This isn’t just an infection. There’s something… wrong with him.”

I nodded, but a sick feeling settled in my stomach. I knew, deep down, that leaving wouldn’t be as easy as just packing up and hiking out. I could feel it, pressing in from all sides—the forest didn’t want us to leave. It was like we’d stumbled into something ancient, something that didn’t take kindly to intruders.

But we had to try. We packed up as quickly as we could, supporting Travis as we made our way down the trail. Every step felt like a struggle, like the trees were closing in around us, trying to trap us. Travis was barely conscious, his skin cold and clammy. His breathing was shallow, his eyes glassy.

By midday, we reached the pile of stones from yesterday. But something was different. The stones were scattered, lying haphazardly on the ground. And in the center of the disturbed pile was something that made my blood run cold—a single, bloody claw mark, scratched into the dirt.

Rachel gasped, her hand flying to her mouth. “It’s… it’s following us.”

Ellie gripped my arm, her face as pale as I’d ever seen it. “James… what is this? What are we dealing with?”

I shook my head, my voice hollow. “I don’t know. But whatever it is, it’s not going to let us leave.”

We kept moving, but the tension was suffocating. Every rustle, every snap of a twig set our nerves on edge. The forest felt alive, malevolent, like it was watching us, waiting for the right moment to strike. And with every step, I could feel the creature getting closer, stalking us, driving us deeper into its territory.

By the time night fell, we were too exhausted to continue. Travis was barely conscious, and even I could feel the weight of exhaustion bearing down on me. We decided to set up camp one last time, hoping that somehow, we’d make it through the night.

We built the fire bigger than usual, the flames casting a protective ring of light around us. Travis was lying by the fire, his breathing shallow, his face pale and drawn. Ellie and Rachel sat beside him, keeping watch, their eyes darting nervously into the darkness.

I stood on the edge of the firelight, scanning the trees, every muscle in my body tense. I knew it was out there, watching us. I could feel its presence, lurking just beyond the reach of the flames, waiting for the moment when our defenses were down.

Then, without warning, the silence shattered.

A low, guttural growl echoed through the trees, vibrating through the ground beneath us. The sound was deep, primal, sending a shiver down my spine. I turned, my heart pounding, and saw a pair of glowing eyes staring at us from the darkness.

“It’s here,” I whispered, my voice barely audible over the crackling flames.

The others looked up, their faces pale with terror. The creature stepped into the edge of the firelight, its twisted form even more grotesque than before. Its limbs were long and skeletal, its skin stretched tight over sharp bones. And its face… its face was a nightmare, a twisted mockery of a human face, with hollow eyes and a mouth that stretched too wide, filled with jagged, gleaming teeth.

It let out a low, rumbling growl, and I felt a wave of cold wash over me. The creature was watching us, sizing us up, as if deciding which one of us to take first.

Travis let out a weak, delirious laugh, his eyes glassy with fever. “You… you’re all seeing it too, right?” he murmured, his voice slurred. “It’s not just… not just me?”

Ellie gripped his hand, her face filled with terror. “Stay with us, Travis. Just stay with us.”

But I could see the life draining from his eyes, his skin growing paler, his breaths slower. The creature took another step forward, its gaze fixed on him, almost… hungry.

“Stay back!” I shouted, grabbing a burning branch from the fire and waving it at the creature. But it didn’t flinch, didn’t even blink. Instead, it tilted its head, as if amused, and let out a low, rumbling laugh that sounded more like a growl.

Rachel clutched my arm, her voice shaking. “James, what do we do?”

I didn’t have an answer. The creature was too close, too real. I could feel the weight of its presence, the malice radiating from it like a physical force.

Then, without warning, it lunged.

It moved with inhuman speed, its twisted limbs propelling it forward in a blur. I swung the branch, but it dodged easily, its hollow eyes fixed on Travis. Ellie screamed, clutching him, but the creature reached out, its claws slicing through the air, and raked them across his chest.

Blood sprayed, and Travis let out a choked gasp, his eyes wide with pain. But in the next instant, something incredible happened.

The fire flared, as if in response to the creature’s attack. The flames roared higher, casting an intense light that drove the creature back, its twisted face contorted in anger. It let out a snarl, retreating into the shadows, its eyes blazing with fury.

For a moment, there was silence, broken only by Travis’s ragged breathing. Ellie clutched him, tears streaming down her face, and Rachel collapsed beside them, sobbing.

I stood there, gripping the branch, staring into the darkness where the creature had vanished. I knew it wasn’t gone. It was still out there, lurking in the shadows, waiting for its next opportunity.

But as I looked down at Travis, I realized that he was beyond saving. His skin was cold, his breathing shallow. Whatever the creature had done to him, it had marked him, drained him of life, leaving him a hollow shell.

Ellie looked up at me, her face streaked with tears. “We have to leave. Now.”

I nodded, feeling the weight of exhaustion bearing down on me. We gathered what little we had left, supporting Travis as best we could, and stumbled out of the campsite, into the darkness.

We didn’t stop, didn’t look back. The forest was alive with shadows, the trees closing in around us, but we pushed forward, driven by sheer terror. Travis’s breathing grew weaker with every step, and I knew he wouldn’t make it, but we couldn’t stop. The creature was still out there, trailing us, waiting for the moment we faltered.

By the time we finally broke through the trees and reached the edge of the forest, the first light of dawn was creeping over the horizon. The creature hadn’t followed us into the open. It was as if it were bound to the forest, unable to leave.

We collapsed on the edge of the road, gasping for breath, our bodies exhausted, our minds numb with terror. Travis was barely conscious, his skin pale and cold, his eyes unfocused. Ellie held him, her face wet with tears, but there was nothing we could do.

As the sun rose, I looked back at the forest, at the dark line of trees looming against the light. I could feel its presence still, lurking just beyond the edge, watching us, waiting. The creature was still out there, bound to the shadows, a nightmare that would haunt my mind forever.

And as we sat there, broken and exhausted, I realized that the forest had claimed us. We might have escaped, but a part of us would always remain, forever bound to the darkness, to the creature that had marked us as its own.

I've been making coffee at home for 2 years almost exclusively milk based drinks i.e. flat whites although I enjoy sampling the shots before adding them. I make one/two coffees per day and am based in the UK.

I've been using a Eureka Mignon Mk1 with stock burrs paired with an unmodified Gaggia Classic and these beans: [https://www.coaltowncoffee.co.uk/products/black-gold-no3](https://www.coaltowncoffee.co.uk/products/black-gold-no3) I'm largely happy with the shots and drinks that I'm making but would like more repeatable drinks. I'm going on an intermediate barista course later this month!

I'm buying a Sage Dual Boiler machine to improve my workflow so I don't need to wait for the steam boiler to heat up and am looking forward to having the PID functionality to help with my temperature control.

Partially because I've always heard you should spend more on the grinder than on the machine and partially because there's a good deal on it at the moment I'm thinking of upgrading my grinder too. After looking at a lot of reviews including James Hoffman and Lance Hedrick's stuff the Timemore 064s looks like the frontrunner - best price I've found is £500 delivered.

Other contender is the 078s which would be £700 delivered although from what I've seen the difference seems minimal and I've not really messed around with light roasts much which I \*think\* is where the larger burrs may help.

Wanted to run this by the reddit hivemind to see if there were any thoughts/feelings on my idea given that I'm looking at spending over £1k on the pair. Thank you!

Edit: A bit more looking and the DF83/DF83v are also contenders for the grinder - advice appreciated! ",2,1731006015.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

Java monsters are okay but I don't think they taste very good. Most of the Starbucks ones taste fine but they have way less caffeine; if you get the higher caffeine content they taste worse and you're spending twice as much as any of the other ones. 

I'm trying to think of others I've tried - Dunkin and Delight are the other big ones that I remember. They're also just okay, with some flavors being very bad. I find that the weird canned malt flavor is very prevalent in most of these.

My name is James, i’m 23 and from Michigan. I went camping about 3 months ago with 3 of my closest friends: Travis, Ellie and Rachel. This was supposed to be a fun and relaxing time where we could disconnect from the world and just have fun as we used to. Let me get into the story, firstly I was picked up by Travis who already had Ellie in the truck, and Rachel was to be picked up after me.

The car ride to the forest was pretty and the company was good so the start of this trip was amazing.

Then we arrived, the forest was dense. Darker than I’d expected. As we trudged up the winding trail to our campsite, I felt like we were descending into another world, one where the sun barely reached the ground. Shadows gathered between the thick trunks, and the trees seemed to close in around us, branches reaching overhead to form a sort of canopy that blocked out the sky.

Ellie, walking ahead of me, looked back with a grin, her blonde hair catching what little light filtered through the leaves. “You okay back there, James? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

I forced a smile, gripping the straps of my pack tighter. “Just… taking it all in. This place is a lot wilder than I thought it’d be.”

She chuckled, turning back toward the trail. Travis and Rachel, further up, were talking and laughing, completely at ease. Travis, always the jokester, had brought some ridiculous straw hat and oversized hiking boots, adding to his usual over-the-top charm. Rachel, usually quiet, was actually smiling, enjoying his antics.

Maybe I was just tired, but something about this forest unsettled me. The silence was deep, almost oppressive. No birdsong, no wind rustling the branches—just the soft crunch of our footsteps and the occasional crack of a twig.

It took us about an hour to reach our campsite, a small clearing surrounded by towering pines. As soon as we dropped our gear, Travis was already busy setting up his tent, joking about his “luxury suite” with all the extras he’d packed. Ellie and Rachel were chatting, laughing as they tried to figure out their own tents. I tried to join in, but I kept feeling like someone was watching us, eyes lurking just beyond the edge of the trees.

The sun was beginning to set by the time we finished setting up. Travis built a fire, and we all gathered around it as the darkness crept in. The flames cast flickering shadows across our faces, making everything feel surreal. I didn’t want to admit it, but the shadows in this forest felt wrong, somehow too deep, too alive.

Ellie leaned in, her face illuminated by the glow. “All right, who’s got a scary story? It’s not camping without one!”

Travis immediately launched into an exaggerated tale about a monster in the woods, a story he’d probably heard as a kid. It was about an old trapper who’d gone missing years ago, only to come back as a “forest wraith,” haunting the woods and dragging people into the shadows. He added his own dramatic touches, making the creature sound hideous, with claws like knives and teeth as sharp as razors. Rachel laughed, throwing a pinecone at him.

“Oh, come on! You don’t actually expect us to be scared by that, do you?” she scoffed.

I laughed too, but it felt forced. Part of me wanted to tell them how I felt—the sense that we weren’t alone, that something was lurking just out of sight. But I didn’t want to sound paranoid, so I kept quiet, staring into the fire instead.

The forest around us grew darker as the night settled in, the trees looming like silent sentinels. Eventually, the others drifted off to their tents, their laughter fading as they zipped up and settled down for the night. I was left alone by the fire, the last of the embers casting faint, fading light.

I wanted to go to bed, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was out there, watching me. I stared into the trees, my heart pounding, every muscle tense. The silence was complete, save for the soft crackle of the dying fire.

Then, I saw it.

Just beyond the firelight, half-hidden by the trees, was a figure. At first, I thought it was one of the others, maybe Travis messing around. But as I squinted, I realized something was off. The figure was… wrong. Its limbs were too long, its posture too stiff, like it wasn’t used to moving like a human.

I froze, my breath catching in my throat. The figure didn’t move, didn’t make a sound—it just stood there, staring at me. Its eyes caught the firelight, reflecting back at me in two pinpoints of dark, glassy light.

I wanted to call out, to ask who it was, but the words died in my throat. I felt an overwhelming urge to look away, but I couldn’t. The figure seemed to be drawing me in, holding me captive with its gaze.

Then, just as quickly as it had appeared, it melted back into the shadows, disappearing into the darkness. My heart was pounding, my hands shaking. I wanted to believe I’d imagined it, that it was just a trick of the light or a shadow cast by the trees. But deep down, I knew I hadn’t.

I sat there for a long time, staring into the darkness, half-expecting the figure to reappear. But the forest remained silent, the shadows undisturbed. Finally, I forced myself to get up, to douse the fire and crawl into my tent.

Inside, I lay awake, listening to the silence, every rustle and creak setting my nerves on edge. I kept telling myself it was just my imagination, that I was letting Travis’s story get to me. But even as I closed my eyes, the image of that figure lingered, etched into my mind.

The last thing I remember before sleep finally claimed me was a feeling of eyes on me, watching from somewhere in the darkness, just beyond the thin fabric of my tent.

When I woke up, the sunlight filtering through the trees felt like a relief. The forest seemed less oppressive in the daylight, less… aware. I stepped outside my tent, blinking against the brightness, and found the others already up, sipping coffee and chatting like nothing had happened.

Ellie looked over at me, grinning. “Rough night? You look like you didn’t sleep at all.”

I forced a laugh, rubbing my eyes. “Just couldn’t get comfortable, I guess.”

I wanted to tell them about the figure, but as I looked around, it felt silly. In the daylight, the forest looked almost normal. Peaceful, even. Besides, I knew they’d just laugh it off as a shadow or a trick of my tired mind.

Travis handed me a cup of coffee, a grin on his face. “You need to relax, man. This is supposed to be a getaway, not some horror movie.”

I nodded, taking a sip of the coffee, hoping the warmth would shake off the remnants of my fear. But as I looked out into the trees, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was still out there, watching, waiting for nightfall to return.

I’d like to say that breakfast shook off the unease from last night, but the nagging feeling wouldn’t leave me. I kept glancing over my shoulder, scanning the trees as if expecting that figure to materialize in the daylight.

The others didn’t seem to notice, though. Travis was busy making everyone laugh with a ridiculous story about his last camping trip. Ellie kept glancing over at him, her laughter bright against the morning stillness, while Rachel, ever reserved, offered a quiet smile. I tried to focus on the warmth of the coffee in my hands, the crackling of the fire. But it was no use. I was still haunted by the figure, by those two pinpricks of light in the dark.

After breakfast, we decided to explore deeper into the woods, take a look at the stream Travis had spotted on the map. I was hesitant but didn’t want to be the one to kill the vibe, so I pushed down my misgivings and followed along.

The forest seemed even darker today, somehow. The trees loomed overhead like silent guards, their branches clawing at the sky. The silence felt heavy, like it was pressing down on us. I noticed that even the others were starting to seem a little quieter, their laughter and conversation fading as we walked deeper.

Eventually, we stumbled across something that made us all stop.

It was a pile of stones, stacked in a rough, haphazard cairn in the middle of the trail. The stones were smeared with a dark, sticky substance that looked… disturbingly like blood.

“What the hell is this?” Ellie whispered, her face pale.

Travis shrugged, his tone a little less cocky than usual. “Probably some kind of prank. You know, to freak out campers.”

I could tell he didn’t believe that. None of us did.

I knelt down to get a closer look, my stomach twisting. The smell coming off the stones was faint but unmistakable—metallic, like blood. I reached out to touch one of the stones, but a sudden instinct made me pull back. Something told me it would be a mistake to disturb it.

Rachel took a step back, looking around nervously. “Maybe we should head back to camp. This doesn’t feel… right.”

I nodded, relief flooding through me. But Travis shrugged, trying to shake off the tension. “Come on, guys. We’re not going to let some creepy rocks ruin our trip. Let’s just keep going.”

No one argued, but as we continued down the trail, the silence felt deeper, more ominous. I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were being watched, like something was lurking just beyond the trees, waiting for us to let our guard down.

We reached the stream, but the usual relief of finding a clear, open area didn’t come. The stream ran through a small clearing, bordered by mossy rocks and low-hanging branches. It was beautiful, I suppose, but something about the place felt… wrong. The air was damp, heavy, and it felt like the shadows under the trees were watching us.

Ellie knelt by the water, filling her bottle, and Rachel joined her. I stayed back, glancing around at the trees, unable to shake the sense that we weren’t alone. Travis noticed and nudged me with his elbow.

“Hey, you good? You’ve been jumpy all morning.”

I forced a smile, not wanting to seem paranoid. “Yeah, I’m fine. Just… something about this place, you know?”

He nodded, his expression uncharacteristically serious. “I get it, man. It’s a little weird out here. But we’re probably just spooking ourselves.”

Just as he finished speaking, Ellie let out a soft gasp. We turned to see her staring at something carved into the bark of a tree, a few feet from where she was kneeling.

It was a symbol—a strange, twisted shape that looked almost like an eye with a line slashed through it. The bark around it was dark, charred, as if someone had burned it into the tree.

“Who would do something like this out here?” Rachel whispered, a tremor in her voice.

Ellie reached out, tracing the mark with her finger. “It feels… recent.”

Something about the symbol made my skin crawl. I wanted to tell them about the figure I’d seen last night, but I wasn’t sure how. I knew it sounded crazy, and they’d probably just laugh it off or think I’d had too much to drink. So instead, I just stared at the symbol, feeling an odd sense of dread settle over me.

“Let’s go back,” I said, my voice barely a whisper. “I think we should go back.”

This time, no one argued.

We made it back to camp just as the sun was beginning to set. The whole walk back, I felt like something was trailing us, keeping just out of sight. Even Travis was quiet, his usual jokes and comments nowhere to be found.

We sat around the fire that night, but the atmosphere was tense. No one wanted to bring up what we’d seen, but it was hanging there between us, an unspoken weight pressing down on us.

Ellie broke the silence, her voice barely audible over the crackling flames. “Do you guys… do you feel like we’re being watched?”

I looked at her, surprised that she’d voiced exactly what I’d been thinking.

Rachel nodded, her eyes darting toward the trees. “I haven’t felt right since we saw that pile of rocks. It feels like… like something’s out there.”

Travis scoffed, but I could tell he was rattled too. “Come on, guys. It’s just a creepy forest. We’re probably just letting it get to us.”

But even as he spoke, his eyes kept drifting to the shadows, his hands twitching nervously.

The fire crackled, casting dancing shadows across the trees. I was staring into the flames, trying to calm myself, when I heard it—a low, guttural growl coming from somewhere beyond the firelight.

I froze, my heart pounding. The others heard it too; I could see their faces go pale, their eyes wide with fear.

“What… was that?” Ellie whispered, her voice shaking.

We sat in silence, straining to hear. The growling came again, closer this time, a deep, primal sound that sent a shiver down my spine.

Then, before we could react, something lunged into the edge of the firelight.

It was the figure from last night, but now I could see it more clearly. Its limbs were twisted and unnatural, its eyes hollow and unblinking. Its skin was a sickly, mottled gray, stretched tight over sharp bones. And its mouth… its mouth was open, revealing a set of jagged teeth that gleamed in the firelight.

Travis let out a strangled scream, grabbing a branch from the fire and brandishing it at the creature. But it didn’t back away. Instead, it took a step closer, its eyes locked onto us, unblinking.

In the next instant, it lunged, swiping at Travis with one of its long, bony hands. He stumbled back, clutching his arm, blood seeping through his fingers.

“Get back!” I shouted, grabbing a burning log from the fire and swinging it at the creature. The flames seemed to startle it, and it retreated, melting back into the shadows.

We sat there, panting, our hearts racing. Travis was pale, clutching his bleeding arm, his face twisted with pain and fear.

Ellie knelt beside him, trying to stem the bleeding with a piece of cloth. “Oh my God… what was that?”

I didn’t have an answer. All I knew was that the thing I’d seen last night was real, and it wasn’t just watching us anymore. It was hunting us.

We sat in silence, too afraid to speak, too afraid to move. The fire crackled, casting flickering shadows that seemed to dance and twist, mocking us. The forest around us was silent again, but I knew the creature was still out there, lurking just beyond the light, waiting for its next chance.

As I glanced at Travis’s wound, a horrible thought crept into my mind: whatever that creature was, it had marked him. And I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were all next.

I barely slept after the attack. Travis’s wound throbbed and bled well into the night, and though Ellie tried to keep it clean, it only seemed to worsen. I could hear him muttering in his sleep, his voice feverish, like he was caught in a nightmare he couldn’t escape.

When dawn finally broke, it felt like a reprieve, a fragile shield against whatever stalked us in the darkness. But even the daylight seemed weaker, as if the forest itself was rejecting the sun. Shadows stretched long and dark between the trees, and the usual chirping of birds and rustling of animals was eerily absent.

Ellie, Rachel, and I gathered around Travis, checking on him as he drifted in and out of sleep. The cut on his arm looked… wrong. The skin around it was swollen, angry red, as if it were infected, but something about it seemed unnatural, almost as though it were spreading under the skin.

Ellie’s face was pale, her eyes wide with fear. “We need to get him out of here,” she said, her voice trembling. “This isn’t just an infection. There’s something… wrong with him.”

I nodded, but a sick feeling settled in my stomach. I knew, deep down, that leaving wouldn’t be as easy as just packing up and hiking out. I could feel it, pressing in from all sides—the forest didn’t want us to leave. It was like we’d stumbled into something ancient, something that didn’t take kindly to intruders.

But we had to try. We packed up as quickly as we could, supporting Travis as we made our way down the trail. Every step felt like a struggle, like the trees were closing in around us, trying to trap us. Travis was barely conscious, his skin cold and clammy. His breathing was shallow, his eyes glassy.

By midday, we reached the pile of stones from yesterday. But something was different. The stones were scattered, lying haphazardly on the ground. And in the center of the disturbed pile was something that made my blood run cold—a single, bloody claw mark, scratched into the dirt.

Rachel gasped, her hand flying to her mouth. “It’s… it’s following us.”

Ellie gripped my arm, her face as pale as I’d ever seen it. “James… what is this? What are we dealing with?”

I shook my head, my voice hollow. “I don’t know. But whatever it is, it’s not going to let us leave.”

We kept moving, but the tension was suffocating. Every rustle, every snap of a twig set our nerves on edge. The forest felt alive, malevolent, like it was watching us, waiting for the right moment to strike. And with every step, I could feel the creature getting closer, stalking us, driving us deeper into its territory.

By the time night fell, we were too exhausted to continue. Travis was barely conscious, and even I could feel the weight of exhaustion bearing down on me. We decided to set up camp one last time, hoping that somehow, we’d make it through the night.

We built the fire bigger than usual, the flames casting a protective ring of light around us. Travis was lying by the fire, his breathing shallow, his face pale and drawn. Ellie and Rachel sat beside him, keeping watch, their eyes darting nervously into the darkness.

I stood on the edge of the firelight, scanning the trees, every muscle in my body tense. I knew it was out there, watching us. I could feel its presence, lurking just beyond the reach of the flames, waiting for the moment when our defenses were down.

Then, without warning, the silence shattered.

A low, guttural growl echoed through the trees, vibrating through the ground beneath us. The sound was deep, primal, sending a shiver down my spine. I turned, my heart pounding, and saw a pair of glowing eyes staring at us from the darkness.

“It’s here,” I whispered, my voice barely audible over the crackling flames.

The others looked up, their faces pale with terror. The creature stepped into the edge of the firelight, its twisted form even more grotesque than before. Its limbs were long and skeletal, its skin stretched tight over sharp bones. And its face… its face was a nightmare, a twisted mockery of a human face, with hollow eyes and a mouth that stretched too wide, filled with jagged, gleaming teeth.

It let out a low, rumbling growl, and I felt a wave of cold wash over me. The creature was watching us, sizing us up, as if deciding which one of us to take first.

Travis let out a weak, delirious laugh, his eyes glassy with fever. “You… you’re all seeing it too, right?” he murmured, his voice slurred. “It’s not just… not just me?”

Ellie gripped his hand, her face filled with terror. “Stay with us, Travis. Just stay with us.”

But I could see the life draining from his eyes, his skin growing paler, his breaths slower. The creature took another step forward, its gaze fixed on him, almost… hungry.

“Stay back!” I shouted, grabbing a burning branch from the fire and waving it at the creature. But it didn’t flinch, didn’t even blink. Instead, it tilted its head, as if amused, and let out a low, rumbling laugh that sounded more like a growl.

Rachel clutched my arm, her voice shaking. “James, what do we do?”

I didn’t have an answer. The creature was too close, too real. I could feel the weight of its presence, the malice radiating from it like a physical force.

Then, without warning, it lunged.

It moved with inhuman speed, its twisted limbs propelling it forward in a blur. I swung the branch, but it dodged easily, its hollow eyes fixed on Travis. Ellie screamed, clutching him, but the creature reached out, its claws slicing through the air, and raked them across his chest.

Blood sprayed, and Travis let out a choked gasp, his eyes wide with pain. But in the next instant, something incredible happened.

The fire flared, as if in response to the creature’s attack. The flames roared higher, casting an intense light that drove the creature back, its twisted face contorted in anger. It let out a snarl, retreating into the shadows, its eyes blazing with fury.

For a moment, there was silence, broken only by Travis’s ragged breathing. Ellie clutched him, tears streaming down her face, and Rachel collapsed beside them, sobbing.

I stood there, gripping the branch, staring into the darkness where the creature had vanished. I knew it wasn’t gone. It was still out there, lurking in the shadows, waiting for its next opportunity.

But as I looked down at Travis, I realized that he was beyond saving. His skin was cold, his breathing shallow. Whatever the creature had done to him, it had marked him, drained him of life, leaving him a hollow shell.

Ellie looked up at me, her face streaked with tears. “We have to leave. Now.”

I nodded, feeling the weight of exhaustion bearing down on me. We gathered what little we had left, supporting Travis as best we could, and stumbled out of the campsite, into the darkness.

We didn’t stop, didn’t look back. The forest was alive with shadows, the trees closing in around us, but we pushed forward, driven by sheer terror. Travis’s breathing grew weaker with every step, and I knew he wouldn’t make it, but we couldn’t stop. The creature was still out there, trailing us, waiting for the moment we faltered.

By the time we finally broke through the trees and reached the edge of the forest, the first light of dawn was creeping over the horizon. The creature hadn’t followed us into the open. It was as if it were bound to the forest, unable to leave.

We collapsed on the edge of the road, gasping for breath, our bodies exhausted, our minds numb with terror. Travis was barely conscious, his skin pale and cold, his eyes unfocused. Ellie held him, her face wet with tears, but there was nothing we could do.

As the sun rose, I looked back at the forest, at the dark line of trees looming against the light. I could feel its presence still, lurking just beyond the edge, watching us, waiting. The creature was still out there, bound to the shadows, a nightmare that would haunt my mind forever.

And as we sat there, broken and exhausted, I realized that the forest had claimed us. We might have escaped, but a part of us would always remain, forever bound to the darkness, to the creature that had marked us as its own.

My name is James, i’m 23 and from Michigan. I went camping about 3 months ago with 3 of my closest friends: Travis, Ellie and Rachel. This was supposed to be a fun and relaxing time where we could disconnect from the world and just have fun as we used to. Let me get into the story, firstly I was picked up by Travis who already had Ellie in the truck, and Rachel was to be picked up after me.

The car ride to the forest was pretty and the company was good so the start of this trip was amazing.

Then we arrived, the forest was dense. Darker than I’d expected. As we trudged up the winding trail to our campsite, I felt like we were descending into another world, one where the sun barely reached the ground. Shadows gathered between the thick trunks, and the trees seemed to close in around us, branches reaching overhead to form a sort of canopy that blocked out the sky.

Ellie, walking ahead of me, looked back with a grin, her blonde hair catching what little light filtered through the leaves. “You okay back there, James? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

I forced a smile, gripping the straps of my pack tighter. “Just… taking it all in. This place is a lot wilder than I thought it’d be.”

She chuckled, turning back toward the trail. Travis and Rachel, further up, were talking and laughing, completely at ease. Travis, always the jokester, had brought some ridiculous straw hat and oversized hiking boots, adding to his usual over-the-top charm. Rachel, usually quiet, was actually smiling, enjoying his antics.

Maybe I was just tired, but something about this forest unsettled me. The silence was deep, almost oppressive. No birdsong, no wind rustling the branches—just the soft crunch of our footsteps and the occasional crack of a twig.

It took us about an hour to reach our campsite, a small clearing surrounded by towering pines. As soon as we dropped our gear, Travis was already busy setting up his tent, joking about his “luxury suite” with all the extras he’d packed. Ellie and Rachel were chatting, laughing as they tried to figure out their own tents. I tried to join in, but I kept feeling like someone was watching us, eyes lurking just beyond the edge of the trees.

The sun was beginning to set by the time we finished setting up. Travis built a fire, and we all gathered around it as the darkness crept in. The flames cast flickering shadows across our faces, making everything feel surreal. I didn’t want to admit it, but the shadows in this forest felt wrong, somehow too deep, too alive.

Ellie leaned in, her face illuminated by the glow. “All right, who’s got a scary story? It’s not camping without one!”

Travis immediately launched into an exaggerated tale about a monster in the woods, a story he’d probably heard as a kid. It was about an old trapper who’d gone missing years ago, only to come back as a “forest wraith,” haunting the woods and dragging people into the shadows. He added his own dramatic touches, making the creature sound hideous, with claws like knives and teeth as sharp as razors. Rachel laughed, throwing a pinecone at him.

“Oh, come on! You don’t actually expect us to be scared by that, do you?” she scoffed.

I laughed too, but it felt forced. Part of me wanted to tell them how I felt—the sense that we weren’t alone, that something was lurking just out of sight. But I didn’t want to sound paranoid, so I kept quiet, staring into the fire instead.

The forest around us grew darker as the night settled in, the trees looming like silent sentinels. Eventually, the others drifted off to their tents, their laughter fading as they zipped up and settled down for the night. I was left alone by the fire, the last of the embers casting faint, fading light.

I wanted to go to bed, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was out there, watching me. I stared into the trees, my heart pounding, every muscle tense. The silence was complete, save for the soft crackle of the dying fire.

Then, I saw it.

Just beyond the firelight, half-hidden by the trees, was a figure. At first, I thought it was one of the others, maybe Travis messing around. But as I squinted, I realized something was off. The figure was… wrong. Its limbs were too long, its posture too stiff, like it wasn’t used to moving like a human.

I froze, my breath catching in my throat. The figure didn’t move, didn’t make a sound—it just stood there, staring at me. Its eyes caught the firelight, reflecting back at me in two pinpoints of dark, glassy light.

I wanted to call out, to ask who it was, but the words died in my throat. I felt an overwhelming urge to look away, but I couldn’t. The figure seemed to be drawing me in, holding me captive with its gaze.

Then, just as quickly as it had appeared, it melted back into the shadows, disappearing into the darkness. My heart was pounding, my hands shaking. I wanted to believe I’d imagined it, that it was just a trick of the light or a shadow cast by the trees. But deep down, I knew I hadn’t.

I sat there for a long time, staring into the darkness, half-expecting the figure to reappear. But the forest remained silent, the shadows undisturbed. Finally, I forced myself to get up, to douse the fire and crawl into my tent.

Inside, I lay awake, listening to the silence, every rustle and creak setting my nerves on edge. I kept telling myself it was just my imagination, that I was letting Travis’s story get to me. But even as I closed my eyes, the image of that figure lingered, etched into my mind.

The last thing I remember before sleep finally claimed me was a feeling of eyes on me, watching from somewhere in the darkness, just beyond the thin fabric of my tent.

When I woke up, the sunlight filtering through the trees felt like a relief. The forest seemed less oppressive in the daylight, less… aware. I stepped outside my tent, blinking against the brightness, and found the others already up, sipping coffee and chatting like nothing had happened.

Ellie looked over at me, grinning. “Rough night? You look like you didn’t sleep at all.”

I forced a laugh, rubbing my eyes. “Just couldn’t get comfortable, I guess.”

I wanted to tell them about the figure, but as I looked around, it felt silly. In the daylight, the forest looked almost normal. Peaceful, even. Besides, I knew they’d just laugh it off as a shadow or a trick of my tired mind.

Travis handed me a cup of coffee, a grin on his face. “You need to relax, man. This is supposed to be a getaway, not some horror movie.”

I nodded, taking a sip of the coffee, hoping the warmth would shake off the remnants of my fear. But as I looked out into the trees, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was still out there, watching, waiting for nightfall to return.

I’d like to say that breakfast shook off the unease from last night, but the nagging feeling wouldn’t leave me. I kept glancing over my shoulder, scanning the trees as if expecting that figure to materialize in the daylight.

The others didn’t seem to notice, though. Travis was busy making everyone laugh with a ridiculous story about his last camping trip. Ellie kept glancing over at him, her laughter bright against the morning stillness, while Rachel, ever reserved, offered a quiet smile. I tried to focus on the warmth of the coffee in my hands, the crackling of the fire. But it was no use. I was still haunted by the figure, by those two pinpricks of light in the dark.

After breakfast, we decided to explore deeper into the woods, take a look at the stream Travis had spotted on the map. I was hesitant but didn’t want to be the one to kill the vibe, so I pushed down my misgivings and followed along.

The forest seemed even darker today, somehow. The trees loomed overhead like silent guards, their branches clawing at the sky. The silence felt heavy, like it was pressing down on us. I noticed that even the others were starting to seem a little quieter, their laughter and conversation fading as we walked deeper.

Eventually, we stumbled across something that made us all stop.

It was a pile of stones, stacked in a rough, haphazard cairn in the middle of the trail. The stones were smeared with a dark, sticky substance that looked… disturbingly like blood.

“What the hell is this?” Ellie whispered, her face pale.

Travis shrugged, his tone a little less cocky than usual. “Probably some kind of prank. You know, to freak out campers.”

I could tell he didn’t believe that. None of us did.

I knelt down to get a closer look, my stomach twisting. The smell coming off the stones was faint but unmistakable—metallic, like blood. I reached out to touch one of the stones, but a sudden instinct made me pull back. Something told me it would be a mistake to disturb it.

Rachel took a step back, looking around nervously. “Maybe we should head back to camp. This doesn’t feel… right.”

I nodded, relief flooding through me. But Travis shrugged, trying to shake off the tension. “Come on, guys. We’re not going to let some creepy rocks ruin our trip. Let’s just keep going.”

No one argued, but as we continued down the trail, the silence felt deeper, more ominous. I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were being watched, like something was lurking just beyond the trees, waiting for us to let our guard down.

We reached the stream, but the usual relief of finding a clear, open area didn’t come. The stream ran through a small clearing, bordered by mossy rocks and low-hanging branches. It was beautiful, I suppose, but something about the place felt… wrong. The air was damp, heavy, and it felt like the shadows under the trees were watching us.

Ellie knelt by the water, filling her bottle, and Rachel joined her. I stayed back, glancing around at the trees, unable to shake the sense that we weren’t alone. Travis noticed and nudged me with his elbow.

“Hey, you good? You’ve been jumpy all morning.”

I forced a smile, not wanting to seem paranoid. “Yeah, I’m fine. Just… something about this place, you know?”

He nodded, his expression uncharacteristically serious. “I get it, man. It’s a little weird out here. But we’re probably just spooking ourselves.”

Just as he finished speaking, Ellie let out a soft gasp. We turned to see her staring at something carved into the bark of a tree, a few feet from where she was kneeling.

It was a symbol—a strange, twisted shape that looked almost like an eye with a line slashed through it. The bark around it was dark, charred, as if someone had burned it into the tree.

“Who would do something like this out here?” Rachel whispered, a tremor in her voice.

Ellie reached out, tracing the mark with her finger. “It feels… recent.”

Something about the symbol made my skin crawl. I wanted to tell them about the figure I’d seen last night, but I wasn’t sure how. I knew it sounded crazy, and they’d probably just laugh it off or think I’d had too much to drink. So instead, I just stared at the symbol, feeling an odd sense of dread settle over me.

“Let’s go back,” I said, my voice barely a whisper. “I think we should go back.”

This time, no one argued.

We made it back to camp just as the sun was beginning to set. The whole walk back, I felt like something was trailing us, keeping just out of sight. Even Travis was quiet, his usual jokes and comments nowhere to be found.

We didn’t stop, didn’t look back. The forest was alive with shadows, the trees closing in around us, but we pushed forward, driven by sheer terror. Travis’s breathing grew weaker with every step, and I knew he wouldn’t make it, but we couldn’t stop. The creature was still out there, trailing us, waiting for the moment we faltered.

By the time we finally broke through the trees and reached the edge of the forest, the first light of dawn was creeping over the horizon. The creature hadn’t followed us into the open. It was as if it were bound to the forest, unable to leave.

We collapsed on the edge of the road, gasping for breath, our bodies exhausted, our minds numb with terror. Travis was barely conscious, his skin pale and cold, his eyes unfocused. Ellie held him, her face wet with tears, but there was nothing we could do.

As the sun rose, I looked back at the forest, at the dark line of trees looming against the light. I could feel its presence still, lurking just beyond the edge, watching us, waiting. The creature was still out there, bound to the shadows, a nightmare that would haunt my mind forever.

And as we sat there, broken and exhausted, I realized that the forest had claimed us. We might have escaped, but a part of us would always remain, forever bound to the darkness, to the creature that had marked us as its own.

This was my last story about camping, i have a bunch more different themed stories, mostly very long reads, but I'm gonna be releasing them here while i release them on my youtube channel!

Every Wednesday and sunday I'll be posting them! (until i run out in about 3 months)

Feel free to give me feedback and maybe some ideas for future stories!

1glxzw0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Better_Explanation_8/comments/1glxzw0/if_you_are_interested_in_learning_about_new/,If you are interested in learning about new products and crowdfunding than join my newsletter subreddit crumbsnewsletter,"

Here is an example of two good cover photos and titles on Indiegogo.

As you can see, the title highlights the name of the product and also explains what the product does. Sometimes, campaigns will simply have the name of the product as the title, and this is not effective. Think of the title and cover photo as your ad. For people scrolling through crowdfunding platforms, this is going to be what determines if they click on your campaign or not. Also, people always complain about the lack of organic traffic on crowdfunding platforms, well this is the best way to solve it. Convince people who are on the platform that you have the coolest product there. For the pillow campaign, they didn't say something vague or simple like “comfiest pillow ever” or “super soft pillow”, they actually highlighted the unique value that it brings to customers and shows that there is a lot more to this pillow than what meets the eye. Including that it is doctor developed shows that they took a scientific and data driven approach when determining the features and materials of this pillow, really building unique value for customers. The coffee Grinista does a good job of explaining what the product does and what it is you will actually get out of your product. This is important because the name of the product “Grinista” is seemingly meaningless without the description that follows. Remember that when naming your product and creating your title, your funny or clever name is not going to help you get sales if people have no idea what your product does. This campaign clearly states what you are getting from the product and how you can use it in your daily life. It is appealing to people who make their own coffee and understand that struggle of having to buy a coffee grinder with a separate scale. 

https://preview.redd.it/ztgub2lg0jzd1.png?width=1392&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3d9348d544bb81e08a64eb2fb2aa158a4082a73

Now for the cover photo. Both campaigns do alot more than simply showing the product. The coffee grinder goes into further detail about the dimensions and functionality of the product. Their target audience is likely people who are well versed in the coffee and coffee gadget space, therefore these words have a meaning for them. However, to the average person whos not that interested in coffee, things liker “flat burr” and “Auto Fines Knocking” have very little meaning. Therefore, they are eliminating a large potential audience by including this industry specific language. That is okay because they clearly built this product for a certain level of coffee enthusiast and want to ensure that those people love their product, not that it appeals to the everyday person. This is also good because it segments the market that they are trying to sell in. Oftentimes, it is too hard to create a product everyone will like, make one that 100 people will love and you have a winner. 

The pillows cover photo is also well put together because it highlights how the pillow helps people sleep. At the end of the day, that is the importance part. They could include the materials and the different studies they did to make the best pillow, but no one really understands that or cares. If they said the pillow is 80% cotton or whatever, the user doesn't know the difference, they likely don't even know what the pillow they use now is made out of. Instead, they highlight how this is a full body pillow and comes with components to help your whole body sleep. This is very unique and not many pillows focus on your legs, hips and arms. Typically, a pillow is for your head and thats it. Since this campaign is offering a unique product, it is important they focused on that difference as opposed to anything else. They have communicated the uniqueness of the product and that may be enough to get some organic clicks on their page. Also, including a user testimonial is a great strategy, especially in crowdfunding. People need to see that you are serious and that other people like your campaign, not just you. So often, campaigners think they came up with a good idea and are confused why no one else likes it. People on crowdfunding platforms are very moved by social proof. They like to see that other people bought the campaign already or that a friend of theirs is also supporting the campaign. The pillow campaign executed the user testimonial very well. 

User generated content is a very popular advertising strategy today both in e commerce and crowdfunding. It is very easy to show a video of a picture of one of your friends or customers enjoying your product. Social media has really increased the popularity of user generated content, so including that in your campaign as a way to build social proof is a good strategy. If you cant get a picture or video, do a testimonial like the pillow campaign did. People do actually read and respond to reviews the see of a product, so highlight your good ones.",1,1731005681.0,u_Better_Explanation_8,0,1.0,False

Diagnosed at 28 weeks with the first month diet controlled then I went on 10 units of nightly insulin. Went in for my routine midwives appointment yesterday morning and had two high blood pressure readings. Was told to go home and retake it and self-monitor. Called in my home readings and was told to immediately head to labor & delivery. Thankfully, I had time to paint my nails before I called in 😅. Went into triage where I had one high BP reading but all the rest were normal. Was still told I'd have the C Section in 8 hours since I had eaten that day. Since I wasn't an emergency, this kept getting pushed back to accommodate moms more in need. So instead of 9:30 pm my second son was born by my second C Section at 7:00 am this morning. All is well, our sugars are fine. I was 37w and 4days so he's a bit early but weighing in at 6.5 lbs and he cried immediately after getting pulled out, which was a relief.

1glxwg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_EerieChronicles/comments/1glxwg0/i_went_camping_with_my_friends_but_something_was/,"I Went Camping With My Friends, But Something Was Watching Us...","[Narrated Story](https://youtu.be/CciTcNb44Q0?si=7p9nmJ9cD0rnujWN&t=1235)

My name is James, i’m 23 and from Michigan. I went camping about 3 months ago with 3 of my closest friends: Travis, Ellie and Rachel. This was supposed to be a fun and relaxing time where we could disconnect from the world and just have fun as we used to. Let me get into the story, firstly I was picked up by Travis who already had Ellie in the truck, and Rachel was to be picked up after me.

The car ride to the forest was pretty and the company was good so the start of this trip was amazing.

Then we arrived, the forest was dense. Darker than I’d expected. As we trudged up the winding trail to our campsite, I felt like we were descending into another world, one where the sun barely reached the ground. Shadows gathered between the thick trunks, and the trees seemed to close in around us, branches reaching overhead to form a sort of canopy that blocked out the sky.

Ellie, walking ahead of me, looked back with a grin, her blonde hair catching what little light filtered through the leaves. “You okay back there, James? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

I forced a smile, gripping the straps of my pack tighter. “Just… taking it all in. This place is a lot wilder than I thought it’d be.”

She chuckled, turning back toward the trail. Travis and Rachel, further up, were talking and laughing, completely at ease. Travis, always the jokester, had brought some ridiculous straw hat and oversized hiking boots, adding to his usual over-the-top charm. Rachel, usually quiet, was actually smiling, enjoying his antics.

Maybe I was just tired, but something about this forest unsettled me. The silence was deep, almost oppressive. No birdsong, no wind rustling the branches—just the soft crunch of our footsteps and the occasional crack of a twig.

It took us about an hour to reach our campsite, a small clearing surrounded by towering pines. As soon as we dropped our gear, Travis was already busy setting up his tent, joking about his “luxury suite” with all the extras he’d packed. Ellie and Rachel were chatting, laughing as they tried to figure out their own tents. I tried to join in, but I kept feeling like someone was watching us, eyes lurking just beyond the edge of the trees.

The sun was beginning to set by the time we finished setting up. Travis built a fire, and we all gathered around it as the darkness crept in. The flames cast flickering shadows across our faces, making everything feel surreal. I didn’t want to admit it, but the shadows in this forest felt wrong, somehow too deep, too alive.

Ellie leaned in, her face illuminated by the glow. “All right, who’s got a scary story? It’s not camping without one!”

Travis immediately launched into an exaggerated tale about a monster in the woods, a story he’d probably heard as a kid. It was about an old trapper who’d gone missing years ago, only to come back as a “forest wraith,” haunting the woods and dragging people into the shadows. He added his own dramatic touches, making the creature sound hideous, with claws like knives and teeth as sharp as razors. Rachel laughed, throwing a pinecone at him.

“Oh, come on! You don’t actually expect us to be scared by that, do you?” she scoffed.

I laughed too, but it felt forced. Part of me wanted to tell them how I felt—the sense that we weren’t alone, that something was lurking just out of sight. But I didn’t want to sound paranoid, so I kept quiet, staring into the fire instead.

The forest around us grew darker as the night settled in, the trees looming like silent sentinels. Eventually, the others drifted off to their tents, their laughter fading as they zipped up and settled down for the night. I was left alone by the fire, the last of the embers casting faint, fading light.

I wanted to go to bed, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was out there, watching me. I stared into the trees, my heart pounding, every muscle tense. The silence was complete, save for the soft crackle of the dying fire.

Then, I saw it.

Just beyond the firelight, half-hidden by the trees, was a figure. At first, I thought it was one of the others, maybe Travis messing around. But as I squinted, I realized something was off. The figure was… wrong. Its limbs were too long, its posture too stiff, like it wasn’t used to moving like a human.

I froze, my breath catching in my throat. The figure didn’t move, didn’t make a sound—it just stood there, staring at me. Its eyes caught the firelight, reflecting back at me in two pinpoints of dark, glassy light.

I wanted to call out, to ask who it was, but the words died in my throat. I felt an overwhelming urge to look away, but I couldn’t. The figure seemed to be drawing me in, holding me captive with its gaze.

Then, just as quickly as it had appeared, it melted back into the shadows, disappearing into the darkness. My heart was pounding, my hands shaking. I wanted to believe I’d imagined it, that it was just a trick of the light or a shadow cast by the trees. But deep down, I knew I hadn’t.

I sat there for a long time, staring into the darkness, half-expecting the figure to reappear. But the forest remained silent, the shadows undisturbed. Finally, I forced myself to get up, to douse the fire and crawl into my tent.

Inside, I lay awake, listening to the silence, every rustle and creak setting my nerves on edge. I kept telling myself it was just my imagination, that I was letting Travis’s story get to me. But even as I closed my eyes, the image of that figure lingered, etched into my mind.

The last thing I remember before sleep finally claimed me was a feeling of eyes on me, watching from somewhere in the darkness, just beyond the thin fabric of my tent.

When I woke up, the sunlight filtering through the trees felt like a relief. The forest seemed less oppressive in the daylight, less… aware. I stepped outside my tent, blinking against the brightness, and found the others already up, sipping coffee and chatting like nothing had happened.

Ellie looked over at me, grinning. “Rough night? You look like you didn’t sleep at all.”

I forced a laugh, rubbing my eyes. “Just couldn’t get comfortable, I guess.”

I wanted to tell them about the figure, but as I looked around, it felt silly. In the daylight, the forest looked almost normal. Peaceful, even. Besides, I knew they’d just laugh it off as a shadow or a trick of my tired mind.

Travis handed me a cup of coffee, a grin on his face. “You need to relax, man. This is supposed to be a getaway, not some horror movie.”

I nodded, taking a sip of the coffee, hoping the warmth would shake off the remnants of my fear. But as I looked out into the trees, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was still out there, watching, waiting for nightfall to return.

I’d like to say that breakfast shook off the unease from last night, but the nagging feeling wouldn’t leave me. I kept glancing over my shoulder, scanning the trees as if expecting that figure to materialize in the daylight.

The others didn’t seem to notice, though. Travis was busy making everyone laugh with a ridiculous story about his last camping trip. Ellie kept glancing over at him, her laughter bright against the morning stillness, while Rachel, ever reserved, offered a quiet smile. I tried to focus on the warmth of the coffee in my hands, the crackling of the fire. But it was no use. I was still haunted by the figure, by those two pinpricks of light in the dark.

After breakfast, we decided to explore deeper into the woods, take a look at the stream Travis had spotted on the map. I was hesitant but didn’t want to be the one to kill the vibe, so I pushed down my misgivings and followed along.

The forest seemed even darker today, somehow. The trees loomed overhead like silent guards, their branches clawing at the sky. The silence felt heavy, like it was pressing down on us. I noticed that even the others were starting to seem a little quieter, their laughter and conversation fading as we walked deeper.

Eventually, we stumbled across something that made us all stop.

It was a pile of stones, stacked in a rough, haphazard cairn in the middle of the trail. The stones were smeared with a dark, sticky substance that looked… disturbingly like blood.

“What the hell is this?” Ellie whispered, her face pale.

Travis shrugged, his tone a little less cocky than usual. “Probably some kind of prank. You know, to freak out campers.”

I could tell he didn’t believe that. None of us did.

I knelt down to get a closer look, my stomach twisting. The smell coming off the stones was faint but unmistakable—metallic, like blood. I reached out to touch one of the stones, but a sudden instinct made me pull back. Something told me it would be a mistake to disturb it.

Rachel took a step back, looking around nervously. “Maybe we should head back to camp. This doesn’t feel… right.”

I nodded, relief flooding through me. But Travis shrugged, trying to shake off the tension. “Come on, guys. We’re not going to let some creepy rocks ruin our trip. Let’s just keep going.”

No one argued, but as we continued down the trail, the silence felt deeper, more ominous. I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were being watched, like something was lurking just beyond the trees, waiting for us to let our guard down.

We reached the stream, but the usual relief of finding a clear, open area didn’t come. The stream ran through a small clearing, bordered by mossy rocks and low-hanging branches. It was beautiful, I suppose, but something about the place felt… wrong. The air was damp, heavy, and it felt like the shadows under the trees were watching us.

Ellie knelt by the water, filling her bottle, and Rachel joined her. I stayed back, glancing around at the trees, unable to shake the sense that we weren’t alone. Travis noticed and nudged me with his elbow.

“Hey, you good? You’ve been jumpy all morning.”

I forced a smile, not wanting to seem paranoid. “Yeah, I’m fine. Just… something about this place, you know?”

He nodded, his expression uncharacteristically serious. “I get it, man. It’s a little weird out here. But we’re probably just spooking ourselves.”

Just as he finished speaking, Ellie let out a soft gasp. We turned to see her staring at something carved into the bark of a tree, a few feet from where she was kneeling.

It was a symbol—a strange, twisted shape that looked almost like an eye with a line slashed through it. The bark around it was dark, charred, as if someone had burned it into the tree.

“Who would do something like this out here?” Rachel whispered, a tremor in her voice.

Ellie reached out, tracing the mark with her finger. “It feels… recent.”

Something about the symbol made my skin crawl. I wanted to tell them about the figure I’d seen last night, but I wasn’t sure how. I knew it sounded crazy, and they’d probably just laugh it off or think I’d had too much to drink. So instead, I just stared at the symbol, feeling an odd sense of dread settle over me.

“Let’s go back,” I said, my voice barely a whisper. “I think we should go back.”

This time, no one argued.

We made it back to camp just as the sun was beginning to set. The whole walk back, I felt like something was trailing us, keeping just out of sight. Even Travis was quiet, his usual jokes and comments nowhere to be found.

We sat around the fire that night, but the atmosphere was tense. No one wanted to bring up what we’d seen, but it was hanging there between us, an unspoken weight pressing down on us.

Ellie broke the silence, her voice barely audible over the crackling flames. “Do you guys… do you feel like we’re being watched?”

I looked at her, surprised that she’d voiced exactly what I’d been thinking.

Rachel nodded, her eyes darting toward the trees. “I haven’t felt right since we saw that pile of rocks. It feels like… like something’s out there.”

Travis scoffed, but I could tell he was rattled too. “Come on, guys. It’s just a creepy forest. We’re probably just letting it get to us.”

But even as he spoke, his eyes kept drifting to the shadows, his hands twitching nervously.

The fire crackled, casting dancing shadows across the trees. I was staring into the flames, trying to calm myself, when I heard it—a low, guttural growl coming from somewhere beyond the firelight.

I froze, my heart pounding. The others heard it too; I could see their faces go pale, their eyes wide with fear.

“What… was that?” Ellie whispered, her voice shaking.

We sat in silence, straining to hear. The growling came again, closer this time, a deep, primal sound that sent a shiver down my spine.

Then, before we could react, something lunged into the edge of the firelight.

It was the figure from last night, but now I could see it more clearly. Its limbs were twisted and unnatural, its eyes hollow and unblinking. Its skin was a sickly, mottled gray, stretched tight over sharp bones. And its mouth… its mouth was open, revealing a set of jagged teeth that gleamed in the firelight.

Travis let out a strangled scream, grabbing a branch from the fire and brandishing it at the creature. But it didn’t back away. Instead, it took a step closer, its eyes locked onto us, unblinking.

In the next instant, it lunged, swiping at Travis with one of its long, bony hands. He stumbled back, clutching his arm, blood seeping through his fingers.

“Get back!” I shouted, grabbing a burning log from the fire and swinging it at the creature. The flames seemed to startle it, and it retreated, melting back into the shadows.

We sat there, panting, our hearts racing. Travis was pale, clutching his bleeding arm, his face twisted with pain and fear.

Ellie knelt beside him, trying to stem the bleeding with a piece of cloth. “Oh my God… what was that?”

I didn’t have an answer. All I knew was that the thing I’d seen last night was real, and it wasn’t just watching us anymore. It was hunting us.

We sat in silence, too afraid to speak, too afraid to move. The fire crackled, casting flickering shadows that seemed to dance and twist, mocking us. The forest around us was silent again, but I knew the creature was still out there, lurking just beyond the light, waiting for its next chance.

As I glanced at Travis’s wound, a horrible thought crept into my mind: whatever that creature was, it had marked him. And I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were all next.

I barely slept after the attack. Travis’s wound throbbed and bled well into the night, and though Ellie tried to keep it clean, it only seemed to worsen. I could hear him muttering in his sleep, his voice feverish, like he was caught in a nightmare he couldn’t escape.

When dawn finally broke, it felt like a reprieve, a fragile shield against whatever stalked us in the darkness. But even the daylight seemed weaker, as if the forest itself was rejecting the sun. Shadows stretched long and dark between the trees, and the usual chirping of birds and rustling of animals was eerily absent.

Ellie, Rachel, and I gathered around Travis, checking on him as he drifted in and out of sleep. The cut on his arm looked… wrong. The skin around it was swollen, angry red, as if it were infected, but something about it seemed unnatural, almost as though it were spreading under the skin.

Ellie’s face was pale, her eyes wide with fear. “We need to get him out of here,” she said, her voice trembling. “This isn’t just an infection. There’s something… wrong with him.”

I nodded, but a sick feeling settled in my stomach. I knew, deep down, that leaving wouldn’t be as easy as just packing up and hiking out. I could feel it, pressing in from all sides—the forest didn’t want us to leave. It was like we’d stumbled into something ancient, something that didn’t take kindly to intruders.

But we had to try. We packed up as quickly as we could, supporting Travis as we made our way down the trail. Every step felt like a struggle, like the trees were closing in around us, trying to trap us. Travis was barely conscious, his skin cold and clammy. His breathing was shallow, his eyes glassy.

By midday, we reached the pile of stones from yesterday. But something was different. The stones were scattered, lying haphazardly on the ground. And in the center of the disturbed pile was something that made my blood run cold—a single, bloody claw mark, scratched into the dirt.

Rachel gasped, her hand flying to her mouth. “It’s… it’s following us.”

Ellie gripped my arm, her face as pale as I’d ever seen it. “James… what is this? What are we dealing with?”

I shook my head, my voice hollow. “I don’t know. But whatever it is, it’s not going to let us leave.”

We kept moving, but the tension was suffocating. Every rustle, every snap of a twig set our nerves on edge. The forest felt alive, malevolent, like it was watching us, waiting for the right moment to strike. And with every step, I could feel the creature getting closer, stalking us, driving us deeper into its territory.

By the time night fell, we were too exhausted to continue. Travis was barely conscious, and even I could feel the weight of exhaustion bearing down on me. We decided to set up camp one last time, hoping that somehow, we’d make it through the night.

We built the fire bigger than usual, the flames casting a protective ring of light around us. Travis was lying by the fire, his breathing shallow, his face pale and drawn. Ellie and Rachel sat beside him, keeping watch, their eyes darting nervously into the darkness.

I stood on the edge of the firelight, scanning the trees, every muscle in my body tense. I knew it was out there, watching us. I could feel its presence, lurking just beyond the reach of the flames, waiting for the moment when our defenses were down.

Then, without warning, the silence shattered.

A low, guttural growl echoed through the trees, vibrating through the ground beneath us. The sound was deep, primal, sending a shiver down my spine. I turned, my heart pounding, and saw a pair of glowing eyes staring at us from the darkness.

“It’s here,” I whispered, my voice barely audible over the crackling flames.

The others looked up, their faces pale with terror. The creature stepped into the edge of the firelight, its twisted form even more grotesque than before. Its limbs were long and skeletal, its skin stretched tight over sharp bones. And its face… its face was a nightmare, a twisted mockery of a human face, with hollow eyes and a mouth that stretched too wide, filled with jagged, gleaming teeth.

It let out a low, rumbling growl, and I felt a wave of cold wash over me. The creature was watching us, sizing us up, as if deciding which one of us to take first.

Travis let out a weak, delirious laugh, his eyes glassy with fever. “You… you’re all seeing it too, right?” he murmured, his voice slurred. “It’s not just… not just me?”

Ellie gripped his hand, her face filled with terror. “Stay with us, Travis. Just stay with us.”

But I could see the life draining from his eyes, his skin growing paler, his breaths slower. The creature took another step forward, its gaze fixed on him, almost… hungry.

“Stay back!” I shouted, grabbing a burning branch from the fire and waving it at the creature. But it didn’t flinch, didn’t even blink. Instead, it tilted its head, as if amused, and let out a low, rumbling laugh that sounded more like a growl.

Rachel clutched my arm, her voice shaking. “James, what do we do?”

I didn’t have an answer. The creature was too close, too real. I could feel the weight of its presence, the malice radiating from it like a physical force.

Then, without warning, it lunged.

It moved with inhuman speed, its twisted limbs propelling it forward in a blur. I swung the branch, but it dodged easily, its hollow eyes fixed on Travis. Ellie screamed, clutching him, but the creature reached out, its claws slicing through the air, and raked them across his chest.

Blood sprayed, and Travis let out a choked gasp, his eyes wide with pain. But in the next instant, something incredible happened.

The fire flared, as if in response to the creature’s attack. The flames roared higher, casting an intense light that drove the creature back, its twisted face contorted in anger. It let out a snarl, retreating into the shadows, its eyes blazing with fury.

For a moment, there was silence, broken only by Travis’s ragged breathing. Ellie clutched him, tears streaming down her face, and Rachel collapsed beside them, sobbing.

I stood there, gripping the branch, staring into the darkness where the creature had vanished. I knew it wasn’t gone. It was still out there, lurking in the shadows, waiting for its next opportunity.

But as I looked down at Travis, I realized that he was beyond saving. His skin was cold, his breathing shallow. Whatever the creature had done to him, it had marked him, drained him of life, leaving him a hollow shell.

Ellie looked up at me, her face streaked with tears. “We have to leave. Now.”

I nodded, feeling the weight of exhaustion bearing down on me. We gathered what little we had left, supporting Travis as best we could, and stumbled out of the campsite, into the darkness.

We didn’t stop, didn’t look back. The forest was alive with shadows, the trees closing in around us, but we pushed forward, driven by sheer terror. Travis’s breathing grew weaker with every step, and I knew he wouldn’t make it, but we couldn’t stop. The creature was still out there, trailing us, waiting for the moment we faltered.

By the time we finally broke through the trees and reached the edge of the forest, the first light of dawn was creeping over the horizon. The creature hadn’t followed us into the open. It was as if it were bound to the forest, unable to leave.

We collapsed on the edge of the road, gasping for breath, our bodies exhausted, our minds numb with terror. Travis was barely conscious, his skin pale and cold, his eyes unfocused. Ellie held him, her face wet with tears, but there was nothing we could do.

As the sun rose, I looked back at the forest, at the dark line of trees looming against the light. I could feel its presence still, lurking just beyond the edge, watching us, waiting. The creature was still out there, bound to the shadows, a nightmare that would haunt my mind forever.

And as we sat there, broken and exhausted, I realized that the forest had claimed us. We might have escaped, but a part of us would always remain, forever bound to the darkness, to the creature that had marked us as its own.

2021 to 2023: ??????? (Need information)

2023 to today

The year 2023 started with the claim that the game was out, indeed people were claiming that the game was out because after all that's what Team Cherry had said, but the game was pushed back... While people were pretending that it was coming out for the first time, and not the last, they were all fixated on a fishing mini-game that included specific abilities such as the Zotefish which granted invincibility. In addition to the fishing mini-game, there was the appearance of an obsession on Quishma, a main character, encountered in a place known as the ""Nest of the Void"", located behind the silk tunnel, considered the most difficult place in terms of enemies... the curse of Silksanity was only getting worse. Then there was the Bait, the first one, in whom today no one believes anymore which clearly worsened the trust in this already quite unstable community. After that, the excessive simplifications began and... the -| was invented from scratch, but the rival Glyph was created, the -Y. It is still a debate in this community today, the proof being that during the elections a candidate (exceptional) would have had a question based on ""of -| or -Y?"". All this gave rise to the great Sigil War. Many sigils were created as well as destroyed. The most notable of these were the -X, the -K and the -r. After the victory of -Y, a cult formed around it but soon after, the Woopers invaded the subreddit. In panic the subreddit had to create a resistance in order to counter the invasion. After many fights the Woopers, today, have almost all disappeared and the cult of Jim's ass was founded, a cult to say the least... strange.... During this period there were 3 major cults: the cult of the woopers invasion, the cult of -Y, and the cult of Jim's ass. And it was after these wars that the subreddit was able to rest a little, then came the sacrifices. Some, for reasons of unreleased game and also madness caused by the curse of Silksanity, had proposed to sacrifice this sub as an offering to Team Cherry, most of them agreed, but not the moderators... And the moderators created a game, with the 3 big cults in Hollow Knight, which according to some would be the worst game of all time. Came the Skong and the Skilk, without forgetting the Gnoong. Again and again in this sub reddit, they fought. And there, after this umpteenth battle, a new era came, the era of coffee began. The story would be that Ari Gibson would have shot someone in a coffee shop and a wave of shitposts on Ari Gibson came. The curse became more and more powerful and stronger with each moment spent on this sub-reddit and the proof is that from that moment on people tried to find Hornet everywhere. They still continue by the way. Some even make a post a day where they try to find Hornet in objects with no apparent connection, at least for those who were not affected by the curse... And then the SatinPolar arc was. During this arc SatinPolar was sealed by 3 ships because Silksong was not announced during an event. Even today, like the Hollow Knight, u/SatinPolar is sealed. Finally, for an unknown reason, there was the silkelection. People ran and tried to become THE president of r/Silksong. But then after people went so far as to destroy a country for these elections, the organizer rigged the votes in order to be elected. He established a very short dictatorship but he still had time to execute a political opponent. But r/Silksong got rid of this dictatorship, now having no leader. For the moment the last event was Silkvember. Like the year 2023, r/Silksong acted as if the game had been released. In addition, a new obsession said its appearance, that of a cat video game...

Is decaf actually okay? I can't do matcha because  I have the slow COMT gene & L-theanine slows it down more & makes anxiety worse too.

Hey everyone!

I’m a 26-year-old guy living in the UK (5’5, if that matters!), and I’m thinking of taking a short trip somewhere in Europe soon, probably for about 3-4 days. Denmark is at the top of my list right now, but I’m open to other countries too if there’s something cool to see:)

A little bit about me: I’m into photography, so I’ll probably be snapping photos everywhere we go. I’m a big gamer too, I built my own custom PC, but I also play on console. When I’m not gaming, I love exploring new places, and going for drives (especially night drives with some chill music, there’s just something magical about it). I’m also a cinema lover, so if there’s a cool movie showing, I’d definitely be up for that too.

I’ll admit, I’m kind of a private person and really enjoy my alone time. But I thought it might be nice to mix things up and explore with someone for a change! If you’re up for some casual, laid-back travel vibes, whether it’s grabbing coffee, checking out local spots, or chatting about games and movies, would love to hear from you

 My partner had previously had this habit of giving the dog human food pretty often and licking of breakfast plates and asked me to do the same. I hate this honestly. I did for a bit until my partner figured out the dog got sick from licking breakfast plates eating something he was allergic to. This dog has always begged for food when we eat but lately it's been so bad since we stopped giving him human food. He's licking the floor, licking the bowl, moving the bowl to lick more of the floor and even moved the rug. He's started getting to a point I pulled a sandwich out and he put his head on my shoulder and I said bed and he went to bed and begged from there. He tried to jump on the counter. He got in the garden and ate from the compost and was vomit sick for 3 days with diarrhea as well. My partner decided to just give him extra to try to give him comfort. He usually gets 1 scoop am and 1 scoop pm because his body size and vet recommendations. He has a food bowl that helps him slow down but he doesn't chew anymore now. Today he ate 4 scoops and choked on the food as part of the new plan my partner implemented.  He still licked his bowl and begged for food when I made coffee. I let him smell the cup and he backed away in disgust as that's what I personally have been doing, letting him smell non-food things which has helped some. When I made lunch today, he almost snatched it out of my hands when I sat down. He proceeded to pull back when he didn't get any food and sat next to me in a chair and placed his paws on me begging, again sent to his bed. He flipped his water bowl looking for more food. So we are hiding the bowl which changes nothing. I'm at my own wits end and unsure how to navigate this newer behavior. Is there any advice I can suggest to my partner to try to implement into daily habits that may help? Thank you.

Wait none of you missed me. Bugger. Well I'm still feeling good. So let's dunk on my sanity and look back to a time when my life was a never-ending drain on my existence I felt. Today we're going to talk about Kevin. Kevin was a person I actually knew from college but he and I never saw 100% eye to eye. He isn't a particularly bad person he just felt he always had to be right even when he was wrong. He was often wrong and in efforts to prove he was right he often caused a problem. It's half the reason my mother thought I should go back to academics and become an engineer. You see Marty knew that I had a brain of some kind and he was a cheap bastard. Why pay an engineer whose trained to fix things when I could just impromptu learn how to do it? Well this is a tale of how I managed to both learn to fix two different machines and get myself run over inside a Burger King.

So let's start with a description of Kevin. He was a slightly pudgy chap with glasses and easily was 6ft 2. He was an overconfident person which isn't terrible as a trait but sometimes you need to learn when you are in over your depth. Again he wasn't a terrible person he was just a pain in the ass to deal with. If he was in the wrong he had to find a way to be right. Thank God he wasn't a manager. Nope he was a regular grunt on my front counter team and he wasn't too bad at the customer service, admittedly I occasionally did leave the front counter to him so I could fart around in the kitchen with someone. Generally when it was school rush. God I hate teenagers they're all assholes of some kind I think. 

So how did I begin my impromptu education in engineering in a fast food joint. Well Kevin was determined to push a coffee machine to it's absolute limits and the machine broke down. You see coffee machines in fast food places can only produce so much hot water at a time before they exhaust themselves. I told him to ""leave it for a couple of minutes so it can cooldown,"" as a responsible person would. He said ""I got this,"" before puling out the cable connection for the plug and putting it back in. Mainly because he couldn't reach the plug but he could reach the cable. Then after a moment the machine came back to life. Still overheating but being tricked into working. This cut a whole minute of waiting out. Well had he waited that minute he wouldn't have fried out some sensor or another causing the thing to begin to smoke like it just picked up a 20 pack of Menthols on the way home. I immediately let Marty know who instead of picking up the phone for an engineer asks me, ""you can fix it right Lucky?""

Me: Why would I know how to fix a coffee machine?

Marty: Well you're a smart guy Lucky. 

Me: I know I'm a smart guy but I have a feeling I'll need tools, parts and some kind of knowledge on how it works. I have none of these things. 

Marty: We got tools in the back and the users manual. It's got pictures in it. Should help.

Me: Why not just get the trained technician in? 

Marty: Because they won't get here for three days. You are here now and I'm pretty sure you can do it. 

Me: And if I can't you'll lose any chance of getting that engineer out for cheap.

You might be wondering why the hell Marty would take the risk. Well he did know that I do my own repairs on my motorcycle after once catching me changing my front brakes at work whilst on my lunch break. So he knew I had something that resembled a brain but seriously the real reason was an insane gamble. You see every area manager has a set budget to spend on certain things such as maintenance, staff expenses and restaurant updates. Well what he doesn't spend goes into his bonus. You cheap asshole Marty you never cut me in. It was lucky for him it was 1pm and not 5pm. Mainly because after popping the top I could see the issue and it was essentially some wires had been melted by the heat. So I sent Marty on a mission to find me some basic wires and a soldering kit. I won't lie when I say I had no idea if it would work but it held. My bullshit patchwork job somehow worked. To this day I have no idea how it did work but it did. It's probably the same way in which some handymen fix entire households with nothing but a hammer and duct tape. 

Next lets turn to how I fixed the Ice Cream/Milkshake machine. Not only fixed it but actually made it better. You see these machines have a tendency to break down. Seriously if you ever go to a fast food joint and the machine that makes all the goodies breaks down it's likely a small default that the manufacturer never bothers to fix. They don't bother to fix it most likely because they get £2k a call out and the temporary fix that the company engineers do which takes 30 minutes. So what was the solution to this problem in Marty's eyes? Well it wasn't to see if he could figure it out himself. Nope it was wait for it to break down again and get me to figure it out. And naturally Kevin broke it. This was mainly due to incompetence. The three nights in a row I had taken off to basically do whatever I wanted to do and what does he do, he forgot the sequence to shut the machine down. Such a sequence is simple drain the machine to the minimum level and put it on a heat cycle. Well if you forget it for one night you will likely get away with it. If you forget it for two nights so long as on one of them the morning staff do it before the place opens it can. If you forget it for three days though you will definitely bust it because whether people can do a basic version of this shut down cycle in the morning or not. The reason that this is important is because the heat cycle stops it from either freezing over and clogging up the dispensing chamber. Normally it will naturally clog every 3 months to the point that hot water in the morning is not going to help. Well before I could do anything Kevin insisted that he help out despite my insistence that he not. Mainly because I was in on my day off he was on shift. But also because I already was in out of my depth and was going to have to spend all day on it because he'd broken the machine from incompetence or laziness. Odds are Kevin thought him helping me would put him in Marty's good books. So I decided to get to work pulling the machine apart, cleaning the parts and putting them on a table in the kitchen. Well all that was left was the big clunky machine shell. Even with all the parts removed it weighs about 300kg. But with the wheels on it a strong lean is enough to get it moving. Also to note the front of the machine which stops the mix from flying out was still not on. I go to Marty ""okay that's everything cleaned let me take a look to see if anything is broken or was just clogged.""

Kevin (whilst going into the fridge): Oh nice job Lucky. Wanna do a test?

Me: Not right now.

Kevin then came out of the fridge with Milkshake mix already uncapped pouring it into the machine without any prompting. I got covered in Milkshake mix from the unplugged machine. What didn't go on me went on the floor making the worst mess ever. 

Me (pissed): For fuck sake Kevin. Didn't I just say don't fill the machine.

Kevin: Lucky language. There's a customer there.

I turned to see a dude there just looking on in shock whilst trying not to laugh. I might have been giving an audible ""grrr""

Customer (to Kevin): He did say don't fill it. You didn't listen mate.

Kevin: Are you okay overall Lucky? 

Me: Yeah I'm fine. Get a mop to clean it up.

Marty (coming out the office): What the bloody hell are you doing out here? 

Me: Just a miscommunication leading to a mess. Don't worry Kevin will clean it up.

Kevin: Let me see where the mess is. 

Me (panicked): Wait, wait, wait.

Too late he ran over my foot. 

Marty: Kevin in the office now.

Me: But first get this bloody thing off my foot.

It took Kevin and Marty working together pulling it off my foot as it's easy to push but a pain in the ass to pull. I was trying to shoulder it but my foot being pinned by it was the reason my fat ass couldn't get any momentum in the push. My current workplace shoes at the time I was using were not steel toe capped so my foot was in agony. I checked my foot myself and despite that big clunky thing being on my foot it wasn't broken. It just hurt like a son of a bitch. To this day I am convinced I am part robot because I have many accidents under my belt including 3 motorcycle accidents and I've only ever broken my pinky toe. But I am yet to set off a metal detector so maybe I'm just a lucky bastard; well Lucky Devil at least. My dad always said that with my luck I could land into a pile of shit and come out smelling of roses. Well I didn't have a broken foot just a throbbing one. Well while Marty was busy giving Kevin an ass chewing so long that pretty sure he chewed through the whole ass and started on the torso. It was so loud that it could be heard throughout the kitchen, the front counter and a little bit of the dining area. Kevin was sent out of the office looking absolutely defeated before going over to me and giving a quiet ""I'm sorry for all the trouble."" I told him it's okay while looking at Marty going ""not cool dude."" I might have been pissed at Kevin for basically everything but I never would condone humiliating a person like that. It was basically a public castration of the poor bastard. In the end I actually took Kevin and Marty into the dry store for a chat.

Me: Marty whilst I appreciate the fact that you are trying to get the health and safety aspect of things into his head and the whole listen to what you're told thing into his head he did not deserve to be treated like that. I am gonna walk funny for a bit and I am fine.

Kevin: I really am sorry.

Me: And that's what matters to me. Marty I would like you to go out and publicly apologise for the way you spoke to Kevin. It is a good way to not dent moral and make it up to Kevin.

Marty: Seriously. He did run over your foot and waste an entire box of Milkshake mix.

Me: Seriously. It's to show that even when we mess up and cross a line you are not going to cross another one. It will show that you have respect for the staff and acknowledge you crossed a line as a manager. 

Kevin: Wait why's he teaching you how to talk to staff?

Marty: He's not. He's trying to give me a staff level perspective. 

Me: Right I need to get cleaned up and put the machine back together, you have shifts to finish, I'll come back later to finish up.

Marty: Wait there's more to do?

Me: Yeah. It'll run in the meantime but I can switch out a couple of wires and the machine is less likely to break down. The company put in the wrong wiring for the machine. It's not properly insulated. Probably why it keeps breaking down.

Marty: Are you serious? That is preventable. 

Me: Possibly. I'll get the wiring and we'll sort it out from there. I can do it when they close after the machines been emptied for the night. 

Marty just grunted in agreement before wandering back into the kitchen with Kevin and apologising to him. I got a fresh pair of work trousers from the uniform store so I could ride my motorcycle back to get a fresh shirt. Mainly because if I put a work shirt on I'd be asked to deal with people. And after all that yeah fuck that shit. I did come back and finish up the maintenance on the machine. I finished it up by actually changing the wiring from the original one. Which insanely despite my haphazard style actually lessoned the amount of times we needed to get out the actual technicians. Honestly it's like I was using Ork Waagh energy to make it work as like Waagh energy and Ork contraptions this too probably would have been a disaster in anyone else's hands. I probably am insane enough to make that happen. 

In the aftermath it's not very eventful although Marty did casually get me to fix the problem in all his stores. To this day as far as I am aware those machines are still working without fault. A full 7 years. They might have been buggered up in between but I never heard about it for sure. So not very eventful ending but I ain't making up some bullshit for your entertainment. I already have a fictional story you can listen to Reddx narrate those on the channel I'm sure. Have a lovely day and I'm gonna go get a kebab folks.",1,1731005038.0,ReddXReads,0,1.0,False

I’m genuinely surprised we didn’t get a “holding your hand” speech dropped into the TAZ Feed. Haven’t checked the MBMBAM feed and I don’t really want to.

 Shaggy dog man named Dr Travis Barker. Something something shaggy dog story Travis? Guess that sums up Grad pretty well. He’s in the flaming kitchen with Lyle. I guess he invented the robots?

Lyle wants to punch some foam into the robots eyehole. “Huh… okay, cool.” 

My Abnimals experience was that when I was in college, my local comic shop got a shipment of these 30 year old TMNT booster packs that came with a piece of candy, some trading cards, and occasionally a cheap toy or sticker. Anyways, the guy told me specifically not to eat the candy that was in the packet because it was around 30 years old at that point. Guess what I did?

Anyways it tasted like wet cardboard and used erasers. Nastiest thing I’ve ever put in my mouth and the taste LINGERED. To be fair the candy probably wasn’t good even in 1991, and the ravages of time did it no favors. 0/10 would not recommend eating 30 year old candy from a pack of trading cards. 

Travis (dog): “Here’s the shutoff switch. Please don’t kill my robot son.”

Justin: “You know what? I might. Im not gonna go out of my way to not kill him, but no promises.” 

Clint attacks its weak point for massive damage. 

(It’s like mostly combat for the entire first 20 minutes. The same combat from last episode. At least there’s no super cool NPC with Enoby hair with red streaks and red eyes who is related to Gerard Way [an if you don’t know who dat is, you can GET TEH HEC OUT!] saving them within the first round of combat.)

Griffin is cramming Doritos into the robot holes. Lots of hole-cramming this episode. Doritos bad (sometimes) Vegetables good. Torturing prisoners for information, good. All of this mans holes are stuffed with snacks. Roger rams into the back of his head, but Lyle wasn’t allowed to attack this guy with the axe?

“This is the number one Cloud ERP for a reason.” Uh, Justin, I’ve been on Deviantart and Tumblr. I’m pretty sure I’ve seen way better ERP involving Cloud. 

Travis Accounting shoutout.

Heroforge partnership! Something adventure related on the Adventure Zone. They sponsored DnD in a castle with Trav. Apparently, they gave away free Travis miniatures at the event. $2,000 dollars for that event, remember? Not including room and board. Totally valid! Who do I talk to to grab one of these little guys? I’ve got a jar that needs fillin and radiatin’

The biggest revelation is that Vart is actually running a home game of DnD. Like for fun. With actual players and minis and everything. 

The final Twenty Fungalore tour. Naming of the year is coming up I guess. Twentytwentysurvive? Twentystayalive? Twentytwentyknives? (Stab a guy! [in Minecraft]) 

Blart is coming soon, of course. I bought a copy from the last video store in my city before it closed down for good. Might try to make a custom Reliqary for it, to celebrate the feast of St Blart. 

Aabria is doing the TAZ live shows. They mention murdering Fungalore on the last show. I think it’d be so fuckin funny if they beheaded him GWAR style with the blood spray and got the front row audience splashed with goo. Fungalore did not grant Kyle Gass’s wish. 

I saw GWAR at Brockie’s last tour in Atlanta at the old Masquerade where the floors in heaven wobbled when you walked on them and you could see the bands performing below through the floor cracks. There’s a new one now that’s a bit LESS of an obvious death trap. 

I met a cool Enby at the Laura Jane Grace show recently. They’re from the same small-ass population 50 middle of nowhere town I used to live in in Tennessee. However they revealed that after 2015 it got incorporated into the nearest big city and is now an actual town with public transportation and everything. 

Trav is in the 20 sided tavern. I still have no idea what that actually is. 

New merch: a Do Not Drink! Mug. My dumb ass would use it for paint water and still drink it. 

Roger is officially the leader of the still-unnamed group. 

Knives on feet gives Navy a business card. Embossed. My god, it even has a watermark. 

Robots and Abnimals both cross the rainbow bridge when they die. Justin says heaven doesn’t exist but there is definitely a hell. Salamandersara? 

Oh hey next episode they get to upgrade their characters. Wonder if we’ll get another absolutely zero-stakes episode like the “training arc” where if they finish the physical challenge and get the flag out of the Sewer Slide, they get to win a ticket to Universal Studios Florida and the Home Edition of the carvery. 

 We’ve got Snarf. The cat assistant to Travis (dog.) don’t know if they’re a hairless cat Abnimal so we can’t get check that one off the BING(us) board just yet. 

Ending scene: A Dragon Rider tells us to not set humans on fire. I stopped counting the amount of NPCs Trav has added. 

Shout out to the nice people at the coffee place who gave me an e yea shot of espresso. Shout out to my friends who are actively making sure I don’t die. Shout out to my work for giving me solo assignments and not really caring that I work with one headphone in so long as I get done before 3:30. Protect trans kids.

1glxod5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1glxod5/im_afraid_of_being_bothersome_is_asking_her_out/,I'm afraid of being bothersome. Is asking her out again a mistake?,"Hello

I'm a 21 y.o. man. An international student in a european country, originally from the Middle East. (If these info matter at all)

I saw a girl many times on our campus(2 years ago). And i really liked her, but i never asked her out. 
At the time, i was a skinny boy, who hated himself, dealing with anxiety and depression,  which are being treated, and now i care a bit more about my looks and hairs, and i feel i look way better.

Anyway, we made several eye contacts throughout this time. But since  i never introduced myself to her, i feel like maybe i was some sort of intrusion to her privacy? I wasn't staring or something, but i would notice her.

This summer, i met her on the street close to the campus, and i buit up my courage to finally walk up to her.

I told her, "" i've seen her in the campus, and i was wondering if i can take her out for a coffee.""
She replied so happily with excitement, and even she initiated many questions and short convo in the 2-3minutesd that we talked over there on the street.
At the end she said that she will go to her hometown for a few weeks and we can meet after she comes back.
She said 2 times ""oh this is so nice""

I took her ig and and i messaged her 3-4 days later. About a recent post of hers(just to initiate the conversation). She seen the message after 3 weeks and never replied. After a week i sent her another message asking how are u feeling. And after a week i didn't get a reply. I unfollowed and delted my messages.

My conclusion was:
"" That's a probably rude, but clear NO."" 
OR 
""She wants me to chase or sth. But i wont for 2 reasons, first i dont knoe where to draw the line, so i dont want to annoy/harass someone, and second, for the self respect""


But now, we a have a class at the same time (different rooms) and i see her heavy stares to me. What is that??!!

Only few things come to my mind:

She just dislikes me. it's like a look of victory  after rejecting.
- checking if im looking?
- a permission so that i can go further and maybe talk to her again? (Ask whatsupp, shy didn't u reply, in a friendly manner).
* i just dont want to bother her and cause any discomfort.

U might say ""move on,"" and i totally agree with that. 
But the stupid, dreamy, young me has dreamt about her for so long. I feel creeped out when i look at these thoughts from a 3rd person pov.
I dont find anyone as beautiful as her anymore, the facial structure is just, different, she is just... perfect. Astonishingly attractive in her own way. Like an angel. And not conventioally, but in her own way.

I had a very different dream about her last night, which made me write this post.
She was stating the reasons why she backed off, but she was hugging me, even kissed me on the cheeks(face), although i was so reluctant to sit next to her and talk to her in the dream.

I don't want to annoy her, but i want to have a chance. Im already Middle Eastern, so im also scared of the stereotype, which is out of my countrol.


Im sorry for rambling and writing such a long post, but i didn't want to miss something important. Thank you for your patience.

Who are a little bit difficult to buy for.,"I’ll try to give as much information on each of them as I can. In my perspective, they always give so much and never expect anything in return. they never say they ever want anything or need anything so it’s very hard to buy for them, but they also have very interesting interests. That is also why it’s super hard to buy gifts for them. because of this I usually end up buying something custom-made but I fear it has gotten too much lol. Any suggestions? 

Brother- 20 years old going to a Christian university. He plays football there, but it isn’t his whole life And I would really prefer to stay away from gifts that pertain to that. He is somewhat religious so I thought about getting him a journal, but he has many of those that he buys himself. He doesn’t drink coffee doesn’t like cozy, blankets or socks and has more clothes than anyone would ever need, he does not need gift cards or money either because that’s what our extended family gives him each year because of the same issue. He is is not really into the fashion scene so he does not wear hats or any type of jewelry. He does game but very little so gifts on that side I don’t know if he would like. He does go to the gym, but I’ve already bought him protein powder, water bottles, and anything else I could’ve thought of.

Dad- 55 and married with an empty nest. I also have bought too many custom gifts for him since it’s very very hard for me to buy gifts for males I guess lol. He Likes to hunt and grill, but he has so many grilling tools he does not need anymore. I thought about spice or hot sauce, but he doesn’t need any more of those. He snowmobiles sometimes in the winter with friends and also works as a real estate agent. I thought about heated jackets or gloves and so forth, but he already has those as well. He does not drink, coffee or wear, jewelry either. I believe that he has ADHD so maybe there’s a few business, and powering or ADHD books for males out there that could be a possibility as well?

I really like to do unique gifts that not a lot of people and don’t often receive so if anyone can give ideas that would be greatly appreciated!:)",1,1731004757.0,Gifts,9,1.0,False

1glxmec,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1glxmec,Mild periodontitis: GumX opinions & bone loss prognosis ,"First of all thank you in advance (& I apologize for the photo quality)! 

I was recently diagnosed with mild periodontitis and was told that I have bone loss (which I can see to an extent). I was also told that once a pocket is formed, I will continue to have bone loss even with good oral hygiene. 

I had two questions:

1. GumX:
I was recommended (in addition to brushing, flossing, and water flossing) GumX. I’ve never heard of it before, and I didn’t see much about it online. I wanted to ask for thoughts on it, and if there are other more affordable options (I was told it costs $1500 for 6 months - I really can’t afford that right now).

2. Bone loss (& periodontitis prognosis):
Am I really going to have bone loss for the rest of my life? I would just like a realistic expectation. 

Social history: 
I drink coffee (a lot) 
Alcohol - yes 
Smoking - no 

Other pertinent history: I used to have a permanent retainer on my mandibular teeth before it fell out - which is why that area was the worst.

Long-term anxiety haver here (10+ years. Diagnosed with GAD, MDD, and OCD). I just got back into therapy because I noticed that my health anxiety had recently crawled back up. I had been body checking like crazy and experiencing all of my hallmark anxiety symptoms (chest pain, muscle soreness, stomach issues, etc), so I decided to schedule an appointment.

The session went great but last night I had a really bad anxiety attack out of nowhere. Maybe it came from mentioning trauma and triggers to my therapist? Anyway, I struggled to sleep but eventually made it to bed around 3am.

Today I just feel… anxious and exhausted. I had coffee with a friend and I felt like I could barely get it down without being nauseous. Have you guys ever experienced a flare-up?

1glxk1s,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavvyFridays/comments/1glxk1s/haden_compact_microwave_black_friday_deal_2024/,HADEN Compact Microwave Black Friday Deal 2024,"Just caught an incredible Black Friday deal on the **HADEN Compact Microwave** that made my heart skip a beat! The sleek [matte black beauty](https://www.geappliances.com/ge/black-slate-appliances.htm) I've been using daily for the past year is now available at an unbeatable price - [feast your eyes on this](https://savvyfridays.com/deal/haden-compact-microwave/?c76ll0) before the deal vanishes!


I bought my first HADEN last winter, and it's become the quiet hero of my kitchen. Unlike those bulky, institutional-looking machines, this 700-watt wonder fits perfectly in my modest apartment kitchen like it was meant to be there. The matte finish doesn't just resist fingerprints; it adds this understated elegance that makes my countertop look like it belongs in a fancy cooking magazine.


What really won me over was how intuitive it is to use. Five power levels might sound basic, but they're perfectly calibrated - I've never had that awful moment where my coffee is either lukewarm or hot enough to strip paint. The defrost function has saved countless dinner plans when I've forgotten to thaw meat ahead of time (which happens more often than I'd like to admit).


The 20-liter capacity hits the sweet spot - it's compact enough to save space but still fits my largest dinner plates. Last week, I managed to heat up an entire casserole dish without that annoying plate-rotating dance you do with smaller microwaves. The sound it makes when finished is actually pleasant - more like a gentle reminder than that harsh BEEP BEEP BEEP that makes you jump out of your skin.


I'm buying another one with this deal for my parents because they keep ""borrowing"" mine when they visit. Every time they come over, my mom finds an excuse to heat something up, then gives me that look that says, ""Why doesn't ours work this nicely?"" At this price point, I can finally stop playing microwave custody battles with them.


This deal is honestly too good to keep to myself - it's the kind of value that makes you want to text all your friends at midnight. If you've been waiting to upgrade your tired old microwave, this is your moment.",1,1731004568.0,SavvyFridays,0,1.0,False

I\`m a full-time traveller from China. I have been living and working in Beijing for more than 10 years, Xi\`an is my hometown. I have been to most of the provinces, and more than 100 cities in China throughout different seasons. I also travelled a lot abroad, and stayed in Europe for a year, so I think I may be able to look at traveling in China in a mixed view to offer you guys more advice.

Despite the huge language barrier and cultural difference, more and more international travellers are coming to visit China, I have recently initiated my YouTube channel, and I hope I can share more tips and traveling experience with you guys. I am currently working on my new series for Insights on China, with the first EP being *""10 tips for traveling in China""*. Here are some scripts I have popped up with, which I believe will be essential for new travellers into China.

**1.If you have any questions, or what other difficulties you have encountered when travelling in China. Please feel free to leave a comment, I will try my best to answer.**

I have also considered other EPs to include in this series, including 1) Best destinations in China for a Christmas & New Year trip; 2) Typical cultural shocks and how to deal with them in China; 3) Run into another stereotype while breaking the old ones; 4) How do Chinese people define dynasties; 5) step-by-step tutorial of how to register for applications needed in China, and more. 

**2.Tell me if you guys are interested in these contents, or any other contents you may be curious about, I can write my scripts and release here first.** :)

Hope you all enjoy your travel in China! Good Luck!

1.Payment system:

* People use Alipay and WeChat pay all the time, there are QR codes everywhere from buying a ticket to a scenic spot or paying a small vendor for snacks or meals.
* In some rare circumstances, only cash is accepted, so better to prepare for cash of about 500 Yuan as a back-up.

2.VPN & Maps

* Google, Whatsapp, Line, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok are prohibited in the mainland. Be sure to set up VPN before entering into China.
* For maps, Baidu or Gaode are comprehensively used by Chinese people, but only in Chinese version. Apple Maps works pretty well in China, you can find route for subways, restaurants, coffee shops, etc. Unfortunately, I didn\`t find any available maps of Android version in English.

3.Traffic & Hotel:

* Traffic: In total, there are 58 cities in China which has its own urban subway system, it\`s easy to use the built-in application in the Alipay to scan the QR codes for taking a subway and processing payment without buying a ticket.
* Bullet trains: generally, we use trip.com to book tickets. There is also an official application called Railway 12306 (铁路 12306) in EN version, which could be used for train ticket purchasing. You can purchase tickets as earliest as 15 days before departure on 12306, and you can see when your tickets are going to be on sale. And most importantly, it does not charge a commission compared to trip.com.
* Hotel: usually booked through [trip.com](http://trip.com), but I have seen some travellers run into a situation, in which it was only after they arrived at the hotel, that the staff told them they do not accept foreign customers. I did some research, it is illegal for hotels to do so, if you encounter this situation, just call the police.

4.Useful Applications:

* Car hailing: use Didi, both the application in the Appstore or the built-in version in Alipay or Wechat works well; Shouyue could be a back-up, but the price is higher, and the vehicles are in better condition.
* Dazhongdianping(大众点评): all the needs for living are covered in this application, including restaurants, movie tickets, massages, gyms, etc. Good thing is that it provides a system EN version, but the vendors\` information on it is AI translation, which needs double confirmation.
* Meituan (美团) or Eleme (饿了么): both of them are in CN, and are mostly used for food delivery service, which is quite cheap compared to in Western countries. The mini-program version could be translated into English.

5.Washroom:

* Use Apple maps to search for toilets. As for how you can tell whether it\`s a squatting on or seated one, try this: if the washroom is located in a shopping mall, office building or scenic spots, they would normally set up a seated one; but if it\`s a public toilets on the streets, especially in old-town districts, it will probably be a squatting one.
* Best solution: you won\`t be charged if you are using washrooms of MacDonalds, KFC or Starbucks, and they would normally offer a clean seated one.

[6.Food](http://6.Food) culture:

* types of dining: there are basically two ways of dining in the restaurants, which is pretty much important for it influence how you order your food. In smaller restaurants, we order food of one portion per person, similar to a set menu, with typical a portion of noodles (面条), dumplings(水饺), or rice with toppings of meat and vegetables(盖饭) just for a single person. Typical names of these restaurants includes: Shaxian Snacks (沙县小吃), Xibumahua(西部马华), Hangzhou Small Dumplings (杭州小笼包), Lanzhou Noodles (兰州拉面), Yellow Fried Chicken with Rice (黄焖鸡米饭), Guilin Rice Noodles (桂林米粉), etc. In bigger or more decent restaurants, we Chinese people order different dishes, whether in meat, vegetables or soups, and we share different dishes with each other accompanied by some rice, steamed bread or noodles, which are called main food (主食). The second type includes a varieties of restaurants, which I couldn\`t list here, but I\`m willing to offer you some recommendations for a specific city in the comment zone. In conclusion, if you would like to have a quick meal or just yourself, you can try the first pattern, or if you have a large family, it\`s better to dining in the latter ones, and obviously the latter is more expensive pricewise.
* In different districts in China, the food culture varies a lot. But in every different city in China, you can always find these two different types of restaurants, the street food one for one portion, and the elegant, decent one for all family members to get together. If you are not sure what to eat, you can leave your comment. I am willing to provides you with my recommendations. Just another information, there is no tipping culture in China, you don\`t need to tip anyone (in some rare cases the service fee will be included in the rate charged to bill), just saying good or Haochi (好吃) and put your thumbs up are fairly enough.
* food allergy or vegan menu: food allergy could be referred to as Jikou ""忌口"" in China, basically the waiter or the waitress will ask for special requirement of the food you ordered. Some of the typical things Chinese people would answer usually are to avoid ingredients like coriander, ginger or garlic, etc. If you are allergic to egg, soy, sesame or fishes, you can put it like ""我不能吃鸡蛋(egg)/芝麻(seasame)/花生(peanut)/鱼(fish)“ to make sure the dishes does not contain these things. For wheat and soy, it might be a little tricky, try to eat rice with vegetables or meat to avoid wheat; and soy sauce is a commonly used flavouring, I think it is hard to deal with. For vegetarian menu or if you are on a diet, don\`t worry, there will always be vegetarian food in any restaurants of type 2. Just order Fried Rice with Eggs (蛋炒饭) or Green Vegetables with Rice (青菜配米饭) or you can tell them I\`m vegan in ""我吃素""。

7.Local desserts & milk tea:

* In most parts of China, there are always some desserts unique to these places, which would generally be a local snack brand or famous local desserts. If you would like to buy some local snacks for your family or friends, here are some recommendations: Baoshifu(鲍师傅)/Daoxiangcun(稻香村) in Beijing, Butterfly Cake(蝴蝶酥) in Park Hotel in Shanghai, Luxihe (泸溪河) in Nanjing, Shanghai, Guangzhou or Shenzhen; Flower Cake (鲜花饼) in Kunming, etc.
* Milk tea brands are evolving extremely fast in China, there are just so many choices and every year new brands are coming out. Famous ones include: Xicha(喜茶), Lelecha (乐乐茶), Naixuedecha (奈雪的茶), Chagee(霸王茶姬), Mixue(蜜雪冰城), Coco, Chahuanong(茶话弄), etc. And some of them are only restricted to certain cities, like Chayanyuese(茶颜悦色), which is the most No. 1 popular among all over the country, but only have stores in Changsha, Wuhan, Chongqing, Nanjing and Suzhou; Ah Ma Handmade (阿嬷手作) only in Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chengdu, Naning, Shanghai and Nanjing.
* And the good thing is by using Apple Map, you can easily search the ones nearest to you by typing the titles of shops above in alphabets.

[8.Coffee](http://8.Coffee) & gym:

* For coffee consumers, there are not only western brands including Tims, Starbucks, Peet\`s coffee, which are generally more expensive, with a price of grande americano of 30 yuan. Local brands like Luckin, Kudi, Manner, are much cheaper. Just as usual, type in brands in Apple Maps to find the ones near you.
* For people who works out a lot, it might not be enough to use the gym in hotel since some equipments might be missing. Better to use Dazhongdianping to search for a gym, and most gyms in China usually offers a 1st time trial at a very affordable price, which is absolutely a suitable choice for travellers, I think.

9.Language & gestures:

* For those who have tried to speak some mandarin to local people, it\`s better to learn how the four tones work, in order to make yourself understood. Different tones will offer exactly different meanings to words. So, if you are trying to learn some basic words, be sure to keep the tones in mind too.
* The Pinyin (拼音) system is how Chinese people label the pronunciation of Chinese characters, which indeed became the names of places in other alphabetic languages. There are some typical mis-pronounciation of the pinyin system, like Q is pronounced as /tʃ/ not /k/, so you may find QianMen is pronounced as /tʃien men/. This might be a barrier for you to pronounce the name of the place appropriately.

10.Gestures

* If you don\`t speak mandarin, better to learn how to gesture numbers in a Chinese way, it offers you a easier way to describe figures with Chinese people. It\`s hard to explain here in texts. I will put it in my video.

Above all, if you would like to know more about anything mentioned above, I\`d love to share more informative contents with you.",8,1731004559.0,travelchina,0,1.0,False

1glxf1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nonsleep/comments/1glxf1c/my_son_and_i_built_a_free_library_in_our_front/,my son and i built a free library in our front yard. someone left a book in it.,"My neighborhood isn't your cliche movie neighborhood. The lawns aren't perfect, kids don't leave bikes lying around on the sidewalks, and neighbors don't smile and wave as you drive by.  We all kind of mind our own business, for the most part. To be honest, I don't think I've ever had a conversation with any one of my neighbors. But to my defense, my neighborhood isn't built like a traditional neighborhood.

I live in Castro Valley. Emphasis on the ""valley."" The entire town is built on hills. The block I live on resembles more of a roller coaster than a street. I wish I could say you get used to living like this, but you don't. My house is smack in the middle of a hill; and after a decade of living here, I've discovered that I'm a ""house half uphill"" kind of guy.

My ten-year-old son, Cooper, loves it here. There's a single-screen movie theater down the street, next door to that is a comic book shop, across the street is an ice cream parlor, and a few blocks over is Golfland. I'm convinced that Castro Valley was designed by a child.

Cooper had overheard my wife and I talking about how unfriendly our neighborhood felt and he had an idea of how we could do our part in fixing it. When he visits my mother-in-law, they like to go on walks. I guess a neighbor of hers has one of those Little Free Library things in their front yard. The mailbox looking thing that the owner fills with books, and anyone walking by is encouraged to trade one of their own books for one in the library. Cooper said we could fill it with all of our favorite books, so our neighbors could get to know us a little better.

He had spring break coming up, and I had vacation days lying around, so I planned on taking the week off to spend with him. I figured building the library was a great opportunity for a father-son project.

The sun was setting, and admittedly, it may have taken a little longer than anticipated to build, but there it was nonetheless. We took a step back and admired the little library that was now standing firmly in our yard. I handed him a paintbrush and told him that all the library was missing was a name. He gave it some thought, then started with the brush. When he moved away, I could see that he painted ""Greenridge Road Library"" in big green letters. Fittingly named after the street we live on.

The next day, I peeled myself off of my mattress and dragged my feet into the kitchen. Cooper was sitting on the couch, fully dressed, shoes tied, hair brushed, ready to go. I have weird attachments to all of Cooper's stuff. He's our only child, so every little thing of his is tethered to precious memories. I couldn't just let him put his books, which my wife and I read to him over the years, outside for strangers to take. So, I told him we would go to the bookstore to get new books to use.

Before we left, Cooper ran over to check our Greenridge Road Library. I hurried to catch up to him when I saw him jumping up and down with excitement. He screamed ""Dad! Dad! Look!"" And to my surprise, there was already a book sitting inside of the little library, patiently waiting for us to adopt it.

It was a Penguin Random House children's book titled: ""How to Swim and Dive."" It was a cute, little, vintage, book about learning how to swim. And even though it was covered in a clear, but yellowing, protective jacket; the book was extremely weathered. It looked decades old. The style of the cover art and pictures throughout the pages made me think it may be midcentury era. The once bright colored spine was cracking and had a slight tear through the ""V"" in the book name, giving it the new title: ""How to Swim and Die."" That got a guilty chuckle out of me.

The book jacket proudly wore a sticker for the Hayward Public Library. Hayward is Castro Valley's sister city, so it wasn't too surprising that a book from there ended up minutes away in our front yard. What was surprising was the fully intact checkout card still in the sleeve on the inside. The only name and date on the card were: Roger Davis on April 3rd, 1964.

Out of curiosity, I Googled the name Roger Davis. Facebook and LinkedIn profiles popped up, all of smiling young men that were half of the age my Roger Davis would be today. I tried to narrow the search down by adding ""California,"" but no luck. I'm old enough to remember life before the internet, So I went to scavenge for The Yellow Pages book that I thought we still had somewhere.

If I had given it any real thought, I would have remembered that we got rid of our last one about five spring cleanings ago. I figured this would be the perfect time to introduce my son to the public library system. I told Cooper that we could go to the Hayward Library; since that was where the book was originally from. And we could maybe even see if they could look up any information on Roger Davis.

Although he was incredibly eager to get inside and work the case, Cooper still held the library door open for the fragile moving old man walking behind us. The librarian glared at me over the top of her thick lenses, with an ""Are you serious?"" look on her face. She sighed and lectured me on why she couldn't share the private information of their members, even if they had it. Which they didn’t. Those records were long gone. Also long gone: the Yellow Pages, apparently. I don’t know why I assumed the library would have them, but they didn’t. So, I ordered one on my phone to be delivered to my house and we left. On the way out, Cooper whispered to me that he'd be a nicer librarian for The Greenridge Road Library.

The following day was a hotter than usual spring day. My wife and I decided that a family day at the community pool sounded good. We didn't have a pool in our backyard, and no one else we knew did, either. And as a result, Cooper wasn't the best swimmer. But lucky for him, we just so happened to have come into the custody of a how-to swim book.

We got to the pool and I had the highly important job of securing pool chairs for my family. It took me a little while to collect enough chairs. It would have taken longer, if not for the elderly gentleman who graciously volunteered his chair to me. His attempt at hiding from the sun under a bucket hat and sunglasses was failing, so he was leaving anyway. He was amused that I was carrying around such a vintage book. On his way out, he gave the faintest smile and said that he had the same book when he was younger.

I started thumbing through the pages to see if there were any good pointers that I could relay to Cooper, and I must not have looked hard enough the first time we found the book because I now noticed handwritten numbers on the bottom corner of every page. Two numbers on each page and they didn't correspond to the page number at all. The first page had ""37."" The next one had ""66,"" the third page had ""46,"" and so on; fifteen numbers in total. There was no obvious reason or pattern to the order, but they were neatly written and obviously intentional.

I'm not too proud to admit that my wife is smarter than I am, but I still felt like a complete idiot when it only took her a millisecond to glance at the pages and say ""Oh, neat! It's coordinates.""  Of course. Why wasn't that my first guess? Cooper asked what coordinates were and when I explained them to him, he got really excited at the thought of it being buried treasure. That excitement soured to disappointment when I shot down his proposal to go chase the coordinates that exact minute. I told him we could go the following day, and then hit the biggest cannonball he's ever seen as a distraction.

Cooper shook me until I fully woke up. He wouldn't stop until I had Google Maps open. He watched with anticipation as I typed in each number of the coordinates. The pin dropped into a cluster of trees, a little ways off of the Ward Creek walking trail in the Hayward hills. To his delight, it was only a ten-minute drive away.

Cooper was so excited walking that trail. He's not an introvert, but he rarely talks to strangers. That day, he was waving and saying hi to everyone we crossed paths with. The family walking their dog got a hey from Cooper. He said ""Have a nice day"" to the pale-haired, old man, that was catching his breath on a bench. One jogger even got a high-five from Cooper.

I couldn't help but feel like an irresponsible parent when we reached the point of the walkway that we had to diverge off of to get to the coordinates. It didn't seem like the safest trek for a ten-year-old to make, but I couldn't stomach telling him that he couldn't see this through. As we approached the coordinates, I could make out glimpses of unnatural colors in the distance. At first, I thought it was a group of people, and slid Cooper behind me as we walked up.

Standing directly on top of the coordinates, we were dead center to a group of trees. On each tree, was a t-shirt nailed to it; creating a surrounding audience. The shirts were small, like they'd fit Cooper. Six in total. Vintage, ringer style shirts with red trim and matching red font that read ""Hayward Plunge."" On the inside tags, I could make out handwritten names: John, Henry, Susie, Wayne, Donna, and Jackie.

I had no idea what Hayward Plunge meant or who these names belonged to, but that didn't really matter, I was full on panicking. My fight or flight was in high gear. This wasn't the innocent treasure hunt we thought it would be. This was wrong, very wrong. I was wrong to bring my son here. I played enough high school football to know what dried blood stains looked like on fabric.

I didn't want to let Cooper see the concern on my face, and I knew he was on the verge of asking if we could start digging for the treasure that he thought was beneath us. I needed to get him out of there as soon as possible. I tried to drum up fake enthusiasm and say we needed to celebrate us making it to the finish line. I told him we deserved ice cream for our hard work. He wasn't ready to leave until I told him he could get as many scoops and toppings as he wanted. Luckily, that was enough to get him out of there.

I thought a night of sleep would help distance me from the kid's shirts on the trees, but it didn't. It was on my mind as I got out of bed, and as I made my coffee, and was very prominently on my mind as I stood at the front room window watching my own child play in the front yard. I watched him look under rocks for bugs, and lay in the grass, and eventually check The Greenridge Road Library. Then, I watched him run into the house holding a stack of books.

He proudly laid them out on display. My stomach turned as I realized they were more vintage books. Artwork and color palettes from an era long gone. Titles like ""The Clumsy Cowboy"" and ""Hurry Up, Slowpoke."" I peeked over his shoulder as he grabbed one and skimmed through the pages. On the inside cover, read the generic ""this book belongs to:"" with Wayne scribbled under it.

For the last twenty-four hours, six names have been playing on a loop in my head. Wayne was one of them. I grabbed a different book and opened it: Susie. I didn't need to grab anymore, I already knew what I'd find. But I did anyway. One inside cover after the other; John, then Jackie, then Henry, and finally Donna.

I was ready to tear the Greenridge Road Library out of the ground at this point. I scoured through my Ring notifications. Ever since we installed the library, it seemed like all of Castro Valley stops by and looks through it. I had hundreds of clips of people in front of it. It could have been any one of them. I dissected each clip to see if I could find who left the books. The problem was that the library was positioned in a way that the camera couldn't see if someone was taking or placing books. To be honest, this made me incredibly skeptical of my neighbors. Was it the dad walking his kids? The moms pushing strollers? The dog walker group? The mailman?

I gave up the hunt and set my phone on my lap as the clips continued playing. At this point, I was fully losing it. I don't know why this upset me as much as it did. It's not like someone is putting inappropriate material in the library. No one was committing crimes. It was just weird and creepy. I thought maybe it was an elaborate prank. I was willing to accept it as a prank and move on.

When I picked up my phone, it was halfway through a clip. There was no one in front of the Greenridge Road Library, or my house. So, I was confused as to why this was recorded. Then in the corner of the frame, I noticed an old man, standing across the street, and looking at the library. He remained still for an uncomfortable amount of time before turning and leaving. The video was super grainy and he was so far away that I couldn't make out any details of his face. It felt strange, though. This was enough to make me want to solve all of this, simply so I could feel like my family was safe in our home.

I tried to take inventory of all the information I had. The books, the names, the year on the library card, the coordinates, and the blood stained shirts on the trees. Shirts that had text on them. ""Hayward Plunge."" I typed the phrase into a search bar. The first suggestion was a link to the Hayward Parks and Rec website. To the right of that was a small collage consisting of a map, street view, and picture of the inside of a building.

Built in 1936, the Hayward Plunge is an indoor swimming facility. It's essentially one big pool inside of a hangar-like structure. Additionally, after seeing the map of where the plunge was located, I realized the trail that I was just on the other day, ran directly behind the building. Finally, things were starting to click.

I was waiting at the front desk as the teenager working it went off to get the manager. I felt a little foolish, but at this point, there was no way I could leave this thread loose. The manager came walking up and asked how they could help me. I took a deep breath and made the jump. I explained how I came into possession of Roger Davis's swim instruction book, how it led me to the trail, and to the displayed Hayward Plunge shirts. Which all brought me there to speak with her.I don't know what I was expecting. It was a lot of random information to unload on an unsuspecting stranger. I for sure wasn't expecting the manager's face to drop like it did. She paused for a second, then asked ""Could we talk in my office?""

I took a seat at the desk across from her. She didn't hesitate. She said, ""Back in the day there was a small beginner swimming class that had some students who went missing."" That was chilling enough, but she continued. ""This was in the 60's, so they didn't have camera surveillance or anything like that. The Hayward P.D. didn't have any evidence of who took the kids or where the kids went."" I didn't know what to say. I didn't need to say anything, because she wasn't done. This time needing a little more strength, eventually pushing out, ""It's like, an urban legend around here, so take it with a grain of salt; but people say their swim instructor had something to do with the missing kids."" I could see it in her eyes before her words came out. I knew what was coming next. She looked me dead in the eye and said, ""The instructor, his name.... was Roger.""

Everything was still spinning when I strapped my seatbelt in and it didn’t stop during the drive home. What did I invite to my home? What danger did I put my son in? Who or where was Roger Davis? That last question would be answered a lot quicker than I anticipated.

Waiting for me at our front door, was the gigantic waste of paper that is, the Yellow Pages. It made a huge thud on my kitchen table when I set it down to grab a beer. I could feel it staring at me the whole time. Begging me to open it. I knew I had to, but I really didn't want to. I was already fed up with this whole situation. It had escalated to points that I was not prepared for. I looked back at the yellow pages. It was just sitting there. I took a swig of beer and said fuck it.

I found the residents section and made my way to the names under D. It didn’t take long to put my finger over the first Davis. It was a page over and near the bottom, but there he was. Roger M. Davis. I should have left it there. Cool, I found him. Mission accomplished. I should have taken the win and moved on with my life. But I just couldn't help myself. I needed to know.

I panned to the right of his name, where his address was. I felt my beer rising in my throat as I did. Next to his name and under ""current address"" was, Green Ridge Road.

The scariest house isn't always the one that looks like it. It's not always the dilapidated house with the dead lawn and shady looking tenets who won't make eye contact with you. Sometimes it's the house that's painted in the friendliest shade of soft yellow. The one that has an American flag perfectly flying from the porch. The one with the old man that comes out like clockwork to hand water his lawn. The house that you have no problem sending your kid to their front door for candy on Halloween. What is it they say about book covers?

Roger Davis was arrested for the murders of John and Jackie Miller, ages 9 and 8. Donna Zimmerman, age 7. Wayne Jackson, age 8. Susie Lee, age 8. Henry Parker, age 6. Almost sixty years after he committed the crimes. He was 86 at the time of his arrest.

I gave the police everything I had. They used fingerprints from Henry Parker's copy of ""The Rise and Fall of Ben Gizzard,"" that was left in our library, to match with some found on belongings of his that his diligent mother kept well preserved after all these years. Roger's prints were also a match on all of the kid's books, as well as the ""How to Swim and Dive"" manual we found in our little library.

Cadaver dogs hit on the area of the coordinates and they were able to recover the remains of all the children. My stomach still fills with shame and dread because I willingly brought my son to the burial site. I let him stand feet above the bones of murdered children as we played around on a pretend scavenger hunt.

We were in the middle of dinner weeks later when I heard the sirens. Flashing lights followed, reflecting off our walls. Our street doesn't get police activity very often, if at all. I knew who they were coming for.

It took me a couple of minutes to walk down my street and get to the house surrounded by the crime scene tape. As I approached, two officers walked out a slightly hunched, white-haired man, in handcuffs. He looked frail and confused, and unremarkable from any other elderly person in the community. He wasn't someone who looked like they would be getting arrested. The policemen closed the squad door behind him, regardless.

I observed him as he sat in the backseat of the cop car. He wasn't moving at all and he was seemingly focused on the nothingness in front of him. He stayed like this for an uncomfortable amount of time.

An officer told me he couldn't share any information on the case, not knowing that I was the one who revived the six cold cases with my findings. There wasn't much more for me to see, and it felt like it was time for me to head back home.

I looked one more time at Roger. I just wanted to burn into my eyes what evil could look like, so I never put my son in danger ever again. After a few seconds, the vile old man slowly started to turn his whole body towards the window. Towards me.

His face was blank and devoid of any humanity. He pointed his vacant and dark eyes at me. I could see the faintest bit of recognition from him once he saw me. I didn't want to look away. I didn't want to give him the satisfaction of seeing fear on someone one last time. Even if I was terrified inside.

My last glimpse of him, before the car hauled him away, was the slow movement of his mouth forming the slightest, perverted, grin. He was enjoying this. He knew that he'd die soon, and he'd essentially got away with his crimes. I don't think that's what made him smile in that moment, though.

He knew that I'd see him again. Every time I watched someone leave a book in the Green Ridge Road Library for Cooper, or when Cooper's baseball coach pulls him aside to give him tips on his swing, or when I had parent-teacher conferences and met Cooper's teachers. He knew that I'd see him in every one of those people that I was trusting to be around my son.

He knew that's how he would live on.",1,1731004235.0,Nonsleep,0,1.0,False
1glxe03,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manipulation/comments/1glxe03/is_this_manipulation_or_am_i_f22_the_problem_like/,Is this manipulation or am I (F22) the problem like he (M27) says.,"This is my first ever relationship. Recently my boyfriend has been getting upset with me for not doing enough and he says I’m neglecting him. Telling me I need to I need to work on myself to be able to nurture him.

So I do try and do better for myself by Recently deciding to finally find a psychiatrist to at least get closure for the problems I’ve been struggling with for so long. Which ended up being ADHD and Depression, I did began to suspect I had ADD when I couldn’t study right unless I’m in a small closet to force away distractions. When I decided to try to get into books again but I’d read a whole page and completely don’t remember anything I just read. Forgetfulness etc.

We’ve only been together since June 19 of this year. I’m going to start with the first time he got upset with me. So it was July a month after we started dating, he began to ask me if I’m forgetting something and questioning me if I knew what was coming up. First I’m like “no why?” But he kept being vague and made it seem like I was missing something, which made me nervous so I wasn’t confident in what to say. After going back and forth I began to question if it was about the date of the month, he still wasn’t confirming but it was obvious that he was getting irritated. Then I was thinking about how the next day was the 19th which was the date we began dating but I wasn’t confident enough to assume that’s what he was talking about.

Then I finally asked him if he was talking about the next day being the 19th. He still didn’t say yes or no and replied with “what do you think.” So I realized it’s about the date we first met. I don’t remember if I asked him or just thought to myself of why he’s bringing it up. But he was upset and told me I forgot about our anniversary, he said females should be counting down to that day. He also began to tell me that he’s the man and he shouldn’t be the one who’s more adamant about an anniversary it’s like a female thing and I should have been excited and remembered. He then asked if I even had the date we started to date in my calendar and I should have cause on the day he put it in his. 

I genuinely didn’t know anniversary’s were monthly, I always thought an answer would be in a year so the day wasn’t on my mind. I tried to tell him that I did remember the date we started dating but he didn’t believe. 

-Another situation where he got upset with me is where one night with him I wanted to stay in because of my cramps. He was totally fine with it, he also kept mentioning there was a car event going on but not in a direct way, just speaking of it. I was with him the night before and I remembered him mentioning it. The next day I’m otp with him and he brings up the car meet again talking about how we missed it. I didn’t say anything at first but I was thinking like geez he must really wanted to go. He brings it up again and I just say “I would have went with you.” Me saying it cause I feel bad that we didn’t go cause I wanted to stay in cause of my cramps.

He goes silent for a little bit then he tells me what I said didn’t sit right with him. Obviously I’m confused, but he then said “Oh you want to stay in when it comes to spend time with your man but now you’re saying you’d go if it’s car related.” He then continued to say that I’m probably with him just for the car stuff. (hard for me to fully recall) but I tried to tell him that I said that cause I feel bad since he kept bringing it up. I don’t know why he said that cause we’ve spend time together all the time that’s not car related. (we’re both car enthusiasts) Even two nights ago when he first mentioned it we sat in his car for hours talking.

After that day I thought to myself that it felt like it was like a test, he was like waiting for me to say something that didn’t feel right to him and come up with that assumption he was already possibly thinking about. I just started to feel like I had to walk on eggshells with anything I say or do.

-Another situation where he got upset cause I didn’t stand up for him. He takes me to this sushi spot we’ve been to one other time. It’s about to close but they were nice enough to let us sit and get something small. The waitress is nice she gave us a free small slice cheese cake after we’re done. Boyfriend gives her the check and she comes back and mentions why he doesn’t tip her while she has a smile. She then mentions that she remembers that he didn’t tip last time. Apparently he doesn’t tip I’m finding out, I’m looking at him and he looks at the waitress and he comes up with some reason I can’t remember.
 
We’re walking back to the car and he’s clearly upset as we’re talking about the situation. We get in the car and he’s just silent, I’m also silent in my head I’m trying to figure out what to say. I asked him if he was okay and he responded with something short along of lines of not really can’t remember. Then silence again…at this point I’m internally trying to figure out what to do or say and what it if I say the wrong thing. 30 minutes go by and he began to drive, he tells me first he didn’t like how I was silent and secondly he doesn’t like how I let the waitress talk to him like that when she mentioned the no tip. He says I don’t stand up for my man, I could have told her to “chill out”, I’m too quiet, I didn’t comfort him etc. Yes I was silent the entire time, I tried to tell him I didn’t know what to say and I didn’t mean to stay quiet. In my head I was going over things I could say but also thinking if I’d say the wrong thing.

—Another. Fast forward, right now he’s upset with me cause recently he says I’m not nurturing, he says “females should already know how to be nurturing.” And him as a man he shouldn’t have to teach me it should be natural. He’s gotten upset with me once cause I couldn’t think off the top of my head of the different dishes I could cook for him fast enough. We don’t live together but he always talks about the future. He said he doesn’t know if I’m capable enough to take care of him and do woman things like feed him, make sure he’s mentally good, physically etc. He said he shouldn’t have to ask me to cook I should already want to for him. He said it could be a simple sandwich, I use to occasionally bring him food I made when I could afford the ingredients, I should of just asked him if we could just shop together. But I did stop for a while after I stopped working and I couldn’t really spend too much more. I live with my family and there always barley food in the house cause it’s always eaten so I’m limited on things I could make since he doesn’t eat meat and I’d go out and get the stuff. For that reason my boyfriend told me he’d start getting me snacks for us to both eat I can store in my room since he sleeps over almost everyday.

Recently he got off work and we were going to get some habachi but he stopped at the grocery store cause he remembered we ran out of a pack of waters. He got upset with me when I said “oh yeah.” when he mentioned the waters cause I’m not doing my role etc. In the store I noticed as I’m picking up certain things and asking him questions he is silent and he’s just shrug or say something short. Now I don’t know if he’s upset about something or what. Eventually and he got upset with me cause I was asking him about should we get instead of knowing what to get and take charge of that womanly stuff. He went on and said he can’t do everything my role is easy.

Same night he told me to remind him to order some break pads when we get back to my spot. I forgot, same night we’re in the room and he’s like “awe babe you forgot to tell me to order the pads.” Then the next day he brings that up when he got upset. 

So we’re at cars and coffee, walking around as we’re walking to into Coffee shop he’s like he’s gonna grab himself something to eat after. We’re in line and I’m looking at the pastries I see banana bread, he likes banana stuff. I ask him if he wants anything even though he never wants anything out of that place and he shrugs and like get whatever. I get a drink and get him the banana bread. He pays and we sit down. He’s like “did they get it from behind the glass?” I said “yeah.” He takes a little piece and tastes it then throws the rest out. He tells me why would I get him something that’s been sitting out, I should have higher standards like he does for me. I try to mention the pastries are made fresh everyday but he continued. He tells me just because I’m use to it doesn’t make it good or something like that.

—Now this is about the title—, the same night he got upset about I’m asking him for more and I’m not doing enough. This started him saying how things are going to be when I start my vet assistant job. Just said I’d be the same, but he was talking about finances. He always didn’t like when I paid for stuff when I’m with him, he’s adamant about being the provider. I still do it out of guilt sometimes if I think it’s much. But I tell him he’d pay for stuff if we’re together and going out to eat. And he mentioned who would pay to get my hair done…I always paid for my hair since it’s like 200$ I tell him I pay by default but like idk if we’re together I wouldn’t mind if you payed of offered since he doesn’t like when I pay for things in front of him. He then mentions that he said he was hungry earlier while he was getting off work. And since I didn’t say anything he said I wasn’t going to make him anything. I just got sidetracked with the job conversation, I tell him I was going to make something. We were at the grocery store yesterday and got several things for me to make for him after he got off work so why would I not? Then he loops back to me saying I would mind about him paying for hair and says I’m asking for more and all I do is take from him.

Then he’s continue to talk about how he’s sick of talking to me about these things, I should already be doing it, I’m not naturally nurturing, he’s on his own by the end of the day, asking me what is up with me, saying he can’t have a woman that fidgets with her fingers etc. He then goes on to telling me he feels like I’m bullshitting or wasting time and he should just leave, he can easily just leave cause he’s use to being on his own and us females always take stuff for granted. He comes to the house and tells me to bring out his clothes so he can go I tell him his stuff is in the washer, he’s getting mad at me cause I keep getting stuck with my words again. 

I go outside and he’s still talking about how I’m taking him for granted and “y’all females” be messing up relationships etc. Atp I’m just getting overwhelmed he hates when I breakdown or cry when he does this cause “it’s nothing to cry about.” I say how I’ve been trying to work on myself so I can be better for him and the relationship. He tells me I need to work on myself so I began to stutter and tear up as I’m trying not to cry, he gets more upset that I’m crying I tell him that I found a psychiatrist so I can get some clarity for my long struggles. And he says he thinks I’m lying cause I’m taking so long to spit it out. He then asked what’s the doctors name cause he thinks I’m lying. 

Once I mentioned I have a prescription (bupropion 75mg) he tells me in victimizing myself. And us girls always victimizes ourselves and we think being depressed is cute. He said why didn’t I tell him and I was being sneaky for not telling that I’m taking prescriptions. I just got the prescription a few days ago, I was going to tell him but I kept putting it off because he told me he said wouldn’t and wasn’t going to date to girl with mental issues in a previous time he was upset. I tell him cause what he said but he said that’s not an excuse and I knew what I was doing. He tells me I should have came to him first and I don’t need no meds, telling me that “adhd, aderall and antidepressants are white people shit.”

He then said I’m going to go die, I’m going to go back in my room and overdose cause of my depression and potential breakup. I kinda chuckled in the middle of crying in disbelief in what he said. He tells me he’s real he’s going to say what’s real, he said I’m going to be dependent on the meds and keep taking them until I kill myself. Telling me he’s not dealing with me if I change moods cause of meds. I mainly went there for my attention deficit I just want to try and start school again without hard struggles on simple task no matter what method I use. I tell him I thought that that’s what me working on myself was. I wanted to finally get help for my mental. Then he yells at me saying why would I go somewhere else to get help when he’s right there, that’s like him wanting p*ssy and going to a different girl.

After that I don’t know what to say, I’m telling him I should have told him before I went to go to the psychiatrist. He tells me I’m sneaky and he can’t trust or marry a woman like that. I go silent for a bit and he yells “Speak!” I freeze up a little and I began to try and talk about it more, he says I’m too timid and quiet it’s not grown woman like, he said it’s like he’s talking to a kid. I say I don’t have to take the meds and canceled my appointment. 

I’m just lost right now, I know I’m faulty in a lot of things but I feel like I always have to over analyze to make sure I do the right thing at the moment 

Just now I’ve been trying to tell him my side and how the things he did made me always feel like I have to walk on eggshells but it’s like he has every counter to what I’m expressing.
Recently I’ve told him I went to the psychiatrist to find out why I struggle to speak sometimes, being forgetful, hard for me to quickly understand things. But he said I shouldn’t have gone and gotten meds when I knew he doesn’t mess with it. He said I took that situation and went to go do it like I was single. Now he’s says I neglect him and he doesn’t want to be like his father and go out and find a better woman. 

He’s telling me I need to help him, help him figure out if our relationship can basically continue with it’s currently standing. I’m devaluing myself by doing what I did, not telling him that I was planning to go to the psychiatrist and what I did was sneaky and untrustworthy. He said I can’t have a bad experience on my end cause I got taken care of exactly how a woman is suppose to be treated, I have nothing bad on him. He said it’s not his first time going through this with a girl and the conversation is naturally inevitable. He says as soon as something happens in his life he’s expected to fix it and I need to help him too. Then I’m kinda fed up, He said I’m bad mouthing cause I brought up maybe we should have waited a little longer before we started dating because it was close to his last break up and he probably would of saw who I was a little longer. He said now I made myself comparable and I shouldn’t have brought it up. He says I need to step up like he does and tells me that it’s not easy, tells me I need to figure out a solution and plan and balance the relationship out cause the things I’m lacking In to take care of him like he takes care of me. He says I fucked it up for us and did went to go do it with knowledge that it would destroy us and I need to say that I was wrong about going to get the psychiatrist without saying anything.

He said most of our relationship is off of him saying something, and if I don’t do my part and we’re still able to carry on but if he stopped doing his part the relationship wouldn’t carry on. 

Maybe I’m not good enough at this moment since most of our conversations is about what I need to do. Then he said I made myself the problem of the relationship. He said he’s not the problem that led us to where we are, he’s not the one with Trauma. While I’m trying to get better he said how am I going to make sure he’s good? I had my issues and he already tried to work with it and I let the clock tick. The issue was I keep giving him bare minimum and I had months to fix it. He said I’m on my period so we can’t spend time and make love just only eat and spend time and he can’t use his pent up anger to “fck the shit out of me.” And I still got to take care of him while I try to take care of myself.

\[SFX: Door opening\]

Oh! I uh didn't expect to see you here. I...Uh

...

\[Rushed\] Well ye-yeah yeah I know you live here especially right across me, and that you normally come home at this time. But you could've easily had something else to do...Like uhh Grocery shopping?

...

I see. Uh Well, how was work? Are your coworkers still getting on your nerves?

...

Well, that's good...Maybe a change of heart? Deciding not to mess with you (Awkward Laugh)

QUICK PAUSE

\[Panicked\] Oh, I'm sorry for babbling too much. Look at me taking all your time like you didn't just get off work. You're probably so tired and want to rest. I won't keep you anymore.

...

\[Defeated\] Yeah, Talk to you later!

\[SFX: Keys Jingling\]

*Oh, Come on! Is that as far as you'll go? Ask them about the weather next time...that'll sure get them to fall for you! Stupid...Whyyy can't I just-*

...

Yeah, I'm fine, wh- Ummm Actually Do you want to come over later?...I mean the last time we even hung out \[Quietly\] If you could even call it that- Was at the apartment get-together after all those new tenants moved in. I uhhh was thinking we could watch a movie maybe pop some popcorn or-

...

No, It's fine if you can't-Wait really!?! Oop- I mean \[Fake Chill\]cool cool. I'll let you go now.

...

Oh Yeah, almost forgot. How about at 8-9ish o'clock?

...

Perfect! I will now let you go (Laugh) See you later!

\[SFX: Door Shut\]

\[Whisper\] Yes, yes, yes! I can't believe they agreed! My gosh, Am I really going to do it today? Maybe we could just hang out, and then next time, I'll confess for sure. No, no, no it has to be today. Every time I see them, I feel like pouncing and keeping them in my house—but I need to do this right! I just hope it goes well. If it doesn't, I don't know what I'll do…

\[SFX: Door Open\]

Ah! Did you forget something? (Weak Laugh)

...

No, I'm good! I was...just taking out some trash! I'm heading back inside now, See you later!

\[SFX: Door slamming shut\]

Shit Shit shit...Did they hear all that? I really hope not...Today needs to be perfect! Or else they'll never accept me...Ooo I should really pick some us this up. Why do I do this to myself? From now on after you're done using something, For the love of everything put it back, please!

PAUSE

Wait I don't even have popcorn...Seriously why am I like this? Let me check what I have in the pantry.

\[SFX: Wrapper crinkling/Package shuffling\]

There has to be something to eat...Aghhh Why did I become an Ingredient only household? Ah Here's something. It'll have to do for right now, I have so many other things to do. Like set up some blankets and Pillows...Maybe take down that wall of pictures of them...I don't want to scare them before I even get the chance to confess. Even if there's no chance of them going into the bedroom I'd rather be safe than sorry.

|TIME PASS|

\[SFX: Knocking\]

Shoot what time is it? There's no way it's 8 o'clock already...Of course it's not and of course they are here early...(Giggle) They always make sure they're early for anything, It's one of the reasons I like them. It won't go wrong...will it?

\[SFX: Door opening\]

Hi! You're early, I hope you got some rest before coming over! I wouldn't want to be the reason you didn't get to...

...

Well, then okay! Please come in!

\[SFX: Footsteps\]

I picked out a few movies that I thought you'd be interested in, I put them on the coffee table so you can choose the one we watch. And I see that you put on some PJs...\[Trying to hold back\] They're...cute! *Just like you my gosh. Look at them! I never thought I would see them in their comfy clothes. What I'd do to cuddle them right now-*

...

Yeah, I'm good! I was thinking I should go put on some Pjs too. That way we'd both be comfortable while watching the movie! I'll be back.

\[SFX: Footsteps that fade\]

*Calm down heart geez...How old are you...this isn't something you haven't done before! It's just watching a movie...with my crush...Who I just happen to be confessing to...tonight...No big deal. I got this! Yeah yeah, I got this! We'll watch the movie then I'll do it!*

Now what PJs should I put on?... These are cute but a little too risky for my liking...These are old so definitely not. Hmm Ok, this one seems promising. These ruffles are so cute and the soft pink! \[Desperate\] I don't think they'll be able to handle themselves and will for sure accept me. I hope.

\[SFX: Clothes rustling\]

Now let's get back. I'm sure they picked a movie already.

\[SFX: Footsteps\]

I'm back!

...

Oh good you picked one. I don't think I've ever watched that one...I don't recognize the DVD cover.

...

(Nervous Giggle) You could say I'm a bit old-fashioned. I grew up with older parents. No Internet in the house and no game consoles. We only had one TV and it looked like a box. (Laugh) I guess it kind of stuck with me even after I moved out. So the DVD player it is!

...

Yeah yeah whatever, here I'll put it in.

\[SFX: DVD Player sounds? If you can find one\]

Oh, I forgot to tell you. I actually did not have any popcorn but I did find this.

...

\[Nervous\] It's...your favourite? Wow, what a coincidence...I guess it's good I didn't have popcorn hmm? Here you go. Let me sit down uhh right next...to you.

...

|Fade out| Yeah, You can have the remote.

|TIME PASS|

(Laughing) I can't believe you chose that! It was awful, probably one of the worst I've seen.

...

Ok ok, Touché. I WAS the one who bought it-

... a-and the one that picked it for you to choose from.

...

(Nervous Giggle) Yeah, I'm sure you are a great chooser...Which is hopefully why you'll maybe choose me?

QUICK PAUSE

\[Rushed\] Before you say anything, I want you to know that I tried to ignore it but I just...couldn't. Once I saw you move in...I just couldn't get you out of my mind. Every single time I closed my eyes your face was there. No matter where I was, even if you had your back turned I would recognize you in a heartbeat. It was such a blessing you moved into the apartment across from me...I won't lie though, it was a little hard not to go to your door every hour just to hear your voice...But it was fine because we'd bump into each other almost every day.

PAUSE

Until we didn't. Like I said I haven't seen you since the Apartment get-together. But to be honest...that's a little lie. You haven't seen me but I've always been around. I couldn't help it I'm sorry but-

...

\[Dazed\]What am I trying to say...?

QUICK PAUSE

\[Desperate and a little crazed\] I like you! Gosh, I like you so much I can't handle it. Every time I'm near you my heart races out of control. It's been a while since I felt like this especially since I was at that...place. I just-

QUICK PAUSE

Wait did I scare you? I didn't mean to- I just couldn't keep it to myself anymore...so what do you say...?

...

\[A little defeated\] I understand, I did come on a bit too strong-

...

\[Excited/Hopeful\] Really!? E-even after everything I just said? You're really willing to give it a chance? Oh gosh, I don't think that helped my heart one bit, It feels like my heart is going to jump out. Here feel it...

...

\[Breathy\] ...I guess you can't ever say I don't like you(Weak Laugh)

...

Can I hug you? Of course, It's fine if not, just need some contact or I'll feel like I'll explode into fireworks (Laugh)

Atop stacked rolls of bulbous fat,

a squat sloth slouching

Nyarlathotep hath prepared

Seething to his belabored breathing
his hundred foot-stumps

1glx7t1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1glx7t1/shadow_of_the_hidden_by_kev_harrison_book_review/,SHADOW OF THE HIDDEN by Kev Harrison - Book Review,"*Shadow of the Hidden* caught my eye in an instant for several exciting reasons – a short yet engaging read filled with supernatural/horror elements plotted around an adventure/mystery while also being infused with some drool-inducing F&B stuff… Well, WOW! Sounds super exciting and intriguing, doesn’t it?! Let me tell you very honestly right now – it’s even better than it actually sounds! Hence, I would like to extend my gratitude towards the author, the publisher – Brigids Gate Press, and NetGalley for providing me with a digital advanced reader copy.

 

**What’s it about?**

Sebastian “Seb” Mackie has been in Anatolia, Turkey for the past few months pertaining to his work based on archaeology. Life has been going pretty well away from his home in London, thanks to his landlord and firm friend, Oz. But that’s when things start taking a turn… a really, really bad turn indeed. When Oz’s calm and humorous personality is suddenly shattered by a series of “unnatural” incidents, Seb must prolong his stay to try and help out in any way possible.

Oz firmly believes that he has been “cursed”, and that an evil spirit is now hell-bent upon him and everyone that he cares for. Seb doesn’t really believe in such things, and isn’t convinced of his friend’s assumptions… at first, that is. Surely there can be no explanation to what’s going on in his friend’s life at the moment… at least no “natural” way of putting it. Is the “curse” real in any way, shape, or form? Is there really something evil behind such strange happenings?

*“… there are things in this world we don’t understand, and I pray to whatever good there is among those things, that you never live to see what I did today.” Ibrahim stood and stretched. “What I’m saying is, neither of us believe. Not really. But you said yourself, something is going on. Keep your eyes open and pray that whatever it is doesn’t come for you.”*

What starts off as a set of “superstitious” beliefs and happenings in Turkey, soon pan out in an adventure horror/thriller ranging from Tunisia’s Kairouan – “the holy city in hell”, to Egypt’s Al Maqbara – the necropolis. There is help for the duo in the form of professor Deniz Yilmaz and Dr. Ibrahim Gharbi. But will that prove enough? There are lives at stake… dangers aplenty… the “supernatural” seemingly all around – djinns, ghuls, spirits; you name it… and ultimately a desperate race against time for everyone involved.

 

**The good**

●       HOLY WOWZERS! This was an absolutely amazing read in every possible way! I was definitely surprised at how good it was, and equally enthralled until the very last page.

●       Set in pretty much the present times (with mobiles, laptops, Uber, etc.), the story was engaging, intriguing, and super fun throughout. I was literally glued from the word go!

●       The writing was just superb; written in the first person POV of Seb (while also being narrated by the MC himself). The incorporation of the Turkish and other regional languages present was well done too.

●       The characters were very well written, very much relatable, and enjoyable to read. The chemistry between them was great to read.

●       There were multiple F&B references present, and I most certainly had a strong craving for them all, be it the Turkish coffee, tea, or the baklava!

●       The ending, in my honest opinion, was really well done. I really hope that there’s a sequel asap (cuz it all sets up so nicely!).

 

**The “not so” good**

Believe me, but I have literally no complaints whatsoever. It delivers what it promises, and even then some! If there’s any real complaint from my side, it would be that it was over way too soon… and that there wasn’t a sequel already in the waiting!

 

**Highlights**

●       I’ll just leave this exchange right here:

 

“What do you know about djinn?”

“Wishes, lamps. Disney’s *Aladdin*, basically.” I chuckled.

“There *are* stories like that one. Others where they are simple tricksters, making fun with children, or hiding things. But there are others.”

“Others ...?” I raised an eyebrow theatrically.

He leaned across the table and whispered. “Some of them are like your demons. Wicked. *Dangerous*.”

 

**Other info.**

●       There were a couple of b/w drawings/illustrations present which was great.

●       There were also multiple references/Easter eggs present throughout that I enjoyed coming across… one such is even present in the dialogue highlighted above! (I was thinking of maybe spoiling the rest here, but nope… go have a look for yourselves!).

●       What was even exciting to see was the ‘afterword’, which hints at a sequel! Honestly, I can't wait for it!

●       ***Note:*** Mature themes are present (profanity, graphic depictions, blood/gore, etc.). Not suitable for younger audiences.

 

**Final thoughts**

*Shadow of the Hidden* by Kev Harrison (has got a nice ring to it as well, no?) is an exceptional read from start to finish. A relatively short read that’s fast-paced, has well written and relatable characters, an exciting and equally intriguing plot, an adventure thriller with a solid dose of the supernatural/horror elements, and topped-up with a nice dash of F&B stuff. TRUST ME, YOU DO NOT WANT TO MISS OUT ON IT WHATSOEVER! I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, but here’s how I would well and truly describe it:

***“Reads like a Dan Brown-esque adventure thriller… but with a healthy dose of the supernatural!”***

If you haven’t figured it out already by now, I would STRONGLY RECOMMEND that you check it out ASAP!

July 24, 2008. It’s been years. I’m 90 years old, but it still haunts me to this day. After 30 or, I don’t know, 50 years, the cabin accident. The monster still haunts me, but I see him.

I was exploring the mountains of Greece, lost in the snow. The storm came too fast, and I was freezing to death. Then I saw it—the cabin, barely visible through the blizzard. I stumbled inside, too exhausted to care about what might be lurking there.

The air was thick, heavy with something ancient. As I moved closer to the fire pit, I saw it. In the far corner of the room stood a creature—tall, skeletal, with eyes glowing like coals. Its skin was gray, stretched tight over its bones. It didn’t have a face, just a mass of shadows.

I froze, my heart pounding. It began to move toward me, its limbs creaking like branches in the wind. I couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe. It was pulling me in, as if it was meant to take me.

Then the sunlight broke through the cabin’s window, and the creature recoiled. The light seemed to burn it, warping its form. It hissed and disappeared into the shadows, like smoke fading with the dawn.

I ran. I don’t even remember how, but I ran—out of the cabin, through the snow, straight to a small convenience store in a nearby village. I slammed the door behind me, my chest heaving. I don’t know how I survived that night, but I’ll never forget what I saw.

The monster is still out there, waiting for the next person to wander into its trap.

After I got in the convenience store, I slammed the door behind me, my breath coming in short gasps. The small shop smelled like old wood and stale coffee. The man behind the counter looked up from his magazine. He paused, his eyes scanning me, and then he asked, ""Are you okay?""

For a second, I thought he might think I was a drug addict, the way I must’ve looked—wild-eyed, shaking, covered in snow. But I didn’t care. I was still shaking from what I had seen, the image of that monster burned into my mind.

""I... I just came from the cabin,"" I said, my voice hoarse. ""There’s something there, something terrible.""

The man raised an eyebrow, as if he didn’t believe me, but I could see the hesitation in his eyes. So, I told him everything. The storm, the cold, the cabin in the distance. The shopkeeper’s warning. And then, when I finally stepped inside, how I saw it—the creature in the corner of the room, the way it moved toward me, its eyes glowing, its presence choking the air around me. I told him about the light breaking through the window and how the monster had disappeared. I left out nothing.

By the time I finished, the man was silent. He stood still, his face pale. His hands trembled slightly as he reached for the counter. For a moment, I thought he might dismiss me as insane. But then he spoke, his voice low, almost a whisper.

""You’re not the first to see it,"" he said, his gaze distant. ""People disappear around that cabin, year after year. They... they say it’s not just a monster. It’s something older, something that feeds off the darkness.""

His words hit me like a wave, and I knew he wasn’t just humoring me. He was scared, like he’d seen it too—like he knew the truth.

And in that moment, I realized something terrifying: the creature wasn’t just something that lived in the cabin. It was part of the mountain, part of the land. And no matter how many years passed, it would always be waiting, lurking in the shadows, ready to claim anyone foolish enough to wander too close.

The man stared at me, and for the first time since I stepped into the store, I felt like I wasn’t alone. But I also knew one thing: I had to leave the mountain. And I had to do it before it found me again.

I don’t know what to do. The light doesn’t help anymore. The city’s noise doesn’t drown it out. It’s getting closer. And the worst part? I think it’s been following me all these years.

I have done everything. I went to psychologists, hoping they could help me make sense of it, to help me forget. I take Xanax to relax, anything I can to calm the relentless fear. I’ve tried every treatment, every medication—P.O.S., whatever they told me would work. But it doesn’t work anymore.

Even dementia, I thought, would erase this memory. I prayed for it, hoped for it. But no, dementia has erased everything. The faces, the names, the years, the moments. It’s taken so much. But it hasn’t taken that night. It hasn’t taken him.

I remember the cabin. I remember the creature. I remember its eyes, its breath. I remember the cold, the dark, the silence. And I don’t know who I am anymore. I’ve forgotten everything else—except that.

I wake up in the middle of the night, gasping for air, and I know. I know he’s still out there, somewhere. I hear the scratching at the walls, the whispers in the corners of my mind. But most of all, I know—he knows where I am. And this time, there won’t be a light to save me.",6,1731003711.0,Ruleshorror,2,1.0,False

I put 2-3 teaspoons of coffee and 6 teaspoons of sugar, and follow the rest of the recipe (hot water, whip, ice and milk). To be honest, most of the coffee is milk and ice by volume (I like coffee, but i like it with lot of milk). I don't drink this all in one go, usually lasts 1-2 hours (the ice doesn't melt too fast idk why). Is this very bad? My parents tell me it's not good at all, but considering I don't eat too much sugar in the rest of the day (I eat like 1-2 meals a day, whenever I'm hungry), I doubt if it's as bad as my parents say.

I'd like to share my ""Reading"" with you guys. It's also an excuse to rec. some good music.","I shuffled my Liked Songs playlist of 3400 songs, and used the first 3 as ""messages from the universe."" I'm not a superstitious person, I just thought this was fun, so I'm winging it, lol. Here goes.

[Doom Side of the Moon - Time](https://youtu.be/DfIKSe3qTtI?si=nRNgaTtzQFGo6h1Q)

Pink Floyd cover, but doom metal! 

The opening lines were apt to my situation.

""Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day

You fritter and waste the hours in an off-hand way

Kicking around on a piece of ground in 
your home town

Waiting for someone or something to show you the way""

I'm turning 31 in a couple weeks. I still live at home, and it seems being able to move out keeps getting farther and farther out of reach. I want to leave, not just the town, but the state, or even the country, but the money just isn't there, and it probably won't be.

[Choke Up - Dry Out](https://youtu.be/R7lV9A3JyoA?si=9Hc1sJBBBxIiU0hV)

Fantastic punk rock band from Boston. But this song is different from their norm. It's a beautiful acoustic song with slide guitar and strings. Again, the opening lines are what I'm focusing on.

""A bleary­-eyed morning rolls in like a storm. I'm awake but I'm not getting up. 

Oh, I don't think I have the stamina. 

I put my faith in sunglasses, black coffee, bad habits, and I pray every day for new distractions.

Oh, please, divert my attention""

Real apathetic reading I have today, lol. It does kinda describe how I've felt the last couple of days, given recent events.

[Gin Wigmore - Man Like That](https://youtu.be/is6AFxPkTAA?si=j_LtAzK2fYg3A0BP)

She's basically a New Zealand Amy Winehouse. Her whole Gravel and Wine album is full of bangers like this!

This one made me laugh at the relevance to the country as a whole. Here's the chorus:

""(Ooh, ooh) girl, you better wake up

(Ooh, ooh) girl, you better run

(He's gone) first thing in the morning
Faster than a bullet coming out of that gun

(Ooh, ooh) tells you that he loves you

(Ooh, ooh) then he take it all back

Girl, you gotta wonder, Girl, you gotta wonder, Girl, you gotta wonder 

'bout a man like that

Girl, you gotta wonder, Girl, you gotta wonder, Girl, you gotta wonder 

'bout a man like that""

***

This was really fun to write out! It was rather therapeutic as well.

Ever since I started watching Achievement Hunter in like 2012, I've always found that Geoff and I have similar taste in things. Games, music, clothes, hobbies. Having this podcast to just relax and listen to him talk about some rad shit is a life saver.

Thank you, Geoff, and I hope you all stay safe out there! Let me know if you want me to do this again!",3,1731003301.0,SoAlrightPod,0,1.0,False

Didn't think about how there isn't a quick way to remove the plants when I wanted to go back to something like star fruit.

1glwyoj,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1glwyoj/tifu_responding_to_a_facebook_post_regarding/,TIFU responding to a Facebook post regarding election night before I'd had my morning coffee.,"Needless to say I'm a democrat who did not vote from Trump so after waking up early Wednesday morning to find out who won the presidential election I saw my sister-in-law had posted that night talking about being tearful and anxious about the outcome. Since I'd just woken up I commented ""Fuuuucccckkkkkk!"" and left it at that. Later that morning I get a text from my brother asking me to delete my comment so my niece (his oldest) wouldn't see it. She has Asperger's and one of her triggers is curse words which I'm well aware of but hadn't considered that maybe my niece would see what her mom had posted with my response. So no problem, I go on Facebook to delete my comment and see that I had not in fact commented on my sister-in-law's post but on niece's. My sister-in-law and niece have first names that share three of the same letters so in my ""just woke up, hadn't had my coffee yet, and dumbstruck state"" misread the names. Needless to say I deleted my comment immediately. Hopefully she never saw my comment and has since deleted her post entirely. She's recently turned 19 so this was her first voting in a presidential election. Hope I haven't given her a new trigger regarding voting.
TLDR: Posted a comment on my autistic niece's Facebook, possibly triggering her when she was already freaking out.",133,1731003093.0,tifu,46,0.68,False
