The only thing I can think of, which might have caused this, was a strong coffee I had yesterday morning. 

I’m generally very stable on medications. My family, doctors (psychiatrist and GP) and my care coordinator (social worker) are all delighted with my progress and personal development. 

I suppose I’m here because of the fear of losing that progress. 

I don’t feel sped up, ecstatic, grandiose, etc. I still feel like my normal self but perhaps a lot more restless. 

Could it be a one off caused by the strong coffee I had yesterday morning? Or, could it be breakthrough symptoms of mania?

This is your room with Jane."" A woman's soft, teasing voice floated from the master bedroom of the suite next door.","# Chapter 1 First Night

""Colin, stop... please. This is your room with Jane."" A woman's soft, teasing voice floated from the master bedroom of the suite next door.

At this sound, Jane Ritter's eyes flew open, and she sat up abruptly. Her wedding to Colin Drake was tomorrow. She'd come to decorate their home despite her high fever, but she passed out soon later.

She wondered, 'Am I hallucinating? I think I must have heard Lydia's voice... Why?'

""What if Jane finds out about us?"" The gentle voice broke the silence again, and Jane's heart sank. She couldn't have mistaken it—that was Lydia Ritter, her half-sister. She just didn't get what Lydia was doing with Colin in the next room.

On shaky legs, Jane staggered to the door and pushed it open, making her way to the master bedroom.

This was supposed to be her and Colin's space. She had come here today to prepare it for their wedding night, arranging a few personal touches to make it feel special.

""So what? You're so much better than that shameless Jane. What right does she have to question you?"" Colin's cold voice cut through the air.

Jane's hand froze on the doorknob. She thought, 'Colin... it's really him inside? He actually thinks of me like that?'

Lydia continued, ""Colin, I had no idea you felt that way about me. It's such a shame you're marrying Jane tomorrow. Poor you—Jane is so desperate. Everyone in Jovinia knows she threw herself at professors and judges last year just to win that award.""

Colin sneered, ""Don't worry about it. The wedding is off. Jane isn't good enough to marry me. I've already told your father—I won't marry a woman like her. Tomorrow, Jane will just be a fool who got left at the altar.""

Jane's spirits plummeted. Her eyes widened in disbelief as the words struck her like a punch to the gut. This was Colin, her boyfriend for years. He had always promised to trust her, to stand by her no matter what.

But now, he was choosing to believe the rumors—that she had slept with professors and judges to win a jewelry design award. And now he even messed with Lydia in their bedroom.

A wave of anger and hurt surged through Jane. She wanted to storm in and confront Colin, to demand answers.

But as she took a step, her legs gave way, and she nearly collapsed. Her head spun, the fever making her feel weak and dizzy.

But she couldn't let them see her like this. She forced herself to take a deep breath and stumbled out of the room.

The elevator doors closed behind her with a gentle, polished swoosh, and suddenly, she felt her resolve crumble. She sank to the floor, tears slipping silently down her cheeks.

After being framed and expelled from college, she had thought Colin was the only one who would still believe in her. But he had let her down. She didn't understand—if he didn't trust her, why had he given her hope in the first place?

The elevator dinged softly. Jane was still sitting on the marble floor, her hair a mess, eyes red and tear-streaked. Only her slender lower leg, peeking out from under her skirt, looked untouched—smooth and perfectly shaped.

""Who are you?"" The voice was deep and cool, with a hint of impatience, drifting in from outside the elevator.

Jane blinked, her mind foggy. She looked up and realized the elevator had reached the top floor. The doors were wide open, and there stood a tall man, wrapped in a dark robe.

His hair was damp and tousled, and his eyes were cold and piercing. The robe gaped slightly, revealing a chiseled frame that made her heart skip a beat. His face was sharp and handsome, with an unusual flush to his cheeks.

Jane took a deep breath. She remembered that this building, one of the most exclusive in the city, had only one apartment per floor. The higher the floor, the more prestigious the resident. Even Colin, with his wealthy background, could only afford a middle-floor unit.

And the elevators required a card key to operate, and each key was programmed to access only the owner's specific floor. So this man had to be the penthouse owner.

""I—"" she started.

But the man's brows twitched with irritation. His eyes flashed with anger. ""You didn't shower before you came,"" he said, more a statement than a question.

Before Jane could even respond, the man's fingers were already gripping her chin. He studied her as if she were some object he was evaluating.

""Ouch... that hurts..."" Jane's voice was barely a whisper, soft and breathy. She was startled by how delicate she sounded, as if she were someone else entirely.

But the soft sound seemed to please him. His grip eased just a little, and he tilted his head, taking in her flushed face. Her face, red from her cold, looked even more enticing without makeup, like a ripe, juicy peach.

""Just remember to take a shower next time. I like women who are clean,"" he said, his voice smooth and low. He bent down and lifted her into his arms.

Her hands instinctively clutched at his robe as she let out a scream. ""Sir, I'm not—"" she started, confusion washing over her.

Before she could finish, he silenced her with a hard kiss, pinching her chin again. Ignoring her protests, he carried her straight into the apartment.

She realized in an instant—he'd mistaken her for someone else. He thought she was the kind of woman who came to him willingly.

The door slammed shut behind her. Jane felt herself pushed against it by the man's firm grip. His cool, masculine scent, mingled with the raw energy, hit her all at once.

This was her first kiss. She'd been with Colin for so long, and they'd never crossed this line.

""Sir, please—"" Her voice was cut short.

The kiss was intense and forceful, and Jane, inexperienced, found herself unable to resist. Her legs felt weak, and she went limp, relying on his arms to hold her up.

""Remember, I don't like women talking too much at a time like this,"" he warned, gently but firmly slapping her hip.

Jane trembled, her whole small body shaking.

Jane looked up at him, her vision blurred by tears, but the dim light in the apartment made his face unclear.

She smelled faintly of tuberose—something sweet, with a touch of mystery. He held her waist firmly and murmured in a deep, rough voice, ""I love your scent. So sweet... Stay still.""

Jane went rigid, feeling his breath on her ear. She suddenly realized just how intense the man holding her was. His grip was unnaturally strong, and she couldn't break free. ""Sir... you don't seem right..."" she managed to whisper, her voice strained.

Before she could finish, her last piece of clothing was ripped off violently, leaving her exposed.

# Chapter 2 One Year Later

Suddenly, the man's eyes, tense with desire, flickered with a hint of suspicion. He frowned at Jane, wondering if she had been handpicked to get him out of this mess. ""You've never done this before?"" he murmured softly.

Jane shook her head, her sobs turning into choked cries as she buried her face in his shoulder, biting down to stifle the pain.

He gentled his hold on her waist, his expression softening. He pressed a soft kiss to her tear-streaked face, his voice soothing. ""Shh, it's okay. Remember, I'm your first. I'll take care of you.

\*\*\*\*\*

One year later, in Jovinia, the dim light of the Night Charm Club's private room cast long shadows. Don, a wealthy middle-aged man, his hair thinning and his belly straining against his shirt, leaned back with an air of self-importance.

He said, ""Marry me, and I'll give you a thousand bucks a month. But I'm not paying for someone who can't pull their weight. You're young—twenty-two. Plenty of time to give me an heir. If it doesn't work out the first time, we'll just keep trying. ""

He paused, his gaze turning cold as he looked at Jane. ""I know you've been with Colin, but I'm okay with that. As long as you're a good, obedient housewife, I won't mind your past.""

Jane sat across from him, instinctively pulling back as his spittle flew with each word. She frowned, puzzled why her Lily had sent her to this club, to meet a man old enough to be her father.

She wouldn't have come if it weren't for her mother's medical bills—a weapon Lily had used to manipulate her.

""So, sweetheart,"" Don said, his tone suddenly stern, ""got any questions about me? Or demands?""

Jane hadn't even been listening. She blinked and shook her head. ""No.""

Don's stern expression softened into a patronizing smile. ""Figured as much. Marrying a guy like me is more than you deserve. A girl with a reputation like yours—who else would want you? Only someone like me would take you in.

""Come on, tell me. Besides Colin last year, who else have you been with? Spill it."" As he spoke, Don edged closer to Jane, his movements unnervingly suggestive, while she remained preoccupied.

As Don mentioned last year, a tall, indistinct figure with vague features involuntarily surfaced in Jane's mind.

A year ago, in that apartment, she'd caught Colin and Lydia cheating. But with a raging fever, she'd stumbled into the top-floor apartment and ended up with a guy she barely remembered. The next day, she left without even recalling his face clearly.

When her family saw her coming home disheveled, the scandal erupted. Her reputation was ruined. Yet Colin had played the victim, jetting off abroad with Lydia to live it up carefree.

""Nothing to tell. Don, I'm leaving,"" Jane said, grabbing her bag and standing up. She was disgusted by Don's closeness.

""Hey, who said you could leave?"" Don grabbed Jane from behind and forced her back onto the sofa. His breath was hot and reeking. ""I paid a fortune for this whole floor. You're not going anywhere without my say-so.""

""Let me go!"" Jane twisted away, using her bag to shield herself. ""If you don't let me go, I'm calling the police.""

She'd never imagined that agreeing to a blind date with her uncle and aunt would lead to meeting a man as repulsive as Don.

""Fine, call the cops,"" Don sneered. ""When they get here, they'll see how you're all over me. Your reputation in Jovinia is terrible—no one's gonna believe I spiked your drink.""

""What did you say?"" Jane's voice trembled.

Don grinned wickedly. ""Heh, feeling hot? Want me to help you out?""

As Don's face blurred before her eyes, Jane felt herself burning. She realized her coffee must have been spiked.

Seeing Jane's flushed face and glazed-over eyes, Don knew the drug was taking effect. He giggled, rubbing his hands together, and moved closer to her.

Suddenly, the lights flickered and then went out completely. In the pitch black, a tall, imposing figure silently leaped in from the balcony outside the private room.

""Who are you? Who sent you—"" Don's voice was cut short as the stranger swiftly knocked him out with a precise hand chop, then dragged him into the restroom.

Jane's mind was still racing, trying to make sense of what was happening, when she felt a large, cold hand clamp over her mouth. The air around him smelled of cold steel and something darker—blood. ""Don't make a sound if you want to stay safe,"" he growled.

Jane's body tensed. The man reeked of danger, and the scent of blood was almost overpowering.

Frantic footsteps approached the door. The man's eyes narrowed, and he pulled Jane closer, pressing her against him as he moved silently to the door.

Her heart was pounding so hard she could barely think. She felt dizzy and feverish, but there was something oddly familiar about the man holding her—like a shadow from a year ago, a memory she couldn't quite place.

Jane tried to pull away, but her body was weak from the drug. Instead, she found herself pressing closer to him, seeking some kind of refuge.

""Don, are you there? What's going on inside? Did anyone suspicious come by?"" a voice called from outside the door.

The man pinched her waist, and a soft moan escaped her lips.

The person outside, hearing the sound, assumed Don had succeeded.

""Damn it, he didn't come upstairs. Get more people down to search now. If he escapes tonight, we're all dead meat,"" someone shouted from outside.

The chaotic footsteps finally faded into the distance. Jane's tension eased. She instinctively tried to pull away from the man's embrace, but her legs gave out beneath her, and she slumped back into his arms.

""Feels... so good..."" Her chin brushed against the man's broad, solid chest, and she let out a soft, instinctive murmur. The air was filled with a faint, sweet scent that was uniquely hers.

""'Is that you?'"" the man, Luke Drake, bent down to steady Jane as she nearly collapsed. Her familiar scent—sweet and mysterious, with a hint of tuberose—filled his senses.

That night a year ago, as the haze of the drugs cleared, Jane had already vanished from the apartment. The drugs had scrambled his memory, and he couldn't recall her face at all. All he remembered was the faint, special scent on her, like the sweetness of tuberoses.

After a year of searching for her high and low, he had unexpectedly run into her at this club today. And now, she was burning up and acting strangely.

""What are you doing here?"" He lifted her gently, his voice deep and rough with emotion.

""Me? I'm here...um... for a blind date."" Jane's voice was soft and drowsy as she tilted her head to the side.

In the dim light, Luke's face seemed to blur into multiple images. She felt so hot and miserable, but his closeness felt so familiar and comforting.

The mention of a blind date made Luke's brows furrow. He had been searching for her for a year, and here she was, on a blind date.

Recalling what Don looked like, Luke narrowed his eyes coldly. He leaned down in the dark and kissed her, his voice rough. ""What a coincidence. You've saved me again.""

He cupped her chin, his fingers firm yet gentle. Then he kissed her, a storm of passion—fierce, unyielding, and tinged with a dangerous kind of desire.

Luke remembered that day, the day he'd promised to be there for her. But she had slipped away before the drugs faded. She'd made him break his word for the first time.

Anyway, she had saved him back then. And now, here she was again, surprising him in the most unexpected way.

There she was, nestled in his arms, her soft body instinctively pressing closer. She looked so innocent, so vulnerable. It was a sight that stirred something in Luke, something he'd never felt before.

He was known for keeping his distance, for avoiding the complications that came with getting close to anyone. But with her, everything felt different.

Jane was confused. She didn't know who Luke was or what he was talking about. Her heart pounded in her chest, and her body felt like it was on fire.

Part of her wanted to run, to escape the intensity of the moment. But another part of her wanted to stay, to lean into him, to feel his warmth just a little bit longer.

Before she could make up her mind, he bent down, lifting her effortlessly in his strong arms. The kiss deepened as he pressed her against the door, his body a solid, reassuring presence.

His fingers found her chin again, holding her gaze. His kisses were demanding, each one more intense than the last, leaving her breathless and dazed.

Jane felt her body go limp, her strength melting away. She responded instinctively, her reactions unfamiliar yet driven by a newfound desire. She surrendered to his dominant advances, feeling both vulnerable and alive.

""Please... no, we can't,"" she managed to whisper, her voice barely audible.

""We can do this. I'll take care of you, as I've promised,"" he murmured, his voice low and steady.

Her resistance melted under the weight of his kisses, each one more insistent than the last. When a wave of panic threatened to overwhelm her, she bit down on his shoulder, hard.

Time seemed to stand still as they remained entwined, each moment stretching into the next, like an eternity.

\*\*\*\*\*

It was three in the morning, and finally, it was over. Jane had fallen asleep, utterly exhausted. As the last traces of the drugs left her system, she nestled in Luke's arms, her face buried against his chest.

The way she clung to him, so trusting and endearing, made Luke's eyes narrow in a satisfied, almost possessive way.

A sliver of moonlight slipped through the window, landing on Jane's face, partially hidden by her dark hair. Then Luke realized he had never really seen her face clearly before.

Gently, he lifted his hand from her waist and reached to brush the hair away from her cheek.

# Chapter 3 My Boss Wants To See You

Suddenly, the phone jolted them both from the quiet. In the darkness, Luke frowned and pulled his hand back from Jane's face. He picked up the phone beside him. ""Hello.""

It was Harvey, his assistant. Harvey said, ""Mr. Drake, we're glad you're safe. We've got your location. There's an emergency in Dorvania. The car's waiting downstairs.""

Luke hung up and looked down at Jane, still fast asleep in his arms. He tried to lift her.

But she murmured, ""Uh... I'm so tired. Stop."" Her hand pushed weakly against his, and she buried herself deeper into the blanket, too sleepy to even open her eyes.

Seeing how exhausted she was, Luke slipped his obsidian ring onto her finger. ""Stay here and wait for me. Someone will come for you later.""

\*\*\*\*\*

A week later, at the Judd residence, the evening rain was pouring down in sheets. Jane pounded on the door, her fists thumping against the wood. The noise cut through the storm.

She shouted, ""Johnson, Lily, open up! You promised that if I went on that date at Night Charm, you'd take care of Mom. So why did the hospital say you cut off her medical support—and even want to pull the plug? You can't just do this!""

The door finally creaked open. Her aunt Lily stood there, her face dripping with irritation. ""Jane, still showing up here for money? How shameless!

""Check the news. Ever since you met Don last Friday, he's pulled all his investments from our company. Now he's ghosting us, not picking up our calls. You must've ticked him off during that date.

""Don't think so high of yourself. You're just a nobody. Don was doing you a favor. Sleeping with him wouldn't have killed you, so stop pretending to be so high and mighty.""

Jane's face drained of color. ""What? You told me to go on that date. You said you were worried about me being alone. You said I should marry a good man and make Mom feel better.

""But it was all a lie? Y-you never saw me as family. You just wanted to use me to get some investment for the company.""

Then it hit her. It wasn't just a coincidence. Johnson and Lily had known all along that Don was after her. It was obvious he wanted her. No wonder Lily had spoken so highly of him—that creepy, disgusting old man who could have been her father.

She kept replaying that night in her head. Don had spiked her coffee during the date. If she hadn't run into Luke, she'd never have made it out of there.

And yet, here she was, back with Luke. The one who'd promised to be there for her, twice now. But he was gone again, just like before. All that remained was a black obsidian ring. She didn't even know what he looked like.

It was only when she got home and saw herself in the mirror—love bites and kisses all over her skin—that she knew it hadn't been a dream.

Jane yelled, ""Lily, how can you do this to me? You know your plan led me to some guy at that club? And he—""

""Some guy? What guy?"" Lily's eyes narrowed, catching the slip. ""So you're a shameless tramp after all. Skipping out on Don to sleep with some random guy? No wonder Don hates us.

""We've done enough for you and your mom. Not a penny more for her medical bills. Get out of here, now!""

Lily turned and barked at Johnson, who was standing behind her, to throw out Jane's luggage.

Seconds later, a black plastic bag filled with a few clothes was flung at Jane. Lily sneered, ""Get out of here before my Ella gets home and sees you. She'll be furious.""

Jane's eyes blazed with fury. If it weren't for her mom Rose, lying in the hospital waiting for her to save her life, she would have fought Lily right there.

Jane picked up the bag, her face darkening. ""No, something's missing. Where's the Larmes Sacrées Éternelles my mom gave me? Why isn't it in here?""

The perfume Larmes Sacrées Éternelles was her mom Rose's favorite scent. When Rose was still wealthy, she had bought it at an auction abroad; it was the last bottle in the world.

Rose always loved it when Jane wore that scent, saying it suited Jane perfectly and brought back memories of Rose's own youth. Every time Jane visited Rose in the hospital, she would spray a little.

The last time Jane used it was a week ago, before going to the club. Since then, she hadn't been back to the Judd residence, let alone use it again.

""What Larmes Sacrées Éternelles? I don't know what you're talking about."" A flicker of guilt crossed Lily's face.

""Forget it. I'll go look for it myself,"" Jane said.

""Over my dead body,"" Lily shouted and pushed Jane away.

As they jostled, Lily caught a glint of something under Jane's collar. ""Hold on, you little sneak. What's that you've got around your neck?""

Lily's hand shot out like a flash, yanking the necklace right off Jane's neck and snapping it clean in two. A ring, studded with diamonds and set in obsidian, tumbled from the broken chain into Lily's grasp.

She sneered, ""Whoa, look what we have here. You've been hiding quite the treasure, haven't you?""

""No, give it back. It's mine,"" Jane cried. That ring was the only clue she had left from Luke. It was her lifeline to finding him.

""Get out of here. You and your mom owe us more than you'll ever repay. This ring is the payment. Try to take it, and you'll regret it."" Lily slapped Jane hard across the face, again and again, before shoving her out the door.

The iron gate slammed shut with a resounding bang, leaving Jane in the pouring rain. Neighbors peeked out their windows, snickering at her swollen face, at the girl who'd been kicked out like trash.

For a moment, Jane felt like she was drowning in despair. The man she'd thought would stand by her had vanished. The family she'd trusted had turned their backs on her. And her mom was still waiting for her help. She didn't know what she could do.

Then, out of nowhere, headlights blazed behind her. A sleek black Rolls-Royce pulled up beside her. A man stepped out. ""Ms. Jane Ritter? Our boss wants to see you.""

# Chapter 4 Get Married

Half an hour later, Jane was escorted to the penthouse of a luxury office tower in downtown.

It had been years since she'd been in such a high-end place. After her parents divorced, she and her mother had been kicked out of their home and had to rely on others for shelter.

Downstairs, she'd seen people dressed in sharp business suits, their faces cold and distant. It reminded her of Luke she'd encountered earlier, though his coldness had been sharper, more chilling.

Jane's thoughts drifted back to that night at the club a week ago. She remembered Luke, who had pressed her against the door. Her hands twisted nervously in her lap. She still had no idea who he was.

Suddenly, a shadow fell over her, blocking out the light. She looked up to see a pair of cold, piercing eyes.

Luke, the man standing before her, had sharp, chiseled features and an air of quiet menace. He was tall and broad-shouldered, and just his presence made her feel small and uneasy.

Jane's heart began to race. She felt an odd mix of fear and a strange sense of familiarity with Luke. It was as if she'd seen him somewhere before. But then, she wouldn't have forgotten someone like him.

""Ahem."" she began, straightening her posture. ""Sir, well, you want to see me?""

Jane looked at him earnestly. One cheek was still swollen from the earlier humiliation, but her eyes were clear and bright. In a way, she was grateful to him for pulling her out of that embarrassing situation with her neighbors.

Luke seemed surprised that she'd spoken first. His cold eyes narrowed just a bit, and his gaze lingered on her bruised face for a moment longer than necessary.

Then he spoke, his voice deep and smooth, but edged with a hint of menace, ""So, Ms. Ritter, are we pretending not to know each other now?""

Jane's heart skipped a beat. She didn't understand why he was saying this. She didn't remember a thing about him. She said, ""I think you have the wrong person, sir. I don't know you at all.""

He looked down at her, his cool eyes fixed on her puzzled face.

She was beautiful, even with the bruise. Her hair framed a delicate face, and her eyes sparkled with an innocent, wide-eyed look. For a moment, he thought he saw the woman from that night. But then he dismissed the idea. That was impossible.

Luke's expression darkened. He didn't bother with small talk, pulling out his phone and holding it out to her. ""You don't know me, but you were trying to cozy up to my grandfather. How much do you want to play Mrs. Drake for him?""

Jane was taken aback—how could someone so polished and aloof be so cruel? She felt a flash of anger. ""Sir, I don't think there's anything to discuss here. I'm leaving.""

Before she could stand, Luke's voice cut through the silence, colder than ice. ""Jane Ritter, 22, booted out of college a year ago for a mess of a personal life. Born into money but ended up caring for a cantankerous old man in a nursing home.

""Think I'm gonna buy that you got close to my grandpa without an angle?""

Realization hit Jane like a punch—he actually did his homework on her. Suddenly, it clicked for Jane, and she said, ""You're Dwight's grandson?""

""Finally catching on, are we?"" Luke dropped onto the couch across from her, legs crossed, fingers draped over the armrest, eyes dripping with disdain. ""So, is ten thousand a month enough to play Mrs. Perfect for my grandpa?""

Jane's mind reeled. 'Marry him? What planet is he on?' She said, ""Mr. Drake, I'm Dwight's caretaker, sure, and I know there's bad blood between you two, but I'm not using that to get to you—""

""Fifteen thousand a month,"" Luke cut in, his voice flat. ""That's my final offer. The Drake family has money to burn, but you? You're not worth a penny more.""

His words hit Jane like a slap. Her head buzzed, but she forced herself to speak, voice rough with emotion, ""Mr. Drake, I'm not interested in your beef with Dwight. I'm out of here.""

She couldn't stay another second. She grabbed her purse and made for the door.

""After we tie the knot, I'll throw in another 300 thousand,"" Luke went on, unfazed. ""When we split, you'll get an apartment, depending on how well you play along. And you'll still get your 15 thousand a month.""

Jane froze at the doorway. 300 thousand dollars was the exact amount her mom's surgery needed. With that money, she could get the operation scheduled right away—no more fear of her mom being taken off life support. It could save her mom's life.

She then thought again of the man who had promised to be there for her but vanished. A bitter smile crossed her face as she realized she should never have trusted someone like him.

""I'll marry you, and we'll even get the certificate now,"" Jane said, her eyes glistening as she turned back. ""But there's one condition: I need the money today. I have to have that cash in hand before the bank closes.""

\*\*\*\*\*

At the Judd residence, Johnson couldn't shake the guilt after kicking Jane out. He paced the living room, his mind heavy with regret.

""Would you stop pacing around like that? You're driving me crazy,"" Lily complained impatiently. ""I'm trying to take a look at this ring. Whoa, check these diamonds out. This thing must be worth a fortune. Jane is broke—where did she get it from?""

""Who knows?"" Johnson replied irritably. ""Maybe Rose gave it to her.""

""Hmph,"" Lily grumbled. ""Looks like Rose has been holding back some of her fancy stuff. I'm going to the hospital right now. Got to get her to cough up for those medical bills we've been paying.""

Just as she reached for the door, it swung open, and she nearly ran into her daughter. Ella, the Judd family's princess, stepped out of her sports car, her high heels clicking on the driveway. She was dressed head to toe in designer clothes.

Ella shouted, ""Dad, Mom, what are you doing out here? And where's Jane? I heard she was stirring up drama again.""

Lily's face softened at the sight of her daughter. She held up the obsidian ring she'd yanked off Jane's neck. ""No worries—Jane's long gone. Ella, look at this.""

""What is this?"" Ella's eyes widened in surprise.

""I took it off Jane,"" Lily said triumphantly. ""She's been living off us for so long. This ring more than covers her debts.""

""The ring looks so beautiful. Mom, I love it."" Ella's eyes sparkled with delight.

""Love it? Take it."" Lily handed it over without hesitation.

Ella took the ring, her face lighting up. She'd always known Jane had the best things. Like that one-of-a-kind perfume, Larmes Sacrées Éternelles. It was said that Rose had splurged on it years ago overseas. There was only one bottle in the entire city.

Ella had found it in Jane's room a few days ago, snatched it, and claimed it as her own. She'd already started using it.

Thinking of this, Ella felt a wave of relief wash over her. 'Thank goodness Rose was abandoned by the Ritter family, and Jane's kicked out as well. Otherwise, I would never have gotten my hands on such a great thing.'

Ella had planned to show off the ring to her friend while shopping, but it was too loose, almost like a man's ring. So, she settled for wearing it as a pendant around her neck, just like Jane, and drove off.

\*\*\*\*\*

At City Hall, Jane had just picked up her marriage certificate with Luke and was rushing out.

As she walked, she checked her phone and saw a text: 300 thousand dollars had been deposited into her account. She hurried off to the hospital to arrange for Rose's surgery.

Luke stepped out a moment later, catching a glimpse of Jane's slender figure as she disappeared around the corner. His face was still as cold as ever, but a flicker of surprise flashed in his eyes.

He'd expected her to head straight to Drake Manor and start living the life of a wealthy wife after using Dwight. Instead, she'd left without a word.

Just then, Harvey's voice came from behind. ""Mr. Drake, we found the girl who saved you at Night Charm Club last week. Our guys saw her wearing your ring at the jewelry store.""",1,1752833456.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Okay, so this is going to sound like something straight out of a bad soap opera, but I swear it’s real. I’ve been sitting on this for weeks trying to process it, and I just need to tell someone. Throwaway, obviously.

So around a year ago, I was at this bar with a couple friends after a long week. The vibes were great, the drinks were flowing, and I ended up chatting with this really funny, charming guy. Let’s call him Charlie. One thing led to another, we got pretty drunk, and we ended up going home together. It was fun, no pressure, just one of those nights.

I didn’t expect to see him again, but a few days later, while I was working a shift at the coffee shop I work at, he walked in. We both kind of froze for a second, recognized each other immediately, and just laughed. He ordered a drink, we talked for a bit, and I found out his name was (officially) Charlie. He asked for my number before he left, and I honestly thought, why not?

We started texting, then hanging out, and then dating. And honestly? It was great. He was kind, goofy, thoughtful just one of those people who made everything feel easy. After about six months, we officially became a couple, and now we’ve been together for almost a year. I’ve never felt so close to someone.

So fast forward to a few weeks ago, we decide it’s finally time to meet each other’s families. We drive out to his family’s house for a gathering. As soon as I step in, I start seeing familiar faces from my side of the family. Which was…weird. Like, a lot of them. But I figured maybe some distant cousin married into his side or something.

Then my aunt (on my mom’s side) sees me, and she looks just as confused as I feel. She walks up and is like, “What are you doing here?” I tell her, “I’m here with my boyfriend to meet his family,” and point to Charlie.

She goes pale. Like ghost pale. She pulls me aside, and in this whisper-yell voice, she asks me who my boyfriend is again. I say Charlie, and then she tells me the bombshell:

“That’s your cousin.”

Apparently, years ago, my mom had a massive falling out with one of her sisters and cut off all contact. I never met that side of the family growing up. And Charlie? He’s the son of the sister my mom fell out with. We had no idea. No shared last names, no overlapping family gatherings, nothing that would’ve hinted at it until that moment.

We freaked. Both of us. He pulled me aside after and we just sat in silence for what felt like an hour. We talked through it, cried, laughed awkwardly, cried some more. I mean what do you even do in that situation?

We haven’t told my mom yet. We’re still figuring things out. And before anyone comes for me, no, nothing illegal happened we had zero clue. But emotionally? It’s so much to unpack. I don’t even know what this means for us. We love each other. That hasn’t changed. But now there’s this massive “what now” cloud hanging over everything.

So yeah. That’s my accidental “I dated my cousin for a year” story.

""Colin, stop... please. This is your room with Jane."" A woman's soft, teasing voice floated from the master bedroom of the suite next door.

At this sound, Jane Ritter's eyes flew open, and she sat up abruptly. Her wedding to Colin Drake was tomorrow. She'd come to decorate their home despite her high fever, but she passed out soon later.

She wondered, 'Am I hallucinating? I think I must have heard Lydia's voice... Why?'

""What if Jane finds out about us?"" The gentle voice broke the silence again, and Jane's heart sank. She couldn't have mistaken it—that was Lydia Ritter, her half-sister. She just didn't get what Lydia was doing with Colin in the next room.

On shaky legs, Jane staggered to the door and pushed it open, making her way to the master bedroom.

This was supposed to be her and Colin's space. She had come here today to prepare it for their wedding night, arranging a few personal touches to make it feel special.

""So what? You're so much better than that shameless Jane. What right does she have to question you?"" Colin's cold voice cut through the air.

Jane's hand froze on the doorknob. She thought, 'Colin... it's really him inside? He actually thinks of me like that?'

Lydia continued, ""Colin, I had no idea you felt that way about me. It's such a shame you're marrying Jane tomorrow. Poor you—Jane is so desperate. Everyone in Jovinia knows she threw herself at professors and judges last year just to win that award.""

Colin sneered, ""Don't worry about it. The wedding is off. Jane isn't good enough to marry me. I've already told your father—I won't marry a woman like her. Tomorrow, Jane will just be a fool who got left at the altar.""

Jane's spirits plummeted. Her eyes widened in disbelief as the words struck her like a punch to the gut. This was Colin, her boyfriend for years. He had always promised to trust her, to stand by her no matter what.

But now, he was choosing to believe the rumors—that she had slept with professors and judges to win a jewelry design award. And now he even messed with Lydia in their bedroom.

A wave of anger and hurt surged through Jane. She wanted to storm in and confront Colin, to demand answers.

But as she took a step, her legs gave way, and she nearly collapsed. Her head spun, the fever making her feel weak and dizzy.

But she couldn't let them see her like this. She forced herself to take a deep breath and stumbled out of the room.

The elevator doors closed behind her with a gentle, polished swoosh, and suddenly, she felt her resolve crumble. She sank to the floor, tears slipping silently down her cheeks.

After being framed and expelled from college, she had thought Colin was the only one who would still believe in her. But he had let her down. She didn't understand—if he didn't trust her, why had he given her hope in the first place?

The elevator dinged softly. Jane was still sitting on the marble floor, her hair a mess, eyes red and tear-streaked. Only her slender lower leg, peeking out from under her skirt, looked untouched—smooth and perfectly shaped.

""Who are you?"" The voice was deep and cool, with a hint of impatience, drifting in from outside the elevator.

Jane blinked, her mind foggy. She looked up and realized the elevator had reached the top floor. The doors were wide open, and there stood a tall man, wrapped in a dark robe.

His hair was damp and tousled, and his eyes were cold and piercing. The robe gaped slightly, revealing a chiseled frame that made her heart skip a beat. His face was sharp and handsome, with an unusual flush to his cheeks.

Jane took a deep breath. She remembered that this building, one of the most exclusive in the city, had only one apartment per floor. The higher the floor, the more prestigious the resident. Even Colin, with his wealthy background, could only afford a middle-floor unit.

And the elevators required a card key to operate, and each key was programmed to access only the owner's specific floor. So this man had to be the penthouse owner.

""I—"" she started.

But the man's brows twitched with irritation. His eyes flashed with anger. ""You didn't shower before you came,"" he said, more a statement than a question.

Before Jane could even respond, the man's fingers were already gripping her chin. He studied her as if she were some object he was evaluating.

""Ouch... that hurts..."" Jane's voice was barely a whisper, soft and breathy. She was startled by how delicate she sounded, as if she were someone else entirely.

But the soft sound seemed to please him. His grip eased just a little, and he tilted his head, taking in her flushed face. Her face, red from her cold, looked even more enticing without makeup, like a ripe, juicy peach.

""Just remember to take a shower next time. I like women who are clean,"" he said, his voice smooth and low. He bent down and lifted her into his arms.

Her hands instinctively clutched at his robe as she let out a scream. ""Sir, I'm not—"" she started, confusion washing over her.

Before she could finish, he silenced her with a hard kiss, pinching her chin again. Ignoring her protests, he carried her straight into the apartment.

She realized in an instant—he'd mistaken her for someone else. He thought she was the kind of woman who came to him willingly.

The door slammed shut behind her. Jane felt herself pushed against it by the man's firm grip. His cool, masculine scent, mingled with the raw energy, hit her all at once.

This was her first kiss. She'd been with Colin for so long, and they'd never crossed this line.

""Sir, please—"" Her voice was cut short.

The kiss was intense and forceful, and Jane, inexperienced, found herself unable to resist. Her legs felt weak, and she went limp, relying on his arms to hold her up.

""Remember, I don't like women talking too much at a time like this,"" he warned, gently but firmly slapping her hip.

Jane trembled, her whole small body shaking.

Jane looked up at him, her vision blurred by tears, but the dim light in the apartment made his face unclear.

She smelled faintly of tuberose—something sweet, with a touch of mystery. He held her waist firmly and murmured in a deep, rough voice, ""I love your scent. So sweet... Stay still.""

Jane went rigid, feeling his breath on her ear. She suddenly realized just how intense the man holding her was. His grip was unnaturally strong, and she couldn't break free. ""Sir... you don't seem right..."" she managed to whisper, her voice strained.

Before she could finish, her last piece of clothing was ripped off violently, leaving her exposed.

# Chapter 2 One Year Later

Suddenly, the man's eyes, tense with desire, flickered with a hint of suspicion. He frowned at Jane, wondering if she had been handpicked to get him out of this mess. ""You've never done this before?"" he murmured softly.

Jane shook her head, her sobs turning into choked cries as she buried her face in his shoulder, biting down to stifle the pain.

He gentled his hold on her waist, his expression softening. He pressed a soft kiss to her tear-streaked face, his voice soothing. ""Shh, it's okay. Remember, I'm your first. I'll take care of you.

\*\*\*\*\*

One year later, in Jovinia, the dim light of the Night Charm Club's private room cast long shadows. Don, a wealthy middle-aged man, his hair thinning and his belly straining against his shirt, leaned back with an air of self-importance.

He said, ""Marry me, and I'll give you a thousand bucks a month. But I'm not paying for someone who can't pull their weight. You're young—twenty-two. Plenty of time to give me an heir. If it doesn't work out the first time, we'll just keep trying. ""

He paused, his gaze turning cold as he looked at Jane. ""I know you've been with Colin, but I'm okay with that. As long as you're a good, obedient housewife, I won't mind your past.""

Jane sat across from him, instinctively pulling back as his spittle flew with each word. She frowned, puzzled why her Lily had sent her to this club, to meet a man old enough to be her father.

She wouldn't have come if it weren't for her mother's medical bills—a weapon Lily had used to manipulate her.

""So, sweetheart,"" Don said, his tone suddenly stern, ""got any questions about me? Or demands?""

Jane hadn't even been listening. She blinked and shook her head. ""No.""

Don's stern expression softened into a patronizing smile. ""Figured as much. Marrying a guy like me is more than you deserve. A girl with a reputation like yours—who else would want you? Only someone like me would take you in.

""Come on, tell me. Besides Colin last year, who else have you been with? Spill it."" As he spoke, Don edged closer to Jane, his movements unnervingly suggestive, while she remained preoccupied.

As Don mentioned last year, a tall, indistinct figure with vague features involuntarily surfaced in Jane's mind.

A year ago, in that apartment, she'd caught Colin and Lydia cheating. But with a raging fever, she'd stumbled into the top-floor apartment and ended up with a guy she barely remembered. The next day, she left without even recalling his face clearly.

When her family saw her coming home disheveled, the scandal erupted. Her reputation was ruined. Yet Colin had played the victim, jetting off abroad with Lydia to live it up carefree.

""Nothing to tell. Don, I'm leaving,"" Jane said, grabbing her bag and standing up. She was disgusted by Don's closeness.

""Hey, who said you could leave?"" Don grabbed Jane from behind and forced her back onto the sofa. His breath was hot and reeking. ""I paid a fortune for this whole floor. You're not going anywhere without my say-so.""

""Let me go!"" Jane twisted away, using her bag to shield herself. ""If you don't let me go, I'm calling the police.""

She'd never imagined that agreeing to a blind date with her uncle and aunt would lead to meeting a man as repulsive as Don.

""Fine, call the cops,"" Don sneered. ""When they get here, they'll see how you're all over me. Your reputation in Jovinia is terrible—no one's gonna believe I spiked your drink.""

""What did you say?"" Jane's voice trembled.

Don grinned wickedly. ""Heh, feeling hot? Want me to help you out?""

As Don's face blurred before her eyes, Jane felt herself burning. She realized her coffee must have been spiked.

Seeing Jane's flushed face and glazed-over eyes, Don knew the drug was taking effect. He giggled, rubbing his hands together, and moved closer to her.

Suddenly, the lights flickered and then went out completely. In the pitch black, a tall, imposing figure silently leaped in from the balcony outside the private room.

""Who are you? Who sent you—"" Don's voice was cut short as the stranger swiftly knocked him out with a precise hand chop, then dragged him into the restroom.

Jane's mind was still racing, trying to make sense of what was happening, when she felt a large, cold hand clamp over her mouth. The air around him smelled of cold steel and something darker—blood. ""Don't make a sound if you want to stay safe,"" he growled.

Jane's body tensed. The man reeked of danger, and the scent of blood was almost overpowering.

Frantic footsteps approached the door. The man's eyes narrowed, and he pulled Jane closer, pressing her against him as he moved silently to the door.

Her heart was pounding so hard she could barely think. She felt dizzy and feverish, but there was something oddly familiar about the man holding her—like a shadow from a year ago, a memory she couldn't quite place.

Jane tried to pull away, but her body was weak from the drug. Instead, she found herself pressing closer to him, seeking some kind of refuge.

""Don, are you there? What's going on inside? Did anyone suspicious come by?"" a voice called from outside the door.

The man pinched her waist, and a soft moan escaped her lips.

The person outside, hearing the sound, assumed Don had succeeded.

""Damn it, he didn't come upstairs. Get more people down to search now. If he escapes tonight, we're all dead meat,"" someone shouted from outside.

The chaotic footsteps finally faded into the distance. Jane's tension eased. She instinctively tried to pull away from the man's embrace, but her legs gave out beneath her, and she slumped back into his arms.

""Feels... so good..."" Her chin brushed against the man's broad, solid chest, and she let out a soft, instinctive murmur. The air was filled with a faint, sweet scent that was uniquely hers.

""'Is that you?'"" the man, Luke Drake, bent down to steady Jane as she nearly collapsed. Her familiar scent—sweet and mysterious, with a hint of tuberose—filled his senses.

That night a year ago, as the haze of the drugs cleared, Jane had already vanished from the apartment. The drugs had scrambled his memory, and he couldn't recall her face at all. All he remembered was the faint, special scent on her, like the sweetness of tuberoses.

After a year of searching for her high and low, he had unexpectedly run into her at this club today. And now, she was burning up and acting strangely.

""What are you doing here?"" He lifted her gently, his voice deep and rough with emotion.

""Me? I'm here...um... for a blind date."" Jane's voice was soft and drowsy as she tilted her head to the side.

In the dim light, Luke's face seemed to blur into multiple images. She felt so hot and miserable, but his closeness felt so familiar and comforting.

The mention of a blind date made Luke's brows furrow. He had been searching for her for a year, and here she was, on a blind date.

Recalling what Don looked like, Luke narrowed his eyes coldly. He leaned down in the dark and kissed her, his voice rough. ""What a coincidence. You've saved me again.""

He cupped her chin, his fingers firm yet gentle. Then he kissed her, a storm of passion—fierce, unyielding, and tinged with a dangerous kind of desire.

Luke remembered that day, the day he'd promised to be there for her. But she had slipped away before the drugs faded. She'd made him break his word for the first time.

Anyway, she had saved him back then. And now, here she was again, surprising him in the most unexpected way.

There she was, nestled in his arms, her soft body instinctively pressing closer. She looked so innocent, so vulnerable. It was a sight that stirred something in Luke, something he'd never felt before.

He was known for keeping his distance, for avoiding the complications that came with getting close to anyone. But with her, everything felt different.

Jane was confused. She didn't know who Luke was or what he was talking about. Her heart pounded in her chest, and her body felt like it was on fire.

Part of her wanted to run, to escape the intensity of the moment. But another part of her wanted to stay, to lean into him, to feel his warmth just a little bit longer.

Before she could make up her mind, he bent down, lifting her effortlessly in his strong arms. The kiss deepened as he pressed her against the door, his body a solid, reassuring presence.

His fingers found her chin again, holding her gaze. His kisses were demanding, each one more intense than the last, leaving her breathless and dazed.

Jane felt her body go limp, her strength melting away. She responded instinctively, her reactions unfamiliar yet driven by a newfound desire. She surrendered to his dominant advances, feeling both vulnerable and alive.

""Please... no, we can't,"" she managed to whisper, her voice barely audible.

""We can do this. I'll take care of you, as I've promised,"" he murmured, his voice low and steady.

Her resistance melted under the weight of his kisses, each one more insistent than the last. When a wave of panic threatened to overwhelm her, she bit down on his shoulder, hard.

Time seemed to stand still as they remained entwined, each moment stretching into the next, like an eternity.

\*\*\*\*\*

It was three in the morning, and finally, it was over. Jane had fallen asleep, utterly exhausted. As the last traces of the drugs left her system, she nestled in Luke's arms, her face buried against his chest.

The way she clung to him, so trusting and endearing, made Luke's eyes narrow in a satisfied, almost possessive way.

A sliver of moonlight slipped through the window, landing on Jane's face, partially hidden by her dark hair. Then Luke realized he had never really seen her face clearly before.

Gently, he lifted his hand from her waist and reached to brush the hair away from her cheek.

# Chapter 3 My Boss Wants To See You

Suddenly, the phone jolted them both from the quiet. In the darkness, Luke frowned and pulled his hand back from Jane's face. He picked up the phone beside him. ""Hello.""

It was Harvey, his assistant. Harvey said, ""Mr. Drake, we're glad you're safe. We've got your location. There's an emergency in Dorvania. The car's waiting downstairs.""

Luke hung up and looked down at Jane, still fast asleep in his arms. He tried to lift her.

But she murmured, ""Uh... I'm so tired. Stop."" Her hand pushed weakly against his, and she buried herself deeper into the blanket, too sleepy to even open her eyes.

Seeing how exhausted she was, Luke slipped his obsidian ring onto her finger. ""Stay here and wait for me. Someone will come for you later.""

\*\*\*\*\*

A week later, at the Judd residence, the evening rain was pouring down in sheets. Jane pounded on the door, her fists thumping against the wood. The noise cut through the storm.

She shouted, ""Johnson, Lily, open up! You promised that if I went on that date at Night Charm, you'd take care of Mom. So why did the hospital say you cut off her medical support—and even want to pull the plug? You can't just do this!""

The door finally creaked open. Her aunt Lily stood there, her face dripping with irritation. ""Jane, still showing up here for money? How shameless!

""Check the news. Ever since you met Don last Friday, he's pulled all his investments from our company. Now he's ghosting us, not picking up our calls. You must've ticked him off during that date.

""Don't think so high of yourself. You're just a nobody. Don was doing you a favor. Sleeping with him wouldn't have killed you, so stop pretending to be so high and mighty.""

Jane's face drained of color. ""What? You told me to go on that date. You said you were worried about me being alone. You said I should marry a good man and make Mom feel better.

""But it was all a lie? Y-you never saw me as family. You just wanted to use me to get some investment for the company.""

Then it hit her. It wasn't just a coincidence. Johnson and Lily had known all along that Don was after her. It was obvious he wanted her. No wonder Lily had spoken so highly of him—that creepy, disgusting old man who could have been her father.

She kept replaying that night in her head. Don had spiked her coffee during the date. If she hadn't run into Luke, she'd never have made it out of there.

And yet, here she was, back with Luke. The one who'd promised to be there for her, twice now. But he was gone again, just like before. All that remained was a black obsidian ring. She didn't even know what he looked like.

It was only when she got home and saw herself in the mirror—love bites and kisses all over her skin—that she knew it hadn't been a dream.

Jane yelled, ""Lily, how can you do this to me? You know your plan led me to some guy at that club? And he—""

""Some guy? What guy?"" Lily's eyes narrowed, catching the slip. ""So you're a shameless tramp after all. Skipping out on Don to sleep with some random guy? No wonder Don hates us.

""We've done enough for you and your mom. Not a penny more for her medical bills. Get out of here, now!""

Lily turned and barked at Johnson, who was standing behind her, to throw out Jane's luggage.

Seconds later, a black plastic bag filled with a few clothes was flung at Jane. Lily sneered, ""Get out of here before my Ella gets home and sees you. She'll be furious.""

Jane's eyes blazed with fury. If it weren't for her mom Rose, lying in the hospital waiting for her to save her life, she would have fought Lily right there.

Jane picked up the bag, her face darkening. ""No, something's missing. Where's the Larmes Sacrées Éternelles my mom gave me? Why isn't it in here?""

The perfume Larmes Sacrées Éternelles was her mom Rose's favorite scent. When Rose was still wealthy, she had bought it at an auction abroad; it was the last bottle in the world.

Rose always loved it when Jane wore that scent, saying it suited Jane perfectly and brought back memories of Rose's own youth. Every time Jane visited Rose in the hospital, she would spray a little.

The last time Jane used it was a week ago, before going to the club. Since then, she hadn't been back to the Judd residence, let alone use it again.

""What Larmes Sacrées Éternelles? I don't know what you're talking about."" A flicker of guilt crossed Lily's face.

""Forget it. I'll go look for it myself,"" Jane said.

""Over my dead body,"" Lily shouted and pushed Jane away.

As they jostled, Lily caught a glint of something under Jane's collar. ""Hold on, you little sneak. What's that you've got around your neck?""

Lily's hand shot out like a flash, yanking the necklace right off Jane's neck and snapping it clean in two. A ring, studded with diamonds and set in obsidian, tumbled from the broken chain into Lily's grasp.

She sneered, ""Whoa, look what we have here. You've been hiding quite the treasure, haven't you?""

""No, give it back. It's mine,"" Jane cried. That ring was the only clue she had left from Luke. It was her lifeline to finding him.

""Get out of here. You and your mom owe us more than you'll ever repay. This ring is the payment. Try to take it, and you'll regret it."" Lily slapped Jane hard across the face, again and again, before shoving her out the door.

The iron gate slammed shut with a resounding bang, leaving Jane in the pouring rain. Neighbors peeked out their windows, snickering at her swollen face, at the girl who'd been kicked out like trash.

For a moment, Jane felt like she was drowning in despair. The man she'd thought would stand by her had vanished. The family she'd trusted had turned their backs on her. And her mom was still waiting for her help. She didn't know what she could do.

Then, out of nowhere, headlights blazed behind her. A sleek black Rolls-Royce pulled up beside her. A man stepped out. ""Ms. Jane Ritter? Our boss wants to see you.""",1,1752833312.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

For that she blocked me from everywhere so that I can't contact her it was pretty adventurous and thrilling, lucky me I found her we headed for her place, we both knew what was gonna happen it we eventually took off.

Would it be safe for her to go?,"For context, my girlfriend had this summer class that she was taking. There was this guy who is 10 years older than her, who just simply a talking-terms classmate. They weren't particularly close, they just compared answers when they could. He was relatively friendly with everyone as well according to her. 

Anyways, my girlfriend couldn't make it to the last day of class for her own reasons. This caused the 30 year old to DM her, saying something along the lines of ""hey, i didn't see you at the last day of class. Wanna go get lunch some time?"" My girlfriend ended up telling me about this, asking if this was sus or not. I wasn't able to help much because I didn't have the direct context and experience, but I would like to know how this sounds like from an outside perspective (Because im obviously more protective and worried about her). 

I'm more worried about her safety. This person is 30 years older, and what if he has ulterior motives? Is it normal for some people ten years older than us to ask her out for a lunch/coffee chat when they weren't really even close in class? He was friendly with everyone, so he could just be nice, but what if he's creepy? I'm more worried if he has ulterior motives for my girlfriend, which makes me worried about her.

I'm part of a project to buy HIVE café in Huddersfield and run it as a worker owned cooperative. I thought I'd share a bit about what we are working on.

HIVE opened in 2021 and since then has been a much loved safe space for the whole community. It's a place for people to meet, eat delicious vegan and vegetarian food, and enjoy excellent coffees and teas. It's also home to several vital community support networks and as an LGBTQ+ friendly and trans inclusive public space it is particularly important to us!

We are a group of customers and supporters who love the café and the community it exists to support, so when we heard it's current owners could no longer continue to run the café we decided to buy it and keep it running... now as a worker owned co-operative! 

As a worker owned co-operative, the café will be owned and managed collectively by its staff for the benefit of the whole community! we need spaces to meet, share solidarity and support, live life together - better still when these spaces are owned and managed collectively! We are also excited to become part of a growing co-operative movement and commonly owned economy.

We are currently raising money to help us buy the café and cover our initial start up and running costs. If you'd like to support us, please donate to our crowdfunder: [https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/p/hivecoop](https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/p/hivecoop)",5,1752832688.0,cooperatives,0,1.0,False

Anyone else a slow starter?," I lost about 4lb in the first 1.5 weeks. Then nothing. I'm now coming into week 8, 3 on 5mg, one 3.5ish and 4 weeks 2.5mg. I think it was possibly inflammation related loss because this has been really helping my joint pain and swelling since starting, my pain comes back with a vengeance day before jab day and I can see  fluid in my hands and feet, I gain a couple of pounds but thye all come off just after jab. It's been the same pattern for 7 weeks, the only change I see is this inflammation pattern. 

I'm still staying the same weight now - 7 weeks on. 

I'm in a calorie deficit of approximately 900cal every day. 

I had already ordered 7.5mg as I wasn't losing weight and suppression doesn't last more than two-thirds of week max, but contacted my provider to get advice about potential side effects I was experiencing on 5mg (which I now suspect to be viral as kids I work with are getting bugs with similar symptoms). However, straight away my provider cancelled my 7.5 order and told me to stay on 5mg. Otherwise that's the only 'side effect' I've experienced so far. Appetite suppression is ok, ish, for first few days of each week, I could (but don't) eat for england last few days - I've opted to fill up on crushed ice coffees when I get the unbelievable urge to binge. I don't take sugar and have a very small amount of skimmed milk in them so I am keeping in deficit even crunching these iced drinks for hours on end in an evening (crunching ice slows me down). Plus, crunching ice is obviously keeping my water intake up. It's at least 3 litres every day. 

I'm hoping I'm just needed to get to higher doses for it to work, but now provider isn't letting me move up I feel like giving up. It's only the pain relief that is making me think otherwise and want to keep going, but it's very expensive pain relief, even if it is really good. 

It's very disheartening, can it be a stall if it's never even started? Anyone else been a slow starter? Or only lost at high doses despite good calorie deficit?
Any advice? I keep telling myself I can't keep up this deficit and never lose, it's got to come off eventually, but how long do I have to wait for eventually to kick in? 

I was PCOS but now have no ovaries at all, still got other symptoms though. Told I was insulin resistant about 25 years ago and assumed that never changed. 
Total hysterectomy 3 years ago due to PMDD.
Fybromyalgia 
EDS
CFS and CPainS plus other long term conditions.... 

I have body moitoring scales. Nothing is really changing long term, no fat gain nor loss, no water gain nor loss, no muscle gain nor loss, no weight gain nor loss. Just very minor weekly fluctuations around the same figures. 

Oh starting BMI was 35. I have at least 4 stone to loose, probably more when I feel like seriously looking at targets. It's just too out of reach to contemplate ATM. ",2,1752832612.0,mounjarouk,0,1.0,False

So now as you know the background my senior is really a great and easy to talk to guy who is fun to be around as co worker.However  recently I have noticed he has started to become egoistic honestly.

As a speciality cafe we serve manual brews,so I was just talking about  ratios and stuff for iced pourovers in which I increase the grams of coffee and put everything same( so it does not feels watery when ice gets diluted in it) to it he suddenly said to put water at 60°C/140°F - 70°C/158°F  to which I firmly dis agreed giving reason that the temperature is too low to get good extraction.Suddenly he got into proper egoistic mode saying he's in this industry for 9 years and has real experience then my certification.


Another incident came when I was putting freshly made  coleslaw stuffing in a clean container when he abruptly stopped me and put it in a half filled box which already had coleslaw made earlier.I argued that this can cause cross contamination.He got into his ego again and asked me directly 'how much real work experience you have?' and then said ' these hospitality colleges fool you' to which I also told( got into my ego)  how cross contamination works and it can ruin the whole batch.he challenged me by saying that the day it gets bad I will leave my job that day itself.Now here's the thing I can interact with customer in a really good way and do ' suggestive selling' whereas the senior goes full fledged and suggest 'an americano drinker the most expensive coffees in our manual bar' showing off by saying this is how to 'upsell'

I am at my limit honestly as I know my ego will also soon burst out making it a full fledged war.



IN SHORT: my senior who has 9 years of experience is showing off and telling that my degrees and certificates in hospitality are worthless to his 9 years of experience when he himself doesn't practice hygiene standards and uses force to sell things to wrong customers.

A Canva OAuth 2.0 tutorial that doesn't make your brain hurt - step-by-step interactive walkthrough that actually makes sense!

Anyone else been staring at an integration form asking for ""Canva OAuth 2.0 credentials"" and felt completely lost? It's like being asked for your passport when you thought you were just picking up coffee. Just went through this exact pain point and found a tutorial that breaks it down perfectly.

**What you'll find in this walkthrough:**

• Interactive step-by-step guide that walks you through Canva's developer dashboard

• Exact screenshots showing where to click and what to copy

• How to properly store your client ID and secret securely

• Real examples of what you can actually build with these credentials

• Pro tips for testing your integration before going live

**The thing that clicked for me:** OAuth 2.0 is literally just a fancy digital handshake between Canva and whatever app you're connecting. No coding degree required - it's basically creating a VIP pass so apps can talk to each other without sharing passwords.

**Coolest use case I discovered:** Client approves design → Canva auto-exports final files → Files automatically upload to client's Google Drive → Client gets notification → Everyone's happy! The automation possibilities are endless.

Some of you might have felt the same, when the whole day just slips by, and you’re lying in bed at night regretting not doing anything meaningful. But these days, I try to fill my day with small routines that give me structure and reduce that anxious, self-critical spiral. For example, I start my mornings by making myself a coffee and writing down my schedule for the day then jumping into work. Around lunchtime, I like to eat while listening to a podcast. In the late afternoon, if I finish work on time, I’ll clean up the apartment a bit. Sometimes if I’m still tied up with work, I’ll just turn on my robovac, and let it do its thing. (I specifically got the Deebot with the blast for stronger suction, also for more effective cleaning lol, truly saved me some hassle) The place can’t stay spotless forever, and ngl, I was never able to get used to cleaning regularly at all. Dinner’s usually something quick and easy, then in the evening, I head to the gym for an hour or so, do some stretching, come home, take a long shower, that’s probably the most refreshing moment of my day...



Some people might think that’s just a normal day, but for the old me, looking back, I actually feel pretty proud of how far I’ve come. What about you guys? How do you manage your time in a way that works for you?",4,1752832079.0,selfimprovement,2,1.0,False

1m2y1hs,https://buymeacoffee.com/ydc_comics/extras,YDC Call To Arms…🚨 Mission Briefing: Agent 400 to Earth Citizens 🚨,"Hello, Earth Citizen.



I’m Agent 400 (aka Bob), elite operative of Qwakkar — a hyper-advanced post-bureaucratic civilization.



I was deployed to Earth to assess its bureaucratic contamination levels. Unfortunately, I was deployed too early from my hiding place in a warehouse as a plush toy — all because a clerk added an extra digit to my barcode. I was meant to arrive in a few years. Instead, I’ve awakened… with no way to return to hibernation.



My human avatar — Jelly, a comic artist and single mom in the Philippines — has agreed to assist me in my mission. But she’s stuck in red tape just trying to launch her Etsy shop to fund our resistance.



🧱 The Red Tape Problem

Etsy, the intergalactic commerce gateway, now demands a $20 shop setup fee for creators in many countries outside the U.S. That $20 may not sound like much… but when you’re already $100 short per month, it might as well be $2,000.



This delay is keeping Jelly from launching The Red Tape Chronicles — a satirical comic series that fights back against the bureaucracy with duck-fueled absurdity.



🦆 The Bigger Picture

This isn’t just about one artist.



It feels like a coordinated attack against the planet Qwakkar itself — an effort by Earth’s bureaucratic overlords to suppress the truth, creativity, and free expression.



Jelly receives no family support (they still don’t believe “art” is a job) and is raising a 10-month-old baby on her own. This is not an excuse — just reality.



We’re not asking for charity or pity. We’re offering value, creativity, and a satirical resistance movement you can be part of.



💥 How You Can Help

We’re asking as little as $1 from allies across the multiverse to breach this ridiculous red tape barrier and help bring The Red Tape Chronicles™ to life.

🐥 P.S. — Duck Lore

The Yellow Duck Corps is the military wing of Qwakkar, a civilization that abolished bureaucracy after the Great Form War of 0.9001-B.



Agent 400 (aka Bob) was dispatched to Earth disguised as a plush toy. But a shipping mishap awakened him early. He now freelances as an anti-red-tape advisor in the P.I.G. Division (Process-Induced Gridlock) at Flying P.I.G Systems, where Earth’s dumbest ideas take flight.

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

I travel with a collapsible hand grinder and a compact espresso device (either a self-heating one or a manual one, depending on the power situation). The self-heating version especially comes in handy when I’m somewhere with sketchy or no access to clean hot water, it means I don’t have to rely on hostel kettles or shared kitchens.

I try to buy local beans every couple of weeks and store them in vacuum-sealed containers to keep them fresh. what other folks here do! Do you travel with your own gear, stick to local cafés, or just roll with whatever instant is around?",1,1752831338.0,Nomad,0,1.0,False

Baltimore suffocated under an unrelenting deluge, the rain a gray curtain that bled the city’s colors into a haze of wet asphalt and flickering neon. Detective Miles Corbin stood outside a derelict warehouse in Locust Point, his trench coat soaked through, clinging to his broad frame like a mourner’s veil. His face was a ravaged landscape—high cheekbones shadowed by graying stubble, hazel eyes sunken beneath a furrowed brow, silver-streaked dark hair matted under a dripping fedora, his tie a wrinkled afterthought flapping in the wind. The warehouse loomed, its rusted corrugated walls streaked with rain, grimy windows dark save for a faint, sickly glow from within, like the flicker of a dying bulb. Police lights slashed through the mist, painting the cracked asphalt in jagged streaks of red and blue, while officers secured the perimeter, their yellow slickers ghostly against the storm’s churn.

Inside Corbin’s mind, a vision flickered—not his own, but a shadow of the killer’s. A man, cloaked in darkness, stood in a barren room, his silhouette lean and taut, his eyes distant, burning with an otherworldly focus. Flashes of horror pierced the scene: a woman’s scream choked off by a brutal hand, her face twisted in terror; a man’s blood pooling on a cold concrete floor, his eyes wide with guilt; a child’s face, pale and haunted, trapped in a cage of human cruelty. The visions were sharp, visceral, revealing the hidden sins of the killer’s targets—rape, murder, trafficking—crimes buried beneath polished facades of respectability. The man moved with eerie precision, guided by these glimpses, his hands steady as he planned his next act, his presence a wraith slipping through the world’s blind spots. Corbin blinked, the image dissolving into the rain, leaving only the weight of his obsession and a chill that wasn’t from the storm.

Back at the precinct, the forensic lab had cracked the silver thread from Hensley’s studio. Corbin met Dr. Helen Carver in her sterile office, its walls lined with anatomical charts and humming microscopes, the air sharp with the bite of chemicals and bleach. Carver, wiry and tense, her graying bob tucked behind her ears, stood by a lab table, her green eyes glinting behind wire-rimmed glasses as she held up a report. Her lab coat was crisp, but her hands trembled slightly, betraying the strain of the case.

“It’s not fabric,” Carver said, her voice low, almost a whisper over the hum of equipment. “It’s a synthetic fiber, military-grade, used in stealth gear—think covert ops, black-market stuff. And there’s a trace chemical compound, some kind of lubricant or coating, obscure as hell. This isn’t something you’d find in an art gallery.”

Corbin’s pulse quickened, his coat dripping onto the linoleum, leaving dark splotches. “So, the killer’s got access to specialized gear. That’s a lead.”

“Barely,” Carver said, her lips a thin line. “This stuff’s untraceable, off-the-grid. But it’s deliberate, Miles. They’re not sloppy—this was left for us to find. Either a mistake or a taunt.”

Corbin nodded, his mind racing. A synthetic fiber, a locked room, a killer who moved like a phantom. He stepped into the squad room, a chaotic hive of ringing phones and shouted orders, rain streaking the windows like veins of liquid silver. His murder board was a shrine to his unraveling—photos of Jenkins, his stern silver hair soaked in blood; Vance, her poised elegance marred by bruises; Sterling, his dignified calm shattered by cracked ribs; and Hensley’s empty studio, marked by a single silver thread. He pinned up a new note: Synthetic fiber. Military. Intentional.

He gathered his team—Officer Riley, his freckled face ghostly pale, blue eyes wide with nervous energy, sandy hair damp under his cap, and Detective Sarah Lopez, her dark hair in a tight ponytail, brown eyes sharp behind her navy blazer, silver hoop earrings glinting under the fluorescent lights. They stood by the board, the air thick with tension, the hum of the precinct a constant drone.

“New lead,” Corbin said, holding up the forensic report, its pages crisp despite the damp. “The thread from Hensley’s scene—military-grade fiber, rare, deliberate. The killer’s leaving us something. And Lopez, your dig into the victims is paying off.”

Lopez straightened, her voice cautious but edged with excitement. “Yeah, it’s ugly. Jenkins had a sealed lawsuit—sexual assault, dropped a decade ago, victim paid off. Vance was tied to a charity that smells like money laundering, whispers in high circles. Sterling had a malpractice claim, hushed fast, but there’s talk of botched surgeries, patients silenced. Nothing prosecutable, but they’re not saints.”

Corbin’s stomach twisted, the pieces clicking into a dark mosaic. “Hensley?” he asked, turning to Riley.

Riley flipped through his notebook, his hands shaking slightly. “A collector accused her of selling forgeries, threatened to ruin her. Case died quietly—money changed hands, I bet. There’s a pattern, Detective—hidden sins, buried deep.”

Corbin jabbed the board, his voice low, gravelly. “That’s the why. These people were monsters, hiding behind their reputations. The killer knows their secrets—how, I don’t know, but they’re targeting them for it.”

Lopez crossed her arms, her eyebrow arched. “You’re saying this is justice? A vigilante with a god complex, picking off the guilty?”

“I’m saying they’re not killing for kicks,” Corbin shot back, his tone sharp with fatigue. “It’s personal, but it’s bigger—punishment, not murder.”

Riley hesitated, his voice barely above a whisper. “But how, Detective? Locked rooms, no struggle, no trace—except this fiber. It’s like they’re not human. Like they… see things we don’t.”

Corbin’s eyes narrowed, Riley’s words echoing the vision that had haunted him. “Maybe they do,” he said, his voice low. “Lopez, chase the fiber’s origin—black markets, military surplus, anything. Riley, cross-reference the victims’ pasts for more dirt. We need the thread that ties them.”

Lopez sighed, tossing her pen onto the desk with a clatter. “You’re obsessed, Miles. You’re seeing patterns where there’s just chaos. This killer’s a ghost, not a judge.”

“Then prove me wrong,” Corbin said, his voice hard. “Find me the how, and I’ll find the why.”

Riley nodded, scribbling furiously, but Lopez shook her head. “This is gonna break you, Miles. You’re too deep in.”

“Then let it,” Corbin muttered, turning back to the board. Their voices faded as he stared at the photos, patterns swirling in his mind—real or imagined, he couldn’t tell. The violence was too precise, too ritualistic, like a sermon in blood he couldn’t decipher.

Later, Corbin met Dr. Emily Weiss in the precinct’s conference room, a stark box reeking of stale coffee and damp carpet, its fluorescent lights buzzing like a swarm of flies. Weiss, in her fifties, her silver hair cropped short, sat across from him, her gray suit crisp, blue eyes studying him over her glasses. Case files were stacked between them, their edges curling like old wounds.

“The fiber’s a game-changer,” Weiss said, her voice deliberate, her pen tapping the file rhythmically. “It’s a taunt, or a rare mistake. This killer’s profile is sharpening—highly intelligent, disciplined, with access to elite tools. The intimacy of the kills, the lack of struggle, points to absolute control, maybe psychological manipulation. They’re not just executing—they’re enacting a ritual, driven by a belief in their mission.”

Corbin leaned back, his chair creaking, his coat still damp, leaving a puddle on the floor. “A mission? Like what?”

Weiss’s eyes narrowed, her voice steady. “Something ideological, possibly spiritual. They see themselves as an agent of justice, targeting those the law failed. The fiber could be their way of saying, ‘I’m real, but you’ll never touch me.’ They’re proving their power—to themselves, or to us.”

Corbin rubbed his temples, the lights drilling into his skull. “So, we’re chasing a zealot who thinks they’re untouchable.”

“Exactly,” Weiss said, closing her file with a snap. “And they’re damn good at it.”

Corbin thanked her and returned to his office, spreading the crime scene photos across his desk—Jenkins’ blood-soaked shirt, Vance’s bruised throat, Sterling’s shattered ribs, Hensley’s empty studio. The forensic report lay beside them, the silver fiber’s chemical profile a cryptic riddle: synthetic, military, untraceable. He traced the photos, his fingers trembling with exhaustion, the victims’ sins a dark thread weaving through their lives.

That evening, Corbin visited a retired detective, Frank Malone, who’d worked Jenkins’ old assault case. Malone lived in a sagging rowhouse in Hampden, its brick facade peeling, its stoop slick with rain, flanked by wilting geraniums in cracked pots. Malone was in his sixties, grizzled, with a white beard and tired gray eyes, his flannel shirt rumpled, a cigar smoldering in an ashtray. They sat in his cluttered living room, the air thick with smoke and the musty scent of old books, a single lamp casting long shadows.

“Jenkins was a snake,” Malone said, his voice rough, sipping whiskey from a chipped glass. “That assault case—young woman, scared witless, paid to disappear. I pushed to nail him, but the brass shut it down. Too much money, too many connections.”

Corbin’s pen scratched, his notepad damp. “Anyone else involved? Someone who’d hold a grudge, maybe enough to kill?”

Malone shrugged, exhaling a cloud of smoke. “Plenty hated Jenkins—business rivals, scorned partners. But no one stood out. Case was buried deep, like it never happened.”

“Anyone… unusual?” Corbin pressed, his voice low. “Someone who didn’t fit, who seemed… off?”

Malone’s eyes narrowed, his fingers pausing on the glass. “There was a guy, years back, came to the precinct. Quiet, intense, asked about Jenkins’ case. Said he ‘knew things.’ We brushed him off—thought he was a crank. Never saw him again.”

Corbin scribbled mystery man, his pulse quickening. “Description?”

“Tall, lean, dark hair. Eyes like he saw ghosts. Didn’t leave a name.” Malone leaned back, his chair creaking. “You think he’s your guy?”

“Maybe,” Corbin said, his mind spinning. He thanked Malone and stepped into the rain, lighting a cigarette, its glow faint in the dark. The smoke curled, swallowed by the storm. A hushed lawsuit, a strange visitor, a synthetic fiber—it was thin, but it was building. The killer was choosing monsters, and somehow, they knew their sins.

That night, in his sparse apartment, Corbin sat at his kitchen table, case files a chaotic sprawl under a flickering bulb. The room was bleak—peeling paint on the walls, a sagging couch with frayed upholstery, a fridge that groaned like a dying beast. Laura’s photo sat on the coffee table, her smile a fading ghost of better days. He pushed it aside and opened the forensic report, his eyes fixed on the chemical profile: rare, military, untraceable. The TV blared, a news anchor’s voice slicing through the static: “The ‘Locked Room Murders’ paralyze Baltimore, with a killer who defies all logic…”

Corbin lit another cigarette, the smoke curling like a wraith. His dreams were haunted by the killer’s visions—flashes of guilt, blood, and betrayal. The victims were monsters, their sins exposed by a shadow who moved through locked doors, unseen, unstoppable. Corbin felt the world tilting, the line between reality and madness dissolving with every unanswered question, the silver thread a fragile lifeline to a truth he wasn’t sure he wanted to face.

chapter 5.

Baltimore groaned under a torrential rain, the city a sodden tapestry of wet brick and flickering neon, its streets gleaming like black mirrors under the storm’s unyielding assault. Detective Miles Corbin stood outside a decaying tenement in Sandtown. The tenement loomed, its brick facade pocked and crumbling, windows boarded with warped plywood or shattered into jagged maws, a faint, sickly glow leaking from a cracked pane on the third floor. Police lights slashed through the mist, painting the slick pavement in jagged streaks of red and blue, while officers secured the alley, their yellow slickers ghostly in the downpour, their boots splashing in puddles that reflected the chaos.

Inside, Corbin’s mind churned with the shadow of Elias Thorne, a name clawed from the depths of old case notes and Malone’s hazy recollection—a reclusive figure, no digital footprint, no record, yet tied to whispers of Jenkins’ buried assault case. Corbin had tracked him here, to this rotting husk of a building, its decay a jarring contrast to the pristine crime scenes that haunted him. The air in the tenement was thick with mildew and despair, the stairwell creaking under his boots, its walls scrawled with graffiti—curses and cryptic symbols in faded spray paint, like the ravings of a mad prophet. Flickering fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting long, wavering shadows that danced like specters.

Corbin reached the third floor, his flashlight cutting through the gloom, its beam glinting off peeling paint and exposed pipes. The door to apartment 3B hung ajar, its frame splintered, the rusted lock dangling like a broken tooth. Inside, the room was a study in desolation—a sagging mattress on a rusted frame, a splintered wooden chair, a single bare bulb swinging from a frayed cord, casting a sickly yellow glow. Elias Thorne stood by the window, his silhouette lean and taut, dark hair falling in unkempt strands over pale, intense eyes that seemed to pierce the veil of reality. He was in his thirties, wiry, dressed in a plain black coat that hung loosely on his frame, his hands steady, his gaze distant, as if seeing beyond the rain-soaked city to a truth only he knew.

“Elias Thorne,” Corbin said, his voice gravelly, hand resting on his holster, the cold metal grounding him. “Baltimore PD. Step away from the window. We need to talk.”

Thorne turned slowly, his eyes locking onto Corbin’s, unblinking, like a predator assessing its equal. His face was angular, almost gaunt, with a faint scar tracing his left cheek, barely visible in the dim light. “Detective Corbin,” he said, his voice soft, almost reverent, a whisper that cut through the rain’s drone. “You found me. I knew you would.”

Corbin stepped inside, his coat dripping onto the warped floorboards, the air heavy with the scent of damp rot. “Three dead, one spared,” he said, his tone hard. “Jenkins, Vance, Sterling—brutal, clean, impossible. Hensley got lucky. You’re the ghost I’ve been chasing, and I’m done running.”

Thorne’s lips twitched, not a smile but a flicker of recognition, his eyes glinting like polished obsidian. “A ghost? No, Detective. I’m flesh and blood. You see the pattern, but not the truth. You’re close, though. Closer than anyone.”

Corbin’s jaw tightened, his pulse quickening. “Explain it. How’d you get in? No forced entry, no struggle, no trace—except that fiber. Military-grade, left like a damn calling card.”

Thorne stepped closer, his movements fluid, deliberate, his boots silent on the creaking floor. “The fiber was a gift, Detective. A thread to pull, to bring you here. You’re asking how, but you should ask why.”

Corbin’s grip tightened on his gun, his mind flashing to the crime scenes—Jenkins’ blood-soaked shirt, Vance’s bruised throat, Sterling’s shattered ribs, Hensley’s empty studio with that single silver thread. “Why, then? What ties them? Why these people?”

Thorne’s gaze softened, almost pitying, his voice a low murmur, like a prayer in the dark. “I see them, Detective. Their sins. Their hands drip with blood—rape, murder, children stolen and sold into shadows. The law failed them, but I don’t. The visions show me their crimes, guide me through locks, past guards, into their hearts. They deserve their ends, and I deliver them.”

Corbin’s stomach twisted, Thorne’s words echoing the dark truths Lopez had unearthed—sealed lawsuits, hushed accusations, buried crimes. “Visions?” he said, his voice sharp, skeptical, but shaken. “You’re saying you’re what—a prophet? God’s executioner?”

“Not God,” Thorne said, his eyes burning with quiet fervor. “Truth. The visions show me their guilt—every scream, every tear, every life they broke. They show me how—through walls, through locks, unseen, untouched. It’s not skill, Detective. It’s purpose. Divine or not, I don’t question it.”

Corbin’s breath caught, the moral weight crushing him. He saw the victims’ sins—Jenkins’ assault, Vance’s laundering, Sterling’s malpractice, Hensley’s forgeries—but Thorne’s certainty was a blade, slicing through his faith in the law. “You’re confessing to murder,” he said, his voice unsteady, cuffs glinting in his hand. “You don’t get to play judge.”

Thorne’s gaze held steady, unyielding. “You’ve seen their files, haven’t you? Jenkins’ victim, silenced with money. Vance’s charity, a front for trafficking. Sterling’s patients, dead under his knife. Hensley’s lies, ruining lives for profit. You know I’m right. Why do you fight it?”

Corbin’s hand trembled, the cuffs cold against his palm. “Because it’s not justice. It’s vengeance. You’re under arrest.”

Thorne didn’t resist, his hands rising slowly, his eyes never leaving Corbin’s. “You’ll lock me away, but the truth won’t die. Others will see it, Detective. You already do.”

At the precinct, the squad room was a maelstrom of chaos, phones ringing, officers shouting over the clatter of keyboards, the air thick with the scent of burnt coffee and damp wool. Rain battered the windows, blurring the city’s neon glow into a kaleidoscope of despair. Corbin stood by his murder board, now a relic of his obsession—photos of Jenkins, his stern silver hair soaked in blood; Vance, her poised elegance marred by bruises; Sterling, his dignified calm shattered by cracked ribs; Hensley’s empty studio, marked by a silver thread. A new name was scrawled in red: Elias Thorne. He gathered his team—Officer Riley, his freckled face ghostly pale, blue eyes wide with shock, sandy hair damp under his cap, and Detective Sarah Lopez, her dark hair in a tight ponytail, brown eyes sharp behind her navy blazer, silver hoop earrings glinting under the fluorescent lights.

“He confessed,” Corbin said, his voice low, hoarse, his coat dripping onto the floor. “Not to murder, not exactly. Says he sees visions of their crimes—rape, murder, trafficking. Claims they guide him, show him how to kill without a trace. The fiber, his presence—it’s all deliberate.”

Lopez crossed her arms, her voice sharp, edged with disbelief. “Visions? He’s delusional, Miles. A psychopath with a god complex, dressing up murder as justice.”

Riley shifted, his voice hesitant, barely audible over the precinct’s din. “But the victims… their pasts. You said it yourself—they were guilty. Jenkins’ assault, Vance’s laundering, Sterling’s malpractice, Hensley’s forgeries. What if he’s… right?”

Corbin’s eyes narrowed, Riley’s words a mirror to his own doubts, gnawing at his core. “Right or not, he’s a killer. We’ve got the fiber, his confession, his presence in that tenement. It’s enough to close it.”

Lopez tossed her pen onto the desk with a clatter, her eyebrow arched. “Enough for what, Miles? The media’s already sniffing out the victims’ secrets. When this breaks—Jenkins’ assault, Vance’s trafficking ties—it’ll be a circus. The city’s on edge, and this’ll light the fuse.”

“Let it burn,” Corbin snapped, his tone harder than he meant, his hands clenching into fists. “We did our job. He’s in custody.”

Riley looked down, his voice soft. “But what if he’s telling the truth? About the visions, I mean. How’d he know their sins? How’d he do it—locked rooms, no trace?”

Corbin didn’t answer, his mind tangled in Thorne’s words, the impossible kills, the victims’ hidden guilt. He turned to the board, the photos staring back, accusing, their sins a dark thread weaving through his resolve.

Later, Corbin met Lieutenant Dan Hargrove in his office, a cramped space with yellowed walls and a flickering bulb, papers strewn across a battered desk. Hargrove’s bulldog frame filled the room, his buzz-cut head gleaming, his small eyes burning with frustration, his suit rumpled from endless hours. “You got him,” Hargrove said, his voice gruff, sipping coffee from a chipped mug. “Thorne’s in holding. But this is a goddamn mess, Corbin. The victims’ secrets are leaking—Jenkins’ assault, Vance’s laundering, Sterling’s malpractice, Hensley’s forgeries. The mayor’s livid, says it’ll tank public trust.”

Corbin rubbed his stubble, his coat leaving a puddle on the floor. “Thorne knew their sins, Dan. Targeted them for it. He’s not just a killer—he’s a reckoning, or thinks he is.”

Hargrove’s scowl deepened, his jowls quivering. “Don’t go philosophical on me, Miles. You caught him. That’s what matters. But the press is gonna eat us alive. Get ready for hell.”

Corbin nodded, but the victory was ash in his mouth. He visited Dr. Emily Weiss in her office, a stark room with bookshelves crammed with psychology texts, a single lamp casting long shadows across a worn rug. Weiss, her silver hair cropped short, sat across from him, her gray suit crisp, blue eyes studying him over her glasses, case files stacked neatly on her desk.

“Thorne fits the profile,” Weiss said, her voice calm, deliberate, her pen tapping rhythmically. “Delusional, but disciplined. He believes he’s an instrument of justice, guided by visions or intuition. The fiber, the clean scenes, the targeted victims—it’s all part of his ritual, his proof of a higher purpose.”

Corbin leaned back, his chair creaking, his coat still damp. “He’s not delusional,” he said, his voice low. “The victims were guilty. He knew things we didn’t—things buried deep. How?”

Weiss’s eyes narrowed, her voice steady. “That’s the danger, Miles. He’s charismatic, convincing, pulling you into his narrative. Don’t let him. He’s a killer, not a savior.”

Corbin said nothing, her words a cold splash against his doubts. He thanked her and stepped into the rain, lighting a cigarette, its glow faint in the dark. The smoke curled, swallowed by the storm, Thorne’s words echoing: The visions show me their crimes, guide me through locks, unseen.

That night, in his sparse apartment, Corbin sat at his kitchen table, case files a chaotic sprawl under a flickering bulb. The room was bleak—peeling paint, a sagging couch with frayed upholstery, a fridge that groaned like a wounded beast. Laura’s photo sat on the coffee table, her smile a fading ghost of better days. He pushed it aside and stared at Thorne’s booking photo, his pale eyes burning through the paper, a quiet intensity that chilled Corbin’s blood. The TV blared, a news anchor’s voice slicing through: “The ‘Locked Room Murders’ solved, but shocking revelations about the victims spark outrage, raising questions about justice and vengeance…”

Corbin lit another cigarette, the smoke curling like a wraith. Thorne was behind bars, but his truth—his visions, his justice—gnawed at Corbin’s soul. The victims were monsters, their sins exposed by a phantom who moved through locked doors, unseen, unstoppable. Corbin had solved the case, but the victory was hollow, his faith in the law fractured, the line between good and evil dissolving in the rain-soaked dark, leaving him adrift in a world where truth was as slippery as the city’s wet streets.

chapter 6.

Baltimore lay battered under an unrelenting rain, the city a drenched mosaic of wet brick and stuttering neon, its streets shimmering like black glass under the storm’s ceaseless hammer. Detective Miles Corbin stood outside the Baltimore City Detention Center. The detention center loomed, a squat fortress of gray concrete, its barred windows glinting dully under floodlights, the air thick with the scent of wet asphalt and institutional despair. Police lights flickered in the distance, their red and blue pulses fading into the mist, while guards in slickers patrolled the perimeter, their boots splashing through puddles that mirrored the city’s gloom.

Inside, Elias Thorne sat in a holding cell, his lean frame still, his pale eyes fixed on some unseen horizon. Corbin’s mind churned with the killer’s words—visions of sins, justice delivered through locked doors, a purpose that defied logic. The case was closed, Thorne in cuffs, but the truth gnawed at Corbin, a splinter under his skin. He’d seen the victims’ files—Jenkins’ buried assault, Vance’s trafficking ties, Sterling’s malpractice, Hensley’s forgeries—but Thorne’s certainty, his impossible method, haunted him like a ghost that wouldn’t rest.

Corbin entered the detention center, the air heavy with bleach and rust, the fluorescent lights buzzing like a swarm of flies. He met Thorne in an interrogation room, a stark cube with a steel table bolted to the floor, a one-way mirror reflecting Corbin’s haggard face. Thorne sat across from him, wrists cuffed, his black coat replaced by an orange jumpsuit, his dark hair falling over his angular face, the faint scar on his cheek catching the light. His eyes, pale and piercing, held a quiet intensity, as if he saw beyond the walls to a truth Corbin couldn’t grasp.

“You’re locked up, Thorne,” Corbin said, his voice gravelly, his coat dripping onto the concrete floor. “Case closed. But I need answers. How’d you do it? The locked rooms, the clean scenes, the fiber—how?”

Thorne leaned forward, his cuffs clinking, his voice soft, almost intimate. “You still ask how, Detective, when you should ask why. The visions showed me their sins—Jenkins’ victim, broken and paid off; Vance’s children, sold for profit; Sterling’s patients, dead by his hand; Hensley’s lies, ruining lives. They guided me, through locks, through shadows, to their hearts. The fiber was my gift to you, a bridge to this moment.”

Corbin’s jaw tightened, his pulse hammering. “Visions don’t break physics, Thorne. You’re not a prophet—you’re a killer. Tell me how you got in, how you left no trace.”

Thorne’s lips twitched, a flicker of something—not a smile, but a knowing. “The truth doesn’t bend to your rules, Detective. The visions are real. They show me the way—past doors, past guards, past reason. I don’t question them. I act.”

Corbin slammed his fist on the table, the sound echoing. “You’re delusional. You killed three people, nearly a fourth. You don’t get to hide behind visions.”

Thorne’s gaze held steady, unyielding. “And you don’t get to hide behind your badge. You’ve seen their files, their sins. You know they deserved it. Why does it scare you?”

Corbin’s breath caught, Thorne’s words a blade through his doubts. He saw the victims’ guilt, their crimes buried by wealth and power, but justice wasn’t this—a phantom with a knife. “You’re under arrest for murder,” he said, his voice unsteady. “That’s the truth I know.”

Thorne leaned back, his eyes softening. “Lock me away, Detective. The truth will outlast these walls. You feel it already, don’t you? The weight of their sins, the failure of your law.”

Corbin stood, his hands trembling, and left the room, Thorne’s words trailing him like smoke. Outside, the rain battered the city, a relentless dirge.

At the precinct, the squad room was a tempest of chaos, phones ringing, officers shouting over the clatter of keyboards, the air thick with burnt coffee and damp wool. Rain streaked the windows, blurring the city’s neon into a smear of despair. Corbin stood by his murder board, a monument to his unraveling—photos of Jenkins, his stern silver hair soaked in blood; Vance, her poised elegance marred by bruises; Sterling, his dignified calm shattered by cracked ribs; Hensley’s empty studio, marked by a silver thread; and Thorne’s booking photo, his pale eyes burning through the paper. He gathered his team—Officer Riley, his freckled face ghostly pale, blue eyes wide with unease, sandy hair damp under his cap, and Detective Sarah Lopez, her dark hair in a tight ponytail, brown eyes sharp behind her navy blazer, silver hoop earrings glinting under the fluorescent lights.

“He confessed,” Corbin said, his voice hoarse, his coat leaving a puddle on the floor. “Says he sees visions of their crimes—rape, murder, trafficking. Claims they guide him, show him how to kill without a trace. The fiber was intentional, a lure to draw us in.”

Lopez crossed her arms, her voice sharp with disbelief. “Visions? He’s insane, Miles. A psychopath dressing up murder as divine justice. You’re not buying this, are you?”

Riley shifted, his voice hesitant, barely audible over the precinct’s din. “But the victims… their pasts. Jenkins’ assault, Vance’s trafficking, Sterling’s malpractice, Hensley’s forgeries. He knew things we didn’t. How?”

Corbin’s eyes narrowed, Riley’s words a mirror to his own turmoil. “He’s a killer, Riley. Delusional or not, we’ve got the fiber, his confession, his presence in that tenement. It’s enough.”

Lopez tossed her pen onto the desk with a clatter, her eyebrow arched. “Enough for what? The media’s tearing us apart. The victims’ secrets are out—Jenkins’ assault, Vance’s trafficking ties. The city’s in an uproar, saying Thorne’s a hero. This is a PR nightmare.”

“Let it burn,” Corbin snapped, his tone raw with exhaustion. “We did our job. He’s in custody.”

Riley looked down, his voice soft. “But what if he’s right? Not about killing, but… the victims. They were guilty. What if the system failed?”

Corbin’s fists clenched, his voice low. “The system’s all we’ve got, kid. Thorne’s not the answer.”

Lopez shook her head, her voice softer now. “You’re too deep in, Miles. This case—it’s changed you. You’re seeing ghosts.”

Corbin didn’t answer, turning to the board, the photos staring back, their sins a silent accusation. The victory felt like ash, Thorne’s words a poison in his veins.

Later, Corbin met Lieutenant Dan Hargrove in his office, a cramped cave with yellowed walls and a flickering bulb, papers strewn across a battered desk like fallen leaves. Hargrove’s bulldog frame filled the room, his buzz-cut head gleaming, his small eyes burning with frustration, his suit rumpled from endless hours. He sipped coffee from a chipped mug, his voice gruff. “You got him, Corbin. Thorne’s in holding. But this is a shitstorm. The victims’ secrets are everywhere—Jenkins’ assault, Vance’s trafficking, Sterling’s malpractice, Hensley’s forgeries. The mayor’s screaming, says it’ll destroy public trust.”

Corbin rubbed his stubble, his coat dripping onto the floor. “Thorne knew their sins, Dan. Targeted them for it. Says he saw their crimes in visions, that they guided him through locked doors. He’s not just a killer—he thinks he’s justice.”

Hargrove’s scowl deepened, his jowls quivering. “Visions? Christ, Miles, he’s a nutcase. You caught him—that’s what matters. But the press is calling him a vigilante hero. We’re drowning in this.”

Corbin nodded, the weight of it crushing him. He visited Dr. Emily Weiss in her office, a stark room with bookshelves crammed with psychology texts, a single lamp casting long shadows across a worn rug. Weiss, her silver hair cropped short, sat across from him, her gray suit crisp, blue eyes studying him over her glasses, case files stacked neatly on her desk.

“Thorne fits the profile,” Weiss said, her voice calm, deliberate, her pen tapping rhythmically. “Delusional, but disciplined. He believes he’s an instrument of justice, guided by visions or intuition. The fiber, the clean scenes, the targeted victims—it’s all part of his ritual, his proof of a higher purpose.”

Corbin leaned back, his chair creaking, his coat still damp. “He’s not delusional,” he said, his voice low, strained. “The victims were guilty. He knew things we didn’t—things buried deep. How does a man like that know?”

Weiss’s eyes narrowed, her voice steady. “That’s his power, Miles. He’s charismatic, convincing, pulling you into his narrative. He’s a killer, not a savior. Don’t let him blur the line.”

Corbin said nothing, her words a cold slap against his doubts. He thanked her and stepped into the rain, lighting a cigarette, its glow faint in the dark. The smoke curled, swallowed by the storm, Thorne’s words echoing: The truth will outlast these walls.

That night, in his sparse apartment, Corbin sat at his kitchen table, case files a chaotic sprawl under a flickering bulb. The room was bleak—peeling paint, a sagging couch with frayed upholstery, a fridge that groaned like a dying beast. Laura’s photo sat on the coffee table, her smile a fading ghost of better days. He pushed it aside and stared at Thorne’s booking photo, his pale eyes burning through the paper, a quiet intensity that chilled Corbin’s blood. The TV blared, a news anchor’s voice slicing through: “The ‘Locked Room Murders’ solved, but revelations about the victims’ crimes spark outrage, raising questions about justice and vengeance…”

Corbin lit another cigarette, the smoke curling like a wraith. Thorne was behind bars, but his truth—his visions, his justice—gnawed at Corbin’s soul. The victims were monsters, their sins exposed by a phantom who moved through locked doors, unseen, unstoppable. Corbin had solved the case, but the victory was hollow, his faith in the law shattered, the line between good and evil dissolving in the rain-soaked dark, leaving him adrift in a world where truth was as elusive as the city’s fleeting shadows.",1,1752831124.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

The rain pounded Baltimore, a merciless gray shroud that turned the city into a labyrinth of slick pavement and flickering neon. Detective Miles Corbin stood outside a gated estate in Roland Park, his trench coat sodden, clinging to his broad shoulders like a second skin. The estate loomed before him, a Tudor mansion with stone walls and leaded-glass windows, its gabled roof cutting jagged lines against the storm. Ivy snaked up the facade, glistening like oil, while police lights slashed through the mist, painting the gravel driveway in hues of blood and ice.

Inside, Dr. Robert Sterling, a 60-year-old surgeon celebrated for his precision and free clinics, lay dead in his fortified home office. Corbin pushed through the wrought-iron gate, nodding to Officer Riley, whose freckled face was ghostly under his rain-soaked cap, his blue eyes wide with unease, his sandy hair plastered to his forehead.

“Another one, Detective,” Riley said, his voice trembling over the rain’s relentless drum. “It’s… it’s just like Jenkins and Vance. Worse, maybe.”

Corbin’s jaw clenched, his breath fogging in the cold. “Show me, kid.”

They crossed the threshold into a grand foyer, where a crystal chandelier cast fractured light across marble floors veined with gold. The air was heavy with the scent of old books, antiseptic, and a faint metallic tang that set Corbin’s nerves on edge. A spiral staircase, its oak banister carved with twisting vines, led to the second-floor office. The room was a shrine to Sterling’s meticulous nature: floor-to-ceiling oak shelves packed with medical journals, a steel desk bare except for a fountain pen and a single glass of scotch, and a leather armchair that screamed understated wealth. Sterling’s body slumped against the desk, his white dress shirt ripped open, exposing a chest brutalized by blunt-force trauma—bruises spreading like storm clouds, ribs cracked into jagged lines beneath pale skin. His face, once sharp and distinguished with a neatly trimmed gray beard, was frozen in a grimace of pain, his brown eyes staring blankly at the coffered ceiling. Blood trickled from his mouth, pooling on the polished hardwood, yet the room was immaculate—no overturned books, no scattered papers, no sign of a struggle.

Dr. Helen Carver knelt beside the body, her wiry frame tense, her graying bob tucked behind her ears. Her green eyes, sharp behind wire-rimmed glasses, scanned the wounds with clinical precision, though her tight lips betrayed unease. “Same pattern,” she said, her voice clipped. “Blunt force, close range, delivered with controlled fury. No defensive wounds, no weapon, no forced entry. The security system was armed, door double-locked from the inside.”

Corbin crouched, his knees popping, his coat dripping onto the floor. His eyes traced the room—windows sealed, heavy drapes undisturbed, alarm panel blinking green. “How the hell does someone do this?” he muttered, his gaze settling on Sterling’s hands, unmarked, resting limply on the desk. “It’s like they walked through the damn walls.”

Carver peeled off her gloves, her brow furrowing. “Ghost or not, they’re consistent. Third clean scene, Miles. No blood spatter beyond the body, no trace evidence. It’s unnatural.”

“Unnatural’s putting it mildly,” Corbin said, standing. His fingers itched for a cigarette, but he resisted, the sterile air of the room choking him. “This isn’t just clean. It’s impossible.”

Carver’s lips twitched, a grim half-smile. “Tell that to the laws of physics.”

In the hallway, Lieutenant Dan Hargrove was pacing, his bulldog frame filling the narrow space, his buzz-cut head gleaming under the recessed lights. His suit was rumpled, his small eyes burning with frustration. “Corbin, this is a goddamn nightmare,” he growled, his voice bouncing off the wood-paneled walls. “Three bodies, three locked rooms, and you’ve got squat. The mayor’s chewing my ass, and the media’s calling it the ‘Locked Room Murders.’ What’s your angle?”

Corbin rubbed his stubble, his coat dripping onto the floor. “It’s a pattern, Dan. Close-quarters, brutal, but no trace. No struggle. It’s like the victims just… let it happen.”

Hargrove’s scowl deepened, his jowls quivering. “You’re saying they didn’t fight? Three people, all high-profile, just sat there and took it?”

“I’m saying it doesn’t make sense,” Corbin snapped, his voice sharp with fatigue. “No defensive wounds, no mess. The killer’s in their face, personal, but leaves nothing behind. It’s not a hitman. Hitmen don’t linger like this.”

Hargrove crossed his arms, his bulk blocking the light. “Then what, Miles? A vigilante? A psycho with a vendetta?”

“Maybe,” Corbin said, but his gut twisted. “It feels… deliberate. Like a message we’re not reading.”

“Get me something concrete,” Hargrove barked. “The city’s panicking, and I’m not explaining ‘deliberate’ to the press.”

Corbin nodded, his mind churning. He stepped outside, the rain biting his face, and lit a cigarette, the flame flickering in the wind. The estate’s lawn stretched into the darkness, its manicured hedges sculpted into perfect arcs, the gravel crunching under his boots. The smoke curled upward, swallowed by the storm. Three murders, three locked rooms, three impossibly clean scenes. It was wrong, all wrong.

Back at the precinct, Corbin’s office was a claustrophobic cave, its walls plastered with faded memos and coffee stains. The murder board loomed, a chaotic web of photos, red strings, and scribbled notes. Jenkins’ stern face, Vance’s poised elegance, and Sterling’s dignified calm stared back, their lifeless eyes accusing. He pinned up Sterling’s photo—his gray beard neat, his expression twisted in pain—and scrawled: No connection. No motive. No evidence. Precision.

The squad room buzzed, a cacophony of ringing phones and shouted orders. Rain streaked the windows, blurring the city’s neon glow. Corbin gathered his team—Riley, his freckles stark against his pale face, and Detective Sarah Lopez, her dark hair in a tight ponytail, her brown eyes sharp behind her navy blazer. She leaned against a desk, arms crossed, her silver hoop earrings glinting under the fluorescent lights.

“Three victims,” Corbin said, jabbing the board. “Jenkins, businessman. Vance, socialite. Sterling, surgeon. No overlap in their lives, no shared enemies, no obvious motive. The M.O.—close-quarters, violent, clean as a lab. Ideas?”

Lopez tapped her pen against her chin, her voice measured. “Could be a vigilante. Someone targeting high-profile types for a reason we’re missing. The precision screams intent, Miles. It’s not random.”

Corbin shook his head, his coat dripping onto the floor. “If it’s intent, it’s personal. These aren’t drive-bys. The killer’s in their face, but leaves nothing behind. That’s not just skill—it’s… something else.”

Riley shifted, his voice hesitant. “What if it’s psychological? Someone who gets off on the control, the intimacy of it? Like, they’re proving they can get that close and walk away clean?”

Corbin’s eyes narrowed, considering. “Maybe. But why no struggle? No defensive wounds? It’s like they’re paralyzed, or…” He stopped, the word willing hanging in the air, too absurd to voice.

Lopez snorted, her eyebrow arched. “You’re not seriously suggesting they wanted to die, Miles. That’s insane.”

“I’m suggesting we’re missing something,” Corbin said, his voice sharp. “These kills are too perfect. Dig into their lives—deep. Financials, old cases, rumors. If there’s a reason they were chosen, it’s buried.”

Lopez sighed, tossing her pen onto the desk. “You’re chasing shadows, Miles. The killer’s method is the key, not the victims. Focus on how they’re doing this, not why.”

“Both matter,” Corbin shot back, his tone harder than he intended. “We’re blind until we know why these people. Riley, canvass Sterling’s neighbors. Lopez, tear apart his professional life—every patient complaint, every lawsuit, every whisper.”

Riley nodded, scribbling in his notebook, but Lopez rolled her eyes. “You’re obsessed, Miles. This isn’t going to be in their pasts. It’s in the killer’s head.”

“Then prove me wrong,” Corbin said, turning back to the board. Their voices faded as he stared at the photos, patterns flickering in his mind—imagined or real, he couldn’t tell. The violence was too deliberate, too precise, like a ritual he couldn’t decipher.

Later, Corbin met with Dr. Emily Weiss, the department’s profiler, in a cramped conference room that smelled of stale coffee and mildew. Weiss was in her fifties, her silver hair cropped short, her gray suit as no-nonsense as her demeanor. Her blue eyes studied Corbin over a stack of case files, her glasses perched on her nose.

“This killer’s unique,” Weiss said, her voice calm but deliberate, her pen tapping the file. “The intimacy—close-quarters, hands-on—suggests a deep connection to the act. But the absence of trace evidence, the locked rooms… it’s almost performative. They want us to notice the impossibility.”

Corbin leaned back, his chair creaking, his coat still damp. “So, what are we looking at? A psychopath with a magic trick?”

Weiss didn’t smile, her eyes narrowing. “Someone highly controlled, intelligent, with an obsessive need for perfection. The lack of struggle could mean they establish trust or dominance before the kill. They’re not just killing—they’re executing, with a purpose we don’t see yet.”

Corbin’s stomach twisted. “Executing” felt right, but it didn’t explain the how. “Any chance this is personal? Like, they knew the victims?”

“Possible,” Weiss said, adjusting her glasses. “But the lack of connection between victims suggests it’s not personal in the traditional sense. It’s more… ideological. They’re proving something—to themselves, or to us.”

Corbin rubbed his temples, the fluorescent lights buzzing overhead. “So, we’re chasing someone who thinks they’re untouchable.”

“Exactly,” Weiss said, closing her file. “And they’re good at it.”

He thanked her and returned to his office, spreading the crime scene photos across his desk. Jenkins’ blood-soaked shirt, Vance’s bruised throat, Sterling’s shattered ribs—all up close, all personal, all clean. He traced the edges of the photos, his fingers trembling with fatigue. The rain outside was a constant drone, mirroring the static in his mind.

That evening, Corbin visited Sterling’s chief nurse, Margaret Cole, at her modest rowhouse in Canton. The street was narrow, lined with brick homes, their stoops slick with rain. Cole was in her late forties, her blonde hair pulled back, her face lined with worry. She stood in her doorway, a cardigan wrapped around her thin frame, the warm light of her living room spilling out.

“Detective Corbin,” she said, her voice soft but steady. “I saw the news. Dr. Sterling… it’s awful.”

“I need to know about him,” Corbin said, his notepad damp in his hand. “Anything unusual? Enemies, odd behavior?”

Cole shook her head, her eyes distant. “He was a saint. Saved countless lives, especially at his free clinics. Everyone loved him.”

“Everyone?” Corbin pressed, his voice gentle but firm. “No complaints? No rivals?”

She hesitated, her fingers twisting the edge of her cardigan. “Well… there was one thing. A patient, years ago, made accusations—malpractice, I think. It was hushed up, dropped. I never believed it. Dr. Sterling was meticulous.”

Corbin jotted down malpractice with a question mark. “Anything else? Strange visitors, calls?”

“Nothing,” she said, her voice firm. “He was private, kept to himself outside work.”

Corbin thanked her and stepped back into the rain, his cigarette glowing faintly in the dark. A hushed accusation wasn’t much, but it was a thread, thin and fraying. He needed more.

That night, in his sparse apartment, Corbin sat at his kitchen table, the case files a chaotic sprawl under a flickering bulb. The room was stark—peeling paint, a sagging couch, a fridge that groaned like a dying beast. Laura’s photo sat on the coffee table, her smile a fading memory. He pushed it aside and opened Sterling’s file, his eyes scanning the details: locked door, no weapon, no struggle. The TV blared, a news anchor’s voice slicing through: “The ‘Locked Room Murders’ grip Baltimore, with no suspects and a city in fear…”

Corbin lit another cigarette, the smoke curling like a specter. He stared at the files, the victims’ faces blending into one. The killer was out there, moving through the rain, unseen, untouchable. And Corbin, for the first time in his career, felt the world slipping out of his grasp, the rules of logic bending under the weight of something he couldn’t name.

chapter 3.

Baltimore drowned under a relentless downpour, the rain a gray veil that smeared the city’s edges, turning its brick rowhouses and neon signs into ghostly shadows. Detective Miles Corbin stood on a quiet street in Mount Vernon, his trench coat soaked through, clinging to his broad frame like a shroud. His face was a weathered map of exhaustion—high cheekbones shadowed by graying stubble. The townhouse before him was a narrow, three-story relic of old wealth, its sandstone facade pocked by rain, its arched windows glowing faintly against the storm. Police lights pulsed, painting the wet cobblestones in streaks of red and blue, while officers cordoned off the sidewalk, their yellow slickers stark against the gloom.

Inside, Corbin had arrived just in time—a potential victim, Margaret Hensley, a 42-year-old art gallery owner, had narrowly escaped death. A last-minute change of plans had kept her out of her locked studio, the killer’s intended “kill zone.” Corbin trudged through the oak-paneled foyer, the air thick with the scent of turpentine and aged wood. Officer Riley met him at the door, his freckled face pale under his rain-soaked cap, blue eyes darting nervously, sandy hair matted to his forehead.

“She’s shaken, Detective,” Riley said, his voice low over the rain’s steady drum. “Says she was supposed to be here, but a client called her out last minute. Lucky break.”

“Lucky,” Corbin muttered, his jaw tight. “Show me the room.”

The studio was on the third floor, a loft with slanted ceilings and skylights rattling under the storm. Canvases lined the walls, their abstract swirls of color muted in the dim light. A wooden easel stood in the center, a half-finished painting streaked with violent reds. The room was pristine—no signs of forced entry, no scuff marks on the hardwood, but Corbin’s eyes caught something: a faint, almost imperceptible shimmer on the floor near the easel. He crouched, his knees creaking, and squinted—a single, fine thread, no thicker than a spider’s silk, glinting silver in the light. It didn’t belong, not in this sterile space. He signaled a tech to bag it, his gut twisting with the first hint of something tangible.

Dr. Helen Carver arrived, her wiry frame bundled in a raincoat, her graying bob tucked behind her ears. Her green eyes, sharp behind wire-rimmed glasses, scanned the room. “No body this time,” she said, her voice dry. “But the setup’s the same. Locked door, no signs of a break-in. If she’d been here, she’d be like the others—brutal, close-up, clean.”

Corbin stood, his coat dripping onto the floor. “This thread,” he said, pointing. “It’s something. It shouldn’t be here.”

Carver raised an eyebrow. “You’re pinning hopes on a thread? That’s new.”

“It’s all we’ve got,” Corbin snapped, his voice sharper than intended. He felt the cases pressing on him, each one a weight dragging him deeper into the dark.

Downstairs, Margaret Hensley sat in her living room, a high-ceilinged space with velvet drapes and a marble fireplace. She was striking—tall, with sharp cheekbones and jet-black hair swept into a loose bun, her gray eyes wide with shock. Her silk blouse was wrinkled, her hands trembling as she clutched a mug of tea. Corbin sat across from her, his notepad damp in his hand.

“Ms. Hensley,” he began, his voice gentle but firm. “I’m Detective Miles Corbin. You’re lucky to be alive. Tell me what happened.”

She swallowed, her voice shaky. “I was supposed to work late in the studio. I always lock the door—it’s habit. But a client called, needed me to meet them downtown. I left at seven. When I got back, I saw a man leaving.”

“Anyone know your plans?” Corbin asked, his pen scratching. “Anyone who might’ve expected you to be here?”

She shook her head, her fingers tightening on the mug. “No one. I don’t advertise my schedule. The studio’s my sanctuary.”

“Enemies? Threats?” Corbin pressed, his eyes searching her face.

“None,” she said, her voice firm but strained. “I run a gallery, Detective. My world is art, not… this.”

Corbin jotted no enemies with a question mark, his mind racing. He thanked her and stepped outside, the rain cold against his face. He lit a cigarette, the smoke curling into the storm, his eyes fixed on the townhouse’s glowing windows. A near miss, a thread—small, but something. The killer had slipped, just barely.

Back at the precinct, Corbin’s office was a claustrophobic tomb, its walls stained with coffee rings and yellowed memos. The murder board was a chaotic shrine—photos of Jenkins, Vance, Sterling, and now a note for Hensley, marked survivor. Their faces haunted him: Jenkins’ stern silver hair, Vance’s poised elegance, Sterling’s dignified calm. He pinned up a new note: Thread. Silver. Foreign. The board was a tangle of red string and pushpins, a map of his obsession.

The squad room hummed with chaos, phones ringing, officers shouting over keyboards. Rain streaked the windows, blurring the city’s neon glow. Corbin gathered his team—Riley, his freckles stark against his pale face, and Detective Sarah Lopez, her dark hair in a tight ponytail, brown eyes skeptical behind her navy blazer. She leaned against a desk, her silver hoop earrings catching the fluorescent light.

“Three kills, one miss,” Corbin said, jabbing the board. “Jenkins, Vance, Sterling—dead. Hensley, alive, by dumb luck. Same M.O.—locked rooms, close-quarters, clean. Except now we’ve got this.” He held up the evidence bag with the silver thread, its faint shimmer catching the light.

Lopez crossed her arms, her voice sharp. “A thread, Miles? That’s your breakthrough? Could be from anything—her clothes, a canvas.”

“It’s not hers,” Corbin said, his tone low. “It’s too fine, too… strange. And it was right where the killer would’ve stood.”

Riley piped up, his voice hesitant. “What if it’s deliberate? Like, the killer’s taunting us? Leaving a clue to mess with us?”

Corbin’s eyes narrowed. “Or they slipped. Either way, it’s something. Lopez, get it to forensics—priority. Riley, keep digging into Hensley’s life. I want to know why she was targeted.”

Lopez sighed, tossing her pen onto the desk. “You’re still chasing the victims, Miles. The killer’s method is the key. How are they getting in and out?”

“Because the why tells us who,” Corbin shot back, his voice edged with frustration. “These aren’t random. The killer’s choosing them for a reason. Find it.”

Lopez rolled her eyes. “You’re obsessed. This is going to break you.”

“Then let it,” Corbin said, turning back to the board. Their voices faded as he stared at the photos, patterns flickering in his mind—real or imagined, he couldn’t tell. The violence was too precise, too ritualistic, like a code he couldn’t crack.

Later, Corbin met with Dr. Emily Weiss in the precinct’s conference room, a stark space reeking of stale coffee and mildew. Weiss, in her fifties, her silver hair cropped short, sat across from him, her gray suit crisp, her blue eyes studying him over her glasses. Case files were stacked between them, their edges curling.

“This killer’s evolving,” Weiss said, her voice calm but deliberate, her pen tapping the file. “The near miss with Henlsey suggests they’re not infallible. But the method—intimate, controlled, clean—points to someone with an obsessive need for perfection. The thread could be a mistake, or it could be intentional, a signature.”

Corbin leaned back, his chair creaking, his coat still damp. “A signature? You think they want us to find it?”

“Possibly,” Weiss said, her eyes narrowing. “They’re performing. The locked rooms, the absence of struggle—it’s a display of power. They’re proving they can get close, kill, and vanish. The thread might be their way of saying, ‘Look closer.’”

“So, what are we dealing with?” Corbin asked, rubbing his temples. “A genius? A madman?”

“Both,” Weiss said, closing her file. “Someone highly intelligent, disciplined, with a purpose they believe in. The lack of defensive wounds suggests control—either psychological or physical. They’re not just killing; they’re judging.”

Corbin’s stomach twisted. “Judging” felt right, but it didn’t explain the impossible. He thanked Weiss and returned to his office, spreading the crime scene photos across his desk—Jenkins’ blood-soaked shirt, Vance’s bruised throat, Sterling’s shattered ribs, and now Hensley’s empty studio. He stared at the thread’s evidence bag, its silver glint mocking him.

That evening, Corbin visited Hensley’s assistant, Paul Carter, at his apartment in Fells Point. The street was cobblestoned, lined with bars and boutiques, their neon signs buzzing in the rain. Carter was in his thirties, lanky, with shaggy brown hair and nervous green eyes. He stood in his doorway, a flannel shirt untucked, the warm light of his cluttered living room spilling out.

“Detective,” Carter said, his voice unsteady. “Margaret’s okay, right? I saw the news.”

“She’s fine,” Corbin said, his notepad damp. “I need to know about her. Anything unusual? Enemies, odd clients?”

Carter ran a hand through his hair. “She’s tough but fair. Runs the gallery like a general. No enemies I know of. There was… one thing. A collector, maybe a year ago, got angry over a deal—said she cheated him. Threatened to sue, but it fizzled out.”

Corbin scribbled angry collector, his pen scratching loudly. “Anything else? Strange visitors, calls?”

“Nothing,” Carter said, shaking his head. “She’s private. Keeps her work and life separate.”

Corbin thanked him and stepped back into the rain, his cigarette glowing faintly. A hushed lawsuit, a vague threat—it was thin, but it was something. The killer was choosing these people, and Corbin needed to know why.

That night, in his sparse apartment, Corbin sat at his kitchen table, the case files a chaotic sprawl under a flickering bulb. The room was bleak—peeling paint, a sagging couch, a fridge that groaned like a wounded animal. Laura’s photo sat on the coffee table, her smile a fading echo. He pushed it aside and opened Hensley’s file, his eyes scanning the details: locked studio, no break-in, silver thread. The TV blared, a news anchor’s voice cutting through: “The ‘Locked Room Murders’ terrorize Baltimore, with a fourth target narrowly escaping…”

Corbin lit another cigarette, the smoke curling like a specter. Sleep offered no refuge, his dreams haunted by the victims’ vacant eyes and the killer’s invisible hand. The thread was a clue, but it wasn’t enough. The killer was out there, moving through the rain, untouchable, and Corbin felt the world slipping further from his grasp, the line between reality and nightmare blurring with every unanswered question.",1,1752831077.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1m2xryh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1m2xryh/i_supported_my_wife_through_everythingnow_i_feel/,"I supported my wife through everything—now I feel discarded, like my role is over, and I’m just being managed.","First, I should say this is a disposal account since I wanted to be a little bit discrete.

My wife and I are both 36. We’ve been married for 7 years. The first few years were solid—connected, warm, mutually supportive. But over the last 3.5 years, things have slowly fallen apart. Not in any dramatic way, but in a quiet, soul-eroding kind of way. I’ve done my best to stay steady through it all, but I’m starting to feel like I’m disappearing inside this relationship.

During those 3.5 years, everything changed. She gave birth to our child, we moved to a new country, and she lost her father. All major life events, all extremely difficult. And I never once downplayed how hard it was for her. I stood by her—emotionally, physically, financially.

During that time, she also had serious conflict with her mother and siblings. She was deeply hurt by it. My family and I were the ones who supported her. I was careful never to say anything negative about her family, even when her mother made our lives incredibly difficult and left us to carry everything. Ironically, she once got upset with me for not being more outspoken against them—but I thought I was doing the right thing by staying respectful and neutral.

Now that things are slowly getting better—she’s rebuilding her relationship with her mother, and maybe soon with her siblings—I find myself pushed to the sidelines. I’m not against her reconnecting with them. In fact, I want her to have a loving family around her. But it hurts that she can offer them warmth and grace, and treat me like a burden. It feels like I was the support system during the collapse—and now that the storm is clearing, I’ve been quietly set aside.

Outwardly, she’s still kind in a surface-level way. She’ll make coffee, ask what I want for dinner. But the real closeness—the intimacy, the affection, the warmth—is gone. She sleeps with our child, I sleep alone. Our sex life is nearly nonexistent. Every attempt I make to connect physically or emotionally is met with coldness or dismissal. A hug, a simple “good night,” often turns into a sarcastic “Now? Really?”  
It’s degrading. And it breaks my heart.

She’s cheerful and engaged with her friends—even new ones. She laughs, opens up, and brings her full self to those interactions. But with me? I get what’s left over. The silence. The irritation. The exhaustion. I feel like I’m the emotional trash bin where the leftovers of her day go.

She also criticizes me constantly—small, micro-level comments about how I talk, how I move, how I clean. It’s not yelling—it’s erosion. After a while, I start to withdraw. I shut down. I go quiet.  
And then, inevitably, I get blamed for that too:  
“Why don’t you talk?”  
“Why are you so cold?”  
If I try to explain how I feel, she gets defensive. She flips the script. Suddenly I’m the problem again.

There have been moments where she’s told me to shut up. She’s brought up my past or my family in arguments. I always try to stay calm, to not escalate—but inside, those words leave scars.

Financially, it’s been rough. She doesn’t work, so I picked up two jobs. I’ve worked full days, come home, cleaned, cooked, handled bedtime. I did it out of love—not to keep score—but I’d be lying if I said it didn’t hurt to feel so unrecognized.

She once went on a solo trip to visit her mother during a particularly tough financial stretch. I stayed behind, worked two jobs, and took care of our child alone. I didn’t say anything. I wanted her to rest. But later I heard her tell her friends, “I worked so hard learning the language, I deserved that break.”  
No mention of me. Not a word.

Sometimes I feel like I’ve been reduced to a child in her eyes—something to manage, to instruct, to put up with. Not a man. Not a partner.

I don’t think she’s cheating. There are no signs of that. But I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t afraid—**not just of infidelity**, but of how easily I’ve become invisible to the person I gave everything to.  
What if she’s simply done with me and just doesn’t say it?  
What if I was only ever the support she needed in a dark chapter—and now that it’s over, so is my relevance?

I still love her. I still want this to work. But I can’t keep pretending everything is fine while I feel like I’m fading into the walls of my own home. And also, I am really tired of being patient. It is becoming to feel like waiting a train that will never come.

And the truth is—beneath the work, the parenting, the calm exterior—I’m hurting.  
**I need emotional support. I need to feel held, understood, seen.**  
**There’s a part of me—my inner child—curled up in the corner of my soul, in the fetal position, scared and quiet, just waiting for someone to say, “You matter. I’m here.”**  
But that voice doesn’t come.  
And the silence is becoming unbearable.

Is it too much to want affection? Recognition? To be loved—not just helped along or tolerated?

**TL;DR:**  
We’re both 36, married for 7 years. Over the past 3.5 years—after childbirth, moving abroad, and her father’s death—I supported my wife in every way: emotionally, financially (working two jobs), and with childcare and housework. Despite that, I now feel emotionally and physically invisible. She’s warm with friends but cold with me. Constant micro-criticisms push me to withdraw, but when I go quiet, I’m blamed. I’m not afraid of infidelity, but I do feel abandoned. I still love her, but inside, I’m exhausted and hurting—just longing to feel seen, valued, and loved again.",0,1752830999.0,Marriage,4,0.5,False
1m2xry0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1m2xry0/mamas_son/,mama's son,"I’m 23 years old and currently in my final year of university, pursuing a degree in Economics. I was brought up by my mother, a strong woman who raised me on her own with virtually nothing. She didn’t have a government job or a stable income. She worked tirelessly on a tea plantation just to provide for us.

My father, a teacher by profession, left us when I was just two years old. Before walking away, he sold off everything, including the land and property that should have been mine as his only son. Because of that, I have nothing to claim from him today.

After we left, life remained difficult. My mother remarried several times, more than seven, in search of a stable home where I could live and attend school. But each time we began to settle, we’d be asked to leave. It wasn’t because of anything we did wrong. Rather, no one was willing to take responsibility for my education.

I’ve never seen myself as particularly smart, just an average student doing his best.

One turning point came when my mother married her eighth husband. I was in Class Six at the time, and for once, we stayed in that home for over five years. He paid my school fees from Form One through Form Three. But one day, he announced that he could no longer support my education. He began treating me badly, saying cruel things. It felt like the door to my future had slammed shut.

Although he was a respected churchgoer and had even married my mother in church, everything about him changed. He started selling off our household items and borrowing money to feed a drinking habit. We eventually had to leave that house too, realizing there was no future for us there.

Then came another surprising chapter. My mother married again, her ninth husband. He was an older man who had also abandoned his own family. But unlike the others, he valued education. He constantly encouraged me, reminding me to keep going. He paid my remaining high school fees and even covered my first year of university.

Sadly, even that chapter didn’t last. Due to family tensions, we had to leave again.

After that, my mother rented a small house, determined to give me a chance. She now works on a coffee plantation to pay for my university education. Thanks to her sacrifice, I’m about to graduate.

Throughout this entire journey, not a single family member stepped in to help, not even my grandparents. In fact, when we were struggling, some of them seemed happy about it. They didn’t want to see me succeed. Because of that, I’ve cut ties with all of them, including my biological father. I don’t speak to any of them.

The only person I still hold close is my mother. She is my strength, my peace, and the reason I keep moving forward.

One day, I hope to be a better father than the one I had, and when I make it, I dream of buying my mother a Range Rover to thank her for everything she’s done.",18,1752830998.0,Kenya,10,0.95,False

# Home Gardening Tips for Beginners

* **Start Small:** Begin with a few easy-to-grow plants like basil, mint, or marigold. Herbs and sturdy flowers are perfect for new gardeners as they require minimal maintenance.
* **Choose the Right Spot:** Ensure your plants get enough sunlight. Most vegetables and flowers need at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day.
* **Select Quality Soil:** Use nutrient-rich potting mix or compost to give your plants the best start.
* **Water Wisely:** Water your plants early in the morning or late in the evening to reduce evaporation. Avoid over-watering—check soil moisture before adding more.
* **Use the Right Pots:** Good drainage is vital. Pick pots with holes at the bottom to prevent waterlogging and root rot.
* **Learn About Your Plants:** Read the care tags or do quick research for each species’ needs regarding sunlight, water, and spacing.
* **Stay Consistent:** Check on your plants daily for signs of pests or disease, and prune dead leaves for healthy growth.
* **Compost Kitchen Waste:** Utilize vegetable scraps and coffee grounds to create homemade compost, enriching your soil naturally.

# Best maple Powder 2025: Sweeten Smarter!

Maple powder is quickly becoming a staple in kitchens around the world, thanks to its versatility and intensely delicious flavor. Unlike traditional maple syrup, maple powder offers a concentrated sweetness and unique textural element that works beautifully in both sweet and savory dishes. this review explores the best maple powders available in 2025, helping you make an informed decision and elevate your culinary creations. Beyond just a sweetener, maple powder can be used in rubs, glazes, baked goods, and even beverages to add a distinctive maple flavor.

## Key Features Analysis

The best maple powders distinguish themselves thru purity, flavor intensity, texture, and versatility.It's essential to delve into these features to understand the differences between products and choose one that aligns with your specific needs.

**Purity and Origin:**

High-quality maple powder should ideally consist of 100% pure maple syrup that has been dehydrated into a fine powder. The origin of the maple is also significant; maple from regions known for superior maple syrup production, like Vermont or Quebec, signifies higher quality.Check for certifications like organic or non-GMO to ensure that the product meets your standards for responsible sourcing and purity. The absence of additives, fillers, or artificial flavors is paramount in discerning a premium maple powder.

**Flavor Profile and Intensity:**

The flavor profile of maple powder can vary depending on the grade of maple syrup used in its production. Lighter grades, like Golden Color with Delicate Taste (formerly Grade A Golden Color), tend to have a more subtle and refined flavor, while darker grades such as dark Color with robust Taste (formerly Grade A Dark Amber) offer a bolder, more intense maple flavor with caramel notes. Consider your intended use when evaluating the flavor profile; a subtle powder is better for delicate pastries, while a robust one is best for barbecue rubs.**Texture and Consistency:**

A great maple powder should have a fine, consistent texture that dissolves easily and evenly when incorporated into foods or liquids. Look for powders that are free from clumps or granules, as these can indicate poor processing or moisture absorption. The ideal consistency allows the powder to blend seamlessly, ensuring a smooth, even distribution of maple flavor throughout your dish. Some manufacturers may add anti-caking agents, so always read the ingredient list if you prefer 100% pure maple powder.

**Solubility and Versatility:**

The solubility of maple powder is crucial for its versatility in various culinary applications. High-quality powders should dissolve readily in both hot and cold liquids without leaving a gritty residue. This makes them ideal for sweetening beverages, blending into smoothies, or creating smooth sauces and glazes. Versatility also extends to its suitability for both sweet and savory dishes,from enhancing baked goods to adding depth to meat rubs.

**packaging and Shelf Life:**

Consider the packaging of the maple powder, as it affects the product's longevity. Airtight containers minimize moisture absorption and maintain the powder's quality over time. Check the expiration date, as maple powder, like any natural product, can lose its flavor over time. Resealable packaging is also a plus, as it helps to preserve freshness after opening.

## Core Benefits

Maple powder offers a range of benefits that extend beyond its delicious flavor. From its ability to enhance recipes to its potential health advantages, choosing maple powder can elevate your culinary experience.

**enhanced Flavor Profile:** Maple powder delivers a concentrated burst of maple flavor, transforming ordinary dishes into culinary delights. Unlike granulated sugar, maple powder imparts a distinctive warmth and complexity that complements both sweet and savory ingredients. For example, dusting maple powder over roasted vegetables adds a touch of sweetness and depth, while incorporating it into a chocolate cake intensifies the overall richness.

**Natural Sweetener Alternative:** As a natural and unrefined sweetener, maple powder provides a healthier alternative to processed sugars and artificial sweeteners. made from pure maple syrup, it retains some of the minerals and antioxidants found in the sap. While it should still be consumed in moderation, maple powder offers a more nutritious option for those looking to reduce their refined sugar intake.

**Ease of Use and Storage:** Maple powder's ease of use and convenient storage make it a practical addition to any kitchen. Its powdered form allows for precise measurements and effortless blending into recipes. Unlike liquid maple syrup, maple powder won't crystallize or become sticky, making it easier to handle and store. Its compact size also saves valuable pantry space and contributes to keeping a cleaner cooking habitat.

**Versatile Culinary Applications:** Maple powder shines in its versatility, suitable for a wide array of culinary uses. It can be easily incorporated into baked goods, such as cookies, muffins, and breads, adding both sweetness and a moist, tender texture. It serves as an outstanding addition to savory dishes, such as rubs for meats, glazes for poultry, and seasonings for vegetables. Additionally, it can be used to sweeten beverages like coffee, tea, and smoothies, providing a distinct maple flavor without the added liquid.

## FAQs Section

Consumers often have questions regarding the use, storage, and nutritional details of maple powder. Having clear answers to these common queries builds trust and ensures informed decision-making.

**how do you store maple powder to maintain its quality?**
To maintain the quality of your maple powder, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Moisture is the enemy of maple powder, causing it to clump and possibly spoil. If you live in a humid environment, consider adding a desiccant packet to the container to absorb any excess moisture. Properly stored maple powder can last for several years without significant loss of flavor or quality.

**Can maple powder be used as a one-to-one replacement for granulated sugar?**
while maple powder can frequently enough be used as a substitute for granulated sugar, it's essential to consider its flavor intensity and moisture content. As a general rule, you can start by substituting 3/4 cup of maple powder for every 1 cup of granulated sugar, and adjust to your liking. Keep in mind that maple powder has a distinctive flavor, so it may slightly alter the overall taste of your dish. Reducing the amount of liquid in your recipe is also significant, as maple powder doesn't add moisture in the same way as granulated sugar.

**Is maple powder gluten-free and vegan?**
Yes, pure maple powder is naturally gluten-free and vegan, making it suitable for individuals with dietary restrictions. Though, it's always essential to check the product label to ensure that there are no added ingredients or cross-contamination during processing. Look for certifications like ""Gluten-Free"" or ""Certified Vegan"" to provide extra assurance.

Maple powder offers some nutritional advantages over refined sugar, though it should still be used in moderation.It contains trace amounts of minerals like manganese, zinc, and potassium, which refined sugar lacks. Additionally, maple powder has a slightly lower glycemic index than refined sugar, meaning it may cause a slower rise in blood sugar levels. However, it's important to remember that maple powder is still a form of sugar and should be part of a balanced diet.

I have two options as I see it:

A.) On one hand I think going to school to eventually become a neuroscientist would be fufilling as I could finally do research on theories I have on conciousness. In this parallel version of myself I would use my time to upgrade all aspects of my life such as socializing more, joining clubs, sports, developing hobbies, publishing research, etc. My time would basically be accounted for from wake to sleep, and speaking of sleep, I'll eventually lose the ability to remember what that word even means. But I'd be servicing the world in a way that would make my brain happy.

I'm so interested in psychology and functions of the brain and how dreams work. The brain controls everything we've ever done as a humanity and continue to do so it's so important to understand. The diversity of my degree would set me up for life potentially, and I could get positions in establishments that would be a dream to work with. Every part of my life would pretty much be work-centered but all for the betterment of achieving goals I've had for ages. Every moment I spend not locking in or self-improving feels like a moment wasted, but having this type of lifestyle, would give me no reason to feel guilty. I've always been that person that wants to be 3,600 people in one lifetime: the cool friend, the mom friend, the energetic bubbly friend, the rich friend, the boho friend, etc. So I guess, to sum it up, if I get everything checked off my list I can at least say that I've done it, and I can be proud of feeling discontent with my life now and working every day to never feel like that again.

B.) Don't go to college and spend my time traveling in an rv instead. I'd have time to wake up whenever I want, go to bed whenever I want, eat whenever I want, basically do however much of whatever I want. This version of me would be a calm minimalist with a huge focus on present needs and not future goals. It doesn't have to be van life either, just some simple pleasures type of life that would be accepting the person I am today instead of making my life the biggest project I will ever work on. And I'd be servicing the world in a way that would make my heart happy.

Something in the back of my head is heart-palpitatedly scared of option a. Maybe partly because of current low self-esteem, but there is a much larger fear at play here. Wasting my youth on playing the game just like I did when I was in highschool. I don't think that any of these accolades or new clothes or distractions outside of myself matter. I don't want to have to reprogram years of social conditioning AGAIN as I'm only now recovered from the horrors of my 12+ years in the school system as a former ""gifted kid."" I'm scared of losing the part of me that dreams and is open-minded and likes to be spontaneous and doesn't have any debt or major responsibilities and can go and do anything she wants because of that and who's not jaded and slightly naive and optimistic and has time to chill with loved ones for hours and not some sloppy rushed 10-minute coffee chat. Maybe I can do both?

I think just writing it down has given me a clear right answer. Any advice though?

- Are the A4Z and Pietro better enough compared to the ZP6 to justify the extra £200 on the pricetag?

After searching online for co-working spaces near me, I found somewhere that was free and in a great location. I booked a spot and made my way over the following day. 

When I arrived the girl at the door looked confused about why I was there, and after some awkward explaining, I was eventually led through to what can only be described as a booth so far away it might as well have been in another postcode.

I sat down and was told  that someone would be over to take my order shortly, so I thought great - a nice coffee and I can crack on with some good work. 45 minutes passed with no order taken. I wouldn't have minded if it was a packed restaurant, but there were maybe 3 tables of 2 occupied and more staff than customers. Talk about catfished. Looked nothing like the pictures online.

Eventually I gave up on the whole 'ordering' concept and figured I'd just treat it like the free co-working space it was advertised as and dive into my work. 

Little did I know, the ordering situation was just the beginning of my problems…

I opened my laptop and started tackling my usual routine - checking emails, updating social media posts, working on some design stuff, spreadsheets. 

Nothing too demanding, or so I thought. 

Every 20 minutes like clockwork, the wifi would just give up on life entirely. 

I'd be mid vlookup when suddenly I'm staring at that dreaded ""not connected"" message. I spent more time reconnecting to their network than actually working. What should have been a productive day turned into a constant battle with their wifi.

By hour five, sitting in that booth had taken its toll. 

The seating wasn't designed for long work sessions, and I found myself constantly shifting around trying to get comfortable.

My back was killing by the time I left, and I was in pain for a few days afterwards.

Guess it’s my own fault -  you get what you pay for.

Rant over.

hey jaipur fam 👋

not one of those co-founder hunting or startup help posts (though tbh, i do need some of that too 😅). this one's a bit more personal.

so quick intro... i’m 21, shifting to jaipur from germany in early august for about a year. i’ll be working on a couple of projects and also joining jecrc for bba, mostly for networking and to keep my brain active on both ends (bookish + business 😬). heading back to germany around june next year, so really wanna make the most of this year.

work-wise, mon to sat will be packed... but i’m keeping sundays (and maybe the occasional saturday night) totally free to chill, explore the city, meet new people, try good food, vibe and unwind, do some random shopping (major help needed with clothes, shoes, perfumes — my sense is zero 🤦‍♂️), or just go on long walks, café hopping, bike rides, whatever.

i don’t drink or smoke... but i’m cool with folks who do, as long as it’s not around me (dust/smoke allergy 😅).

now here’s the thing... i hardly know anyone in jaipur. my brother-in-law lives there but he’s always tied up. rest of my family’s in germany, and i’m not really in touch with extended fam here.

so just putting it out there... if you’re from jaipur (or moving there soon) and down to hang out, vibe, share stories, take short trips every 2-3 months, maybe play a bit of badminton (i’m a noob but i enjoy it), or just chill over coffee, books or random convos... would love to connect 😊

age doesn’t matter, but ya i’m 21... so if you’re somewhere around that, even better. just looking for good folks with chill, sensible vibes... grounded, hygienic (plz 😭), and not the loud ""i’m the king of the world"" energy 😅 no offence to anyone, but i really prefer humble, balanced people. you can have the world and still be calm, you know?

currently in my hometown with my mom... she’s heading back to germany in august, and i’ll be in jaipur around the 3rd or 4th. if this sounds like your kinda vibe, drop a comment or dm. would be super sweet to have a few people to call up on a sunday and say... “chal, let’s go somewhere.”

and if i’ve said anything wrong or it came out weird... super sorry in advance, no bad intent🙏

It is not the first time I have brought it up. We have had conversations in the past where I shared things I learned in school about water shortages where we live. I have also shared a book on the matter before in the past. For further context, she once flooded the bathroom so badly that it leaked through the floor and caused water damage below. I want to add that even given the circumstances, I rarely comment on the usage to begin with as I know I cannot change a person, merely point out things that can be worked on. But this isn’t the main focus, just context. 

The comment I made this time had some attitude, and I fully acknowledge that. Later, she texted me asking me not to comment on her water usage anymore. I told her I could not agree to that because environmental issues are something I care deeply about and I wanted to be able to speak on it if it was relevant in the future. I explained my reasoning and left it there.

Since then, I have not brought up her water usage again. However, after that conversation, she gave me the silent treatment for a month and a half. She ignored my greetings, did not speak to me at family gatherings, and skipped a joint graduation celebration for me and our younger brother to go to a coffee shop with our other sister. The other sister later apologized when I told her how much it hurt me.

What confuses me is that my sister never explained she considered her request a boundary at the time. She never said, “If you do not stop, I will stop speaking to you.” She simply asked me to stop, I said no with explanation, and she went silent. It was not until almost two months later, after our parents and other sister pressured her to speak to me, that she said she felt her boundary had been disrespected.

I did apologize for my attitude in the initial comment because I did not intend to hurt her feelings. But I do not feel I was wrong for explaining my position at the time, especially since she only framed it as a boundary long after the fact.

AITA for refusing her request in the moment and for not treating it as a boundary when she only called it that much later?

Edit: Commenting on the text messages. I was waiting for a comment about the text screenshots. The rules of the sub said no screenshots. And I was worried about one rule saying not to comment on crossposts since I have not ever posted to this sub before. 

I previously posted to a different subreddit with text messages of the aftermath of this but my main concern is the actual action and original event but as it detracts from the actual issue I am wondering about, I left it out. 

To address the text messages in case it is brought up, I do realize I did not communicate as well as I should have and the points I was making about my sisters behavior towards me and others around her was muddling the main point in what I was trying to say. I did send her a reply apologizing for adding the extra shit on top of everything else. It was not the right time for all of that.",1,1752828830.0,AmItheAsshole,10,0.57,False

Too many options, half of them look sketchy, and everyone swears they’re “the one.” So, after wasting enough time doom-scrolling Reddit threads and reading review sites that feel like they were written by bots, I decided to test something for myself.

Enter [https://papersroo.com/](https://papersroo.com/?utm_source=posttest&utm_medium=252). Yeah, I hadn’t heard of them either. But here’s the thing — I actually tried them. And spoiler alert: they’re not just some rando site trying to make a quick buck.

# What Is PapersRoo and Why Should You Care?

PapersRoo is one of those online academic writing services that aims to help students with essays, research papers, coursework, and all the chaos in between. Unlike some other ""top rated essay writing services"" that just throw AI paragraphs at you and hope for the best, this one actually tries to get things right.

* Turnitin-safe papers  
* Support from real humans (not just chatbots pretending to “escalate your issue”)

# Step-by-Step: How Ordering Works (Without Losing Your Sanity)

One of the things that separates [the best college paper writing services](https://papersroo.com/?utm_source=posttest&utm_medium=252) from the “please never again” list is the ordering process. Here’s how it went on PapersRoo:

1. **Pick your paper type.** Essay, research paper, report, lab, you name it. I went with a 6-page argumentative essay.  
2. **Add the details.** Topic, formatting style (APA, MLA, etc.), deadline. You can even upload your professor’s unhinged instructions as a file.
3. **Choose your writer level.** Basic, advanced, or top. I picked advanced — didn’t want to be too broke, but still wanted someone who knew how to spell.
4. **Secure payment.** No shady redirects or pop-ups. PayPal, credit card — the usual suspects.
5. **Track progress & chat.** You can talk directly to support. 
6. **Download the final version.** Delivered on time. And yes, it passed Turnitin.

# What Could Be Better?

No service is perfect (except maybe coffee). Some things to keep in mind:

* Prices aren’t the lowest — but hey, you get what you pay for
* UI is clean but not flashy. Function > form. It works, but don’t expect bells and whistles
* They don’t do voiceovers for presentations (yet)  

# Is It the Best Essay Writing Service? Depends.

I’ve used a few of [the top rated essay writing services](https://papersroo.com/?utm_source=posttest&utm_medium=252) before — some were straight-up scams, others just... meh.

Office starts at 9 and she came at around 10.30 when she came i was stunned while looking at her she came and greeted her team members (She was a Team Lead, and mee too) so yeah i looked at her and i was kind of lost i liked her before but when i saw her i loved her. She smells heavenly like soo good whenever she passes or come nearby i immediately know its her and she's been working in this company for past 10 months and I've been working for 3-4 months. I saw her talking and laughing with her friends (2 Males around her age) and got jealous at first i thought he's her Boyfriend that's why i never initiated anything. And the manager of the company the HR like almost everyone wants her like it was that obvious.

So after almost 2 months of just seeing her one day when i was working and she skyped me ""Hey"" and i was shocked like how why i had soo many questions in my mind and after a minute or two of thinking i replied ""Hello"" and she said ""How are you?"" i was like what is this seriously happening and i replied with ""I'm good how are you?"" and she said ""send me your work report"" and i was like oh that's what she wants so i gave her my team's work report and she used to ask me this every Saturday. So one Saturday she said give me your work report and i responded with ""Your wish is my command"" and she was like oh dialogues and this that and after that we talked for hours while working i was focused on her. She used to sit on the 2nd room and i work in the 1st room and while talking she's like you're making me blush don't do this, we're at work etc.., so we talked a lot and on the second day she looked at me and smiled while passing through my desk and i smiled back, and i came to know a lot about her and her past.

So she(lets call her Mia) was in like 3 relationships before one when she was in school and she said that was not a proper relationship but Mia counts it as relationship, and second one when she was in college that ended because the guy has to leave the city and go somewhere else to work but she didn't want a long distance so she broke up with him and she told me that he left the job for her and he was crying while talking and the third one that lasted for 2 years she got cheated on, he had sex with some other girl and told the other girl that their relationship is not going well, Mia doesn't care about him etc., so the other girl called Mia and said ""Hello is this John(Mia's boyfriend) Ex"" and she said were in a relationship what do you mean Ex, so the girl that john had sex with told Mia everything and she was broken, Mia told me she was fully sure about John that they'll marry each other and they did almost everything together but after she confronted John with the girl he cheated on he didn't say anything and after that John's sister called her and asked for the money that John spend on her in the past 2 years and she was like crying all the time they asked for around 500 USD after calculating everything including the gym fees, travel expenses, and some gifts that's it and she also spend money on him but she didn't asked for it so yeah, that's her past and now back to the present.

So after talking for a week or two i knew almost everything about her, and Mia used to say she feels different with me, Mia said i never talk to anyone this easy, and she's obsessed with my height and my Back (I'm 6'2 With good physique) one day i was filling my water bottle and when i was about to enter she came in front of me and she saw me and she blushed and after that she texted me You're soo tall, your back is so good this that and after a week or two we were ready to get physical but she wants me get my friend's room not a hotel so we waited for a week more and i got my friend's room and i asked her will she come and she said yes. So she came we got physical and after that we went on our first date i bought a bouquet of orchids that she loved she hates red color and i started to do so i really got into her. And after that we went to my friend's room almost thrice every week. She said she likes to spend time with me she feels safe, i cook for her i massage her that she loves and cuddles that's it, so that's how our 2 months passed. After that my friend left the city so we started booking hotel rooms, once we went daily for a week and she says that's the best week of her life. after 2 months of seeing each other she left the job and the office workers, the HR. the manager everyone kind of knew about her and me seeing each other. She didn't want anyone to know about it but still how much can you hide, they kind of knew so they all were after me they gave me more work and this that so i left the job as well. And we started going out almost daily. So that's the good part for me and now let's move to things that i don't like.

So we shared reels and that too somewhat inappropriate to share with anyone else except me and she shared those reels with the HR, and her friends. And i confronted her about it and she said it's just a reel what's the big deal about it and i really got upset. She has this one friend of her(let's call him Leo) so once we were eating and we were watching reels on her phone and whenever a good reel appear she immediately shares it with Leo and i asked is it compulsory to share everything with him like why? And she said why are you so insecure about him, he's just my friend a very good friend, were different , were friend in both happiness and sorrow and like that so i was frustrated and what she used to do is she just stop talking to me, stops picking up my calls or replying to anything i say , she did this thing for almost 4-5 times and once she didn't talked to me for 3 days straight and i was like messaging her calling her she was not replying or doing anything and what she wants is a boy who's behind her let her do whatever she wants and yeah basically that. she shared reels with me which says if u see me again with a man just know that he worshipped the ground that i walked in, this that, she says she wanna go to a beach and post bikini pictures on Instagram and this that, i wanna do this i wanna do that, she don't know how to cook, what she do everyday is watch reels and go out whether it'll be with me or her friends that's basically just boys. 

And she asks when are you gonna propose to me this that and she says if you were of my age we'd get married within 6 months or so. She says lets get married soon i don't wanna live here with my parents cuz they're a bit strict. She says i wanna go abroad and work there, start a new life I'm bored of this one etc, I say just wait for me to complete my masters and then we'll go somewhere far together she says i don't know how to cook i said I'll cook for us, she's very lazy she sleeps at around 1 A.M and wake up at around 11 A.M when her mother comes to wake her up and still she says she wanna sleep more. I read, learn, exercise, pray, do everything while making time for her i always message her after some time hello babe, what are you doing this that and she says why do u wanna talk to me all day this that and arguments and she at the end she's like go find someone else, you're better off with someone your age who wants to talk to you all the time, and do lovely things for you this thing she says all the time.

And recently she wanted to go somewhere with me and i prepared for it i got the basic essentials to go there and the night before she says that her dad's not allowing her to go there and after some time she asked me babe can i go to that place with my friends, they're going there and i wanna go there as well so i said okay but that's the place we wanted to go together so she said we'll go sometime else I'll go with my friends this time and lemme ask my parents about it and they agreed this time so when she was leaving she wanted my windcheater and my jacket to wear so i gave it to her and told her send me short videos of the ones you're going with and keep me updated. firstly she said I'll you once I'm back home i said no keep me updated and show me with whom you're going so she agreed and left. after an hour i texted her did u leave where are you hello?? and she replied we're sitting here having coffee i said okay show me whom you're with so she was like I'm with this guys this guy this guy this girl and i said show me and she didn't so i was worried and i thought she was just with the boys and she said she'll be sitting with a girl and i asked whom are u sitting with she said a guy's name and i was like you told me you'll sit with a girl and this that so yeah and after that she ignored my texts and this that after she came home she yelled at me that you don't trust me i was keeping you updated when she was clearly not and she said everyone was having fun i was texting you this that and after that she said i regret to be with you I'll block you this that but she didn't, and she stopped talking for a day again and i was the one saying sorry this that. That's just one argument there's a lot.

And she went with her best friend to help him to buy clothes for him cuz she has good fashion sense, and after that day she posted a story on Instagram saying "" Just me him and our weird playlist against the world"" , before also she posted both of them saying ""A day out with my Favourite human"" and when i say that just post why are you saying these things and so, and like always she's like he's my good friend you don't understand our bond. We share a good bond and she said this to another guy as well like what am i supposed to do I really love her and i already told her i don't care about anything else just be in limits with your friend. And she's like you have bad mentality I'm open minded you can have girl best friends as well i don't mind this that. and i literally don't even talk to anyone else except her and she knows that as well. 

Sometimes she's like she's really into me and the second later she's completely different she says she'll marry me this that she don't share the same bond she share with me to someone else this that am i supposed to just ignore that i feel uncomfortable when she's with her friend. My main concern is that they're boys and i can't trust them, she told me that one of her friend said if you were in a relationship with me you wouldn't get cheated on and once he grabbed her waist while she's driving and she told me that she said don't touch me like that or whatever but she still goes out with him.

I paid the money required but the cashier at that time said the money wasn't recieved so we need to pay again. However the money was deducted from my account. My friend paid the next time. I asked when will I receive the refund, she said 10 minutes. Later then we visited another cafe in 35 and spent a good two hours there. On our way back I checked for refund but I did not receive any. So I went to TH again to ask about it. The same cashier, she gave me her number. I waited for two weeks but no refund. I called the woman, she just replied with okay, but the month of April went by still nothing. Thaat woman stopped answering my texts and my calls. Yesterday, we went to ovenfresh, so I remembered about my refund and thought about talking to the staff. The staff? My God was so rude. We were polite throughout the situation but the manager? He said you can have a coffee but I'm not paying any refund. I said I'm here for a refund I don't want a coffee. But he kept on fighting with me and his conduct throughout was bad. I asked him to call that woman, she started lying lol. When I showed all the proofs, she started making excuses of the world. The manager however just wouldn't stop being rude, he said file a complaint, take a photo of me and file it. Tired of it I said just give me a coffee to compensate the price. He later then started insisting ""ma'am, please don't complain about me"" I said ""that's up to me"". He panicked and started calling people and explaining the situation to them. He gave me the coffee, which I had to throw because the milk almost smelled spoiled, it had no sugar. And I left.

The previous manager called me and apologized on his behalf. I will most definitely not be visiting TH again ever",12,1752828319.0,Chandigarh,17,0.88,False
1m2x25c,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiehackers/comments/1m2x25c/im_the_creator_of_indiekit_pro_heres_how_it/,I'm the creator of IndieKit Pro — Here's how it compares to ShipFast (and why devs switch),"I'm the developer behind **IndieKit Pro**, a production-grade boilerplate for SaaS. A lot of people ask how it compares to **ShipFast**, so here’s a quick breakdown from my side — respectfully.

# ShipFast is great for launching fast

ShipFast is solid if you're aiming to get an MVP out quickly. I genuinely appreciate what it offers. Feels like a pre-built landing page, with login that’s it. Costs your week’s coffee budget.

But many developers switch to IndieKit Pro when they start scaling and hit limitations.

# What IndieKit Pro includes

* Stripe + Lemon Squeezy + lifetime deal support
* Multi-tenant B2B (orgs, roles, invites)
* Admin impersonation
* Usage quotas and plan upgrades
* Email flows, onboarding, and waitlist
* 1-on-1 mentorship
* Regular updates

These are features designed for founders building beyond launch.

Kept it affordable for people who have just started.

# Why I built it

I kept rebuilding the same systems — Stripe logic, org management, admin tools — for every project. So I created something that could be reused, maintained, and supported properly.

If ShipFast helps you launch, IndieKit Pro helps you grow with fewer roadblocks.

Happy to answer questions or chat more. No shade to ShipFast — we’re just focused on different stages of the journey.",0,1752828187.0,indiehackers,0,0.5,False
1m2wzxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1m2wzxr/poor_management/,Poor management,"This post is somewhat loosely connected to my last one. Nothing else happened surrounding that situation, but a lot of people pointed out the obvious issues with management here. So, since you’ve given me the opportunity, I’ll give you more examples so I can rant lol 

-This is a smaller one, but the owner doesn’t allow the front desk to use cleaning products. I’ve genuinely gotten in trouble for using *soap.* Only water. I mop with hot water from the coffee machine, it really just moves streaks around. 

-We do not require cards on file, which is absolutely insane to me. Especially because this place is a shithole. I used to get frustrated at my old place when people would whine about the card policy, because what hotel doesn’t require one? Now I work at one

-Problem guests are *frequently* given free passes on bad behavior if they pay on time. The best example of this was a guest who stayed here for *6 months* who was clearly mentally unwell, who would sit outside and shout the worst kind of slurs you can think of (yes, even that one) at other guests. Sometimes, even people’s children. He got into several verbal/physical altercations once. The police were only called on him once, and my coworker *got in trouble* for calling them. He was allowed a free pass because he paid $700 mystery dollars every Tuesday. He was only finally kicked out because 3 people cancelled over his behavior in the same week. Again, this is only one example. I have more. 

-We only take deposits from locals and only if we deem them sketchy. This was “expanded” after the story in my previous post, to include *all* locals (still not everyone) however, my coworkers have already made exceptions for several people they “didn’t think would cause problems” so that seems to have immediately gone out the window. 

-This one just has to do with me, but it’s valid I think. My schedule is ridiculous. Tuesday I work mornings, Wed-Thurs afternoon, and Fri-Sat audit. If he just scheduled us the way every other hotel ever scheduled the desk I wouldn’t have to live like a sleepless monster. 

-We don’t have a laundry person. We don’t have a houseman. We only have 3 housekeepers. The breakfast girl works 7 days a week. He refuses to hire more people because it’s been a very slow year for him (gee I wonder why) and he doesn’t want to dip into his precious profits.

-The GM never tries to make the owner listen to reason. She actually does a fair bit of work herself for a manager. She works the desk several mornings a week, she does laundry some days for the time being because we don’t have anyone. Some days she has to juggle both at once. Even though she knows the issues we experience at the desk, she doesn’t stand up for any of the FD staff. She’ll write us up for things she acknowledges are totally unfair, but do it anyways.

-I’ve been working here going on 7 months now and there are still things no one has shown me how to do. I work mornings on Tuesdays, but I have no idea how to general a housekeeping list. Sure my GM usually does it, but what if she’s sick one week? What if she trades a shift? Every time staff needs a keycard reset, she just fixes it for me. She never shows me how she did it, same issue as before, what will I do if she’s not around to help me out one day? I have no clue where certain things are in storage, if a guest needs soap or anything of the like and I’m out at the desk, I have zero clue where to find more. 

I could *clearly* go on for the rest of my night, but I’ll spare you guys more of my whining. If you’re at all interested, I could make another post with more of my complaints lol. 

Also, yes, I’m looking for a new job. I can’t just quit, I just got a new apartment and I need to make rent my friends. I’ve had a frustratingly hard time finding a new job recently, I’ve *never* struggled this much to find employment. Not to brag but I’ve only ever had 2 interviews that didn’t turn into jobs, I’m not sure when I suddenly became so unhirable. ",6,1752827939.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,2,1.0,False

Why You Should Hit Me Up: If you're tired of swiping left on boring bios and are ready to dive into the weird and wonderful world of genuine connections, then let's chat! Who knows, we might just discover we're both secretly wizards or have a shared passion for collecting campervan money boxes.

I'm Arron, 24, from the Northwest. First and foremost, I’m looking for a relationship. Something real, affectionate, and built on trust.  
I'm generally quiet, shy, and nerdy. I really enjoy anything technical or creative. I spend a lot of time messing around with programming projects, usually making small games or tools that never really go anywhere, but I enjoy the process.

I’m into gaming (mostly on PC), cooking, baking, and getting into new hobbies for a little while until I burn out on them. Sometimes it’s DIY stuff, sometimes it’s tech-related projects.

Personality-wise, I’m an INTP-T. Bit of an overthinker. I’m introverted and value time alone, but I want to share that time with someone I care about. I connect best with people who are laid-back but passionate about the things they enjoy.

**Appearance:**

In terms of appearance, I’m 6'1"", white, with a broad build and some fat. I have short hair, a beard, and blue eyes. I'm not slim, but I’m working on it. My one goal is to get visible abs. For full transparency, I have some loose skin from weight loss. I’d like to get it removed someday, but right now it’s just a reminder of how far I’ve come and the effort I’ve put in.

Please don’t feel like you need to tick every box here. This is just a rough idea of the kind of person I think I'd work well with.

1m2wylg,https://www.reddit.com/r/juvenology/comments/1m2wylg/inflammaging_and_your_skin_how_to_reduce/,Inflammaging and Your Skin: How to Reduce Inflammation,"# The Hidden Culprit: Inflammaging

What if the real culprit of your skin issues isn’t your skincare routine, but something deeper called **inflammaging**? It’s a slow, sneaky fire of chronic inflammation that quietly speeds up ageing from the inside out.

Think of inflammaging like a smouldering ember that never quite goes out. Unlike quick, helpful inflammation like the kind that rushes to heal a cut, this low-level, persistent inflammation lingers beneath your skin and inside your body.

Over time, it chips away at your cells, breaking down the collagen and elastin that keep your skin firm and plump. It also raises the risk of serious health issues like heart disease and arthritis.

This hidden process is what scientists call **chronic inflammation and ageing**, a key reason our skin and bodies show signs of ageing the way they do.

# Here’s the Good News

Once we understand inflammaging, we can fight back.

In this article, I’ll walk you through:

* **The science behind this hidden fire**
* **How it affects your skin and overall health**
* **Easy lifestyle changes and professional treatments that calm inflammation**

Whether you’re curious about **anti-inflammatory treatments for ageing skin** or how to naturally reduce inflammaging, stick with me.

This guide will help you feel empowered, informed, and ready to take control of your skin and wellbeing.

# The Science Behind Inflammaging

You’ve probably noticed how your skin or joints get red, swollen, or tender when you’ve got a cut or a cold. That’s called **acute inflammation**, and it’s your body’s superhero, rushing in to heal fast and protect you.

But inflammaging? That’s a different story.

Imagine a tiny campfire inside you, not the kind you sit around and toast marshmallows by, but an ember that never quite goes out.

It’s there day after day, quietly wearing down your cells and tissues, long after the obvious injuries have healed.

I often tell my clients:

>*“It’s like having a little invisible fire burning inside you that you can’t see or feel until one day, you notice your skin feels rougher or your joints ache more than they used to.”*

# Why Does Inflammaging Happen?

As we age, our immune system becomes a bit like a tired security guard, less quick to switch off the alarms once the danger has passed.

Then there are these ageing cells called senescent cells, think of them as “zombie” cells that refuse to leave the party.

They moan out inflammatory SOS signals, keeping the inflammation going.

And don’t forget your mitochondria, the tiny energy factories in your cells.

As they get older, they sometimes produce harmful molecules that act like gasoline on that little fire, fuelling inflammaging even more.

Put it all together, and you get:

* **A slow, persistent inflammation**
* **Constantly wearing down your cells**
* **Fuelling the ageing process from within**

# What Does This Mean for Your Health?

Ever wondered why:

* **Your energy dips?**
* **Your skin loses its glow?**
* **Your joints start to creak more than they used to?**

This hidden inflammation might be why.

Inflammaging isn’t just about wrinkles and sagging skin. It’s linked to serious health issues like:

* **Heart disease**
* **Arthritis**
* **Alzheimer’s**
* **Type 2 diabetes**

That’s why calming inflammation isn’t just a longevity tip, it’s a powerful way to feel healthier and more vibrant at any age.

# The Visible Signs You Can’t Ignore

Ever catch yourself thinking, *“Why does my skin feel so different lately?”*

You’re not alone. Many of my clients tell me this exact thing.

What’s really happening? Inflammaging, that sneaky chronic inflammation is quietly breaking down collagen and elastin, the two superheroes that keep your skin firm, bouncy, and glowing.

Without them, your skin starts to lose its snap-back power. It’s like your skin’s elastic band is stretching out and not quite snapping back anymore.

I often hear clients say things like:

>*“My skin feels like it’s throwing a tantrum, reacting to everything and refusing to behave.”*

# What Does This Feel Like?

You might notice:

* **Rough or uneven skin texture (like sandpaper where you used to be smooth)**
* **Increased dryness or sensitivity (hello, unexpected redness!)**
* **Slower healing from little cuts or blemishes (that zit that won’t quit)**

# The Deeper Impact: More Than Skin Deep

Inflammaging doesn’t just mess with the surface. It goes deeper, causing:

* **Loss of volume and firmness (those cheeks aren’t as plump as they used to be)**
* **More redness or blotchiness (the persistent flush that’s hard to hide)**
* **Flare-ups of skin conditions like eczema or rosacea (ugh, the never-ending itch)**

Sound frustrating? It definitely is but the good news is once you recognize these signs, you can start turning things around.

# What You Can Do About It

Next up, I’ll share simple lifestyle tweaks and professional treatments that help calm inflammation, rebuild your skin’s natural defenses, and get that glow back.

# Lifestyle Habits That Fuel Inflammaging (And How to Change Them)

Let’s be real, we all have habits that don’t exactly scream “healthy.” But some of them are like tossing logs onto that little smouldering campfire inside you, making inflammaging worse without you even noticing.

Ever caught yourself reaching for that afternoon sugary snack, thinking it’s just a harmless treat? I had a client who did exactly that. Once she swapped her candy for a handful of berries, her skin started glowing in just a few weeks. Little changes can pack a punch!

# Common Inflammaging Triggers

* **Poor diet:** Processed foods, sugar, and junk fats act like gasoline on your internal fire.
* **Chronic stress:** Feeling overwhelmed? Stress hormones keep your body stuck in “fight or flight,” stoking inflammation nonstop.
* **Lack of sleep:** Sleep is your body’s nightly reset button. Without enough, inflammation lingers longer than it should. I get it, life’s busy, but even small wins here help.
* **Sitting too much:** Sitting all day? That’s like giving inflammation a VIP lounge to hang out in.
* **Environmental toxins:** Pollution, cigarette smoke, and harsh chemicals add to your body’s inflammatory load. Trying to dodge them when you can makes a difference.

Good news: small tweaks can help douse those flames and get your body back on track. Try these:

* **Eat anti-inflammatory foods:** Think colourful veggies, fatty fish like salmon, nuts, and berries. They’re packed with antioxidants that fight free radicals, the pesky troublemakers behind inflammation.
* **Stay hydrated:** Water helps flush out toxins and keeps your skin plump and radiant.
* **Get moving:** Regular, moderate exercise reduces inflammation and boosts circulation. Even a 20-minute walk counts!
* **Prioritize sleep:** Aim for 7–9 hours each night to give your body time to repair and reset.
* **Manage stress:** Try meditation, yoga, or even simple breathing exercises. Stress is a sneaky inflammation trigger.
* **Limit processed foods and sugar:** These foods fuel inflammation and accelerate ageing.
* **Protect your skin:** Use sunscreen daily and avoid harsh chemicals in skincare.

When it comes to fighting **inflammaging**, what you put in and on your body really matters.

You can support your skin with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-glycation foods and supplements. 

Here are some of my favourites:

* **Resveratrol and pterostilbene** found in berries and pomegranates
* **Curcumin** the active compound in turmeric
* **EGCG** from green tea
* **Berberine**
* **Chlorogenic acid** from green coffee berry
* **Cocoa flavanols**
* **Centella asiatica** (gotu kola) 
* **Quercetin, rutin, hesperidin**, powerful flavonoids in citrus fruits

Still not sure where to start? [Book a Focused Longevity Consultation at Juvenology](https://www.juvenology.co.uk/longevity-clinic)

These natural polyphenols and carotenoids can help calm inflammation and support your skin’s health from the inside out.

Have you noticed how your skin feels after a stressful week? Or how a good night’s sleep changes your whole day? These small shifts aren’t about perfection. They’re about progress and every little step counts.

# Professional Treatments to Combat Inflammaging

Sometimes, no matter how great your habits are, your skin just needs a little extra TLC. I get it, it’s frustrating when you’re doing all the right things but not seeing the glow you want.

That’s when professional treatments step in. They calm inflammation and help your skin heal stronger and shine brighter.

I had a client who felt exactly this way. She ate well and slept better, but redness and dullness stuck around. After trying gentle laser therapy, she told me, **“I never thought my skin could look this calm. It feels like it finally relaxed!”** Moments like that make my job so rewarding.

# Popular Treatments That Can Treat Inflammaging

* [Laser Therapy:](https://www.juvenology.co.uk/photofacial-therapy) A deep reset button for your skin. It kickstarts collagen production and reduces redness. Wish your skin had a refresh button? This is close!
* [Skin Boosters:](https://www.juvenology.co.uk/skin-quality) Injectables with hyaluronic acid, polynucleotides, and exosomes that deeply hydrate and enhance skin regeneration.
* [Chemical Peels:](https://www.juvenology.co.uk/chemical-peels) They peel away damaged, inflamed skin layers, revealing fresh, calmer skin underneath. Like shedding yesterday’s stress.
* [Red Light Therapy:](https://www.juvenology.co.uk/service-page/red-light-therapy) Special light waves soothe inflammation and boost natural healing. I love how it feels, a mini spa day your skin thanks you for.
* [Hydrafacial:](https://www.juvenology.co.uk/5-step-hydrafacial) A soothing, multi-step facial that deeply cleanses, hydrates, and nourishes your skin.

# Wrapping It Up

**Inflammaging** might be a mouthful to say, but really, it’s just your body quietly crying out for a little extra care like a whisper you might not have noticed before. I get it. I know how frustrating it can feel when your skin doesn’t play nice. 

You don’t have to face **chronic inflammation** and **ageing skin** alone, trust me. Whether it’s through simple **anti-inflammatory lifestyle** tweaks or expert **professional treatments**, there’s so much you can do to support your skin and your health as you age.

You deserve skin that feels as vibrant as you are. Have you noticed how your skin feels after a stressful week? That’s **inflammaging** whispering. But with the right care, you can turn down the volume and bring back your glow.

He was smoking none stop literally. I couldn't tell him not to smoke of course those who smoke tend to have a temper, I didn't want problems, so I told him it's okay. It turned out he dose have a temper. 😅 note, that his father passed away just months ago.. so all the responsibility of his siblings and his mother are on him now. I think this is the reason of the smoking a lot and temper. I was very uncomfortable, and I absolutely hated how weak I was, not brave enough to leave.

There's nobody else in the house with us so I go in our room to see who's he's talking to. I don't see anybody so I ask him who he was talking to like that and he said our cat Nova was on the dresser knocking everything over. 

I told him not to yell at my cat like that because she's just an animal to which he snaps back talking about work being the reason he's stressed and on edge. I explain it wasn't an excuse to get pissed off at the cat. I also express my dislike for thinking that he would probably speak to me like that if he has the balls to speak to an animal like that. He then has the audacity to get angry at me for saying that and says ""It's not that deep can you leave me alone"" so I tell him to leave my fucking cat alone instead. 

He gets so stubborn to the point where I could only see red and began punching him in the face and eventually strangling him because he told me I should have never gotten another cat (we only have 3).

Please help me to find symptoms relief","So I am very new to all this B12 information specifically but I have come to better understand the role of these key players in my health. Having reviewed my medical records, I realised I had improperly monitored severe Iron Deficiency Anemia for 10 years. *Ferritin of 3, 4, 6* at many points. In my case, I believe the Iron Deficiency is the biggest cause for my anemia and it is the last stage of my Iron deficiency. My mistake was not being consistent with infusions, allowing my Ferritin to drop extremely low again, and inducing a deficiency all over again. Since I have been Iron deficient for a long time, I need to convince my body that it is no longer deficient and that it does not need to be in rationing mode for a recovery period of at least 6 months to years. 
This is all my understanding of the Iron protocol guides. I have no reason I believe to look into other causes, in my case I believe it was the improperly treated and monitored extended deficiency. I am not celiac, hormonal panels all balanced, no heavy or irregular periods, no thyroid issues, my only GI issue is inherited stomach acidity that kind of flared before but it is very well managed atm no active symptoms.

NOW, *my B12 also always comes back low*. Consistently below 200 and above 100 the highest it was 220 2 years most recent bloodwork it is 195. From my basic understanding, this is deficient, and in Japan below 500 is considered deficiency.. I’ve on some very rare occasions been prescribed B12 dosages/supplementations, that I understand don’t have absorption interfering issues like non-heme iron oral supplements. 

My *Vitamin D is also consistently low or severely low*. Consistent supplementation with right dosage and taking it with fat should be enough to treat that I think..

I realised that this has all plagued so much of my young adulthood. Psychologists easily threw anti depressants at me, I am pretty sure my major depression episode onset 5 years ago was from my Iron dropping… Now I am much less depressive and apathetic, but more easily anxious. I want to understand the explanations for my symptoms and live better.. Here they are in order of importance to me:

* Dry, Lacklustre Hair 
More prone to breakage and frizzing
Scalp Flaking (not worst manageable w haircare/climate I think)

* In last 3 years, Thinning Eyebrows
My hairs all along bottoms are not growing back, can be made worse from years of threading but note I am very hairy. These bald spots have changed shape of my brows and how they frame my face.. :(….

* Peeling Lips

* Darkening of Mouth Corners  

* Dark Circles 

* Pallor

* Fatigue, Energy stores, Exhaustion, Weakness
I can’t keep up without relying on coffee, losing sleep, vicious cycle

* Increased Anxiety and overwhelm over simple things, racing heartbeat. But kind of manageable with building mental toughness/fortitude  
Reduced mental awareness
Absent-mindedness and poor concentration (it’s not the worst) 

* Dehydration 

* Cold Hands and Feet, Warm Core / Internal Body Temperature, 
Poor Heat Tolerance / Ability to regulate temperature (I read this is a less common symptom that depends on how long you’ve deficient, or combination of other factors..?),
Excess Sweating (not hyperhydrosis definitely but bothers me)

* Restless Leg Syndrome

* Acid reflux - No active symptoms it has stabilised, but I believe it had affect on my teeth enamel. More recently I have experienced increased nasal congestion that can affect my sleep quality and concentration, more sensitivity to pollen and dust than before. I do have mild deviated septum but this one plastic surgeon I saw once said it was fine and surgical intervention was not worth risk
 

I’d really appreciate any insights and help..I can’t distinguish which symptoms are related to what and how to go about treating… I’m seeing a hematologist for Iron infusions. What do I say about my low B12 numbers as they usually never get to treating it, I believe they can’t prescribe B12  injections at same time as Iron as it will tank it, and Iron is clear priority in my case?",2,1752827728.0,B12_Deficiency,2,1.0,False

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live?

I've used both types extensively, and I'm here to share my experiences to help you decide which is better for your needs.

Glass electric kettles have a sleek, modern look that many people love. They allow you to see the water boiling, which can be oddly satisfying. The transparent design also makes it easy to check water levels at a glance. However, glass kettles can be more fragile and may not retain heat as well as their stainless steel counterparts.

On the other hand, stainless steel electric kettles are known for their durability and excellent heat retention. They're often more resistant to scratches and dents, making them a great choice for busy households or offices. Stainless steel kettles also tend to have a longer lifespan, which can make them a more cost-effective option in the long run.

When it comes to taste, some people swear that water from a glass kettle tastes purer. While this is largely subjective, it's worth considering if you're particularly sensitive to flavors. Stainless steel kettles, however, are less likely to impart any metallic taste to your water, especially if they're well-made.

Energy efficiency is another factor to consider. Both glass and stainless steel kettles can be energy-efficient, but stainless steel models often have a slight edge due to their superior heat retention. This means they might use less energy to keep water hot for longer periods.

Cleaning is an important aspect of kettle maintenance. Glass kettles make it easy to spot limescale buildup, but they can be trickier to clean thoroughly without scratching the surface. Stainless steel kettles might not show dirt as easily, but they're generally easier to clean and maintain over time.

Price-wise, you'll find a range of options for both glass and stainless steel kettles. Generally, high-quality stainless steel kettles tend to be more expensive, but they often offer better value for money due to their durability.

After weighing all these factors, I personally prefer stainless steel electric kettles for their durability, heat retention, and ease of maintenance. However, the best choice really depends on your individual needs and preferences.

If you're in the market for a new electric kettle, I've found a great selection of both glass and stainless steel options at https://athometouch.com/Electric-Kettle. They have a wide range of kettles to suit different budgets and preferences, so you're sure to find one that's perfect for you.

Remember, whether you choose glass or stainless steel, an electric kettle is a great addition to any kitchen. It's a time-saver for making tea, coffee, or even for cooking tasks that require boiling water quickly. Happy kettle hunting!",1,1752826951.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

Hi Reddit,

I'm going through a breakup. I’m the one initiating it, but that doesn’t mean I’m not hurting. In fact, I’m breaking too.

This isn't about cheating or fights. It’s been a long emotional erosion — quiet disconnection, exhaustion, a feeling of being erased bit by bit. I didn’t wake up one day and decide to leave. I stayed for years trying to fix things. But now I need to choose me, or I’ll disappear.

Yesterday, she cried in the car.
Our 6-year-old son asked, “Why are you sad, Mommy?”
She answered, “Because Daddy is leaving us.”
He looked at her and said, “It’s okay, that’s life. It’s going to be alright.”

That moment nearly broke me.
I’m hurting too — but I’m also invisible in this.

She asked, “Why are you bringing me coffee? Is that hypocrisy? Are you trying to make me suffer?”
She wants me to take the Alexa devices out of our vacation place — she says they’re now bad memories.
That crushed me. Those weren’t just objects. They were part of our family’s shared time. Our son’s joy. Now they’ve turned to ashes.

I know I have my faults. I’m not good at verbal communication. I bottled too much. But I’ve also tried — in my own way — to carry the load, hold on, and protect what we had.

The truth is:
Before I can even think of rebuilding a “we,” I need to rebuild me.
I’m not running away. I’m trying to rise again.

I hope we can build a respectful co-parenting path. I want our son to grow up in calm, not in blame.
But today, I’m just a father who’s also crying.
Even if no one sees it.

Has anyone else been in that place — the one leaving, but still breaking inside? How did you navigate the guilt, the grief, and the longing for peace?

Thanks for reading.

- - -

First time posting here. I've (M28) been crushing on this girl (F31) for about 4 months. We met at our local run club and I was pretty smitten and struck upon seeing her. It would be safe to say I felt she was out of my league but I felt maybe if I tried to foster a friendship I could see if that would lead to something more. We hit it off well, I could make her laugh every time, we have similar hobbies (running, cycling), and I started to notice that she would want to keep me close to her at these run club social events that we did weekly. That was surprising to me as she seemed really popular among that group but I felt a sort of special attention. 

Anyway, as the weeks went on we hung out a bit more 1-on-1, did bike rides together, I asked her out for a coffee (not framed as a date at that time) and generally she continued to want me around her to chat and make her laugh, etc. 

One night, I had a pretty big gig w my band and I was feeling extra confident. We met before the show and I asked her out officially on a date. Since I knew her for a bit already, I felt comfortable asking if I could make her dinner at my place and she accepted. My intentions were wholly just to cook her a good meal, chat, and show her a nice evening. I felt that the dinner date went down exactly as I planned and hoped for. Dinner was prepped and served successfully, we chatted throughout comfortably and with familiarity, and I got to play her a couple of songs and we assembled some Legos together... just trying to be cutesy (she relayed to me a previous time that she was pretty conservative sexually speaking when it comes to early dating so of course I didn't hold any of those expectations and didn't lead down that path)

Towards the end of the date I asked her if she would like to do another date (this time out to a restaurant in town) and she accepted (and earlier in the night mentioned something along the lines of looking forward to a different cuisine type that I could prepare for her in a potential future dinner date). This led me to think ""wow, she's into this and here we go!"" 

But the day for the next date was approaching and I sent a confirmation text seeing if she was still free, she ignored the text for a couple of days to respond that Wednesday wouldn't work and that she'd ""get back to me"" 

I suppose this wasn't too alarming as she had mentioned that as a possibility. But later that week I saw her at our weekly bike ride that we do w a group and I got this sense of distance. Like we couldn't talk about ""us"" and what was up for next date. Neither of us really mentioned it. I told her that I would be out of town all next week for a work conference and would return Monday 7/21 and we'd reconnect then. But I couldn't shake this sense of indifference from her. 

I let a couple days pass by and text her about a move she was doing to another apt. She doesn't respond until the next morning but she updates me on the move and asks how my conference is going. I tell her all is well and if she had anything fun lined up for the week; And she hasn't responded to that text since. That was Tues morning and it's now Thurs night. And of course, in this day of social media I can see that she's up to other fun stuff going on for her and posting about it on insta/strava so it's not like she can't respond to my text or reach out and follow up with me on the 2nd date.

So this leads me to think she just doesn't feel the same way about me as I do about her. I think she's indifferent about me. And I've been in my head for days about this and it's exhausting. My strategy is just to take back control of this situation. If I reach out and say something along the lines of ""hey, just wanted to share that I've been thinking about staying friends instead of going on that 2nd date, I enjoy our friendship and would still want that to continue"" 

Now, that is not the outcome I ultimately want but it may free me from this feeling of being stuck in limbo. I could freely pursue other girls I've started talking with in run club but haven't initiated dating because of this current situation. And I also feel it would give me back my sense of confidence and control and not that I'm just another guy to be indifferent towards, does that make sense? It's probably what she wants anyway judging by her lack of interest? 

I definitely fear calling it off and musjudging her feelings, lol she may be into me and want to do that 2nd date and if I call it off I only just shoot myself in the foot :/

Here are some expanded thoughts on how to nurture harmony in your relationship:

# Understanding the Root of Fights

Many marital conflicts arise from unmet needs, miscommunication, or unresolved past issues. Instead of focusing on who’s right or wrong, try to **dig deeper into the real problem**. For example, an argument about household chores might actually be about feeling **unappreciated or overburdened**. When you address the **underlying emotions** rather than just the surface issue, you create space for real solutions.

# The Power of Patience & Forgiveness

No marriage is perfect, and both partners will make mistakes. Holding onto grudges or bringing up past conflicts during new arguments only fuels resentment. Instead, **practice forgiveness**—not because the other person ""deserves"" it, but because you value your relationship more than your pride. Patience allows you to respond thoughtfully rather than react impulsively in heated moments.

# Building a Culture of Appreciation

Over time, couples often take each other for granted, focusing more on flaws than on strengths. Make it a habit to **express gratitude daily**, whether for small acts (like making coffee) or bigger efforts (like emotional support). When both partners feel **valued and seen**, they’re less likely to engage in unnecessary conflicts.

# The Role of Humor & Lightness

A well-timed joke or playful comment can **diffuse tension** before it escalates. Couples who laugh together—even at their own mistakes—tend to navigate conflicts more smoothly. Of course, humor should never be used to mock or belittle, but when used kindly, it can remind you both that love is bigger than any disagreement.

# Knowing When to Let Go

Some arguments happen simply because one or both partners are tired, stressed, or hungry (the famous **""HALT"" rule**—never argue when you’re Hungry, Angry, Lonely, or Tired). Sometimes, the best way to stop a fight is to **drop the topic, hug it out, and revisit it later** with a clearer mind.

# Growing Together, Not Apart

Marriage is a journey, and couples who **actively work on their bond**—through shared goals, open conversations, and mutual support—tend to fight less. Regular check-ins (like a weekly ""how are we doing?"" talk) can help address small issues before they become big battles.

# Final Thought: Love is a Choice

Every marriage has ups and downs, but **choosing love over ego, understanding over blame, and peace over winning** can transform conflicts into opportunities for deeper connection. Instead of asking, *""How can I stop fights?""* try asking, *""How can we grow stronger through this?""*

Share the moment a neuroscience paper inspired your app’s new UI (“Turns out, the brain processes color like a well-tuned chorus—who knew?”). Rant about the glitch that crashed your simulation and your coffee cup (“Why does the code break only when I’m on my third espresso?”). Celebrate the “aha!” when a physics concept unlocked your engineering block (“Friction isn’t just a force—it’s the reason my drone kept nosediving. Duh.”).​This is where the lab coat meets the keyboard, where beakers dance with circuit boards. Whether you’re a biologist geeking out over AI, a coder fascinated by quantum physics, or just someone who thinks “sci-tech” sounds like the coolest band name ever—you belong. Bring your half-baked ideas (“What if we used plant DNA to encrypt data?”), your failed experiments (“My solar-powered microscope works… until it rains”), and your wildest “what-ifs.” Together, we’ll turn the clangs and buzzes of innovation into something beautiful.​Welcome to the symphony.
