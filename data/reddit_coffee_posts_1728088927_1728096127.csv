It was a community for mostly singer/songwriters or duos and small bands, the types of groups that could play a small bar or coffee shop. Anyway I don’t remember the name and I’m curious if anyone knows of anything like this still going on. It was more than just an open mic it was an actual community of writers and musicians that helped each other. If there’s nothing like this are there people who would be interested in such a thing?

1fwghnn,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1fwghnn/doesnt_clean_up_after_themself/,Doesn’t clean up after themself,"As the title says my roommate doesn’t clean up after themself. Now our room isn’t a complete disaster and it’s mainly their side (plus our bathroom but it’s kinda 70/30 on who makes the most mess of it) but they just don’t really clean up. They have cups and cans and bottles all over their nightstand and desk and have even had a cup under their bed on the dresser before, and they’re never empty either. They also go home every weekend so they don’t really have dishes or real food here so they’re all Starbucks and Dunkin’ cups, so half full coffees just sitting there separating for weeks as they go home and come back. They do sorta clean it after a few weeks, I’ve seen them bag up the cups and other garbage, but they don’t take it out. They have bags full of garbage in the corner on their side of the room and our rooms not big so it’s starting to creep towards our closet almost in the way of it. As for the bathroom they leave hair everywhere and I know it’s theirs and not mine because it’s their little rubber bands with the hair. Now like I said I am also at fault for the the bathroom being messy but I try to keep it somewhat clean by taking out the garbage and have cleaned the shower drain but they don’t even try to clean up a bit. I don’t know how they don’t get embarrassed when they have a friend over or even just with me being here. I get embarrassed having 2 cans on my desk and a few dirty forks or spoons for a few days because I’m too tired to wash them yet. Otherwise they’re a good roommate it’s just they never clean. I should also say they had a single room last year so it definitely feels like part of the reason since they would be used to not sharing a space but I want to have friends over and I’m embarrassed for my roommate. I don’t really know how to tell them to take their garbage out without sounding like a bitch and I already accepted I’m gonna be cleaning our bathroom alone.",1,1728095876.0,college,0,1.0,False

1fwggnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1fwggnz/wifi_survey_assistance/,Wifi Survey Assistance,"In a college class, we were tasked with a semester-long project of our choosing and I thought wifi surveying was an interesting topic. I planned to source to a local small business preferably a coffee shop of some sort and offer a free analysis of their setup and coverage along with security. Though looking I was not aware of how expensive some of these tools were. I do not feel like spending money but may if needed.

I feel a little in over my head but it is already an approved project so I kind of have to roll with it now, the plan was to of course get permission from a shop owner and get a floor plan. From there use Netspot to map out any noise in the building that may be causing any potential interference. With that, do passive scanning from my computer on the dBm signals ranging over the site and find any potential dead zones.  I would then have my document of the floor plan along with the different dBm levels over the areas. 

After the survey is done, I would look into their security with permission such as WPA being used, guest network, default passwords, and such. 

With all that I would do a write-up of my findings to provide to my professor as well as shop owner and discuss any small recommendations. I do not feel comfortable quite yet telling them to buy anything but would make recommendations on tweaking any specific settings or maybe placement of current modem or AP. 

That is the plan, this is a first for me but I just wanted an outside perspective of if there is something I am missing or tools that others find useful in site surveys I can take a look at that are not too expensive. Any input would be useful!!",1,1728095780.0,networking,0,1.0,False

My bf can’t even make one reasonable meal that’s not coffee or throw some ramen noodles in hot water. 

I think its unfair that he blames me for the state of the house which he never maintains clean even when i clean up he leaves empty bottles lying around, dirty laundry and trash.

1fwg9ie,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1fwg9ie/sudden_adult_onset_asthma/,Sudden adult onset asthma (?),"Hi, 

30F 260lb 5’8

Physical Conditions: PMDD (suspected), high cholesterol

Meds: loestrin, Flonase generic (daily), newly prescribed albuterol inhaler as needed up to 4 times/day 

Normal BP, blood panel, liver/kidney function, heart and lung sound normal under stethoscope according to MD yesterday morning

I will start by saying if it doesn’t clear up over the weekend, I’m booking an appointment for someone to look at my lungs. 

I have never had bad allergies. I live in an area that is notoriously bad for allergy sufferers, but only started having mild seasonal allergies in college. I skirted by without necessarily needing meds, but would take from time to time if the symptoms were bothering me. I know Flonase is a daily med, but I have not been taking it regularly enough to have its protection unfortunately. I’ve never been tested for allergies but I believe I’m allergic to mold especially. I also have an adult onset pecan allergy that’s mild but not tested to see if it has worsened. 

So this Tuesday I felt sluggish, like my body felt like sludge and I had brain fog. I didn’t have other allergy symptoms like PND, hives, etc. I asked my partner how they were feeling and they said they felt terrible from allergies, too. I chalked it up to that. 

Wednesday started normally (took some Flonase in the morning) but after a midday walk I felt my throat close up a bit and my breathing restrict, like I couldn’t easily take a full breath. It’s a similar reaction to when I eat pecans without the hives. I return inside, take a Claritin midday, and rest while my body calms down. I return to feeling okay as the Claritin worked and I could breathe comfortably. I go outside to hang out/sit in the front yard and I start feeling poorly again. My face gets slightly tingly in my sinuses and I feel like I can’t take a deep breath. No apparent arrhythmia or heart palps, but I think the anxiety around the reaction is making me cognizant of my body functions I’m noticing. (My anxiety doesn’t usually present like this.) 

Went to the doctor as a last minute annual exam that would also address my current issue Thursday morning. MD listened to my heart and lungs but said they were normal. I got my annual bloodwork which did show high cholesterol, but that is something I anticipated and I’ve been working on this latter half of the year to reduce when my partner got diagnosed as pre diabetic. Liver/kidney function normal, RBC/WBC normal, vitamin normal, not pre- or diabetic, thyroid normal. MD prescribed an inhaler which I picked up today. 

I had another “attack” today before I could pick up my inhaler, though. I had been outside normal at a coffee shop’s outdoor seating for around an hour without issue, but when returning to my workplace and being outside in the yard I had a bad reaction again (face tingling, could breathe but couldn’t comfortably take a deep breath). I took another Claritin but it took a minute to kick in and I really didn’t feel relief until after I picked up and took the albuterol inhaler. I went home and napped and felt better after resting. I was able to go out to dinner with my partner on a patio and while I was conscious of my breathing and heart beat, I don’t think I was struggling or anything while out on the patio. 

More context: I am currently menstruating because I accidentally missed three active pills in the second week. My OB prescribed that I skip the placebo week and jump straight to the second pack. Not pregnant. Not covid positive. No fever. Some on and off headache since Tuesday when I missed my third pill. I’ve had Covid twice in 2022, strep in 2023, have sensitive sinuses but my last sinus infection was February 2024. 

I know it’s better addressed by a professional in person, but I was just curious if my case is pointing to anything specific? Again, if it persists over the weekend I will make an appointment specific to my lungs. Also, sorry if there’s too much irrelevant info; I wasn’t sure if any of it would help. Thanks!

~ I'm Black and Cherokee, I'm bilingual (English and Japanese), around 5'11"" but 6 feet tall on a good day.

~ On top of being your typical nerd I am also a huge horror movie fan to the point of considering making my own horror movie. I have a couple ideas and I would love to share them with someone who's interested in hearing them.

~ I listen to any kind of music except country cuz it all sounds the same to me lol. So if that's a deal breaker then I apologize but I just can't get into it. I also used to rap and sing and have been thinking of doing it again. I have made about 9 or 10 songs in total. Let me know if you'd like to hear something I've made.

~ I love coffee and boba so random coffee and boba runs will be a thing. One of my favorite things to is visit a coffee place I've never been to and try out their coffee and see if I'm adding it to my list or favorite spots or if I'm just never going there again. I know, it sounds weird but I promise it can be kinda fun.

What I expect from you:

I don't want to take the easy way out. M32 F32 ,"TL;DR Hey guys needing some help and advice. My partner of a year ended really bad four days ago.(Me being kicked out and sleeping in my car on my birthday no where to go as I don't have family or support in Australia)

We have been a little up and down throughout and alot of it has been me being insecure but she did start off the relionship with messaging someone else and it hurt me bad, but the fighting got progressively worse I don't think on my part because I learnt to not call names or dive into it when she got angry and aggressive but she would continue to do this when she didnt like what i would say or my feelings. 

I would always try explain my feelings and be emotionally mature. I know what I need to change exactly as I have thought long and hard about this and us living serpately will defuse alot of stress on both of us.I would explain I feel this when you do this to me but that would kick her off.  Was I wrong to explain myself ?  But she would always get angry or kick off when I would explain it like she hated feeling guilty or she would just loose it and start yelling or aggressive. U want this relationship to work you were the one insecure and controlling all sorts. Would still call me names and what not just got nasty. But i never stopped loving her and she loved me im sure.

 We had amazing time when we didn't fight but it lead to 4 days ago she lost her shit I tried to console her and she started pushing me and yelling I told her to calm down and relax everything is ok. We will get coffee and have a chill out she kept going and before u know it she was so out of control. So all I wanted to do is hold her and cuddle her telling her everything is ok while she did this she was scratching and going crazy then she wanted to drive I said babe your not driving your not ok. Please don't so I stood near the door and she was still screaming. So I finally had to let her go and I said please don't do anything silly. Then I go to get a drink and then police are at home with her they arrest me for not being of good behaviour to her as we had a previous history. I honestly don't think I did anything wrong apart from not letting her go as soon as she raised her voice but it came from a good place just wanting to make sure she was ok. So yeah obviously they see it as DV because I didn't let her go when she wanted to and the rest I did tell them I didn't want to let her out of my sights while she was in this mood but they still charged me and now I have to face court. 


I miss her so much but they have imposed no contact so it makes it hard to organise stuff mind you she did ring me and say to email her as she didn't want call logs on her phone. So I guess I will leave it a few days. Find a place and remove my stuff from hers next week. But I do want to work on things and show her what growing I can do and maybe we don't live together anymore but revisit things again. I have written a email for closure for myself that I am happy to share aswell. She said she wants my stuff out for closure so she can move on with her life. I feel like she is doing everything she can to force herself to forget about me. Saying she doesn't want to see or hear my voice etc. I know she loved me and cared for me. Just this happened and now obviously her friends and family will be supporting her. This has taken a massive toll on me and contemplating life atm, but my kids (to another women) are keeping me afloat. ",1,1728094935.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

My name is Daniel and I'm from Southern California (the Inland Empire, specifically). I'm just looking for someone to have a genuinely great time with. I'm not a very picky person and I don't really care much for looks. I more so value your personality and how well we vibe, so pretty much anyone is welcome to get to know me! (I mean that in the most non-conceited way possible lol). I would just ask that you be 21 and older.

My interests:

~ As stated in my title I would consider myself the typical nerdy type (gaming, anime, comic books, super hero movies, etc.) If you like share any of those interests then I think we'll get along great lol

~ I'm Black and Cherokee, I'm bilingual (English and Japanese), around 5'11"" but 6 feet tall on a good day.

~ On top of being your typical nerd I am also a huge horror movie fan to the point of considering making my own horror movie. I have a couple ideas and I would love to share them with someone who's interested in hearing them.

~ I listen to any kind of music except country cuz it all sounds the same to me lol. So if that's a deal breaker then I apologize but I just can't get into it. I also used to rap and sing and have been thinking of doing it again. I have made about 9 or 10 songs in total. Let me know if you'd like to hear something I've made.

~ I love coffee and boba so random coffee and boba runs will be a thing. One of my favorite things to is visit a coffee place I've never been to and try out their coffee and see if I'm adding it to my list or favorite spots or if I'm just never going there again. I know, it sounds weird but I promise it can be kinda fun.

What I expect from you:

~ Good communication and someone who likes to go one random coffee or boba runs. Anime lovers and gamers are a plus as well. Would love a gamer friend/girlfriend.",1,1728094850.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

","One day, in the bustling city of New York, a young man named Jake was walking home from work when he noticed a beautiful woman standing in the rain, looking lost. He approached her and asked if she needed help. She looked up at him with her piercing green eyes and shook her head.

""I'm fine,"" she said, her voice dripping with sadness. ""I just had a fight with my boyfriend.""

Jake's heart went out to her. He introduced himself and offered to buy her a cup of coffee. She hesitated for a moment before agreeing. Over the next few hours, they talked and laughed like old friends. Jake couldn't help but feel drawn to this mysterious woman.

""I'm sorry,"" she said, looking down at her hands. ""I didn't even tell you my name. It's Yumi.""

Jake's heart skipped a beat. He had never met anyone like Yumi before. They exchanged numbers and promised to keep in touch.

Over the next few weeks, Jake and Yumi grew closer. They texted every day, and Jake found himself falling for her more and more. He asked her out on a date, and she said yes.

They went to a fancy restaurant in Manhattan, and Jake couldn't take his eyes off of Yumi. She looked stunning in her little black dress. They laughed and joked, and Jake felt like he was on top of the world.

As the night went on, Yumi leaned in closer to Jake.

""I want you,"" she whispered in his ear.

Jake's heart raced. He had never been with a woman like Yumi before. She was confident, seductive, and just a little bit dangerous.

They left the restaurant and went back to Jake's apartment. Yumi pushed him up against the wall and kissed him deeply. Jake's hands explored her body, and he could feel the heat radiating off of her.

""Take me to the bedroom,"" Yumi demanded.

Jake led her to the bedroom, and they fell onto the bed in a tangle of limbs. Yumi pulled off Jake's shirt and ran her hands over his chest.

""You're so hot,"" she murmured.

Jake kissed her neck and nibbled on her earlobe. He could feel her heart racing.

""I want to taste you,"" he whispered.

Yumi smiled and spread her legs. Jake kissed his way down her body, taking in the scent of her arousal. He licked her clit, and she gasped.

""Oh, yes, just like that,"" she moaned.

Jake licked and sucked on her clit, feeling her body tremble beneath him. He slid a finger inside of her, and she moaned louder.

""Fuck, yes, don't stop,"" she begged.

Jake continued to lick and finger her, feeling her body tense up. She cried out as she came, her juices flowing onto Jake's face.

""I want you inside of me,"" Yumi demanded.

Jake climbed on top of her and slid his cock inside of her. She was so wet and tight, and Jake couldn't help but moan.

""Oh, fuck, you feel amazing,"" he said.

Yumi wrapped her legs around Jake's waist and pulled him deeper inside of her.

""Harder,"" she demanded.

Jake thrust harder and harder, feeling his own orgasm building.

""I'm going to cum,"" he said.

""Cum inside of me,"" Yumi demanded.

Jake groaned as he came, filling Yumi with his seed.

""That was amazing,"" Jake said, collapsing onto the bed next to Yumi.

""Yes, it was,"" Yumi agreed, a sly smile on her face. ""But I'm not done with you yet.""",1,1728094698.0,u_Real_Button_2421,0,1.0,False

It's almost like I don't even have ADHD until it wears off around 3pm. I can get a full, productive day in. 

Unfortunately, I was diagnosed with cardiovascular disease and heart disease this summer and my psychiatrist demanded a clearance from my cardiologist. Of course, they said I have to get off of it. 

I took wellbutrin long ago as an attempted ADHD med. It caused the worst depression and suicidal ideation I've ever had. The only reason I didn't commit suicide was the depression had me glued to the bed until it cleared my system. 

I've tried everything but qelbree at this point. 

Strattera - tic tacs would be more effective
Lexapro - complete shutdown of libido and felt like a cardboard cut out of a person. Basically, doesn't really feel like life is worth living on it. Not suicidal... Just don't care if I live or die or even make plans for the future. 
Adderall xr - jittery AF. Who needs sleep? 
Adderall non xr - jittery AF, major crash right after lunch
Vyvanse - felt incredibly anxious all the time


So when I got on Nuvigil years ago, and it worked... I was amazed. I held a job for more than a year, until they had layoffs. My new job's insurance wouldn't cover Nuvigil for ADHD, which got us to wellbutrin... Which then turned into a 6 cup a day coffee habit, since I couldn't get anything that worked. 


Finally, found a psychiatrist that diagnosed me with narcolepsy, which is technically true if I don't have any stimulants. 

So I'm have a major freak out now as to whether or not I'll even be able to hold down a job, let alone get through whatever break in period qelbree has. And, if it will even work. 

I know there's not a question in there... But if anyone else has had to transition from a great, working med to qelbree, I'd like to know your experience.

It’s gotten to the point where I have so much anxiety over it I can’t function. She always bought a lot of stuff growing up. She’s into crafting and decorating- but when I was a kid it would mostly be things we could use around the house. Our house was always messy but we could live in it. I’m one of 5 children so you would expect some level of mess in a house like that. She also had a budget constraint. My dad was the sole provider and he made decent money as a engineer but she couldn’t go on a shopping trip and blow 100’s of dollars constantly. He helped keep her in check. 

My dad passed 5 years ago and my mom got a sizeable life insurnace policy. She doesn’t work and literally shops ALL DAY. Our house has so much shit in it you can’t use most spaces normally. Every day when I wake up I have to clear a mound of junk just to get to the coffee maker. You can’t sit at the kitchen table and eat normally because there’s stuff. You can’t walk into the laundry room and do laundry without moving around piles. We have 2 garages and the smaller one used to be a home gym. Now it’s unusable. Her closet is so full she hasn’t been in there in years. Her bathroom is hoarded out. She buys so many holiday decorations we have no where to put them and we can’t really decorate for holidays because there’s nowhere display any of it. Anytime I bring it up she’s like, “Oh well you’re no fun. Other people wish they had decorations for Christmas”. Things end up in piles and then they get broken. When we DO need to use something we can’t find it. She bulk buys food we don’t really eat and then it expires. She has a giant cereal stash. A whole ass shelf of just peanut butter. Her entire closet is just piles of fabric and she can’t hang up her clothes there so she throws them on the floor to be destroyed. 

I’ve tried to work on small areas to get them under control but it freaks her out. She recently yelled at me for throwing away spices that expired in 2013 that we have duplicates of. If I donate food before it expires I get in trouble. 

I want to move out so bad. I got a spinal cord injury a few years ago and I finished college but finding a job has been impossible and I feel so stuck. I can walk but obviously I don’t have amazing balance and I constantly trip over things in the house. My doctor was like, “Tell her if you fall you can get really hurt”. Like DUH. She knows that- but it’s not enough to make it worth it to her. When I was having to use a wheelchair before PT I literally went long stretches of time without showering because there was no way to get me into the bathroom. She’s been using my car for a few weeks and the trunk is already completely full of stuff she bought and the rest of the car is full of trash. She’s going to run out of money eventually and idk what she plans to do. She didn’t pay off the house like she was supposed to. I worked so hard to get my degree and didn’t plan on becoming disabled and having that fuck everything up. 

I just got home after I got into my car to run an errand and there was coffee spilled all over my seat and my tank left on empty. I was otw to the gas station and there was an empty water bottle stuck under the brake pedal and I almost crashed the fucking car. I just needed to write this out so I didn’t lose my mind. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do about any of it. I try to bring it up gently but she always feels attacked. No matter how sweet I am *I AM* asking her to stop and that isn’t acceptable to her. She got into therapy at one point recently but also felt attacked there so she stopped going. 

I’m sorry there’s swears in this post. I still have adrenaline pumping from almost crashing my car. ",5,1728093804.0,hoarding,2,1.0,False

Cautionary considerations. ,"If you’ve spent enough time in this sub, I’m sure we’ve all at some point seen questions and answers regarding histamine intolerance. I’m a few weeks post Xifaxan and I’m feeling much better. 

One thing I noticed before treatment was a pretty intense reaction to both histamine and salicylates. Not respiratory symptoms but significant bloating, congestion, and a palpable spike in anxiety. I noticed this specifically with ginger and coffee, which are high in salicylates, but also vinnegar and smoked/processed meat. Both are known to be histamine triggers. 

Another minor inconvenience is that globe artichoke is also high in salicylates. I don’t notice as much of a response from artichoke extract as ginger, but all of the lists I’ve seen indicate ginger has higher salicylate levels than artichoke. I’ve noticed it’s more of a histamine/salicylate bucket situation. I can get away with the prokinetics but when I throw say olive oil or any sort of vinnegar in the mix I get the symptoms. 

I’m not sure how long it will take for things to go back to normal with the amines and salicylate response BUT I refuse to sacrifice the motility gains I’ve been making by stoping the ginger and artichoke. I suspect I’ll need to allow more time for my gut to heal (possible leaky gut) but I would recommend anyone who still experiences symptoms post xifaxan to experiment with eliminating amines especially as they are more common triggers, but also salicylates. 

See how you do avoiding the worst of the amine offenders: wine, beer, aged cheese, smoked meat/fish, vinnegar. And also the worst of the salicylate offenders: berries, coffee, most herbal teas, beer, nuts. 

I could see how someone might thing they still have SIBO when in reality they’re dealing with the lingering effects of the gut damage.

I don't want people with BPD to react to abuse with even more abuse, an eye for an eye and all that crap. I really don't. 

Somebody abuses you? You gather your strength, you leave. You put a boundary in place, you respect yourself, you leave, the abuse ends, you lick your wounds, you heal, you try to find a better partner or friend. 

But honestly... Like I was saying to someone on here in a DM, why can't we be the shitty ones from time to time? A little toxicity, as a treat. Could be that I am a chronic people pleaser, goody two shoes, a doormat, idk. I have quiet BPD as well so this is a deadly combination, you could rob me, unalive my whole family, burn my car down with my Sleep Token CDs inside and still, the worst thing I would do to you is... Ghost you. 

So yeah. I was inspired by a post on here, actually. The OP was ranting about their ex and they listed all of the ways in which the ex did them wrong and then came up with the most out of pocket shit to tell them to retaliate and dump them. 

It is wrong, yes. I wouldn't personally do it. I never have, never will. But people were calling the OP toxic left and right and... Okay, the OP did say something objectively horrible, but then again... Why do we always have to be perfect and champions of love and peace and grace? 

I don't appreciate the rhetoric that goes a little like this, ""if you say all your exes are toxic then you are the toxic one"". Is it true most times? Well yeah, it is. Is it always true? Why are we telling abused people, who surely tend to go from one abusive piece of work to the next (oh I know I do, you'd think that I learned something in therapy but apparently I like my women like I enjoy my coffee: bitter and no fucking sugar anywhere) that they are the problem, they are the toxic one? 

I had bad situationships and bad relationships. I do have a problem in the sense that I chose emotionally unavailable people at best, real pieces of work at worst, but I don't classify myself as toxic. I have to improve, okay, but no toxicity. 

It's exhausting being the better, bigger person. It really is. Again, I don't mean to glorify abuse and romanticise mental illness because I had a relationship with someone with untreated BPD and honestly 0/10 would not recommend because she had fits of rage and I just took it in silence. But it is exhausting. Sometimes I just want to be mean and I physically cannot. 

Now, the OP specifically said something about their ex having to unalive herself. Okay yeah, that is shitty. Maybe not too much out of pocket. A little out of pocket? Let me know 

Four am where I live so gotta pass out, I have to be up early in the morning to throw myself another pity party, gotta start early in the day so that you get all your crying out in an efficient manner.

It's just been a bad and busy week. Not super bad but I asked a girl out who I'm pretty sure is interested in me and she said no. Which, sucks and hurts. I'm pretty sure it's a timing issue but no other plans were made so I'm questioning what happens next. 

She bought me coffee. Which, literally no woman has ever done before. Bought me coffee and hung out at the Cafe just the two of us. The fact she did is crazy. Normally when I show interest and it's not reciprocated I just back off and leave her alone. But idk this time I'm not quite sure what to do other than to just continue being around her.

It's just hard to sit with the uncertainty of what's happening next. I also have a real resistance to getting help from people. Like I haven't talked to anyone about these recent interactions with her. But I don't want advice. Like, at all. I just want to be heard.

1fwfqdi,https://www.reddit.com/r/movingtojapan/comments/1fwfqdi/my_move_to_japan_2_cats/,My Move to Japan ( +2 Cats),"Hi Everyone - I wanted to let everyone know my experience moving to Fukuoka (w/ two cats) and just arriving late September. LONG POST

Getting here: 

**Cats (cost is already x2):** 1 rabies, 1 microchip: $160 // 1 rabies, FAVN bloodwork: $600 // 6 month quarantine in the US \~free // Health Certificate for travel $500

**Flights:** Opted in doing in cabin with me from US to Tokyo through United - Had to purchase an extra seat with pet fees attached to each seat. My one way flight tickets came out to a little less than $1850. Had checked bag allowance of 4, bought 2 more - $400

For the second flight to Fukuoka they went in Cargo (About 1.5 hours total) which cost me 13,000 yen through ANA (Had to pay when I got there) My flight ticket was like $100 usd. 

**Accommodation:** 

*So, not gonna lie Reddit had me scared I wasn't going to be able to find a place. lol* BUT I applied to two apartments, that were both brand new and passed the screening on both of them with two cats and being a foreigner. 

1. Sawara - came out to like 73,000 yen a month after fees. Second Floor, two story building -- I chose not to go with this one because it was A LOT of stairs when you first walk in and it was asking me to make a dent bringing up 6 suitcases. Nice area - A LOT of schools surrounding the place but not too bad.

2. Hakozaki - Area is ehh but I didn't mind. It's close to school so I didn't care. 10th floor - elevator, the whole shabang. Came out to just at 90,000 yen a month after all the fees. Went with this one since it was a little closer to the school, and with 6 suitcases and 2 cats an elevator was better for me. Also liked being higher up and having a bigger balcony. 

Total move in costs: 370,000 yen for the Sawara, and 469,000 yen for the Hakozaki. **SAVE YOUR COINS. It is SO fr when the real estate agent (and everyone here) says 4.5-6 times the rent just to move in.**

Side note: I would have only been paying 1 month rent with the Sawara place since I was moving on the 1st, but since I am moving a little in the month for the Hakozaki place it's that month PLUS the next month. Since I had already booked the airbnb I would have been losing my $1300 I paid already if I did the Sawara, and I kind of enjoy not having to worry about Furniture etc for a little bit so that was another factor. 

Both have internet included, and all the nice perks. 

Temp Housing:  

Airbnb 1 night in Tokyo because jet lag and had to feed the babies and let them stretch: $200 

Airbnb in Fukuoka (Minami) until I move into my place: **$1300**

**Another tip: You will need a Japanese emergency contact to get an apartment.** This was a HARD stop for me trying to get a place, I had someone that studied abroad in the US with me that agreed to be mine, but like it's literally impossible for them to let that requirement go. Before she agreed I got GHOSTED. I think her being native and currently here made the process *a little* easier for me. 

  
Good news is - I've managed to get to my station I get off at for school, find my school, find a nail salon, find a couple coffee spots, made friends with the muffin lady at the station (because I've gone back more than I am proud of), a Korean spot (until I can ferry over), and navigated grocery shopping. I am 26F with just my cats, and I would 150% recommend getting the experience, although I won't be here super long only a couple years, I am already having a blast. 

  
Total costs in USD so far (not including shopping for the trip, grocery shopping while here, and going out and getting food while here): 

$8,500 not including tuition.. with tuition, it's closer to like $15,000.

  
Save those coins guys!! It's not the cheapest move, and I am grateful I had a job that allowed me to save a bunch because WHEW... 

If you can do it, go for it!! :)

1fwfpmy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1fwfpmy/how_to_break_up_with_a_friend_who_constantly/,How to break up with a friend who constantly cancels and is extremely flaky ,"I have a girl friend and we’ve been friends for maybe 7 years. She’s extremely extroverted (learns everyone’s life story at the bar, farmers market, chats with anyone and everyone on the street). I laugh this off but I’ve no interest in chatting at length with random people, so this is a minor stressor when I’m with her.

She’s incredibly flaky and almost love bombs like always messaging omg I miss you so much when are you free??? But I always give her specific dates and times I’m free then she doesn’t answer. Then a week or two later will be like “what time are we hanging out tomorrow?” And I’m kind of like um… you never responded so I’m not free anymore. Or we do actually make a plan and then she cancels (but is soooo sorry and misses me so much!), sometimes even admitting she’s made plans with another friend to go camping or something and is doing that instead of our plans. 

On the occasion we do have a plan and I much prefer to come to her place as she’s a bit much out in public sometimes I’ll arrive at her apartment at the exact time I said I’d be over and she won’t even be at her house. I’ll call or text and she’s like oh we (her and her 5yr old) are down at the beach, come find us (so I have to now walk a few blocks and go to the beach and try and find her), or she ran out for coffee even though she knew I would be there at that time. Often if I come to her house she gives me an errand to do - one time telling me she told someone I would come to their house and pick something up she bought on Facebook marketplace, without even asking me. 

It’s hard because she’s VERY nice and sweet and fun, so it’s taken me a long time to realize this doesn’t feel like she’s being a good friend. Just because she’s nice and sweet I have let all this slide. Sometimes I’ve said making these plans are overly complicated can you please just give me a straight answer. I’ve recently started just not responding because yet again we made specific plans for a date and time and 2 days later cancelled them, but always adds a “but I miss you soooo much!” (She is 33F and I am 31F btw). 

I have changed appointments and plans with other people to accommodate our plans just for them to always get cancelled. And I’m feeling like I do not want to reschedule anymore. She lives about 50 min away from me and has never come to my area to hangout either, only if I can spare my whole afternoon to come out there. 

I work 45-50hrs a week and she is not working right now. And I have a husband who works overnight shifts and I no longer want to give up time with him to spend my whole day driving out to her to have to wander the streets and beach looking for her, or for her to cancel last minute.

She keeps texting me trying to make plans but I see no point in making plans anymore, but I’m not sure what to say. Haven’t seen her since April 2024 now because of all the last minute cancellations. 

I feel like I do all the work driving out to her, I always give specific availability for myself but she is so chaotic and flaky I don’t think she’s got any ability to make a real plan with anyone, even though I try to make it very easy to pick a date/time. Not sure what to say or if I should just continue not answering (although I’ve barely answered for weeks and weeks and I think she’s so in her own world she doesn’t even notice I’m not even talking to her anymore). 

Any thoughts appreciated.

S.O.S. I need some opinions. There’s nothing I can really do here…except for maybe how I act a month from now? If I reach out or respond of he does, etc…

1 year ago I went on a date with a guy I met kinda of at out HS reunion, but we actually didn’t talk much there. I ended up messaging him over a month later a photo I took of him and his friends (seeing how he’d respond). He gave me his phone number and wanted to catch up in person, so we met for drinks when he came to town for the holidays We really hit it off. Sat there for 6 hours. He’d make commments about how beautiful and how cool I am. It was one of those movie moment dates…I could tell when I’d look away he was still staring at me. He asked if he could kiss me and I declined (wanted to, but didn’t want to do too much yet), so he asked for my hand and kissed me on the hand. It was all very romantic and sweet. He sent me texts immediately after for days about wanting to talk to me more and keeping contact. And I wanted those same things. At the time we lived 3hrs apart. We had plans to meet the next month and he started getting more distant and then told me he was dating someone else exclusively and it just happened. 
To say I was crushed is an understatement.

FFW ⏩ 1 year later: I actually live in the same city as him now. I’ve been here for 6 months. About 3 months in, I texted him to see how he is. I could tell by his texts he still had a girlfriend so I accepted we won’t be dating and let it go.

FFW ⏩ September he messaged me out of nowhere. Probably the LAST person I expected a text from. He asked how I was but then wanted to get drinks and so we met. Obviously single now. Again, it felt great. We left the fancy bar and went back to his apartment to eat pizza rolls and watch Futurama lol it felt nice being able to do both. Ofc things escalated with kissing (he asked if he could first again and RAN with it once I said yes.). We did everything BUT sex this night. I stood my ground to say the least. He was a bit grabby and it wasn’t pleasant. Like it hurt. I did say something. I questioned his experience level with the female body mentally for sure. 

We met for ice cream a few days later and chatted about the first night. He apologized if he took things too far and wanted me to feel okay. I made my intentions CLEARLY known. I want LTR and don’t want to just have sex to have sex. If we start off as friends I’d like it to grow into a romantic relationship and if sex is involved I assume that’s where it’s headed. He and I both said a lot, but I’ll note he made a comment about “figuring himself out”. I made the mistake of telling him about past relationships…one of those over sharing feelings. Other than that, he started at me and smiled at me and said all the sweet, nice things…it was a great date. We both talked a lot about movies and ideas of romance and romantic feelings too. Both on the same page about these things. 

3 days later we were texting/flirting and he invited me over. I went bc I wanted to. He said we can just hangout and watch Futurama if I’m comfortable doing only that. We did for a minute but I let it escalate. I wanted it to. I like him a lot. We do end up having sex and it was great. Total 180. He was gentle and kind and sweet and checked in with me often. Looked like he had tears in his eyes. He would stare into my eyes and tell me all the nice things still. I stayed over. It was nice.

We then decided to go to the museum 4 days later and also grab coffee. It was honestly a really nice actual date. He kept making comments of future things we could do together like reading in a park and even a movie he wanted to take me to see. I thought this was end game fr. 

We both surprisingly had the same taste in art, which was a nice touch as the arts are important to both of us in multiple ways. 

He drove me home and I invited him up. At first he wasn’t going to. He wanted to plan something for THIS week we are in right now (bc I was out of town over the weekend) and then he changed his mind, went home to get condoms and came back to me. 

We had the best sex I think I’ve ever had. It was very very passionate. LOTS of eye contact (which usually I avoid), but with him I don’t. We connected very well. I was just minding my business as he cuddled me after and he smiled to himself. I heard it and said “what?” And he said “nothing” but I pried and he said “it’s just…have you ever had an out of body experience? That’s how I feel right now. I feel like I’m looking at my own self and I’m here…then he said my name and smiled”. I told him I definitely didn’t see this on my 2024 bingo card, but I liked it too considering we weren’t exactly friends in high school. V random. 

We talked about fantasies. We talked about what this is a little. He obviously said we still were in beginning stages and obviously I said I wanted a friendship first so we were growing together. He said three times  throughout the month that we were building something together. He also said to me that although we aren’t 100% sure what was happening he said he promised that it wouldn’t end in my heartbreak. And he gave me an actual pinky promise and stamped it (something we started doing together to trust the other person…that was our Inception thing I guess). 


FFW ⏩ Last night. 1 week later. He said he needs to be alone and work on himself and that he no longer feels the spark, and sees me only as a potential platonic friend now. I feel gutted tbh. This came very much in a blindside kind of way for me. We literally went out to dinner and had a great time, he didn’t even say this until we were about to leave. He said we should take a month and do some thinking and growing and circle back when one of us wants to reach out. AT FIRST this mf said we should take a month, but that the ball was in MY court come November 1. I said no. I said that’s a cop out. I said we will see who reaches out to who, but you also can. If you feel a pull to reach out I’d rather you do it. 

But he also said if I’m the one that reaches out to him that it depends on the timing of my message… If he feels like he has done all of his thinking and that we can proceed with a friendship 100% that he will respond and tell me truly what he’s thinking… But if he doesn’t feel like he has done enough mental rewriting of me to do that yet he will say that. 

I told him I was disappointed, disgusted, and that his character didn’t turn out to be who I thought he was. 

He didn’t date but 1 girl ever seriously before (the one that happened after our first date), so idk if I triggered something or if he’s just THAT behind on experience that he’s going through his jackass phase at almost 30 for the first time. Idk. It sucks. We like similar things and always have something to talk about. He even agreed we have strong compatibility and chemistry and our intimacy was strong and passionate….but then yet says there’s not a spark now. Wtf…the spark is bs imo. He said that up until this past week of reflection, he really did want to try and pursue something romantically but right now he feels like he doesn’t have any bit of romance to offer to any woman and that it wouldn’t be fair to have this conversation months from now… I understand that he could still be hurt from his past relationship… But I just think it’s kind of wild to reflect and make the choice to pursue someone and then like you have one bad week or something and you just decide it was the relationship’s fault… Like I feel like this has nothing to do with me.

Sincerely, 

Confused in Kansas City 




***TLDR; man I knew in high school and I connected and had a drink, we lived 3 hrs apart so he got a gf there and we stopped talking, I moved to the same city, he reached out to reconnect, we’ve had 5 dates and sex/fooling 3X. Always passionate and strong chemistry. He flipped the switch yesterday and said he is confused and wants to be alone and work on himself. He wants to take a month apart and if we circle back it would be as friends only. I’m disappointed in this. He was literally planning future stuff for us before doing what was already planned. He said up until this week he was fully wanting it. It switched after he got anxiety after sex last time. He went spiraling and got confused he said. SOS.****


Edited to note: he is a busy guy with a loaded schedule. His weekends are packed so we usually hang during the week. That’s fine. I’m very chill and understanding (I think he was expecting me NOT to be). He kept projecting onto me that eventually his schedule would bother me and that I would want something different and that he would feel bad that he can’t do what I want him to do with his schedule right now… So I’m kind of feeling like this is why his last relationship ended… 
And he’s acting out of fear That he will get attached to me and I’ll feel the same way, but I’m not 15 so I won’t. 

All I said was that I would need the occasional reassurance like any normal person would but I’m also very understanding that we’re almost 30 and we have schedules and we’re busy. He seemed taken aback. He did say his last relationship ended because they did not have the same communication style… And I think he’s thrown off because I’m playing chess to his immature approach to dating checkers. 

I don’t need to have the same communication style as someone to understand what they need and I ended it by just telling him that I have no choice but to respect his decision and give him the space that he clearly needs to work on himself and that it’s honestly probably a good idea he does that. But internally = let down heavily.

He also said after we had sex the last time he couldn’t sleep and felt extreme anxiety inside. He agreed our passion and chemistry was there, but whatever that was AFTER is what send him into being confused and running away it seems :( what is that? ",1,1728093099.0,u_doodleprodigy,0,1.0,False

She always bought a lot of stuff growing up. She’s into crafting and decorating- but when I was a kid it would mostly be things we could use around the house. Our house was always messy but we could live in it. I’m one of 5 children so you would expect some level of mess in a house like that. She also had a budget constraint. My dad was the sole provider and he made decent money as a engineer but she couldn’t go on a shopping trip and blow 100’s of dollars constantly. He helped keep her in check. 

My dad passed 5 years ago and my mom got a sizeable life insurnace policy. She doesn’t work and literally shops ALL DAY. Our house has so much shit in it you can’t use most spaces normally. Every day when I wake up I have to clear a mound of junk just to get to the coffee maker. You can’t sit at the kitchen table and eat normally because there’s stuff. You can’t walk into the laundry room and do laundry without moving around piles. We have 2 garages and the smaller one used to be a home gym. Now it’s unusable. Her closet is so full she hasn’t been in there in years. Her bathroom is hoarded out. She buys so many holiday decorations we have no where to put them and we can’t really decorate for holidays because there’s nowhere display any of it. Anytime I bring it up she’s like, “Oh well you’re no fun. Other people wish they had decorations for Christmas”. Things end up in piles and then they get broken. When we DO need to use something we can’t find it. She bulk buys food we don’t really eat and then it expires. She has a giant cereal stash. A whole ass shelf of just peanut butter. Her entire closet is just piles of fabric and she can’t hang up her clothes there so she throws them on the floor to be destroyed. 

I’ve tried to work on small areas to get them under control but it freaks her out. She recently yelled at me for throwing away spices that expired in 2013 that we have duplicates of. If I donate food before it expires I get in trouble. 

I want to move out so bad. I got a spinal cord injury a few years ago and I finished college but finding a job has been impossible and I feel so stuck. I can walk but obviously I don’t have amazing balance and I constantly trip over things in the house. My doctor was like, “Tell her if you fall you can get really hurt”. Like DUH. She knows that- but it’s not enough to make it worth it to her. When I was having to use a wheelchair before PT I literally went long stretches of time without showering because there was no way to get me into the bathroom. She’s been using my car for a few weeks and the trunk is already completely full of stuff she bought and the rest of the car is full of trash. She’s going to run out of money eventually and idk what she plans to do. She didn’t pay off the house like she was supposed to. I worked so hard to get my degree and didn’t plan on becoming disabled and having that fuck everything up. 

I just got home after I got into my car to run an errand and there was coffee spilled all over my seat and my tank left on empty. I was otw to the gas station and there was an empty water bottle stuck under the brake pedal and I almsot crashed the fucking car. I just needed to write this out so I didn’t lose my mind.

She has often been very inconsiderate and selfish. See examples below:

* I was in the ER overnight a few weeks ago and was still there until almost noon that day. While I was still there in the morning, she asked me to call her so she could talk about a job she wanted, even though I told her minutes before that I was in the ER waiting room and that I was there overnight with no sleep. 

* This week, she tagged along while I went out for coffee. She pretended to try to pay for my drink while I don’t hesitate to pay for her stuff all the time. On the way, she offered a coworker a coffee and on the way back, she asked me to hold it while my hands were just as full as hers.

* She is the biggest gossip and often will tell others what they told her in confidence. I once told her about a stalking situation I went through and immediately after I told her, she was begging to tell another colleague that I was not friends with. 

* I had a membership to a store and she was trying to mooch off of me. I told her specifically when I could take her and she was trying to pressure me to go at a time I didn’t want to. I told her to get her own card so she can go whenever she wanted and she was flabbergasted that I even suggested it.

* Every time I see her, she talks about her problems and I’m sick of it. I believe this is the main reason why she wants me around. I don’t need this negativity in my life and I don’t want to be around someone who uses and disrespects me.

I definitely like her and I’m pretty interested in seeing her again, I texted her first and said I’d love to see her again and she told me over text she’d like to see me again and will suss her work availability, sometime next week (it’s Saturday), she’s a pretty bad texter and has acknowledged that so our messages aren’t everyday, every couple days a quick hello and then she followed up asking for my availability so seems she is keen.

But yesterday (Friday) I responded to her with “sounds great, have a good weekend :)” and she responded witn “you too, -my name-!” I feel I may have cut the conversation short. I’m normally a very active texter but taken care to match her energy when texting as our dates have been great so far I’m assuming she just likes to save it for the date, so it’s hard to know if I’m making a mistake but cutting the conversation or I’m fine by taking it slow and not having to talk all the time, im quite new to dating so not really sure how frequent it’s got to be after a second date and potentially leading into a third? as we know each other a bit more now I have a genuine funny question/call back to our last couple dates that I need to ask her tonight in regards to a dinner so was thinking of shooting her a text just to keep the vibe up.

 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke. It was our song remastered",1,1728092109.0,Tik_tok_stories,0,1.0,False
1fwfbq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1fwfbq0/how_to_never_oversleep_again/,How to never oversleep again.,"**It's easy to get out of bed,** ***it's just easier not to.***

This is due to friction.

**Friction** is any resistance faced when trying to behave in a specific way. In the context of waking up, there is inherently more friction to getting out of bed than staying in bed, hence why you hit snooze.

**The goal is to manipulate friction, making it easier to get up than to sleep in.**

You want to make sleeping past your planned wake time a living hell. The more uncomfortable a situation is, the more likely you will try and avoid it.

Because of this, I like to set three alarms, each 15 minutes apart. You can use as few or as many alarms as you'd like. You may also benefit from setting your phone on the opposite side of the room. Now, getting up is a requirement to disable the alarm(s).

If you plan to wake during or after sunrise, you can leave your window open, allowing the natural light to shine into your room. Although not accessible to everybody, I highly suggest getting a smart bulb or light strip. You can program these to turn on alongside your alarm(s), adding additional friction to sleeping in.

**Okay, now it is more difficult to sleep in. How do you make it easier to get up?**

Starting with the obvious, you need adequate sleep. If you wake up after 6 hours, you are unlikely to feel rested, which is the epitome of friction in this context. Aim to be asleep 8 hours before you plan to wake, settling down an hour before then.

Before you go to bed, make preparations for the following morning. This means picking your outfit, planning your day, and possibly setting your coffee machine to start brewing with your alarm.

Creating a time-sensitive schedule instills a sense of urgency, which motivates me to stick to it. For this reason, I suggest planning at least the first hour of the morning with specified times, starting as soon as your alarm goes off.

**Now, only one issue remains**. Hypothetically, you could disable all alarms, close your blinds, turn off the smart bulb, and go back to sleep.

You need an incentive to stay awake. It could be anything that provides sufficient motivation to get moving. Whether it be a project, an event, a person, a routine, or a cup of coffee, it gives you a purpose.

**Get up and move quickly**. It may sound paradoxical, as it is the exact problem we are trying to solve. However, you are more likely to stay awake if you jolt yourself out of bed.",1,1728091967.0,sleep,0,1.0,False

S.O.S. I need some opinions. There’s nothing I can really do here…except for maybe how I act a month from now? If I reach out or respond of he does, etc…

1 year ago I went on a date with a guy I met kinda of at out HS reunion, but we actually didn’t talk much there. I ended up messaging him over a month later a photo I took of him and his friends (seeing how he’d respond). He gave me his phone number and wanted to catch up in person, so we met for drinks when he came to town for the holidays We really hit it off. Sat there for 6 hours. He’d make commments about how beautiful and how cool I am. It was one of those movie moment dates…I could tell when I’d look away he was still staring at me. He asked if he could kiss me and I declined (wanted to, but didn’t want to do too much yet), so he asked for my hand and kissed me on the hand. It was all very romantic and sweet. He sent me texts immediately after for days about wanting to talk to me more and keeping contact. And I wanted those same things. At the time we lived 3hrs apart. We had plans to meet the next month and he started getting more distant and then told me he was dating someone else exclusively and it just happened. 
To say I was crushed is an understatement.

FFW ⏩ 1 year later: I actually live in the same city as him now. I’ve been here for 6 months. About 3 months in, I texted him to see how he is. I could tell by his texts he still had a girlfriend so I accepted we won’t be dating and let it go.

FFW ⏩ September he messaged me out of nowhere. Probably the LAST person I expected a text from. He asked how I was but then wanted to get drinks and so we met. Obviously single now. Again, it felt great. We left the fancy bar and went back to his apartment to eat pizza rolls and watch Futurama lol it felt nice being able to do both. Ofc things escalated with kissing (he asked if he could first again and RAN with it once I said yes.). We did everything BUT sex this night. I stood my ground to say the least. He was a bit grabby and it wasn’t pleasant. Like it hurt. I did say something. I questioned his experience level with the female body mentally for sure. 

We met for ice cream a few days later and chatted about the first night. He apologized if he took things too far and wanted me to feel okay. I made my intentions CLEARLY known. I want LTR and don’t want to just have sex to have sex. If we start off as friends I’d like it to grow into a romantic relationship and if sex is involved I assume that’s where it’s headed. He and I both said a lot, but I’ll note he made a comment about “figuring himself out”. I made the mistake of telling him about past relationships…one of those over sharing feelings. Other than that, he started at me and smiled at me and said all the sweet, nice things…it was a great date. We both talked a lot about movies and ideas of romance and romantic feelings too. Both on the same page about these things. 

3 days later we were texting/flirting and he invited me over. I went bc I wanted to. He said we can just hangout and watch Futurama if I’m comfortable doing only that. We did for a minute but I let it escalate. I wanted it to. I like him a lot. We do end up having sex and it was great. Total 180. He was gentle and kind and sweet and checked in with me often. Looked like he had tears in his eyes. He would stare into my eyes and tell me all the nice things still. I stayed over. It was nice.

We then decided to go to the museum 4 days later and also grab coffee. It was honestly a really nice actual date. He kept making comments of future things we could do together like reading in a park and even a movie he wanted to take me to see. I thought this was end game fr. 

We both surprisingly had the same taste in art, which was a nice touch as the arts are important to both of us in multiple ways. 

He drove me home and I invited him up. At first he wasn’t going to. He wanted to plan something for THIS week we are in right now (bc I was out of town over the weekend) and then he changed his mind, went home to get condoms and came back to me. 

We had the best sex I think I’ve ever had. It was very very passionate. LOTS of eye contact (which usually I avoid), but with him I don’t. We connected very well. I was just minding my business as he cuddled me after and he smiled to himself. I heard it and said “what?” And he said “nothing” but I pried and he said “it’s just…have you ever had an out of body experience? That’s how I feel right now. I feel like I’m looking at my own self and I’m here…then he said my name and smiled”. I told him I definitely didn’t see this on my 2024 bingo card, but I liked it too considering we weren’t exactly friends in high school. V random. 

We talked about fantasies. We talked about what this is a little. He obviously said we still were in beginning stages and obviously I said I wanted a friendship first so we were growing together. He said three times  throughout the month that we were building something together. He also said to me that although we aren’t 100% sure what was happening he said he promised that it wouldn’t end in my heartbreak. And he gave me an actual pinky promise and stamped it (something we started doing together to trust the other person…that was our Inception thing I guess). 


FFW ⏩ Last night. 1 week later. He said he needs to be alone and work on himself and that he no longer feels the spark, and sees me only as a potential platonic friend now. I feel gutted tbh. This came very much in a blindside kind of way for me. We literally went out to dinner and had a great time, he didn’t even say this until we were about to leave. He said we should take a month and do some thinking and growing and circle back when one of us wants to reach out. AT FIRST this mf said we should take a month, but that the ball was in MY court come November 1. I said no. I said that’s a cop out. I said we will see who reaches out to who, but you also can. If you feel a pull to reach out I’d rather you do it. 

But he also said if I’m the one that reaches out to him that it depends on the timing of my message… If he feels like he has done all of his thinking and that we can proceed with a friendship 100% that he will respond and tell me truly what he’s thinking… But if he doesn’t feel like he has done enough mental rewriting of me to do that yet he will say that. 

I told him I was disappointed, disgusted, and that his character didn’t turn out to be who I thought he was. 

He didn’t date but 1 girl ever seriously before (the one that happened after our first date), so idk if I triggered something or if he’s just THAT behind on experience that he’s going through his jackass phase at almost 30 for the first time. Idk. It sucks. We like similar things and always have something to talk about. He even agreed we have strong compatibility and chemistry and our intimacy was strong and passionate….but then yet says there’s not a spark now. Wtf…the spark is bs imo. He said that up until this past week of reflection, he really did want to try and pursue something romantically but right now he feels like he doesn’t have any bit of romance to offer to any woman and that it wouldn’t be fair to have this conversation months from now… I understand that he could still be hurt from his past relationship… But I just think it’s kind of wild to reflect and make the choice to pursue someone and then like you have one bad week or something and you just decide it was the relationship’s fault… Like I feel like this has nothing to do with me.

Sincerely, 

Confused in Kansas City 




***TLDR; man I knew in high school and I connected and had a drink, we lived 3 hrs apart so he got a gf there and we stopped talking, I moved to the same city, he reached out to reconnect, we’ve had 5 dates and sex/fooling 3X. Always passionate and strong chemistry. He flipped the switch yesterday and said he is confused and wants to be alone and work on himself. He wants to take a month apart and if we circle back it would be as friends only. I’m disappointed in this. He was literally planning future stuff for us before doing what was already planned. He said up until this week he was fully wanting it. It switched. He got confused after getting anxiety after sex last time and it sent him spiraling. SOS.***


Edited to note: he is a busy guy with a loaded schedule. His weekends are packed so we usually hang during the week. That’s fine. I’m very chill and understanding (I think he was expecting me NOT to be). He kept projecting onto me that eventually his schedule would bother me and that I would want something different and that he would feel bad that he can’t do what I want him to do with his schedule right now… So I’m kind of feeling like this is why his last relationship ended… 
And he’s acting out of fear That he will get attached to me and I’ll feel the same way, but I’m not 15 so I won’t. 

All I said was that I would need the occasional reassurance like any normal person would but I’m also very understanding that we’re almost 30 and we have schedules and we’re busy. He seemed taken aback. He did say his last relationship ended because they did not have the same communication style… And I think he’s thrown off because I’m playing chess to his immature approach to dating checkers. 

I don’t need to have the same communication style as someone to understand what they need and I ended it by just telling him that I have no choice but to respect his decision and give him the space that he clearly needs to work on himself and that it’s honestly probably a good idea he does that. But internally = let down heavily.

He also said after we had sex the last time he couldn’t sleep and felt extreme anxiety inside. He agreed our passion and chemistry was there, but whatever that was AFTER is what send him into being confused and running away it seems :( what is that? ",3,1728091781.0,dating_advice,32,1.0,False

Any insight on why this may have happened? ,"S.O.S. I need some opinions. There’s nothing I can really do here…except for maybe how I act a month from now? If I reach out or respond of he does, etc…

1 year ago I went on a date with a guy I met kinda of at out HS reunion, but we actually didn’t talk much there. I ended up messaging him over a month later a photo I took of him and his friends (seeing how he’d respond). He gave me his phone number and wanted to catch up in person, so we met for drinks when he came to town for the holidays We really hit it off. Sat there for 6 hours. He’d make commments about how beautiful and how cool I am. It was one of those movie moment dates…I could tell when I’d look away he was still staring at me. He asked if he could kiss me and I declined (wanted to, but didn’t want to do too much yet), so he asked for my hand and kissed me on the hand. It was all very romantic and sweet. He sent me texts immediately after for days about wanting to talk to me more and keeping contact. And I wanted those same things. At the time we lived 3hrs apart. We had plans to meet the next month and he started getting more distant and then told me he was dating someone else exclusively and it just happened. 
To say I was crushed is an understatement.

FFW ⏩ 1 year later: I actually live in the same city as him now. I’ve been here for 6 months. About 3 months in, I texted him to see how he is. I could tell by his texts he still had a girlfriend so I accepted we won’t be dating and let it go.

FFW ⏩ September he messaged me out of nowhere. Probably the LAST person I expected a text from. He asked how I was but then wanted to get drinks and so we met. Obviously single now. Again, it felt great. We left the fancy bar and went back to his apartment to eat pizza rolls and watch Futurama lol it felt nice being able to do both. Ofc things escalated with kissing (he asked if he could first again and RAN with it once I said yes.). We did everything BUT sex this night. I stood my ground to say the least. He was a bit grabby and it wasn’t pleasant. Like it hurt. I did say something. I questioned his experience level with the female body mentally for sure. 

We met for ice cream a few days later and chatted about the first night. He apologized if he took things too far and wanted me to feel okay. I made my intentions CLEARLY known. I want LTR and don’t want to just have sex to have sex. If we start off as friends I’d like it to grow into a romantic relationship and if sex is involved I assume that’s where it’s headed. He and I both said a lot, but I’ll note he made a comment about “figuring himself out”. I made the mistake of telling him about past relationships…one of those over sharing feelings. Other than that, he started at me and smiled at me and said all the sweet, nice things…it was a great date. We both talked a lot about movies and ideas of romance and romantic feelings too. Both on the same page about these things. 

3 days later we were texting/flirting and he invited me over. I went bc I wanted to. He said we can just hangout and watch Futurama if I’m comfortable doing only that. We did for a minute but I let it escalate. I wanted it to. I like him a lot. We do end up having sex and it was great. Total 180. He was gentle and kind and sweet and checked in with me often. Looked like he had tears in his eyes. He would stare into my eyes and tell me all the nice things still. I stayed over. It was nice.

We then decided to go to the museum 4 days later and also grab coffee. It was honestly a really nice actual date. He kept making comments of future things we could do together like reading in a park and even a movie he wanted to take me to see. I thought this was end game fr. 

We both surprisingly had the same taste in art, which was a nice touch as the arts are important to both of us in multiple ways. 

He drove me home and I invited him up. At first he wasn’t going to. He wanted to plan something for THIS week we are in right now (bc I was out of town over the weekend) and then he changed his mind, went home to get condoms and came back to me. 

We had the best sex I think I’ve ever had. It was very very passionate. LOTS of eye contact (which usually I avoid), but with him I don’t. We connected very well. I was just minding my business as he cuddled me after and he smiled to himself. I heard it and said “what?” And he said “nothing” but I pried and he said “it’s just…have you ever had an out of body experience? That’s how I feel right now. I feel like I’m looking at my own self and I’m here…then he said my name and smiled”. I told him I definitely didn’t see this on my 2024 bingo card, but I liked it too considering we weren’t exactly friends in high school. V random. 

We talked about fantasies. We talked about what this is a little. He obviously said we still were in beginning stages and obviously I said I wanted a friendship first so we were growing together. He said three times  throughout the month that we were building something together. He also said to me that although we aren’t 100% sure what was happening he said he promised that it wouldn’t end in my heartbreak. And he gave me an actual pinky promise and stamped it (something we started doing together to trust the other person…that was our Inception thing I guess). 


FFW ⏩ Last night. 1 week later. He said he needs to be alone and work on himself and that he no longer feels the spark, and sees me only as a potential platonic friend now. I feel gutted tbh. This came very much in a blindside kind of way for me. We literally went out to dinner and had a great time, he didn’t even say this until we were about to leave. He said we should take a month and do some thinking and growing and circle back when one of us wants to reach out. AT FIRST this mf said we should take a month, but that the ball was in MY court come November 1. I said no. I said that’s a cop out. I said we will see who reaches out to who, but you also can. If you feel a pull to reach out I’d rather you do it. 

But he also said if I’m the one that reaches out to him that it depends on the timing of my message… If he feels like he has done all of his thinking and that we can proceed with a friendship 100% that he will respond and tell me truly what he’s thinking… But if he doesn’t feel like he has done enough mental rewriting of me to do that yet he will say that. 

I told him I was disappointed, disgusted, and that his character didn’t turn out to be who I thought he was. 

He didn’t date but 1 girl ever seriously before (the one that happened after our first date), so idk if I triggered something or if he’s just THAT behind on experience that he’s going through his jackass phase at almost 30 for the first time. Idk. It sucks. We like similar things and always have something to talk about. He even agreed we have strong compatibility and chemistry and our intimacy was strong and passionate….but then yet says there’s not a spark now. Wtf…the spark is bs imo. He said that up until this past week of reflection, he really did want to try and pursue something romantically but right now he feels like he doesn’t have any bit of romance to offer to any woman and that it wouldn’t be fair to have this conversation months from now… I understand that he could still be hurt from his past relationship… But I just think it’s kind of wild to reflect and make the choice to pursue someone and then like you have one bad week or something and you just decide it was the relationship’s fault… Like I feel like this has nothing to do with me.

Sincerely, 

Confused in Kansas City 




TLDR; man I knew in high school and I connected and had a drink, we lived 3 hrs apart so he got a gf there and we stopped talking, I moved to the same city, he reached out to reconnect, we’ve had 5 dates and sex/fooling 3X. Always passionate and strong chemistry. He flipped the switch yesterday and said he is confused and wants to be alone and work on himself. He wants to take a month apart and if we circle back it would be as friends only. I’m disappointed in this. He was literally planning future stuff for us before doing what was already planned. He said up until this week he was fully wanting it. It switched. SOS.


Edited to note: he is a busy guy with a loaded schedule. His weekends are packed so we usually hang during the week. That’s fine. I’m very chill and understanding (I think he was expecting me NOT to be). He kept projecting onto me that eventually his schedule would bother me and that I would want something different and that he would feel bad that he can’t do what I want him to do with his schedule right now… So I’m kind of feeling like this is why his last relationship ended… 
And he’s acting out of fear That he will get attached to me and I’ll feel the same way, but I’m not 15 so I won’t. 

All I said was that I would need the occasional reassurance like any normal person would but I’m also very understanding that we’re almost 30 and we have schedules and we’re busy. He seemed taken aback. He did say his last relationship ended because they did not have the same communication style… And I think he’s thrown off because I’m playing chess to his immature approach to dating checkers. 

I don’t need to have the same communication style as someone to understand what they need and I ended it by just telling him that I have no choice but to respect his decision and give him the space that he clearly needs to work on himself and that it’s honestly probably a good idea he does that. But internally = let down heavily.

He also said after we had sex the last time he couldn’t sleep and felt extreme anxiety inside. He agreed our passion and chemistry was there, but whatever that was AFTER is what send him into being confused and running away it seems :( what is that? ",1,1728091675.0,datingadvice,1,1.0,False

This is due to friction.

**Friction** is any resistance faced when trying to behave in a specific way. In the context of waking up, there is inherently more friction to getting out of bed than staying in bed, hence why you hit snooze.

**The goal is to manipulate friction, making it easier to get up than to sleep in.**

You want to make sleeping past your planned wake time a living hell. The more uncomfortable a situation is, the more likely you will try and avoid it.

Because of this, I like to set three alarms, each 15 minutes apart. You can use as few or as many alarms as you'd like. You may also benefit from setting your phone on the opposite side of the room. Now, getting up is a requirement to disable the alarm(s).

If you plan to wake during or after sunrise, you can leave your window open, allowing the natural light to shine into your room. Although not accessible to everybody, I highly suggest getting a smart bulb or light strip. You can program these to turn on alongside your alarm(s), adding additional friction to sleeping in.

**Okay, now it is more difficult to sleep in. How do you make it easier to get up?**

Starting with the obvious, you need adequate sleep. If you wake up after 6 hours, you are unlikely to feel rested, which is the epitome of friction in this context. Aim to be asleep 8 hours before you plan to wake, settling down an hour before then.

Before you go to bed, make preparations for the following morning. This means picking your outfit, planning your day, and possibly setting your coffee machine to start brewing with your alarm.

Creating a time-sensitive schedule instills a sense of urgency, which motivates me to stick to it. For this reason, I suggest planning at least the first hour of the morning with specified times, starting as soon as your alarm goes off.

**Now, only one issue remains**. Hypothetically, you could disable all alarms, close your blinds, turn off the smart bulb, and go back to sleep.

You need an incentive to stay awake. It could be anything that provides sufficient motivation to get moving. Whether it be a project, an event, a person, a routine, or a cup of coffee, it gives you a purpose.

**Get up and move quickly**. It may sound paradoxical, as it is the exact problem we are trying to solve. However, you are more likely to stay awake if you jolt yourself out of bed.",4,1728091592.0,selfimprovement,0,1.0,False

Bad breakup and my mental health is going downhill fast. ,"Hey guys needing some help and advice. My partner of a year ended really bad four days ago.(Me being kicked out and sleeping in my car on my birthday no where to go as I don't have family or support in Australia)We have been a little up and down throughout and alot of it has been me being insecure but she did start off the relionship with messaging someone else and it hurt me bad, but the fighting got progressively worse not on my part because I learnt to not call names or dive into it when she got angry and aggressive. I would always try explain my feelings and be emotionally mature. I know what I need to change exactly as I have thought long and hard about this and us living serpately will defuse alot of stress on both of us. I feel this when you do this to me. Can't go wrong with your feeling right ? But she would always get angry or kick off when I would explain it like she hated feeling guilty or she would just loose it and start yelling or aggressive. U want this relionship to work you were the one insecure and controlling all sorts. Would still call me names and what not just got nasty. But i never stopped loving her and she loved me im sure. We had amazing time when we didn't fight but it lead to 4 days ago she lost her shit I tried to console her and she started pushing me and yelling I told her to calm down and relax everything is ok. We will get coffee and have a chill out she kept going and before u know it she was so out of control. So all I wanted to do is hold her while she did this she was scratching and going crazy then she wanted to drive I said babe your not driving your not ok. Please don't so I stood near the door and she was still screaming. So I finally had to let her go and I said please don't do anything silly. Then I go to get a drink and then police are at home with her they arrest me for not being of good behaviour to her as we had a previous history. I honestly don't think I did anything wrong apart from not letting her go as soon as she raised her voice but it came from a good place just wanting to make sure she was ok. So yeah obviously they see it as DV because I didn't let her go when she wanted to and the rest I did tell them I didn't want to let her out of my sights while she was in this mood but they still charged me and now I have to face court. 
I miss her so much but they have imposed no contact so it makes it hard to organise stuff mind you she did ring me and say to email her as she didn't want call logs on her phone. So I guess I will leave it a few days. Find a place and remove my stuff from hers next week. But I do want to work on things and show her what growing I can do and maybe we don't live together anymore but revisit things again. I have written a email for closure for myself that I am happy to share aswell. She said she wants my stuff out for closure so she can move on with her life. I feel like she is doing everything she can to force herself to forget about me. Saying she doesn't want to see or hear my voice etc. I know she loved me and cared for me. Just this happened and now obviously her friends and family will be supporting her. This has taken a massive toll on me and contemplating life atm, but my kids (to another women) are keeping me afloat. ",1,1728091369.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

You know how I haven’t really talked about my manager since the rescue in the graveyard?  It’s because not a lot happened with him after that.  He was kind of like, you cool? And I was like yeah I’m good and he left it at that.  My personal theory is that he either doesn’t remember what happened, is in denial, or is dealing with his trauma by burying it very very deep and hoping no one asks about it.

Haaaaaaaaaaaaah that’s familiar.

Probably a combination of all three, if we’re being realistic.  Anyway, I’ve been going to work as normal despite everything, because life goes on right, and I don’t have that many shifts to begin with.  And I think things would have just continued on like that, with him in a state of amnesia/denial/trauma and me not wanting to bring it up because I had other problems to deal with.

HOWEVER.

Neither of us accounted for my former boss.  

We certainly didn’t expect her to show up unannounced at the end of my shift.

“I AM OUT OF PUMPKIN SPICE,” she bellowed, bursting in through the back door of the kitchen area.  “DO YOU HAVE PUMPKIN SPICE.”

Uh, no, we obviously did not have pumpkin spice.  We did things like reheating spinach quiches and mixing cans of chicken alfredo with pasta.  Pumpkin spice wasn’t something we needed on the regular, unlike the coffee shop which had decided to make it a permanent part of their menu.  My former boss ignored me though and went into the pantry.  I stood there, waiting, while she rummaged around.  My manager emerged from his office at the commotion to see what was happening.

“Okay, you don’t have it either,” my former boss said, emerging from the pantry empty-handed.  “We need to go shopping.  My car is broken, so you’ll need to drive.  Oh, and let’s bring Ashley, we’ll need help carrying it.”

How much pumpkin spice were we buying?!

“You could just take it off the menu,” my manager suggested.

“UNACCEPTABLE.”

I would like to say that this level of volume wasn’t unheard of for my former boss, but it was unusual.

“I’d have a riot on my hands,” she added.  “Putting it on the menu was the most popular decision anyone has ever made on this campus.”

I’m not sure I’d agree with that, I feel like ‘a professor canceling a Friday afternoon class’ could put up some real competition, but my former boss was moving through the kitchen like a whirlwind.  She went to my manager’s office and helped herself to his car keys.  Then she headed for the exit, my manager following because it was his car and he had no choice, and me following because at this point I just wanted to see what the heck was going on.

I did remember to text Cassie and tell her what was going on so she wouldn’t freak out when I didn’t show at our meetup spot now that my shift was done.

My manager at least managed to reclaim control of the situation by insisting that he get to drive his own car.  But as we were leaving campus, my former boss gave him some instructions on where she wanted to go.  Don’t go straight, she said. We weren’t going to the grocery store.

She told him to get on the highway.

And then he drove in confused silence for half an hour while I sat in the back and wondered if I was being kidnapped.  I had my cellphone on me, so maybe not though?  Maybe we were just going to a retailer outside of town, because the local grocery store probably didn’t have the quantity of pumpkin spice she needed.  Restaurant supply stores are a thing, right?  I assumed this was the case just to calm my nerves, while I watched out the window as the rain pelting the car slowly dwindled and then vanished.  I could see sunlight for the first time in almost two weeks.

“Okay, now that the rain is gone,” my former boss sighed, “let’s talk about what this is *really* about.”

“So the pumpkin spice…” my manager began.

“Oh we’re totally out of it.  But I crossed it off the menu like a sensible person.”

Which meant this excursion was about the rain.  It was about me.  And sure enough, my former boss wanted to know what happened in the graveyard.  I didn’t just free my manager from the tree, she said.  It’d started raining that day and it hadn’t stopped.  That wasn’t a coincidence.

So while my manager drove, hunting for someplace to pull over that might have a decent coffee shop, I told them everything that had happened.  *Everything*.  Because I needed all the help I could get and both of them were pretty entrenched in the inhuman by this point already.

“The devil!?” my manager said when I was finished.  “Am I losing my mind?  Is this what it feels like to lose my mind?”

“Says the man that periodically eats the contents of his entire kitchen, including, mind you, the grease traps and the raw bacon,” my former boss retorted.

I’m so glad she’s on my side.

“But why are you getting involved in this?” I asked.  “I seem to recall you being an advocate of keeping your head down and not saying anything.”

“Yeah, I was,” my former boss said grimly.  “But you know what else is different?  Haven’t seen the possums around for a while.  Haven’t seen a few things around lately, actually.  Got me thinking - maybe campus can change.  It *is* changing.  And turns out you’re the reason.”

I started to say something self-deprecating, that it really wasn’t me, that I’d just been cast in this role because Grayson needed a body to inhabit, but she quickly cut me off.

“So what are you going to do about the rain?” she asked.  “Any ideas to get rid of it?”

That hadn’t even crossed my mind.  Stopping Grayson, yes, but not *getting rid of him*.  He was the rain.  You couldn’t get rid of the rain.  But I had a seed now, a seed to a tree that was weakening - containing - him and maybe all I needed to do was find someplace to plant it.  Not in the graveyard.  That would just return us to the old status quo, to the very situation the devil had singled me out to undo. I couldn’t go back to that.  Grayson was right in that regard - he couldn’t keep stealing bodies.  That had to stop.

“I don’t want to get rid of Grayson,” I said quietly.  “I think… I think in a way, the rain protects campus.”He hadn’t hesitated to kill all the swimmers.  He’d killed that kelpie.  He was keeping things in check and yes, he wasn’t getting rid of *everything* - the flickering man in particular came to mind, at least while he was following Grayson’s rules - I still had to wonder how much worse campus would be without him.  No ancient being was fully benevolent.  They were reflections of humanity, a single shard of a broken mirror, but even that slim aspect had a multitude of angles from which to view the world.  Grayson, no, the *rain*, was far more complex than mere good or evil.

“Look, I know it’s hard, but he made his bad choices and you are not responsible for them,” my former boss said and I felt like this wasn’t the first time she’d had this conversation with someone.  The words felt like she was familiar with them, like she’d used them before.  “You need to let him go and do what’s right for you.”

“I don’t know what’s right.”

“I didn’t say what’s *right*,” my former boss snapped.  “Because what’s ‘right’ is usually decided by like… society and people with lots of money and shit like that.  I said what’s right for *you*.  What *you* want to do.  So what *do* you want?”

What did I want?  I wanted to graduate.  I wanted to remain myself.  I wanted the people I cared about to be safe.  And Grayson… I wanted things to go back to how it felt when I first met him.  When he was just a part of my life like anyone else and there was no visible ulterior motive and he wasn’t desperate and he trying to make choices for me and he wasn’t anything more than just someone I felt safe talking to.

“I, for one,” my manager added dryly, “would like the rain to stop turning me into a monster, so I’m all for trapping him inside a magical tree.”

I wanted to protest that I didn’t know that’s how it worked, but something was turning around in the back of my mind, something *basic*, something so simple that I already knew it long before I started my geology classes.

It was weird that the rain turned people into things, wasn’t it?  And how all the monsters came out in the rain and how the doors in the steam tunnels led to other places.  Like the world was crumbling and the reality we humans knew and clung to couldn’t hold together.

Like it was eroding.

“Holy shit,” I whispered.  “I think I *do* want to plant the seed.”

What happened when it rained and there wasn’t enough plant life?  Erosion.  The rain changing things, turning students into inhumans and back again.  The crumbling of the divide between our world and theirs.  The traveling river, sweeping through our world and then back to where it came from.  The steam tunnels, leading to different places through each door.  And creatures crawling out of that pool of water, finding their way onto campus where the rain, trapped in a human body, could only do so much to remove them again.

The university president had upset the natural order by putting an ancient being into mortal flesh.  Professor Monotone’s ancestor had attempted to reduce the rain’s power by planting a tree.  And maybe that was the right answer, but for the wrong reason, and not in the right spot.  We *did* want a tree, not to trap the rain or to weaken it, but to stabilize the earth.

A live tree.  Not a petrified one this time.  Not a construct of stone, but something that could grow and spread roots and bind the earth to itself so that the world around it wouldn’t continue to disintegrate.  Something that had been given life, that had a soul - souls - inside of it.

And what happened to Grayson after that… well, I couldn’t say for certain, but I felt a wild confidence inside of me that whispered no matter how things ended out, I could just keep working at it until I got the outcome I wanted.  I had my whole life ahead of me to figure it out with.

“I think I need to take this to the gray world,” I said.  “I think that’s where the seed goes.”

Which meant I had to explain that whole concept to my manager and former boss.

“I suppose I could explore the steam tunnels until I found a door that led to somewhere else,” I mused.  “It’d be time-consuming, but it could work.”

Maybe I’d find that hole in the world again and could just toss the seed in and call it a day.

“Great, sounds like a plan,” my manager said tersely.  “Can I please turn the car around now?”

He seemed to want nothing to do with this anymore, so my former boss relented.  She, however, made me promise to call her for help if I needed it.  When I found a doorway into the gray world, she said, don’t go in.  Wait for her.  I didn’t have to do this by myself.  And I told her I would and this time, I really meant it.

The apartment was empty when they dropped me off.  I didn’t think much of it and I texted Cassie to let her know I was home.  After about fifteen minutes of her not responding, I tried again, because with everything going on we’d promised to be good about replying promptly so no one worried.  I checked her schedule on the fridge.  She wasn’t in class.

So I tried calling.  She didn’t answer, so I tried Josh.  He didn’t answer either.

That was when I started panicking.  Josh saw Grayson on the roof, he knew that Grayson was weakening.  So maybe when they realized I was out of town and was going to be out of town for a while…

They decided this was their best shot at getting Maria back without me being anywhere close to danger.

I called Grayson.

He didn’t answer.

So in desperation, I called Professor Monotone.

“My friends are going to do something at the power plant,” I said.  “I don’t know if they should be stopped or not - I don’t know what to do anymore - I don’t want to hurt Grayson but maybe this is the only way to put everything right - I don’t know -”

“How about I just go stall them,” Professor Monotone said firmly.  “And find out what they’re doing and decide for myself what to do about it.”

Strangely enough, that felt rather reassuring.  It wasn’t my responsibility to solve absolutely everything.

I didn’t dare join Professor Monotone at the power plant, because I didn’t want to be in the basement with Grayson.  It would be playing right into what he wanted and I didn’t trust that Cassie and Josh would be enough to stop him, not when my mind was not wholly my own.  

But if I let them go ahead with this, if they succeeded in returning James to Grayson’s body and the rain was returned to its original form - what then?  Would the rain stop?  Or would it continue, restored to full power without mortal flesh to hold it back, enraged by what it had lost?

What happened when the river banks could no longer contain the rain?

Flooding.

I needed into the gray world.  *Now*.  There was the laundry lady’s realm, but she was gone, and it was falling to pieces by now.  I might not even be able to get in.  I needed something certain, something reliable.  Like the worm in the hallway, except I didn’t know if it was targeting anyone new this year and it wasn’t even close to midnight.

There was another creature in the hallway, though.  Something that arrived and exited through a door.

I called my former boss.

“I’m out of time,” I said.  “I need to go now and I know how to do it, but - it’s dangerous.”

“Okay.”  She sounded very calm.  “What do you need me to do?”

I hesitated.  Nothing, really.  There was nothing she could do.  If anything, she would be a liability.

“I’m scared,” I said.  “I don’t want to do this alone.”

And she said she’d come with me.

We met on the steps of the English department building.  It was late evening by this point, so there wouldn’t be classes going on.  We went inside and I explained what we were going to do as we walked down the hallway.  There only sound inside was my voice and the rain pelting the windows.  We found an empty classroom and my former boss waited in the doorway, propping it open while I stood alone in the middle of the hallway.  I took a deep breath.  There was still time to back out.  The seed was warm and heavy in my hands.  I could admit that I didn’t have any confidence that this was what I needed to do and leave.  That I was acting on impulse, I could be safe, I could do nothing, I could take no risks.

But when it mattered, when it *really* mattered, that wasn’t who I was.  I’ve accepted that now.

“C’mon out, you fucker!” I shouted into the empty hallway.  “You know who I am, don’t you?”

I waited, panting.

“Grayson said you couldn’t come out, didn’t he?” I yelled, after a minute of silence.  “Well, he’s not here.  He’s not going to rule campus anymore, once my friends are done with him.”

Still nothing.  There was one last thing I could try and I had a feeling that this would do it.  That there’d be no coming back from it.

“I *ruined* you,” I hissed into the silent building.  “I told *all of them* how you can be BEATEN.  And you’ll never get to hurt *any* of us ever again because of me!”

And somewhere in the building, a door slammed open.

I dove into the classroom and my former boss shut the door behind us.  We crouched on the ground, right up against the wall, so that we’d be out of sight as the creature passed us by.  I tucked my legs close to my chest and squeezed my eyes shut tight.  I could hear it coming, the building groaning as it struggled to contain its body.  Overhead, the lights flickered, strobing the backs of my eyelids with each pulse of light and dark.  

We listened to the rasp of its body scraping against the hallway walls as it approached.  The noise paused just outside the room we sheltered in.  I heard a clicking noise, like a jaw popping, like teeth grinding together.  I heard the creak of the walls like a sigh, steady, rhythmic, in time to the creature’s slow breathing.  I was shaking violently and I clenched my mouth shut, trying to keep my teeth from chattering.  All I could think of was the sound of bones snapping in its jaws and how there wasn’t a whole group of friends to save me, there wasn’t a chain of people to grab my hand and hold me back if it called for me.  I felt small and scared and foolish -

* then my former boss took my hand and squeezed it tight.

I opened my eyes.  She wasn’t looking around, she wasn’t trying to sneak a look at the monster just on the other side of the windows.  She was looking at me and I recognized the stare, firm, unyielding, like when she’d taught me to drive off the possums, because some things had to be done and we were the only ones who could do it.

“It’s okay,” she mouthed at me.

It’s all going to be okay.

And the creature began moving again, scraping past, continuing down the hallway in its search to hunt me out.

My former boss let go of my hand.  I had to do this next part alone.

I rose, careful not to look back at where the creature had gone, and stepped out into the hallway.

Then I ran.  I ran hard and all around me I felt the building shake and a guttural, broken screech echoed down the corridor.  It was coming.  The ground trembled underneath my feet as it came, clawing its way forwards as it tried to catch up, but up ahead I saw the doors gaping open and the darkness beyond.  I ran as if my heart would burst, as if my lungs would collapse in my chest.  I ran, with the seed clutched to my chest, hot enough that it felt like it would sear through my shirt, and then I was through the doorway and underneath a gray sky.",22,1728090750.0,nosleep,2,0.96,False
1fwex44,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1fwex44/m32f32_urgentbad_breakup_between_myself_and_my/, M32-F32 URGENT..Bad breakup between myself and my partner. Having massive impacts on my mental health. Has anyone been through this and how did they come away ? ,"Hey guys needing some help and advice. My partner of a year ended really bad four days ago.(Me being kicked out and sleeping in my car on my birthday no where to go as I don't have family or support in Australia)We have been a little up and down throughout and alot of it has been me being insecure but she did start off the relionship with messaging someone else and it hurt me bad, but the fighting got progressively worse not on my part because I learnt to not call names or dive into it when she got angry and aggressive. I would always try explain my feelings and be emotionally mature. I know what I need to change exactly as I have thought long and hard about this and us living serpately will defuse alot of stress on both of us. I feel this when you do this to me. Can't go wrong with your feeling right ? But she would always get angry or kick off when I would explain it like she hated feeling guilty or she would just loose it and start yelling or aggressive. U want this relionship to work you were the one insecure and controlling all sorts. Would still call me names and what not just got nasty. But i never stopped loving her and she loved me im sure. We had amazing time when we didn't fight but it lead to 4 days ago she lost her shit I tried to console her and she started pushing me and yelling I told her to calm down and relax everything is ok. We will get coffee and have a chill out she kept going and before u know it she was so out of control. So all I wanted to do is hold her while she did this she was scratching and going crazy then she wanted to drive I said babe your not driving your not ok. Please don't so I stood near the door and she was still screaming. So I finally had to let her go and I said please don't do anything silly. Then I go to get a drink and then police are at home with her they arrest me for not being of good behaviour to her as we had a previous history. I honestly don't think I did anything wrong apart from not letting her go as soon as she raised her voice but it came from a good place just wanting to make sure she was ok. So yeah obviously they see it as DV because I didn't let her go when she wanted to and the rest I did tell them I didn't want to let her out of my sights while she was in this mood but they still charged me and now I have to face court. 
I miss her so much but they have imposed no contact so it makes it hard to organise stuff mind you she did ring me and say to email her as she didn't want call logs on her phone. So I guess I will leave it a few days. Find a place and remove my stuff from hers next week. But I do want to work on things and show her what growing I can do and maybe we don't live together anymore but revisit things again. I have written a email for closure for myself that I am happy to share aswell. She said she wants my stuff out for closure so she can move on with her life. I feel like she is doing everything she can to force herself to forget about me. Saying she doesn't want to see or hear my voice etc. I know she loved me and cared for me. Just this happened and now obviously her friends and family will be supporting her. This has taken a massive toll on me and contemplating life atm, but my kids (to another women) are keeping me afloat. ",0,1728090641.0,relationship_advice,6,0.5,False

# The Best Materials for Sling Bags

Material matters—a lot. Not only does it affect the bag’s durability, but it also plays a role in comfort, weight, and weather resistance. Here’s a breakdown of common materials you’ll find in the best sling bags:

* **Nylon**: This is the go-to for durability and water resistance. It’s lightweight and strong, making it perfect for tactical or outdoor sling bags.
* **Polyester**: Another lightweight option that’s often more affordable than nylon, but slightly less durable.
* **Canvas**: For a more rugged, vintage vibe, canvas is great. It’s durable but can be heavier. Canvas bags are often used for casual or fashion-forward sling bags.
* **Leather**: Leather sling bags are typically more stylish and durable, but they’re not the best choice if you plan on getting your bag wet.

When choosing the material, consider how and where you’ll be using your sling bag. For outdoor enthusiasts, **nylon** is probably your best bet for weather resistance and durability. On the flip side, if you want a stylish look for the office or casual outings, **leather** or **canvas** bags are solid options.

# Compartments and Pockets: The Key to Organization

Let’s face it, the more organized your bag is, the less time you’ll spend rummaging around for that one item at the bottom. Here’s what to look for in terms of compartments:

* **Main Compartment**: This is where the bulk of your items go. A good main compartment should be spacious enough for your primary items, like a tablet or a camera.
* **Secondary Compartments**: Smaller compartments for things like sunglasses, chargers, and snacks. Some sling bags also include dedicated spots for pens and notebooks.
* **Hidden Pockets**: Perfect for storing valuables like your wallet or passport while traveling. These pockets are usually located on the back or in a discreet side compartment.
* **Water Bottle Holder**: If you’re constantly on the move, look for a sling bag that includes a side pocket or external loop for your water bottle. Trust me, it’ll come in handy.

A well-compartmentalized sling bag will save you from frustration and keep your essentials exactly where you need them.

# Comfort and Adjustability

Comfort is crucial, especially if you plan to wear your sling bag for extended periods of time. Here’s what to consider:

* **Adjustable Straps**: The ability to adjust your strap to fit your body is key for comfort. Some bags even come with a quick-release buckle for easy on-and-off access.
* **Padded Straps**: Padding makes a huge difference in comfort, especially if you’re carrying heavier items. Look for bags with thick, cushioned straps for added comfort.
* **Ergonomic Design**: Some sling bags are designed to sit better on your back or chest, distributing the weight more evenly so it doesn’t feel like it’s dragging you down.

It’s also worth noting that some sling bags can be worn on either shoulder, giving you flexibility on how you want to carry it.

# Water Resistance and Durability

If you’re planning on taking your sling bag outdoors or using it in unpredictable weather, then water resistance is a must. Here’s what to look for:

* **Water-Resistant Materials**: Most high-quality sling bags are made from nylon or polyester, which naturally repels water. This is ideal for those unexpected rain showers.
* **Waterproof Zippers**: Don’t forget about the zippers! If water seeps through the zipper, it doesn’t matter how water-resistant the material is. Waterproof zippers are a must for truly keeping your gear dry.
* **Reinforced Seams**: Durability isn’t just about the material. Check for reinforced stitching at stress points, like where the strap meets the bag. You don’t want your sling bag falling apart after a few months of heavy use.

Some sling bags come with a built-in rain cover. That’s right, it’s like a tiny raincoat for your bag.

# Different Types of Sling Bags

Now that we’ve covered the features to look for, let’s dive into the different types of **sling bags** available. Depending on your lifestyle, the type of sling bag you choose will vary. Some are designed for rugged outdoor use, while others are perfect for the everyday commuter. Let’s break down the main types so you can find the perfect match for your needs.

# Everyday Carry Sling Bags

If you’re looking for something to carry around town, to the office, or just on casual outings, then an **Everyday Carry Sling Bag (EDC)** is likely your best bet. These bags are compact, lightweight, and designed to carry essentials like your phone, wallet, keys, and maybe even a small tablet.

* **Best For**: Commuting, running errands, light travel.
* **Features**: Smaller compartments, minimal design, often stylish enough to wear in casual or professional settings.

**Pro tip**: Some EDC sling bags come with RFID-blocking pockets, which can keep your cards and personal info safe from digital theft.

# Tactical Sling Bags

Tactical sling bags are the **Swiss Army knives** of the sling bag world. They’re designed for those who need a bag that can withstand the elements, hold a lot of gear, and be ready for anything. Whether you’re into hiking, camping, or you just like the tactical look (no judgment), this type of sling bag is built to be rugged.

* **Best For**: Outdoor enthusiasts, military use, survivalists.
* **Features**: Heavy-duty material (usually nylon), MOLLE webbing for attachments, multiple compartments for organization, and hydration bladder compatibility.

**Fun fact**: MOLLE webbing allows you to customize your tactical sling bag with extra pouches, tools, or even a first aid kit. It’s like building your own personal Bat-bag.

# Travel Sling Bags

If you’re frequently jet-setting or just prefer to travel light, a **travel sling bag** is what you need. These bags are designed to hold all your essentials without weighing you down. They usually feature anti-theft features like lockable zippers, RFID-blocking compartments, and hidden pockets to keep your belongings safe.

* **Best For**: Frequent travelers, airport hopping, day trips.
* **Features**: Lightweight design, anti-theft features, easy access to passport and travel documents.

Travel sling bags are great because they’re small enough to carry onto the plane, yet spacious enough to hold your travel must-haves.

# Camera Sling Bags

For the photographers out there, the **camera sling bag** is a lifesaver. These bags are designed specifically to store your camera and accessories securely while offering quick access to your gear. Many camera sling bags feature padded compartments to protect your equipment and often come with rain covers for unpredictable weather conditions.

* **Best For**: Photographers, vloggers, content creators.
* **Features**: Padded compartments for cameras and lenses, water-resistant materials, external tripod straps.

If you need to quickly grab your camera for that perfect shot, a sling bag makes it easy to swing around and access your gear without missing a beat.

# Fashion/Streetwear Sling Bags

Sometimes, it’s all about the *look*. **Fashion-forward sling bags** are designed with aesthetics in mind. They might not have as many pockets or features as tactical or travel sling bags, but they make up for it with style. If you’re looking for something to complement your streetwear look or make a statement, this is your bag.

* **Best For**: Streetwear enthusiasts, casual outings, fashion-forward individuals.
* **Features**: Sleek designs, trendy colors, minimal compartments.

Fashion sling bags are perfect for anyone who wants to elevate their outfit without compromising on functionality.

# Tactical vs. Casual Sling Bags: Which Should You Choose?

Let’s face it, choosing between a tactical and casual sling bag can be tough. If you’re someone who likes the rugged outdoors, enjoys the tactical look, or just wants something durable, **tactical** sling bags are the way to go. They’re perfect for hiking, camping, or any activity where you need durability and lots of storage options.

On the other hand, if your daily routine involves coffee shops, the office, and the occasional casual outing, then a **casual everyday carry sling bag** is probably more your speed. It’s lightweight, stylish, and won’t feel out of place in more urban settings.

# FAQs about Sling Bags

Choosing the best sling bag can bring up a few questions, especially if you’re new to this compact, versatile style of carry. No worries—we’ve compiled a list of the most common questions to help you make an informed decision. Let’s clear up any lingering doubts you may have about **sling bags** and their uses.

# Are sling bags good for travel?

Absolutely! **Sling bags** are ideal for travel because they offer easy access to your essentials without requiring you to take the bag off. Many travel sling bags even come with anti-theft features like RFID-blocking compartments and hidden pockets, making them perfect for crowded airports or public transportation. Plus, they’re compact enough to fit under airplane seats while still having enough room for passports, wallets, and travel documents.

Look for a travel sling bag with a lockable zipper for added security while you’re on the go.

# Can a sling bag hold a laptop?

This depends on the size of the sling bag. While most **sling bags** can comfortably fit tablets or smaller laptops (up to 13 inches), they’re not designed for carrying larger, full-sized laptops. If you need to carry a laptop regularly, opt for a **larger sling bag** or consider a dedicated laptop backpack instead.

For instance, the **OutdoorMaster Sling Bag** is large enough to fit an iPad or a small laptop, while more compact sling bags like the **Waterfly Crossbody** won’t have the space for larger tech.

# Is a sling bag comfortable for long hikes?

For short day hikes, **sling bags** can be a comfortable and convenient choice, especially if you’re only carrying light gear. Look for options with **padded straps** and **breathable materials** to keep things comfy on longer hikes. Some sling bags, like the **Osprey Daylite Shoulder Sling**, are specifically designed with outdoor use in mind, offering both comfort and durability for a day on the trails.

However, for longer, more demanding hikes where you need to carry extra water, food, or gear, you may want to opt for a full backpack for better weight distribution.

# What’s the difference between a sling bag and a messenger bag?

Though similar, there are some key differences between a **sling bag** and a **messenger bag**. Sling bags are generally more compact, lightweight, and designed for cross-body wear. They’re ideal for carrying smaller essentials and are often worn on the back or chest, with the bag itself typically positioned around the shoulder.

Messenger bags, on the other hand, are larger, with a design that typically allows for carrying more items, like laptops or documents. Messenger bags are often worn over one shoulder, allowing the bag to hang by the hip. They’re a popular choice for office workers and students.

# Can I wear a sling bag under my jacket for safety?

Yes! One of the best features of **sling bags** is their versatility. You can easily wear a sling bag under your jacket or coat for added security, especially when traveling in crowded areas. Many people prefer to wear their sling bag on their chest and under their outerwear to keep valuables safe from pickpockets.

Just make sure the bag is slim enough to remain comfortable when worn under clothing.

# How do I clean my sling bag?

Most **sling bags** are easy to clean and maintain, but the method depends on the material. For **nylon** or **polyester** bags, you can usually spot clean with warm water and mild soap. For **canvas** or **leather** bags, you might need to use a special cleaner designed for those materials.

**A**lways check the care instructions provided by the manufacturer to ensure you don’t damage the bag’s material.

# Final Thoughts on Choosing the Best Sling Bag

Choosing the **best sling bag** ultimately comes down to your specific needs and lifestyle. Whether you’re looking for something stylish and compact for everyday use, or you need a rugged, tactical sling bag for outdoor adventures, there’s a perfect sling bag out there for you.

To recap:

* For **everyday carry**, the **Waterfly Crossbody Sling Backpack** is a top choice for its lightweight design and affordability.
* If you’re all about the outdoors, the **5.11 Tactical RUSH Moab 10** and **Osprey Daylite Shoulder Sling** have you covered with durability and comfort.
* Need something for casual outings with a fashionable twist? The **KAVU Rope Sling Bag** is a stylish choice that doesn’t sacrifice functionality.

At the end of the day, the best sling bag is the one that fits your needs, looks great, and makes your life easier. Happy bag hunting!",2,1728090620.0,TacticalGearReviews,0,1.0,False

I finished chemo end of June, DMX in August, and was doing pretty okay except for some chemo-induced venous insufficiency that I have to wear compression socks for. But other than that, feeling pretty good mentally and physically. Then I started Tamoxifen. Since I have a history of hormonal change sensitivity, I started at 5 mg for a week, then 10 mg for a week. I was about to go up to 20 mg standard dose when I started developing what seem to be neurological issues.

On Monday this week, I was having a semi-business lunch in a nice part of town, and right when I finished my lunch, my hands started tingling, then turning numb, then my hand and finger muscles started cramping - this was happening so fast I had someone call 911, and before the ambulance got there my fingers cramped shut and I couldn't move them, and my hands and wrists turned very red. Of course throw in some panic with all that too, and I get hauled away in an ambulance on a fancy lunch street. My symptoms started to calm down a little in the ambulance, and blood work and chest x-ray were normal, except potassium was borderline low, so they gave me potassium. They didn't do a CT scan or MRI.

I immediately stopped the Tamoxifen and the alpha lipoic acid I was taking for the chemo neuropathy, in case it was caused by one of those.

I happened to have already scheduled my annual physical with my primary two days later on Wednesday. He seemed appropriately alarmed, like I'd want someone to be, took me seriously, ordered a MRI which is scheduled for next week, ordered referral to neurology which I can't get in until November. He said he thinks it's the Tamoxifen though, and he looked up some info on Tamoxifen and apparently it might be that.

Now it's Friday and I've still had milder versions of the hand tingling, numbness, redness, and some hand cramping each day but not the clenched-like cramping like on Monday. Then I woke up at 4 am this morning with pretty forceful body tremors that I took some klonopin for and it calmed down. I've been able to manage all the symptoms with klonopin (which is like xanax, but longer-acting and apparently less addictive - I've rarely taken it until now, but I've had a prescription for it for years). My primary doc said it's fine to take it for a few weeks while we figure it out. I'm still a little freaked out and can't see my oncologist until Oct. 16, and I had to be a squeaky wheel to get that appointment because she's ALWAYS booked 3 months out. 

So my MRI is Monday, to rule out brain metastasis and I guess rule out things like multiple sclerosis. I felt mostly fine until I started Tamoxifen, so I'm not too worried about the MRI, but I am a little scared that I keep getting this reaction, a little bit at work, a little bit more actually after eating, which seems weird. I even quit my coffee in case caffeine was a contributor, and it doesn't seem to make a difference.

I did look into the half life of Tamoxifen and found out it sticks around a while in the body, so maybe it is that and will just take a week or two to feel better. IDK. My primary doc really thinks it's the Tamoxifen.

I feel like I always get the weird things, but has anyone else had anything like this from Tamoxifen?",3,1728090324.0,breastcancer,0,1.0,False

Is anything going to be closed in early December? We are hoping to do the ice caves, cable car, and more. Wondering if paying for a tour is really necessary or if we could do self-guided.

Besides the mountains and scenery, I’m looking for any other MUST SEE/MUST DO things in Chamonix. This includes the best restaurants, stores, coffee shops, etc. that you love and recommend.

First off, this shortage sucks. And the generic also sucks. 

I’ve been trying to use other methods to handle my adhd symptoms without my medication. I’ve only luckily had a few times I have not been able to get my rx. But this past time I won’t be able to get my refill until next week. 
Coffee was always my go to. It never really helped, but it was a little better than nothing. Taking vitamins seemed to help, but honestly helped more when I was taking them with my rx. 
Here comes the part where I am a moron. I was at the store yesterday and saw those stackers pills. I read the ingredients on both (they had the stacker 2 and 3) and the ingredients are things I normally take every day: caffeine, vitamin B. 
I figured why the hell not. I normally drink 5-7 cups of coffee a day anyway, and have been doing that for years. 
I took one about 8 hours ago. Then took a nap. The package said to take one after “each meal”. So I took another about 4 hours ago. It again didn’t anything. Here’s where I fucked up. I wasn’t even thinking, I had my pill box with me, meant to take my fiber pill and took another one. 
Each pill has 200 mgs of caffeine. I did the math and it’s equivalent to the amount of caffeine I drink with my coffee. 
But I feel awful. I’m shaky and nervous. And my anxiety is so bad. I keep drinking water.  I did eat today. I actually ate more than usual. 

It’s been 2 hours since the I took the last one. 

I just need some reassurance that I’m not the only moron who has done this haha. I know I’m fine. But I’m scared for some reason. Doesn’t help I’m at a concert. It’s not a good distraction. 

I’m throwing these out by the way when I get home. Lesson learned.  Any advice is appreciated though. ",2,1728089125.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False
