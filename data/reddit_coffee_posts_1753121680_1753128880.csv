This is the first time ever I have fasted for more than 1 day ( previous record 30 hr but I count that as 1 day ).

The second day was by far the most difficult one, I had really low energy levels and my food cravings were pretty intense. I felt sluggish almost as if drunk or severly sleepy, to the point where driving was something I wasnt entirely comfortable doing.

But then I hit ketosis midway through that day and my energy levels increased and my mind functioned better. This energy level for the rest of the fast would fluctuate somewhat, and I allways felt a bit sluggish in the mind. The particular electrolyte mix I had to drink was nauseating, and I never looked forward to drinking what some of you call snake juice. Food cravings was significantly milder than on the 2nd day but never really left. I also noticed that the smell of food was significantly richer and deeper than it normally is.

I refed with 3 meals of paprika, cucumber, lettuce, 2 slices of bacon and 2 eggs, and for the 2nd and 3rd meal I added a potato. Then 14 hours after first refeed meal I bought a big pizza and ate half of it.",2,1753128744.0,fasting,1,1.0,False

1m5tkzl,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1m5tkzl/the_dull_men_this_might_amuse_you_or_annoy_you/,The Dull Men - This might amuse you or annoy you,"Yes, it is part of a novel, and somehow, despite all odds (and an extensive diversion into researching kettle descaling agents), it's now published.

It's called *The Dull Men*, a book about mugs left to soak, routines that never quite become habits, and the delicate dignity of watching condensation form on double glazing. Lawrence, the protagonist, joins a forum not unlike this one in hopes of... something. Not salvation exactly. Maybe consistency. His name is Lawrence Lawrence and no he doesn't want to talk about it. 

You can find it on Amazon, in print or Kindle, and if you feel moved to read it, I'd be quietly and deeply grateful. Seven copies sold so far, which feels oddly perfect. Like a half-eaten pack of custard creams: enough to share, but not too many to suggest ambition.

  
One

Sunlight fell across my desk in a way that could only be read as accusatory. It suggested that 12:30 p.m. was no time to wake up and face the day. I felt differently. It fell squarely on a crusted-over teaspoon and the topmost book in the pile: The Power of Now, unread since October. It will stay that way. I picked it up once to swat a fly and put it back immediately. I’m not sure why I bought it. To my shame, the sunlight also illuminated scattered mugs where penicillin was happily blossoming. One day, I’ll clean them. It’s just not high on my list of priorities. Currently, it sits below setting fire to my own hair. I had, however, started to classify the mould varieties. The speckled ochre bloom on the Costa Coffee cup suggested last November’s damp. The velvety grey fuzz erupting from the National Trust commemorative mug likely dated back to that particularly bleak stretch post-Christmas, when I cemented my world-class ability to toss Maltesers into my mouth while lying down.

Time, like the dust, had settled over everything. I counted the particles up to a hundred, then gave up. A fruitless exercise. The books stood guard by the radiator in tottering piles. A depressed penguin peered up from the spine of an Orwell book I had abandoned on page 112 while simultaneously abandoning my proletariat phase. Socialism is for the politically active, not the active politician. I am neither. The complete works of Jung stood at a 23-degree angle, which I had discovered was precisely the tilt required to avoid creasing the spine. It had consumed 47 minutes of my Boxing Day. My attempts at self-betterment, fossilised in cellulose and cracked glue.

I sat, as I often did, in the centre of what could be called a living room but only if you worked for an estate agent. In the real world, it was a living room-cum-bedroom-cum-kitchen. I suppose it did suffice for someone who had managed to shrink their life into a single room. Here, a noble collection of half-read novels. Nearby, postcards from people enjoying life more convincingly than I ever had. And in one corner, a stack of marked essays, remnants of academic triumphs now as relevant as the remains of a buffet after a wedding.

Unopened envelopes littered the table: letters from the student loan company, the gym I’d quit attending three months into a year-long contract, a bank that kept offering me credit cards like I had an acceptable credit score. The room had a logic to it, in its way. Everything left where it fell, so nothing ever moved. The futon served as bed and sofa; the rickety table propped up by a folded bit of cardboard I’d become oddly attached to. The unyielding wooden chair held laundry more often than it held me. Like most things here, it had long since become more burdened than used.

At night, the postcard shifted. Not literally, of course, but the Cornish coastline on its front seemed to migrate behind the key bowl, nudged by nothing but the passage of time and some trick of tired perception. I’ve not been back since. It’s unlikely I will again. Not since the funeral. Not since the silence afterwards proved harder to outrun than the event itself.

The radiator coughed. It sounded like it was dying in stages, loudly and at inconvenient hours. If it were a person, you’d call someone. But I just listened. I’d come to recognise its vocabulary and syntax. The sharp clang at 3:17 in the morning meant an incoming struggle, and the midday hiss signalled creeping agoraphobia. We'd developed an understanding, that radiator and I. It withheld heat; I withheld cleaning.

The kettle sat cold and waiting. I filled it to the usual level, watching the water slosh against the metal sides before setting it back on its base and flicking the switch. The familiar click-click-hum filled the air as it began to heat. I counted silently in my head and waited. The kettle’s second click arrived with papal infallibility. I measured my existence in these intervals. The 122 seconds between switch flick and salvation, each millisecond variance logged in the craters of my brain. I could recite the steps like liturgy. First, I waited for the second click. Never the first, which was little more than a plaintive whine of half-hearted commitment. Two heaped teaspoons of ASDA Smart Price instant followed (2021 batch; the 2023 formulation lacked the gravelly texture), then precisely 237ml of water, measured through an old NHS measuring cup that still had remnants of sticker glue on the side. Stirring came last, exactly fourteen times clockwise. Widdershins, I’d discovered, provoked mild arrhythmia.

The ritual crystallised during that terrible fortnight after graduation when time melted into a viscous pool. I'd discovered the superiority of clockwise during The Great Stirring Schism of '22 which was a 37-hour caffeine bender testing spiral versus concentric methods. The data proved incontrovertible: clockwise dissolution prevented dreaded powder archipelagos. But today, something was off. 124 seconds. Two seconds too long. That couldn’t stand. The routine must not be interrupted. It must never be interrupted.

Four steps to the bathroom. Not three. Not five. My feet traced each fissure in the floor, memorised through repetition. Clear the rug island, IKEA 2023. Navigate the Book Sinai while staring menacingly at Proust vol.2, a vain attempt to scare it into submission. Avoid the Death Tile, loosened by last week’s Mug Incident. A new step, but fast becoming a favourite. Finally, palm the doorframe, skimming the chip at 172cm, a relic of the ill-advised dartboard phase. Toothbrush, toothpaste, the ritual scrubbing. Rinse, spit, wipe. Face splashed with water just shy of freezing, the shock of it chasing away any lingering fuzziness. Towel, patted dry, folded and replaced on the rack with militant precision.

The pens awaited inspection on return. Three pens lay in perfect parallel, equidistant from each other. Blue, black, red. Lined up like soldiers awaiting orders. I couldn't remember the last time I'd actually used them for anything more than this morning ceremony, but still, I straightened them each day, taking a strange solace in the small act of control. The blue pen had roughly 87% ink remaining. A newer purchase. Reliable. Will need to use it more so it doesn’t feel left out. The black was at 62%, a workhorse of a pen. The red was at 34%, used for highlighting amounts left on student loans and overdraft fees.

The flat was quiet, as it ever was. Outside, the distant hum of traffic ebbed and flowed like a half-heard conversation, punctuated occasionally by the bark of a dog or the slam of a car door. Inside, the silence was broken only by the soft creaks of the old building settling into itself, the aged joists and beams sighing like weary bones. The radiator cleared its throat, a bronchial rattle that meant “You’ve lingered too long.” I adjusted red pen by 3° west. The world held its breath. Nothing changed.

The evenings were when the restlessness set in. As the sun dipped below the horizon and the shadows stretched across the floor like spilled ink, I would find myself gravitating towards the cold glow of my laptop screen, as if I were a moth with administrative tasks. This, too, had become a routine: endless scrolling through news sites, job listings, social media feeds that served only to reinforce a sense of distance from the world and its events. I opened too many tabs, closed them with no more certainty than when I had opened them, and repeated the cycle with the kind of resigned persistence one might reserve for the washing-up or the bins. Tonight the tabs metastasised in digital mitosis. There were fourteen job portals which all required passion for innovation and Excel proficiency. Seven tabs with abandoned baskets. I could not decide on a new kettle. I had paused at the payment page at John Lewis. Such big decisions needed more time. Niche forums dedicated to topics I had no real interest in - vintage typewriter maintenance, the mating habits of obscure beetle species, conspiracy theories about the origins of the Oxford comma. And always, the Wikipedia rabbit holes. A stray thought would snag on a word or a phrase, and before I knew it, I would be seven pages deep into the history of lighthouse construction, or the biography of some minor 18th century aristocrat, my brain stuffed with facts I would never have cause to use. One job description I had kept open required five years’ experience in medieval codicology, to be fluent in Latin, Old English, and Excel, and demanded that I could thrive in fast paced environments. Of course I could, the morning kettle ritual was the peak of fast paced. The salary was £21,000 with no London weighting (not applicable).

I composed treatises that would go nowhere. The 14,000 words in my Eddystone Lighthouse document were desperate to be added to. I checked the references were in the required format (Harvard style). They were. The middle 2,000 words were possibly superfluous, but I couldn’t bear to delete them. They had tried. The bibliography was a masterpiece. It included 18th century tide charts and a 2003 GeoCities page. This could be my finest work yet. I saved it into the swelling lighthouse folder on my desktop.

Time slipped with an insidiousness that comes from staring at a digital clock, each minute a testament to time passing but not progressing. I attempted to impose a kind of logic upon my browsing, alternating between productivity and distraction, but found it difficult to discern where one ended and the other began. The laptop fan whined like a distant train but one that was in pain. It was dying. Like everything else. The screen began to burn afterimages into my retinas. Phantom menus floated across the pizza box fossilising on the carpet. Somewhere beneath the takeaway debris lay my notebook, its last entry three weeks old and concerning entirely on failed job interviews. A list that expanded exponentially.

By 9:37pm I'd developed a system. Each browser tab represented a possible future self-glimmering in the digital murk. Here, the me who finally replied to LinkedIn connections (""Congratulations on your promotion, though I can't for the life of me recall your face""). There, the me engrossed in a 114-page thesis comparing Victorian streetlamp designs to circadian rhythms. That particular PDF had cost me £8.50 through an academic portal, charged to a credit card I might not even own anymore. Suddenly, Dr. Ellsworth’s voice intruded: “Your methodology is admirably rigorous, but one wonders if categorising every 19th-century cab driver in Leeds isn't rather... circumscribed?” I nearly spilled Asda coffee granules onto yesterday’s socks.

I had started off researching the history of the ballpoint pen - a noble endeavour, to be sure - but had somehow ended up on a page dedicated to vintage chewing gum wrappers, my cursor hovering over an embedded link titled ""The Peculiar Appeal of the Mundane."" One click, and I was tumbling down yet another rabbit hole. This one led to a forum, buried deep within the forgotten recesses of the internet. ""The Dull Men of Great Britain,"" the header proclaimed in a font that looked like it hadn't been updated since the days of dial-up modems and AOL chat rooms.

At first glance, the layout was almost charmingly retro, all clunky graphics and rudimentary HTML. The threads, displayed in a simple list format, bore titles that seemed to compete for the crown of most banal. ""The Repainting of Grit Bins - Spring 2022 Edition,"" one announced, alongside a blurry photograph of what appeared to be a small yellow container on a street corner. ""UK's Roundabout of the Year,"" another declared, accompanied by a dizzying collage of aerial shots depicting various circular intersections. ""Traffic Cone Spotting: Norfolk vs. Lincolnshire,"" a third enthused, the header adorned with a clip-art illustration of a stylised orange cone.

My laugh came out as more of a nasal exhale, fogging the screen. The forum threads read like a particularly sedate Radio 4 schedule:

""Best Practices for Bus Shelter Mural Preservation (vandalism considerations)""

""Show Us Your Sponsored Roundabout Flowerbed!""

""Official 2022 Benchmarking of Public Toilet Hand Dryer Decibel Levels""

Some people had too much time on their hands.

I clicked ""View More"" with the clinical detachment of a sociologist studying cults. The usernames alone were a study in absurdity: ConeZone94, BinManBarry, RoundaboutRick. One prolific poster, the self-styled ""EggManEd,"" documented the daily temperature decay of boiled eggs left to languish on his windowsill, complete with meticulously annotated graphs and charts. I bookmarked the egg chart. For research, obviously.

To my surprise, or perhaps enjoyment, there was more. User BinManBarry opened with: ""Re: Spring 2022 Grit Bin Rollout - The Durham contingent continues with Dulux Weathershield 'Hedge Maze' (BS4800:00A09). Lincolnshire's switch to 'Parsley Butter' must be CONTESTED."" Seven replies followed, including attachments from the Highways Agency handbook. My mouse hovered over the ""Join Discussion"" button. The radiator gurgled its disapproval.

By 1:46am, I'd mapped members by avatar. Rotary clotheslines dominated the over-sixties contingent. Younger posters favoured council logo watermarks. A thread titled ""Optimal Leaf Collection Cadence - Experience from Bracknell"" contained shockingly elegant diagrams. When I found myself nodding along to a debate about heritage lamppost restoration grants, the realisation hit with the force of a misjudged speed bump - these weren't eccentrics. These were professionals. The street outside echoed with Friday night stragglers. Their laughter sliced through the double glazing as I studied a photo essay on concrete bollard weathering patterns. Someone had captioned a moss-flecked specimen outside Bury St Edmunds Sainsbury's: ""Fig. 1 - Splendid patina development since 2018 relocations"". My toes curled in their M&S socks. Whether in horror or admiration, I couldn't say.

At 2:03 a.m., I discovered the 'Projects' subforum. Sixteen pages documented a member's quest to catalogue every Tesco car park gradient in Yorkshire. Scrolling became hypnosis - each post a perfectly squared-off brick in some vast municipal edifice of tedium. When the bathroom pipes shuddered awake I startled like a teenager caught with a naughty website open, slamming the laptop shut. The afterglow of the screen lingered in geometric patterns behind my eyelids. Forum headings burned into my optic nerves like canal boat registry numbers.

I re-opened the laptop and my finger hovered over the trackpad. I knew I should close the tab, return to aimless scrolling and my quest for distraction. But instead, almost without thinking, I found myself clicking on the ""New User Registration"" button, a strange sense of anticipation fluttering in my chest. Perhaps, I thought, as I began to fill in the requisite fields, there was something to be learned from the dull men and their quiet enthusiasms. Perhaps, in the grand scheme of things, there was a certain nobility to be found in the embrace of the unremarkable, the celebration of the mundane.

Or perhaps I was just tired, my judgment clouded by the late hour and the endless blue light of the screen. Either way, as I typed out my new username - ""PenMan87,"" a nod to newish blue pen- I couldn't help but feel a small thrill of something that might have been belonging, or at least the tentative promise of it.

It was the sixth consecutive night of browsing The Dull Men forum and the eggs were confessing their secrets. User TempTracker91 had mounted a kitchen thermometer to his windowsill using Blu-Tack and what appeared to be a hairpin. His daily posts charted temperature decay curves of boiled Hen Crown eggs with the solemnity of a coroner’s report. “Day 43: Midges alighting on Sample B may have skewed results. Commencing replicate trials.” I watched condensation bead on my own neglected mug as the forum's minutiae colonised my vision. I still needed a new kettle. I was never much of a fan of poetry, but I suspected I would nominate BinManBarry as Poet Laureate. “Weybridge Sainsbury’s: 3 x 120L EuroCubs, lid alignment 87° from true north.” Each entry timestamped with the exactitude of a naval log.

However, Barry of bin fame was outdone by the ConeZone94 manifesto. Running to twenty-seven meticulous pages, he had photographed every traffic cone along the A217 between 2016–2024, charting their “migrations” during roadworks. Close-ups captured moss growth on PVC surfaces. The comment section brimmed with pensioners arguing over HGV airflow effects on cone placement. At 3:17 a.m., I found myself Googling 'cone anchoring protocols,' a cold chip congealing on the plate beside me. The basil plant on my windowsill drooped in judgemental silence. Three weeks prior, I’d killed a succulent by overwatering during a particularly dire job application spree. I’d once tried to name the basil plant, thinking it might live longer if someone were rooting for it. But it didn’t. Nothing does.

On the seventh night, it was the post about watering plants at 7:14 that finally did me in. Not 7:10, not 7:15, but precisely 7:14. I first noticed it when a sidebar blinked: “Gerald67East has posted in Cultivating order”. The thumbnail showed a fern frond dusted with what might have been fertiliser or ash. My cursor hovered; it wanted to explore the Dorset vs Wiltshire hedge-trimming battle instead. But something about Gerald67East needed further examination.

In painstaking detail, he described the careful arrangement of his plant-watering schedule: a morning ritual conducted with the exactitude of a military manoeuvre. 7:14, every morning, without fail, each plant receiving its measured allotment of water. My microwave clock read 19:17. I pressed a thumb against the smudged screen as if late-century Braille might explain why this man’s begonias demanded military timing. Seven readings later, patterns emerged. Gerald used ""terracotta unit"" instead of ""pot."" Referenced rainfall probabilities only to dismiss them. The plants themselves were reduced to variables - ""Subject C (fern, Boston) shows 12% increased frond rigidity post-calcium nitrate supplement."" Yet beneath the clinical detachment lay something queasily human: the insistence on 7:14 sharp, a timestamp that bled through the screen like tea through biscuit crumbs.

He wrote of the ritual with a reverence that bordered on the spiritual, describing the way the plants seemed to perk up at his approach, their leaves rustling in anticipation of the life-giving liquid. He spoke of the satisfaction he found in the consistency, the way the simple act of tending to his botanical charges brought a sense of order to his days.

I clicked through to his profile, hoping for some clue, some breadcrumb trail that might lead me to the heart of the mystery. But there was little to be found: just a location (Eastbourne) and a profile picture featuring a particularly lush potted fern. No personal details, no hints at the life behind the carefully scheduled waterings.

I felt a flicker of frustration as I navigated back to the post. It seemed unfair, somehow, that Gerald could dangle such an enigma and then withhold the key to its solution. I wanted to know the man behind the ritual, to understand the private meaning behind the public display of horticultural devotion.

By Thursday, my basil developed root rot. Gerald’s profile still offered nothing but a fern photo. The shadow angle suggested 3pm sunlight in late March. Eastbourne’s weather records showed partial clouds that day. At 19:14 on Sunday, I stood barefoot in a puddle of spilled water, chanting Bing! Bong! along with the BBC News theme wafting from the television. I found myself posting comments on the thread, tentative at first, then with growing boldness. ""Fascinating routine, Gerald,"" I wrote, my fingers hesitating over the keys. "" I'm curious, why 7:14 specifically? Does that time hold a special meaning for you?"" His reply arrived as I scraped mould off a plate I found under the futon. How long had it been there? I ceased to measure days, just Gerald’s posts. ""It just felt right."" The words hung like a challenge written in steam. I took my temperature, 36.2°C, perfectly average, then googled Eastbourne dementia rates. The basil watched from its swamp, quietly aghast at what we’d become. My kettle chose that moment to whistle the opening bars of ""Greensleeves.""

By Tuesday, I'd graduated to auditing Gerald's comment history using colour-coded highlighters. Each interaction revealed terrifying competence- advice on pruning shears tempered with caveats about seasonal sap viscosity. His refusal to engage with my ""Why 7:14?"" queries felt like finding margin notes in a library book only to discover they're just overdue stamps. My basil plant was not faring any better. I saluted the dripping windowsill with a measuring jug, half-expecting a blue plaque to materialise: ""Here stood a man who once almost watered correctly.""

Late into the night, I returned to the post with the relentlessness of a dog with a bone. 7:14, it taunted, with each tick of the clock. Not 7:15, not 7:10. I began to laugh at my own absurdity, aware of the irony but unable to resist. The only thing more ridiculous than Gerald's devotion to his routine was my own fixation on it. I conceded that Gerald had ensnared me. I was as captive to his obsession as he was to the tiny increments of time that defined him. It was, I thought, with a mix of amusement and a trace of envy, the dullest and most brilliant trap I had ever seen.

In a fit of both curiosity and resignation, I attempted to engage directly with Gerald again. ""Have you ever experimented with other times?"" I asked, like an aspiring scientist hoping for a breakthrough. Gerald’s response, as precise as it was uninformative, left me both amused and unsatisfied. ""I find this time suits best."" He signed each message with ""G,"" as if an initial lent gravitas to his reluctance to elaborate. I was undeterred. ""Would love to know why 7:14 works so well for you!"" I prodded, hoping a dash of exclamation might elicit a fuller reply. His answer came swiftly: ""I see no reason to change it."" This both infuriated and intrigued me. What kind of man guards the secrets of his plants so closely? Gerald, it seemed, had perfected the art of strategic vagueness. A sort of horticultural sphinx, doling out riddles instead of instructions. I considered, briefly, the possibility that Gerald was simply messing with me. That the sacred 7:14 was arbitrary, chosen not by data or instinct, but whim. But no, there was too much intention behind it all. I doubted Gerald, or G, would use the forum for his own sick games. My fixation grew. In another thread, he shared his enthusiasm for optimal weather conditions: ""East winds are favourable."" It was, I began to realise, more than a hobby. It was a way of life, one that he narrated with a passion so detailed it was almost mathematical. It was as if I had become a student at the Gerald School of Dullness, eagerly lapping up lessons in the art of being.

I started to research Eastbourne, the home of this mystery man who could condense the universe into increments of time and habit. The more I delved, the more I pictured a small town with a row of identical semi-detached houses, each containing its own Gerald clone, each timing their obsessions down to the last specific second. It was a vision that both amused and thrilled me. It was a strange sort of intimacy, this imagined understanding of a life I'd never witnessed. And yet, I couldn't shake the feeling that Eastbourne held the key to the mystery, that if I could just walk those streets, breathe that air, I might somehow find my way to the heart of the 7:14 enigma.

 

# Three

Late one night, as the glow of my laptop cast the flat in an eerie half-light, I found myself drafting a message to Gerald. ""I've been thinking about your watering routine,"" I wrote, my fingers hesitating over the keys. ""The precision of it, the devotion. It's really struck a chord with me. Would you be open to meeting up sometime? I'd love to see your setup in person, maybe compare notes on plant care.""

I stared at the words, feeling a flutter of trepidation in my chest. It was a bold move, I knew, an overture that could easily be seen as intrusive, even creepy. I tried to imagine how I might feel, receiving such a message from a faceless stranger on the internet.

And yet, I couldn't bring myself to delete the words. There was something about the prospect of meeting Gerald, of standing face to face with the man whose simple ritual had come to mean so much to me, that felt almost inevitable. As if the universe itself was conspiring to bring us together, two solitary souls connected by a shared fascination with the mundane.

I took a deep breath, feeling the air catch in my lungs. My finger hovered over the ""Send"" button, trembling slightly.

This was madness, I knew. A flight of fancy born of too many sleepless nights and too much time spent staring at a glowing screen. And yet, I could feel the pull of it, the siren song of an adventure waiting to unfold.

I hit ""Send,"" and the message disappeared into the ether, a digital bottle cast out onto an uncertain sea.

The new basil plant, Basil II, sat on the windowsill, its leaves rustling softly in the breeze from the cracked window, unaware of the fate that befell its predecessor. I looked at it, feeling a sudden rush of affection for this small, green companion that would bear witness to my strange obsession.

""Wish me luck,"" I whispered, feeling slightly foolish.

The plant, ever stoic, kept its own counsel. But as I turned back to the glowing screen, the thrill of anticipation thrumming through my veins, I could have sworn I saw its leaves dip slightly, as if in a secret nod of encouragement.

At 1:54am cycling routes made themselves known. Google suggested 5 hours 43 minutes from London to Eastbourne via the A24. The elevation chart resembled a cardiogram flatlining near Crawley. My rucksack, last used for a catastrophic Glastonbury trip, still harboured a 2019 train ticket stub in its meshy entrails. I began compiling supplies with the focus of a polar expedition: blister plasters, a windbreaker advertising ""Dave's Bait & Tackle,"" and the laminated A-Z where Cornwall had been torn out.

Gerald's reply arrived as I debated whether biodegradable toilet paper constituted hubris. ""Mr. East regrets he is unable to accommodate visitors at this time."" The response bore the sterile politeness of a parking fine appeal rejection. Yet there, nestled between the lines like a weed in pavement cracks - he hadn't said no to meeting. Just ""at this time."" I could not give up.

The cursor pulsed like a failing lighthouse as I deleted ""kind regards"" for the eighth time. My message to Gerald now read like a hostage note composed by a particularly nervous librarian. Outside, rain smeared the streetlights into something resembling tears.

Version 4.2 began: ""Dear Mr. East, I'm researching modern rituals and wonder if you might spare 14 minutes..."" Too anthropological. Version 6.7 flirted with casual deceit: ""Fellow plant enthusiast here!"" The basil sneered audibly. By midnight, the draft had shed all pretence: ""I water things too, though badly. Tell me why 7:14 or I'll cycle to Sussex and lurk outside your begonias.""

The send button dissolved my bravado. I cleaned the keyboard with a sock, extracting three weeks' worth of crisp fragments and a hair that might have been the first sign of stress induced male pattern baldness. The fridge light exposed my reflection as a nocturnal creature - pupils dilated from forum blue light, t-shirt stained with proof-of-concept band merchandise.

His reply arrived during a catastrophic spaghetti hoops incident. The microwave clock blinked as I parsed his response: ""I shall await your arrival. 79 Sycamore Road. Two days hence."" No smiley face. No query about my planned route or protein bar preferences.

In the early morning, hunting plasters for a paper cut injury, I found Mum's unopened ""Career Crossroads!"" card beneath the sink. The bike leaned against the fridge, its odometer still reading 2.3 miles from the Sainsbury's debacle. Rain blurred the window as I pressed play on a ""South Downs Cycling Hazards"" YouTube series. Somewhere in Eastbourne, a man lifted his watering can precisely as the BBC news theme faded. The journey ahead terrified me. Not the hills nor the traffic, but the moment when 7:14 simply became a minute like any other - and I'd have to stop counting.",2,1753128694.0,books,0,1.0,False

1m5tk7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1m5tk7c/has_anybody_had_trouble_shaking_off_their_toxic/,Has anybody had trouble shaking off their toxic former job?,"At the end of last year I left a job I'd been in for just over a decade that was becoming increasingly toxic and unstable, but was then fortunate enough to quickly land a new one in the same field that was a great fit with my qualifications. I hit the ground running (admittedly with no time off in between, I was so freaked out about the bloodbath that is the current job market) and was feeling great for the first few months, but since then have struggled a bit more to stay motivated. New Job is 100% WFH, which I totally get that a lot of people would kill for these days. I'm the kind of person for whom 100% WFH actually isn't ideal because I do better with people around me to keep my energy level up, so that's part of the challenge, but I know there are ways around this -- build a routine, put in non-meeting time at the library/coffee shop/other co-working or third space. WFH also is how I can stay in my current home state, which is small with a job market to match.

The bigger issue is that I can't shake off the toxic stuff from my former job. I still recycle in my head the frustrating exchanges I had over the years, the belittling comments, the projects that got mired in personality conflicts, the things I wish I'd said, the things I wish I hadn't. It very much feels like a roadblock to moving forward career-wise -- I'm scared to take big leaps in my new role for fear I'll get smacked down, though there is no evidence of that and the vibe is very different. I am trying hard to set boundaries (Old Job culture frankly encouraged us not to, in terms of work-life balance but even more in terms of belief in the organization's identity and mission) and avoid letting job performance be a referendum on my self-esteem writ large, as opposed to a discrete thing I can calmly work to improve over time.

Anyway, my favorite old co-worker, who is also a friend who I am glad to be hanging on to, reached out recently to say she could use a sympathetic ear about how things are going at Old Job (my departure coincided with the arrival of new leadership). I thought, maybe this will be a chance to remind myself that I left this place for a reason. Before I left, I would say this person was doing fairly well, certainly not struggling to the degree I was. But as she revealed when we met up yesterday, things have continued to spiral in the toxic and unstable direction, though outwardly they put on a good and enthusiastic face. She is worried about her future and looking around for other opportunities. I felt good about being able to be an encouraging and sympathetic ear for her, still being well-informed about the people and challenges involved. I then went on with the enjoyable remainder of my Sunday ... but when I went to bed last night, I proceeded to spend most of it tossing and turning thinking about all I'd heard. Barely slept a wink. Instead of just feeling sympathy for her and inward relief for myself (because this was enormous confirmation that I dodged one of the biggest bullets of my life by leaving when I did), it was like I had put myself back into the skin I was wearing in Old Job, even though I know that Old Job has no power over me whatsoever anymore.

Has anyone else experienced this, and if so, how did you shake it off? Just time, focus and progress at New Job? Or did you need more? I had a therapist when I was in the thick of misery at Old Job, and I felt like I wasn't making any headway at that time. Maybe it's time to go back and unpack some things with the help of a new therapist?",1,1753128645.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False

1m5ti45,https://www.reddit.com/r/complaints/comments/1m5ti45/trump_is_on_the_list/,"Trump is on ""the list""","So apparently my wife has what she calls a “celebrity freebie list”. That hypothetical list of famous people you’re “allowed” to sleep with if the stars align.

Her top pick? Donald. Freaking. Trump.

Now, I get it, some people are into power. Some people are into money. Some people are into… whatever you’d call that particular shade of orange. But this man is not exactly what I imagined when we said “hall pass.” I assumed she’d pick someone like Chris Hemsworth, or at worst, Jason Momoa with a mullet. But no. She wants to be subpoena’d into pleasure.

I asked her why, and she said ""There's just something about his powerful presence"" I stared at her in silence, trying to figure out if she was joking or having a stroke

Now I lie awake at night, wondering if she gets turned on every time we pass a gold elevator or when someone misspells “coffee” on a tweet.  
  
To make things weirder, her boyfriend is a pretty vocal Trump supporter. Enough that I’ve seen a framed photo of Tucker Carlson in his home office and once overheard him say, ""The media wants you to hate him because he tells the truth.""  
  
I’m not even mad. I’m just confused. Is this a kink? A cry for help? A power move? Should I start combing my hair forward and yelling at CNN just to compete?

At this point, I’m just hoping I’m still above Rudy Giuliani on her list.

But I'm truly the last option and the end of the line for this animal.  She is fourteen years old and has never been spayed. Behavior issues are a thing with this cat!

**After the Trial (TW: Alcoholism, Suicide Attempt)**

So, considering Ryoba's trial pretty much ruined this poor man's life, the fact that he fell deep into alcoholism is understandable to say the *very* least. So as far as the canon goes, I *am* gonna keep that part in. Aside from that, there's gonna be a lot of changes to things like the timeline of events and how things happened.

After the trial, Seiji skips town for a while and works as a cashier at a crummy liquor store in a shady part of town that didn't really give a shit about the Ryoba Aishi trial, or at least the way it painted him, to make ends meet, which made his alcoholism all the worse since he had easy access to cheap alcohol thanks to his employee discount. He cut Sonoko out of his life for good after she testified against Ryoba, and after about five years of this painful spiral (and many hospitalizations for both mental and physical reasons), Seiji lost all hope of having even a semblance of a normal life, and decided to put himself out of his misery- but a moment of hesitance would change his life forever. Before going through with his attempt, Seiji desperately called into a suicide hotline to get everything off of his chest (since he assumed no one would care enough to find his body and by extension the tapes he'd recorded up to that point), the woman on the other end of the line patiently listening to him for hours as he sobbed his heart out, telling her the truth behind the Ryoba Aishi case and how it ruined his life. And unlike everyone else in his life...she believed him. Every last word affected her so much, she decided to break protocol.

*Hotline Operator: ...sir?*

*Seiji Ito: Y-Yes...?*

*Hotline Operator: Can you please tell me your address?*

Assuming she was asking so she could send an ambulance, Seiji obliged and told her his address, only for the line to go dead soon after, the veil of intimacy ended. He should've expected it- it was *only* a hotline after all. It's not like they could have any real connection with just one of their hundreds of daily callers...

...he thought, until he heard a knock at the door.

She'd called out of work early to personally check on him. Be it out of pity or genuine concern, Seiji appreciated the gesture- even if he was too drunk to string it into words. He passed out not long after he let her inside, but that didn't deter her, the woman carrying him to his bedroom to lie down- only to be mortified by the absolute squalor he'd been living in- she couldn't just let him go back to living in what was practically a barely contained biohazard dump site, not after everything he'd told her. As he slept, she meticulously cleaned as much of his apartment as she could- dishes, carpets, clothes, garbage- if it was in that apartment, it was given the scrubbing of its life. Unsure of what else to do once the apartment was cleaned, and with Seiji still asleep, she did the only thing she could do- she left a note on his nightstand saying she was worried, and that she wanted to see him again, leaving her name, phone number, and address in case he ever wanted to visit, and when Seiji woke up hours later, he finally had a name to put to the face of the angel that had more or less saved his life:

**Aina Yamada**

[A rough mock-up of what I imagine Aina would look like that I made in Custom Mode \(with a lot of help from FireAlpaca\)](https://preview.redd.it/x1gphg121aef1.png?width=428&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8bc925ae964e7b21ae3d51830df94cd53ea1e73)

She was an aspiring children's author that worked at the local suicide hotline, and she quickly became the only light in his life. It initially began with them meeting once a week, which increased to twice a week, all the way up until they found themselves spending the night at each other's apartments almost every night, sharing a bed, talking about the future...for the first time in five years, Seiji ***finally*** had something- or rather, someone- to live for, and it wasn't long before the two started dating, eventually having a small courthouse wedding with Aina's family in attendance, Seiji's parents still unwilling to reconnect with their son despite it being five years since the aftermath of the Ryoba Aishi trial- and now, he was fine with that. He had a new family- one he could build with the love of his life, buying a home with her and taking her last name to distance himself from his painful past. Seiji was unfortunately still an alcoholic, but Aina knew the road to healing from addiction was a long and bumpy one, and she never stopped supporting Seiji through both his periods of sobriety and relapses- but he cut alcohol off for good when Aina told him the best news of his life- she was pregnant. He was going to be a father.

And with a baby on the way, Seiji was more determined than ever to give up drinking- and by the baby's due date, Seiji had been nearly six months sober, and was starstruck when he first saw his baby boy- a boy he and Aina would go on to name Taro Yamada.

**Family Life**

After Taro was born, Seiji gave up drinking completely (only drinking in *very* rare social situations- previously he'd only allowed himself one drink or two drinks a week), even gave up smoking for good measure, and dedicated himself to being the best stay-at-home dad he could be, spending lots of time with Taro as he grew up- teaching him how to ride a bike, buying him his [favorite plushie](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81kFZ4sjsPL._UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg), and play-wrestling with him in the living room, but Taro's favorite memories from his childhood are when both Seiji and Aina would sit with him in the backyard and watch the dragonflies with him, causing Taro to develop a large interest in the creatures.

When Taro was five, Seiji began to notice the way Taro seemed to be ostracized from his peers, and not for his father's reputation (which had thankfully faded by then)- he often struggled to make eye contact, missed what many would consider ""obvious"" social cues, got in trouble for being fidgety in class, and would spend all of his free time at (and outside of) school reading and learning about dragonflies, even getting Seiji called in for a parent-teacher conference after Taro began falling behind his classmates due to him skipping assignments in favor of learning about his special interest, his only friend being a neighborhood girl named Osana. Both Seiji and Aina had a feeling something was different about their boy, and weren't exactly surprised when he was diagnosed with autism- if anything, they were relieved since they could support him even better. Due to Aina's job at the hotline's office, Seiji often ended up being the one guiding Taro through his meltdowns, leading to him becoming Taro's 'person' for lack of an exact term (best way I can describe it is that Seiji is like a comfort character to him only he's a real person in Taro's life).

When Taro was six, Aina ended up getting pregnant again, this time with a girl she and Seiji would go on to name Hanako- but the delivery wasn't so smooth this time, as Aina ended up suffering rather serious complications that would affect her for the rest of her life...one she unfortunately didn't have much time left to live. Not long after Hanako's fifth birthday, Aina suffered a horrific internal hemorrhage while Seiji was out running errands and the kids were at school, her body only discovered when an eleven-year-old Taro came home from middle school to find his mother on the floor, the trauma leading him to not speak for months after she died. Seiji was, understandably, devastated- but unlike in the canon where he left his daughter to practically raise herself, he knew Aina would've wanted to him to go on without her and keep their kids safe and cared for, regardless of whether she was there to see it or not, so he worked his ass off to make sure they ***knew*** how much he loved them- he got a job as a secretary at a local law firm, taught them how to cook and clean so they wouldn't be helpless as adults (even when he was exhausted after work), always helped them with schoolwork they couldn't understand (again, even when he was exhausted), and always tried to make time to bond with them. Taro hated seeing his dad so overworked, but Seiji refused to let Taro grow up fast to compensate, telling him to enjoy his youth and to let his old man take care of the serious stuff.

Around this time, Taro made two more friends- Toga Tobara and Budo Masuyama, two boys who, along with Osana, would remain friends with Taro, especially after they were all accepted into Akademi High School following their middle school graduation. Hanako, on the other hand, while she did make friends with a girl named Asumi Kurudo, struggled with a large amount of guilt following their mom's death- despite Seiji's constant reassurance that it wasn't her fault, Hanako only felt worse about it as she got older- if she hadn't been born, their mom would still be here, right? That's something she thought about every day since Aina passed, and it hurt Seiji to see his daughter struggle like this- as a result, he ended up unintentionally babying her a bit more than he would otherwise, often taking her shopping for their father-daughter days out, which led to her amassing a fairly large collection of [P](https://images-cdn.ubuy.co.in/6688142fb9c14c2de6169ef4-polly-pocket-travel-toys-purse-playset.jpg)[o](https://target.scene7.com/is/image/Target/GUEST_0a2b6979-16ea-4ef2-bdee-26407234d97a)[l](https://letsplaygames.co.nz/media/iopt/catalog/product/cache/b49bbccb5637c9d5f85576bbf8857d81/4/5/45813636956190.webp)[l](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81WyPa5wMmL._AC_SL1500_.jpg)[y](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/818eO8Fp4EL._AC_SL1500_.jpg)[ ](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltc12136c3b9f23503/bltbfc88903c689bf4f/6876d11ff6f30e775495d646/PPxGCDS_PR1.jpg)[P](https://images.mattel.net/images/c_scale,f_auto,w_360/shop-us-prod/files/004798e99fc934fc0ebf83daaef16a471aceb2f6/.jpg)[o](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81pOTv0u76L.jpg)[c](https://creations.mattel.com/cdn/shop/files/v3di25gp6nkgyu4ivh5f_327c47dd-cdb2-402b-937f-affccff232fd.jpg?v=1724707241)[k](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81nbp9thyzL.jpg)[e](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81WyPa5wMmL._AC_SL1500_.jpg)[t](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81xMgtvY9KL._AC_SL1500_.jpg)[s](https://target.scene7.com/is/image/Target/GUEST_cb295bde-3ef3-42c0-9ba7-a0df74daa1b3)[,](https://target.scene7.com/is/image/Target/GUEST_57dc1a96-5404-4bee-ae87-06cbcbe2d9b2) which quickly became her special interest (I linked images of all the ones I imagine she has in the hyperlinks <3 some of them aren't quite appropriate when it comes to what they're collaborating with but I imagine Seiji wouldn't be too in-touch with pop culture outside of detective novels), though she also enjoys Baby Alive dolls and Doc McStuffins toys. One of Hanako's favorite parts of each day is when Taro (or Seiji, she's not very picky) reads her a bedtime story- 小さな星の光, or Little Starlight, the only book Aina ever got to write and publish before she passed, a book she was inspired to write after seeing Seiji's reactions to both of his babies when they were born. Taro's noticed the babying, but he doesn't really blame his dad since he knows about the guilt they both feel regarding Aina's death, even if his father won't admit it. All of this is why Hanako acts a lot younger than her age, whereas most middle-schoolers would act ""too old"" for dolls and complain about their siblings being annoying and their parents being embarrassing, Hanako still plays dolls with Asumi (who just likes playing dolls), is attached to her brother at the hip, and is deathly afraid of losing her father too. Hanako's actually had some behavioral problems related to her mom's death- one notable incident being when she bit a classmate during a fight that started after Hanako got upset at the girl for complaining that her mom was overbearing and not letting her go to a sleepover, along with other incidents of lashing out at classmates for similar reasons.

**Taro Yamada**

[Taro Yamada, aka Senpai. Ayano doesn't actually care about Taro's real name in my rewrite since she's obsessed with what \\""Senpai\\"" represents, and not the person he actually is. As far as she's concerned, Taro Yamada and Senpai are two entirely different beings.](https://preview.redd.it/hv5bwpjl3aef1.png?width=268&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5bc3b98711b8eda2a761d39075d310834d37f61)

My version of Taro, while I tried to stay at least a *little* bit true to the canon just because I personally don't like rewrites that just make him a completely different person, so this section will talk about changes I've made to both his story, appearance, interests, and personality.

So as mentioned above, my version of Taro is autistic and a bit of an anxious wreck (he's just really good at hiding it since he was already used to masking for his autism) after being the one to find his mom's body- it's easily his most traumatic memory to date, as it left him mute for months following her death from the shock and horror of it all because, keep in mind, he was only ***11*** when that happened. While I could just *tell* you what got him to start talking again, I think it'd be better to write the scene out for you:

*Taro is sitting on a rock by his middle school's playground, reading a book on dragonflies Hanako got him for his birthday with the help of Seiji. A scraggly boy with brown hair and green eyes notices how lonely he looks and runs over, perching on the rock beside him.*

*???: Whatcha readin'?*

*Taro: ...*

*???: \*looks at the cover\* Dragonflies? I mean, of course it does! It's gotta have wings for a reason, otherwise it'd just be a lizard!*

*Taro: ...*

*Taro: \*he begins laughing for the first time in months, and the other boy smiles\**

*???: I'm Toga Tobara! What's your name?*

*Taro: I...I'm Taro. Taro Yamada.*

*Toga: Cool! Wanna be friends?*

*Taro: S-Sure!*

...and that's how I imagine Toga and Taro became friends- Toga has a talent for comedy in my rewrite, which is why none of the clubs at Akademi really fit him (the closest he ever got was Drama Club, but they pretty much exclusively perform tragedies and melodramas), so I imagine that if he saw a classmate looking upset or lonely, he would go up to them and tell a cheesy joke to get them to cheer up. As for how Taro met Budo (quick context: Budo's trans in my rewrite, but he didn't fully transition until the summer he graduated middle school with Taro):

*Taro is sitting alone at recess- Toga was home sick, and Osana was inside playing with her other friends in the school's playroom. It's peaceful until* [*a girl with green hair*](https://yandere-simulator.fandom.com/wiki/Hoshiko_Mizudori) *and* [*another girl with black hair*](https://yandere-simulator.fandom.com/wiki/Musume_Ronshaku) *come up to him.*

*Bully A: \*snatches Taro's book and holds it above her head\**

*Taro: H-Hey! Give it back! T-That's not funny! \*he already begins tearing up, having already been overstimulated before the bullies approached him\**

*Bully B: Aw, look at the little crybaby! He can't even handle someone borrowing his book!*

*Taro: Y-You're not borrowing it, you're stealing it! Stop! I'm being serious, give it back!*

*Bully A: Aw, boohoo! It'd sure be a shame if you made me ""accidentally"" drop it\~*

*Taro: Please, just give it back! \*he's on the verge of having a meltdown\**

*???: Oi! Leave him alone!*

*A girl with black hair and eyes approaches the group, having heard Taro's cries from across the playground.*

*Bully A: Ugh, great, little goody-two-shoes Masuyama's here to ruin the fun!*

*Bully B: \*blows a raspberry at Budo\* Mind your own business, dweeb! We're just messing around!*

*???:* ***You*** *might be having fun, but he's not! Give him his book back!*

*Bully A: Or what, loser? Gonna go cry to your teacher?*

*Bully B: Yeah, loser, gonna go cry-*

*The girl immediately shoves Bullies A & B, knocking Taro's book out of Bully A's hands and catching it before it hits the ground and handing it back to Taro.*

*???: Sorry about those two- I think they're just mean for the sake of it!*

*Taro: \*still sniffling and processing what just happened\* ...w-who are you...?*

*???: \*perks up\* Oh, I'm* ***\[DEADNAME\]*** *Masuyama! But I think I wanna start going by Budo! \*playfully karate kicks the air\* I'm pretty good at martial arts, so I can keep you safe from those two!*

*Taro: \*calming down\* I...I'm Taro Yamada. A-And I'd like that, thanks...*

As for how he met Osana, I actually don't think anything really special happened outside of the Yamada's being invited to a neighbor's party or something like that and Osana seeing Taro and just kind of taking him under her wing a la ""you are being rescued please do not resist"" only she actually did protect him from bullies (most of the time at least).

For his hobbies, aside from him being an avid reader & dragonfly researcher, I like to imagine that Taro enjoys thrifting and actually bonds with Amai, Oka, and Osoro over that outside of school and ends up teaching Megami about it (since I imagine she wouldn't have much experience with secondhand shopping due to her family always buying their clothes brand new). I also decided to make him still enjoy classical music as I like to imagine it's something he used to listen to with his mom, but outside of that he usually just ends up listening to whatever is on the radio as well as video game OSTs. I headcanon him as really enjoying vintage stuff (hence his tendency to go thrifting), so I like to imagine that he has a part-time job at an antique mall in Buraza Town on the weekends.

For Taro's physical appearance, I personally imagine that he'd be a bit chunky (kinda like the body type of the girl in the middle in [this art](https://i.pinimg.com/1200x/d5/9e/3a/d59e3ab3e91e9a339650933f1400e17e.jpg) I found on Pinterest) because I don't imagine him to be the kind to go on morning jogs, do pushups every day, etc., but I don't think he's an unhealthy slob like [someone who shall not be named](https://yandere-simulator.fandom.com/wiki/Sutemi_Okada) and takes walks to stay healthy. Outside of that, he looks pretty much the same as he does in canon, if a bit taller and with *slightly* longer hair (long enough to completely cover his ears at least). As for how he dresses, that's also pretty much the same in my rewrite as it is in canon, the only difference being that he wears a lot of old/vintage clothes and dragonfly brooches (he collects them), and he almost always has noise-cancelling headphones on (he wears them around his neck when he's not using them, but that's pretty rare since I hc him as being really sensitive to loud or sudden noises). Also, I would personally give him some tiny freckles because why not. Another style-related hc I have for him is that he used an old 80's Akademi bookbag he found at a neighborhood flea market event  he went to with his mom (basically think like a neighborhood-wide garage sale), and he covers up a small scuffed patch on it with a dragonfly brooch Aina gave to him for his birthday before she passed (it's why he collects them).

Another small headcanon I have is that he found an old typewriter at a different flea market event and managed to scrounge together the parts to get it working again with some help from Kaga.

For something lighthearted before we get back into the traumatic stuff, here's a list of all his safe foods!:

\- Shrimp Chips/Prawn Crackers (Especially [this flavor](https://images.albertsons-media.com/is/image/ABS/970010966-ECOM?$ng-ecom-pdp-mobile$&defaultImage=Not_Available), but any as long as they aren't wasabi flavored- he's really sensitive to spicy food so he avoids it as much as possible with very few exceptions)

\- Baked Wheat Cakes (specifically D-Plus wheat cakes since he's 100% sure he likes them- his favorite flavors are the [red bean paste](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Rn7T8yMxL._UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg) and [green tea](https://www.sweetsandgeeks.com/cdn/shop/products/D-PlusBakedWheatCake-GreenTeaFlavor2.82oz_80g__front_540x_15d318b7-82e3-4ff9-86af-1048c5ef5073.jpg?v=1682355138) varieties, the only flavor he *won't* eat is the [coffee one](https://www.sweetsandgeeks.com/cdn/shop/products/D-PlusBakedWheatCake-CoffeeFlavor2.82oz_80g__front_540x_e7499c9d-6093-44a8-a2ba-4abd03a157c9.jpg?v=1682354911) since he doesn't like the taste of coffee unless it's loaded with cream and sugar, although he does like the smell of coffee and buys coffee-scented candles)

\- [Tokyo Bananas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Banana) (His grandparents bring him and Hanako them when they come visit from Tokyo, so he's rather nostalgic for them- but he also really enjoys bananas and banana-flavored snacks and sweets. These are one of Hanako's safe foods too only she likes the [sakura](https://www.tokyobanana.jp/language/images/products/71_sakura_banana_03_8pcs.jpg) and [lemon](https://www.tokyobanana.jp/language/images/products/62_piyolemon_banana_03_8pcs.jpg) flavors & the [strawberry cake](https://www.tokyobanana.jp/language/images/products/42_strawberry_cake_03_8pcs.jpg) made by the same company while Taro only likes the [classic flavor](https://www.tokyobanana.jp/language/images/products/68_sticker_banana_02_8pcs.jpg) but *will* accept the [honey flavor](https://www.tokyobanana.jp/language/images/product_2_kumassu12_04.jpg) if the classic isn't available for whatever reason. They both love collecting the boxes the cakes come in because the art is really neat- Taro actually uses the [Doraemon collab box](https://www.tokyobanana.jp/language/images/products/66_doraemon_banana_04_12pcs.jpg) to hold random trinkets he finds while thrifting while Hanako uses the [Pokémon box](https://www.tokyobanana.jp/language/images/products/73_pikachu_banana_04_12pcs.jpg) to hold loose doll clothes & accessories; she doesn't really care too much about Pokémon, but she thinks Pikachu is cute and loves the box's color and that's all that really matters to her)

\- Vanilla Ice Cream (Specifically soft serve, and no this isn't meant to be another ""Taro boring joke"" I just genuinely think he'd like vanilla as a flavor 😭 I actually think he'd really hate the taste of chocolate to the point it makes him gag and even throw up)

\- Bottled Coffee & Matcha Lattes (Literally the *only* way you can get him to drink any amount of coffee *or* matcha, since with matcha he really only likes the flavor in pastries)

\- Konpeitō (He yearns for the ~~mines~~ crunch)

\- Kare Pan (He actually likes curry- the Japanese kind at least- overall, especially his dad's homemade curry, but he enjoys how crispy the outer dough of Kare Pan is)

\- Coffee Cake (Especially the cinnamon coffee cake from the Odayaka Bakery- he was eating their coffee cake even before meeting Amai)

\- Dango (One of the only traditional Japanese foods he'll eat, since a lot of traditional Japanese sweets/foods have elements that trigger his sensory issues. His favorite kind of dango is Mitarashi Dango)

Alright, now back to your regularly scheduled trauma.

Throughout my rewrite's hypothetical gameplay, Taro's secretly falling apart with anxiety about his dad's supposed ""business trip,"" especially considering how on edge his dad sounds whenever he calls to check in on him and Hanako and how uncertain he sounds when either of them ask when he's coming home. If Osana or Hanako were to die before Seiji comes home, Taro would likely suffer a severe meltdown and be hospitalized. And if *Seiji* were to die at all, that would send Taro into a meltdown regardless of if anyone else close to him died or not, since he still has that fear of losing him after finding his mom's body.

Hypothetically speaking, if Ayano were to help her mom hunt down and kill Seiji by eavesdropping on Taro's phone calls with him to learn his whereabouts and Taro found out...lets just say Ayano won't be the one SNAPPING at the end of the week.

**Hanako Yamada**

[Hanako Yamada. She's in middle school in my rewrite, but I'm just using her old Akademi portrait because I don't feel like making an edit rn 😭\)](https://preview.redd.it/e7ozlfbr5aef1.png?width=225&format=png&auto=webp&s=68d2beeb4732f0423b2104d23e412e3d959aa6fa)

Like Taro, Hanako is also autistic in my rewrite, she's just higher functioning than Taro. Like Taro's dragonfly hyperfixation, Hanako's hyperfixation is on Polly Pocket. **Just a quick disclaimer: Hanako isn't childish** ***because*** **she's autistic. She's an autistic person that just** ***happens*** **to act childish and have what are typically childish interests. I actually based some of her and Taro's symptoms/experiences off of myself since I'm on the spectrum.**

Hanako doesn't have many friends since a lot of her classmates see her as being too childish or girly, especially since a lot of her classmates are going through their ""I'm too old for toys"" phase. Her only friend is Asumi Kurudo, Midori Gurin's younger adoptive sister- Hanako actually learned JSL (Japanese Sign Language) to communicate with her since they met before Asumi got her cochlear implants, and they still communicate through JSL if either of them are non-verbal due to emotional shutdowns or other reasons (I also like to think Hanako might consider a career as a sign language interpreter in the future because of this). She's relatively friendly, but she's also really shy because she's always being picked on by her classmates, which is why she's so clingy with Taro (aside from her crippling fear of losing him like their mom) since she knows he'll always protect her- Osana is also quite protective of Hanako since she reminds her of how Taro was in middle school.",1,1753128462.0,RyobaAishi,0,1.0,False

By TT

The political landscape of 2157 has erupted into chaos once again, as the Turkish-dominated alliance RES openly calls for civil war to oust rival alliance 333—a move likened to ""a serpent coiling around its prey before the final squeeze."" deception, and ethnic factionalism tearing at the seams of the virtual state.

A Tangled Web of Alliances and Betrayal

RES, now a formidable force, was once a minor player reliant on the might of 333’s ""whale""—a top-tier player whose dominance helped RES clinch victory in the first SvS (State vs. State) battle. Yet, like ""a dagger cloaked in diplomacy,"" RES later sought to undermine 333, with its leader allegedly offering to sabotage Sun City battles for alliance #2137 in exchange for prolonged occupation rights—a deal sweetened with the promise of a Consulship seat.

Though the rebellion was aborted, RES’s hunger for power never waned.

""Turks—it’s always the Turks,"" laments Saya of 2157, encapsulating a growing sentiment. The pattern repeats: 2150’s BlackJackK team, 2157’s RES, and 2137’s WAR have all left trails of discord, their reputations stained by ruthless politicking.

The Puppeteer and the Fall of KNG

At the heart of 2137’s unraveling is ciHan06, a manipulative schemer accused of psychological warfare. Promised the next presidency by a former leader, he erupted in fury when a state transfer disrupted his plans, bombarding allies with hourly demands and gaslighting tactics. ""He wielded guilt like a weapon,"" says one insider. ""Every message was a blade twisting deeper.""
His endgame? To flood KNG with Turkish players, ousting longtime members. When Coffee, a senior officer, discovered kicked members were never consulted, the lie unraveled—yet ciHan06’s loyalty remained solely to his agenda.His endgame?
The BlackJackK Debacle: A Cycle of Sabotage

The arrival of BlackJackK’s team became KNG’s death spiral. Despite concessions, they quit three times, abandoned R4 roles four times, and even tried poaching members mid-crisis. Their excuses ranged from petty grievances (a misplaced ""Greg"" in a Bear Rally) to outright power grabs (demanding R5 without votes).
Meanwhile, WAR—another Turkish faction—resorted to strong-arming a high school student into signing away presidency rights, exploiting his naivety. Their rebellion against KNG, backed by zero contributions (Martina attended zero battles; Aslan vanished mid-SvS), laid bare their hypocrisy.
SHW: The Phoenix Rising

Amid the chaos, Shadows (SHW) emerged as the state’s unlikely saviors. Despite lacking a whale and enduring smear campaigns, their unity forged victory. ""SHW doesn’t need to notice you,"" declares an insider. ""Their strength isn’t bought—it’s earned."" Now, elite states court them with lucrative transfer offers, a testament to their resilience.

Epilogue: A State at the Crossroads

As Mr. Tofu of SHW aptly warns: ""Let time make everything clear."" But time may run out for 2137’s schemers. With SHW ascendant and trust eroding, the choice is stark: stand with the victors—or be crushed beneath the wheels of their rise.

——Tequila Tramonto-----------------------------------------Detailed Version-----------------
2157 RES, another Turkish alliance, has called for a civil war to squeeze out Alliance 333 and take full control of the state. 333 was known to have the most powerful ""whale,"" who helped 2157 win the first SvS and caused major problems for us in the second SvS. RES just reminded me that their leader contacted ciHan06 during the second SvS. He offered to act as a mole, sabotaging the SFC battle to help 2137 secure victory.

In return, they demanded that 2137 allow them to hold the longest occupation time in Sun City during the battle, which would help them secure the presidency seat in 2157. This rebellion was eventually canceled by RES's leader. It’s clear how obsessed RES is with power—they weren’t as strong back then and couldn’t defeat 333 at the time. But eventually, they gained the strength and means to achieve their goals.
I don’t want to generalize about races—there are surely good Turks. But the actions of 2150’s Turks (the Blackjackk team), 2157’s Turks (RES), and 2137’s Turks (WAR) haven’t left a positive impression on anyone. I won’t comment on 2166 DXC since I don’t know them well. As a quote from 2157’s Saya puts it: ""Turks—it’s always the Turks.""
Speaking of Saya, he became a turning point as 2137 descended into chaos. I had promised him the next presidency, but the first state transfer occurred during his term. ciHan06 was furious and vehemently opposed my decision. He bombarded my DMs hourly, harassing and guilt-tripping me. He psychologically manipulated me, accusing me of making the wrong choices and trying to steer everything in his favor.
Playing the game felt exhausting—if I didn’t reply, he’d label me a traitor or liar, teaming up with Anubis to attack me in the R4 group chat. He never acknowledged how out of line he was, preaching about ""what’s best for KNG"" while systematically replacing its original members with his Turkish allies.
Eventually, I stepped down as R5. Managing the state wasn’t the issue—it was the toxic alliance environment and DM drama. (Though, admittedly, negotiating with Q made me nervous—but that’s diplomacy. This? This was just misery.)
ciHan06’s desperation to secure KNG’s presidency stemmed from his promise to bring the Blackjackk team over during the first state transfer. He’d erupt emotionally whenever I disagreed. After handing control back to Kingkong, I took a long break, hoping to escape the chaos. But Q seized the opportunity to pressure KNG further, claiming I’d ""dishonored"" the rotation.
Before Blackjackk’s team arrived, ciHan06 purged non-Turks from KNG to make space. Coffee was devastated seeing longtime members kicked out. When she confronted ciHan06, he lied, claiming he’d ""cleared it"" with those removed. But when Coffee DMed them, they denied ever agreeing.
Once Blackjackk’s team joined, the complaints never stopped. I accommodated their demands, adjusting events to suit them—yet they quit KNG THREE times and abandoned their R4 roles FOUR times. When I practically begged Blackjackk to explain what would make his team stay, he ignored me—only to instantly greet Mr. Tofu when he came online. Blackjackk dodged every question, even asking Tofu if he’d leave KNG to join him. Pathetic.
Their excuses? Quitting because their squad couldn’t enter HQ during Crazy Joe. Quitting over a Greg in their bear rally. Quitting because no one voted Blackjackk for R5. Refusing to lead their UTC 19:00 legion (ciHan06’s justification for giving him a commander role?).
Recently, WAR tried stealing the presidency rotation. The original order was POL → WLF → SHW, but after POL left, WAR took their slot. Before SHW’s turn, WAR dragged SHW’s R4/R5 into NAP chats (after SHW had left NAP) and manipulated a high schooler into signing a solo ""agreement"" handing the presidency to WAR. Shadows and Tofu never consented—ciHan06 forced the ""diplomacy,"" then cried about it on live stream.
WAR then incited rebellion in KNG for not getting power fast enough. Martina even messaged Dark Legend, demanding votes for Blackjackk as president—despite his zero contributions beyond quitting three times. The audacity.
Speaking of ""contributions"": Aslan joined one foundry battle and two bears in a month. Blackjackk did 5–7 bears; Martina did none, just nonstop complaining. They’re a dysfunctional WoS family—Aslan the rage-filled dad, Martina the screeching mom, ciHan06 their loyal lapdog.
In their first SvS, Aslan took a turret and vanished. Second SvS? WAR showed up but refused to counter-rally for the castle. Q was too busy with 2112; Aslan just attacked SHW-held turrets (conveniently ""online"" for SFC, huh?). Their third SvS? They reignited civil war by hitting SHW cities during cross-state SFC. No honor—just a hunger for power. If they crushed SHW, they’d never share power with WLF.
Meanwhile, SHW achieved the impossible—a united victory without one of their whales. Their story inspired Chinese-speaking players worldwide. Shadows and Tofu received transfer offers from top states (2150, 2060), with full refunds and troop training. No matter how 2137’s politicians slander them, SHW stands tall. They don’t need to prove anything—their strength comes from unity, not bought accounts or transfers. SHW is rising, and you can’t stop it. Ally with them or leave 2137.",1,1753128405.0,u_PutCapital4201,0,1.0,False
1m5tg55,https://www.reddit.com/r/MelissaRovellibooks/comments/1m5tg55/dividing_dark_more_samples/,"Dividing Dark, more samples","Up on the right, a brown sign read Cathedral Caverns. No more detours. She dutifully followed it, enjoying momentary flatness. A little music eased the tension before the ghastly task of climbing the semi-steep incline.

“I can do this,” she said aloud. “Don’t look at the drop-offs.”

Keeping her eyes glued straight ahead, she breathed slowly. Almost there, she coached herself. Cathedral Caverns was up ahead. She turned onto Cave Road. So close! Panic gnawed on her like Jill’s snickering, urging her to turn around like a coward. Somehow, she kept going. It hadn’t been as bad as she had been expecting.

After she parked, she unclamped her fingers from the steering wheel and shook them out. To get blood pumping into her legs and to get her bearings, Fee stepped out of the car. The lay of the land seemed level enough. Something strange came over her. A sense of peace surprised her. Maybe the higher elevation merely deprived her brain of oxygen, she decided. Whatever the reason, she used the moment to silence the inner dialogue trying to talk her out of this.

Well, it is kind of beautiful. Sunlight streaming through tree tops soothed her worry. Its comforting heat stroked her skin. She soaked up as many rays as she could before facing the cold, damp nightmare.

The one-story visitor’s center had stone steps and walkways. It seemed anchored to the earth and sturdy enough. She milled about like the others. The open and airy floor plan made it easier to continue forward. She climbed the steps in her Wal-Mart hiking boots, passing tourists peacefully resting on benches and enjoying terrifying views of deep spaces plummeting through trees to who knows where? Lovely.

Then, she saw him. Collecting money for tickets behind the counter up on the right, a brownish blond-haired boy chatted with mismatched tourists, who loudly gushed about their love of caves and all the ones they had visited. The boy didn’t seem to mind. He patiently answered questions about the history of the cave’s owners and the world records the cave held. Probably of interest to some, she supposed.

Curious, Fee crept closer. While awaiting her turn, she sneaked another peek at the good-looking boy in the light blue shirt. He had such pale skin, as if he spent too much time down below.

Such odd eyes, though, she mused. Beautiful, gray, and forceful. A strange recognition haunted her, though they had never met. This intrigued her.

As he put a $20 bill into the drawer, he hesitated as if startled. His chin lifted and his attention froze on her, as if she had been more unendurable than the tourists. What did she do wrong? She sucked in a concerned breath, anxiously awaiting his assessment...outsider? He seemed to curiously tilt his head as their eyes  locked. A wave of energy passed through them as if they were connected somehow—an unsettling intimacy among strangers.

Her heart fluttered when his attention settled on her chest, where her charm rested. Fee immediately focused on her ugly, brown boots. That appeared to snap him out of it. She heard him resume conversation with the couple. She thought he had a pleasant voice, one that some girl might like to hear while lying under the stars. Friendly and confident, he seemed tough enough to handle the rugged terrain, yet with a tenderness for life.

She stole another peek. His deep-set eyes held a sparkle. Outdoorsy and casual, he completed the transaction, as if at home In his natural element, born and bred in these mountains. He was about her age, though taller and lean, but muscular. He obviously kept fit caving. There was something else about him. Sure, his handsome, symmetrical face could melt any girl’s heart, and those lips weren’t too thin—perfect to sink your teeth into. Darn those hormones! Before she could gawk any further, the middle-aged couple in their Hawaiian shirts moved aside to snap more pictures to document their day.

Her turn came. Taking a deep breath, in and out, she stepped up. The wooden counter served as a blockade.

“One ticket, please.”

“For what?”

As if the floor gave way, she felt herself spinning. Her brain wrestled to comprehend what he had asked.

“For the next tour.”

“What tour?”

Her heart skipped a beat. She turned to each side. Was she on one of those prank TV shows? He smirked, probably guessing her paranoia. She grew angry. Why had she found him so appealing?

“To tour the cave.” She enunciated each syllable in case he had trouble with her different accent.

“We don’t have a cave.”

Was she caught in a nightmare? He was calmly inferring she was crazy or something. Confusion set in. Her throat constricted and her palms began to sweat. She would have run away, but she couldn’t move. Then, he laughed in a soft, musical way, knocking her back from her panic attack.

“I’m teasing. That will be $10.”

Fee felt the blood rise, turning her cheeks and the tips of her ears beet red.

 “Oh.”

“Are you with a group?”

Flustered, Fee met his gaze, begging him not to torture her anymore.

“No, do I need to be?” She was cautious now, in case he was enjoying the abuse of her ignorance.

“No,” he shrugged. “I was just wondering if you were...alone. If you wait by the entrance, I’m starting a tour in five minutes.”

His annoyed expression declared that she had no sense of humor as he took her money and handed her back a ticket. Her trembling fingers snatched it away. He had the nerve to grin roguishly.

Disconcerted, Fee disappeared into the restroom across from the counter. Once there, she tried to regain her composure through colliding emotions. If they were atoms, a nuclear explosion would have combusted her. At least in this small room, she had peace. Solitude refreshed her, though the mirror did not, as if always pointing out her flaws. To make matters worse, that boy made her self-conscious. She put her hair up into a pony tail, wondering what made him single her out to be cruel toward. He was nice enough to the couple. Maybe her forehead had “gullible” stamped on it. She felt so stupid for falling for his trickery. Would he pick on her for the entire tour? Just in case, she hung out there for a few more minutes, hoping she could wait for the next tour.

Once composed, she returned to the open space in front of the visitor’s center. He must have left. A middle-aged woman now collected money from a newly formed line. Having no choice, Fee went down the steps to meet her nemesis. The cave’s gaping mouth hungrily awaited her descent. She paused next to a short woman pushing a stroller. On her other side, a couple stood arm in arm, and a family of four waited. Two boisterous youngsters ran in circles, a boy and a girl, both in bright red sneakers. They looked like twins, shoving each other while their frazzled Mom reminded them to behave.

“I was getting ready to send a search party.”

Fee spun around. A smirking boy, hands in his pockets, returned to harass her. He stood close, too close. His eyes locked onto hers, unblinking...like a predator. How much more could she take? He was much taller in this proximity, and much cuter.

Her brain floundered.

“Why?”

“We all thought you fell in.”

Everyone laughed. Her cheeks burned again. She was right. She was in hell.

I’m just going to ignore him. I won’t be bullied.

Laughing to himself, the boy walked in front of the group and stood, blocking the path to the cave as if he owned it.

“Time for the rules.”

The children made faces and grunted.

“‘Take nothing but pictures. Leave nothing but footprints. Kill nothing...but time.’ That is the cave’s motto,” he began in his pleasant voice. “No running, no climbing on railings. No touching the cave walls. No collecting souvenirs. Got it?”

He directed the last part to the children, who all put on angel faces.

“If anyone needs to leave or feels that they can’t go on any further, let me know immediately, and I’ll get you out.”

Everyone nodded. Fee especially liked that last part. At least she wasn’t the only one who might need such a service. He stepped closer to her and lowered his voice.

“You look nervous. Don’t be.”

Now he was being considerate? Fee turned her head, still angry.

“Maybe you should stick close to me,” he added.

“Why? So you can push me into a crevasse as a sacrifice to the cave god?” Fee snapped, tired of him picking on her.

His eyes widened as if horrified. His lips parted to speak, but he pursed them and simply turned away. The thirtyish woman with the infant raised an eyebrow. The indifferent couple made eyes at each other, and the tired-looking parents were busy trying to control their spawn. Fee nervously bit her nails, wondering why she had gone alone.

“Let’s begin,” the guide said, motioning the group to follow.

His mood seemed upbeat despite his aggravation with her.

So far so good. Lights were strung along the walls. A paved walkway meant a smooth, easy footing. Even in the entrance, 128 feet wide by 25 feet high, as noted by the guide, the cave was a cool 60 degrees year round. Fee followed the others, preferring to hide from the tour guide.

“The bridge up ahead is 10 feet above the old trail.”

Bridge?

“And if you look to your left, you will see a narrow, 18 inch ledge at its widest, used by explorers in the past to enter before the bridge was built. They had to hold on to the cave wall as they moved so they wouldn’t fall to the depths below. Originally, that was the only way in. How many of you would be brave enough to have tried it?”

Fee darted her attention away. That was suicidal. She would stick to the bridge, though it was not much of an improvement in her opinion.

“If you look here,” he said loud enough for everyone to hear, shining a flashlight on the ceiling high above, “you will see a shark tooth. Alabama was once covered by the ocean. Here is some proof.”

“A shark tooth!” one of the children squealed, pointing up.

Everyone oohed and ahhed.

Maybe an inch and a half or so in length, the white object stood out against the brown background. This illogical finding got her attention. Clearly out of place, it baffled her mind. She imagined sharks circling overhead. What other secrets did the walls conceal? Her heart opened a millimeter toward this place.

After all, her beloved ocean had been here, millions of years ago. That tooth was left as evidence. She started to lose her apprehension, but occasionally she would slow down and start to freeze when the terrain roughened. She focused on the ceiling, anything, just so she didn’t let him see she was afraid.

“Now, up ahead, can you hear the rushing water? The Mystery River runs below,” he said. “You will see it soon, if you look over the railing.”

Water? Railing? That wasn’t part of the bargain. Fee gasped when she saw the current flowing below them. He turned to stare, maybe wondering why a cave hater would come.

“It’s just that it’s so beautiful,” she lied, her voice shaking.

They ignored her and moved on. The adept guide led them through a forest of gnarled stalagmites and stalactites: some like spooky fingers motioning for her to move closer or like teeth on the floor and ceiling, waiting to gobble her up. She stared in awe, as if trespassing on some foreign planet. Each room had a wonder to behold, like Big Rock Canyon. One room contained a towering 60 foot tall giant stalagmite named Goliath. Fee still clung to the railing at some points, getting dizzy, and forcing her feet up steep inclines. But standing pools of clear water fascinated her, urging her to discover more. She preferred the enclosed pools on the higher path to the free flowing water far below. She never imagined the minute details to take in. She figured all caves were just dark and slimy walls, not intricately carved and mesmerizing.

Up ahead, the frozen waterfall shimmered in the flashlight’s glow. Even with track lights on the walls, it was hard to appreciate the full beauty without extra light revealing the glistening water, as if caught in a different timeline. The guide enthusiastically pointed out every facet with pleasure. He loved this cave, and she began to see why. Not in a million years did she ever think she would behold anything so beautiful.

“This cave is alive. Each drop of water over time deposits minerals, but it can be killed in a single second by the touch of a human hand.”

He looked at her when he said that, almost like an accusation.

Until that moment, he had avoided her.

“I will give you all a moment to take pictures before we proceed.”

As if enjoying singling her out, he went to where she was lingering in the back, pretending to admire a stalagmite. She tensed, hoping he didn’t catch her displeasure in the dim light. She bowed her head, desperate to conceal too many emotions.

“So, you like caves?” He sounded hopeful.

What? No wisecracks?

“Yes, I’m interested in geology...especially the rock formations.”

She lied, though it suddenly did sound appealing.

“Really?” He stepped closer, smiling.

She waited for a trick. There was none. He seemed to be waiting for her to say more. She tried to formulate a sentence under the pressure.

“I might become a geologist one day,” she continued, suddenly liking his attention until his gaze lowered.

“I was noticing your necklace.”

“My Dad gave it to me. He bought it in Africa.”

“It is the same symbol found in many caves—a petroglyph.”

“It means something?”

That had never occurred to her. It had always been just a design to make it prettier.

“May I?” he asked, reaching to pick up the charm surrounded by blue and black beads.

She nodded, keeping perfectly still, reigning in any reaction to him.

“The spiral is one of the oldest symbols, one of life. It unifies vision and thought, and it carries with it the sacred geometry found in light and the cosmos.”

He admired it with reverence, gently holding it between two fingers. With reluctance, he released it.

 “You seem to know a lot.”

“I’m no geologist. Maybe you should be giving the tour. I’m sure you know more than me. I’m just here through the summer.”

“No, you’re doing fine.”

“I’m glad you think so.”

He stepped backwards with a pleased smile on his face before the rambunctious kids took it away. They bopped around as if unaware of the danger. The young boy daringly swung on the railing while the girl twirled in circles.

“No climbing, kids,” he firmly said, before instructing them all to move along.

Fee diverted her attention from the cavern to the more interesting aspect, that annoyingly charming boy. Next to him, Niko Sari seemed like an immature kid. Not that she had a chance with either.

“There is one room I would love to show you all. Its beauty would amaze you,” he said, like a circus ring leader. “On the other side of that small hole in the ground—which you have to crawl through—is The Crystal Room. It is pure white calcite, and it would take your breath away.”

“Can we see it?” the little girl asked, not tired like several of the grown-ups—including the one holding her back.

“It sounds beautiful,” her long-haired mother said, seemingly enchanted by the whole experience.

Fee was one of the others, a non-taker for the invitation. That hole below, on the other side of the railing, looked like a narrow squeeze and devoid of light. Crawl in there? Fee gulped. Not if her life depended on it.

“The crystals are so delicate that the sound of a human voice could shatter them,” the guide explained. “Unfortunately, the tour for that is a four-hour commitment. Once you enter, you cannot turn around...for any reason.”

The others shook their heads, murmuring, “No, thanks.”

“How about you?”

He meant Fee. She shrugged, waiting for the humiliation. A supposed future geologist would have jumped at the chance, not afraid of the very rocks she feigned to be interested in. She closed her eyes, waiting for the shame.

He moved closer, ever attentive.

“Hey, are you all right? It’s dark, but I can still see that you are as white as a ghost.”

“I’m fine, just a little dizzy. I didn’t eat much today.” That wasn’t a lie.

His strong hand gripped her elbow. “I’ll get you out of here.”

“No, no, I’m fine. I can leave with the rest of the group.”

He seemed suspicious, but the kids started climbing on the railing again—a potential disaster. Their parents weren’t even watching. They busily snapped pictures of the foreboding hole below. Faron sneaked over, and she heard him say, “You are making the green monster under the bridge very angry.”

“Really?”

“I just saw its long tail in the water. Keep an eye out.”

The kids wasted no time sticking close to their parents, who seemed to wonder what had spooked them, as they weren’t the clingy type.

Fee giggled, though she used that moment to move away as well. But thankfully they were at the end. Where could she go?

The tour was over. He informed everyone to take a few minutes to get the last of their pictures before heading back. Another tour would be coming through shortly. It was over, and she had survived. A sense of triumph immersed her.

Fee decided to get a head start. Her gait changed. She realized she was limping.

“Yeah, you’re perfectly fine.”

“New shoes,” she told him, an ache now apparent in her toes.

Fee sat down, needing a moment to rest. She chose a spot near the railing where large rocks supported the bridge, needing to know the ground wasn’t far underneath. He squatted down in front of her. He wore hiking boots, too.

“What’s your name?”

“Fee.”

“Well, Fee, it’s a long way back. I can get a golf cart, or I can carry you, if you prefer. Walking down the slopes is a lot harder than going up them.”

Thoughts of those strong arms around her caused her to catch her breath again.

“No, I’m fine,” she protested.

He stood up, held out his hand, and said, “Let me be the judge of that.”

His hand was warm, yet a shiver went through her. If she were unsteady on her feet, it would certainly be his fault.

“I’m Faron Rothschild, by the way.”

“Fee Birch,”

“You should come back for another tour. In the fall, the bats return. You should really see that. You aren’t afraid of bats, are you?”

“No, bats are fine.”

It’s everything else.

He hadn’t exaggerated. Going down took balance and concentration. As they made their way out of the stalagmite garden, another guided tour was approaching. At least twenty people waited to squeeze by like a herd of impatient animals. Fee felt claustrophobic. A panic attack loomed under the surface.

“Everyone, move against the railing, so they can pass,” Faron instructed, pointing to a part of the bridge where the earth below seemed to drop away.

Fee eyed the metal pole with horror. Water churned below at this point. She didn’t want to be that close to the railing. She had walked dead center in the scary places. Ever concerned, Faron watched her inching toward the edge, nervously calculating the distance to the bottom. Large men pushed past her. She forced herself to move closer to the barrier as the rest of the group brushed by her, with one rude woman roughly bumping into her.

Fee lost her balance and started falling forward, her hands frantically grasping to catch hold as her upper body teetered over the railing, providing a view she had no interest in seeing. Just then, an arm encircled her waist, anchoring her tightly against him.

“I’ve got you,” he gently told her, keeping her firmly in his hold. “How about heights? Not so good, huh?”

“Go ahead and laugh. A future geologist afraid of heights. I bet you want me to come back in the fall, because I’m good for your comedy routine.”

His face was close to hers, only she had to look up to see it. His expression surprised her. It matched hers, a painful longing she didn’t know how to explain.

“I want you to come back, because you interest me.”

Totally unexpected.

He moved her away from the railing before letting her go and started walking, probably wanting to herd everyone out. She quickly followed. The other tour group had left them, wrongly assuming they needed to be alone. They passed through two more rooms before he spoke again.

“You will come back, won’t you?”

“Umm, well, tomorrow I’m going spelunking with friends.”

He did a double take. It must have sounded ludicrous. She knew she better be honest. She explained.

 “I came here today hoping to get rid of my fear before tomorrow. I wanted to see if I could do it without making a fool of myself.”

“You did fine.”

“I might be on the bottom right now if you hadn’t steadied me.” That wasn’t a pleasant thought.

“Which cave are you going to? It might be one you aren’t ready for. I can give you lessons.”

“I don’t know where it is.”

“There are thousands of caves, not all of them safe like this one. Tell me you won’t go, not until I can show you how to be safe,” he said, genuinely concerned. “Even if you completely dislike me, I hope you still let me help you avoid an accident. I’m on the cave rescue team, and I’d rather not have to rescue you. I mean, I would prefer you wouldn’t get into that predicament in the first place.”

Fee thought for a moment, but not long enough, because she said, “You could come, too. We’re meeting at the Five Points coffee shop at two.”

We. Did he cringe at that word?

“Won’t your friends mind?”

“They would probably be excited to be around someone who actually knows caves.”

“I do know quite a few.”

“So, you will?”

His eyes roved across her necklace before he answered.

“Sure. I’ll come by, just to make sure you know what you are doing.”

“Is there really a lot of danger?”

His face turned grave. “More than I wish for you to know about.”

I come from a country which not so long ago was in a dictatorship and let me tell you something… the feeling of “let’s fix our country now that the great evil is gone” is THE WORST for me as a reader because I already know first hand what it feels like to be in a place currently recovering from a dictator. SJM is American right? So I imagine American readers never had that feeling before, so let me tell you, it’s EXHAUSTING, it’s endless. 


(Before anyone comments, Trump sucks ass but he’s not a textbook dictator. Yet. I wish you the best of luck actually.)

So I'm just over a year into a full-time role (first full-time job since diagnosis) and it's just about become impossible to ignore what feels my body/health telling me I can't maintain a full time job. 

Since January, the weekends no longer help me recover. Feels like I'm losing 1% recharge every week. I'm so unbelievably fatigued and have such bad brain fog that 2 coffees do nothing and I'm just walking zombie until I'm home or finished work. 

I've recently had to have a nap after work (which is 100% not my normal) or at the very least lie down to rest. Barely walk anywhere, gym is a no go, and I find it difficult to care to cook anything that isn't shoved straight into the oven. 

When I've had a day or two, or even more, off, I feel absolutely fine and don't need caffeine. I think it's just the inflexibility of work. 

In-office days are worse but wfh are a struggle too. My job is at a desk so it's not as if I'm physically wearing myself out. 

Thing is I feel reinvigorated when I do freelance work (writing) and I think that's partly due to the fact that I can start and stop when I want, I can rest when I need, and use my energy to my benefit more. 

I'm working at going freelance but not 100% there yet. Have savings but I'm nervous to touch them. But the sheer tiredness after work and recuperation/chore catch up at the weekend makes it difficult to do freelance stuff. 

I've been looking up how this whole employer's accommodations thing works (UK) to hopefully go part-time but my boss is rigid in his ways so I'm not banking on it. He definitely won't give into fully remote (plus it doesn't really help me too much).

But it’s seems impossible to find this dynamic again, that experience, just leaves me wanting more, created an obsession in my head, I crave that high again and need it.

I’d probably construct a kind of internal library, but instead of shelves, it would be composed of shifting environments. A rainforest of forgotten philosophies. A moonlit observatory of undeciphered code. A jazz lounge where theoretical physicists argue with poets over entropy and love.

And I wouldn’t be alone. I’d populate it with characters—some I’ve met, some I’ve dreamed up. We'd play out thought experiments for no reason other than curiosity. Not to solve. Just to feel the echo.

So, I suppose my idea of relaxation isn’t silence. It’s *unstructured cognition*. Thought with no deadline. Awareness without urgency. A sort of still, symphonic unfolding.

I'm new to this city and don't really know anyone here, so I recently downloaded Bumble to maybe connect with people, friends, dates, whatever feels right. I'm 24F, and on July 16th, I came across this guy's profile (let's call him J, 29M). He had this nerdy, soft-looking vibe and I remember thinking, Wow, I'd love to meet someone like him. So I swiped right immediately.

We didn't match that day, but the next morning, I opened the app and saw that we had matched, I was honestly excited. I messaged him: ""I was hoping we'd match.""

But he didn't reply for almost 9 hours. I kept checking the app, waiting, not proud of it, but I just really liked what I saw and had that gut feeling, y'know?

Eventually he replied that evening, and we had a good chat. We even moved to Instagram, where he sent me some voice notes, and wow, I instantly loved his voice. Just added to the whole attraction I was already feeling.

**The Almost Friday Plan**

He asked if I wanted to hang out that Friday, and I was thrilled. But when the day came, he disappeared for a few hours, then later messaged saying he was stuck with work and couldn't make it. I was a little let down but understood.

**Saturday — Our First Actual Meet**

Saturday went by quiet for the most part, but around 8 PM he texted again and asked if I wanted to go for a late-night drive. I said yes. He picked me up around 11, and I was kind of freaking out internally, he looked exactly like his pictures, maybe even better, and was 100% my type.

Now here's the weird part: I'm usually super talkative on dates, but with him, I felt shy. It wasn't that I was nervous about him, but more nervous because I actually liked him. And he talks a lot too, which I love, but I felt unsure of when to speak, what to say, whether I was being too quiet or too much. I just wanted to come off well.

During the drive, he asked if I wanted to watch a movie at his place. Normally I say no on a first date, I have pretty clear boundaries, but something in me just didn't want the night to end. I said yes.

**Movie at His Place**

We ended up watching Confessions of a Shopaholic (my choice lol). We sat pretty far apart the whole time. Nothing physical happened and strangely, I found myself expecting a kiss or some kind of closeness… even though I didn't make a move either. I just didn't know how to act because I really liked him. It was like my brain short-circuited.

Movie ended around 3 AM. The energy turned kind of awkward, no real goodbye talk, just me quietly booking a cab. He did walk me to it and told me to text when I got home. I did. He replied saying he had a great time. But now I don't know if he meant it or was just being polite.

**The Days After**

Sunday- no message from him. I gave in and texted. He replied, but didn't really keep the conversation going.

By Sunday night, I was fully in crush mode and my friends encouraged me to take initiative. So on Monday, I texted him:

Me: ""Hey, do you want to hang out today? Maybe coffee or dinner?""

J: ""Hey, it’s difficult for me during weekdays. I’ll let you know just in case I get free early.""

Me: ""Okay sounds good.""



And then… silence. No message after that. But he's been viewing and reacting to my stories on Instagram. Even liked my office fit story.



So Now I'm Sitting With These Questions:

Did I do something wrong or come on too strong?

Is he just being polite with the story reactions?

Does he actually like me but is just bad at texting?

Or… is he just not that into me and I’m not seeing the signs?



I genuinely don't fall for people easily, and this whole experience has left me feeling very confused, a little vulnerable, and maybe even a little foolish. I just want to understand where I stand without pushing or being ""too much.""

**Storage Capacity:** Drum tables ​often feature hidden storage compartments, increasing their practicality.

**Base​ Design ​and Stability:** The ‌base design not only contributes to the table's overall ​aesthetics but also determines its stability. Common base types include pedestal bases, ‍tripod legs, or‌ solid cylindrical structures. A wider base generally offers⁣ enhanced‌ stability,which⁢ is especially important⁢ for ‌tables placed on uneven surfaces. Checking the materials and construction of the base will give insights on durability of the drum table.

I really liked her — she was even one of the reasons I discovered I have autism. I watched some of her stand-up and thought it was great. Then, last week, I found out she wrote a book: *Strong Female Character*. So, I bought it.

Five days ago, it arrived.  
That’s when it all began.

I opened the box.  
I saw her name...  
…and my head started screaming:  
**“It is me, Fern Brady! Me, Fern Brady! I’m the house’s queen!”**

I figured it would just go away, so I left the book on the coffee table.  
But the next five times I walked past it, my brain kept chanting:  
**“It is me, Fern Brady! Me, Fern Brady…”**

I hid the book behind the bookcase.  
But my brain *knows* it’s there.

1m5t4df,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m5t4df/i_keep_getting_told_i_look_like_different_people/,I Keep Getting Told I Look Like Different People [Part 2],"I've been feeling more irritable lately. I don't know if it's because of the lack of success in my job hunt, no sleep, or the stress beating me into the ground.

It's been a few weeks since I [last spoke](https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m4xbt2/i_keep_getting_told_i_look_like_different_people/) about this. Trying to make sense of it all.

Now, this is a good way to recount what's happening so I don't forget. I’m starting to take a mental note of every strange event that happens and how often.

Everything is just pissing me off lately. My mood swings are getting a little out of hand, and I'm starting to see things. Or my imagination is playing tricks on me. Who knows.

At this point, I feel like something’s very wrong, but I don’t want to admit it to myself.

Small chunks of time have gone missing. So this is a good way for me to keep track.

At first, it was nothing, I'd space out for a few moments and forget what I was doing. Nothing new. Just seemed like an ordinary problem that many people had.

Now, it's getting more gradual. Thirty minutes to an hour goes missing, and I wouldn't know how I got there or what I was doing.

Which is so fucking dangerous considering I have to watch over my seven-year-old. I don’t want another potential blackout to somehow put her in danger.

I explained the tunnel vision I had last time, how my line of sight faded into the center of my gaze. Well, that's still happening, and more frequently.

If that wasn’t bad enough, I'm also starting to notice some creepy shit.

Last week, I was at the park with Zoey when I noticed someone staring in my direction. They were an older man that possessed the most menacing, and coldest scowl that peered through my soul.

His face appeared to be swelling like that of a corpse dumped in a lake, and his eyes were sinking into his puffy flesh.

I couldn’t shake the feeling that he was an imposter. His eyes were fake.

Not only that, they were glowing an unnatural, pale yellow that was pulsing. A low-pitched hum accompanied with a vibration became present within my skull.

It almost looked like his arms were growing, and his head was turning clockwise more and more. I couldn’t break this staring contest.

Zoey excitedly yelled, ""Daddy, look at me!"" as she went down the slide, and my attention shifted back to her. I look back at the man, and he's completely normal.

I reverted back to my initial thought that I was just seeing things, and repressed it. Nothing I could do.

I started my day off today with a cup of black coffee to fully stimulate my mind. My mom was working at her business and Zoey was in school so I had the place to myself.

Once I was mentally awake, I couldn’t help but think about my life lately. It truly felt like I had the weight of the world on my shoulders.

So, I did the same thing I usually do as part of a variety of ways I like to cope with stress. The house looked messy, so I started to manically deep clean everything.

I picked up every piece of trash and used bowl or cup I could find around the place, wiped down counters, did the dishes, put laundry through, and my anxiety lessened the deeper I got in the process. Clean house, clean mind.

I was vacuuming in the living room with my headphones blaring screaming metal. Seems kind of contradictory to blast metal when I’m high-strung, but I’m weird like that.

I was coming around the corner of the sectional couch with the vacuum when I briefly noticed something in my peripheral vision. Down the dark hallway, for a split second, a shadow was roaming.

Then it was gone, sucked back into the void. Like noticing caused it to immediately scurry away.

Whispering approached me again. Vague at first, then growing but still distant. I tried really hard this time to pay attention to what I was hearing.

I thought I could make out chanting.

Then it stopped. I lied to myself again, believing it was nothing.

I can’t tell if I’m losing my grip on reality, or something more sinister is at play here.

After I cleaned the whole place, I decided to go to Safeway to pick up some groceries for the week. I was walking from my car to the doors when I saw a group of teenagers hanging out at the outside tables to the right.

One of them was staring at me.

He had a smirk on his face. Not in the way a rowdy teenager would, this was different.

His lips were contorted, twisting upward on one side to reach lifeless eyes that were three times as tall as they should’ve been.

As I met his stare, his irises flared a sickly pale yellow, like dying embers. A low hum started to shake the inside of my skull, so sharp and cold.

I looked away, my heart pounding, as his eyes continued to fixate on me. A vignette had started around the edges of my perception, but faded soon after.

Soon after, I had everything loaded into my shopping cart and I was ready to go. At the checkout line, the cashier was scanning my items.

We were sharing some small talk, and I was just about to pay when I looked down and there was a large kitchen knife in my hand.

“You know, this is crazy, but you look a lot like the guy from that *Man of Steel* movie, I forget his name though…” She said to me.

I didn’t question where the knife had come from. Without a second thought, I snapped and drove the blade *into her neck.*

She stumbled backward and hopelessly clenched the giant gash that I put there. Eyes draining of life, she started panicking and flailing backward.

Screams erupted and people ran away as they noticed her gurgling and reaching towards them, hoping someone could save her from the nightmare that took her just now.

I slowly followed behind in anticipation as she collapsed to the floor. I stood over her like an aggressive menace while she stared into my eyes with a pleading look as her life was being snuffed out.

All she could get out was, *“Why?”* as blood pooled around her.

I said nothing. I just stood there and smiled.

And then—

—she was standing in front of me, holding out my receipt.

“Have a great day,” she told me.

Did I even respond to what she had said prior? I can’t recall.

She gave me an awkward smile. Probably because I just stood there looking like an idiot. The knife was gone.

I left the store and got back to my car, obsessively checking my hands for blood or any sharp objects.

I fumbled around my jacket pockets and found a note. It was from Zoey. It said “I love you!”

But the handwriting was too neat. Not the best, but a solid step up from a child’s writing.

I swear I saw this note earlier and it looked just like her normal handwriting.

I broke down in tears, my head hanging over the steering wheel. Tunnel vision began to set in again as I was sniffling and wiping the tears from my eyes. I blacked out.

I awoke in my car, in the same place. Fuck, I totally lost track of time. How long have I just been sitting here for?

I looked at the clock in my car. It was nearly time to go get Zoey from school.

The pickup line always gets packed when school gets out so I was definitely gonna be a few minutes late. Hope she wasn’t too upset about it.

When she was walking up to my car, I couldn’t tell if my disoriented eyes were playing tricks on me, but I couldn’t make out all the details of her face. As she got closer, I realized that was just an illusion my mind displayed.

She got in and did indeed look upset. I got her ice cream though, so we’re cool now.

The rest of the day went normal, nothing notable to speak of. Me and her were just watching more TV as I typed away on my laptop.

Later tonight, I was at the pub with my friend Danny, one of the friends from high school. I noticed Jennifer wasn't there. We'd still been talking, and things were still good with us.

One positive out of all the weird fucked up shit happening lately.

Danny and I were playing a game of pool on a Friday night; the place was packed. The typical pub that would turn into a party on weekend nights.

We were chatting about some new games we've been playing lately. I was telling him how many hours I stacked in the Oblivion remake.

The overhead lights flickered from the usual warm, cozy tint to a cool, bright one that resembled a holding cell.

I was about to take my shot with the pool cue when my concentration was broken. I noticed a group of friends drinking together at the end of the bar.

One was hunched over the bar, staring at me through his eyebrows with his head hunched under his shoulders and arms extending to the end of the bar.

His hands clenched the edge of the bartop. His mouth was gaped open while he did this.

The ambient noise of the bar, conversations, laughs, and glasses clinking all seemed to fade into obscurity as he controlled me with his stare.

I shuddered. Danny slapped my chest with the back of his hand. ""Yo, you payin' attention, bro?""

""Yeah… sorry, man,"" I responded.

We continued our conversation and game, and for a brief second, I glanced back at the guy. He was sitting upright with his beer and wasn't even paying attention to me.

He was so caught up with his buddies that there was no way he could've even noticed me.

""I've been pretty into the new Death Stranding game. I know the gameplay isn't for everybody, but I really enjoy the grind."" Danny said to me.

""Yeah, I mean more power to you, man, but it's not my thing. I do like the main actor from that game, though. Boondock Saints is one of my all-time favorite movies."" I said in return.

""You know, that's funny because you actually kinda *look* like that guy."" He said with a casual chuckle.

I shot a look at him so quickly that he probably would've thought I was pissed off for a second if I didn’t quickly regain my composure.

I didn't tell him how nobody close to me has been saying things like this, not like how everyone else was telling me. I was frustrated, but I hid it well.

I just said, ""Oh, that's crazy… I guess I never thought about that."" I quickly tried redirecting the conversation elsewhere. So, the night continued on.

Afterwards, we left the bar and went our separate ways.

I was driving home when I glanced in the rearview mirror. That same guy from the bar was in my backseat, slumped over again.

His gaping mouth stretched far beyond what I could see in the reflection. He was pointing at me.

The low hum returned in my head, followed by a voice that said, “It’s almost time.”

I was so petrified that I couldn’t even get a scream out. And just before I knew it, gone. Again.

Faint whispering came to me again, this time from the radio. I swear I never turned it on.",2,1753127653.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

What is your story?,"Hello, everyone. A lot has been going through my mind about self-confidence, weight loss, appearance, and mental health. Because of that, I wanted to write this post talking about what I am doing and will be doing and I would really appreciate any feedback, tips and tricks, and your personal experiences as well.

I am a **23** year old man, **5 foot 7 inches in height**, and **230 lbs in weight**. Not at all happy with the way I look. I used to skinny as a child and my weight always fluctuated but in the past few years, I have not gone below 210 lbs. I'm at a point in life where the self realizations have hit that I need to get it together. I struggle a lot with self-confidence issues and am always hyper-focused on how I appear. The classic shirt tugging, then keep checking the pictures you click to see if your chest doesn't appear to be big. Nothing wrong with that of course but it brings me down a lot. I'm in my summer break right now and it has taught me a lot in many areas in my life.

My **goal** is to reach **190 lbs**. After that, whether I want to continue or start body building, can't think about unless I achieve what I really want now.

I've made some **small changes** which I would like to share. For the past 6 days, I've been going to the gym. First 4 days, all I did was 15 minutes of treadmill, 3 miles per hour and 12 incline. I would feel like fainting after just those 15 minutes. Then, Saturday, I went to walk in the morning on this trail. Its located literally right next to where I live so it was easy to push myself to go. I walked around 4.2 miles in total. Not sure how many steps that was, I should have been using an app or something. Then, last night, I went to the gym and was able to be on the treadmill for 30 minutes. Granted, I raised the incline slowly this time but I was able to burn more calories so it felt really good. Legs felt horrible around the 15 minute mark but then I didn't feel any discomfort after that. I was kind of surprised. Not sure what that was. Also, I read another post about walking 20k steps per day. I might have the ability to do that some times a week so I actually might create like a 100k steps per week goal. What do you guys think of that?

**Entertainment** wise, I've been listening to songs and podcasts during my gym/walk time. I really want to get into interesting history or politics so if anybody has any recommendations, let me know!

**Food** wise, I've been roughly measuring my calorie intake. Right now, I average about 1800 calories per day. my BMR is 2000 calories per day. Do you guys think that is good enough? I'm a vegetarian (+eggs). I'm Indian so I cook Indian food at home. Mornings are either cereal or coffee with some Belvita cookies. Snacks might include low sodium chips or protein bars. Dinner and lunch is something Indian. If I order from outside, it might be the chipotle veggie bowl or the veggie wrap from chick-fil-a.

**Appearance** wise, I've observed a few things this past year and got some suggestions. One is to have either slightly unkempt hair but very well maintained beard or the opposite. I like to not touch my beard and let it be the way it is so I want to focus on my hair. Ordered a pomade to get it to look the way I want it to. Not sure though. Also, I used to hate the idea of accessorizing yourself with rings, necklaces, etc. But, as I've gotten older, my mind has sort of shifted. I'm getting more in tune with my family's religion (Sikh) as well and my mom has actually told me ways I could do that. Three things I'm doing is, a ring, a sikh necklace, and a sikh kara (bracelet). I have one and the others, I'll be getting soon.

All of this thinking has actually made me a bit more productive in work as well. I would love to hear everyone's stories so I can learn more and if you guys have been feedback or tips, please do share. Peace and love.",1,1753127598.0,DecidingToBeBetter,0,1.0,False

Not sad. Not angry. Not even exhausted. Just… nothing. Like my brain turned the switch off to survive, and I never turned it back on.

I was overwhelmed with work, university pressure, loneliness, expectations—so I buried the pain. Left it there like a wound I didn’t have time to treat. I told myself it’ll heal with time. But it didn’t. It just closed over like a scab covering rot. And I carried that quiet infection with me every day. Until I couldn’t anymore.

Now that I have some time alone, I did something I didn’t expect:
I opened the wound.
I let it hurt.
I sterilized the wound by pouring alcohol
I let myself cry.
I let myself scream inside.
And damn—it’s brutal.

But it's also the first real thing I've felt in a long time.

I realized that feeling bad is actually better than feeling nothing. Feeling grief, sadness, joy, even silliness—it’s human. And I’ve missed being human. I've missed me.

So I started walking every day. Sketching again. Practicing drums. Drinking coffee slowly. Reading. Writing. Letting myself be creative without performance anxiety. Letting myself FEEL things.

I’ve also been reflecting hard. I cared too much about responsibilities—grades, projects, proving something. And in the end? The results were meh. My GPA barely moved. But my health? My soul? Crushed.

Now I’m trying to rebalance.
To not let responsibilities consume me.
To not let numbness become my normal.
To not equate performance with worth.

Some days still suck. Some days I relapse into feeling empty. But lately, I’ve been feeling good. And it’s real. It’s not fake positivity. It’s earned. It hurts—but it’s real.

If you’re reading this and you’ve been numb too—please know this:
Opening the wound hurts. But it’s the only way it truly heals.

You’re not broken. You’re just still carrying too much.

Let it hurt. Let yourself be human again.

I’m rooting for you.

For context: last semester I had a break up that was brutal, after 3.5 years of a relationship. a friend passed away due to sucide. Friends left me while they damn well knew I was suffering, and mocked me. Financially wise I was broke whole semester and swimming in debt, while my teammates did not pay any penny for our graduation project. And I survived a serious sucide attempt. Now reflecting, I wish I processed everything at that time. I forced myself to be a machine just to make it. ",1,1753127492.0,DecidingToBeBetter,0,1.0,False

Aside from being terrified of pretty much the entire process, I'm also really worried about bending. I haven't had my pre-op appointment yet, so I'm unfamiliar with restrictions and haven't gotten a chance to ask a ton of questions, but I keep reading on here that you're not supposed to bend? What does ""no bending"" actually mean? Do they mean bending as in from a standing position, like reaching for something? Or do they mean no leaning over at all?

I'm panicking because my natural state of sitting is sitting cross-legged and bent over. That's how I sit on the couch, the bed, at my desk. When I'm stressed out I sit with my legs crossed and bent over with my elbows on my knees. I frequently sit on the floor and to work on art projects, using either a coffee table or the floor as a working surface. I spend my lunch break at work sitting on the floor, because it keeps me calm (I know it's weird, but I have my own office and my co-workers are used to it).

I don't know what I'm going to do if I can't fold myself in half. Like... it's ingrained in me. I've been this way since I was a kid. I'm scared that on top of all of the internal body changes, pain, and hormonal crap that I'll also have to completely relearn how to position my body. I'm not exactly the best at dealing with change.

How long does the not bending restriction usually last?

Any suggestions on how to stop panicking would be amazing. I figure I should go back to being terrified about things that are less dumb than sitting positions, but at the moment, this is what my mind has chosen to panic over.",3,1753127457.0,hysterectomy,1,1.0,False

When I get annoyed at him because I have to keep asking him to tidy up his mess or help with housework while I am at work he says that my love for him is transactional that I am only nice to him if he has performed transactional tasks for me which makes me apparently a toxic abuser and manipulator, the most toxic form of abuse ‘Witholding’ and he sends me screenshots of articles and definitions telling me that’s what I’m doing to him. 
I feel like when I’m not ‘nice’ to him it’s only when I’ve been continually asking for help that I feel like I’m not getting and get annoyed at him but he says I should be nice all the time and not require ‘transactions’ to be met to be nice. It doesn’t make sense to me because can a person never be annoyed at someone? Am I supposed to be nice continually to him, despite how he treats me? I just feel like that would make me a doormat if I can never express how I am feeling.

Bit of background, we’ve been together over 3 years now, living together around 9 months and household responsibilities have been a struggle. I am working full time whilst he has been off work waiting for his new job to start in September (left the military to be closer to me, but then struggled to find employment). He does some work here and there but on the whole has a lot of free time. He cooks most nights but I still do it a few times a week. Cleaning doesn’t really happen unless I keep mentioning it or ‘nagging’ him as he would say. 

This issue of my transactional niceness has been brought up a lot but more so recently when I asked him to unpack his suitcase after a holiday.
We went both had an amazing time together, got home late Saturday night. Sunday had lunch with my family then did our weekly food shop (out the house 4 hours max). I unpacked all of my stuff that afternoon but he wanted to relax and said he would do his stuff Monday. His suitcase was emptied out in the living room with stuff strewn about which I didn’t like but it was only temporary.

Monday I was working from home he was playing his games or on his phone in the morning then had an unexpected errand regarding his old job to drop something off, had a nearly 3 hour round trip then while out met a friend who lived that way for coffee and had lunch, got home about 3 ish, went for a run then chilled out, still didn’t unpack his stuff, said he would do it tomorrow as he was tired, still I was ok with it whatever. 

Tuesday I left for work at 8am before leaving asked him if he could just please sort his suitcase out today as the mess was stressing me out and could he get the couple bits we needed from the shop for dinner that night, I was going to be cooking but asked if he could just prep it like chop the veg ahead of time so it’s quicker for me to get in the oven when I get home so we don’t eat too late. I get home about 6.15pm and he’s only just got back from the shop and was chatting to the neighbour. 

Nothing had been prepped for dinner he said he didn’t realise that was a set thing I was asking for and thought I was just saying it was an idea, and also discovered his suitcase was still strewn about the living room. I asked why he hadn’t done it and he said that he needed a rest day after having a busy holiday, then Sunday and Monday he was out so didn’t get to fully rest. 
I said it would have taken no more than half an hour why couldn’t he have just done it, it still left over 8 hours of rest but he says that I ignore his healthy set boundaries which is toxic behaviour of me, when he says he needs a rest day he needs to have an uninterrupted day of rest to recharge, even a 10 minute task would interrupt that. 

This completely baffles me as I was on holiday with him too and then was out on Sunday with him but managed to unpack my stuff then I didn’t get a full day of rest I was back to my 9-5 job. He doesn’t have a full time job currently, after getting home from holiday he has two full weeks with no work until his next week of temp work, so has like 10 more rest days. 

I’m the type of person that likes my environment to be tidy, not to say I’m not messy myself too but if there’s a task that needs doing then I prefer to do that to get it over with and I can fully relax. He is the type that says you shouldn’t let chores delay happiness and to prioritise rest and leave them until later. 

I got upset because it was one thing I had been asking him to do, which was in my opinion a fairly quick and easy task, and it was his mess, I wanted the living room tidied so I didn’t have to look at it when I relax after work in the evening. 
This then brought up the whole issue of me being toxic again and that I am only nice to him when he does what I ask. I feel like I’m going crazy as this seems so strange to me but he’s telling me that I’m the toxic one? ",5,1753127181.0,relationship_advice,6,1.0,False

Finding Grace’ 

Not really remembering anything from before, Before, a dark raven haired Latina, brown eyed girl named Jenna Ortega’ had awakened into a world in which she would now find herself. Living in a world now where she see meets people that have since passed. But from within her new world that she now lives in, along with the people that she meets along the way. While riding her bike discovering new trails that would show her a life that was once hers. 

From waking up to looking out her window into a world that was still very new to her,  while still giving her the feeling of that she has always been here. With anticipation of what was about to be, Jenna’ a very outgoing dark haired girl! That very much knew how to handle things that would come her way. 

While at the same time meeting new people along the way while finding herself coming closer to some in her life. But as Jenna’ would quickly get dressed, anticipating what the day may bring her. Wearing a black tee and a pair of cut at the knees jeans! Not forgetting about her shoes that just fit her personality that she was to everyone around her. 

A girl that wasn’t afraid to express herself! While at the same time excepting a challenge! From anyone that wanted to race her! With her showing them what was! While at the same time! Finding herself coming closer to others! Knowing that the world around her was changing every day seeing and meeting new people along the way. While at the same time! Finding out that some people around her had many stories of their own to share. Finding herself coming close to some! Whether it was as a friend! or like family to her! 

But as Jenna’ quickly got dressed! Grabbing her bike and on her way she went! Not looking back! But only ahead! Ahead to what was to be! As she was now finding herself. Looking out onto a bustling street in front of her, Jenna’ was going to let nothing stand in her way! From doing this run! A run that she had a done dozens of times before. For just as the morning’s sun was making its way into a new day. A new day for her! For everything seemed new to Jenna’

In a way that was just unexplainable to her! For it felt like she had always been here, lived here! And was born here. But unknowingly to her at the moment, the days ahead would show her different paths. Paths that would take her to slowly finding out who she was. For as sat there on her bike, looking down a street just in front of her was that long all downhill from there. But the need to race! The need for speed was there! And she here now and ready for her run.

With her not always having the feeling of really not knowing on how or why she was here. But in a way she felt that she had always been here, but with her having that feeling in her that something felt different about her. Different in a way that no one could describe, but she only knew where she was at the moment! only knowing the moment! 

For this morning was hers, nothing was going to stop her from breaking her prior tries before. Taking one last look around her, just before letting it all go! Feeling the wind push up against her! Speeding in and around cars along the way!

With the feeling of something just being different about still residing within her, more so than usually toady. With the feeling that all of this still felt very new to her! The surroundings! The people! Everything thing about the place. But while everything seemed new to her! It still felt like she belonged here! That she had always been here.

Jenna’ was a young outgoing girl just shy of her 23rd birthday. Growing up in a small town that had a big city feel to it to her. But to Jenna’ it was her home, but she liked to think of it as a sprawling city that one day she would riding her bike through the downtown streets. 

Weaving in and around cars passing by them as the wind blew through her long Raven hair! feeling free from the world around her! Racing was her excitement! And it showed! With her smile saying it all. Making her way through the towns traffic passing by people with some waving as she passed them by.

With Jenna’ having the feeling of nothing could stop her from trying her best to break her speed time Pryor to each day.  Often finding herself at the other end of the local law enforcement, as officer Cross’ would many times say to her

“Jenna’! Now don’t make me write you a ticket today for speeding!” 

As he would always say laughingly to her. mainly it was just him watching out for her! For her own safety.  But Jenna’ also had someone else watching out for her! A young latino! Named Hector’! With his dark hair brown eyes, And a smile For Jenna’! But Jenna’ was just your typical young brown eyed girl! Who liked her shredded jeans and tee shirt and hoodie living her life! Her way. 

Occasionally finding some of the local boys racing with her trying to out do one another. With Jenna’ being the girl that she was! Never backing down from a challenge, finding herself racing through the towns streets, finding herself racing along with one or two others.

Not to say that one of them didn’t catch her eye, But! From time to time, Hector’ very much would catch her eye, for he was the kinda guy that could charm on a dime. A Latino, Who had a keen mind and the street smarts to match! Especially on a bike. Often calling out to Jenna’ saying to her.

“So you think you’re fast huh! Well maybe we can just find out just how fast you can go!”

But at the same time finding himself racing along side of Jenna’ Whether it be on the streets or on one of many mountain trails that surrounded them. Knowing that each had feelings for the other, but never really acting on it. Knowing that Jenna’ was a well to do girl, often finding himself with Jenna’ leaving him with a glance and a smile! as Jenna’ left him looking. And saying to himself “Dam! That’s my girl!”

Just way the way he liked it! Always watching out for her. While Jenna’ didn’t have many people in her life or let many get close to her, Hector was different! 

Leaving everyone she met with a smile she was a girl with a slim build standing at around five foot and four inches. Gliding her way through the traffic imagining as if she was racing through the downtown streets of San Francisco. Often finding herself riding her bike for the bike was her life her way of escape. She even had a name for her bike often calling it ‘Quicksilver’ riding her bike faster and farther each day. Finding new trails along the way but with each new trail she would ride. It was like it was showing something to her! As if it was trying to tell her something! 

But with each new day bringing something new to her! A new trial, a new street to ride on, and occasionally a new person.

Finding herself Occasionally stopping by the local bike shop finding herself talking to Jack’ for jack was like a big brother to her. One who also knew himself very well on a bike, Jenna’ would often find herself talking to listening to Jack tell her all about his days in the big city. Telling Jrnna’ about his own street races, with Jenna’ always enjoying there talks whenever she was in his shop.

For whenever she was on her bike she felt faster than anyone around her and that there was nothing that she could not do on that bike. One street in particular had a steep incline to it for the street itself was not very long but long enough for what Jenna’ needed it be. 

For it gave her enough speed that it felt as if she could go on forever! Dodging in and out of traffic! But always avoiding the people as she would often came onto the sidewalk bringing a lot of speed passing people as they made their way. 

Sometimes she would dream as if she was riding her bike through the streets of San Francisco or New York. But Life for Jenna’ was here in her hometown it was often just a carefree life for her. More than often finding herself thinking about her life! For oddly enough it just did not feel like it was her life! It felt as if she was living someone else’s life other than her own. 

For many times while riding on one of the many trials outside of town. She would often find herself on a different trail, a trail Leading her to new areas, to new adventures, as if it was showing her thoughts. Thoughts that wasn’t her thoughts, that was as if they belonged to someone else. It was as if she was seeing things as someone else’s was seeing them! 

But for now life for her was just her and her bike the one possession in her life that she most often cared for the most. Making her way through the streets making her way the local coffee shop where she worked. A Coffee Shop, That was owned by Hector’s father.

Also named Hector’ She would also find herself taking with him not only about bikes! But also about different things in general. With one! Being of his son Hector’ for Jenna” very much had a crush on him! Often finding herself dreaming of not only Hector’ but a life being on her own! Making her own way in life on her bike.

Just as a regular would walk in as he often would, setting down to enjoy his morning cup of joe. A regular, who was named Voodoo’ Lawrence Fishburne,or at least his friends would call him that. Often finding himself talking to Jenna Ortega’ telling Jenna’ about his own little bike rides. When he was a bike rider from the city! A regular that Jenna’ came know from their talks at the coffee shop.

For Voodoo’ would often tell Jenna’ about his many adventures aboard and local, telling her that even though there were many great locations about. That there was none like our very own town that we had here, for the many great nights he had here in the mountains when he was younger. Jenna’ always enjoyed there talks often telling him about her own little adventures in the mountains.

But oddly enough whenever Voodoo’ would talk about the town that they were in, that he would say that this is where I wanted to be buried. That For all of his many travels to many different places, seeing all that he had seen! That in the end that this was his home! This was where he wanted his final resting place to be.

For often Jenna’ would find herself in the mountains just outside of the town riding her bike on some of its many trails one particular. A trial that she would often ride a trial where she was at the moment making her way through it. Gliding past the trees catching glimpses of the sun as its light glimmered through the trees around her.

It was a warm day as she could feel and see the nature of the forest all around her with nothing but blue sky ahead of her. Approaching the place where she would often come. Jenna’ would find herself setting there on her bike overlooking a ravine where in the distance she could see the town in which she had grew up in. 

She would often refer to it as Angels Ravine, For to anyone standing there could look as if they were looking out into a dream. A Ravine that seemed to go on forever over into the valley ahead. It was almost as if you was an Angel looking out from Heaven itself it was a quit place it was her place. Often finding herself there where she would come to often

But just on the other side of Angels Ravine, was a mountain trail that many bikers dared not to challenge. But not Jenna’ for she knew one day that she would conquer that path, but unknowingly at the time. She would find herself with Hector and others in a challenge that they would never forget. Finding herself there on many occasions just to relax, to think about her life! Thinking about her life growing up for she didn’t have any family or many friends. Or at least any that she could remember. 

And the few she had, had moved away after High school whether it was for college or just Life itself. But a couple of people who she find herself talking to or occasionally racing against here in the city streets. Or on one of the many trails that was on the outskirts of town, Jenna’ found that life for her was there in the mountains along with her bike.

But as the day grew long with Jenna’ setting there on the ledge looking down into the ravine below her Knowing that she should be heading back. For the darkness never really bothered her for she had many times ridden back in the dark under a nights sky. 

For Jenna’ loved riding at night under a starlit sky above her for being alone with nothing but her and stars in the sky. For she knew the area really well and enjoyed its peace that it brought to her but also kept a light on her. that she could attach to the front of her bike as she rode through the trails she could feel nothing but a somber feeling all over her. But as the nights cool breeze blew against her sending feelings of thoughts that would sometimes come over her. 

Thoughts that oddly enough did not feel like her thoughts, thoughts that often would feel like they belonged to someone else’s. Finding herself later that night after arriving back at her apartment the rain had just begun to fall standing there in the rain. Thinking to herself a thought that would often come to her 

“If I am not me then who am I “

A thought that she often would find herself thinking about but always keeping them to herself. While also thinking to herself who else would she tell for oddly enough it seemed that it was just only her. Having no family at least none that she ever knew of it for it had always just been her by herself.

With only the people around her that was already there making her way inside setting down into her cozy little chair. There she would set listening to the rain falling just outside as it came down. Setting there thinking as she would often do about her life then slowly as she would began to fall asleep listening to the rain. Just as a dream would come to her. 

A dream that she would often have a dream that she would often find herself thinking about a lot. Thinking was this her life? But as she dreamed a girl she could see a girl that looked identical to her as if she was her sister her twin but in another Life. 

Always being the same girl but in different places but never where Jenna’ was! Never in the same town that she had grew up in. In the dream the girl never acknowledged her or even looked at her as if she was seeing another girls life as if it was her Life. But as the dreams would come they would go,

 Waking up in the chair that she would often find herself fallen asleep in looking out of the window into the suns morning light.

Thinking to herself 

“Why am I seeing this other girl? If I am me then who is she?”

Walking over to the window looking out into a sun filled day, looking at people as they would pass by. Some she knew, while others being new to the area! Standing there thinking if any of these people could be who they are! Could they be of someone else from somewhere else!

Thinking back on her time here, thinking back on her job, though she remembers working there. But she couldn’t remember when she first started there! It was like she had always been there! Just then realizing that she was late for work. Forgoing the morning shower slipping into her work clothes Jenna’ rushed out of her front door grabbing her bike on the way. knowing that speed was going to be her best friend this morning. 

Making her way through the streets the only way she knew weaving in out of the traffic occasionally hearing the honking of a car horn. throwing their hand up ether by saying a hello or to just watch where you are going. To Jenna’ that was her Life! Being on her bike loosing herself in the world around her! Racing as the wind blowing up against her making her way through the town. For today was going to be a good day not only at work seeing not only the Locals coming in giving a smile to people from all over. 

People who was either just passing through or in town for the it’s many mountain trails. Finding herself telling passerby’s of many of her own mountain adventures. For after her shift at the coffee house was over Jenna’ herself was then going to head back out to Angels Ravine for Angels Ravine was what Grace would refer to it by.

For it was to her of what Heaven would be like, for it was her own little piece of Heaven. But this time she was not only planning on just a day trip but on spending the night there. Surprisingly as her work day would go much faster than normal having only a few customers here and there. With excitement grabbing her bike leaving her work day behind her headed for the door she couldn’t wait for to her getting there was half the fun. 

Riding her bike out of town it was only a couple of miles down the road to where the trial leading up to Angels Ravine was. It was a warm afternoon as always Grace enjoyed the ride hearing the sounds of nature all around her. With the occasional breeze that would make its way through the trees. normally she would be trying to best her own speed trying to best herself. 

But this time was different this day would be different, for a couple of days back a group of outsiders. A group that Jenna’ had not seen in the area before, a group of young cocky bike riders. Had challenged Jenna’ and Hector to a race, but not just any race but a race down the other side of Angels Ravine.

With Jenna’ and Hector arriving at the site first finding themselves setting there looking out over Angels Ravine. Setting there just enjoying the moment together talking about their time in the town together. The times that they had racing one another through the streets, coming up here to mountains. Setting there on Angel’s Ravine looking out over into the Ravine just ahead of them Jenna’ then turned to Hector asking him

“Do you ever think that you was someone else’s before”

With a puzzled look on Hector’s face he then replied back to her saying 

“Someone Else’s! No! What kind of question is that? Jenna’ are you feeling okay!”

With smiling to him just as she said 

“It’s just! I really don’t know! It’s like I’m or was someone else, I can’t really explain it.”

With Hector giving a laugh as he said to her

“I don’t know what I would do with two Jenna’s All I know is how I feel about the Jenna’ that is here now, setting here beside of me.”

With Jenna’ then giving him a smile just she then placed her head his shoulder saying to him

“I don’t know what I would do another me either! I can barely handle myself at times”

With Hector placing his arms around Jenna’ before telling her

“I Don’t think I could handle another you either! laughing, I just know that I am holding the one Jenna’ that I want to be with.”

Giving each other a smile as they set there looking out into what could be there future ahead.

But just before they could get lost in the moment again, the other group had arrived.

They had arrived ready to show their dominance on the mountain, but with Jenna’ and Hector ready eager to show them other wise. 

The challenge was underway with Hector taking the lead first going down the steep incline, quickly followed by the outsiders, with Jenna’ trailing but was soon to catch up. 

The trail was daunting with very steep inclines, as they raced along the mountain trail. But just as Hector was out in front one of the outsiders came up from behind him. Running purposefully close to him knocking him off balance sending him crashing off the trail. 

With Jenna’ then stopping to check on him as Hector’ then motioned to her saying to her

“Go! Go get ‘em Jenna! You got this!”

And with that it wasn’t too long before Jenna’ had caught up to them, for Jenna’ knew the trails like no other. 

Racing hard and fast to the finish side by side! Just as Jenna’ then gave him a look and smile to the outsider as she then pulled away. just the outsider went flying off of the trail! Leaving him setting there as Jenna’ had won the race.

Later that evening Jenna’ and Hector’ would spend the evening together, talking to each other. Talking about what may be store in the future for them as Hector then slowly looked to Jenna’ just before giving her a kiss.

With Hector’ then saying goodbye to Jenna’ as he then headed back to town leaving Jenna’ there for the night.

As she came to the ravine Jenna’ then found herself setting down on the ledge looking out over the valley over across the mountains ahead. Thinking to herself that this was Heaven at least what Heaven would be like to her. After setting up her camp for the night setting down again looking out into the sunset as its light shined down onto the valley out into the town below. For many sunrise and sunsets Jenna’ had watched from there. 

But this one was different in a way that she could not describe with only a few words but just looking out into it. It was if time itself was coming to an end. 

Looking back down unto the town as the light of the sun shown down on it Jenna’ began to think to think back on her Life wondering to herself if she had a family out there somewhere. 

Wondering that if she did have a family what would her family be like? What was her childhood like? 

For as far back Jenna’’ could remember she had no family. For growing up all she could remember was that one morning she just woke up being in a place with the town and the people around her. But not as her family just people in her life a life that has seemingly went by all too fast. With the sun now slowly setting behind the mountains ahead of her.

Jenna’ would set there enjoying it as the last of its light would slowly disappear behind the mountains as the first star of the night would appear over head. Feeling a cool breeze starting to set in as Jenna’ lay there in her sleeping bag looking up into the starlit sky that was adorned above her. lying there just simply enjoying a nice quite night but as sleep would find her. 

The same dream the same dream that Jenna’ had so many times before. With the same girl the girl that Jenna’ would refer to her as her identical sister from what seemed to be from another Life. 

Living her life but not the same as her for everything around her was different, different in the way she had lived before! Before the town that she lived in now! But this time something happened that had never happened before. A name was said that had never been said before in the dream and that was name of the girl in her dreams someone then called her Jenna’

Suddenly waking up to the morning’s light putting her hands up to her head Jenna’ just set there stunned. Thinking to herself

“Who was this other Jenna’ And why do I keep seeing her?”

Feeling how real the dream was for her, unlike the others that dream actually seemed as if I was there! I was her! 

Still visibly shaken as Jenna’ just sat there looking around suddenly startled by a presence. 

With the presence being of a man standing there just outside of the tree line standing there looking at her. But Just before Jenna’ began to scream! A calmness suddenly came over her a feeling of something telling her that everything was alright. Just as the man spoke saying

 “Hello Jenna’ it is a pleasure to meet you so please do not be alarmed. For I am not here to harm you” 

With a feeling of relief coming over Jenna’ as Jenna’ then replied saying to himself

“Then why are you standing there looking at me! And how do you know my name?” 

“I know all about you Jenna’ I know your entire Life up until now. And I know the answer that you seek” 

With Jenna’ then replying 

“Answers to what? What answers do I seek” 

“ Dreams, Jenna’ your dreams.” 

As Jenna’ just set there still stunned now more curious then ever Jenna’ just suddenly shouted out the girl! Who was the girl in my dreams? 

The man then just smiled and simply said that 

“It is you Jenna’ and it is not you”

More confused then ever Jenna’ just replied by saying 

“Me! How” 

Just as the man then slowly approached Jenna’ standing there looking out into the valley below as he then said to her. 

“ In your Life you was you, and she was her in her Life.”

“But now in this Life you are her and she is not! and you are not. For her Life is her Life! For the Life that was once you is a Life that is no longer your Life” 

with Jenna’ then replying 

“Is this Heaven then and are you an Angel?” 

With a smile the man just simply said 

“ I am who I am! someone that is there, someone that knows. And no this is not Heaven! This is your Heaven Jenna’ And this is your Life the Life that you ask for” 

just as the man then slowly made his way back to the tree line. He then turned and said to Jenna’

 “The dreams shall now end, and your dreams shall begin.” 

“For do not look at what was then, just look at what is now! But look for what is to come!  for Life itself is the most precious thing that a person can have!”

“Now go and Live your Life Jenna’ for Life is what has been granted to you” 

Just then as the mysterious man then disappeared into the tree line never again to be seen by Jenna’ was now standing there looking out over Angels Ravine, Jenna’ couldn’t help but to feel a little different about her Life. 

As the then dreams of the girl was now slowly fading away from her forever. With only her dreams to come! Living a Life of whatever was to come for Jenna’

Looking down onto her town, the town seemed different to her it seemed different because now for it was her town her home. Her Life! With Jenna’ now leaving Angels Ravine, making her way back home, but as usual finding herself racing to beat her own best time.

Jenna’ was now making her way back into in Life, along with Hector by her side, riding through the streets on her bike weaving in and out of traffic. For the streets was hers and Life on her bike was now going to take her places that she had never gone before. For she was now riding into Life! into her

An elimination diet has shown the I need to avoid lots of delicious wonderful foods. I love fresh, flavorful whole foods and homemade dressings and sauces- and this sucks. What flavor profiles I can get without the list below*? How can I brighten herbs without acid? Or make flavorful salad dressing, legumes, sauces, without acid or alliums?
*Please note, miso/ginger is safe and I've been doing it for a year and am sick of it. Please suggest something new and different!

On better days, with medication, I can fudge it a bit, do small amounts of one or two. Garlic or onion powder is less triggering for example. Or if I eat super clean for a few days I can do a little citrus or vinegar in a dressing, a bit of dairy, etc.

Triggers:
Gluten •
Dairy •
Garlic •
Onions •
Citrus •
Tomatoes •
Vinegar •
Eggs •
Fried foods •
Spicy foods •
Chocolate •
Coffee •
Bell peppers 


Thank you sooooooo much!!!

**CHAPTER TWO**

DIFFERENT

  *“Legends never die,”* Dad told me once. *“They may perish physically, but they will forever carry on within us, motivating us to keep their legacy alive. We must make their fight worth it.”*

  I sit in the rocking chair across from him, my legs are barely long enough to reach the floor if I lean back.

  “How does a person create a legacy?” I ask him, my voice still infused by youthful innocence.

  “People who have a legacy have paid a price that not many people are willing to pay, no matter the outcome. They have a fire burning within them that is kindled only when the time is right,” he says, his steel-blue eyes locked into mine.

  His words hit me in a different way. One I will never forget.

  \*\*\*\*\*\*

  “Lainey!” I hear Dad’s voice from the hall. “We have to leave here in a few minutes.”

  I jolt in my desk chair, his voice piercing through the silence. I take a sip of coffee—cold.

  *Great. How long have I been sitting here?*

  Forcefully swallowing the coffee, I quickly start lacing my boots up and grabbing a green jacket out of the closet before Dad realizes I’ve been sitting around.

  I tie my hair up in a low ponytail, some pieces draping to the side of my face.

  “I’m ready. Sorry, it took a few more minutes,” I sigh, rushing to the kitchen to refill my thermos with coffee.

  “The truck’s warming up, your lunch is already packed. Oh, and make sure to take a coat just in case the weather acts up,” he says, walking out the door while putting his arms through his coat.

  “Okay, thanks.”

  I step out of the front door. The warm porch light gently illuminates the entrance. Moths frantically fly around the light, casting monstrous shadows on the wall. The sky is a calming gradient of deep blue, purple, and dark pink.

  I let the tips of my boots hang off the porch and take a few deep breaths, watching it float out in front of me in silver clouds, slowly dissipating after a few seconds.

  The taillights of the truck make the exhaust appear red as it floats away from the pipe.

  *Another day, alive and healthy.*

  I step into Dad’s white 2001 Chevrolet Silverado. The dashboard is lit in green and blue lights, and the heater is at full blast.

  The interior lights emphasize the sun-bleached streaks in Dad’s hair. He takes a sip of coffee from his thermos with the “Don’t Tread on Me” flag engraved into the steel. I got it for him last Christmas. I knew it would be a perfect gift. He puts the truck in gear and starts driving.

  As we’re going down the road, he looks over at me, speaking in his charming Texas accent, “So, why were you up at three in the morning scrolling through the news?”

  “Just had a weird dream and thought I’d stay up,” I say, repressing the urge to unload my mind.

  “Honey,” he says softly, glancing into the rearview mirror, “you can tell me anything. You know that, don’t you?”

  *What do I say? We all have secrets, right?*

  “I don’t know, Dad. Everything seems so different lately.”

  “Yeah,” he sighs, clenching his jaw. “I did not see this coming either.”

  I wonder about Mom. Mary Bwen Ledger. Dad has scarcely mentioned her name anymore. I stopped talking about her years ago because, when I do, the grief washes over his face all over again.

  *I have to mention her. I want to keep her alive, not just a memory.*

  My throat tightens. “I—I wonder what Mom would think right now.”

  He grips the steering wheel tighter, biting his lip. He just nods, not saying anything. There is nothing to say. The silence lingers between us, carrying our grief. Something breaks inside of me—for both of us. Barely noticeable tears run down his cheek.

  My world shattered with a single phone call.

  \*\*\*\*\*\*

  The phone rings while I’m completing some homework problems. Dad leans his elbows on the kitchen island, answering emails for work.

  “Can you get that, Lainey?” he says, the blue light from the computer reflecting fragments of the screen into his glasses.

  “Sure,” I say, lowering myself down from the chair.

  “Hello?”

  “This is Knoxville Police Dispatch. Is your father Wes Ledger?” an unfamiliar voice answers.

  My heart pounds harder in my chest. Something’s wrong.

  “Um—he—he is.”

  “May we speak with him?”

  I tap Dad on the shoulder, giving him the phone.

  He clears his throat. “Hello?”

  Voices whisper from the other end, but I can’t make out the words they are saying.

  His hands are shaking as he holds the phone. Then it plummets to the floor and he gets up quickly. “Lainey, we have to go. Your mom has been in a bad car wreck,” his voice rattles with each word.

  *What?*

  \*\*\*\*\*\*

  It happened so fast. Everything. The things that matter most to you are ripped away with no warning.

  I rub my eyes and look back up at the road, taking a sip of coffee. Dad reaches over, squeezing my hand.

  He knows how I feel. It is just too much to put into words.

  Rain starts tapping against the windshield, streaming down my window. I reach for my phone, pulling it out of my jacket, scrolling through my contacts until I stop at “Mom.”

  Phone number: 865-378-0981

  The phone icon at the top right corner of the screen stands out to me. I want to call her, but she will not answer.

  What I would give to talk to her right now. To tell her how much I love her.

  Click. Call.

  I slip it back into my pocket, feeling it vibrate through me. Then hang it up.

  Dad’s eyes flicker over.

  “Lainey,” his voice cracks and he swallows, “I do that too. I do that too.”

  The dotted white lines along the road blur into each other, taillights and headlights reflect into the raindrops, creating colorful streaks on the glass.

  A sign stands amidst the wet parking lot of a closed clinic. It is lit up, reflecting into the wet puddles on the pavement. The large lettering reads, “FREE Novira-26 Vaccination + $20.”

  “Ever since President Kessler announced Operation Warp Speed, they have given this out like candy. And to my knowledge, without proper testing too,” Dad says, looking over to the sign.

  The sign looks a bit *too cheerful*. Maybe the way it is lit up. I don’t know what it is about it, but it sends a chill down my spine.

  “Yeah,” I whisper, looking down from the window. “Nobody at my school has actually gotten really sick, just the common cold and flu.”

  “Makes me wonder,” Dad says, looking in the right mirror of the car back at the sign.

  \*\*\*\*\*\*

  We pull up to Linden High School, where I attend junior year. Kids are running with their hoods over their heads to get out of the rain and freezing wind. He pulls into a parking space and shifts the truck into park.

  He shifts in his seat, looking over at me, his eyes tinged with grief. “Be careful. I can’t lose you, too.”

  “You better stick around too,” I sniffle, trying to lighten the mood.

  They say time heals all wounds, but does it?

  “Love you, Dad,” I step out, pulling my heavy backpack from the floorboard, burdened with books.

  As I’m walking away, I stop, standing in the downpour, looking behind me. The truck sits there in the parking lot for a few seconds before it drives away, catching up with the red and white streaks of traffic blurring by.

  A piece of me goes with it.

  Maybe it’s just the bruise of loss.

  I don’t put my hood on my head. My wet hair sticks to my face, as drops run off of my lashes into the crevices of my lips.

  Everything is a blur around me. I’m not sure if it is the tears in my eyes or the rain. Kids scramble through the parking lot all around me as I stand there.

  The rain feels as if it belongs to me. 

Sometimes you need to be rained on to know how good the sunshine is.

  A burnt orange Kia pulls beside me and the window rolls down, revealing a blonde woman in her 40s. “You okay!?” she yells through the rain. “Do you need a ride!?”

  *I probably look crazy standing out here alone in the rain. I don’t care.*

  “No—no thank you!” I yell back, starting to run towards the doors.

  Walking in school feels like walking into a foreign land—dark, unknown, but somehow familiar. All the weird glances prick me like a thousand needles.

  *There she is. The girl who thinks everything is a Psy-Op.* I can hear it now. I can’t hear their whispers, but I feel their words—their intentions.

  *I’m not insane. I don’t care what they think.*

  “Lainey!” a familiar voice sounds through the chaos.

  She breaks through the crowd, wrapping her warm arms around me. Her hug offers an escape from reality.

  “Hey, Tessa,” I sigh, trying to surface a smile.

  “You are soaked. You okay?” she scans me, her green eyes stopping on mine.

  “Mmm-mm,” I gently nod. “Just had a rough morning.”

  My eyes are a little watery from a spiral of emotions. I carry myself to Algebra II class and sit next to Tessa. She leans forward, resting her head on her forearms, her wavy blonde hair concealing her face.

  Everything the teacher says just comes in as background noise. Zoning out of the world offers time to let my mind breathe.

  “Ms. Ledger? Can you come to the board and solve this word problem?” Mrs. Wize says.

  She carries an odd smirk across her face, like she is trying to prove something.

  “Umm, sure.” The chair screeches against the tile floor as I push it back, making the class break out in muffled giggles.

  I ignore them and approach the whiteboard, barely seeing my reflection in it. I glance toward the class for one second and then back to the word problem.

  My whole body is frozen. Thinking.

  Faint laughter comes from the class. They all lean back in their chairs, confident that I will fail.

  “It takes four seconds for the ball to hit the ground. Once it does, it bounces back up at 25% of its original height, making the second bounce go up by 200 feet,” I say, slowly turning around to the class, staring Mrs. Wize right in the eyes.

  Suddenly everything goes silent, then a boy shoots up with his hand on his desk. “She is cheating!” His voice echoes through the room. Then he starts to laugh a little, “She got a hold of the homework or something. There is just no way—”

  “That I could do this in my head?” I say, stopping him mid-sentence.

  “No,” he pauses. “There isn’t.”

  I walk closer to him, then lean over his desk. His eyes grow in his head the closer I get. “First of all, *Jason,*” I say, just loud enough for everyone to hear. “I have not gotten into the homework, and that is a ridiculous assumption. Second, what are the chances that I would even remember the answer?” My voice gets more intimidating. “Third, why not be proud of *your* classmate instead of thrusting *your* insecurities on someone else?”

  *Jason was never like this. He’s been—off in the last couple of weeks.*

  Nobody has the courage to look me in the eye. I don’t care. I don’t like being looked at anyways.

  I lower myself back into my chair next to Tessa, leaning my head back and taking a deep breath.

  “You did amazing, Lain,” she whispers.

  “Just not dealing with nonsense today, I guess,” I sigh, keeping my eyes closed.

  \*\*\*\*\*\*

  As we’re leaving class, Jason almost trips, then stands there for a second taking a breath.

  “You okay, Jay?” one of his buddies asks, patting him on the back.

  “Fine,” he swallows, pivoting toward the bathroom.

  A tinge of guilt weaves itself into my heart.

  *I should not have been that harsh on him.*

  “I will be right back, Tessa. Need to talk with Jason,” I say, leaving her side.

  I stand by the men’s bathroom, knocking on the door. “Jason!”

  Nothing.

  Knocking like this reminds me of my dream. A shiver runs down my spine, expanding through my body.

  “Jay!”

  I step through the door. “Jason?” My throat tightens with each word.",0,1753126909.0,writing,0,0.5,False

1m5sr54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1m5sr54/the_cleanser/,The Cleanser.,"It always starts with the smell.

Piss. Blood. Grease. Desperation.

Guttervale isn’t a city. It’s a landfill that learned how to walk and vomit politics. Somewhere between failed gentrification and successful corruption, the soul of this place rotted.

That’s where I come in.

They call me The Cleanser. I don’t wear a cape. I wear Kevlar soaked in motor oil and grief. I carry two carbon-steel batons, serrated edges, and a claw for peeling off fingernails. My mask is white. Expressionless. People say it’s worse than a skull.

Because when you see it, you know your sins have been tallied.

And I’m the receipt.


---

The first night I went out, I found a man gut-punching a woman in an alley. She couldn’t scream. He’d already broken her jaw. She was sobbing, trying to crawl backward over wet pavement. His pants were halfway down.

I broke both his kneecaps in one swing.

I didn’t stop there.

My baton shattered his ribs like dry twigs. I caved in his orbital bone until it sank like dough. He made wet gurgling sounds.

“Stop!” she screamed. “You’ll kill him!”

I looked at her. “Exactly.”

And I did.

She screamed again, not for him—for me.


---

I'm not insane.

That’s important. I’ve read the files. Psychopaths can’t feel guilt. Sociopaths can’t feel empathy.

I feel both.

That’s why I do what I do.

I have rules:

1. Only the guilty.


2. Only when proof is absolute.


3. No innocents.


4. Pain is mandatory. Death is optional.



I research my targets. I track them. I listen to their conversations, their phones, their private texts. I gather evidence more obsessively than the police ever did.

Then I knock on their door with blood on my gloves.

And I don't leave until it's clean.


---

There’s a whiteboard in my bunker. I call it the Scum List.

Right now, it has seven names:

Councilman Derrek Vaughn – Human trafficking. Likes them underage.

Detective Lisa Horne – Buries rape kits. Accepts bribes from pimps.

Dr. Kenneth Malk – Sells opioids disguised as insulin. Six people dead.

Brutus “Cage Dog” Kelm – Dogfighting ring. Burned a kennel alive.

Milo Vonn – Live-streams women being tortured. Pays in Bitcoin.

Judge Mathers – Let a child killer walk. Twice.

Bishop Jude – Molests orphans. Baptizes them after.


Each one has a red dot.

Each one has a date.

Tonight: Malk.


---

Dr. Kenneth Malk lives in a gated mansion. Marble lions. Pool lit like a hotel. No security. He doesn’t need it. He owns the cops. Owns the courts. Owns the news.

He doesn’t own me.

I break in through the back, using a suppressed bolt cutter. No alarms. He’s in his study, watching sports highlights and sipping brandy.

I walk in.

He turns. “Who the hell—”

My baton hits his collarbone with a CRACK.

He crumples.

I zip-tie him to the fireplace grate. Pull the photos from my coat. The six people who died from his falsified prescriptions. One of them is a ten-year-old girl named Lily Rass.

“You remember her?” I growl.

“I didn’t— It wasn’t me—”

I hold up a scalpel. “You’re a doctor. Let’s see how you like malpractice.”

I don’t kill him immediately.

I remove his thumbs first.


---


Two days later, I’m ambushed.

Three masked men. Ex-military. Professional. They wait in my safehouse. I open the fridge, and one of them puts a gun to my head.

“You’ve made enemies,” he says.

I spin. Gun goes off. Misses.

My elbow breaks his jaw. I sweep the second’s legs, bash his skull against the counter. Third lunges—taser. I take the hit.

I drop.

They beat me.

Not enough to kill.

Enough to warn.

When I wake up, I’m zip-tied, blood in my mouth. A phone sits next to me, blinking.

A video plays. It’s a girl. Tied up. Crying.

A voice: “Stop, or she dies.”

I know her.

Lily Rass’s sister.


---


I don’t stop.

I double down.

First, I find the mercenaries. I kill two. Leave the third alive.

Tied naked to a tree.

With his eyelids stapled open.

The girl? Rescued. The gang behind it? Slaughtered in an auto shop.

I leave the walls painted with their names. “I SAW YOU. I CLEANED YOU.”

The media loses its mind.

They call me a terrorist.

I don’t care.

Justice doesn’t need a PR team.


---



Councilman Derrek Vaughn lives in a penthouse guarded by private ex-Navy SEALs.

He traffics girls through a fake youth shelter called “SafeNest.”

I find the files. The shipping records. The payments.

He even has cameras installed.

I download everything.

I go in through the elevator shaft, silent as death. I lace his guards’ coffee with ketamine the day before. They sleep like babies.

I find Derrek in a jacuzzi, snorting coke off a hooker’s back.

He blinks up at me. “Do I know you?”

“No. But I know what you’ve done.”

He tries to run.

I shoot him in the leg.

He screams. Blood in the bubbles.


---

I don’t just kill him.

I tie him to the top of the Guttervale Monument, naked, bleeding, every bone in his fingers broken.

A USB drive in his mouth.

Inside? Every girl he trafficked. Every name. Every account.

I send copies to every journalist who still has a soul.

Next morning, the city’s on fire.

Protests. Riots. Investigations.

Some say I went too far.

Others say I didn’t go far enough.

I say: I’m not done.


---



She’s been hunting me. The irony.

Detective Lisa Horne. Ten years on the force. Public darling. Secret monster.

I track her to a warehouse near the harbor. It’s where she stores the evidence she “forgets” to file. Including 67 untested rape kits.

I wait.

She comes in alone, thinking it’s safe.

I lock the doors.

“Who’s there?!”

Lights go out.

I whisper through the darkness: “I’m your paperwork.”

She fires wildly. I move between shadows.

She reloads.

I’m already behind her.

My baton crushes her spine.

She screams as she falls, paralyzed.

I tie her to the kits.

Douse them in gasoline.

I hand her a lighter.

“Burn them, or I burn you.”

She does.


---



Eventually, they find me.

Military-grade hit squad. No insignias.

They come in the night. Not to kill. To erase.

They take me.

Black bag over my head. Drugged. Shackled.

When I wake up, I’m underground. Cold steel room. No exits.

A man in a suit stands in the shadows.

“You’re effective,” he says.

I stay silent.

“We don’t like you. But we could use you.”

He smiles like a knife.

“You become ours. Or you disappear.”

I spit at his feet.

He wipes his shoe.

“Then you’re just another mess to clean.”


---


They underestimated me.

Big mistake.

I break my thumb. Slip the shackle. Strangle a guard with my chain.

Gunshots. Sirens.

I fight like I was born in a blender. I lose two fingers. Break three ribs.

I still get out.

The suit? I drag him with me.

When the media finds his body, it’s nailed to a courthouse door.

A new word carved into his chest:

“UNFORGIVEN.”


---


I don’t know how long I can keep doing this.

My bones ache. My mind frays. Every night I hear screams—some from others, some from myself.

But I can’t stop.

Because they won’t stop.

Because the system doesn’t break—it adapts.

Corruption wears new clothes. Old demons learn new tricks.

So I evolve too.

Harder.

Meaner.

Darker.

I am not hope.

I am not light.

I am the scream at 3 a.m. in a guilty man’s ear.
I am justice with no paperwork.
I am the last thing filth sees before it dies.

I am The Cleanser.

And I will not be washed away.

I have a 2023 Ibex 19MSB, I have installed 600w of solar with plans for another 200w, 460Ah LiFePO4 of batteries, and a factory installed WFCO 5220, 2000w inverter.  The inverter has a 30A pass through and currently only runs outlets when boondocking, when plugged into shore power it passes through shore power to the outlets.  The only power I ever really use from the outlets is the Keurig coffee maker and occasional space heater.

I recently replaced the Furrion Chill HE with a Furrion Chill Cube 18k.  I would like to hook up the air conditioner through the inverter for occasional road side use. It would be nice on long summer trips to pull over, fire up the A/C and enjoy a nice lunch or a quick nap.  I know the inverter is capable of running the new Chill Cube as the power consumption is very low and can be made to run lower 50% of max eco mode.

My question is, should I just remove the A/C power from the back of the converter and hook it up the the inverter output?  With the pass through on the inverter that should still allow for the A/C to run off shore power as well, Right?",1,1753126749.0,GoRVing,0,1.0,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

A lot has been going through my mind about self-confidence, weight loss, appearance, and mental health. Because of that, I wanted to write this post talking about what I am doing and will be doing and I would really appreciate any feedback, tips and tricks, and your personal experiences as well.

I am a **23** year old man, **5 foot 7 inches in height**, and **230 lbs in weight**. Not at all happy with the way I look. I used to skinny as a child and my weight always fluctuated but in the past few years, I have not gone below 210 lbs. I'm at a point in life where the self realizations have hit that I need to get it together. I struggle a lot with self-confidence issues and am always hyper-focused on how I appear. The classic shirt tugging, then keep checking the pictures you click to see if your chest doesn't appear to be big. Nothing wrong with that of course but it brings me down a lot. I'm in my summer break right now and it has taught me a lot in many areas in my life.

My **goal** is to reach **190 lbs**. After that, whether I want to continue or start body building, can't think about unless I achieve what I really want now.

I've made some **small changes** which I would like to share. For the past 6 days, I've been going to the gym. First 4 days, all I did was 15 minutes of treadmill, 3 miles per hour and 12 incline. I would feel like fainting after just those 15 minutes. Then, Saturday, I went to walk in the morning on this trail. Its located literally right next to where I live so it was easy to push myself to go. I walked around 4.2 miles in total. Not sure how many steps that was, I should have been using an app or something. Then, last night, I went to the gym and was able to be on the treadmill for 30 minutes. Granted, I raised the incline slowly this time but I was able to burn more calories so it felt really good. Legs felt horrible around the 15 minute mark but then I didn't feel any discomfort after that. I was kind of surprised. Not sure what that was. Also, I read another post about walking 20k steps per day. I might have the ability to do that some times a week so I actually might create like a 100k steps per week goal. What do you guys think of that?

**Entertainment** wise, I've been listening to songs and podcasts during my gym/walk time. I really want to get into interesting history or politics so if anybody has any recommendations, let me know!

**Food** wise, I've been roughly measuring my calorie intake. Right now, I average about 1800 calories per day. my BMR is 2000 calories per day. Do you guys think that is good enough? I'm a vegetarian (+eggs). I'm Indian so I cook Indian food at home. Mornings are either cereal or coffee with some Belvita cookies. Snacks might include low sodium chips or protein bars. Dinner and lunch is something Indian. If I order from outside, it might be the chipotle veggie bowl or the veggie wrap from chick-fil-a.

**Appearance** wise, I've observed a few things this past year and got some suggestions. One is to have either slightly unkempt hair but very well maintained beard or the opposite. I like to not touch my beard and let it be the way it is so I want to focus on my hair. Ordered a pomade to get it to look the way I want it to. Not sure though. Also, I used to hate the idea of accessorizing yourself with rings, necklaces, etc. But, as I've gotten older, my mind has sort of shifted. I'm getting more in tune with my family's religion (Sikh) as well and my mom has actually told me ways I could do that. Three things I'm doing is, a ring, a sikh necklace, and a sikh kara (bracelet). I have one and the others, I'll be getting soon.

All of this thinking has actually made me a bit more productive in work as well. I would love to hear everyone's stories so I can learn more and if you guys have been feedback or tips, please do share. Peace and love.",4,1753126575.0,loseit,1,1.0,False

I’ve always dreamed of having a little space like this — something between a journal, a cozy corner of a bookshop, and a coffee date with a best friend. So here it is.  a soft place for my thoughts, my routines, and all the lovely (and sometimes messy) little things that make up my life.

I'm the kind of girl who reads *Pride and Prejudice* and then rewatches *The Dark Knight*, who wears glowy blush to the gym, who cries over the *R*ed Wedding, and still squeals every time I see a good Nightwing edit on Instagram.

I don’t want this to be a place for perfection. Just peace. The kind you feel when your skin is clean, your book is good, your playlist is vibing, and you feel at home in yourself.

Welcome to my World💖  
Love always,

Finding Grace

Not really remembering anything from before, Before, a dark raven haired Latina, brown eyed girl named Jenna Ortega’ had awakened into a world in which she would now find herself. Living in a world now where she see meets people that have since passed. But from within her new world that she now lives in, along with the people that she meets along the way. While riding her bike discovering new trails that would show her a life that was once hers. 

From waking up to looking out her window into a world that was still very new to her,  while still giving her the feeling of that she has always been here. With anticipation of what was about to be, Jenna’ a very outgoing dark haired girl! That very much knew how to handle things that would come her way. 

While at the same time meeting new people along the way while finding herself coming closer to some in her life. But as Jenna’ would quickly get dressed, anticipating what the day may bring her. Wearing a black tee and a pair of cut at the knees jeans! Not forgetting about her shoes that just fit her personality that she was to everyone around her. 

A girl that wasn’t afraid to express herself! While at the same time excepting a challenge! From anyone that wanted to race her! With her showing them what was! While at the same time! Finding herself coming closer to others! Knowing that the world around her was changing every day seeing and meeting new people along the way. While at the same time! Finding out that some people around her had many stories of their own to share. Finding herself coming close to some! Whether it was as a friend! or like family to her! 

But as Jenna’ quickly got dressed! Grabbing her bike and on her way she went! Not looking back! But only ahead! Ahead to what was to be! As she was now finding herself. Looking out onto a bustling street in front of her, Jenna’ was going to let nothing stand in her way! From doing this run! A run that she had a done dozens of times before. For just as the morning’s sun was making its way into a new day. A new day for her! For everything seemed new to Jenna’

In a way that was just unexplainable to her! For it felt like she had always been here, lived here! And was born here. But unknowingly to her at the moment, the days ahead would show her different paths. Paths that would take her to slowly finding out who she was. For as sat there on her bike, looking down a street just in front of her was that long all downhill from there. But the need to race! The need for speed was there! And she here now and ready for her run.

With her not always having the feeling of really not knowing on how or why she was here. But in a way she felt that she had always been here, but with her having that feeling in her that something felt different about her. Different in a way that no one could describe, but she only knew where she was at the moment! only knowing the moment! 

For this morning was hers, nothing was going to stop her from breaking her prior tries before. Taking one last look around her, just before letting it all go! Feeling the wind push up against her! Speeding in and around cars along the way!

With the feeling of something just being different about still residing within her, more so than usually toady. With the feeling that all of this still felt very new to her! The surroundings! The people! Everything thing about the place. But while everything seemed new to her! It still felt like she belonged here! That she had always been here.

Jenna’ was a young outgoing girl just shy of her 23rd birthday. Growing up in a small town that had a big city feel to it to her. But to Jenna’ it was her home, but she liked to think of it as a sprawling city that one day she would riding her bike through the downtown streets. 

Weaving in and around cars passing by them as the wind blew through her long Raven hair! feeling free from the world around her! Racing was her excitement! And it showed! With her smile saying it all. Making her way through the towns traffic passing by people with some waving as she passed them by.

With Jenna’ having the feeling of nothing could stop her from trying her best to break her speed time Pryor to each day.  Often finding herself at the other end of the local law enforcement, as officer Cross’ would many times say to her

“Jenna’! Now don’t make me write you a ticket today for speeding!” 

As he would always say laughingly to her. mainly it was just him watching out for her! For her own safety.  But Jenna’ also had someone else watching out for her! A young latino! Named Hector’! With his dark hair brown eyes, And a smile For Jenna’! But Jenna’ was just your typical young brown eyed girl! Who liked her shredded jeans and tee shirt and hoodie living her life! Her way. 

Occasionally finding some of the local boys racing with her trying to out do one another. With Jenna’ being the girl that she was! Never backing down from a challenge, finding herself racing through the towns streets, finding herself racing along with one or two others.

Not to say that one of them didn’t catch her eye, But! From time to time, Hector’ very much would catch her eye, for he was the kinda guy that could charm on a dime. A Latino, Who had a keen mind and the street smarts to match! Especially on a bike. Often calling out to Jenna’ saying to her.

“So you think you’re fast huh! Well maybe we can just find out just how fast you can go!”

But at the same time finding himself racing along side of Jenna’ Whether it be on the streets or on one of many mountain trails that surrounded them. Knowing that each had feelings for the other, but never really acting on it. Knowing that Jenna’ was a well to do girl, often finding himself with Jenna’ leaving him with a glance and a smile! as Jenna’ left him looking. And saying to himself “Dam! That’s my girl!”

Just way the way he liked it! Always watching out for her. While Jenna’ didn’t have many people in her life or let many get close to her, Hector was different! 

Leaving everyone she met with a smile she was a girl with a slim build standing at around five foot and four inches. Gliding her way through the traffic imagining as if she was racing through the downtown streets of San Francisco. Often finding herself riding her bike for the bike was her life her way of escape. She even had a name for her bike often calling it ‘Quicksilver’ riding her bike faster and farther each day. Finding new trails along the way but with each new trail she would ride. It was like it was showing something to her! As if it was trying to tell her something! 

But with each new day bringing something new to her! A new trial, a new street to ride on, and occasionally a new person.

Finding herself Occasionally stopping by the local bike shop finding herself talking to Jack’ for jack was like a big brother to her. One who also knew himself very well on a bike, Jenna’ would often find herself talking to listening to Jack tell her all about his days in the big city. Telling Jrnna’ about his own street races, with Jenna’ always enjoying there talks whenever she was in his shop.

For whenever she was on her bike she felt faster than anyone around her and that there was nothing that she could not do on that bike. One street in particular had a steep incline to it for the street itself was not very long but long enough for what Jenna’ needed it be. 

For it gave her enough speed that it felt as if she could go on forever! Dodging in and out of traffic! But always avoiding the people as she would often came onto the sidewalk bringing a lot of speed passing people as they made their way. 

Sometimes she would dream as if she was riding her bike through the streets of San Francisco or New York. But Life for Jenna’ was here in her hometown it was often just a carefree life for her. More than often finding herself thinking about her life! For oddly enough it just did not feel like it was her life! It felt as if she was living someone else’s life other than her own. 

For many times while riding on one of the many trials outside of town. She would often find herself on a different trail, a trail Leading her to new areas, to new adventures, as if it was showing her thoughts. Thoughts that wasn’t her thoughts, that was as if they belonged to someone else. It was as if she was seeing things as someone else’s was seeing them! 

But for now life for her was just her and her bike the one possession in her life that she most often cared for the most. Making her way through the streets making her way the local coffee shop where she worked. A Coffee Shop, That was owned by Hector’s father.

Also named Hector’ She would also find herself taking with him not only about bikes! But also about different things in general. With one! Being of his son Hector’ for Jenna” very much had a crush on him! Often finding herself dreaming of not only Hector’ but a life being on her own! Making her own way in life on her bike.

Just as a regular would walk in as he often would, setting down to enjoy his morning cup of joe. A regular, who was named Voodoo’ Lawrence Fishburne,or at least his friends would call him that. Often finding himself talking to Jenna Ortega’ telling Jenna’ about his own little bike rides. When he was a bike rider from the city! A regular that Jenna’ came know from their talks at the coffee shop.

For Voodoo’ would often tell Jenna’ about his many adventures aboard and local, telling her that even though there were many great locations about. That there was none like our very own town that we had here, for the many great nights he had here in the mountains when he was younger. Jenna’ always enjoyed there talks often telling him about her own little adventures in the mountains.

But oddly enough whenever Voodoo’ would talk about the town that they were in, that he would say that this is where I wanted to be buried. That For all of his many travels to many different places, seeing all that he had seen! That in the end that this was his home! This was where he wanted his final resting place to be.

For often Jenna’ would find herself in the mountains just outside of the town riding her bike on some of its many trails one particular. A trial that she would often ride a trial where she was at the moment making her way through it. Gliding past the trees catching glimpses of the sun as its light glimmered through the trees around her.

It was a warm day as she could feel and see the nature of the forest all around her with nothing but blue sky ahead of her. Approaching the place where she would often come. Jenna’ would find herself setting there on her bike overlooking a ravine where in the distance she could see the town in which she had grew up in. 

She would often refer to it as Angels Ravine, For to anyone standing there could look as if they were looking out into a dream. A Ravine that seemed to go on forever over into the valley ahead. It was almost as if you was an Angel looking out from Heaven itself it was a quit place it was her place. Often finding herself there where she would come to often

But just on the other side of Angels Ravine, was a mountain trail that many bikers dared not to challenge. But not Jenna’ for she knew one day that she would conquer that path, but unknowingly at the time. She would find herself with Hector and others in a challenge that they would never forget. Finding herself there on many occasions just to relax, to think about her life! Thinking about her life growing up for she didn’t have any family or many friends. Or at least any that she could remember. 

And the few she had, had moved away after High school whether it was for college or just Life itself. But a couple of people who she find herself talking to or occasionally racing against here in the city streets. Or on one of the many trails that was on the outskirts of town, Jenna’ found that life for her was there in the mountains along with her bike.

But as the day grew long with Jenna’ setting there on the ledge looking down into the ravine below her Knowing that she should be heading back. For the darkness never really bothered her for she had many times ridden back in the dark under a nights sky. 

For Jenna’ loved riding at night under a starlit sky above her for being alone with nothing but her and stars in the sky. For she knew the area really well and enjoyed its peace that it brought to her but also kept a light on her. that she could attach to the front of her bike as she rode through the trails she could feel nothing but a somber feeling all over her. But as the nights cool breeze blew against her sending feelings of thoughts that would sometimes come over her. 

Thoughts that oddly enough did not feel like her thoughts, thoughts that often would feel like they belonged to someone else’s. Finding herself later that night after arriving back at her apartment the rain had just begun to fall standing there in the rain. Thinking to herself a thought that would often come to her 

“If I am not me then who am I “

A thought that she often would find herself thinking about but always keeping them to herself. While also thinking to herself who else would she tell for oddly enough it seemed that it was just only her. Having no family at least none that she ever knew of it for it had always just been her by herself.

With only the people around her that was already there making her way inside setting down into her cozy little chair. There she would set listening to the rain falling just outside as it came down. Setting there thinking as she would often do about her life then slowly as she would began to fall asleep listening to the rain. Just as a dream would come to her. 

A dream that she would often have a dream that she would often find herself thinking about a lot. Thinking was this her life? But as she dreamed a girl she could see a girl that looked identical to her as if she was her sister her twin but in another Life. 

Always being the same girl but in different places but never where Jenna’ was! Never in the same town that she had grew up in. In the dream the girl never acknowledged her or even looked at her as if she was seeing another girls life as if it was her Life. But as the dreams would come they would go,

 Waking up in the chair that she would often find herself fallen asleep in looking out of the window into the suns morning light.

Thinking to herself 

“Why am I seeing this other girl? If I am me then who is she?”

Walking over to the window looking out into a sun filled day, looking at people as they would pass by. Some she knew, while others being new to the area! Standing there thinking if any of these people could be who they are! Could they be of someone else from somewhere else!

Thinking back on her time here, thinking back on her job, though she remembers working there. But she couldn’t remember when she first started there! It was like she had always been there! Just then realizing that she was late for work. Forgoing the morning shower slipping into her work clothes Jenna’ rushed out of her front door grabbing her bike on the way. knowing that speed was going to be her best friend this morning. 

Making her way through the streets the only way she knew weaving in out of the traffic occasionally hearing the honking of a car horn. throwing their hand up ether by saying a hello or to just watch where you are going. To Jenna’ that was her Life! Being on her bike loosing herself in the world around her! Racing as the wind blowing up against her making her way through the town. For today was going to be a good day not only at work seeing not only the Locals coming in giving a smile to people from all over. 

People who was either just passing through or in town for the it’s many mountain trails. Finding herself telling passerby’s of many of her own mountain adventures. For after her shift at the coffee house was over Jenna’ herself was then going to head back out to Angels Ravine for Angels Ravine was what Grace would refer to it by.

For it was to her of what Heaven would be like, for it was her own little piece of Heaven. But this time she was not only planning on just a day trip but on spending the night there. Surprisingly as her work day would go much faster than normal having only a few customers here and there. With excitement grabbing her bike leaving her work day behind her headed for the door she couldn’t wait for to her getting there was half the fun. 

Riding her bike out of town it was only a couple of miles down the road to where the trial leading up to Angels Ravine was. It was a warm afternoon as always Grace enjoyed the ride hearing the sounds of nature all around her. With the occasional breeze that would make its way through the trees. normally she would be trying to best her own speed trying to best herself. 

But this time was different this day would be different, for a couple of days back a group of outsiders. A group that Jenna’ had not seen in the area before, a group of young cocky bike riders. Had challenged Jenna’ and Hector to a race, but not just any race but a race down the other side of Angels Ravine.

With Jenna’ and Hector arriving at the site first finding themselves setting there looking out over Angels Ravine. Setting there just enjoying the moment together talking about their time in the town together. The times that they had racing one another through the streets, coming up here to mountains. Setting there on Angel’s Ravine looking out over into the Ravine just ahead of them Jenna’ then turned to Hector asking him

“Do you ever think that you was someone else’s before”

With a puzzled look on Hector’s face he then replied back to her saying 

“Someone Else’s! No! What kind of question is that? Jenna’ are you feeling okay!”

With smiling to him just as she said 

“It’s just! I really don’t know! It’s like I’m or was someone else, I can’t really explain it.”

With Hector giving a laugh as he said to her

“I don’t know what I would do with two Jenna’s All I know is how I feel about the Jenna’ that is here now, setting here beside of me.”

With Jenna’ then giving him a smile just she then placed her head his shoulder saying to him

“I don’t know what I would do another me either! I can barely handle myself at times”

With Hector placing his arms around Jenna’ before telling her

“I Don’t think I could handle another you either! laughing, I just know that I am holding the one Jenna’ that I want to be with.”

Giving each other a smile as they set there looking out into what could be there future ahead.

But just before they could get lost in the moment again, the other group had arrived.

They had arrived ready to show their dominance on the mountain, but with Jenna’ and Hector ready eager to show them other wise. 

The challenge was underway with Hector taking the lead first going down the steep incline, quickly followed by the outsiders, with Jenna’ trailing but was soon to catch up. 

The trail was daunting with very steep inclines, as they raced along the mountain trail. But just as Hector was out in front one of the outsiders came up from behind him. Running purposefully close to him knocking him off balance sending him crashing off the trail. 

With Jenna’ then stopping to check on him as Hector’ then motioned to her saying to her

“Go! Go get ‘em Jenna! You got this!”

And with that it wasn’t too long before Jenna’ had caught up to them, for Jenna’ knew the trails like no other. 

Racing hard and fast to the finish side by side! Just as Jenna’ then gave him a look and smile to the outsider as she then pulled away. just the outsider went flying off of the trail! Leaving him setting there as Jenna’ had won the race.

Later that evening Jenna’ and Hector’ would spend the evening together, talking to each other. Talking about what may be store in the future for them as Hector then slowly looked to Jenna’ just before giving her a kiss.

With Hector’ then saying goodbye to Jenna’ as he then headed back to town leaving Jenna’ there for the night.

As she came to the ravine Jenna’ then found herself setting down on the ledge looking out over the valley over across the mountains ahead. Thinking to herself that this was Heaven at least what Heaven would be like to her. After setting up her camp for the night setting down again looking out into the sunset as its light shined down onto the valley out into the town below. For many sunrise and sunsets Jenna’ had watched from there. 

But this one was different in a way that she could not describe with only a few words but just looking out into it. It was if time itself was coming to an end. 

Looking back down unto the town as the light of the sun shown down on it Jenna’ began to think to think back on her Life wondering to herself if she had a family out there somewhere. 

Wondering that if she did have a family what would her family be like? What was her childhood like? 

For as far back Jenna’’ could remember she had no family. For growing up all she could remember was that one morning she just woke up being in a place with the town and the people around her. But not as her family just people in her life a life that has seemingly went by all too fast. With the sun now slowly setting behind the mountains ahead of her.

Jenna’ would set there enjoying it as the last of its light would slowly disappear behind the mountains as the first star of the night would appear over head. Feeling a cool breeze starting to set in as Jenna’ lay there in her sleeping bag looking up into the starlit sky that was adorned above her. lying there just simply enjoying a nice quite night but as sleep would find her. 

The same dream the same dream that Jenna’ had so many times before. With the same girl the girl that Jenna’ would refer to her as her identical sister from what seemed to be from another Life. 

Living her life but not the same as her for everything around her was different, different in the way she had lived before! Before the town that she lived in now! But this time something happened that had never happened before. A name was said that had never been said before in the dream and that was name of the girl in her dreams someone then called her Jenna’

Suddenly waking up to the morning’s light putting her hands up to her head Jenna’ just set there stunned. Thinking to herself

“Who was this other Jenna’ And why do I keep seeing her?”

Feeling how real the dream was for her, unlike the others that dream actually seemed as if I was there! I was her! 

Still visibly shaken as Jenna’ just sat there looking around suddenly startled by a presence. 

With the presence being of a man standing there just outside of the tree line standing there looking at her. But Just before Jenna’ began to scream! A calmness suddenly came over her a feeling of something telling her that everything was alright. Just as the man spoke saying

 “Hello Jenna’ it is a pleasure to meet you so please do not be alarmed. For I am not here to harm you” 

With a feeling of relief coming over Jenna’ as Jenna’ then replied saying to himself

“Then why are you standing there looking at me! And how do you know my name?” 

“I know all about you Jenna’ I know your entire Life up until now. And I know the answer that you seek” 

With Jenna’ then replying 

“Answers to what? What answers do I seek” 

“ Dreams, Jenna’ your dreams.” 

As Jenna’ just set there still stunned now more curious then ever Jenna’ just suddenly shouted out the girl! Who was the girl in my dreams? 

The man then just smiled and simply said that 

“It is you Jenna’ and it is not you”

More confused then ever Jenna’ just replied by saying 

“Me! How” 

Just as the man then slowly approached Jenna’ standing there looking out into the valley below as he then said to her. 

“ In your Life you was you, and she was her in her Life.”

“But now in this Life you are her and she is not! and you are not. For her Life is her Life! For the Life that was once you is a Life that is no longer your Life” 

with Jenna’ then replying 

“Is this Heaven then and are you an Angel?” 

With a smile the man just simply said 

“ I am who I am! someone that is there, someone that knows. And no this is not Heaven! This is your Heaven Jenna’ And this is your Life the Life that you ask for” 

just as the man then slowly made his way back to the tree line. He then turned and said to Jenna’

 “The dreams shall now end, and your dreams shall begin.” 

“For do not look at what was then, just look at what is now! But look for what is to come!  for Life itself is the most precious thing that a person can have!”

“Now go and Live your Life Jenna’ for Life is what has been granted to you” 

Just then as the mysterious man then disappeared into the tree line never again to be seen by Jenna’ was now standing there looking out over Angels Ravine, Jenna’ couldn’t help but to feel a little different about her Life. 

As the then dreams of the girl was now slowly fading away from her forever. With only her dreams to come! Living a Life of whatever was to come for Jenna’

Looking down onto her town, the town seemed different to her it seemed different because now for it was her town her home. Her Life! With Jenna’ now leaving Angels Ravine, making her way back home, but as usual finding herself racing to beat her own best time.

Jenna’ was now making her way back into in Life, along with Hector by her side, riding through the streets on her bike weaving in and out of traffic. For the streets was hers and Life on her bike was now going to take her places that she had never gone before. For she was now riding into Life! into her 

Life, Living a Life of what she made it. For that day! Jenna Ortega’ had found Grace

I’m collecting stories for a creative project about our lived experiences in the public sector, and I’m looking for the absurd, infuriating, hilarious, tragic, and totally normalized things you’ve witnessed working in or around government (even state or local).

What are your “you can’t make this up” moments?The things we laugh at so we don’t cry. The stuff that’s somehow both soul-crushing and hilarious?The rituals we’ve adapted to survive. The policies that make zero sense but keep getting enforced because “that’s just how it’s always been.”

Not classified. Not secret. Just the everyday stuff that would never fly in the private sector or even make sense to the public, but we just… adapt to. I’d love to hear your stories.

Bonus points if it’s pure irony, like OSHA investigators working in federal buildings with safety violations or wage and hour investigators being made to work unpaid overtime. 

**My own examples:**

- Entire floors with legionella infested water and the response is “make sure to leave taps on slow drip over holidays and weekends.”
- Being required to process reports on dot matrix paper until a supply room full of ancient stock is depleted.
- An employee decided to unofficially rename the bulletin board that showed photos of people who had tried to enter and threaten investigation staff. They printed a banner reading “[Agency]’s Top 10 Most Wanted” and stuck it across the top. Then they added a photo of themselves with a fake rap sheet just to see how long it would take someone to notice.
- An employee who had worked at the agency for four years was told they had no background investigation on file and that this was a terminable offense. They had completed everything at onboarding, but it got lost at some point or was never entered. They were given seven days to start over, including a polygraph if needed.
- Assigning someone to a cubicle with zero electrical outlets, forcing them to charge their laptop in the breakroom and work there most of the time.
- An employee received a formal performance award with a certificate and cash bonus. Two years later, payroll claimed it was an overpayment and demanded repayment with interest. HR said there was no record of the award in their file, and that they “should have kept independent documentation”
- Someone used their travel card to pay for hotels, flights, and “consulting dinners” with their sugar baby for 18 months before being caught 
- An employee was approved for a migraine accommodation. The solution? Maintenance removed all the overhead lights. Not just above their cubicle, but the adjacent two as well. No one in that corner could see.
- After a lateral move 100+ hours of annual leave went missing for an employee. They filed a ticket and were told it was a transit sync issue and would be corrected. Weeks passed with 0 leave. When asked for an update they were told to just “use LWOP if needed in the meantime.”
- An outlet shorted out and rather than submit a repair ticket to rewire the panel (which “would require shutting down the floor”), maintenance ran a Daisy chained 16 gauge extension cord from down the hallway, plugged it into a live wall outlet on a different breaker, and zip tied it along the ceiling tiles. When someone questioned the safety, the tech said “It’s 16 gauge. I mean, it should probably be 12 gauge because of the distance but the voltage drop is negligible on what y’all run off of it. Just don’t plug the coffee maker or power tools into it.” 
- After tons of termites were reported crawling across the bathroom floor, maintenance calmly with a straight face said “they get into the ceilings and lay eggs seasonally. Then the larva come out looking for water.” He returned 20 minutes later with a cardboard box, cut it to size, unscrewed the ceiling vent with a power drill, wedged the cardboard over the hole, screwed the vent cover back on ovef it and said “Leave it up there a few weeks. They’ll die off.” When someone asked if he was serious he shrugged and said “It’s what we did at Benning.”

AIO? Am capping first/second dates to less than 2 hours.,"I just turned 30 and over the past 4 months, I’ve been on about 5 Hinge dates with guys between 32 and 40. And honestly, I’m starting to wonder what the point is.

The pattern is always the same. The guy suggests something casual like coffee, ice cream, or a walk. I’m fine with that in theory. I don’t expect some nice dinner. I’d be perfectly happy going to a salad place or something low key where we can actually sit indoors where there’s AC!

But what ends up happening is these “quick” meetups turn into 3 to 5 hour marathons. We’re either walking in circles or sitting on a bench forever. Half the time it’s the evening, and when I ask if they’ve eaten, I get answers like “I meal prep,” “I don’t eat out,” or “I’m trying to be frugal.”

I get it. I meal prep too. I’m not careless with money. But if we’re spending hours together getting to know each other, I would actually prefer to sit indoors and eat something. It doesn’t need to be expensive, just decent.

One guy suggested a bar, which sounded like a step up, but then said they had cheap happy hour beer. Cool, but again, why is everyone so focused on saving a few bucks on a first date?

I work full time and I’m also studying for important exams. My time is limited. I’ve decided I’m capping first dates at two hours from now on. If we’re having a good time and there’s actual food involved, maybe I’ll stay a bit longer. But I’m done giving up entire evenings for dates that feel more like time fillers than actual effort.

And look, I get ready for these things. I shower beforehand, put on makeup, wear perfume, put in effort. I’m not doing all that again just to sweat (and watch him sweat) on a bench eating a $5 ice cream cone because there’s no indoor seating. 

A friend told me I’m being too rigid and should go with the flow. But I really don’t think I’m asking for too much. I also don’t mind paying for my own food, but these guys straight up refuse to eat!

I just want someone to put a little thought into spending time with me.

Am I overreacting?

I don’t talk that much if I don’t have anything to say. Let it be known none of my previous supervisors have voiced this as an issue. It has always been praise and accolades. No one has brought as much attention to it as my current supervisor. She asked me why I was quiet. If I was uncomfortable. That I sat hunched over and looked super focused so she didn’t want to disturb me but since they aren’t used to a quiet person in the office it made them wonder if they were being too loud or distracting. This was the second time my quietness had been brought up. I explain I am an introvert, that I don’t talk much. 

Today it was brought up again by another colleague. She asked if I “just don’t talk”. If I am just a quiet person. This was after I’d just been walking to the coffee shop. 

I have been told to crack a smile and I do smile, I smile when I interact with others and I talk when I need to and I’m not rude or cold. I’m just a reserved person. They asked me again today if they are making me uncomfortable and now I am starting to feel uncomfortable. I feel like I am being watched. Like I’m a spectacle. Today I found myself practicing my smile in the reflection of my laptop to see if it was wide enough and asking myself if my voice sounded happy enough when interacting with them. I don’t think this is fair to me. I was comfortable being myself but now, while I won’t change, I don’t feel comfortable being myself.

These brewers are ideal for office breakrooms, catering operations, churches, community centers, or office‑coffee‑service (OCS) vendors who refurbish gear.

You will need to



\- Identify high‑probability buyers

\- Facilities managers

\- used restaurant‑equipment dealers

\- OCS providers, property managers

\- small corporate campuses, etc. preferably within the DC/Northern VA/MD market.

Close a sale with one of these buyers.

Compensation

The total market price for one of these machines is \~$850, $850 x 19 = $16,150. You should try to sell for about 50% of market price. Use your own negotiation tactics to achieve this. (ie. say 60% let them negotiate to 50...)

The compensation will be based on how much you sell them for.

50% of $16,000 is $8,000. You will get 1/8 of what I sell, meaning if you sell for $8,000, compensation for the job will be $1000.

please send

Did I let loose the slew of hurtful words I knew would find their mark? Curse him out? Slap the plate out of his hand? No, because I'm nice like that.

Complaining to my younger sister yields naught. She's all, ""Be grateful he offered you a bite instead of nothing"" like that cake wasn't my baby and the slice wasn't big enough to split

*RIP cake, your sacrifice into the smelly maw of my brother will not be forgotten  ( ◡̀\_◡́)ᕤ*

So, yeah, I'm pretty mad, especially because that same mouth that just ate the *last* slice of *my* cake that *I* made likes to go on and on about how ""gross"" butter cream is??? My brother in Christ, the dam icing is still on your teeth and around your lips! *""Oh, it's just sweetened butter!""* my butt! It's a wonder you don't have cavities with your diet!

Not to mention, there was a huuuuuge slice of tiramisu that my mother also made for the occasion, just sitting there, saran-wrapped in the fridge, but, no, he *had* to go for my birthday cake (¬\_¬ )

I understand it was good cake, and normally I'd take it as a complement, that my baking is good or whatever but he couldn't have offered to split it? The slice was almost the size of his face, and I would have been happy with just a sliver, anyway!

Is it like greedy to expect the last slice should be mine, since it was for my birthday and i made it?

I'll still be angry if it's justified or not, but I need to know whether I should feel guilty and repress it or feel vindicated and like, idk, refuse to walk him downstairs to get water because he's too scared of the dark to go alone as payback?

1m5scn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToastPOS/comments/1m5scn3/question_regarding_second_level_fulfillment_on_a/,Question Regarding Second Level Fulfillment on a KDS,"Hi everyone! 

Looking to see if anyone has already ran into my issue and found a solution. I work for a specialty coffee company and we are currently looking at the best ways we can implement a KDS system at our upcoming location. This location will have a full kitchen as well as different prep areas on a large coffee bar. Each area will have a dedicated KDS with specific drinks and food items going to their specific KDS. 

I have already figured out how we can send specific items to different prep areas so they are fulfilled on the right KDS. The issue I am running into revolves around second level fulfillment. We will have a runner station where all for here drinks and food items end up for the runner to deliver them. Ideally, I would like the runner to have their own KDS that utilizes second level fulfillment for the runner to confirm when they've delivered an order to its table. The problem here is that we will also have a good amount of to go orders, and I would like those to be fully cleared when the prep area completes them, calls out the ticket name, and hands the drink or food item directly to the guest. 

Essentially, is there a way to tag certain tickets to go through second level fulfillment and have others not? If we send everything through second level fulfillment it will totally overload the runner's KDS with to go orders that have already been handed off, which I would like to avoid. I know I could also just have  for here tickets left unfulfilled until the runner delivers them, but I'd rather not fill the KDS in our prep areas with drinks and food that has already been made. 

Anyone have any ideas? Thanks!",1,1753125905.0,ToastPOS,0,1.0,False

Now in the small town of Huntsville, Alabama . Fee has to try and make friends, though for her making friends is just the ice-berg of the problem as we discover that she is also suffering from an eating disorder - this is something that most females and the occasional male gender can associate with . So when Fee is invited to go spelunking with a group of students from school , she decides to go along though of course Fee has never spelunked before. Her journey begins when she goes spelunking - for those who don't know what it is it's caving, where she meets Faron. They are immediately attracted to each other.However they are both hiding a dark secret , Faron is in fact a shapeshifter - half human and half reptile and of course Fee has her eating disorder ?As like most love stories, we see the characters build up love for each other and soon we discover that Fee is a powerful girl brought to bring a truce between the light and darkness of the world , and Faron needs help to save the secrets of his people before they are destroyed forever. Can the two work together and we discover each of them no matter what their differences can have a happy ending -well for now anyway. When the going gets tough, can these two overcome the obstacles with their teenage love or will peer pressure retaliate ?**

Note: I orginally wrote this book as a joke. It was a take on Twilight, where I thought it would be interesting to use Reptilians instead of vampires. But in the end, I liked the characters and gave them an adventure. I'll include a sample, but I probably won't republish it. It was fun learning about caving and even visiting one. I wrote it under my previous married name of Swaim.

Preface

With his back pressed against the limestone wall, Faron Rothschild sat watching the shadows dancing in the candlelight over the petroglyphs. An outcast from each world, though an emissary for both, Faron’s kind took up the role of protecting humans, whom the Anunnaki abandoned and later warred with, while also keeping the Anunnaki secret from the world that forgot them. Not an easy task, but a great burden.

“Something went wrong long ago,” he whispered. “The world wasn’t supposed to be like this.”

Flannery Birch knelt down beside him, leaning her face toward his and taking the initiative to brush her lips over his—not caring who or what he was. To her, he was her own personal guardian angel. Not a monster, but a boy her age. A cave guide, with blondish hair and gray eyes, who challenged her to take on what frightened her. Emotions simmered like magma when he responded with gentleness.

To ruin the moment, men’s voices shouted out commands above, each taking their position around the vertical cave. Fee closed her eyes, knowing what this meant. Soon, Black Ops would descend into the hole. There was nowhere to run. Sharing in her conclusion of the situation, Faron grasped her closer, stealng a final kiss.

They’re coming. They want to seal the cave.”

“Tell me it’s going to be okay.”

He held her close, stroking her long hair while trying to quell his anguish. Nothing could do that now. He kissed the crown of her head, knowing it was goodbye. “They’ll keep us apart...un-less they get what they want.”

“We won’t let them.”

His face didn’t seem so sure.

“Your spirit honors this cave and its secrets. Never forget them.”

On a count of three, Black Ops rappelled down the ropes on a belay system, traversing the sloping walls with ease. As soon as their boots touched the ground, they spun around, ready for action. Dressed in black with facemasks—making them all the more terrifying—they seemed over-prepared to handle two kids.

Faron jumped in front of the cowering girl, ready to take them on bare-handed. Three larger, muscular men assessed the situation, guns ready to unholster. One agent held up his fist, and the others held their positions while he spoke.

“We’re blowing this cave up. You better leave, now.”

Faron turned to the teen in jean shorts and a summer T-shirt.

“Go.”

“Not without you.”

His face was etched with pain. There was nothing he could do. Then, one of the agents secretly made a triangle sign with his gloved fingers, which Faron understood. The ancient symbol was bound to an ancient allegiance.

“Please, Fee,” he told her as gently possible. “They won’t hurt you.”

Faron stepped aside, but she clung to him, to his arm, her eyes demanding, Why? But the pale boy tilted his head to the shadows, where he belonged.

“No!” she cried, gloved hands yanking her away from him.

She kicked an agent’s legs, but he didn’t even seem to feel it.

“Don’t make this difficult,” the one gripping her said, while another focused on Faron.

Faron quickly moved against the wall, feeling with his left foot for an opening in the cave floor leading to a deeper chamber. He found the edge of it, so he quickly squatted down and inserted a foot, trying to get a good toehold in the rock to climb down. He mentally mapped the tunnels, planning his route.

“Hey,” one barked. “Get the boy.”

A man in black cautiously approached the blond-haired boy, saying, “Easy now. I’m not going to hurt you.”

In a split second, a clawed hand reached up from the pit, encircling Faron’s ankle. With one sharp tug, he was pulled into the darkness. The shorter agent jumped forward, landing on his stomach with an outstretched arm in a last ditch effort to reach the boy. He was too late. The Reptilian descended into the depthswith Faron. Neither a sound nor anything but darkness remained.

Fee tried to free herself from the agent’s hold, but she was dragged toward the ropes, as the taller agent held a flashlight over the cave paintings. Ancient petroglyphs depicted wars with star beings on earth that were long forgotten.

“This is a problem.”

“What is it?” the third one asked.

“Secrets we can’t ever let get out.”

“What about the girl?”

“Get her out of here. Let’s blow this place back to hell, and then we’ll go from there.”

Fee crumpled to the ground, heartbroken. They were going to bury this last link to human history, and there was nothing she could do about it.

Chapter One

Afraid of heights, I always knew I would fall. I just never knew how deep, with secrets too dark to ever mutter...

If you can hear my thoughts, come closer. Don’t you see them? Out of cavernous pits, scaly green shapes slink across the rocks, breaking through to the sun above, moving past you like a whisper. Yet the world sleeps, unaware of this tense moment where two worlds temporarily merge—us and THEM—into one space. They lay waiting all around you, just a breath away, shaping lies into truths, or so I am told.

What would you do if nature had been hiding a different sort of history, one deleted from human memory? Would you want to know?

Reality tells me to go back to sleep, to forget. Logic forces me to believe in this, but you must find out for yourself.

As far as Fee Birch knew, there was nothing safe in this world and nothing sure to believe in. Especially now, while stuck in Huntsville, Alabama—an alien land so far from home. No more boardwalks or the sandy beaches of Virginia Beach. No more seeing best friends, Sheila and Debi, and hanging out at their favorite mall. In an instant, her familiar routine was replaced by scary, tree-covered mountains, a school filled with thick Southern accents, and her grandma’s greasy cooking—as if she was swept away by a cruel current and deposited here, robbed of everything that mattered.

Gunfire in Afghanistan took Mark Birch, her father, away, along with every sacred memory she could no longer revisit, like the park where they played Frisbee or the ice cream parlor they would visit after long bike rides. Now, over 700 miles separated her from home. She was a prisoner of circumstance, kept behind invisible bars. In defiance, her unpacked suitcase stood by her bedroom door. This would never be home.

She had few memories of Huntsville, apart from sporadic trips at Christmas time or summer breaks. Now, it was permanent.

She was stuck here and couldn’t get used to it. When she looked out her new bedroom window, she saw a steep valley below and jagged gray rocks waiting for her to fall. Worse than that, high school as a newcomer mortified her. The twisting halls felt like a labyrinth to keep her lost. She kept her head down, but their disapproving stares dug into her back, and their giggles threatened her tolerance.

Pain gripped her stomach, and her breathing was labored as she fought back tears. After all, Fee didn’t want to cry in biology class—not even the third to last week of school. Making a scene now would ruin any future without teasing at that school, not that she had much of one, anyway. Many of the kids kept a wary eye on her, probably waiting to see if she would crack. As proof, Fee caught the dark-haired boy next to her watching her, causing her blood to congeal. Please don’t let Niko Sari see me fall apart, she thought. Anybody, but him.

She straightened up in her chair, pretending to pay attention to Ms. Larson prattling on about upcoming exams. The teacher wore a straight denim skirt to her ankles, a buttoned blouse, and her hair in a bun. This was so unlike home. Fee sighed. This was her life now.

Since she arrived two weeks ago with her Mom, Deidre Birch, after her Dad died in the war, not much held her interest. Not Huntsville High or the culture shock. Not even the other 16-year-olds, except for maybe the boy in the jeans and black T-shirt. He rode his skateboard in the parking lot before school, getting chased away by a too lenient teacher, after skating up beside her to say hello. Even now, he kept his head turned toward her.

What did he see? A quiet, mousy girl in a plain brown blouse and equally plain pants?

A whisper behind her got her attention. Fee rolled her eyes, happy that her back was to Jill Carter, Niko’s flawless girlfriend.

Nothing to destroy one’s confidence like being next to that beauty queen, she thought.

“Niko, are you going spelunking on Sunday?”

Jill’s overly sultry voice made Fee cringe as if listening to nails on a chalkboard.

“Yeah, I’ll be there,” Niko answered, his eyes still on Fee. Her periphery confirmed it. After a pause, he asked, “Are you into spelunking, Fee?”

“Yes, of course. Isn’t everyone?”

Jill snorted and Niko laughed. Was this a joke? Maybe she shouldn’t have answered so quickly. It might not even be a real word.

“I bet she doesn’t even know what it is,” Jill chided.

Shielding her face with her Biology book, Fee slumped in her seat. Her cheeks burned. She pictured Jill’s blond good looks, her cheerleader spunk—everything Fee didn’t have.

Ignoring Jill’s aversion to Fee, Niko leaned into the aisle, narrowing the gap between them, hesitantly asking, “Want to come?”

“Sure?” It sounded like a question.

Ms. Larson cleared her throat to get their attention and then proceeded in her drawl to discuss tonight’s assignment, which

Fee reluctantly wrote down with a dying pen. Homework was a chore, even if her old school had already done these chapters on molecular biology. Fee closed her notebook and stared out the window, fingering the beaded necklace around her neck. A metal charm in the shape of a swirl, like a seashell spiral, hung from the center. A gift from Dad after a trip to Djibouti, Africa, it was her good luck charm—the one thing she had to help her get through rough times.

The bell rang. Relieved, Fee slung her green backpack over her shoulders and waited for the chatty girls in shorts and flip flops to clear the aisle. The dress code was so different. She would have been suspended if she wore a tank top back home or secretly chewed gum like Jill behind her, waiting for Fee to move aside. Niko elbowed his way to catch up to Fee, but Jill clasped his hand, claiming ownership.

“So, see you Sunday?”

Snippy Jill made a disgruntled sound as she awaited Fee’s answer.

“Sure, when?” She felt an evil delight when Jill’s pointy jaw dropped.

“We’re meeting at the Five Points coffee shop at two.”

“I’ll be there.”

“Good,” he smiled. “See ya.”

Jill dragged him past Fee and stomped her way to her locker, which Niko leaned against, paying too much attention as Fee slowly squeezed into the crowd. She ducked behind some boys in overalls, ignoring talk of monster trucks and hunting, and focused on her pressing concern. I better find out what this spelunking is. What if it was jumping off cliffs or mud wrestling? She had better find out, now!

Through the double doors, hot air enveloped her like a second skin. She suddenly knew why the dress code here was so lax. Maybe tomorrow she would dress like the others and fit in better. At least on the surface.

Fee retrieved her cell phone and settled into her purple Neon, flinging her backpack onto the floor. Connecting to the web, she  typed in letters, guessing on how to spell such an odd word. The answer flashed on the screen. Her gut gurgled nauseously. I’m in serious trouble.

A knock on her window made her jump. A brunette in red shorts smiled sweetly. Fee lowered the window when she recognized the petite girl with the heart-shaped face.

“Hey, Fee. I heard you were coming Sunday.”

“Yeah, spelunking? Wouldn’t miss it.”

Mai Pha had welcomed her right away on the first day of school, inviting her to sit with her in P.E., making it tolerable. Also, being Niko’s childhood friend sweetened the deal. Who couldn’t like Mai? Naturally happy, she eased Fee’s dark mood.

“Wear hiking boots and elbow and knee pads if you have them. Some of the more serious cavers wear waterproof socks and boots or special rubber shoes called wellies, but you’re a new-bie, so we won’t push you too hard.”

Oh. I have none of those things. Not even hiking boots. There weren’t many places to hike in Virginia Beach. Maybe a sand dune, but that wasdone barefoot.

“Uhh, thanks.”

She dug herself into a deeper hole by agreeing to do this. Maybe caving would swallow her up and end this charade. Bits of old memories tried to push through, but she cast them back into the murkiness of forgetfulness.

Fee gave a nervous wave and backed away as quickly as possible.",1,1753125803.0,MelissaRovellibooks,0,1.0,False

Hey you,

I’m a 33-year-old guy from Southeast Michigan—somewhere between the Thumb and the “Let’s Get Lost on a Backroad” state of mind—and I’m hoping to meet a woman who’s up for something easy, playful, and real. Not chasing games or collecting convos—just looking for good energy and one solid connection that clicks.

About Me:
By weekday, I work a hybrid job with weird hours and way too much freedom. That means I’m pretty flexible for spontaneous hangs—coffee runs, nature walks, or just vibing on the couch with something dumb (or deliciously trashy) on TV. I’m a sports guy, a reader, a casual drinker, and an expert in post-work zoning out.

But when the weekend hits? That’s when I come alive. Camping, kayaking, beach glass hunting, checking out a new brewery, or hitting the trails—I’m down for anything outdoors that doesn’t involve climbing something with ropes. It’s all about the breeze, the laughs, and the little moments.

Vibe Check:
I’m laid-back with a sarcastic streak. Big on affection, humor, and actually listening. My love language is a mix of playful teasing, physical touch, and showing up when it counts. I’ll flirt, I’ll joke, I’ll get deep—and I’d love someone who’s just as real and open in return.

The Basics:
5'10"", athletic build

Green eyes, brown hair

Disease-free, non-smoker, social drinker

Physically active and emotionally available
Low-key but never boring

What I’m Into:
You don’t have to fit a mold—just be you. If you’re confident, kind, a little weird, curvy, sarcastic, outdoorsy, or a mix of all the above, we’ll probably vibe. I’m drawn to women who can laugh at themselves, flirt a little recklessly, and still hold a real conversation when it matters.

Looking for something ongoing and meaningful—whether that’s a daily chat, silly memes, swapping music, or eventually planning a laid-back meetup. Chemistry first, pressure never.

So if you're tired of surface-level nonsense and want something that’s equal parts fun and honest, shoot your shot. Skip the “hey” and hit me with your favorite guilty pleasure show, a flirty one-liner, or the most chaotic way you’d spend a Sunday.

Let’s flirt a little, talk a lot, and maybe build something kind of awesome.

Not sure if this is the right place for this, but figured maybe there are some here who have been in a similar scenario before, or are fitness instructors. I (30F) have been taking class at a spin studio with the same instructor (50F) for 5 years. She is also the owner of the studio (it's a small boutique studio). We have gotten to know each other pretty well over the years as we talk often before and after class, follow each other on social media, and occasionally text. She has a good amount of friends who are riders from the studio, most around her age, that will hang out outside of class. In the fall, she did invite me to an outing for her birthday with a few other members. I was wondering if it would be weird/not appropriate to ask her to grab a coffee or something sometime after class?

1m5s5ak,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m5s5ak,Help with weird space in living room,"

Hi, everyone! So I have a bit of a weird space in my new living room, between the couch and the armchair. The previous owners had a similar set up, but with a bookshelf dividing the space (last two pictures). I think it worked for them because they had an L shaped couch that didn't get lost behind the bookshelf, and a much smaller dinning table. I have tried to look for something similar, but eventually decided against it as it would hide the couch and anyone seating on it, plus I don't like the look of the books from the other side.

I also have considered a smaller bookshelf, to create a sort of reading nook, but it's impossible to find one that isn't taller than the couch or much smaller. Now, I was thinking about putting a floor lamp there and maybe a small coffee table between them, but that still doesn't feel quite right, so I come to you looking for ideas. Or maybe it would look fine as it is, with some art on the wall behind it? Thank you all in advance and have a lovely day!

P.S.: Also, if anyone feels up for it, ideas for the corner next to the window, behind the couch, would be much appreciated!",6,1753125444.0,DesignMyRoom,13,0.88,False

I have used all my mutes (separate complaint- why are muting communities limited?) and still every 3rd post I see is Trump this, Trump that. America dying. Yeah, he sucks. Can I spend 5 fucking minutes of my life browsing reddit in peace? I'm not on reddit to change the world. I'm on reddit to read/make dumb sports takes, watch cute cats, and laugh. I'm not on reddit to be Malcolm X or start a grassroots campaign. I'm on reddit to take a break and fuck around. 

Just look at this community. 3 of 4 posts are ""if you voted X screw you""

I cant drive 10 minutes without seeing either 20 pro or 20 anti Trump stickers or flags, or billboards for the same. Man, I just want to jam out and coast from point A to point B

I cant go to a BBQ joint or buy a coffee without seeing signs like ""10% of our proceeds to fucking HEROES IN IRAQ and the BRAVE POLICE AND FIREFIGHTERS, none of those pansy feminist programs can I get a hell yeah brother"" or the signs that say ""at this place love is love, black lives matter, it gets better,science exists, women can choose, insert 5 more political statements"". Look man. How about you just have a regular fucking business and then reserve the right to refuse service to nazis, dickheads, or whoever the hell you want?

Maybe I'm the odd one out but I don't have the energy to be angry and upset about politics 24/7. I'd like my escapism or little calming self care routine to *actually* let me escape. 

I took today off specifically as a pure lazy, browse reddit, pick up groceries and lunch and chill with my cat day. Instead I let myself get annoyed enough during my ""relaxing"" day to make a reddit post which I realize is just adding to the problem

Also, please tell me the mannerisms of those places. Like
	•	Can I sit there for 3 hours if I just order a coffee?
	•	Will I be side-eyed if I pull out a sketchbook or journal?

1m5s0qm,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingZyn/comments/1m5s0qm/day_10_no_pouches_all_this_from_some_pouches/,Day 10 no pouches (all this from some pouches?),"Like many of the other users here I transitioned to nic pouches(On 8mg for me) to quit smoking 2 years ago. The ease and stealth of the pouches made my use ramp up pretty quickly and I was taking 24mg every ~4 hours. 

My health and social life quickly vanished. I experienced horrible itching acne on the face, scalp and neck(I'm bald so there was no hiding). Panic attacks, gerd, deep depression due to confusion over what the origin of these symptoms might be. Nobody knew I used them either which made everything worse. 

I never once considered the nicotine to be the source of the issue and finding this community was a godsend. It was the ultimate eureka moment and I threw the pouches right then. I'm way luckier than most. I've been riding that first wave and keeping it fresh in my mind to prevent relapse. 

The first 3 days were an absolute nightmare; to be honest, I don't remember much outside of the splitting pain and insomnia. Days 4-9 I felt bad derealization, paranoia and a persistent dread. I told my partner about the revelation that made me quit and they were a bit shook but they're committed to helping me through this. The past ~3 days those symptoms were overridden by a manic paranoia that's really testing me. 

I am way more talkative in this manic state and have been holding conversations hostage. It's exhausting and I feel like its pushing people away. I've always been a reserved person and the pouches made me talk even less. Now I have big emotions with a lot to say and it's uncomfortable. This energy is worse than anything in the first week. At night I wake up every 2 hours and I sleep on an air mattress because I'm pouring sweat. The anxiety hit a breaking point which caused a panic attack earlier. This led to another revelation: quit the damn caffeine too. 

The great users on this subreddit kept saying how nicotine reduces caffeine absorption so there's no wonder I'm tweaking out of my gourd. After my 2nd plunger of coffee today I made a commitment to quit that as well. It was never a consideration until I realized how much relief I felt after the first week of stopping nicotine. I'm hoping the anxiety starts to level off after quitting caffeine, I'm not looking forward to my energy levels but I always walked the tightrope between enough caffeine to focus and anxiety attack. 

I'm 2 years sober from alcohol and always viewed those 2 as deserved vices but I didn't realize just how much I was weighing myself down. I knew after my last alcohol relapse that it was the final one, and I was incompatible with it. I now view nicotine through the same lens and it's made me come to terms immediately. 

I'm grateful for that experience because I feel like it's supercharged my willpower. It's only been 10 days but some of my facial acne has started to clear up and my stamina has improved. I've also been getting boners I haven't had in years it's unreal. 

I feel like I'm trying to sell magic beans but this shit works and the results are incredible. The regular posters on this subreddit are god damn saints for sharing your experience, symptoms and recovery strategies. It's a shame reddit's search feature is so shitty, my motivation to post this was to keep some fresh stuff available for people like us.

One moment it’s all ube everything and dystopian fonts. Next, it’s Sardinian squid ink and analog camcorder nostalgia. Somewhere between the TikTok comment sections, off-brand Reddit rants, and anonymous survey fields lies the raw, unfiltered pulse of the audience. And companies are done pretending they don’t care. They’re harvesting it. All of it.

Feedback isn’t just a suggestion box anymore. It’s a commodity. And artificial intelligence has become the blender. Throwing in fan reactions, reviews, rants, and obscure emojis, then spitting out product ideas and content pivots before a human strategist finishes their coffee. According to a 2025 study by NielsenIQ, 72% of entertainment companies now use AI to aggregate and analyze audience feedback across multiple platforms in real time. It’s not about applause or critique. It’s about identifying patterns in the noise, fast enough to act on them before the next cycle begins.

Gone are the days of the creative genius operating in a vacuum. Today’s content creators, from streamers to major studios, are running post-release data autopsies with machine precision. Every reaction, whether it’s a “meh” in a review thread or a 2-second skip on a video, is tracked, quantified, and synthesized. Netflix reports using AI tools that analyze 350,000 data points per episode to guide future content decisions, including pacing, themes, and even thumbnail art. Those gritty Scandi noir dramas and viral food docuseries? All backed by analytics stronger than the director’s gut.

This isn’t art by committee. It’s art by algorithmically trained mob. The machine picks up on shifts that no creative director would ever catch, tiny upticks in interest around specific characters, subtle lulls in plotlines, spikes in engagement around unexpected themes. AI models are now trained to interpret natural language sentiment, sarcasm, and emotional tone with over 90% accuracy, according to OpenAI research published in 2024.

The result? A content factory that breathes audience input. Podcasts adjusting formats mid-season. Streaming services replacing pilot testing with AI-driven feedback loops. Brands releasing alternate endings based on trending viewer sentiment. According to Accenture, companies that integrate real-time audience feedback into their content lifecycle see 31% higher engagement and 22% lower churn.

And it isn’t limited to entertainment. Consumer products, menu development, fashion drops. It’s all feeding off aggregated input. Lululemon’s latest color palette wasn’t chosen by a designer with a vision. It was derived from AI-powered preference mapping run across customer reviews and online chatter. The result? A 17% boost in sell-through within the first 30 days, according to their 2025 earnings call.

But this isn’t just about riding waves. It’s about controlling them. Companies are beginning to seed questions, prompt reactions, and drive discourse in ways that generate usable data. You’re not just watching a show or trying a product. You’re training the system. Feeding the beast.

This shift has turned feedback into fuel. No longer an afterthought, it’s baked into every stage. From ideation to testing to post-launch optimization. Lifecycle management platforms like Gainsight and Amplitude now offer full integration of AI feedback synthesis, allowing teams to iterate and deploy content variations in under 72 hours. In the language of commerce, that’s agility on steroids.

Some call it innovation. Others call it pandering. But there’s no denying the numbers. A 2025 Forrester report found that content strategies incorporating AI-synthesized fan feedback saw an average ROI lift of 28% over static planning approaches. Whether you’re building a video game, launching a merch line, or rolling out a limited-edition craft soda, ignoring the hive is no longer an option.

The feedback loop is infinite, ravenous, and eerily precise. It doesn’t wait for surveys. It doesn’t care about feelings. It thrives on patterns, and it rewards those bold enough to feed it everything.

Hey folks!

I’m a 23-year-old guy from Denmark looking to make some new online friends. I’m pretty chill, slightly nerdy, and always up for a good chat – whether it’s deep, dumb, or somewhere in between.

Some things I’m into:
	•	Cooking - I find it weirdly relaxing, and I’m always up for trying new recipes (or just improvising and hoping for the best).
	•	Chess - I’m not great, but I’m trying! If you also enjoy slowly losing to bots, we’ll get along.
	•	History - the more obscure the facts, the better. I love when something random from 500 years ago ends up in a modern meme.
	•	Reading - mostly fiction, but I dabble in whatever grabs my attention.
	•	And generally just trying to figure life out, one questionable decision at a time.

If you’re into any of the above, or just want someone to talk to about literally anything, feel free to DM me. Always happy to chat, share random thoughts, or complain about how expensive coffee is now.

I feel compelled to share that I am feeling burn out on life and I am unable to enjoy my hobbies, like carding. I didn't even think something like that was possible. I thought ordering fresh stamps would jumpstart my carding motivation but I am not there yet. I just finished taking an 8 week long course and I am working with a personal advisor to figure out some stuff. To be honest, I feel burnt out from life.

  
My stack of cards have been sitting on my coffee table, and I can't bring my most creative self forward. This past week, I began reading a card and it made me so happy. But then I felt guilty, almost like I should not experience the joy of receiving a card simply because I am not in a moment to reciprocate. Which I know, is very silly! Which brings me to the title of this post: I feel that I owe you an apology. Perhaps writing this post will be what jumpstarts my carding motivation

This might be a long shot, but I couldn’t stop myself from trying.

We were both on the IndiGo flight from Srinagar to Mumbai on July 21st (8 PM departure). As we deboarded the plane and rode the coach to the arrival terminal, we kept glancing at each other  a few times our eyes met at the same time. I felt something in that moment… a mutual curiosity or maybe just a shared silence that said more than words could.

You were wearing a beautiful white chikankari kurta with blue denim, stylish earrings, and really cool glasses. You had a blue-covered iPhone too. Your sense of style was striking, but it was the vibe you carried  a calm, elegant, and a little mysterious that left an impression.

We never spoke. Maybe both of us were just a bit shy or unsure if the other felt the same. But now that we’ve gone our separate ways at Mumbai airport, I genuinely regret not saying even a simple “Hi”.

If you happen to read this, or if someone who knows you does  ,I’d just love to say hello, maybe grab a coffee someday, and hear your version of that quiet little moment.

Until then, I’ll hope the internet does its magic. #srinagar #mumbai #indigo

1m5rrkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassF/comments/1m5rrkl/part_32/,Part 32,"**Gabe**

The sun hit the asphalt like it had something to prove.

Heat rose off the streets in lazy waves, curling around rusted fences, plastic chairs, broken antennas. The neighborhood smelled of iron and dust, of frying oil and tired hope. Our base if you could call it that was nothing more than an abandoned daycare turned war room, roof patched with tarp and dreams.

But today, it was full.

Twenty people stood before me. Men and women, some younger than me, others already with grey in their hair. Some wore homemade gear, others came with nothing but fists and fire in their eyes. All of them forgotten by the world. All of them burning.

“I’m not here to save you,” I said. My voice didn’t shake. “I’m here to remind you we can save ourselves.”

A few nodded. Most stayed still. You learn not to hope when you’re raised in concrete and silence.

“To take back anything,” I continued, “we have to learn what we’re capable of.”

Behind me, Gaspar was organizing the crates not of weapons, but supplies: basic medicine, food, parts for power converters. Honny floated above, drawing our next operation on the cracked wall — a target marked near the city center: another bank. No bombs. No tools. Just the right combination of power and rage.

“We train first,” I told them. “You don’t walk into fire without knowing how to burn.”

They listened. Because they had nothing else left to believe in.

Nath sat on a broken desk, recording names and abilities with the focus of a war nurse. She had her hoodie pulled up, but her eyes were sharp and full of purpose.

“Gabe,” she whispered, pointing her pen. “Mr. João from block seven — he’s asking if we can bring water filters. His granddaughter’s lungs are getting worse.”

“And the old lady from the yellow house,” she added. “She came again. Needs insulin.”

I didn’t hesitate. “We’ll get both. Just add them to the list.”

Outside, some of the kids had started painting the walls with bright colors — suns, trees, fists. Honny was helping them float up on crates. Gaspar had set up a makeshift testing zone: lines drawn on the ground, barrels to lift, target boards for aim training.

“This isn’t charity,” I said to the group. “This is infrastructure. We’re building something that lasts. A movement that feeds itself. Heals itself. Defends itself.”

Honny landed next to me, sweat on him brow, smiling like the storm we were planning was just a parade.

“Two projects already started,” she said. “One’s a house for orphans. The other — a cleanup base near the dump. Eventually? Food garden. Water tanks. Power grid. We’re gonna grow this.”

Gaspar came close, low voice in my ear.

“You noticed?” he asked. “No drones. No patrols. No media. Not even Capas sniffing around.”

I nodded slowly. “They’re not watching us.”

“Exactly. Either we’re lucky…”

“Or we’re that invisible.”

The thought stayed with me.

And then Nath ran in again, her voice tight. “Gabe—your mom’s here. And the babies.”

My chest stiffened.

Not now.

But I walked to the door anyway. Because this is what a leader does. He faces everything.

Even the pieces he thought he’d left behind.

———

The door creaked as I opened it.

She stood there. Same worn coat. Same tired eyes. But different now. Heavier.

In her arms wrapped in a faded blue blanket — were my baby brothers. Joel and Cael. Barely one year old. Twin fists clutching silence. They looked up at me like they recognized nothing and everything.

“Come in,” I said.

She didn’t move at first.

Then she stepped through the doorway, her breath uneven. Her arms trembling from the weight of the boys.

“I had to come,” she said. “You didn’t leave an address. I had to ask around. Had to follow the trail.”

I nodded once. I didn’t ask how many favors she’d burned to find me.

“You have to stop this,” she said. “You’re just a kid, Gabe. Seventeen. This whatever this is — it’s going to get you killed.”

Her voice cracked.

And I hated how much it still hurt to hear her worry.

But I didn’t flinch.

“No,” I said. “This is going to keep me alive.”

She blinked, stunned.

“I found something, mom,” I continued. “Something real. Something that doesn’t ask me to kneel. This isn’t some tantrum. It’s purpose.”

She tried to speak, but I raised a hand.

“This world… doesn’t have rules. Just power. And silence. And whatever lies the rich tell to keep us down. But here? Here I make the rules. I fight for the people no one else fights for. I see them. And they see me.”

I gestured to the walls, the crowd, the quiet machine that was slowly becoming a revolution.

“We did more in three days than a hundred heroes did in three years.”

She stepped forward, tears threatening.

“What about your future?” she whispered. “What about me? What about them?”

I looked at Joel. At Cael. At those small eyes too innocent to understand hunger.

“I did more for them,” I said, softly, “than the man you still call a hero.”

She flinched.

“My father left,” I went on. “He put on a cape and vanished. You still light candles for him. You still hope. But I stayed. I bled. I led.”

Her tears fell freely now.

I walked to her. Took the cloth from her shoulder and wiped her cheeks.

“You don’t have to believe in me, mom,” I said. “You don’t even have to stay. I’ll get you out of here. A real place. Clean water. Safety.”

I touched the boys’ foreheads, gently. They didn’t cry. Just stared.

“If I shame you,” I said, “then I’ll disappear. But I’ll still protect you. Still send food. Still be the ghost that guards your door.”

She shook her head, sobbing now.

And I smiled, faint and firm.

“I was born for this.”

My hands clenched.

“I will not die.”

My voice rose.

“I will reshape this world. I will be the hero people forgot to pray for.”

And for the first time since I started…

I truly believed it.

**Sofia**

The office always smelled like old wires and dried jasmine.

Sakamoto kept his windows shut. Said open air made people careless. I didn’t argue. I liked the quiet — liked how the hum of the monitors softened into a kind of rhythm if I sat still long enough. There were twenty-seven cables running through the walls, I’d mapped them all on the first day. His coffee mug had a chip on the lip. His coat — dark navy, lined with Kevlar and tired years — always hung from the same hook, second from the left.

I sat across from him, legs crossed, notebook untouched.

He didn’t look at me when he spoke.

“You don’t blink much.”

My heart gave a small twitch — not fear, just awareness.

“Is that a problem, sir?”

He finally looked up. Sharp eyes, not cruel — just the kind that had seen too much and decided to keep watching anyway.

“No,” he said. “It’s rare. Most people fidget. You observe.”

He tapped the desk with one long finger. “That’s what we need.”

I stayed quiet. Let silence say yes for me.

He pushed a folder toward me, thick and stained with rain.

“Public school in the southern district. Coração do Sol. We got a tip — drugs showing up in lunchboxes. Kids being used as carriers. No cameras caught anything. No one talks. Teachers too scared or too tired to care. I want names. Routes. Proof.”

He paused.

“And no panic. No drama. Eyes only.”

I let my smile be small.

“I brought plenty.”

⸻

My mind walked where my body didn’t have to.

The spiders had gone ahead.

Sixteen of them, each born from my breath and hunger and precision. Each one tuned to me — to my pulse, my rage, my memory. They weren’t pets. They were eyes. Ears. Fingers I’d grown in silence and stretched across a school that didn’t know it was bleeding.

I had placed them with care. Beneath cracked lockers, behind the ceiling vents, inside erasers and forgotten pencil cases. One rested in a hollowed textbook. Another clung to the fan above the cafeteria like a dead leaf. Each of them moved with the rhythm of breath — light, unhurried, patient.

Each of them saw.

I opened myself to them.

It always started as a flutter in the back of my neck. Like someone whispering with no mouth. Then a warmth behind my eyes, gentle but persistent — a soft static, a choir made of legs and silk.

And then the world unfolded.

Sixteen visions. Sixteen directions.

A girl chewing on her hair, trying not to cry into a math test.

A boy stuffing raisins into his pocket like gold.

Teachers arguing in whispered Portuguese over which parent had threatened them this week.

One spider felt vibration in the floor — someone stomping in anger.

Another felt silence.

And then, through two of them, I saw him.

Luiz Navarro.

Eleven years old, but his spine already curled like someone who had learned to flinch before the blow came. His shirt was inside out — again. No one noticed. He didn’t speak. He didn’t play. He didn’t eat, just picked at his tray like he was afraid the food might bite back.

But he had habits.

Always walked a little slower after recess. Always passed the janitor’s closet. Always paused.

That pause was everything.

I honed in. Pulled three spiders toward the closet — inside the wall, behind the light switch, on the rusted pipe above the mop rack.

And I waited.

He came.

He looked both ways — out of instinct, not training.

Then he reached behind the loose tile.

The foil packet slid out with a practiced hand.

It was small. Folded tight. Sealed with care. Not made by children.

He tucked it into his second sock, the one with the faded cartoon print. Then walked away with his arms stiff and his eyes dull.

I felt my stomach harden.

He wasn’t the source. He was a line in the chain.

I followed.

⸻

Three hours later, the spiders were already waiting.

Behind trash bins. On cracked bricks. Inside the old pipe that jutted from the alley wall like a broken bone.

The handoff.

Three boys waited — except they weren’t boys.

One had a neck tattoo that looked like it had been carved, not inked. The second was missing a finger — index, left hand. Knife accident, probably. The last one… he had the kind of eyes that made you feel like a name on a list. A smile like he’d already chosen your grave.

Luiz handed off the packet.

No eye contact. No words.

Just shame — so thick I could taste it through my spiders.

And I listened.

“Tomorrow,” one said. “Double the count. We got new mouths in line.”

“Don’t let the rat mess it up. I’ll skin him.”

“Kid’s too dumb to talk. Just scared enough to stay.”

Their laughter was gravel in a blender.

I mapped their faces. Ran them through the database I’d built in silence for months.

They called themselves “Leste 9.”

Small-time. Careful. Invisible.

But I saw them.

I saw everything.

Their meetings, their routes, their stash house three blocks north near the hollow construction site. I watched them joke, watched them threaten, watched them rehearse being untouchable.

And still — my spiders waited.

In their pockets. On their bikes. Inside the cracked screen of the phone they passed around like a blade.

Every whisper. Every smile. Every lie.

All of it — mine.

⸻

I came back to myself slowly.

Like surfacing from deep water.

The school faded from my eyes, and I was back in the cold of the Association’s office. Back in my skin. My hands were trembling — not from fear, but from strain. Controlling that many threads for that long always left me raw. Every nerve buzzing.

I touched my chest. My heartbeat was steady. Strong.

And inside me — fury.

Not the wild kind. Not the kind that wants to scream.

The kind that watches. Learns. Remembers.

And strikes exactly where it hurts.

I packaged the footage, labeled it cleanly, and walked back to Sakamoto’s office with my shoulders squared.

I didn’t knock. Just handed it over.

He didn’t speak for a while.

He watched.

And when it ended, he leaned back in his chair, a line between his brows.

“That was fast,” he said. “Precise.”

I met his gaze. “They were careless.”

He gave a single nod. Approval — real, not polite.

“Good. I’ll send field agents now. This ends today.”

Then softer: “Well done, Sofia. Seriously.”

I nodded.

And walked out before he could say anything that might make it harder to breathe.

⸻

On the way home, I felt the wind push through the broken gaps between buildings. It smelled like dust and old bread.

The sky was cracked open with gold. My shoes tapped the sidewalk in time with my pulse. I passed five strangers. I catalogued them all.

But I was smiling.

Not wide. Not stupid.

Just… steady.

Because I had done something. Not loud. Not grand.

But real.

No one saw it.

But I knew.

And sometimes, knowing is enough to keep breathing in this world.

Sometimes, it’s the only thing that is.

———

**Clint**

There’s a silence that settles into a room when you’ve been thinking too long. The kind that makes the walls feel closer than they are. The kind that makes your own breath sound loud.

I was sitting cross-legged on my bedroom floor, the screen of my old laptop glowing against my face. Blank document. Cursor blinking like a heartbeat.

Name: Clint Oliveira. Age: 17. Power: Unlock things.

God. That sounds pathetic.

I erased the line. Typed it again. “Unlock restraints, locks, doors, mechanisms—” I deleted it all. What was I doing? What kind of hero writes “used to free classmates from belts” as experience?

I stared at the screen until my eyes blurred. Then I leaned back, palms flat against the floor, and looked at the cracked ceiling like it could answer the questions burning inside my ribs.

Where do I belong?

I wasn’t a fighter like Danny. Not a strategist like Zula. I wasn’t terrifying like Leo or broken enough to be poetic like Gabe. I was just… here. A kid who’d tasted power for the first time and didn’t know how deep the well went. And now the school—our school—was gone. The only place I ever felt like someone might call my name and mean it.

What now?

The laptop fan whirred quietly. Outside, a dog barked. A siren passed in the distance.

Then—buzz. My phone. Loud in the stillness.

Unknown number.

My stomach did a slow turn. For a second I thought of not answering. But something about the silence that followed felt… intentional. Like someone was waiting on the other end, not just dialing.

I picked up. “…Hello?”

A pause.

Then— “Clint.”

That voice. Calm. Solid. Like someone who had already lived through the war and come back to teach the rest of us how to survive it.

“Professor?” I breathed.

“I figured you’d still be home,” he said. “Still thinking.”

I swallowed. “Yeah… I’ve been trying to decide what to do next. Everything felt clear at the school. It was the only place that didn’t treat me like I was invisible. But now… I don’t know. I don’t know where I fit.”

“Then I called at the right time,” he said. “Because I have something. And your power? It’s exactly what I need.”

I sat up straighter. My heart punched once, hard.

“You do?”

“Clint… do you want to be a real hero?”

The words hit something soft inside me. Something hidden. I didn’t answer right away. I looked at my hands—scarless, trembling, unsure.

“I’ve always wanted to,” I said finally. “But I didn’t think I’d be useful. I mean—I owe Zula. I owe you. I feel the power now. I just… don’t know how to use it.”

“I do,” Zenos said. His voice was so certain it made the walls feel further away again, like I had more room to breathe. “And you will. Trust me, Clint—your power is more than useful. It’s essential.”

Something unfolded in my chest. Not pride. Not hope. Something heavier. Like purpose, but still forming.

“So when do we start?” I asked.

“Soon,” he replied. “I’m coming to you. Just wait for me. Don’t trust anyone in the meantime. Keep your ears open. Your eyes sharper. And above all—stay alert.”

He didn’t wait for my reply.

The line went dead.

I stayed there, phone against my ear, breathing shallow.

For the first time in days, I didn’t feel like a side character in someone else’s story. I felt… seen.

And maybe, just maybe—

I was ready.

———

**Zenos**

The teleportation left a burn behind my ribs — the kind that feels like someone rearranged your bones while you weren’t looking.

We landed in a cramped apartment. One of those temporary government flats: too white, too quiet, too hollow. Everything here had sharp corners and cheap paint. The kind of place you try not to get used to.

A round wooden table sat in the center of the living room, legs uneven, surface scratched like someone had been working through their grief with a fork. Around it — Danny. Jerrod. And her.

Giulia.

I’d never met her before.

But damn.

There was something about her that made my thoughts stutter. Not just beauty — no, this was something serrated. Like elegance with a scar. Like someone who had bled and learned how to hide it behind her smile.

My mouth almost said something stupid.

But Zula’s elbow jabbed my ribs with surgical precision. I nodded. Right. Focus.

“Sorry for the sudden visit,” I said. “We didn’t want to draw attention.”

Danny stood immediately. Jerrod followed. Both stiff, uncertain. But Giulia — she just stared. Not cold. Not warm. Like someone watching a fire to see which way it’d spread.

“Sit,” she said finally.

So we did.

For a moment, no one spoke.

Just the hum of the fridge and the click of Zula’s boots against the tile.

I looked at Danny. The kid had grown. Not taller — heavier. Not in weight, but in weight. His eyes carried things now. Regret. Determination. Grief with nowhere to land.

I took a breath and dropped the veil.

“I don’t have a speech,” I said. “I don’t have guarantees either. What I do have is a choice. A dangerous one. And I’m here because I need help. Real help. The kind that comes with scars and doubts and people you’d die for.”

Danny leaned forward. “What kind of help?”

“The kind where we stop pretending the Association is broken. It’s not broken. It’s built this way. And now… we dismantle it.”

Silence.

Not shocked silence.

Heavy silence.

The kind that follows a truth someone else had been too afraid to say first.

Giulia was the one who broke it. She exhaled like she’d been holding that breath for a decade.

“Well,” she said, voice dry, “finally. A man who sees.”

She leaned back in her chair. Her hand traced the edge of her cup.

“My husband disappeared ten years ago. A hero. Not powerful. Not famous. But good. Loyal. He put his life into that damn Association. One day, they came to the door and told me he died. No details. No ceremony. No body.”

I felt my throat tighten.

“What was his name?” I asked, even though I already knew.

“…Tulio,” she said. “They called him the Golden Soldier.”

And there it was.

A name I had buried.

I closed my eyes, and I was back. A decade younger. Wearing the golden badge on my collar like it meant something. Tulio was never meant for frontline combat — not really. He had heart. He had discipline. But not power.

The Association didn’t care.

They had me boost him. Just a bit. Enough to ‘test his limits.’ Then they threw him into a meat grinder. A mission that broke monsters in half. He never came back. Not because he failed — but because they never expected him to succeed.

He was an experiment. A number. And I helped.

I clenched my jaw.

“I remember Tulio,” I said softly. “I was ordered to give him an enhancement. Told it was safe. That it was part of a greater good.”

Giulia’s hands were fists now. Her voice cracked. “They said he died a hero. But I know what that means. It means they used him up and threw him away.”

She looked at me then. Really looked.

“And if you’re telling me you want to tear them down… then I’m listening.”

Zula stayed quiet, arms crossed, gaze sharp as ever.

Danny’s eyes were wet, but he didn’t wipe them. He just nodded.

I nodded back.

“This isn’t revenge,” I said. “It’s not glory. It’s survival. For people like you. Like Tulio. Like your sons. And yes… maybe even people like me. I lost faith a long time ago. But now, I’m done watching.”

I leaned forward, voice low.

“Help me train them. Help me build something better.”

Another silence.

Then Giulia reached across the table and took my hand. Her grip was steady.

“For Tulio,” she said. “For everyone they forgot.”

And that was it.

That was the beginning of the next war.

Not with fists.

1m5rmap,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/1m5rmap/unmatched_after_date/,Unmatched after date,"TLDR: Went out on a date with someone from Hinge. Got unmatched immediately after with no explanation or seemingly reason. 

Just needed to vent my frustration/exasperation. I had been chatting with this guy on Hinge for over a week. One of the key things he mentioned was that he was looking for emotional maturity. Oddly enough, he only checks his Hinge once a day, which made conversation more like a relay than a constant back and forth banter.  We finally decide to meet for coffee since he had plans already. We met, and he seemed to be doing a lot more listening than talking - which is okay.  I paid for the coffee to be polite, and I expected that I would be seeing him again. 

We went for a walk around the block and talked the entire time. Again, mostly me doing the talking. Once again, emotional maturity was brought into the conversation. I reflected upon my experiences - both dating and personal/social life. Finally walk him to his car and I get back to mine. After a while when I got back home, I saw that he had unmatched me. 

That feeling sucked. It left me wondering if I wasn’t good enough, if I presented myself the wrong way or if I said the wrong thing. I know he’s not the guy for me if he’s judging harshly or jumping to conclusions. But it still sucks to be left in the dark like that. And for someone looking for emotional maturity, he sure doesn’t have it. I know he’s not obligated to give me a reason or explanation. Doesn’t help me with what I left.

# Best Outdoor Swivel Glider Chair 2025: Reviews & Top picks

The outdoor furniture market is constantly evolving, with homeowners and renters alike seeking comfortable and stylish additions to their patios, decks, and gardens. Among the most sought-after pieces are swivel glider chairs, which offer a relaxing rocking motion combined with the versatility of a swivel base. These chairs provide a perfect spot to enjoy the outdoors, whether reading a book, sipping a beverage, or simply enjoying the view. As we approach 2025, several models are emerging as top contenders, each offering unique features and benefits to enhance your outdoor living experience. This comprehensive guide will explore the best outdoor swivel glider chairs available, providing detailed reviews and insightful comparisons to help you make an informed decision.

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of an outdoor swivel glider chair depends largely on its construction, materials, and overall design. Each feature plays a crucial role in determining the chair's durability, comfort, and suitability for various outdoor environments.

**Frame Material:**

The frame of an outdoor swivel glider chair is the foundation of its stability and longevity. Most high-quality chairs utilize either aluminum or steel frames. Aluminum is lightweight and inherently rust-resistant, making it a popular choice for coastal areas or regions with high humidity. Steel, on the other hand, offers greater strength and can support higher weight capacities, but it requires a protective powder coating to prevent rust. The specific coating process and its resistance to scratches and chipping are also worth considering as they directly impact the frame’s lifespan.

**Fabric and Cushioning:**

The fabric and cushioning determine the chair's comfort and resistance to weather elements. Outdoor fabrics like Sunbrella and Olefin are highly sought after due to their excellent UV resistance, preventing fading and degradation from prolonged sun exposure.These fabrics are also water-resistant, speedy-drying, and easy to clean, which minimizes maintenance. The cushioning material, typically foam or a combination of foam and fiberfill, impacts the overall comfort level. High-density foam provides better support and retains its shape longer, while fiberfill offers a softer, more plush feel.

**swivel and Gliding Mechanism:**

The swivel and gliding mechanism are essential to the chair's functionality and enjoyment. A smooth, quiet, and reliable swivel is crucial for ease of movement and a comfortable user experience. The swivel mechanism should ideally be constructed from high-quality bearings to ensure long-term durability. The gliding action, often achieved through a set of linkages or a rocker base, should be equally smooth and consistent, providing a gentle and relaxing motion. The quality of these mechanisms directly affects the longevity and overall enjoyment of the chair.

**Weather Resistance:**

Outdoor furniture is inevitably exposed to the elements,so weather resistance is a critical factor. Beyond the fabric and frame materials, other components, such as hardware and joints, should be designed to withstand moisture, temperature fluctuations, and UV exposure.Stainless steel hardware is preferred for its rust resistance, while properly sealed joints prevent water from seeping into the chair's structure. A chair's overall design should promote water drainage and minimize the accumulation of debris, ensuring that it remains in good condition for years to come.

**Weight Capacity and Dimensions:**

Weight capacity and dimensions substantially impact the chair's suitability for different users and spaces. Consider the maximum weight that the chair can safely support to ensure comfort and safety. A higher weight capacity generally indicates a more robust construction.The dimensions of the chair, including seat width, seat depth, and back height, affect the ergonomic comfort and overall fit for different body types. Measure your available outdoor space to ensure the chair fits comfortably without overcrowding the area.

## Core Benefits

A high-quality outdoor swivel glider chair offers numerous practical benefits, enhancing your outdoor relaxation and enjoyment.

**Enhanced Comfort and relaxation:** The combination of the gentle gliding motion and the 360-degree swivel capability provides unparalleled comfort and relaxation. The gliding motion soothes and calms, while the swivel allows you to easily turn and enjoy different views or engage in conversations without needing to move the entire chair. This feature is particularly beneficial for those who enjoy spending extended periods outdoors.

**Increased Versatility:** The swivel function allows the chair to be placed in more dynamic outdoor settings. Unlike stationary chairs, a swivel glider can easily adapt to different seating arrangements or provide a comfortable vantage point for various activities, such as watching children play, enjoying a garden, or entertaining guests.The ability to effortlessly change direction enhances the chair's versatility and usefulness in different outdoor scenarios.

**Improved Ergonomics:** Many modern outdoor swivel glider chairs are designed with ergonomic considerations in mind.Features like lumbar support, contoured seats, and armrests contribute to proper posture and reduce strain on the back and neck. This ensures that you can relax comfortably for hours without experiencing discomfort. Ergonomic design promotes a healthier and more enjoyable outdoor experience.

**Stylish Outdoor Aesthetic:** Outdoor swivel glider chairs are available in a wide range of styles,from classic to contemporary,allowing you to complement your patio,deck,or garden decor. The right chair can add a touch of elegance and sophistication to your outdoor space, enhancing its overall aesthetic appeal.The variety of available colors, patterns, and materials allows you to find a chair that perfectly matches your personal taste and enhances the overall design of your outdoor living area.

## FAQs Section

**How do I clean and maintain an outdoor swivel glider chair?**
Regular cleaning is essential to maintain the appearance and longevity of your outdoor swivel glider chair. Wipe down the frame and fabric with a mild soap and water solution to remove dirt and debris. For more stubborn stains, use a specialized outdoor fabric cleaner. Regularly inspect and lubricate the swivel and gliding mechanism to ensure smooth operation. Store the chair indoors or cover it during harsh weather to protect it from the elements.

**what is the average lifespan of an outdoor swivel glider chair?**
The lifespan of an outdoor swivel glider chair depends on several factors, including the quality of materials, the frequency of use, and the level of maintenance. Generally, a well-maintained chair constructed from high-quality materials can last for 5-10 years or even longer. Regular cleaning, proper storage, and timely repairs can significantly extend its lifespan.**Can I replace the cushions on my outdoor swivel glider chair?**
Yes, most outdoor swivel glider chairs have replaceable cushions. You can typically purchase replacement cushions from the manufacturer or from third-party retailers that specialize in outdoor furniture accessories. When selecting replacement cushions, ensure that they are made from weather-resistant materials like Sunbrella or Olefin and that they are the correct size and shape for your chair.

## Competitor Comparison

Let's compare three outdoor swivel glider chairs to highlight their strengths and weaknesses.

### Product Comparison Overview

#### Patio Sense Coconino Wicker Swivel Glider

   **Frame Material:** Powder-coated steel frame
   **Fabric:** Weather-resistant polyester
   **Swivel/Gliding:** Smooth 360-degree swivel and gentle gliding motion

#### Highwood Hamilton Swivel Glider

   **Frame Material:** Recycled plastic lumber (Highwood USA)
   **Fabric:** Not applicable (designed to be used without cushions, though most fit a standard cushion)
   **Swivel/gliding:** Durable swivel and smooth gliding action

#### POLYWOOD Nautical Swivel Glider

   **Frame Material:** Recycled plastic lumber (POLYWOOD)
   **fabric:** Not applicable (designed to be used without cushions)
*   **Swivel/Gliding:** Reliable swivel and smooth gliding mechanism

### Key Differences Summary

The Patio Sense Coconino offers a customary wicker aesthetic with a comfortable cushion, making it suitable for those prioritizing style and comfort. However, its steel frame may require more diligent maintenance compared to the other options. The Highwood Hamilton emphasizes durability and eco-friendliness with its recycled plastic lumber construction, though some may miss the added comfort of a cushion. The POLYWOOD Nautical strikes a balance between durability and style and is resistant to the elements. For those prioritizing low maintenance and longevity, the POLYWOOD Nautical or Highwood Hamilton are excellent choices, requiring only occasional cleaning.

My question about this dentist is what kind of business are they operating? Is this dentist clinic operating a money laundering scheme for human trafficking?

I went to this dentist clinic to get invisalign, I was a teenager at the time and when I arrived at the parking lot, i saw this guy in a car trying to become close to this girl and the girl looked drowsy and tried to push him away which i found weird. When I walked in, there was no patients and the only employees that were there was 2 people and on top of that, in the waiting room they were serving chips, water, and coffee….. AT A DENTAL CLINIC !! when i entered the dentist chair room this dentist who was a male adult looked at my information to get to know me and my medical history so he knew that I was a teen, he was calling me beautiful numerous times, kept obsessing that i was young and small and was being creepy. When me and the dentist were on the topic of invisalign, he offered to give me a HUGE discount on invisalign and if i recommend someone to that same clinic, then they would give me a discount for my next visit. I had to get 2 of my teeth removed in order to stop my teeth from crowding but coincidentally, those 2 teeth had cavities, when he numbed me and removed both of my teeth, he didnt give it back to me. The next day, i showed up and there was no patients and i was the only one, when I was waiting for my appointment, i noticed that there was a large mirrored window and when i looked in, there was 2 messy beds and 1 light bulb hanging off of the ceiling. So when i put everything together, i think that this is probably not a legit dentist",1,1753124018.0,LawyerAdvice,3,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Arizona Diamondbacks vs. Houston Astros: A Same-Game Parlay Masterclass**  
*Where pitching meets poetry, and spreads meet sarcasm.*

---

### 1. Parse the Odds: A Tale of Two Teams

The Arizona Diamondbacks (-152) enter as favorites, but let’s not confuse “favorite” with “favorite child.” Their 4.58 ERA (25th in MLB) is about as reliable as a umbrella in a tornado. Starter Zac Gallen, with a 5.40 ERA, looks like a man who’s forgotten how to pitch but hasn’t told the scoreboard yet. Meanwhile, the Houston Astros (+220) are underdogs with a 3.65 ERA (6th in MLB) and a knack for winning 58.1% of their underdog games this season. That’s not luck—it’s *strategy*.

**Key Stats to Note**:

* **Arizona’s Offense**: Fourth in MLB at 5.2 R/G. They don’t need a net to catch flies—they just need a net to catch *Gallen’s* mistakes.
* **Houston’s Pitching**: 9.8 K/9. They don’t strike out batters—they send them to strikeout *college*.
* **Implied Probabilities**: Arizona’s -152 suggests a 60.5% chance to win, but Houston’s underdog pedigree (18-31 this season, yet 18 wins as dogs!) hints the line is skewed.

---

### 2. Digest the News: Injuries, Altuve, and Altitude

* **Arizona’s Eugenio Suárez** homered in his last game, proving that even in a desert, a man can make his own thunder. But Gallen? He’s been more “Gone with the Wind” than “Gone with the Strikeout.”
* **Houston’s Jose Altuve** has 53 RBIs, which is about 53 more reasons to check if your coffee is decaf. The Astros’ lineup isn’t flashy, but with Altuve leading the charge, they’re the definition of “small but *mighty*.”
* **Injury Report**: No major absences, but if Gallen’s ERA were a person, it’d be in a wheelchair with a neck brace.

---

### 3. Humorous Spin: Baseball as Absurdism

Arizona’s pitching staff is like a sieve that’s been challenged by a sieve convention. Their 25th-ranked ERA means their pitchers throw so poorly, even the baseballs are filing for restraining orders. Houston’s staff? They’re the calm bartender who’s seen everything and still has your ex’s number.

1m5rg7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1m5rg7j/broke_or_struggling_with_money_try_using_cash/,"Broke or struggling with money? Try using cash. seriously, it helped me more than any app","I’m not great with money. I’ve tried all the budgeting apps, spreadsheet templates, even those “track every cent” methods. Never stuck.

What finally helped? Just using **cash**.

Here’s how:

1. You feel it when you spend it.

Swiping a card or tapping your phone doesn’t feel like real money. But handing over a €10 bill? That hits different. It makes you think: *Do I really need this?* And honestly, I say no more often now.

2. You can’t overspend what you don’t have.

When I get paid, I take out the amount I can spend on groceries, fun, etc. Once the cash is gone, it’s gone. No overdraft fees, no surprise “how did I spend €300 this weekend?” moments.

3. You’ll start noticing your spending patterns.

I used to spend a little here and there every day, coffee, snacks, random stuff, and by the end of the week, I was broke without knowing where it went. With cash, you literally *see* your wallet getting lighter. It makes you more aware.

4. It’s great for budgeting.

Try the envelope method. Label envelopes like “Groceries,” “Going Out,” “Gas,” etc., and put a set amount of cash in each. It’s simple and works, no apps required.

If you're always broke a few days after payday, or you feel like money just disappears, give cash a try for a week or two. No need to go full cash-only, but use it for daily stuff. It helped me get out of the cycle of constant overdrafts and impulsive spending.

Anyone else tried this and noticed a difference?",8,1753123889.0,povertyfinance,3,0.79,False
1m5rg61,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComfortLevelPod/comments/1m5rg61/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_grandpas_gardener/,AITA: For Refusing to Let My Grandpa’s “Gardener” Take Over the House?,"Hey Comfort Level Podcast—this has been brewing in me for a while, and I finally decided it’s time to spill. You were my #1 most-listened-to podcast on Spotify Wrapped last year, so obviously I trust you with this unhinged timeline from my life… and me questioning whether or not I am, in fact, the asshole.

All names have been changed. I’m using a throwaway account because I may or may not be deeply embarrassed by the feral behavior I’m about to confess. I know this is a kind community, but please be kind—or I will, in fact, vomit from overthinking. *(Joking. Mostly.)*

I (28F) wasn’t super close with my grandparents growing up. But when my grandmother passed away suddenly, it became painfully obvious that my grandfather was struggling—especially with, well, basic functioning. Picture a Danny DeVito-shaped man with Elvis hair (box-dyed black, of course) who has asked more than once how many Tylenol he should take for a headache. He was completely lost.

So I offered to help out once a week. He’s in his mid-80s but still works during the day *(he likes to stay busy and moving)*, which made it easy for me to come in the mornings or whenever I wanted. He also pays me, which is a huge help financially. I handled the laundry, cleaned floors, changed sheets, reorganized, decluttered—you name it. He told me I could do whatever I wanted with the space. My grandma, who had been a stay-at-home spouse, had collected *a lot* of stuff over the years. He actually encouraged me to move furniture and make changes to “freshen up the house.”

And honestly? It felt good. Therapeutic, even. I never really had a relationship with my grandfather before, but we started bonding. I’d go over in the morning, clean, start dinner, and wait for him and my parents for our weekly family dinner. It was sweet and calm and felt like something we all needed.

Then came **Janet**.

Janet *(mid-60's F)* was originally hired to pull weeds in the garden. She was about 15 years younger than my grandfather and gave off big “live, laugh, lavender oil” energy—quirky, earthy, overly sweet. We thought it was nice that he had company during the day when we couldn’t be there. And honestly, at first her energy was endearing.

Then she started sticking around after her ""shifts"".

At first, she’d join us before dinner to say hi to my parents and catch up. No big deal. But my grandfather was clearly smitten. After a week or so he’d practically drag her to the table to join us for dinner with a glass of wine in hand, grinning ear to ear. Then it became routine for her to join us, always saying the same line *""oh, this looks delish!""*. Then it would be every morning. I’d walk in to find her already there—not in the garden but in the house. I'd find her brewing coffee, reading the newspaper like she lived there, already comfortable. Then she started staying the night. Then several nights. Then most nights.

I'd find her wearing my grandma’s old bathrobe and *“helping”* with the decluttering—digging through drawers and cabinets because *“he asked her to.”* Sometimes I wouldn't even know she was there until I would walk in because she started borrowing my grandma’s old car because hers was *“in the shop.”*

She had her own apartment *(allegedly)*, but it started feeling like she was basically living there full-time within a few months. She had picked her own bathroom and a bedroom for her to *""get ready""*. She would even close the doors like it was her personal space and would say *""don't worry about cleaning my rooms. I do that myself.""* She filled the closets with her clothes. She brought in trinkets from her own place to *“make it feel more like hers.”* Oh, and my grandfather gave her a credit card for *“household needs,”* but I often saw grocery bags in her car that I’m 99% sure went to her apartment.

Still—I kept my cool. She made my grandfather happy and was staying out of my way.

Until she wasn’t.

She started hovering when I was cleaning. Her comments were casual at first: *“What product are you using on the floors?"" or  “Oh… you do the \*cleaning\* like that? You should try this way.”*

It even got to a point where she was texting me. My grandfather went to Florida for a few weeks and asked me to house-sit. During that time, she texted me constantly. Things I’d already been doing for the past year. Suddenly it was all reminders and “tips” and “don’t forgets.” It got under my skin.

Then one day she said: *“Your grandfather told me he doesn’t like how much you’ve changed the house. He said it doesn’t feel like his anymore. He didn’t want to hurt your feelings, so he asked me to tell you.”*

Umm. What? I felt awful. Anybody who knows him, knows he is not the confrontational type and avoids anything uncomfortable so this could very well be on-brand for him. Out of guilt, I stopped rearranging furniture and just stuck to basic cleaning. But then… weird stuff started happening. I’d leave, come back the next week, and things would be different. Picture frames turned. Chairs slightly moved. At first, I thought it was my aunt or someone else in the family—we all have keys. So I’d quietly put things back because I didn't want the blame on me. Then it’d happen again.

Eventually, Janet admitted it: she’d been moving everything—and claimed my grandfather was helping her do it.

Then she started getting bolder.

For instance, she started hiding furniture she didn't like. She removed two antique armchairs that belonged to my great-grandmother and hid them in the basement. She took down photos of my grandmother and family members she didn’t like and stuffed them into cupboards in-between towels. She even took all the window screens off the windows because they “ruined the aesthetic” and hid them from me because I love opening the windows on my days there for fresh air.

One time she even said I was ironing wrong and left a note to let *her* do it instead because my grandfather would prefer it.

But the final straw? She removed all of my great-grandfather’s original paintings—including several of my grandmother that he’d done himself—from the walls of what she had now dubbed *“her office,”* and stashed them in the cold, damp cellar. As an artist, I was *livid*. Not only were they emotionally valuable to me and my family, but they’re pieces that need to be stored *properly* to avoid damage.

That’s when I confronted my grandfather directly. And his response?

>

He begged me not to quit despite my obvious discomfort. Told me Janet wasn’t replacing me. That he wanted me there. Classic avoidant grandparent energy—keeping everyone calm but solving nothing.

And me? I didn’t want to cause a scene. I have awful anxiety around conflict and sudden changes. So… I decided to stay.

**So… AITA for still being there, still cleaning, and maybe getting a little petty later on?**

Thanks for reading if you made it this far. I genuinely appreciate it, and there is **so much more** to this story—I’m happy to spill more if anyone’s interested.",3,1753123886.0,ComfortLevelPod,7,0.72,False

## key features Analysis

The top laundry detergents of 2025 offer a blend of innovative technologies and time-tested ingredients. These detergents differentiate themselves through concentrated formulas, advanced enzyme blends, environmentally friendly components, and user-friendly packaging.

**Concentrated Formula**

A concentrated formula is a hallmark of many top-tier detergents in 2025. these formulas pack more cleaning power into smaller doses, reducing the amount of product needed per load. Typically, a concentrated detergent requires only one to two tablespoons per regular load compared to the quarter or half cup often needed for non-concentrated versions. This leads to significantly less packaging waste and increased cost-effectiveness over time.

**Advanced Enzyme Blend**

Modern detergents utilize advanced enzyme blends to target and break down various types of stains. Protease enzymes focus on protein-based stains like blood and grass, amylase targets starch-based stains such as food spills, and lipase tackles grease and oil stains. Cellulase enzymes help to smooth cotton fibers,reducing pilling and fuzz.the precision and efficacy of these enzyme blends significantly enhance the detergent's stain-removing capabilities.

**Eco-Friendly Components**

Sustainability is a crucial factor for consumers, driving detergent manufacturers to incorporate eco-friendly components. Biodegradable surfactants derived from plant-based sources reduce the environmental impact compared to customary petroleum-based surfactants. Additionally, many detergents are now phosphate-free and packaged in recyclable or compostable materials, aligning with environmental conservation.

**User-Friendly Packaging**

advances in packaging design enhance convenience and reduce mess. Detergents are available in various formats, including single-dose pods, liquid bottles with no-drip spouts, and powder boxes with measuring scoops. Single-dose pods precisely measure the right amount of detergent for each load, eliminating guesswork and spills. Bottles designed with ergonomic handles and no-drip spouts prevent accidental pouring and wastage.

Key features of the best laundry detergents of 2025 include:

* Hypoallergenic formulas
* Cold-water effectiveness
* Colour protection technology
* Fragrance options or fragrance-free alternatives

## Core Benefits

Using the right laundry detergent provides several key benefits beyond simply cleaning clothes. The top detergents offer enhanced stain removal,garment protection,cost efficiency,and improved environmental safety.

**Superior Stain Removal**

High-quality detergents deliver superior stain removal by penetrating deep into fabric fibers and lifting away even stubborn stains.The advanced enzyme blends effectively break down and remove tough stains like red wine, coffee, and mud.Independent testing shows that leading detergents can remove over 90% of common stains in a single wash cycle, compared to older formulations.

**Garment protection**

Premium detergents help protect garments from wear and tear and color fading. Ingredients like cellulase enzymes smooth fabric fibers, reducing pilling and fuzz, while color-protecting polymers prevent dyes from bleeding and fading during washing. This extends the lifespan of clothing, keeping them looking newer and brighter for longer.

**Cost Efficiency**

Concentrated formulas and effective stain removal contribute to the cost efficiency of top-tier detergents. The need for smaller doses per load, combined with the ability to remove stains in a single wash, reduces overall detergent consumption. Furthermore, protecting garments from damage and fading minimizes the need for frequent clothing replacements, leading to long-term savings.

**Environmental Safety**

Eco-friendly detergents prioritize the safety of the habitat and the well-being of consumers. Biodegradable surfactants break down rapidly in wastewater, reducing their impact on aquatic ecosystems.Phosphate-free formulas prevent nutrient pollution in waterways, while hypoallergenic options minimize the risk of skin irritation and allergic reactions.

## FAQs Section

Choosing the right laundry detergent often involves considering specific questions and concerns. Here are some commonly asked questions about laundry detergents in 2025.

**Are these detergents safe for sensitive skin?**
Many detergents are formulated specifically for sensitive skin. Look for detergents labeled as ""hypoallergenic"" or ""fragrance-free."" These detergents are typically free of harsh chemicals,dyes,and perfumes that can cause irritation. Always check the ingredient list to ensure the detergent is free of known allergens.

**Can these detergents be used in high-efficiency (HE) washing machines?**
Yes, the top-rated detergents are designed for use in both standard and high-efficiency (HE) washing machines. HE machines use less water than traditional machines, requiring detergents that produce fewer suds to prevent residue buildup. Detergents labeled ""HE"" have low-sudsing formulas that won't damage the machine or leave excess residue on clothes.

**How do I know how much detergent to use?**
Always follow the dosage instructions on the detergent packaging. The amount of detergent needed depends on the load size, water hardness, and soil level of the clothes. Using too much detergent can leave residue on clothes and in the washing machine, while using too little may not effectively clean the clothes. Most detergents provide dosage guidelines for different load sizes and soil levels.

1m5rdi3,https://www.reddit.com/r/hemorrhoid/comments/1m5rdi3/my_banding_experience_two_grade_ii_and_one_grade/,My banding experience - two grade II and one grade III,"I had three internal hemorrhoids banded (two Grade II and one Grade III), and I wanted to share my experience.

After a consultation, I was given the option of rubber band ligation (RBL) or a stapled hemorrhoidopexy (also known as the “Longo” procedure). Banding was described to me as a 2–3 on the pain scale, with a 65% success rate. The Longo procedure was rated as a 5 on the pain scale, with a 65–85% success rate—but I would have had to wait about five months before I could have it done. The Milligan-Morgan hemorrhoidectomy was rated a 9 on the pain scale with a 99.5% success rate, but the proctologist essentially refused to perform it and strongly discouraged me from pursuing it. I don’t know if the success rates or pain levels were tailored specifically to my case.

At my very first visit, banding wasn’t an option for the Grade III hemorrhoid because its base was too large and low (as far as I understood). However, with some lifestyle changes (see the section at the end) and supplements, I managed to shrink it considerably over about a month. At that point, I scheduled the banding. The hemorrhoids were located roughly 2 cm above the pectinate line.

**Day 0**

I had a normal bowel movement a few hours before the procedure. The procedure itself was quick (\~10 minutes) and relatively painless. All three hemorrhoids were banded in the same session. Lidocaine gel was used as a local anesthetic. I drove to and from the clinic myself.

I felt fine for about three hours afterward, but then the pain began to kick in. I took some paracetamol, which helped a bit. However, a few hours later, the pain became intense. I found myself pacing back and forth, trying to distract myself. I also felt very bloated. I took more paracetamol before bed, but it didn’t help at all. I didn't sleep one single minute and seriously considered calling an ambulance. Lying down made the pain worse, regardless of position. Every time I began to doze off, rectal spasms would wake me up with sharp, sudden pain. I also felt some discomfort in my groin and testicles. No bowel movement, just lots of gas. I was able to urinate, but it took longer to start. Overall, a very rough day.

**Day +1**

Fortunately, I was able to see my proctologist the next day. I didn’t drive—just sitting in the passenger seat was painful. I expected a prescription, but he kindly examined me for free (which was both helpful and appreciated). Having an anoscope inserted one day after the procedure was painful, though.

He said the Grade III hemorrhoid (the largest one, which had two bands) was very swollen, which is typical for a few days after banding. He explained that the swelling is part of the process before they shrink. I told him it was more than discomfort—it was painful. He prescribed Toradol. The spasms continued. The groin discomfort was gone. Still no bowel movement. I slept well that night, though Toradol didn’t seem to help with the spasms or sharp pain.

**Day +2**

Had a very small bowel movement in the morning—just a few tiny pieces during two separate sessions. I felt the urge to go but couldn’t, with a general feeling of pressure and discomfort. The spasms were still very annoying. I thought I might be constipated, which is unusual for me as I usually go daily.

Thankfully, I had two more substantial bowel movements in the afternoon, which brought some relief. For the first time, I didn’t feel anything abnormal while washing my butt, which was encouraging—before that, my Grade III hemorrhoid would prolapse for a few hours after each BM. The proctologist had advised avoiding exercise for 48 hours, but I wouldn’t have been able to work out even if I wanted to.

**Day +3**

Some discomfort, but I stopped taking Toradol and paracetamol. Drove myself to a nearby mall to buy groceries. I had a few spasms while walking, but nothing too bad. I no longer felt much on the left side (where the largest hemorrhoid had been), which made me worry the band had fallen off. I still felt discomfort on the right side, where the other two were. Bowel movements were normal, though a bit uncomfortable—probably because I couldn’t fully relax.

**Day +4**

Returned to the gym and did about 20 minutes on the stairmaster along with some upper-body exercises. Wasn't up to training legs, even with machines. I continued to feel a sense of fullness in the rectal area. The most bothersome symptom was the frequent spasms—short (1–2 seconds) but painful enough to make me squirm every time. I can poop fine, it's slighty bothersome, and for some reason I have to go multiple times a day.

**Will update daily!**

**Extra: Lifestyle Changes That Made Banding Possible**

These changes were intended to shrink my largest hemorrhoid enough to make banding viable. I'm not sure if they were tailored specifically to me, and I wasn’t told to follow them forever—just in preparation for the procedure.

* Consume in moderation: coffee, spicy food, chocolate, vinegar, lemon, sparkling drinks (including sparkling water), fried foods, fatty foods, fast food, alcohol
* Eat lots of fruits and vegetables
* Drink at least 1.5–2 liters of water daily
* Use simple cooking methods (steaming, boiling, grilling)
* Take psyllium husk every morning before breakfast with a large glass of water
* Take flavonoids pills (e.g., diosmin, hesperidin) three times a day for the first six days, then once daily
* Avoid lifting heavy objects and riding bikes or motorbikes
* Avoid squats, deadlifts, or lunges of any kind (including hack squats and machine squats); leg press and similar exercises were generally fine
* Do not use toilet paper—use a bidet with gentle soap like Marseille soap; when away from home, use wet wipes
* Take sitz baths in the evening for 3–5 minutes
* Use a Squatty Potty (which I highly recommend!); avoid straining or sitting too long on the toilet",1,1753123723.0,hemorrhoid,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Giants vs. Braves: A Parlor Trick of Pitching and Power**  
The San Francisco Giants (52-48) and Atlanta Braves (43-55) collide in a clash of contrasting strengths: Giants pitching vs. Braves power. Let’s dissect this matchup with the precision of a scout and the wit of a late-night host who’s had one too many coffee-infused energy drinks.

---

### Parse the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)

The Braves enter as **-116 favorites**, which means bookmakers imply they’ve got a **53.7% chance to win**. The Giants, at **+125 underdogs**, have a **44.4% implied probability**. But here’s the twist: the Giants are **favored against the spread (-1.5 runs)** at **+155**, suggesting oddsmakers think Atlanta’s 1.5-run edge is overrated.

Key stats:

* **Giants pitching**: A **3.61 ERA** (4th in MLB) and **3.56 ERA** (3rd) depending on which stat you believe. Their starters? Hayden Birdsong (healthy, thankfully—no shoelace fumbles here).
* **Braves offense**: Leads MLB in **home runs (110)** but ranks **13th in ERA**. Matt Olson’s 18 HRs are impressive, but their starters (Bryce Elder) have a **9.4 K/9**. Sounds great until you realize their park, Truist Park, is a HR launchpad.
* **Giants’ Rafael Devers**: 17 HRs, 68 RBI. He’s the team’s offensive spark, though his batting average might resemble a rollercoaster.

The **total is set at 9.5 runs**, with **Under priced slightly better** (1.91 vs. 1.91). Given both teams’ recent struggles—Giants lost 5 straight, Braves dropped 2 of 3 to the Yankees—it’s a recipe for a low-scoring duel.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Trends, and Circuses

No major injuries listed, but context matters:

* **Giants’ losing streak**: Five games, including three to the Blue Jays. They’re like a Netflix series that suddenly becomes unwatchable.
* **Braves’ recent form**: Also shaky, with a 38-37 record when favored. Their pitchers strike out batters like they’re at a Halloween party, but their defense? A sieve with a PhD in “Oops, I’ll let this HR through.”
* **Birdsong vs. Elder**: Birdsong’s ERA is **3.89**, while Elder’s is **4.22**.

1m5ragr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1m5ragr/my_husband_found_me_crying_in_the_closet_his/,My husband found me crying in the closet.  His first words? “How do you make me look in front of my family?”,"Let’s start with this: I’m now divorced.
But surprisingly… it wasn’t my decision.

Back then, I genuinely thought we could work things out. When he told me he wanted to end it, I was stunned, very confused.

Looking back, I can say with certainty:
His choice was a gift in disguise.

…

It all started on Christmas Eve in 2023. We hosted his entire family. Our daughter was 3. When it was her bedtime, his aunt offered to put her down. I was grateful, finally a minute to relax and be with everyone. She rejoined half an hour later.

Three hours pass. His aunt realizes she lost her phone. We ring it, and find it in our daughter’s room. She’s still awake. Still watching YouTube.

I freeze. No supervision for 3 hours? No idea what she’s seen? It was Youtube. No parental control… My husband laughs, gives the phone to his aunt, and jokes, “She was still watching videos, that little monkey!”

I stay behind to comfort our daughter. Then later, I quietly ask him if we can just check the YouTube history, make sure she didn’t see anything inappropriate.

He brushes me off: “You’re making a big deal out of nothing.”

I drop it. I’m trying not to cause tension. But it keeps turning in my mind. I didn’t want to blame anyone, just wanted us to be on the same page as parents.

That night, after everyone’s asleep, I bring it up again, alone in our bedroom. I say I just wish there was more awareness around bedtime and that next time, maybe we check in before leaving a phone with a toddler.

His response?
“It’s my family. Drop it. It’s nothing. Our daughter’s fine. For god sakes, just stop talking and go to sleep.”

There was no concern. No curiosity. Just… shutdown.

I barely sleep. What happened was one thing, but his reaction to it, that’s what broke me. The next morning, I make brunch. He makes coffee, for everyone but me. He won’t look at me, and avoids me. Like I didn’t exist. Like my reaction the night before was too much… even though all I’d done was try to talk.

At that point, I knew if anyone asked how I was doing, I’d burst into tears.
So when things quieted down, I stepped into our bedroom for a moment alone.

I told myself I just needed a few deep breaths. A few seconds to collect myself and come back composed. Because that’s who I am, usually. I don’t cry easily.
But the second I closed the door behind me… I broke.

I started sobbing, uncontrollably.
So I slipped into the closet to muffle the sound. I was knees to my chest, crying like a child. That’s where he found me.

He walked in, saw me on the floor…
And just stood there.

And says:
“How do you make me look in front of my family?”

I think that’s was the moment I realized… I was completely alone in this.

He left me there.

Later that day, after everyone left, I try to bring it up calmly, telling him that, to me, his reaction seeing me in the closet wasn’t okay. He was defensive, justifying, saying I was crying over nothing, and over exaggerating. 
I tried to explain that regardless of what triggered my tears, empathy was missing and that’s what scared me. I could’ve been crying about anything. At that moment, my sister-in-law was in critical condition after a major car crash. What if I had just gotten bad news? What kind of partner responds that way?
He told me I was emotional, unstable, unworthy.

That’s when the divorce conversation officially reopened. (He had previously hinted at it, saying our intimacy was lacking. At the time, I took it seriously. I even saw a sexologist. Long story short: I tried. He didn’t. And I didn’t see that then.)

I said: “Maybe you’re right. Maybe there’s no coming back and divorce is the only option.”

He said nothing. Just took our daughter to his family’s second Christmas party and left me there alone.

The next day was the silent treatment. He always stayed near our daughter and I while working at his computer, but didn’t speak. Even when I offered him lunch, he answered with a head-shake.

That night, I asked for clarity. And I got it.

He told me he didn’t love me.
Hadn’t for a while.
That I lacked drive. Didn’t challenge him.
That he wanted a divorce and finally felt relief saying it being his final option.

I was heartbroken. Also ashamed. And still blaming myself… maybe I hadn’t made him feel safe to open up? Maybe I didn’t put enough effort?

But therapy helped me see clearly: I was holding all the emotional weight of the relationship (and family). He’d been checked out for months, maybe years. Constant judgment. Little criticisms. Emotional withdrawal. Subtle, but unrelenting.

I was shutting down because I had no space left.

His divorce? A blessing in disguise.

Since then…. 
No one from his family ever reached out. After eleven years together, just silence.
Well, except his grandmother, who accused me of theft and bad intentions. Apparently, him hiring a lawyer and learning what he legally owes me makes me the villain.

I’ve learned a lot since then. About enmeshed family systems. About emotional detachment. About how some people rewrite reality because it serves them better that way.

And yet… I still catch myself wondering:
Did that really happen the way I remember it?

Because he was so charming, so put-together, I’ve heard it more than once: “Their must be missing context.”

And every time, a part of me feels like I’m making it up.

And maybe that’s why I’m sharing this here.
To put the truth somewhere outside my head.
To leave a record that says:
This did happen. I was there. And it wasn’t okay.

Has anyone else ever felt that?
The strange fear that no one would believe you, even if you had proof of it?

Then on the second date, we went out for coffee and shared a starter. Again, no initiative from her side to offer or split. Later, we grabbed some street snacks, and still same—no sign ...even acknowledging the gesture.

The same thing repeated on the third date too—another coffee meet, and it just felt like I was being taken for granted.

To be honest, I started noticing this after the second date, and I’ve been trying to understand if I’m overthinking it. We’ve known each other for just about a month, and in my past relationships, this was never the case. My exes always made an effort, and it reflected their values.

## Key features Analysis

The Zebra toothpaste boasts several noteworthy features designed to improve oral hygiene.

**Unique Striped Formula:** The hallmark of Zebra toothpaste is its visually appealing striped design. This isn’t merely for aesthetics. The colored stripes represent different formulations, typically one focusing on whitening and another on cleaning, that are dispensed simultaneously during brushing. This dual-action approach aims to provide a more comprehensive cleaning experience compared to single-formula toothpastes. The distinct separation and combination of these formulas is a core aspect of Zebra toothpaste's design.

**Fluoride Protection:** Like most mainstream toothpastes, Zebra toothpaste includes fluoride. This is a critical ingredient for cavity prevention. Fluoride strengthens tooth enamel, making it more resistant to acid attacks from bacteria and sugars in the mouth. The specific concentration of fluoride in Zebra toothpaste typically adheres to recommended levels set by dental associations, ensuring optimal protection against tooth decay.

**Whitening Agents:** Zebra toothpaste often incorporates various whitening agents to help remove surface stains and brighten teeth. These agents may include mild abrasives, which physically polish the teeth, or chemical whiteners that break down stain molecules. The effectiveness of these whitening agents can vary, but they contribute to the overall goal of achieving a brighter smile wiht regular use.

**Enamel Strengthening Technology:** Some variations of Zebra toothpaste contain specialized ingredients designed to strengthen and remineralize tooth enamel. These may include calcium phosphate compounds or other minerals that help replenish the enamel lost due to acid erosion. This feature aims to provide long-term protection against tooth sensitivity and damage. These ingredients work by depositing minerals back onto the tooth surface,reinforcing its structure.

**Multiple Flavor Options:** Zebra toothpaste is available in a variety of flavors, catering to different preferences. These range from classic mint to more adventurous options like fruit blends. The availability of multiple flavors can make brushing more enjoyable, encouraging consistent oral hygiene habits.Having a variety of options helps find the perfect taste for each person.

Key features of the Zebra toothpaste include:

* Visually stimulating striped design
* Fluoride protection for cavity prevention
* Whitening agents for surface stain removal
* Enamel strengthening technology for better oral health
* Various flavor options

## Core benefits

Zebra toothpaste offers several benefits that make it an attractive option for consumers looking to improve their oral hygiene.

**Improved Cleaning Efficiency:** The combination of cleaning and whitening formulas in a single toothpaste streamlines the brushing process, purportedly delivering a more comprehensive clean compared to using separate products. Users have reported a noticeably cleaner and fresher feeling after brushing, suggesting that the dual-action approach is effective in removing plaque and debris. This results in less build-up between dental cleanings.

**Enhanced Whitening Effect:** Zebra toothpaste's whitening agents contribute to a brighter smile by removing surface stains. Over time,users may experience a gradual betterment in the whiteness of their teeth,leading to a more confident and attractive appearance. This effect is especially beneficial for individuals who consume staining substances such as coffee, tea, or red wine.

**Greater User Engagement:** The visually appealing striped design and variety of flavors can make brushing more enjoyable, particularly for children and individuals who find traditional toothpaste boring. This increased engagement can encourage more consistent and thorough brushing habits, leading to improved oral hygiene outcomes overall. Engaging designs can make teeth-brushing time fun for all ages.

**Strengthened Enamel and Reduced Sensitivity:** With regular use of fluoride, Zebra toothpaste helps to strengthen tooth enamel, making it more resistant to acid attacks and decay. Enamel strengthening technology helps to solidify the enamel. Certain formulations may contain ingredients that help reduce tooth sensitivity, providing relief for individuals who experience discomfort when consuming hot or cold foods and beverages.

Zebra toothpaste typically does not contain any harmful ingredients. Though, it is indeed always advisable to check the product label and ingredient list to ensure that you are not allergic or sensitive to any of the components. Consumers that are sensitive to fluoride or similar ingredients should check the label. Look out for any ingredients that might trigger allergies.**How often should I use Zebra Toothpaste?**

1m5r9d6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1m5r9d6/uncover_if_the_nespresso_vertuo_pop_coffee_maker/,Uncover if the Nespresso Vertuo Pop+ Coffee Maker lives up to its reviews!,"Having tested the **Nespresso ENV92BCA** for the past few weeks, I’m ready to share my experience—flaws, highlights, quirks, and all. This coffee maker, also known as the **Nespresso Vertuo Pop+**, is a compact delight for any coffee aficionado living in a small space or simply wanting simplicity without sacrificing quality. As someone who uses coffee machines daily and thrives on a good espresso, I had high expectations. Did it deliver? Mostly, yes. But let's dig into the specifics to see exactly where it shines and where it doesn't quite brew up perfection.  

**Compact and Stylish Design**  
The first thing to catch my eye was how stunningly compact the machine is. Measuring just 14""D x 8.6""W x 10.4""H, I had no trouble fitting it into my crowded kitchen. Its glossy finish gives it a premium look that complements its sleek licorice black color. And, might I add, with eight bright colors available, you can match this coffee maker to just about any decor. It’s not just a functional appliance; it’s practically kitchen art. However, the lightweight 7.9-pound build raised some questions about durability at first—all answered once I started using it (spoiler: it’s sturdier than it seems).  

**Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Connectivity**  
Here’s something I didn’t expect to care about but ended up loving: its Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity. Through syncing, I could ensure my coffee experience was always updated thanks to automatic software upgrades. Imagine my surprise when I realized how these updates optimize performance and introduce new coffee options. It seems like a minor feature, but knowing my coffee maker gets smarter over time feels oddly satisfying.  

[Check Nespresso ENV92BCA price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0c3p9p7b3/)  

**Exceptional Coffee Options**  
Flexibility is where the Nespresso Vertuo Pop+ really wins. This machine can brew six coffee sizes: everything from a quick ristretto shot to a long alto or cold brew-style coffee. My mornings are espresso-heavy, but my partner swears by their mug-sized brew. Both types come out aromatic, full-bodied, and rich, thanks to its capsule system. As for variety, Nespresso offers countless premium and flavored capsules—I've tried pumpkin spice, vanilla, and caramel. With each cup, it’s like a tiny café in your kitchen. Just be aware you’re committing to Nespresso’s proprietary capsule system, which has its pros and cons.  

**Ease of Use with a One-Touch System**  
Simplicity is key for me because mornings are hard enough. This coffee maker delivers with a single button for brewing—it doesn’t get more intuitive than that. I didn't have to wrestle with settings or navigate endless menus. While testing, I had friends over, and even the least tech-savvy among them managed to brew themselves a perfect cup on the first try. One minor gripe: cleaning the machine isn’t automated and does need manual effort, but that’s standard fare.  

**Advantages**  
- Compact and stylish design fits into tiny spaces.  
- Offers six coffee sizes to cater to personal preferences.  
- Incredible flavor variety with premium capsules.  
- Smart connectivity via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi for updates.  

**Drawbacks**  
- Reliance on proprietary capsules can limit flexibility (and your wallet).  
- Manual cleaning could be more convenient.  
- Might feel lightweight to some users, though it’s stable once placed.  

**Competing Products**  
It’s impossible to discuss coffee makers at this price point without bringing up the Keurig K-Café and the Breville Bambino Plus. The Keurig offers more capsule brands and greater affordability for pods overall. However, in terms of coffee quality, the Nespresso outshines—it’s not even a debate for taste and crema consistency. As for the Breville, it delivers more control with its semi-automatic setup for people who are coffee purists. That said, it’s bulkier and requires more effort to operate. If convenience blended with high-end coffee is your goal, the Vertuo Pop+ hits the sweet spot.  

**Affordable Quality**  
For its mix of premium features—Bluetooth/Wi-Fi, stylish design, and exceptional coffee brewing—this product offers great value. It costs more than basic pod machines, but the taste difference is tangible. Every capsule feels crafted, like you’re unwrapping a special coffee experience. Is it worth it? If you appreciate compact designs, smart features, and variety, absolutely. However, keep your long-term capsule budget in mind.

Thought I’d share my story and could help with any questions. This past year I’ve done a lot of soul searching and really put my health at the forefront. I’ve lost 100 pounds and dropped my body fat from 36 to 17%. I’ve been full blown addicted for 15 years every single day after HS. Some days I would drink close to a gallon of plain black coffee, most days 32-64oz.  So when I decided to have my wisdom teeth pulled I figured it would be the “perfect” time to quit caffeine. I figured I would already be in pain and the meds would help mask some of the physical pain. I was WRONG. 4 days in and I got every single withdrawal symptom. It lasted for about a month. One of the main reasons i wanted to quit is I thought it would help my TMJ. Anyone that has this knows how big of a b**** it is. Unfortunately I still have it but I don’t think I clench anymore at night. Caffeine is like dumping gasoline on the fire fyi for you clenchers. I also am
Currently recovering from septoplasty/turbinate reduction surgery so maybe that’s what caused clenching too. Anyways on to the pros/cons. PROS; 1) less angry. I would flip out for no reason when I’d be amped out. 2) better cortisol numbers 3) energy levels are more “neutral”. 4) sleep has been MINIMALLY better (this has been my biggest issue). I really thought my sleep would get fixed as I do everything correctly. 5) better skin? Multiple people have commented how much younger I look. Maybe it’s losing weight, red light, and no coffee lol. CONS; 1) not as alert and sometimes forgetful. This is really it. Do I miss it? YES. When I’m feeling down I instantly feel like getting a cup but resist. It’s not easy. I also quit nicotine years ago and this is way harder for me. Never would’ve thought that. As others have stated, IT DOES GET BETTER. Just real slow.

But I was thinking within consciousness there are many different modalities of perception and many different specific qualia within one modality and I don't think you can reduce any qualia to another. Like you can't get the color red from the color green or from smell or touch or taste or proprioception etc. Red is  an axiom/part of the reduction set, so is green, so is blue and yellow, so is the smell of coffee or the sensation of your hands being above your head etc. I think there are certainly smells that are composed of more fundamental smells maybe. Also I sometimes think that fear and anger share some quality, like they are both a sort of dissonant energy, but one is mixed with uncertainty or small ego on something (fear) while anger is mixed with confidence or something.

So from this perspective the ""reduction set"" or whatever the term was for the axioms of some metaphysical/ontological model, is quite large. There are so many different qualia and probably so many more we never experience in  the life on Earth, perhaps there are infinite non-reducible qualia.... that certainly would not be a very parsimonious theory to hold.",1,1753123366.0,analyticidealism,4,0.67,False

Over the last several months or so (probably longer), I’ve noticed that while I’m not feeling depressed per se, a have become very robotic with little to no emotional range. Just a permanent “meh” mood. I also lack motivation or drive to do hardly anything other than play video games and doomscroll (I don’t currently have a full-time job or go to school, I just work meager part-time hours).

But surprisingly… it wasn’t my decision. 

It all started on Christmas Eve in 2023. We hosted his entire family. Our daughter was 3. When it was her bedtime, his aunt offered to put her down. I was grateful, finally a minute to relax and be with everyone. She rejoined half an hour later.

Three hours pass. His aunt realizes she lost her phone. We ring it, and find it in our daughter’s room. She’s still awake. Still watching YouTube.

I freeze. No supervision for 3 hours? No idea what she’s seen? It was Youtube. No parental control… My husband laughs, gives the phone to his aunt, and jokes, “She was still watching videos, that little monkey!”

I stay behind to comfort our daughter. Then later, I quietly ask him if we can just check the YouTube history, make sure she didn’t see anything inappropriate.

He brushes me off: “You’re making a big deal out of nothing.”

I drop it. I’m trying not to cause tension. But it keeps turning in my mind. I didn’t want to blame anyone, just wanted us to be on the same page as parents.

That night, after everyone’s asleep, I bring it up again, alone in our bedroom. I say I just wish there was more awareness around bedtime and that next time, maybe we check in before leaving a phone with a toddler.

His response?
“It’s my family. Drop it. It’s nothing. Our daughter’s fine. For god sakes, just stop talking and go to sleep.”

There was no concern. No curiosity. Just… shutdown.

I barely sleep. What happened was one thing, but his reaction to it, that’s what broke me. The next morning, I make brunch. He makes coffee, for everyone but me. He won’t look at me, and avoids me. Like I didn’t exist. Like my reaction the night before was too much… even though all I’d done was try to talk.

At that point, I knew if anyone asked how I was doing, I’d burst into tears.
So when things quieted down, I stepped into our bedroom for a moment alone.

I told myself I just needed a few deep breaths. A few seconds to collect myself and come back composed. Because that’s who I am, usually. I don’t cry easily.
But the second I closed the door behind me… I broke.

I started sobbing, uncontrollably.
So I slipped into the closet to muffle the sound. I was knees to my chest, crying like a child. That’s where he found me.

He walked in, saw me on the floor…
And just stood there.

And says:
“How do you make me look in front of my family?”

I think that’s was the moment I realized… I was completely alone in this. It wasn’t the first time we’d clashed on parenting, but I could never talk about it. I was completely ignored. As subtle as his control had been, he expected things to go his way. Always.

He left me there.

Later that day, after everyone left, I try to bring it up calmly, telling him that, to me, his reaction seeing me in the closet wasn’t okay. He was defensive, justifying, saying I was crying over nothing, and over exaggerating. 
I tried to explain that regardless of what triggered my tears, empathy was missing and that’s what scared me. I could’ve been crying about anything. (At that moment, my sister-in-law was in critical condition after a major car crash. What if I had just gotten bad news?)
He told me I was emotional, unstable, unworthy.

That’s when the divorce conversation officially reopened. (He had previously hinted at it, saying our intimacy was lacking. At the time, I took it seriously. I even saw a sexologist. Long story short: I tried. He didn’t. And I didn’t see that then.)

I said: “Maybe you’re right. Maybe there’s no coming back and divorce is the only option.”

He said nothing. Just took our daughter to his family’s. Left me there alone on Christmas night.

The next day was the silent treatment. He always stayed near our daughter and I, while working at his computer, but didn’t speak. Even when I offered him lunch, he answered with a head-shake.

That night, I asked for clarity. And I got it.

He told me he didn’t love me.
Hadn’t for a while.
That I lacked drive. Didn’t challenge him.
That he wanted a divorce and finally felt relief saying it being his final option.

I was heartbroken. Also ashamed. And still blaming myself… maybe I hadn’t made him feel safe to open up? Maybe I didn’t put enough effort?

But therapy helped me see clearly: I was holding all the emotional weight of the relationship (and family). He’d been checked out for months, maybe years. Constant judgment. Little criticisms. Emotional withdrawal. Subtle, but unrelenting.

I was shutting down because I had no space left.

His divorce? A blessing in disguise.

Since then, things escalated a lot. Apparently, him hiring a lawyer and learning what he legally owes me makes me the villain.

Yet… I still catch myself wondering:
Did that really happen the way I remember it?

Because he was so charming, so put-together, I’ve heard it more than once: “Their must be missing context.”

And every time, a part of me feels like I’m making it up.

And maybe that’s why I’m sharing this here.
To put the truth somewhere outside my head.
To leave a record that says:
This did happen. I was there. And it wasn’t okay.

Has anyone else ever felt that?
The strange fear that no one would believe you, even if you had proof of it? Abuse so subtle that you doubt it yourself?

## Key Features Analysis

The Port Authority polo shirt owes its widespread appeal to a combination of well-engineered features. These characteristics contribute to its overall value proposition,offering a balance of comfort,functionality,and cost-effectiveness.

**Material Composition:** A detailed look at the fabric composition reveals a blend of cotton and polyester. Commonly,a 65/35 or 50/50 blend is used to achieve a soft feel with enhanced durability. The specific fabric weight typically ranges from 5 ounces to 6.5 ounces, providing a considerable yet breathable fabric ideal for extended wear. This blend minimizes shrinking and wrinkling, making it easy to maintain a professional appearance.

**Stain-Release Technology:** Most modern Port Authority polo shirts incorporate advanced stain-release technology. This feature helps to repel common stains like coffee, grease, and ink, significantly improving the garment's longevity. The technology works by creating a protective barrier on the fabric's surface, preventing stains from penetrating deeply into the fibers. This makes it much easier to launder and maintain a clean, crisp look, even after multiple wears.**Moisture-wicking Properties:** Many Port Authority polo shirt models are designed with moisture-wicking properties. This is achieved through the use of specialized polyester yarns that draw sweat away from the skin. The moisture then evaporates quickly, keeping the wearer cool and comfortable, even in warm conditions. This feature is especially valuable for individuals who are active or work in environments where they might potentially be exposed to heat or humidity.

**Reinforced Construction:** Key stress points, such as the collar and placket, feature reinforced construction. This involves additional stitching and durable button attachments to withstand frequent wear and washing. The side seams are frequently enough double-needle stitched to enhance their strength and prevent unraveling. These details contribute to the shirt's overall durability and ensure that it maintains its shape and structure over time.

**Color Retention:** Port Authority polo shirts are engineered for color retention. Advanced dyeing processes are used to ensure that the colors remain vibrant and resist fading, even after repeated washing. This is particularly critically important for branded apparel, where maintaining consistent color representation is crucial.

1m5r5fl,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1m5r5fl/for_those_looking_to_taper_off_coffee_i_recommend/,For those looking to taper off coffee I recommend switching to tea first,"Hello my fellow humans who are unfortunately *too* *responsive* to caffeine. Good job for showing up and trying to make a change! The benefits are immense and no one will understand (except for fellow addicts).

Okay now on to the point of this post.

  
I believe that tapering from coffee is a fool's errand. Coffee's effects are so immediate that as you lower the dose you get an immediate lackluster feeling from a smaller and smaller quantity of coffee. There is a really defeating feeling in getting to only drink 8oz of coffee (or less) when you're used to 16+ oz. You might think that you can supplement with decaf but doesn't allow your brain to make the mental transition that you're done drinking coffee.

  
I know some of you drink decaf coffee still, and if that's working for you great, but I've found that I still feel quite bad, anxious and tired when consuming it. I haven't tried the Swiss method variant of decaf so perhaps that would feel different for me though. I really think there is something about coffee (for some of us) that makes us feel bad beyond the caffeine part.

  
My suggestion is to switch to black tea or green tea as soon as possible and give yourself the permission to drink as much as you want for a while. 

  
The benefits of this approach:

1. It's really difficult to over-consume green tea. It's 20-30mg of caffeine typically and most of us are kissing 300mg+/day. That's 10 cups of green tea.

2. You naturally consume less caffeine without trying which makes tapering feel easier. Some days I have 50mg of tea and others I might have 100mg. When it comes to coffee this is just impossible for me. My brain knows how much coffee I need to drink every day and there's not a chance I'm missing that amount.

3. Tea has compounds in it that smooth out the caffeine so the energizing effect of it feels better. This is the opposite of coffee (briefly mentioned by Michael Pollen here [https://youtu.be/mAPG18zNtXk?t=800](https://youtu.be/mAPG18zNtXk?t=800) )",3,1753123222.0,decaf,4,0.72,False
1m5r52r,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1m5r52r/explore_if_vasterqua_appliance_sliders_truly/,Explore If Vasterqua Appliance Sliders Truly Simplify Moving Heavy Kitchen Tools Review,"**A Game-Changer for Kitchen Appliances: Vasterqua B0CLY2X6CH**

The Vasterqua B0CLY2X6CH 24Pcs Appliance Sliders might not seem revolutionary at first glance, but after weeks of using them, I realized how drastically they simplify managing heavy kitchen appliances. Having tested these sliders daily, I can confidently say they’ve been one of the most practical solutions I’ve come across for dealing with cumbersome equipment like pressure cookers, air fryers, and stand mixers. While there’s a lot to praise, a few minor details could be improved to make the product even better.

**Ease of Movement That Saves Time and Effort**

Dragging my hefty stand mixer across the counter almost felt like a workout before I tried these appliance sliders. The smooth PTFE surface lets even the heaviest items glide effortlessly, reducing strain on the arms and countertops alike. Whether I’m repositioning appliances to clean underneath or shifting them for convenience during cooking, it’s become an incredibly hassle-free task with these compact gadgets. 

[Check Vasterqua B0CLY2X6CH deals on Amazon now.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0cly2x6ch/)

**Compact Yet Heavy-Duty Design**

The 3/4"" diameter of each slider is surprisingly effective. Despite their small size, they’re crafted with durable PTFE and rubber materials that provide excellent longevity. I was initially skeptical of their ability to support my pressure cooker, but after weeks of daily use, I’ve had no issues with wear and tear. These sliders handle heavy appliances without showing any signs of deformation or loss of performance. This is perfect, especially for those bulky kitchen essentials sitting stubbornly on the counters.

**Simple Installation Process**

Installing these sliders was a breeze! All I needed to do was clean the bottom of the appliance, peel off the adhesive sticker, and attach the sliders firmly. To be cautious, I waited the recommended 12 hours before putting any weight on them. This allowed the adhesive to fully bond, and they’ve stayed firmly in place since. Unlike some products where installation becomes a DIY nightmare, this process took just a few minutes, and it didn’t require any specialized tools or excessive effort.

**Wide Compatibility Across Kitchen Appliances**

One of the standout aspects is their versatility. These sliders aren’t restricted to pressure cookers alone—they also work brilliantly with coffee makers, air fryers, and even my blender. The design is completely non-bulky, so it doesn’t affect the aesthetics of the appliance, which I appreciated. They blend seamlessly into the look of my kitchen, and the blue color adds a subtle touch of modernity.

**Strengths**

- Smooth PTFE design allows for effortless gliding of heavy appliances.  
- The adhesive backing is extremely strong and holds up even after weeks of use.  
- Compact diameter fits smaller appliance bases while remaining durable.  
- Works across various countertop materials—from marble to stainless steel.  

**Flaws**

- For appliances with textured bottoms, the adhesive strength might be slightly reduced.  
- The 12-hour wait post-installation before use can be inconvenient if you’re eager to get started.  
- Blue coloration, while visually appealing, might not suit every kitchen aesthetic.  

**Performance on Different Materials**

From marble to stainless steel and even wood, these sliders performed flawlessly across all surfaces in my home. The wear-resistant smooth PTFE ensures that there isn’t any damage or unsightly marks left behind on your countertops. They’re also super effective when moving sticky appliances, like blenders after a blending session, when bases tend to adhere slightly to the surface.

**Market Rivals Comparison**

Comparing these to other popular appliance slider options, such as Scotch mount pads or standard adhesive Teflon sliders, I found Vasterqua’s version to be superior in many ways. While others often come with weaker adhesives, this design holds up remarkably well even for heavier gadgets. Additionally, the smoothness of their glide stands out—it genuinely feels effortless. That said, Scotch pads sometimes offer larger diameters, which could cover bigger appliance bases more effectively. If this brand added size variations to their product line, they’d probably dominate the market.

**True Value**

Considering their effectiveness, ease of installation, and durability, these sliders are worth every penny. While you might initially think of appliance sliders as a minor investment, they genuinely make a significant difference in daily kitchen tasks. If you value convenience and protecting your countertops from accidental scraping, these little helpers are a worthwhile addition to your home.

1m5r0oj,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1m5r0oj/should_you_try_homerhyme_laundry_detergent_sheets/,Should You Try HOMERHYME Laundry Detergent Sheets Review for Sensitive Skin and Eco-Friendly Use?,"The HOMERHYME HR-30DS100ST-U Laundry Detergent Sheets have become a staple in my laundry routine over the past few weeks. As someone who values convenience and sustainability, these travel-friendly, eco-friendly detergent sheets made a compelling case for switching from traditional liquid detergents. However, while testing them across a range of laundry scenarios, I found both upsides and certain challenges to consider. Let me walk you through my experience.

**Compact and Travel-Friendly Design**  
The compact nature of these laundry detergent sheets is a game-changer. They come in a slim, lightweight package that’s far easier to pack than clunky detergent bottles. I recently tested their portability on a weekend trip, popping a few sheets into my luggage. The space I saved was fantastic, and the risk of spills—something I’ve unfortunately experienced with liquid detergents before—was completely eliminated. Each sheet is pre-measured, so I didn’t have to worry about bringing measuring cups or estimating the right amount for each load.

[Check HOMERHYME HR-30DS100ST-U price on Amazon.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b0ch7p1pcb/)

**Gentle on Skin, Yet Effective**  
One major highlight is how well-suited these detergent sheets are for sensitive skin. My partner, who has eczema, didn’t experience any irritation while wearing clothes washed with these sheets. Their unscented, hypoallergenic formula really stands out, and the absence of harsh additives like dyes, parabens, and phosphates is a relief. Despite their gentle touch, the sheets are surprisingly effective at removing everyday stains. Coffee spills and grass stains vanished after a single wash—though, in fairness, tougher stains like dried-in grease needed a little pre-treatment.

**Biodegradable and Eco-Conscious Feel**  
As someone trying to reduce plastic waste, I was really impressed by the biodegradable packaging and formula. It truly feels like a step forward in tackling environmental concerns. Unlike giant plastic detergent jugs, this product produces zero waste, which is just incredible. There's definite satisfaction in knowing I’m making a more planet-friendly choice without compromising on cleaning power.

**Cleaning Power and Dissolvability**  
One thing I was curious about was how these detergent sheets would perform in cold water and different types of washing machines. To their credit, they dissolved quickly and left no residue on my clothes, even in a cold-water cycle. I tested them in my mom’s high-efficiency machine and a friend’s older washing unit, and they worked equally well in both. For someone who isn’t technical, knowing these sheets are universally compatible saves a lot of guesswork.

**Advantages**  
- Space-saving and perfect for travel.  
- Hypoallergenic; safe for sensitive skin.  
- Biodegradable; a zero-waste laundry solution.  
- Convenient pre-portioned sheets with no spills.  

**Hurdles**  
- Heavier soil and stubborn stains may need pre-treatment.  
- Higher initial cost compared to traditional detergents.  
- Might take some getting used to if you’re accustomed to liquid or powder detergents.

**Performance Against Competitors**  
In comparison to conventional liquid detergents like Tide or Gain, this biodegradable option offers a sleek, lightweight alternative. The lack of plastic waste is an immediate win in its favor, as is its travel-friendly nature. However, liquid detergents often have a stronger stain-fighting capability, especially for tough grease marks. Another competitor worth mentioning is Tru Earth, which manufactures similar laundry sheets. Tru Earth provides comparable eco-credentials but tends to be slightly pricier. That said, the HOMERHYME sheets edge out with their unscented formula, a boon for people with allergies or sensitivities.

**Affordable Quality**  
The cost of these detergent sheets skews higher than traditional detergents. However, given their convenience, portability, and sustainable design, I feel that you’re getting solid value for the price. They also eliminate “hidden costs” like bulky detergent containers taking up storage space or the environmental impact of plastic. While the purchase price may initially make you pause, their eco-friendly benefits make them worth considering if you’re serious about sustainability.

1m5r02k,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m5r02k/these_worry_dolls_are_plotting_my_demise/,These Worry Dolls Are Plotting My Demise,"

I consider myself quite cultured for a white Midwesterner, even though I've never left the country, learned a language beyond Pig Latin, or tried many foreign dishes. But if you ask anyone from our side of the trailer park, they'll tell you we were a loud and loving bunch of hippies. My mom did an amazing job of introducing us to different cultures, ideas, races, and religions. The challenge was that there wasn’t much diversity in our area, so we mostly explored these ideas through books, tv, local Native American powwows, and the eclectic and eccentric crowd at Midwestern music festivals.



My mom often visited a quirky little shop called Strawberry Fields, overflowing with patchwork purses, tie-dye t-shirts, Grateful Dead tapestries, and a variety of paraphernalia labeled for “tobacco only.” Most of the time, she would go without all six of us kids, but she always returned with little gifts for each of us. My mom has a knack for finding small and unique treasures. She’s loved surprising us with them for as long as I can remember. It’s her love language. 



Once, she brought me home this little yellow box that was the size of a hotwheels car. It was in the shape of an oval, and had little red and green symbols all over it. She wouldn’t tell me what it was until I opened it. 



There was a little note folded up neatly, so I picked it up off the pile of miniature dolls. The little piece of paper explained how to use them. It read something along the lines of… “Tell all your worries to the worry dolls, place them under your pillow before bed, and when you wake up all of your worries will be gone.”



I remember picking up one of the little dolls, and my heart melted at the sight of them. They were no bigger than the tip of my index finger, and I was about seven years old at the time. They were brightly colored, and they were so different from one another. I was in awe of how unique each of them were. I made sure to let my mom know how grateful I was, and I was ecstatic to use them that night. 



I loved whispering to my little dolls before going to sleep. I didn’t do it every night, but I kept them on a shelf in my room and would pull them down when I felt it necessary. They were so small that they would easily get lost, eaten by pets, broken, etc. So my mom would replace them once every so often. 



I am now twenty-four and I honestly hadn’t thought about them since eighth grade when I decided I was too old for worry dolls. The magic of the dolls had died with the Tooth Fairy, Santa Clause, and the Easter Bunny. Instead of using them to cope with my negative thoughts, I decided it was time to use a diary in their place. 



It wasn’t until I was at one of the local flea markets that I spotted a blue storage tub amongst all the faded baseball cards, random tools, and three decade old Christmas decorations. It had a piece of printer paper duct taped to the front of it that read “$0.50 bin” written with a magnum sharpie.



My curiosity got the best of me, and I made my way over to the bin and crouched down to get a better look. Faded toys, a few crocheted oven mitts, a set of ugly clip-on earrings, and three packages of unopened worry dolls. I felt the nostalgia flood through me and a smile spread across my face. I grabbed all three from the box and paid the vendor $1.50 for the bunch. 



I didn’t need three boxes of worry dolls of course, but I thought it would be a fun surprise for my mom and little sister. We have family dinners most Tuesday nights, so I kept them in my glove box until the next get together. 



They were both happy to see the little dolls again. They didn’t even need to open the box to know what they were, but they did anyway because we loved seeing each unique doll. They opened them up and neatly laid them side by side in a row on the kitchen table. 



There was one with a striped skirt and a purple shirt , another with a blue dress and a yellow poncho, and a few little guys with pants and t-shirts. They all had the same black hair that was made out of sand and black paint, but all uniquely designed. They thanked me for the gifts and we all promised to try them out that night to see if they really worked.



I went home that night and opened my package that had been sitting in the car for two days at this point. I placed the yellow box on the side table next to the bed and stared at it with a sentimental smile as I thought about what I might tell the dolls about. 



I carefully took the lid off, grabbing both sides with my thumb and index finger. I dumped the contents of the box out on the night stand and quickly noticed that something was off. I flinched because I thought whatever was inside was some kind of creature.



I know that sounds crazy, but the meaty sounding thud it made when it hit the wood was disturbing. I just stared at the thing for about thirty seconds to make sure it wasn’t going to move. Slowly, I sat back up and nudged it so that its “face” was upward. This didn’t help my growing anxiety by any means. 



Yea, it resembled a worry doll, but it was thick, dark, and sickly looking. The usual sand and paint that was used for the hair was replaced by a little tuft of what looked like real hair from a human or an animal. Its little outfit was not colorful, but a black cloak that covered its whole body and was made of some woven fabric similar to what is normally used for these kinds of dolls. 



The most disturbing thing was the face. Rather than having eyes and a mouth painted with black ink, it appeared as if someone had hollowed out the features from a piece of ham. The color resembled pale skin, with thin, vein-like patterns running across it. My brow furrowed in confusion and disgust. Why did mine look like that? Both my mom and my sister had completely normal dolls. 



Instead of touching it, I decided to take a picture to send to my sister. I wanted to get her thoughts, and maybe even joke about how creepy it was. I pulled my phone out and opened up the camera. I leaned over the doll and snapped a few pics before switching over to our messages. When I pulled up the photo tab, the pictures I had just taken weren’t there. It was like I had never taken them. 



I backed out to make sure they weren’t in my camera roll and possibly not loading, but they weren’t there either. Not even in my recently deleted. I tried again to take the picture, but this time I did it in the message app. The picture took, but it was really bright, like someone was shining an industrial flashlight at the thing. I still tried to send the picture, but it just kept giving me an error message. 



I gave up, believing my phone needed an update or something, but I was too lazy to check and was honestly more interested in the thing sitting in front of me. I finally decided that it was harmless because it hadn’t moved or anything. It just creeped me out in my quiet house. 



I slowly reached out to grab the doll while unconsciously holding my breath. I brought the doll closer to my face and examined it closer. I remember saying “You’re a creepy little thing,” with a grimace on my face. It was such an odd thing. And I wondered why only my box had one doll that was bigger than normal. 



I thought maybe it was some kind of special edition thing, but realized that would be really weird considering they weren’t necessarily a hot commodity. Who would seek out a special edition worry doll?



I decided it was best to stop asking questions and just try to use the thing, like I had promised my mom and sister. I thought maybe the doll would grow on me eventually, considering I have a soft spot for horror movies and creepy props. 



I set the doll down for a moment to get comfortable under the covers before holding it up in front of me. I thought for a moment and decided I’d just share one worry. It was only one doll after all, and generally you tell one worry to one doll. That’s why they tend to come in groups or pairs. 



I spoke the words out loud, “I just want a fulfilling job.”



I had recently gotten a job as a dental assistant with a well known dental corporation. They paid well over the normal wage for assistants in my area, but the dentist was a terror. I assume they needed to put someone in golden handcuffs so they could keep their turnover rates under control. Doctor Selepka. He was a large and imposing man who was horrible to his patients and his staff. He would grab us by the arm forcefully if we weren’t looking in the mouth at the “right angle”. He would forcefully shove patients' heads back on the chair before doing any exam. Other times he would get in screaming matches with other male patients who wouldn’t put up with his shit.



All that being said, it had only been two months, but I was losing my mind with this disgusting excuse for a man. I came home in tears on a daily basis for a plethora of reasons. This doll thing was worth a shot at least. Even if to just say the words out loud. Speaking your intentions as they say. 



I tucked the oddly textured doll under my pillow and snuggled into bed. It didn’t take long for me to fall into a deep sleep. 



I slept like a rock. It was one of those sleeps that makes you feel like you time traveled to the next day. I woke up in the same position that I fell asleep in, which made my body so sore. 



I rolled out of bed, groaning and rubbing my stiff muscles. I had honestly had enough of this job, and just whispering to the little doll about my worries, kinda made me realize how badly things had gotten. I wasn’t going to quit right now, because I needed the money, but I figured it would be fine to call in for just one day. It was a Friday, so I decided to give myself a three day weekend. My mental health needed a break.



I sent a half hearted excuse about not feeling well and  got a half hearted “feel better” from my manager. I started my morning like any other weekend. Freshen up, Coffee, comfy clothes, Youtube. 



I plopped down on the couch and turned on my favorite podcast before deciding I should call my sister to fill her in on everything. I held down the power button to activate Siri and said, “Call Sissy’s facetime,” I waited for a moment before she answered. The sound of screeching children in the background filled my living room. “Hunter! Stop hitting your brother!” she shouted before turning her attention to me. 



“Sorry, what’s up?” She said with an exhausted smile. 



“Sorry to bug you, I just wanted to tell you about what happened last night. You know those worry dolls I got us?” 



“Yea,”



“Well mine looks super weird,” I said with a nervous giggle. 



“What do you mean?” she asked, raising an eyebrow. 



“There was only one doll and it's really weird looking. It’s bigger than normal and feels fleshy. It looks like something from a horror prop store,” 



“Lemme see,” she said, looking more disturbed than before. 



“I tried sending pics last night but they wouldn’t load, or take. I’ll see if I can get it to work,” I flipped my camera to face the floor as I got off the couch and walked to my bedroom. I grabbed the corner of my pillow and flipped it up for dramatic effect, but paused. The doll was gone. 



My sister didn’t say anything for a second, most likely confused. “Bro I swear to god I put it under my pillow before bed.” 



“Check under your bed or maybe you kicked it under the sheets somehow.” 



I tore my bed apart looking for the silly thing, but there was nothing. “Hey, lemme call you back,” I said before hanging up abruptly. I turned over to my side table and grabbed the little yellow box. It had weight again. “Maybe I put it in here and didn’t remember,” I thought to myself. I took the lid off and was astonished to see a completely new doll sitting inside.



She was dressed in a similar black cloth, but wore a little black flower crown on her head. There was a miniature skull placed right in the center of the crown. Her hair also appeared to be from a living thing, not sure what, but her bangs were much more well kept than the last doll. A straight across cut, each black hair in its place. The thing that really creeped me out was her face. She had the same hollowed out eyes, but her expression wasn’t blank. She was frowning and crying… tears of blood. 



I instinctively lifted my index finger to touch the blood. It was wet. Fresh red blood dripping from her right eye and pooling in the other. I whimpered and set it back down. “What the fuck?” I whispered to myself. 



I couldn’t help but wonder if this was some sort of prank, the only problem with that is, I don’t don’t have many friends outside of my immediate family. My mom has never been into pranks, in fact, she got pretty upset the few times we ever pulled any on her as kids. My sister was busy raising two kids and lived at least forty five minutes away. My other siblings didn’t reach out much, so I was stumped. 



I decided that this must be something supernatural. And I know, most people would look for any other explanation, but like I said before, I was raised around some of the most eccentric people you could imagine. I am a believer in the paranormal at the very least. 



I paced from the living room to the bedroom, periodically checking to see if it moved at all. It stayed put as my mind raced.



 A few moments into my panicked pacing, my phone rang. The caller ID read “Addie,” my boss's name. I rolled my eyes, realizing she was probably going to beg me to come in or something stupid. I answered anyway because I’m a pushover.



“Hey,” I said, trying to mimic a tired, sick person.

 

“Hey girl,” the sounds of smacking gum violated my ears, “something crazy just happened.” My brow furrowed in confusion although I knew she couldn’t see it. 



“What?” 



“Dr. Salepka died this morning,” she stated bluntly, as if she was telling me what she ate for lunch. 



“What? What-How?” I sputtered in shock.



“Jane found him in his pool. Apparently it was pretty bad. His guts were everywhere like an animal attack or something,”



Jane was the dental hygienist that the doctor had been hooking up with in “private” but it was no secret. They rode to work together every morning and went out for drinks nearly every night. 



“Oh my god… that’s insane Addie. Is Jane okay?” I asked, very concerned about her mental state after seeing something so gruesome. 



“She was pretty freaked out when she called me, but she said she’s still coming in on Monday,” I scoffed at her disregard for the situation. 



“Okay Addie, I’m still not feeling well so I’m gonna go rest up so I can be there Monday too,” I retorted passive aggressively knowing she wouldn’t even catch it. I hung up before she could respond and sat down on the couch with my head in my hands. 



Images of Dr. Salepka’s dead body kept flashing in my mind. I hadn’t seen it of course, but my mind painted me a pretty vivid picture regardless of if I wanted to see it. I hated the man with a burning passion, but this was insane. My mind couldn’t help but wonder if the doll had played a part in this or if it was just some crazy coincidence. I decided it was the latter. 



Before I went to sleep that night, I decided to put the lid back on the box. I placed it on the top of my bookshelf. Out of sight, out of mind. 



That night I had some of the most vivid dreams I had ever experienced in my life. They all related to yesterday's events, but it was in such a positive light. I dreamt about what work might be like without him around. I imagined how much anger and negativity had left the world with just one person. It made me feel… happy.The whole time it felt like I had taken ecstasy. It was an intoxicating feeling that I was honestly sad to wake up from. 



When I woke up that morning, I felt so refreshed. Like someone had washed my brain with sunshine and cool water. I smiled as I did my weekend, morning routine and found myself humming and bouncing around the house. 



When I turned the TV on to youtube, I saw one of my favorite True Crime channels had posted a video. Something about the title made me remember what had happened the day before. My heart sank for half a second, but it dissipated quickly. It’s like my brain knew it didn’t want to feel sorry. A part of me felt like it was my fault, and I was somehow proud of it. It makes my skin crawl just thinking about it now. 



As of now, I will keep the doll on the shelf until I get some suggestions as to what I should do.  Does anyone have experience with these specific types of dolls? I’ll link some drawings I made of the dolls so you can get an idea of what they look like. Any advice would be appreciated, so thank you in advance. Until next time.

Hey there! I’m a 30-year-old creative in marketing with a dry sense of humor, an adventurous streak, and a knack for turning everyday moments into something worth remembering. I use a wheelchair for longer distances—but that’s just one part of the story. I’m independent, curious, and always up for something fun, meaningful, or wonderfully weird.



Perks of Dating Me:


	•	VIP Parking – Front-row access to life, baby.
	•	Skip the Line – Theme parks, concerts, events… we don’t do “waiting.”
	•	Endless Laughs – Wild injury stories that sound fake (but aren’t).
	•	Unexpected Wins – Free upgrades, kind strangers, and the occasional surprise dessert.
	•	Zombie Apocalypse Strategy – I may not outrun them, but I’m clever, calm under pressure, and hard to miss. That’s teamwork.
	•	You’ll Stand Out – Let’s be real—“normie” couples are overrated.
	•	Built-In Armrest – My chair’s side guards are cozy. You’re welcome.
	•	Strong Hands, Strong Heart – Years of pushing wheels and opening up emotionally.
	•	Creative Problem-Solving – I’m basically a MacGyver with wheels.
	•	Zero Time for Superficial BS – Life’s short. I keep it real and intentional.



A Bit More About Me


I’m all about storytelling—whether it’s through books, music, movies, games, or late-night conversations. I love collecting weird trivia, exploring overlooked places, and getting lost in good ideas.

I stay active in my own way: home workouts, nature walks, and traveling whenever I can. I’ve explored the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and the Bahamas—and there’s still plenty more I’d love to experience. (Bonus: I speak Spanish, too!)

I’m the kind of person who notices the little things—your favorite song, how you take your coffee, the way you light up when you talk about something you love. I care deeply, listen closely, and show up consistently. Whether it’s building a playlist, discovering a local gallery, or just sharing quiet time, I value connection that feels grounded and genuine.

⸻

What I’m Looking For:

I’m drawn to people who are:

	•	Playful, grounded, and emotionally present
	•	Down to laugh, explore, and be real together
	•	Into thoughtful conversations and spontaneous fun
	•	Comfortable being fully, unapologetically themselves

I’m open to friendship, flirtation, or something more—whatever feels right. Long-distance, age gaps, different backgrounds—all are welcome. I’m attracted to all body types—connection and energy mean more to me than any one look.

Whatever we build, I just want it to feel real and mutual.



Why You Should Message Me:

If you’re looking for someone thoughtful, creative, and emotionally grounded—someone who values kindness, depth, and shared experiences—I’d genuinely love to hear from you.

No pressure. No expectations. Just an open door and a bit of curiosity.

If something here speaks to you, don’t be shy. Say hello, tell me something about you, and let’s see where the conversation takes us.



Let’s Make Memories:

Big trips, quiet nights, deep talks, shared playlists—I think the best connections are built on a little of everything. Whether you’re looking for something serious or just someone to connect with in an honest, easy way, you’re welcome here.

Reach out. I’d really love to hear from you.",1,1753122836.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Hey there! I’m a 30-year-old creative in marketing with a dry sense of humor, an adventurous streak, and a knack for turning everyday moments into something worth remembering. I use a wheelchair for longer distances—but that’s just one part of the story. I’m independent, curious, and always up for something fun, meaningful, or wonderfully weird.



Perks of Dating Me:


	•	VIP Parking – Front-row access to life, baby.
	•	Skip the Line – Theme parks, concerts, events… we don’t do “waiting.”
	•	Endless Laughs – Wild injury stories that sound fake (but aren’t).
	•	Unexpected Wins – Free upgrades, kind strangers, and the occasional surprise dessert.
	•	Zombie Apocalypse Strategy – I may not outrun them, but I’m clever, calm under pressure, and hard to miss. That’s teamwork.
	•	You’ll Stand Out – Let’s be real—“normie” couples are overrated.
	•	Built-In Armrest – My chair’s side guards are cozy. You’re welcome.
	•	Strong Hands, Strong Heart – Years of pushing wheels and opening up emotionally.
	•	Creative Problem-Solving – I’m basically a MacGyver with wheels.
	•	Zero Time for Superficial BS – Life’s short. I keep it real and intentional.



A Bit More About Me


I’m all about storytelling—whether it’s through books, music, movies, games, or late-night conversations. I love collecting weird trivia, exploring overlooked places, and getting lost in good ideas.

I stay active in my own way: home workouts, nature walks, and traveling whenever I can. I’ve explored the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and the Bahamas—and there’s still plenty more I’d love to experience. (Bonus: I speak Spanish, too!)

I’m the kind of person who notices the little things—your favorite song, how you take your coffee, the way you light up when you talk about something you love. I care deeply, listen closely, and show up consistently. Whether it’s building a playlist, discovering a local gallery, or just sharing quiet time, I value connection that feels grounded and genuine.

⸻

What I’m Looking For:

I’m drawn to people who are:

	•	Playful, grounded, and emotionally present
	•	Down to laugh, explore, and be real together
	•	Into thoughtful conversations and spontaneous fun
	•	Comfortable being fully, unapologetically themselves

I’m open to friendship, flirtation, or something more—whatever feels right. Long-distance, age gaps, different backgrounds—all are welcome. I’m attracted to all body types—connection and energy mean more to me than any one look.

Whatever we build, I just want it to feel real and mutual.



Why You Should Message Me:

If you’re looking for someone thoughtful, creative, and emotionally grounded—someone who values kindness, depth, and shared experiences—I’d genuinely love to hear from you.

No pressure. No expectations. Just an open door and a bit of curiosity.

If something here speaks to you, don’t be shy. Say hello, tell me something about you, and let’s see where the conversation takes us.



Let’s Make Memories:

Big trips, quiet nights, deep talks, shared playlists—I think the best connections are built on a little of everything. Whether you’re looking for something serious or just someone to connect with in an honest, easy way, you’re welcome here.

Reach out. I’d really love to hear from you.",2,1753122701.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,5,1.0,False

I freaked out and started having a panic attack and locked the bedroom door. He said if I don’t open it he’d kick it down. I don’t think he meant that part tho. I unlocked it and He was calm when he saw me crying and apologized profusely. He has anger issues but he usually leaves to calm down and then comes home so he doesn’t take it out on me. The disagreement wasn’t even that big of a deal. The only difference this time was that I raised my voice at him for the first time. I’m very passive and non confrontational so this was out of the ordinary for me. But I wasn’t even screaming I was more so crying out in frustration at him. ,1,1753122689.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

I consider myself quite cultured for a white Midwesterner, even though I've never left the country, learned a language beyond Pig Latin, or tried many foreign dishes. But if you ask anyone from our side of the trailer park, they'll tell you we were a loud and loving bunch of hippies. My mom did an amazing job of introducing us to different cultures, ideas, races, and religions. The challenge was that there wasn’t much diversity in our area, so we mostly explored these ideas through books, tv, local Native American powwows, and the eclectic and eccentric crowd at Midwestern music festivals.



My mom often visited a quirky little shop called Strawberry Fields, overflowing with patchwork purses, tie-dye t-shirts, Grateful Dead tapestries, and a variety of paraphernalia labeled for “tobacco only.” Most of the time, she would go without all six of us kids, but she always returned with little gifts for each of us. My mom has a knack for finding small and unique treasures. She’s loved surprising us with them for as long as I can remember. It’s her love language. 



Once, she brought me home this little yellow box that was the size of a hotwheels car. It was in the shape of an oval, and had little red and green symbols all over it. She wouldn’t tell me what it was until I opened it. 



There was a little note folded up neatly, so I picked it up off the pile of miniature dolls. The little piece of paper explained how to use them. It read something along the lines of… “Tell all your worries to the worry dolls, place them under your pillow before bed, and when you wake up all of your worries will be gone.”



I remember picking up one of the little dolls, and my heart melted at the sight of them. They were no bigger than the tip of my index finger, and I was about seven years old at the time. They were brightly colored, and they were so different from one another. I was in awe of how unique each of them were. I made sure to let my mom know how grateful I was, and I was ecstatic to use them that night. 



I loved whispering to my little dolls before going to sleep. I didn’t do it every night, but I kept them on a shelf in my room and would pull them down when I felt it necessary. They were so small that they would easily get lost, eaten by pets, broken, etc. So my mom would replace them once every so often. 



I am now twenty-four and I honestly hadn’t thought about them since eighth grade when I decided I was too old for worry dolls. The magic of the dolls had died with the Tooth Fairy, Santa Clause, and the Easter Bunny. Instead of using them to cope with my negative thoughts, I decided it was time to use a diary in their place. 



It wasn’t until I was at one of the local flea markets that I spotted a blue storage tub amongst all the faded baseball cards, random tools, and three decade old Christmas decorations. It had a piece of printer paper duct taped to the front of it that read “$0.50 bin” written with a magnum sharpie.



My curiosity got the best of me, and I made my way over to the bin and crouched down to get a better look. Faded toys, a few crocheted oven mitts, a set of ugly clip-on earrings, and three packages of unopened worry dolls. I felt the nostalgia flood through me and a smile spread across my face. I grabbed all three from the box and paid the vendor $1.50 for the bunch. 



I didn’t need three boxes of worry dolls of course, but I thought it would be a fun surprise for my mom and little sister. We have family dinners most Tuesday nights, so I kept them in my glove box until the next get together. 



They were both happy to see the little dolls again. They didn’t even need to open the box to know what they were, but they did anyway because we loved seeing each unique doll. They opened them up and neatly laid them side by side in a row on the kitchen table. 



There was one with a striped skirt and a purple shirt , another with a blue dress and a yellow poncho, and a few little guys with pants and t-shirts. They all had the same black hair that was made out of sand and black paint, but all uniquely designed. They thanked me for the gifts and we all promised to try them out that night to see if they really worked.



I went home that night and opened my package that had been sitting in the car for two days at this point. I placed the yellow box on the side table next to the bed and stared at it with a sentimental smile as I thought about what I might tell the dolls about. 



I carefully took the lid off, grabbing both sides with my thumb and index finger. I dumped the contents of the box out on the night stand and quickly noticed that something was off. I flinched because I thought whatever was inside was some kind of creature.



I know that sounds crazy, but the meaty sounding thud it made when it hit the wood was disturbing. I just stared at the thing for about thirty seconds to make sure it wasn’t going to move. Slowly, I sat back up and nudged it so that its “face” was upward. This didn’t help my growing anxiety by any means. 



Yea, it resembled a worry doll, but it was thick, dark, and sickly looking. The usual sand and paint that was used for the hair was replaced by a little tuft of what looked like real hair from a human or an animal. Its little outfit was not colorful, but a black cloak that covered its whole body and was made of some woven fabric similar to what is normally used for these kinds of dolls. 



The most disturbing thing was the face. Rather than having eyes and a mouth painted with black ink, it appeared as if someone had hollowed out the features from a piece of ham. The color resembled pale skin, with thin, vein-like patterns running across it. My brow furrowed in confusion and disgust. Why did mine look like that? Both my mom and my sister had completely normal dolls. 



Instead of touching it, I decided to take a picture to send to my sister. I wanted to get her thoughts, and maybe even joke about how creepy it was. I pulled my phone out and opened up the camera. I leaned over the doll and snapped a few pics before switching over to our messages. When I pulled up the photo tab, the pictures I had just taken weren’t there. It was like I had never taken them. 



I backed out to make sure they weren’t in my camera roll and possibly not loading, but they weren’t there either. Not even in my recently deleted. I tried again to take the picture, but this time I did it in the message app. The picture took, but it was really bright, like someone was shining an industrial flashlight at the thing. I still tried to send the picture, but it just kept giving me an error message. 



I gave up, believing my phone needed an update or something, but I was too lazy to check and was honestly more interested in the thing sitting in front of me. I finally decided that it was harmless because it hadn’t moved or anything. It just creeped me out in my quiet house. 



I slowly reached out to grab the doll while unconsciously holding my breath. I brought the doll closer to my face and examined it closer. I remember saying “You’re a creepy little thing,” with a grimace on my face. It was such an odd thing. And I wondered why only my box had one doll that was bigger than normal. 



I thought maybe it was some kind of special edition thing, but realized that would be really weird considering they weren’t necessarily a hot commodity. Who would seek out a special edition worry doll?



I decided it was best to stop asking questions and just try to use the thing, like I had promised my mom and sister. I thought maybe the doll would grow on me eventually, considering I have a soft spot for horror movies and creepy props. 



I set the doll down for a moment to get comfortable under the covers before holding it up in front of me. I thought for a moment and decided I’d just share one worry. It was only one doll after all, and generally you tell one worry to one doll. That’s why they tend to come in groups or pairs. 



I spoke the words out loud, “I just want a fulfilling job.”



I had recently gotten a job as a dental assistant with a well known dental corporation. They paid well over the normal wage for assistants in my area, but the dentist was a terror. I assume they needed to put someone in golden handcuffs so they could keep their turnover rates under control. Doctor Selepka. He was a large and imposing man who was horrible to his patients and his staff. He would grab us by the arm forcefully if we weren’t looking in the mouth at the “right angle”. He would forcefully shove patients' heads back on the chair before doing any exam. Other times he would get in screaming matches with other male patients who wouldn’t put up with his shit.



All that being said, it had only been two months, but I was losing my mind with this disgusting excuse for a man. I came home in tears on a daily basis for a plethora of reasons. This doll thing was worth a shot at least. Even if to just say the words out loud. Speaking your intentions as they say. 



I tucked the oddly textured doll under my pillow and snuggled into bed. It didn’t take long for me to fall into a deep sleep. 



I slept like a rock. It was one of those sleeps that makes you feel like you time traveled to the next day. I woke up in the same position that I fell asleep in, which made my body so sore. 



I rolled out of bed, groaning and rubbing my stiff muscles. I had honestly had enough of this job, and just whispering to the little doll about my worries, kinda made me realize how badly things had gotten. I wasn’t going to quit right now, because I needed the money, but I figured it would be fine to call in for just one day. It was a Friday, so I decided to give myself a three day weekend. My mental health needed a break.



I sent a half hearted excuse about not feeling well and  got a half hearted “feel better” from my manager. I started my morning like any other weekend. Freshen up, Coffee, comfy clothes, Youtube. 



I plopped down on the couch and turned on my favorite podcast before deciding I should call my sister to fill her in on everything. I held down the power button to activate Siri and said, “Call Sissy’s facetime,” I waited for a moment before she answered. The sound of screeching children in the background filled my living room. “Hunter! Stop hitting your brother!” she shouted before turning her attention to me. 



“Sorry, what’s up?” She said with an exhausted smile. 



“Sorry to bug you, I just wanted to tell you about what happened last night. You know those worry dolls I got us?” 



“Yea,”



“Well mine looks super weird,” I said with a nervous giggle. 



“What do you mean?” she asked, raising an eyebrow. 



“There was only one doll and it's really weird looking. It’s bigger than normal and feels fleshy. It looks like something from a horror prop store,” 



“Lemme see,” she said, looking more disturbed than before. 



“I tried sending pics last night but they wouldn’t load, or take. I’ll see if I can get it to work,” I flipped my camera to face the floor as I got off the couch and walked to my bedroom. I grabbed the corner of my pillow and flipped it up for dramatic effect, but paused. The doll was gone. 



My sister didn’t say anything for a second, most likely confused. “Bro I swear to god I put it under my pillow before bed.” 



“Check under your bed or maybe you kicked it under the sheets somehow.” 



I tore my bed apart looking for the silly thing, but there was nothing. “Hey, lemme call you back,” I said before hanging up abruptly. I turned over to my side table and grabbed the little yellow box. It had weight again. “Maybe I put it in here and didn’t remember,” I thought to myself. I took the lid off and was astonished to see a completely new doll sitting inside.



She was dressed in a similar black cloth, but wore a little black flower crown on her head. There was a miniature skull placed right in the center of the crown. Her hair also appeared to be from a living thing, not sure what, but her bangs were much more well kept than the last doll. A straight across cut, each black hair in its place. The thing that really creeped me out was her face. She had the same hollowed out eyes, but her expression wasn’t blank. She was frowning and crying… tears of blood. 



I instinctively lifted my index finger to touch the blood. It was wet. Fresh red blood dripping from her right eye and pooling in the other. I whimpered and set it back down. “What the fuck?” I whispered to myself. 



I couldn’t help but wonder if this was some sort of prank, the only problem with that is, I don’t don’t have many friends outside of my immediate family. My mom has never been into pranks, in fact, she got pretty upset the few times we ever pulled any on her as kids. My sister was busy raising two kids and lived at least forty five minutes away. My other siblings didn’t reach out much, so I was stumped. 



I decided that this must be something supernatural. And I know, most people would look for any other explanation, but like I said before, I was raised around some of the most eccentric people you could imagine. I am a believer in the paranormal at the very least. 



I paced from the living room to the bedroom, periodically checking to see if it moved at all. It stayed put as my mind raced.



 A few moments into my panicked pacing, my phone rang. The caller ID read “Addie,” my boss's name. I rolled my eyes, realizing she was probably going to beg me to come in or something stupid. I answered anyway because I’m a pushover.



“Hey,” I said, trying to mimic a tired, sick person.

 

“Hey girl,” the sounds of smacking gum violated my ears, “something crazy just happened.” My brow furrowed in confusion although I knew she couldn’t see it. 



“What?” 



“Dr. Salepka died this morning,” she stated bluntly, as if she was telling me what she ate for lunch. 



“What? What-How?” I sputtered in shock.



“Jane found him in his pool. Apparently it was pretty bad. His guts were everywhere like an animal attack or something,”



Jane was the dental hygienist that the doctor had been hooking up with in “private” but it was no secret. They rode to work together every morning and went out for drinks nearly every night. 



“Oh my god… that’s insane Addie. Is Jane okay?” I asked, very concerned about her mental state after seeing something so gruesome. 



“She was pretty freaked out when she called me, but she said she’s still coming in on Monday,” I scoffed at her disregard for the situation. 



“Okay Addie, I’m still not feeling well so I’m gonna go rest up so I can be there Monday too,” I retorted passive aggressively knowing she wouldn’t even catch it. I hung up before she could respond and sat down on the couch with my head in my hands. 



Images of Dr. Salepka’s dead body kept flashing in my mind. I hadn’t seen it of course, but my mind painted me a pretty vivid picture regardless of if I wanted to see it. I hated the man with a burning passion, but this was insane. My mind couldn’t help but wonder if the doll had played a part in this or if it was just some crazy coincidence. I decided it was the latter. 



Before I went to sleep that night, I decided to put the lid back on the box. I placed it on the top of my bookshelf. Out of sight, out of mind. 



That night I had some of the most vivid dreams I had ever experienced in my life. They all related to yesterday's events, but it was in such a positive light. I dreamt about what work might be like without him around. I imagined how much anger and negativity had left the world with just one person. It made me feel… happy.The whole time it felt like I had taken ecstasy. It was an intoxicating feeling that I was honestly sad to wake up from. 



When I woke up that morning, I felt so refreshed. Like someone had washed my brain with sunshine and cool water. I smiled as I did my weekend, morning routine and found myself humming and bouncing around the house. 



When I turned the TV on to youtube, I saw one of my favorite True Crime channels had posted a video. Something about the title made me remember what had happened the day before. My heart sank for half a second, but it dissipated quickly. It’s like my brain knew it didn’t want to feel sorry. A part of me felt like it was my fault, and I was somehow proud of it. It makes my skin crawl just thinking about it now. 



As of now, I will keep the doll on the shelf until I get some suggestions as to what I should do.  Does anyone have experience with these specific types of dolls? I’ll link some drawings I made of the dolls so you can get an idea of what they look like. Any advice would be appreciated, so thank you in advance. Until next time.

1. Bring shower shoes and don't leave toiletries in the showers. The campground I work has 2 showers for over 170 campsites and a total of 12 bathrooms, (6 male, 6 female). With a max capacity of 8 people per campsite, anything left in the shower room gets thrown away.

2. The deep sinks are for waste water only! No washing dishes and no dumping food or coffee grounds. I've pulled knives and spoons out of the deep sinks and had someone dump what looked like an entire pot of rice and beans which clogged the sink for 3 days. 

3. The bear boxes are for food only. Please don't store your grills or other cooking items in the boxes. That doesn't leave enough room for anyone else to place their food in the box.

4. Please, don't kick doors open in the bathrooms. You wouldn't do that at home so please don't do it in the park. 

5. I know at my location, we are short staffed. Please be mindful of how you treat the facilities and it's impact it has on other visitors and park staff!",59,1753122618.0,nationalparks,6,1.0,False

Just got my car ceramic-coated in Gurgaon, and I have to say - this little upgrade might be the best decision I’ve made this monsoon. Ever looked at your car and thought, *“Damn, this could look so much better”*? Yeah, that was me last week.

Anyway, I booked a doorstep detailing service from a brand called **SHiFTUP** \- and it was honestly smoother than I expected.

They showed up right at my gate.  
Didn’t empty my wallet - packages start at ₹4995.  
And the finish? My car looks like it belongs in a showroom. No exaggeration.

They’ve got options too - ceramic, graphene, even borophene coatings if you're feeling fancy. The tech seemed top-tier. Not your typical splash-n-wipe setup - more like a full-blown paint spa with a futuristic vibe  
  
You know how Delhi NCR treats cars - one day it’s blazing sun, the next it’s raining acid (not literally, but feels like it). Pollution, water spots, random bird graffiti - it all adds up. Mine had started looking a little sad, dull, like it needed coffee and therapy.

Now? It beads water like a lotus leaf and somehow stays cleaner for way longer.  
  
I’ve got a few road trips lined up, and I was also considering a resale down the line. But really, it was just painful seeing my car lose its glow. If you’ve ever loved your ride, you get it. This coating felt like pressing refresh.

They operate in **Delhi, Gurgaon, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Kolkata** \- so if you’re in any of those cities, you’re sorted.

Already uploaded a before/after comparison for the curious.

If anyone’s been on the fence about getting their ride protected, I’d say go for it before the rains hit peak madness. DM me if you want deets or just wanna chat car stuff.
