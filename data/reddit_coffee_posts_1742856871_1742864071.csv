How I finally got the medical care and treatment I needed.","I'm not going to discuss my prior experience in this post. If you're interested, you can read about it here:
[The impact of mental health on long covid and my experience](https://www.reddit.com/u/SophiaShay7/s/GzIBNdY0Rl)

I have five diagnoses that covid gave me, including Fibromyalgia, ME/CFS, Hashimoto's disease, which causes hypothyroidism, Dysautonomia, and MCAS. I've spent the last 15 months of my life learning everything I could about my symptoms and possible diagnoses. 

**Where did I start? It all started with research.**

Among the SSRIs, those with the highest affinity for sigma-1 receptor agonism‚Äîprimarily, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, escitalopram, and citalopram‚Äîmay be of greatest benefit. As noted above, preliminary data suggest that certain long COVID symptoms (eg, fatigue, brain fog, and post-COVID dysphoria) may be most responsive to SSRIs, although more research is needed to better characterize specific response rates. 

[In doing research of long covid, SSRIs, and fluvoxamine, you‚Äôll see it mentioned as a top choice. Here‚Äôs one such article](https://www.psychiatrist.com/pcc/growing-evidence-potential-use-antidepressants-long-covid)

>...Fluvoxamine can stabilize mast cells, such that
fluvoxamine can reduce histamine release from mast cells as well as reduce cytokine storms in COVID-19.

>There is an activated condition of mast cells in long COVID-19, with abnormal granulation and excessive inflammatory cytokine release. A study by Weinstock et al. indicates that patients with long COVID-19 suffer the same clinical syndrome as patients with mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS). 

[Immunological dysfunction and mast cell activation syndrome in long COVID](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10166245/#:~:text=There%20is%20an%20activated%20condition,cell%20activation%20syndrome%20(MCAS).)           

**Why does long covid trigger MCAS? What is MCAS? Keep reading....**

>Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) is an immunological condition in which mast cells, a type of white blood cell, inappropriately and excessively release chemical mediators, such as histamine, resulting in a range of chronic symptoms, sometimes including anaphylaxis or near-anaphylaxis attacks. Primary symptoms include cardiovascular, dermatological, gastrointestinal, neurological, and respiratory problems. MCAS can cause a range of neurological symptoms, including headaches, dizziness, vertigo, cognitive dysfunction, and paresthesia. When mast cells are activated in MCAS, they release chemicals like histamine, which can impact nerve signaling, leading to sensations like tingling or numbness. Read: [MCAS and ME/CFS](https://www.reddit.com/r/cfs/s/sGU7tz6rJD)

>Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) is the most common form of systemic Mast Cell Disease and is known to cause Dysautonomia in some but not all patients. Adrenaline dumps can also trigger histamine dumps. While not directly causing a ""dump"" in the same way, adrenaline release (an adrenaline ""dump"") can indirectly trigger a histamine release in the body, meaning that experiencing a surge of adrenaline can potentially lead to increased histamine levels, which could manifest as histamine-like symptoms in some individuals; this is because both systems are involved in the body's stress response. **Adrenaline surges trigger histamine dumps.**

>Histamine, serotonin, and dopamine are all neurotransmitters that play a role in regulating sleep-wake cycles and helping the brain transition from sleep to wakefulness. A histamine dump happens when your body produces too much histamine that builds up in the brain. Histamine dumps often happen late at night or early in the morning. You might suddenly feel changes in body temperature, itchiness, or blood pressure changes as your histamine levels rise. **Histamine, serotonin, and dopamine all play a role in regulating sleep-wake cycles.**

I have Paresthesia. Paresthesia (numbness and tingling sensations) is considered a common neurological symptom associated with Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), often reported by individuals with this condition; it can manifest as tingling in various parts of the body due to the release of mast cell mediators affecting nerve function. 

I have Hyperesthesia. Hyperesthesia is a neurological condition that causes extreme sensitivity to one or more of the senses, including touch, pressure, pain, temperature, light, sound, taste, and smell. I had hyperesthesia in all five senses, down to the texture of my food. 

After I developed MCAS, I followed the H1 and H2 histamine blocker protocol. I tried several H1 and H2 antihistamines. I tried taking one of each twice a day. I tried taking one of each once day. I couldn't tolerate them. They made my tachycardia, adrenaline surges, and histamine dumps worse. They also gave me nausea. Some people like me can't tolerate the OTCs and/or can't tolerate the fillers in those medications.

**What about the tryptophan and serotonin deficiencies in long covid patients I keep reading about?**

>The researchers determined that a subset of patients with long COVID had traces of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in their stool samples even months after acute COVID-19 infection, which suggests that components of the virus remain in the gut of some patients long after infection. They found that this remaining virus, called a viral reservoir, triggers the immune system to release proteins that fight the virus, called interferons. These interferons cause inflammation that reduces the absorption of the amino acid tryptophan in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.

>Tryptophan is a building block for several neurotransmitters, including serotonin, which is primarily produced in the GI tract and carries messages between nerve cells in the brain and throughout the body. It plays a key role in regulating memory, sleep, digestion, wound healing, and other functions that maintain homeostasis within the body. Serotonin is also an important regulator of the vagus nerve, a system of neurons that mediate the communication between the body and the brain.

>The researchers found that when tryptophan absorption is reduced by persistent viral inflammation, serotonin is depleted, leading to disrupted vagus nerve signaling, which in turn can cause several of the symptoms associated with long COVID, such as memory loss.

[Viral Persistence and Serotonin Reduction Can Cause Long COVID Symptoms](https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2023/october/penn-study-finds-serotonin-reduction-causes-long-covid-symptoms)

**What medications and supplements do I take?** 

I take Fluvoxamine. It's an SSRI used for OCD. It's prescribed off-label in low-dose for long covid/ME/CFS symptoms. I take Diazepam for Dysautonomia. Fluticasone and Hydroxyzine for MCAS. Omeprazole for Gerd (it's a PPI that also acts as a mast cell stabilizer). 

I take NatureBell L-tryptophan and L-theanine complex. It regulates the sleep-wake cycle. I take 2/3rds the dose. Or I take Magnesiu-OM powder (magnesium 3 types and L-theanine) mixed in tart cherry juice (melatonin and tryptophan) 1-2 hours before bed. I alternate between the two. I purchased them from Amazon. They significantly help with calmness, muscle cramps, pain, relaxation, and sleep.

As always, talk to your doctor before taking any GABA, 5-HTP, or L-tryptophan supplements. Especially if you're taking psychotropic medications like SSRIs.

**How have I improved?**

I have improved REM, deep sleep, and overall hours slept. I'm seeing improvements in dysautonomia symptoms and orthostatic intolerance. The dizziness and lightheadedness have significantly improved. My Paresthesia symptoms have improved. I have less numbness and tingling. My Hyperesthesia symptoms have improved. I'm able to tolerate more bright light and loud sound, and my taste and smell are significantly less heightened. I can handle warmer/hot showers. My pain is significantly less strong. My pressure sensitivities haven't lowered. However, I suspect there are other reasons for that.

I shared all this because Dysautonomia and MCAS are prevalent in long covid. It's a combination of things I do that improve my overall symptoms. Tachycardia, adrenaline dumps, histamine dumps, shortness of breath, and air hunger were among some of my worst symptoms. A low histamine diet, medications, supplements, prebiotic fiber, probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus, plenty of rest, and good sleep hygiene significantly alleviated these symptoms. 

>**THE THINGS THAT HAVE HELPED ME THE MOST:**

1. Low-dose Fluvoxamine 25mg
2. Diazepam 5mg
3. Fluticasone (corticosteroid)
4. Hydroxyzine 50mg 
5. Omeprazole 40mg
6. Valacyclovir 1g
7. Prebiotic psyllium husk 
8. Probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus 
9. Emergen-C packets
10. Naturebell L-tryptophan and L-theanine complex OR
11. Magnesiu-OM powder (chelated magnesium 3 types and L-theanine) mixed in tart cherry juice (melatonin and tryptophan)
12. Low histamine diet 
13. Intermittent fasting 10/14 or 8/16 eat/fast schedule 
14. Aggressively resting, pacing, and avoiding PEM.
15. Good sleep hygiene. Sleep 10-12 hours a night.

>**MY DIET AND INTERMITTENT FASTING:**

I completely overhauled my diet last year. I did an anti-inflammation diet. My dysautonomia and hypothyroidism caused non-diabetic nocturnal hypoglycemia attacks. I had to change my diet. I added premier protein shakes with 30 grams of protein. My favorite flavors are cake batter, cinnamon roll, lemon, and peanut butter cup. And fruit cups or applesauce without added sugar. That way, I get protein, carbohydrates, and natural sugar added into my diet. I have blueberries with peanut butter. I have low-fat cottage cheese with fruit like watermelon or bananas. I love salads and vegetables but I can't eat much of it. I have complex carbohydrates like whole wheat pasta and sweet potato fries are better. I like frozen chicken breasts and frozen precut vegetables like carrots, green beans, peas, and butternut squash. 
Recently, I have noticed that my symptoms are more severe than they used to be. I added more meat, dairy, and complex carbohydrates into my diet. The changes I've made include: I've added yogurt into my diet. I have potato bowls with potatoes, some shredded cheese, and canned chicken or ground beef for dinner. I was diagnosed with Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) in September 2024. I switched to a low histamine diet. I've added foods back in as tolerated.

I do limit processed carbohydrates, additives, and sugars. I love chocolate cake and have a slice 1-2 times a month. I have takeout 1-2 times a month. I stay hydrated and drink plenty of water. I've stopped drinking coffee and soda. Though, I'm adding coffee back into my diet. No caffeine after 6pm.

I do intermittent fasting as well. I'll have an eating/fast window of: 8hr/16hr or 10hr/14hr. That's typically intermittent fasting for 14-16 hours. Some days I don't follow it. You have to keep your metabolism guessing. Our bodies get very efficient at estimating the number of calories we eat. It holds onto the calories and inhibits weight loss. I lost 40lbs last year. I've lost 10lbs this year.

>**CREATING A SCHEDULE & GOOD SLEEP HYGIENE:**

It's essential to create a routine if you're able. I wake up and go to bed within the same two hour window. 
I go to bed between 10-12am and wake up between 8am-10am. I sleep 10-12 hours a day. I created good sleep hygiene. I take my medications and supplements at the same time every day. I eat and have my snacks at the same time every day. Everything functions best when I maintain this schedule. 

>**THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS I'VE LEARNED:**
                                     
1) I protect my peace by cultivating a routine. I don't think too far into the future. I focus on what I'm doing today. Though my physical health issues have changed, I respect my mind and body. I appreciate what it can do while honoring my limitations. Learning to recognize my mental and physical cues helps with resting, pacing, and avoiding PEM.                                              
2) Working on my mental health is crucial. I struggled with mental health issues in my journey to being diagnosed. I've taken medications and done counseling in the past to deal with those things. I thought those issues were resolved. However, becoming catastrophically disabled by COVID-19 has traumatized me. I'm going through the stages of grief. Based on my ME/CFS specialists' recommendation, I'm starting trauma therapy.                                                    
3) Smaller snack-sized meals work better for me 3-5 a day. Focus on more protein, natural carbohydrates, and natural sugar.                                                                                                                                     
4) Stay hydrated. Add electrolytes if needed. Limit or avoid alcohol, caffeine, coffee, and soda intake.                                                                                
5) Invest in a high-quality multivitamin and a few selected supplements. Add one at a time. It's easier to tell if your vitamins and supplements are helping or hurting you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
6) Use your doctors as resources. Don't take any medications without research and investigation yourself. Add medications one at a time, if possible. Medications can worsen existing symptoms, cause adverse reactions and/or side effects. I believe in taking the least amount of medications and supplements to manage my symptoms.                                 
7) Create a schedule and good sleep hygiene. I created a schedule for taking my medications and supplements, eating, and sleeping. It can take a while to achieve this. It's about progress, not perfection. Be kind to yourself.                                                                          
8) Mental health and mindset are important. I find things to laugh about every day. Gratitude is so important. Acceptance of my medical limitations and reality is essential. It doesn't mean I'm without hope. If I can achieve a 30-50% improvement in my overall symptoms, I'll consider it a win. I have a supportive and loving husband. I have lots of fur babies. They make me laugh every day.                                                 
9) Box breathing, meditation, and Yoga Nidra are beneficial at any level. If you're mild or moderate, you may he able to handle pilates, yoga, walks, and weight training. Always go at your own pace.                                                                                                             
10) Find things that occupy your time. I watch TV shows and movies on my cell phone with the brightness and volume turned down. I use an earplug in one ear and a noise canceling earbud in the other. I watch things that are funny, engaging, and/or distracting. I often have something streaming with thr volume barely audible. It's like white noise to me. I can't tolerate silence. It makes my thoughts spiral.                          

I was diagnosed Fibromyalgia, ME/CFS, and Hashimotos disease, an autoimmune hypothyroidism, Dysautonomia, and MCAS. All diagnosed after I developed long covid. I am severe and have been bedridden for 15 months. Many of my symptoms have significantly improved. My journey hasn't been linear. I didn't see any improvement until month 14. However, I finally have a regimen that works for me. I've improved 20% based on symptoms alone. I hope my journey gives hope to others who are severe like me.

1jj72bm,https://www.reddit.com/r/sicily/comments/1jj72bm/looking_for_peace_and_quiet/,Looking for peace and quiet,"Salve (salutamu?) a tutti!

I‚Äôm looking for advice concerning a place I should travel to. I‚Äôll stay in Sicily for 10-14 days in mid-April and I couldn‚Äôt be happier about that. Regrettably, I don‚Äôt know much about the island. I‚Äôve been lucky enough to visit Italy a few times, but mainly the northern part. Therefore I have a lot of (quite probably stupid) questions and I‚Äôll appreciate any responses.

My visit isn‚Äôt really supposed to be a ‚Äûsightseeing, travelling around, checking out famous monuments‚Äù one. I would love to visit Palermo, Syracuse and Catania, but for now I‚Äôd be okay with a few day trips at the end of my adventure. Rather, I wish to stay in some beautiful area with peace and quiet. The main issue is I don‚Äôt have a car (nor driving licence), so it cannot be absolutely remote. The perfect scenario would be me, the sea, my books, and hiking/running trails with beautiful views. Of course, I‚Äôm perfectly fine with towns and people and shops, no real need to turn into a forest witch lol.
I can either fly to Catania or Trapani. And so here comes my first issue:

	1. Do you think it‚Äôs better to stay in the Eastern or Western part of the island if I‚Äôm looking for a peaceful retreat? Or would it be best to spend 7 days on one side and 7 on the other? Do you have any recommendations for towns I could reach from the respective airports?

And while I‚Äôm at my anxious best, allow me to ask some more questions so I have a chance at an amazing journey without bothering the good people of Sicily.

	2. I‚Äôm a language nerd that speaks very basic Italian. Is it okay if I try to use it? Is it better to stick to English (fluent, not native)? What would be better perceived?
	3. On that note, is it okay that I speak absolutely no Sicilian? Are there any words I should learn? What should I know about how Sicilians view themselves, in terms of regional pride/autonomy, etc.?
	4. Is there anything I should know about the etiquette? Greeting people on the street, tipping, sitting alone in the restaurants and coffee shops for some time, going out after dark? I would also hate to say something ignorant.
	5. How is the public transport, actually? I‚Äôve been googling trains and buses, but a lot of information is from a few years back. Any app I could use?
	6. Can you cycle around Sicily? Are there any official trails?
	7. Just‚Ä¶ what do you recommend? Do you guys have any favourite places or local food? Please let me know!

Sorry about the long post and thanks to everybody that got to the end. Double thanks if you write a response. Grazie!",1,1742863576.0,sicily,0,1.0,False

1jj720s,https://v.redd.it/s7wbjsg5gqqe1,What‚Äôs going to kill my run?,"Full auto coffee shop setup, black coffee only. Got the card for instant order so my order terminal is useless, I just afk each round. Just broke 600 one tops and it seems like that number is growing exponentially but even on rainy days my door wait hasn‚Äôt particularly felt at risk. 

Currently working on getting a few more turning grabbers and tables to max out capacity for the current design. in total I find 2 more I can add, one in the very bottom left and one where my duplicator is. Should I mix in more metal tables or are the bar tables better for this kind of setup?

Should I try and transfer into a teleporter setup? Would that even fit more than my current setup? This is my first run past overtime 14 so any tips or advice for current/future runs is appreciated.",1,1742863551.0,PlateUp,0,1.0,False

1jj6uta,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1jj6uta/bipolar_spiritual_delusions/,Bipolar spiritual delusions?,"Hi everyone, 

I have also posted this in the cults subreddit but would like to get the opinions for everyone here. I am writing here because I don‚Äôt know where else to go or what to do. 

My husband was not a spiritual or religious person previously. Within the last year he has become heavily influenced by these new age spiritual ideas such as ‚Äútwin flames‚Äù ‚Äústarseeds‚Äù ‚Äúastrology‚Äù and ‚Äúkundalini awakening‚Äù to name a few.

Here‚Äôs a little backstory: In June of last year (3 months after we got married), he thinks he met his ‚Äútwin flame‚Äù via a dating website that he downloaded to ‚Äúget a dopamine rush to stay awake on a long drive for work.‚Äù They have never met in person as far as I know, but he believes this person or soul to be his ‚Äútwin flame‚Äù because he felt an explosion is his body while talking to her. He thinks this ‚Äúexplosion‚Äù was his ‚Äúpoint of no return‚Äù and that she caused a spontaneous kundalini awakening.

Since then, he has been OBSESSED with all of these new age spiritual ideas to the point where he cannot focus on anything other than ‚Äúgrounding‚Äù himself and reading online materials about these topics. He sits in the spare bedroom or at coffee shops all day every day researching these topics.

We have 4 year old twins and there has been a significant decline in the time he spends with them and me. He has said that he doesn‚Äôt care about anything that he cared about before his awakening. Materials no longer matter and the 3D world is just an illusion. He has since had this idea that I (his wife and mother of his children) am a ‚Äúcodependent distraction‚Äù from the 5D spiritual world.

His behaviors are polar opposite of the person I married. He believes he is a better person for all of this but from my point of view he has turned into someone with narcissistic tendencies.

Does new age spiritualism seem cultish to anyone here? Could this be consistent with bipolar disorder? I feel like this has brainwashed him into not taking accountability for his actions. He believes that he has no free will. That whatever is supposed to happen is going to happen. Nothing matters to him anymore. Family and people don‚Äôt matter to him anymore. It‚Äôs all about the stars and vibrations and soul ties.

Edit: I feel like I should add that he started dosing himself with steroids to ‚Äúget big‚Äù right before our wedding. I told him I didn‚Äôt think that was a good idea. I also vividly remember telling him that if he starts acting differently we know why. His dad took steroids in his early 20s and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder shortly after. So, there is a family history of mental illness enhanced by steroid use. His dad became aggressive, but since he is not physically aggressive he doesn‚Äôt believe he has a mental disorder.",3,1742862982.0,bipolar,2,1.0,False

The setups, the manipulation.  Like, bring me coffee to work.   She would call me.  Then when she ran off, first thing she did was have work reference me constantly showing up and calling.   We had to prove she was the one calling, but the damage was done.  I won in court, but to all her co-workers I was this harasser.  She told everyone I was abusive and it nearly broke me, until the judge gave me everything I asked for and said I had been the primary caregiver to our kids.  

Turned out she was cheating on me too.  

She then called my job and had me fired citing abuse.  

We somewhat repaired for the sake of our kids.   She asked that I take the kids (off the record) far more than the order set out.  Instead of 50/50 they were probably here 75% of the time.   This went on for close to 10 years.  

If I did something she didn‚Äôt like I‚Äôd get a 2-3 week silent treatment but at least the kids were healthy.  

Then it was like the narcissist exploded.  She found out I came into some money.  She took my kid from school on my time.  She called me abusive (to our kids).  She told her new work I was abusive.  She did this silent treatment which continues to this day, talking months.  

She started neglecting our kids.  It was like taking out this narcissistic jealousy on anything connected to me.   She intentionally made them miss school.  One withdrew into a serious depression.  

We went to a mediator.   I swear I didn‚Äôt know the person across from me, who seemed to suggest I was stalking her and made up story after story.  I tried to explain this was all related to this money, but mediator seemed to believe her (without any proof).  When I had the texts proving this was all a lie, I was told I can‚Äôt show them.  

So you get a lawyer who warns her to do her job as a parent.  Does that stop her?  No.  

It just feels like I am on the wrong side of the punching bag right now.  She tells everyone I am evil, has tried to turn my kids against me, gives me the silent treatment suggesting she cut off her abuser, and I sit here and take it day after day, my reputation in shreds all over again.

I(19F) have been dating my boyfriend(20M) for about 3 months (almost 4 now). A little background. Me and my boyfriend met at work back in September of last year. I was really shy and didn't have anyone to talk to, since my work is mostly full of high schoolers that know each other from school. He was the first person to talk to me and I had fallen for him hard. He was good with the kids (I work at a swim school), sweet and thoughtful, always checked up on me, and overall we sometimes would hangout outside of work because he liked to get to know each new employees.

He had asked me to a little coffee date in December and we both realized we had feelings for each other. So we made it official and so far I feel it has been going well. 

Recently I had started to notice him act a bit odd. I'm an anxious person, (I have grown up in a toxic and abusive home life (which he knows about this) so my brain likes to think if there is some thing going on with someone, I am prone to think it is my fault a lot. I am working on realizing that not everything my fault, its a work in progress lol. 

But I had started to prod him a little bit to make sure if he was okay and to assure him I am here if there was anything wrong. He told me for about a week that everything was fine and he was just tired until he finally told me last night we needed to have a talk.

Something we were planning to do was I was going to move in with him and his parents in the summer because mentally, I can't live with my family anymore and I was ready to get out of that toxic home. I met his parents once, it was short but they seem like really sweet people who love their son a lot. 

He had offered a lot over the past month to have me move in with him as well, so this was something he had planned for a while and I think his mom was even on board with a couple set rules here and there. But during our conversation last night, he brought up that we wouldn't be able to live together because he wasn't mentally, physically, or financially ready for it. (Which to this, I was confused why he offered if he felt like this but I understood completely and was fine with this.) 

What really made me upset was that he told his mom about something I shared with him privately.

I drink on occasion when I feel really depressed or when I used to feel s\*icidal as a teenager because of how awful I grew up. The last time I did drink was back in October and I have been doing better since I know its not healthy for me and its not a good coping mechanism. I'm also in therapy since its better then trying to use a bottle to fix my problems and issues. But thats not something I would EVER tell anyone because I don't want any of the friends or family I have to judge me or be upset with that decision I made. 

It was something I opened up with my boyfriend when we dated because I truly did trust him, as dumb as it was now that I look at it. But since he told his mom, she doesn't want an ""alcoholic"" in her home and was probably another reason why I can't stay with them. (Again, I only had the one wine night that October for the entire year)

I didn't say anything when he brought it up, I was to scared to say anything because I didn't want to escalate anything since he seemed to be supportive. (They are a very religious family too I might add) I mostly have been short and have been ignoring him lately because I just keep crying thinking about my bad first impression is with his family. 

I don't think they like me, I'm nervous about what my boyfriend has been telling his parents that I have told him now, but I love him too much to confront how I feel violated.

1jj6p2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/1jj6p2i/how_i_landed_my_first_internship/,How I landed my first internship,"I started searching for an internship on spring, but because I didn‚Äôt know what to do, I wasted several months during that time. I finally landed my first fall internship at the end of summer.I was completely unfamiliar with the job positions related to my major and interests. I didn‚Äôt know which websites were suitable for students looking for internships, how to prepare my resume and cover letter, or how to get ready for different interview stages. At first, I couldn‚Äôt even pass the phone screen.

First, clarify what you want to do in the future.

For me, if I‚Äôm not interested in something, I can‚Äôt see myself doing it as a job. I tried applying to several different directions (still a little relevant to my major) and joined school projects to gain real-world experience (with lower requirements than interns). After trying roles in 2 areas, I finally landed my first internship in the 3rd.üòÇ

Secondly, move toward your ideal role and find projects that can strengthen your resume.

Based on my internship and full-time job search, and coffee chats with seniors and hiring managers, they all mentioned that **a candidate's major and school name are not the most important factors** (unless the company specifically hires from target schools). What truly matters is **how relevant your projects and experience are to the role you‚Äôre applying for**. For example, even if you graduate from Wharton with a finance major, without any data-related projects, it doesn‚Äôt guarantee you‚Äôll land a data scientist role at a local startup. My first internship and later my full-time job, were both unrelated to my major. But I supplemented my experience with industry-related school projects and identified relevant courses on Coursera that matched the job requirements. I like to think of those new courses as forming my minor major.

Thirdly, revise your resume and start searching for internships.  
When you have projects to include on your resume, present them using the STAR method, clearly highlight and quantify the results you achieved, and use ChatGPT to help tailor your resume to the positions you‚Äôre applying for. (For full-time job searching, I combined Teal with ChatGPT, since full-time applications are usually more competitive and restrictive than internships.) I initially used Indeed to search for internships, but there weren‚Äôt many openings. The same goes for LinkedIn, it‚Äôs better suited for full-time roles. You can still follow recruiters or managers on LinkedIn for opportunity posts, or connect with alumni for potential referrals, though in my case, I never made it. I finally switched to Handshake, which turned out to be a smarter choice. I landed my first internship there, and many of my schoolmates found theirs on the same platform.

Fourth, prepare your own interview cheat sheet.

It's the most difficult part for me. I actually started receiving interviews after several applications, but I kept failing and never knew how to solve it. I experienced the most awkward group interview in the world. I even failed the phone screen (I didn't even know how to introduce myself!). I realized I had to prepare my own cheat sheet. It's unhelpful to directly use what ChatGPT generates based on your resume, you must add your own thoughts and practice thousands of times to make sure you're completely familiar with your story. I checked Glassdoor‚Äôs communities to see ex-candidates' reviews, used AMA‚Äôs question prediction feature, and asked ChatGPT to give me example answers tailored to my resume. For general roles, I built a cheat sheet for frequently asked phone screens and behavioral questions. You can even find patterns in tech interviews. For specific roles, I still used this outline and added the details.",4,1742862519.0,internships,0,0.83,False

I‚Äôm watching videos, perusing this subreddit, and doing some reading, but I would love to ask the community their thoughts on the following. My main goal for this is weight loss and just to be healthy overall. My main worries are having too much salt, and not getting all the nutrients I need. I can‚Äôt bring myself to eating liver as I‚Äôve never really liked it, same with other meat organs.


1) I‚Äôm hoping I can have my coffee in the mornings still. I usually have it with a little bit of cream. How bad is this?

2) How bad are vegetables mixed in with this diet? Not an excessive amount, but the occasional one. Like having lettuce wraps with my beef. I know that with those who want to follow a doctrine this is a big no-no, but in terms of getting weight loss results and being of good health. Do vegetables take away from this?

3) My plan is to eat a lot of eggs, ground beef, burger patties, chicken, fish, and bacon. What about cheese like cheddar cheese and cream cheese? Wouldn‚Äôt these give me the fat I need?

4) Speaking of fat, if I ate the above meats, is that enough fat in the diet or do I actually have to eat butter, etc. Is it enough to just cook with butter or do I need to make sure and be careful that I add more? How much should I track this?

I figured at first it did by the taste but I told myself it was just my anxiety and drank it anyways. I drink decaf everyday and to me it doesn't taste as bold and I know it has traces of caffeine but the way I felt was definetly due to a lot more caffeine than a decaf would have. My sister also said hers did nothing for her. 

I could tell by the way I felt ""speedy"", shaky, sweaty and a feeling I get in my body and stomach when I have regular coffee. I tried to ignore it but I kept getting palpitations.

Favorite character:

Least favorite trophy:

New Girlfriend: Kyouko ""Kyo"" Nakamura (‰∏≠Êùë‰∫¨Â≠ê ‚Äì ""The Queen of Vice"")

Age: 16 years

Specialty: Video games, especially strategy games, FPS and Battle Royales.

Personality: Antisocial, introverted, competitive and a little sarcastic. Although she is very good at what she does, she has a hard time connecting with other people, especially since she spends most of her time playing video games. She is very direct and does not usually show much affection explicitly, but she has great admiration for Rentar≈ç, although she hides it.

Special ability: Strategic mind and ultra-fast reflexes. She has a surprising ability for shooting and strategy games, which makes her very competitive and difficult to beat.

Weak point: His loneliness. She has become so accustomed to being isolated in her game world that she has a hard time integrating with others, and is afraid of being rejected.

Iconic phrase: ""I'm not looking to be the best... I just want no one to bother me while I play.""



---

Chapter: ‚ÄúVice and Victory!‚Äù

Scene 1: The Meeting with Rentar≈ç

Kyo is known at school as the ""antisocial gamer."" Most people see her as someone not worth approaching because she is not interested in social interactions. He's always in his corner of the school with his headphones and his laptop, playing games.

Rentar≈ç (watching from afar): ""What is that girl doing all the time alone?""


One day, when he goes over to talk to her, he notices that Kyo is playing an online battle game, with reflexes so fast he can barely keep up.

Kyo (without looking at Rentar≈ç, focused on the screen): ""Don't bother me while I play. If you want to know something, ask me later.""


Rentar≈ç, intrigued by her skill and attitude, decides to get closer and ask her if she would like to be part of the group. Despite her reservations, Kyo accepts, as she secretly feels a little lonely.

Kyo (looking sideways): ""I'm not good at that... 'friendship' thing. But maybe I could play in a group.""



---

Scene 2: The Battle Royale Tournament at School

One day, the school organizes a Battle Royale tournament among all the students in the computer room. Rentar≈ç's girlfriends are excited to participate, but realize that Kyo is an expert.

Rentar≈ç: ""Let's all play together! It will be fun.""

Kyo (with a cocky smile): ""Fun for you. I'm going to win.""


While the other brides fight to stay alive in the game, Kyo shows impressive skill in the Battle Royale, using quick strategies and perfect aim. The other girlfriends can't help but notice that Kyo has an almost inhuman level of concentration.

Kyo (while defeating another player): ""I told you not to bother me.""

Karane (shouting from the other computer): ""That's not fair! She's been playing this her whole life!""


At the end of the tournament, Kyo takes the victory, leaving all the other brides surprised.

Rentar≈ç (admired): ""Incredible, Kyo, you are a true master at this.""

Kyo (blushing slightly): ""I can beat anyone, but I never care much about winning, I just want to play. I'm not good at making friends, you know.""



---

Scene 3: The Solitary Gamer and the Bond with Rentar≈ç

Despite her victory, Kyo feels a little disconnected from the rest of the group, who are celebrating their achievement. However, Rentar≈ç, who sees her isolation, decides to approach her.

Rentar≈ç (after the tournament, inviting her to coffee): ""You know, it's impressive what you do. But... have you ever thought about giving up video games for a while?""

Kyo (thoughtfully): ""And do what? Talk to people? I'm not very interested in that.""

Rentar≈ç (smiling kindly): ""Sometimes, it's good to find a balance. Video games are great, but so is having friends.""


Little by little, Kyo begins to open up more to Rentar≈ç. Reluctantly at first, but as she sees him more often, she begins to feel comfortable with him and the other girlfriends. Although he is still a bit antisocial, Kyo begins to integrate his gaming life with social interaction, and discovers that it is not as bad as he thought.


---

Scene 4: A Team Game

One day, during an online team game, the girlfriends group up to play a strategy game with Kyo as the leader. Despite being an expert, Kyo has to learn to delegate responsibilities and trust others. Rentar≈ç, as always, acts as her emotional support.

Kyo (giving orders to the brides): ""Don't stay behind! I need you to cover my back while I take the area. Rentar≈ç, reload your weapons!""

Rentar≈ç (smiling): ""Yes, captain!""


In the end, the match ends in victory, and Kyo finally accepts that teamwork has its own charm. Although she remains a passionate gamer, she now also values ‚Äã‚Äãhuman connections.

Kyo (with a small smile): ""Not bad... winning as a team.""



---

Epilogue: Kyo and the Harem

Despite his antisocial attitude and competitive nature, Kyo becomes an important part of the group. The other girlfriends respect her for her skill in video games, but they also learn to see her more human side.

1. She is still competitive, but sometimes, at night, she stays chatting with the other girlfriends.


2. He teaches Rentar≈ç and the others advanced video game strategies, sometimes with great enthusiasm.


3. Although he does not show it openly, Kyo begins to see Rentar≈ç as more than a playmate.



Kyo (thinking while playing): ""I don't really like social relationships... but, maybe, with him, I could learn to enjoy it.""

1jj6f3p,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongCovid/comments/1jj6f3p/my_covid19_experience/,MY COVID-19 EXPERIENCE.,"Summary

    I contracted an COVID-19 infection in February 2022. My first symptom was a sensation of not being able to take a full breath without yawning. At that time, I was experiencing significant bloating and had hyperventilation attacks and panic attacks without realizing it. I made multiple trips to the hospital and was misdiagnosed with pleurisy. I noticed that my heart rate would spike when I stood up, but the doctors assured me everything was okay. 

As time went on, I started dealing with various stomach issues. In August 2022, I experienced a severe headache that I believed to be a migraine, although I never had it officially confirmed. Based on my research, the symptoms matched what others described: a severe headache, tunnel vision, missing parts of my vision, sensitivity to light, and severe nausea. However, the most troubling symptom was the feeling of being high, which I thought would subside after the initial experience. Unfortunately, I woke up feeling the same and have felt stuck in a state akin to being high ever since. This sensation tends to worsen with increased sinus pressure or excessive movement. 

Since then, I've become very sensitive to light. Interestingly, I sometimes feel a bit better, even if briefly, about 20 minutes after having a heavy meal, like a burger, despite knowing it's not the healthiest choice. I believe that most of my nearly 10,000 symptoms began in 2023, but I struggle to pinpoint when each symptom started or ended, given the sheer volume of issues to track.

I plan to list each of my symptoms below, doing my best to provide a detailed account of what I'm experiencing. Throughout this ordeal, I've also had consistent brain fog, which I suspect may be linked to poor memory due to anxiety, depression, or long COVID. I can't recall the exact time in 2023, but I remember dealing with frequent blood sugar drops for months without understanding the cause. Although I no longer experience that, I occasionally feel close to having low blood sugar. The symptoms I will list below have been present on and off, or sometimes continuously, since I fell ill. This summary captures the timeline of some of my symptoms as I remember them.

**Swollen Fingers**  
My fingers are swollen and turn red and blotchy. They feel stiff and larger when I bend them, and I can feel the creases where my fingers bend more than usual. This sensation may worsen with movement or small physical activities.

**Mucus Drainage**  
I experience constant mucus production and often have a stuffy nose, requiring me to clear my throat frequently because it never feels clear. Sometimes, when drinking from a cup without a straw, I notice that my saliva pulls from the cup due to mucus present in my throat.

**Brain Fog**  
I have difficulty thinking and problem-solving as quickly as I used to, which I believe may be related to my sinus pressure, though I‚Äôm not entirely sure.

**Sinus Pressure**  
There‚Äôs a consistent pressure between my eyes and on my eyebrows. I believe this symptom is linked to my vision problems, dissociation, and brain fog.

**Sensitivity to Light**  
When I go outside or drive, everything appears brighter than normal, which irritates me. I prefer wearing sunglasses during the day to reduce discomfort. I often experience afterimages, where outlines of objects linger in my vision.

**Floaters**  
I‚Äôve had multiple floaters in my vision that haven‚Äôt gone away. One in particular, which seems very long, has been present for at least two years.

**Constipation**  
I am frequently constipated, regardless of what I eat. When I do manage to go, I usually produce small, shaped stools.

**Diarrhea**  
I experience diarrhea occasionally, potentially triggered by specific foods, such as coffee with a lot of milk or dairy.

**Bloating**  
I have felt bloated for the past three years, often experiencing a ball of pressure under my right rib with every breath. This symptom causes considerable shortness of breath, sometimes prompting me to sit up at night to breathe more comfortably. Often, I need to yawn to take a full, satisfying breath.

**Fatigue**  
I often feel unrested, weak, and tired, regardless of how much sleep I get‚Äî90% of the time, I feel this way.

**Tinnitus**  
I experience a constant ringing in my ears.

**Heartburn**  
Almost everything I eat causes heartburn, even drinking water.

**Asthma**  
I believe my asthma is exacerbated by the heartburn.

**Dissociation**  
At times, I feel as though I'm drunk or high, and my balance becomes slightly off. This sensation seems to worsen with sinus pressure, which I think can be influenced by specific foods or excessive movement.

**Joint Pain**  
I often experience joint pain, particularly when I wake up. My joints, including my wrists, ankles, and knees, pop frequently. Bending my knees for just a minute can lead to soreness and discomfort when I try to unbend them.

**Sternum Popping**  
I believe the popping sensation in my sternum is related to inflammation of the lining, as indicated by the results from my endoscopy and colonoscopy.

**Tingling in Feet & Hands**  
I occasionally feel tingling in my hands and feet, similar to the sensation of them ""falling asleep."" This feeling often coincides with my swollen symptoms, and it tends to occur more when I transition between hot and cold temperatures.

**Memory Problems**  
I have issues primarily with short-term memory.

**Severe Anxiety**  
All these symptoms contribute to my anxiety. I notice that when my anxiety worsens, many of my symptoms tend to increase as well. I do not believe that these issues are solely attributed to anxiety; I had considered that possibility and ruled it out some time ago.

**Blood Sugar Drops**  
I experience episodes of low blood sugar, resulting in sweating and shakiness. I never have high blood sugar; I only encounter drops. Eating something sweet helps me feel better almost instantly.

1jj6c8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyatt/comments/1jj6c8o/fuji_speedway_hotel_guidereview/,Fuji Speedway Hotel guide/review,"Recently stayed two nights here and had some thoughts and tips for anyone thinking of staying here in the future.

This was probably my favorite hotel out of the 4 that I stayed at during my Japan trip.

**Booking**

I booked a cash rate via a Hyatt Prive Agent u/Traveller350 the difference between the rate was $575 for the regular cash rate vs $589 for the Prive Rate. Getting a welcome amenity + $100 of property credit was well worth the $14 difference. The booking process was smooth, u/Traveller350 was very helpful and proactive in answering my questions. A secure link was sent to enter my CC info and there were no hiccups.

I already had a previous cash rate booking with an SUA applied, so I messaged my concierge to work with the hotel to transfer the SUA from my cash rate booking to the Prive rate booking as there were no more suites available when I wanted to switch. They completed that quickly and I had my standard suite Prive booking. (Grand Prix Suite, 2 Twin Beds, Circuit View)

If you want the Mt. Fuji view room I would email the hotel early on to request a switch as when I checked in they were unavailable. (I ended up enjoying the Circuit view very much though)

\---

**Transportation**

I would HIGHLY recommend a rental car for this location. The hotel does provide a shuttle that will take you to Gotemba station, but if you want to explore the surrounding areas, you're on your own. Besides the Fuji speedway, there is not much around the hotel to do within walking distance as it is located in a ruralish area. I rented through Toyata Rent-A-Car at Mishima station as we came from Kyoto. For those of you that are Hertz gold plus members, you can use the Hertz affiliate link to save 10%. [https://rent.toyota.co.jp/affiliate\_rental/main.aspx?site=hertz](https://rent.toyota.co.jp/affiliate_rental/main.aspx?site=hertz) The website is in Japanese so just use Chrome to translate. You can ask the staff when you pick up the car to add an ETC card for tolls (also highly recommend). The Mishima location has staff that can speak english and help you set up the car navigation. (We ended up using google maps for the entirety of our stay as it was most reliable)

I would suggest to save some potential headache with the rental car to just purchase the insurance Toyota offers as credit card car insurance coverage is dubious outside of North America and I heard it's a pain to claim stuff if it happens in a foreign country. The 10% I saved with Hertz pretty much covered the extra insurance charge anyways. The roads in Japan can be narrow, so save yourself some trouble.

I went in early March and I would recommend you option a car with snow tires. It started snowing one day (only a few inches) as we were driving up/down the mountain roads and many kei cars were stuck as they already took off their winter tires.

Beware of road closures when it starts snowing. When we were driving back from Hakone we had to take a route that took 2hrs vs the 40min drive that we had in the morning.

For those of you intimated by right hand drive cars, don't be. I was definitely a little nervous at first but after a few minutes of just following traffic and telling myself to keep on the left side of the road it became second nature. You will however, activate your wipers on accident sometimes. This is unavoidable :)

\---

**The Hotel**

We pulled in the wrong way at the front of the hotel (oops) but they kindly took our luggage and told us we could park in the underground garage. Check in was smooth, they told us about our Prive and Globalist benefits and also gave me info about the Driving experience that I booked (more below). Also offered 4pm checkout.

The room was very spacious. Large living room, outside balcony to view the racetrack, automated blinds, and two bathrooms, one with a shower and tub. Beds were comfortable and they provide nice slippers and bathrobes to wear. On the living room table we were given their special madeleines, matcha chocolate, some local snacks, and a bottle of craft brew Tea. (I think this is the Prive welcome amenity)

If you book a circuit view room, don't plan on it being quiet during the day as loud car noises will travel thru the glass. This wasn't a problem for us as we drove to the lakes during the day. The balcony is nice to have though as you can sit and watch the cars on the track.

Globalist breakfast is in the Italian restaurant downstairs with a good mix of local and western options. They just ask for room number and let you in. It's buffet style with an additional menu where you can order small hot dishes from. Very good in my opinion.

The hotel also had a motorsports museum which consists of one half floor at the entrance and a second floor accessible via elevator. I believe if you stay in the hotel a ticket is 1300 yen. A nice visit if you're into cars.

We got dinner one night in the Trofeo Lounge as the Italian restaurant had a long wait and the Robata OYAMA needed reservations. The food was just meh and overpriced. I got the croque monsieur which was ok, and also the Carbonara which was gross as the noodles were very underdone. Also got something called the Octopus Frit which was just fried calamari and was very salty. They were also out of the desserts we wanted. Would not recommend the Lounge for food unless you have no other options.

The hotel does have an Onsen which was much needed after a lot of walking. You check in at the Spa desk and put your stuff in the locker room. They have stations where you can clean yourself first before entering the Onsen. For the mens room, there was an indoor and outdoor section. There's also a sauna and cold plunge. Upon exit there's a station where you can get a cold cup of green tea, and there's a small fridge under the table where you can enjoy a nice glass of coffee milk (really good)

There is also a pool but I did not check it out as the Onsen was too good.

Upon checkout they went over the room charges. The $100 Prive credit cannot be used for the Driving Experience nor the cafe shop. I had assumed that the credit can go towards the experience so we only ended up using \~$50 of the credit.

\---

**Experience Driving**

The hotel offers a unique opportunity to drive 3 laps on the Fuji speedway with a Toyota rental car.

You can book it here: [https://fujispeedwayhotel.rezdy.com/673375/experience-driving-rental-vehicle](https://fujispeedwayhotel.rezdy.com/673375/experience-driving-rental-vehicle)

The booking process for me was a bit odd and I learned a lot from it. Hopefully this will help others.

The booking schedule is only offered for the current month and next month, and not everyday is there experience driving offered. So for instance I had to start looking in February for my March stay, Something odd is that booking for March opened up on the 3rd of Feb. I didn't realize this and all of the auto cars were booked up already. I emailed the hotel and was put on a waitlist for a car. Luckily a few days before leaving for Japan, I got the email that I could grab the GR Supra! I had to move train tickets around though, so had to be a bit flexible with that.

This is what I recommend you do if you want an easier time: Try emailing the hotel after booking to see if they can book for you instead of you waiting for bookings to open.

The day I booked also included a photoshoot on the grid, this isn't offered for every date as well.

We had to rush to the hotel in the morning to get checked in, and they provided a Fuji speedway pass as well as a map of how to get to the driving experience checkin. We originally went to the wrong gate as there are two sides to the map. One brings you to the go kart track and the other was where we needed to be. The gate closest to the hotel is the right one. We arrived a few minutes late and got checked in. Just needed to sign a form and show my international drivers license and was shown the car. There is also a rule card given out explaining the process, no overtaking, extreme acceleration, etc.

We waited for some actual racers to clear the track first before we were let into it. We parked on the grid and everyone was let out to take photos, they also had staff who could help you take photos as well. The general public is also allowed to bring their own cars to driving days, so in addition to our hotel Toyotas, there were some regular commuter and enthusiast cars as well. After photos, we started driving. I started in regular drive mode to get a feel for the car and track. The actual driving is relatively slow, there is a pace car in front and back and I never made it past 80mph on the straightaway due to following distance.

The rules say you can't intentionally slow down then speed up but I noticed everyone doing it on the straightaway so I joined in.

After the first lap I switched to the paddle shifters and had a blast. 3 laps go by quick so have fun but don't do anything stupid.

FYI if you want to rent the Automatic GR Yaris from the Hotel or Toyota Rent-A-Car, be aware that the version they sell in Japan is basically the shell of a GR Yaris (wide body, badges, CF roof) but it has the drivetrain from a normal Yaris. It's literally for looks only.

\---

**Public road test drive**

The hotel also offers a 4 hour rental car that rotates every month for people who have booked suites or those who have a regular room AND a spa treatment booking of 90 minutes or more.

I emailed the hotel and the SUA does qualify for this test drive.

But basically you just get the car to yourself for 4 hours and can drive anywhere. This is also something you have to book. The cars available (usually one Auto and one Manual) will show up on this page [https://fujispeedwayhotel.rezdy.com/index](https://fujispeedwayhotel.rezdy.com/index)

For the March 2025 it was 86GRMN (MT) (one of 100 ever built :o ) and GR86 (AT). There are two timeslots available, morning 8am and afternoon 1pm.

They will cancel bookings due to bad weather which is unfortunately what happened during my stay. The cars did not have snow tires so they didn't let us take them out for driving (even though the roads were pretty clear in the morning after the snow)

After checkout though, the person helping us with the luggage did take out the keys for both cars and let me sit/start them up and rev them, as well as take pictures so that was very nice of them!",3,1742861508.0,hyatt,0,0.8,False

I'm in my 40s, 5'7, was 23 BMI (now 22), consider myself a flexitarian and walk my golden retriever 30-60 min each day.  I have a family with teen boys still at home.  Cholesterol kept creeping up till it hit a fever pitch in November (thanks age or perimenopause or who knows what)

**Numbers:**  
Total Cholesterol 274 down to 194  
triglycerides 114 to 91  
HDL 55 to 57  
LDL 196 to 119  
Ratio 5 to 3.4

**What I did:**

80-90% of the time I eat plant based and try to avoid dairy, eggs and meat, poultry.  I also met with a dietician, covered by my insurance, and decided to watch saturated fat too.  I make sure I was eating fish and salmon and using good oils like olive oil.  I could do better.  I'm a very busy working mom and I love PB&Js and simple food but love vegetables and fruits and grains and legumes.

Here's a typical ""week day"".  

Breakfast:  Cheerios with oatmilk or nonfat greek yogurt with a low sugar whey protein and blackberries/kiwis/chia seeds.

Lunch:  PB&J, carrots and hummus and maybe chips or seed crackers.  OR  nonfat greek yogurt with green onions/salt pepper/chia seeds/flax seeds/mustard/dill as a dip with lots of raw veggies like carrots, cucumbers, hearts of palm, peppers, etc. and seed crackers (I know it's odd)

Dinner:  I typically make a normal dinner for my family and then modify it for me.  Example:  steak sandwiches with peppers and onions and then green beans and a potato salad (my steak sandwich will be salmon).  OR I really got into these silken tofu sauces that are seriously amazing.  Everyone loves them.  I can throw chicken or meatballs in for my family.  Fish for me if I want it on top....salad.  [Silken Tofu Pasta Sauce with Roasted Red Pepper - Desiree Nielsen](https://desireerd.com/silken-tofu-pasta-sauce-with-roasted-red-pepper/).  

I take a multivitamin and a fish oil vitamin.  

I still want to have a hot dog at a baseball game or lattes and pastries with my mom a couple times a month, popcorn at the movies, etc.  That's the 10-20%.  I might have shrimp in my sushi or chicken in tacos, eggs once a week or less....etc.  But I really stay pretty far away from red meat.  Maybe I'll have a filet mignon once or a couple times a year.  A really great dessert once or twice a week, etc.

I found that I probably eat a little less protein and I'm actually doing well and down 6 pounds.  Do you know how hard it is to lose weight in your 40s, especially when you're a woman and especially if you're probably only carrying 10-15 from your ideal weight.

The hardest thing for me is half and half in my coffee.  I do not drink, smoke, etc...but I loooove coffee and have a few cups a day.  The only thing that comes close is the NutPods Half and Half.  it's pricey.  But all that tempeh and tofu I'm buying in place of chicken and steak saves a little;)

I hope this helps someone.  I was so resistant to go plant based.  But 80-90% of the time isn't that bad honestly, I decided before this retesting that if I needed a statin, I was going to stay eating this way anyhow, but maybe add half n half back in;)",4,1742861420.0,Cholesterol,1,1.0,False

You‚Äôve already dipped your toes into the market with $SPLG, $NVDA, and a penny stock, but the question is whether it‚Äôs wise to allocate $1k of your $12k savings into stocks.  

Here‚Äôs the deal: while investing can grow your wealth, it‚Äôs crucial to maintain a safety net. A good rule of thumb is to keep 3-6 months of living expenses in cash or a high-yield savings account. If $12k covers that, then investing $1k could be reasonable. However, if that‚Äôs your entire emergency fund, you might want to hold off.  

Your current portfolio shows you‚Äôre already diversified with $SPLG (a low-cost S&P 500 ETF) and $NVDA (a high-growth tech stock). The penny stock is risky, so tread carefully. Instead of chasing quick gains, consider building a solid foundation with ETFs like $SPLG or $VOO, which offer steady, long-term growth.  

If you‚Äôre eager to invest, start small‚Äîmaybe $100-$200 per paycheck‚Äîand prioritize building your emergency fund. Remember, slow and steady wins the race. Coffee and treats won‚Äôt make or break your portfolio, but consistent, disciplined investing will.

over the next sixth months he would accuse me daily multiple times of me cheating on him based off of how i looked, how i talked to people, how i talked, how i talked about things going on in my life, based off how other people looked at me, etc. an example: we went to a get together at my friend's place, a random guy i had never met was there wearing the shirt of a very popular band that was one of my favorite bands. i didn't speak to him once at that get together. all night at home my ex was accusing me of playing a joke on him with this guy that i was ""secretly dating"" and we were laughing at him behind his back. another example: i worked at a coffee shop. my ex decided to come in one day, he was already in a bad mood. the mail lady was trying to bring a large package in and asked if i could help her. a guy sitting down volunteered to help her, and my ex turned to me and was yelling at me in the coffee shop about how i'm embarrassing him and i'm cheating on him. one last example: we had one of my ex's friends over who was opening up to us about his depression to us. after he left, my ex refused to speak to me and i begged him to tell me what was wrong. he told me that he could tell i was into his friend by the way i was faced in my chair towards him. 

anyways. the list goes on and on. now i'm in a new relationship, and my current boyfriend is really sweet. i see some of the same insecurities that my ex had, but my current boyfriend is not even close to behaving like my ex did.

Jennifer stared deep into her sister‚Äôs eyes, anticipating the answer, yet hoping she would hear something different. She looked down and focused on her cup of coffee, still swirling like a black maelstrom.

‚ÄúWho?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe man in the coat,‚Äù replied the young woman after some hesitation. Jennifer stayed quiet, her hands now over her eyes, on the verge of tears.

‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs him, Jen.‚Äù A waiter approached and asked if everything was fine. Agatha gestured with her hand, describing a dismissive wave, and smiled. He walked away.

‚ÄúDo you remember?‚Äù

¬†

It began when Agatha was six. Jennifer was seven.

They slept in separate bedrooms, both on the second floor. Every night, he appeared: a shadowy figure, his face invisible, standing on the room‚Äôs threshold ‚Äì waiting, watching. He was wearing a sort of large coat. Some days he used to simply stay there, quiet as midnight. Others, though, the man approached Agatha in a slow, steady pace. At this moment, she would hide under the blankets and try to ignore the ghastly visitant. A dead weight lay next to her, and a heavy, agitated breath resounded in her ear. All she remembered then was falling asleep.

A whole year passed before she told her sister. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen him, too,‚Äù answered Jennifer in a shivering voice. That morning, they embraced and cried in the schoolyard, and promised to take care of each other for as long as they lived. They asked their parents to share their room again. Agatha‚Äôs, the smallest, was then used as a storage area. The apparitions stopped from that day. When their parents divorced and the sisters went back to separate rooms, they were afraid the man in the coat would return. Just for safety, they would sneak into each other‚Äôs bed as soon as the lights were turned off. But there was no trace of any presence, save the cold wind in the trees.

¬†

‚ÄúI know it sounds ridiculous,‚Äù muttered Agatha. ‚ÄúBut you have to believe me, he‚Äôs back. And the worst part‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not your fault, Agatha,‚Äù weeped her sister. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt blame you for this‚Ä¶ and still, it‚Äôs about time you let it go. Don‚Äôt get me wrong: I‚Äôm really glad the bastard is dead now, but you can‚Äôt keep holding on to this. He can‚Äôt hurt us anymore. Stop this, Agatha. Our father is gone forever.‚Äù

I‚Äôve been thinking about something and wanted to see if anyone else has considered it.

Our coffee shop is close to a high school. Has anyone ever explored partnering with the school to offer internships to students in exchange for college credit or school credit?

Back when I was in high school, we had a program where seniors could leave early to do internships. I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs possible to set up something similar at a coffee shop.

If anyone has experience with this or ideas on how it could work, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts!

My roomate is always acting like she's a miserable over worked mother of 8 with bills and such a hard life.

The reality is she works retail for 25 hours a week, and gets to only pay 500/mo bills in total to live in a 2b 1.5  br apartment where rent is 1400, power is 80-150, and utilities are about 250/mo. I pay all the rest. She basically has 100% access to every part of this space aside my bedroom, but acts like I force her to stay in her bedroom which is admittedly the smaller room. The only things that belong to me outside my room is the coffee maker which I let them use, a few mugs, and my game consoles (again so they can be used by anyone). 

She is constantly saying shit like Ugh I Work SO HARD im SO TIRED and you expect me to be a maid??? Ugh I'm in a BAD MOOD because im SO TIRED from my 5 hour shift why dont you understand. Why don't you pity me im SO POOR I cant afford food, and you expect me to SHARE my food with you??? (but she feeds any guests she has over, for free, and says ""guests shoudln't have to clean up after themselves""....)

I'm just so annoyed, because like, anytime we interact she's stomping around, ignoring me or acting like she's the worlds most unfortunate abuse victim. I was petting her cat the other day and she woke up, slammed her door open, beelined up to me, took the cat out of my arms, and walked away. then bitched at the cat???? for being annoying??? like what? I'm sorry your cat came to me cuz ur always favoring the other cat and ignoring her bc shes ""bitchy and needy"". I'm never gonna fucking ignore an animal no matter how shit the owners are. So yeah when your cat runs up to me I'm going to scoop her up and carry her like a purrito while I do my morning chores.

I'ts getting so awkward that like, I don't ever want to leave my room. and when I see roomate come home at the same time as me I will stay in my car and wait. The only time she ever talks to me normally is so she can like, drama dump something stupid at me and ignore any of my input on the convo. Usually, also because she's high while doing it.

Also, she fucked off for 3 months at the end of last year to go to another state and mooch for free on someones couch, and apparently thought it was completely normal to not have to pay rent during this time, and forced a homeless mutual friend to move in and pay her rent. only to come back and be consistently late on rent?? like bitch you had a job transfer, you were living rent free fvor 3 months. WHERE IS YOUR FUCKING MONEY? yes I do expect you to pay rent on time. No i dont give a fuck if your first paycheck of the month is on the 6th. MAYBE SAVE SOME MONEY FOR RENT? 

She is moving out in july, back to the place she visited to mooch off for 3 months bc she likes to npt have to pay rent it seems. And yet is treating me like I'm some horrible manipulator forcing her to pay so much money. Constantly complaining about how hot/cold the house is, and how it's not fair that I told her she's not allowed to touch the thermostat (bc she's not fucking paying utilities!!) I keep telling her, Do you think i enjoy when the house is 80 fucking degrees? no. But I cant afford to jack up the ac so get over it or pay for it. I don't have ac in my car either. Maybe if she paid fair rent I could afford to fix that, but no. I work a driving job, with a ac-less car, all summer long. and I get over it because I'm not entitled to comfort. I'm lucky I have a roof over my head. 

I just feel like she's so completely ungrateful and doesn't realize how lucky she is in this economy to even have stable housing. She's not content with just having a space to herself and dinner. She wants to live in luxury, with nice clothes, nice makeup, ability to travel and go to anime cons, the perfect 70 degree temp at all times, infinite access to high quality meats and restaurant food.  all without paying for that luxury, assuming I also want that luxury but I don't. I don't want luxury, I want to be alive, housed, and able to feed my pets and keep my cars maintained. 

sorry this is like word salad I got myself a bottle of whiskey on sale cuz this last month has been kind of shit and I just needed a vice cuz I have obtained from alchohol for 4 months and my brain is loud. (tax season be hell like that)

also the reason im so pissed again is cuz she hasnt cleaned up her cats puke for a week and I'm probably gonna clean it when her guest leaves cuz guest has been over for like, 4 days. not his fault really but it's akward. But god, my dog got sick and puked/shat on the floor while I was at work last week, and I got off my 11 hour shift and did not hesitate for a single moment to take her outside and deep clean the mess. bc pets are more important than my discomfort or exhaustion?? at least that's what I was taught.....idk if I'd be alive without my lovely dog and stupid ass pigeon. wont get my ass out of bed if I'm dying but if they need anything??? I will provide it asap. I kind of worry alot abt the one cat and I really want to keep her when they move cuz like theyre's SO CLEARLY a preference to the other cat it's hurting me to see her being ignored. I need a third pet like a hole in the head but....fuck it I'll work an extra 5 hr shift if I gotta.",2,1742860692.0,badroommates,2,1.0,False

Too bad, because I loved her in that variation. It suited her skill-set perfectly.

Are there smaller roles you miss in dancers who got promoted and thus graduated out of said roles? I have quite a few:

1. Sarah Lane/Joseph Gorak/Skylar Brandt in the Swan Lake pas de trois. Remember for many years how beautifully they danced this.
2. Herman Cornejo as Mercutio (!!!!). He was absolutely amazing in that role. I understand why he graduated to Romeo, but still miss his Mercutio.
3. Cassie Trenary as Princess Florine.
4. Alexa Maxwell and Emma von Enck as the Cygnets in Swan Lake. I remember they used to always be cast as cygnets bc they're two of the shortest corps members. I loved them in that, and miss that it won't happen anymore.
5. Indiana Woodward as Butterfly - again, perfect role for her. I also fondly remember Alexa Maxwell and Emma von Enck as Butterfly. Seems like it's a short-girl stepping stone at NYCB. Back in the day, Gelsey Kirkland and Suki Shorer got their breaks dancing Butterfly too.
6. Tess's TALL GIRL. Truly epic. It was the first time I saw her. I get why she graduated to Diamonds, but her Tall Girl was truly peerless. I'm going to feel the same way when Mira graduates permanently to Diamonds.

- Angela as a detective- it was fun to see her learn the ropes as a detective. There were some ‚Äúboot-esque‚Äù moments when she was told to get coffee or when she made a case more difficult than what her supervisor thought. 

- Tim as a sergeant- we saw some learning opportunities for him when Grey was training him in on being a sergeant. He had to learn to take a step back from and take a different approach to patrol than what he was used to.

- Nolan as a TO- this was big as we got to see him TO Celina for the first time. There were a lot of learning moments for him during his rookie-TO experience.

- Nyla as a TO- she had to basically learn patrol work again. Although she is too badass to ever give ‚Äúrookie‚Äù vibes.

A good employee suddenly starts slipping.

They look tired. They miss deadlines. Their attitude changes.

You might think,¬†*‚ÄúMaybe they‚Äôre lazy.‚Äù*

Or worse,¬†*‚ÄúMaybe they don‚Äôt care.‚Äù*

But here‚Äôs the truth:¬†**They might be burned out**¬†‚Äî and so might¬†*you*.

# Why Managers Miss Burnout (In Their Team¬†and¬†Themselves)

Burnout isn‚Äôt loud. People don‚Äôt shout,¬†*‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm burning out!‚Äù*

It‚Äôs quiet. It creeps up slowly until your best employees (or you) feel exhausted, disconnected, and stuck.

**Signs to Watch For**:

* üö©¬†**They stop caring**: The employee who once loved their work now seems bored or cynical.
* üö©¬†**They‚Äôre always tired**: Even Monday mornings feel draining.
* üö©¬†**They isolate**: Withdrawing from conversations, skipping virtual coffee breaks.
* üö©¬†**Work slips**: More mistakes, missed deadlines, or half-hearted effort.

But here‚Äôs the problem:¬†**If you‚Äôre burned out too, you‚Äôll miss these signs**

# What I Learned the Hard Way

Last year, I almost quit my remote leadership role. I was drowning in back-to-back Zooms, 60-hour weeks, and guilt over my team‚Äôs slipping morale.

Turns out,¬†**I was burned out**¬†‚Äî and my team was mirroring my stress.

So I spent 6 months researching burnout, talking to 100+ remote managers, and testing fixes. The result? A¬†**30-day action plan**¬†to help managers:

1. Diagnose burnout (in themselves¬†*and*¬†their team).
2. Set boundaries without guilt.
3. Reignite their team‚Äôs motivation (and their own).

I‚Äôm sharing¬†**Chapter 1 for free**¬†‚Äî no strings attached. It includes:

* A¬†**Burnout Quiz**¬†to diagnose if YOU‚ÄôRE at risk (most managers are).
* Case studies of leaders like Sarah, who saved her team (and herself) in 30 days.
* **Preorder discount**: Get the full guide for 25% off + early access to our private Facebook group for remote leaders.

I (26, F) and my ex boyfriend (31, M) broke up back in January of 2024. at the time of the break up, we lived together, and I even ended up living there for almost a full month after, until I moved back home. we didn‚Äôt break up because of anything terrible - no cheating, no big fallout - it was purely that we weren‚Äôt seeing eye to eye and just not on the same page with life and our next steps. neither of us wanted to break up, but we both knew at the time it was best for the both of us. 

for a few months after the breakup, we continued texting, and seeing each other in public, as we shared the same friend group. looking back, it was definitely not the smartest idea, as I still had feelings for him and that made things a lot more difficult. over the summer, I started seeing a guy, and he was doing his own thing, and we ultimately went no contact. we stayed no contact for months, not even seeing each other out in public, or if we did, completely ignoring one another. this went on until late November of 2024, when a mutual friend came home and I threw a birthday party for her. I didn‚Äôt reach out and invite him personally, but I told our mutual friends to let him know when/where it was happening and he was more than welcome to join. he ended up coming, we talked, and things ended mutually. we both apologized for things in the past and agreed that we wanted to be okay with seeing each other moving forward. we didn‚Äôt have to be best friends, but at least cordial with one another. 

fast forward to February of 2025 - we had seen each other a few times since November and talked here and there, and things were good. there was even a night that we saw each other in January and he was dealing with an anniversary of a death of someone who was really close to him, and got a little too drunk & I helped him home and stayed the night with him. nothing happened, but I‚Äôm glad I was able to be there with him. anyway, we both happened to be in Philly celebrating the eagles Super Bowl win, and he messaged me, asking where I ended up. I replied, and we met up and spent the entire evening and night together. he hung out with me, my older sister met us, and we all hung out, then he came to the bar with us and met my mom and step dad there and we all just had a great night. he came back to our place and we hooked up that night, and it was great. the next morning, I had to leave early and he asked if he could sleep a little longer, which was fine, and he asked me to text him when I got home. 

fast forward to today - we have texted every single day since Valentine‚Äôs Day. nothing has been outwardly flirty, but we‚Äôve still made the effort. we‚Äôve seen each other multiple times. he‚Äôs stayed at mine, I‚Äôve stayed at his. nothing physical has happened since then, but we‚Äôve just been talking nonstop. we went out for coffee, we‚Äôve discussed grabbing breakfast together. two of our friends came back home after being gone a few months and we decided to all grab dinner, where him and I showed up wearing matching outfits. not planned, but we were wearing almost the exact same thing. he was just on a bachelor‚Äôs trip this past weekend, where I expected not to hear from him at all, and I heard from him more than ever! he sent me a pic of him, he was keeping me updated on what was going on. I was really trying not to read too much into it, but then last night he flew into the airport near my house and kind of insinuated that he needed a ride home, so I went and picked him up. we grabbed fast food and filled each other in on each others weekends. when I dropped him back off at his place, he gave me a big hug and thanked me again for the ride. we texted a bit when I got back home, and we‚Äôve been texting again today. 

all of this to say - am I wrong to be reading too much into this situation? at first, I really thought it was just the two of us being friends and that was it. even after hooking up in February, I didn‚Äôt think too much of it. we were in the same city, shit happens. oh well. but now the texting, the hang outs, the pickup from the airport. all of my friends and our mutuals look at me like I‚Äôm crazy, wondering why he/I aren‚Äôt seeing what everyone else is seeing. multiple people have asked when we‚Äôre getting back together. I really do like and care about him - I‚Äôve always said he feels like my ‚Äúright person, wrong time‚Äù - but is it just nostalgia? or is there more there? to me, it doesn‚Äôt just feel like I‚Äôm longing for things in the past, or how things used to be. I feel like we have a connection and our story isn‚Äôt over. am I overthinking this entire situation or does it seem like there could still be something between us?

The vlog shows Travis watching Isaiah, who he says owns his own company, cut their lawn. They are sponsored by more frozen food products and everything in their home is prepackaged, precooked, boxed, bagged or freeze dried.¬† Katie tells us that these items are a much healthier alternative, but then later, we see a huge bag of Doritos on the couch with her and Travis. They show us their night out at Zach and Whitney‚Äôs where they eat steak, the kids eat Domino‚Äôs pizza and Bradley cousinmoms baby Harvey.¬† Ellie is there along with JebJud and Zach and Travis play their guitars together.¬† Later, Travis proves he really is a Bates by twisting his ankle while playing basketball at the church gymnasium.¬† Of course a camera was filming the entire thing and Warden carries Travis out to Evan‚Äôs car.¬† Travis says he thinks he broke a bone and Katie tells us how she wants to pamper him.¬† He uses a wheelchair for added effect at the doctor‚Äôs office and comes home in a boot, visibly disappointed that it is just a sprain.¬† He keeps saying how he hates that Katie has to do ‚Äúall of the work‚Äù and apologizes for being late with this vlog.¬† Katie appears to have a droopy lip all week and is talking out of the side of her mouth... not sure what is going on with that, or if it‚Äôs always been there, and I just never noticed.¬† To promote the vlog, Katie shows Travis‚Äô leg covered in a bandaid placed there by Hailey, and we see Travis in the wheelchair.¬† For their next vlog, they want people to submit anonymous assumptions via a special link.¬† That seems super scammy, and what they get are a whole bunch of questions asking when the podcast is going to happen.




3. Josie Balka is always running late, running behind, in a hurry, in a rush... but has time to film herself putting on makeup and playing in her hair while twirling in front of her mirror in a high dollar outfit.¬† She starts the week filming herself getting ready for church, and then day after day she sets up her camera at the azz crack of dawn and pretends to awake and rushes off to the hymn gym to workout alone.¬† We see her in the shower and she tells us she is going blonde again.¬† She links 13 items in one reel, and folks still ask for more items to be linked.¬† Kelton is definitely the chef in the family because Josie shows off the breakfast she makes herself and the girls and it looks like dog turds and diarrhea. Also, if she wants to make coffee content, she should clean her machine bc that thing is filthy... the breezy filter couldn‚Äôt even hide it.¬† Josie has to sell sheets this week and tells us that she is very ‚Äúintentional‚Äù about her sheets. Influencer speech strikes again.¬† Kelton makes steak sandwiches with the girls and Josie links her new automatic egg boiler.¬† She tells us how unique and odd it is that she eats... boiled eggs... and it is very evident that she was meant to be a blonde... which she has embraced once again.¬† They attend I Love You Day at the big house and the girls have hot roller hair and homemade costumes sewn by Michael.¬† It doesn‚Äôt appear that Josie dressed up as Bad Girl Sandy from Grease, and that feels like a real missed opportunity.




4. The Crown Prince of SnOrlando, Rhett Alan Webster turned 2 this week and up on Rocky Top, his grandmother lost her mind because she did not have even one picture of herself with Little Lord Whinesleroy.¬† In retaliation she drafted the most passive aggressive birthday post to date, stole a bunch of pictures from Alyssa‚Äôs Instagram and posted before his mother had a chance. Kelly Jo said a bunch of things like how heartbroken she is about not seeing him, and how she hopes one day he logs on to Instagram and learns how much she loved him, and how she hopes she gets a chance to hug him on her upcoming trip to Florida.¬† It was a.... lot.¬† Alyssa just ignored it all and shared her own grid post saying that Rhett was the guy she never knew they needed... well, that‚Äôs a lie bc we all know he is the only one she‚Äôs ever wanted. Meanwhile, Alyssa wasn‚Äôt done and had her own knockout punch to share when she dropped pictures and videos from Spring Break at Janie and Bill‚Äôs farm and captioned the entire thing with ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no place I‚Äôd rather be‚Äù.¬† Take that Bates Family I Love You Day. She drove herself and all 5 kids to the farm and left the mouth breather behind to manage in the humid pollen on his own.¬† It took her 11 hours and 49 coffee pictures to make it there where she decides not to post PaPa Bill at all, but shows Janie in her nightgown without her hair done.¬† The kids look as bored as usual, but at least they got to be bored in a different location.¬† Alyssa still has to work while on the farm and hides out in Janie‚Äôs room to sling links for phone cases.¬† ILY day has officially become FU day for the Mrs. Webster.




5. Zach Bates is a full fledged influencer now and he spends the week reposting Kelly Jo and Katie‚Äôs reposts about his posts.¬† It could just keep going for infinity, but he takes a break to make what loosely appears to be sushi, sell some pepper grinders and edit together a reel of his homemade lobster ravioli. Whitney can hardly compete with the content Zach is rolling out and she no longer spends her days selling random items.¬† She does share a reel of Brad brothermomming his little sister who is still in a full arm cast and does a try on for the boutique.¬† She shows off a $50 crocheted vest and $65 jeans while pointing out Scout the dog in the background.¬† Yes, we see him Whitney... we believe you. Later she exploits her youngest son by having him perform for the camera while she tells us that he is a miracle baby who made it out of the NICU.¬† They have steak for supper ‚Äì surprise, surprise-and head out for soccer practice.¬† Kacie joins dad in the kitchen to model an apron Aunt Michael sews and then Whitney shows off the Amazon costumes the kids will be wearing to the ILY day party.¬† The girls are in poodle skirts, Jaydon is a greaser and Bradley is dressed as the 70s bloated Elvis from his Hawaii concert era.¬† No one knows why.¬† This week‚Äôs vlog is a q and a with Callie and it‚Äôs sponsored by those cheap frozen meals. Nothing like a cooking show advertising food that doesn‚Äôt have to be cooked.¬† Anyway, it‚Äôs a pretty boring interview but we do learn that Callie is playing piano some at Gil‚Äôs church, she‚Äôs doing lots of babysitting and the reason why she loves to cook is because her mom was too busy visiting all of the married children to do it and girl was hungry.¬† She also gets lots of hand me downs from Katie and Carlin, the only sisters she mentions.¬† Zach tells us he loves all shooting sports, he thinks the younger siblings get away with everything, and the biggest holiday he remembers celebrating is his dad‚Äôs birthday or July 4th at the farm.¬† Can‚Äôt you just see Gil‚Äôs birthday being a national holiday back in the day?¬† They wrap up the week at the Friday night party that was maybe a shower per Carlin where Zach is grilling burgers with Gil.¬† Gil doesn‚Äôt want any tips from Zach... he can burn the burgers all on his own.





6. Trace and Lydia Bates have been plugging along on YouTube and have almost reached 100,000 views on a vlog.¬† That‚Äôs big news and to celebrate, Lydia takes pictures of the family at Gil‚Äôs church, and films Ryker playing pickleball.¬† Lydia is becoming slightly obsessive with the¬† gym selfies and shows off her 27 week bump, her 28 week bump...and her guns while there.¬† After the gym, she hits Ross and Chick-Fil-A with Ryker who is a ball of personality waving and talking with everyone.¬† Lydia goes wild mid week by wearing her pale purple outfit again, but to make up for it, we see her solid white cat on her solid white bed.¬† The vlog is sponsored by a vitamin gummy that we get to see Trace eat while talking.¬† They change the primary bedroom around so there is enough room to squish a baby in there bc Trace has already told us he ain‚Äôt about to move.¬† Warden shows up to help, but Lydia is able to do most of it herself.¬† Everything is white and beige and Trace says it‚Äôs ‚Äúso aesthetic‚Äù.... uh huh.¬† The big news is that Trace has lost 18 pounds since January by living at Planet Fitness and sometimes Evan comes along for playtime.¬† Trace says he wants to look good for the Summer season and hanging out at Evan‚Äôs pool.¬† Travis works out with them sometimes, but he can‚Äôt convince Warden to get on board.¬† We‚Äôve seen Warden... he‚Äôs good.¬† Trace is very excited about his diet and exercise plan and says he‚Äôs done several different diets.¬† He tried steak and eggs only (Bates family staple), then Keto and now he‚Äôs doing calorie deficiency. Lydia says she‚Äôs just trying to keep up, but my heart sort of goes out to her bc she‚Äôs expecting while her husband is trying to be a gym rat.¬† Anyway, it seems these people have a cult mind set and go all in on whatever it is they do... religion, working out... are they just gullible?¬† Lydia says her cravings all confirm she is having a girl and Trace looks at her like she‚Äôs nuts bc this far along she still doesn‚Äôt want to believe it. He says their next vlog will feature ILY day.




7. Michael Martyr Keilen spent her week sewing away for the I Love You Day festivities while Brandon was in heaven surrounded by paints, crayons and cardboard creating the props for the 1950's theme.¬† Kelly Jo heaps praise on Michael and Michael reposts the repost and when did this become a thing??¬† While she is at the sewing machine, she plugs one of Erin‚Äôs God stickers and her special 17% off sale on baby blankets.¬† Michael shows off the decorations and the dresses she has created for Josie‚Äôs girls to wear.¬† She and Brandon made a real life soda shop and have tons of balloon arches and decorations on every table.¬† Kelly Jo says she couldn‚Äôt do this party without them... there wouldn‚Äôt be a party without them is what she really meant to say. Michael and Brandon are dressed as a 50's waitress and a soda jerk... basically the help, and we see her at the party serving ice cream sundaes to a never ending line of grandkids.




8.¬† Erin Paine was a happy, giggly girlie this week, mainly because she had Addee and one of Addee‚Äôs friends spend the week with her in Florida.¬† She pops up on Instagram to share one of Chad‚Äôs must read devotionals about prayer.¬† The wordsmith Paine tells us that ‚ÄúPrayer good.¬† No prayer bad‚Äù... then he went back to building shelves.¬† Erin put her entire store on sale for 25% off so it‚Äôs a good time to stock up on a bunch of junk that will wind up at Goodwill. She shows her girls in the kitchen making protein balls.¬† The recipe cuts out the Stevia and has no sweetener whatsoever.¬† The kids can‚Äôt even have the limited joy of fake sweetener.¬† Erin also reposts some yard axe preacher hollering from the pulpit about how Jesus is near to the broken hearted.... how about the broken piggy bank, Erin... how‚Äôs that working out?¬† She says when we talk to Jesus we can get three answers... ‚Äúyes, no or wait‚Äù... and that it‚Äôs a great saying to remember.¬† Poor gal has been in wait purgatory for quite some time.¬† Anyway, just as we expected... she is back on YouTube with her Spring makeup and eyebrows jacked up to Jesus.¬† She‚Äôs come to give us a sneak peek of her new portable school room that is everything she‚Äôs ever wanted.¬† She tells us that vlog is coming, along with one where they film a new YouTube intro and she‚Äôs introducing 2 new tallow lotions.¬† One for acne and one for MEN. She just can‚Äôt let the man stuff go and embrace what folks want from her.¬† She also shows off new items for men that will be in their store, like the ever popular pleather change holder.¬† Erin tells us that they have been getting used to their new suburban home, but they won‚Äôt be there long and that everything Chad built will come along with them.¬† She says they are saving their money to buy a little farm.¬† In the meantime, the kids have been hard at work retrieving golf balls from the course behind the house and pricing them out.¬† She‚Äôll be selling used golf balls from a bucket at the end of the drive by June.¬† Carles makes an appearance in a reel reading to Finley.¬† Of course it‚Äôs a book of prayers that he is reciting by heart because there is not one second of the day that they are not being indoctrinated.¬† Erin doesn‚Äôt mention I Love You Day... they are too busy terrorizing that country club subdivision to head to Rocky Top anyway.




9. Lawson Bates got to hang out with Travis Clark at the SEC basketball championship and pretend he cares about this sport. Meanwhile, Tiffany was busy posting rage bait to rile up the breast fed vs. bottle fed community.¬† Her jokes are really awful lately, and there‚Äôs just one after another and each one is worst than the last.¬† Their new thing is that they post the exact same content on both pages.¬† That surely proves their love.¬† Her parents are still in town and she shows baby Will hanging with them watching the SpaceEx return so she can tag Elon Musk.¬† She also posts some mess about her debt and how Jesus paid it.¬† Lawson puts the baby on his shoulders and forces Tiffy‚Äôs dad to take his picture while he poses.¬† I can only imagine what ole dad is thinking.¬† Tiffy posts a q and a on IG but all of the answers are just links to their old youtube vlogs.¬† She says Lawson is working on a new one.¬† I don‚Äôt believe her.¬† Lawson doesn‚Äôt work.¬† Someone asks her about her education and she says she has her Master‚Äôs Degree but doesn‚Äôt recommend college ‚Äúheavily‚Äù.¬† I wonder why. Baby Will turns 8 months old and has a photo shoot on Lawson‚Äôs 26 year old Ford pickup truck.¬† Before ILY Day, Tiffy celebrates her ‚Äúgotcha day‚Äù.¬† It‚Äôs been 25 years since she was adopted.¬† She gets lots of engagement on her adoption post but doesn‚Äôt answer any of the questions folks ask about her birth parents.¬† Lawson is spotted with a popped collar like Danny Zuko at the Bates big party.¬† Who knows if Tiffany attended or if she went out on a limb and dressed up like Rizzo.¬† Can you imagine??





Have a great week friends!¬† I heard that because Easter is in April this year the Easter bunny is going to be really tired... it‚Äôs because he just finished a long March...

I have tomorrow afternoon free and luckily the weather is nice. I live in Sunnyvale and want to go somewhere outdoors between 9-5. I would like to hike a bit, then maybe find a place to eat, then go to a coffee shop and read my books.

I want to be close to the ocean tomorrow. Haven't explored bay area much, so the only place that comes to mind is Santa Cruz. Any other ideas? Are there nice sea facing coffee shops around?

1jj5ewx,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1jj5ewx/help_with_brew_time/,Help with brew time,"My setup:
* Stagg EKG Kettle
* Ode Gen 1 (now with Gen 2 burrs)
* V60 or Kalita Wave

Coffees: typically a washed city/full city

Recipe: 25-30g coffee, 400-500 ml water, 1:16 or 1:17

Would really appreciate some advice. At some point in the last 6 months, my brews went haywire. Brew times are way too long, burping in the bed while brewing, over extraction, low clarity in the cup. I suspected that the Gen 1 burrs just kinda wore out after 5 years and started throwing too many fines. So, I bought Gen 2 burrs, and while the consistency is much better, I‚Äôm still having the same problems. I‚Äôm grinding nearly wide open (10-11) and still have brew times pushing 3:30-4:00 with ~30g coffee.

The only variable I haven‚Äôt really tried changing is water. We‚Äôre on town/city water, which is generally quite good and which has never presented brew problems before. But perhaps something has changed in the treatment. 

What water are y‚Äôall using if not tap water?

I have many digestive issues supported by civilian medical records Gerd, IBS, hiatal hernia, constipation, esophagus problems, diverticulitis, benign colon polyps, and tinnitus . 

Other issues - depression and insomnia It sucks worrying about pooping or not pooping every freaking day.

back and neck problems, left hip and left knee issues supported by chiropractic records

Here‚Äôs where I need guidance: I was in an off base wreck in a compact car.Other vehicle full size sedan. Other Driver ran stop sign, hit my passenger rear door my vehicle went end over end landed with roof on pavement. If I wouldn‚Äôt have been wearing my seatbelt I probably would have been critically injured. I landed upside down with my head against roof of car  and neck contorted. After the car and my head stopped spinning I unbuckled my seatbelt and crawled out. Sheesh I was only 20, now I‚Äôm in my 50s. I had scrapes bumps and bruises all over my body, which is in military medical records. I couldn‚Äôt sleep well because I was in pain especially back and neck. Moaned from pain during the day and while trying to sleep for about a month. My neck has never felt the same. I went to see doctor on base. 3 times the 3rd time he literally yelled and got in my face DI style yelling I don‚Äôt know what your trying to pull, I‚Äôm going to give you 3 weeks light duty and I better not see you back here. Sheesh he was 40 something. I was 20 just becoming a man. I have always been respectful. I simply said I‚Äôm hurting and walked away. I felt like crying, I just left. My MOS was subsistence supply I worked at a mess hall. My main task was unloading dry goods. Every Wednesday we got a semi truck trailer full of dry goods food. Myself and 1 mess man would set the goods on the dock. Then put in the store room. Flour had 5 bags at 10 pounds all wrapped together for 50 pounds. We would get about 5 of those. Sugar same. Big number 10 cans of coffee and fruit. On two days a week we would get dairy. 20 crates of Milk, 20 crates of juices. Produce on one day. Each box weighed about 50 pounds. Probably 20 box each delivery. Then frozen goods, man get about 40 boxes each over 50 pounds each week. All manual labor, no forklift no manual forklift. Just my body. I always had some back pain, but after the wreck it went to another level I was never pain free in neck or back. 

I was at Camp Lejuene during benzene. The military can be sued now but one needs to have cancer or family member needs to have passed away. My digestive problems could be tied to benzene. I was at Lejuene for 3 months. 

In dealing with these health issues for 3 decades. I have a theory that in the wreck I may have injured my Vagus nerve, it‚Äôs a nerve that runs from the base of your skull down your spine. It regulates many body functions including digestive system. I have not been diagnosed by a doctor for vagus nerve damage. 

My questions are #1. should I tie disability to benzene just for digestive issues. #2 tie disability to MOS and work seems like that‚Äôs only back and neck maybe hip and knee or #3 tie disability to wreck damaged vagus nerve that lead to digestive issues and is aggravated due to MOS work of constantly moving 50+ pound boxes. Some how I would have to prove vagus nerve is damaged. Just a side note before the wreck I could eat melons, watermelon, cantaloupes, avocado, etc..after I‚Äôm allergic roof of mouth starts itching throat begins to swell. 

What do yall think? Which way should I go. Thanks for helping.

I forgot to mention. I went to VA clinic for my digestive issues. They did nothing. Man the look on PA face was like he didn‚Äôt believe nothing I said. I stopped going. I was diagnosed by civilian doctors through colonoscopy and endoscopy. I have been suffering for years. I was diagnosed about 7 years with the digestive problems.

Kelly Jo said a bunch of things like how heartbroken she is about not seeing him, and how she hopes one day he logs on to Instagram and learns how much she loved him, and how she hopes she gets a chance to hug him on her upcoming trip to Florida.¬† It was a.... lot.¬† Alyssa just ignored it all and shared her own grid post saying that Rhett was the guy she never knew they needed... well, that‚Äôs a lie bc we all know he is the only one she‚Äôs ever wanted. Meanwhile, Alyssa wasn‚Äôt done and had her own knockout punch to share when she dropped pictures and videos from Spring Break at Janie and Bill‚Äôs farm and captioned the entire thing with ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no place I‚Äôd rather be‚Äù.¬† Take that Bates Family I Love You Day. She drove herself and all 5 kids to the farm and left the mouth breather behind to manage in the humid pollen on his own.¬† It took her 11 hours and 49 coffee pictures to make it there where she decides not to post PaPa Bill at all, but shows Janie in her nightgown without her hair done.¬† The kids look as bored as usual, but at least they got to be bored in a different location.¬† Alyssa still has to work while on the farm and hides out in Janie‚Äôs room to sling links for phone cases.¬† ILY day has officially become FU day for the Mrs. Webster.




5. Zach Bates is a full fledged influencer now and he spends the week reposting Kelly Jo and Katie‚Äôs reposts about his posts.¬† It could just keep going for infinity, but he takes a break to make what loosely appears to be sushi, sell some pepper grinders and edit together a reel of his homemade lobster ravioli. Whitney can hardly compete with the content Zach is rolling out and she no longer spends her days selling random items.¬† She does share a reel of Brad brothermomming his little sister who is still in a full arm cast and does a try on for the boutique.¬† She shows off a $50 crocheted vest and $65 jeans while pointing out Scout the dog in the background.¬† Yes, we see him Whitney... we believe you. Later she exploits her youngest son by having him perform for the camera while she tells us that he is a miracle baby who made it out of the NICU.¬† They have steak for supper ‚Äì surprise, surprise-and head out for soccer practice.¬† Kacie joins dad in the kitchen to model an apron Aunt Michael sews and then Whitney shows off the Amazon costumes the kids will be wearing to the ILY day party.¬† The girls are in poodle skirts, Jaydon is a greaser and Bradley is dressed as the 70s bloated Elvis from his Hawaii concert era.¬† No one knows why.¬† This week‚Äôs vlog is a q and a with Callie and it‚Äôs sponsored by those cheap frozen meals. Nothing like a cooking show advertising food that doesn‚Äôt have to be cooked.¬† Anyway, it‚Äôs a pretty boring interview but we do learn that Callie is playing piano some at Gil‚Äôs church, she‚Äôs doing lots of babysitting and the reason why she loves to cook is because her mom was too busy visiting all of the married children to do it and girl was hungry.¬† She also gets lots of hand me downs from Katie and Carlin, the only sisters she mentions.¬† Zach tells us he loves all shooting sports, he thinks the younger siblings get away with everything, and the biggest holiday he remembers celebrating is his dad‚Äôs birthday or July 4th at the farm.¬† Can‚Äôt you just see Gil‚Äôs birthday being a national holiday back in the day?¬† They wrap up the week at the Friday night party that was maybe a shower per Carlin where Zach is grilling burgers with Gil.¬† Gil doesn‚Äôt want any tips from Zach... he can burn the burgers all on his own.





6. Trace and Lydia Bates have been plugging along on YouTube and have almost reached 100,000 views on a vlog.¬† That‚Äôs big news and to celebrate, Lydia takes pictures of the family at Gil‚Äôs church, and films Ryker playing pickleball.¬† Lydia is becoming slightly obsessive with the¬† gym selfies and shows off her 27 week bump, her 28 week bump...and her guns while there.¬† After the gym, she hits Ross and Chick-Fil-A with Ryker who is a ball of personality waving and talking with everyone.¬† Lydia goes wild mid week by wearing her pale purple outfit again, but to make up for it, we see her solid white cat on her solid white bed.¬† The vlog is sponsored by a vitamin gummy that we get to see Trace eat while talking.¬† They change the primary bedroom around so there is enough room to squish a baby in there bc Trace has already told us he ain‚Äôt about to move.¬† Warden shows up to help, but Lydia is able to do most of it herself.¬† Everything is white and beige and Trace says it‚Äôs ‚Äúso aesthetic‚Äù.... uh huh.¬† The big news is that Trace has lost 18 pounds since January by living at Planet Fitness and sometimes Evan comes along for playtime.¬† Trace says he wants to look good for the Summer season and hanging out at Evan‚Äôs pool.¬† Travis works out with them sometimes, but he can‚Äôt convince Warden to get on board.¬† We‚Äôve seen Warden... he‚Äôs good.¬† Trace is very excited about his diet and exercise plan and says he‚Äôs done several different diets.¬† He tried steak and eggs only (Bates family staple), then Keto and now he‚Äôs doing calorie deficiency. Lydia says she‚Äôs just trying to keep up, but my heart sort of goes out to her bc she‚Äôs expecting while her husband is trying to be a gym rat.¬† Anyway, it seems these people have a cult mind set and go all in on whatever it is they do... religion, working out... are they just gullible?¬† Lydia says her cravings all confirm she is having a girl and Trace looks at her like she‚Äôs nuts bc this far along she still doesn‚Äôt want to believe it. He says their next vlog will feature ILY day.




7. Michael Martyr Keilen spent her week sewing away for the I Love You Day festivities while Brandon was in heaven surrounded by paints, crayons and cardboard creating the props for the 1950's theme.¬† Kelly Jo heaps praise on Michael and Michael reposts the repost and when did this become a thing??¬† While she is at the sewing machine, she plugs one of Erin‚Äôs God stickers and her special 17% off sale on baby blankets.¬† Michael shows off the decorations and the dresses she has created for Josie‚Äôs girls to wear.¬† She and Brandon made a real life soda shop and have tons of balloon arches and decorations on every table.¬† Kelly Jo says she couldn‚Äôt do this party without them... there wouldn‚Äôt be a party without them is what she really meant to say. Michael and Brandon are dressed as a 50's waitress and a soda jerk... basically the help, and we see her at the party serving ice cream sundaes to a never ending line of grandkids.




8.¬† Erin Paine was a happy, giggly girlie this week, mainly because she had Addee and one of Addee‚Äôs friends spend the week with her in Florida.¬† She pops up on Instagram to share one of Chad‚Äôs must read devotionals about prayer.¬† The wordsmith Paine tells us that ‚ÄúPrayer good.¬† No prayer bad‚Äù... then he went back to building shelves.¬† Erin put her entire store on sale for 25% off so it‚Äôs a good time to stock up on a bunch of junk that will wind up at Goodwill. She shows her girls in the kitchen making protein balls.¬† The recipe cuts out the Stevia and has no sweetener whatsoever.¬† The kids can‚Äôt even have the limited joy of fake sweetener.¬† Erin also reposts some yard axe preacher hollering from the pulpit about how Jesus is near to the broken hearted.... how about the broken piggy bank, Erin... how‚Äôs that working out?¬† She says when we talk to Jesus we can get three answers... ‚Äúyes, no or wait‚Äù... and that it‚Äôs a great saying to remember.¬† Poor gal has been in wait purgatory for quite some time.¬† Anyway, just as we expected... she is back on YouTube with her Spring makeup and eyebrows jacked up to Jesus.¬† She‚Äôs come to give us a sneak peek of her new portable school room that is everything she‚Äôs ever wanted.¬† She tells us that vlog is coming, along with one where they film a new YouTube intro and she‚Äôs introducing 2 new tallow lotions.¬† One for acne and one for MEN. She just can‚Äôt let the man stuff go and embrace what folks want from her.¬† She also shows off new items for men that will be in their store, like the ever popular pleather change holder.¬† Erin tells us that they have been getting used to their new suburban home, but they won‚Äôt be there long and that everything Chad built will come along with them.¬† She says they are saving their money to buy a little farm.¬† In the meantime, the kids have been hard at work retrieving golf balls from the course behind the house and pricing them out.¬† She‚Äôll be selling used golf balls from a bucket at the end of the drive by June.¬† Carles makes an appearance in a reel reading to Finley.¬† Of course it‚Äôs a book of prayers that he is reciting by heart because there is not one second of the day that they are not being indoctrinated.¬† Erin doesn‚Äôt mention I Love You Day... they are too busy terrorizing that country club subdivision to head to Rocky Top anyway.




9. Lawson Bates got to hang out with Travis Clark at the SEC basketball championship and pretend he cares about this sport. Meanwhile, Tiffany was busy posting rage bait to rile up the breast fed vs. bottle fed community.¬† Her jokes are really awful lately, and there‚Äôs just one after another and each one is worst than the last.¬† Their new thing is that they post the exact same content on both pages.¬† That surely proves their love.¬† Her parents are still in town and she shows baby Will hanging with them watching the SpaceEx return so she can tag Elon Musk.¬† She also posts some mess about her debt and how Jesus paid it.¬† Lawson puts the baby on his shoulders and forces Tiffy‚Äôs dad to take his picture while he poses.¬† I can only imagine what ole dad is thinking.¬† Tiffy posts a q and a on IG but all of the answers are just links to their old youtube vlogs.¬† She says Lawson is working on a new one.¬† I don‚Äôt believe her.¬† Lawson doesn‚Äôt work.¬† Someone asks her about her education and she says she has her Master‚Äôs Degree but doesn‚Äôt recommend college ‚Äúheavily‚Äù.¬† I wonder why. Baby Will turns 8 months old and has a photo shoot on Lawson‚Äôs 26 year old Ford pickup truck.¬† Before ILY Day, Tiffy celebrates her ‚Äúgotcha day‚Äù.¬† It‚Äôs been 25 years since she was adopted.¬† She gets lots of engagement on her adoption post but doesn‚Äôt answer any of the questions folks ask about her birth parents.¬† Lawson is spotted with a popped collar like Danny Zuko at the Bates big party.¬† Who knows if Tiffany attended or if she went out on a limb and dressed up like Rizzo.¬† Can you imagine??





Have a great week friends!¬† I heard that because Easter is in April this year the Easter bunny is going to be really tired... it‚Äôs because he just finished a long March...

1jj56q9,https://i.redd.it/v4qefjqszpqe1.jpeg,Reasons why our city and country are overwhelmed by neglect and litter,"*Note: Regarding the deletion of the previous post I learnt, from two different Mods, the following:*

*- ""This post was removed because the license plate of the offending vehicle is visible, which is against the rules."", and*

*- ""It was automatically removed due to multiple user reports.""*

*I guess, one of those two reasons is true (or maybe both). While I can't help those who disagree with me, I'll fix my mistake and re-upload this post with the plate number hidden; sorry for this mistake.*



Following a recent post about littering, I recalled an experience with those who should have been responsible for ensuring order but failed to do so.

While it is very atypical of British standards to acknowledge the elephant in the room, we must make an effort to say it loud and clear: the UK is not a clean and well maintained country, and Cambridge is no exception. The question is, why? There are always excuses, often weak and unconvincing, primarily revolving around the Council supposedly lacking funds due to various reasons. But is that really the case?

Cambridge is an expensive city, so one would expect at least the city centre to be well maintained. However, it is not. The reasons are multiple, but they can be grouped into three main categories:

**>> Lack of responsibility among state employees and corruption**: this is a well documented issue where public money, paid by citizens and businesses, is used for purposes other than those that would positively impact those who contributed. Why is there litter? Why are footpaths uneven? Why are dried wild plants not being cut? Why are damaged public railings left unrepaired? Some time ago, I saw a dead hedgehog on Castle street. It remained there for days until it became nothing more than a stamp on the pavement.

**>> Laziness of people**: Walk around the city and see for yourself. Now is the time to clean gardens, but for some, that responsibility is ignored. They expect others to clean their property. It is every homeowner's obligation to ensure that vegetation from their property does not interfere with footpaths or cycling lanes. Despite having access to roads with significant foot traffic, many properties look abysmal due to a complete lack of maintenance. The solution? The Council should fine these property owners repeatedly until they learn that they do not live in a jungle.

**>> Lack of education among some individuals**: Simply put, some people are incompatible with living in society. Day after day, garbage is thrown everywhere: food packaging, coffee cups, tyres, general rubbish, and even hazardous waste like asbestos. The Solution: Hefty fines and community service (or long prison sentences if necessary). However, this would only work if those in charge did their jobs properly. The current state of affairs suggests they do not.

One day, while heading to Milton Recycling Centre, I encountered an individual displaying this very lack of responsibility. He casually threw his coffee cup out of his car window without a second thought. Naturally, I attempted to report this via the online form at ""South Cambridgeshire District Council‚Äôs Envirocrime"" page. To my disappointment, the system did not allow me to upload video evidence. I tried compressing it, converting it into a GIF ...nothing worked.

Frustrated, I contacted them via email to ask why I was unable to upload video evidence. My message read:

*""I started a new form, but neither an MP4 file (6.82MB) nor its GIF conversion (9.05MB) were accepted. The webserver attempts to upload them, the loading bar disappears, and... nothing. On the other hand, a JPEG of 178kB uploaded properly. I have uploaded these files to Dropbox for you to review.""*

Their response:

*""I have raised this issue and have been informed that videos and GIFs cannot be uploaded to our forms. This may be something we consider adding in the future, but for now, only images and documents can be attached.""*

After all my effort, it was too much for me, and I replied with:

*""This is laughable. It seems this so-called Envirocrime report is just another way of wasting public money. I have video footage clearly showing garbage being thrown from a moving vehicle, yet I cannot use it as evidence. Even more ridiculous is that you don't accept GIFs, a format that has been around for over 30 years. The form states: 'Please provide as much photographic evidence as possible, as this helps with our investigation.' So next time, I should ask the offender to pose next to the garbage for a picture. Do you accept files uploaded to Google Drive, Dropbox, Box, Mega, OneDrive, etc.?""*

Unsurprisingly, I received no further response.

What can you do? What can you say? It's laughable.

No. While it was wrong of Joan to cheat I don‚Äôt think the rest was all her fault. The show depicts her saying ‚Äúnot their problem‚Äù to the woman she fired and throwing her vape at her. In real life she may have been rude but not to that degree by any means. And truly while she could‚Äôve done it much better it really doesn‚Äôt seem like it was her decision to fire that women it was the boards. As she told her therapist she was the middle man. That‚Äôs another thing the point of therapy is to be discreet and share your feelings in a setting where it won‚Äôt hurt anyone. Whether or not you think she was right to feel the way she did about Mac still she wasn‚Äôt wrong for expressing her feelings in the one space she‚Äôs supposed to be able to safely. That said I don‚Äôt think the people around her are at fault for feeling upset by her actions either. In my eyes the two major things she did wrong was meeting up with Mac (including what that lead to) and the way she handled firing that woman. I don‚Äôt think her intentions were nearly as bad as the show depicted. Like the exaggeration of her saying ‚Äúif I‚Äôm being honest‚Äù and then ‚Äúthank you‚Äù in regards to her coffee being distorted into ‚Äúdog shit‚Äù and ‚ÄúI hope they do‚Äù. You can say it‚Äôs the same point at the end of the day but ultimately it‚Äôs not.

1jj4wim,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jj4wim/friend_said_they_wanted_to_go_no_contact_need/,Friend said they wanted to go no contact? Need advice.,"Hi everyone. This story has to do with me (24F) and my friend S (24F). 

S and I have been friends for about a year and a half now. While that isn‚Äôt very long for some people, she quickly became a great friend to me and was one of my biggest supporters. Without going into extreme detail, S has been through a lot in her life. She is a suicide risk and has seizures regularly. There have been times that she doesn‚Äôt contact me for a few weeks and I message her to check in on her. Usually she‚Äôs fine, or just dealing with family stuff, so I give her the space she needs until she‚Äôs ready to talk/hang out. 

Recently, S went on a trip to Canada. I knew about the trip, when she was leaving, and when she‚Äôd be back. I asked if she wanted to get dinner when she got home so we could chat and she said of course. The day she flies home, I messaged her asking how her trip was and if she wanted to schedule a day for us to get dinner together. She didn‚Äôt respond for about three days and when she finally did, she said she had been through a lot while out of the country and wanted time to herself. No worries. I told her to message me when she‚Äôs ready. 3 months go by. Like I said, she usually messages me about every three weeks in these situations. I messaged her about once a month checking in and she‚Äôd message me back a day or so later, saying she‚Äôs fine and just needs to work on stuff. Okay, no worries. 

Fast forward to after the three months, she asks to go and get coffee together. We meet up for coffee and lunch. She tells me how she‚Äôs in a new relationship, has been working on herself and her music and is generally doing really well. I was so excited for her! I was so excited to finally hang out again cause I‚Äôve missed her. But the conversation got‚Ä¶weird. 

She started telling me how she‚Äôs always felt obligated to message me back and that it was a bit annoying while she‚Äôs trying to recover from whatever she went through (she never told me exactly what it was, which is fine, but hinted that she‚Äôd been sick). Like‚Ä¶alright I‚Äôve been worried about you because I have no idea what‚Äôs going on. She keeps alluding to the fact that maybe she doesn‚Äôt want to be friends? She kept jumping around to different subjects about how she‚Äôs moving soon and this and that. I asked her in layman‚Äôs terms to explain what she wants out of the friendship. She said that she wants to take a break from our friendship for a while, that she would message me to hang out in about 4-5 months. S doesnt want ANY contact she explained. But our other mutual friends she was going to continue to keep in touch with. She also mentioned that she would need my help moving, which is happening after she wants to go no contact for so long?

After we were done with our little meetup, she walked me to my car. She doesn‚Äôt drive and usually walks everywhere and it was like a 12 block walk back to her apartment. I asked her if she wanted a ride home since it was cloudy and cold and she didn‚Äôt bring a jacket. She said she appreciates it but she wanted to walk (which she typically says). We hugged and said goodbye. I hopped in my car, rolled down my window and waved, and told her to message me when you get home, which I‚Äôve said to her EVERY time she walks home, just to be safe. And she waved back to me and said ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be doing that!‚Äù put her headphones on, and walked away. 

Kind of a punch in the gut. I‚Äôve been so excited to hang out with her and hear her voice and be around her that it really hurt my feelings that she doesn‚Äôt want to talk for even longer? I understand that she doesn‚Äôt owe me her time by any means, but it still hurts.

1jj4t24,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1jj4t24/broken_silence/,Broken silence,"It was a crisp Halloween night, and Margot had the house all to herself. A stack of textbooks sat untouched on the kitchen table, the lamp‚Äôs soft glow casting long shadows on the walls. Margot, eighteen and a first-year college student, had never been one for parties. The allure of studying for her exams outweighed any trick-or-treating or costume festivities her classmates might enjoy. Tonight, her focus was on an easy babysitting gig for a couple who had gone out for the evening. 

Sean, the one-and-a-half-year-old she was looking after, had been an angel all night. His giggles filled the air, his big blue eyes sparkling like stars. Margot had already tucked him into bed, his tiny form nestled under a blanket adorned with cartoon animals. 

She settled onto the couch, the warm glow from the TV barely lighting the room. Margot didn‚Äôt mind the silence. In fact, she liked it. The quiet was her companion, especially since she didn‚Äôt quite have friends to fill the space. Her phone vibrated on the coffee table, but she ignored it. Instead, she focused on the soft sound of the baby monitor beside her. It was comforting, knowing that if Sean stirred or needed anything, she'd hear it immediately.

The clock ticked on.

A few minutes later, something caught her attention. It was faint at first‚Äîa whisper. 

She furrowed her brow, leaning closer to the monitor. There it was again. 

A voice.

""Margot... Come here... It‚Äôs time.""

Margot‚Äôs heart skipped. The baby, Sean, had been sound asleep. There was no reason for anyone to be talking through the monitor. She glanced toward the hallway, but everything looked normal. She hesitated. Maybe it was just static? Or perhaps, the wind messing with the signal?

She shook it off, but the voice came again, clearer this time.

""Hey lady‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre too late.""

Her stomach churned. She stood up slowly, her instincts telling her to check on Sean. What was going on?

The house felt unnervingly still. She walked to the nursery door and paused, listening. No sound came from the monitor now, just a faint crackling. She took a breath and pushed the door open.

The room was bathed in dim light, and there, in the crib, was Sean. He was still asleep, a small smile curling on his face as he dreamed. 

Relieved, Margot exhaled, but as she turned to leave, the voice crackled through the monitor again, but this time it was loud, angry.

‚ÄúLeave him alone! He‚Äôs mine.‚Äù

Margot froze.

That was not Sean.

Her heart began to pound as she slowly backed away from the crib. She glanced nervously at the monitor, but the voice kept coming. It was distorted, eerie, and mocking. A sudden shiver ran down her spine. 

""Go! Go now!"" The voice hissed.

Margot‚Äôs legs trembled, and she felt a chill spread through her body. She turned to leave, but the footsteps came next. Loud and fast, pacing just behind her. Her breath quickened, but when she reached the door, something made her glance over her shoulder.

There was nothing there.

But the whispers‚Äîthe low, sinister whispers‚Äîkept growing louder.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt leave yet‚Ä¶‚Äù

Her heart pounded in her chest. She sprinted out of the room, the baby monitor‚Äôs static now blaring in her ears, the whispers turning into full, distorted words.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt leave! You‚Äôre mine!‚Äù

She raced down the dark hallway toward the stairs, her mind reeling in panic. Something was wrong‚Äîsomething was terribly wrong.

She heard the voice one last time as she reached the top of the stairs, and it screamed in her ear.

""**GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!**""

Margot gasped and stumbled, her foot catching on the top step. Time seemed to slow as she toppled forward, her body twisting in mid-air. The stairs loomed like jagged teeth as she fell, the ground rushing up to meet her. 

There was a sickening crack, and everything went dark.



Hours later, the flashing red and blue lights of a police car illuminated the quiet street. Officers were gathered at the foot of the stairs, one of them talking quietly into his radio. 

A man in a coat stood nearby, his eyes red and swollen from crying.

""How did she‚Äî"" he started to ask, but the officer raised a hand to stop him.

""We found her body at the foot of the stairs. Looks like she tripped while trying to leave the room.""

The officer paused, glancing down at the baby monitor still lying on the floor near the stairs, the static barely audible.

‚ÄúStrangest thing,‚Äù the officer continued, looking over at the monitor. ‚ÄúTurns out, it was picking up a radio signal... from some old horror radio show. It‚Äôs been glitching all night, playing voices and static. Maybe that‚Äôs what spooked her.‚Äù

The man nodded slowly, wiping his eyes. ‚ÄúShe‚Ä¶ she didn‚Äôt even have a chance.‚Äù

The officer gave a soft sigh, then shook his head. ‚ÄúSometimes, the signal just gets crossed, you know? It happens more than you'd think. It‚Äôs strange, but no one was in that room. Not anyone real.‚Äù

He paused again and looked up, glancing at the baby still peacefully sleeping in his crib.

The officer took one last look at the baby monitor. The voice, the whispers‚Ä¶ It all made sense now.

1jj4qav,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jj4qav,Work flow suggestions?,"Recently opened, had some hiccups, and everyone here was so informative and helpful. I would love any input on how to better organize our workflow.

In short, unfortunately I failed to adequately prep the design. I work full time as a homicide detective, and we own a pizza shop, but in 2023 I was diagnosed with cancer. While going through chemotherapy, planning for the worst but hoping for the best, I decided to take a leap into making my wife's life long dream of owning a coffee shop a reality. She has been a stay at home mom to our two girls (11 and 5) but has a passion for coffee. During that time, the chemo took more out of me than we had originally anticipated, all while still working and running the other business, it got to be a lot. I relied on our contractor, who I thought was knowledgeable, to throw the layout together. At the end of the day, it's not the worst, but definitely not the best for what was an empty shell build out.

Any small tweaks or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! We are just now starting to gain some traction, and having efficiency issues. Food is made in the back, and this unit is connected to our pizza shop, so they help prepare the food orders.

1jj4on5,https://www.reddit.com/r/catfree/comments/1jj4on5/i_think_my_boyfriend_is_more_in_love_with_the_cat/,I think my boyfriend is more in love with the cat than he is with me at this point.,"My boyfriend and I had been living together for a little over a year when his brother (our now practically ex-roommate) begged my boyfriend to allow him to bring this kitten home that he saw behind a gas station. My boyfriend agreed, but told his brother that the kitten couldn‚Äôt live inside due to him having pet allergies. Sounds good, right? His brother gets to rescue this dumpster cat, my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt have to suffer with allergies and I don‚Äôt ever have to live with any pets. Which I want to note was SUCH a good/peaceful thing for me, because I grew up in a home with way too many animals and was absolutely miserable.

Everything was fine until the ‚Äúcold weather‚Äù came. By that I mean deep south of the USA cold lol and if you don‚Äôt know, rarely will you see the temperature drop below 20¬∞F. Though my boyfriend is allergic to pets, he has a huge soft spot for animals. In October 2024, we discussed bringing the cat inside for a few days when it got down to *almost* freezing. I told him that it was his call and he decided to go for it. As you all know, it‚Äôs now mid March 2025 and guess who never went back out after those few days? 

I‚Äôve become more and more unhappy with my living situation over the past 6 months. I never thought i‚Äôd dread coming home after a long day, but here I am. 

As I previously mentioned, I grew up with a lot of animals. Several cats included, but this cat is unlike anything i‚Äôve ever experienced. It‚Äôs this awful, feral monster. It‚Äôs constantly attacking, clawing and biting my boyfriend. Me too at first, but for the most part it has since learned to stay the fuck away from me lol. That aside, it‚Äôs also extremely annoying and so gross to live with. It runs around, meows at the top of its lungs nonstop and destroys everything we own. It climbs on all of the curtains, scratches up every surface available to it and of course knocks everything off of every shelf/table we have. It‚Äôs so disgusting that my boyfriend has to sweep up cat litter it tracks all around the house every single day and I **hate** how every surface of our home is covered in cat hair. 

Now for the title of the post. In his eyes, this cat can do no wrong. It‚Äôs perfect in every single way to him. We argue constantly over the cat and i‚Äôm somehow ALWAYS in the wrong. I‚Äôm at the point where I will shamelessly admit that i‚Äôm very much jealous of a cat. It‚Äôs like this cat has taken my spot as the girlfriend. 

Cuddles? He chooses the cat now. 

Sweet little words of endearment? Only to the cat now. 

Warm, excited hellos when he gets home? Yeah, but only to the cat now. 

I want or need something? He‚Äôs too tired, but he‚Äôll still make sure the cat is happy. 

Extra spending money? I used to get surprised with little gifts or some kind of candy/treat. Now, it‚Äôs only ever toys for the cat. 

Most outrageous to me: being gentle and caring when needed. He rarely gives that to me now, but it‚Äôs endless for the cat. 

Last thing i‚Äôd like to add. I really fucking miss our lazy days in bed together. We used to be able to sleep in on off days and watch movies in bed. Now because our bedroom is a ‚Äúcat free room‚Äù, I never get those days anymore. As soon as the cat starts meowing, he‚Äôs up making his coffee and joining it on the couch. 

I never actually said ‚Äúme or the cat‚Äù but his choice is clear and he‚Äôs proven this many times in quite a few different ways. I‚Äôm so done, but I feel like i‚Äôm stuck this way unless i‚Äôd be okay with leaving him.

That being said, this time around I am even more committed to my faith and feel hopeless as ever to meet a guy who is a believer on the apps.  What should my low bar be to even meet someone?  I always mention my faith and my involvement with my church in my bio and if there is enough room I mention that I am looking for someone to share the same faith values.  Is it a good rule of thumb to swipe by people who do not mention their faith in their bio? I am sure my non-Christian friends would say not to do that but that would be a massive waste of my time potentially.  Also if it doesn't come up in a conversation with someone within a couple of days and they ask me out, do I agree to go out not knowing if they would consider themselves a believer even?  I am not trying to be rude like it's some club that they can't have access to but I do NOT want to waste someone's time, and I get tired when I think of going out on all these coffee dates only to find out someone just clicked ""Christian"" on their Bio.",3,1742856903.0,ChristianDating,1,1.0,False
