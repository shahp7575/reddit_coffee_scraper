1p8pjsv,https://www.reddit.com/r/airport/comments/1p8pjsv/the_airport_security_conversation_i_was_not/,The Airport Security Conversation I Was NOT Expecting at 6 A.M.,"So I was at the airport way too early last week, like that zombie hour where everyone is awake but spiritually absent. I’m standing in the security line, half-asleep, clutching a coffee that tasted like burnt hopes, when the guy in front of me suddenly turns around and asks:
“Hey, do you know anything about fabric shrinkage?”
Mind you, I’d spoken zero words that morning. My brain hadn’t even loaded its basic settings yet. I blinked at him, trying to understand if he was talking to me or hallucinating. But he was dead serious.
Turns out he had packed this really nice Saudi jubba he bought for a family event and was terrified it would shrink in the hotel laundry. He held it up like it was a fragile artifact and asked me for advice, as if I were some kind of textile scientist instead of a tired traveler wearing mismatched socks.
I tried telling him I’m absolutely not qualified, but he kept going, explaining how he’d washed a similar garment last year and ended up with a version that only fit his nephew. Then he added that he’d seen a “machine-wash safe” version on Alibaba and was now questioning every laundry symbol on earth.
At this point the woman behind us joined in, confidently announcing that “steam is the enemy of dignity,” which honestly sounded wise but completely unrelated. Another guy chimed in about how he shrunk three sweaters in one month. Suddenly we had a whole support group happening in line.
Security was visibly amused. I think they delayed our lane on purpose just to hear how the conversation would end.
After a few minutes, we collectively decided the safest option was:
No hot water.


No dryer.


Pray to whatever laundry gods you believe in.


He thanked us like we’d given him life-changing wisdom, folded the jubba carefully, and continued on his way. Meanwhile, the rest of us looked at each other like, “Did we just have a community moment at dawn?”
It was honestly the most wholesome thing that’s ever happened to me before breakfast.
Has anyone else ever been dragged into a completely unexpected conversation at an airport that briefly united strangers like some kind of temporary family?

1p8piee,https://www.reddit.com/r/limblengthening/comments/1p8piee/quadrilateral_lengthening_with_dr_giotikas/,Quadrilateral Lengthening with Dr Giotikas Surgery Day,"I arrived at the hospital in the morning and was directed to fill out some paperwork. After that was done, I was taken to my private room which comes with a TV, a remote-controlled inclinable bed, my own bathroom, and a desk. I then had my legs shaved and was made to change into my hospital gown, and was finally escorted to the surgery room. The surgery room was so cold that I couldn’t stop shivering even with my blanket. As I laid in the surgery room, I felt some more nerves than I did earlier, but before I knew it, I was awaken by one of the nurses. I had actually underwent the procedure without knowing and I had no recollection of going into anesthesia at all. I was shocked at how little pain I felt and how quick it all seemed that my first question was “Is it all done?”. I was then transported back into my room and having not slept much the night before, I was super tired and ending up sleeping throughout most of the night. I never once woke up from excessive pain or discomfort. Although my legs feel stiff and heavy (particularly my right leg), the pain is absolutely minimal - I’d say around 2.5/10. I was reassured by the head nurse and Dr Giotikas, both of whom were kind enough to visit me, that an imbalance in stiffness is absolutely normal. Only at one point I felt insanely light headed, my ears started ringing, and I suddenly started sweating profusely. I panicked a bit and called the nurse but after I took a few deep breaths I felt fine and my lightheadedness disappeared. Dinner last night consisted of chicken breast with rice and vegetables in a cream sauce, alongside bread, salad, apple, and strawberry jelly - all of which I found to be quite delicious. I was also served breakfast this morning which consisted of black coffee, bread with butter/jam, and pain au chocolat which was also delicious. It is around 20 hours since I fell into anesthesia, and at the moment, the only discomfort I have is around my glutes and back from sitting for a long time, but I will finally be able to walk around with some assistance in around a few hours so I am looking forward to that. I also just want to publicly praise Dr Giotikas and his team for how hospitable they are and how much they’ve made me feel at ease. They have regularly checked in on me, making sure I had no doubts or worries - I couldn’t recommend them enough. ",2,1764317526.0,limblengthening,0,1.0,False

Feeling like a rusty tin man lately? I get it! Mornings have been… crunchy. Getting out of bed sometimes feels like a full-blown workout *before* I even have coffee. Anyone else relate? 😅

Seriously though, stiffness is a real pain, especially when you're trying to enjoy the golden years. The first thing that pops into my head? ""Gotta call the chiropractor!"" $$$ But before you shell out the big bucks, maybe, *just maybe*, there's a simpler, wallet-friendlier way to ease those aches.

I'm talking gentle stretches.

Yeah, I know, ""stretching,"" sounds boring, right? Like something your gym teacher forced you to do in high school. But trust me, incorporating a few simple moves into your daily routine can make a HUGE difference. Think of it as giving your body a little ""thank you"" for all the years of hard work.

So, what kind of stretches are we talking about? Nothing crazy! We're going for gentle, not Olympic-level gymnastics. Here are a few ideas to get you started:

*   **Neck Rolls:** Slow, gentle circles. Listen to your body! No need to crank anything.
*   **Shoulder Shrugs:** Up, back, down. Release that tension!
*   **Seated Torso Twists:** Keep your core engaged and twist gently from side to side.
*   **Hamstring Stretches:** Seated or standing, just reach for those toes (or ankles!).
*   **Calf Stretches:** Find a wall, place your hands on it, and stretch one calf at a time.

I used to think stretching was a waste of time, but I was so wrong. A friend convinced me to give it a shot. Now, I'm practically evangelical about it. My back doesn't ache as much, and I can actually touch my toes (most days, anyway!). Plus, It feels good to actually MOVE, you know?

Sometimes, our bodies just need a little encouragement. And honestly, wouldn't you rather spend the money on something fun, like a weekend getaway, instead of endless chiropractor appointments? Just food for thought!

We believe in strongest people, and to get you started on your journey to a more flexible and comfortable you, here is a free guide with different Yoga resources.

1p8pcqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1p8pcqe/how_to_build_actual_intimacy_without_sex_the_deep/,How to build ACTUAL intimacy without sex: the deep connection guide everyone needs,"I've been noticing something lately. Most people think intimacy equals sex. Period. End of story. But here's what nobody's really talking about: some of the deepest connections I've seen (and studied) have absolutely nothing to do with what happens in the bedroom. 

This post isn't about my personal drama. It's about something way bigger. After diving into relationship research, psychology podcasts, and literally dozens of books on human connection, I realized we're all getting fed this watered-down version of intimacy from social media. Those ""relationship coaches"" on TikTok who've never studied attachment theory? They're missing the entire point.

The truth is, non-sexual intimacy is what actually keeps relationships alive long-term. It's what makes you feel seen, heard, and valued. And honestly? Most people are starving for it without even realizing it. So here's what actually works, backed by research and real relationship experts.

## **The vulnerability factor**

Dr. Brené Brown's research on vulnerability shows that emotional exposure is the birthplace of connection. When you share something that genuinely scares you to say out loud, you're handing someone a piece of yourself. Not the highlight reel version, the messy, unfiltered truth.

This means:

* **Sharing fears about your career, family, or future**
  * Talk about the stuff that keeps you up at 3am
  * Admit when you feel lost or confused
  * Let them see you processing difficult emotions in real time

* **Discussing past experiences that shaped who you are**
  * The childhood moments that still affect you today
  * Previous relationships and what you learned (or didn't)
  * Times you failed spectacularly and what it taught you

* **Opening up about insecurities without needing immediate reassurance**
  * Say ""I feel inadequate sometimes"" and sit with the discomfort
  * Share body image struggles, imposter syndrome, whatever's real
  * The key is not fishing for compliments, just being honest

According to research published in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, couples who engage in deeper self-disclosure report higher relationship satisfaction. The study found that quality of disclosure matters more than quantity. It's not about talking more, it's about talking deeper.

## **Undivided attention (the rarest commodity)**

We live in an era of constant partial attention. Your phone buzzes, your laptop dings, your brain is already three steps ahead. Dr. John Gottman, who's studied couples for over 40 years, calls these moments of connection ""bids for attention."" When your partner makes a bid and you actually respond with full presence? That's intimacy building in real time.

* **Put the phone in another room during conversations**
  * Not face down on the table, GONE
  * Studies show even a visible phone decreases conversation quality
  * Make it a habit for at least 30 minutes daily

* **Ask follow-up questions that show you're actually listening**
  * ""How did that make you feel?"" goes deeper than ""cool story""
  * Reference things they mentioned days ago
  * Show you're connecting dots between their experiences

* **Mirror their body language and maintain eye contact**
  * This isn't creepy when done naturally
  * Research shows mirroring builds rapport and trust
  * Eye contact releases oxytocin, the bonding hormone

The Gottman Institute found that couples who turn toward each other's bids for connection 86% of the time are still together six years later. Those who stay together only turn toward bids 33% of the time. That's a massive difference.

## **Shared experiences outside your comfort zone**

Psychologists call this ""self-expansion"" through relationships. Dr. Arthur Aron's famous bridge study showed that couples who experience novel, exciting activities together report higher relationship quality. The adrenaline and newness get associated with each other, not just the activity.

* **Take a class together in something neither of you knows**
  * Pottery, salsa dancing, rock climbing, whatever
  * Being equally bad at something is bonding
  * You create inside jokes and shared reference points

* **Travel to places that challenge your usual routine**
  * Doesn't have to be expensive or far
  * Getting lost in a new city forces teamwork
  * Navigating unfamiliar situations reveals how you work together

* **Try activities that require communication and trust**
  * Tandem biking, cooking complex recipes, escape rooms
  * Partner yoga is surprisingly intense for connection
  * Anything requiring ""we're in this together"" energy

A study in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology found that couples who engaged in exciting activities together showed increased relationship satisfaction compared to those who stuck to pleasant but mundane activities. Novel experiences literally make your brain associate your partner with reward and excitement.

## **Physical touch that isn't sexual**

The sad reality is most couples stop touching unless it's leading somewhere. But non-sexual touch is actually crucial for maintaining connection. Research from the Touch Research Institute shows that touch reduces cortisol and increases serotonin and dopamine.

* **Long hugs (minimum 20 seconds for oxytocin release)**
  * Most hugs last 3 seconds, go longer
  * Full body contact, not that side-hug nonsense
  * Let yourself actually relax into it

* **Head scratches, back rubs, or foot massages with zero expectation**
  * The ""zero expectation"" part is crucial
  * Touch given freely without agenda builds trust
  * Make it a regular thing, not just when someone's stressed

* **Holding hands during walks or while watching something**
  * Sounds basic but most couples stop doing this
  * It's a continuous connection without requiring focus
  * Studies show hand-holding during stress reduces anxiety responses

* **Sitting close enough that your bodies touch**
  * On the couch, at dinner, wherever
  * That constant low-level physical connection matters
  * It signals ""I want to be near you"" without words

Research published in Psychological Science found that even brief touches from a romantic partner significantly reduced stress responses when participants faced a threatening situation. Physical touch literally regulates our nervous system.

## **Rituals and routines that are just yours**

The Gottman Institute emphasizes the importance of shared meaning and rituals. These don't need to be elaborate. They just need to be consistent and yours.

* **Morning coffee together before the day starts**
  * Even 10 minutes of undistracted connection matters
  * Talk about dreams from the night before
  * Set intentions for the day together

* **Weekly check-ins where you discuss feelings and goals**
  * Schedule it like any important meeting
  * Use prompts if talking feels awkward at first
  * ""What made you feel loved this week?"" is a good starter

* **Specific phrases, jokes, or gestures only you two understand**
  * Inside jokes create a micro-culture
  * Secret signals for ""I love you"" in public
  * Nicknames that would sound ridiculous to others but mean everything to you

* **Celebration rituals for wins (big or small)**
  * Toast with cheap champagne for promotions or surviving Monday
  * Dance in the kitchen when something goes right
  * Acknowledging victories together strengthens team mentality

According to research in the Journal of Family Psychology, couples with more couple-specific rituals report higher relationship quality and lower likelihood of dissolution. These rituals create shared identity and meaning.

## **Supporting their individual growth**

Here's something counterintuitive: the healthiest intimate relationships involve supporting each other's independence. Dr. Esther Perel talks extensively about the importance of maintaining separateness within togetherness.

* **Encourage their hobbies even when you're not interested**
  * Ask genuine questions about their interests
  * Give them space and time without guilt
  * Show excitement when they're excited, even if it's about something you don't get

* **Celebrate their wins like they're your own**
  * No jealousy, no competition, pure support
  * Brag about them to others (they'll hear about it eventually)
  * Make them feel like their success is shared joy

* **Give space when they need it without taking it personally**
  * Sometimes people need to recharge alone
  * Secure attachment means trusting the connection remains
  * ""I'll be here when you're ready"" is powerful

* **Be their biggest cheerleader when pursuing goals**
  * Remember details about their projects or aspirations
  * Offer help when needed but don't take over
  * Believe in them especially when they doubt themselves

Research from the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology shows that perceived partner responsiveness to one's goals predicts relationship satisfaction even more strongly than responsiveness to daily events. Supporting their growth shows you see and value who they're becoming.

## **Resources to deepen your understanding**

**Books worth your time:**

* **""The State of Affairs"" by Esther Perel**  
This book completely changed how I understand intimacy and desire in long-term relationships. Perel is a couples therapist who's worked with thousands of couples, and she breaks down why people cheat and what it reveals about our needs for connection. The insights into maintaining erotic energy through emotional intimacy? Absolutely eye-opening. Best relationship book I've ever read, hands down.

* **""Hold Me Tight"" by Dr. Sue Johnson**  
Johnson developed Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT), which has the highest success rate of any couples therapy model. This book will make you question everything you think you know about what creates lasting bonds. She explains attachment science in a way that actually makes sense, with real couple examples. The exercises alone are worth the read. Insanely good read for understanding how emotional responsiveness creates security.

* **""Mating in Captivity"" by Esther Perel**  
Another Perel masterpiece. This one tackles the tension between security and desire, intimacy and sexuality. If you've ever wondered why long-term relationships often struggle with maintaining passion, this explains the psychological dynamics at play. She's a brilliant thinker who doesn't give you easy answers but makes you think deeply about what you actually want.

* **""The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work"" by John Gottman**  
Gottman has literally studied thousands of couples in his ""Love Lab."" This isn't fluffy advice, it's research-based strategies that predict relationship success with scary accuracy. The concept of building ""Love Maps"" (detailed knowledge of your partner's world) completely changed how I approach connection. This is the comprehensive guide for anyone serious about relationship skills.

**Podcasts that changed my perspective:**

* **Where Should We Begin? with Esther Perel**  
Real couples therapy sessions (with permission obviously). Hearing actual people navigate intimacy issues is incredibly valuable. You realize everyone struggles with connection in different ways.

* **The Gottman Relationship Blog Podcast**  
Short, practical episodes on specific relationship topics. They break down research findings into actionable advice without the academic jargon.

* **Unlocking Us with Brené Brown**  
While not exclusively about romantic relationships, Brown's conversations about vulnerability, shame, and connection are essential for understanding intimacy at a deeper level.

**Apps and tools:**

* **Lasting** (relationship counseling app with evidence-based programs)  
Think of it as therapy-lite with structured exercises and check-ins. Based on Gottman Method, EFT, and other proven approaches. The daily questions prompt conversations you might not have otherwise. Actually helpful for building intimacy skills systematically. Around $12/month which beats $200 therapy sessions.

* **Paired** (relationship app with daily questions and quizzes)  
Fun way to discover new things about each other. The questions range from silly to deeply personal. My favorite feature is comparing how you each answered. Reveals blind spots and creates natural conversation starters. Free version is decent, premium is like $10/month.

* **BeFreed** (personalized audio learning app)  
Okay, I need to mention this here because it's been huge for my own growth in understanding relationships. BeFreed generates personalized podcast-style lessons from top books, research papers, and expert talks—basically everything I mentioned in this post. I've been using it to go deeper into attachment theory and communication patterns, and honestly, it's replaced a ton of my mindless scrolling time. You can literally type ""how to communicate better in relationships"" and it pulls from legitimate sources to create a custom audio lesson with the exact depth you want. I've gone through content from Gottman, Perel, and Sue Johnson this way during my commute. The voice options are actually addictive—I usually pick the deep, thoughtful one that sounds like Samantha from Her when I'm doing serious learning. It's built by Columbia grads and AI experts from Google, so the quality is solid. Since using it, I've noticed I'm way more articulate about my feelings and less reactive during tough conversations. Genuinely essential if you're serious about lifelong learning around relationships.

* **Gottman Card Decks App** (conversation starters based on research)  
Digital version of their physical card decks. Questions designed to build friendship, manage conflict, and create shared meaning. Great for couples who want to go deeper but don't know where to start. Basically professional-level conversation prompts in your pocket.

The science is clear: non-sexual intimacy is what predicts long-term relationship success more than almost any other factor. Sexual connection is important, obviously. But without these deeper forms of intimacy, you're basically just roommates who occasionally hook up.

Building real intimacy takes intentionality. It means showing up consistently, being vulnerable when it's uncomfortable, and actually paying attention to another human in an age of infinite distraction. It's not always easy or natural, especially if you didn't grow up seeing healthy intimacy modeled. But it's learnable. These skills can be developed with practice and willingness.

The relationships that last aren't the ones with perfect chemistry or incredible sex. They're the ones where two people consistently choose connection over convenience, vulnerability over comfort, and presence over distraction. That's the real work, and honestly, it's worth every bit of effort.",1,1764316929.0,OdysseyBookClub,0,1.0,False

1p8paf7,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1p8paf7/8_signs_someone_has_a_secret_crush_on_you_and/,8 signs someone has a secret crush on you (and what to do about it),"Okay, so you've been getting weird vibes from someone. They act different around you. They're always *there* somehow. And you're sitting there wondering, ""Wait, do they like me, or am I just making shit up?"" 

Look, I've spent way too much time digging into human behavior, attachment psychology, and social dynamics. I've read everything from evolutionary psychology studies to Matthew Hussey's dating books, listened to hundreds of hours of psychology podcasts, and watched too many relationship experts break this down. And honestly? Most advice online is garbage. It's either some random TikTok influencer making sweeping generalizations for views or someone who's never actually studied human behavior giving you their hot take. 

Here's the thing: figuring out if someone has a crush on you isn't about playing detective with one or two signs. It's about patterns. It's about understanding how humans behave when they're attracted to someone but trying to keep it under wraps. And yeah, there's actual science behind this, not just vibes.

So let me break down the real signs, backed by research and expert insight, that someone's secretly into you.

## step 1: they mirror your body language (like clockwork)

Mirroring is one of the most subconscious signs of attraction. When someone likes you, their body literally tries to sync up with yours. Studies in social psychology show that people unconsciously mimic the gestures, posture, and even speech patterns of people they're attracted to. It's called the chameleon effect.

If they cross their arms when you do, lean in when you lean in, or match your energy without even realizing it, that's a huge tell. They're subconsciously trying to build rapport and connection with you. Pay attention next time you're together. Do they angle their body toward you? Do they copy your movements? If yes, their brain is basically screaming ""I like you"" even if their mouth isn't.

## step 2: prolonged eye contact (but they look away fast)

Eye contact is intense when there's attraction involved. Research from Harvard psychologist Zick Rubin found that couples in love spend significantly more time gazing into each other's eyes than friends do. But here's the thing with secret crushes: they'll stare at you when they think you're not looking, then quickly look away when you catch them.

If you notice someone constantly stealing glances at you, holding eye contact just a beat too long, or looking flustered when your eyes meet, yeah, they're probably into you. Their pupils might even dilate when they look at you. That's pure biology. You can't fake that.

## step 3: they remember stupid details about you

When someone has a crush, they pay attention. Like, scary amounts of attention. They remember random things you mentioned three weeks ago in passing. You mention you hate mushrooms once, and suddenly they're ordering food without mushrooms for you. You casually say you love a certain band, and boom, they bring it up weeks later.

According to Dr. Helen Fisher, a biological anthropologist who studies love and attraction, people in the early stages of romantic interest hyper-focus on the object of their affection. Your crush's brain is basically running a highlight reel of everything you've ever said. If someone remembers details about your life that even you forgot you mentioned, they're paying *very* close attention.

## step 4: they find excuses to be around you (constantly)

This one's obvious but people ignore it. If someone's always ""randomly"" showing up where you are, texting you for no real reason, or finding ways to extend conversations, they're not just being friendly. They're creating opportunities to be near you.

Psychologists call this proximity seeking. Humans are wired to want to be close to people they're attracted to. So if someone's consistently in your orbit, even when there's no logical reason for them to be there, their subconscious is pulling them toward you.

## step 5: nervous energy and fidgeting around you

When someone likes you but hasn't confessed it yet, they're going to be nervous around you. Period. Their body betrays them. They might fidget with their hair, play with their phone, tap their fingers, adjust their clothes constantly. These are all signs of nervous energy.

Studies on nonverbal communication show that anxiety and attraction create similar physical responses: increased heart rate, sweaty palms, restlessness. If someone seems weirdly on edge around you but calm around everyone else, that's not social anxiety. That's a crush.

## step 6: they get jealous (but try to hide it)

Jealousy is a dead giveaway. If someone has a secret crush on you, they'll get weird when you mention dating other people or when someone else flirts with you. They might get quiet, change the subject quickly, or suddenly act less interested in the conversation.

Evolutionary psychologists argue that jealousy evolved as a mechanism to protect romantic bonds. Even if there's no official relationship, their brain is treating you like a potential partner and reacting to perceived threats. So if they seem bothered when you talk about someone else you're interested in, connect the dots.

## step 7: they go out of their way to help you (even with small stuff)

When someone's into you, they'll find reasons to be useful. They'll offer to help you move, bring you coffee, lend you things, give you rides, whatever. Acts of service become their love language whether they realize it or not.

Relationship expert Gary Chapman talks about love languages, and acts of service is a big one. If someone's constantly doing little things for you without expecting anything in return, they're trying to show you they care in a way that feels safe to them. It's their way of saying ""I like you"" without actually saying it.

## step 8: their friends act weird around you

If their friends know, you'll notice. Friends of someone with a crush will often act strange around the crush object. They might smirk, exchange looks, tease their friend when you're around, or suddenly leave you two alone together. Friends are terrible at keeping secrets.

Social psychology research shows that people confide in their close friends about romantic interests. If someone's friends are acting like they know something you don't, it's because they probably do. They're in on the secret.

## what to do if you spot these signs

Alright, so you've identified the signs. Now what? First, assess your own feelings. Are you into them too? If yes, make a move or drop hints that you're interested. Life's too short to play games.

If you're not interested, don't lead them on. Be kind but clear in your interactions. Don't give mixed signals just because the attention feels good.

And if you're unsure? Test the waters. Flirt a little. See how they respond. Suggest hanging out one on one. Their reaction will tell you everything you need to know.

## resources that actually helped me understand this stuff

**Attached by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller**  
This book is a game changer for understanding how people behave in relationships and why some people are more cautious about expressing feelings. It's grounded in attachment theory, which has decades of research behind it. Insanely good read if you want to understand relationship dynamics on a deeper level.

**The Science of Love podcast**  
Hosted by relationship experts who break down the psychology and neuroscience of attraction. They interview researchers, therapists, and real people about how attraction works. Way better than random dating advice from influencers.

**BeFreed**  
Okay, I need to mention BeFreed here because it's honestly how I went from casually interested in psychology to actually understanding this stuff. It's a personalized AI learning app (built by a team from Columbia University) that turns books, research papers, and expert interviews into custom audio podcasts based on what you want to learn.

I told it I wanted to improve my social skills and understand attraction patterns, and it pulled from sources like evolutionary psychology research, relationship expert talks, and communication studies to create bite-sized audio lessons for me. I can ask it questions mid-podcast when something doesn't click, and it explains things in a way that actually makes sense. The voice options are weirdly addictive too—I switch between a deep, thoughtful voice and a more energetic one depending on my mood. Helped me finish way more content than I ever would have by just reading, and honestly, my conversations feel way more natural now because I actually retained what I learned.

**Matthew Hussey's YouTube channel**  
Say what you want, but Matthew Hussey actually knows his stuff. He's a behavioral psychologist who specializes in dating and relationships. His videos on reading body language and understanding attraction cues are gold.

**The app Paired**  
This app is designed for couples but it has daily questions and psychology based insights that help you understand relationship dynamics better. Even if you're single, the content is useful for understanding how people communicate interest and affection.

Look, humans are complicated. Biology, psychology, social conditioning, past experiences, all of it shapes how we express interest in someone. But once you understand the patterns, the signs become pretty clear. Trust your gut. Pay attention to behavior over words. And most importantly, don't overthink it to the point of paralysis. If you like someone and they're showing these signs, take the leap. The worst that happens is you get a clear answer and can move forward. That beats sitting in limbo forever.",2,1764316711.0,OdysseyBookClub,0,1.0,False

While we were gone.... we brewed up a surprise for you — our third prototype, one step closer to the Coffee Bomb ☕💣!



Not sure what a Coffee Bomb is? Well, we got you! 🫵



Made from 100% compressed coffee ☕️, our Coffee Bomb uses bath bomb technology — just drop it in water, watch it fizz 💥, and enjoy pure coffee magic 🪄 . It dissolves smoothly in hot or cold water, and with its fun shapes and  toppings❗️, it offers a visually satisfying, flavorful, and portable caffeine fix you can enjoy anywhere, anytime. ✨😻



With the use of Nutella 🍫, honey 🍯, milk 🥛, and coffee ☕️ , we were able to shape our Coffee Bomb to the same way we are planning to have it! One even has marshmallow inside! 🙈



With this, we need your help to making our Coffee Bomb real 🫂! Here's what we’d love your feedback on:



🤎 What would you change or improve if you could redesign our current prototype?

🤎 If you could add one new twist or feature to the Coffee Bomb, what would it be?

🤎 Is there anything you'd like us to clarify or improve?



Thank you a latte for supporting us in the creation of our Coffee Bomb! 💣❤️☕️",1,1764316402.0,ADMU,1,1.0,False

1p8p6yj,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/1p8p6yj/should_i_block_her/,Should I Block her?,"There was a girl in my college. I saw her in the cafeteria while I was sitting with my friend; she came and sat next to us. I was talking with my friend, and we had eye contact, and she gave me a smile. I gave her a smile back, and then we walked out from there.

Next week, I saw her again at the cafeteria. We had eye contact. She gave me a smile again, and I gave her a smile back. She was buying a coffee; I was next in line. We had a little conversation. We exchanged our names, and then I left.

Then the next week, I saw her again. We had a really nice talk at the campus. We hung out for about 2 hours. We exchanged numbers as well. When I left, she sent me a text: “It was so nice meeting you today. You’re such a genuine and kind person. I really enjoyed our time together. Thank you for making my day special.” I replied back to her as well, but since then she frequently started texting me, even though we met at college every week. Literally, she started texting me every day.

I met her again at college the next week. She skipped class for me. We hung out for about 30 minutes, and then I was like, “I have to go; my class is starting.” She said, “No, stay here; my class ends in 5 minutes. I’ll be back.” I was like, “No, I have to go.” She said no and ran to her class. I still went to my class.

In 10 minutes she started texting me, “Where are you?” nonstop and started FaceTiming me a couple of times. I literally had to switch off my phone while in class. My class was in another building. When I turned on my phone, she again texted me, “Text me when you’re done.” I texted her back, “Sorry, I was in class; couldn’t get back to you.”

Then she texted me, “I thought I upset you.” I was like, “Nah, you’re good.” She again texted me, “Sweaty, do you want something to eat?” Remember, it was only 2 weeks since we met. Her text sounded a little weird; I didn’t reply.

The next day, in the middle of the day, she started calling me and FaceTiming me. I didn’t pick up her call. No matter what, she doesn’t seem to be respecting my time. She was being too clingy. She did the same thing for the whole week. I avoided her in college as well.

The next week, she texted me again, “Are you in college?” I said yes. Then we met and started a conversation normally. I told her, “It seems like you’re a big texter.” She was like, “No, I am not.” She didn’t accept that she was spamming me. I told her, “I am not a big texter; I am busy. I work as well.” She said, “Oh, ok, I will not text you all the time.”

Since then, she started texting me while I was on campus, and I didn’t respond to her. She is still texting me every week even though I keep ignoring her.

1p8p6av,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1p8p6av/my_bf_underreacts_to_accidentsmistakes_and_it/,My bf under-reacts to accidents/mistakes and it makes me so frustrated,"I (36f) feel frustrated at my bfs(33) super “relaxed” reaction to incidents that happen that genuinely concern me. He always ends up being so relaxed I feel like he either doesn’t care or isn’t interested in trying to prevent them from happening again and when I tell him he seems almost laissez- faire that it comes off as detached. When I tell him I can’t tell that he cares and it bothers me or makes my anxiety about the situation worse, he says I’m being “crazy” and he’s reacting normally. I guess what I want to know is if his reactions seem frustrating or if I’m just being too hyper anxious? (I’m definitely an anxious person and ADHD being evaluated for Autism currently so I may not have a typical read in the situation) 

For instance, these types of situations happened twice today. Earlier he made ramen on the stove. A few hours later I go into the kitchen and it feels warm in there and I can smell that hot stove smell.(it’s a gas stove) So I check to see if the oven is on, it’s not. Then I realize that when he was cooking he didn’t turn the burner off. Instead of turning it clockwise to the far left “off” position, he had turned it to the right where the burner was so low you couldn’t see an active flame but the gas was going and the range was hot- so technically on. I called to him and said, “dude, you left the stove on this whole time and it’s just been pumping out gas?!” I was worried about the fire risk and was not sure about turning the burner on next to it bc I wasn’t sure if it had been pumping out gas this whole time and regardless, we have pets and it’s a huge fire hazard. He said something about how “well nothing bad happened” and asked why I was so upset. I repeated my same points and how bad it could have been. He just 🤷🏻‍♀️ but it didn’t so what’s the problem? I told him I want him to recognize it was a bad mistake and take it serious so I knew it was less likely to happen again. To which he said he hadn’t done it before and so why was I acting all crazy about it and escalating the situation. I told him I can’t tell he cares and I want for him to respond in a way that shows me it’s a deal to him and that calling me crazy over being freaked out over the stove being left on for hours was really crummy. 

Then later this evening I had a candle burning on the coffee table and we left the room to change the sheets on the bed. When we got out of the bedroom I was like, “what’s that smell?” Because I smelled something burning or weird. He said all he could smell was the face mask I had on lol. I look and see that there’s a decent amount of ash around the candle. We keep the candle in a tray where it’s elevated a bit. I pickup some of the ashes to look and it’s either paper or a napkin. He moseys in and just looks at my hand, “what’s is that?” I tell him what I think it is and start investigating the table and surroundings to make sure no embers drifted and there wasn’t a little fire starting somewhere. Oh, and my home burned down when I was in high school so I definitely have some extra panic around house fires. He just says, “I don’t think I put anything there”. I tell him I know but it had to have come from somewhere and where exactly?? Like how freaky, omg I’m glad it wasn’t worse. On the table my earbuds case were burned a little and my pill bottle for my prescription was actually so burned the plastic was warped. I ask him to look on the other side of the table while I look on the opposite side. He just tilts his body and goes, “it’s good”. I definitely was a little upset and asked “did you even look? Like can you go to the other side and actually look?” He again starts on how I’m getting too upset and I tell him that given something similar happened earlier today, I am upset and freaked out and he’s doing that thing again where he seems to not be pressed about it at all. He goes off on how I am making it worse and why do I over react, he’s just staying calm and nothing bad happened and we should be thankful. To me, yes of course I’m GLAD it wasn’t worse but this is still not okay that something avoidable happened and I’m honestly embarrassed something careless like this did happen. It’s not just okay, even though it is small. 

Scenarios like this have happened throughout our relationship and I don’t understand how he can be SOOOO calm and just not care to investigate or state how we can prevent it from happening again. Or even a “omg!” come from his mouth. It’s just this vibe of “it could be worse so this isn’t a big deal at all” that makes me frustrated. And he can’t understand why I want him to react to things. Or why it makes me feel frustrated. Like, what is going on? Am I just a dramatic baby who needs answers and solutions to everything and he’s reacting in a typical, cool headed way or am I being normal and he’s just completely in la la land? 😅😵‍💫

after how much he looked after you back in the day, we owe it to him to be good hosts.”

line.

The Spencers and the Jones Organization were old allies. Generationally, Chase was senior to her a fact that had once defined their entire relationship. 

When Caroline was eight, her parents died in an accident, and she was suddenly an orphan. Terrified, she hid in a closet, crying until she fell asleep, only to wake up and start crying all over again. 

It was a sixteen–year–old Chase Spencer who found her. He brought her to live with his family, and from then on, he took care of everything for her, big and small. He drove her to school, taught her how to navigate the world, and showered her with a kind of favoritism and special treatment that everyone else envied. Slowly, he filled the emotional void left by the loss of her parents… 

For ten years, he raised her to be carefree and vibrant.

# Caroline Jones was in the breakroom pouring coffee when her uncle called. 

“Caroline, Chase Spencer’s in Northwood. Come home for dinner tonight. He rarely makes it out here, and 

after how much he looked after you back in the day, we owe it to him to be good hosts.”

line. 

Caroline’s mind drifted off, and she didn’t snap out of it until the hot coffee overflowed and scalded her hand. 

“Okay, I got it,*”* she said before hanging up. 

The Spencers and the Jones Organization were old allies. Generationally, Chase was senior to her a fact that had once defined their entire relationship. 

When Caroline was eight, her parents died in an accident, and she was suddenly an orphan. Terrified, she hid in a closet, crying until she fell asleep, only to wake up and start crying all over again. 

It was a sixteen–year–old Chase Spencer who found her. He brought her to live with his family, and from then on, he took care of everything for her, big and small. He drove her to school, taught her how to navigate the world, and showered her with a kind of favoritism and special treatment that everyone else envied. Slowly, he filled the emotional void left by the loss of her parents… 

For ten years, he raised her to be carefree and vibrant. 

Until five years ago… 

Caroline shoved down the churning emotions and threw herself back into her work. 

Just as she was about to leave for the day, Caroline walked out of a conference room and caught a glimpse of a familiar figure in the reception area. She froze. 

It was Chase Spencer, 

As if sensing her gaze, Chase looked over. 

“All done?” He stood and walked toward her. At nearly six–foot–three, he had an imposing presence. The black overcoat he wore made him look tall and sharp, his expression as serious as ever. He was immaculate, not a single detail out of place.

At Instacart, we invite the world to share love through food because we believe everyone should have access to the food they love and more time to enjoy it together. Where others see a simple need for grocery delivery, we see exciting complexity and endless opportunity to serve the varied needs of our community. We work to deliver an essential service that customers rely on to get their groceries and household goods, while also offering safe and flexible earnings opportunities to Instacart Personal Shoppers.
Instacart has become a lifeline for millions of people, and we’re building the team to help push our shopping cart forward. If you’re ready to do the best work of your life, come join our table.

Learn more about our flexible approach to where we work.
## **Overview**
Instacart’s Platform team powers the foundational capabilities behind our marketplace and Storefront Pro, including order management, pricing and discounting, loyalty, fraud, and customer experience. We’re hiring a Global Payments Product Manager to lead the strategy and execution of our payments platform that supports our four-sided marketplace of customers, shoppers, retailers, and advertisers.
In this role, you will optimize our end-to-end payment stack to improve authorization rates, reduce cost of payments, and scale a resilient multi-PSP architecture across existing and new markets. You’ll work closely with engineering, data, finance, operations, legal, and compliance internally, and with external partners such as PSPs (e.g., Stripe, Adyen, Braintree) and card networks (Visa/Mastercard). This is a high-impact opportunity to shape how money moves at Instacart—covering unique use cases like EBT and health-related payments, post-order modifications and substitutions, shopper payouts, and Instacart+ subscriptions.
If you thrive in a fast-paced, highly cross-functional environment and love solving complex, global-scale payments challenges, this role offers the chance to deliver measurable improvements to reliability, conversion, cost, and customer experience.
## **About the Job**
  * Own the global payments roadmap and strategy across authorization, routing, retries, tokenization, chargebacks/disputes, and refunds/partial captures, with clear KPIs for conversion, cost, latency, and reliability.
  * Design and scale a multi-PSP platform, including smart routing, failover, experimentation frameworks, and performance monitoring to continuously improve auth rates and reduce processing costs.
  * Expand payment methods in the US and internationally, including wallets, local payment methods, EBT SNAP, HSA/FSA, and other emerging options, ensuring compliance with regional and network requirements.
  * Partner closely with engineering (working with approximately 10–20 engineers) to define PRDs, scope systems, manage delivery timelines, and uphold high standards for availability, security, and PCI compliance.
  * Collaborate across Platform, Fraud, Order Management, Loyalty, Pricing/Discounting, Shopper (for payouts), and Instacart+ (for subscriptions) to support nuanced flows like post-order changes, substitutions, partial captures, and disbursements.
  * Manage external relationships with PSPs and card networks—driving performance reviews, negotiating favorable terms, running vendor evaluations, and ensuring SLAs and compliance are consistently met.


## **About You**
### Minimum Qualifications
  * 6+ years of product management experience, including 3+ years focused on payments, ecommerce, or financial platform products.
  * Proven track record optimizing payment stacks at scale, including improving authorization rates, reducing processing costs, and integrating or scaling multi-PSP platforms.
  * Hands-on experience delivering core payments capabilities such as routing and retries, tokenization/vaulting, 3DS/payer authentication, chargebacks/disputes, and refunds/partial captures.
  * Proficiency with data and experimentation (e.g., SQL and analytics tools) to define KPIs, diagnose issues, and drive A/B tests or holdouts that inform product decisions.
  * Demonstrated success working cross-functionally with engineering, operations, finance, legal, and compliance, as well as externally with PSPs and card networks.
  * Working knowledge of PCI DSS, card network rules, and regional payments regulations and privacy standards.
  * Bachelor’s degree in business, engineering, computer science, or a related field; equivalent practical experience considered.


### Preferred Qualifications
  * Experience building for multi-sided marketplaces and/or core platform domains such as order management systems, loyalty programs, pricing/discounting, fraud prevention, or subscription models.
  * Familiarity with EBT SNAP, HSA/FSA, wallets, BNPL, and local payment methods across international markets.
  * Experience managing PSP/vendor relationships, advocating for product needs, and negotiating commercial terms.
  * Background supporting payouts/disbursements for contractors or shoppers and related reconciliation flows.
  * MBA or advanced technical/strategy degree.

1p8ov9a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p8ov9a,"Meetings with Russian poets of the New Spring, Igor Karaulov, Dinara Kerimova and Natalia Nelyubova, were held in Bishkek and Kant","The writers met with university students and teachers, schoolchildren and teachers, Kyrgyz writers, connoisseurs of modern poetry and author's song.

Igor Karaulov:

>Poetry is a force that lasts a long time. Poetry is written faster than prose, and it reflects current events and new phenomena more quickly. Therefore, if a person is interested in what is happening to us, he needs to read modern poetry. It is with great pleasure that we introduce our poetry to the people of Kyrgyzstan. Diverse authors have come here, and I'm sure every listener and reader will find something interesting for themselves.

Dinara Kerimova:

>This is an amazing country, and I am especially pleased to be part of the delegation of poets invited here. The impressions are the most vivid and emotional. We had an intense program, there was an amazing audience, ""charged up"" in a good way. They listened to us attentively, and at the end of the events they approached us and were interested in our work. It seems to me that such trips are useful for Russian poets. It broadens both our literary horizons and the horizons of readers from different countries.

The poetry evening ""Poets of the New Spring"" was held at the Russian Drama Theater named after Ch. Aitmatov. The audience got acquainted with the already well-known works of the authors included in poetry collections, as well as with completely new poems that were read in public for the first time. The meeting was hosted by Dmitry Balbekin, an artist of the Russian Theater. 

Tatiana Dyachenko, participant of the poetry evening: 

>The meeting with the poets made a very vivid impression on me. The poets were very diverse and vibrant, and it was a great discovery for me. I remember the tales of the Siberian peoples performed by Natalia Nelyubova, a poem by Igor Karaulov based on Scottish ballads, and very personal and touching lines by Dinara Kerimova. Listening to poets is a great pleasure.

The Kyrgyz-Russian Slavic University hosted a lecture for philology students, a meeting with the community of the Literary Kyrgyzstan magazine and a creative evening ""The Voice of the Epoch"" hosted by Galina Ketova, and a creative meeting in the format of a literary coffee shop at the Balasagyn Kyrgyz National University. Natalia Nelyubova held a meeting at the ""Russia with You"" center of the K. Bayalinov Republican Library for Children and Youth. 

Two meetings with young people were held at the Russian center of the Chui Regional Library (Kant). Igor Karaulov and Dinara Kerimova introduced civilian poetry to the students of the military school of the Russian air base in Kant. Natalia Nelyubova conducted a master class on writing fairy tales and songs with students of Kant schools.  

Darius Isakov, participant of the master class: 

>I really enjoyed the songwriting workshop. Our talents have been revealed here. Each of the guys wrote a few lines and contributed to the creation of the songs, but despite this confusion, it turned out to be very beautiful and melodic. And thanks to Natalia Nelyubova, the lines really sounded.

In the near future, Russian authors can be heard on Oksana Kryukova's literary podcast on the website and on Sputnik radio. Kyrgyzstan. 

We sincerely thank our partners for participating in organizing creative meetings: the Kyrgyz-Russian Slavic University named after B. Yeltsin, the Kyrgyz National University named after J. Balasagyn, the State National Russian Drama Theater named after Ch. Aitmatov, the Republican Library for Children and Youth named after K. Bayalinov, the Chui Regional Library and Sputnik. Kyrgyzstan. Many thanks to the authors for sharing their creations, as well as to all the viewers and participants of the discussions for their kind participation!

1p8oueh,https://i.redd.it/amucaxq5ay3g1.jpeg,Gifted a Go - so happy! (And wired),"I was gifted an early Xmas gift from the best sibling in the world! A Go, the metal filter/flow cap set, and extra papers! As an Amazon bonus, there was also a bonus aeropress travel coffee mug included! The mug is great, fits the press on top and has a nice detail of an aeropress on the sip hole madooey and graphic on the side. I was surprised at the red lid, somehow it looked thick and solid on YouTube but mine is very thin and floppy. I love how light and compact it is tho as a set. 

My first coffee was some pre ground Starbucks espresso I found the bag beside the regular ass coffee maker, two scoops and boiled water (sat for two minutes like I’ve seen on YouTube), I left it to sit for an unknown amount of time (dinner prep at the same time) probably less than 10 min. Divided it to three ppl with a touch of hot water added and milk/creamer! Despite it being Starbucks and pre ground, it was still a nice cup of coffee! It was on the more bitter end though, is it too long? 

Second cup was one scoop of a mix of zavida winter roast + kicking horse kick ass, and another unknown whole bean (end of bag) , ground together a few days ago. This was steeped maybe 3-5 minutes. This was a much fruitier and tastier coffee, but muted more and more as I drank it. Is that from milk or cream being added? Is aeropress coffee meant to be drank quickly? 

Anyway for my first tries, I was pretty happy with the results, I would appreciate any advice and tips! I’m not going to be getting a hand grinder in the foreseeable future but any tips for machine ground or pre ground? Thanks everyone the inspiration and knowledge here, I have come to this sub in the past month to learn more about it and now feel armed and dangerous with my own woot woot!

1p8osme,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1p8osme/my_personal_freedom_is_mine/,My personal freedom is MINE.,"I (35M) left my childhood home after barely 24 hours of being there after realizing my recent trauma has been continually invalidated. Now I see how I ended up in a predatory relationship that got me groomed and sexually assaulted in the first place, because I have been conditioned to feel like:

-My needs don't matter, speaking up about them will be minimized, dismissed, ignored or punished

-Shutting down when I realize the above makes them annoyed and continually more frustrated that I exist 

-There is no escape but to escape. As a child, I have run away from home several times for several hours at a time.

Today was yet another reminder that I need to do as I'm told. Well I said fuck that, and fuck you.

Yesterday was yet another round of invalidation and ignoring my trauma as a rape and emotional abuse survivor. Every day I grapple with horror, fear, anger, sadness, and numbness. 

My mother would rather look for a key she dropped in her car than listen to me, or tell me I need to ""let it go"" or ""learn to relax"" and goes on her bullshit monologues about nothing. So I do what I've always done growing up, I shut down. Make myself small. All day today (thanksgiving day) I was shut down. I did not speak or look at any of my family. I stayed away from them. I was guilted for not ""socializing"" and ""having a good day"". I was gaslit in the morning for not hearing her ask for coffee. I was in my room when she mumbled it. She says I was in the living room. Yet another trigger from my past abusive ""relationship"".

When I got home I went to my room. 
She knocks firmly and walks in and says ""you're not sitting in here, come to the living room"". 

She walks out.
I did not obey. 

She came into my room 20 min later and stood there. 

""You can stand there all night but I'm not leaving my room"".  

""You don't give a shit about anyone else's feelings"", she said. 

I said ""you should really think about what you just said to me"". 

""What did I do to you? I am your mother."" 

""I don't have to explain myself to you.""

She repeated. ""What did I do to you?""

""I am this close to leaving and going home tonight.""

She repeated.

""Leave my room please""

She repeated.

""LEAVE MY ROOM PLEASE!!!""

She left finally. I slammed the door and started packing my things to leave, as I'd already been contemplating it when we got back home.

She tried to block me from leaving. She said ""you're not leaving!"". 
I yelled ""YOU DONT OWN ME!!"" as I was headed towards the side door. I skirted under the garage door as it was opening. She shut it back before it even raised all the way. 

I raged in my car on the way back to my home two hours away. I screamed like I haven't screamed in at least a decade. No one heard it except for me. 

I got home. I cried some. Then I sobbed. I miss my cat. She died this year. My grandmother died this year. I realized three months ago that I was raped twice by a psychopath who lied, manipulated and exploited my kindness for over a year. It took a year to realize I was raped. I was in a terrible trauma bond where someone was willfully lying and manipulating me to be their punching bag, their play toy. I had nearly lost my mind. Now the clarity is even more horrifying.

My eyes are in pain from the crying after I got to MY home. I was shaking. Angry. Hyperventilating. Everything. I feel tension in my chest, always. Every day of my life. My chest hurts, my heart hurts worse when the tension is too high, for too long. Sleep isn't enough. 

I am so tired. I felt cornered and I left. I don't feel safe at ""home"" anymore. Fuck the holidays and fuck my family that set me up for the trauma and CPTSD I have now. 
I am done freezing. Freezing is what led to my rapes. I will fight to escape. I am no longer an object to be used and exploited. NOBODY OWNS ME BUT ME.

I don't want to exist just to be a helper, to be a fixer, to be a manager of everyone else, anymore.

$2250/mo rent includes: Xfinity WiFi, hot water, sewage, trash, and pest control.

Additional utilities to pay separately: Electric and Gas is separate (It’s usually ~$70/mo combined).

Additional $1500 security deposit for the following furnishings: 

55 in TV w Roku streambar and subwoofer, tv stand, Phillips/WiZ app-controlled lights/lantern lamps all around the apartment, credenza, vintage leather couch, dining table and two chairs, two counter stools for kitchen island, a togo lounge chair, hanging hammock chair, tons of kitchen gadgets and gizmos, and basic kitchenware. *Queen bed and mattress available upon request.

I love them, but no pets please. Indoor parking spot available for ~$250/mo.

Unique feature(s) of the building or unit?:
•The building amenities include a newly renovated gym, several well-maintained app operated laundry rooms, a lounge with a pool table, a rooftop deck with grills and fire pits, a courtyard patio, a coffee/tea machine, and multiple vending machines. There is covered garage parking for a monthly fee as well (~$250/mo). The building offers a $95 bundled monthly package for wi-Fi, water, sewage, and trash (this is included in the sublease rent).

Favorite things about the interior of the unit?
•It’s a vintage-esque, cozy, charming and massive (750 sq ft) corner unit, right around the corner from an elevator and down the hall from trash chute, laundry and the gym. The alcove “L” shaped studio layout is super unique and allows for the “bedroom” to be hidden. Lots of space for artwork with 12.5ft ceilings, exposed beams and brick walls. 

•This studio apartment is shockingly perfect for hosting because of the kitchen island and huge living space. Hangouts feel warm, inviting and comfortable. Plenty of space to get creative. I just recently DIY updated the countertops and backsplash to something a bit more fun.

•Double vanity in the bathroom with a giant wall to wall mirror. Best part is the ridiculous amount of closets and storage space. There’s a coat closet next to the front door, a linen closet with shelving in the “bedroom”, a large closet in the hallway, a double door closet in the bathroom, and a linen closet across the toilet.

•The east facing windows are perfect for most house plants. Plenty of direct light in the mornings and afternoons.

Best things about the building?
•The 24/7 doorman service is staffed by the sweetest, most accommodating people. Maintenance is typically on-site daily to address issues. Several private entrances that allow for a very peaceful and safe big city and large building experience. 

Best things about the neighborhood?
•Everything is walkable and with Lincoln Park just up the road, the North Ave and Oak Street beaches are ~20 min walk.
•You have an Aldi and a Jewel Osco within a 5-7 walk. Tons of cafes, bars, restaurants, workout studios, and shops all around. Nothing better than being just steps from your apt after a night out!
•Equidistant from ORD and MDW. Easy access to the highway. TONS of options for public transit- closest train stations are the Division Red Line and Sedgwick Brown/Purple Line. The 36, 22, 156, 70, 72, and 37 busses are all within a 4-8 min walk.

What makes this place worthy of calling home?
•It’s central to almost every neighborhood. 15 mins on the bus to Wicker Park. 15 min walk to Lincoln park. 15 mins walk to River North. Your quality of life will significantly improve from how comfortable and convenient this apartment is.

Please send me a message if you’d like to see photos or videos of the apartment furnished or unfurnished. Will comment link to videos on this post.

I also think you can really notice the difference of my numbers in my chart - so thought I’d upload.

1. Chart cycle 1st with Mira
2. Chart cycle 2nd with Mira and after a few lifestyle changes + supplements 
3. BFP digital.. praying it works out from here!

Things that worked for me.
1. Mira + Chat GPT. Mira alone was giving me almost no analysis, increasing my anxiety and not helping me understand my numbers. 
I still love Mira but you do just need chat gpt to make sense of it.
 
2. Lifestyle changes - I think this made a big difference - stopped HIIT and did weight training instead, reduced alcohol to a rare one glass of wine with food, one coffee a day, started eating breakfast, walked to work every morning, more protein with more dairy, lots snd lots of vegetables and sleeping 8hrs a night. 

Felt like I was living like a monk! But it did make a big difference to me specifically. 

3. Supplements - I started these first cycle with Mira but apparently it takes a while to adjust - Q10, myoinsitol, zinc, vitamin c, vitamin d, vitamin b12, folate, omega 3 and magnesium. 
I’m very iron sensitive so couldn’t take a multi vitamin. I took a larger dose of Q10 and I think that may have impacted my numbers too. 


Who knows if it will work out for me… but the positive test felt like huge progress .

And whilst the *Pineapple’s* crew would quite happily have watched a game or two, they were in fact otherwise engaged.



“For the love of every fucking demonic entity will someone please silence that fucking alarm?!” Ivy yelled over her communications device as she made her way quickly along one of the Pineapple’s many windowed corridors. She had little choice but to yell if she wanted her voice to be heard, which she did, as the alarm was incredibly loud.



She glanced through the incredibly strong and thick plexiglass of the portside window, and though she did indeed see the hotly-tipped rookie of the year kick a basket from an immensely impressive ninety-two yards, the feat did not really register. She did make a mental note, however, to watch the replay of that particular game as and when she had chance to do so.



She was two-thirds of the way along the corridor when the alarm was finally silenced, and in that moment there really was silence. However as her hearing began to normalise having been subjected to the shrill, obnoxious alarm for several more minutes than was probably good for one’s health, familiar noises such as the hum of the *Pineapple’s* core drive, the gentle buzz of the oxygen regeneration units, and the grumbling of the vessel’s heating system, registered once again.



“Right!” Ivy said, her voice still raised to its former volume. “I’m a door from the mess hall. We reckon it’s the green switch at the back left, right?”



“Right.” The reply came back over the vessel’s internal communications system. “Green switch, back left. Press and hold for five seconds and that should reset the whole thing.”



“Gotcha!”



Taking a deep breath, Ivy accessed the mess hall and instantly found that she had to squint, such was the thickness of the steam therein. Thankfully she knew exactly where she was going and could probably have made the trip across the room with her eyes closed had she been required to do so.



Though she knew the route she still took care while crossing the room, but it was not a minute later that she was able to place the palms of her hands flat upon the countertop.



The steam that filled the room was rather hot, and Ivy knew she would not be able to take much more of it. She had a job to do, however, and with that in mind she snaked her arm around the back of the machine and fumbled for a few seconds. She could only feel a single switch at the rear left, and as there really was no other option she pressed it, counting to five in her head before she released it once again.



There was a clunk, and she felt the machine vibrate gently as she withdrew her hand. Quickly she turned, and made her way back across the steam-filled room - steam that itself would now dissipate quickly. She did not speak into the comm, however, until she was out of the mess hall and back in the corridor once again.



“Alright folks, crisis over,” she said, breathing deeply of the somewhat stale air for despite the *Pineapple’s* oxygen regeneration unit being of pretty high quality, there was only so much it could do. “Coffee machine is reset, so let’s give it a few minutes for the room to clear and then it’s motherfucking lattes all around!”

My current machine is a 12 year old Delonghi Dedica. Although aluminum thermoblocks are said to not be durable, mine is. I upgraded the dedica with steamwand from Aliexpress, tamper and IMS unpressurized basket.

I’ve been eyeballing a Sage Bambino for a while now and today it’s available for just €229. But now I’m in doubt. Do I need a new one? Will it be better. I know my current machine will crap out sooner than later.

Reading the reviews on the Bambino show it’s not all rainbows and unicorns. The space between portafilter and cup is pretty high which means that it’s messy’er with coffee not dripping in the cups. And many users complain about the rattling and they have to hold the cup otherwise it would fall off the tray.

Valid concerns? And is it really an upgrade or more of a side grade? The steam wand isn’t a reason to upgrade for me.

My mate asked if I could help him move to a new flat. I figured it’d take a few hours, rent a van, shift some boxes, easy weekend favor. I showed up and realized he’s been quietly hoarding for years.

We’re talking boxes of tangled cables he’ll “definitely need someday,” broken electronics he swears he’ll fix, three coffee makers, and a plastic fishing boat he bought off Facebook Marketplace two years ago. He’s never used it, doesn’t live near water, and doesn’t fish, but apparently it was “a great deal.”

Every time I asked, Are you actually bringing this?  he had some elaborate future plan. The move took all day because we had to make multiple trips. His new place is smaller, but he refused to get rid of anything. Now it’s just as cluttered, just in a different location.

My back hurts and I’m never helping him move again. Next time I’m suddenly busy.

I ended up browsing storage hacks and shelving units online later, even skimming a few listings on alibaba,  trying to figure out how to subtly send him a hint.

1p8ok72,https://www.reddit.com/r/UmmProducts/comments/1p8ok72/which_bluetooth_keyboard_is_ideal_for_pet_owners/,Which bluetooth keyboard is ideal for pet owners?,"If you're a pet owner who works from home or spends a lot of time at your computer, you know the struggle. Your cat walks across your desk and knocks over your coffee. Your dog's tail sweeps everything onto the floor. Pet hair gets stuck between the keys. Finding the right bluetooth keyboard can make your life so much easier.

## Why Bluetooth Keyboards Work Better for Pet Owners

Regular wired keyboards create cable clutter that pets love to chew on or get tangled in. A wireless keyboard eliminates this problem completely. You can also move it around quickly when your furry friend decides your desk is their new nap spot.

## Key Features to Look For

**Easy to Clean Design** - Look for keyboards with flat keys or sealed surfaces. Crumbs, fur, and dander won't get trapped as easily. Some models even have removable keycaps that you can pop off and wash.

**Durable Construction** - Pets can be rough. Whether it's accidental drops from curious paws or direct hits from wagging tails, your keyboard needs to handle some abuse. Metal or tough plastic builds last longer than cheap alternatives.

**Spill Resistance** - Water bowls get knocked over. Accidents happen. A spill-resistant bluetooth keyboard saves you from constantly buying replacements.

**Quiet Keys** - Loud clicking can stress out some pets, especially cats and smaller animals. Membrane or scissor-switch keyboards produce less noise than mechanical ones.

**Portable and Lightweight** - Being able to quickly move your keyboard out of harm's way is crucial. Lighter models let you relocate fast when your pet decides it's playtime.

## Quick Maintenance Tips

Flip your keyboard upside down and gently shake it weekly to remove loose fur and debris. Use compressed air between keys monthly. Wipe down the surface with electronics-safe cleaning wipes regularly.

## Where to Find Your Perfect Match

You'll find plenty of options that meet these requirements. Check out this collection of [wireless keyboards designed for different needs](https://athomewave.com/bluetooth-keyboard) to see what fits your situation best.

The right keyboard makes working alongside your pets much less stressful. You won't worry as much about damage or mess. Your workspace stays functional even when your cat decides to supervise your typing or your dog's tail starts its daily sweeping routine.

## Final Thoughts

Pet ownership shouldn't mean sacrificing your tech setup. A good bluetooth keyboard designed with durability and easy cleaning in mind protects your investment while keeping your furry companions happy. Browse through some [highly-rated wireless keyboard options](https://athomewave.com/bluetooth-keyboard) and pick one that matches both your typing style and your pet's personality.

Your keyboard will thank you, and your wallet will too when you're not replacing it every few months.",1,1764313868.0,UmmProducts,0,1.0,False

Quick context:
Café Touba is roasted coffee blended with grains of Selim (Guinea pepper) and sometimes cloves. When it’s authentic, it has a warm spicy aroma, a concentrated flavour, and a very pronounced, lingering finish.

If you know any beans or blends available in Canada that offer similar aromatic complexity or strength, even if not identical, I’d appreciate suggestions.

—— or I stay in my college and graduate in december of 2026 (skip summer), and apply to a university in the state im at, but the problem here is, universities dont start till fall 2026. And i dont think my visa will allow me to stay for 8 month without school.

1p8ohir,https://www.reddit.com/r/u__CANNiBALHoRSE_/comments/1p8ohir/bigredbutton_science_fictionatompunk/,BigRedButton™ [science fiction/atompunk],"*Title*: **BigRedButton™**

*Genre*: **SciFi/Atompunk**

*Word Count*: **2465**



On Earth, because that’s where he lived, more specifically in a small village in the High Peaks of Central England, Billy was making his way home from school.



It was a long journey. The closest secondary school to that small village in the High Peaks of Central England was in Manchester, thanks to the enforced closure of hundreds of other educational establishments that would otherwise have been closer.



Those closures were apparently due to ‘*government cuts*.’ Billy did not really care though. In fact there was no *‘really*,’ about it; he simply did not care, mostly because he was eleven years old and generally, eleven year old boys don’t care about things like that but also because it was his birthday and he finally had a **NukeBord™**.



True enough it wasn’t a brand new, top of the line **NukeBord™** but Billy did not care about that, either. He knew his dad was skint as hell. After all, pretty much every penny he earned at Nukes ‘R’ Us, was used to put food on the table or send Billy to school. That was far from being his dad’s fault, of course… Even Billy at such a young, tender and impressionable age knew that it was his mother’s fault or, to use the words of his father, “That fat, rancid slag.”



The school bus pulled to the side of the road, emitting plumes of thick toxic smoke into the otherwise quite lovely, tranquil air as it did so, and Billy alighted. He was not alone in doing so, for the unofficial bus stop was the only one en route that served nine small villages, just like the one in which Billy lived, in the High Peaks of Central England.



Billy beamed as he slung his rucksack over his left shoulder and dropped the **NukeBord™** in a groundward direction though he caught it deftly, preventing the **NukeBord™** from actually hitting the ground with the use of nothing more but his own two feet.



Still beaming like an eleven year old boy who had just been given a **NukeBord™** for his birthday, Billy engaged the ‘bord’s ignition sequence, the final part of which entailed flicking the **BigRedButton™** towards the fore of the **NukeBord™** at which time an atomic reaction would take place within the **NukeBord™**’s core and, at speeds approaching three hundred and fifty miles per hour, Billy would then make his way home.



That was what was supposed to happen, of course, but what actually happened was that due to a shoddy welding job the **BigRedButton™** was not wired correctly…



Billy and his **NukeBord™** started a chain reaction that eventually (eventually, in this case, meaning a grand total of thirty seven minutes) destroyed the British Isles; wiped the region clean off the map.



That’s what having thirty-two thousand official (and several smaller, unofficial) fusion reactors on a small island archipelago in the North Atlantic will do though…





\*\*\*

  




“...and in other news the United Kingdom of Great British Nuclear Powers has been effectively wiped off the map thanks to a faulty **NukeBord™**. **NukeBord™** officials were unavailable to comment when our reporter arrived at their Adelaide offices at 0315 Earth Standard Time however their Twit-Atom feed has posted several comments since, pointing the blame firmly at **BigRedButton™** rather than there having been an issue with the **NukeBord™** itself.”

  


\*\*\*

  


“Now I know a lotta’ you gots your minds elsewhere an’ I respect that. What I respect an’ what I expect though, well those are two very different things, indeed!”



“Sir, yes Sir!”



“Good. Now I expect you all to go through each and every damn thing and I do mean everything. Computers, both networked and otherwise; weapons, ships… Fuck, check the damn coffee machine! Anything that’s got a **BigRedButton™**.”



“Sir, yes Sir!”



“‘Til I’ve got clarification that every gods damned **BigRedButton™** is safe and ain’t going to blow this space station to all hell then we’re going old school.”



“Sir, yes Sir!”



Commander Hollister, the most senior man in the Solar System although, it has to be said, not the man who was in charge, smiled, as his squad about-turned and scurried off to carry out his orders.



“Not you, Watkins,” he boomed, quietly; quietly for him, anyway. “I got something special in mind for you.”



Isabella Watkins, low-ranked though highly decorated, made her way briskly towards Hollister and snapped a smart salute as she stood before him.



“I know you had a young boy back home,” he said, actually quietly this time, and with no small amount of sympathy. “I’m truly sorry for your loss.”



“Thank you, Sir,” she replied. In truth, Watkins had been trying not to think about the fact that it was her son’s birthday and that she hadn’t been there to celebrate with him. Then again it wasn’t all bad because if she had been there, she would’ve had to spend time with her worthless piece of shit excuse for an ex husband. Well that, and the fact that if she had been there she would have been blown to shit with the rest of the United Kingdom of Great British Nuclear Powers.



She would never have said a bad word against his love for Billy or the fact that he was, in truth, a half-decent dad. She couldn’t stand the dick though; hated the guy.



“You’re good for active duty?”



“Of course, Sir,” she replied once again. “I wouldn’t have it any other way.”



“Good, ‘cause I need you in place, ready to bring in the head of **BigRedButton™** should they be proved to be at fault ‘cause if they are, someone’s going down for genocide!”

  


\*\*\*

  


Getting inside **BigRedButton™** headquarters was really rather easy. At least, it was really rather easy for a slender brunette with curves in all the right places.



Isabella could not enter in any official capacity though, for as soon as **BigRedButton™**’s private security got so much of a whiff of the Galactic Authority sniffing around they would have blown the place to high hell, no questions asked.



“I truly am so very sorry,” she purred, leaning forwards over the reception desk in a manner that very much accentuated the fact that she was, indeed, a woman, attired in a daringly low-cut dress that gathered around her waist and flowed almost exotically to a point just below her knees. “I simply can’t believe I got my interview date wrong. I mean, of all the idiotic things for a woman straight out of secretary school to do…”



Hanging upon the wall behind the desk was a large screen playing a grainy video depicting children of all ages playing with the latest and greatest **NukeBord™**. The security officer must have noticed Isabella staring at it, which she of course hoped would be the case.



“I shouldn’t do this, you know,” he said, his eyes transfixed upon the woman’s heaving cleavage, “but if you like, I could show you the prototype for the **NukeBord™** ***2.0***. I mean, I’m *acting* Head of Security, so who’s going to stop me?”



“Oh my.” She took a step back, placing the flat of her hand atop her breast. “I couldn’t ask you to do that, I mean… I wouldn’t want you to get into trouble.”



“Don’t you worry, little lady,” he replied with a smile as behind the desk he got to his feet and strode around towards her with the confidence and swagger of a man who knew, beyond all reasonable doubt, that felatio was most definitely on the cards; he had most certainly rested his testicles upon the chin of a woman for enacting deeds far less heroic and dangerous in nature.



He raised his arm, bent at the elbow, and Isabella linked her own arm through it. Then the acting Head of Security set off at a rather brisk pace, but one that she was able to match with ease despite the three-inch heels.



“You’re such a wonderful man,” said Isabella, coyly, as with a wink to the guard stood beside a heavily armoured door, a wink that the acting Head of Security thought that she did not see, he led her into a large room, entirely white, with a minimal amount of grey, clean-lined furniture. “Big, strong-willed… I do like a man who knows exactly what he wants and will do whatever he needs to do to take it.”



“What else do you like, *little lady*?” he asked, this time adding the most patronising of tones to those two otherwise innocent words.



“Oh you know, the usual things I suppose,” she replied, the expression upon her face impassive. “Making sure dinner is ready and on the table by six, ensuring my man’s every single need is taken care of…”



Sensing the acting Head of Security’s growing state of arousal, sure as he was that he was about to get some, she pivoted so that rather than standing at his side she was directly in front of him and his lazy brown eyes and half-open mouth. She was sure that it would not take much more until his tongue was quite literally hanging at the corner of his mouth but time was short and thus, she had none to waste. Isabella knew she had to wrap this up quickly.



“...but what I really like,” she continued, grabbing hold of the man’s genitals through his trousers as she squeezed incredibly firmly, “is power. It gets me so… *wet*.”



“Well, erm…” the acting Head of Security fumbled for his words, entirely due to the face that he really rather enjoyed the sensation as Isabella’s fingernails dug into his scrotum. “Erm… The, the **NukeBord™** ***2.0*** is, erm… the most powerful model yet!”



“And where is the prototype?” she purred, softly. “You want to make me a happy bunny, don’t you?”



She squeezed even tighter and the man’s eyes rolled back into his head as he nodded rigorously. 



“Mmhmm it’s over there,” he mumbled and managed to point roughly in the direction of a large set of dull metallic doors.



Isabella smiled and glanced down towards the raygun at the man’s hip.



With her grip upon the acting Head of Security’s cock and balls as firm and vice-like as ever she easily plucked the raygun from its holster and held it to his left temple. Whether he was aware of any of that she had no idea. She suspected he was enjoying what her right hand was doing far too much and she almost felt sorry for him. Almost, but not enough to convince her to do anything other than fire the weapon.



As the former acting Head of Security dropped to the floor she shuddered and hoisted her dress over her head to reveal an outfit far more suited to the task at hand; the tight and figure hugging, incredibly revealing female Galactic Authority uniform.



To finish off the ensemble she clicked the heels of her shoes together sharply and with clunky yet not uncomfortable movements, those shoes transformed into a pair of boots that extended up her shapely legs until they joined seamlessly with her booty shorts.



Several moments later, having cracked the code that opened the dull metallic doors she found herself in an underwhelmingly small room. In fact it was only really large enough for the clear glass podium upon which sat the prototype **NukeBord™** ***2.0***.



It really was a thing of beauty and by far the largest **NukeBord™** she had ever seen. Upon it, in all its bold as brass glory, was the bright and shiny **BigRedButton™** which when pressed, would set off a reaction larger than that of the first atomic bomb and allow the rider to travel at hitherto unimagined speeds.



That was not why Isabella was there though. She was not even there to find out if there was a possibility that there was something wrong at **BigRedButton™**, or whether one of their products had been faulty.



No, Isabella was there to put an end to **BigRedButton™**, and that was exactly what she was going to do. Atomic power was so unstable and therefore it would be quite simple for her to destroy the place, and the pissy little moon upon which it was situated, and simply claim that it was all an accident due to faulty equipment.



That was…



Isabella dropped to the floor as the shot hit her at the base of her spine.



The next thing she knew, apart from the fact that she was not dead and therefore whatever had hit her had probably been set to its lowest setting, was that she was handcuffed to a table in a rather swanky office with enormous windows that allowed her to see the quite beautiful landscape of Prometheus, and was sitting opposite an incredibly well dressed man. He even had a pocket square.



“How much will it take?” he asked. Isabella was still incredibly groggy though, and as such she was not sure what the man was talking about.



“For what?”



“How much will it take for you to give your superiors at the Galactic Authority a call, tell them that absolutely nothing at **BigRedButton™** is faulty and then work for me as my personal bodyguard?”



“What?” she asked, her eyebrow raised. “You’re mad!”



“That’s often been said, but everyone has their price and besides, what has the Galactic Authority ever done for you?”



Well that much was true… She had given the Authority ten years of her life. She was appreciated, sure; the medals and commendations were proof of that, but where was the promotion she knew she deserved?



“You know what..?” she asked, finally managing to break the ‘cuffs that held her to the bar hidden beneath the table. “I don’t think you’ve got enough money to buy me.”



And with that she leapt across the table, planting both feet hard to the man’s chest. Clearly he had not been expecting that. In fact, it seemed he had not been expecting any resistance from her at all, given that he was in the room alone with her.



Well he had been alone in the room with her, but that was before her two planted feet had sent him flying, backwards, through the centre pane of that enormous window.



With a shrug she took a seat and accessed the console upon the desk.



“Sir,” she said as her commanding officer answered the call. “It’s all change, here. How should I proceed?”



“You’ve found evidence of faulty **BigRedButton™**s?”



“Not exactly,” she replied. “But I did send the CEO through the window.” 



“I reckon that’ll do the job, Watkins,” he replied, chuckling. The static accompanying the call made him sound like he was dying. “Blow the shit outta’ that place an’ come on home. With **BigRedButton** outta’ the way, it’s gonna’ be a brand new day!”

1p8oh6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1p8oh6p/alright_im_curious_about_something_which_has_been/,"Alright, I'm curious about something which has been bothering me my entire life (Dreams that occur later)","First, I want to say that I'm a stranger in this paranormal world. I'm an agnostic atheist, and most of the time I ""logic"" myself out of paranormal explanations for things. But I still leave a little space in my mind for the possibility that it might be true. I've tried to find scientific explanations for what's been happening to me since I was a child, but personally think they're lacking. It makes sense, because I'd imagine getting funding for research into paranormal phenomena is harder than getting it for cancer research.

Since the age of around 8, I have detailed dreams about a very specific event, which always occurs the next day. The only exception to this rule was when I had a dream that our family cat had jumped off the balcony. He had never done such a thing until a week after I had that dream. He jumped 3 times in the span of two weeks, and didn't do it again, for the rest of his life.

There are about 30 dreams that came true that I remember. The dreams diminished after I started having frequent bouts of depression, although they still happen now in young adulthood. The most recent notable example of this was last year, where I had dreams that would happen the next day, four days in a row. First time that happened.

Mostly, my precognitive dreams have been pretty useless. But I'd say that for every ten dreams like this, four of them have helped me somehow. For example, one night I dreamt that someone at my high-school offered me drugs, and I tried them and got in trouble.

The very next day, was the first day someone at school offered me drugs. It happened exactly like it did in my dream, I was randomly approached as I walked out of the building. I remembered the dream and said no. Maybe nothing would have happened, but who knows if it would have actually caused me trouble.

A lot of the arguments against this being paranormal have to do with probability. Everyone has so many dreams each night that some of them are bound to come true. Yet, it hasn't happened to most people I've asked as much as me. And the dreams they mention are much less specific.

A good example is when I dreamt that a family friend we hadn't seen in months was at our house, wearing a blue shirt and drinking coffee. Sure enough, around noon the next day, that friend appeared, with the same shirt, and my mom made him coffee. They were also standing in the same area of the house in the dream?

So, what are the different paranormal explanations for why this happens? Also, I'd like to see if I can increase the frequency of these precognitive dreams at will. If that works, I'll have more evidence that maybe there is something paranormal going on. Or at least that whatever causes this and other experiences can be tested, but science hasn't advanced to that point. Thanks for reading.",7,1764313565.0,Paranormal,2,1.0,False

1p8o9qw,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditHorrorStories/comments/1p8o9qw/through_many_eyes/,Through Many Eyes,"Alex felt that these dreams he was having as of late had felt a little too real to him. As if he lived them himself. He wasn’t really into the whole past lives thing or reincarnation. That was until one day he woke up with scars on his body. They were surgical scars from a surgery he never remembered having.

He decided to ignore it. Maybe it had been from the impression of the blankets with how he was sleeping. Or maybe he scratched himself in his sleep. Alex made an appointment to visit a therapist. A Dr. Calhoun, who also had experience with sleep therapy. 

Upon meeting Dr. Calhoun was skeptical about Alex’s claims but became concerned upon seeing the scars.

Probably thinking that Alex was suicidal. As the nights go on and he continues to dream. They become more immersive. He was a soldier, a cultist, a mother, and a prisoner. More scars appeared on his body.

Even objects started appearing in his room. These alternate lives of his began to bleed into each other. To the point where Alex had even woken up mid-conversation one night. Some of these “Alex’s” were becoming aware of each other’s existence. A figure who appeared alongside him in these dreams was a woman named Mara.

She had been his wife, stalker, and daughter. In each different life he experienced. Mara was sometimes either hostile or affectionate towards Alex. He never knew what to expect or do when he saw her. When Alex wasn’t dreaming, he started seeing a strange figure showing up in different places.

The cafe he got his morning coffee, his place of work and in any reflective surface he looked into.

With Dr. Calhoun being of little help, he decides to do his own investigation. Discovering old hidden journals in the storage room of his apartment. A closet he hadn’t touched since moving into the place. Since he didn’t have much to begin with or reason to use the space. In one of the boxes he discovered old journals written in different styles of handwriting but were all signed with his name.

Inside the journals, the entries hinted at feeling as if they had lived this life before. It was like they had lost themselves in some type of way. Had Alex already lived this life he was in now? That was impossible, right… there was no way that it could be true. Maybe these journals belonged to *another* Alex who lived him before him.

That night, as he laid down to sleep, Alex drifted into yet another dream. Another life… though when he tried to wake up this time, it didn’t work. Days had begun to pass as he continued to live this life, panicking that he couldn’t get back. Alex began questioning if his own existence was even real. When he finally woke up from this *dream,* Alex went to talk with Dr. Calhoun, who was acting differently, calling him by different names.

Dr. Calhoun shows Alex footage of their meeting where he said and confessed things he didn’t remember saying or doing. When he left, Alex started seeing Mara in the waking world, telling him that he had *been sleeping for a long time*. He made the decision to stay awake that night to avoid slipping into a past life dream. Alex felt paranoid, seeing strangers that he didn’t know walking around his apartment. He closed his eyes, mumbling to himself that this wasn’t real.

Alex began to drift off to sleep, his eyes beginning to close. When he awoke again, Alex saw solid white walls, a door with a small window, and dim lights above him. He squinted, very confused as to where exactly he was at now. The truth was, Alex was a patient at a mental health institution for identity disorder. The records showed that he had been there for years.

Dr. Calhoun had always been his doctor, who had kept hundreds of drawings. The various lives that Alex had described. All of them were eerily detailed. When he looked at himself in a reflective surface, Alex saw Mara smiling back at him. He couldn’t tell if he was awake or living another life. 

Alex held his head in his hands, letting out a frustrated scream. Outside the room and down a long hallway is a room. A room with thousands of TVs showing each and every different patient in their rooms. Each one with a different disorder. Dr. Calhoun takes notes on Alex, typing on his laptop as he observes him.

He was the most interesting specimen in his collection and one he was determined to keep. Family had tried reaching out, but he told them that Alex was not quite ready to live in society. As he still believed that these other lives still existed. That he tried to become and act like these people. Once he was able to get this under control with a new medication, then just maybe he would release Alex into the world.

Though for now, Dr. Calhoun would keep a close eye on him.",1,1764312837.0,RedditHorrorStories,0,1.0,False

tl;dr Reconnected with friend, thought it was going somewhere, ghosted.

So a friend (31M) and I (30M) reconnected. We were really good friends in highschool and I always had a thing for him but after a few years when he graduated and moved jobs we lost touch. Within that time he came out as gay. We had reconnected about 3-4 weeks ago and we were talking almost daily. He came over once and we had a great time he didn't leave until 5 in the morning. We even cuddled just a little bit. We then started talking everyday pleasantries like good morning and good night consistently for about two weeks when communication just abruptly stopped.

The season changed and he works retail at a coffee shop and he had been saying he was really tired, overworked and couldn't get together before disappearing. His last message to me was last Monday where he said he was suffering from season depression, the death of a loved one months ago and so on, basically saying he had to get through these two months and needed time to snap back to normal. I offered care and support for him throughout this whole experience and that message on Monday was his last and it's hit me quite hard. He went completely silent and I guess I didn't interpret that to mean he was going no contact, but I guess it did...

I know I should move on I find myself getting attached too quickly and maybe I somehow pushed him away, anytime he texted I responded, perhaps too quickly? I don't know, I haven't been in a relationship in nearly 15 years. It's just left me thinking of all the ways I potentially messed things up.

1p8o71p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/1p8o71p/being_an_aware_feminist_in_the_most_misogynistic/,Being an aware feminist in the most misogynistic community in the world is HELL,"I don't know if I can fit everything in one post, 
I live in Iraq, and you don't know misogyny until you lived here, it's very very extreme. both men and women are misogynistic in every possible way.

Most of the times I wish I wasn't so aware of it, I wish I was just as uneducated as them just so I could get some relief.. 

Out of many examples is the new shia islamic law they voted for, some of its terms: 

1- A wife does not inherit her husband money or land, she only inherits what's above the land (meaning furniture and walls) the rest goes to husband brothers, parents, and children. 

2- child custody above 7 years old goes to the father. which is a huge deal because most fathers (who don't even care about their children) will forcefully take the children away just as a revenge to the mother. 

3-if a mother gets married after divorce child custody immediately goes to the father, if the fathers remarries the same rule does not apply of course (btw a divorced/widowed woman getting remarried is deeply frowned upon in the society, she is expected to stay single and care for her kids only even if she was as young is 18 year old.) 

4- A single woman's guardian is her father or brother, if she marries the guardianship goes to her husband, it means she can't travel or buy a land without their permission. 


there was a talk for setting the age of marriage for as young as 9 year old, which was very acceptable in the society btw, I made a post criticising it and calling it legalised pedophilia and I was slammed with mostly opposing comments, saying some (women) are mature at that age, and if her fathers approve then we shouldn't have a say in it. 
it's still not voted for, but it could get approved soon. 


The domestic abuse for both woman and children is at a high percentage. 
we often hear about women and children getting killed in horrible ways but there's no specific law or society disapproval

women's murder is often seen as (honour killing/shame killing) meaning she was in a relationship with guy so she's a slut now and she must be killed and the society will say she deserves it, she's seen it coming. 
which btw most husbands/fathers use this for their advantage. they could only get sentenced to 6 months in prison. 

Most women are forced to wear hijab and modest clothing, sexual harassment is very common and is justified if a woman is wearing something that isn't ""modest enough"". 


there are plenty of pages on facebook and instagram that spread woman hate and red pill content to a very extreme level, to the point that they hate the way woman wear sunglasses or hold a cup of coffee when they walk
calling them sluts and whores for the most ridiculous reasons (like applying lipstick in a public place, it's seen as asking for it?)


Feminism is not common in iraq, like I said most women are misogynistic too in a way or another, but men also make sure to tarnish the reputation of feminism, making it seem like a crazy radical movement, they use the islamic religion as a weapon and say that feminism is against the laws of quran and islam, they slut shame every feminist, which automatically repels women from educating themselves about feminism, because it's seen as taboo.  


sorry for the long post, there's still many stuff that I didn't dive into, many aspects that I didn't cover, it's really hard to describe the things that I see and go through on a daily basis.

This is my first ever post and want to share my story myself and my wife are way to embarresed to tell this story to any one so let me start at the beginning

I at that time (18M) was in collage nothing like american collage, so no crazy sex stories haha.  
So for some background I was mostly single during highschool and collage. My one friend tells me I should start messaging his ex lets call her Sarah (not her real name). The reason why I should start talking to her was to get her of his back as she was annoying him. I never saw any messages or anything annoying happaning there. In any case, their background was a bit interesting. They have been dating on and off for a very long time as their families were very close to each other.

I decided to add her on facebook just to chat as I was extremlily bored. She accepted the invite and decide lets be honest why I invited her. I told her the story we both laughed and started chatting. She was in a very Toxic relationship where he did not care and they broke up shortly after we started to talk. After alot of late night chatting on facebook and a few kingky text flying around. Odly enough we never sent Nudes to each other. We started talking about our sexuel history. Mine was null and void... I was still a virgin. She told me about the whole thing with her ex. We decided to meet up just for a One Night stand as we both had some tension.

We decided to do it that same week. We met up at my place and started talking nervoucly. This was so stressfull as I know she has had one partner and I still none till that point. There was hardly time to make coffee then we started making out and clothes when flying. She wanted to be on top and I allowed it as I had no Idea what I was doing. The condom whent on hardly 5 seconds later I blowed my load. I felt so bad and embarresed (Once again this was my first time.) She gets off we throw away the condom and I asked if I could play with her to get her to finish. She guided me in all the ways she liked it. Luckily for me I have big hand and long thin fingers. I could get to every place that she did not know she liked. I got worked up and she was getting close. We slipped on another condom and went for it again. This time I lasted 5 min I think (it felt longer). We both finished and the experience was amazing we both layed in bed and just talked. She admitted that this was her first Orgasm ever. Her ex was always forcefull and she did it to keep him happy. I felt honered with that and then she said something that I know I have a confidence issue with. She told me I was alot longer then him and he has a short and fat cock.

I felt good and great regarding that. We cleaned up went outside for a smoke. We decided we will be blocking each other as this meeting was fun but now it was over. Less then a 2 weeks later I wanted to talk to her and realized she blocked me on BBM (Blackberry Message app) I still had her number saved on my phone and decided lets see if she uses Mxit... At this point of the story your thinking Mxit BBM... YES this was almost 13 years ago.

When I Iooked on Mxit I saw to my shock she was online. I sent a message and stressed about it so much. Some background about this I was in a relationship already again but did not feel great we never had kinky time. I was bored out of my mind with that her. I was mostly thinking of Sarah.

Going back to Mxit I see the online icon and I get a reply. Stupid me never said who I was talking, as she deleted my number of her phone. We started talking I said who I was and said sorry for messaging her. She told me that she and her ex the toxic one is back together. I telll her about my current girlfriend and the reply sounded dissapointed. I was not sure what to read into with that and told her good night and played witcher 2 for probably the rest of the night.

The next morning.  
Note: I have not gone to bed. I have a bit of an addiction and over ficsation on games when they interest me.

We started talking and we met up again and again things got wild and felt wilder as we both were in a relationship. Once again she left but this time we did not block each other. We decided that that was the last time and we will only chat normally. I must say we had a spark there that no one could break.

Fast forward a week and she lets me know that she is in the hospital after a bike accident. I call her immediately she broke her arm luckily that was all. I was so panicked I got my girlfriend in the car dropped her off at her home. Sarah called me and said don't come as all her family is there and she is going in now for the opperation to get a fixater. I respected her wishes and went home. I was keeping an eye on that mxit icon the whole night till I saw it went green around 10PM. I immediately message her to find out if she is okay and got the whole story. Her ex get forcefull and wanted sex and she said no and he left her. This sort of made me happy...

Fast foward another week my girlfriend asks me to go to her dads hou to watch a movie and chill I do so and she breaks up with me. This was okay I was livid I drove 30 minutes to her dads house to get dumped. I got into my car and drove home grabbing a smoke in one hand and my phone on the other hand I call Sarah. She calmed me down while sounding sincere and happy. It was hardly 2 hours since that happened and we decided that we should be together.

We got together everything was great and awesome the sexual tension was so intence and great between us. We got married 2 years latter unfortunately. The tension broke she was on medication for arcritus that completely made her body sore and swollen. She also had no Labido. Our honeymoon was dryer then a desert.. This did not stop our love she left the medication but our sex lives has not recovered from that till to this day. We have been married for 11 years this year. We decided to try new things now from the badgirlbyble.

We have gotten good enough with this machine that my wife now refuses to go to Starbucks unless absolutely forced to when we are traveling.  She will now only drink what our daughter and I make for her.

This unit can make very good espresso, especially when paired with fresh beans from a local coffee roaster:  the crema starts coming out immediately and it looks like tan, slightly brown, honey, consistency cream. Gorgeous!

It does OK with vacuum sealed organic Lavazza beans, but those are not fresh enough for a perfect experience.  8 grind size with 14s for a double shot with those beans. 

For the local roast beans, I sent them to an 11 grind size at 12 seconds of grinding. 

For the making of the puck itself, we just press as hard as we can: comes out great!

Huge thank you to everyone here who has given me advice on this over the past year or two!

1p8o1er,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1p8o1er/i_wake_up_as_a_different_person_everyday/,I wake up as a different person everyday.,"My name is Cleo.

I have to write that down every morning. First thing. Before I check my hands to see if they’re wrinkled or smooth, before I look in the mirror to see whose face stares back, before I access the lifetime of memories that aren’t mine but are suddenly as real as my own. I find a pen, a piece of scrap paper, a napkin, a dusty windowpane—anything—and I write it. C-L-E-O.

It’s an anchor. It’s the only piece of my original life I have left. I don’t remember my face, my family, my job. I don’t know what happened to my body, the one that was born with that name. I don’t know if it’s lying in a coma somewhere, or if it just vanished. All I know is the name. And the fact that for the last—God, has it been years?—I have not been myself.

I’m writing this down because I think you need to know. I think someone needs to know that there’s… a mechanism in the world that isn’t supposed to be there. And I am its engine.

At first, it was pure, undiluted terror.

The first time it happened, I woke up tasting stale beer and regret. My head throbbed with a hangover that felt like a drill bit boring into my skull. I tried to roll over, and my body felt… wrong. Heavy. Bulky. My arms were thick with wiry hair, and when I ran a hand over my face, I felt the sandpaper rasp of a two-day-old beard.

I sat bolt upright. The room was dark, but a sliver of dawn seeped through cheap blinds. It smelled of sweat and old laundry. Beside me in the queen-sized bed, a woman sighed in her sleep, her back to me.

Panic seized me, cold and sharp. This wasn't my room. This wasn't my bed. And this most definitely was not my body.

I stumbled out of bed, my limbs clumsy and unfamiliar. I found a bathroom and flipped the light switch. The man staring back at me from the mirror was a stranger. He was in his late forties, I guessed. His hair was thinning, his face was puffy, and his eyes were bloodshot and circled with exhaustion. He wore a faded grey t-shirt and boxer shorts that strained against a soft paunch.

But the real horror wasn’t the reflection. It was the information that flooded my mind at the same time. The man’s name was Jim. He was a construction foreman. He loved the Red Sox, hated his brother-in-law, and the night before, he’d had a blistering argument with his wife, Susan—the woman in the bed—about money. I knew the intimate details of their twenty-year marriage. I knew he was afraid she was going to leave him.

I knew all of this, Jim’s entire life, but I also knew, with terrifying certainty, that I was Cleo. I had two sets of memories, two identities, wrestling for control in one skull. I clutched the porcelain sink, knuckles white, and I could feel Jim’s despair, his hopelessness. But my own panic was louder. It was a screaming siren drowning out everything else.

The woman, Susan, walked in. She didn't look at me—at Jim—with love. Her face was a mask of tired frustration.

“You’re up,” she said, her voice flat. “Coffee’s on.”

“Who are you?” I blurted out. My voice was a low gravelly thing that vibrated in a chest cavity that was far too large.

She stopped, her hand on the doorframe. “Don’t start, Jim. I’m not in the mood for your games this morning.”

“No, you don’t understand,” I pleaded, the words feeling foreign in this mouth. “I’m not Jim. My name is Cleo. I don’t know how I got here. I don’t know what’s happening.”

She stared at me. Her expression softened for a fraction of a second with something that might have been concern, before it hardened again into suspicion. “Are you still drunk? Is this about last night? You think if you act crazy I’ll forget you gambled away the mortgage payment?”

Jim’s memory provided the context, the guilt. But I didn’t care about the mortgage payment. I was a prisoner. I was a ghost.

“Please,” I begged, tears welling up in Jim’s tired eyes. “You have to believe me. I’m a woman. My name is Cleo. I woke up in here.”

That was the wrong thing to say. The last flicker of sympathy in her eyes died. She saw a man on the edge of a breakdown, trying to manipulate her. She saw Jim.

“I’m going to my sister’s for a few days,” she said, her voice like ice. “You need to get yourself together, Jim. I can’t do this anymore.”

She left. I spent the rest of the day in a fugue state. I went to Jim’s construction site, moved through the motions on pure muscle memory that I shouldn’t have had. I barked orders in his voice, I read blueprints his eyes understood. But inside, I was screaming. I tried calling a hotline, but I hung up. What would I say? “Hi, I’m a woman named Cleo trapped in a construction worker’s body?” They’d send a white van.

That night, I didn't even try to fix things with Susan. I was too consumed with my own crisis. I just collapsed into Jim’s bed, into the hollow his body had made for years, and prayed that sleep would be an escape. I prayed that I would wake up as Cleo.

I didn’t.

I woke up small. So small. The world felt enormous, the blankets a mountain range. My hands were tiny, the fingers delicate. I was in a child’s room, decorated with cheap, peeling unicorn decals. The air was thin and smelled of stale cigarette smoke and something else… something sour. Fear.

I looked in the cracked mirror on the back of the bedroom door. A little girl stared back. She couldn’t have been more than seven. She had stringy blonde hair, big blue eyes that were swimming with a sadness no child should know, and the faint, yellow-purple shadow of a bruise high on her cheekbone.

Her name was Allie. And as soon as I knew her name, I knew her secrets. I knew that the monster wasn’t under the bed; he was in the living room, passed out in his recliner. I knew why her arm ached—he’d grabbed her too hard the day before. Allie’s memories were a landscape of tiptoeing, of quiet sobs into her pillow, of a desperate, primal fear of her own father.

This time, the panic was different. The raw, selfish terror of being Cleo in Jim's body was replaced by a cold, protective rage. I remembered my failure as Jim. I’d spent the whole day trying to convince Susan I was someone else, completely ignoring the problem that was destroying Jim’s life. I wouldn't make that mistake again. I couldn't. Not for Allie.

I didn’t try to be Cleo. I had to be Allie, but an Allie with a resolve she didn't know she had.

My heart hammered in my tiny chest. I dressed Allie’s little body in jeans and a t-shirt, my borrowed fingers fumbling with the buttons. I crept out of the room. The stench of booze and smoke was stronger in the hall. In the living room, a large, unshaven man snored loudly in a stained armchair, an empty bottle of whiskey resting on the floor beside his hand. Allie’s father. Allie’s memories flinched at the sight of him, but I pushed through.

I opened the front door of the trailer as quietly as I could and slipped out into the cool morning air. The police station was on the other side of town. It was a long walk for little legs, but I walked. Every step was an act of rebellion against Allie’s fear. People in cars stared at the little girl walking alone along the highway shoulder, but no one stopped.

Finally, I saw the blue and white building. I pushed open the heavy glass doors. A woman at a high desk looked up, her expression tired.

“Can I help you, sweetie? Are you lost?”

I stood on my tiptoes to see over the counter. I used Allie’s small, wavering voice, but I filled it with all the strength I could muster.

“No,” I said, looking her right in the eye. “I’m here to report a crime.”

Her demeanor shifted instantly. She came around the desk and knelt in front of me. “Okay. What happened?”

I took a deep breath, and I told her everything. Not as Cleo, but as Allie. I used Allie's words, described her memories, her pain. I showed the policewoman the fading handprint-shaped bruise on my—on Allie’s—arm.

By the end of the day, I was sitting in a brightly lit room with a kind-faced social worker, drinking apple juice from a box. Allie’s father was in custody. Allie was safe. When I fell asleep that night on a cot in a temporary foster home, it wasn’t with the panic of the night before. It was with a profound sense of… peace. I had done something. I had helped.

The next day, I woke up as Jennifer.

Jennifer was seventeen. Her room was a collage of teenage angst—band posters on the wall, clothes piled on a chair, a half-finished essay on The Great Gatsby on her desk. The dominant emotion in Jennifer’s mind wasn’t fear or despair, but a crushing, all-consuming anxiety centered on one person: her best friend, Cynthia.

Jennifer was in love with Cynthia. Hopelessly, silently in love. Her memories were a reel of missed opportunities, of words left unspoken, of staring at Cynthia’s lips when she wasn't looking. She was terrified of telling her, certain it would ruin their friendship and end in humiliation.

I sat on the edge of her bed and felt her anxieties as my own. But from my new perspective—as Cleo, who had been a 48-year-old man and a 7-year-old girl in the last 48 hours—Jennifer's problem seemed so beautifully simple. So solvable. It wasn't about abuse or financial ruin. It was about courage.

So I borrowed some. I picked up Jennifer’s phone. My—her—hands were shaking. I found Cynthia’s number and I called her.

“Hey,” Cynthia’s cheerful voice came through the speaker. “What’s up? You’re up early.”

I took a breath. “Can you meet me? At the park by the swings. It’s important.”

An hour later, we were sitting on the old swings, the chains creaking softly. The morning was bright and crisp. I watched Cynthia talk, laughing about a stupid teacher, and I could feel Jennifer’s heart doing a frantic drum solo against her ribs.

When she paused, I stopped my swing and turned to her.

“Cynthia,” I said, using Jennifer's voice. “There’s something I have to tell you. And it might change things, and I’m so scared of that, but I can’t… I can’t not say it.”

Cynthia’s smile faded, replaced by a look of concern. “Jen, you’re scaring me. What is it?”

“I’m in love with you,” I said. The words came out in a rush, a dam breaking. “Not like a friend. More than that. And I know you probably don't feel the same way, but I had to tell you.”

Silence. It stretched for an eternity. I could feel Jennifer’s mortification rising like a fever. She wanted to run, to disappear, to rewind time.

But then Cynthia reached out and gently took my—Jennifer’s—hand. Her thumb traced circles on the back of my palm.

“Jen,” she said softly. “Why do you think I’ve been single for the last two years?”

And then she leaned in and she kissed me. It was gentle, and hesitant, and it was the most wonderful thing Jennifer had ever experienced. When I went to sleep that night, it wasn't as a terrified prisoner or a righteous rescuer. It was as a girl who had found happiness.

And that’s when I finally understood the pattern.

Every life I inhabit is at a crossroads. Every person is facing a single, defining problem that they are unable or unwilling to solve. Jim needed to face his addiction and his selfishness to save his marriage. Allie needed to speak up to save her own life. Jennifer needed a moment of courage to find love.

I was the catalyst. The solution.

That was years ago. I’ve been… a lot of people since then. Thousands, maybe. I’ve been a man dying of cancer who needed to make peace with his estranged son. I’ve been a young lawyer who needed the confidence to blow the whistle on her corrupt firm. I’ve been an old woman in a nursing home who just needed to tell her stories to someone, anyone, before they were gone forever.

I even died once. I was a detective named Frank, closing in on a killer. Frank was a good cop, but he was reckless. I walked into an ambush he should have seen coming. I remember the white-hot pain of the bullet tearing through my chest, the feeling of the world going grey and distant, the surprise, and then… nothing. Just a silent, peaceful darkness.

And then I woke up.

I was a college student named Maria, hungover after her first fraternity party. Life, it seems, goes on. My death was just a blip, a problem solved. Frank died a hero, and the evidence he’d already compiled put the killer away for life. A neat and tidy ending.

The terror is long gone. Now, there is a sense of purpose, of comfort, even. I don’t know who Cleo was anymore. Her life is a void. I often wonder what happened to her body. Was she at a crossroads, too? Was there a problem in her life so immense that the only solution was for her to… dissolve? To become a tool for others? Maybe I had to lose myself to find this calling.

So now you know. I’m out here. Every day, I wake up, I write my name down so I don’t forget the one piece of myself I have left, and then I get to work.

I’m telling you this for a reason. I see myself differently now. I’m not a victim of some cosmic anomaly. I am an intervention. A helping hand reaching out from a place you can’t see. A guardian angel, if you want to be poetic about it.

So, if you’re reading this, and your life is at a standstill. If there's a conversation you're too terrified to have, a decision you're too paralyzed to make, a path you're too scared to walk…

Maybe you should pray.

Pray for a little help. Pray for a moment of courage you don’t think you have. Pray for an angel.

And if you’re very, very lucky, I just might hear you.

Don’t be surprised if you go to sleep one night, burdened and lost, and the next morning you wake up to find your problem has been solved. The only price you’ll pay is the memory of a single, missing day. A day when I took your body for a spin.

1p8o0f5,https://i.redd.it/3abkv6y11y3g1.jpeg,After a year!,"I was dating a different girl at the time and this girl was my co-intern at the time. We bonded over books we read. And eventually we were very close. Half the college thought we were dating and honestly we weren’t. She had a problematic family, a traumatic past, she found comfort with me. We bought each other books, exchanged older books, had coffee together, she made me dinner etc and skip to graduation. 

My girlfriend (she knew about the girl in the chat, i used to tell her about her, they’ve met a couple of times) came to visit me, she bought me a new littman as a present. We hung out all day, and the next day she broke up with me for a completely different and idiotic reason. 

Later girl in the chat got close to me, she helped me through the break up. She was always there for me, checking on me, getting me food, driving me to college, etc. one day before coming back to my home city, she said she’s gonna miss me alot, so i invited her over to my place. I had some alcohol left over from grad day celebration in my cupboard, we drank together reliving all the memories of 5 years of mbbs. And we slept together and i fell asleep with her arms wrapped around me. 

Next day morning i woke up anxiety ridden, she was gone and with a note saying “call me when you’re up I’m gonna get breakfast for us” and that’s it, my heart started pumping and i recalled what had happened and packed my shit and threw them into my car trunk and wrote a note to her saying “i still have feelings for my ex and i still won’t be able to give anybody that place” and left it in her library cabinet and drove 300kms to my home city.

Later that night we spoke on the phone and she confessed that she has feelings for me, and that was the last phone call until today morning. 

I’m here still trying to get over my ex.

1p8nz1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1p8nz1p/how_do_i_go_about_handling_a_potential_supervisor/,How do I go about handling a potential supervisor position that i may not really want over someone also going for it?,"Our department normally has three supervisors who each supervise a team. There is overlap in responsibilities and has been efforts to better spread relevant knowledge across the whole department, but its basically three separate teams in one department.

One supervisor left last month, which surprised everyone since he was the obvious one to take over department when the manager retired. But the manager could be here one year or ten more years, and the former supervisor got recruited and took it. Our job requires us in office three days a week, and part of why he left was because his new job is fully remote with some travel. So just all around great get for him. I would love to be fully remote again.

I was never on that team. I have never used the technology on that team. It is similar to what I use in my role, but different in many ways. Though to be fair, basically everything is just a database and its just different databases and processes that use those databases. I have spoken both with the former supervisor (met up for coffee last week) and also the manager in a one on one. Both said that I would be a strong candidate given my general process knowledge and ability to understand the relevance of the overall data inputs to outputs at the business level. As an example, just because I understand how data flows and what matters, I asked the right people the right questions and saved the company something like a million dollars last month. The issues already cost 250k. A couple of meetings and emails and that 250k cost was cut in half, and it would have festered to probably a million dollars on the existing schedule of dealing with these things.

I see it as career progression for me. I have never managed before. The ultimate goal is to get paid enough to retire early. If I could stop working now in my 30s I would, but alas. My understanding was that I was near top of my pay scale so this is the move to make. But my coffee convo with the former supervisor revealed that individual contributors can get much higher pay scale once they hit senior level. As in, his senior engineer was being paid significantly more than he was as a supervisor, and last year he had even said that I had higher base pay than he did as a supervisor. So its a bit concerning that I could take on more responsibility without getting much more. 

Also, I know there is interest from a current member of that team. He is already on that team, already working on the technology, etc. Hes older and has more general work experience than I do. That said, I am pretty sure that I am more valuable to the business because of understanding more of the relationships between the inputs to our databases and the applications if the outputs from our databases. Ive never said to him that I am applying, but most of the department eats together in the cafeteria for lunch and he has made comments about applying and whether or not he would still come to eat with us if hes a supervisor (supervisors dont join us, usually). 

The thing is that I have already gotten feelers from a former coworker about coming to work with him. And  that job would pay more than what I would want to leave my current job, and its fully remote with occasional travel to customer sites. My wife and I have talked seriously that next year we want to move to a major city. While I was going to apply for jobs that may relocate us there anyway, if I get a fully remote job then we can relocate at our leisure.

There are other jobs that I could take on that would be fully remote and related to my experience and knowledge. I have seen the listings. And while I havent worked on the specific technology in some of the listings, its all related to what I already do anyway just with different vendors. So ultimately, I could get those jobs too, though it might be a little harder without a reference who already works at those companies.

I hit a vesting cliff in February. That is the primary reason I havent left yet. I do not forsee myself being at this company at this time next year. Ive talked with my wife about planning around a summer move, pending a relevant job acquisition that allows us to live in another city.

I will do my best during my interview next week, because in my view if I get supervisor even for a few months that is something to put on my resume. And I could explain leaving soon after getting supervisor as just a better opportunity came up.

My plan is to apply for jobs starting in January regardless so I hit my vest and get my options as soon as I can. My former coworker who reached out to me said he would get my resume to his manager ahead of HR schedules. I also met that manager specifically at a conference last year. Not that I made such an impression but my former coworker told me that they have talked about me a few times. I did tell the former supervisor about that since he had asked what I would do if I did get the supervisor job, and I have no reason to hide it from him. As soon as I said it, he said that he doesnt have any available requisition but that he would like to get me over to his new company if he could.

Im looking for input where people may have been in similar situations. 

Like, how would I handle supervising someone who also wanted the same job when they have more specific domain knowledge? Hes a nice and jovial guy, which seems like it could soften things, but ultimately I dont care about being a supervisor here long term if I can get something that allows me to live in a better quality of life elsewhere with my wife. I havent deep dived into that domain knowledge but I am pretty sure it is less complicated than what I do now. I think he would be fine as a supervisor, and if I get it for a short while then leave he would be good for it. I dont think he would leave (we are the only decent employer in town) but I do think about how would I deal with going from a cordial same level working relationship to managing someone who may feel passed over or upset at not getting the job I would get over them.

I dont ""supervise"" people at my level but I do assign some tasks to get things off my plate and train junior team members. I do a pretty good job working at my pace but the way I work is hyperproductive spurts then I fiddle with things while I think about a problem. Lots of putting my phone away when I hear steps coming then pretending. And I am apparently doing a great job anyway like that.

Then again who knows, maybe I dont end up getting the supervisor then I just vest and leave and never think about it again.",1,1764311743.0,careerguidance,2,1.0,False

But i was allergic to it and it caused me reddishness , skin peeling and then i visted dermatologist . it took me 4-5 months to just get back to normal.
And then after tat she recommended me this moisturiser - Cetaphil DAM FOR ALL SKIN TYPES” 
And tbh i never knew my skin was glowing untill my friends and even strangers started complimenting me. My frnds used to tell me if i sit under light my face reflects like glass and even few strangers asked me what i use for my skin? What cream do i use.
I have been using this moisturiser for more than 5-6 months. I have been consistent.
Im not using any sunscreen or any-other cream.
And my dr recommended me tretion for pimples (its personalised- dont try without dr consent)
And i have oily skin.
And also try applying besan flour-2-3 times a week, coffee and sugar scrub 
These are the things i have been doing constantly for 6 months this is just my personal experience. You can try if u want. Thank you. ",3,1764311627.0,women,0,1.0,False

We’re the team behind Taksim Sweets & Bakes, a small family-run Turkish coffee shop & bakery in Kanata. A few of our customers kept telling us,
“You should be on Reddit — Ottawa is very active here.”
So… here we are. 😊

If you haven’t heard of us yet, we’re a tiny spot that makes:
	•	fresh simit every morning
	•	su böreği and kol böreği from scratch
	•	mini pogaça, pastries & cookies
	•	and Turkish coffee brewed traditionally on sand

We opened not only because we missed the taste of home,
but also because we kept asking ourselves:

“How can we contribute something meaningful to the community?”

So we decided to do what we know best — baking the kind of food that’s grandmother-approved:
everything natural, simple, and made the old-fashioned way.

No shortcuts.
No unnecessary additives.
Everything we make is safe and gentle enough that many families buy our pastries for their babies and toddlers. ❤️

We don’t want to spam or advertise here.
We’re just hoping to:
	•	share behind-the-scenes bakery moments
	•	talk about Turkish food & traditions
	•	get feedback from locals
	•	and learn what Ottawa wants from a neighbourhood café

If you’ve visited us before, hi again!
If not, happy to meet you here.

Thanks for having us 🙏

I'm trying to plan a community project for my area and I'm wondering if anyone would be willing to provide some advice? I'm trying to essentially create bags with necessities for the homeless community near me. 

I was going to talk to local dentists about donating things like toothbrushes, toothpaste, and floss, and then also reaching out to local hotels about donate individual amenities like soap, shampoo, and conditioner.

I was also going to reach out to local communities for things like blankets, gloves, and drawstring bags, and then knitting scarves for each bag.

For passing out, I was going to either see if any local pizza places would donate or order a few Costco pizzas and then also have hot chocolate and coffee.

  
Is there anything else I could look into giving? I'm also trying to look into things like combs however I'm the only one working on this and financing it myself.",1,1764311135.0,communityservice,0,1.0,False
1p8nr03,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_adviceBD/comments/1p8nr03/finding_my_childhood_friend_a_little_too_much/,Finding my childhood friend a little too much attractive.,"So, basically i've known this girl since I was a newborn. My and her mom were like and still are besties since high-school, me and her were born in the same year and have went to the same institutions since we were kids. Her mom comes over to our place a few times a week and me and her hang out in my room and the same happens with my mom when she visits their place and i hang out with her. She has always been like a sister to me but after both of us hit puberty, it hasn't been the same. Both of us have had exes we both knew about and have been bestfriends through out our childhood and still are. But right now both of us are single and she has been giving me some signs like telling me to rest my head on her lap when we both hang out together in each others rooms, asking to take a sip from my straw when we go out to get soda or coffee etc. Like a couple weeks ago while these things were going on i started to dream about her, and this made me like her way more. I started to see her differently. 

I don't know what to do, Both of us have been giving signs but none of us are sure. Any tips or advice would treasured. Thanks a lot in advance.",5,1764310958.0,relationship_adviceBD,2,1.0,False
