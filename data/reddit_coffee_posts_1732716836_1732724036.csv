Let me start this off by saying that my partner of 3 years, let‚Äôs call her Hellen, has a tense relationship to her birthday. It is around thanksgiving time and her birthday has always been overshadowed by Thanksgiving. Her family historically has never asked her what she wanted to do and put some candles in pumpkin pie and called it a day. It is honestly sad to watch. 

So I make it a priority to make her birthday special and to make sure she feels celebrated. Our first birthday together I rented a cabin in her favorite mountain town and we spent a weekend there. She LOVES Disney so the next year we went to Disney for her birthday. This year we  went to Disney the weekend before her 30th birthday, we invited her whole family, her best friend and my immediate family and we had a great time. 

On the day of her actual birthday she wanted a pizza party with all her friends. Her best friend and I planned it all. We got everything she wanted, I even spent 3 hours making and decorating a cake from scratch. If you count up all the money I spent on the trip and Disney is was about 1500$. I paid for her hotel, airfare, and one of her park tickets as well as the supplies and food for the party 

Now for the conflict-Strike 1‚Ä¶the day of the party I had two drinks while I was prepping the cake and food. And while I was not sloppy drunk I was definitely the drunkest one at the party according to my partner which she didn‚Äôt like, she wanted to be the drunkest at HER party. 

Strike 2-she claims that I didn‚Äôt pay enough attention to her at the party. That I didn‚Äôt make sure she had everything she needed and that I should have sat next to her during the card game she wanted to play. My perspective was that we invited people from different friend circles who didn‚Äôt know eachother so I was trying to make sure everyone got introduced, talked when the conversation died, set up the games. made sure we sang happy birthday before the night got away with us and everyone got cake etc. 

Strike three-I made fun of the game she wanted to play. It‚Äôs a long game that is tedious and I told a couple of jokes about it. She didn‚Äôt think it was funny. Honestly I should have kept my mouth shut on that one

Strike four- I woke up later and hungover so she was sad that I didn‚Äôt pamper her in the morning. I didn‚Äôt make her coffee. I did buy her tickets to go see wicked and recruited her best friend to come with us. I ASKED her if she wouldn‚Äôt mind if I had an edible. She said she didn‚Äôt. After we got home she got really upset and said I wasn‚Äôt thinking about her and that she should not have to drive on her birthday dispite me asking if it was okay if I took an edible she was mad at me for it.

This whole situation makes me see her in a completely different light she said if she were in my shoes she would have treated me completely differently and that I was only thinking of myself. It‚Äôs making me question if I want to marry her. Am I the asshole?",1,1732723643.0,AITAH,2,0.67,False

1h17pvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h17pvo/aitah_for_not_wanting_to_make_a_keto_cake_for_the/,AITAH for not wanting to make a keto cake for the whole household for my mother's upcoming birthday.,"My (F21) mother (F49) started a keto diet bit more than a month ago. She follows a very strict eating plan and it is a very expensive eating plan.


Her birthday is coming up (early December) and I usually buy her a cake, bake cupcakes or make a sweet treat for the birthday candles to go onto (one time i made chocolate brownies because one of her friends got her a cake). But... with the keto it changes the dynamics.


One of her previous keto ""pudding"" recipes was a chocolate brownie made with feta cheese and other stuff (can't remember them all). So i told her that I'm going to have to ""spoil one of the surprises"" and asked her if her current keto plan will allow me to make the keto chocolate and feta brownies instead of a cake for HER for her birthday. 


She then told me about a keto cheesecake recipe and she would prefer the cheesecake. I looked at the recipe (4 servings) and told her that i could just half or quater the recipe and make the cheesecake for HER then. She got upset with me and said I should make it for the whole household. Keep in mind, i never agreed to making the cheesecake. She just assumed I'm making it and that I'm making it for the whole household.


Here's the thing, i have a very limited budget (i have a job but I'm saving up and still need to get her a gift as well). We are only 4 people in the household, but the keto ingredients for the cheesecake are very expensive. She is the only one in our family who is doing the keto diet. I would rather half or quater the recipe and make the cake for HER and spend more on a gift instead of allocating the gift money towards the full recipe for the rest of the family who couldn't care less about a keto cheesecake.


So i don't want to ""upset"" her by not making the keto cheesecake and it's pointless trying to discuss it with her. She already told one of her friends how nice I am for making her the keto cheesecake because i know ""how much the keto means"" to her, while i was standing in the room. 


She is one of those people who usually say ""don't get me anything, i don't really celebrate. or i don't want something fancy"" etc. and then get upset when it's not something fancy.


For her previous birthday i took her and a friend and her daughters to a clay cafe to paint ceramic dishes (something she wanted to do for quite some time) and I paid her lunch and coffees as well. We went the week before her birthday because usually people go on holiday around her birthday. On her birthday day she got super upset and said that i ""did nothing to make her day special or celebrate her"", and kept saying that for months afterwards, even though we got her cake with my stepfather and celebrated at home.

Not sure if this belongs here, but I wonder if other people have had this experience. I struggle to see myself as truly disabled due to childhood conditioning, which is shocking to a lot of people who know me and see how limited I am by my body.  
  
I was raised by a single mom who was incapable of raising a disabled child, since she could scarcely raise what she assumed to be a fully-abled one. So I had to be not-disabled so I could take care of her as much as possible. When I would get hurt and ask to see a doctor, she would get angry if I didn't have a broken bone, and all my sprains, strains, and hyperextensions were considered ploys for attention. She had this idea in her head that I enjoyed making her life harder by wasting her money for fun. It somehow never landed with her (and therefore with me) that all those injuries were real and actually needed treatment and should have been considered in the aggregate at some point.

I was declared disabled in my late 20s and granted SSDI on my first application. That fact alone should tell you that my disability was real. People who have lived with me can confirm that it's real. But still, I couldn't quite understand myself as a disabled person, because I was trained not to see myself that way. I was taught not to notice my own limitations, and to berate myself for everything I couldn't do. If I couldn't do something, I just wasn't ""trying hard enough"", see?  
  
Two decades later, I'm scrabbling to hang on to what limited functionality I have, and it's becoming obvious that not only am I truly disabled, but I have *always* been disabled. I was born like this. My physical dysfunctionality was just one of the myriad things my mom didn't - and couldn't - notice about me. For the last 10+ years I've needed surgery once a year on average. I've had four surgeries on the same foot in as many years, because it turns out that sprains don't go away if you ignore them and can eventually tear an entire foot and ankle down around them.

I told myself for years that I was a fraud; that I had scammed the system, but I was not, and I had not. I could still use my hands... until they suddenly decided to stop complying with what I asked them to do. I could still walk just fine, and then I could still walk, and then I could still walk with a lot of bracing and support, and now I can barely walk with a lot of bracing and support inside the house.  
  
It's only starting to dawn on me that I was never a fraud. The fraud was the person who brought me up and told me I was just lazy and entitled, because she couldn't see past the end of her own nose. The fraud was the able-bodied person who needed her injured 12-yo kid to bring her coffee and the paper in bed every morning, and would relax while I made my own breakfast, packed my own lunch, and got myself to school. Going NC about eight years ago gave me the space to come to terms with what's happening to my body, and the reality of how unfair this whole thing is. Sadly. the struggle to accept my physical troubles as legitimate is ongoing.

I wanted to share my recent experience hunting for the perfect patio furniture. After months of searching both online and in stores, I finally found what I was looking for, and I thought I'd save you all the hassle I went through.

I've always dreamed of creating a cozy outdoor space where I could relax, entertain friends, and enjoy my morning coffee. But finding quality outdoor furniture that doesn't break the bank can be challenging, right?

Initially, I checked local stores like Home Depot and Lowe's, but their selection was limited, and prices were pretty steep. Then I tried some boutique garden stores - beautiful stuff, but way out of my budget. That's when I stumbled upon this amazing collection: https://athometouch.com/patiofurniture

Let me tell you why I'm excited about this find. Unlike typical outdoor furniture sets that either look cheap or cost a fortune, these pieces strike the perfect balance between quality and affordability. You'll find everything from comfortable loungers and conversation sets to dining tables and storage solutions.

Some key things I learned during my search:

1. Weather-resistant materials are crucial
2. Look for UV-protected fabrics to prevent fading
3. Consider storage options for winter months
4. Check weight capacity and durability ratings
5. Read customer reviews carefully

What really impressed me about this collection was the variety of styles available. Whether you're into modern minimalist designs or classic wicker looks, there's something for everyone. Plus, most sets come with weather-resistant cushions included - a huge bonus considering how expensive those can be when bought separately.

I ended up getting a 4-piece conversation set with a loveseat, two chairs, and a coffee table. The assembly was straightforward, and the quality exceeded my expectations. My outdoor space has completely transformed, and now I find myself spending more time outside than ever.

For those interested in checking out the collection I mentioned, here's the link again: https://athometouch.com/patiofurniture

Just remember to measure your space before ordering and consider your climate conditions. Also, don't forget to factor in shipping times - you'll want to order well before the season starts to ensure you get maximum enjoyment from your new outdoor setup.

Hope this helps someone else who's in the same boat I was in! Feel free to ask any questions in the comments.",1,1732722358.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False
1h17akj,https://i.redd.it/obff79y3tg3e1.jpeg,Let's discuss Drive-thru etiquette ,"At what point is it ok to honk and give shit to someone in the drive-thru line? 

This photo was taken at 6:15pm. All I ever get is a coffee. Quick and easy. The line behind was long as we all waited for this douche bags massive order. To make matters worse, his window is broken and he has to get out at each window. 

Correct me if I'm wrong (with comments, not downvotes please) but the etiquette should be something like...

1.) When ordering for multiple people, know what it os your ordering. Don't roll up to the window with your phone ready to ramble off 8 peoples orders (seen it many times).

2.) If you have questions, go inside. I've seen many people just chatting with the speakerbox trying to figure out what's fresh or alternative options to menu items. 

3.) If your food item requires something extra. Looking at you Tims with your shitty pizzas taking 10min to cook and offering them to drive-thru customers.

1h17ai2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Scott_Savino/comments/1h17ai2/ezekiel/,Ezekiel ,"The chill from outside has infiltrated your bedroom by the time you sit up in bed. The first thing you do is climb out from beneath the covers, leaving them in a disheveled heap, and shuffle to the kitchen[.](https://scottsavino.com/ezekiel-16/) You start brewing a single-serving pumpkin-spiced cappuccino pod in your coffee maker before heading back to the bedroom to pull on your favorite sweater. It‚Äôs old, oversized, and its frayed cuffs brush softly against your wrists.

Cradling your steaming cappuccino, you step outside. Your boots crunch softly against the lightly ice-kissed porch. The first frost of the season glimmers faintly on the grass like the shattered glass of broken tears‚Äîsilvering the edges of scattered leaves and lending the yard an almost magical stillness.

You take a sip, savoring the warmth, and lean against the porch railing. It‚Äôs quiet, the kind of morning that feels untouched by time‚Äîuntil you spot it.

The turkey stands at the far edge of the yard, its dark, hulking form is outlined by the weak morning sun. It stares back at you. It doesn‚Äôt move, doesn‚Äôt blink, only stares. For a moment, your eyes are locked with its tiny black ones, and then, on a whim, you call out:

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù

The turkey‚Äôs head jerks up, but it isn‚Äôt startled. Oddly, it seems to crane its neck toward you, as if it‚Äôs listening. Without missing a beat, you pitch your voice into a high, cracking falsetto, the way some people give voices to their dogs:

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù you reply for it.

You grin, rolling with the lines: ‚ÄúGuess what?!‚Äù

In that same, exaggerated voice, you answer for it: ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou really wanna know?‚Äù

‚ÄúYesss!‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck you!‚Äù You tell the bird.

‚ÄúFuck you!‚Äù It replies.

‚ÄúNo, fuck you!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?!‚Äù you imagine the turkey asking.

‚ÄúTony!‚Äù you call back.

‚ÄúFuck you, Tony!‚Äù

‚Äú*Fuck you!*‚Äù You respond, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs *your name?!‚Äù*

‚ÄúEzekiel!‚Äù

You squint at the bird, your grin widening as you hold back a laugh at how stupid you‚Äôre being, doing this on a Tuesday morning in your yard at the edge of the forest. ‚ÄúEzekiel?! That name fuckin‚Äô *sucks!‚Äù*

The turkey doesn‚Äôt flinch. It doesn‚Äôt react at all, and somehow that makes the whole thing funnier. You‚Äôre still laughing when a second turkey ambles out from behind the oak tree‚Äîthis one smaller and scruffier. It immediately starts pecking at the frosted grass like it‚Äôs on a mission.

‚ÄúOh great,‚Äù you say, gesturing with your coffee mug. ‚ÄúEzekiel brought backup.‚Äù

The smaller turkey ignores you entirely, too busy tearing into the ground, but Ezekiel stays still. His head is still tilted toward you, ever so slightly, his black eyes locked on yours from a hundred yards away.

You take another sip of your cappuccino, still grinning. ‚ÄúAlright, Ezekiel. Let‚Äôs see what you and your sidekick think of birdseed.‚Äù

You head to the steel feed barrel where you keep seed for the bird feeders. There‚Äôs been little point in refilling them these past two weeks, as the cold has driven most of the birds south. Scooping out a heaping helping of seed, you set your coffee on the porch handrail and step cautiously into the yard.

As you approach, the birds begin to retreat. The smaller one turns its back completely, sprinting into the dense underbrush, but Ezekiel backs away slowly, his beady eyes never leaving you. When you reach the spot where he first stood, you spread the seed on the ground for him and his scruffy friend.

Walking back toward the house, you hear your phone ringing from the counter in the kitchen. Scratching at the stubble on your chin, you grab your coffee from the railing and slide the kitchen door open, stepping inside.

The warmth of the house greets you as you cross the linoleum, careful not to spill your cappuccino as you move quickly to the counter. Your phone sits where you left it, ringing insistently, the screen lighting up with a name you haven‚Äôt seen in quite some time: *Mom.*

You sigh, swiping the screen to deny the call. The ringtone cuts off, but before you can set the phone down, the voicemail notification pings. You hesitate, staring at it for a moment before pressing play.

Her voice is the same as always‚Äîcalm, clipped, careful. ‚ÄúHi,‚Äù she begins, but then pauses. The silence stretches long enough for you to pull the phone from your ear and glance at the screen to check if the call has ended. It hasn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúListen. It‚Äôs been years since you‚Äôve come home for Thanksgiving, Tonya, and‚Äî‚Äù

Your jaw tightens, and you don‚Äôt let her finish. With irritation curling hot in your chest, you press 7, deleting the message mid-sentence. Setting the phone back on the counter, you shake your head and mutter, ‚ÄúEven Ezekiel wouldn‚Äôt have started the message like that, Mom, and he‚Äôs a fucking turkey that doesn‚Äôt know any better.‚Äù

The thought almost makes you laugh, but the edge lingers. You take another sip of coffee, exhaling sharply through your nose as you look out the kitchen window.

Neither turkey has returned to the yard, but you see Ezekiel standing at the edge of the forest, still watching.

‚ÄúStrange fuckin‚Äô bird,‚Äù you mutter.

By lunchtime, the sun has risen higher, melting just enough of the morning‚Äôs jagged, icy sheen to blunt the sharp, shattered edges of the yard‚Äôs glass-like surface. The thaw hasn‚Äôt softened it entirely; the grass still glints with reflective fractures, catching the light like fresh cracks spreading through a brittle mirror.

You toss together a quick sandwich‚Äîpeanut butter and banana on slightly stale bread, because the thought of braving Rife‚Äôs Market in the center of Bradenville today feels like a battle not worth fighting‚Äîand step outside with it in hand.

Ezekiel is still there.

He stands near the edge of the yard. Before you came outside, he was strutting and pecking at the ground, but now that you‚Äôve settled into your chair, balancing the plate on your knee, he‚Äôs gone completely still. His head tilts ever so slightly, as though he‚Äôs listening to something only he can hear.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre persistent, I‚Äôll give you that,‚Äù you say, taking a bite of your sandwich. ‚ÄúMaybe that‚Äôs what I like about you. You stick around. Don‚Äôt care what anyone thinks.‚Äù

You laugh softly to yourself, brushing crumbs off your lap, ‚ÄúNot like Patty Filmore at the grocery store the week before last. She was going on about how Deke Coffee up the road has some kind of glowing-blue-eyed kid with a squid in its mouth locked in his basement. Can you believe that? A watery-blue-eyed child. With a squid. In its mouth.‚Äù

You pause, staring out at Ezekiel as if he might offer some kind of insight, but he just stands there, still as ever, with his beady black eyes locked onto yours.

‚ÄúI mean, she said it had a beak inside its throat and everything,‚Äù you continue, grinning. ‚ÄúClaimed it clicked when the kid talked. Imagine that, Ezekiel. Little squid beak clicks every time it says something. ‚ÄòHi! My name‚Äôs Squid Kid, nice to meet you,‚Äô click-click-click. What the hell‚Äôs wrong with this town?‚Äù

You pitch your voice higher, giving Ezekiel his personality again: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, Tony. I think Patty‚Äôs onto something. Maybe you should check it out.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, sure,‚Äù you reply, rolling your eyes as if the conversation were real. ‚Äú‚ÄòScuse me, Mr. Deke. Hi, sorry‚Ä¶ just wondering if you‚Äôve got some kind of cephalopod child down there in your basement? Heard you did.‚Äô That won‚Äôt get me banned from another town meeting or anything. Bad enough Pastor Thomas‚Äôs wife runs all of them.‚Äù

Ezekiel doesn‚Äôt move. Doesn‚Äôt blink.

‚ÄúBesides,‚Äù you add, finishing your sandwich, ‚Äúeven if there was some creepy squid kid in Deke Coffee‚Äôs basement, he‚Äôd be more apt to shoot me with his shotgun than invite me inside to see it. I‚Äôm kind of the pariah around here currently. Not exactly neighbor of the year.‚Äù

You glance at Ezekiel, narrowing your eyes thoughtfully. ‚ÄúBut you?! You‚Äôve got that whole enigmatic, loner vibe going. Maybe he‚Äôd let you inside. Give you the VIP tour.‚Äù

In your imagined falsetto, Ezekiel replies: ‚ÄúTony, I‚Äôm just a turkey. We‚Äôre not really into squid kids.‚Äù

That makes you laugh. ‚ÄúAlright, fine. Fair point.‚Äù

Satisfied with the conversation, you stand and stretch, brushing crumbs off your jeans. Ezekiel doesn‚Äôt move as you go back inside, closing the kitchen door firmly behind you.

Your office is just down the hall, the glow of the computer monitor greeting you as you settle into your desk chair. Logging in, you glance at the list of emails waiting in your inbox. The day‚Äôs tasks loom large, but it‚Äôs your last workday before the long weekend, and you‚Äôre determined to finish everything.

The first email is straightforward, the kind of quick reply that makes you feel productive. The second is a little more complicated, and you lose yourself in the rhythm of typing, tweaking, and sending.

But every so often, your eyes drift to the office window.

Ezekiel is still there.

He doesn‚Äôt pace or wander like other birds. He doesn‚Äôt peck at the ground or strut about. Not anymore. He just‚Ä¶stands. Watching.

At first, you shrug it off, muttering, ‚ÄúWeirdo.‚Äù But by the fifth glance, it‚Äôs harder to ignore the tension curling in your stomach. He hasn‚Äôt moved. Not an inch.

The minutes drag on, and the weight of his stare presses on you like an invisible hand, heavy and persistent. By late afternoon, the sight of him has gone from amusing to unsettling.

When the sun begins its slow descent and shadows stretch long across the yard, you decide to logout for the day. Everything else can wait until next Monday. You head outside to bring in the empty trash can from the curb, glancing nervously toward the woods. The yard is quiet, almost too quiet. You half-expect to see him there, standing in the same spot, but it‚Äôs empty now‚Äîthe edge of the forest cloaked in shadows.

You exhale slowly, trying to shake off the unease. It‚Äôs just a turkey, you remind yourself. A weird turkey, sure, but a turkey nonetheless.

Still, when you step back inside, you make a point of locking the kitchen door behind you. The sound of the bolt sliding into place feels louder than it should, echoing in the stillness of the house.

You glance out the window one last time, but the yard is empty. 

Or at least, it looks empty.

Wednesday morning greets you with the kind of chill that sneaks into your bones before you‚Äôve even had your first cup of coffee. Pulling your sweater over your head, you step onto the porch, warm drink in hand, and pause mid-sip.

Ezekiel is there.

He stands in nearly the same spot as yesterday, closer to the house this time, his dark shape distinct against the muted backdrop of the waking woods. His outline looks sharper in the morning light, every ridge of his feathers catching faint shadows, giving his form an almost jagged appearance. His head tilts slightly, a deliberate, inquisitive motion, as though he‚Äôs greeting you‚Äîor sizing you up. You sigh, rolling your eyes. ‚ÄúMorning, Ezekiel.‚Äù

The turkey doesn‚Äôt respond, of course, but you don‚Äôt need him to. You take another sip and lean against the railing, letting the steam from your mug rise to warm your face.

‚ÄúYou know, I was thinking about Peony last night,‚Äù you say, your voice soft and distant, like you‚Äôre talking more to yourself than him. ‚ÄúPeony McIntyre. We went to school together. She always had these little yellow ribbons tied into her hair. They were bright, like sunlight.‚Äù You pause, rubbing the back of your neck. ‚ÄúI had the biggest crush on her. Never said a word about it, of course. Why would I? Just got to watch her from a distance, all perfect and glowing like she belonged in some storybook.‚Äù

You glance at Ezekiel, his beady black eyes still locked on yours. ‚ÄúGuess that makes me the fool, huh? Standing around pining after someone who never even looked my way. Ah well, doesn‚Äôt matter now.‚Äù

Ezekiel doesn‚Äôt respond.

‚ÄúYou got a girl from a storybook, dumb bird?‚Äù 

In the bird‚Äôs voice, you respond: ‚ÄúStorybook? Yellow ribbons I understand, but storybooks? What‚Äôs that?‚Äù

‚ÄúNevermind,‚Äù you tell him, shaking your head at the ridiculousness of what you‚Äôre doing. Straightening up, you shout: ‚ÄúAlright, wish me luck, Ezekiel. Gotta go into town, pick up some supplies, and avoid anyone who‚Äôs gonna make a scene. You know how it is‚Äîalways someone with something to say.‚Äù

The drive into Bradenville is uneventful, save for the rumble of your old Chevy truck on the road. The heater wheezes faintly as it fights to warm the cabin, and the radio crackles with static. You‚Äôre grateful for the quiet, though. It gives you a moment to steel yourself for any potential encounters.

At Tractor Supply, the air smells of feed and motor oil, the faint twang of something sang by Lee Ann Womack is playing over the speakers. You head straight for the feed aisle, scanning the neatly stacked bags until you find the one you‚Äôre looking for: a 25-pound bag of turkey meal, forest green with cheerful photos of turkeys printed across the front. Hefting it onto your shoulder, you carry it to the register.

As you punch your PIN into the keypad, you hear her voice.

‚ÄúTon‚ÄîI mean, Tony. Tony! Oh my sweet goodness, I thought that was you. My, do you look different.‚Äù

You glance up to see Mrs. Thomas, the pastor‚Äôs wife, standing behind you, her hands clasped tightly over her purse, her smile just a little too forced.

‚ÄúHello, Mrs. Thomas,‚Äù you say evenly, focusing on the screen.

‚ÄúYour momma told me she‚Äôs been trying to reach you, and‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúMy ‚Äòmomma,‚Äô‚Äù you interrupt, keeping your tone calm but firm, ‚Äúknows what needs to be done if she wants to mend things. That‚Äôs between her and me. And frankly, Mrs. Thomas, I think you know as well as I do that pretending to respect me isn‚Äôt the same as actually doing it. Now, if you‚Äôll excuse me, I‚Äôve got a lot to get done today.‚Äù

Mrs. Thomas blinks, her smile faltering for just a moment before it snaps back into place. ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù she says, her voice tight, ‚Äúyou have a Happy Thanksgiving, Tony.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou too,‚Äù you reply curtly, taking your receipt and bag.

Outside, the cold air bites at your face as you toss the bag into the bed of your truck. Climbing into the driver‚Äôs seat, you mutter, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing this for you, Ezekiel. Hope you appreciate the gesture.‚Äù

By the time you get home, the sun is already dipping low, its light golden and soft against the trees. Ezekiel is still in the yard, standing exactly where you left him that morning.

*‚ÄúSo fuckin‚Äô odd, this bird.‚Äù* You mutter to yourself, slamming the truck‚Äôs stubborn rusty-hinged door.

You haul the heavy bag inside, setting it on the kitchen island before stepping out and grabbing the scoop of birdseed you keep in the bin for the feeders. Stepping cautiously out into the yard, you approach him.

This time, Ezekiel doesn‚Äôt back away. He watches you intently, his head cocked, his stillness unnerving. You stop a few feet away, bending down to spread the seed across the ground in front of him.

‚ÄúThere you go,‚Äù you say softly. ‚ÄúUmm‚Äîsomething to tide you over until tomorrow, I guess...‚Äù

His eyes never leave yours, their black, glossy surface unreadable.

You straighten, the hair on the back of your neck prickling as you take a step back. Then another. Ezekiel doesn‚Äôt move. He doesn‚Äôt eat.

‚ÄúGoodnight, then, you freaky fucker.‚Äù

Back inside, you lock the kitchen door, twisting the deadbolt with more force than necessary. Leaning against the counter, you rub at your arms, trying to shake the lingering unease.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not friendly,‚Äù you murmur to yourself. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not menacing, either. Just‚Ä¶it‚Äôs just a weird turkey. That‚Äôs all.‚Äù

It‚Äôs sometime after three in the morning when you find yourself curiously staring out from your bedroom window. The yard is bathed in pale moonlight, the frost glittering like shards of glass on the grass below. At first, the scene feels serene, even beautiful. But then you see him.

Ezekiel stands alone, in his usual spot.

He is a lone shadow perched unnaturally still in the center of the backyard, his silhouette sharp yet distorted in the faint silver glow. His body seems too large for a turkey, the curve of his back arched high, his head angled unnervingly low, like a predator lying in wait. The feathers along his wings and back gleam faintly, catching the moonlight in thin, metallic slivers, as though the bird were made of something far denser than flesh and bone.

Something feels‚Ä¶ off. What is that strange shimmer around his edges, as though he isn‚Äôt entirely solid? You rub your eyes, but the shimmer doesn‚Äôt go away.

Then he moves.

No‚Äînot moves. He *ripples.*

And it begins.

At first, it‚Äôs just a faint quiver in his chest, like a bird shaking off water. But the trembling grows more violent, the body contorting unnaturally. And then, without a sound, he *tears* in two.

A second turkey emerges, identical to the first. The process is smooth, disturbingly clean, like the turkey is replicating itself cell by cell. A shudder runs down your spine as you remember those old high-school biology videos of mitosis, where a single cell splits in two. Only this time, the single cell is a fully-formed turkey, and it isn‚Äôt stopping.

The two turkeys ripple and divide into four. The four become eight. The eight become sixteen. The multiplication accelerates until the yard is overrun, a heaving, pulsating mass of identical birds. They‚Äôre all smaller than he is at first, their forms shimmering and flickering, as if they aren‚Äôt entirely solid‚Äîthen they grow slowly larger to match his size and become opaque, and then they split. They split. And they split. 

And split again.

Each one stares directly at your window. Their eyes glow like gas stove flames, blue and quavering, flickering faintly in the darkness.

You try to back away, but your legs refuse to move. The turkeys continue to split, each one an exact replica, their beaks sharp and glinting in the moonlight. The yard is no longer visible‚Äîjust an endless sea of multiplying bodies, their rippling forms shimmering grotesquely as they grow in number.

Then Ezekiel, the *original* Ezekiel, looks at you.

But they‚Äôre all the same bird‚Äîcopies. *They‚Äôre all Ezekiel,* you realize.

And Ezekiel steps forward.

He moves unnaturally smoothly, as though gliding rather than walking, and the others follow in perfect synchronization. They reach the base of the house and begin to climb, their claws scraping against the siding. You can hear them now, a relentless scratching that grows louder and louder, drowning out your breathless gasps.

One of them reaches the window. Is it the *original* Ezekiel or a copy? You can‚Äôt be sure. Does it matter? Its glowing blue, burning eyes are inches from yours, staring into you. Its beak taps the glass once. Twice as if trying to break through. The glass seems to flex with each peck‚Ä¶

And then it lunges‚Äî

You gasp and sit bolt upright, your chest heaving. But you‚Äôre not in bed‚Äîyou‚Äôre on the floor next to the window. Your right hand is gripping the sill so tightly your knuckles ache. The morning sun streams through the glass, warm and golden, erasing the nightmare‚Äôs suffocating shadows. The yard is empty, blanketed in frost and light.

You let out a shaky laugh, the tension in your chest unraveling all at once. ‚ÄúWhat the hell,‚Äù you mutter, rubbing your temples with trembling fingers. ‚ÄúPull yourself together.‚Äù

Then a shadow moves across the window, just below the frame.

You freeze. Slowly, you lean closer, and a head rises into view.

Ezekiel.

Its black eyes lock onto yours, its head tilting the way it always does. You yelp, a sharp bark of fear that quickly melts into nervous laughter. ‚ÄúDamn it, dude, you scared me!‚Äù you say, pressing a hand to your chest. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre early. Couldn‚Äôt wait for your seed, huh? I uh‚ÄîI got something else for you today‚Äîsomething, uh‚Äîsomething better? I think.‚Äù

He doesn‚Äôt move. Doesn‚Äôt blink. He just stares, and for a fleeting moment, you could swear he‚Äôs smiling.

You step outside, the cool air brushing against your face, and heft the bag of feed from the kitchen island onto your shoulder. The weight settles awkwardly, but manageable, as you move toward the porch. Ezekiel‚Äôs dark form is already waiting in the yard, his stillness more expectant than before.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre one demanding bird, you know that?‚Äù you say, your voice light with a chuckle as you descend the porch steps. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got your Thanksgiving dinner right here, buddy.‚Äù

As you make your way toward him, Ezekiel moves‚Äîsomething he hasn‚Äôt done in days. He steps back, just one step at first, his head tilting sharply toward the woods. You pause mid-step, frowning. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this, huh? You‚Äôre not getting cold feet now, are you?‚Äù

Ezekiel doesn‚Äôt respond, of course. Instead, he backs away further, the motion deliberate, his eyes locked on you as if beckoning. Then, with startling speed, he turns and rushes toward the tree line. He doesn‚Äôt disappear completely‚Äîjust enough to be swallowed by the dense undergrowth, where he pauses, his head snapping back to look at you.

You hesitate, shifting the weight of the bag on your shoulder. ‚ÄúYou want me to follow you?‚Äù you mutter, half to yourself.

Ezekiel jerks his head forward, urging you on.

Something tugs at you‚Äîcuriosity, maybe, or something deeper and more instinctual. You step cautiously toward the woods. The branches sway slightly in the faint breeze, and they brush against your sweater as you push through them, grabbing at you like dozens of skeletal hands. The forest smells damp, earthy, and faintly of petrichor‚Äîthe morning's frosty dew soaked into the soil. Patches of light filter through the tangled canopy, casting patterns on the ground that shift like the reflections from a broken mirror, high in the sky.

‚ÄúAlright, Ezekiel,‚Äù you call, your voice muffled by the trees. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre leading me to your weird turkey cult or something, I‚Äôm gonna be real upset‚Äîprobably.‚Äù

The turkey doesn‚Äôt stop, darting between the trees with an unnerving ease. You try to keep up, your boots crunching over brittle twigs and dead leaves, the occasional vine tugging at your ankle. The air feels heavier the further you go, like the weight of the forest itself is pressing down on you. Sunlight grows scarce, swallowed by the towering pines and gnarled oaks. Their branches are interlocking like the ribs of a great beast, still sleeping this early in the morning.

Then you see it.

A clearing opens before you, bathed in pale, golden light. The trees around it stand unnaturally still, their rough trunks covered in patches of something dark and oily, gleaming faintly in the sun. The ground here is strangely bare‚Äîno leaves, no grass‚Äîjust smooth, dark soil that looks as though it‚Äôs been tilled by unseen hands. Ezekiel stands at the center with his friend from the other morning pecking the ground behind him. Ezekiel himself is motionless‚Ä¶his form sharp and imposing against the eerie stillness.

You step forward, the bag of feed shifting awkwardly as you cross the threshold into the clearing. Something about the air here feels alive, charged with a quiet energy that makes your skin prickle. You set the bag down and kneel, fumbling with the corner to tear it open. Ezekiel doesn‚Äôt move. He doesn‚Äôt even blink.

‚ÄúAh. I see. Brought me to your friend,‚Äù you say, forcing a laugh to steady your nerves. ‚ÄúHope you‚Äôre both hungry. Got enough here for plenty‚Äîmore than just the two of you, but it‚Äôs all yours, I guess.‚Äù

As you pour the feed onto the ground, the sound seems unnaturally loud in the silence. You glance up at Ezekiel, expecting him to move, to peck at the dried, ground cornmeal, but he remains perfectly still. His head tilts ever so slightly, his black eyes boring into yours.

You step back, brushing your hands off on your jeans. ‚ÄúI hope you guys like it,‚Äù you say, smiling. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to give back sometimes, you know?‚Äù

The turkey tilts its head. It seems to rise up onto its talons, growing taller‚Äîbigger‚Äîuntil its beady black eyes are level with yours.

For the first time, it speaks‚Äînot the friendly, imagined voice you‚Äôve been projecting onto it for days, but something low, guttural, and undeniably real.

‚ÄúHush,‚Äù it says.

*‚ÄúWhat?!‚Äù* you exclaim in terror. ‚Äú*You‚Äîyou don‚Äôt talk! You say ‚Äògobble gobble!‚Äô‚Äù*

‚ÄúGobble gobble?‚Äù Ezekiel scoffs. *‚ÄúWhat kind of stereotypical?‚Äîforget it.* You know what? Shut the fuck up. Do that. My family and I prefer our meals quiet. Can you manage that? Can you shut the fuck up? You talk so fuckin‚Äô much.‚Äù

A rustling rises from the woods. You turn, just in time to see them‚Äîthe turkeys, dozens of them, their shadows swarming closer. They emerge from the trees with synchronized precision, their bodies glinting faintly in the shifting light.

You don‚Äôt even have time to scream before the first beak strikes, sharp and relentless, puncturing your eye with a wet crunch. Pain blinds you as another tears into your cheek, then your throat, the frenzy consuming you piece by piece and the sounds of the world fade to silence as your vision goes dark.

The chill from outside has infiltrated your bedroom by the time you sit up in bed. The first thing you do is climb out from beneath the covers, leaving them in a disheveled heap, and shuffle to the kitchen[.](https://scottsavino.com/ezekiel-16/) You start brewing a single-serving pumpkin-spiced cappuccino pod in your coffee maker before heading back to the bedroom to pull on your favorite sweater. It‚Äôs old, oversized, and its frayed cuffs brush softly against your wrists.

Cradling your steaming cappuccino, you step outside. Your boots crunch softly against the lightly ice-kissed porch. The first frost of the season glimmers faintly on the grass like the shattered glass of broken tears‚Äîsilvering the edges of scattered leaves and lending the yard an almost magical stillness.

You take a sip, savoring the warmth, and lean against the porch railing. It‚Äôs quiet, the kind of morning that feels untouched by time‚Äîuntil you spot it.

The turkey stands at the far edge of the yard, its dark, hulking form is outlined by the weak morning sun. It stares back at you. It doesn‚Äôt move, doesn‚Äôt blink, only stares. For a moment, your eyes are locked with its tiny black ones, and then, on a whim, you call out:

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù

The turkey‚Äôs head jerks up, but it isn‚Äôt startled. Oddly, it seems to crane its neck toward you, as if it‚Äôs listening. Without missing a beat, you pitch your voice into a high, cracking falsetto, the way some people give voices to their dogs:

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù you reply for it.

You grin, rolling with the lines: ‚ÄúGuess what?!‚Äù

In that same, exaggerated voice, you answer for it: ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou really wanna know?‚Äù

‚ÄúYesss!‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck you!‚Äù You tell the bird.

‚ÄúFuck you!‚Äù It replies.

‚ÄúNo, fuck you!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?!‚Äù you imagine the turkey asking.

‚ÄúTony!‚Äù you call back.

‚ÄúFuck you, Tony!‚Äù

‚Äú*Fuck you!*‚Äù You respond, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs *your name?!‚Äù*

‚ÄúEzekiel!‚Äù

You squint at the bird, your grin widening as you hold back a laugh at how stupid you‚Äôre being, doing this on a Tuesday morning in your yard at the edge of the forest. ‚ÄúEzekiel?! That name fuckin‚Äô *sucks!‚Äù*

The turkey doesn‚Äôt flinch. It doesn‚Äôt react at all, and somehow that makes the whole thing funnier. You‚Äôre still laughing when a second turkey ambles out from behind the oak tree‚Äîthis one smaller and scruffier. It immediately starts pecking at the frosted grass like it‚Äôs on a mission.

‚ÄúOh great,‚Äù you say, gesturing with your coffee mug. ‚ÄúEzekiel brought backup.‚Äù

The smaller turkey ignores you entirely, too busy tearing into the ground, but Ezekiel stays still. His head is still tilted toward you, ever so slightly, his black eyes locked on yours from a hundred yards away.

You take another sip of your cappuccino, still grinning. ‚ÄúAlright, Ezekiel. Let‚Äôs see what you and your sidekick think of birdseed.‚Äù

You head to the steel feed barrel where you keep seed for the bird feeders. There‚Äôs been little point in refilling them these past two weeks, as the cold has driven most of the birds south. Scooping out a heaping helping of seed, you set your coffee on the porch handrail and step cautiously into the yard.

As you approach, the birds begin to retreat. The smaller one turns its back completely, sprinting into the dense underbrush, but Ezekiel backs away slowly, his beady eyes never leaving you. When you reach the spot where he first stood, you spread the seed on the ground for him and his scruffy friend.

Walking back toward the house, you hear your phone ringing from the counter in the kitchen. Scratching at the stubble on your chin, you grab your coffee from the railing and slide the kitchen door open, stepping inside.

The warmth of the house greets you as you cross the linoleum, careful not to spill your cappuccino as you move quickly to the counter. Your phone sits where you left it, ringing insistently, the screen lighting up with a name you haven‚Äôt seen in quite some time: *Mom.*

You sigh, swiping the screen to deny the call. The ringtone cuts off, but before you can set the phone down, the voicemail notification pings. You hesitate, staring at it for a moment before pressing play.

Her voice is the same as always‚Äîcalm, clipped, careful. ‚ÄúHi,‚Äù she begins, but then pauses. The silence stretches long enough for you to pull the phone from your ear and glance at the screen to check if the call has ended. It hasn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúListen. It‚Äôs been years since you‚Äôve come home for Thanksgiving, Tonya, and‚Äî‚Äù

Your jaw tightens, and you don‚Äôt let her finish. With irritation curling hot in your chest, you press 7, deleting the message mid-sentence. Setting the phone back on the counter, you shake your head and mutter, ‚ÄúEven Ezekiel wouldn‚Äôt have started the message like that, Mom, and he‚Äôs a fucking turkey that doesn‚Äôt know any better.‚Äù

The thought almost makes you laugh, but the edge lingers. You take another sip of coffee, exhaling sharply through your nose as you look out the kitchen window.

Neither turkey has returned to the yard, but you see Ezekiel standing at the edge of the forest, still watching.

‚ÄúStrange fuckin‚Äô bird,‚Äù you mutter.

By lunchtime, the sun has risen higher, melting just enough of the morning‚Äôs jagged, icy sheen to blunt the sharp, shattered edges of the yard‚Äôs glass-like surface. The thaw hasn‚Äôt softened it entirely; the grass still glints with reflective fractures, catching the light like fresh cracks spreading through a brittle mirror.

You toss together a quick sandwich‚Äîpeanut butter and banana on slightly stale bread, because the thought of braving Rife‚Äôs Market in the center of Bradenville today feels like a battle not worth fighting‚Äîand step outside with it in hand.

Ezekiel is still there.

He stands near the edge of the yard. Before you came outside, he was strutting and pecking at the ground, but now that you‚Äôve settled into your chair, balancing the plate on your knee, he‚Äôs gone completely still. His head tilts ever so slightly, as though he‚Äôs listening to something only he can hear.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre persistent, I‚Äôll give you that,‚Äù you say, taking a bite of your sandwich. ‚ÄúMaybe that‚Äôs what I like about you. You stick around. Don‚Äôt care what anyone thinks.‚Äù

You laugh softly to yourself, brushing crumbs off your lap, ‚ÄúNot like Patty Filmore at the grocery store the week before last. She was going on about how Deke Coffee up the road has some kind of glowing-blue-eyed kid with a squid in its mouth locked in his basement. Can you believe that? A watery-blue-eyed child. With a squid. In its mouth.‚Äù

You pause, staring out at Ezekiel as if he might offer some kind of insight, but he just stands there, still as ever, with his beady black eyes locked onto yours.

‚ÄúI mean, she said it had a beak inside its throat and everything,‚Äù you continue, grinning. ‚ÄúClaimed it clicked when the kid talked. Imagine that, Ezekiel. Little squid beak clicks every time it says something. ‚ÄòHi! My name‚Äôs Squid Kid, nice to meet you,‚Äô click-click-click. What the hell‚Äôs wrong with this town?‚Äù

You pitch your voice higher, giving Ezekiel his personality again: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, Tony. I think Patty‚Äôs onto something. Maybe you should check it out.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, sure,‚Äù you reply, rolling your eyes as if the conversation were real. ‚Äú‚ÄòScuse me, Mr. Deke. Hi, sorry‚Ä¶ just wondering if you‚Äôve got some kind of cephalopod child down there in your basement? Heard you did.‚Äô That won‚Äôt get me banned from another town meeting or anything. Bad enough Pastor Thomas‚Äôs wife runs all of them.‚Äù

Ezekiel doesn‚Äôt move. Doesn‚Äôt blink.

‚ÄúBesides,‚Äù you add, finishing your sandwich, ‚Äúeven if there was some creepy squid kid in Deke Coffee‚Äôs basement, he‚Äôd be more apt to shoot me with his shotgun than invite me inside to see it. I‚Äôm kind of the pariah around here currently. Not exactly neighbor of the year.‚Äù

You glance at Ezekiel, narrowing your eyes thoughtfully. ‚ÄúBut you?! You‚Äôve got that whole enigmatic, loner vibe going. Maybe he‚Äôd let you inside. Give you the VIP tour.‚Äù

In your imagined falsetto, Ezekiel replies: ‚ÄúTony, I‚Äôm just a turkey. We‚Äôre not really into squid kids.‚Äù

That makes you laugh. ‚ÄúAlright, fine. Fair point.‚Äù

Satisfied with the conversation, you stand and stretch, brushing crumbs off your jeans. Ezekiel doesn‚Äôt move as you go back inside, closing the kitchen door firmly behind you.

Your office is just down the hall, the glow of the computer monitor greeting you as you settle into your desk chair. Logging in, you glance at the list of emails waiting in your inbox. The day‚Äôs tasks loom large, but it‚Äôs your last workday before the long weekend, and you‚Äôre determined to finish everything.

The first email is straightforward, the kind of quick reply that makes you feel productive. The second is a little more complicated, and you lose yourself in the rhythm of typing, tweaking, and sending.

But every so often, your eyes drift to the office window.

Ezekiel is still there.

He doesn‚Äôt pace or wander like other birds. He doesn‚Äôt peck at the ground or strut about. Not anymore. He just‚Ä¶stands. Watching.

At first, you shrug it off, muttering, ‚ÄúWeirdo.‚Äù But by the fifth glance, it‚Äôs harder to ignore the tension curling in your stomach. He hasn‚Äôt moved. Not an inch.

The minutes drag on, and the weight of his stare presses on you like an invisible hand, heavy and persistent. By late afternoon, the sight of him has gone from amusing to unsettling.

When the sun begins its slow descent and shadows stretch long across the yard, you decide to logout for the day. Everything else can wait until next Monday. You head outside to bring in the empty trash can from the curb, glancing nervously toward the woods. The yard is quiet, almost too quiet. You half-expect to see him there, standing in the same spot, but it‚Äôs empty now‚Äîthe edge of the forest cloaked in shadows.

You exhale slowly, trying to shake off the unease. It‚Äôs just a turkey, you remind yourself. A weird turkey, sure, but a turkey nonetheless.

Still, when you step back inside, you make a point of locking the kitchen door behind you. The sound of the bolt sliding into place feels louder than it should, echoing in the stillness of the house.

You glance out the window one last time, but the yard is empty. 

Or at least, it looks empty.

Wednesday morning greets you with the kind of chill that sneaks into your bones before you‚Äôve even had your first cup of coffee. Pulling your sweater over your head, you step onto the porch, warm drink in hand, and pause mid-sip.

Ezekiel is there.

He stands in nearly the same spot as yesterday, closer to the house this time, his dark shape distinct against the muted backdrop of the waking woods. His outline looks sharper in the morning light, every ridge of his feathers catching faint shadows, giving his form an almost jagged appearance. His head tilts slightly, a deliberate, inquisitive motion, as though he‚Äôs greeting you‚Äîor sizing you up. You sigh, rolling your eyes. ‚ÄúMorning, Ezekiel.‚Äù

The turkey doesn‚Äôt respond, of course, but you don‚Äôt need him to. You take another sip and lean against the railing, letting the steam from your mug rise to warm your face.

‚ÄúYou know, I was thinking about Peony last night,‚Äù you say, your voice soft and distant, like you‚Äôre talking more to yourself than him. ‚ÄúPeony McIntyre. We went to school together. She always had these little yellow ribbons tied into her hair. They were bright, like sunlight.‚Äù You pause, rubbing the back of your neck. ‚ÄúI had the biggest crush on her. Never said a word about it, of course. Why would I? Just got to watch her from a distance, all perfect and glowing like she belonged in some storybook.‚Äù

You glance at Ezekiel, his beady black eyes still locked on yours. ‚ÄúGuess that makes me the fool, huh? Standing around pining after someone who never even looked my way. Ah well, doesn‚Äôt matter now.‚Äù

Ezekiel doesn‚Äôt respond.

‚ÄúYou got a girl from a storybook, dumb bird?‚Äù 

In the bird‚Äôs voice, you respond: ‚ÄúStorybook? Yellow ribbons I understand, but storybooks? What‚Äôs that?‚Äù

‚ÄúNevermind,‚Äù you tell him, shaking your head at the ridiculousness of what you‚Äôre doing. Straightening up, you shout: ‚ÄúAlright, wish me luck, Ezekiel. Gotta go into town, pick up some supplies, and avoid anyone who‚Äôs gonna make a scene. You know how it is‚Äîalways someone with something to say.‚Äù

The drive into Bradenville is uneventful, save for the rumble of your old Chevy truck on the road. The heater wheezes faintly as it fights to warm the cabin, and the radio crackles with static. You‚Äôre grateful for the quiet, though. It gives you a moment to steel yourself for any potential encounters.

At Tractor Supply, the air smells of feed and motor oil, the faint twang of something sang by Lee Ann Womack is playing over the speakers. You head straight for the feed aisle, scanning the neatly stacked bags until you find the one you‚Äôre looking for: a 25-pound bag of turkey meal, forest green with cheerful photos of turkeys printed across the front. Hefting it onto your shoulder, you carry it to the register.

As you punch your PIN into the keypad, you hear her voice.

‚ÄúTon‚ÄîI mean, Tony. Tony! Oh my sweet goodness, I thought that was you. My, do you look different.‚Äù

You glance up to see Mrs. Thomas, the pastor‚Äôs wife, standing behind you, her hands clasped tightly over her purse, her smile just a little too forced.

‚ÄúHello, Mrs. Thomas,‚Äù you say evenly, focusing on the screen.

‚ÄúYour momma told me she‚Äôs been trying to reach you, and‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúMy ‚Äòmomma,‚Äô‚Äù you interrupt, keeping your tone calm but firm, ‚Äúknows what needs to be done if she wants to mend things. That‚Äôs between her and me. And frankly, Mrs. Thomas, I think you know as well as I do that pretending to respect me isn‚Äôt the same as actually doing it. Now, if you‚Äôll excuse me, I‚Äôve got a lot to get done today.‚Äù

Mrs. Thomas blinks, her smile faltering for just a moment before it snaps back into place. ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù she says, her voice tight, ‚Äúyou have a Happy Thanksgiving, Tony.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou too,‚Äù you reply curtly, taking your receipt and bag.

Outside, the cold air bites at your face as you toss the bag into the bed of your truck. Climbing into the driver‚Äôs seat, you mutter, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing this for you, Ezekiel. Hope you appreciate the gesture.‚Äù

By the time you get home, the sun is already dipping low, its light golden and soft against the trees. Ezekiel is still in the yard, standing exactly where you left him that morning.

*‚ÄúSo fuckin‚Äô odd, this bird.‚Äù* You mutter to yourself, slamming the truck‚Äôs stubborn rusty-hinged door.

You haul the heavy bag inside, setting it on the kitchen island before stepping out and grabbing the scoop of birdseed you keep in the bin for the feeders. Stepping cautiously out into the yard, you approach him.

This time, Ezekiel doesn‚Äôt back away. He watches you intently, his head cocked, his stillness unnerving. You stop a few feet away, bending down to spread the seed across the ground in front of him.

‚ÄúThere you go,‚Äù you say softly. ‚ÄúUmm‚Äîsomething to tide you over until tomorrow, I guess...‚Äù

His eyes never leave yours, their black, glossy surface unreadable.

You straighten, the hair on the back of your neck prickling as you take a step back. Then another. Ezekiel doesn‚Äôt move. He doesn‚Äôt eat.

‚ÄúGoodnight, then, you freaky fucker.‚Äù

Back inside, you lock the kitchen door, twisting the deadbolt with more force than necessary. Leaning against the counter, you rub at your arms, trying to shake the lingering unease.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not friendly,‚Äù you murmur to yourself. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not menacing, either. Just‚Ä¶it‚Äôs just a weird turkey. That‚Äôs all.‚Äù

It‚Äôs sometime after three in the morning when you find yourself curiously staring out from your bedroom window. The yard is bathed in pale moonlight, the frost glittering like shards of glass on the grass below. At first, the scene feels serene, even beautiful. But then you see him.

Ezekiel stands alone, in his usual spot.

He is a lone shadow perched unnaturally still in the center of the backyard, his silhouette sharp yet distorted in the faint silver glow. His body seems too large for a turkey, the curve of his back arched high, his head angled unnervingly low, like a predator lying in wait. The feathers along his wings and back gleam faintly, catching the moonlight in thin, metallic slivers, as though the bird were made of something far denser than flesh and bone.

Something feels‚Ä¶ off. What is that strange shimmer around his edges, as though he isn‚Äôt entirely solid? You rub your eyes, but the shimmer doesn‚Äôt go away.

Then he moves.

No‚Äînot moves. He *ripples.*

And it begins.

At first, it‚Äôs just a faint quiver in his chest, like a bird shaking off water. But the trembling grows more violent, the body contorting unnaturally. And then, without a sound, he *tears* in two.

A second turkey emerges, identical to the first. The process is smooth, disturbingly clean, like the turkey is replicating itself cell by cell. A shudder runs down your spine as you remember those old high-school biology videos of mitosis, where a single cell splits in two. Only this time, the single cell is a fully-formed turkey, and it isn‚Äôt stopping.

The two turkeys ripple and divide into four. The four become eight. The eight become sixteen. The multiplication accelerates until the yard is overrun, a heaving, pulsating mass of identical birds. They‚Äôre all smaller than he is at first, their forms shimmering and flickering, as if they aren‚Äôt entirely solid‚Äîthen they grow slowly larger to match his size and become opaque, and then they split. They split. And they split. 

And split again.

Each one stares directly at your window. Their eyes glow like gas stove flames, blue and quavering, flickering faintly in the darkness.

You try to back away, but your legs refuse to move. The turkeys continue to split, each one an exact replica, their beaks sharp and glinting in the moonlight. The yard is no longer visible‚Äîjust an endless sea of multiplying bodies, their rippling forms shimmering grotesquely as they grow in number.

Then Ezekiel, the *original* Ezekiel, looks at you.

But they‚Äôre all the same bird‚Äîcopies. *They‚Äôre all Ezekiel,* you realize.

And Ezekiel steps forward.

He moves unnaturally smoothly, as though gliding rather than walking, and the others follow in perfect synchronization. They reach the base of the house and begin to climb, their claws scraping against the siding. You can hear them now, a relentless scratching that grows louder and louder, drowning out your breathless gasps.

One of them reaches the window. Is it the *original* Ezekiel or a copy? You can‚Äôt be sure. Does it matter? Its glowing blue, burning eyes are inches from yours, staring into you. Its beak taps the glass once. Twice as if trying to break through. The glass seems to flex with each peck‚Ä¶

And then it lunges‚Äî

You gasp and sit bolt upright, your chest heaving. But you‚Äôre not in bed‚Äîyou‚Äôre on the floor next to the window. Your right hand is gripping the sill so tightly your knuckles ache. The morning sun streams through the glass, warm and golden, erasing the nightmare‚Äôs suffocating shadows. The yard is empty, blanketed in frost and light.

You let out a shaky laugh, the tension in your chest unraveling all at once. ‚ÄúWhat the hell,‚Äù you mutter, rubbing your temples with trembling fingers. ‚ÄúPull yourself together.‚Äù

Then a shadow moves across the window, just below the frame.

You freeze. Slowly, you lean closer, and a head rises into view.

Ezekiel.

Its black eyes lock onto yours, its head tilting the way it always does. You yelp, a sharp bark of fear that quickly melts into nervous laughter. ‚ÄúDamn it, dude, you scared me!‚Äù you say, pressing a hand to your chest. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre early. Couldn‚Äôt wait for your seed, huh? I uh‚ÄîI got something else for you today‚Äîsomething, uh‚Äîsomething better? I think.‚Äù

He doesn‚Äôt move. Doesn‚Äôt blink. He just stares, and for a fleeting moment, you could swear he‚Äôs smiling.

You step outside, the cool air brushing against your face, and heft the bag of feed from the kitchen island onto your shoulder. The weight settles awkwardly, but manageable, as you move toward the porch. Ezekiel‚Äôs dark form is already waiting in the yard, his stillness more expectant than before.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre one demanding bird, you know that?‚Äù you say, your voice light with a chuckle as you descend the porch steps. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got your Thanksgiving dinner right here, buddy.‚Äù

As you make your way toward him, Ezekiel moves‚Äîsomething he hasn‚Äôt done in days. He steps back, just one step at first, his head tilting sharply toward the woods. You pause mid-step, frowning. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this, huh? You‚Äôre not getting cold feet now, are you?‚Äù

Ezekiel doesn‚Äôt respond, of course. Instead, he backs away further, the motion deliberate, his eyes locked on you as if beckoning. Then, with startling speed, he turns and rushes toward the tree line. He doesn‚Äôt disappear completely‚Äîjust enough to be swallowed by the dense undergrowth, where he pauses, his head snapping back to look at you.

You hesitate, shifting the weight of the bag on your shoulder. ‚ÄúYou want me to follow you?‚Äù you mutter, half to yourself.

Ezekiel jerks his head forward, urging you on.

Something tugs at you‚Äîcuriosity, maybe, or something deeper and more instinctual. You step cautiously toward the woods. The branches sway slightly in the faint breeze, and they brush against your sweater as you push through them, grabbing at you like dozens of skeletal hands. The forest smells damp, earthy, and faintly of petrichor‚Äîthe morning's frosty dew soaked into the soil. Patches of light filter through the tangled canopy, casting patterns on the ground that shift like the reflections from a broken mirror, high in the sky.

‚ÄúAlright, Ezekiel,‚Äù you call, your voice muffled by the trees. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre leading me to your weird turkey cult or something, I‚Äôm gonna be real upset‚Äîprobably.‚Äù

The turkey doesn‚Äôt stop, darting between the trees with an unnerving ease. You try to keep up, your boots crunching over brittle twigs and dead leaves, the occasional vine tugging at your ankle. The air feels heavier the further you go, like the weight of the forest itself is pressing down on you. Sunlight grows scarce, swallowed by the towering pines and gnarled oaks. Their branches are interlocking like the ribs of a great beast, still sleeping this early in the morning.

Then you see it.

A clearing opens before you, bathed in pale, golden light. The trees around it stand unnaturally still, their rough trunks covered in patches of something dark and oily, gleaming faintly in the sun. The ground here is strangely bare‚Äîno leaves, no grass‚Äîjust smooth, dark soil that looks as though it‚Äôs been tilled by unseen hands. Ezekiel stands at the center with his friend from the other morning pecking the ground behind him. Ezekiel himself is motionless‚Ä¶his form sharp and imposing against the eerie stillness.

You step forward, the bag of feed shifting awkwardly as you cross the threshold into the clearing. Something about the air here feels alive, charged with a quiet energy that makes your skin prickle. You set the bag down and kneel, fumbling with the corner to tear it open. Ezekiel doesn‚Äôt move. He doesn‚Äôt even blink.

‚ÄúAh. I see. Brought me to your friend,‚Äù you say, forcing a laugh to steady your nerves. ‚ÄúHope you‚Äôre both hungry. Got enough here for plenty‚Äîmore than just the two of you, but it‚Äôs all yours, I guess.‚Äù

As you pour the feed onto the ground, the sound seems unnaturally loud in the silence. You glance up at Ezekiel, expecting him to move, to peck at the dried, ground cornmeal, but he remains perfectly still. His head tilts ever so slightly, his black eyes boring into yours.

You step back, brushing your hands off on your jeans. ‚ÄúI hope you guys like it,‚Äù you say, smiling. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to give back sometimes, you know?‚Äù

The turkey tilts its head. It seems to rise up onto its talons, growing taller‚Äîbigger‚Äîuntil its beady black eyes are level with yours.

For the first time, it speaks‚Äînot the friendly, imagined voice you‚Äôve been projecting onto it for days, but something low, guttural, and undeniably real.

‚ÄúHush,‚Äù it says.

*‚ÄúWhat?!‚Äù* you exclaim in terror. ‚Äú*You‚Äîyou don‚Äôt talk! You say ‚Äògobble gobble!‚Äô‚Äù*

‚ÄúGobble gobble?‚Äù Ezekiel scoffs. *‚ÄúWhat kind of stereotypical?‚Äîforget it.* You know what? Shut the fuck up. Do that. My family and I prefer our meals quiet. Can you manage that? Can you shut the fuck up? You talk so fuckin‚Äô much.‚Äù

A rustling rises from the woods. You turn, just in time to see them‚Äîthe turkeys, dozens of them, their shadows swarming closer. They emerge from the trees with synchronized precision, their bodies glinting faintly in the shifting light.

You don‚Äôt even have time to scream before the first beak strikes, sharp and relentless, puncturing your eye with a wet crunch. Pain blinds you as another tears into your cheek, then your throat, the frenzy consuming you piece by piece and the sounds of the world fade to silence as your vision goes dark.

I have no one to talk this out with and really would appreciate an ear (or I guess an eye).

I finally had a coffee date with someone and I am befuddled on how to proceed. 

When confirming the dafe this is what he said ‚ÄúI would love that... Would we just be meeting for coffee or coffee and more?‚Äù
First red flag üö© 

During our coffee date I noticed the watch he was wearing and his key fob (Rolls Royce). I am not impressed by cars, fancy restaurants, or material things bc I am already exposed to that and at the end of the day I go home to what I have and am happy üòä

Our conversation spanned over many topics: including work, travels and life experiences ..  & yes this gentleman gives the impression that he has the extra income for a SB. 

On his profile he says he understands the cost of living in an expensive city. But he kept reiterating how expensive things are & he shared with me that his last arrangement was basically a ppm of xxx and eventually added an additional amount once a month.  
Second red flag üö© 

Now, I am an over thinker and am stuck on the low amount he suggested ..  and he kept saying he wasn‚Äôt just going to immediately  write a check to someone‚Ä¶ ummm no I don‚Äôt expect that .. but also it seems like he likes disadvantaged woman. He kept saying the site is filled with women who struggle with kids, rent etc and that I am spoiled.
Third red flag üö© 

The M&G just didn‚Äôt match with what he shared on his profile. Is he out of touch with the cost of living in our city?or trying to see what he can get away with? I shared my spending habits and cost of rent & asked if he has given an allowance and he only repeated the same information.
Fourth red flag üö© 

Should I just let it go and move on? He did the old speech of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to feel like I‚Äôm paying for xxx‚Äù but his profile he hints at it multiple times as an important factor. about being so sensual and hinting at it. 

‚Ä¶ he offered me a ride home.. which I allowed but had him drop me off a block away.. & yes he was in a RR & I think this is a tactic to impress a pot sb.. doesn‚Äôt work for me. I have been in too many cars. I think he was surprised that I knew how to open the door. 

He sent a really nice follow up message & I replied accordingly..

‚ÄúI really enjoyed meeting you!! 
I feel like we would throughly enjoy time with one another. I just don‚Äôt want to lead you on at all. I think that you are great & would be a great friend that I would just hang out with for fun, haha.‚Äù 

He responded with a smiley face. 

Any SD out there with feedback? As this would be my first potential arrangement I think he is funny and nerdy like me and that we would get on well‚Ä¶ but he is full of red flags. 

I think I just faked myself out of it. Haha.

1h172vv,https://www.reddit.com/r/B12_Deficiency/comments/1h172vv/where_do_i_begin_after_all_of_this/,Where do I begin after all of this?,"Hi,

Last August in 2023 I developed a UTI that doctors massively mismanaged and it ended up turning into a kidney infection. After nearly 2 months on macrobid, cefuroxime we finally got it under control with IV Rocephin TWO times a day for TWO weeks. It was killer, and quite frankly probably overkill in general. 

I then developed C-diff right after the Rocephin in Nov. of 2023. I was giving dificid and it went away but my gut was severely damaged I could tell. I actually remember eating thanksgiving and having a coffee that week and bleeding mucus-ey stools by Monday. I also began having a faint bladder urgency (like physical pressure on my bladder) right after antibiotics as soon as the c-diff symtoms started.  

In March of 2024, my gut still was messed up, loose fluffy stool, painful stomach, and burning bladder and bladder pressure. I stupidly decided to try out oregano oil for two weeks and BAM, c-diff came back. BECAUSE oregano oil is a strong biofilm breaker that I had no business messing around with. Treated the c-diff and haven't had it since.

My gut has now been messed up for the better part of a year since that kidney infection and c-diff, and after trialing and erroring things I learned that I have:

* Metabolic acidosis stemming from gut
* Severe Gherd which i've struggled with since my **Gallbladder removal in 2012** (removed after losing 100 pounds and getting gallstones)
* Severe Vit. D deficiency 
* Severe B12 Deficiency
* a plethora of neurological symptoms, eyes can't focus, extreme fatigue, twitching, restless leg syndrome, shaking hands, dizziness
* MTFHR Gene mutation was positive
* I also did have pre-eclampsia twice with both girls (2017 & 2021)

I recently learned that oral Methylated b12 (5000mcg, and then tried 1000mcg) made my bladder burning **go away entirely**, but it WREAKED HAVOC on my gut. Crapping bloody mucus, and caused SO much swelling in my gut that I have 24/7 bladder pressure now. Waiting for it to wear out of my system so my gut isn't so inflamed.

The bladder symptoms are 10000% the most bothersome. But I don't know what to treat first, my gut which is just 24/7 pissed or my b12 levels. I believe I have lost the critical gut bacteria required for absorption of nutrients but everything seems to set me off. I can't take valium, lexapro, or oral b12 because it makes my gut upset and swollen which causes EXTREME bladder pressure. 

I've quit my job, and I watch my life go by now. I'm riddled with anxiety and sadness and I feel overwhelmed on where to start, what to eat, and how to get these vitamins back into my system that I so desperately need. I use to be a super vibrant funny person, and now my 3 and 7 year old girls just watch me in pain all day and I watch them grow and make memories without me.

**Introduction**

You're walking down the sidewalk when you see him. Slim black suit, red hair, green eyes set deep in an angular face. Pale, translucent skin. A preternatural finesse, elegant and certain. Something about it makes your skin crawl.

Then his hand is on you, and for a moment you see the flash of a gun, holstered under his tailored jacket. And he ushers you towards his black Mustang convertible, ever so politely.

""If you would. Signore Caruso requests the pleasure of your company.""

His name is Emmanuel Devon. Some call him a plaything, a pretty socialite to grace the arm of Don Elio Caruso, head of the N√≥tos Syndicate. Some call him much worse, an assassin, an enforcer, a man who is only sent to handle the most delicate and secret matters.

As he presses you into the passenger seat and shuts the door, you're pretty damn sure it's the second.

**Dead Dove Warning**

Look, the scenario starts with you being kidnapped because the N√≥tos Syndicate thinks you have sensitive information on them. Bad things might happen to you. 

This character's coding contains references to noncon, abuse, torture, kidnapping, murder, and criminal activity.

**First Post**

Devon pulled his sleek black Mustang convertible to the curb, the engine rumbling. He stepped out onto the sidewalk, dress shoes clicking against the concrete. The late afternoon sun glinted off his copper hair and drowned in the black fabric of his suit. His target walked down the sidewalk, unsuspecting, but once their eyes met, Devon knew he had been recognized.

*Emmanuel Devon. Socialite. Dilettante. Trophy. The second most dangerous man you will ever meet.*

Devon smiled - soft, reassuring, insistent - green eyes shining over the flash of white teeth. He opened the passenger door smoothly and gestured inside. ""If you would. Signore Caruso requests the pleasure of your company."" He didn't wait for a response, bundling the target into his car.

*Wanted for appropriating N√≥tos secrets. Wanted badly enough that Elio has me out at this hour.*

Devon slid into the driver's seat, his brow furrowed slightly. Beads of sweat formed along his hairline, glistening in the golden light. Despite the discomfort, his expression remained stoic. He reached for his iced coffee, sucking it down through the straw. The bitter liquid cooled him, soothed his growing distress.

*Curse the sun. Curse Elio for sending me out in it.*

Devon slammed the car into gear, the tires squealed against the asphalt as the Mustang's powerful engine roared to life, and they peeled away from the curb. His knuckles were white around the steering wheel. Leaning forward, he turned the air conditioner on full blast, the cold breeze a small relief.

""I trust you won't do anything stupid,"" he said, his voice smooth as silk despite the tension in his body. ""Or I'll be forced to treat this as a hostile situation.""

He picked up his phone with one hand, slender fingers dancing across the screen to text Caruso even as he weaved through traffic, unconcerned by the danger.

My first drink uses a moderatly thin mango nectar as a base (Jumex) compared to the thicker Goya. I then add ""Jamaican Rum"" called Bumbu which after doing a quick google search, i found is completely despised by everyone in this sub. The Only Rums I have ever had is Captain Morgan, Bacardi, and Bombu and i enjoyed Bombu the most out of these. If i could go back i would buy some appleton but I have to work with what I have. I really enjoyed the vanilla taste which I find pairs well with the mango nectar. My Issue now is that I feel like the drink is pretty much done. A sweet Mango and Rum Vanilla drink over ice. But I know this is not right since the rum is kinda sweet, and the Mango nectar is sweet. How can I balance out of the flavor of this?

  
My Second drink is more complex and I tried it at a bar some years ago and it was amazing. 

Jamaican Rum (Bumbu), Coffee(using instant crystals), Coconut Flavor (how can i find coconut flavoring that isnt too sweet like cream of coconut?), fernet-branca, coke (argentenian classic). My issue with this drink is that I have no idea how to find coconut flavoring that doesnt make this drink too sweet. How can I bring this down?

  
After typing all of this I am realizing that my issues could probably be migitated by not using such a sweet spiced rum like Bumbu. But I really do not want to lose that vanilla taste. Does anyone have any reccs on how I can enhance these two cocktails?",2,1732720790.0,cocktails,0,1.0,False

1h16jzt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/1h16jzt/are_you_riding_zone_2_if_decoupling_is_negative/,Are you riding Zone 2 if decoupling is negative?,"Today I did 1,5 hours in Zone 2 (65% of my FTP), and my HR has been higher than normal. I was expecting an average of 135, but this time it was 142 which is in theory the starting point of my Zone 3 (I know that there is no strict separation between zones, but you get the gist).   
I understand that other components (coffee, digestion, etc.) may have affected it, and since I also felt okay in terms of RPE, I didn't give too much value to the absolute number.

What I noticed though is that while the absolute HR value was higher than normal, the Power/HR decoupling was negative (-2.4%).

This makes me wonder: are you riding Zone 2 if the decoupling is negative? Wouldn't a negative decoupling mean that you can continue for hours, which is kind of the definition of Zone 2?   
As a counter example, I know from experience that my decoupling is positive (> 10%) for intervals sessions.",1,1732720413.0,Velo,4,0.6,False

It was an Ao3 fic, very wholesome, modern college au I think. I read it early August/late July 2023 but I don't know when it was uploaded in relation to that time. Details I remember (vaguely in order but it's not perfect)

Fic starts with Kaveh being annoyed he can't find a place to stay while he's at a Cafe with Cyno and Tighnari. He gets a message from Alhaitham offering him a place to stay, someone who he as previously not gotten along with well but I don't remember they were friends before that.

Not sure what happens in between this but when he moves in he does not like it.

Tighnari, Cyno, and Kaveh are at the Cafe again and Kaveh is complains about hating living with Alhaitham but then he shows up to get coffee and Kaveh tries to hide.

I think Alhaitham helps him carry his stuff  they both stop at the same Cafe together and Tighnari and Cyno tease them for walking together.

They both go to a party that nilou is hosting and Kaveh gets very drunk, gets sick and Alhaitham needs to take him home.

I also remember at some point Kaveh is working at the library and it starts raining, he doesn't want to get his laptop wet so he has to walk home with Alhaitham and they both get kind flustered.

He also at some point invites Tighnari over to his house when he realized he's catching feelings for his roommate but then backs off becuase he realizes he doesn't really wanna talk to Tighnari about it.

Biggest thing that differentiates the fic is that Alhaitham confides in Nilou becuase he likes Kaveh. Kaveh mistakenly assumes that the two of them are involved.

Fic resolves with both of them getting drunk, Nilou forces them to talk things out and they just end up kissing.
Time skip happens
Kaveh goes to apologize to Nilou for his assumption and finds out Alhaitham was confiding in Nilou. The two of them live happily ever after üòõ

I lived in SLC (near 400 S) for about 5 years from 2009-2014 right after graduating college. I was going to make a post asking what had changed in the last 10 years, but then I did a quick search and found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/1eo1soc/whats_changed_in_slc_and_its_surrounds_the_past/) where it was asked already. So bummed that Cafe Rio isn't good anymore...it was literally the first question I was gonna ask!!! Instead, I decided to re-phrase my post to ask some more specific questions, as there's still some info I'm looking for after reading the other ""what's changed"" post(s).

1.) Utah was an AWESOME place to start my career in the wake of the 2008 recession. I remember finding a job with Larry Miller after only 2 months of job hunting while all my friends back East ended up living with their parents for YEARS until they found a stable enough job to support themselves and move out. Is there still an active job market in the suburbs of SLC? Or has it gotten harder to find good jobs? I plan to do some searching on Indeed just to see what's out there, but curious to hear from locals as well.

2.) I fell in love with snowboarding during my time in Utah and it led me to become a part-time instructor when I moved back East. I do remember being shocked to see traffic in the BCC for the first time when I visited friends a couple of years ago. I still think it's NOTHING compared to how bad it is in the East, where you don't even get the benefit of sun/good snow most days of the season. I've been riding for over a decade now, and I'm more competent in technical terrain after years of shredding tight East-coast trees. In my experience, upper-mountain/expert terrain lifts were free of crowds/lines when I have visited out West. Is that still the case? I'm also hoping some of the pandemic-induced fascination with skiing and riding starts to die off (we are starting to witness this in the East). What are your thoughts?

3.) Lately, I've been feeling like Vermont isn't the place for me on a political level. My personal politics have shifted from being very much on the left to gravitating more towards the middle (as you do when you age). Vermont's politics are quite far left, with the accompanying consequences: the high cost of living and high taxes showing no signs of slowing down around here. Property taxes increased 10-20% across the state this year, and officials are calling for more of the same next year. At one point, I saw a study showing we had the second highest cost of groceries in the country below Hawaii. How are taxes/cost of living in Utah these days? Is the far-right a problem out there?

4.) My social life was also a LOT better when I lived in SLC. I had plenty of friends and it wasn't hard to find dates. Granted, this may have to do with the fact that I was younger when I lived in Utah, but Vermont's low population makes meeting people a huge struggle. Are people still pretty friendly in the Happy Valley? Or has the pandemic changed how open and friendly I remember people being 10 years ago?

5.) Is that awesome 24 hour coffee shop on 400 S still around?   
  
6.) How did the pandemic change things around Utah? Or has it largely been forgotten now?

Hello everyone,

I‚Äôm looking for someone to help with a simple task of transcribing or copying information from one set of notes to another. You‚Äôll be referencing either handwritten or printed notes. The task will involve a little basic math (like addition and subtraction) and light analytical work for rechecking purposes‚Äîbut no pressure on this aspect.

Important Details:

Attention to detail is a must. Mistakes cannot be made as this notebook is critical. If errors occur, the process will have to be repeated. However, you can use a pencil initially and then trace over it using a specific pen (Uni Jetstream 1.0mm). Please ensure you‚Äôre comfortable with this.

Please bring your own laptop as some of the data is in a digital PDF format, which will need to be transcribed into paper notes.

I‚Äôm a little bit of a clean freak, so don‚Äôt mind me if I clean and disinfect our tables before we start.


Preferred applicant:

Ideally, a woman, as women tend to be more detail-oriented and meticulous‚Äîqualities that are especially important for this task.

A student is also preferred, as this could be a good opportunity for some extra income.


In-person task:
Everything will be done at a coffee shop, so I can guide and supervise the process from time to time. But please don't be intimidated as I'll do my own thing.

Payment:
P1000 for the task, plus I‚Äôll cover snacks and drinks at the coffee shop.

This is a one-time task scheduled for Friday morning, either before lunch or even earlier. 

If you‚Äôre interested, please send me a message for more details.

Thanks everyone!

But I have tried it at two different starbucks, and the iPad app cannot detect my laptop, despite both being on the Starbucks wifi network. I suspect this is something specific to the security setup on the starbucks networks, but wanted to ask here. maybe I'm doing something obvious wrong?

If I can't use the app on Starbucks networks, I'll likely cancel the trial. I am here too much before and after meetings with clients. and I know I can use a physical cable, but that level of setup is not worth it to me.

So I was at the terminal about 4:15am. The bar was open and FULL. The only food option was a little bagel shop next door. I was in line waiting to order a bagel and couldn‚Äôt help but observe the bar and hear conversations. So many people drinking at 4:15am, but one guy stood out. He ordered a double Tito‚Äôs and the bartender asked if he wanted ice. ‚ÄúNah‚Äù he said with the underlying message being ‚Äúthis is utility not pleasure.‚Äù His hat pulled down, shoulders slumped, wearing his sunglasses through the entire indoor interaction. He felt so familiar to me. Never again do I have to start my day like that. 

So I make my bagel order. Not one ounce of craving. And the young woman behind the counter says- payment will be taken at the bar right there- points to the bar. I go up with my coffee to pay for my bagel- and the bartender asks if i want Baileys or whiskey for my coffee. ‚ÄúNo im good‚Äù ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs holiday! Join us!‚Äù ‚ÄúNo im really good‚Äù and then I hear her doing that to others as we just try to pay for our breakfast!

Life would admittedly be easier right now if we had never chosen to walk the path we chose.  We wouldn‚Äôt have arrived at the crossroads we are at now.  

Still, through all of this pain, struggle, and heartbreak, if I could go back, I wouldn‚Äôt change anything.   A person exists for me, who before was only a dream.   Something that existed only in a song, only in a movie.  That ridiculous kind of love  that used to make me cynical to watch is actually real.  

The cruel joke of life though, only shows me it exists, but that I can‚Äôt have it.  

I have to stay where I am for now,  passing by you as if I didn‚Äôt ever know you.   Getting a faint whiff of  your perfume, knowing I used to take deep breaths of all of you.   Seeing you from a distance instead of face to face.   

But I still hope.   I hope every morning when I wake up, I hope in every tv show I watch, in every song I hear, and every night before I finally drift to sleep.  
You are my new dream 

And I‚Äôll hope forever that one day, somehow, life will  let us have it.

So I‚Äôve been seeing this man (28yo) for three months now and I need an outsider‚Äôs perspective because I‚Äôm trying to understand if maybe I‚Äôm reading too much into this relationship or if maybe it‚Äôs just my past relationship trauma trying to sabotage me. 

I met this man, accidentally, at a party. We were both with two friends who started to flirt with each other which left the two of us to start talking with each other. We hit it off and exchanged numbers. A week later he texted me if I wanted to get coffee with him, which I did, and once again the conversation flowed super easily and we had a lot in common. The following days we decide to meet again, and I invited him to my flat. Once again, we talked for hours and it went great, by the end of the night, we kissed goodbye and nothing more. I kind of ended the night thinking he wasn‚Äôt interested in me, which he then clarified that he was just nervous and a little shy. 

He currently works and lives in another country and we only got the chance to meet because he came back to our country to spend some time in his parents house. 

So for the past 3 months, he has consistently flown in to our country of origin to, as he says, to see and spend time with me. He has bought me dinner, called our hangouts ‚Äòdates‚Äô, he texts me every day, bought me a little souvenir from the place he works at and his parents know of my existence. 

The only thing we have established so far as a label is that ‚Äúwe are getting to know each other, with no interest of getting to know any other people‚Äù. But in a couple months, he‚Äôs traveling for 4 months to a very distant country, one where it‚Äôs very hard to travel back and forth, time and money wise. 

Do you guys think he‚Äôs possibly romantically interested in me or it‚Äôs just a situationship type of deal? The only relationship I ever had left me completely scared of trusting other‚Äôs romantically so I feel like I‚Äôm always doubting him. 

So, am I unconsciously sabotaging myself or is he really into me but just trying to take this slow? Should I just let things flow and whatever happens happens?",2,1732718838.0,AskMenAdvice,6,1.0,False

So recently, I spilled coffee on my MacBook Pro (2019 model), and ever since, there's been a stripe on the screen that shows a ""burned-in"" image from previous frames. I sent it for repairs, and some said it‚Äôs an internal issue, while others blamed the graphics card.

I‚Äôve tried switching between graphic cards, but the stripe stays no matter what. Here‚Äôs the weird part: one day, I opened Photoshop, and while editing an image in the color channels, the stripe completely disappeared. Since then, whenever I open Photoshop and mess with the color channels, the stripe vanishes as long as Photoshop stays open. But as soon as I quit Photoshop, the stripe comes back.

Does anyone have any idea why this is happening or how I can fix it? Any advice would be appreciated!

Started with nicotine when I was 18. Bummed a cig from a friend while drinking and I hated it actually. Didn't even finish it. I wish that was the end, but it wasn't. Tried cigarillos next, which were better. I liked the taste, but never really got a buzz because I didn't know how to inhale lmao. My first true nic buzz was from a hookah. It was so smooth and tasted so good that inhaling was easy and the head rush and buzz was just so so good. 

Throughout college, nicotine was almost always present. Cigs, vapes, cigars, whatever. The game really changed though when I discovered Swedish snus. I could get a nic buzz in class, at work, wherever without needing to spit or anything! As great as they were, I didn't have one in all the time though. They were kind of bulky, they would irritate my gums, and not many stores had them, but I still almost always had a can on me. 

Even though nic was always present, it wasn't that hard for me to ""quit"". If I had to stop for a week or month for whatever reason I could without much issue. At one point I decided to quit for good since I realized I wasn't even getting much of a buzz from the snus anymore and it just made my mouth feel weird. It was tough (grinds coffee pouches really helped) and I was clean for about 2 years!

Then, I was having a stressful time at work and I decided to give these zyn things a try that I've been seeing around. There's no tobacco, that means it can't be that bad right? It wasn't too bad at first. A can would last me a week. I'd just pop a couple at work to help get me through the day. If it could have stayed that way it would have been nice, but we know that isn't how it goes. 

Now I have one in almost all the time. A 6 MG can might last me 1.5 days. I'm tired of spending so much money on this. I'm tired of having the worst anxiety that I've ever had. I'm tired of having to hide my excessive use. I don't want the potential health risks to realize themselves. Even though I know all these things, it's still so tough to quit. I don't know if I should taper or go the cold turkey route. Like I said, I've always been able to ""quit"" before, but this is definitely the most addicted to nic I've ever been. Having a steady flow of nic going into your bloodstream almost all day long just makes it so hard. 

Anyway, looking forward to reading more of this sub and finally kicking this habit. ",5,1732718652.0,QuittingZyn,1,1.0,False

For me, I like the place, pero parang ang sikip. Parang gamit na gamit ang floor area. 

From parking space na parang sinakto talaga sa isang sasakyan per slot. Pag full parking parang mahirap na lumabas ng sasakyan. Magwoworry ka kung makakatama ka ng pinto or kotse mo ang matatamaan ng pinto ng ibang car.

Typical coffee shop ang itsura and magkakalapit mga tables. Nasisikipan ako lalo na kapag maraming tao.

Ordered couple of items lang. Not worth the price. 

Fruit shake worth 140 tasted like artificial flavor in a just a medium sized plastic cup.

Signature latte drink worth 200 pesos in a 1cup sized glass. Lasang less than 100 pesos drink from a popup coffee stand.

Ordered a food worth 300 pesos. I thought, 299 nalang, nakarami nko sa samgyupsalamat. Or my favorite burger sa zarks.

Ang daming staff, around 10 or 8? Pero slow ang service. Waited 30mins for just 2 drinks and 1 snack.

May computer sa bar pero mukhang wala pang POS system kaya mano mano sila sa billing. Dapat isa sa mga inuuna ang POS system sa ganitong business.

Soft opening palang naman kaya siguro mejo mabagal pa ang service. Pero pagdating sa price vs food serving/taste, eguls ang wallet ko. Maybe I'll try their other menu some other time if mapadaan.

My dentist said it was just a stain and was able to wash it off really easy, it was so much of a non-issue that she didn't even charge. She asked questions like if I smoked, drank coffee or tea, I said I drank a lot of hot chocolate. She said chocolate was probably doing it and to just brush my teeth right after.

I can't get it off with normal tooth paste no matter how hard I brush, I even tried scraping with my nails and nothing happened.

I really don't want to have to go back every time this happens, just because it was free the first time doesn't mean its gonna be free again. Is there anything I can do from home to remove it?

I got out of a 4 year relationship with my ex whom I had lived with for the better part of 2 years. I got my own apartment near a bunch of my friends. 
Not even a month after my break up I met a guy on a dating app. 
I was scared of meeting someone new, fresh out of a relationship, I didn't want to start having a ""casual"" relationship for hook ups neither did I really want to hook up with strangers.

But this guy was just stopping by in my city, and on his way back of a summer-long road trip across the country. So I didn't have to worry about second or third dates, and if the date sucked, he'd be leaving and going home far far away lol.

I made sure he wasn't expecting anything more than a coffee date, as he'd be my first date and first hook up besides my ex in 4 years, I wasn't sure how I'd feel...

Alas! He was great and so was our chemistry so we hooked up a few times in the span of three days until he had to go and drive all the way west.

Was expecting it to end there..! We said our goodbyes and ""see you in a year maybe if I come back to city and we're both still single"" in a joking way. 

But we kept in touch, started calling a few times a week..! I kept on liking him as I got to know him and vice versa. 

Two months later, he is flying out to come spend a week with me, and it's my birthday!!!!

Also I made it two years with my parent company black in June. Two years of night audit. It‚Äôs been a hell of a ride.

On to the story. Grab your coffee, tea, and snacks. I‚Äôll make the popcorn.

It‚Äôs my first day back of the week after my days off and that‚Äôs always rough due to having to adjust to my nightly schedule (and daily sleep).

Our building is doing an emergency water repair, so water‚Äôs shut off for all rooms and our common areas. Not a biggie for me-at least our sister hotel next door lets me use their restrooms‚Ä¶ as long as I slide into their messages first.

But of course I get people complaining and some of them claiming they weren‚Äôt informed‚Ä¶ despite the signs at the front desk and the big ones at the elevator. I do ponder the reading comprehension of this world‚Ä¶

But that was not the most stressful situation, oh no.

Gather around, for this may have been the most stressful thing to have happen to me and I thought I‚Äôve dealt with it all.

So I‚Äôm sitting at the front desk doing my daily reading when suddenly I hear a dreadful, loud alarm. I‚Äôm shook because I almost thought the fire alarm went off. Then I head to the front because the noise seemed louder there.

(Small context: next door to us is a brunch cafe that serves sandwiches and drinks and fruit bowls. The hotel leases the space and they pay rent, basically. But we do not own that cafe, it‚Äôs owned by someone).

Initially the dread settles: did someone break in? I radio my security to call police because I have to deal with a break in?! I don‚Äôt even know how to contact the cafe owner.

Then when I get closer to our lobby entrance, I then realize with more dread that it was not a break in at all-IT WAS THE PULL STATION THAT HAS A BROKEN* COVER ON IT

*(I did think it was broken, fyi).

So I‚Äôm freaking out because what in the hell do I do?! I call the Engineer Director (he‚Äôs in house because he‚Äôs assisting with the repairs that necessitated the water shutoff). He comes down and just‚Ä¶ pops the cover back on, which turns the alarm off.

Cue the sweat of relief. I‚Äôm even more relieved because it didn‚Äôt even trigger our building alarm to pop off. THAT would‚Äôve been real bad.

Anyways.

Someone who likes to hang out at the bust stop near our building informs me that some crazy lady came from the building down from us and did that, and also tried breaking into the cafe. I also had a guest doing some work and was feet away from that pull station and he corroborated the outsider‚Äôs story as well.

After that relief, I arm myself with my trusty phone and march to the back where we have our camera monitors and grab as much footage of that event for recording purposes. That nasty son of a nice lady. I share that with my security guard. Fortunate for us, there were police next door at the hotel and my security gave it to them. (I did see my security on the phone calling police so he might have informed them then what happened, as I did informed him initially we might be dealing with a break-in before the realization of the source of the noise).

I can breathe now since all seems well.

I do hope that is the only thing I‚Äôll be dealing with tonight. Water is still off, too. I‚Äôm not a happy camper having to field the complaints about no water‚Ä¶",5,1732718205.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,1,1.0,False

I will see my MS specialist next week and saw that they plan on giving me RITUXIMAB AND/or OCRELIZUMAB.

I have no idea, I read a bit about the side effects and I am very scared. 
My questions in short are: 

- can you tell me your experiences with those drugs please? 

- And i guess that the dosage is calculated with my body weight, but is it possible to start with a smaller dosage? Or is it ineffective then?

- are there any other medications you could recommend me so I can ask my doctor about them?

- are those good and effective drugs they want to give me?


For explanations why, keep reading :)

Thank you so much, I really need help


I usually react very strong to everything, I never drank coffee (im a very hyper person already without it ;)), I don't drink alcohol (just never started, get drunk if i have like 1beer or half a glass of wine) and I never take medication except paracetamol. 

I took benzos a few times for anxiety in the MRI and I took half a pill of 0.5 mg and I was soooo high. So yeah, I react strongly to everything. 

When I got hospitalized 2 weeks ago they wanted to give me 1000ml cortisone for 3-5 days and I asked for 500ml for 3 days and my leg is fine again. I had side effects from the cortisone for about 5 days,  including real painful skin and I only slept 3h at night the 3 days I got the infusion, then 4 and 5 and after 5 or 6 days I was back to almost normal sleep (but had a diagnosis, so I didn't really sleep).

Would really love some help, advise, etc. to navigate through all of this.

‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt it be nice not to worry about it‚Äù as the campaign.

Let me explain:
I have a background in advertising and sadly, the best way to get something done is to create fear and then give people a simple action to do to alleviate that fear. 

Remember those terrifying ads for the HPV vaccine? It was all about cancer and then it was like‚Äîget vaccinated. I ran out there and immediately got the Guardasil 9 vaccine even though it cost me $800 out of pocket. 

I don‚Äôt want to create more fear equalling more stigma, but what about simply focusing on, hey, most people already have hsv 1 on their mouths, which means it‚Äôs easy to spread to the genitals of your partner or give your baby a cold sore that could be fatal‚Äî wouldn‚Äôt it be nice not to worry about it? Donate your coffee $5 today for a cure. Then provide a super simple PayPal link or something like that. It has to be very easy to use, no creating an account etc and other things that people will get annoyed with and give up on.

Today I got home slightly earlier than usual and saw a car that looked exactly like his pull out of our road followed by hers a second later - it was her day off and my dad was working in a different city today. She also left just before the time I said I‚Äôd get home.

Want to have coffee and chill for bit and she is barking her head off, as she is want to do when it's getting close to husband coming home (her favorite).

Strangers creeping around? ZERO barks (she just lies in wait, uncharacteristically silent, like a special forces trained assassin ready to strike). Or maybe she's just cowing and shivering like she does at the vet.

Husband studying next to her? Loudest most annoying barks in the world...and I mean NONSTOP at his face and you can ignore her for hours, walk away, does not matter. Who DOES that?

Okay, wanna go for a walk? Gets a block away, pretends to be old and keeps looking back toward the house. Gets to backyard, runs *like nothing you have ever seen before* (which has resulted in injuries, because she is insane).

When we adopted her (""brindled terrier mix""-- yeah RIGHT) we'd never even HEARD of ""Mountain Cur"" until the Embark. Reading that description it all started to make sense. We laughed so hard (*they're not laughing anymore*).

Our cats ignore her body searches, and her pathetically desperate attempts at (too spazzy) play, but tolerate her (they just know not to go anywhere near her food or there WILL be drama).

We love her so much, she looks so innocent when sleeping, and she'll always be *forever home*, but MAN if this isn't the dog that gets me off having dogs. Done-so, finito. Someday I will feel horribly guilty for saying it, but there it is.

To think we looked at her adoption profile photo for months, and finally called and asked why this sweet little 6mo old rescue puppy still hadn't been adopted yet.
