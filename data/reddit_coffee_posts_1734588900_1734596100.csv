I have met some very interesting Uber drivers over the years, and have heard some incredible backstories. I have the idea to make a few short documentaries, so I‚Äôm reaching out to see if anyone is interested.
I would like to shoot an interview whilst driving around London (shot on GoPros or similar), simply talking about your life and history. 
This is not intended to be about Uber or anything similar. It‚Äôs not an expose. I want to focus on personal stories, and the life lived up to this point.
I‚Äôm not originally from London, so I have an interest in immigrant stories, but it would be ideal to have a mix of London born, UK born, and foreign born contributors.

Let me know if this sounds at all appealing, and you think you might have an interesting story to tell.

PS- the TV industry is on its knees- there is no work and this is an attempt to keep creative and active while I work out if my career is over. My hope is that I can book you for a long trip, offer coffee/snacks and a decent tip. Let me know if you think this is fair. ",1,1734595031.0,uberdrivers,0,1.0,False
1hho057,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1hho057/mom_said_she_is_done_with_me/,Mom said she is done with me,"For some background, first of all, my mother (46) and I (24M) have an exceptional relationship. We really deeply love each other. 

When I was 12, my parents got divorced and my dad hasn't been impactful or really present in my life ever since. We are on good terms, but we call each other maybe once a month, and see each other like twice a year tops. Growing up, I felt that I never had a father figure to show me how to be a grown up man, and always had my mother there to help me, to prioritize me over her own life and to just give whatever she had for my happiness. Thanks to her I had an amazing childhood. She didn't even let me work when I was at university so that I could just focus on school and having the best out of my young adult life, something she never had. 

Of course we have our moments and we fight from time to time but today, we had the worst.

We've been in a huge credit card debt for a year now. I graduated last year and found a decent teaching job at a private college 4 months ago. It pays well and I am just glad that I can help her out with the enormous debt, since she's done so much for me. At this point we try to pay for it together but even that leads us to barely make ends meet. In this hard financial situation with a lot of stress, especially for my mom who can't even sleep, 2 days ago, we had a car accident. We were fortunate enough to not even get a scratch, but the front of the car is pretty messed up. 

Today is my off day, and I woke up, and she said I should get the car fixed. (We have no money atm so we rely on the insurance to pay.) I have a girlfriend and we can only see each other once a week since we both work, and can't communicate much over the week. I had my plans today with her so I was a little bummed when she told me to deal with the car without just asking politely if I could do it and I started sulking. She asked me if I was okay, and I told her that I hate it when she speaks for me. That momentary reaction made her explode with rage. She was having a rageful attack and started crying and screaming. That was the load of stress she's been building with the weight of all the bad situations she has, financially and emotionally. She said that whenever she asks me to do something, I hesitate and I give her a hard time until I eventually do it. I told her that because she never fully appreciates the things I do when she asks me to do something. She got even angrier and threw a tantrum.

She said that she did everything she could for me her entire life, and said that I didn't even tell her ""Don't worry mom, I'll deal with the car. You just go to work."" She said she won't ask anything from me anymore, not my money, not my help, nothing. 

Her words exactly: ""I will always love you, you are my son and nothing will change it, but people have a credit and you exceeded yours and I am tired. I am done with you. I don't wanna see you and hear your voice, I will leave this house, you take your money, you take your everything to yourself. I've done everything for you, we had an accident because I took you from your friend's house on my way home from work. If you didn't ask me to give you a lift, we wouldn't even crash. And now I ask this from you and you give me attitude? You never do something for me when I ask for it, when I need it. You don't wanna help me in a really bad situation when I am this stressed because you are gonna see your girlfriend today! You are an ungrateful person and you good to me because I am good to you, today I realized that. My friends called me and offered help even tho I didn't ask for it. You never do that, you are there when we have a good day but never wanna carry the burden we are in a bad situation and always expect me to handle it. I'm out, you and I are DONE."" 

I told her that I am reluctant to help her when she asks for it because she is never fully content with the things I do when she asks for it. She has high standards and I always felt like I never reach those standards. Even when she spills coffee on the floor, she doesn't like the way I clean it and criticizes me until she finally takes it from my hands and does it herself. 

I know I was inconsiderate in a hard situation for her, and I know that I shouldn't have done it. This turned out really bad, and she said she doesn't even want my apology, and she'll never forget about this, not a week later, not a year later. She stormed out to get the car done with my uncle.

I don't know what to do. She is right tho. I always give her a hard time in the time of need. Idk if it's because I am lazy, or take her for granted or maybe because she never likes what I do. How am I supposed to apologize? Should I give her some space for a while? She doesn't even want my apology and saw that she meant it, I know my mom. Something in her shattered for our relationship and I am not sure she will ever trust me again. ",3,1734595027.0,family,1,1.0,False

I know euploid transfers are not 100% but it is quite the headfuck! 

Until 2023 my problem was recurrent miscarriage, I am incredibly grateful to have one living child but either side of her are 7 failed pregnancies: 1 ectopic, 3 chemical pregnancies, 3 missed miscarriages. At least one of the pregnancies was a triploidy/genetic abnormality so after suddenly not conceiving for a year (after TTC for nearly 3 years) we opted to burn money and go for IVF with PGT. My RPL tests were unremarkable apart from high NK cells.

Unexpectedly we got a good number of euploids, so after my FET failed I wonder if my problem is my womb lining and not my eggs after all. 

I know I should probably get ERA/EMMA/ALICE/lap for silent endo, but after all the RPL tests and saline hysterosalpingography and NK cell tests and their associated bills I just feel in my gut I don't want more tests.

Are there things I can do meaningfully for my lining? I've done acupuncture, baby asprin, vit e, pom juice. Would taking doxy help? I have had lots of ERPCs so I wonder if I have an infection. I already took oral prebiotics but maybe I need a higher dose? I could probably improve my diet but it's not horrific atm. I do drink maybe 4 decaf coffees a day, I don't know if this is a problem üòï

1hhnrfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1hhnrfd/small_space_solutions_furniture_ideas_for_compact/,Small Space Solutions: Furniture Ideas for Compact Living,"Living in a compact space doesn't mean you have to compromise on style or functionality. With the right furniture choices, you can maximize every inch of your home while maintaining a chic and comfortable ambiance. From multi-functional pieces to space-saving designs, here are some clever furniture ideas to help you make the most of your small space.

# 1. Embrace Multi-Functional Furniture

In a compact living area, furniture that serves multiple purposes is a game changer. Look for:

* Convertible Sofas: A stylish sofa that doubles as a guest bed is perfect for small apartments.
* Storage Ottomans: Use them as a footrest, additional seating, or hidden storage for blankets and magazines.
* Expandable Tables: Dining tables that can fold or extend are ideal for small dining areas.

# Tip: If you‚Äôre shopping for [home furniture Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture), look for versatile pieces that combine functionality with modern aesthetics to suit your space.

# 2. Opt for Compact and Lightweight Furniture

Furniture with a small footprint is essential for compact spaces. Lightweight designs, like a [rattan side table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/tables/outdoor-side-tables), are practical yet stylish additions that fit seamlessly into smaller areas.

* Rattan Side Table: A lightweight rattan side table works beautifully in the living room or bedroom, adding a natural, airy touch while providing a practical surface for essentials.
* Stackable Chairs: Perfect for entertaining guests, they can be neatly stored away when not in use.

# 3. Maximize Vertical Space

When floor space is limited, think vertically. Use tall shelving units, wall-mounted cabinets, and floating shelves to store items without taking up precious floor area.

* Add a side table with built-in shelves for a dual-purpose solution, perfect for placing next to your sofa or bed.
* Floating desks or wall-mounted foldable tables can serve as workspaces that don‚Äôt dominate the room.

# Shopping Tip: If you‚Äôre looking for a [side table Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/coffee-tables), opt for designs that combine compactness with storage functionality.

# 4. Incorporate Stylish Outdoor Furniture Indoors

Compact outdoor furniture can also work wonders indoors. Pieces from a [garden furniture store](https://beta.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor) are often designed to save space, making them perfect for small apartments.

* Bistro Sets: Use a two-seater bistro set as a dining solution in your kitchen or balcony.
* Folding Rattan Chairs: Bring a boho-chic vibe into your home while keeping it space-efficient.

# 5. Use Mirrors to Create Illusions of Space

Mirrors are an excellent way to make a small room feel larger. Place a large mirror behind a sofa or dining area to reflect light and create the illusion of depth.

# 6. Choose Dual-Purpose Outdoor Furniture

For those with small outdoor areas, visit a garden furniture store for pieces that can be used both indoors and outdoors. For example:

* A rattan side table can double as a nightstand indoors or a coffee table on a balcony.
* Compact patio chairs can seamlessly transition between your indoor and outdoor seating areas.

# 7. Decorate Smartly for Compact Living

* Light Colors: Use light and neutral tones for furniture and walls to make the space feel open and airy.
* Minimal Decor: Stick to essential pieces that don‚Äôt overwhelm the room. A single statement side table or a well-placed piece of artwork can elevate the space.

# 8. Where to Find Small Space Furniture in Dubai

Dubai offers a wealth of options when it comes to space-saving furniture. From trendy home furniture Dubai stores to specialized garden furniture stores, you‚Äôll find stylish and functional pieces to suit compact living spaces. Look for lightweight, multifunctional, and compact designs that balance aesthetics and practicality.

# Final Thoughts

Living in a small space is all about smart planning and choosing the right furniture. Whether it‚Äôs a sleek rattan side table, a multi-functional sofa, or space-saving solutions from a garden furniture store, you can create a stylish and functional home, no matter the size.

The kitchen is often considered the heart of the home, where meals are prepared and memories are made. Whether you have a spacious kitchen or a cozy nook, the right accessories can completely transform the atmosphere and functionality of your space. From stylish [decor ](https://99wholesale.com/)

to practical tools, here are 10 kitchen accessories that will elevate both the look and feel of your kitchen.

# 1. Stylish Storage Solutions

One of the most practical and visually appealing [kitchen accessories](https://99wholesale.com/)

 is storage. Whether it's a set of sleek canisters for your pantry staples or elegant glass jars for spices, [storage accessories ](https://99wholesale.com/)

can both organize and decorate your kitchen. Opt for modern, stackable containers to keep your ingredients fresh while creating a uniform look that complements your kitchen decor. Wall-mounted racks and baskets are perfect for maximizing space, making them a must-have for kitchens of any size.

# 2. Chic Countertop Gadgets

Countertop gadgets are more than just functional ‚Äì they can add a touch of style to your kitchen. Think of a designer coffee maker, a vintage-inspired blender, or a sleek toaster that matches your overall kitchen accessories decor. These gadgets blend technology with aesthetics, turning everyday tools into statement pieces. A minimalist countertop can make a bold statement when accented with a few high-quality kitchen accessories, like a stylish knife block or a matching fruit bowl.

# 3. Elegant Kitchen Textiles

Kitchen textiles like towels, aprons, and oven mitts are simple yet effective accessories to refresh your kitchen decor. Opt for high-quality, color-coordinated textiles that match your theme. Soft cotton towels, embroidered tea towels, or a patterned apron can bring a pop of color to an otherwise neutral kitchen. These kitchen accessories not only add charm but also serve a practical purpose by protecting your hands and surfaces during meal prep.

# 4. Functional and Beautiful Lighting

Good lighting is essential for any kitchen, and the right lighting accessories can create a warm, inviting ambiance. Pendant lights over the kitchen island, under-cabinet lighting, or a statement chandelier can drastically improve your space. For smaller kitchens, consider wall-mounted or task lighting that helps you navigate cooking tasks with ease. Adjustable lighting can be both functional and stylish, transforming your kitchen from a workspace to a social hub.

# 5. Unique Wall Art and Decor

Adding personality to your kitchen doesn‚Äôt have to stop at your countertops and cabinets. Wall art and decor, such as framed prints, decorative plates, or rustic wooden signs, can bring life to your kitchen walls. If you have an open shelving system, consider incorporating decorative pieces like ceramic bowls, vases, or plants. These kitchen accessories decor ideas can create a focal point in the room and help tie your theme together, whether it's modern, farmhouse, or minimalist.

Tanya von Degurechaff Vs Will Treaty (Saga of Tanya the Evil Vs Rangers Apprentice)

location: Large forest

Set up: Both have been tasked with taking down the other


Preview:

‚ÄòWhere is this Ranger? I can't sense him anywhere‚Äô

Tanya drifted to the ground after flying over the forest for hours searching for her target. ‚ÄòWhen I get back to base I'm going to need a cup of good quality coffee‚Äô

Meanwhile slowly moving through the trees was a figure who, without a ounce of magic, gently moved through the forest without a sound as their features, height, and even shape all vanished into the background. However the figure didn't approach Tanya. 

‚ÄòSorry, but this mission takes priority over my desires‚Äô Regretfully the figure took out his bow slowly and carefully as Tanya was taking a few minutes to rest with a drink of water. 

When the figure pulled the bow back the wood of the longbow creaked and Tanya shot around firing her rifle in a warning shot, the loud shot and bullet flying past causing Will's arrow to miss its mark. Both shots only grazed the clothes of the two soldiers.

‚ÄúLooks like I'll get to go back sooner than I thought‚Äù 

‚ÄòThat was close! I can't let her take flight again‚Äô

Will dashed forward as his cloak billowed out behind him as if dragging the very forest behind himself. Hands pulling out his saxe and throwing knives to force her to stay on the ground. 

Tanya took a moment to take in the situation as Will covered the distance between them quickly. She didn't have time to pull out her submachine gun or to move her rifle into a usable position without leaving herself open. So she reached behind herself and pulled out a foldable shovel to engage in close combat. ‚ÄòHe can't just have simple weaponry. He must be hiding something in that cloak of his. I'll have to hold back for now until I verify his gear‚Äô

So we asked the estate agent why the house was empty and they claimed 'oh no the vendors live here, they're just out whilst we have the viewing'. Similarly asked why they're selling, responded vaguely with ""oh they're just looking to get somewhere new"".

The real kicker is that the house is identical to the photos taken for the advert 2 months ago, even down to the position of a book on the coffee table.

I feel like the estate agent is hiding something but not sure on how to proceed. We like the house but don't want to end up with a challenging purchase process (like the seller being long distance and slow to respond).

These elements not only add style but also provide comfort and functionality to your space. Here‚Äôs a guide to help you choose the best **pouf** and [rugs for your living room](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs) while incorporating cozy and practical solutions for your home.

# 1. Understanding the Role of Poufs and Rugs

* **Poufs**: These versatile pieces of furniture can serve as extra seating, a footrest, or even a coffee table when paired with a tray. They‚Äôre available in various styles, materials, and colors to complement any living room decor.
* **Rugs for Living Room**: Rugs are more than just decorative pieces‚Äîthey help define spaces, anchor furniture, and provide warmth and texture to your floor. The right rug can bring balance and harmony to your living room.

# 2. How to Choose the Perfect Pouf

# Size and Functionality

* For smaller living rooms, choose compact poufs that don‚Äôt overwhelm the space.
* In larger areas, opt for oversized poufs or multiple smaller ones to create additional seating or fill empty corners.

# Material and Style

* **Fabric Poufs**: Add a cozy, casual vibe with cotton or wool poufs.
* **Leather Poufs**: Perfect for modern or industrial designs, they add a sleek and sophisticated touch.
* **Knitted Poufs**: Ideal for boho or rustic interiors, offering texture and charm.

# Color and Pattern

* Select a pouf that complements your [carpet for the living room](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs). For instance, if your rug is vibrant, choose a neutral-colored pouf. Conversely, a bold pouf can add interest to a neutral rug.

# 3. How to Choose the Right Rug for Your Living Room

# Size Matters

* Ensure your **rug for the living room** is large enough to anchor the main furniture pieces. Ideally, it should extend under the front legs of your sofa and chairs.
* In smaller spaces, consider a rug that fits under the coffee table and leaves some floor exposed to create a sense of openness.

# Material and Durability

* **Wool Rugs**: Durable and soft, wool is an excellent choice for high-traffic living rooms.
* **Cotton Rugs**: Lightweight and easy to clean, ideal for casual spaces.
* **Jute or Sisal Rugs**: Perfect for natural and rustic aesthetics, these materials add texture to your living room.

# Design and Color

* Choose patterns and colors that complement your furniture and walls. For instance:
   * A neutral rug creates a calming effect and works well in minimalist spaces.
   * Bold patterns or vibrant colors can act as a statement piece in a neutral room.

# 4. How to Pair Poufs with Rugs

To achieve a cohesive look, consider these tips:

* **Matching Textures**: Pair a knitted pouf with a soft, textured **carpet for the living room** for a cozy vibe.
* **Contrasting Colors**: A brightly colored pouf can pop against a neutral rug, while a subtle pouf can tone down a bold rug.
* **Layering Patterns**: If your rug has intricate patterns, choose a solid-colored pouf to balance the design.

# 5. Extending the Look to Other Spaces

While this guide focuses on the living room, you can use the same principles to choose [bedroom rugs](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs) and poufs:

* **Bedroom Rugs**: Add warmth and comfort by placing a soft rug under your bed or on either side. Opt for materials like shag or wool for a plush feel.
* **Poufs in Bedrooms**: Use a pouf as a stylish accent near a reading nook or as a footrest for a chair in your bedroom.

# 6. Practical Tips for Maintenance

* **Rug Care**: Vacuum regularly to prevent dirt buildup. For natural fibers like wool or jute, spot-clean spills immediately to avoid stains.
* **Pouf Maintenance**: Choose poufs with removable covers for easy cleaning. For leather poufs, wipe them down with a damp cloth to maintain their sheen.

# Final Thoughts

The right **pouf** and **rugs for your living room** can enhance both the style and functionality of your space. By carefully selecting complementary designs, materials, and colors, you can create a cohesive and inviting atmosphere. Whether you‚Äôre looking for a bold statement piece or something subtle to tie the room together, your choices in **carpet for the living room** and poufs can make all the difference.

I'm reaching my limit before I have a gigantic meltdown. Looking for any and all advice.


Hey, not sure how this will be received honestly. I always feel like such a waster when I open up about the fact I'm autistic to anyone other than close friends. I don't outwardly appear severely autistic so a lot of time people think I'm joking with them. 

I only got 'disgnosed' I guess when I was 17, so I'm still figuring out things now even 6 years later. My GP doesn't dabble with anything mental health so I'll never be autistic enough to get back any sort of benefits from it. Which, I don't want to claim anyway. I don't want to sit around at home all day doing nothing. But any workplace I can get into is a sensory nightmare. And no employer seems to want to accommodate that fact. 

I'm not being picky with jobs, I'll take anything once it means I'm not on the dole. I've years experince with customer service and food (Deli & Kitchens) as well as Barista. I think this has backfired on me right now. Recently got a new job and they are unwilling to accommodate a 'no music aloud' (speaker) out in a coffee hut. When I did my interview (day 1) and when I signed the contract (day 2) there was never music out there. 3 weeks into the job and there still wasn't. Now all of a sudden we're being told to play music out there all the time. 

I didn't have any reasonable expectation that there was going to be music played on a staff member's speaker. If there was I wouldn't have taken the job there and just went with another shit paying job. But now all the jobs have been snatched up in my area and I am very close from having a very big meltdown. I can't afford to take any days off work or to have that meltdown and I'm a loss of what to do.

This always happens. I don't think I'm capable of working 40 hours a week. I burn out after 3 days entirely. But what can I even do? GP won't deal with it. Don't think there's meds for the issue I'm having anyway. 

I've no qualifications or education to change career paths. Are there any other autists here that could even offer advice on how they manage? There's so little resources for young adults with autism in ireland. It's hard to even talk to regular normal people about this because it's 'just music' at the end of the day. Like this is my problem and I don't know how to cope. ",1,1734592319.0,AskIreland,5,0.67,False

Stress. That ever-present, invisible force that can wreak havoc on our lives. It impacts our sleep, our eating habits, our relationships, and, you guessed it, even our breath. We often associate bad breath with poor oral hygiene or certain foods, but we rarely consider the connection between our mental state and the air we exhale. It's a subtle link, but a powerful one nonetheless. This article delves into the surprising connection between stress and bad breath, exploring the physiological mechanisms at play, and offering practical solutions to reclaim your fresh breath and inner peace. We'll uncover how stress hormones can dry out your mouth, creating a breeding ground for odor-causing bacteria. We'll also discuss how stress can indirectly lead to bad breath through changes in lifestyle, such as altered eating patterns and neglected oral hygiene. Get ready to breathe a sigh of relief as we unravel the mystery of bad breath from stress and equip you with the tools to combat it.

Bad Breath From Stress: The Silent Saboteur
-------------------------------------------

Stress is like a sneaky gremlin, messing with all sorts of things behind the scenes. You see the obvious effects ‚Äì the tension headaches, the sleepless nights, the irritability ‚Äì but sometimes its impact is more subtle. One of these stealthy side effects? Bad breath. Yep, that stress monster can turn your breath into something less than pleasant. But why? How can a mental state affect something seemingly so physical? The answer lies in a complex interplay of hormones, dry mouth, and behavioral changes. Let's break it down.

### The Science Behind Stress and Halitosis

When you're stressed, your body kicks into ""fight-or-flight"" mode, flooding your system with adrenaline and cortisol. These hormones, while essential for survival in truly dangerous situations, can wreak havoc on your oral health when chronically elevated. One major culprit is dry mouth, or xerostomia. Saliva is your mouth's natural cleanser, washing away food particles and neutralizing odor-causing bacteria. But stress hormones reduce saliva production, creating a dry, sticky environment where bacteria thrive. Think of it like a stagnant pond ‚Äì not exactly the freshest smelling thing!

- **Cortisol's Role:** Cortisol, the primary stress hormone, directly impacts saliva production. Increased cortisol levels signal your body to conserve water, diverting resources away from saliva production. This lack of saliva allows bacteria to flourish, leading to that dreaded bad breath.
- **The Bacterial Boom:** Our mouths are home to a diverse ecosystem of bacteria, some helpful and some, well, not so much. When stress dries out your mouth, the balance shifts, giving the odor-causing bacteria the upper hand. These bacteria feast on leftover food particles and release volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs), the very source of that unpleasant smell. It's like a microscopic party in your mouth, and you‚Äôre definitely not invited!

### Lifestyle Changes and Their Impact

""SECRET of Fresh breath https://freepage.pro/samutores/freshbreath""

Beyond the direct physiological effects, stress can also indirectly contribute to bad breath by influencing our habits. When we‚Äôre stressed, we might be more likely to:

1. **Skip Brushing and Flossing:** Let‚Äôs be honest, when you're feeling overwhelmed, oral hygiene might be the last thing on your mind. Unfortunately, neglecting these essential habits creates a perfect breeding ground for bacteria, exacerbating bad breath.
2. **Reach for Comfort Foods:** Stress-eating often involves sugary snacks and processed foods, which bacteria love. These foods provide a readily available source of fuel for those odor-producing microbes.
3. **Increase Caffeine and Alcohol Intake:** Both caffeine and alcohol can dehydrate you, further contributing to dry mouth and bad breath. That morning coffee and evening glass of wine might be helping you cope in the moment, but they could be adding to your breath woes.
4. **Smoke More:** For smokers, stress can lead to increased cigarette consumption. Smoking not only dries out the mouth but also introduces a host of chemicals that contribute to bad breath and other oral health problems.

Bad Breath From Stress: Breaking the Cycle
------------------------------------------

Now that we understand the link between stress and bad breath, what can we do about it? Luckily, there are several strategies to tackle this issue and reclaim fresh breath. It's a holistic approach, addressing both the physical and mental aspects of the problem.

### Managing Stress for Fresher Breath

Dealing with the root cause of the problem ‚Äì stress itself ‚Äì is paramount. Here are some proven stress management techniques:

- **Mindfulness and Meditation:** Taking a few minutes each day to focus on your breath and quiet your mind can significantly reduce stress levels. Think of it as a mini-vacation for your mind, and a breath of fresh air for your mouth.
- **Exercise:** Physical activity is a fantastic stress reliever. Whether it‚Äôs a brisk walk, a yoga class, or a dance party in your living room, moving your body helps release endorphins, those feel-good chemicals that combat stress.
- **Adequate Sleep:** Sleep deprivation exacerbates stress, creating a vicious cycle. Prioritizing sleep helps regulate your hormones, including those that affect saliva production. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night.
- **Connecting with Others:** Talking to a friend, family member, or therapist can provide emotional support and help you manage stress. Sometimes, just venting your frustrations can make a world of difference.

### Boosting Oral Hygiene for a Healthier Mouth

While managing stress is crucial, don't neglect the basics of good oral hygiene:

1. **Hydration is Key:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day to keep your mouth moist and wash away food particles. Carry a water bottle with you as a reminder.
2. **Brush and Floss Regularly:** Brush twice a day for two minutes each time, and floss at least once a day. This removes food debris and plaque, preventing bacteria from thriving.
3. **Tongue Scraping:** Don‚Äôt forget your tongue! A tongue scraper can remove bacteria and debris that contribute to bad breath.
4. **Chew Sugar-Free Gum:** Chewing gum stimulates saliva production, helping to neutralize acids and wash away bacteria. Opt for sugar-free varieties to avoid feeding the bad bacteria.
5. **Regular Dental Checkups:** Visit your dentist for regular checkups and cleanings. They can identify and address any underlying oral health issues that may be contributing to bad breath.

Bad Breath From Stress: Don‚Äôt Let it Get You Down
-------------------------------------------------

Bad breath from stress might seem like a small thing, but it can impact your confidence and social interactions. By understanding the connection between stress and oral health, you can take proactive steps to address the root cause and enjoy fresh breath with confidence. It's not just about masking the odor; it's about tackling the underlying stress that's causing it in the first place. Remember, you're not alone in this. Many people experience bad breath from stress, and there are effective solutions available.

""SECRET of Fresh breath https://freepage.pro/samutores/freshbreath""

Don't let stress steal your fresh breath and your peace of mind. By incorporating stress management techniques and maintaining good oral hygiene, you can break the cycle and breathe easy again. So, take a deep breath (a fresh one, hopefully!), and start implementing these strategies today. Your mouth (and your mind) will thank you. What are you waiting for? Your journey towards fresher breath and a calmer mind starts now!

In conclusion, bad breath from stress is a common yet often overlooked issue. The interplay of stress hormones, dry mouth, and lifestyle changes creates a perfect storm for odor-causing bacteria to thrive. By acknowledging the connection between our mental and oral health, we can take proactive steps to address the root cause and reclaim our fresh breath. Managing stress through techniques like mindfulness, exercise, and adequate sleep is crucial. Coupled with consistent oral hygiene practices, these strategies empower us to combat bad breath and improve our overall well-being. Remember, a healthy mouth reflects a healthy mind. Take control of your stress, and breathe easy knowing you're on the path to a fresher, healthier you.",1,1734591659.0,FreshBreathChampion,0,1.0,False
1hhn81l,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1hhn81l/my_father_is_going_insane/,My father is going insane ,"Me(19M): So yesterday my father went to a Mandir(place of worship) at 8am and he returned home at 7pm. Upon calling me he told me he was in some meeting. But he hadn't returned home after going and literally went out in slippers. After my mother came home from work we called and he tells us he's in some other place for work. 2 hours later he said he was in another meeting and my mother was questioning him repeatedly about what he ate so finally told us that he's only had 2 cups of tea the entire day. He returned home silently at 7pm. I had gone to my friends house and returned home by 11. He didn't tell anything to mother or my grandma about where he was. The next morning my grandma tells me what my mother came to know. Apparently he has been pickpocketing things from multiple stores near my house. He was arrested on his way to the mandir and somehow returned back at 7pm. She also revealed that she knew he had been doing this for a long time but didn't know it would come down to this. I don't know what my mother thinks of all this or should I even talk to her about it. My father usually on a fight with mum would say absurd things about her parents; things that happened 25 yrs ago and have no relevance bringing up now or he would state why he keeps her parents( my maternal grandmother & grandfather) blocked. This is the 2nd time he's done something like this. The first time I saw it was when he wasn't getting payment for the interior work that he's done for a client living outside country and had a flat in our residentual complex. Since he wasn't paying a due sum of 60k (He had paid 400,000 and only 60k was left). The next day he changed their house's lock. The client his wife coming back from abroad and she would pay a cheque over a cup of coffee with him. However the client beforehand had called my father a ""bastard"" for some reason I don't know which idk why he took it personally and kept bring up. At midnight he tells me to come with him for some work. In the name of work he decided to commit a property theft on them saying he wouldn't give back their things that were in their house until they've paid 60k. I kept telling him it's a stupid idea. But he said it'll be fine he needs to get what he's owed. We fill all the goods in his car.Then he asked me to go with him again saying the stove must be worth some and that we should also keep it against them. He also wanted to check whether the clients wife had arrived or not. Upon arriving we see security guards breaking open the door. On seeing this he said some of the most stupid things I've ever Heard like ""they're outsiders"" and ""they don't care about you"" and took a video of all their faces. At that instant the wife arrived and he was trying to get her too on the video saying things like it's wrong and it shouldn't be allowed. I pushed him over inside the lift. And took him back home angrily. He was apparently texting egoistic things to that client the whole night. The next day the residential authorities filed a complaint against him and he could have been arrested but thanks to a third party he wasn't. This was days before the pickpocket arrest. It's almost like he wanted to get in. The word spread out in the whole complex. He's had a record for having the most absurd fights and i don't feel like meeting/ talking to any of the people I know in my complex after hearing these. I almost feel like anyday they'll bring it up. Yesterday while he was gone from home I was having negative thoughts that he had snapped or something and started crying for being such a stupid son and not stopping him from doing property theft as it had really put a word on him over the complex. It directly affects his work as he gets orders of interior works from complexes like these. This is very hard for me to process i haven't still reacted strangely in any way on hearing it. 
PS: between 2019 and 2024 he had lost multiple jobs some because of someone bribing to upper management for the role and some because he had a really shitty boss or it was tradition for them to change employee every 6 months. He seeks orders desperately since then. But given his ways I don't know what might happen in 2 years of my family. His behaviour can be very hyper and his actions are just wrong to me.

I‚Äôm sorry for the understanding I showed during the many times suspicions arose, suspicions I never voiced, though perhaps I should have. 

I‚Äôm sorry for not confronting you when anyone else, regardless of gender or identity, might have demanded answers. 

I‚Äôm sorry for holding your hair back, rubbing your back while you were sick, taking care of you so tenderly in those vulnerable moments.

I‚Äôm sorry for opening doors for you felt you like a gentleman, and using constant manners‚Äî‚Äúyes, please‚Äù and ‚Äúno thank you.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm sorry for being a gentleman in general.

I‚Äôm sorry for absorbing the hurtful words you threw my way, each one like a shard of glass, cutting deep‚Äî‚Äúdon‚Äôt ever fucking talk to me again,‚Äù ‚Äúwe‚Äôre fucking done,‚Äù ‚ÄúI fucking hate you,‚Äù ‚Äúyou fucking bitch,‚Äù ‚Äúyou entitled piece of shit.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm sorry that I didn‚Äôt endure more instead of expressing how your hurtful  words and diatribe‚Äôs inflicted wounds and subsequent scars. 

I‚Äôm sorry for always treating your family and friends with kindness, respect, and genuine interest. For the hours I spent making your condo spotless, every corner, every room‚Äîeven the toilets and beneath your bed where dust and hair collected over years of neglect. 

I‚Äôm sorry for standing up for you to others, going as far as filing a police report to ensure your safety when you felt threatened, or paranoid by a homeless man who never once approached or spoke to you.

I‚Äôm sorry for crafting surprise dates and for uttering words that moved you to tears, words that touched you in ways I never imagined possible. 

I‚Äôm sorry for singing to you, for the times we harmonized or when you broke down over songs your father loved, without me knowing their significant.

I‚Äôm sorry I called you the missing price to my puzzle.

I‚Äôm sorry that I dedicated Songbird by Fleetwood Mac to you and you got emotional because your father loved that song but also would play it for you when you were a kid. I‚Äôm sorry you never shared this with me, but I‚Äôm sorry I reminded you of your father. 

I‚Äôm sorry I was the man you said your deceased father would have adored. 

Im sorry for getting pet insurance for your dog, for ensuring she was well-cared for with new food and vet visits. 

I‚Äôm sorry for the one time I forgot my wallet after a vet visit, prompting you to call me cheap‚ÄîI never intended to upset you. I‚Äôm sorry you were so angry after that. 

I‚Äôm sorry for the weekly  journeys I made by train and bus, traveling to be with you every Thursday through Sunday, sacrificing my time and comfort.

I‚Äôm sorry for never questioning the absence of photos from your ‚Äúgirls trips‚Äù and for being subjected to your anger each time I asked about friends whose names I never learned.

I‚Äôm sorry you chose baby names and pressured me into having sex with you in order to potentially get you pregnant, even though I wasn‚Äôt ready because it was still early on, and because we needed to figure a lot out still for me to be in a place where I felt we were both ready for that. Actually‚Ä¶ I did, several times. I even ensured I didn‚Äôt finish inside of you because my boundaries were routinely being crossed, and you continued.

I‚Äôm sorry for performing oral on you when you would demand and curse at me to do so explicitly. Do you  Remember when you bragged about demanding it later that one day before the Halloween party? I‚Äôm sorry you shared that with me. 

I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt  get you pregnant, even though you weren‚Äôt ready to be a mother. I‚Äôm sorry you still had to confront your reality and the truth of your reality before bringing a child into the world. 

I‚Äôm sorry that I didn‚Äôt get you pregnant while there were disturbing things occurring behind my back during the entire duration of our relationship, and bringing a child into that situation would‚Äôve been disturbing. I‚Äôm sorry I felt that way. 

I‚Äôm sorry that when you would grab my hips and pull me in closer while I was finishing, even as I physically resisted, all while telling me to ‚Äúget you pregnant‚Äù and to ‚Äúfill you up.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm sorry you had a manic look in your eyes when you would do that every time we had sex after the first month or dating and until the implosion‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm sorry for feeling powerless in those moments, for not knowing how to assert myself by telling you what tou were doing frightened me.

I‚Äôm sorry for not giving in towards the end of us, to your physical force which you would use with me inn during  these moments.  I was scared of you , and for how deeply that crossed my boundaries.

I‚Äôm sorry that you didn‚Äôt get pregnant and therefore couldn‚Äôt get out of the things you were doing behind my back, or the life you were secretly leading, Heisenberg. 

I‚Äôm sorry you weren‚Äôt honest with me. I would‚Äôve rescued you from that life.

I‚Äôm sorry that I could have financially took care of you forever, and protected you forever as I promised I would‚Äôve. 

I‚Äôm sorry you picked lonely old men and their money, to fake attraction and relationships, even love with them. 

I‚Äôm sorry that the money you make doing this doesn‚Äôt change how alone and lonely you‚Äôve been and you‚Äôll always be? Who knows‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm sorry that when you talked about and would plan our future, you beamed with a smile that could light up the world, dreaming of beating your sister to the altar or into motherhood. I‚Äôm sorry for how much of a savage your sister is. I‚Äôm sorry how horrible the relationship is and always will be between the two of you. 

I‚Äôm sorry for discussing marriage and homes in neighborhoods where you wanted to live, even though my job was an hour away. 

I‚Äôm sorry I put an offer on one of those eight million dollar homes two days before it all imploded.

I‚Äôm sorry I purchased one to the Tiffany engagement rings that you loved. Remember? During the second weekend we were together? we went to Tiffany‚Äôs, and I wrote down your favourite engagement rings. I always kept that piece of paper for a reason. 

I‚Äôm sorry I bought it and planned the proposal that never happened. 

I‚Äôm sorry for inquiring about your ‚Äúbusiness,‚Äù offering help with marketing, using my MBA and business acumen to support you, only to be met with evasion and silence. I‚Äôm sorry for questioning the lack of social media updates for two years for your ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôm sorry you were reluctant to speak of clients. Even when I just asked how work was going.

I‚Äôm sorry for being okay when you brushed me off after my aunt passed, for respecting your busy schedule over my grief. 

I‚Äôm sorry for always valuing your feelings, your emotions, even when they were wielded like weapons against me‚ÄîI‚Äôm not a fighter, except when it comes to defending my heart.

I‚Äôm sorry you didn‚Äôt have more time to manipulate, gaslight, and abuse me. 

I‚Äôm sorry for the way your life is built on lies and deceit, for cheating on someone who loved you more than you could comprehend, all while living a double life and lying to everyone in their life, all while being workings as an escort. 

I‚Äôm sorry you lied prior to us even meeting. 

I‚Äôm sorry you posed as someone you weren‚Äôt seeking a long term relationship on Hinge. 

I‚Äôm sorry you never were honest with me because I would‚Äôve asked you to quit, not have been made by your cheating, and we could‚Äôve moved on by having and fulfilling the dreams we constantly discussed, which you always initiated even. 

I‚Äôm sorry that you weren‚Äôt more creative with your front for a career and small business. 

I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt ask you more about the ‚Äúbuddies‚Äù you would constantly or randomly have and I would get upset despite never meeting them or knowing their names, or anything about them.

I‚Äôm sorry most of them likely wear elderly diapers, and have grey public hair. 

I‚Äôm sorry that you would get upset for me asking any further questions about your ‚Äúbuddies‚Äù after you brought the buddies (lol the word gets me still). 

I‚Äôm sorry that you would have likely have to change their diapers, and honestly, you should have just became a nurse instead.

I‚Äôm sorry for the marriages you destroyed and the children left without a father. Did that make you feel better for the tragic loss of your father? 

Im sorry that while on the phone, you threatened to jump off your balcony, and then left me on the other end, as you opened your balcony door, and I cried, begged, pleaded for you to be okay and not hurt herself for eight minutes that were the scariest eight fucking minutes of my life.

I‚Äôm sorry that when I threatened to call the police, you finally came back to the phone and pretended that you never threatened to jump off your balcony.

I‚Äôm sorry you accused me of wanting you to get better. I‚Äôm sorry you accused me of ‚Äúwanting you committed‚Äù, even though that wasn‚Äôt true and you never were committed, nor did anyone ever approach you about committing yourself. 

I‚Äôm sorry for you creating random fights between us, somehow making them my fault, and for me giving in and apologizing afterwards despite you conjuring these random fights to create space for a couple days between us so you could hang out with your buddies and get paid I suppose? I‚Äôm sorry for what they likely did to you.. I‚Äôm sorry there‚Äôs reviews online about your performance.

I‚Äôm sorry about one reviewer detailing how you were in bed with them three days after my birthday. 

I‚Äôm sorry that I would‚Äôve given you the financial freedom and wealth in addition to ensuring that you were the happiest woman to ever take a single breath on this earth. 

I‚Äôm sorry that you decided being an escort and being paid by lonely men was more important than what we had built and what you had told me you wanted for your life with me‚Ä¶ our life. 

I‚Äôm sorry that confronting you after being sent confirmation of who you really were randomly one morning.

I‚Äôm sorry that I always hoped, and fucking wished it was just a suspicion and I‚Äôm sorry for keeping it to myself without being resentful either. 

I‚Äôm sorry your sister had the same suspicions two years prior and you slapped her across the face for ‚Äúeven insinuating I would be a fucking hooker, a whore, or an escort‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm sorry that me knowing made you anxious because of your unwillingness to ever get help for your anxiety and paranoids.

I‚Äôm sorry your feared your sister‚Äôs judgment, even though your sister abuses her fianc√© daily and hasn‚Äôt even shown a person, or even her dog an ounce of kindness for even one second of her life. 

I‚Äôm sorry you put her potentially finding out even though she wouldn‚Äôt have, over the person who loved you more than any family, friend, ex boyfriend or girlfriend..: and buddy! Ever has or ever would have.

I‚Äôm sorry your sister will have to wait a little longer before she finds out the truth.

 I‚Äôm sorry for your loss false, horrific, disgusting, and appalling false accusations against me, which l led to me being arrested because I knew the truth.

I‚Äôm sorry you pretended to love me you went as far as to not only blanatntly lie  because as you would say, ‚Äúno one will ever believe a man could be abused by a woman. 

I‚Äôm sorry you use this twisted mentality twice against me just because you broke my heart and cheated on me for a year, all just to silence me not just from your abuse, but for your disaster of a sister not kicking you outbid her wedding party and disowning you for life.

I‚Äôm sorry she will regardless, because she‚Äôs an evil and jealous person.  

I‚Äôm sorry that I wrote these letters in my mind for each of the two 25 hour stints in jail, which caused me having uproot my life, forget what privacy is, ever think about romance and the learning the concept of trust is a waste of time and no one should or can be trusted again. 

I‚Äôm sorry you taught me that everyone‚Äôs actually evil.

I‚Äôm sorry I never crossed any boundaries with you of any kind, and I have all your texts that contradict your allegations. I‚Äôm sorry these texts also explicitly show that you were the blanat abuser in every manner‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôm sorry you won‚Äôt be coming up with these letters, or anything creative while you spend a large part of the rest of your life behind bars. I‚Äôm sorry that you‚Äôre not creative, emotionally available, or charismatic enough for people to care about whatever you may have to say about a tik tok video you saw before you went to prison. 

I‚Äôm sorry you never became the influencer you thought you could be despite not having anything to say or interesting character traits that anyone would care about. I‚Äôm sorry you thought this was possible despite your regular eight likes on tik tok. 

I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt want to break bail again and spend the holidays and beyond, in a jail cell, while I‚Äôm still in a mental prison without physically being in a jail or prison cell.

I‚Äôm sorry you wore my clothes in a TikTok shortly after my first arrest and flaunted your life as if my world hadn‚Äôt shattered. Im sorry how un-credible of a witness you won‚Äôt ever get a chance to be‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôm sorry we didn‚Äôt meet years earlier, when we lived across the street, shopped at the same stores, banked at the same place, walked our dogs in the same neighborhood. I wish I could have steered you away from the path you chose, even though I didn‚Äôt know you then.

I would‚Äôve saved and protected you. I would‚Äôve never left‚Ä¶ ever.

I‚Äôm sorry you didn‚Äôt apologize when I confronted you upon finding out the day before I confronted you.

I‚Äôm sorry you sought out killing me and attempting to ruin my life as a better alternative.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù‚Ä¶ the words you believe every one, even people you‚Äôve never met and won‚Äôt ever meet owe you for reasons that you don‚Äôt even understand. 

You‚Äôre not the victim of any previous, current and future delusion. 

No one owes you as many sorry‚Äôs as you believe that all eight billion people on earth owe you.

You need to learn how to apologize to yourself first, for the people you‚Äôve literally killed and hurt, shattered, torn apart, cheated on, and discarded them like the gunk stuck to your shitty samba‚Äôs a 75 year old paraplegic likely got you after you gave them a happy ending. 

Apologize to your family for your lies of a decade or longer, apologize to your sister for assaulting her, to the mother you abandoned and blocked, all while leaving her with an apparent abuser (your words). 

You won‚Äôt. Or maybe‚Ä¶ fuck me‚Ä¶ fuck me for believing that you want to scream into the void because you‚Äôre fully aware of the damage you‚Äôve caused throughout your adult life to everyone you‚Äôve crossed paths with, and an amazing person is there. I saw her many times and I wanted to fucking hug you to through FaceTime the night before we last spoke because I saw a person who was destroyed, and desperately hurting because of the secret they harboured, and perhaps the dangerous, and evil people within their orbit who they wished died so you could live without fear any longer and be your true, loving, amazing, and strong individual that you truly fucking are.

Despite everything, you remain a beautiful person, inside and out. I see the good in you, the potential for happiness and health, if only you hadn‚Äôt destroyed what we had. Your father would want you to be okay.

I remember the night you asked me to promise to always protect you and never leave, and how I held you as tears streamed down my face.

In that embrace, I felt your anxiety, your fear, your loneliness, and I promised to always love you, more than all the galaxies out there, even those that haven‚Äôt been discovered yet. 

‚ÄúMore than the aliens?‚Äù you asked, our little joke. Yes, more than those aliens you adore. ‚ÄúI love you, and I‚Äôll love you forever. I‚Äôll never let you go.

I‚Äôm NOT sorry for still loving you and believing in you, and my fucking heart. 

I‚Äôm NOT sorry for the moment I finally get to tell you how much I love you again. 

I‚Äôm NOT and how I told you that I would always protect you, even after everything that you‚Äôve done. 

I‚Äôm NOT sorry for abandoning you like everyone else has throughout your life. 

I‚Äôm NOT sorry for saving you and showing you how beautiful life can be, or for teaching you that  every day doesn‚Äôt have to be dark like Alaska. 

You‚Äôre beyond worthy of your yellow brick road.

I‚Äôm sure as fuck NOT sorry for believing in love. ",1,1734591633.0,justpoetry,0,1.0,False
1hhn6n8,https://i.redd.it/9rk673d47r7e1.jpeg,Matcha Chocolate chip cookies ,"Matcha Chocolate chip cookies: the weirdest most tasty cookies you'll ever try according to some musician in Seattle I made them for!

In accordance with the recipes on the internet I shall regale you with my life's story first. It was a hot summer evening in the dilapidated state of Kansas, 2018, when I longed for the sweet earthy taste of matcha but also cookies, and I thought to myself 'self, how can one enjoy these two pleasures in one simple easy to go form without the overly warm and complicated handling of juggling tea AND cookies? Ah, if only such a miracle could be had, then I could win the affections of the love of my life - tiktok musician in Seattle guy.' Then, like the clanging thunder of a million hipsters slamming open a vegan coffee shop door, it struck me: who said one couldn't just combine the two into one delicious cookie!? Surely, possibly, this divine treat would gain me my loves attention and I would forever be remembered by him! After all, who wouldn't love a delicious handmade snack full of matcha and love? 

And thusly, my experimentation began. It took many failed batches to find the proper combination, and just when I began to lose hope, I found someone else's recipe online and simply copied it myself. However, they called for WHITE CHOCOLATE CHIPS.

THE. AUDACITY.

Fear not, dear readers, for I didn't balk at this rebellious act of treason against the good name of sweets. I did what any chocolate lover would do, and substituted the heinous abomination for Ghirardelli milk and dark chocolate chips, half a cup of each, to create the most amazing new cookie I've ever tried.

To create a control group, I baked about 300 of them, and brought them to my emergency room at the hospital in which I worked, leaving them on the counter in the employee lounge with a note that said to help yourselves. Within an hour they were gone and I had around 45 requests for my recipe. It was truly a successful test batch. However the real test had only begun.

I baked another batch and drove the 1200 miles to Seattle. It was an arduous and back breaking journey, but as I am dedicated to my purpose I arrived safely with cookies in tow, and passed them off eagerly to my musician friend whom I adored quite ardently.

He was curious and bewildered at first, never having seen such confusing cookies, but as he took a bite his eyes grew alit with a glow akin to the sun. He fancied them so much he couldn't help but gush about how amazing they were, and hugged me tightly. Ah, my plan worked, my cookies successfully placed me higher upon my dearest friend's heart and stomach. 

It's true what they say: the way to a man's heart is through his stomach. There is truly not matcha you can not do with these cookies.

Ingredients

2 cups of all-purpose flour

1 tablespoon of¬†Epic Matcha green tea powder

¬Ω teaspoon of baking soda

¬Ω teaspoon of salt

1 cup of packed brown sugar

¬æ cup of melted and unsalted butter

¬Ω cup of granulated sugar

1 tablespoon of pure vanilla extract

1 egg

1 egg yolk

1 cups of chocolate chips

Directions

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Grease baking sheets or line with parchment paper.

Sift Epic Matcha green tea powder, flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.

Beat brown sugar, butter, and granulated sugar together in a large bowl. (It‚Äôs best to use an electric mixer.)

Fold in vanilla extract, egg, and egg yolk until the mixture is light, creamy, and free of clumps.

Mix flour mixture in with creamed butter.

Continuing mixing until dough is blended.

Add chocolate chips and mix lightly until chips are found evenly throughout the dough.

Use a tablespoon to form cookies, leaving 2‚Äì3 inches in between each serving.

Bake in the oven until edges are lightly browned, an average of 8‚Äì10 minutes.

Let cool on baking sheet for a few minutes before moving to a wire rack to cool completely

1hhn6hm,https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/1hhn6hm/a_stranger_cried_to_me_in_a_coffee_shop/,A stranger cried to me in a coffee shop,"Is this what it's like for those of you who unknowingly invite people to open up to you uninvited?

I was just waiting for my drink to be made so I could run back to work. This older gentleman said something like ""You ready for Christmas?"" and a full 20 minutes later I knew his entire life's story, traumas, diagnoses, medications, what degrees he has, and his greatest regrets in life. At one point he said his mom had died a few years ago and he teared up and sniffled. He would ask me questions from time to time so he wasn't purely just dumping info on me. 

I assume this man regularly over shares with strangers and isn't quite mentally well, but I wondered if this is how it feels for some of you who tend to attract this kind of random over sharing. I thought about asking if he'd like a hug. It kind of seemed like the human thing to do. He was clearly desperate for human connection. But also he was a total stranger and not quite well, so I didn't. I was having a rough morning and felt pretty drained after that. But I also hope I made him feel seen, and I appreciated the break from the painful small talk that normally peppers my day.

1hhn64i,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMentalist/comments/1hhn64i/never_a_bookmark/,Never a Bookmark,"So reading through these posts, a couple of ideas came up.  One was the question of what to watch for on a rewatch. Another mentioned the books that Cho and Jane are reading; people were curious about what books they were and I was curious as well.  So I started out with that on my next rewatch, searching for the names of the books they were reading.    The problem was that often times they talked about the books they were reading without showing the book.  The harder problem was that often when they show the book, it is out of focus or illegible or they just showed the text and not the title.  So I tried to figure them out.  So I got carried away.  And by carried away, I mean I just started looking for any books that were visible enough to identify anywhere in the show and any talked about or just seen.  I‚Äôve made this list with notes about where the books are, if I think they are real (very few are not), who was reading them or where they were located and who the author is, if I could figure it out.  I may have missed some of these notes; please forgive me if you spot errors. There were, of course bookshelves that I couldn‚Äôt decipher titles from, and Jane even talked specifically about ‚Äúbooks on criminal psychiatry there,‚Äù during the Pilot, referring to Red John references that clearly he had read, but I have no book names for.  I decided early on to list *every* book.  I used Amazon as my reference; my apologies if your library has a copy of a book I listed as not real. Quick reference guide for those actually reading the book mentioned- J for Patrick Jane, C for Kimball Cho, and R for Wayne Rigsby.  If an author isn‚Äôt listed, I couldn‚Äôt figure it out.  Some books, I just couldn‚Äôt decipher the title.  My apologies for the length of this, but here goes:

I believe everything is configured correctly, but I can‚Äôt find the sensor in Home Assistant. At this point, I think it‚Äôs better to pay someone to get me started instead of spending more hours troubleshooting and getting increasingly frustrated.

I‚Äôm happy buy you a coffee or two (via buy me a coffee) or contribute a small amount to a project or charity of your choice in exchange for your help. If this sounds like something you can assist with, please get in touch!

**Project Details:**

	‚Ä¢	The product is a¬†**gas reader**¬†that detects impulses from my gas meter. It came pre-installed with¬†**Tasmota**.

	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôve configured the MQTT settings in my gas sensor to connect to my Home Assistant MQTT server (via Mosquitto).

	‚Ä¢	I can see incoming data from the sensor in¬†**MQTT Explorer**, so the connection appears to be working.

	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôve also added a¬†**Template Script**¬†to my¬†configuration.yaml¬†file in Home Assistant to define the sensor.

**Issue:**

I can‚Äôt find the sensor in Home Assistant (neither in the ‚ÄúEntities‚Äù list nor under the MQTT integration). I‚Äôm unsure where I should look for it or how to add it manually if needed.

This is the integration guide. It's in German but really theres not much information on it. The point where I can't follow protocol is the last paragraph. [https://smartnetz.at/hilfehomeass.php](https://smartnetz.at/hilfehomeass.php)

If you‚Äôve got experience with Home Assistant, MQTT, and Tasmota, I‚Äôd greatly appreciate your guidance! Your help will be rewarded with coffee, and my eternal gratitude! ‚òï

> Luckin Coffee, a Chinese brand that started seven years ago, now generates more revenue in the country than Starbucks. It has nearly three times as many stores and opens a new one, on average, every hour.

They claim that Starbucks‚Äô decline has been mostly due to its higher price point. This made me wonder why Taiwanese chains still seem to lag behind Starbucks. Every time I pass by a Starbucks or visit one, it seems to be full of people‚Äîusually random people working, chatting, or having business meetings. The other day, I read a [post on this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/taiwan/comments/1gsq4ti/has_louisa_gotten_way_worse_or_maybe_im_just_more/) about how everyone (myself included) seems to think that Louisa has been declining, despite them offering coffee for half the price of Starbucks (just like Luckin). Their stock price clearly reflects that.

Having said all of that, I have never actually tried Luckin. The last time I went to China was like a decade ago, so I don‚Äôt have a comparison‚Äîbut perhaps some of you do.

Why can a Chinese chain gain traction so quickly and win over Starbucks, but the same thing doesn‚Äôt seem to happen in Taiwan?",4,1734591197.0,taiwan,34,0.7,False

Finca El Socorro‚Äôs history dates back to the 19th century, with coffee production beginning in the 1980s. Today, \*\*Juan Diego de la Cerda\*\* continues his family‚Äôs legacy, refining processes and varietals to produce some of Guatemala‚Äôs best coffees.

Brewed four cups with the 3-Cup, three of them back to back with slightly different grinds, ended up preferring it one notch finer than I was grinding for the 6-Cup.

14.5g with what is supposedly the finest setting on my Q2 Heptagonal (indicator pointing at the Zero now, it had been one notch prior to that for the 6-Cup Moka).

Spritzed the Beans, used a WDT, filled to Valve with boiling water, and cleaned out the Q2 each time with a brush and knocking bits loose with my hand over the trash...

Brewing three back to back was easy, used running cold water to speed up the cool down, then kept a bigger pot of water boiling elsewhere on the stove. Was quick.

A new BooKoo scale is on the way, then I‚Äôll start using the associated App and weighing the Water In and Brewed Coffee Out and the Ratios, tracking Recipes for a while to see how much I can optimize this setup.

It‚Äôs my nicest setup ever. Almost done with this phase when the Scale gets here. Will keep this setup for life, as much as the bits keep working at least.  I‚Äôve had Moka, Aeropress, Drips, Pods, French Presses, V60.

V60 and Chemex pouring is too laboriously-fussy for me, so I‚Äôve returned to the Moka for my main Filter Coffee setup.  I‚Äôd like a fancy Espresso double boiler machine with Flow Control and a PID, too, but my tastes exceed my budget right now so it will be a while.

For now and forever more my humble-ish Filter Coffee setup will be my tools of choice for near-daily Coffee, something I‚Äôve only assembled recently, and it‚Äôs already become the best coffee I‚Äôve ever made and improving‚Ä¶

With both Moka Pot sizes this photo shows a $285 setup, plus the new Scale, of course various pieces are useful to a future Espresso setup too, but so far I‚Äôve spent $400 on gear plus the $ of fresh roasted Beans.

I‚Äôm super satisfied, 3lbs of Beans into it so far, will probably brew 1lb a month, give or take, and I‚Äôll stick with the same Beans for a while to really dial it in.  My process is down, making a cup is quick/easy each day.

1hhmq3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenparentingadvice/comments/1hhmq3d/teenage_son_is_disrespectful/,Teenage son is disrespectful‚Ä¶..,"My 17 year old son has a girlfriend who he has been with since January 2024. She is going to be 18 in January 2025 and he will turn 18 in April. 

She lives in a different city than us 25 minutes away by car each way. 

We have a very limited bus service that runs Monday to Saturday only a couple times per day up until 5pm. She would take the bus her and they would split the cost for her to take a cab home. 

In May I started driving her home when she would visit. Sometimes 3 or 4 times per week an hour out of my day for free probably $12 in gas each time. They seen each other lots over the summer and always at our home. 

My husband and I have always been nice to her and she has been over during family birthdays and Thanksgiving.

She doesn‚Äôt ever have conversation me or my husband. 

In August I had a conversation with my son who gets drives every where and had thrown out there how some parents don‚Äôt drive their kids to school everyday (we are within walking distance) but her gets one. I mentioned how his gf‚Äôs parents don‚Äôt drive her anywhere , which I know because they told me this. Well he went back to her and told her I was talking shit how her mom doesn‚Äôt do anything for her. She got upset about that I guess. 

In October for Thanksgiving had my husband‚Äôs parents over along with his gf they stayed in his room the whole time like they always do. During dinner she had conversation with the grandparents and even at the dinner table after dinner was over for a bit. They were invited downstairs to play darts afterwards but went to his room instead. 

At some point after this visit I mentioned to my son how she never has conversations with us at all but she did with the grandparents and he told me it‚Äôs because she like them and doesn‚Äôt like us. 

She has brought alcohol to our home 3 times. The 1st time I found out about it which was 1 month after they started dating I told him she can‚Äôt be doing that. Then when I went into his room to wake him up for school he had a bottle of vodka on his bookshelf which I took. After that he ended up bringing another bottle home around Halloween that when I found I took. He said it was his gf‚Äôs he needed it back. She was her and we had a conversation with him with her in the room how she can‚Äôt bring alcohol into our home for them to drink they are underage. I mentioned to her that she seems to think we hate her which isn‚Äôt true and she told me that it feels like she is hated by my husband and I. 

When I drove her home that night I stopped to buy them iced coffee and tried to apologize to her again for her thinking that plus she brought up the comment I made how her parents don‚Äôt drive her anywhere but was took as doing nothing for her. 

She wouldn‚Äôt accept my apology. She still thought we hate her. This was in October.

Over a week ago we had a snow storm that cancelled school for the day. The bus she takes to get here was still running so he came out and told us she‚Äôs coming and will need a drive home. I told him no the roads are closed and even if they opened again I wasn‚Äôt driving in the snow squalls. Her grandma gave me her phone number back in October if I ever needed anything they are always willing to help their granddaughter out to give them a call. So I called and asked if they would drive her home or let her spend the night of the roads are closed if she took the bus. They said yes. He was upset I called and she was even more upset I believe. But that was the only way for her to get home because I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable driving in the snow squalls. 

On Friday, my husband and I were shopping in the city his gf lives in and he was at school and wanted us to pick her up and bring her back to our house so he could visit with her. We didn‚Äôt pick her up because he ended up getting called into work early that night. However, I was reading his text messages over the weekend that he had with her on Friday and when he was talking her 
- she would have a guaranteed drive home 
- That he would pay for the bus to get her here and iced coffees for them
- He was telling her that we were in her city and could pick her up and bring her back

Her response to him was‚Ä¶.
- i am not driving with your mom alone w out you here
- im not driving with them (meaning my husband and I)

Her told her to just don't talk to them it would be fine and she said no

He said to her..

- they've offered to pick you up before and bring you back if i'm at school
- because i told them you had a spare
- you would be in the back seat just sit on your phone and say thank vou when vou
- you would be in the back seat just sit on your phone and say thank you when you get back
- i know things have been rough with them but i wanna see you and then we could literally shop too

I‚Äôm not sure what is so rough between us with her.

I basically told him the other day that I don‚Äôt want her visiting anymore they need to go to her house or hang out somewhere else. 

He was rude this week telling me he hates and doesn‚Äôt love me or his Dad and doesn‚Äôt want to have anything to do with me when he moves out. 

Today when he was asking to have her over o told him I didn‚Äôt want her over she thinks we hate her and doesn‚Äôt want to be around us. So he said that she doesn‚Äôt like the camera‚Äôs we have in the home. We‚Äôve had a security system in the home for over 10 years it came with the house. We aren‚Äôt going to get rid of it because he has a gf who doesn‚Äôt like it. 

I have been very accommodating when it comes to driving her home. Sometimes it‚Äôs midnight, 1am or 2am that I‚Äôve taken her home. 

I bought a 3 year old car ($40k cash) in May  the plan is to give our son the car once he graduates and has saved up $16,000 towards it. My husband and I will have then paid the rest.

We bought her a card and gift card for Christmas and her 18th birthday is in January and have already bought a card and gift card for that. If we didn‚Äôt like her why would we bother and why would we have her in our home or at birthdays and Thanksgiving. 

I‚Äôm to the point where I‚Äôm so done with them. They both are rude and by his comments I believe he is only here for handouts. 

I don‚Äôt really want her at our home anymore and want nothing to do with driving her home.

As a chef and foodie, I find joy in exploring culinary adventures, whether at local coffee shops, cozy restaurants, or bustling markets. After enduring a tough nine-year marriage that left emotional scars, I‚Äôm on a journey of self-love, healing, and rediscovering happiness. I‚Äôm also focused on losing weight and reclaiming my confidence.

While I‚Äôm not looking for anything too serious right now, I value deep emotional connections and meaningful companionship to eventually become serious. Sex is important to me, as I believe it deepens intimacy and emotional bonding. I want someone to share unforgettable adventures, intimate moments, and genuine laughter. Life is too short not to explore, love, and savor every bite along the way.

*******************************************************
I‚Äôm looking for a man who‚Äôs taller than 5‚Äô8‚Äù since I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù myself. While I have love for short kings, my past experience with a shorter ex left me wanting something different. He needs to love kids because I‚Äôm a mom, though I‚Äôm perfectly happy not having more children. What matters most to me is genuine companionship‚Äîsomeone who values family and is ready to be part of my world.

I want someone emotionally mature, patient, and adventurous‚Äîa partner who‚Äôs excited about traveling, trying new foods, and creating unforgettable memories together. Sex is important to me because I believe it strengthens emotional intimacy and deepens our connection. I need someone who respects my past, supports my healing, and is ready to build something meaningful, filled with love, passion, and shared experiences.

Here‚Äôs a big problem, I haven‚Äôt had time to clean my room, because I‚Äôm trying to wrap Christmas presents, I‚Äôm trying to have Christmas presents made, so pretty much all my Christmas presents are all over the floor in my room. And a couple of clothes.  That‚Äôs it!  My desk in my nightstand I have a couple pieces on it in a little cluttered, but it‚Äôs really not that dirty. It‚Äôs mainly just my Christmas presents are everywhere.  I haven‚Äôt had time to clean my room because my parents also expect me to do chores every day, make sure to spend time with the family every day to third degree, make sure that I help out outside of doing chores, make sure I make time for the things that are important to them like events if anything is happening, and I‚Äôm also supposed to work three jobs and run a business with my mom, which I never consented to doing. I was guilt tripped into running a business that I had started myself with my mom.  I only run the business with her now because if I try to get away from it, she‚Äôll go into this vindictive mode, or she won‚Äôt talk to me, and she will be angry with me for a long time, even if I tell her, I would train her and how to run the business by herselfand I would just do the marketing for her, she still gets angry with me and will treat me differently. On top of all that I have a lot of skills that I have developed, which makes me very beneficial to my family, such as a lot of editorial abilities when it comes to the digital world, I also run to social media platforms full-time for two businesses that belong to my parents.  It is very overwhelming the amount of expectations that I have on me.  My parents also expect me to get up whenever they tell me to get up.  I work late shifts which exhaust me every day at one of my jobs and so I like to sleep in a little bit in the morning. I get home at about like 11 o‚Äôclock every night have dinner and then do some work that I needed to get done before I go to bed, typically I get to bed around 2 o‚Äôclock in the morning. So I‚Äôm pretty exhausted and I‚Äôll sleep normally till like 10 o‚Äôclock in the morning.  I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs crazy.  And on top of all this, I have ADHD, not like it‚Äôs a major disability or anything like that, but it adds to my stress it makes it really hard to organize my life.

Here‚Äôs the thing, during the conversation my parents can walk away whenever they want, but if I walk away, I‚Äôm going to get hell from it, and my parents will come and follow me.
