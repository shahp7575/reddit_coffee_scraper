1piz40g,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSecretLifeOfRoses/comments/1piz40g/the_secret_life_of_roses_everything_you_never/,'The Secret Life of Roses: Everything You Never Knew About Love',"December brings with it the allure of introspection. Cold, broody days and long nights cracked by fireplaces and candle light. Our coffee gets \[music\] cold between the pages of old books and afternoon naps carry lucid dreams and fleeting apparitions. It's a quiet chance to look back on the waning year and see how much has changed, how much has remained \[music\] the same. goals setting on the shelves in my mind, getting \[music\] dusty and still out of reach. Random blessings that seem to have fallen on the floor from out of nowhere, still glittering with their newness in the \[music\] fire light. This time, I looked back too far and fell face first into a memory. Time folds \[music\] when you look back too long. stops there. Or maybe it just refuses to follow the rules. It lingers on a singularity trapped inside of a crystal at the center of a rose garden. That one memory, that one pivotal moment that remains as the definition of everything that came before and after it.

Without that one thing, we would not be who we are. We treasure this one thing above all others. No one will ever be able to take it away from us. We look at it and we smile. But smiles can lie. And sometimes the lies smile back. This is the source of our madness. In a previous life, I spent years trapped in an enchanted wilderness, a book's worth of self-exile, armed with nothing more than a knife, an axe, and a saw. I wandered the wild for years in a primal state of mind, recklessly in search of answers, resolutions, and closure. I came into the wilderness wounded, damaged, and in pain. A wild animal trapped in the cage of my own mind. There was no medicine for my affliction, no therapist qualified to comment on it, no self-help book \[music\] to guide the way, no healing faith. Lost was simply lost. I had poured my poison heart into a cup and called it tea. I drank it until the stars blurred and the silence wept. The potion turned me into a violent monster and left me there.

Love that exists in memories tastes strange, like sugar laced with goodbye. The drink of that teacup invokes madness, delusions, and fitful dreams of things not based on any version of reality. Things that never happen nor ever will happen. It's anxiety dipped \[music\] in regret and dusted with powdery pain. I had not only loved but I had seen what lies beyond all definitions, poems and paintings of it. There's a state of seamless connection where you feel that you as an individual no longer exists as a self.

You lose all other things to define your unique identity. You lose your ego, your pride, your fear. You become so metaphysically entangled with another person that you feel whatever they feel before they tell you the reasons for it, even at great distances. Every moment of every day, your brain doses you with dopamine, serotonin, endorphins, and \[music\] oxytocin. You wake up, even for the most restless sleep, smiling and ready for anything. You've been consumed. And it's not a quiet love.

It's excitement, addiction, hunger, passion, and a rush of constant release. And it's just a little bit dangerous. It infuses everything. Colors become more vibrant. Music sounds like perfected glass winding \[music\] chimes. You can sense the web of life flowing in green tendrils through everything. You can see golden threads of time and intricate webs of choices. Starlight becomes memory. The sun and the moon become tiny but powerful symbols. Sometimes when you look at the person who has invoked such power in you, you see the air about them shimmer. A flash of rainbow colors as the light around them seems to bend in the space they fill folds over on itself before the universe makes an attempt to correct itself again and hides the shimmer away. And it was a single red rose that became a catalyst for all of this. I lived in that state of being for years. I had created and lived a real world fairy tale. magic included. It all started with a promise. 

On the first day of spring, I sent a message to the girl in our story telling her that in one year's time, I would deliver to her a single red rose. And I would do this every year for 12 years. and only upon \[music\] giving her the 12th rose would I tell her why I spent the past 12 years doing it. A full year passed and during that time I didn't talk to her at all. I went on with my life with no desires, \[music\] no expectations, no fantasies. I simply counted down the days. On the first day of spring, after the year had passed, I kept my promise.

I went to her and I delivered a single red rose. I didn't say a word. I simply walked up, gave her the rose, smiled, and walked out. It was about an hour later when she finally remembered that what I had promised her the year before. He thanked me for the rose and I told her \[music\] I would see her again next year. That was how this magic \[music\] was created. We talked a little bit throughout the year, and when the second first day of spring came around, I once again delivered to her a single red rose.

Wrapped around the stem of the second rose was a pure \[music\] silver locket. She didn't find the locket until I mentioned that it was there hours later. Upon seeing the locket, it brought her to tears. I still asked for nothing in return. I simply said, ""I'll see you next year."" The magic \[music\] deepened and over the course of the following year, so did our friendship and connection. Now she had become aware of what was happening, even if it was beyond reason.

It was just an ongoing ritual where nothing was asked for or expected. Nothing was professed or desired. It was something that was just there. and another year had passed. The first day of spring returned, and with the third rose, I wrote her a message in a bottle that was wrapped seven times with mint green thread, her favorite color. One wrap of thread \[music\] for each year we had known each other. The bottle was corked and sealed with red wax. I told her that it was magic in a bottle and the magic would stay there so long as she never opened it to read the letter. Yet, if she ever had a really bad day, she could break \[music\] the seal and the magic inside would make everything better, but then it would be gone. Months passed and a really bad day did come. A close friend of hers had died and in her grief, she opened the bottle. Inside was a poem \[music\] that told her that the magic we shared would remain. And for as long as a single red rose bloomed anywhere in the world, she would never be alone.

Time passed and we grew even closer. Now we talked every day. She would wake me in the middle of the night to video chat with me while she was at work. Every moment and event of our lives we shared with each other, but that was all. There was nothing physical about it. There was only this deepening connection in the anniversary of the rose. The first day of spring came yet again, and with the fourth rose, I had written a 300page leather-bound book of poetry, stories, and all of the reasons that I was in love with her, and yet expected nothing in return. The last chapter of that book gave a prophecy that we would share this fairy tale magic so long as she never betrayed my trust. But the day would come when a single choice she would have to make would either finish the story or end it. The final pages of the book were left empty with the explanation that these pages could only be written by her. 

The year passed by and winter came before the prophecy came true. While with me almost every moment of every day, she was hiding someone else. The betrayal came to light at a Christmas party, and I calmly gave her until sunset to make her choice. In spite of our years together and the story we shared, she chose him. The spell broke. Roses froze solid in ice as if trapped in crystals. Mirrors cracked from side to side and the entire world turned gray. I didn't outwardly react. I simply respected her choice and walked away. This is why I still go out in search of winter frozen roses during the first snow of the year. It's a reminder of loss that teaches humility, a lesson that all things must end, no matter how beautiful and full of life they still are. But also that moments can be frozen in time. There was no drama, no begging, no anger, no long drawn out conversation. I was simply gone. Nothing about this was about me, not my dreams, wants, or desires. It was always about hers. And I had to respect that. There was nothing left but silence. Just silence. And that's how it ended. I did not talk to her again until the

first day of spring arrived. Myself being honor bound, I still kept my promise and took her a single red rose. And with this rose, I brought with it a goodbye. In order to prove true love exists, I had to sacrifice myself for her version of it \[music\] was someone else. I had to become truly selfless. And so I did. I had packed all of my belongings and delivering the rose was my final stop. Not only out of town, but out of the area. I gave her a long, gentle hug, said goodbye, and that day I moved over 100 miles away, self-exiled into a wide wilderness, and I wouldn't return again for over a decade. The forest spoke softly at first, but the trees remembered me all too well. Every leaf carried my sins. \[music\] Every root reached for my ankles. The spirits of the forest whispered my name like a secret they wanted to forget. They thought I was lost, but I knew better. This was the \[music\] only place that reflected my soul. Fractured, vivid, and strangely alive. Tears turn black here. Even sorrow has to adapt to survive.

But it isn't the forest that destroys you. It just teaches you \[music\] how to destroy yourself. slowly and beautifully. People lost in the wilderness often don't die of an animal attack or exposure. They die of shame. Out there, you are confronted by your true self. Not the self that you show family or loved ones. Not the self you project onto the world via the internet, but your true unfiltered self. Most people are ashamed of what they see when that happens. And in that shame, they simply lay down and die. Still, time in the wilderness is a kindness to oneself. Time away from the home of industrialization and the endless engines \[music\] of capitalism. Wide open and wild spaces unplugged and far away from everything humanity has become. Within the emerald forest that I exiled myself to, \[music\] madness isn't contagious. It was the only thing that kept you breathing. The wilderness allowed for room to go insane. Far removed from other people that could be hurt by your pain. The self-exile wasn't to protect myself.

It was to protect everyone else from what I had become. Every door I opened there led \[music\] back to myself. And each version of me looked more broken than the last. Every riddle there is written in pain. And I was running out of answers. So eventually I stopped asking questions. I studied the flora. I communed with wildlife so intimately that I came to name and care for them on an almost spiritual level. I endured every form of weather nature could produce to entertain me. I witnessed things hidden in glades that no human has the right to witness. Bonds playing with raccoons in the evening sun. Mothers tending to \[music\] their children. Predators on the fringe waiting patiently for an opportunity to exploit. I witnessed and studied life in its purest form. I walked between ancient trees so silent it was if they were keeping secrets from me. I once believed in happily ever after. Here I believed only in surviving the next chapter. 

Time has little meaning in the wild. There's no schedule, no time clock, no calendar, no trends, no money, no following, no internet. It's either day or night, and every second carries a ghost of who we were before we stepped foot across the boundary between our old life and this realm in between. The wilderness is a transition where the longer you stay, the more difficult it is to pull away. A whispered lullaby on the breeze is always present, begging you to simply lay down and sleep right there on the forest floor. No blanket, no shelter, no warmth of a flickering fire.

Just lay down, it would whisper, like a lover wanting you to come back to bed. I loved her back so fiercely that even time looked away. Years passed by in a blink. But the memories, the memories came in countless neverending droves. And I still often find myself longing for the endless sea of green and deep dark shadows. I miss my wildlife friends. I miss the mysteries of \[music\] the forest and the answers it brings over time. by turning you into a creature that acts on primitive instinct more than anything else. Truth is, I'm still as undomesticated and untamed as the wild animals I once sat in meadows with. I'm just quiet inside now, reading to you pages from this journal. 

During my adventures in the Emerald Forest, I uncovered four things that I would bring back with me. Three of them were stones, two of crystal and one of a still unidentified metal with a crystalline lattice. The fourth was a strange tetrahedron shaped object that I found tangled in the roots of an ancient oak tree that had toppled over during a storm. It had taken me nearly a decade to come across these four earthly treasures of nature. But with each discovery, something inside me changed. When I returned from the emerald forest, I placed one of the crystals within the fork of a tree sapling and spent the next 3 years training the tree to grow around it while at the same time pruning the tree into a human-like form. My notion was that since my heart had been broken, I would simply grow myself another one.

And if I should ever fall in love again, I would gift the crystal now locked inside of its living cage to whoever it was I fell in love with. The other two stones have yet to be used. I'm not sure what they're for yet. Near to the same tree, I placed a golden tetrahedron shaped object on a podium with a silver holder that reflects sunlight onto it. no matter what angle the sun is at. And from the point where the object now rest, I began building an ivy covered rose garden. In my imagination, this golden triangle is the key to the doorway that separates my pocket dimension from the rest of the world. A physical illustration reminding me to see everything differently than others. And it is one of only four treasured objects of my time in the emerald forest. So it reminds me of those countless tales as well that once upon a time I lived in an enchanted realm and this was proof that I was there. 

Tiffin, the surrounding city with all of its real world history and age-old architecture is also nearly overgrown with rose bushes of all sorts. You will find them on the river walk, downtown, on campus, down nearly every single \[music\] side street, and even alleyways. My four treasures from the Emerald Forest became the seeds of everything that has grown here since. They caused the timelessness of my life to fold over onto itself, and very different tales lived out in very different places to all merge together in the present. And in the twisting and turning of it all, life evolved into something new, something greater than the sum of its parts. 

As time passed, I almost forgotten the details of the events leading to myself exiled in the wilderness. Or at least I had forgotten the bad parts. I remember the good parts in vibrant detail. Somewhere along the way, the light came in and I look back on the memory that damaged me on a fundamental level from the perspective of at least I got to experience that for a little while. For a little while that was mine. For a little while I got to hold it in my arms. For a little while, every dream I had ever had came true. For a little while, life was \[music\] perfect and I was somewhere beyond all definition and description, poem and song about love. I swore to honor that for as long as a single rose still blooms anywhere in the world. And eventually, I left the wilderness. That was the metaphor of my being lost in my own mind, bringing my four treasures back with me. By the time I returned home, no one here had seen me in 12 years. I left and I didn't look back. 

I didn't call. I didn't write. I didn't even bother to send a text. I knew nothing of what was happening with my family and the scraps of information I did get on a holiday or some other event I dismissed. I was really gone and there was no grave to come visit my ghost at. From my point of view, I was in an entirely different dimension and I embraced the life I had there, hiding away from the life I once had and searching for anything that even came close to the same kind of magic I once created. And after many years there, I found not only new magic, but the answers and closure I was looking for as well. It's great stress that triggers evolution. I had adapted and then evolved. When that happened, it was time for me to leave my enchanted emerald forest and return to reality. 

So one day, I don't remember which, I simply walked back into town like Rip Van Winkle, waking from his long sleep. I was not the same as I was when I left. And today I'm not the same as I was when I was trapped in the Emerald Forest. Tomorrow, I probably won't be the same as I am today. That's what causes the pages of this new story to turn. My return brought with it a tension in the air that never leaves, like an incessant vibration. She knows I'm here, and my presence brings with it a nagging regret. To ease this, I promised that I would keep my distance from her and everything from our story would be locked behind a red door somewhere in our minds. 

The past is the past and the old magic is gone. It's just a memory. But on the first day of spring, in spite of no more roses being delivered, we still say happy anniversary to each other and then go back to our separate lives. Which one you think about it is insane. How many of your past loves do you do that with? Just because the relationship changes doesn't mean it has to end. But it does take great strength and emotional maturity to achieve that. Strangely enough, I don't feel like a victim of betrayal. I feel like someone who was given the opportunity to learn how to love. And I think I passed the test fairly well, even if it did take me over a decade to heal from the lesson. Magic always has a price. My origin story ends with me being contently aware that I am that one guy. I am not the lover. I am the measurement and the standard by \[music\] which the lover is held to. I am a danger that no one will ever really be able to live up to or overcome. I leave her with that and with my blessing. But I also feel like I'm held in a glass case with the words only open in case of emergency. Like the message in a bottle, a new magic \[music\] contained and sealed away. If ever opened, I'll fix everything simply out of some outdated \[music\] sense of chivalry. But then the magic of me will be gone. The idea of us ever actually being together again can never happen. Once a spell is broken, it's simply broken. There is no going back. Choices can \[music\] be forgiven, healed, and even consciously forgotten. Yet they remain a fracture all the same.

The love that was is no longer pure, though it will never be what I'm searching for, willing to entertain or pour sands of time into. In this, I have become more than the story that I created and more than I could ever have achieved on my own. I'm grateful to her for that. And so once a year I honor my gratefulness and wish her a happy first day of spring. That's it. That's all.

 For my part, I still obsess over the courtly notions of fairy tale love. And I think I had the right story to achieve it all those years ago. I simply chose the wrong girl. And knowing how our lives played out over these years and what we would become in the process made me realize that we would have never been happy together. I have zero interest in living the type of life she chose. And in hindsight, I'm grateful that that was not the end of me. Or maybe, just maybe, believing that I had it and then losing it offered me more insight to what it actually is. That state of existence that lies beyond all human notions and expressions of true love. Maybe I had to lose that first primordial version of it because feeling that loss is a \[music\] secret ingredient to making a truer version of it. You're gifted with an appreciation of just how rare it really is. And you won't waste a single moment taking it for granted. This level of love that the gods themselves fight over and wish to attain. You realize how valuable it is. And in the madness of loss, you become aware of exactly what it it can do to \[music\] you if it's ever betrayed by either side.

Love can turn gentle men into raging beasts. I'm alone now. I have been for a very long time. Existing between the pages on the boundary between this and that. Recounting and preserving histories, my cities and my own. I see how disconnected people have become, how isolated, just like me. All of us longing for more and wishing we knew what to do to attain some semblance of story. Some of us willing to give anything to become the character in the kind of tale I just recounted. to have just one chance at it or even to live the rest of your life knowing that there is at least one person somewhere out there in the world who went that far for you and in doing so redefined everything you'll ever experience, even your own memories. But then a voice inside says, ""That will never be you. No one will ever love you like that. Or we feel like for whatever reason we are not worthy of it. Not worth the effort. Not worth someone's heart. 

Thinking this way goes back to what I mentioned about why people die in the wilderness. True love doesn't die from choices, acts, or betrayals. It dies of shame. We never attain it because we are no longer willing to try. We no longer believe in magic or in ourselves. Our betrayer becomes ashamed of their choices. We feel ashamed because something lacking in ourselves inspired them to look elsewhere for it. Love dies of shame. Life in the world has worn us down, exhausted our hearts, destroyed our imaginations, crushed our dreams relentlessly, and we feel like we have nothing left to give. We're broken. And in our damage, we feel as if no one wants us anyway. So, we hide ourselves away and guard the last shards of our hearts because we think \[music\] those last tiny fragments, sharp as glass, are the only things keeping us alive. Even though we cut ourselves with them all the time just to feel something. No one can have them. No one. So you the listener self-exile the same as I once did just to keep your shards and you have no rose filled riverside city to go to. 

They say that the passage of time will heal all wounds. But the greater the loss, the deeper the cut and the more difficult the process to become whole again. The pain may fade, but the scars serve as a reminder of our suffering and make the bearer all the more resolved never to be wounded again. So as time moves on, we get lost in distractions, act out in frustration, react with aggression, give in to anger. And all the while we plot and plan as we wait to grow stronger. And before we know it, the time passes. We are healed, ready to begin a new. Presently, my focus isn't so much on living out a new epic love story so much as it is building a deep, rich world in which to live such a story out in its histories, politics, currencies, mythology, and magics. 

All while attaining connections, wealth, and influence through public appearances, networking, and philanthropy, while at the same time remaining somewhat secluded in my research, work, and writing, volunteering, making donations, and investments with high rewards, recognition, and returns while keeping a distinct separation between my efforts and my private life. I'm learning, growing stronger, and doing it quietly. How my life has played out in the epic challenges \[music\] I faced, and it has gifted me with a poise confidence that is no longer untempered, brash, and cocky. I purposely and remain consciously aware of how I carry myself, how I walk with an air of authority. focused on a single point ahead as if on a some important task all the time. Even when I'm not, I pause my speaking. I always count in my head between three and \[music\] five before I respond to anyone, as if weighing my words while holding eye contact with them. I already know what I'm going to say. It often isn't what you say that makes the impact. It's how you say it. That short counting \[music\] pause makes one seem far more intense than they really are. And every word you choose to speak does actually matter. 

I shake the hand of any man I meet. Even if I don't like him or I know that he doesn't like me. This is a dignity and a precedence of warrior sense of honor which can make \[music\] one appear respectfully dangerous. Offering your hand to an enemy is a show of strength and character which can often be enough to change their minds or at the very least make them reconsider their tactics. I've adopted a very outdated code of chivalry that is only good for first impressions. On a recent business meeting, a group of us had gathered in a lobby with limited seating. I was the only man in the room to stand up and offer my seat to one of the ladies while the rest of them stared blankly at their phones. After offering her my seat, I purposely stood straight with my shoulders back and chest out near the door like some Sentinel or security guard towering over everyone else in the room who were all sitting. I did not have my phone out. I just stood like a statue watching the door to the meeting room where we were all about to go into. The impression held sway. I hold the door for the ladies, address people around me as ma'am or sir, speak with everyone I meet as if I've known them since childhood. I try to be the first to answer group questions with knowledge and a matter of fact tone. I'm always ahead of the group as if I am one leading, even when I'm not. I never follow the crowd. I walk a few steps ahead of groups of people, setting the pace front and center. I lead, you follow. 

At the same time, I can most often be seen sitting alone, quiet and reserved, not part of any group. I purposely do not look at my phone unless it's necessary. I never want to present myself as one of the people infected by the social media doom scrolling virus. If anything, I look at the floor instead as if contemplating some life philosophy in an almost \[music\] detached and cold manner. I focus on self-care and being self-aware. I consider how I'm presenting myself in every moment another person is around, whether I have dealings with them or not. I am a man who is acutely aware of what I've become, what I've done, what my life has evolved me into. I keep my online presence and my offline life separate. Throughout my three channel YouTube saga, I've made both loyal friends who would defend me to the ends of the earth and rabid enemies who are always waiting to exploit some nugget of information that might slip out. 

Attacking me directly never worked out in their favor. So, they watch and they wait for the opportunity to go after those close to me. I always keep the main characters of my life off the board and out of sight. It protects them, protects what we share, and offers my would be enemies factors that they will never be able to see. Those I interact with the most offline have no idea about my online presence or the complex story I've been telling for over a decade now. This makes me a man with a secret. \[music\] And I admittedly enjoy retaining that air of mystery when I disappear for a day or two to film these videos or handwriting these stories in this journal before reading them back to you. 

Of course, a few of the locals have already become aware of Secret Life due to the histories I recount here, and I'm grateful for their presence, participation, letters, and discretion. My heart was broken long ago. And so I simply grew myself another. 

Many years ago, from an island that lies deep in a river gorge at the center of an enchanted wood, I retrieved a crystal, and I placed it in the crux of a tree at the center of a rose garden. There it grew for 3 years before I took the heart-shaped thing from the tree, placed it within a glass case, and hid \[music\] it away. Throughout the process of creating this living art project, the only thing that I learned was a deep patience when considering things I do not control. I tended to the heart almost every single day. Cleaning, wrapping, weaving, pruning, and protecting. The object was a representation, a physical illustration of what was happening to me on an emotional, spiritual, and mental level. I reflected on my lost love and the stories I had lived out since while it grew silently in the garden. And over the years, all of those tales began to fade as light of this new one and its potential began to take shape. This is my heart, and it's the last one I will ever have. \[music\] Such a thing can only be created once. Any other \[music\] attempt would simply be a cheap copy of the original. 

This crystal heart is the key to my city. All that I have built and acquired. Everything I've \[music\] become. Everything that I've learned along the way. It's the last of my magic. I wander the world through time and history, bending and guiding the future with gentle unfelt nudges, watching and waiting to see if anyone out there has a shimmer, a vibration in their aura, a presence that bends the light about them in rainbow ripples. Some proof that they, like me, are not really of this world. that a part of them at least is somewhere in between, wishing and longing for something more, something unreal, something from a dream, a stranger that somehow looks familiar, like we knew each other in another life. A sense of familiarity, of knowing them without knowing them. A comfort that just seems natural and fitting. A hint of trust, safety, excitement, but also completion. Someone who feels like a missing piece, like you finally made it home. 

In turn, and more importantly, I feel the same way about them. They, like me, have known both love and loss. That they have been hurt before and felt up until this one moment that they would never be whole again. That a deep and hidden part of them has always felt alone until this one chance encounter. When we look at each other, there is simply a knowing. And in the \[music\] knowing comes a story, an adventurous exploration to see if this first impression is true or simply wishful thinking. Someone who may be worthy of the crystal heart and all that comes with it. Someone who will dare to see past the beast in search of an enchanted rose. Until then, life goes on. There's a kingdom to run and a realm to tend to, value to obtain and something more to offer. A place to go already built and ready to be explored. A vibrant life ready to be shared with comfort, security, and rest without a care or worry in the world or removed from anything that might bring it harm. I have lived many different lives in many different places. Some good, some evil. I've passed from darkness into light over and over again until I eventually found balance. It still remain very capable of both. I've learned that in every moment a choice \[music\] exists. We can cling to the past or embrace the inevitability of change and allow a brighter future to unfold before us. We are not made to be alone, not forever. We're created \[music\] in pairs, a spark of the divine masculine and divine feminine, a king and \[music\] his queen. Cursed as their past might have been, the darkness will always have an end, if not in one life, than in the next.

What has no end is the story. The story goes on long after we're gone, feeding and inspiring new \[music\] ones into being like parents giving birth to children. recounting our tales of love imbues with immortality. So tell your tale and then write a new one. Fall in love over and over again every day. And if you don't know how, journey to find the way \[music\] and the story will simply use you. All that you have ever been or will be to write itself. Someone out there has been waiting their entire lives for you to show up. When you finally do, simply apologize for being late and let them know that things got complicated along the way. They'll understand the rest without you having to say the word. It happened to them, too.

The next day another text popped up that she understands the silence and wants me to move on, whatever happened between us in that relationship was all real and great, wished me luck for my future and everything. I was still not able to respond to anything she was saying. 1 or 2 days later she called me, i picked up. she started crying, couldn't say a word clearly, i was waiting for her to calm down and tell me what happened that day which made her do all this. She started with I'm not able to tell you what happened, i insisted then she said that she went on a coffee date with a guy from her university, had a good chat then on the way back that guy tried holding her hand and ""she didn't resisted"" her exact words. The guy asked her for another date, she refused and went back home. according to her when she started feeling guilty for what she did and then she texted me that she doesn't wanna continue this relationship. She asked me why didn't I contacted her in this period of time and why didn't i asked her for the reason of breakup. My thought was if someone has already made up her mind then does that even matter to ask for it. Now the thing is she told me all of this and just wanted me to know what happened that day. My confusion is what should i do here? she came back to me with all this and asked me what to do now? i told her u already broke up with me, no? she said i did what felt right to her at that time. I Love her so much at the same time i am not able to digest this feeling that she fancy someone while being in relationship with me. I asked her what would've u done if the roles were reversed, she told me that she wouldn't continue the relationship. She also said that she can't continue the relationship with this guilt. my conscience is split between the two, A part of me doesn't want her to go the other one says let her go. that's all, what are your thoughts on this.

1piz1hr,https://i.redd.it/g566rs2oqc6g1.jpeg,I think that black coffee is the best way to drink it,"
I was never opposed to sweet things when I was younger as I am now, but even then I craved for the complexity of flavor in coffee. In time, I found that I enjoyed it more and more as I used increasingly less sugar each time I drank my coffee. Now, just about every person I encounter finds this to be strange. They believe that I have been eliminating the single appealing feature of coffee, the sweetness. This reaction was always met by confusion from me, as I simply couldn't comprehend how that could be. If you inspect the coffee bean very closely, you'll find that there is no sugar in it, so why is the expectation that the source of satisfaction in coffee is its sweetness?

Yip yap transition

I'd say I'm a really good listener when it comes to stories. When someone tells me a story, I don't just listen, I experience it as they tell it to me. I don't do it consciously, I think that it's a side effect of my vivid imagination. When I begin listening to a story, I no longer see the narrator or anything around me, I see the experience of the situation through their eyes and I even try to comprehend externalities that don't exactly pretain to the main point of why I'm being told the story. So it's this connection to stories that allows me to derive a lot of enjoyment from entertainment like anime, movies, and plot-driven video games like Ace Attorney. 

Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney is a point and click game where you act as the fledgling lawyer, Phoenix Wright, and use logic with investigation to find your clients not guilty. This game is such a paragon of writing that it has introduced me to multiple schools of thought that I had never considered before, but I want to focus on the thought process that most of the lawyers gain throughout their career. The character that is best to explain this philosophy and how I adopted it is Mr. Miles Edgeworth. 

In the first game of the franchise, he acts as one of the main antagonists. Edgeworth begins as cut-throat, genius prosecutor who was mentored by an even more cruel and legendary prosecutor called Von Karma who taught him that his only purpose was to win his case and do it perfectly by any means. Edgeworth never questioned these teachings, which is understandable because he truly had no reason to do so. It feels good to win arguments, he gained satisfaction from guilty verdicts, and he loved the idea of incarcerating every single criminal. This Von Karma ideology was sweet to him. He believed that the truth originated in the courtroom, so it was his to decide, and he would always decide guilty. So he became a prosecutor at 18 and never lost a case until he met his rival in court and childhood friend, Phoenix Wright.

Wright's mentor taught him that the truth existed no matter what the court says and no matter what the evidence appears to point to. This determination is what allows him to deliver a string of losses to 
Edgeworth in court. Edgeworth is sent spiraling after being shown that the philosophy that he built his whole life on was a lie, so he escapes the country and even considered suicide. When he returns, he has shed all of his ruthless ways and renounces his Von Karma ways. So what's left after a prosecutor leaves behind the desire to win every case? He's a prosecutor so he can't rely on an unwavering faith in his client like Wright does. Beyond the need to win the case, beyond the need to find the defendant guilty, the only purpose that the court holds for Edgeworth is to find the truth. Throughout the rest of the entire franchise, he makes it his creed to press and let up on his pursuit of the truth. 

Not only is the character extremely relatable to me personally, I agree with his creed. In fact, it aligns with me so well that I apply this ""pursuit of the truth"" in nearly every part of my life that I can. Ace Attorney didn't invent this philosophy for me, it was always inside me. My religion, my intelligence, my passion for science, and even my preference for the bitter and nuanced all led to me to the conclusion that there's nothing better to pursue in life than the truth. 

Alexa, play The Fragrance Of Dark Coffee

I made a discovery regarding my aversion to sweetness, not while I was drinking coffee, but a warm cup of black tea. I had always thought that tea didn't taste very good in the past, but I had only really ever had restaurant sweet tea. A sore throat was the only that made me even consider brewing myself a cup of tea, but when I tried it, a strong note of bitterness stuck my tongue. It was then that it hit me, the reason that people taint their coffee, tea, and other things with so much sweetness that they lose their character is for the fear of bitterness. And it's now I learn that to fear what's bitter is childish because to avoid the bitter is to avoid the truth. When you pour a sweet vanilla creamer into a pure black coffee, you erase evidence of what that coffee was. Dulling that bitterness makes the other flavors in that drink submit to the saccharine. The coffee is hardly still coffee, it's a photoshopped image, it's a painting with every brushstroke smoothed together until it doesn't even look like a human work. I will never stand for perverting the truth and I will always value the authenticity of coffee. Coffee is full of wonderfully complex tastes that exist no where else and bitterness. It acts as a reminder that it's hard to pursue the truth,  but tasting that hardship means that you ventured towards the truth. A fiery debate doesn't yield smoke to me, just the fragrance of dark coffee.

I had one of those moments that is like so not a big deal for many people but it came across as very off putting  to me.
I was at a coffee with these people and they started discussing this television series which I have seen as well, and I'm pretty invested in the series, but I usually just listen to what they say about it because I actually care a lot about that story and the characters and they probably don't care enough to have a real discussion.
There is the character in it that has been through an arc of severe trauma and and later a large portion coping with that trauma and PTSD like symptoms, the depiction of certain moments are very detailed and realistic, lot of which I can relate to and empathize with.
And in their discussions I hear that they find that character very annoying because of his antics, doing nothing but overreacting and he should ""get over it already"".
It was a little thing but it was the final straw that made me decide that I don't want to be friends with these people, even if that wouldn't be the way they would outwardlh treat me if I eventually come out as who I am, well also just the fact that I realize that I'm entirely someone else or at least a very toned down version of myself around them.

Looking for some perspective from people who’ve bought imported espresso machines in India.

I placed an order for a Stone Espresso Lite (by Rocket) through Hebbey Coffee in August and made full payment upfront. I was told the machine would ship in 8–10 weeks, and that August is typically a factory shutdown month in Italy.

Later, I was informed that the machine entered India via Bangalore  customs end of October, but since then it has been “stuck in customs.” The delivery timeline has been pushed multiple times, with the latest promise now being before Christmas.

I just want to understand from the community

Is a 6+ week customs hold in Bangalore normal for a single espresso machine?

Are repeated shifting delivery promises common with such imports?

Has anyone here purchased from Hebbey Coffee, and if so, how was your experience?

Not trying to call anyone out, just trying to figure out what’s normal in this space.

FREE face-to-face conversation (Katipunan Ave. area only),"Hi **Reddit** peeps! I’m currently on a **career break** and im exploring something ive always been naturally drawn to: **talking to people** and helping them process kung ano man yung *pinagdadaanan* nila . Mga tropa ko have always told me I give **solid advice,** and that I create a semi-space/envi where they feel understood. Along the way of just asking questions, most of them have even cried (in a good, relapse, type of way (hehe gets ba?¿)  
  
**What I’m offering**  
  
A **free** (yes libre) **face-to-face** conversation where you can:  
•	unload  
•	ask for advice  
•	think things through  
•	talk about personal struggles  
•	or just be heard  
  
Walang *pressure*, no *judgment*   
  
If talking **feels awkward** sa umpisa, donut worry. im used to that. I can start the conversation and keep it flowing (na para bang water district) until **comfy** ka na. If you dont talk much, I can guide things gently without pushing (and pulling, jk).  
  
**Advice? You get to choose the style (over naman sa stYLe?!**)  
If you want advice or perspective, just say so. ofc, im not gonna have unsolicited advice, some peeps just wants ppl to listen to them.  
  
And you can actually choose your flavor:  
•	kindly honest , or  
•	brutally honest (only if ready kang ma-real talk HAHA )  
  
**Come alone or bring a friend**  
  
Feel free to invite someone if want mong mas safe ka, or if u wanna tag them along sa convo naten. Conversations can be **one-on-one or with your tropa** if that makes you feel safer or more comfortable. Minsan kase, some peeps prefer na   maraming inputs, to compare and such

**Topics I’m best at**  
People tell me na magaling ako sa:  
•	love life  
•	family relationships  
But honestly open ako sa lahat:  
acads, future worries that causes your anxiety, knowing your identity, career/work layf, confusion, anything na dala-dala ng damdamin mo ngayon.  
  
if want mo, pwede tayo mag “fast talk”. good ice breaker kase sya to get to know you more  
  
**If we vibe**  
We can even be **real‑life friends** (na para bang AI ako?! jk ) and maybe meet again occasionally if schedules align. No weirdness, just genuine convos tayo here .  
  
**Where this will happen**  
Coffee shops along Katipunan Ave, QC  
(Ateneo side / UP side / Miriam: wherever feels convenient)  
  
Public place only , for everyone’s comfort and safety.   
  
**Who is this for?**  
Anyone who’s:  
•	stressed at medyo overwhelmed  
•	confused sa life direction in general  
•	stuck sa acads, career, relationships  
•	or just needs someone neutral na makausap  
  
**Why is this free?**  
I’m exploring if this is something na want kong i-pursue seriously in layf. So rn, imma offer it free, no *expectations*, no *agenda*. just honest conversation and emotional support   
  
**Safety and boundaries**  
•	Public venue only  
•	You don’t need to reveal your full name  
•	You can end the session anytime  
•	This is NOT therapy (I’m not a licensed therapist yet)  
•	Just a safe human conversation

For those who are interested, just **comment** below. And if shy kayu, pwede niyo naman po akong i-dm.

I’ve gotten close to a Russian girl from my master’s program, but I’m not sure how to interpret her behavior or whether she sees me as more than a friend.
We met about two months ago in a university course. She’s one year ahead of me but is retaking some subjects this semester. We started spending time together naturally, first with a mutual friend, then she invited me to have lunch at the university canteen. We talked a lot, walked together afterward, and she asked for my Instagram. From that moment we kept meeting: we had coffee together, I invited her to explore a park and she immediately said yes, we started studying together regularly, and we also talked quite often on Instagram. She even invited me to join a 10-day course abroad next year and to run a marathon with her next year, so I felt we were building a real connection.
A few days after the park, I asked her if she would accept going on a date, partly just to see how she would respond. She told me she would like to go out, but only if it was considered a friendly hangout and not a date. Because of that, I started interpreting all our interactions afterward as purely friendly, even though we kept spending a lot of time together and getting closer.
But recently, for my birthday, she gave me a small gift: chocolate and a handwritten postcard with a long, thoughtful, warm message that referred to music, dancing, inspiration, encouragement, and personal details. It felt very intentional and meaningful, not something casual.
Now I’m honestly confused. On one hand she said she preferred to call it a “friendly” outing rather than a date, but on the other hand her behavior, the time we spend together, the invitations she makes, and especially the handwritten birthday card feel much more personal than typical friendship. I also know cultural differences might affect how she expresses closeness. Does this sound like someone who is interested but cautious, or someone who genuinely only wants friendship? How would you interpret this situation?
Thanks for any insight.

# 5. Families Are Shaping the Market

Strongest end-user activity:

1piyuqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/dubairealestate/comments/1piyuqp/investing_in_dubai_heres_the_market_reality_not/,Investing in Dubai? Here’s the Market Reality (NOT THE TIKTOK VERSION),"Dubai real estate feels noisy right now — some saying “bubble,” others saying, “new cycle.” Here’s a *quick*, data-backed breakdown for **investors**, **first-time buyers**, and **end-users**:

# 1. Off-Plan Reality

Off-plan is now **60–65% of transactions**, but not all projects are equal.  
Best-performing locations right now: **Dubai South, MBR City, Business Bay, JVC (select), Arjan**.  
Check: investor ratio, future supply, handover timelines.

# 2. Ready Market Strength

Ready units are quietly outperforming in areas with real end-user demand:  
**Dubai Hills (apts), Town Square, Al Furjan, Business Bay, Motor City, JLT**.

# 3. Real Yields

Sustainable net yields I’m seeing:  
**Dubai South 7.5–8%**, **JVC 6.5–7.5%**, **Arjan 6–7%**, **Furjan 6–6.8%**.

# 5. Families Are Shaping the Market

Strongest end-user activity:  
**Dubai Hills, Ranches 3, Mudon, Town Square, Meydan** — high school demand + low turnover.



If anyone wants **area comparisons**, **ROI breakdowns**, or **help choosing between ready/off-plan**, happy to jump on a **quick Zoom** or **meet for coffee**, speaking to buyers/investors daily gives a clear view of what’s actually working.

Comment or DM if you want clarity.

Curious if anyone else in Dubai makes it at home, and what kind of [coffee beans in Dubai ](https://thecaphevietnam.com/collections/coffee)you’ve had good results with (not asking for promos, just experiences).

# My quick methods:

**Phin coffee:**

* Add 2 tbsp of coffee
* Bloom 10 sec
* Fill with hot water
* Let it drip slowly

**Iced Vietnamese coffee:**

* Brew a phin
* Add condensed milk + ice
* Pour hot coffee over

**Cold brew (robusta works well):**

* 1 cup coarse grounds + 4 cups water
* Steep 12–18 hours
* Strain and serve over ice

**Instant version:**

* Instant coffee + hot water
* Add ice/milk if you want

I’m currently on a **career break** (UP Alum here) and im exploring something ive always been naturally drawn to: **talking to people** and helping them process kung ano man yung *pinagdadaanan* nila . Mga tropa ko have always told me I give **solid advice,** and that I create a semi-space/envi where they feel understood. Along the way of just asking questions, most of them have even cried (in a good, relapse, type of way (hehe gets ba?¿)  
  
**What I’m offering**  
  
A **free** (yes libre) **face-to-face** conversation where you can:  
•	unload  
•	ask for advice  
•	think things through  
•	talk about personal struggles  
•	or just be heard  
  
Walang *pressure*, no *judgment*   
  
If talking **feels awkward** sa umpisa, donut worry. im used to that. I can start the conversation and keep it flowing (na para bang water district) until **comfy** ka na. If you dont talk much, I can guide things gently without pushing (and pulling, jk).  
  
**Advice? You get to choose the style (over naman sa stYLe?!**)  
If you want advice or perspective, just say so. ofc, im not gonna have unsolicited advice, some peeps just wants ppl to listen to them.  
  
And you can actually choose your flavor:  
•	kindly honest , or  
•	brutally honest (only if ready kang ma-real talk HAHA )  
  
**Come alone or bring a friend**  
  
Feel free to invite someone if want mong mas safe ka, or if u wanna tag them along sa convo naten. Conversations can be **one-on-one or with your tropa** if that makes you feel safer or more comfortable. Minsan kase, some peeps prefer na   maraming inputs, to compare and such  


**Topics I’m best at**  
People tell me na magaling ako sa:  
•	love life  
•	family relationships  
But honestly open ako sa lahat:  
acads, future worries that causes your anxiety, knowing your identity, career/work layf, confusion, anything na dala-dala ng damdamin mo ngayon.  
  
if want mo, pwede tayo mag “fast talk”. good ice breaker kase sya to get to know you more  
  
**If we vibe**  
We can even be **real‑life friends** (na para bang AI ako?! jk ) and maybe meet again occasionally if schedules align. No weirdness, just genuine convos tayo here .  
  
**Where this will happen**  
Coffee shops along Katipunan Ave, QC  
(Ateneo side / UP side / Miriam: wherever feels convenient)  
  
Public place only , for everyone’s comfort and safety.   
  
**Who is this for?**  
Anyone who’s:  
•	stressed at medyo overwhelmed  
•	confused sa life direction in general  
•	stuck sa acads, career, relationships  
•	or just needs someone neutral na makausap  
  
**Why is this free?**  
I’m exploring if this is something na want kong i-pursue seriously in layf. So rn, imma offer it free, no *expectations*, no *agenda*. just honest conversation and emotional support   
  
**Safety and boundaries**  
•	Public venue only  
•	You don’t need to reveal your full name  
•	You can end the session anytime  
•	This is NOT therapy (I’m not a licensed therapist yet)  
•	Just a safe human conversation

For those who are interested, just **comment** below. And if shy kayu, pwede niyo naman po akong i-dm.

* **CPU** \- Intel Core i5-1245U
* **RAM** \- 16 GB
* **SSD** \- 512 GB
* **screen** \-  14"" FHD Touch (1920 x 1080)

Two-previous work laptops ago, I had a Latitude 54xx and I thought it worked well for what I did (a heavy Microsoft 365 user, with multiple Excel spreadsheets and Word documents open at once, Teams and Outlook, music/Netflix usually playing in the background, and tons of internet tabs open).  I don't remember specifically what model, but I do remember it was 5000 series and 14"" screen and it had an i5.  

I definitely want a laptop that is portable and light, as I often change my work space (apartment to coffee shop to library to cafe).  From what I've read online, there is a difference in build quality between the 5000 series and the 7000 series, with the 7000 series being higher-end and more durable.  

The Latitude 7430 laptop caught my eye because I think I only need an i5 (seems like most 7000 series are i7...?) but would like the durability of a 7000 series.  I'm not well-versed in computer hardware, but I do recognize that 12th gen is a few generations ago (most recent is 15th gen...?), though it seems 12th gen is still a good processor...?  I also have no clue how to interpret the different letters U, H, P, etc.  >\_<

Is this a good deal?  Or for \~$500, should I be looking at a newer gen processor?  Or is a 7000 series better suited with an i7?  Thanks in advance!

1piyo59,https://www.reddit.com/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/1piyo59/anyone_trying_to_build_their_own_income_stream/,Anyone trying to build their own income stream + wanting community?,"This might be a bit rambly, but I’m just going to throw it out there and see if anyone recognizes themselves in this.

I’m a late-diagnosed autistic/ADHD woman in my late 30s. I’ve spent my whole adult life in one corporate job after another, and it’s basically been the same loop: push too hard, mask, burn out, scrape myself together, repeat.

A lot has happened over the last 6 years that eventually pushed me into the worst burnout I’ve ever had. It’s been a couple of years now of pretty crippling burnout, and I’m only just starting to have a bit of capacity again.

What I am pretty sure of now is that I don’t want to go back to a “normal” job setup. I don’t want to be dependent on some random manager’s mood swings or a company’s chaos, and I know that any ""normal"" job will be too much me. I’d really like to build something where I have more control over how I work and how much I give.

My background is in tech, and I’m a generalist: I can code a bit, I’m creative, I can do some marketing and ops. I’ve started my own business and my first experiment is selling digital products on Etsy.

But my brain makes this… complicated.

I bounce between:

* “I have 25 ideas and they’re all amazing and I should start all of them right now” and
* “I can’t even make myself open my laptop, what’s the point?”

There’s a narrow window in between those where I actually get work done. It’s not very predictable, and it’s pretty lonely. I don’t have much of a support system for this. I really miss having people who get it and don’t respond with “have you tried a planner?”

So I’m wondering if there are other neurodivergent women who are in a similar place:

* autistic / ADHD / AuDHD (self-diagnosis is welcome)
* finding a “normal” 9–5 hard or impossible to sustain
* trying to build your own thing (or wanting to)
* and wanting to slowly move away from the usual work setup and create something that fits your brain better

It doesn’t have to be purely online ventures, but it should be something we can realistically support from a distance. If you have a local coffee shop, we obviously can’t all turn up for a latte, but we *can* help with things like marketing ideas, systems, etc. I’m not into strict rules, I just want the group to be genuinely useful.

In my head, the kind of support we give each other looks like:

* Using our different strengths so the community becomes a little “talent pool”
* Body doubling / co-working (even silently on video or just in chat)
* Helping each other with decision making and prioritizing what to do next
* Practical feedback on things like product descriptions, pricing, shop layout, landing pages
* Boosting each other’s visibility – watching reels all the way through, saving/liking/commenting, clicking through to new listings or websites, favoriting items, sharing stuff when it genuinely fits (no fake reviews, nothing sketchy)
* Sharing advice, systems and routines that actually help/save spoons (the opposite of the ""have you tried a planner?"" advice)

Basically, a community of ND women trying to not do this completely alone. Everything optional, space to show up within your capacity, and no guilt if you disappear for a while.

I’m imagining maybe a weekly or bi-weekly video call (video and mic optional) plus some kind of chat space (Discord/Slack/Signal/whatever people can handle).

If any of this sounds like you, I’d love to hear from you. You don’t have to write a novel, just share:

* your age + time zone
* what you’re doing or dreaming/hoping of doing
* what kind of support you’d actually use (feedback, accountability, emotional support, co-working, etc.)

If a community like this seems to resonate, I’d like to try a very low-pressure pilot and see what it’s like in reality, not just in my head.",1,1765360287.0,AuDHDWomen,0,1.0,False

I’m thoroughly introverted with a bold soul; connecting with someone who matches my energy enkindles that tendency like little else. I seek people who seek meaningful connection that plays out in several different ways, from daily casual chats to shared passions and endeavors. I appreciate the sudden whim of adventure as well.

I adore abstract minds and vibrant souls.

There is a gaggia cleaning guide on youtube which says clean every week the group (the machine inside) and every month put lubricant on it which i dont know where to find. Is that a bit too escessive? I know that i have to clean the coffee residue and water almost every day though.

How often do you clean and what parts of your machine?

I used to drink cold drip with the dripster 3 before in which i was wasting a lot of coffee because of how delicate the process is and not a thing must go even slightly wrong. So i decided to buy this espresso gaggia magenta plus to be able to drink my favorite freddo espresso (yes i am from greece) but the cold drip had much more aroma and i could sense much better every little coffee note, is thay normal?

I use 40ml shot, double shots, 4/5 coffee strenght and temperature on high - does the temperature on high burn the coffee?

1piyjqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/europeanparliament/comments/1piyjqg/my_device_my_choice/,"My Device, my Choice","So lately I really feel like a lot of tech we buy in Europe is kind of a joke. You pay a lot of money for something, but then you are not actually allowed to do what you want with it.

Example: you buy a 1200€ phone and the bootloader is locked shut. If you want to install your own software, nope, the company decides if you are allowed or not. Or consoles, where you literally cant even run a tiny homebrew app you wrote yourself, because everything is locked down like you are trying to commit a crime. Farmers have it even worse. Some tractors from John Deere literally refuse to start until the manufacturer gives remote permission, so farmers cant repair their own machines even if they know exactly what to do. Or stupid stuff at home, like a vacuum cleaner that stops working if your cloud account is banned, printers that dont work with 3rd party ink, coffee machines that block capsules that arent from the “approved” brand.

We buy the device, but in reality we rent it with 50 pages of ToS nobody reads.

I think the EU should extend the whole Right to Repair idea into something bigger:

**If you buy hardware, you own it. Thats it.**

* That should include:
* you can install whatever software you want
* you can repair and modify it
* you can use it offline, no forced cloud accounts
* no more “oh sorry you changed a setting so now your device self destructs lol”

This doesnt mean companies must open source everything or remove all security. And it also doesnt mean they cant ban you from their online services if you dont use a genuine device. Thats fine, if their software only runs on official hardware, ok. But what it *should* mean is that you can still use the hardware itself however you want. You should not be forced into their hardware plus software combo. If I want to modify my device or run totally different software on it, that should be allowed. I paid for the hardware, so I should be able to use the hardware.

Curious what other europeans think. Would you support something like this or is the current situation ok for you?

When G. Elliott Morris of Strength in Numbers asked ChatGPT to fact-check an article for him yesterday, the chatbot couldn’t get its head around modern America. It told him there were “multiple factual impossibilities” in his article, including his statements that “[t]he current Secretary of Defense is a former talk show host for Fox News,” “[t]he Deputy Director of the FBI used to guest-host Sean Hannity’s show,” and “Jeanine Pirro is the U.S. District Attorney for DC.”

“Since none of these statements are true,” it told Morris, “they undermine credibility unless signposted as hyperbole, fiction, or satire.”

But of course, Morris’s statements were not “factual impossibilities.” In the United States of America under President Donald J. Trump, they are true.

Trump has always been a salesman with an instinctive understanding of the power of media. That sense helped him to rise to power in 2016 by leveraging an image Republicans had embraced since the 1980s: that the reason certain white Americans were being left behind in the modern world was not that Republican policies had transferred more than $50 trillion from the bottom 90% of Americans to the top 1%, but that lazy and undeserving Black and Brown Americans and women were taking handouts from the government rather than working. 

When he got his disheartening fact-check from ChatGPT, Morris was preparing an article, published today, exploring “how cable news fueled the culture war and broke U.S. politics.” The article notes that most people care about and interact with the government through economic or affordability issues—prices, jobs, health care, social programs, and taxes—and that most laws are also about these issues. But, he points out, political rhetoric overwhelmingly focuses on issues like race, crime, immigration, LGBTQ+ rights, and guns: the so-called culture war.

Morris highlights a new academic paper by Shakked Noy of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Aakaash Rao of Harvard that links America’s culture war to changes in the media in the 1980s. Their research shows that “a distinctive business strategy” in cable news led it to emphasize culture over economic issues. Noy and Rao found that cable emphasizes culture because it “attracts viewers who would otherwise not watch news,” and attracts more viewers than an outlet can find by poaching viewers from other networks that emphasize economic issues. Cable channels have an incentive to produce culture war content, which in turn influences politics, as “constituencies more exposed to cable news assign greater importance to cultural issues, and politicians respond by supplying more cultural ads.”  

“In other words,” Morris writes, “when cable news producers decide to cover an issue more, voters subsequently say it is more important to them, and that issue is more predictive of how they’ll vote. TV news coverage, and cable in particular, has the power to choose which issues are most ‘salient’ for upcoming elections.” He notes that “this effect is almost entirely, or maybe even entirely, driven by Fox News,” and that right-wing politicians benefit most from it. Democrats get their highest marks from voters on issues not covered by cable news. 

Morris concludes that “more than the Republicans or Democrats, left or right, it’s the companies that abuse our attention for profit that are the real winners of American politics.”

This conclusion echoes a 2006 conversation a reporter for Financial Times held with Fox News Channel founder Rupert Murdoch and chief executive officer Roger Ailes.  In that conversation, when asked if running the Fox News Channel was “like running a political campaign,” Ailes responded: “No more than running a Dairy Queen. You have a customer, you have to market it to help them get to your product, the product has to be good, you can’t drop too many on the floor or in the sprinkles or you’ll lose money. All business is basically about customers and marketing and making money and capitalism and winning and promoting it and having something someone really wants.”

Ailes came to the Fox News Channel from his work packaging presidential candidate Richard Nixon in 1968. One Nixon media advisor explained how they could put their candidate over the top by transforming him into a media celebrity. “Voters are basically lazy,” the advisor told reporter Joe McGinnis. “Reason requires a high degree of discipline, of concentration; impression is easier. Reason pushes the viewer back, it assaults him, it demands that he agree or disagree; impression can envelop him, invite him in, without making an intellectual demand…. When we argue with him, we…seek to engage his intellect…. The emotions are more easily roused, closer to the surface, more malleable.”

Ailes presented Nixon in carefully curated televised “town halls” geared to different audiences, in which he arranged the set, Nixon’s answers to carefully staged questions, Nixon’s makeup, and the crowd’s applause. “Let’s face it,” he said, “a lot of people think Nixon is dull. Think he’s a bore, a pain in the ass.” But, carefully managed, television could “make them forget all that.” 

Ailes found his stride working for right-wing candidates, selling the narrative that Democrats were socialists who wanted to transfer wealth from hardworking white Americans to undeserving minorities and women. He produced the racist “Willie Horton” ad for Republican candidate George H.W. Bush in 1988, and a short-lived television show hosted by right-wing shock jock Rush Limbaugh in 1992. It was from there that he went on to shape the Fox News Channel after its launch in 1996.  

Ailes sold his narrative with what he called the “orchestra pit theory.” He explained: “If you have two guys on a stage and one guy says, ‘I have a solution to the Middle East problem,’ and the other guy falls in the orchestra pit, who do you think is going to be on the evening news?”

This is a theory Trump has always embraced, and one that drives his second term in office. He has placed television personalities throughout his administration—to the apparent disbelief of ChatGPT—and has turned the White House into, as media ally Steve Bannon put it, a “major information content provider.” What Trump does “is the action, and we just happen to be one of the distributors,” Bannon told Drew Harwell and Sarah Ellison of the Washington Post. The administration has replaced traditional media outlets with right-wing loyalists and floods the social media space with a Trump narrative that is untethered from reality. Communications director Steven Cheung says their goal is to create “FULL SPECTRUM DOMINANCE.”

Their attempt to convince Americans to accept their version of reality is showing now in Trump’s repeated extreme version of the old Republican storyline that the economy under him is great and that the country’s problems are due to Democrats, minorities, and women. 

Since voters in November elections turned against the Republicans, citing their concerns about the economy, Trump has doubled down on the idea that the idea of ""affordability"" is a “Democrat con job.” In an interview yesterday with Politico’s Dasha Burns, Trump said he would grade his economy “A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.” Any problems with it, he and his loyalists say, stem from former president Joe Biden’s having left them an economy in shambles. But in fact, in October 2024, The Economist called the American economy “the envy of the world.” 

As news cycles have turned against his administration on the economy—as well as the Epstein files, immigration sweeps, strikes on small boats in the Caribbean, and his mental acuity—Trump has tried to regain control of the narrative by diving into the orchestra pit. He has turned to an extreme version of the racism, sexism, and attacks on Americans who use the social safety net that have been part of Republican rhetoric for decades. He has gone out of his way to attack Somali Americans as “garbage,” to attack female reporters, and to use an ableist slur against Minnesota governor Tim Walz, whose son has a nonverbal learning disability, prompting imitators to drive by the Walz home shouting the slur.

The fight to control the media narrative is on display this week in a fight over a media merger. As Josh Marshall explained in Talking Points Memo yesterday, the media conglomerate Warner Bros. Discovery, which used to be called Time Warner and includes news division CNN, had agreed to be acquired by Netflix. But, as the deal was moving forward, Paramount Skydance launched a hostile takeover to get Warner Bros. Discovery for itself. 

David Ellison, son of right-wing billionaire Larry Ellison, who co-founded software giant Oracle, bought Paramount over the summer and appears to be creating a right-wing media ecosystem dominated by the Trumps. Part of the financing for his purchase of Warner Bros. Discovery would come from the investment company of Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as from Saudi and Qatari sovereign wealth funds. Paramount told Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders they should accept its offer because Trump would never allow the Netflix deal to happen, and as Marshall notes, Trump appeared yesterday to agree with that suggestion. 

The Paramount merger gave Ellison control of CBS, which promptly turned rightward. At stake now is CNN, which Netflix doesn’t particularly want but Paramount does, either to neuter it or turn it into another version of Fox News. Joe Flint, Brian Schwartz, and Natalie Andrews of the Wall Street Journal reported that Ellison told Trump he would make “sweeping changes” to CNN if Paramount acquires Warner Bros. Discovery. The Wall Street Journal reporters note that “Trump has told people close to him that he wants new ownership of CNN as well as changes to CNN programming.”

During the Gilded Age,  a similar moment of media consolidation around right-wing politics, a magazine that celebrated ordinary Americans launched a new form of journalism. S.S. McClure, a former coffee pot salesman in the Midwest, recognized that people in small towns and on farms were interested in the same questions of reform as people in the cities. He and a partner started McClure’s Magazine in 1893 and in 1903 published a famous issue that contained Ida Tarbell’s exposé of the Standard Oil Company, Lincoln Steffens’s exposé of the corruption of the Minneapolis municipal government, and Ray Stannard Baker’s exposé of workers’ violence during a coal strike.

Their carefully detailed studies of the machinations of a single trust, a single city, and a single union personalized the larger struggles of people in the new industrial economy. Their stories electrified readers and galvanized a movement to reform the government that had bred such abuses. McClure wrote that all three articles might have been titled “The American Contempt of Law.” It was the public that paid for such lawlessness, he wrote, and it was high time the public demanded that justice be enforced.

“Capitalists, workingmen, politicians, citizens—all breaking the law, or letting it be broken. Who is left to uphold it?” McClure asked. “The lawyers? Some of the best lawyers in the country are hired, not to go into court to defend cases, but to advise corporations and business firms how they can get around the law without too great a risk of punishment. The judges? Too many of them so respect the laws that for some ‘error’ or quibble they restore to office and liberty men convicted on evidence overwhelmingly convincing to common sense. The churches? We know of one, an ancient and wealthy establishment, which had to be compelled by a Tammany hold-over health officer to put its tenements in sanitary condition. The colleges? They do not understand.” 

“There is no one left,” McClure wrote, “none but all of us.”

The one where you wake up and realise the day has finally arrived. The day you’ve been dreading, anticipating, and over-preparing for in equal measure.  For us, it was the OFII “Visite d’Accueil.” The big welcome. The moment the French Republic decides if we are integrating well enough or if we need to be sent back to the classroom.

We moved to the Dordogne, near Bergerac, earlier this year. We bought an old stone house. We have a dog named Olive, but not a tree yet! We have a *Entrepreneur/Profession Libérale* visa. We thought we had a handle on things.

But the OFII appointment looms large.

It’s the final boss level of the initial visa process. A half-day in Bordeaux where they assess your French, sign you up for civic training, and generally inspect you. We were **under pressure**. Seriously, the morning started with the kind of chaos that usually signals a bad day. Our appointment was at 1:30 PM. Plenty of time, right? We aimed to leave at 11:00 AM. But at 10:40 AM, in a fit of nerves and clumsiness, I managed to throw an entire cup of coffee over myself.

And the paperwork.

Panic.

Change clothes. Reprint documents. We apologized profusely to Olive for delaying the start of her very important quiet, sleepy day, and finally bundled ourselves into the car.

# The Road to Bordeaux

The drive was mostly easy and uneventful, aside from one surreal moment. We were cruising along when we spotted two random dogs taking themselves for a casual walk down the hard shoulder of the A89! No owners in sight, just two pooches on a mission. It was a stark reminder to keep your eyes on the road.

While dealing with that mild heart attack, another realization hit me.

Here is a piece of uncommon common sense that almost nobody tells you until it’s too late: **Get a Crit d’Air sticker for your car.**

We were driving down the highway, feeling like we were on the **road to nowhere**, when I remembered the Low Emission Zones. I had planned to park right next to the OFII office in central Bordeaux. Easy. Convenient.

Illegal.

Bordeaux requires a Crit d’Air sticker to enter the city center. I had one on our old UK car for holidays years ago, but in the madness of moving and buying a French car, I had completely forgotten to get one for the new vehicle. And it’s a €68 fine if you get caught.

Change of plan. **Should I stay or should I go** into the city? Definitely not driving. We swerved off toward one of the many “Parc-relais” (Park and Ride), and clearly directed from the rocade with P+R signs.

Best. Decision. Ever.

We parked at a Parc-relais on the outskirts next to the Lauriers tram stop on the ‘A’ line. Here is the kicker: it cost us €3.50. Total. That covered the secure parking *and* the tram tickets for both of us (and it covers up to seven people in a car). If you are heading to the OFII in Bordeaux, do not drive into the city. Save your sanity. Take the tram. It’s a smooth 40-minute ride across the river, looking at the beautiful city, getting off at the Mériadeck stop. And I definitely recommend installing the TBM app on your mobile too so you can check the public transport map.

Mériadeck is a massive 70s concrete shopping beast, but it has everything. We grabbed a quick bite, stared blankly at the big Auchan supermarket, and tried to lower our heart rates.

# The Classroom

Fifteen minutes before the appointed hour, we joined a queue outside the OFII office. A man came out to call names, and we braced ourselves. But actually? The security guards at the door were incredibly friendly and welcoming. It was a small thing, but it did a lot to lower the blood pressure.

You show your “convocation” letter, your passport, go through the scanner, and then you are directed to a classroom.

It felt very much like being back at school. The room was set up with those tiny, combined desk-chairs that were definitely designed for malnourished teenagers in the 1950s, not for a 50-year-old man who enjoys French cheese. It was a tight squeeze.

At the front sat a woman who would be our guide for the afternoon. Before we even sat down, we had to go up to her desk individually to sign the attendance sheet.

This was a relief. Instead of asking the whole room at once, she asked us one-by-one, quietly at her desk: *Have you had lessons? Do you have certificates?*

It wasn’t a public inquisition. It was just a quick check-in. Once you sign, you find a seat.

Once everyone was seated, she explained the afternoon in French. Three parts. A written test. An oral interview. A contract signing. She told us we’d be done by 4:30 PM, but if anyone had a train to catch, tell her now. She was efficient, clear, and reassuring.

Then came the test.

# The Written Test (Don’t Panic)

You have 20 minutes. It sounds like a long time. It isn’t. The test is designed to get progressively harder, like a video game where the enemies just keep getting faster.

**Part 1:** Basic info. Name, address, phone number. If you fail this, you have bigger problems than French grammar.

**Part 2:** A text message exchange. You read a message from a “friend,” write a reply, read their response, and reply again. My tip? Be a magpie. Steal their words. If they ask, “Veux-tu aller au cinéma?” you write back, “Oui, je veux aller au cinéma.” Use the structure they give you. It’s a safety net.

**Part 3:** Reading comprehension. A block of text about a community service or event, followed by multiple-choice questions. It’s tedious, but the answers are staring you in the face if you look for keywords.

**Part 4:** The Boss Battle. A utility bill. A massive, expensive, incorrect utility bill. You have to write a letter to the company complaining and asking for a rectification.

Have you ever tried to argue about electricity tariffs in a language you’ve only really used to order croissants?

I wrote furiously. I looked at the prompt — it tells you exactly what points to cover. I used those bullet points to start my sentences. I didn’t finish it. And that is okay. The invigilator told us later: accuracy on the early stuff is better than a finished but garbled letter at the end.

# The Interview

We waited in the hallway. There’s a water fountain and toilets. The atmosphere was tense. People were called in one by one.

Then, Sarah and I were called. Together. We were the last ones.

We shuffled in. I wasn’t sure if this was a good thing or a bad thing. Sarah and I sat with the lady who had invigilated the test. She turned to me first.

“Introduce yourself.”

I took a breath. I gave my name. I spelled it out in French (l’alphabet is key, learn it!). I told her I was born in the UK but lived in Bergerac since March with my wife and our dog.

“What do you do?”

I explained my work. I completely forgot the fancy sentence I had practiced about working remotely on my laptop. I just blurted out that I had clients in the UK and EU and was looking for French ones.

She turned to Sarah. Sarah, being the star she is, answered brilliantly. I may have apologized for stealing the spelling of our surname. The lady laughed.

“You did well,” she said.

My brain, fried from the adrenaline, wanted to say “I am very scared.” In French, I said, “Je suis très peur.”

Grammatically, that’s not quite right (it should be *j’ai peur*). But she laughed. She knew what I meant. We were human. We were trying.

She marked our tests right there. She gave us a high A1 rating. Not fluent, but functional. Because we want to renew our visas for multiple years, we need to reach A2.

“I am assigning you online training,” she said.

**Sweet dreams are made of this.**

No mandatory 9 AM classes in a town an hour away. We got access to a platform called Frello. We can do it at home, in our pajamas, whenever we want. As long as we hit A2 within the year, we are golden.

# Signing the Contract

The final stage was another waiting game, then a meeting with an auditor to sign the *Contrat d’Intégration Républicaine* (CIR).

This was strictly administrative. She checked our passports. She asked for our phone numbers (say them in French if you can!). She verified our emails. She asked about our driving licenses and our Carte Vitales (Sarah is still waiting for hers — welcome to French bureaucracy).

Then, the Civic Training.

You have to do four days of “Civic Training.” It’s mandatory. It covers French history, values, and how the republic works. She booked us in for four dates early next year in Périgueux. Ping. Ping. Ping. Ping. Four emails and SMS messages landed on my phone instantly.

We signed the contract. We promised to respect the values of the Republic. We promised to learn the language.

And just like that, we were done.

# Walking on Sunshine (Sort of)

We walked out of the OFII office dazed. It wasn’t the nightmare we had built up in our heads. It was bureaucratic, yes. It was stressful, sure. But the people were human. They want you to integrate, not to fail.

We decided to walk off the adrenaline. We headed down to the Place des Quinconces. It was Christmastime, and the Marché de Noël was in full swing. Lights, the smell of *vin chaud*, the buzz of the city.

Just as we were about to dive into the market, Sarah froze.

“Sarah?”

Someone was calling her name. In the middle of Bordeaux, an hour and a half from home, we bumped into friends from the English-speaking group Sarah helps run in Bergerac.

What are the chances?

We ended the day eating *Choucroute Royale* in the Christmas market, laughing about the coffee spill, the random motorway dogs, and my bad grammar.

If you are prepping for your OFII visit, take a breath. Learn your alphabet. Don’t drive into the city center. And maybe, just maybe, don’t drink coffee while holding your paperwork five minutes before you leave.",2,1765359570.0,SettlingInFrance,0,1.0,False

Established in 1978 by real estate mogul, Lance Mulligan, this “piece of paradise” was intended to serve as a sort of trial run for the modern day ‘utopia’. While seemingly unremarkable, this small-town development process was no small event. Mulligan and his team made headlines around the entire state and even inspired many other successful tycoons around the country to do the same thing he was doing. Because of his stature in Texas, his funding was of no question, all he had to do was deal with the city and state governing bodies; which proved to be suspiciously easy. Things were moving fast, and Lance had an almost concerning amount of passion about getting this project up and running. During the construction in the fall and winter months, a few select number of families were chosen and invited to be the first residents of Mulligan’s Valley. After a swift summer grand opening, and all the big news had died down, things in the Valley were running smoothly. People settled into their new designer homes so quickly that you’d think that they’d lived there for their entire lives. From an outside perspective, it truly looked like a piece of paradise.

30 Years Later

By the spring of 2010, Mulligan’s Valley had become just that, a Valley. Though the town still held (most) of its structural integrity, it had become void of any sense of utopia, much less paradise. In 1986, Lance Mulligan was disgraced and on the verge of bankruptcy. The very next year, he was charged with five counts of embezzlement and tax fraud. When the authorities received an arrest warrant for him; Mulligan and his wife Lila, suddenly disappeared. That night when the police searched the town to see where they could have gone, all they found was their abandoned car, with both doors swung open to the hinges, sitting at the edge of Craven’s Quarry. The town moved on pretty quickly from their deaths,  but the quarry never opened back up to the public; and for thirty years there’s been a security guard on site around the spot where their car was found ever since.

Mulligan‘s dream had turned into any other overlooked small town in Texas. Over the years, those select number of families turned into anyone who was willing to move there, and The Valley fell into the ownership of the first wealthy person that offered to buy it. Some of the people willing to live there happened to be 16-year-old Charlie Jones and his family.

Charlie was your average teenager, who had normal hobbies, like photography and biking the town trails with his close group of friends. He kept solid b’s and c’s in school, which would be more than enough for him to get into a good state university when he applies next year. Charlie lived with his mother, Rose, who worked as vice principal at his high school, Halloran High, which was the only high school in town. His older sister, Veronica, a recent early graduate from Rice University, has just moved in back home before spring break. Charlie loved his small family and his small life in his small town.

The Phone At The Bottom Of Craven’s Quarry

BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! BE-

Veronica, hungover and annoyed, bursts into Charlie’s room and loudly slams on his alarm clock to turn off the blaring sounds. “How can you possibly sleep through that?” She says, while holding her forehead in her hand. Charlie, barely conscious, moans his witty remark, “I can’t, but usually there isn’t a strange unemployed woman in my room who wakes me up”.  “I set that for 8:15, it’s spring break, why do this to me?” Charlie says, as he yawns and sits up on his bed. “Blame Mom, she wanted to make sure you didn’t skip today.” Veronica walks out of the room and starts making herself a pot of coffee. Even though his mother, Rose had authority on campus and even more at his home, Charlie and his friends had a proclivity for skipping school on days where they thought would be spent better elsewhere.

Today was no different.

After waking up, Charlie starts his normal morning routine of hygiene and sitting on his bed while staring at his open closet trying pick his outfit for the day. In the middle of him changing, he hears a tap on his bedroom window; but when he went to check, there was nothing there. Charlie sat back down on his bed to tie his shoes and once again, a tap on his window. He cautiously opened his curtains another time and looked all around outside and just as he was starting to feel uneasy, Charlie’s best friend, Shaun Willmore, popped up from the ground. “WATCHU DOIN’ IN THERE?” Shaun screams at the window in an elderly accent. Charlie gives a sarcastic “ha ha” before opening the window to let Shaun in.

“You almost ready?” Shaun says while crawling through the windowsill. “Tracy and Noah are already on the way to the quarry to get set up.” “Yeah, give me one sec”, Charlie replies while finishing the final loops of his shoelaces. After sneaking into the kitchen and avoiding his sister to grab water bottles for their trip, the two friends grab their bags full of supplies ready for the day, and head out back through the window to start another adventure.

After a 45-minute sunny and breeze filled bike ride to the edge of town, Charlie and Shaun arrive at a stretch of an unkept, pine oak - filled forest that covered the rest of the way to Craven’s Quarry. The boys attempted to ride through the overgrown and out-rooted woods, but after one minute of bumping their years old bmx bikes on root knubs and and rocks, they decided to walk the rest of the way. When they arrived at border of the forest, A voice from the trees shouts “LEROY JENKINS!” As an arsenal of water balloons begins to get launched at Shaun and Charlie.

“Alright guys, you got water in my eardrum. Mission accomplished”, Shaun yells at the trees, as Tracy and Noah begin to climb down from their hiding spots with their buckets. “It was all Noah’s idea” Tracy says, with the biggest smile on her face that was so infectious it almost forced you to smile. “Hey! Throw me right under the bus, why don’t you?” Noah exclaims while laughing. “Sorry though boys, I walked outside this morning, and it just felt too good not to do to sumbody. You can point the blame at Tracy for that aerial guerilla attack; she’s the gymnast here. I’m pretty sure I pulled something on the way up and on the way down.”  The four friends, all together, start walking to the quarry cove, where the opening acted as the shore of a beach where people could sit and swim. After laying out all their blankets and putting their stuff down in their spots, they all sat down and sparked a joint. On this hot Friday morning, aside from a scattered call by a nearby bird, or a rare jump out of water from an energized bass, Craven’s Quarry was dead silent. “So what do you guys wanna do first?” Tracy says to the group, while looking in her bag for water. Charlie, stoned and looking up at the clouds, dozed off back asleep like he had never gotten out of his bed.

About an hour had passed and while Charlie is just waking up, the rest of the group placed their bikes on the ground, having returned from a journey into the unexplored trails. Shaun, Tracy, and Noah only sat down for a minute to drink some water and catch their breaths; then right back up they got, ready to take a swim in the Quarry.

“You coming, Sleeping Snookie? Or are you still working on your tan” Noah shouts as the three of them are waiting for Charlie to join them. Charlie begrudgingly takes off his shirt and his shoes and goes to join his friends in a cool dip in the water. Following four games of chicken, two lap races, and one game of ‘who can hold their breath the longest’, the group waded in the water together, enjoying their time in Texas sun. “Can it possibly get better than this?” Shaun says with a cheesed grin. “I would hope so. We still have a whole week ahead.”

The whole group laughed and smiled with each other. Then suddenly, a pale look appeared on all of their faces instantly. The distant and muffled vibration of a cell phone call started alarming underneath them. There was at least 10 feet of water between the bottom of their heels and the floor of the quarry where the sound was coming from.

MMMMMMMRRRRR - MMMMMMMMRRRR - MMMMMMMMRRRR

The thought of a working cellphone at the bottom of 15 feet of water was nightmare fuel enough for the group of friends to ride away from Craven’s Quarry and never return, but in that moment, a peculiar thought ran through Shaun’s head. “You already know what we have to do guys”

“Absolutely not”, Tracy says, with the same frightened look on her face. “We need to get out of here now.”

Ever since the disappearance of the Mulligan‘s, the residents of the valley knew that there was something off about Craven’s Quarry and that there was found no harm in staying far away from it. All of the friend groups’s parents had previously warned them about going near the quarry as well,  but  a town wide myth and mystery is every curious teenagers Achilles’ heel.

“I don’t think this is such a good idea”, Charlie exclaims as Shaun arrives back to the group holding a snorkel from his bag. “It’ll only be two minutes, then we can leave, I just need to see what I can find.” Shaun turns fully into the water and dives down to the floor. Two minutes and a dozen air bubbles go by and Shaun hasn’t come up to the surface. The three remaining friends start to go as deep as they can to the floor, but none of them were as good of swimmers as Shaun is. After minutes and minutes of trying to dive down, they become tired and even more afraid. “Oh my god” Tracy mumbles, trying to stop herself from crying. “We have to go get sumbody”, Noah says while splashing around frantically. “No one’ll get here in time, we have to save him ourselves” Charlie exclaims, trying to keep on a brave face. Just as the trio catch their breath and prepared to go back under once more, small bubbles began to raise up to the surface. Then, a pop and a splash from the water, leaving only a small, floating, algae covered, black object. “What the hell?”, they all say, almost in unison. Just as Noah was about to grab the device, the phone began to ring once more.

MMMMMMRRR-

Noah picked up the old flip phone before it could ring another time. “H-Hello” he said cautiously. After several unanswered seconds, Noah says in a disturbed tone “it just sounds like…water.” Immediately after finishing his sentence, Noah is dragged and taken under the water before he could even let out another breath. “What the fuck? NOAH!”, Tracy screams, as the silhouette of her best friend was submerged completely.

“C’mon Tracy, we need to get back to the shore now!” Charlie and Tracy start swimming frantically back to the shore, where all their stuff and their bikes laid. The noise of their gasps and anxious kicks in the water being the only sound in the area, echoed throughout the quarry. Before he could turn around to check and see if she was still close behind him, the sounds of Tracy‘s breaststrokes and heavy breathing suddenly went silent.

Charlie was all alone. Part of him was convinced that he was dreaming all of this; he could still be in bed waiting for his alarm to go off for a great last day of school or maybe he’s sleeping off his high on the lake shore and everything that has happened is just some THC induced fantasy.  Maybe none of this was real. That’s what Charlie hoped for.  Realizing that he could nearly touch the ground with his feet and that he was close to the shore, Charlie began to go full swim and then sprint the rest of the way. Charlie, finally back on land, made his way to his things where he could grab his cellphone out of his shoes.

Tripping on the rocks with his wet feet, Charlie crawled to his cellphone and began to go to his contacts to call his mom from school. Just as he arrived at her name, he looked up to see the faint current of the water washing away but leaving that same dirty phone on a pile of rocks. Charlie crawled over to it and began to investigate the device. Wiping the algae and grime off the exterior shell of the phone revealed a retro Motorola logo and an engraved L.M. on it. Charlie instantly knew who those initials stood for, everyone who ever lived in the valley did. Lance Mulligan and his wife were the reason why this spot was such a desired and feared place to adventure in. Right when Charlie begins to wrap his mind around everything and make the call to his mom, The phone that had caused all of these problems, rang once more.

MMMMMMMRRRRR - MMMMMMMRRRRR - MMMMMMMRRRRR- MMMMMMMRRRR-

Charlie was deathly afraid, but also oddly curious and suspecting of what would happen if he answered the phone call.

“HELLO?” Charlie yelled, trying to convince himself that he had any shred of confidence. “WHO THE HELL IS THIS?” Suddenly- A break in the static and a familiar breathing pattern came onto the line.  It was heavy, it was desperate and scared, it was — Shaun.

“Charlie…I’m sorry. We shouldn’t have come here, man”. All of a sudden, two giant chains made of water shot out of the lake and wrapped themselves tightly around Charlie’s ankles. “W-what!” As Charlie begins being pulled back to the depths of Cravens Quarry, he hears the tire squeals of a car from up above.

Jerry Forchheimer, the security of the quarry for the past five years, arrived late to his overlook post that morning.

“HELP!” exclaimed Charlie, as he was being dragged further and further down to where his friends had just met their fate. Fighting and scratching till his last breath, Charlie lets one last “HE-“ before being fully submerged in Craven’s Quarry. Only the soft ripples of the water remained as the four friends were taken away, never to be seen again.

Jerry gets out of his car too late. He begins his mundane patrol when he spots the groups bikes and supplies laying on the shore all nearby together. Zooming in closer with his binoculars, he gathers a detailed report of all of the items, and then begins to survey the water of the quarry.

He takes out his radio and makes a call.

Established in 1978 by real estate mogul, Lance Mulligan, this “piece of paradise” was intended to serve as a sort of trial run for the modern day ‘utopia’. While seemingly unremarkable, this small-town development process was no small event. Mulligan and his team made headlines around the entire state and even inspired many other successful tycoons around the country to do the same thing he was doing. Because of his stature in Texas, his funding was of no question, all he had to do was deal with the city and state governing bodies; which proved to be suspiciously easy. Things were moving fast, and Lance had an almost concerning amount of passion about getting this project up and running. During the construction in the fall and winter months, a few select number of families were chosen and invited to be the first residents of Mulligan’s Valley. After a swift summer grand opening, and all the big news had died down, things in the Valley were running smoothly. People settled into their new designer homes so quickly that you’d think that they’d lived there for their entire lives. From an outside perspective, it truly looked like a piece of paradise.

30 Years Later

By the spring of 2010, Mulligan’s Valley had become just that, a Valley. Though the town still held (most) of its structural integrity, it had become void of any sense of utopia, much less paradise. In 1986, Lance Mulligan was disgraced and on the verge of bankruptcy. The very next year, he was charged with five counts of embezzlement and tax fraud. When the authorities received an arrest warrant for him; Mulligan and his wife Lila, suddenly disappeared. That night when the police searched the town to see where they could have gone, all they found was their abandoned car, with both doors swung open to the hinges, sitting at the edge of Craven’s Quarry. The town moved on pretty quickly from their deaths,  but the quarry never opened back up to the public; and for thirty years there’s been a security guard on site around the spot where their car was found ever since.

Mulligan‘s dream had turned into any other overlooked small town in Texas. Over the years, those select number of families turned into anyone who was willing to move there, and The Valley fell into the ownership of the first wealthy person that offered to buy it. Some of the people willing to live there happened to be 16-year-old Charlie Jones and his family.

Charlie was your average teenager, who had normal hobbies, like photography and biking the town trails with his close group of friends. He kept solid b’s and c’s in school, which would be more than enough for him to get into a good state university when he applies next year. Charlie lived with his mother, Rose, who worked as vice principal at his high school, Halloran High, which was the only high school in town. His older sister, Veronica, a recent early graduate from Rice University, has just moved in back home before spring break. Charlie loved his small family and his small life in his small town.

The Phone At The Bottom Of Craven’s Quarry

BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! BE-

Veronica, hungover and annoyed, bursts into Charlie’s room and loudly slams on his alarm clock to turn off the blaring sounds. “How can you possibly sleep through that?” She says, while holding her forehead in her hand. Charlie, barely conscious, moans his witty remark, “I can’t, but usually there isn’t a strange unemployed woman in my room who wakes me up”.  “I set that for 8:15, it’s spring break, why do this to me?” Charlie says, as he yawns and sits up on his bed. “Blame Mom, she wanted to make sure you didn’t skip today.” Veronica walks out of the room and starts making herself a pot of coffee. Even though his mother, Rose had authority on campus and even more at his home, Charlie and his friends had a proclivity for skipping school on days where they thought would be spent better elsewhere.

Today was no different.

After waking up, Charlie starts his normal morning routine of hygiene and sitting on his bed while staring at his open closet trying pick his outfit for the day. In the middle of him changing, he hears a tap on his bedroom window; but when he went to check, there was nothing there. Charlie sat back down on his bed to tie his shoes and once again, a tap on his window. He cautiously opened his curtains another time and looked all around outside and just as he was starting to feel uneasy, Charlie’s best friend, Shaun Willmore, popped up from the ground. “WATCHU DOIN’ IN THERE?” Shaun screams at the window in an elderly accent. Charlie gives a sarcastic “ha ha” before opening the window to let Shaun in.

“You almost ready?” Shaun says while crawling through the windowsill. “Tracy and Noah are already on the way to the quarry to get set up.” “Yeah, give me one sec”, Charlie replies while finishing the final loops of his shoelaces. After sneaking into the kitchen and avoiding his sister to grab water bottles for their trip, the two friends grab their bags full of supplies ready for the day, and head out back through the window to start another adventure.

After a 45-minute sunny and breeze filled bike ride to the edge of town, Charlie and Shaun arrive at a stretch of an unkept, pine oak - filled forest that covered the rest of the way to Craven’s Quarry. The boys attempted to ride through the overgrown and out-rooted woods, but after one minute of bumping their years old bmx bikes on root knubs and and rocks, they decided to walk the rest of the way.

1piycff,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1piycff/what_can_i_use_for_a_pickup_without_caffeine_or/,What can I use for a pick-up without caffeine or sugar?,"So I had an addiction to caffeine a few years ago. Really bad. 6 to 12 a day for a year, I cluding holidays and weekends, replaced all my meals, got sent to hospital with bleeding eyes and constant vomitting. Not a fun time. 

I now have a caffeine intolerance. Even one cup of instant coffee makes me incredibly sick. More than that, and I have tachycardia and blood pressure issues. Other caffeine things are out too. Energy drinks, some soft drinks, even some times of tea can make me feel sick on a bad day after just one cup! 

So I kicked that addiction, but ended up transferring the reliance to sugar. No coffee in the morning after not sleeping well? Just have a bit of chocolate. A couple biscuits with a chai. A piece of cake before breakfast. Anything to get my brain moving. A little sugar high doesn't last as long as coffee, but it's *something*. 

Trouble is, I'm now fat. Too much sugar. Been trying all year to lose weight, and while I have made progress, that remains as my main issue for a healthy lifestyle. I don't have a replacement for sugar to get me waking up in the morning, or to keep me going when I've been studying all day and by 3pm my brain is fried! The only drink I have to even placebo me into working is a latte, decaf, almond milk and hazelnut syrup. I don't want to think about how many calories are in that syrup alone. Other times chai, but I genuinely don't understand how cafe chai is so damn high in calories! 

But even then, they're a placebo. And often don't work. 

I've tried the ""healthy energy"" things. Fruit, water, electrolytes, protein, etc. And they work fine for a normal day, but if I have to cram an assignment, didn't sleep well, or it's just that time of the month and I feel like crap, it doesn't cut it. So every time that happens, I somehow end up buying shit I shouldn't have. Even cost isn't an obstacle, because my insane demand for sugar will lead me to just eat straight cooking chocolate, because real chocolate is too expensive! And not even the good cooking chocolate! The shit one that leaves a weird taste in your mouth. 

And even if I resist, and I dont get anything, I just feel flat, tired, and unable to properly do my job or study for a whole day. Or more! 

Sorry for the vent, but does anyone know anything that actually helps get you up and going ths todensf have ANY caffeine, and is low in calories? I don't think it exists except for straight up drugs, and I'm not going down the road of addiction again. I need to lose weight because my doctor suspects I have a connective tissue disorder, and excess weight is a major risk factor for that. But my progress has been so slow this year, and when I injured myself and couldn't keep up my routines, I gained it all back in just two months! 

I'm posting this because I caight myself planning which meals I can skip with the least impact to my work, and realised that's probably not the best way to go about it. I'm just gonna get grouchy, tired, and binge on sugar again. -_- 

Any suggestions are welcome. I'm struggling to get past it, and I just miss coffee so much. ",2,1765359005.0,loseit,3,1.0,False

The Setup:
Machine: Lelit Elizabeth PL92T (Brand new).
Dose: 16g in the stock double basket.
Grinder situation: I bought a Varia VS3 (Gen 2). I tried grinding at the absolute finest setting (zero point/burrs touching).
Current test: Since the Varia didn't work, I returned it and am currently testing with fresh pre-ground espresso from a specialty roaster to rule out user error with the grinder.
The Issue:
No matter what I use (Varia at max fineness OR pre-ground), the result is identical:
Shot time: 16g in -> 35g out in about 15 seconds (Turbo gush).
Pressure: The gauge only reads 3-4 bar during the shot.
Taste: Extremely sour / underextracted.
The Confusing Part (The Puck):
Despite the fast flow and low pressure, the puck knocks out cleanly in one piece. It is relatively dry/solid, not a soupy mess. This confuses me: If it's gushing that fast, shouldn't the puck be destroyed? Or does a dry puck just confirm that the water is flowing through too large gaps (too coarse)?
Diagnostics I've done:
Blind Basket: With the blind basket, the machine instantly hits 10-11 bar. So the pump seems functional.
Pre-infusion: Turned OFF in the LCC to test. Still low pressure (3 bar) and fast flow.
My Question:
Is it possible that my machine has a defect where it delivers water but fails to pressurize the basket properly during a shot? Or is it simply that the Varia VS3 (even at 0) and the pre-ground coffee are BOTH simply not fine enough for a 58mm Lelit basket? Has anyone experienced a Varia VS3 not being able to choke a machine at the finest setting?
Thanks for helping me out!

1piy9zf,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1piy9zf/my_coffees_fo_2025/,My Coffees fo 2025,"Well, I started this year with recording each brew in bean then dropped midway as I did not have the paitence for it, but as I was reviewing all the bags that I finished in the year I was relishing all the cups and experiences I had with all the coffees, the last two are the ones that I am drinking right now. 

  
I got to try a lot of international coffee this year, and as I progressed I felt buying some international coffee was cheaper at times than the fancy indian ones. Overall a good year of pour overs and some espresso. 

  
Some general thoughts

* We will see more varitals in the next year (Excelsa specifically)
* At current price rate increase, international coffees feel approachable at times
* Washed beans are hard to find, with everyone trying to be funky and getting additional value with processing
* More Indian Gesha than what we could have hoped 

  
The one that I enjoyed the most this year was the gesha from libertario and the Pink Bourban from Common Man Coffee roasters. 

  
With so many funky coffee's this year I am planning to move back to more washed coffees in 2026.

What do I do?,"About me - I'm male, very early 20s, been dealing with unilateral facial pain in the upper lip region for about 6 years now.

Originally was told it was dental, then had an MRI to which a neurosurgeon wrote:

> His MRI scan shows that there is a small vessel close to the trigeminal nerve but without severe mass effect or impingement at the origin of the trigeminal nerve at the brainstem.

And:

> However he clearly needs to be under surveillance for his trigeminal neuralgia and then I will leave that to the expertise of my colleague.

Following that, I saw a consultant doctor, the aforementioned colleague, who insisted there was no indication of TN (when I met him I was in a pain-free period). The diagnosis was as follows:

1. Right sided atypical neuralgiform pain

2. Differential diagnoses:

A: Atypical facial pain

B: Trigeminal autonomic cephalgia

C: Trigeminal neuralgia (extremely unlikely from clinal features) 

MRI brain with MR internal auditory meatus entirely normal (no convincing neurovascular compromise) 

Normal neurological examination - he said this as when he examined me (touched my face) there was no pain. An episode started up a few weeks later. Also:

> I have reviewed his scan at the time of dictating the letter and the small blood vessel is not in extreme close proximity or impinging or pushing the right trigeminal nerve root at all.

He gave me indomethacin for the trigeminal autonomic cephalgia, which had no effect at all.

He was trying to walk me into saying it was directly correlated to stress, it isn't always though.

He also suggested it was a dissociative symptom or linked to Functional Neurological Disorder.

The rest of the advice was:

> 8. I have also advised him to make sure that he drinks more than 2 L of fluid a day, eat three regular meals a day, avoid caffeine and take decaf coffee/tea for 12 months and avoid citrus fruits, citrus drinks, fizzy pops and ensure eight hours of sleep and not to lie in.

This was 2 years ago, and 4 years after the pain started. Since then, I have continued to have episodes of pain, even more severe than before I saw the neurologists. They have had maybe 6 months maximum pain-free time between. 

I have no clue what to do at this point. The last doctor I saw said I need no follow ups and no medications.

Am I just meant to accept it?

One day I was sitting in my room and I heard a loud clunk outside my window. 
I looked outside and saw a can of coffee, a lighter, and a bunch of trash all spilled all over my driveway.
I went outside to look and there was a long scratch and dent on my car that matched where the can fell. 

I was very confused so I looked at the footage on my camera. In broad daylight a group of motorcycles drove by and lobbed a can of coffee at my car and threw a bunch of stuff at my car and house. Got their license plates, faces and everything. They weren't wearing helmets, gloves, or anything.

We called the police, they came out, watched the footage and took finger prints off the items. 
The detective who watched the footage told us that it appears that the bikers intentionally threw the items. 

Fast forward a few weeks later, the fingerprints come back and they give us the name of the person. 

The result was that the insurance company told us the biker wouldn't pay up unless WE apologized to THEM for the inconvenience, whatever that means. That's obviously absurd, so we didn't. 

Now the police sent us a letter saying that they found that the bikers ""did nothing wrong"" and nothing more will happen. 

What's going on here?
The police had fingerprints, clear damage, and 4k footage of them doing it. But they said there was no proof they did anything?

Over the last five weeks, I managed to bring my **LDL down from 135 mg/dL to 91 mg/dL**, and honestly, the changes I made were pretty straightforward.

Originally, I hadn’t planned to recheck my cholesterol for at least three months. That felt like a reasonable timeframe to see whether the lifestyle changes were actually working. But I ended up needing new blood tests for an unrelated health issue. I wasn’t expecting much change yet, so the results came as a genuine surprise.

The biggest shift was in how I ate day-to-day. I cut out the things that were making the biggest impact on my cholesterol: **butter, milk, cheese, red meats, pastries and sweets**. Instead, I focused on simple, consistent meals I could stick to.

Most mornings I had a bowl of **oats with chia seeds, banana, blueberries and raspberries** which became my go-to breakfast and made the whole routine feel effortless. Lunch and dinner were mostly **fish or chicken**, and whenever I needed something to snack on, I reached for **hummus, vegetables, nuts or fruit**.

I didn’t go extreme with carbs either, still had **rice, pasta, potatoes, coffee, and almond milk**, just in moderation. I’m also fairly active and walk a lot thanks to my photography.

I expected it to undo my progress, but the consistent habits before and after the trip still carried me forward.

I’m honestly proud of the result and surprised by how quickly the numbers changed. It’s been a good reminder that small, steady choices every day can make a huge difference, without feeling impossible or restrictive.",2,1765357460.0,Cholesterol,0,0.75,False
1pixy9g,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1pixy9g/what_teambuilding_actually_worked_for_your_small/,What team-building actually worked for your small team? (Here's what worked for us),"Small business owner here with a team of 15. I've tried various team-building activities over the years, and I wanted to share what's actually worked vs. what flopped - hoping to get your experiences too.

## The Problem with Most Team Building:

Let's be honest - most team building is either:
- **Cringey** (trust falls, forced icebreakers, rope courses)
- **Expensive** (escape rooms, fancy offsites, consultants)
- **Boring** (another happy hour, another dinner)
- **Exclusive** (sports that favor athletic people, drinking-focused)

My team is mixed: ages 24-58, various fitness levels, some introverts, some don't drink. Finding something everyone would actually enjoy (not just tolerate) was tough.

## What We Tried - The Results:

### ❌ Escape Room ($450 for 15 people)
- **Flopped:** Only 3-4 people actually participated, rest stood around watching
- Felt like watching the ""smart people"" solve puzzles
- Introverts felt pressured, didn't enjoy

### ❌ Bowling ($300)
- **Meh:** Some people loved it, others were bored waiting for turns
- Became drinking-focused
- Not much actual team interaction

### ✅ Volunteer Day (Habitat for Humanity) ($0)
- **Success!** Everyone felt good about it
- Good conversations while working
- BUT: Hard to organize regularly, weather-dependent

### ✅ Scavenger Hunt Around Downtown ($50)
- **Surprise win!** This worked better than expected
- Everyone participated naturally
- Teams formed organically (mixed departments)
- People still reference it months later
- Found new lunch spots near the office

## Why the Scavenger Hunt Worked:

**1. Active participation** - No one could just watch from sidelines

**2. Natural collaboration** - Had to work together to solve clues and find locations

**3. Exploration** - People enjoyed discovering parts of downtown they'd never seen

**4. Flexible** - Teams could go at their own pace, choose their own strategy

**5. Inclusive** - Mix of mental and physical challenges, something for everyone

**6. Budget-friendly** - Used a free platform (scavenge.rs), only cost was drinks after

**7. Easy to organize** - Took me maybe an hour to set up

**8. Time-efficient** - 90 minutes for hunt + 30 min debrief = no full-day commitment

## What We Did:

Created 10 challenges around our neighborhood:
- ""Find the best street art and take a team photo""
- ""Interview a local business owner about their success tips""
- ""Find a coffee shop none of you knew existed""
- ""Recreate a public statue as a team""
- ""Document 5 eco-friendly practices you see""

Teams competed for fastest completion with photo proof. Winner got gift cards.

## Unexpected Benefits:

- Found 6 new lunch spots within walking distance
- One employee met a potential client during the hunt
- Cross-department relationships improved (intentionally mixed teams)
- Great content for social media
- People asked to do it again next quarter

## My Question for Other Small Business Owners:

**What team-building has actually worked for your team?**

Looking for ideas for next quarter. Our criteria:
- Under $500 for 15 people
- 2-4 hours max
- Weekday afternoon friendly
- Inclusive (mixed ages, fitness, interests)
- Actually fun (not forced)

**What flopped for you?** 

I'm convinced most ""team building"" is a waste of money, but a few gems exist. What are yours?

---

**Also curious:**
- How often do you do team building? (We do quarterly)
- Required or optional attendance?
- Do you measure impact, or just go by vibes?
- Any activities that *sound* good but actually suck?

Budget: Prefer under $200/event, but willing to spend more if it's genuinely worth it.

---

*P.S. - Not affiliated with any team-building companies, just want to stop wasting money on activities my team hates.*",1,1765357373.0,smallbusiness,1,1.0,False

	•	Sertraline 100 mg daily for mild depression.
	•	Otherwise generally healthy.

What I’ve been doing for the last week:
	•	16:8 intermittent fasting every day (eating window roughly [e.g. 11:00–19:00]).
	•	During the eating window I typically eat:
	•	~5 whole eggs per day
	•	tomatoes
	•	avocado
	•	on some days a banana and a couple of plain yoghurts
	•	Outside the window: water / black coffee / unsweetened tea only.
	•	My first exposure to IF/keto has mostly been from watching some Eric Berg videos, which is why I am leaning toward this structure (16:8 + 5 eggs/day and possibly a 5-day strict keto phase).

What I’m specifically asking you as doctors:
	1.	Given my UC (in remission) on Stelara, plus Vyvanse and sertraline, do you see any medical red flags with:
	•	daily 16:8 intermittent fasting, and
	•	eating around 5 whole eggs per day as a staple protein/fat source?
	2.	Is a short 5-day strict keto diet (very low carb, higher fat, normal calories) reasonably safe in my situation, or would you advise against it?
	3.	Are there particular risks I should be aware of (for example: cholesterol/heart risk from the eggs, impact on UC, interactions with Vyvanse or sertraline, or effects on mood/anxiety)?
	4.	Are there any baseline tests (bloods, lipids, etc.) you would recommend before I continue this approach or make it more intense?

I’m not looking for help with weight loss targets, just a safety assessment and any modifications you would suggest. I will follow up with my own doctors, but I’d like your professional view on whether this combination (16:8 IF, 5 eggs/day, possible short keto phase) is sensible or risky for someone with my history and medications.",1,1765357357.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

My Personal Method That Helped Me Abort a Cluster Headache (Anecdotal Only)
I want to share something that has helped me personally during the early moments of a cluster headache. This is not medical advice, just my own experience in case it helps someone else or gives them something to discuss with a doctor.

What I did
At the very start of a cluster headache, I did three things quickly, one after the other:

Chugged a cold Red Bull
(Fast caffeine + taurine.)

Drank cold water to trigger a “brain freeze.”
(A sudden cold shock to the trigeminal nerve.)

Did intense exercise for about a minute
(Push-ups / lifting weights until I was breathing hard.)

What happened for me
After doing all three steps in quick sequence, the headache stopped developing and the attack seemed to vanish.

Why this might make sense
This combination overlaps with things that other cluster sufferers sometimes use:

Cold stimulation (ice packs, cold air)

Fast caffeine intake (coffee, energy drinks)

Intense exertion (similar to how high-flow oxygen can help some people)

My method just happens to mix all three at once.

Important notes
This is not a general recommendation — just one individual’s experience.

Energy drinks and sudden heavy exercise can be risky for some people.

Cluster headaches are serious, and it’s still important to talk to a doctor about proper treatments.

If you try something similar, please be safe and listen to your body. I’m sharing this only in case it helps someone ask better questions or discover a pattern that works for them.",1,1765356681.0,clusterheads,0,1.0,False

1pixpda,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotivationByDesign/comments/1pixpda/6_sciencebacked_ways_to_be_instantly_more/,6 SCIENCE-BACKED Ways to Be Instantly More Likeable (No People-Pleasing Required),"Let’s be honest: likability gets you places. More friends. More job offers. More “let me help you with that.” But being likeable isn't about being fake or constantly saying yes like some people-pleasing robot. I’ve noticed a weird trend on TikTok and Instagram lately, where influencers are giving out “how to be liked” advice that’s either manipulative or just plain wrong. Stuff like “mirror their body language” or “laugh at everything they say.” No thanks.

So I did what I do best: went deep into the real research. I’ve spent the last 3 months pulling insights from psychology books, social science research, bestselling authors, and killer podcast interviews. The result? Six powerful, low-effort, science-backed ways to become more likeable that don’t involve selling your soul or obsessing over what others think.

These tips aren’t hacks. They’re honest shifts in behavior and mindset that actually work. And if you use them well, people won’t just like you more, they’ll respect you more, too.

Here’s what I wish more people knew.

- Tip 1: Be high-warmth, low-ego  
  - According to Harvard psychologist Amy Cuddy, people judge others on two traits first: warmth and competence. But warmth comes first.  
  - In her bestselling book Presence, Cuddy says that people are more drawn to those who make them feel safe, heard, and respected. Low ego = high connection.  
  - Don’t dominate convos. Ask smart, curious questions. Nod. Mirror emotions. That shows you’re not in it to impress, but to relate.

- Tip 2: Use the “frequency effect” (aka, be seen more often)  
  - There’s a psychological bias called the “mere exposure effect.” The more we see someone, the more we like them.  
  - A 2000 study in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology found students rated others as friendlier and more attractive simply because they attended class more often, even if they never spoke.  
  - Translation: Show up. At the gym. At events. In the group chat. You don’t even have to be the loudest. Just be there often enough to become familiar.

- Tip 3: Talk 40% less but better  
  - Research from University of California, Santa Barbara shows that dominant talkers are often liked less over time.  
  - The key is to talk just enough. About 40% of the time, according to social balance theory.  
  - Instead of trying to be interesting, be interested. Repeat the last few words someone says. Ask “How did that feel?” instead of “What did you do next?”  
  - Stop trying to impress people. Start being curious about them.

- Tip 4: Own your flaws (don’t flex too hard)  
  - Psychologists call this the “pratfall effect.”  
  - When competent people admit to small mistakes or flaws, they actually become more likeable.  
  - A classic 1966 Harvard study showed that a person who spilled coffee during an interview was rated more favorably than someone who didn’t—if they were otherwise competent.  
  - Share that awkward moment from your week. Laugh at your weird habits. It makes you human as hell, and people crave that.

- Tip 5: Match vibe, not volume  
  - You don’t need to be loud or extroverted to be liked. You just need to mirror energy levels.  
  - A recent review in the journal Current Directions in Psychological Science shows that social mimicry (subtle) builds unconscious trust.  
  - Match posture, speech pace, tone not in a creepy way, just enough to be in sync.  
  - It’s about resonance, not performance.

- Tip 6: Give identity-based compliments  
  - Generic praise (like “nice shoes”) doesn’t hit the same as compliments that affirm someone’s identity.  
  - In a 2017 study from Stanford, people reacted better to compliments like “You’re such a thoughtful person” vs. “That was a nice thing you did.”  
  - Compliment who they are, not just what they did. Say things like:  
    - “You always make people feel so cared for.”  
    - “You’ve got a gift for making hard things simple.”  
    - “You’re one of those people who lights up a room without even trying.”  
  - It feels personal, deep, and way more memorable.

Books that’ll make you 100x better at this (and yes, they’re actually enjoyable to read):

- How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie  
  - Over 30 million copies sold. Classic for a reason.  
  - Carnegie breaks down how to build real rapport, make people feel valued, and navigate social situations with charm without being manipulative.  
  - This is the best people-skills book I’ve ever read. Simple, direct, timeless.

- The Like Switch by Jack Schafer  
  - Written by a former FBI behavior analyst.  
  - This book dives deep into the science of likability, persuasion, and trust.  
  - Some tips sound small (like eyebrow flashes and head tilts), but they’re SO effective.  
  - This book will make you rethink every social interaction. Insanely good read.

- The Charisma Myth by Olivia Fox Cabane  
  - NYT bestseller that explains why charisma isn’t innate, it’s a set of learnable behaviors.  
  - Cabane combines neuroscience with storytelling and gives real scripts to use in everyday convos.  
  - This book will make you question everything you think you know about charisma. It’s a game-changer.

Podcasts and YouTube Channels I swear by when it comes to understanding social psychology:

- Hidden Brain (NPR)  
  - Created by Shankar Vedantam, a former social science correspondent.  
  - Each episode explores why we act the way we do but especially in relationships, decisions, and social contexts.  
  - If you want to understand the human brain in a fun and non-boring way, start here.

- The Science of People (YouTube)  
  - Run by Vanessa Van Edwards, behavioral investigator and bestselling author.  
  - Her videos dissect charisma, likability, body language, and micro-interactions.  
  - Watch one video and you’ll never see small talk the same way again.

- The Art of Charm (Podcast)  
  - Interviews with psychologists, behavioral experts, and social intelligence pros.  
  - Covers how to create better first impressions, improve emotional intelligence, and become more magnetic in less time.  
  - Not cheesy, not cringe. Just genuinely useful stuff.

We’ve been sold the idea that being liked means being loud, good-looking, or extroverted. Not true. Science says being genuinely present, curious, and kind is what really matters. You don’t have to be the funniest, the smartest, or the most interesting person in the room. You just need to make people feel good while they’re around you. That’s the real cheat code.

I am 6 days in and will double my dose to 150mg SR 2 times per day tomorrow.

I have really enjoyed the effects so far, and the only noticeable side effect has been insomnia, which has become more and more of an issue every night since I started

So I want to hear if you have any tips for dealing with that? I assume it wont get easier when I start dosing twice per day.

I still consume nicotine but in low amounts, and I do have 1 cup of coffee in the morning. I plan to quit the coffee and nicotine shortly though (ofc), as I dont feel I need more energy than the Zyban gives and it might help insomnia.

In a dietary culture dominated by ""high calories and high fat,"" Puerh tea is exactly what we need.

Heartbreak, Pies, and Second-Chance Sparks: ""Love Served With A Slice Of Break-Up Pie"" Just Baked Up the Slow-Burn Reunion I've Been Craving – Who's Ready for Some Sweet Revenge? Ever had your heart shattered at 20, only to rise like a perfectly proofed dough five years later as a badass bakery owner slinging sass and cinnamon rolls? That's Raylene Walker for you – flying cross-country for her online soulmate, only to get hit with the cruelest ""not you"" bombshell ever. Fast-forward: She's owning Chicago's sweetest spot, curves and confidence on full display, while *he* – billionaire playboy Michael Jayden Schilling – struts back into town like he didn't ghost her dreams. But when body-shaming trolls crash her vibe and Michael's brooding bestie Bryan steps up as her unexpected hype man (loving those ""extra layers"" unapologetically), old flames flicker, regrets simmer, and suddenly, forgiveness tastes like forbidden fruit pie. Will she serve him a slice of humble pie... or let the heat rise into something spicier?

I scarfed down the first two chapters this morning over coffee (pro tip: pair with actual pie), and *chef's kiss* – the prologue's raw heartbreak had me ugly-crying into my latte, while Chapter 2's post-breakup glow-up? Pure empowerment porn. Raylene's not just surviving; she's *thriving*, belting Kelly Clarkson while baking ""break-up pies"" that scream ""you fumbled *this* queen."" And that tension when Michael reappears? Slow-burn deliciousness that'll have you flipping pages like you're dodging spoilers.

The synopsis slays – here's the crumb that got me hooked:

>""At the age of twenty, Raylene Walker believed she had found true love. When she flies halfway across the country to meet her long-distance boyfriend, Michael Jayden Schilling, she's sent back home heartbroken and confused. Five years later, Raylene is living her dream of owning a successful bakery in Chicago. And Michael has spent the past five years becoming one of the most popular billionaires in the country. So imagine Raylene's surprise when she discovers that the man who broke her heart five years ago, AKA 'He Who Shall Not Be Named' has relocated to Chicago. What will happen when Michael discovers that the innocent girl he once loved has become a feisty, confident woman with a loyal fan base of her own? Sparks begin to fly when Raylene comes under attack from body-shaming bullies, and she finds an unlikely ally in Michael's long-time best friend, Bryan Scott, who doesn't see a problem with Raylene's 'extra layers'. Will Michael seek forgiveness for his past mistakes, or will he remain an arrogant playboy, and will Raylene finally find love and acceptance?""

Tucker or *The Wall of Winnipeg and Me* hit your sweet spot, this bakery-fueled redemption arc will have you rooting for Raylene harder than a Black Friday sale on mixers.

On the surface, it’s coffee shops, tech start-ups, ferry rides, and traffic on I-5. Underneath, it’s Veil Accords, old blood pacts, and things with teeth and claws that never left when the world moved on. Vampires, werewolves, witches, hunters, and utterly mundane humans all move through the same city lights and back roads, working, loving, surviving… and trying very hard not to let the truth slip into the headlines.



The group focuses on character-driven, freeform storytelling: slice-of-life scenes, slow-burn drama, supernatural investigations, quiet horror, and the messy politics of keeping the secret in a city wired with cameras and social media. Want to play the exhausted FBI agent who keeps catching cases that don’t make sense, the bartender whose regulars include both wolves and cops, the occultist in a Capitol Hill walk-up who knows too much, or the hunter who’s starting to doubt the cause? There’s a rich, established lore foundation—werewolf packs, vampire societies, hunter cells, government departments, and more—but it’s built to give you hooks, not fences.



*Back Roads & City Lights* is a collaborative sandbox for players who enjoy long-term arcs, found family, and consequences that actually matter. Plots can be intimate or sprawling: a single rainy night in a Pioneer Square alley, a multi-thread investigation running from Belltown to the backwoods, or the slow unraveling of a character who realizes the world is nothing like they thought. If you’re looking for a grounded modern setting with room to tell your stories—where the supernatural is hidden but never passive—we’d be happy to have you pull off the highway, park under the flickering neon, and step into the dark with us.

1pixime,https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfLoathingSavedMe/comments/1pixime/universality_and_stagnation_iv/,Universality and Stagnation IV,"
The OS is equivalent to human identity.

The OS and editing, which I discussed earlier, are not separate concepts but are oriented toward the same axis.

Editing is the process of constructing one’s own context and growing through it, while the OS is the operational background through which humans interpret the world, and it forms the foundation of identity.

Therefore, identity is not a matter of having some fixed “trait,” but a question of how one’s worldview structure—one’s OS—has been formed and how it has been updated.

When we think of a smartphone, we tend to think first of its features, apps, or design, but the element that actually determines how everything operates is the OS.

And the hardware running this OS—the brain—is not significantly different from person to person.

What creates the difference is not the hardware, but the accumulation of experience.
Repeated life experiences—environment, relationships, shocks, habits, culture—stack over time, continuously updating the OS in the way most suitable for each individual.

These accumulated updates become the foundational structure of identity.

Visible behaviors—speech, preferences, goals, relational styles—are closer to apps, while the deep structure that allows, restricts, and interprets all of those is the OS.

Thus, human identity is not personality, but the core worldview structure through which one sees and understands the world.

In summary, identity here is not an image of “what kind of person I am,” but rather the OS in the sense of “how I have learned to read and interpret the world.”

Identity is not a conscious self-introduction but the interpretive engine that is always running in the background, often outside of one’s awareness.

Just as Android and iOS operate on entirely different architectures, human OSs are optimized differently.

The same event is stored differently by each person, the same words are converted into different emotions, and even when facing the same choice, completely different conclusions emerge.

Identity does not arise from the design of the brain but from a personalized OS—an algorithm of worldview—compressed and accumulated through life experience.

Ultimately, our lives are driven by the points where my OS, the OS of the environment, and the OSs of other people collide within the massive system we call society.

Interpretation, judgment, relationships, emotion, and choice all occur within these collisions among the three structures.

From this perspective, the statement “this is just who I am” is less a claim about innate personality and more an admission that “I possess an OS trained to read and react to the world in this particular way.”

Identity is not a fixed label but an operational structure that is continually readjusted as it passes through collisions with the environment’s OS and the OSs of others.

So how does the OS keep growing heavier?
Many people misunderstand updates as processes that organize, optimize, and lighten.

The word “update” naturally carries expectations of maturity and improvement.

But in reality, OS updates work in the opposite way.

Updating does not empty things out; it puts more in.

More functions, more settings, more data.

As functions increase, dependencies increase, and the number of things that must be managed grows, making the system heavier.

Just as a smartphone consumes more storage and battery with each update, our internal OS accumulates more information with each update.

Learning is also a form of updating.
As repetition, accumulation, and trial-and-error deepen understanding, the volume of information to be processed grows, and with it the system becomes heavier.

This “heaviness” is not deterioration; it means the identity OS remembers more, knows more cases, and contains more exception rules.

The problem is that when this complexity grows without a corresponding growth in conscious standards, abundance immediately turns into confusion.

If one does not understand this process, one becomes increasingly lost in the flood of information.

Unsorted emotions, unprocessed information, and memories constantly running in the background slow the OS down.

The problem is that society moves through additive updates, while we mistake them for organizational updates.

As a result, the thought “I updated, so things should be fine” ends up normalizing overload instead.

In reality, more information produces broader choices, higher uncertainty, and heavier judgment.

If one does not know what standards to use when choosing among expanded options, decision-making breaks down.

Decisions are delayed, responsibility becomes frightening, the OS becomes not lighter but heavier and slower, and we reach saturation faster.

What we call “identity confusion” is not primarily the abstract question “Who am I?”
It is the structural question, “By what standards should I operate this now-complex OS?”

Today’s confusion is not due to personal inadequacy but because the standards for handling the updated OS have not kept pace.

This is why the essential task is not adding more information but designing the standards for what to keep and what to discard.

This redesigning of standards is what it means to update identity.

And this process never ends.

In short, the identity update described in this essay is not “adding knowledge” but “re-designing selection standards.”

The most substantive transformation of identity lies in deciding what stays in the OS, what must be blocked, and what should no longer remain part of one’s worldview.

Where, then, do these standards come from?
Daily life offers simple clues.

Imagine that a messaging app update removes a function you use frequently.

You simply would not update, because the current version fits your purpose better.

Yet most people, unaware of where their assumptions originate, hit the update button believing vaguely that “updates = faster and better.”

They then struggle to find the function, realize it has vanished, and regret it.

This difference is structural thinking.

The ability to understand what is updated quickly, why something feels optimized, what possibilities open or close, and where that judgment originated.

If you do not recognize that the amount of information you must handle has increased, the structure of your choices will inevitably waver.

Structural thinking is not “because it looks good” or “because everyone else does it,”
but the ability to examine the direction of updates based on “my purpose, my resources, and the state of my OS.”

Without this ability, identity updates are pushed along by others' standards and the speed of the environment.

Turning the perspective inward, this becomes the process of inspecting one’s own OS.

What habits do I have?

Where did those habits begin?

What standards inform my current judgments, and from what experiences did they arise?

Why did I make this choice?

Why did I react this way?

Why did I feel optimized at that moment, and what was the origin of that feeling?

Which possibilities were opening, and which were closing?

Did my judgment originate from facts, or from familiarity and fear?

How much information am I handling at this moment, and was my OS prepared for that volume?

These questions reveal where my system began and the standards on which it now operates.

And these questions naturally dismantle the sentence “this is just who I am.”

Following the answers, one discovers that what one believed to be “innate” was simply an OS version formed within a certain time, environment, and set of relationships.

Identity begins to move only when one recognizes that the version is not absolute and can be re-edited, reduced, or redesigned when necessary.

Even a simple daily action like “drinking coffee” changes completely depending on perspective.

Some drink it because others do, some out of habit, some to feel “awake.”

But someone else notices not the feeling but the sensation of awakening.

This difference matters.
The moment one captures the sensation, coffee reveals a structure.

Within the structure of sensation, habits, moods, actions, and needs are interconnected.

Once this structure appears, coffee is reinterpreted as a condition for productivity, a shift in rhythm, or the starting point of focus.

And this meaning generates further perspectives.

Understanding the mechanism of “awakening” naturally extends that insight into other areas.

Let us shift the perspective back to myself.

Take the habit of biting fingernails.
What is its origin?

To relieve tension.

Why this action whenever tension arises?

Because the sensation disperses attention and induces immersion.

How was it learned?

By unconsciously copying a friend—curiosity turning into imitation, and imitation into habit.

But what matters is not merely explaining the phenomenon,
but recognizing the deeper structure: “I have a strong instinct for imitation.”

Why?

Because humans are born to learn through imitation.

With that recognition, one stops blaming oneself and instead understands one’s system.

Understanding reveals choices, and choices enable action.

As perspective expands, one realizes that habits cover a wide domain,
and this leads to reevaluating decisions and behaviors more generally.

This understanding eventually extends to collective customs as well.

Even the smallest daily experience faithfully reveals how the OS operates.

Identity expands not by stacking apps, but by recognizing how one’s OS functions.

I now have $70 in my bank, but I put it into my savings immediately. 

If I bought beer with it, it'll be gone within the next few days and I really don't want to have to waste $9 everyday on four tall cans of 6% (6.4 beers). 

That's almost $300 a month or over a $3,000 a year a beer. 

I'm quitting EVERYTHING on December 18, but I have no idea how long the sobriety will last. It's also not luck at all, I had control over every relapse for weed but felt satisfied with the time I did off. 

I'll just stick to my morning coffee, and I'll only have coffee some mornings, most mornings I'll just drink beer but that has to change. Now it should be orange juice or simple tap water.
