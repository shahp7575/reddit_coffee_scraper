1nga62o,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nga62o,"Claude can now build investment-grade Excel models in minutes.  It can generate budgets, financial analysis & planning, forecasting, cash flows, and conduct scenario analysis. We put it to the test.   Here is a prompt template you can use and example of what it can produce.","# TLDR Summary:

CFO-level financial modeling just became accessible to everyone. I discovered Claude can build complete Excel financial models in minutes instead of days. Tested it with a 24-month SaaS forecast: got 7 tabs, 1,176 formulas, dynamic charts, and scenario analysis. No coding needed, just one detailed prompt. This makes financial planning and analysis for startups, and small businesses so much easier

# I gave Claude one prompt. It built a 24-month financial forecast with 1,176 formulas. Here's exactly how you can do it (with the prompt)

**The old way was broken.**

Last month, my startup needed a financial model. Quote from a consultant: $5,000. Timeline: 3 weeks. I just couldn't afford it.

Yesterday, I built them the same model with Claude in 5 minutes.

Not a template. Not a simple budget. A real, working Excel model with 1,176 formulas, scenario analysis, cohort tracking, and funding triggers.

**Here's what just became obsolete:**

* Hiring consultants for basic financial models ($5k-20k)
* Waiting weeks for analyst deliverables
* Paying for expensive FP&A software
* Being locked out of professional financial planning because you can't afford it

# The Proof: What Claude Actually Built

I tested Claude with a complex request: ""Build a 24-month SaaS financial forecast with full unit economics.""

**What I got back:**

✅ **7 comprehensive tabs:**

* Executive dashboard with live KPIs
* Revenue build with cohort analysis
* OpEx planning with headcount modeling
* Cash flow with automatic funding triggers
* Unit economics (LTV, CAC, payback period)
* Scenario analysis (Base/Bear/Bull cases)
* Monthly cohort retention tracking

✅ **Professional-grade features:**

* 1,176 interconnected formulas (zero errors)
* Yellow-highlighted input cells (change any assumption, entire model updates)
* Conditional formatting (red alerts when cash < 6 months)
* Industry-standard metrics (Rule of 40, Magic Number, Quick Ratio)
* Dynamic charts that update in real-time

✅ **Actually works:**

* Downloaded straight to Excel
* All formulas traceable and auditable
* Good enough to be used for board reporting with minor edits

# The Prompt Framework

Here's the exact structure that works every time:

    1. CONTEXT SETUP
    ""Build a [timeframe] financial model for [company type]""
    Include: Current metrics, cash position, business model
    
    2. INPUT DRIVERS (The Magic)
    List 5-10 key assumptions you want to adjust:
    - Customer acquisition rate
    - Churn rate
    - Pricing changes
    - Headcount growth
    - Marketing spend %
    
    3. OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
    Specify exact tabs and sections needed
    (Revenue, Expenses, Cash Flow, Metrics)
    
    4. SPECIAL FEATURES
    - Scenario analysis
    - Sensitivity tables
    - Conditional formatting rules
    - Chart requirements
    
    5. THE POWER MOVE
    ""Highlight all input cells in yellow""
    ""Make all formulas traceable""
    ""Include error checking""

# Pro Tips That Took Me 50+ Hours to Learn

**The 80/20 Rule of Claude Excel:**

* 80% of the value comes from being specific about your INPUT DRIVERS
* List them explicitly and Claude will make them adjustable
* Always say ""highlight input cells in yellow""

**The Formula Secret:**

* Say ""traceable formulas"" not just ""formulas""
* Request ""error checking for impossible values""
* Ask for ""named ranges for key metrics"" (makes formulas readable)

 **The Iteration Hack:**

* First prompt: Get the structure right
* Second prompt: ""Add charts for \[specific metrics\]""
* Third prompt: ""Add sensitivity analysis for \[key driver\]""
* Each iteration takes 30 seconds vs rebuilding from scratch

**The Validation Technique:**

* Always request ""data validation for input cells""
* Specify ranges (e.g., ""churn rate between 0-100%"")
* This prevents model-breaking inputs

 **The Professional Touch:**

* Request ""conditional formatting for warning thresholds""
* Ask for ""version control section""
* Include ""assumptions documentation tab""

# Real-World Applications I've Tested

**Startup Financial Model** (saved $5,000)

* 24-month forecast
* Fundraising scenarios
* Burn rate analysis
* Time: 5 minutes

**E-commerce P&L** (saved $5,000)

* Product-line profitability
* Inventory planning
* Break-even analysis
* Time: 3 minutes

**Real Estate Investment Model** (saved $8,000)

* Sensitivity analysis
* IRR calculations
* Time: 4 minutes

**Marketing Budget Planner** (saved $3,000)

* ROI tracking
* Scenario planning

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Being vague about inputs** Instead of: ""Include important metrics"" Say: ""Include these 5 adjustable drivers: \[list them\]""

❌ **Forgetting the basics** Always include: ""Create as downloadable Excel file with working formulas""

❌ **Not specifying formatting** Add: ""Use standard financial formatting (negatives in parentheses, percentages for rates)""

❌ **Overcomplicating the first attempt** Start simple, then iterate. Claude remembers context.

# The Mindset Shift

Stop thinking ""Can AI really do this?"" Start thinking ""What would I ask a senior analyst to build?""

Claude doesn't just fill in templates. It understands financial relationships:

* It knows churn affects revenue
* It knows hiring affects OpEx
* It knows funding affects cash runway
* It builds these relationships into formulas automatically

# What This Means for Different Roles

**For Founders:** You no longer need to hire a CFO or consultant for basic financial planning. Build your own models in minutes.

**For Analysts:** Stop building models from scratch. Use Claude for the foundation, then add your unique insights and industry expertise.

**For CFOs:** Your analysts can now deliver 10x more. Instead of building, they can focus on analysis and strategy.

**For Consultants:** The commodity work is gone. Focus on high-value strategy, not formula writing.

# The Complete Prompt Template

Here's my template. Copy, modify, deploy:

    Please build a [24-month] financial model in Excel for [company type].
    
    BASELINE INFORMATION:
    - Current customers: [X]
    - Average revenue per customer: $[X]
    - Current cash: $[X]
    - Gross margin: [X]%
    - Monthly OpEx: $[X]
    - Employees: [X]
    
    KEY INPUT DRIVERS (highlight in yellow):
    Revenue:
    - New customer acquisition: [formula/rule]
    - Churn rate: [X]% (adjustable)
    - Pricing: $[X] with [increase logic]
    - Expansion revenue: $[X]/customer
    
    Expenses:
    - Headcount growth: [rule]
    - Average salary: $[X]
    - Marketing spend: [X]% of revenue
    - Other OpEx growth: [X]% monthly
    
    REQUIRED OUTPUTS:
    Tab 1: Dashboard (KPIs, charts)
    Tab 2: Revenue Build
    Tab 3: Operating Expenses
    Tab 4: Cash Flow
    Tab 5: Unit Economics
    Tab 6: Scenario Analysis
    
    SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS:
    - All formulas traceable
    - Input cells in yellow
    - Conditional formatting for warnings
    - Charts for key metrics
    - Error checking
    - Download as working Excel file

# The Bottom Line

Financial modeling just became democratized. What cost $10,000 and took weeks now costs $100/month and takes minutes.

This isn't about replacing financial professionals. It's about making their tools accessible to everyone.

Every startup can now have professional financial planning. Every small business can run scenarios. Every side project can model unit economics.

The barriers just fell.

**Want to try this yourself?**

1. Copy the prompt template above
2. Modify for your business
3. Paste into Claude
4. Download your model
5. Iterate as needed

**Still skeptical?** Try this simple test: Ask Claude: ""Create a 12-month budget spreadsheet for a coffee shop with adjustable inputs for customer traffic, average ticket, and labor costs.""

Watch it build something your local consultant would charge $2,000 for.

Welcome to the new era of financial planning.

*For those asking, yes this works with Claude's Max tier at $100 a month for right now.*  

*Several people asked about limitations. Claude can't connect to live data sources or handle files over 10MB. For those needs, you still need traditional tools. But for 90% of financial modeling needs, this works.*

1nga2k6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nga2k6,aio? 34(m) called me (20m) a bad friend for not understanding his subtle clues,"bit of a long story but i'll try summarize.

both of us are in recovery just to add context. he's fresher than i am into na (that's the reason for the drink thing.) i'm also autistic and struggle with social cues, although ive gotten better in recent times.

a group of us go out for coffee every wednesday after a narcotics anonymous meeting, sometimes i catch a ride with him to the coffee shop and sometimes i don't. a few weeks ago he asked me if i wanted (keyword WANTED) to drive with him to the coffee shop and i declined, deciding to accompany my friend 20f because she was going to be driving alone in a bit of a dodgy area.

he then asked ""why do you hate me?"" in a kind of joking manner (he was laughing) and i said i didn't want to leave her to drive alone & that she lets me hop on aux. we had to drop someone off before heading through to the coffee shop and that's when the text conversation on the 23rd happened. there's a bar type area in the smoking section of the place we normally go to.

i responded without thinking and was a bit rude but then decided it would be better to talk another time about what he had said. he went on to pretend as if nothing had happened and everything was normal. he also then said to my friend (the 20f) that he has feelings for her — despite the fact that his sponsor and the program is super clear about people under a year staying out of relationships. and the age gap is weird. she's not into him.

i went to an event tonight and i just felt really awkward with him there so under advisement from my friends and my sponsor i spoke to him and outlined how i was feeling. that's how he responded.

the birthday thing is a shrek themed rave (he doesn't even like raves) that i've been planning for a year with my close friends for my 21st. 

am i overreacting by uninviting him & responding the way i did? i blocked him and plan on avoiding him indefinitely.

* AMCR is a global packaging giant quietly pivoting from commodity plastics to a healthcare and hygiene powerhouse through its all stock Berry Global merger
* At current multiples: forward p/e of \~10x vs peers of 12-15x, it's priced for its high degree of execution risks and maxed leveraged position. However with fcf doubling if management is able to deliver the guided merger synergies they should be able to pay down debt and rerate towards 12x delivering +20% in appreciative returns
* AMCR is a dividend aristocrat, currently delivering +5% yields
* AMCR just became the biggest player in the flexible plastics arena, possibly unlocking pricing power with suppliers (+7% global market share post berry)
* With a price target of $10-12 there is >25% upside if synergies hit with top tier execution

**Intro:**

If you are reading this, then you have probably been a consumer of AMCR's products. The company's primary offering is flexible plastics packaging, think coca-cola, nestle etc. In an era of supply chain fragility and sustainability scrutiny, its products arent optional. They are the unsung enablers for FMCG titans like Nestle and P&G to deliver goods reliable across continents. For society it's the linchpin in reducing food waste and ensuring medical safety (think sterile nonwovens in gowns and diapers,) but for investors, it's a test of whether scale can finally outrun the squeeze from powerful buyers and volatile inputs

**A Little Background:**

Amcor has been around for a very long time. Founded in Melbourne Australia in 1860, this company quickly became a stalwart as a paper mill company supplying newsprint to the local economy. By the mid-20th century, the company became in indispensable pillar to Australia. But as industries do, the paper industry became mature and plastic was quickly becoming the dominant player of society. What would become a tone setting play for AMCR in the years ahead, the company purchased Twinpak in 1989. This Canadian rigid container play juiced sales 32% and planted a North American flag without dra,w, paying back in under three years through steady cash flows. The stage had been set.

**Acquisition Batting Average:**

Amcor took the experience from the Twinpak Acquisition as a green light for its bolt on philosophy. Through the course of the next several decades the company would take many swings, some were home runs, some base hits, and some plainly struck out. In 2002 for instance, the company acquired Schmalbach-Lubeca for $1.5 billion, vaulting themselves into global dominance as a PET bottle distributer. However, due to overcapacity and supply costs, the synergies fizzled out and Europe got firesold just 5 years later at a loss.

In 2010 the company acquired Alcan Packaging's 1.95 billion flexibles at 5x EBITDA for food and pharma films; synergies hit $250 million ahead of schedule, spiking EBIT 55% and repositioning the company as a global flexibles leader. Bolt-ons like Ball Plastics and Sonoco's specialty containers filled rigid niches, doubling EBIT through procurement tweak's with a 3-5 year payback period.

**The Most Recent Acquisition; Berry Global in 2025:**

Berry Global is arguably the swing for the fences play for the company. They acquired the company for an all stock deal of $13.8b, while assuming the debt of >$7B. This levers the company to max capacity in the eyes of creditors at \~3.5x. The stakes could not be higher.

This acquisition gives the company a larger piece of the US market while adding denser high margin segments in healthcare and hygiene specialties. This segment alone brings stickier growth at 3-4% CAGR compared to other commodity segments of closer to 2-3%. Moreover, this gives the company procurement and supplier leverage. Resin/film is Amcor's single biggest input cost. By doubling volume, the company becomes one of the largest resin buyers globally. This gives the company more leverage at the negotiating table.

**Some Market Context:**

Amcor's customers are the giants of everyday life: multinational FMCG's like Nestle, P&G, and J&J who choose the company for its global reliability over cheaper locals in a fragmented industry. For a household, Amcor is invisible; It's the pouch keeping coffee fresh or the blister pack ensuring pills dont degrade.

As noted, the industry is heavily fragmented with Amcor holding the leading share: \~7% globally of a \~$340B TAM. Competitors of note are Mondi, Huhtamaki and Sealed Air. Competition boils down to scale for procurement wins, innovation in ESG-compliant materials, and service for just-in-time deliver. Amcor wins by bundling formats which no peer matches.

**Financial Drivers:**

* Sales growth splits inorganic (Berry's 60% leap) from organic (2-3%, volume-led in emerging markets, price/mix from premium nonwovens, low churn).
* Margins by segment:
   * Flexibles at 11-12%
   * Rigids 7-8%
   * Healthcare Nonwovens \~+19%
* Reinvestment runs 3-4% capex/sales for maintence
* FX/constant currenscy: 30% Asia-Pacific exposure mutes volatility, normalized growth 3-4% versus reported swings from AUD/USD

**Risks:**

This company is a binary play. Failure to execute cost synergies will force the company to reevaluate its dividends, and possible lead to a credit downgrade given the companies over-levered position. Not to mention the company is operating in a very tense economic envirnoment. The Berry acquisition amps U.S.-China tensions: 30% Asia-Pacific revenue exposes it to tariffs; Trump's proposed 10-20% blanket duties could hike resin costs 5-10%. Forex risks are also a cause for concern, with AUD/USD swings of 5-10% EBIT. Recession risks could squeeze FMCG volumes, though the company is arguably better positioned now through its enlarged healthcare packaging segment.

**Catalysts and Growth Opps:**

* Near-term: FY26 -> $260 million synergy milestone unlocks 12% EPS lift. Asset sales ($2.5B revenue), deleverage to 3.1x.
* Medium-Term (1-3 Years): $650m full synergies by FY28 compund FCF to $2.1B. Healthcare/nonwovens ramp 3-4% organic
* Long Term: Sustainability mandates favor AMCR's recyclable flexibles, global FMCG expansion in EM's adds 2-3% tailwind

**Valuation:**

I chose to value the company based off peer comps using EV/EBITDA as the best fit. This was chosen due to packagin's capex-light, FCF focus rewards efficiency over earnings noise. A bear case of 7x forward gives a downside pps of $7, 10x as the base leads to a pps of $9, and a 12x bull case gives us a pps of \~$11. A target of $10-11 implies a 20-30% upside from todays price.

**Positioning and Strategy:**

Management pitches Amcor as the ""global packaging leader,"" betting scale and sustainability turn commodity risks into moats. Berry's nonwovens embed it in healthcare's resilient road. Competitive edge: unmatched 7% share and resin leverage trumps Mondi's fiber margins or Huhtamaki's niche ROIC. It's a cheap compounder at heart with a 5% dividend yield and a 10% fcf yield with 3-5% FCF growth.

**Conclusion:**

Amcor's the aristocrat that's mastered turning plastics' grind into dividend gold, now wiring for healthcare's steady hum. Why now? Syndergies land FY26 amid tariff jitters that could pass through unevenly. Upside outweighs downside if execution holds giving early movers pivot access before the market catches up.

1nga02v,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/1nga02v/which_churches_are_closest_to_my_thinking/,Which churches are closest to my thinking?,"I was born in a Catholic country, but now live in a predominantly Protestant one in Northern Europe. I believe in God but have never been active in any specific church. I've developed some thoughts individually, and now that I'm reading the Bible on my own, I'm finding them confirmed. And reading it, I often ask myself: have priests, popes, pastors, and preachers read it? This somewhat provocative question, the arguments for which I'll shortly address, I fear, might not appeal to some here, is closely linked to the fact that I've never been particularly active in any church. Yes, because in most mainstream churches, it seems they cherry-pick verses out of context to assert that God is love, forgiveness, etc. And in fact, here I see churches justifying fornication, adultery, sodomy, etc. The biblical God is a stern father who punishes children who have violated his commandments. And the God of the Old and New Testaments is the same, while I hear some speak as if He had changed personality. Commandments against fornication, adultery, and so on are reiterated repeatedly. Jesus Christ forgave the adulteress so she could see the truth. But for those who sin willfully after knowing the truth, there is no forgiveness, but only the expectation of judgment. This is written very clearly.

Having said this, some things that are very close to my heart are the centrality of the family, which I see as an eternal, unbreakable alliance (I see marriage as my main goal and duty), total premarital chastity, rigid view of gender roles and, as I have tried to explain, the most faithful application of the Scriptures possible. 

I prefer a direct relationship with God, without intermediaries.

I place great value on self-employment/entrepreneurship. I would never work for the state or corporations I consider corrupt. I don't have a TV at home; I don't like the lifestyle promoted by the media.

I don't smoke, drink alcohol, or coffee, or eat processed foods, etc. I'm against tattoos, piercings, or revealing clothing. These aren't essential, but I'd appreciate a health and dress code.

1ng9zzw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ng9zzw,Grant Stone Brass Boots in Honey Glazed Shell Cordovan,"**Ordering**  
I purchased these in late May for $795 as a birthday/wedding present to myself. They arrived just a couple of days ago, which was actually a bit earlier than GS’s initial estimation, so that was a pleasant surprise. The whole ordering process was smooth and straightforward, with clear updates along the way. Packaging was solid as always, double-boxed, plenty of protection, and the usual GS cloth bags. It felt like I was opening something special.

**Out the Box Appearance**  
This is my very first pair of shell cordovan, and I’ll admit I wasn’t fully prepared for just how striking it would look in person. The Honey Glazed shade is far more varied and contrasted than I expected. Even unworn, the highs and lows in the leather are already dramatic- bright golden peaks set against darker, warmer valleys. The creamy caramel tone is something I’ve never quite seen before, and the way it shifts under different light is mesmerizing. Though it is difficult to compare shell to the rest of my collection, closest is likely  my AE Coffee Oxfords in calfskin. This shell feels like it has an entirely different personality. The color is more alive, more complex, and definitely more eye-catching.

Grant Stone is known for their superb finishing, and this pair carries on that reputation. My amateur eye doesn’t detect any manufacturing flaws whatsoever. Stitching is tight and consistent, I can’t even tell where the welt starts and ends, and the factory polish has a depth and clarity that met my expectations.

**Fit and Feel**  
I’ve tried plenty of boots, including several other GS lasts, and Brass continues to be the only one that works comfortably for my high-volume, very high-instep feet. This pair is an 8.5 EEE, identical to my Brass boots in C.F. Stead’s Waxy Commander, and the sizing feels right at home. Naturally, the shell is quite a bit stiffer straight out of the box, but that’s to be expected. After a couple of walks around town, maybe 2–3 miles total, the leather hasn’t really started to soften yet, but I don’t mind. They’re completely tolerable already, and I know shell rewards patience with a long, graceful break-in that pays dividends down the line.

**Quirks**  
A small oddity: both of my other GS boots came with one pair of cotton laces and one pair of leather laces. This pair, however, shipped with two sets of cotton and no leather at all. I reached out via email to ask if it was an oversight, though I haven’t heard back yet. Thankfully, I had a set of leather laces on hand, and the difference is huge. The darker leather laces bring out the richness of the shell far better than the included cotton.

Another strange thing- the welt on this pair is like twice the width of my other Brass pair. Not sure what implication that has and I wouldn't call it a pro or a con. Does make the boots look a bit bulkier comparatively.

**Overall**  
All things considered, I’m thrilled with these boots. I’m genuinely excited to put serious miles on them, watch them develop character, and document the patina over time. This feels like the kind of boot that only gets better with age, and I fully intend to wear the hell out of them. Planning on posting patina updates in the coming months :)",2,1757800812.0,goodyearwelt,0,1.0,False

I’ve tried some beans from 49th Parallels that had these distinct licorice notes.

This got me wondering - how the hell do they achieve these specific flavor profiles? 

I feel like they’re infusing beans with a bit of licorice flavour. 

Anyone here have experience pulling these kinds of flavors or know what techniques are involved? 

I’m roasting with a Hottop 2K+ if that matter.

The sludge in my ceramic mug was a particularly potent vintage this morning, but it's free, so I drink it anyway.  
""Leo! Over here! You're on the Deliverance Day committee.""  
Anya's voice cut through the caffeine-deficient haze. I blinked. She was waving me into the main boardroom where a small, grim-looking group had assembled. I was the new guy on the forty-seventh floor of Kensey-Pryce Tower. My most significant achievement so far was finding the least malfunctioning elevator. Apparently I was already qualified to plan the office party for the day the world didn't end. Moving up fast.  
""The… what committee?"" I asked, sliding into a chair beside her. She nudged a plate of suspiciously uniform croissants toward me.  
""Deliverance Day,"" she said, as if it were obvious. ""You know. The day the world didn't end. Only the most important holiday on the planet. Bigger than New Year's. Way bigger than Christmas. The sixtieth anniversary is this year. Corporate is a Platinum Sponsor. It's a huge deal.""  
Right. Deliverance Day. The day the Three—Atlas, Null, and Meridian—finally put down the Devourer after decades of global carnage. The day we stopped being an all-you-can-eat buffet for a reality-bending horror that had spilled out of the Rift. And my job was to help plan the office party for it.  
""Our theme,"" announced Sterling, our department head, ""is ‘Unity Through Adversity.'""  
I nodded like this made perfect sense. ""Should the napkins reflect the unity or the adversity?""  
""Custom ombré. Charcoal transitioning to cerulean. Focus-grouped.""  
Of course they were.  
""I still think a moment of silence for the millions who died would be more appropriate than a karaoke contest,"" murmured Anya.  
""The karaoke contest,"" Sterling countered, without missing a beat, ""promotes brand engagement and inter-departmental cohesion. The silent reflection pod will be available in the wellness room for a scheduled thirty-minute window. Now, Leo, you'll be liaising with catering on canapés that are both celebratory and respectfully solemn.""  
I nodded again, my mind already composing the email. Subject: Somber Mini-Quiches.  
I tuned out and looked around the boardroom. A long, polished obsidian table reflected the recessed lighting. The far wall was a single, sweeping pane of reinforced glass, offering a dizzying view of a city of shimmering holographic ads and skyscrapers.  
The only real reminders of the world we lived in now were the subtle safety features. A thin, phosphorescent yellow line on the floor marked the path to the emergency stairwell. A small plaque by the door glowed amber: *AMBER ZONE GRID: ACTIVE*. You saw them everywhere, like fire extinguishers. You ignored them until the moment you couldn't.  
Sterling was still droning on when a low hum started. It was a vibration that came up through the soles of my shoes. I glanced at my mug. The dark surface of the coffee trembled, forming perfect concentric rings.  
Anya noticed it too. Her easygoing demeanor tightened. ""Ground-shaker?"" she whispered.  
Sterling paused, annoyed by the interruption. ""Maintenance is probably—""  
He never finished the sentence.  
**CRACK**  
It felt like the building's spine had snapped. The magnificent pane of glass shattered, exploding inward in a crystalline shockwave.  
Through the brand-new hole in our forty-seventh-floor office, a thing of jagged nightmares pulled itself in.  
It was a mass of iridescent chitin and twitching, mismatched limbs. One arm was a bludgeoning club of bone, the other a pincer that snapped with unnerving speed. A thick, viscous ichor, the color of crude oil, dripped from its maw onto the plush carpet, sizzling on contact.  
An Aberrant. A leftover scrap of the Devourer's reign. A walking reminder of why we had Deliverance Day committees in the first place.  
Panic was a hot flood. Sterling was screaming. Then, from another wall, a second, controlled explosion blew a man-sized hole in the drywall.  
A figure landed in a perfect three-point stance, clad in graphite-gray tactical armor. ""Civilians, remain calm!"" his voice boomed. ""Aegis is on site!""  
The name registered. Aegis. One of the city's top-tier, government-sanctioned mutants—the kind of hero they put on posters for the Deliverance Day galas. He was the real deal. He fired searing bolts of blue light from his gauntlets, slamming into the Aberrant's carapace. The monster shrieked, a sound like tearing metal, and lunged.  
Aegis flexed. ""Have at thee!""  
What followed was brutal and fast. But the creature was unnaturally strong. It swung its club-like arm, and Aegis had to catch the blow, his boots skidding back, gouging furrows in the floor.  
""Fuck!"" Aegis grunted, the polished, PR-friendly voice gone, replaced by the raw strain of a man in a real fight. ""Alright then, you piece of shit…""  
The Aberrant pressed its advantage, slamming him again and again, forcing him back toward the interior glass wall that separated the boardroom from the main office floor. My corner. I was frozen, trapped behind Anya, who was trying to pull me under the table.  
Just as it seemed Aegis would be pulped against the glass, they arrived.  
There was no explosion, no grand entrance. They moved through the dust and chaos from the main office space in silence, their movements economical and unnervingly calm. There were five of them, dressed in simple, dark-gray fatigues with no logos, no armor—just utility vests packed with gear.  
The man in the lead was of average height but had broad, powerful shoulders and arms that strained the fabric of his shirt. He had a handsome, rugged face framed by messy dark hair, but his eyes were ancient with exhaustion. Behind him, a tall, pale woman with striking features moved with a liquid grace, her hand raised slightly as if feeling the air. She whispered something, and the frantic scramble of our colleagues near the door seemed to quiet, to organize itself into a more orderly retreat.  
Anya let out a shaky breath next to me. ""Thank God. It's *Corridor Risk Solutions*."" She pointed a trembling finger at the man. ""That's Chub's team.""  
Chub?  
The Aberrant, ignoring them completely, let out another shriek and, with a final, heaving shove, hurled Aegis's armored body directly at the glass panel I was crouched behind.  
This is it, I thought, my life flashing before my eyes in a slideshow of unfiled tax forms.  
I am so, so quitting after today.  
But one of the newcomers, a stocky man with a thick red beard, was already there. He didn't brace for impact. He didn't even look strained. He simply stepped forward and placed the palm of his hand flat against the center of the glass panel.  
The glass shimmered, turning opaque—becoming something else entirely.  
Aegis's two hundred fifty pounds of man and metal hit the pane with a sound I will never forget. It wasn't the sharp crack of breaking glass. It was a deep, dull, leaden **THUMP**, like a side of beef hitting a concrete floor. It held.  
Aegis's armored form, all momentum spent, slid down the surface with a greasy squeal, leaving a smear on the perfectly intact pane.  
The Aberrant paused, its cluster of eyes blinking in what looked like genuine confusion. It had expected a bloody mess, not a physics-defying thud. The momentary hesitation was all Aegis needed. Roaring with frustration, he launched himself off the wall and tackled the creature, driving it back through the hole it had made. The sounds of their battle receded down the side of the building.  
The CRS team didn't follow. Their job, apparently, wasn't the monster. It was us. The tall, thin one with kind eyes was already directing people out. A petite woman—so delicate she looked like she might break—knelt beside Sterling, checking him for injuries with a practiced calm. The red-bearded man took his hand off the glass, which now looked like a normal pane again. He flexed his fingers, wincing slightly.  
The leader, the one with the tired eyes, surveyed the room. His gaze swept over the damage, the terrified accountants, and finally landed on me, still huddled on the floor. He walked over, his boots crunching softly on the crystalline dust. Up close, I could see the uneven tone of his skin—pale in some places and darker in others, like old bruises that never quite faded.  
""You alright, kid?"" he asked, his voice a low baritone, rough around the edges.  
I could only nod, my throat tight. ""Who… who are you guys?""  
""CRS."" He offered a half-smile that didn't quite reach his weary eyes. He glanced at the Kensey-Pryce logo on the wall, then back at me.  
""If your coverage is good, you folks won't even see the bill,"" he added, a glint of dark humor in his expression. ""If not… well, we'll itemize.""",1,1757800260.0,writers,1,1.0,False

I wasn't able to go to college at 18 due to the aftermath of abuse and some convoluted circumstances, and now I'm slowly pursuing a career in healthcare.

There have been times at different jobs where I felt like a good, reliable worker, and I knew I was in turn seen that way. However, I'm realizing now that was either during times where I was at a peak mental health wise, and/or I worked with empathetic people also on the spectrum (a few of who became close friends while we were working). 

I attributed my struggles at work- whether it be actual mistakes or just my extreme exhaustion afterwards- to be the result of especially bad mental health/life circumstances, and/or disorganized workplaces where my coworkers also struggled. Stuff that would be typical no matter the kind of work. However, I'm wondering if I in particular am especially unequipped for kitchen work due to my autism. This is not the first time, but I've dismissed it bc it's not like I'm staying in this kind of work for long (even if it's already been way longer than I planned). 

What really throws me off is that a lot of neurodivergent people work in kitchens (it's sort of an inside joke). So I thought I should be fine, I could just learn to work like them. Their advice, while tremendous at times, isn't enough for me to not feel completely flabbergasted in some workplaces. While one coworker at my current place (someone who seems really allistic lol) has commiserated with me about how unclear our boss's directions can be, and she also gets frustrated, she's able to adapt and go to the flow. But I get SO thrown off by certain vague instructions, or task switching. 

On bad days, I feel so disconnected from my body. And certain manual skills that I've demonstrated before for years get rusty when I have a brief break from them. I have great knife skills (esp to home cook normies lol), I can tamp coffee and work with dough and pipe icing and ex, I've trained people on all these- but if there's been like, a week or so between tasks, I need a minute or two of fucking sucking at it before it clicks again. But even if I do x immaculately afterwards, someone else sees how pathetically I do something as simple as wrap a tortilla, and they're like wtf have you never done this before? 

Anyway...I wonder how much of this is due to conditions I want to ""conquer"" (that I've been in treatment for, and am on the cusp of being cleared of), vs how much of it is my autism- something I want to embrace and work with. I'm afraid I keep telling myself that it's not just me, it's my environment- only to discover that I suck at whatever chosen field I enter, no matter how different. It feels like something I need to suck up at, regardless, because I need a way to support myself while I'm studying.

  
If anyone could share their perspective and experiences, I'd really appreciate it. Thank you for reading.

I was broke, desperate, and sick of rejection emails. One night, I just snapped and wrote my CV like I was creating a fanfic character. I added skills I didn't have, projects I never worked on, and even made up a fancy-sounding consulting gig that was really just me helping my cousin with his website once.

I applied to a bunch of jobs. I got a few interviews. I learned some buzzwords, watched a ton of YouTube tutorials, and prayed no one would dig too deep. Then, one company hired me. Remote work, good salary, and full benefits. I swear I almost fainted.

The first month was hell. The imposter syndrome was crushing me; I was googling everything, and I would jump every time someone messaged me on Slack. But I kept going. And I kept learning. I faked the confidence until it wasn't fake anymore.

About six months later, now... I'm actually good at this? Like, people come to me with questions. I'm hitting my KPIs. I trained the new intern last week. My manager called me a ""core team member,"" and I nearly choked on my coffee.

I still feel weird about how I started. But at the same time, if I hadn't lied, I never would have gotten this chance in the first place. And now, I'm not lying anymore. I actually became that person. I just took a weird path to get here.

*1 year later…*

Olyrean awoke to the sound of her favorite patriotic hymn being piped in through the speakers.

She opened her eyes to a mind-blowing expanse of stars, the utter wholeness of being stretching on through infinity, void black shot through with detritus of creation. It was a sight she never tired of. She rose and walked to the window, drinking in the view, feeling her heart swell with the glory of all that was, would be and would ever be. Then a red spaceship, boxlike and immense, drifted across her vision and blotted out the sky.

She stood in her bedroom on the grand space station of Moody Blue, a breathtakingly vast megastructure of red, white and blue chrome the size of an entire continent that had taken the strip-mining of several planets to construct. It also, if you backed away from it a little bit and squinted, looked a little bit like a suffocating walrus with a terrible stomach wound. Millions upon millions of people lived their entire lives on Moody Blue, completely ignorant to this fact, but it was the cause of quite a lot of backhanded giggling amongs regular space travelers.

The spaceship that was passing by and blocking her favorite view was so close that she could see the person, or rather, the creature, who piloted it. It was a translucent blob of countless jellied tentacles. A great yellow eye burbled up from the murky depths and peered at her. The creature waved. Tentatively, Olyrean waved back. At least she did until she remembered she had just woken up and was still naked.

This shouldn’t have mattered, because the driver of the cargo ship was a Buuglubian, a species that not only did not have any appreciation for naked Sun-Elves but in fact lacked the capacity to wear clothing themselves and, as it happened, had no concept of sexuality, reproducing as they did through spontaneous generation in abandoned jello molds, but some habits died hard. She shouted and yanked the curtains closed. As she did, she caught the words written on the side of the ship in broad, looping Americanese: OMEGA-COLA! THE QUEST FOR COLA-PRIME CONTINUES.

“Damned truckers,” Olyrean grumbled. They really shouldn’t be flying so close to the space station. But then she immediately felt guilty. The Cola corporation had a religious exemption to shipping regulations. She bowed her head and offered a prayer that they might find Cola-Prime soon.

\*\*\*

The quest for Cola-Prime in many ways mirrors the historical arc of Infinity America, in that the histories of both the Interdimensional Cola Corporation and the UWA are half-lost and forgotten, and the parts which are remembered don’t actually make much sense.

That hasn’t stopped scholars from doing their best to reconstruct the lost history through the fine academic practice of Nonlinear Chrono-Interpretation (i.e. taking all the scraps you have and making up the rest to fill in the gaps). The leading scholars, upon reading their own work, all agreed that it was very rigorous and that they had done a very fine job and all the grants they’d been given for it were fully justified, and being the experts in the field most people shrugged and took their word for it.

The reconstructed history goes like this:

Once upon a time, very long ago and in a galaxy far, far away, there was a planet called America. The denizens of this planet had developed the most perfect and complete creed that there ever was in the entirety of the universe. The creed was so perfect, in fact, that it was impossible to write down entirely–language could not fully capture it.

But it had something to do with ultimate personal freedom, a rejection of the baggage of history, the severing of all claims your race might hold on you; to pursue your own happiness and reject all those who might trammel it. It was the highest and most ultimate abstract ideal of liberty, where all authority was bound by law, bold eyes looked out toward the universe with the unceasing desire to know it and know it completely, and all had the right to question everything. It also guaranteed the right to own no fewer than seventeen fully automatic rifles per citizen. Many were very, very certain about this specific point.

They were also quite certain that this creed should apply to all manner of sentient life, without exception.

This last belief took on a bit of troubling relevance for the rest of space-time when America also developed some infernally smart artificial intelligences, star drives that approached the speed of light, and the ability to manipulate probability so they could punch sideways into theoretical universes. They sent probes out across the infinite expanse of creation, through space and time and probability, and saw endless worlds, endless realities suffocating beneath tyranny, benighted and crying out for freedom.

They also saw that they had bigger guns than everyone.

So was Infinity America born, and has since been expanding throughout all of reality at speeds first matching, then exceeding that of light, which was particularly impressive considering that they stopped to make sure they built a burger joint everywhere they went. Infinity America held that all directions, all realities, all space, all time should share their creed, and they had done a pretty good job executing on this idea.

So far had they come from their home that nobody was quite sure where the original planet America was anymore, and so many were the species that now followed the creed that, embarrassingly, no one could quite remember which one had originally come up with it. This was confounded by the fact that every species wanted the credit and so reams and reams of imaginary history were published every nanosecond in order to lay claim to the origin. There were ten billion books about how the original planet America had been populated by fungoids, bovines, lizard-men, sentient shades of blue, etc.

It was part of the reason why the history was such a pain to sort through. Some said that the historians and scholars made a hefty sum inventing some of this nonsense history that they could then go on to “clarify” for everyone, but they were generally ignored as being tattletales.

Where does the Interdimensional Cola Corporation come into play with all this? Thanks to some meticulous corporate record-keeping, it was generally agreed that they were one of the few organizations that actually could lay claim to having originated from the original planet America.

A few others holding this weighty honor were the Union of Elevator Repairmen, a holy order dedicated to the mission of stopping elevators from being repaired; a brotherhood of monks which spent their time producing some ancient form of media called ‘*The Simp-sons’* in a data format no one knew how to read anymore; and Tony’s Pizzeria, the best place to take your kids for a little cheese and pepperoni pizza after their hockey match (hockey being, from the historians’ best guesses, a form of bloody ritualized combat).

Interdimensional Cola, as far as anyone could tell, was a religion that centered around the imbibing of the Sacred Cola, a holy liquid which, in keeping with the ethos of the Americans, was available to anyone in return for a prayer and a quick swipe of the credit card at the nearest vending machine.

However, it was also determined that the formula of the Sacred Cola had been tampered with dramatically over the course of Infinity America’s history. As the Americans had spread and brought freedom to new worlds, they had encountered a variety of spices and flavors and customers that they had never dreamed of. The Sacred Cola had been modified for consumption by all sorts of sentients with every imaginable biology and taste palate. No fewer than ten billion different varieties of cola existed, among them:

…The ancient and venerable lemon-lime cola,

…The classic Trimixxian blood cola (made from the blood of real, fresh-squeezed Trimixxians!),

…The new and exotic Hypothetical cola, which was not so much a liquid as it was a point in probability space that described the most refreshing drink that you personally could ever experience (if only you could figure out a way to sample it).

Alas, with all these modifications, the recipe for the original cola was lost along with the original history of Infinity America. And so it was a sacred quest for Interdimensional Cola Corporation to find their roots, the Cola Prime, and there were many who hoped that other bits of Infinity America’s history would be found along with the recipe. Due to this historical and religious importance, truckers for Interdimensional Cola enjoyed immunity from all sorts of local laws, including regulations about shipping lane proximity to space stations. And perhaps most importantly, at least from the point of view of Interdimensional Cola’s accountants, they were tax-exempt.

\*\*\*

“Olly!” a voice called out, interrupting Olyrean’s prayer.

There was a flicker and a hum, and then a very pretty woman wearing a frilly star-spangled dress appeared in the middle of her bedroom. Everything about her was red, white and blue. Even her hair and fingernails, both of which were speckled with tiny winking stars. She was so intensely patriotic, in fact, that she seemed to glow slightly, and the room was a little bit brighter in her presence.

“Hello, Libby,” Olyrean said, squinting a bit.

“You can’t dawdle, not today!” Libby cried out cheerfully. “You’ve got your *placement exam,* remember? You need to get dressed!” She pouted and fussed with the frills of her dress, which was entirely unnecessary because they weren’t actually real. Libby was an artificial intelligence.

Olyrean had been terrified of them when she first came to the UWA.

She had been swept out of her world of magic and dragons and into one that, well, also had magic and dragons, but in addition it had robots, a startling array of aliens, credit cards, democracy, fashion cycles, ultra-cowboys and a thousand friendly strangers offering her a cheeseburger. It had all been so overwhelming, and for quite some time she had flipped between thinking that she had gone insane, or that she had died and gone to some bizarre version of the afterlife.

The artificial intelligences had not helped with this impression–insubstantial spirits, they appeared to her, who could appear anywhere but had no physicality to them. Libby’s appearance on the battlefield the day she was liberated was tame compared to what the AIs got up to in the civilian world. She remembered the first AI she had ever seen, a statuesque man of handsome grandeur, glisteningly shirtless and with a mane of golden hair that blew magnificently in an unfelt wind. She had regarded him with a combination of sacred awe and want until he knelt down, looked her straight in the eyes, and asked her if she was happy with her car insurance.

It was too much. Olyrean had been deliriously happy that she had been plucked from the jaws of slavery and death, but Infinity America had been so overwhelming that at many points she had simply locked herself in her room and bawled. It was not until she had undergone her civics training that it had all begun to make some sort of sense. It was there, in those classes full of countless aliens from dozens of recently liberated worlds, that she had met Libby again.

It was the first time she had actually talked and gotten along with an AI. It was simultaneously surprisingly normal and very strange, to be friends with a disembodied spirit of pure computation, which was American magic. Libby had tried to gently explain that this wasn’t magic, but then she had started talking about tiny lightning shooting through patterns etched in special metal, and Olyrean knew magic when she heard it.

“You know,” she told the star-spangled AI as she pulled on her clothes–a very tasteful and subdued outfit with just two flags on the cufflinks and one on the lapel of her jacket, and a pencil skirt with swirling red and white stripes–”You could have told me that the cargo ship was approaching.”

“Well, maybe flashing the driver was something you wanted to do. How was I supposed to know? I mean, don’t you still do your whole naked dancing thing?” Libby gave a start. “Not that there’s anything wrong with that, of course. You can do whatever you want! That’s what America is all about.”

“It’s called *frolicking.*” Olyrean frowned as she buttoned up her shirt. “And it’s…I don’t…it’s not, uh, what do you people call it?” She blushed, a little ashamed at not knowing the word. Americanese still did not come completely naturally to her.

“Exhibitionism?”

“Right. Well, whatever you call it. It’s *not* that.”

“Oh, of course,” said Libby, “it’s very different.” She sounded very respectful, but a small smile tugged at the corner of her red-and-blue lips. Olyrean considered the AI her friend, but sometimes she got the impression that it was secretly laughing at her.

Libby shimmered and faded and reformed herself atop the counter, kicking her legs, as Olyrean moved from the bedroom to her kitchen, and Olyrean almost stumbled avoiding her. It was difficult, at times, to remember that she did not actually have any physical presence. Olyrean could walk right through her, if she wanted, but AIs in general considered it extremely rude when people did not play along as if they were actually solid.

“I already told Baxter to brew your coffee extra strong this morning,” Libby whispered conspiratorially. “I figured you could use some extra pep.”

“Indeed she has, miss.” Another figure stepped out of the shadows, a stiff-backed but very handsome sun-elf in a trim, slick tuxedo. Baxter, her domestic robot. The only sign that he was mechanical, or so Olyrean thought, was that he moved with a grace just a bit *too* smooth. Also his joints whirred a bit.

Baxter glanced toward Libby and gave a weary sigh. “Of course,” he said with a slightly wounded air, “I am perfectly calibrated to your needs, and I had already decided that you might like an extra dose of caffeine.”

“Thank you, Baxter,” Olyrean said.

“In fact, I have predicted your particular coffee intake needs for the next three centuries, and so far not once has my model been inaccurate.” The robot’s tone was so sharp that it could have made atomic-edge razor blades hang their heads in shameful inadequacy. “But oh, I suppose the reminder was…*extremely helpful.”* Libby coughed and suddenly seemed very interested in examining the marbling of the countertop.

“*Thank you,* Baxter,” Olyrean repeated firmly. He’d go on all day like this if she let him. “Could I have my breakfast now?”

The robot’s eyebrows shot up so high she thought they might float off and get stuck on the ceiling. “Of course, mistress.”

When Olyrean had first bought Baxter, he’d been nothing but a silver skeleton. The shop had upsold her on a synthetic shell to make him appear more biological. She had still been a little sour at orcs over the whole ‘killing your family and enslaving your entire race’ fiasco at the time, so she had paid for him to look like an orc, so that she might get a sense of satisfaction out of ordering one around. The thrill had quickly run thin, however, and not least because Baxter responded to her threats only by sulking. As her civics lessons had continued, she learned this sort of thing was considered very un-American, so after a time she had bashfully told Baxter he could choose his own appearance if he wanted.

She hadn’t been expecting him to choose to present as a sun-elf so handsome that she had to make an effort not to stare, though. When questioned, he told her that it was his job to make Olyrean comfortable and he had chosen a form that, by his calculations, would most efficiently stimulate the pleasure center of her brain. When Olyrean had babbled that this was *definitely* not necessary and perhaps he should choose a different form, he had only raised his eyebrow and said, “Oh, so I *can’t* decide for myself?” So now she lived in perpetual fear of what the neighbors thought she was getting up to with her robot, and perpetual denial about how much interest she had in said getting up to.

With a theatrical sigh, Baxter handed her a plate of eggs and toast and some coffee. Olyrean sipped from her mug and tried very hard not to stare at the robot’s rolling hips as he walked off. “What are you smirking at?” she snapped at Libby.

“Nothing!” Libby leaped down from the countertop. “So how are you feeling about the exam? Do you think you’ve studied enough?”

Olyrean grimaced and gulped down a mouthful of coffee. “Oh, I don’t even want to think about it,” she muttered.

The placement exam. She had spent the last year of her life training and studying for it. It was to determine her aptitude for SPECTRA, the intelligence agency of Infinity America. Well, one of them; there seemed to be dozens, with a dizzying array of acronyms cropping up in the news. She thought SPECTRA seemed sufficiently competent, though. Nobody even knew what the acronym stood for. Clearly they were good at keeping secrets.

She had spent weeks having Libby quiz her in preparation, though the last set of practice questions had been awfully strange…

Q1: Which of the following is the most stable form of government?

1. A) Representative Democracy.
2. B) Representative Burgerocracy.
3. C) Burgerative Representocracy.
4. D) Demotive Repreburgocracy. \[WARNING: IF YOU ARE IN A UNIVERSE WHERE THIS IS ACTUALLY THE FORM OF GOVERNMENT PLEASE EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY\]

 

Q2: Which of the following colors is most classified? (If color as a concept does not exist, please ignore this question).

1. A) Liberty Blue.
2. B) Forbidden Yellow.
3. C) \[REDACTED\]
4. D) Reen.

 

Q3: D.

1. A) C.
2. B) B.
3. C) Q2.
4. D) :O! The question noticed me!

Then there were the free-response questions. “Prove you exist in 250 words or less.” “If you are reading this question, you have already answered it. Explain why.” Olyrean didn’t even really understand her own answers, but Libby had told her she had done great. It didn’t stop her from being nervous, though.

Rather than fretting about it, she took her breakfast to the couch and turned on the Holographic Sensation Projector and immediately her living room exploded.

She was suddenly floating through the air, above the surface of a greenish, murky-looking planet, dense with foggy vegetation as far as the eye could see, except for where there was a large lake of fire burning, eating away at the vegetation and turning the fog to tatters. Swarms of aliens that looked like little unbearably cute pink fluffballs with one large wet eye and no limbs to speak of rolled away from the flames, singed and weeping enormous tears.

“Tragedy strikes Pfflgarr Five today,” a very somber voice intoned, “countless Pfflgarrians lost in horrific firestorms after the crash of a cargo ship carrying ‘Ol’ Xubriq’s Classic Texan Hot Sauce’, classified as a class-5 bioweapon…”

A hot sauce bottle floated by. On its label was a smiling starfish-like alien giving the starfish equivalent of a thumbs-up. A wave of despair and sorrow washed over her and suddenly the troubles of the Pfflgarrians seemed like the most weighty tragedy in the entire universe.

Olyrean groaned at the false sadness and wiped back her tears as she checked the channel. She thought it might be fake news. Some stations specialized in it, airing nonexistent tragedies, simulated complete with emoto-broadcasts so you could get the full impact and really *feel* how awful things were for the victims. Baxter was always watching this sort of nonsense.

But no, when she checked she saw that this was a real news report, so she grumbled and waited. She sat through this report, then another about the newest fashion trend sweeping the universe (“Living hats are all the rage! One hundred percent pure bio-bred fashionwear!” declared the announcer, playfully patting a beret that frowned haughtily at the attention and lit a cigarette), then a commercial that tried to make her sexually attracted to skincare products (she turned the emoto-broadcast down), and then finally what she had been waiting for, a broadcast from the proceedings of the Hyper-Senate.

She turned the emoto-broadcast back up and felt a surge of patriotic pride swell within her. The Hyper-Senate was an enormous circular chamber large enough to seat hundreds of thousands of Senators, aliens of all shapes and sizes, some with biologies exotic enough that they needed special equipment installed around their seats just to be able to breathe. The hologram was broadcast so that Olyrean felt as if she were sitting in the chamber herself, right in the middle of her living room.

The Hyper-Senate, at any given time, might be split into various committees and subcommittees, sometimes discussing as many as two thousand laws or budget proposals at once. It was complicated work, governing a republic that spanned over three thousand planets in forty-five different galaxies and seventeen alternate universes. However, right now, it was engaged in the one business that always united their attention: surveying other worlds for liberation.

Hanging in midair in the center of the Senate floor was a portal through which scenes from other worlds and universes were playing. Dozens of Libbys were scattered throughout the Senate, cheerleading the whole affair. Sometimes she appeared human, as she usually did to Olyrean; other times she took on the shape of other alien species: bubbling tentacled monstrosities, wolf-headed monkey-birds, thin globular membranes filled with glowing gas. But no matter which species she projected herself as, she was always heavily red, white and blue. Olyrean never quite managed to get used to how there were so many copies and different versions of Libby out there at the same time.

Vice President Murtlebix stepped forth. He was a small, toadlike creature wearing a damp business suit that clung unflatteringly to his round, flabby body. His three bright orange eyes darted in different directions as he held up a webbed hand for silence.

“First candidate for Liberation,” he croaked, “Dobo IV!”

In the air of the Senate a small bluish planet hung in the midst of a twinkling void.

Murtlebix took on the tone of an excited auctioneer. “Dobo IV is a planet in the tail end of the Wex-Wryland possibility mapping, residing near the center of the Wort Cluster. Magic-capable, pre-industrial society. Population of roughly three hundred million, with a single mammalian sapient species. Its dominant form of government is…” He licked his lips with two tongues, coating them with poisoned spittle, and salaciously intoned, “*feudal monarchy.”*

A thousand shrieks and squawks and belches of outrage filled the chamber in a chaotic din. Olyrean booed along with them.

As the Vice President continued to speak, the camera slowly zoomed in until scenes from the planet’s surface played before them. The inhabitants of Dobo were a species that looked a lot like extremely fluffy bipedal kittens. There were images of them bounding through fields, chasing butterflies, nuzzling with each other, and just generally being adorable.

Libby’s voice rang out over this: “The Dobosians–is that right? Is that how you say it?–well, anyway, the Dobosians are, as we can all see, a sentient species clearly capable of the pursuit of happiness. Intelligence reports suggest that their favorite activities are chasing bugs, staring off into nothing and then suddenly running into walls, knocking delicate objects off of high places and vomiting on carpets. But living as they do, trapped beneath disgracefully unelected leadership, most of them never get to so much as break a single glass. *This* is the life of the average Dobosian!”

The scenes changed, showing the kittens now toiling away beneath the hot sun in muddy fields that seemed to stretch on forever. They fell over each other clumsily, fumbling with their farm tools. According to Libby’s narration, they were farming a leafy plant whose local name translated to “God’s own high”. They piled mountains of the stuff on wagons and dragged them away to other kittens adorned in crowns and dripping with jewelry, who proceeded to roll around in the leaves and then appeared to try very hard to eat their own shadows.

“Ninety percent of most Dobosians’ lives is spent farming this drug for their rulers, while never touching a shred of it!” Libby declared.

The camera zoomed in brutally on their big, wet eyes as they wept and cringed beneath their taskmasters’ whips. The taskmasters themselves were kittens, too, but the camera work was done very carefully to capture a look of sadness and regret in their eyes. *We’d really rather not be doing this,* they seemed to say, *if only we were not indoctrinated into a system of divine right to rule, petty self-serving corruption, and authoritarianism.* That might seem like a complicated message for a look of the eyes to convey, but the cameras really were very good.

It was hopeless. The Senate was in a frenzy. Large words hung in midair above the pitiful spectacle: LIBERATE? Y/N. Bars beneath the question showed the percentage of votes given to each option. “YES” rocketed rapidly to one hundred percent.

Olyrean cheered. She was very pleased with this. She had followed Dobo’s progress through the whole convoluted political pipeline; it was the first real story she had been interested in once she had learned how to track the news. From the moment it had been detected by the space probes, through its recommendation through the subcommittee on bipedal mammalian liberation efforts (the same subcommittee that had recommended her own world for liberation), and now to the voting process.

The Dobosians–if that was the proper name for them, she realized she wasn’t quite sure–wouldn’t have to toil under slavery any longer. Very soon they’d be free, just as she was. Her eyes blurred with tears. In the hologram, dozens of the Libbys jumped for joy as the vote was verified.

“Olly!” one of them called. “Olllllyyyy! Your ride is here!”

With a jolt, Olyrean realized that this Libby was not part of the hologram; it was *her* Libby, trying to get her attention. With a gasp, she turned the hologram off, experiencing only a moment of disorientation as the Senate suddenly became her living room again. In her panic she knocked over the remains of her breakfast onto the carpet. A little robotic vacuum darted out from beneath her couch and gobbled up the remains of the toast. “Thanks!” it chirped.

“Good luck, Olly!” Libby called after her, as she dashed out the door. “Just relax! You’ll do great! You were *born* to do this.”

“I don’t see how that can be possible.” Olyrean swiftly tugged her jacket on and checked herself in a mirror. It was still strange, sometimes, to see herself dressed in American business clothes, rather than the elfly garb she had grown up with.

“It’s an expression,” the AI told her. “Like ‘spill the beans’ or ‘smash the snood’. The point is you’ll do great!”

Olyrean hoped she was right, but that didn’t stop her from being nervous. She was so distracted by the butterflies in her stomach, in fact, that she ran right into the giant butterfly waiting for her on her front porch.",1,1757800139.0,HFY,2,1.0,False
1ng9qel,https://www.reddit.com/r/JonBenetRamsey/comments/1ng9qel/did_john_finally_find_the_body_due_to_them_being/,Did John finally “find” the body due to them being physically unable to stay awake any longer? They were up all night.,"Discussing alibis present in the ransom note here got me thinking: https://www.reddit.com/r/JonBenetRamsey/s/OQDjpGauxd


They stated in the note the family should be rested for the exhausting delivery to give an alibi for napping in the day, and for what would be a long drive for John. The adequately -sized attache was an alibi for the body leaving in a suitcase. We can assume, their plan going in was not to reveal the body but to remove it. The note also gave an alibi for her being dead, as they had called the police against the note demands (and patsy just so happened to claim she never read that far). 

Ok, so that is the initial plan for the note. 

But WHY eventually reveal the body? No one forced them, although they may have been feeling some pressure due to repeated half-hearted searches. 

My opinion: they had claimed to have slept well ALL night. But come afternoon they were on what I have to assume was ZERO sleep due to the crime, mourning their daughter, planning and all manner of drama. The would have been a mess and hardly slept a wink. 

Now how are they going to possibly explain both parents falling asleep or looking like junkies just a mere few hours into trying to find the kidnappers? 

They were running out of time. Anyone who’s stayed up an entire night past 24 hours know each hour after that gets more bizarre, erratic and unsustainable. They pushed FAR already by this point, I have to assume they’d already been up 24 hours, maybe with an hour or two nap, tops, by the time police arrived. 

On that third search, John is exhausted beyond belief and feeling like he’s about to die. Coffee won’t do it anymore. His body is shutting down and he knows he needs everyone gone, now. He’s wondering how much longer Patsy can hang on to the charade too. 

He finally decides, “That’s it. I’m going to find her and get this over with”.  

A big part of the mystery is always “why random note” + “finding the body”? When you dive into the schemes and clues they left behind in the note, so much is revealed about what happened that night and what their plan was. 

This small revelation about why he may have finally revealed the body shows how logical all their decisions could have seemed to them at the time, but also how they had to pivot once backed into a corner. They tried to think of everything but ended up burning out halfway through. ",2,1757800113.0,JonBenetRamsey,6,0.63,False

Not a coach, not a self-help guru—just someone who got tired of feeling exhausted all the time.

In my late 40s, I started thinking:
“Maybe this is just what life is like after 50.”

•Shallow sleep
•Constant fatigue
•Low motivation
•Unstable libido
•Weekends spent doing absolutely nothing

Then one night, during a quiet conversation over coffee, a friend said something that shook me:
“Your phone and porn is the new sugar.”
I deleted all porn that night.
And I told myself:
No PMO for 90 days. No matter what.
Now I’m at Day 80, and while it wasn’t a miracle, something has definitely shifted.
Not loud. Not flashy.
But real.

【Here’s what actually changed】
	1.Sleep
Went from 3–4 hours of tossing and turning to 6–7 hours of deep rest.
	2.Energy & Focus
I no longer crash in the evenings. I even have the energy to go to the gym.
	3.Sexual Health
Morning wood is consistent. No porn urges. Libido feels grounded—not gone, just clean.
	4.Body Composition (measured weekly)
	5.Mental Stability
I don’t spiral into anxiety or irritability like before. I feel a sense of calm I haven’t felt in years.
	6.Appearance
Skin looks healthier. Eyes are clearer.
A colleague actually asked, “Are you doing something different?”

【Why I’m sharing this】
Most self-improvement stories you see online are from people in their 20s or 30s.
But what about us those in our 40s, 50s, or beyond who still want to fight back?
I’m not here to preach.
I just want to say:
Even in your 50s, you can rebuild. You can feel alive again.
NoFap isn’t magic.
But it gave me something I didn’t realize I’d lost:
Clarity. Control. Quiet strength.

【To anyone reading this】
If you’re spending your energy every day on scrolling, urges, and guilt…
If you’ve started thinking, Maybe this is just how life is now…
You are not done.
Your fire isn’t out it’s just buried under distraction.
Try 90 days.
Not for anyone else but for the man inside you who’s still alive.

I’m aiming for 120 days next.
Anyone else on this journey?
Let’s rise. Together.

1ng9faa,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/1ng9faa/sincere_question_about_sudden_onset_of_type_1/,Sincere Question about sudden onset of Type 1 Diabetes.,"Hello everyone! Since I am again pondering and overthinking about that stuff, I though of asking you guys and girls directly, since you have probably the msot knowledge on this topic (apart from actual Doctors). 

Ever since I heard the story a friend of mine (child of my mothers coworked), I am terrified by sudden Type 1 Diabetes. He was a healthy kid, one day he suddenly drank a lot of water, and went peeing quite often. The mother (a nurse) noticed it and made a urine test she had laying around, and he baisically was close to dying, she told me, since he was admitted to the hospital that same day straight away. It was most likely induced by stress through psychological issues. 

So my question would be: How do you actually recognize a sudden onset of Type 1? Like, can it really happen from one day to another, or would he have had symptoms already before? Because I am always terrified, since I go to the bathroom quite often, since I drink a lot (including tea and coffee), so I kind of freak out. I have my bloodwork done on a regular basis, including a urine analysis, apart from some minor issues with my kidneys (the Doc said not to worry about), I am otherwise healthy. What would be telltale signs that something is seriously wrong? Can peeing really be the only symptom, because my friend told me, that apart from the thirst (it was a hot day, and he played football) there was nothing wrong with him. I don't want to be disrespectful, but I honestly don't really belive that. That seems quite horrifying, that within one day you can go from ""I have to pee a lot"" to being dead, or dying in your sleep. Can this really happen, or is it exaggerated?

Thank you very much for your imput!",0,1757799303.0,diabetes_t1,4,0.4,False
1ng9exc,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1ng9exc/explore_daisyhome_cord_organizer_review_for_tidy/,Explore Daisyhome Cord Organizer Review for Tidy Kitchen Appliance Wire Management,"Daisyhome CO-NV-2024 Cord Organizer for Kitchen Appliances recently became an addition to my arsenal of kitchen tools. As someone who owns enough small appliances to outfit a commercial restaurant (okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration, but still), managing their cords had become an ongoing battle. I decided to give this cord organizer a try, not expecting much. I mean, how life-changing can a cord organizer truly be? Turns out, it surprised me—for better and for worse. Here’s my experience with this product as I’ve been testing it daily for several weeks.  

**Design and Functionality**  
The design of this cord organizer is both minimalistic and clever. It’s made from high-quality rubber, which feels sturdy and durable—exactly what you want in something that’s constantly gripping appliance cords. The key here is the nano tape adhesive that sticks to appliances without damaging their surfaces or leaving behind any residue. I tested it on my toaster, coffee maker, and blender, and removing it didn’t leave a single mark. The downside, though, is it requires a meticulous cleaning of the appliance’s surface before sticking, or it won’t adhere properly. My first attempt on a somewhat greasy air fryer ended up with it falling off within hours. Lesson learned: clean thoroughly.  

**Ease of Installation**  
Using these organizers involved only three simple steps. Clean the surface of the appliance, peel off the adhesive backing, and stick it firmly. The instructions also mentioned waiting six hours before wrapping cords, which adds a bit of unnecessary delay. I suppose it’s great for ensuring the adhesive bonds well, but for someone like me (impatient), it felt like watching paint dry. However, once installed properly, it was genuinely satisfying to wrap up those unruly cords in a neat coil.  

**Highlights**  
- Helps crush kitchen clutter by organizing appliance cords.  
- Rubber and nano tape materials ensure durability and secure attachment.  
- Fits most small appliances, including toasters, juicers, air fryers, and blenders.  
- Compact size with three slots accommodates various cord diameters.

[Ready to snag Daisyhome CO-NV-2024 Cord Organizer? See Amazon’s price.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0dg8hrxpq/)

**Merits**  
One of my favorite things about this product is how wide its compatibility is. It worked well with most of my appliances—my air fryer, the microwave, my mixer, and even a quirky-shaped juicer. Plus, the cord slots can accommodate wires of different diameters, preventing slips and tangles. The compact design doesn’t detract from the overall aesthetic of sleek, modern appliances, but instead blends right in. Its sturdiness deserves a mention too. Over weeks of daily use and a few hasty tugs, it remained securely attached to most appliances.

- Versatile range works on nearly all kitchen gadgets.  
- Sleek, unintrusive design blends into appliance surfaces.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
For all its strengths, there are a few drawbacks that can’t be ignored. The adhesive can be temperamental at times, especially if the appliance surface isn’t completely smooth or spotless. I also found that larger cords, such as the hefty cable for a pressure cooker, felt overly snug and almost too tightly wound to sit comfortably within the slots. Another thing worth mentioning is that if you accidentally place it on a wrong spot, repositioning is tricky—you risk ruining the adhesive in the process.

- Adhesive struggles with uneven or less-than-clean surfaces.  
- Bulky cords may not sit comfortably within the slots.  
- Repositioning can compromise the adhesive’s effectiveness.  

**Competing Brands**  
While I haven’t tried every alternative on the market, I did have experience with a few other cord management solutions before settling on Daisyhome’s product. For instance, silicone clips from a popular competitor lacked the durability that this rubber-based design offers. On the other hand, magnetic cable holders I tested were easy to use but often ended up misplaced or lost because they weren’t directly affixed to the appliances. Compared to others, this organizer stands out for staying put once applied, though it doesn’t quite surpass magnetic options in sheer convenience.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
When you stack up its features against its price (which I won’t reveal here due to frequent fluctuations), it offers great value for someone looking to declutter a messy kitchen. It’s not an unnecessary splurge, but rather, an affordable form of sanity in the chaos of cords. Cheaper counterparts don’t quite deliver the same durability, so I’d say it’s a pretty smart purchase if tidying kitchen counters is on your to-do list. Just don’t expect miracles—there are some limitations, after all.

I drink coffee just about daily, 1-2 cups. I live on my own and very rarely have visitors. One would be my mom, who has coffee as her social drink. I currently have a regular coffee maker that I've been satisfied with. It does its job, although I wish the warming plate and thermos in the decanter(?) could've been better. My only ""excuse"" to get rid of it would be for esthetic purposes as it feels big and bulky, especially for a one-person household. I could just get a smaller one.

I discovered the v60 and got curious. Some say that the coffee tastes better, others say that it takes more time and effort than a coffee maker. My only concern for getting one would be that I won't be having a warming function unless I pour it into a thermos. Another option would be to just skip most of the parts altogether and just get a filter holder to let the coffee drip directly into a cup/thermos. Or maybe a moka pot?

I do my everyday routines. Wake up, get ready for work, make my coffee and go on about my day. Come home. Make dinner. Do my night routine then head to bed. But…there has been something strange going on during the past few nights. I have heard footsteps above my apartment. I was in the middle of watching my favorite show in the living room while sitting on the couch.

I had a mouth full of popcorn before the footsteps caught my attention. I ignored it at first but as I swallowed my mouthful of popcorn I heard footsteps again. When I first moved in, my landlord had said that the apartment upstairs was empty. So why was their footsteps of supposed to be empty? 

I made a mental note to myself to ask my Landlord about it later if it happens again. I ignored it again and went back to watching my show. The apartment upstairs is said to be “haunted” but I don’t tend to believe in those kinds of things. I was never a believer in the paranormal. 

My older sister does believe in those sort of things but I’m what you call a skeptic. After that night two nights went by and it was silent. Everything was normal. Until I heard it again when it was about 2:55am. I was up late studying for class. 

I perked up hearing moving in the apartment. I tilted my head as the footsteps moved around. I decided to call my landlord to make sure it was true about what he had said about this apartment. It was starting to freak me out. Keeping me awake at night. 

This time, I grabbed my phone and called my landlord to ask if anyone had moved in.

He answered groggily and said, “No one’s up there. It’s been empty for years. We keep it locked.”

As he said that, I looked up. The footsteps had stopped—right above where I was sitting. My heart dropped to the pit of my stomach. 

As soon as my landlord said no one lived above me, the footsteps stopped—like whoever was up there knew I was asking about them.

I sat frozen, phone still in my hand, staring at the ceiling. Then, after a few seconds of silence, came a single knock. Not on the door upstairs. Not on the ceiling.

On my apartment door.

I came closer, every nerve in my body screaming not to look. But I did.

Through the peephole, I saw nothing. Just the dimly lit hallway. No one there.

And then—faintly—I heard the footsteps again. But this time, they weren’t above me.

They were inside my apartment.

So basically every 4-5ish days under maintenance (my maintenance is around 2300), I binge and undo all of my progress. This is a repeating pattern.

  
I do not know how to get out of this habit. I am 24f, 5'1, 120 lbs, and fairly active. Despite only attempting to eat in a very small defecit, after a couple of days I become so ravenous that I cannot ignore the hunger and go into a complete eating frenzy. It only becomes a binge if I keep ignoring the hunger, most days I would more just describe it as overeating. Bigger meals more often because I cannot get full.

  
I feel lethargic, I get in bad moods, I feel like I'm going to pass out, I need coffee and food every couple hours just to feel like a human being. Again, I'm 5'1 and eating over 2000 calories a day. This isn't normal. Recently had my fasting glucose done and it was 81 (so like dead center of normal range). So this is not a high/low blood sugar thing. I drink over a gallon of water a day. I eat over 120g of protein per day. I eat almost exclusively whole foods.

  
Most of the time I have willpower. But after about the third day of eating basically maintenance and still going to bed hungry, it's like something takes over me and a flip is switched and I just can't stop eating. I can eay 1000 calories in 10 minutes and still be hungry.

1ng94iy,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ng94iy/a_few_weeks_ago_i_m22_hooked_up_with_my_friend/,"A few weeks ago, I (M22) hooked up with my friend (M28) after getting drunk and I don’t know how to feel about it. Could this be something more?","Okay so. I’ve been thinking this over a lot and I don’t know what to do about it. This happened a few weeks ago and I've been obsessing over it ever since. So I had a messy fight with two of my roommates (M22 and M25) about something self-destructive I do related to a disorder I have. Anyways, it was bad enough I ran out of our house crying and I ended up at my friend’s place, who I’m calling Edward (M28) for clarity’s sake. Even though it was kind of late, he invited me in and let me rant, vent and cry about my roommates. Edward was super sympathetic about it since he deals with the same kind of disorder I do and it was really nice to have someone listen. Because it was a Thursday night and we both usually work weekends (and we’re men in our 20s), we decided to get drunk. Maybe not the best idea but I’ve never had great foresight when I’m sad.



So we’re both a little tipsy (me more than him since I’m pretty small) and Edward is still listening to my bitching and moaning. And I don’t know what it was about that but it made him look/seem really hot. I mean, Edward has been hot ever since we met like five or six years ago, this isn’t new. He’s six foot four, has visibly defined abs, an incredible face, beautiful tan skin and he’s strong enough that I’ve always felt safe with him around. For some reason, maybe because of the alcohol, Edward was completely irresistible in this moment and I kissed him. He seemed a little surprised at first but started kissing me back and it felt really nice, both physically and because it feels good to be wanted. Edward was so sweet about it too, he was cupping my cheek and touching my hair with so much affection that it made me feel crazy.



So one thing led to another and I put my hand down his pants and yeah. We had sex. A little clumsily and awkwardly because I’m pretty badly bruised and have a lot of joint and muscle pain right now. Edward was really gentle with me though and tried to be as careful as possible and kept kissing me and touching my hair. The actual sex part was fine but Edward was whispering sweet nothings to me, calling me gorgeous and telling me that he’s wanted to do this since forever. It just felt really nice to feel wanted and appreciated and for a second, I almost didn’t hate my body. Then we were done and Edward cleaned us up, held back my hair when I threw up and then helped me upstairs to his bedroom. I thought he was going to come to bed with me but he didn’t. Once Edward got me into bed and got me a mixing bowl in case I threw up again he left the room and slept on the couch.



So that’s kind of where I’m at right now. Edward made me coffee in the morning, let me use his shower and then drove me back to my place. And now I’m avoiding my roommates and obsessing over everything that went on with Edward. I can’t figure out what his feelings for me are or what to think about this whole situation. You might think I’m being stupid, that this is the most obvious situation ever but Edward does this kind of thing. He cheerfully calls himself “barsexual,” meaning he’ll make out with other guys after a few shots but has only ever dated women. He’s joked about hooking up with our boss/his friend (M28) and once he said he could do gay porn (I don’t even know). He also pretended to be upset when one of our other friends (M25) got a girlfriend. So I don’t know if Edward was just horny and going with it or if he wants something more.



What should I do about this? Do you think we could actually have something real? Also, is 28 too old for 22? Thanks <3



TL;DR: I, a man, had a drunk hookup with my straight male friend and now I’m confused about his feelings for me. I definitely have feelings for him now ",2,1757798496.0,dating_advice,6,1.0,False

Fermentation was done in a massive boat cooler (150 qt) with an old school crock pot and inkbird controller keeping it at 130 fahrenheit. Moisture / humidity was the biggest issue as it's not a perfect seal, but I'm going to switch to large 1 gallon mason jars as a trial next. I have over a thousand leaves still growing in coastal northern nj, zone 7b, humidity been 65% or higher 99% of time and forecasted out this way. Also have about 1000  curing in various different towel / bag trials and about 250 hanging for final drying. I had about 80 plants and enormous sucker crops that are still kicking away. About 500 leaves stacked in kiln added weekly with a unique band system to differentiate time added

1ng91hv,https://www.reddit.com/r/PurplePillDebate/comments/1ng91hv/plenty_of_men_are_shallow_unattractive_assholes/,Plenty of men are shallow unattractive assholes who never wanted to be good men.,"I feel like this needs to be directly addressed in terms of “only looks really matter”. There’s difference between “Im not attractive enough to get dates” and “Im not attractive enough for my shitty personality to be overlooked”. Sidenote: when I talk about about unattractive in this post, I mean the latter. What happened to this sub citing the 80/20 study that 80% of men were labelled unattractive but 60% got messaged from women? Thing is, you can away with not being hot if your personality is good. Thing is alot of guys arent as good as they think they are.

Alot, if not most, of these unattractive assholes claim they want to be good, but lie about themselves. Proof? See how fast most of them gawk at the idea that being good is rewarding in itself and the only thing they should want people being good/nice to them. To them, thats being a beta male cuck simp pussy. Hence, their idea of good/nice is being good/nice to a female just to get pussy. Also, remember that Elliot Rodgers called himself a gentleman and then went off to splash coffee onto people when the women didnt smile at him.

Other than the Elliot Rodgers types, these guys define being good as “as long as I dont commit crimes and crime, Im a good person”. An example: I guarantee most of those guys cannot figure what this guy did wrong: https://youtube.com/shorts/\_ke-Ep2Gu1E?si=hQjEK5xaF1HA7jIO.

These guys get mad when hearing “Well, if you tried to be a decent person, you’d get women” because they dont want to be decent people. Doesn’t matter that most women dont want assholes. There can 99 women at a party avoiding the asshole, but if there is even 1 woman that wants the asshole, THAT is who these guys focus on. Doesnt matter that she’s an asshole too, doesnt matter that she’s shallow, doesnt matter that she’s not stable, what matters is there’s a pussy between her legs and she’s willing to let an asshole in there.

So what’s the problem? If they’re not traumatized, women who date assholes are typically shallow. Now, the unattractive assholes are also shallow. Difference is unattractive assholes only care if a woman is willing to fuck. Shallow women only care if the guy is hot or rich. So yeah, those women might not care that you’re a piece of shit, but if youre not hot, theyre not even gonna give you a chance.

In conclusion, there’s a difference between “Only looks matter” and “Im too much of a dick for most women and not hot enough for shallow women to over look my shitty behavior”.",0,1757798280.0,PurplePillDebate,19,0.48,False

While there, they met and hung out with two single guys. My GF said she wanted to be a ""wingman"" for her friend whos single. After the festival, they all added each other on Instagram and she and her friend invited the guys out for coffee as a group.

When she told me about this, we had a pretty big fight. I told her I felt it was disrespectful to our relationship for her to be actively pursuing a friendship and hanging out with single men, regardless of the ""wingman"" context. It just didn't sit right with me and made me feel like she wasn't considering my feelings. She got very defensive and angry, saying that I was being controlling and that I didn't trust her.

We argued back and forth, and it eventually just fizzled out. We never truly resolved it, we just kind of agreed to move on.

So now: Fast forward to this week. She posted a photo of us, and I saw that one of the guys from the festival had liked it. Curiosity got the best of me, so I clicked on his profile.

I saw that my girlfriend has been consistently liking his posts for the past few months. A lot of these photos are of him on vacation, shirtless and clearly showing off his abs and physique. I wouldn't call them overtly sexual, but they are definitely ""look at my body"" type photos.

Seeing this made my stomach drop. All the uncomfortable and insecure feelings from our first fight came back.

I'm trying to be self-aware here. Yes, I am an insecure person, and I'm working on it. But I also feel like there's a boundary for what's acceptable in a relationship. When do her actions stop being about my insecurity and start being about her being genuinely disrespectful?

TL;DR: We fought months ago because my GF started a friendship with a single guy she met. We never really resolved it. I just discovered she has been consistently liking his shirtless/ab photos on insta. How do I talk to her about this without repeating our original, unproductive fight about me being insecure and not trusting her?",8,1757798264.0,AmIOverreacting,26,1.0,False

Near the end of August I started looking into what it could possibly be and an umbilical hernia seems the most likely. For context, I'm a 6 ft 185 lbs male who's been going to the gym on and off for the past year and a half, and when I first noticed the lump coincides with when I started doing deadlifts and ab work for the first time in ages. The hernia is also about a centimetre in width, not really noticeable unless I point it out, and hasn't grown.  
  
Where it gets a little concerning is that, while I feel no nausea or pain (just super mild discomfort in some positions some of the time), the hernia is fairly hard, I can't push it back into the hole, and it's slightly discoloured (a light pink, but I'm super pale so it doesn't seem like anything out of the ordinary). On top of this, I've been experiencing some kind of mild constipation for the past week or so that I can get past if I drink a coffee but even then my stool is pretty thin, which I've read is apparently common with intestinal blockages like hernias. I visited my doctor and she requisitioned an x-ray and ultrasound to figure out what's going on, but the clinic I called said they'd put me on a waitlist and get back to me last Thursday or Friday but didn't.

Needless to say, I'm not feeling great. This September has already been one of the most stressful of my life even without worrying about whether I have hernia or something worse, and I've heard thin stool/constipation can be a stress response as well. Really what I'm looking for is a bit of guidance. Should I try calling the clinic back? Should I go to ER? Any advice would be greatly appreciated, yall.",1,1757798225.0,Hernia,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Arizona State Sun Devils vs. Texas State Bobcats: A Clash of Contrasts (and a Few Jokes About Passing Yards)**

**Parse the Odds: The Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)**  
Arizona State (-17.5) is a near-90% favorite on the moneyline (decimal odds \~1.11), while Texas State (+17.5) sits at roughly 14% implied probability (decimal odds \~7.0). That’s the kind of gap you see when one team is “bringing the juice” and the other is just bringing juice (the kind you squeeze, not the kind you bet on). The total is set between 60.5 and 61.5 points, suggesting a high-scoring shootout—though ASU’s anemic passing attack (105th in FBS at 169.5 yards per game) might beg to differ.

**Digest the News: Injuries, History, and Why Last Year’s Near-Upset Matters**  
Arizona State’s offense relies on brute force: their rushing attack (28th in FBS at 226 yards per game) is a freight train, but their passing game is a bicycle with training wheels (and a flat tire). QB Sam Leavitt has thrown 3 TDs and 3 INTs—*exactly* the kind of performance that makes fans reach for their second cup of coffee. Meanwhile, Texas State’s Brad Jackson is a dual-threat wizard, averaging 250 passing and 41 rushing yards per game. Their offense is 16th-best in FBS (530 total yards per game), while their defense? Well, it’s like a sieve that’s been challenged by a sieve convention.

Last year’s 31-28 near-upset still stings for ASU fans, but this year’s Bobcats are 2-0 after a 43-36 pasting of UTSA. The Sun Devils, meanwhile, stumbled to a 24-20 loss against Mississippi State—proof that even a decent defense (21st-best against the run) can’t save a team with a passing game that’d make a lawn chair blush.

**Humorous Spin: Puns, Analogies, and Why This Game Feels Like a Bad Date**  
Arizona State’s passing offense is so lackluster, i

Bit of a long post but I really need any advice on the situation. My mum ordered a £90 dress about a month ago advertised as worn once and all the pictures showed it to be pristine, no stains, no broken bits, etc. The buyer asked for an extension on shipping so we said we’ll be on holiday towards the end of that time but if you post it soon that’s fine - she said she’ll post it the next day so we accepted the extension. She posted it three days later so by the time it got here we had gone away and the parcel was collected for us my a family member. Due to us being away it went to autocomplete so no issue were reported. We opened the dress when we got back and it was awful. Massive stain (looks like coffee) all down the back, gems falling off, threads coming off, small dirty marks all over it, etc. I wouldn’t have bought it for £10 never mind £90. We contacted the buyer explaining our issues and that he hoped she’d understand the autocompletion not being correct given we’d told her we’d be away and she’d posted later than agreed. She ignored us for a week so we left a bad review and she blocked us. We’ve contacted Vinted and just keep getting automated ‘decision already made’ emails back, is there anything we can do?? Thanks everyone. ",4,1757797947.0,vinted,4,1.0,False

None of my clothes fit. The seasons are changing, and my clothes from last year are too tight. I feel like a sausage in everything. I look at my old nudes and want to die. 

Been trying meds to keep the cravings down. Almost made it 24 hours. 

And before anyone tells me to switch to liquor or stop mixing or some shit, i drink whiskey, beer, black coffee, and water. It doesn’t matter that you’re not mixing when you’re having nearly 1000 calories in whiskey alone. ",9,1757797927.0,cripplingalcoholism,4,1.0,False
1ng8t43,https://www.reddit.com/r/cdramasfans/comments/1ng8t43/cant_get_over_otp_from_when_destiny_brings_the/,Can’t get over OTP from When Destiny Brings the Demon,"So I’m still suffering from withdrawals after watching this and coping by rewatching highlights and listening to the OST on repeat. I’m lowkey obsessed with Arthur Chen and want to see everything he’s been in. I can’t wait for Love Beyond the Grave.

There’s just something about the way he looks at her and has that soft smile. Or the anger and murderous glare he has at anyone that dares to hurt his woman. The chemistry between them and their kisses were 🔥. None of those stale kisses with fish lips. But even when they weren’t kissing they were just so affectionate like a married couple.

He has such a sexy deep voice and such expressive eyes that can convey tortured longing. Thinking about how he suffered in confinement for 500 years you just want to hug him. When he came out of Baifeng Mountain holding the dead boy and seeing what they had done to his clan my heart broke for him. But at the same time he’s also complicated and morally grey. I can’t imagine the pain he must have felt when he made her the necklace that protected her against everything but because of his arrogance he never thought it would be his spirit fire that hurts her.

Although I totally related to FL for her wanting to touch fish and slack off as I’m also a corporate drone that just wants to be lazy and enjoy eating and sleeping and going on vacation. At first I was a little annoyed that she kept needing to be saved because of her poor choice in friends and thus hurting ML. But you see her growth and by the end she’s such a badass as the demon mistress and can hold her own. I loved the role reversal with her as an immortal and him as the mortal emperor. Such a power couple.

I’m also glad it was a full on happy ending not open ending as a lot of these cdramas are. If you look closely at the clues like the name of the project and how he’s taking his time making coffee while waiting for her and the flashback to their parallel conversation it’s obvious that he has his memories of her and that he was able to find her again in this world. It’s heavily foreshadowed that they will find their way back to each other in any lifetime and are destined to always fall back in love with each other.

Some of my favorite scenes with our couple are:

- when she uses the mirror to reflect the truth spell on him and he first confesses how he feels about her

- when he asks her if he is her boyfriend

- when he carries her because he knows she’s too lazy to take the stairs and lights all the lanterns for her

- when he uses her as a body pillow when she’s an otter

- the way she lovingly calls him Jiao Jiao

- when she misses him and wants to call him on the “cell phone”

- when he teases her and eats her food and then she teases him back by doing the same to him. Then how he shares the food by taking a bite out of her mouth

- the way he could’ve restored her memories in the demon realm but takes his time to get her to remember because he wants her to go at her own pace to be comfortable with him

- how in the mortal realm she wants to wait to sleep together again because she wants him to remember his soul manor because sex is more intimate with their soul bond

- their wedding and them exchanging rings

- how relaxed and comfortable they are with each other in their soul manors 

- the way he was willing to sacrifice himself to save her but at the same time wants to give her a choice if she wants to endure pain to save him

- how she ends up making the same choice he did and also sacrifices herself to save him because she could finally understand his pain and what he was thinking

So many more moments but these were my top ones. What were your favorite moments? Are you also in love with their love story?

1ng8ncy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1ng8ncy/what_makes_the_pur_ppf951k3_replacement_pitcher/,What makes the PUR PPF951K3 replacement pitcher water filter worth your review?,"**Testing the PUR PPF951K3 Replacement Filter Daily in My Household**

I’ve been using the PUR PPF951K3 Replacement Filter for over a month now, and I must say, it has become a staple in my daily routine. With a family that swears by filtered water for drinking and cooking, we go through a lot of water, which means our filters need to work overtime. This specific filter, designed for PUR and Beautiful by PUR systems, has a lot to offer and some minor quirks worth discussing.  

**Design and Build Quality**  

This replacement filter stands out for its straightforward design and sturdy construction. Made from durable plastic, it feels like a piece of equipment that’s meant to last its intended life span. The compact dimensions of 7.6"" x 2.8"" x 7.9"" make it easy to handle, and at just about 531 grams, it’s not bulky to manage. The LockFit technology is a neat touch that ensures a snug fit into the pitcher or dispenser, making installation intuitive even for those who aren’t particularly tech-savvy.  

**Ease of Installation and Maintenance**  

I genuinely appreciate how no tools or additional equipment are required to get this filter up and running. It locks securely in place, eliminating the worry of unfiltered water mixing with filtered water. Swapping the filter is hassle-free, and trust me, that's a relief when you’re managing a busy kitchen. Its six-month shelf life for typical use (or 40 gallons) aligns well with regular pitcher filters, which keeps my routine maintenance predictable.  

**[Grab PUR PPF951K3 at the Best Price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b06wvdvdxb/)**  

**User Experience**  

Filtering water with this has been a smooth process. Our household of five consumes a significant amount of filtered water for drinking, brewing coffee, cooking, and even watering our houseplants. I’ve noticed that the water tastes noticeably fresher, with the unpleasant chlorine flavor effectively eliminated. While the improvement in taste alone is a massive win, one can’t ignore the relief that comes with knowing harmful elements like lead and mercury are reduced. However, I did experience a slight slowdown in filtration speed during the third week. It’s something I had read about in other user reviews but resolved by simply giving the filter a quick rinse, which helped restore its efficiency.  

**Positives**  

- Certified by NSF and WQA for reducing microplastics, lead, chlorine, and more.  
- Easy to install thanks to PUR’s LockFit design.  
- Lasts up to 40 gallons or approximately two months of use.  
- Drastically improves the taste and smell of drinking water.  

**Negatives**  

- The filtration speed may decrease after a couple of weeks, requiring a rinse.  
- Compatible only with specific PUR pitcher models, limiting its usability with other systems.  

**Features That Make a Difference**  

The highlight for me is the 3-in-1 filtration technology. I put this feature to the test by brewing tea and comparing it to tea brewed with unfiltered water. The difference in clarity and taste was immediate. The filter also claims to reduce copper and zinc, and while I can’t exactly verify that with my palate, the tea did feel less metallic. What’s also worth noting is the long-term savings it promises; switching from bottled water to using this filter truly feels like a financial relief.  

**Market Rivals**  

Having tried Brita, which is the immediate competitor for pitcher-style water filters, I’d say that while Brita offers decent flavor enhancement, the PUR PPF951K3 has a slight edge in removing contaminants based on certifications. ZeroWater is another alternative worth mentioning due to its TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) reader, but its flow rate can feel sluggish compared to this filter. PUR strikes a good balance between affordability, speed, and effectiveness.  

**Smart Spending**  

Considering the range of benefits, I see the PUR PPF951K3 as a cost-effective choice for individuals or families who prioritize clean and better-tasting water. While it isn't the cheapest on the market, the quality of filtration and ease of use justify the investment. For anyone hesitant to make the switch from bottled water, this filter offers a noticeable improvement without breaking the bank—at least in my experience.

1ng8n37,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1ng8n37/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

1ng8n2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewAuthor/comments/1ng8n2s/what_dya_think_about_the_first_few_paras_of_my/,What dya think about the first few paras' of my new book? Plan to have my main character poached by a big city law or policing firm. She goes on to lead an exciting life which all began after this first stroke with the law...,"She likes exploring old bookshops, buying books she knows she’ll never read. Drinking coffee with an exotic sugar shot and wearing matte lipsticks. Black black black clothes all the way. Jeans and a t-shirt perhaps with an oversized, button-down shirt if its chilly. 

Fiercely independent, she doesn't trust easily. Shes bored and restless living in an overly quiet rural town, where everyone knows everyone and the robbery of an off license last year; committed by bored teens was the biggest news of the year. She loves her cat; Toby, more than any blood family and her name is Evie. Like the Pokémon.  

On a warmer than usual Thursday evening she had just finished a late shift at the local coffee shop in town and began her short stroll home; she didn't get very far when she noticed she was being followed. One would expect panic to have set in at this point; as it would for any sane minded person, although Evie was getting more excited by the second.  

The thought of the possibility of having a real chance to put her over practiced self-defense techniques into a reality was getting her pretty riled up. As she turned the third needless corner to ensure this guy didn't follow her home but to a suburban new build housing estate that she knew would be full of housewives and husbands prepping dinner in their homes, but also to lengthen this weirdly enjoyable anxiety shed never had the joy of feeling before. She wondered if this is what good foreplay should feel like. Instead of the burning numbness shed usually feel prior to doing the deed. She was almost certain at this point that he was indeed following her; that's when she pretended to stumble.  

She heard footsteps quicken behind her along with louder than anticipated breathless gasps for air in and out as she swiped her leg over the gravel of Mr. Patterson's meticulously neat, but oddly pebbled front lawn and the surprisingly chubby guy tripped and fell, sprawled on all fours like a dog on ice. Uh, pathetic she thought as she quietly chuckled.  

She followed this up with a quick double jab to his flabby belly after shed rolled him over with an easier than expected flick of her foot and a rather needless but firm kick to his crouch. He was cowering at this point. She was almost disappointed at how fast and seamlessly the altercation had ended. Still chuckling. Although a tad louder. Loud enough for him to hear at least.  

From the corner of her eye, she saw Mrs. Patterson running out of the double fronted large farmhouse she shared with her grown children and husband, red cheeks ablaze and holding her early noughties style home phone up to her ear; screaming that she's calling the police. They're on the way. “Evie, will you get inside this house for goodness' sake” she shouted in between trembled gulps of air.  He tried to get up, but Evie then seized the chance to use a half body slam that the group learned just the week before in order to incapacitate him once more. She then scrambled to get his hands into a tight handcuff hold and remained this way until the police did turn up. “Dunna worry about me, Mrs. P. I got him” she said, smiling confidently.  

Hmm, almost too easy Evie thought. Although making sure her amusement wasn't showing at this point; she was after all the scared victim in this heinous act.  

Mrs. Patterson was openly annoyed that Evie didn't follow her back into the house as shed commanded but rather stayed in place holding this unfortunate chaps' hands behind his back in a rather over the top handcuff hold until the police arrived. It didn't take them long in this sleepy town, 5 minuets maybe. As per her own superiority complex Mrs. Patterson remained in the doorway so as she could escort everybody inside where questioning could commence.  

During which time one of the larger male police officers properly detained and escorted the bruised perp into the back of one of the 3 police cars that had arrived on blue lights. He stayed with him rather begrudgingly by the looks of it until questioning had finished and they were all able to drive off to the local police station.  

This was the most exciting job they had been called out to in years and he was furious he had to sit in the car; just because he was of a similar build to Mr. attempted rapist; whereas his 5 other coworkers were much smaller in size, 2 females of an older age and the others just skinny young lads, so they got the more interesting job of making initial enquires, asking questions and taking notes accordingly. Pens to their notebooks jotting down whatever they thought relevant; all pretending to hide their sincere enjoyment of attending an actual job for once. One that didn't involve Pat from number 18 stealing a lifestyle magazine of number 14’s; Barry and Barney. The only gay men in the village. That yet again wasn't properly pushed through the letterbox by the ready to retire postman, Clive.   

She has a cat called Toby. Med's idea is that the cat is unlucky. Even though he’s black lol.  ",0,1757797234.0,NewAuthor,5,0.5,False

1ng8jfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalPowers/comments/1ng8jfd/event_rcmp_operation_silent_night/,[EVENT] RCMP Operation Silent Night,"*Evening of December 24th, 2026 (We Do A Little Retro'ing)*

*Edmonton, Alberta, Canada*

After Carney’s announcement a month ago of the increased RCMP presence across the major cities of Alberta, finally a local task force had found a lead in Edmonton. Edmonton was always a beautiful city during the wintry months. A true representation of what it means to be Canadian, a blanket of snow covering the northernmost major city in Canada, a strong sense of freedom and true northern strength. Yet tomorrow, that strength could be tested, and it's the RCMPs job to ensure that doesn't, *can't*, happen.

A member of the Danielle Smith Brigade, codenamed Snowfall, turned into an RCMP insider shortly after the Calgary attacks. Snowfall, being a part of the Edmonton cell of the DSB, reported that attacks would be planned across Edmonton on Christmas Day, a time when most civilians would be away from major infrastructure to ensure limited casualties. The leader of the Edmonton Cell, so far known only as Phoenix, seemed a fair bit more reluctant than the Calgary cell to so willingly bring in civilians to this terror campaign the DSB are waging. Which meant in turn, the RCMP hoped, they were less well armed then the Calgary terrorists.

With only a month of intelligence to go off of, it was a difficult call, yet the upper echelons of the RCMP made the final decision to initiate *Operation Silent Night* tonight. Snowfall gave four addresses that were often mentioned at the meetings, yet only ever had been to two of the locations himself. The intel *better* have been good. The sun set only a few hours ago, and six unmarked SUVs sped towards their designated locations.

---------

*Squad One - 21:40, Beaumont*

Four bodies lined up by a door of an abandoned home in the middle of Beaumont, only thirty kilometers away from Edmonton. Snow had begun coming down, already laying a half of an inch thick layer upon the empty driveway. No lights on inside, dust lay thick across the door handle. Their weapons at the ready, the man nearest to the door waited for the call.

“On your go Sergeant”

The door creaked open as the man quickly chucked a flashbang through the doorway.

*BANG*

“Go.”

The four men entered the building.

--------

*Squad Two - 21:29, Outskirts of St. Albert*

The two unmarked SUVs sat idle two blocks away from their target. A runner went forward to scout the area first, this was one of the two locations that Snowfall was confirmed to have personally been to, and it justified significantly more preparation than the other three.

One of the agents leaned outside their SUV smoking, wisps of smoke rising in the cold air as storm clouds came closer. “Gonna start snowing soon, Jarreau better hurry his ass up.”

Moments later, a person turned the corner and stayed there, facing the SUVs. Their flashlight blinked once, then twice, then held longer on a third, then a fourth blink. Suspects are occupying the building, likely armed. The smoker got back into his SUV, and both drove to the location.

*Minutes later*

One SUV pulled up only a few houses away from the location. Lights were on, several bodies were inside, cars lined the street. To any normal citizen, it would seem like a perfectly normal Christmas party.

Further down the block, well past the location, the second SUV unloaded at the crest of a hill the road goes up. Two of their members would go behind the house at breach with the other SUV, while the other two would set up a sniper's nest in the SUV.

“See anything Jacque?”

‘Only silhouettes, but I can make out at least one armed with presumably a rifle.’

“Presumptions could get us fired.”

‘I’m not planning on going for lethal shots anyways George.’

A chuckle, then silence. The first snowflakes began to fall.

“Have they gone in yet?”

Through the scope, Jacque could see the four RCMP agents in full gear lined up by the front. One was giving hard to make out hand gestures, then another shot the door hinges with their shotgun. The shots rang out across the block. “Just breached.”

--------------

*Squad Three - 21:51, Evansdale Neighbourhood, Edmonton*

“A pub? Really? Are we sure Mr. Snowfall is reliable?” An agent asked as the SUV pulled up into the parking lot of the local neighbourhood pub in Evansdale.

“Are you seriously implying you don’t think at least some domestic terrorists would meet at a pub? Ever hear of, I don't know, the IRA?” A second agent responded back.

“Fair point,” The first agent said as he checked his pistol. “Alright, let’s remember. There’s going to be a fair amount of civilians here. We got to make this as clean as possible, not a single shot fired unless we’re threatened first.”

The four men, dressed as casually as they could be, strolled into the pub.

*Squad Four - 21:59, Downtown Edmonton*

Two unmarked SUVs pulled up to the front of the Palisades, a rather nice apartment building in the heart of downtown. Supposedly, this was the home of Phoenix, which Snowfall had personally been to on several occasions. Eight men ran out of their SUVs and funneled into the apartment building. 

“Room 802, get up there. Roy, Gallagher, with me, we’re going to the roof and going in through the fire escape.”

The hallway on the eighth floor looked entirely inconspicuous, like any other middle-class style apartment building, up until you got to the door of 802. Scruff marks near the lock, splintered wood, as if someone had already broken in, and the door left ajar. One of the agents grabbed his radio. “Ferrin, we have an issue.”

“Wha-*tzzz* pr-*tzzz*-em?” It crackled back.

“Ferrin the door has already been breached by another party.”

“*tzzz*-cape, breac-*tzzz*.”

The agent put his radio away, “what the fuck is going on here with this interference? Whatever, we’re going in.”

The door got kicked open.

*RCMP Command - 23:30, Edmonton*

“Have all squads returned?” Deputy Trevor Daroux asked as he came back from his break with a Tims coffee in hand.

“Yes sir,” a clerk responded as she organized several papers. “Their reports are here for you to read, the field autopsy report is also attached to Squad One’s report.” She offered all the papers as he walked past.

The Deputy grabbed them and quickly checked to see if all the pages were there. “Fantastic, you can return home Jessica, Merry Christmas.”

“Thank you sir, Merry Christmas to you too.”

The Deputy placed his coffee down on his desk, sat down, and began to read about how his men thwarted potentially one of the most dangerous terrorist attacks on Canadian soil. Maybe a medal was in store for him and his men.

---------

Squad One Report - Location was clearly abandoned for a significant amount of time. In the main living room sat Mr. Snowfall tied to a chair, clearly deceased. Autopsy report attached to file. No evidence of DSB activity besides the dead informant.

Squad One Autopsy Report - Mr. Snowfall, AKA Jacob Bryans. Aged 31. Caucasian. Cause of death: Four bullet entry wounds across the chest, three exit wounds on the back. External Examination: Teeth smashed in ante mortem, broken nose ante mortem, broken hands post mortem. Internal Examination: N/A - Delay for full autopsy. Toxicology: N/A - Delay for full autopsy.

Squad Two Report - Location was occupied by several members of the DSB. Seventeen suspects in custody. Cache of small arms seized, four rifles, several hundred rounds of ammunition. Ten IEDs seized. Seven suspects fled the scene. Two suspects were killed after opening fire on us.

Squad Three Report - The Pub is confirmed to have been a common DSB hangout, the owner claims to have no knowledge of his patrons activities nor allegiances. The owner's office was, however, filled with Alberta Sovereignist paraphernalia as well as a rifle. The owner was taken into custody, requesting a warrant to search his house.

Squad Four Report - Apartment 802 of the Palisades was already breached prior to our arrival, the entire apartment was in disarray, suspect Phoenix was nowhere to be seen. Three journals were seized which make it clear Phoenix is the legitimate leader of the Edmonton Cell but otherwise seems to contain no significant information about the identity of any other leaders nor other locations, densely filled with codewords, recommend assigning a codebreaker & chirographetics expert to work on the journals. A laptop was seized, however upon entering the wrong password it seems to have cleared its entire hard drive, considered useless. A surveillance squad has been deployed to maintain 24/7 coverage of the Palisades apartment building, although we determine it’s unlikely Phoenix returns.

**Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game**  
The Samsung Lions (-150) are the clear favorites here, with implied probabilities hovering around **57%** to win outright. The KT Wiz (+200) are the underdogs, offering a 49% implied chance, but their +1.5-run spread (1.54 odds) makes them tempting for a “cover-the-spread” play. The total runs line is set at **10.5**, with the Under priced slightly better (1.8–1.95) than the Over.

Samsung’s dominance in the moneyline is no accident—they’re the KBO’s most popular team, buoyed by a fanbase that treats games like a culinary convention (think stadium hotdogs that could double as hiking gear). KT, meanwhile, leans on Kang Baeh-woo, a .275 hitter with 13 HRs this season… and a defensive résumé that makes a sieve look like a pro.

**Digesting the News: Kang’s Redemption Arc and Samsung’s Snack Attack**  
Kang Baeh-woo is the headline act for KT, but his defensive struggles are the plot twist. After being roasted as “the Korean early-exit culprit” for his 2023 WBC gaffes, he’s now a designated hitter by necessity, not choice. His MLB aspirations? Ambitious, but if he’s dodging pop flies like they’re exes, the majors might send him a cease-and-desist.

Samsung, meanwhile, thrives on chaos. Their stadiums are less about baseball and more about “let’s eat, dance, and maybe watch the game later.” With themed menus like the SSG Landers’ “Starbucks Slammer” (a drink so strong it could strike out a coffee addict), fans are more likely to be seen juggling takoyaki than tracking line drives.

1ng8iha,https://www.reddit.com/r/airport/comments/1ng8iha/trapped_in_a_worlds_best_airports_gate_a_story_of/,"Trapped in a ""World's Best"" Airport's gate: A Story of Condescension in Singapore Changi Airport","We’ve all heard the hype. Singapore’s Changi Airport wins ""World's Best Airport"" year after year. It’s a destination in itself, with its stunning waterfalls, butterfly gardens, and luxurious shops. My experience there in September 2025 was different. It was a masterclass in poor design and shocking customer service that left me feeling less like a passenger and more like a prisoner. The ""best airport in the world"" had reduced a basic human need to a humiliating ordeal and met it with arrogance.

I went to Singapore for business in early September. I flew back to Seattle on 9/13 Singapore time with SG28. I had the worst airport experience ever. I just reached home and felt the I need to share my experience.

My gate was A15. It’s quite far from the ticketing area. Passengers needed to walk through a big shopping area, take the airport train, and reach a different wing for gates A15 to A21.

As a somewhat anxious person, I generally want to find the gate first, and then go shopping, get food, or use the bathroom so I can have a sense of security knowing where the gate is. So I skipped the shopping area and went straight to the airport train, and reached the wing of my gate.

The wing is very beautiful and uses a lot of glass, and it feels spacious and connected. A15 is the first gate in the wing, and there's security before the gate. It never crossed my mind that the gate was a glass trap and is completely enclosed (except for the tunnel to the plane); once you pass security, you are trapped in just the A15 gate area. The elegant walls had no doors. Once you’re in, you’re in. There were no bathroom, no shops, no cafes, not even a vending machine—just two water fountains and a painfully slow hot water dispenser with a long line. There was no warning signs anywhere before I entered the gate.

I didn’t realize that the glass walls had no openings until I passed security. It was still \~50 min until boarding. I asked the gate staff whether I could get out to go shopping and get some hot coffee, and that I was willing to go through security again. One staff member yelled in an angry voice, ""No time for shopping! Why didn’t you do it earlier?!"" I said, ""I thought there would be shops near the gate and I didn't realize the gate has no way out!"" And the staff said, ""Which airport in the world has shops all the way until the gate?!""

I chuckled. I travel a lot for both business and leisure. Almost all of the airports I've been to have at least a coffee/snack shop near the gate that we can access, even in Arctic Greenland. In this entire wing in the Singapore airport, there was ZERO thing that I could spend money on.

Okay, fine, I said to myself, it’s a weird design, but I guess I don't have to go shopping or get coffee. It’s okay to just sit at the gate for 45 min and hopefully I can board soon after boarding starts. So I had some cold water from the fountain and went to sit and stare out the window.

After a little while, I felt a flush of blood, including clots, from my uterus onto my menstrual pad. It was the second day of my period. The pad quickly became gooey and felt uncomfortable. I wanted to change it.

So I walked to another staff member and asked if I could get out of the gate to go to the bathroom, and that I was happy to go through security again. The staff was very nice at first. She asked for my passport and boarding pass. Then she said she needed to take them to do some special process that would let me get out. When I was done with the bathroom, I would go through security and then I could get my passport and boarding pass back.

I hesitated; I feel extremely uncomfortable giving my passport and boarding pass to a stranger (even though she was airport staff) and not having it in my sight, even for a short period of time. So I asked, ""I can’t just get out like I never came into this gate?"" And the staff said, ""It’s better to hold it and use the bathroom after boarding the plane. If you really need to go now, then I need to take your passport and boarding pass.""

Okay, I told myself, I’ll just deal with a continuous gush of blood clots at the gate for the next 30 to 40 minutes and hope no blood escapes onto my pants. I thanked the staff and remarked in a very normal and calm tone, ""The design of the airport is so weird! Passengers can’t even go to the bathroom easily when waiting at the gate.""

Her mask of courtesy fell completely. She thrust my documents back into my hands and replied in Chinese with utter contempt: ""This is the best airport in the world. Even the best airport cannot satisfy you? You stay home."" And she quickly walked away with rolled eyes. (I'm Chinese living in the US for decades and our conversation was in English until she had my Chinese passport).

I was standing in that beautiful, sterile glass box, with a bleeding uterus and her arrogant voice resonating in my ears. I was speechless.

As I mentioned before, I travel a lot and have been to easily 100+ airports in 60+ countries with all levels of development in the past 20 years. EVERY SINGLE airport I've been to before had bathrooms at the gate that passengers can easily go to whenever they need them before boarding, without going through any ""process"". Even the tiny airstrips in Greenland and around the equator. Singapore airport, which proudly claims to be the best airport in the world, does not, at least in gates A15 to A21 as of 9/13/2025.

An airport that is designed to trap passengers and not give easy access to bathrooms at the gate without surrendering documents should not be considered the best airport in the world.

An airport that does not give warnings that their gates are a glass trap with nothing other than water fountains, so passengers can prepare for things before entering the gate, should not be considered the best airport in the world.

An airport whose staff repeatedly talks arrogantly to passengers asking for normal needs should not be considered the best airport in the world.

Changi has its waterfalls and its shiny awards. But an airport that prioritizes international image and revenue over passenger well-being both physically and mentally, has failed in its most fundamental duty.

It’s not the best airport in the world. It’s just the prettiest trap.

P.S. Before this happened, I also had a bad experience at the entrance area to immigration to leave Singapore. That area was a mess with a mix of passengers and families seeing them off. I waited in what looked like a line at the stands for passport checks, but people kept cutting in (maybe it wasn’t a line, I’m not sure). The staff was just coldly taking whoever's passport and didn’t respond to my question about whether I should wait there. So I had to extend my pathetic short arms and fight for the opportunity to get my passport checked while being pushed around by some random passengers/families.",0,1757796900.0,airport,0,0.5,False

He has many female friends (with whom he feels comfortable going out at night or staying more time together), a life full of things to do and I feel he has never had experience with a woman. He’s 28.

1ng8h9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductCheckpoint/comments/1ng8h9w/explore_how_tyler_diva_laundry_detergent/,Explore How Tyler DIVA Laundry Detergent Transforms Your Wardrobe,"Testing the Tyler DIVA Glamorous Wash Laundry Detergent has been a journey—and trust me, I’ve tried everything from popular name brands to boutique concoctions. This product stands out not just because of its name but also because of its promise to elevate an everyday chore into something... dare I say, glamorous. With its half-gallon size, Olivi stain remover pen, and fresh-scented sachet included, it’s a thoughtful little package meant to impress. Here’s what it was like putting this detergent through its paces.

**Unboxing the Luxury Feel**

The presentation of the Tyler DIVA Glamorous Wash immediately caught my attention. Right out of the box, it didn’t feel like your ordinary, run-of-the-mill laundry detergent. The bonus items—a stain remover pen and a sachet—made the whole set feel like more than just a utilitarian purchase. And the scent? Wow. Before I even opened the bottle, I could detect a delicate yet fabulous fragrance floating out. My laundry room smelled unbelievably fresh before I even got started washing.

**Ease of Use and Features**

Using this luxurious detergent felt, oddly enough, quite straightforward for something so fancy. It’s compatible with both machine and handwashing, a versatility I always appreciate. I used it for everything from heavy-duty sheets to delicate fabrics like satin pillow slips and lingerie. The detergent didn’t require a crazy amount to get the job done, which was a major win. The Olivi stain removal pen surprised me; I gave it a try on a coffee spot that somehow ended up on my blouse, and poof—it was gone with hardly any effort. 

[Check Tyler DIVA Glamorous Wash Laundry Detergent price on Amazon.](https://reviews.senaar.com/p/b082j75846/)

**Favorable Aspects**

The Tyler DIVA Glamorous Wash truly shines in areas where most other detergents fall short.  
- The fragrance is unique and long-lasting, leaving clothes and linens smelling luxurious without being overpowering.  
- It's gentle on delicate fabrics while still delivering a powerful clean.  
- The bonus stain remover pen and fresh-scented sachet add value and thoughtfulness to the product.  
- It effectively eliminates tough stains, even on light-colored fabrics, without requiring pre-washing rituals.  

The feature that stood out the most for me was how effective it was with specialty fabrics. Sometimes you need a specific detergent for delicates, but this one managed to handle everything I threw at it.

**Areas for Improvement**

Of course, no product is perfect, and this one has a few quirks worth noting.  
- The premium pricing compared to regular detergents might deter budget shoppers.  
- Since it’s heavily scented, those with extremely sensitive noses may find it overwhelming.  
- Using too much in a wash cycle can lead to overly fragrant (borderline cloying) results.

While these points didn’t diminish the overall experience for me, they’re something to keep in mind depending on personal preferences.

**Direct Competitors**

When it comes to high-end laundry detergents, the Tyler DIVA Glamorous Wash faces stiff competition from brands like The Laundress and Persil ProClean Intense Fresh. Compared to The Laundress, which also caters to delicate materials, Tyler stands out with its special extras like the stain remover pen and sachet. Though The Laundress often markets itself as environmentally conscious, I felt that the fragrance payoff was far superior with Tyler. On the other hand, Persil, known for its stain-fighting capabilities, falls short in offering a similarly luxurious fragrance experience. If cleaning power and a whiff of glamour are equally important to you, Tyler feels like the better-rounded choice.

**Value Proposition**

While Tyler DIVA Glamorous Wash is undoubtedly pricier than your average grocery store detergent, I found the price-to-quality ratio justified for my needs. It's not just about clean clothes here; it's about elevating the washing experience. If you’re someone who loves paying attention to subtle details, like keeping linens scented as though they just visited a luxury spa, this detergent is worth the investment. The added stain remover pen is genuinely useful, making this an even smarter buy for families or individuals prone to spills and accidents.

Maine’s Board of Pesticides Control says two summer residents poisoned a neighbor’s trees so the couple, both Martha Stewart associates, could have a harbor view. They deny it.","[https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/us/trees-poison.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/us/trees-poison.html)

  


In 2017 Stephen Antonson, a Brooklyn home furnishings artisan, and his wife, Kathleen Hackett, an interior designer and writer who counts Martha Stewart among her clients, bought a summer house in Rockport, Maine, a coastal town of fine arts, lobster boats and stunning views of Penobscot Bay.



At $320,000, the small, 19th-century clapboard house was among the lower-priced properties on Mechanic Street, known for its stately homes overlooking the town’s scenic working harbor.



The Antonson-Hackett home had no such vista. Although there was a lot behind their house in sight of the harbor, it was thickly wooded and owned by Ruth Graham, the widow who lived next door.



Almost immediately, the couple asked Mrs. Graham about clearing her land of the trees that blocked their view. She refused. She was an avid gardener, and killing trees repelled her. Also, years before, she had been cited by the town because one of her two sons, unaware of strict rules protecting shore land forest, had cleared some scrub trees from her property.



Mr. Antonson and Ms. Hackett were not about to give up. They even enlisted their two children in their quest for a valuable view.



But Mrs. Graham, nearly 90 at the time, was, like her trees, immovable.

The Allure of Rockport

ImageA smiling Ruth Graham, in profile, wears pearls and a black top with a floral print.

Although Mrs. Graham was legally blind, she refused to let that get in her way. She hosted neighborhood parties, walked her dog, Charlie, in all kinds of weather and, with the help of a software program, composed musical scores on the piano.



Douglas Cole, a retired surgeon and a friend of Mrs. Graham’s, described her as “such a pistol.”



“She would have us over to her house to dinner and kind of direct everybody what to do,” he said.



Mrs. Graham became a year-round Rockport resident when she moved there with her husband, Wallace, a retired global business executive, in 2010. But he died a short time later. Although Mrs. Graham’s two sons invited her to move nearer to them in Massachusetts or New Jersey, she decided to stay put — captivated, friends said, by the artistic offerings in town and the beauty of the area.



She trained roses to climb up the waterfront balconies of her home, and in winter her heated side porch sheltered a collection of geraniums and ailing house plants she was nursing for friends. She allowed neighbors, including the Antonson-Hackett family, to dock boats and swim from her wooden pier.

Mrs. Graham allowed neighbors, including the Antonson-Hackett family, to dock boats and swim from her wooden pier that extended into Rockport Harbor.



In 2011, a New York Times feature article called Mr. Antonson, 59, and Ms. Hackett, 60, “lucky in real estate,” detailing how they had bought, rehabbed and flipped a below-market apartment in Carroll Gardens in Brooklyn for more than double what they had paid. This allowed them to buy a $1.8 million Italianate rowhouse in Boerum Hill. In the article, they described meeting while both worked for Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia a decade before.



Mr. Antonson’s atelier website calls him an “engaging designer” who was “crowned the master of plaster by Architectural Digest.” Some of his plaster-coated ceiling lamps are priced at upward of $20,000.



Ms. Hackett, an author and contributor to Elle Decor and other shelter magazines, is described on the [MarthaStewart.com](http://MarthaStewart.com) website as a writer with “a passion for the culinary arts and interior design.” On her Amazon author page, she also calls herself “the family CEO, CFO, Chairman of the Ethics Committee, and Secretary of the Interior.”

Ms. Hackett is a co-author of two coffee table books about Maine houses, “The Maine House” and “The Maine House II,” which extol their authors’ “reverence for the land.” In the second book, Ms. Hackett wrote that the authors “felt awe” and “relief” that one of their subjects had “refused to cut down the stately tamarack that blocks his view of the ocean.”

A Letter from Children

Ms. Hackett’s Rockport home also appears in the book. “In a village that was in the midst of unprecedented change, further erasure of the past would not come as a surprise, though the sting would last forever,” Ms. Hackett wrote. “We were determined to leave the house — built in 1860 and added on to willy-nilly — just the way it was. Aren’t those quirks what attracted us to it in the first place?”



The woods that blocked their view of the harbor seemed a different matter.



Just before the summer of 2020, when the pandemic was sending real estate prices soaring in coastal New England as New Yorkers fled the besieged city, Mr. Antonson and Ms. Hackett sent Mrs. Graham a note in a childish scrawl, signed by their two sons, who were both teenagers at the time.



“It means a great deal to us to have such an accepting and generous neighbor,” the note read. “As my brother and I grow older, and our activities become more active and outdoorsy, we’re always looking for an easy and more accessible place to play to maximise our number of outdoor activities. We understand that the land behind our house is owned by you, and since my brother and I are looking for a backyard of sorts, think 25 feet of land is a reasonable number.



“My parents have agreed to pay for the surveyor fees and the attorney fees. Would you consider selling us a slice of land?”



In a P.S., the brothers offered to walk Mrs. Graham’s dog.

The letter that Mrs. Graham said was written by Mr. Antonson and Ms. Hackett in the style and voice of their children.



Mrs. Graham showed the note to her son Steven Graham, who handled her affairs. In an interview, Mr. Graham said he and his mother had “thought it was ridiculous.”



The boys seemed old for backyard play, but too young to be discussing surveyor and attorney fees. Mrs. Graham, her son said, believed that Mr. Antonson and Ms. Hackett were leveraging her age and infirmity to take advantage of her. She politely declined the offer.



The following year, Mrs. Graham noticed something strange, despite her failing eyesight. Her trees on the property next door had begun to wither and die.

Herbicidal Poison

Image

Mrs. Graham contacted an arborist, who referred her to Maine Forest Service officials, who found large bore holes in the trunks of the dying trees. They turned the case over to investigators from the state’s Board of Pesticides Control, who discovered a stand of six to eight cedars, ranging from 30 to 60 feet tall, and another clump of about four maple trees, all dying or dead.



Tests of liquid from inside the bore holes revealed herbicidal poison. The poisoning was “limited to a distinct corridor of trees directly in line with the deck of the Antonson residence,” the board said in a report.



Alexander Peacock, the board director, said in an interview that he had tried to contact the Antonson-Hackett family but had received no response. Mrs. Graham, fearful that the largest of the dead trees could fall on her house, simply paid to have them removed.



“She didn’t want to get involved in an adversarial situation with her neighbor and be uncomfortable every time she came out of her house,” her son said. He and his brother discussed suing Mr. Antonson, he said, but Mrs. Graham told them she did not want her last years consumed by strife.



Mr. Peacock’s team continued to pursue Mr. Antonson and Ms. Hackett. They called, knocked on their door in Rockport and sent letters that reached their Brooklyn address. In the spring of 2023, nearly two years after Mrs. Graham first noticed her withering trees, Mr. Peacock heard from a lawyer for the couple, Daniel Nuzzi. The couple, Mr. Peacock recalled Mr. Nuzzi’s saying, maintained they were not the culprits but agreed to begin talks about a consent agreement on a penalty fine.



Mr. Nuzzi has since retired. This week, The Times emailed questions about the tree poisonings to the couple’s new lawyer, Michael Carey, who responded, “Mr. Antonson and Ms. Hackett have no comment.”



The case took another turn in the fall of 2023 when Denise Munger, who chairs Rockport’s Select Board and had befriended Mrs. Graham on long walks during the pandemic, noticed an alarming sight. “My husband and I were coming into the harbor on our boat and were like, ‘Holy cow, there was a whole new stand of dead trees,’” she said.

Image

Denise Munger, who chairs Rockport’s Select Board, noticed more dead trees on Ms. Graham’s property two years after the first poisoning.



The pesticide investigators returned to Mrs. Graham’s property and found a smaller stand of dying maples, each 30 to 40 feet tall, with poison dumped at their bases, on the same swath of land lining up with Mr. Antonson and Ms. Hackett’s rear windows.



“The Board finds that the positioning of the affected trees, in addition to prior correspondence from the Antonson’s to the Graham’s requesting tree removal, indicate that Antonson would have been the only one to benefit from the application of herbicides to the affected area,” the board’s report read.



The couple still said that they had not done it. Nonetheless, early this year Mr. Antonson signed a proposed consent agreement with the board in which he denied guilt and disputed the investigation’s findings but agreed to pay a $3,000 fine — the maximum under current law for the two poisonings.



Ms. Hackett, who during the talks was promoting her second Maine book about the “importance of preservation, restoration, thoughtful renovation and low-impact living,” was not named in the consent agreement.



Just one step remained: a vote of approval of the deal by the pesticide board’s seven-member public policy board at its open meeting in March.

Tree Crime

In 2021 another incident of neighborly arboricide in Camden, Maine, a town next to Rockport, resulted in more than $1 million in a legal settlement and fines after the industrial herbicide a couple used to kill a neighbor’s oaks leached onto a public beach.



Neighborly arboricide “was something that nobody ever called us about,” Mr. Peacock said. “Now we see the news all over the country.” He speculated that the reason for the increase in reports was “maybe more people paying attention,” but others cited escalating property values along exclusive stretches of the East and West Coasts and a general breakdown in neighborly relations.



There is no reliable data to determine how many such attacks occur each year, but there is abundant anecdotal evidence that homeowners have turned to chain saws and poisons when they can’t see the vistas for the trees.



Next door to Rockport in Camden, Amelia Bond, a wealthy former chief executive of a St. Louis charitable foundation, drew global attention last year and paid more than $1.7 million in a legal settlement and fines after the industrial herbicide she used in 2021 to kill a neighbor’s oaks migrated onto a public beach.

Residents worried that the Camden poisoning had contaminated beaches and fish.



In 2023 in Kittery, an hour’s drive down the coast, the Pesticides Control Board found evidence suggesting that a business executive, Peter Melendy, had used poison to kill his neighbor’s trees in order to improve his view. Mr. Melendy denied the allegation, and the case is in progress.



On Nantucket, Mass., this summer, a homeowner, Jonathan Jacoby, was sued and prosecuted after he sawed down what he called his neighbor’s “crappy” trees in the Cisco area and then promoted his home’s “sweeping ocean views” in an ad listing the property for sale for $10 million. On Martha’s Vineyard in 2023, the owners of the Beach Plum Inn and an associate paid a $2.5 million settlement to a neighbor for clearing more than 130 trees from the neighbor’s property overlooking Menemsha Harbor.



In April, the town of Southbury, Conn., won $600,000 in damages in its lawsuit against a New York lawyer and his spouse who the town said had contracted to clear scores of town-owned trees in order to improve their view of Lake Lillinonah. In Issaquah, Wash., this summer, King County sued several homeowners for $7 million, saying they had felled more than 140 protected trees inside Issaquah’s Grand Ridge Park to enhance their mountain views.

‘Pocket Change’

In March of this year, before the vote of the pesticide policy board, board members read letters sent to them by, among others, Mr. Graham and Dr. Cole, Mrs. Graham’s friend and neighbor. “The recent Camden case is nationally notorious,” Mr. Graham wrote. “This act is similarly obnoxious. The fact that it was perpetrated in a manner that took advantage of an elderly, frail and legally blind person is egregious.”



Dr. Cole expressed quiet outrage. “It is discouraging that with no admission of guilt, no requirement for restoring the trees on Ruth’s property, and only a $3000 fine (pocket change found under the sofa cushions in this neighborhood), the message is being sent that crime does pay,” he wrote.

“It completely smacks of privilege,” Douglas Cole, a retired surgeon and a friend of Mrs. Graham’s, said of the deal negotiated by Mr. Antonson and Ms. Hackett.



The consent agreement was rejected, and the board directed Mr. Peacock to secure a deal in which Mr. Antonson would admit guilt — a major sticking point in the ongoing talks. Mr. Graham said his family was waiting on the outcome to decide whether to sue Mr. Antonson and Ms. Hackett.

‘This is Not Going to Go Away’



Last month in Rockport, Ms. Hackett warmly greeted a New York Times reporter who had arrived unannounced and introduced herself at Ms. Hackett’s kitchen door. Ms. Hackett’s tone changed when she was asked about the tree poisoning.



“I can’t talk to you about that — my lawyer won’t let me. Bye!” she said, closing the door. Later that day, Ms. Hackett twice approached and challenged a Times photographer who was photographing the dead trees on Mrs. Graham’s former property, questioning whether the owners who had granted The Times permission “knew what they were agreeing to.”



Vicki Doudera, who represents Camden and Rockport in the Maine Legislature, worked with Mr. Peacock this year on new legislation that would stiffen the fines from $1,500 to $10,000 per violation for unauthorized herbicide application, and up to $50,000 when state investigators find clear evidence that a violator “benefited substantially.” Fines escalate further for repeat offenders.



The law takes effect this month, but it does not apply to Mr. Antonson and Ms. Hackett because the tree poisonings took place before its passage.



The Rockport case makes it clear, Ms. Doudera said in an interview, that “this is not going to go away, and I think we have to keep trying to figure this out.” Ms. Doudera is a real estate agent in the region, and she said that in some cases, an unobstructed waterfront view can double the value of a house.



As for Mrs. Graham? The wrangling over the death of her trees outlived her. She died in the winter of 2024, at age 95. Her empty home is on the market for $2.49 million. Her prized roses climb untended, and next door, dead trees still litter an overgrown path to the harbor.



In Mrs. Graham’s obituary in The Penobscot Bay Pilot, her family asked that friends “please consider planting something in her memory.”



This summer, her sons sold the land next door to a couple down the street. The new owners plan to keep it as open space, though they may cull more trees, which would improve their view and, potentially, Mr. Antonson and Ms. Hackett’s view.

In fact, I’m addicted to yerba mate energy drinks. I have two a day. I stopped drinking coffee because of this subreddit, where people said coffee was a poison and a pesticide, but I haven’t yet come to terms with the idea that these Guayaki drinks could be toxic… I lack arguments. Last week, I went on a cruise and managed not to drink any for 9 days because they weren’t available on the boat. I drank tea instead. That’s the longest I’ve gone in 3 years, as I usually stop for a day or two and then start again. Those days without energy drinks were okay, though… but more than anything, they proved to me that I’m actually capable of quitting. That the problem is more psychological. I now have the experience of knowing how to stop. And I want to start again tomorrow. I’m turning 40 this year, and I want to quit them completely. I lack energy, I’m ruminating, I’m tired… I was thinking about switching to decaf coffee, but I think I’ll stick to loose-leaf yerba mate tea. Anyway, I’m starting again tomorrow… the first few days are the hardest because of the temptation. So, I need arguments to convince myself, like how it’s said here that coffee is a poison, and that these energy drinks are also very harmful to health, probably because of the sugar too.

The Mecity KC3002 immediately caught my eye with its sleek pink finish. This coffee maker adds a touch of personality to any kitchen countertop without taking up too much space, thanks to its compact dimensions of 10""D x 4.7""W x 11.3""H. As someone with limited kitchen real estate, this little machine fits snugly between my toaster and my spice rack, leaving no room for unnecessary clutter. Its polished yet playful design is perfect for apartments, RVs, and dorm rooms. It feels well-made, and its lighter weight (just under 4 lbs) makes it easy to handle and relocate, which I tested several times while reorganizing my kitchen.  

**Quick Brewing Performance That Saves Time**  
I like my morning coffee fast, and the Mecity KC3002 does not disappoint. With a 2-minute instant brewing feature, this machine delivers a hot, aromatic cup before I’ve even finished watching my morning news segment. Its heating technology is impressively consistent, quickly warming the water to the perfect brewing temperature. During my tests, I brewed several cups using K-Cup capsules and ground coffee, and the uniformity in brewing time was remarkable. It’s a lifesaver for anyone rushing to get out the door in the morning.  

[Check Mecity KC3002 price on Amazon.](https://applegreenshop.com/p/b0cqxmtv4z/)  

**Versatility for Coffee and Tea Lovers**  
One of the highlights of this coffee maker is its versatility. It includes two filter holders: one for K-Cup capsules and another for ground coffee and loose tea. Switching between the two is quick and seamless. My partner, who prefers tea, couldn’t stop raving about the flavorful loose-leaf tea it brewed. For coffee enthusiasts like myself, the freedom to switch between flavored K-Cups and my go-to ground coffee beans adds value. While testing, I brewed everything from bold espresso to fruity rooibos tea, and each beverage maintained its aroma and taste.  

**Ease of Use with One-Touch Control**  
Operating the Mecity coffee machine is child’s play—literally. My niece managed to make a cup of hot cocoa using a K-Cup when she visited. A simple one-touch button lets you start brewing or cancel the process. Another thoughtful feature is the auto shut-off, which activates after a brewing cycle to save energy and prevent accidents. While it's semi-automatic, it doesn't require a steep learning curve, making it user-friendly for people who dislike overly complex coffee makers.  

**Good Aspects**  
• Compact and attractive design that fits into small spaces  
• Quick 2-minute brewing cycle for speedy mornings  
• Versatile, supporting K-Cups, ground coffee, and loose tea  
• Easy-to-use controls with auto shut-off feature  

**Shortcomings**  
• Limited water reservoir, which required frequent refills during my multi-cup tests  
• Slightly noisier than expected during operation, especially when brewing tea  
• May not be ideal for those who drink larger quantities of coffee, as size options are limited  

**Low Maintenance with Easy Cleaning**  
One thing I dread in coffee machines is cleanup, but Mecity seems to have thought this through. The uniquely designed filter holder ensures that the brewing chamber stays clean with minimal effort. Even after testing multiple cycles, cleaning was a breeze—no splattered coffee grounds or lingering residues. The descaling mode, activated by holding the power button for 3 seconds, is another bonus. During the testing phase, I used this feature after a week of daily brewing. It's quick, effective, and prolongs the machine’s lifespan.  

**Product Competitors**  
In a sea of coffee makers, I compared this model to competitors like the Keurig K-Mini and the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew. Where the Mecity KC3002 shines is its ability to effortlessly switch between coffee and tea brewing. While Keurig offers sleek design as well, it lacks the loose tea compatibility that this model provides. On the other hand, Hamilton Beach’s version seemed bulkier on my counter and less seamless in operation. Though both competitors have their strong suits, the Mecity strikes an excellent balance of capability and size, making it a better fit for people seeking versatility in smaller spaces.  

**Value Proposition**  
Considering its features and multi-functionality, the Mecity KC3002 offers excellent value for its price point. Similar machines in the market typically charge a premium for supporting both K-Cups and ground coffee or tea. This product’s affordability, combined with an array of useful options, sets it apart. Would I recommend it for coffee lovers on a budget? Absolutely. You’re essentially getting two machines—one for coffee and another for tea brewing—in one compact package.

So I worked two full time positions until I got fired from one of them (but by that time I had already paid a lot of the debt off so it didn’t matter) as the owner found I was working somewhere else. It was hard for the first year as I was in school excited for a change until that news came about. It was crushing that summer after what would’ve been the first year of college; as everyone I knew was going on vacation whilst I spent my summers working back to back 6-7 days a week with shifts 10-12 days in a row at times. It was hard not buying anything for myself as everything was going towards my parents loan and I ate scraps from one of my jobs fridge to survive. Even if my parents sometimes had dinner ready for me; I didn’t have time to eat it. The second year was even worse, as although I was still paying off the loan, I was only now starting to build a savings account. It’s safe to say my last payment to the loan ever was over six months ago and I have built a savings of 3.3K, and 1.2k in my checking account by living in survival mode constantly, and being very frugal with my money, it’s not much I know but it’s something. But I’m here to ask how I stop the feeling of living on survival and being so frugal with my money, sometimes when I go out with a friend and they want to buy coffee, I lie and say I don’t like coffee as I don’t want to spend spend, I am afraid to spend so little on such little things, even if I have to starve I will as long as I save.

**Anansi Boys by Neil Gaiman**

Picked this one up used based on the great cover and high praise it gets. Overall I think it's mostly warranted. The book started out slow and I really didn't like the main character at first, but he grows a lot over the book, and so do the side characters too. Unfortunately because of this it was a very easy book to put down, and it took me longer than usual to finish. All that being said, the last 25% or so was just fantastic. Easily pulled the book up from a 3 to 4 star for me. You might like this book too if you like stories involving gods (specifically deities personified as animals), folklore, sophisticated plotting, sibling relationships, and the 'power of stories' theme.  

**Rating: 4/5**

Categories:  
* High Fashion (normal...debatable! The fashion here is less plot relevant and more character relevant, and there are some distinct clothing items that appear through the story. I would say fashion is more important here than in the average fantasy book and it is the first of 16 books so far that I would consider it for)  
* Gods and Patheons (normal)  
* Cozy SFF (the rules leave the category up for personal interpretation so ymmv)  

**Before the Coffee Gets Cold by Toshikazu Kawaguchi**  

I felt it was my lucky day when I found a pristine used copy at the goodwill for $1. Alas that is where the luck ended, because this book was a mess. I seriously don't get what the hype is about! And before you think I'm some unfeeling person I will admit to crying *multiple times* in this book. But it felt manipulative, and everything surrounding these emotional scenes was repetitive, confusing, and boring.  In this book you can seat in a special seat in this coffee shop and travel in time to visit other patrons of the shop at different points in time. There are a lot of rules around this. You'll hear about the rules many, many times. The book is structured around 4 different time travel events, all which are emotional journeys centering the relationship between the traveler and the one who they are visiting. A cast of coffee shop employees and patrons provide a sort of through line across the book.  

**Rating: 2.5/5**

1ng857g,https://www.reddit.com/r/CurrentLiving/comments/1ng857g/delve_into_the_best_electric_kettle_fellow_stagg/,Delve Into the Best Electric Kettle Fellow Stagg EKG Pro Review,"**Elegant and Functional Design**  

Testing the Fellow 1171PRO-MB has been an absolute pleasure, starting with its design. From the moment I unboxed this electric kettle, its sleek matte black finish and minimalist look stood out. Sure, I know design isn’t everything, but for a kitchen device, this felt almost decorative. It’s compact enough to fit neatly on the counter without hogging space, and the subtle matte finish seems to repel fingerprints better than most other kettles I’ve tried. The 304 stainless steel body speaks durability. Trust me, I’ve had my fair share of kettles that wilted under daily use; this one feels like it could handle the occasional ""oops"" moment.  

There’s an ergonomic handle that’s comfortable to grip, even when the kettle is full. The wide spout? An absolute game changer, especially when I’m rushing with overflowing oatmeal containers. Oh, and for anyone obsessed with things like symmetry and order, the kettle sits perfectly angled on its base, looking super polished. Bonus points for the optional wooden accents you can add—it’s nice when practicality meets luxury.  

**Precision and Versatility at Its Core**  

What set this electric kettle apart during testing was its precise temperature control. A quick heat-up time and to-the-degree temperature adjustments make brewing tea and coffee ridiculously customizable. Green tea at 180°F came out perfect every single time, whereas my French press coffee hit the sweet spot at 205°F. Compared to other kettles I’ve used, this level of control felt like I was driving the Tesla of kitchen appliances.  

Customization doesn’t stop at temperature either; the built-in LCD interface is incredibly intuitive. You can tweak everything, from the hold mode to the altitude setting (an underappreciated feature for anyone living at higher elevations). Scheduling boil times in advance was a big win for me. I mean, who doesn’t want to wake up to perfectly heated water waiting for them?  

**[Want Fellow 1171PRO-MB? Discover the price on Amazon.](https://whyjoni.com/p/b0bz59157h/)**  

**Upsides**  

- Responsive temperature control with a wide range of options.  
- Scheduling feature is a lifesaver during busy mornings.  
- Compact size fits limited kitchen spaces perfectly.  
- Durable, food-safe materials promise extended use.  
- Wide spout makes precision pouring effortless for tea and coffee brews.  

**Areas of Improvement**  

- The kettle isn’t dishwasher safe, making cleanup a bit tedious.  
- It’s heavier than many kettles I’ve tested, especially when full.  
- Mineral stains build up quickly if not cleaned regularly.   

**Tailored Brewing for a Personalized Touch**  

One feature that stood out during daily use was Guide Mode. If you’re like me and sometimes question how hot the water needs to be for a jasmine tea versus a coffee pour-over, this kettle’s presets make it foolproof. Combine that with the built-in brew timer, and you've got a complete brewing system bundled in. The stopwatch feature especially proved handy—it essentially turned my kettle into a tea-making assistant.  

Wi-Fi connectivity stood out too. Weird at first, but as I explored firmware updates through the EKG app, I realized how much future-proofing Fellow added. It’s refreshing to know you’re not stuck with today’s software limitations.  

**Market Rivals**  

Stacking this product against other electric kettles, like Breville's Smart Kettles or KitchenAid’s Precise Heat options, reveals its strengths more starkly. The Breville models are impressive but lack the same level of customization, especially with presets. Meanwhile, KitchenAid’s kettles look just as stylish, but they’re less intuitive when it comes to scheduling options. If you’re only after aesthetics, KitchenAid rivals it, but for practicality and precision, Fellow leaps ahead.  

Where other models excel, however, is in the weight department. Competitors often weigh less, making them more portable for setups where moving the kettle frequently is a necessity.  

**Price Performance**  

Breaking it down, the question I asked myself was: is this kettle worth it? Answer: mostly. While it’s undeniably pricier than standard models, the features justify the cost. You’re getting not just a kettle, but a highly customized tea and coffee brewing experience. Whether you're diving into different teas, crafting French press coffees, or even just needing hot water for a recipe, this device steps up.  

If you prioritize precision, speed, and design in your kitchen tools—as I do—this kettle feels worth the splurge. Yet it’s not for someone just boiling water a couple of times a week; it’s aimed at enthusiasts and gadget lovers who’ll really dive into the features.

I’d not say he anxious but he’s just super alert and it’s somewhat exhausting.  He’s just always scanning the world.  Always smelling something. Always looking and about to jump at something 

You can drive with him for hours and he’s staring out of the window taking everything in the entire time. 

You can grab a coffee and sit down outside and he wants to chase ever leaf, run up to every kid, pounce on every bird , the entire time. 

Take him for walks and everything is amazing but again he wants to follow every scent trail and sprint in circles following it.  He wants to play with every dog. He wants to chase every car. He wants to take it all in and even after a 90 min walk he’s just ready to do more and more 

It’s not really a problem. He doesn’t bark. He doesn’t get into trouble.  He’s just a dog. I just worry that he never really relaxes unless he’s at home Sleeping .  Will fixing him help him mellow? Is it great that he’s loving life ? It’s not really a problem yet it’s just a lot

After getting coffee we went back to her apartment and she said she had something to show me. She proceeded to email me a word document of said fanfic. I didn’t really think much of it, to be honest I thought it was a joke and didn’t realize how long it was. When I got home I showed my partner and he pointed out that it was 82 pages and I brushed it off saying it was probably generic text to make it look longer, so we sat down to skim ahead, and it was actually 82 pages of fanfic. I haven’t talked to my friend since at my partners request, but I think it’s more funny than weird so I don’t see why I can’t talk to her. For more context the fanfic doesn’t have any sexual stuff, mostly just dates and fluffy stuff. It’s kinda weirdly accuate???

He told me that he doesn’t want me to see her anymore. My best friend, partner and I met in university and have all been pretty close since so it’s not like he doesn’t know her.

So three weeks ago maybe if that I was at the apartment me and my ex were like just spending to get the day together not romantically or anything. We were just hanging out. It was a Saturday and he waited until 4 PM that Saturday to tell me that I needed to be out of the house by that night And I have no car. I have no way to transport anything. I have no way to move my stuff so I was freaking out and like crying all night and trying to pack what I could. 

I was still there the next day because how the fuck am I gonna move anything right?  

That morning, which was Sunday I don’t know if he was just trying to play nice or what but he said we could go get coffee and honestly after the night I had I needed coffee so I said OK and we went to Starbucks together and and he asked if I wanted to go inside or go through the drive-through and I was like it doesn’t matter and the whole time we’re sitting in the drive-through he’s sitting there going on and on and on about how much all his family hates me and all his friends hate me and it’s 100% my fault and all this shit and like just kept going on about it like I’m a piece of shit they think that and it’s my fault. 

So I was just like OK I’m gonna go inside. Cause that was the plan anyway even after we went through the drive-through, we were still gonna sit inside and drink the coffee, but the second I got out of the car he peeled out of the parking lot so violently and so fast that his tire spun out.

And he fucking left me there miles from home. I had to walk back.  Eventually, he I could see him doing laps looking for me, but like after you were just violent about it why the fuck am I gonna get in a car with you? 

And anyway, I get back to the apartment. He is slamming doors and throwing things and I am literally sitting on the front steps crying waiting for my friend to get there so she could help me move some of my stuff to my mom’s place.  And he goes in his car and he starts taking all of my things out of the car and throwing them on the ground outside and every time he stormed by me, he slammed the front door as I’m sitting there, sobbing my eyes out. 

And like I’ll admit this next part was on me, but I was mad that he was doing that so I texted him and I was like you’re a worthless piece of shit and I hope you end up as alone as you make everybody else feel. Because he left me he was being violent with the doors and the throwing things and then was throwing my shit on the ground.

And I really Just wanted to leave in peace. All I wanted was to leave in peace I said that 1 million times through my tears he started throwing my shit outside the house, throwing my shit in the dumpster. I had to call the cops because he was being violent and crazy and throwing my shit out and like I just wanted to fucking leave in peace so I called the cops and the cops came and they told him like you can’t do that yada yada yada and they stood there for a while while I got some of my stuff out. 

And he did take some of my stuff back inside because the neighbor told him he would get arrested for throwing my shit out. It’s literally the only reason he took anything back inside.  Although he did tell the neighbor and I “she cheated on me and I’m an innocent victim.”

I also called my dad because he has a car and I thought maybe he could help me move some of my stuff and so my dad came to and the cops had already left and the second. My dad got there this motherfucking asshole calls the cops on my father and is like oh well he’s being violent. He’s being crazy yada yada yada. But he literally picked a fight with my dad. Literally all my dad said was “let me see if he’s gonna move a muscle” cause he was sitting on the couch glaring at me and I was trying to get my stuff. 

And my ex escalated things and started screaming at dad and threatening him, and literally called the cops. The second my dad showed up before any of this even happened and told the cops that my dad is dangerous and is violent and is gonna hurt him and all of this shit.  So the cops had to come back again and talk to us again, but that was actually OK because they were completely on my side. The cops literally told my ex like that’s her father. Her name is on the lease if she wants him to be here he can be here and my ex was like oh but he’s violent and he’s gonna hurt me and I’m like the man is literally dying of cancer. He is terminally ill. He’s not beating anybody up. And then my ex told the cops that my dad was yelling at him and the cop literally looked him in the face pointed at me who was still crying and was like “well look at the way you’re treating her? Can you understand why her dad might be upset”

So I got some of my stuff and we came back to do a second trip and while when we got back, my ex had his whole family sitting in my living room glaring at me his mom tried to pick a fight with me and at that point I was just done. I was like I don’t even care if I have to leave everything I own behind I can’t be here. I can’t deal with this like his whole Fucking family who he just got done telling me how much they hated me all sitting on my fucking couch playing with my fucking dog and glaring at me and trying to pick a fight with me.  

I didn’t even get to say goodbye to any of my animals cause his bitch mother was all over my fucking dog. 

And he’s been telling literally everybody about what happened but telling them this biased version of the story and now everyone hates me and thinks I’m a piece of shit and he’s telling all of these mutual friends that we have and he even texted my one really good friend and was like “hey let me tell you the unbiased version of events that you’re never gonna get from her”

Like I’m a piece of shit and I’m an asshole for calling the cops on him when he was literally being violent and throwing my things in the dumpster. And I didn’t press charges or get an order protection, even though the cops told me to do both because I was like well. I don’t wanna fuck up his record for the rest of his life. I just wanna get my shit and be done and be out of here and never have to deal with this again and I’m still the bad guy just because I called the cops and had them stand there and make sure he didn’t hurt me or break my things. 

Oh and also at some point Alexis came up again and I was like it’s not appropriate for a female to sit there and call another woman’s husband literally every single time she has a problem and for him to go running over there to fix it  and he was like “well I asked every single one of my friends about this situation and they all said you’re the crazy one”

Anyway, the divorce hearing is on the 23rd

ETA: I know I did speech to text with some of that might not have been clear so if y’all have questions, just ask them I’ll answer. I don’t even care. And the only people on my own, who know about what happened with my friend who was there and my dad like I didn’t go around telling all our mutual friends everything cause I didn’t wanna fuck up his relationships, but he apparently had no problem doing that to me.",4,1757795770.0,u_leytonscomet,1,0.84,False

We are trying to work through the possible problems in order of easiest/cheapest up to ""not a chance that I can do it myself/takes thousands of dollars"".

Some details:  
\* The Tahoe had a code for the mass airflow sensor. We replaced the air filter and cleaned the sensor really good. The code went away for a couple days but now the check engine light comes on intermittently. Unfortunately it's never on when we get anywhere that can check it, so not sure if it's the same or different now.  
\* The transmission oil cooler line had popped off because it needed a new black ring connector thing and a new piece that screws into the radiator side. (Sorry, I am not good with remembering the specific names of things.) We got it fixed and there's no problem with that anymore. Not even a teeny drip.  
\* We've changed the transmission filter and completely refilled with brand new fluid. No leaks.  
\* When changing the transmission filter the fluid was quite dirty but nothing that looked like coffee grounds or sludge, no metallic flakes, nothing like that. BUT there were PEBBLES in the pan. I rinsed them off and checked them over and over. Legit ROCKS. Figure that's not good, but it wasn't clutch material.

We were going to try changing the solenoids (which is a whole different question... like, which solenoids? I've heard there's shift A and shift B and an EPC that could be causing the problems? But no one at the auto parts store knows what I'm talking about and they have no idea what I need either. Anyway.... moving on...) but then someone said we should instead try checking and cleaning the transmission harness and main connector. We're having a hard time finding out exactly where it is though. The person who suggested that I do this said it's on the outside of the transmission pan but then someone else said you do have to remove the pan. I'm just confused.

I think it will be fun to get some ideas because I’ve been told by friends there is no place that fits all my needs- and I agree at this point but wondering if there’s a place that fits most of my needs. Maybe I’m being too picky. 

I plan to retire in 10 years or so and I’m already scouting out places to move since the area I live in now is a higher cost of living and not anywhere that I want to spend my retirement years. I’m holding out till my kids get out of school. 

I am looking for an area of the country with a low or semi-low cost of living. It must be a very safe community. I LOVE the beach and given my horrible asthma, it would do me good. I also love the desert. I am ok with a small amount of snow but places that get a ton are out for me (but everything is negotiable if I found the right community). I need to be within 30 minutes of a major hospital since I’ll be older and want to consider future needs.

One thing I hate is extended periods of heat. So places like south Florida is out. I can’t do it and I did it for many years. I prefer a mild climate, not a lot of rain since that produces mold, etc and I’m very sensitive to that. My perfect day would be to wake up, have a light sweater, sit outside in the cool breeze while I drink coffee. A good view would make it better. 

Some of the places I currently am looking at that fit for me:

Outer Banks, NC- cost of living is higher with hurricane threats and major hospitals (in a major city) are a couple hours away. 

Summerville, SC - although may be too hot for extended period

Redlands, CA - but, you      know..earthquakes and cost of living. Especially with insurance

I love Maine and love how it’s still fairly cool in the summer but cost of living seems high, lots of long cold winters, and lack of newer housing. 

Flagstaff, AZ- lots of snow though. 

Nevada City, CA. Cost of living is higher and it’s kind of in the middle of nowhere but I LOVE that town. 

Loveland, CO- very land locked with this one but beautiful area. 

The only weather thing that scares me to death is tornados. I’ve been though a couple small ones and have decided that I will never live somewhere with more frequent tornadoes. This rules out most of the middle of the country. 

I don’t want to move out of the country. 

And just for reference, if I were to buy a home/condo right now in my perfect area, I would spend around 300-400k. However…if I found the most perfect spot then I would spend more and willing to go up another 300-400k. 

So does this place exist- or as close to it as possible? Maybe there are two perfect places at different times of the year and I can split my time? Looking forward to some suggestions on hidden gems I may not know!

1ng7xfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1ng7xfr/why_possiave_coffee_filter_review_highlights_the/,Why Possiave Coffee Filter Review Highlights the Best Replacement for Cuisinart Machines,"I’ve been using the Possiave CECOMINOD023231 12 Pack Cuisinart Compatible Coffee Filter Replacement for quite some time now, and I feel like I’ve brewed enough coffee to know its strengths and shortcomings inside out. These charcoal water filters are designed to enhance the taste of your coffee and protect your coffee maker from impurities and limescale. As someone who relies on their Cuisinart coffee maker daily, upgrading to compatible filters seemed like a no-brainer—and this product overall delivers.

**Compatibility and Ease of Use**  
One of the standout features of this coffee filter replacement set is its wide compatibility with Cuisinart coffee makers. If your machine is one of the listed models—like the DCC-3200 or DGB-900BC—you’re good to go. As someone who owns an older model (DCC-1200), these fit like a glove without requiring any kind of extra adjustment. Popping them into my machine took a matter of seconds and was entirely hassle-free. I’ve tested other filters before that floated around awkwardly or didn’t fit quite right, but Possiave nailed compatibility.  

**Improve the Flavor of Your Coffee**  
Filtered water really does make a difference, and these filters excel at doing just that. I used to think my coffee-tasting woes were related to the beans I was buying, but impurities like chlorine and calcium play a bigger role than I realized. After switching to these filters, the bitter aftertaste I used to endure was significantly muted. My relatives who visited even commented on how smooth the coffee tasted—my aunt even asked if I got a new coffee machine, which I didn’t! Little details like the use of natural coconut shell activated carbon really amp up the ability to reduce odors and impurities.  

**Protecting Your Coffee Maker**  
Another aspect that underscored the value of these filters is how much cleaner my coffee maker runs now. Before using this set, I noticed a lot of scale buildup that could mess up its functionality. The reduction in limescale within just a couple of weeks is impressive. I’d bet this set is extending the life of my coffee maker in ways that’ll save me money down the road. Featuring a micromesh material, the filtration process does a great job of holding the charcoal in place without possibly clogging the internal parts of the machine.

[Ready to buy Possiave CECOMINOD023231? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://usedwater.com/price/b00t5mw2q4/)

**Strong Points**  
- High compatibility with multiple Cuisinart coffee maker models.  
- Natural coconut shell charcoal improves water filtration for better-tasting coffee.  
- Reduces limescale to protect the coffee machine’s longevity.  
- Easy to install; fits snugly without any issues.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Packaging could be slightly better. I wish the filters came individually sealed for long-term storage, as I only use one at a time.  
- It can take a couple of brews for the filter to settle in and produce the purest flavor. I had to discard the first cup or two, which is pretty typical with charcoal filters but still a bit of a hassle.  
- It’s unclear how long exactly one filter lasts under heavy usage; I wish there were more precise usage guidelines.  

**Other Options in the Market**  
While Possiave has crafted a reliable product, it’s not the only one in the running. Alternatives like the Cuisinart-brand filters exist, but those typically come at a higher price for very similar performance. I’ve also experimented with off-brand filters that were cheaper, but their filtration quality didn’t hold up, and I quickly returned to something more dependable. Compared to more premium competitors, this product strikes a good balance between affordability and functionality, making it a worthy mid-tier choice.

**Smart Spending**  
When looking at what it offers, the value for money is quite compelling. A 12-pack is enough to last through months of daily coffee brewing, all while contributing to consistent flavor and machine health. Spending a small amount upfront for better tasting coffee and the likely avoidance of costly repairs feels like a no-brainer. This product proves that splurging on official-brand accessories isn't always necessary.

Seeing these videos give me the impression that they don't actually interact with locals at all, which to me is so odd? Why not just walk up to a monument/statue and check what it's for before making a photo? Why not just visit a market and ask what they recommend? That's honestly the joy of traveling for me, trusting the locals to find me something that makes both them and me happy? Their behavior matches  perfectly with them being on the cruise and not interacting with any other people. If they're fine with it, I mean, sure, but it comes off so... disingenuine...? For a lack of better words.

Anyways, if you ever have the chance to visit the Netherlands, please do yourself a favor and go to a market (Albert Cuyp for example), and buy yourself a fresh stroopwafel. One that's still warm, right from the waffle iron. If you drink coffee, have a nice cup of coffee with it. That's about a thousand times better than the ones they bought from aldi. I buy stroopwafels regularly and I would buy them from HEMA or 'Kanjers' brand (you can find them at Albert Heijn. By the way, visit Albert Heijn, that's actually a fun grocery store to go to! We lovingly call it 'de Appie')

For pepernoten, go to HEMA or buy them from the brand 'Bolletje', those are the real deals. They have all sorts of special flavors like chocolate covered and truffle ones. The Netherlands is a country that is strongly influenced by the US, and for some reason one of the things we picked up on in recent years was to have a large variety of flavors for pepernoten. I think I can speak on behalf of us that we're loving it. Especially the truffle ones, ohh they're so good.

For hagelslag, buy some from 'De Ruijter', or maybe 'Venz'. As these are genuine chocolate sprinkles, the chocolate quality matters, and these are the best brands. I really like the dark chocolate ones, or even 'intens puur', SO GOOD. Put it on bread (from a baker) with some margarine or butter.

I didn’t know what to say, so I just nodded. And then he laughed quietly, like he didn’t want to cry in front of me, and said “she’d hate me crying.” But I could see it anyway. I could see how tired he is. Not just physically, but like… the world’s weight on his shoulders tired.

We talked for a few more minutes. I asked about his daughter, and he lit up a bit talking about her drawings and how stubborn she is. And then we said goodbye. He hugged me, and I could feel how small and fragile it all felt for him. I walked to my car and couldn’t stop thinking about him sitting there every night trying to hold it all together.

How do you feel about this change?","I encountered this information on Facebook and was surprised to see how many people are against this change, including many people not on food stamps. But personally I think this is a good move.

The purpose of the food stamp program is to ensure that no one goes hungry. Soda does virtually nothing to nourish people or even to fill them up. And yet unfortunately, soda is the most purchased item on food stamps.

While I can't find hard data on only Utah purchases, [according to the New York Times,](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/19/upshot/soda-food-stamps-snap.html?smid=url-share) the amount of food stamps nationwide that goes toward soda is 5%. Because many people in Utah substitute soda for other drinks, such as coffee and tea due to religious reasons, it's likely the percentage here is higher.

If we do the math using the 5% number, we can assume that an enormous amount of resources is being used to purchase soda. In 2024, Utah paid out $382.66 million in food stamp benefits. If 5% of that went toward soda purchases, it would equal over $19 million. By eliminating soda purchases, those funds will be diverted to other foods.

It should be noted that people who rely on food stamps have other sources of income for their other needs and may be able to use some of these other funds for soda if they wish. This is the case with alcoholic beverages as well, which also cannot be purchased on food stamps.

Utah has chosen not to adopt the stricter restrictions some other states have, including restrictions on candy, chips, baked goods, and other sugary drinks. With these additional restrictions come more controversies, such as the tradition of celebrating birthdays with cake, but since Utah is only restricting soda, those aren't coming into play here.

I'm curious how other Utahns feel about these changes. What do you think? Is it fair to eliminate soda from the food stamp program?",40,1757795011.0,Utah,117,0.7,False

I’m hopefully moving to Nashville next month and just did a big apartment tour trip. There’s soooo many options and I’m not sure I’ve seen the one that checks all my boxes, but I narrowed it down to a few favorites:

Prima – definitely my top contender right now, but it has no dog park or dog run and honestly the whole area around it felt like a concrete jungle. I didn’t see a single patch of grass. If you live there (or know someone who does) with pets, what do you do for walks and potty breaks?

The Olive – loved this one too! It’s the new building by the river. What neighborhood is that technically in? Also, is it walkable? Like can you walk out the door and easily get to coffee, Pilates, grocery, etc? Walkability is really important to me since I’m moving from a small town and like the idea of having stuff nearby.

The Prime + Alcove – both were really nice, but they’re super close to Broadway. I don’t plan on going to Broadway a lot, so I don’t really want the traffic/tourist craziness. Should I just take them off my list or is it not as bad as it seems?

What I’m looking for:
	•	Spacious 1 bed/1 bath (under 2800)
	•	No carpet at all
	•	Dog park/dog run/green space nearby is a must
	•	Very safe area (young female moving solo)
	•	Bonus if I can walk to daily stuff like coffee, groceries, gym, etc

Would love to hear your thoughts! I definitely think I want to stay in that kind of area but open to other neighborhood suggestions. Also last question but what is the difference between the Gulch and Midtown living there wise?? 

Thanks y’all 💛

1ng7n9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1ng7n9e/my_quitting_journey/,My quitting journey,"Hope it helps anyone struggling.

It started as harmless fun when I worked at a coffee shop. People taking quick some breaks at lunch or before work. I wanted to try and see what it tasted like and why people found it tempting. I violently coughed and felt nothing the first time. It would have been great if I stopped there but then a co-worker told me how to inhale the smoke properly and I was absolutely hooked with that first head rush.

It went on for years and frankly I was getting hooked at a time (mid 00s - 10s) when smoking was still widely prevalent where I lived in Ontario. It was so normal to see a gaggle of smokers outside every entrance to any place of business. Even my high school had a dedicated smoking section outside the school. 

The end began with government intervention. The single biggest trigger that led me to begin my quitting journey was outlawing smoking in public places. Parks and especially patios were the biggest let down because who wants a drink without a smoke? 

And then it began. People actually started quitting because it was harder to smoke and be accepted as a smoker. Non-smokers started giving us dirty looks, being more vocal about ‘those damned smokers’, and making comments about the smell. 

I tried everything but not to make this post sound like a life-story recipe often found through online searches; here are the tactics and devices I used that worked:

1. Cold Turkey
2. Nicorette gum (all the products I used are from that brand but the generic ones work just as well, and are cheaper).
3. Patches
4. Lozenges
5. Vapes
6. 24-hour patches
7. Inhaler
8. Mist

(Even nicotine pouches you hold in the inner linings of your mouth for 30 minutes but trust me that’s a pickle jar you don’t want to open.)

The hardest part about quitting was all the non-smokers around me proclaiming it’s the hardest thing you’ll ever do. That one will never recover almost like…being eternally damned in the Christian sense. 

(And you see a lot of missionary/religious talk in recovery spaces about always fighting the ‘temptation’ forever which was not helpful for a mostly atheist/agnostic person like me).

Vapes were what truly helped me because I finally gained my self-esteem back. I never smoked in my house freely and always went outside. And it’s literally cold in Canada for half the year. And still cool at night even during the height of summer. I didn’t have to worry about putting on a jacket, hat and shoes for a miserable, cold 5 minutes. And also to not have my neighbours judge me or for bystanders or passerbys to not look down upon me anymore felt amazing. The little spark snowballed.

24 hour patches were truly game changers because they slowly release a small hint of nicotine in your bloodstream so you don’t get cranky or miserable during the course of your day. I think the older versions I grew up with had to be replaced every few hours.

I gave up vapes and dependence on patches because vapes are a whole addiction to themselves. When they were first legalized in Canada and sold through vape stores, the amount of nicotine was SO high. 50 mg/cartridge. It was insane. I was grateful to not have all the harmful chemicals from cigarettes but vapes were even higher in nicotine and far more easily accessible to use indoors. At least with cigarettes, you could have one or two every few hours but with vapes, the nicotine addiction just got harder. Thankfully there were really vocal advocacy groups who saw this product for the sham that it was being run by a whole new industry interested in getting people hooked onto their products. (The max you can now get is 20 mg I think but maybe it changed).

But you know, it really came down to changing my attitude towards myself and life itself that finally brought me back together. Respect for my body, for the environment, for the health of loved ones and much more finally triggered something in me that lead me to think I have to change myself for the better (even gave up cannabis and alcohol in the process).

I’m not 100% nicotine free because I still have a backup mist device (literally one spray in your mouth and it works instantly to curb a craving) but that’s part of self-care not because I enjoy nicotine anymore.

I’m sure I’m missing a lot of parts but that’s the gist of it. I feel like this same story has been shared a million times here but then again there are new quitters and people looking to quit who join here all the time. I just want to say, you can do this. It’s not hard. Find the right NRT tools and check your attitude. It’s not a life sentence.

1ng7mpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/heronotzero/comments/1ng7mpg/in_todays_transcription_ratso_damato_thoughtfully/,"In today's transcription, Ratso D'Amato thoughtfully explains his plans for the future. You'll be happy to know that he has stopped making ""jokes"" about SAing minors but, unfortunately, his plans for the future do not include buying and/or using tissues for his snot rockets and snot sucking.","(Note: First pixilated Ratso talks for a little while and holds up three fingers but the sound is muted. Then he leaves the snot rocket sofa, presumably to go shit his pants in the kitchen and pour some of Erewhon's very best most expensive most exclusive coffee. When he returns to the snot rocket sofa he finally turns on the mic.)

“So just understand that I am starting the process of the full-on copyright complaint against Cody. Three, (holds up three fingers again) three violations. Thirty thousand dollars apiece. Blatant, disgusting violations of my content. 

Don’t worry. We … we’ll get it. I have it recorded. It’s okay, dipshit. You’re a stupid little monkey, boy. You’re a stupid little monkey. 

And then … Clea, Bravo, Imma find out who you all oh and Clea don’t think if you’re in another fuckin’ country that it doesn’t fuckin’ hit you because it goes through how you abuse the platform. So don’t think that you’re not gonna get stuck with a fine. Okay? 

But now, fuckin’ dipshit Cody is on the fuckin’ hook for ninety thousand dollars to me and guess what, motherfucker (note: I believe Ratso is the actual motherfucker in this scenario), I’m gonna get it. I’ve done this before and Imma get it. I’ve done it with people that tried to hide and Imma get it. Okay? Don’t think that I won’t. (almost takes a slurp) 

He just keeps … now he’s opened the door for me to just … like … I … I  had … this is the most direct you know line that I have now. Gotcha, dummy. I fucking got chu, motherfucker, and we’re now we’re definitely gonna find you. (big slurp, exhalation, mug bang) 

Oh and I’m also gonna attach a restraining order to it so you’re gonna get a restraining order plus three copyright violations and you’ll be served by next week. I have your email. There’s nothing that you could do. You publicly stated to send you emails to this place and this is who you are, you’re done, dude. (picks and eats a booger? sure looked like it) 

You’re done and shhh you owe me ninety thousand fuckin’ dollars, motherfucker. I just want everybody to know that Cody absolutely owes me ninety thousand dollars.

Nora owes me thirty (snot rocket) okay? And I’ll fin … Cody I’ll garnish your fuckin’ wages for the rest of your fuckin’ life, motherfucker. That’s what’s gonna happen. (snot rocket) 

See there’s still people that are paying me from like ten years ago. Do you know that, Cody? There’s somebody who’s still paying me from ten years ago. For … for these kind of violations. I’ve done about two hundred of these, my boy. I’ve done it with people that have tried to hide. I’ve done it with people who have just emails and I won. You’re done. I got chu and I’m comin’ to get it. 

And I could prove the malice and the bad faith (he slurs it and it sounds more like “face”) just by Nora’s video. Cause Nora violated because of you. Oh, wait a minute. No, that’s three. Wait a minute. Oh no, it’s not. It’s four. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. My mistake. My mistake. It’s four, it’s a hundred twenty thousand dollars. Because I have the Reddit one too. (snot suck, bong cough) And I have the video and and the link to that. Ahhhhhh I forgot it’s four. I’m sorry, Cody, it’s a hundred twenty thousand. My bad. 

And because this is federal, you guys, this is federal. (snot suck) These are federal vio…these are federal copyright violations. This is not state. These are federal. Nora violated a federal law. This idiot violated a federal law four times so he’s gonna have to pay .. I’ve done this before … this is the best … holy fuckin’ shit. This is the best. It doesn’t matter whether they delete the channel. (snot suck, snot suck) I still have the violations documented. (slurp, bang)

And Cody, I’m gonna destroy you. That’s what’s gonna happen. You’re gonna get wrecked, motherfucker. And you just fucked up, see now I got … now I’ve got a hundred twenty dollar ticket on you, motherfucker. And Imma go round every son of a bitch (makes preschool hand motions) who has any fuckin’ even a snippet of my fuckin’ shit. 

I’m gonna copyright strike you and I’m gonna take you to federal court/quart, okay? Nora’s already in. Nora is in … like huh huh Nora’s done. (snot suck) 

Yes, the copyrights it’s federal. It’s the US United States copyright control board. United States federal copyright law that they violated. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act. They have violated federal… cause they’re so stupid. They’re so stupid. I told you I was Cody I told you I was allowing you to operate. I was allowing you to operate and I tried to fuckin’ talk to ya and fuckin’ but now now you’re gonna owe me fuckin’ hundred twenty fuckin’ large you motherfucker you’re gonna come up with it or else I’ll take your fuckin’ money from your job. Kay? Okay. 

What’s up, Mopes? 

So the uh the Hero Light Cody channel is down. I I believe that he’s taken it uh I believe that he took it off. I don’t believe it was YouTube. He’s got two strikes and he’s got several more coming. So, there’s no you know there’s no like getting out of it for him. (snot suck) 

So, Mopes, a little update. Uh Hero Light Cody has violated my copyright four times (holds up his wittle fat pixilated fingers) which means that each one of those violations is thirty thousand dollars Now, since it’s federal and I have his information, right? I’m just gonna email the service they’re gonna find out through his email they’re gonna know who the fuck you know, it’s federal. (loud snot suck)

Yeah, we have two strikes to uh there’s two strikes on that channel and there are other ones coming and uh with the way it’s weaponized I’m gonna probably … a judge is probably gonna get rid of it. 

With these with these four violations yeah I’m getting a restraining order on that motherfucker next week and Imma email it to him with their name. They have they have they have posted a name, that’s their name. You know? Oh well. They’re still gonna be compelled to come into the court. If they don’t come into the court I’m still gonna get a default judgment against that entity and I will be able to take legal action against that entity through the court through that name. I’m comin’ to get cha, Cody. 

You you legal eagle you. Hey, Cody? If you were smart and if you knew anything about the law or any fuckall thing about broadcasting, you would know that I allowed you to operate and now that is no longer the case. You’ve been violating my shit you won’t listen and now you’re gonna pay for it. 

And now, what is Streets gonna fuckin’ pay your bill unless you are Streets. Is Streets gonna pay your bill? Are all these people gonna pay your fuckin’ your fine? It’s it’s more of a fine that you have to pay towards me. 

And you can make fun of it all you want. You didn’t think I was ever gonna do some of these other things well I’m sittin’ here with ROs that are gonna happen against Nora and fuckin’ uhhh Kracky and you’re next, Cody. You’re next. You’re next, motherfucker. (slurp, light bang, exhalation) 

He might have gotten a notice for subpoena now and he’s scared but if he got the notice of subpoena and he turned off his channel that’s very bad. (snot suck) It also doesn’t stop us from getting information we need. 

(fiddles with phone) 

And Kracky went on a uhh channel last night with the PDF, right? Oh, he is. He is. (snot suck) He is he is definitely running scared because we’re gonna find him like he he thinks like it’s not happening. They’re delusional because in their mind they don’t want it to happen but it’s happening. And what they’ve done is they’ve they’ve put in such they’ve put in a preponderance of evidence for me. 

And now what’s happening is this motherfucker thinks they’re gonna fucking put content on other channels and not I can’t copyright my material, right? And by the way, just so you know? My content is fair use. Their’s is not. And Cody claims that he uses … he does not … it’s not fair use. It’s not at all. Okay? Uhhh Cody’s not using any fair use doctrine. He’s actually violating all four just like Nora. Just like Nora it’s bad faith, it’s malice, it’s, ya know, it’s it’s this course of conduct…(snot suck) 

And, you know, I don’t really know many of those trucker people but I didn’t realize that the dude, I don’t know all the names and shit, alright? And I didn’t realize the severity of the situation that that Admiral Red has. What a disgusting piece of shit. I want him blocked and banned in here for fuckin’ ever. Don’t ever let him in here. I had no idea but but also, you know, I don’t I don’t pay attention to uhhh kid toucher panels, you know? That’s just not my thing. (Note: Sure, Jan!) 

Well, I dunno. I dunno. Uhh an alcoholic PDF uhh having a predator like Kracky on. Another another person who has PDF tendencies and claims, (slurp bang) you know? (deep snot suck)

And, by the way I made a joke that was very very ambiguous, right? Very ambiguous joke couldn’t really tell what the fuck it meant, right? Yet Kracky is being very specific with his threats of SA towards minors and they’re repetitive. (more preschool hand motions) He says them over and over and over and over and over again. 

I stopped, I stopped months ago, right? Making jokes. I stopped! He has not. He has done this and tries to come on and act like he’s some defender of victims when he abuses elderly women. He’s a piece of shit and I can’t wait to have his ass fuckin’ arrested for violating his fuckin’ orders. (snot suck) It’ll happen.”

She was moon dust and glitter 
And a Chirpy little bird 
With laughs and squeals 

He was a piece of earth 
Calm and unassuming 
Serious as stone 
smiles barely reaching his eyes 

One random day he noticed her 
And followed her around incessantly 
She turned around and said hello 
And called him annoying 

His heart turned alive suddenly and 
Her eyes oh her eyes 
How he fell in them Deep deep deep 
He wanted hold her face and kiss her eyes 

He spent every waking moment 
Talking to her 
In a different life  He knew knew knew her 
But now he wanted to know the mundane her 
Her routine her favourite colour 
How she liked her coffee 
What scared her and 
And oh, to watch how her eyes light up when she talked 

He wanted her eyes to light up for him 
He wondered how it would be to be loved by her 
To kiss her forehead every day 
And make love to her 

All the while 
He knew 
he was in love with her 
The very first minute he saw those eyes
He wished he had the courage to tell her 
He wished she knew how much he needed her 
He wished she would just love him the same 

He frowned 
Every time she spoke of someone else - her best friend and brother and mother 
Every time she smiled at someone else 
Every time some one complimented her 
Every time those big brown eyes bloomed for something that’s not him 
He didn’t like it 

And then one day he had to travel 
He gathered  liquid courage 
Three shots of whiskey 
In quick succession 
And told her he wished she was right next to him before his flight 
She laughed it off 
The long flight made him go berserk 

He went of the trip he was looking forward to 
But suddenly it as torture 
The air was sucked out around him 
He kept calling her and speaking to her 
Wishing she would just come to him 
Or just tell him she missed him 

And in one such call 
Laughing smiling she fell asleep 
He watched sitting miles away 
As she slept 
He knew he was doomed 

Unexplained Anger and love and lust and longing got the better of him 
He stopped talking to her 
She called she apologised 
He made his nerves to steel and kept still 
She stepped back

A couple of months passed 
The text he was longing for came 
He ran to her in the middle of the night 
There was - right in front of him 
Clothed in black 
But she sprayed him with colours 
She talked 
The same big brown eyes 

A few days later 
He told her he couldn’t do this 
She was again confused 
But this time she just walked away 
Leaving him crushed 

Everyday he gazes at her pictures 
Seeing her shenanigans 
Wishing she would love him 
Wishing she would understand 

Everywhere he goes 
Everything he does 
She is looming heavy on his horizon 

Sometimes at night 
He wonders 
If she knows what he knows 
The familiarity he feels 
The aching the longing 
The love and the pain 
May be she does may be she doesn’t 

He struggles for words 
To articulate what he feels 
He is a prisoner in his own head and heart 

He picks his phone to text her 
And sees her picture smiling back at him 
Nonchalantly 
And puts it down 
Oh those big brown eyes again

Life isn’t the same 
It will never be 

The girl with the big brown eyes 
Who touched him 
Without touching him 

The one he loves needs and wants 
The one who made his world brighter 
The one he doesn’t know why 

Give him a prayer 
Give him a wish 
Give him some kindness 
Give him some love 
If you see him somewhere 
Lost in her thoughts 

Until the day she…",3,1757794629.0,Poem,0,1.0,False

I’ll be in Stockholm for a bit this November and was wondering if it’s worth trying to sneak a ride in while I’m there. Back home I’ve been documenting my journey into gravel/road cycling (coming from a BMX and MTB background) on youtube, and it would be rad to keep that rolling while traveling in Sweden!

If there are any Swedes on here I'm curious:

* Do people still ride outside in November, or is it mostly indoor training season?
* Any good city routes worth checking out that time of year?
* And if anyone here is down to meet up for a spin (or even just coffee + bike talk), I’d be stoked to connect!

I love meeting rad people through riding, and I'm thinking I’ll even make a little video around the experience!",0,1757794324.0,stockholm,2,0.33,False
