In this series, we look at how roasters around the world lay out their roasting spaces, select equipment, and setup workflows.

Full breakdown below, but see the [original article here](https://freshcup.com/roastery-breakdown-afterglow-coffee-cooperative-in-richmond-virginia/) for all the pictures of the space and equipment.

P.S. Shoutout to Loring for supporting this series (but we do not only feature roasters that use Loring equipment).

“Are you the owner?” is a common question that well-meaning coffee patrons often ask baristas or managers they see working behind the bar. But what if the people working behind the bar or roaster really *were* the owners of the business? 

That’s the case at [Afterglow Coffee Cooperative](https://www.afterglowcoffee.com/) in Richmond, Virginia. Afterglow made [headlines](https://richmondmagazine.com/restaurants-in-richmond/same-but-different/) as the first worker-owned roastery and cafe in the city when, in 2021, five employees of local favorite [Lamplighter Coffee Roasters](https://www.lamplightercoffee.com/) bought the roastery side of the business and committed to making it a worker-owned cooperative. 

The business, which is split up as a coffee shop in the front and roastery in the back, was one of two Lamplighter locations, operating as its roastery and second cafe. During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, Lamplighter closed the cafe section. Later, the original worker-owners of Afterglow purchased that building and operational setup.

“I hate to say it, but COVID really was the opportunity and the radicalizing push that I think a lot of people needed to make changes in the world,” says Alan Smith, worker-owner and green buyer for Afterglow. 

Smith began as a barista at Lamplighter in 2010, then moved to roasting and green buying around 2014, and was one of the five original owners of Afterglow. “We had decided that if we weren’t able to buy the business that we would just start something independently,” they say.

The co-op began as a group of baristas searching for ways to build a future in a shifting industry. Over time, it has grown into a business where worker-owners are asking tough questions about longevity in a coffee career—questions that many in the profession have, but which are all too often brushed aside.

# Worker-Ownership

Smith says the goal for the cooperative was to create a business that offered a sustainable, long-term career path for coffee workers. “There should not be any job that does not pay a sustainable wage … There’s a reason why people leave coffee, because that system doesn’t exist—the schema where you are a skilled craftsperson leveling up year on year like a tradesperson,” Smith says. 

Being part of the cooperative means being a part-owner of the business. When someone gets hired at Afterglow, they work for a six-month trial period as an hourly barista, so everyone can assess if the fit is right. Once the trial period is over, if everyone feels that that employee should be an owner, they have the choice to opt in. Owners either invest $6,000 upfront or accrue sweat equity through a reduced salary.

Running a business as a cooperative isn’t a one-size-fits-all model. None of Afterglow’s five original co-founders had experience in running a cooperative before—but Smith and the others pitched ideas and worked to create their operating strategy. “We’ve been making it up as we go along, which feels scary but necessary,” Smith admits. “There is not a model that I’m aware of to base this on.”

In the state of Virginia, there is no legal designation for a cooperatively owned business. After consulting with a lawyer who specialized in worker-owner businesses, the team incorporated Afterglow as an [S Corp](https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/s-corp-vs-llc?utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_term=S-corp%20business&utm_content=78615281341862&utm_campaign=SMB%20%7C%20INC%20%7C%20SC%20%7C%20Exact&utm_campaignID=396036092&utm_adgroupID=1257841792849806&utm_partner=bingsearch&b_adgroup=SMB%20%7C%20INC%20%7C%20SC%20%7C%20S%20Corp%20-%20Question%20%7C%20Exact&b_adgroupid=1257841792849806&b_adid=78615281341862&b_campaign=SMB%20%7C%20INC%20%7C%20SC%20%7C%20Exact&b_campaignid=396036092&b_isproduct=&b_productid=&b_term=what%20is%20a%20s%20corporation&b_termid=kwd-78615479039707:loc-4129&msclkid=f820e5fb6df3196467d78d69f4c340e3#what-is-an-s-corp). That type of business structure includes an operating agreement that allows current Afterglow owners to change the number of owners by referendum. 

In many ways, the cooperative works like other coffee companies. Smith says that “the process of consensus-building is easier” because making decisions as a collective is built into the framework of the business. Even if someone isn’t a part-owner, they’re still part of the decision-making process. 

“Consensus is based not on owner decisions, but member decisions, so anyone working here is able to add notes to the agenda meetings, sit in on meetings, make comments on any topic,” Smith says. “Anything that is an actionable item that we vote on and that people need to make an actual decision, you can weigh in on.”

# Equipment Breakdown

[**DR-25 roaster**](https://www.diedrichroasters.com/roasters/dr-25/)**:** At the end of July, the members of Afterglow made the decision to invest their profit shares (the parts of the profit paid out to each owner outside of their salary and operating costs) in upgrading their roaster. They grew from a [DR-12](https://www.diedrichroasters.com/roasters/dr-12/), made by Diedrich Roasters, to a larger model, the DR-25. 

Afterglow had reached the point where “we just can’t roast any more coffee,” Smith says. Along with supplying coffee for its retail space and webstore, the business has a large wholesale program and toll roasts for Lamplighter’s remaining cafe. 

The decision to invest in a new roaster resulted from an exhausting roasting schedule to meet those demands. “Right now, we’re estimating our pars, like hundreds of pounds of each blend, that we roast Thursday, Friday, and Sunday, just to fill Monday,” Smith says. “We were doing 24 hours of work just to meet one single day of production … \[The new machine\] was an absolute necessity.”

Smith says forfeiting the worker-owners’ profit share might seem like a loss, but the decision was made by consensus because the group saw the investment as a way to scale the business. “This new roaster will be like \[an additional\] team member … we can double our output with no extra labor,” Smith says.

**Directionality in the roastery:** Flashy tech gets a lot of attention when talking about roastery operations and efficiency, but not all “tools” are singular products. Recently, Smith instituted a new, unidirectional approach to movement through the roastery. He believes that creating a path for employees and coffee “is smoother and easier to have things move in one direction where possible.”

The path begins with the delivery of coffee at the back of the roastery, after which it moves to the roaster. Once roasted, the coffee is transported via one of two lanes of travel: the manual side, which involves filling and sealing bags, or the automated side, with the weigh-and-fill machine and band sealer.

**Band sealer and weigh-and-fill machines:** Smith knows band sealers, machines that seal coffee bags, and weigh-and-fill machines, which fill bags with a set amount of coffee, are common, but that doesn’t negate how valuable they are at Afterglow. “The weigh-and-fill \[machine\] and band sealer are huge. I know they’re boring, but I did work for a decade with no help in the way of machinery,” Smith says.  

Smith once believed doing all this work by hand—manually scooping and sealing bags of coffee—made the final bag feel more “handcrafted,” but in reality, it just took a toll on the body. “\[It’s\] a scam that I was sold as a baby barista about how things should be,” Smith says of the association between labor and craft. “You are just too young to realize that \[the work\] is stacking up, and when you get into your 30s, you can’t use your shoulder anymore from scooping beans for 10 years.” 

**Back office:** Offices and storage spaces exist in every roastery, but Afterglow repurposed a walk-in fridge into an office and storage space for dry goods. 

Smith joked that the walk-in fridge “was like a studio-apartment-size walk-in,” and far too big for the team’s needs. When the fridge compressor died, the worker-owners agreed to use the already demarcated space as an office and break room with shelves, a fridge, and snacks. 

The black walls and cute windows were constructed out of architectural salvage to match the historic black vestibule at the front of the cafe. 

**Pre-labeled bags:** Earlier this year, Afterglow switched from bags that a person had to manually sticker to pre-printed bags. The pre-printed bags allow workers to spend less time labeling bags and more time on other duties around the roastery.

Worker-owner Allison Maves’ sister, illustrator Rachel Maves, created Afterglow’s newest label design. The labels got a refresh when the roastery swapped its plain black bags for bright blue ones. 

Smith says the team was thrilled with the pre-labeled bags. “The product doesn’t feel like anyone could just print a sticker and make it. It is a fully branded real thing, which feels good.”

# Decision-Making and Profits in the Cooperative

In a cooperative business, profits that might otherwise go to a single owner are shared among the worker-owners. Like any business, revenue first goes toward expenses, maintenance, and payroll; what’s left becomes profit. 

As mentioned above, the worker-owners have decided to use their profit shares for a new roaster, and Smith notes that the owners haven’t distributed profits to themselves yet. “We have yet to distribute profit-share, but we are hoping to do that for the first time this year. I’m still not sure what that scheme will look like.” 

But Smith is hopeful, and the worker owners are pursuing other parts of their vision for the business. Beyond being a cooperative, Afterglow’s overarching mission can be summed up by a quote from Smith: “We are constantly asking, ‘What else could we do?’” 

Besides redefining what a career in coffee can look like, the cooperative is also incredibly active in mutual aid. They’ve worked with groups like [MADRVA](https://www.madrva.org/), an organization that distributes goods for people in the community. Recently, they launched a campaign where $2 from each purchase of a specific coffee was donated to a relief organization providing food to Gaza. Afterglow is also a CSA box pickup site, and supports local farms. 

Smith believes that a coffee shop can be more than just a place for a good shot of espresso. They hope to see more spots turn the spotlight on workers and build sustainable futures for baristas. 

Smith sees the change coming. “It just feels like the next thing that’s coming has to be something more than just coffee.”",1,1762035047.0,coffee_roasters,0,1.0,False

Reality doesn’t respond to noise. It responds to what feels normal in your system. A state can be quiet and still be the strongest signal in the room.

It’s like setting a GPS. You don’t stare at the screen every second. You drive. The route keeps recalculating because the destination is already locked in.

Same with identity. Once “already mine” feels like home base, life can get busy and the process still runs.

And the signs don’t always look like big breakthroughs. They look like fewer emotional spikes. Heavier sleep. Timing that starts lining up instead of glitching. That’s movement.

So no, momentum isn’t lost because you’re living. It’s lost when you start doubting the version you already claimed.

Actionable shifts you can use right now:
• When the thought “Did I lose it?” shows up, name it and drop it.
• Do simple things as the version who already has it: drink your coffee, answer texts, drive to work.
• Hold the state for a few calm seconds instead of obsessing for hours. Stillness holds more power than panic.
• Track your body, not their actions. Less tension, smoother mornings, less checking. Those are your signals it’s working….continue reading the full post inside Manifestation Portals (7-day fr3e tr!al 🔗 in bi0).

1om0doa,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1om0doa/the_daily_routines_of_5_geniuses_prove_that/,The daily routines of 5 geniuses prove that discipline isn't what we think it is [Long],"Reading ""Daily Rituals"" completely changed how I think about discipline.

I always thought discipline = willpower + forcing yourself to do hard things.

But looking at these 5 routines, discipline is actually about **eliminating friction**.

**Examples from the book:**

**Freud's Zero-Decision Rule**

* Wife laid out clothes
* Wife put toothpaste on brush
* Wife made all household decisions
* Result: 13-hour workdays, zero mental drain

**Beethoven's 60 Coffee Beans**

* Counted exactly 60 beans every morning
* Turned breakfast into autopilot
* Brain saved for composing

**Franklin's Two Questions**

* Morning: ""What good shall I do?""
* Evening: ""What good have I done?""
* Same questions for 50+ years
* Discipline through accountability

**The pattern:** They didn't force themselves to work. They made NOT working harder than working.

I've been experimenting with this building [dayzen.xyz](http://dayzen.xyz) (habit tracking app focused on personal rhythms) - the core idea is: make your routine so automatic you don't need discipline anymore.

1om0aca,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1om0aca,I need help seeing if I’m in the wrong,"So last night I went with my sister to spirit Halloween. She wanted to get a Halloween costume last minute and she wanted me to get one too. Since it was last minute I had no idea of what I wanted to be and there was very few options available. She ended up dressing as a witch and I just got some Halloween shirts. Nothing really peaked my interest and I was just trying to make her happy by getting something. So I got two Halloween T-shirts since she pointed it out to me. Spirit Halloween was very crowded literally people breathing down my neck. So she was upset I didn’t want to dress up or that I didn’t find anything I liked. Then after that we went to my nephews little fall festival at his daycare where he does part time. It was a small building lots of adults and kids. There was a bunch of kids running around screaming. Then we went trick of treating during this time I also had my nephew asking me 101 questions. After that we went trick of treating. I wasn’t trying to be rude afterwards but with all the people around, the loud music, trying to watch where I’m going in the dark, trying to watch for cars so I’m not hit. I guess I had an attitude I wasn’t trying to have one I was just overwhelmed with no time to prepare or plan. I need to have time to prepare for things she doesn’t think I do. I like to do things like get coffee with her so I can talk with her and spend time with her one on one but now I’m making her feel like I don’t enjoy spending time with her. The reason why I don’t talk to people is because I have to mask the whole time. I have to remember to say the right thing, speak loud enough don’t talk about stuff. Right now I’ve been told the only I should be doing is focusing on retaking my RHIT exam. I’m sitting at the park right now but I’m not intentionally trying to be a dick to her. I constantly feel like why should I talk when I’m going to be labeled as doing or talking about dumbshit or stupidshit it’s why I dont like talking to people. I don’t know. I will include the screen shots so someone can help me to see if I’m wrong and what I should do to fix the situation. ",4,1762034327.0,autism,4,1.0,False

1om08pl,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1om08pl/ronald_dickinson_did_not_overdose_part_1/,Ronald Dickinson Did Not Overdose (part 1),"""Just another Jack and Coke, u can close my tab too."" Said Shane.

He was in his late 60's and always seemed a bit rugged but since his son passed he's started to look a lot worse. And that's normal for someone who grieves but it's only been 4 days since Ronald passed and he looks like he hasn't slept in weeks.

""Sir, your card declined"" said the bartender, pointing at a tiny receipt.

Shane went for his pockets for some change.

""I'll cover it this time"" I said.

""Umm, thanks... that's Judy's card I think.
Must've switched our cards on accident. I'll pay you back"" he murmured.

I doubt that. His financial troubles aren't anything new. Shane and my dad used to hangout and blow whole checks at casinos every week. They were great friends but neither one of them made for a great dad.
They could barely provide for their families going all in on Blackjack. My mom and older brother and I were holding down our rust covered double wide while Shane and my dad were living it up in town.

Alcohol wasn't Shane's problem back then tho, just gambling. In the past 2 days I’ve seen Shane consume countless alcoholic beverages. I’m growing concerned for his health. But I’m just 32 years old and he’s gotta be at least twice that. So who am I to tell this old man what to do.

“Well it was good seeing you again Mr.Dickinson” I said tapping the counter as I stood up.

“Ah Cody, you know you can call me Shane”
I did know. As a matter of fact I had always called him Shane up until 3 days ago when I called him informing him that I had been put on his son’s case.

On another note, I did not like being called “Cody”. My wife called me Cody. My mom and brother called me Cody. To the rest of the County I went by Detective McCormick.
I had worked long and hard in school and on the force for years to separate myself from that unkempt, messy haired boy in the trailer park on the edge of town.

“Sorry, just a habit” I said before exiting the bar.

I hopped into my car and drove past an old, worn, wooden sign. “LAKEVIEW” is what was written on the sign. It didn’t mean much. It was just the part of town where I grew up. For most it might as well say “dead-end”.

Right now what it meant is that I’m about 40 minutes from my beautiful home with my beautiful wife waiting up for me. 40 minutes from Meechan City, my forever home. A great place, full of great schools… just an all around great place to raise a kid.

That wasn’t my interest tho. I didn’t want kids. Life is hard and mostly obstacles and most people learn that long after they have had a few children. 

I had grown up toughing it out and busting my butt to make my situation better and although I was successful in making it out, I was an outlier. So many have tried and still try but Lakeview just doesn’t provide kids with the help they need to grow and become something. There is a huge drug problem and always has been. Drugs and drop outs go hand in hand. And the drug problem has gotten so out of hand that they put me, a full fledged detective, on a drug overdose case. They said the frequency of deaths due to overdose has gotten so high that this one central part of town is ruining the reputation of the whole county.

To be successful in life you either have to do great in school or just be good enough at showing up to a manual labor job to not get fired. And, well, let’s just say the types of drugs that get passed around in Lakeview make both of those tasks nearly impossible. I chose not to get involved in any of that tho.

 I double clicked the lock button on my keys as I walked through the garage entrance of my home.

“How was Shane?” Asked my Kelly, my wife.

“He’s looking rough”

“Well he’s going through a lot. His son passed less than a week ago”

“Yea and I get that but this looks like more than a weeks worth of damage”

“It was his son Cody. Just because you didn’t get to see their bond doesn’t mean it wasn’t there.”

She was right. My dad and I didn’t really have a visual bond and after I moved out for college we didn’t talk much especially after my mom and him divorced but I still cried at his funeral. I still had a lot of good memories. But Ronnie and Shane still managed to have a closeness that I never had with my father.

I thought back to my childhood growing up next door to Ronnie. He and I played little league together and I remembered a time the pitcher threw a fast ball while Ronnie was up to bat and ended up hitting him in the hand. I remember him falling grabbing his knuckles and holding back tears as his face turned blood red. This time Shane had showed up to see his boy play. This was a rare occasion. Nevertheless, Shane sprung into action. Shane ran to the dugout and onto the field towards home base and knelt down by his son. What had been a flood of tears moments before Shane arrived had turned into quiet sniffles. It seemed odd to me how a man who could barely provide for his family was such a comfort to his son. It never made sense to me. My father was similar to Shane and had never had that effect on me

“You know… I think you would make a great father. Maybe be a real difference maker!”
I should’ve known this was where the conversation was going.

“And you would be a fine mother” I said
“But I just don’t think it’s for me. I have you and you have me and I think that’s enough”

“You should really open up to the idea tho Cody” she said.

“Kelly, I told you that I didn’t want kids when we were still dating and you agreed that that was okay.”

“I know but I’ve grown since then” she said
“We’ve both grown”

“We have” I said, embracing her and letting her sink her chin into my chest
“But I still stand by what I said”

She turned her face, now her cheek against my chest. I could tell my response bothered her. I didn’t want it to be one of those nights.
“Well how was your day?”

“Goodnight Cody.”

It was one of those nights…

The next day I was woke early by a phone call. It was Shane.

“Hey, can we meet at the bar?”

I pull my phone from my ear to look at the time on my screen. It’s 3:09 AM. Why is he calling this early?

“Shane the bar isn’t even open… why are you calling this early?”

“Well… I just need to talk to you about something. Maybe just meet me in the bars parking lot.”

Strange… I grabbed my keys and badge. If I was going to meet this scraggly old man in an empty bar parking lot before the sun rose, I figured I should have proof I’m an officer. Didn’t want any patrol officers to get the wrong idea. On the other hand, it probably wouldn’t matter. Most officers didn’t care what kind of drug deals went down on this side of town. Or at least they haven’t stopped any from happening.
I hopped in my car and started my journey to the other side of town.

I arrived to see Shane standing there holding a manila folder. Also I couldn’t help but notice his car wasn’t in the parking lot. Lakeview was a small town but his double wide was still a few miles from the bar. There’s no way this elderly man made the trip here on foot… and got here by 5 AM. This was strange.

I got out of my car and began walking towards him when I noticed the light engine hum coming from behind me. I turned to see a black SUV parked in the gravel parking lot on the other side of the road. It was too nice to belong to Shane. Too nice of a car for anyone in Lakeview for that matter.

It could’ve been someone who was related to Ronnie through his mother’s side just helping Shane out. Families come together when they grieve and maybe one of them just gave Shane a ride.

As I approached Shane he held out the folder to me. Without opening it, it already seemed a bit too organized to have been compiled by Shane.

“What is this?” I asked.

“It’s just some documents of Ronnie’s… I just figured they wouldn’t hurt the case.”

“Uh, ok… thanks… so is there anything else you want to talk about?” I said not wanting to sound irritated or accusatory. But he did call me out to an unopened business at the crack of dawn… just to hand me a folder full of what seemed like mostly public information.

“Yup… hey I know this is unusual. I’m sorry… I just… I just need some rest… I’m gonna head back home now.”

“Need a ride?” I asked.

“Naw, I got my truck parked down the road. It just outta gas. I got a 5 gallon in the trunk I’ll just fill it up when I get back to it.”

“You sure? I could at least get you back to your truck.”

“No… I enjoy the walk”

He definitely did not enjoy the walk. At his age making any trip did not seem enjoyable. He had a bit of a limp.

I told him bye and got back in my car to go home. I could see in my passenger side mirror that he had not moved from that spot.

I pulled out and started down the road when I saw Shane finally begin to walk. But he wasn’t walking in the direction that he said his truck was in. He was walking across the street to the gravel parking lot where the SUV was parked. Shane wasn’t the most trustworthy guy but I don’t know why he would lie about that or turn down my ride. I pulled into the next parking lot and turned my self around. It only took about 2 minutes to get back to that gravel parking lot but the SUV was already gone by the time I returned. I continued down the road towards the spot where Shane had told me he left his truck. If he was really walking down that road to his truck then I would easily catch him before he got to his truck.

 I got to a 4 way stop. I should’ve seen him and his truck a mile or 2 ago but I didn’t. It doesn’t take a detective to figure out that somebody is lying when they make it this obvious. And I’m a detective anyways so I can tell when people are being dishonest.
I thought about calling him but I’m a detective on a case about an old friend who passed of what most assume is just a drug overdose. They happen weekly in Lakeview but Shane had requested that someone look into it deeper. And now Shane’s acting weird.

It’s too early for this tho. I need some coffee.
I drove to the local coffee spot. The one in Meechan, that is. The one in Lakeview would probably spike your coffee. Not as a prank but just because that’s probably the way anybody who is dumb enough to stick around or cursed enough to get stuck in Lakeview would want it.

But we’re not gonna get into that right now. I parked right in front of the glass door. The hours were printed on the door. 8:30AM to 6PM everyday except for Sunday. It was closed on Sunday. It wasn’t quite 8:30 yet.
I figured I’d see what this Manila folder was all about. I reached over to grab it from the passenger seat. I picked it up by the spine of the folder and everything fell out. I gathered it all together and put it in the folder. Just before I closed the folder I noticed an AA graduation certificate under the seat. I grabbed it but felt a metal ring next to it. I grabbed it. It was a key chain connected to a remote control car key. It said “Ford” across the back of it. I drove a Toyota. Kelly drove a Honda. Shane. Shane drove an old rust bucket and I’m pretty sure it was a Ford. He was in my car a few days ago. I picked him up on the first day that we met to talk about the case. They might belong to him. He must’ve had them fall from his pocket while he was in my car.
I considered this evidence for now so I put them on an empty red lanyard I had hanging from my rearview.

I looked up at my dash. 8:31AM is what it said. I’m pretty sure it’s about 3 minutes behind anyway. I hopped out of my car and walked into the coffee shop. I ordered a latte, found a place to sit and opened up the Manila folder. There was the AA graduation certificate. I don’t know why this document would be important to me. I mean it’s not nothing but I’m not sure I need this. Shane claims he compiled all of these documents and he’s not too bright so maybe he just grabbed whatever he could find. I moved on. I went through some printed out arrest records, warrants… there was even his senior picture.

 I want to say I like remembering him that way, the way he was senior year, but the truth is, he fell off way before he got to senior year. You could see his teeth were turning grey in the photo. His eye sockets caved in, as did his cheeks. Typical student of Lakeview High School. Most of the kids didn’t make it to senior year. I don’t remember if Ronnie graduated but his face and neck sticking out of this oversized tux that he wore on this day tells me that he made it all the way up to picture day his senior year. It’s truly sad. 

Everything about this town I grew up in… just sad. I could talk proudly of being the only one that made it out but looking into the young yet weary face of a kid that I used to know, used to play tag with, used to be friends withs face… it just tore me up. Because now he’s six feet deep just like at least half a dozen of the kids that used to stay up late with me running around that trailer park in the summer trying to catch fireflies pretending that this world, this part of the world, it’s not all that bad. But it was.
I wiped a tear away trying not to be seen crying. I don’t think anyone noticed. There was just a worker and an older lady sitting down on the other side of the coffee shop.
I flipped to the back and saw another picture of Ronnie. It was him standing next to Pastor Dean. Pastor Dean might be the one other good apple to make it out of Lakeview. He seemed to be a great guy. He did a lot of work helping out with the AA program although I doubt he ever dealt with addiction himself. He might not be able to relate to them but he’s there to help.
In the photo him and Ronnie were seen smiling. Ronnie was holding his AA graduation certificate while Pastor Dean had one arm over Ronnie’s shoulder and the other hand pointing at the certificate. They both looked so proud. Pastor Dean looked like the father that Ronnie never had and with a smile like that on the pastors face, you would’ve thought Ronnie was graduating from Harvard until you read the label on it: Addicts Anonymous. Was probably the furthest thing from a Harvard graduation certificate. Had a nice font though. Coulda fooled me.

But what caught my eye most wasn’t the font. It was the date on the certificate: “on this 11th day of July”… this was last Friday. Ronnie overdosed on Saturday. Did Ronnie graduate addicts anonymous just to turn right back around and do some hard core drugs? This isn’t unheard of but just by the look on his face of genuine pride in accomplishment… I can’t believe he just threw it all away. I don’t believe that.

I took one last sip of coffee and headed out the door, folder in hand. I got in my car and headed to Lakeview first Baptist Church. More like Lakeview only Baptist Church… or Lakeview only church. Lakeview isn’t a very “churchy” kind of town if u didn’t get the hint earlier in the story.

I pulled into the parking lot. I walked into the church and was greeted by Mrs.Mindy Warren.

“If it isn’t Mr.Cody McCormick!” She said.
I smiled back and nodded as I approached the desk that she was seated at. She had aged since the last time I came to church here but her voice and enthusiasm for serving in the church were unmistakably recognizable.

“Hello Mrs.Mindy, do u happen to know how I can get in touch with Pastor Dean?”

“Well yes! You can go down the hall to your left and the room on the right at the very end of the hallway. He shouldn’t be too busy to see you.”

I headed down the hallway and got to the room that she suggested.

Pastor Dean was flipping through an old worn Bible full of sticky notes and pages covered in different colored highlighters. Too invested in his study to notice me so I lightly tapped the propped open door.

He looked up and recognized me immediately.

“Cody! Or isn’t it Detective McCormick?” He said with a smile.

As for anyone else in this hellish town I would feel bothered being called Cody, but with this one, I didn’t feel disrespected in the least bit. This was the man who baptized me when I was younger and many of the very few good memories that I have of this town were at Vacation Bible School and involved him. Of course back then he had a head of hair, jet black with a slight beard. Now the top of his head was completely bald and he had a thick grey beard. He spoke at my dad’s funeral and at the time still had hair and his beard was just beginning to grey. Time is taking its toll but i hope that for all the effort that he put in, and continues to put in, Pastor Deans work that he’s done in this town will continue to shine through the thick cloud that hangs over this run down town, and maybe one day, make a true difference. I just hope it’s not all for nothing.

He welcomed me in and I sat down across from him.

“Well what brings you back to this side of town?” He asked.

“I’m investigating the death of an old friend, one you may have heard about. “

“Ahh you mean Ronald… yes it’s truly sad. He was a good boy. Ronald and I had many conversations and he knew the Lord. He’s in a better place now. It can still be hard for us down here tho.”

“Yes, it is sad,truly. I’m just here to ask some questions. You seem to be a man who connects with those around you well enough to where you might have some extra info that could help me figure some things out”
“Well yes.” He said taking off his glasses “I try my best to connect personally to those of who I get the pleasure to disciple. They are more than just a number or a tally, they are souls that need saving, real people, image bearers of their Creator.”

I know this is my occupation, just a job, but it’s moments like these when I can say, “I love my job!” Mostly it’s consists of chasing leads, reading documents, and filling out paper work but getting to hear Pastor Deans genuine response of the death of a man who was basically nobody in a town that’s basically nowhere, just seeing how much he cared about people, it was just a good feeling.

We continued to chat for a little while before I realized I’m here to do a job.

“So, um, the main thing that brought me to your office was a photo from a few days ago of you and Ronnie.” I said while reaching in my bag to pull out the manilla folder. I laid it on the desk in front of me and opened it up to show the AA certificate on top of the stack of paper. I flipped through it to show him the photo of him with Ronnie.

“Can you tell me anything about Ronnie’s demeanor during this celebration? Like, did y’all talk a good bit?”

He looked at the photo. He began to choke up but cleared his throat. He handed the photo back to me and clasped his hands.

“Yes…” he said. “It was a typical conversation that you might have at one of these events. I told him how proud I was of him. He told me his plans. Said he wanted to make a difference in this community, maybe serve food or help set up events that I’m speaking at. He said he saw it as a way that he could serve the Lord, and I agreed. I don’t know what happened to cause him to relapse so soon. I just wish I would’ve said something more. Maybe there’s something I left out of our conversation.”

He was visibly upset. I felt for him. But I disagreed. He did everything he could for Ronnie.

“You did everything you could” I assured him. “

We continued to chat for a while, nothing of much importance regarding the case. It was getting late in the afternoon and I was due for a date with Kelly in less than 3 hours. I bid the pastor goodbye and headed out of the church and out of Lakeview.

I got home with about 2 hours before I was scheduled to meet Kelly at a local hibachi restaurant. She was planning on heading straight from work to meet me there. I showered off and got dressed. I just wore a short sleeve button up and some khakis. Nothing too fancy.

 I had some spare time so I grabbed my work bag and laid it on my kitchen counter. As I was going through it, the unclaimed car keys caught my eye. I had forgotten all about them. I looked all over for some sign of ownership. All I could find worth noting was a small yellow dot shaped sticker on the back of it. Then it struck me, “these keys can’t be for Shane’s truck.” Shanes truck was a 70’s model. I believe remote control keys didn’t appear until the early 80’s. And I know that any keys to a truck like Shane’s wouldn’t look like these. These look like they belong to a relatively new model. 

 I did a deep clean on the inside of my car, vacuum, wipe down surfaces, etc., less than 2 months ago and those keys weren’t there. The only people who have rode in my car since then are Kelly and Shane. I can ask Kelly if she knows any thing about it, but if they’re not hers, then either somebody has been in my car uninvited… or something strange is going on involving Shane.

I headed home, ate, and got ready for bed. Tomorrow I had to show up at the office early to try and do some research.

The next day I showed up at the office before the shift change happened. There were 2 officers there, officer Harrison and a young officer that I hadn’t met yet.

“Morning Harry. How was the shift?”

“Nothing big happened on this side of town, just a bar fight, nothing huge. I just sent them home. There was no blood or bruising, just stretched out shirt collars. Right now I’m just waiting for Greg to show up to take my place. He should be arriving here soon.”

Officer Greg Henn and I had really become good friends here lately. He was just a year younger than me but had joined the force in his late 20’s. We enjoyed picking on him for the first few years he was there. Not in a cruel manner, just something to toughen up the new comers. He took the minor harassment well, just laughing it off. This had kinda caused it to stay prolonged past his rookie phase, but throughout it all, he remained to show that he’s a solid guy.
He and I had planned to get lunch together on break today. 

I heard the entrance door open and saw Greg walk in.
“Morning” he said walking past me.
Harry made his way to the exit.
“Morning Greg.” I returned.
“You still down for the Indian place I told you about?”

“Yea, I’m still down.” I told him. 

Meechan is a growing city with new attractions emerging constantly, whether it be ax throwing, a winery, or foreign food restaurants like the Indian restaurant we are going to today. Greg told me the food was great so I agreed to try it.

Nothing eventful had happened for the first half of the day. I just had finished most of my paperwork. I headed over to the restaurant and parked next to Greg. We both got out of our cars and walked into the restaurant. We both ordered butter chicken and then we found a place to eat.

We got to talking about work. He told me nothing crazy has really happened. He told me about a fight that broke out at a house party in East Meechan where a big fight broke out but really based on what Greg told me, it was mainly just 2 kids insulting eachother and then a few punches were thrown.

But Greg mentioned an event from 2 weeks ago in Lakeview where a black SUV had been parked in a bars parking lot early in the morning way past closing time. When he ran the plates he said that it had belonged to Ronnie. This was 2 weeks ago and it had when Ronnie was still alive but if this SUV is the same SUV that I had seen at the bar then that draws up several questions. I’ll address 3
1: how did a lowly tradesman still in a drug recovery program at the time own what seemed to be an expensive car
2: Did he recover it from the tow company
3: if not, who did recover it.

I asked him the make and model and he told me it was a 2022 Ford Expedition. He told me he isn’t aware as to where it was towed but that he thinks the towed truck said Lakeview Towing on the side.

I took note of that and planned on trying to contact them later on. Our food arrived and we began to eat and chat about other things. I told him about how Kelly is insisting we have children and it has caused tension in our marriage. Considering he was a friend of mine I figured he would respond “buddy-buddy” but he actually suggested that I should consider it. He told me his 2 sons have changed his life for the better. He couldn’t leave out the stressful part of it, admitting that he looses much sleep, but in the end, he feels blessed for having children. I said nothing in return but I could tell he was just telling me how he felt but understood why I feel how I feel. Seeing that my childhood wasn’t the best and that I didn’t have much of a relationship with my father, he couldn’t leave see why I didn’t think having a child of my own seemed like a great idea.

His walkie buzzed. A voice on the other side was requesting backup. It wasn’t anything serious, just someone arguing with a police and that he needed someone to block their car from fleeing from the officer.

I finished my meal. It was great, definitely a restaurant I will return to. I remembered the lead about the towing company from earlier.

I called the towing company and they told me they dropped it off at an impound in Lakeview. I headed out to the impound and spoke to a man at the impound asking him about the black ford escape. They told me it has already been retrieved by the owner. I didn’t feel like I needed to tell him that the owner had passed. I was fixing to leave but before leaving I asked him who came and paid to retrieve the car.

“The owner I’m guessing.” He shrugged.
“Can you give me any identifying markings or something of the sort?”
“Just an older gentleman.” He said
“So no tattoos… no scars?” I asked
“Just an older gentleman wearing a flannel and a ball cap. Didn’t see any ink on him.”

He wasn’t too interested in helping, I could tell. He probably didn’t like getting involved with a crime case anyway. I wasn’t interested in running his name for a warrant. But if I did, I could probably get him along with the rest of this town.

I’m gonna assume the man was Shane. Ronnie had dark hair that hung slightly past his jaw line and he had several tattoos, 2 of which were on his neck and were very noticeable whether he wore long sleeves or not. The man who worked the desk at the impound surely would’ve noticed these. Shane was probably helping his son out getting this car back. But why did Ronnie have this SUV. I needed to speak to Shane about this.

I headed out to the bar in Lakeview where Shane and I were talking a few days ago.
He has had an unquenchable thirst for alcohol lately and although he would save money just buying a 12 pack or his own bottle of whatever his choice drink is, he’s set on quitting “soon”. His last drink is always the next drink, but by the time he finishes the next drink he’s changed his mind and just wants one more. So he’s just buying single drinks at the bar rather than making a commitment to buying 12 bottles for cheap. That explanation wasn’t really necessary tho because shame isn’t somebody that I would consider financially literate.

I pulled into the parking lot and headed into the bar to see Shane slumped over the bar table mumbling to himself.

“Hey Shane” I said.

He didn’t look up or really even acknowledge my presence.

“Shane, do you know about a black Ford Escape that was in Ronnie’s name?”

“I ain’t looking to inherit no fancy automobile” he shouted

I backed up a bit startled.

“My truck serves me just fine.”

He was drunk and something about what I said offended him.

“Uh-oh Shane! The boys in blue done came to getcha!” I heard from behind me.

I felt a heavy hand slap my back followed by a drunken laugh. It was Wayne Ashburn.

“I’m just here to follow up on some stuff with-“

“I mean, you know he done something to his boy worth hiding. For crying out loud his last name is Dickinson… get it ‘dick-in-son’” he busted out laughing.

“That was wildly inappropriate Wayne. This is serious. I would appreciate it if you left us be.”

“Hell, get mad at me for telling the truth. If you ain’t gonna arrest him you might as well throw him in a insane asylum the way him and his boy were with that cult crap”

Cult? I know nothing of a cult that Ronnie was involved with. Coming from Wayne, I’m sure it’s just a rumor.

“Hey Shane, do u recognize these car keys? I found them in my car a few days after we had a chat in it.”

“Ronnie ain’t in no cult!” Ronnie drunkenly yelled. “He’s a good boy! He been stayin in tha church” he murmured something else but was mumbling. At that point he had lifted his head up to where I could see his eyes were bloodshot. I felt terrible pulling this man into this investigation, assuming that he’s an innocent man, heartbroken by the sudden passing of his son. But I have a job to do.

“Shane I’m just trying to cover all bases. Do u know anything about why these keys would show up in my car?”

“They were Ronnie’s. I just held onto them. Must’ve fallen outta my pocket.” He said, calming down. “I… I’m gonna go to church… yea, I’m going to church.”

I wanted him to continue the questioning but I wasn’t detaining him. He was free to go wherever he pleased. I had to let him go.

I came home early and did some yard work while Kelly worked on the garden. We had gotten past our differences about our disagreement in having children. And although she isn’t mad at me right now she is very persistent in us having kids. I always want to talk about something else when it comes up but she knows I’m just avoiding it. I just can’t invite somebody into this world and have them possibly go through what I and the rest of Lakewood went through growing up. And it’s not just Lakewood. The percent of children growing up in poverty and with deadbeat parents is increasing nationally. And there are tons of people just like my wife that really do want children but once they are parents they fail. And I can’t tell you what the leading cause for an un present parent is, but drugs and trauma must be some of them. Lakewood got both of those and I got one which is enough to tell me I’m not up for the challenge. I could go on and on about how my father wasn’t there but my reasoning really goes like this: I’m a scared man unsure if I got what it takes, and although that sounds insulting, I would rather be a blameless coward than a reckless deadbeat. This isn’t exactly what I told Kelly tho. I don’t know if she would understand. I just tell her that I’m not ready for it yet and that I still have to think about it.

The next day I returned to the bar hoping that I could find Shane and that he would cooperate but he wasn’t there. But I did see somebody that I wanted to talk to. In the background of the photo of Ronnie with Pastor Dean there was another Lakewood resident that I was familiar with. It was Mason Warner. I am unsure what he was at the AA ceremony for. As far as I know he was not a drug user but was very much an alcoholic. I’m assuming he was there because of alcohol and I am sure he is here for the same reason. 

I sat down at the bar next to him and pulled out the photo.

“Hey Mason, I’m on the case regarding the death of Ronald Dickerson and I saw you in this photo at his AA ceremony. Did you and him happen to talk at all on that night?” I asked.

“Well yea, Ronnie and I talked.” He answered. “Ronnie’s mom is my stepdads cousin so we always known eachother. Of course I ain’t avoiding him.”

This was new info. Mason might’ve been somebody I could have interviewed earlier on in this investigation.

“Is there anything u can add to the investigation. Was Ronnie upset? Depressed?” I asked

“Well Ronnie had his struggles but who don’t? He just might’ve not felt like he had meaning. I figure that’s the problem here in Lakewood. Most people just try and get distracted with some vice. I really don’t think there’s a problem with that tho. He just shoulda enjoyed a cold one with me than get on whatever it was that got him.”

Ronnie had been in the church a lot during his time in the AA program. And not just present there. He was an active member who was willing to help out in events. Pastor Dean had gone on and on about this.

“Had Ronnie ever spoken about his faith with you during his time in AA? It just strikes me odd that he would become so invested just to go back to his old ways immediately.” I asked.

“What?” Mason said. Giving me a confused look. Something I said threw him off. “Ronnie ain’t ever got no faith.”

This was interesting information. Pastor Dean had gone on about Ronnie’s faith in God during our conversation about the AA graduation ceremony. I brought this up to Mason and he insisted that from what he and Ronnie had talked about, Ronnie was of no faith. But he did say that that could have changed since the last time they spoke about it.

I took notes of this conversation and headed out of the bar.

I headed to Shane’s house to see if he could tell me anything about this contradictory statement hoping that maybe his father knew a thing or two about his son’s religious beliefs. I was headed to his house but turned into a parking lot when I noticed his truck parked in front of a bakery. It was his ex-wife’s bakery. I walked in and saw him and her chatting. 

Besides them the store was empty. It was a store that typically didn’t get much business, Lakewood wasn’t a good place to start a business, but it got just enough customers to keep the lights on.

“Hey there Cody!” Said Martha, Ronnie’s mother. “Thank you for everything your doing about our sons case.”

The death must’ve brought them together because Martha typically didn’t refer to Ronnie as “our son” but “my son”. They were both grieving and lost something so important to them and I feel they find more comfort in eachother than they do anyone else.

I saw an open scrapbook on the counter opened up to a page with a picture of Ronnie smiling in front of a home made chocolate cake that had eleven candles on it. I remembered that day. Ronnie’s birthday was in June and that day was pretty warm. We had a balloon fight and there was a cheap water slide at the party. There were a lot of circumstances that led Ronnie to a life full of drug abuse but that was a day that o think Ronnie, along with his mother and father, were genuinely happy.

Martha passed me a slice of red velvet cake and looked at me with a smile. I took it as a gesture of appreciation for me picking up her son’s case. I thanked her and at the slice while she talked to me about some of the pictures of her son in the scrap book. 

Shane was off to the side, possibly hung over, but still looked very disturbed.

I laid my hand on his shoulder. “Hey Shane, is everything alright?” I didn’t want to seem insensitive but his demeanor was off.

“I’m just not feeling well” he said and then walked out the door.

I felt like I should follow him but I didn’t feel like just leaving Martha.

She and I continued to talk. She got to asking me about my kids. I told her we haven’t decided when we want to start a family yet, not wanting to explain to her that I just don’t want children. I really just wanted to escape at this point so I looked at my phone in my hand and pretended that my boss had texted me to return to my office. I told Martha that I was needed at the office and headed out to see if I could find out where Shane had gone.

I saw his truck in the distance heading further into Lakeview. I followed from a distance. I saw him pull into the church parking lot. I parked in a dollar general parking lot in the distance and kept an eye on the truck. It was still running and I could see that Shane was still sitting in the driver seat. He stayed in the vehicle for a long time. He would rub his eyes and forehead and nod his head left to right aggressively.

Eventually he got out of his vehicle without turning it off and speed walked towards the church door. He was about 10 feet from the door when he stopped in his tracks. He stood there for a moment just starring down at his boots.

He turned around and walked back to his truck. Once he got into the truck he pulled out of the parking lot and made direct eye contact with me as he passed my car.

I don’t know what he was doing at the church but I fear that he might be a threat to pastor Dean. I headed to the church to find out why Shane was acting so strange in the parking lot.

I drove to the spot that was previously taken by Shane’s truck and walked into the church and into Pastor Deans office.

I’m trying to make a 15 minute video with two characters having a conversation.

The characters need to stay visually consistent, so I think using loras (trained character models) is probably the best way to do that.

Both characters have different anatomy. One might have one or three eyes, or even none. Four arms. No nose. Weird teeth or mouths, stuff like that.

Most of the time only one character will be on screen, but sometimes there will be a wide shot showing both. Lipsync is important too.

I already have the script for their conversation. I also have some backgrounds and props like a chair and a coffee cup.

What I want to do is place a character in the scene, make them sit in the chair, talk, and have natural head or hand movements.

My idea is to generate short video clips for each part, then put them together later with a video editor.

The main problem is I don’t know how to build a full workflow for creating these kinds of videos.

Here’s what I need

1. Consistent characters
2. The option to make them interact with props or move their head and hands when talking
3. Lipsync
4. Unique voices for each character
5. Control over the emotion or tone of each voice
6. Realistic visuals
7. Optional sounds like a window breaking or other ambient effects

I’d really appreciate some guidance on how to set up a complete workflow from start to finish.

I use cloud computers for AI generation, so hardware is not an issue.

Is there any tutorial or workflow out there that covers something like this?",1,1762034104.0,StableDiffusion,0,1.0,False

I need to be real with you guys for a minute. Six months ago, I was burning out - juggling my psychology degree with a retail job that left me exhausted and barely making rent. I kept thinking there had to be a better way to make money without sacrificing all my study time and sanity.

Then I found this opportunity through a friend, and honestly? It sounded almost too good to be true. Getting paid to just... talk? To real people who actually wanted to hear what I had to say?

But let me tell you about my typical Wednesday now: I finish my last class, grab my laptop, and spend the next two hours chatting with the coolest group of people in China about everything from weekend plans to American slang. Last week we spent a whole session comparing college life here versus there - and I got paid $65/hour for it.

The craziest part? This isn't even my final form. I started at $50/hour just having casual conversations, and now that I've learned some basic Chinese phrases (which they taught me for free!), I've moved up to their bilingual host level. The growth is real - both in my bank account and my skill set.

What surprised me most wasn't the money (though getting that weekly PayPal deposit is pretty sweet). It's how much I've grown. I've accidentally become better at public speaking, learned video editing basics, and gained this incredible cross-cultural confidence I never knew I needed.

The team behind this is seriously supportive too. When I first started, I had no idea how to set up good lighting or make engaging content. My dedicated coach walked me through everything, and now I actually enjoy planning my weekly Direct seeding themes.

If you're a student, stay-at-home parent, or anyone looking for flexible work that doesn't feel like work, I can't recommend this enough. The schedule is completely up to you, and you're literally getting paid to be yourself and share your perspective.

A bunch of you have been asking how to learn more since I posted about this on my stories last month. Honestly, the best way is through referral - the team told me they prioritize applications that come through current partners.

I’m trying to make a 15 minute video with two characters having a conversation.

The characters need to stay visually consistent, so I think using loras (trained character models) is probably the best way to do that.

Both characters have different anatomy. One might have one or three eyes, or even none. Four arms. No nose. Weird teeth or mouths, stuff like that.

Most of the time only one character will be on screen, but sometimes there will be a wide shot showing both. Lipsync is important too.

I already have the script for their conversation. I also have some backgrounds and props like a chair and a coffee cup.

What I want to do is place a character in the scene, make them sit in the chair, talk, and have natural head or hand movements.

My idea is to generate short video clips for each part, then put them together later with a video editor.

The main problem is I don’t know how to build a full workflow for creating these kinds of videos.

Here’s what I need

1. Consistent characters
2. The option to make them interact with props or move their head and hands when talking
3. Lipsync
4. Unique voices for each character
5. Control over the emotion or tone of each voice
6. Realistic visuals
7. Optional sounds like a window breaking or other ambient effects


I’d really appreciate some guidance on how to set up a complete workflow from start to finish.

I use cloud computers for AI generation, so hardware is not an issue.

TSH is ""normal"" according to my doctor (2.8), taking 75mcg levothyroxine.

Recently started tracking water intake because my new endo mentioned dehydration can compound thyroid related fatigue. I was skeptical but figured why not try.

Been using a hydration app for three weeks, aiming for 70 to 80oz daily. Previously I was probably drinking 30 to 40oz max (mostly coffee, which doesn't count).

What I've noticed:

Days where I hit 75oz+: Fatigue is still there but less crushing. I can usually make it through the day without a nap.

Days where I fall short (50 to 60oz): Back to needing 2 or 3 hour afternoon naps, brain fog is worse.

This could totally be placebo or coincidence. But the timing correlates enough that I'm curious.

Questions for you:

Do you track hydration? If yes, what's your daily target?

Have you noticed any correlation with fatigue levels?

Does anyone's endocrinologist actually talk about this or is it just the generic ""drink more water"" advice?

My surgery was through Kaiser in Southern California. I paid $10 copay for the surgery (!!!). 

Prior to surgery: I had had a grease filled day, i.e. chicken nuggets plus a gluten free Dominos pizza with extra cheese and extra olives. I had also just lost 55 pounds and was (and still am) on metformin. All three of these led to a GB attack at 1 AM the next day, which I thought was due to gas, so I took col-ace to force a BM, but relieving gas and poo did not relieve the pain that went from my right side front, just under the ribcage, to the left side, plus all down my back from my right shoulder to the kidney area. I went to urgent care where I was given a urine test, blood test, and sonogram. Kidneys and liver came back fine. Sonogram showed a 1.5mm stone in the GB. After the tests, I had to sit in the waiting room for urgent care from 12 to 4:30 despite test results being sent to my KP app, so I knew what was wrong and what needed to be done, but I had to wait for everyone else in urgent care to be seen before the doctor saw me again. The entire time I was curled up in pain and honestly, one of the worst parts of this experience. Doc saw me for a grand total of 10 mins, told me I needed surgery, gave me a number to call, and a script for **dicyclomine (if you are pre-op and having GB attacks, REQUEST THIS FROM YOUR DOC, it stops GB contractions).**

I called the number and thought I was getting a date for surgery, but it was a date for a pre-op consultation. Had to wait a week for that. Met with the surgeon, who was able to answer questions the urgent care doc did not answer, such as what I should be eating, how to prepare for surgery, etc. He recommended eating bland food like unseasoned chicken, plain rice, anything non-fat. I found out in the upcoming month that salty food and sweet food did not trigger attacks, so I was able to have some flavor. Also anything less than 7 grams of fat did not trigger attacks. I ate a grand total of 14 grams of fat a day. 

I then had to wait for a surgery date. Someone called me later and offered me a date two days from when she called. I declined as the person who volunteered to care for me was not available. I was then offered 10/24, which was a month away. I had to accept it. I was sent a checklist of how to prepare for surgery and kind of left to figure things out. I would message my doc through the app with questions and they would answer on average 2 days later (not including weekends). 

  
I then had to do labs, including an ECG. This was done in a tiny room off a main hall in the hospital with nothing but a draw curtain, and even though it took less than 5 mins, I did NOT like that. Also they sent me results that said, ""Abnormal ECG, cannot rule out (insert term for heart attack here)."" Which FREAKED ME THE FUCK OUT, and I was at work when I got that, and called out sick due to anxiety and needing to talk to someone about it. I managed to get an appointment with a doctor who wasn't my doctor since no one else was answering messages, and they let me know that it was something the computer spit out and didn't mean anything, and that my numbers were really good. They reviewed my BP, cholesterol levels, and asked if I had diabetes (which will happen a lot through this journey, I am a big girl and apparently medical professionals don't understand that being fat does not always equal diabetic...also I am taking metformin for weight loss, weight is a complication from Hashimoto's). 

  
Also before surgery I made sure **my toenails were trimmed and my legs were shaved** as I anticipated I wasn't going to get to them for some time after surgery, lol.

Which takes me to...

Day 1: woke up, took a full body shower as instructed, no lotion or hair products, and had been instructed to take out all my piercings. Went to the hospital, checked in, then taken to a huge room with a lot of beds separated by curtains. I call this the meat processing plant, as people were led in to a bed, told to undress, given a gown, then wiped down with something that let me know my legs had razor burn, put under a paper blanket with a heating tube attached, then one by one wheeled out. First nurse came in and asked questions that every single person I saw that day were going to ask multiple times. What meds am I on? Am I pregnant? Do I have diabetes? If I don't have diabetes, why am I on metformin? (seriously, all of Kaiser has access to my records and can see why I am on metformin, so I didn't get why they had to ask). Nurse Freaking Ratched came in and punctured my wrist with an IV that seriously hurt so fucking bad I wanted to punch the lady. No offense to her but this triggered an anxiety attack. The anesthesiologist came in, asked the same questions, saw I was having anxiety and pumped me full of anxiety meds...twice. **They THEN made me pee in a cup for a pregnancy test, which was a bitch to do with that shit in my wrist, so make sure you do that before they hook an IV up**. I did calm down but was still worried so when the person taking care of me came in, in my dilirium I made them promise that if something happened to me, they wouldn't let me cat get euthanized, and would find a home for them. Then I was wheeled into a the surgery room. I had my eyes shut this whole time as I just didn't want to see anything. Someone put a mask on me ""for oxygen"" and it kept falling off. That's the last thing I remember before waking up in the meat processing plant. They made me sit up, and wouldn't let me leave until I burped and farted, meaning the gas was coming out (I could taste chemicals in my mouth for the rest of the day, and I think that was gas).

  
Surgery results: my gallbladder was full of scar tissue which was a result of decades of problems. I was told this started somewhere in childhood/teens, and I am in my 40s. I only remember 2 distinct attacks, though, one from 5 years ago and one from a month ago. This apparently has been contributing to a ton of digestive problems. The stone was apparently 1.5mm...although I got this info second hand so I don't know if its true. I had 5 incisions with the biggest being right under my ribs, off-center. This incision would become the bane of my existence for the remainder of the week.

  
Went home, slept propped up on a[ **modular wedge pillow I got from Amazon**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CC8RF1XC?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1)**. Make sure you get a travel pillow to keep your head up** or else you will have neck problems. I ate a chicken soft taco from Del Taco. I was given scripts for Gabapentin, Tylenol 600, and Robaxin because I had asked not to have narcotics due to fears of constipation. **Do not do what I did...get the damn Norcos!** If you get them, make sure you pick up col-ace or some other laxative.

Day 2: This day was fine. I ate eggs with yolk for the first time in a month, a gluten free pancake, and a Katz gluten free pop tart with no problems. Popping a squat on the toilet was an issue so I just put one foot on either side of the bowl, stayed standing, and peed that way. The anesthetic messed with my BC and triggered a period. Farted A LOT day 2 and 3. This was apparently the gas coming out. My belly swelled up and is still swollen today. I look like a hamburger with its insides squishing out between the buns when I sit down.

Day 3: Watched a funny video that triggered a belly laugh and OMG I felt like I was being stabbed. I couldn't sit up on my own, I couldn't sit on the toilet on my own, I couldn't lift my legs to go over the wedge pillow, and I couldn't laugh, yawn, sneeze, full body stretch, clear my throat, and worse, I couldn't cough, all due to that one incision. At about this day, my throat started acting up because of the breathing tube, triggering uncontrollable coughing spasms that felt like I was being stabbed over and over (my throat was so red and irritated, it looked GUMMY). The person who said they'd help me for a week suddenly decided they didn't want to help anymore (long story, but they are a family member), so I was left on my own. Another family member found out and came to help, and got me a doctor's appointment, again not with the surgeon or my own doctor (**Kaiser really does come through in this aspect, as if your doctor is busy they can get someone else to help, be sure to be open to a video or phone appointment, even if not with your GP**), and they prescribed me a day's worth (four) of Norcos. This other family member drove me to the 24 hour pharmacy and we got the meds, and they stayed the night with me and half the next day.

Day 4: took the Norcos for the first time and omg. It calmed my throat and the stabbing pain. I took 2 this day instead of the 3 other drugs. I was able to sleep a full night where before I could only do 5 hours. Also every day I was eating the Del Taco chicken tacos (at least 1, and maybe a half of another one). I was so grateful for flavor. Had eggs every day, at least 1/2 a pickle daily, an Arnold Palmer (my fave drink), plenty of water, some green beans, and plain rice mixed with chicken and cream of mushroom soup (I grew up on this struggle meal and I honestly think growing up on nutrition devoid, fat full struggle meals may have contributed to my GB problems). First family member found out the other stepped up, came back to get me, and I ended up at their house where they had..**.A RECLINER. If you don't have one, a recliner that not only power reclines but has a head rest lift is a FREAKING GAME CHANGER.** I do not have one so I had been relying on my upper body strength to get me sitting up. This made it easy to sit up on my own but also sleep without worry of my head falling back. I supported my front with a pillow and a travel pillow. 

Day 5: took the last Norco I would take (so 3 of 4). I had messaged my surgeon for a script for Norco but they said no, and added ibuprofen to my mix of Tylenol, Gabapentin, and Robaxin. I did not take ibuprofen because it messes up my stomach (the uncoated ones or gelcaps are tolerable, and I was prescribed just the raw white pills, and didn't want to to go buy any of the ones that I could tolerate). Got in a bit of an argument with the person supposedly caring for me because when I would drop things they wouldn't come help me pick them up (I have benign essential tremor and drop A LOT of things, daily). **Get yourself a grabby claw thing to pick things up you drop.** I did not use at any time a heating pad or freezer pack. I used those Ricola cough drops with lemon, honey, and echinacea to help with the sore throat, plus Throat Coat tea.

  
Day 6/7: felt better every day now that the coughing was under control**.** [**These front clasp bras helped with dressing, and are super comfortable.**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072MNSZPD?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1&psc=1) Sling them on like a vest, close the clasps, then pull in and situate the girls. Don't get over the head sports bras or rely on your regular bras. I wore them night and day to relieve pressure from a larger cup size resting on that one incision causing problems. I became worried about having BM since I'd had one on Sunday but none since, **so every day I was taking at least 2 col-aces and over the course of the week, drank 1.5 bottles of magnesium citrate. I also drank Smooth Move tea with senna, and even drank a coffee** (not a coffee fan) to try to get things moving. There was a lot of gurgling and such, but nothing until the next Friday after surgery.

10/31: finally, FINALLY a BM. FINALLY. **All those laxatives made sure the poo didn't get hard or stuck in the colon for a hard poo (bearing down is a no-go after surgery).** Went to my post-op appointment which I thought would be with a doctor but was with a nurse. This nurse informed me that I should have been given a [**belly band**](https://a.co/d/9532Cgt) at discharge from surgery. **This would have helped with the coughing and pain.** She gave me one plus [**comfort pads**](https://a.co/d/3ftbavy) **to put between my incisions and clothing** for when I return to work. She said my incisions looked great, I was healing perfectly, and that the surgical glue would soon start to come off. It should all be off by the 2 week mark but if not, use Vaseline to weaken it. For all I care it can stay. Then I was given the go ahead to return home. I should mention I drove myself there and back. **I have a mini-SUV with seats that aren't close to the ground,** which REALLY HELPS. I took a ride in a sedan once during this week and it was hell getting in and out of that thing, plus I could feel every bump on the damn road. It helps to loosen the seat belt or **put a pillow between you and the seat belt.**

Today: I am fine. I was able to sleep on my side for the first time. I'm a side sleeper so this was such a relief. Still taking the Gabapentin, Robaxin, and Tylenol combo as I can tell when it wears off. Only that one incision hurts, and I still have some pain when laughing or coughing, but not as bad as before. I still have the one Norco left which I will save for a time when I am in dire pain, like cramps or something. Today I had 2/3 of a grilled chicken burrito from Del Taco, and maybe 5 fries. Oddly since having the surgery, I am not as hungry as usual. I had to take my trash out and since they said I can't lift more than 10-15 pounds, I dragged the bag to the dumpster then had a neighbor toss it in for me. 

  
Last tips: **get exam gloves and butt wipes** for your first BM, especially if it is closer to the surgery date. That BM was, um, *juicy*, and you do not want that on your hands. Also the wipes help a lot in cleaning. Turning and bending back was A BITCH. If you have a **bidet**, even better. **My toilet is very close to the tub so I used it as kind of support bars to get up and down, but if you don't have that, use the counter or maybe get one of those granny walker things, even if you get it cheap on marketplace and sell it right after.** Looking back, **I wish I had worked out my arms more** because I used them a lot to compensate for what my abs couldn't do, like pushing myself up.

  
I don't remember a lot of gas pain so I don't have tips for that.

  
Anyway. It's a day past a week and I feel a bit more energy. Driving myself to and from the appointment yesterday really taxed me. My last tip is, **make sure you have someone dependable to care for you for at least a week**. My other family member, my neighbors, and even a friend who stopped by really saved me, not only helping me post surgery but also making me feel good knowing they cared. I am grateful to the first family member for stepping up but it is clear they were not ready for all that was required (I mean, I didn't have them wipe me or shower me, so it wasn't too crazy), **including the emotional help they would be required to provide**. This was my first surgery and I was very scared, and the aftermath with the coughing and stabby pain required some emotional comforting, which I think scared them off. **So make sure you have someone near, or friends who can hang out with you, or at least someone who can have your back emotionally.** 

  
Of course, all of this is MY experience and everyone's experience will be different. I am glad the GB is gone and hope you have a good experience if you are facing surgery.",1,1762033635.0,gallbladders,0,1.0,False

Challenged myself A LOT today, extra butter on my sourdough, added mayo to my sandwich and sliced the sourdough thicker than I am comfortable with, gave myself an extra biscuit than I had 'planned', added butter to my champ, dad bought be a fancier steak which is 'scarier' than my normal one (it was very good though), had cake again (it is getting easier), let myself has 'extras' and all of this was on a day were I was chilling quite a lot! I still did go on a walk but I definitely was more chilled than other days! Proud of myself and even dad said he was proud of me today! 

I won't say it's been easy though. The thoughts I am overdoing it and need to ease off now are VERY strong - but I am trying my best to ignore them, even though they feel so true. Also the constant food thoughts, calories chatter, body changes, hunger, fullness just everything is hard to navigate. I am struggling not to let calories, each meal/snack influence my choices later in the day etc, also trying to reduce obsessively planning all my food to maximise my enjoyment etc but either way just reminding myself I am VERY early days into actually committing to weight gain and it will all just take time and a lot of mental work. I wish I had just properly challenged myself sooner, given up the scales sooner, given up mfp sooner, given up trying to eat 'healthy' all the time sooner, basically committed and accepted help post hospital sooner - but hey ho it has all been a learning curve. But I really feel I am actually finally making the changes and taking the action to get me a full recovery. I think I have done well on getting my energy in today, I still have a few things to work on - less veg at dinner, a bigger lunch and afternoon snack and not hoarding calories until the evening but these things are pretty minor compared to previous weeks struggles lol.

Turns out no matter how far down you shove a feeling, it will feed on the drops of blood that slip between your lying teeth, and grow its own. Twisting and slithering in my stomach until it found a way to climb my spine and gnaw its way out to you. I wonder if you have any idea. 
     You haunt me. I am a rotting home that I decided to restore, thinking the breezes that slipped in through the broken windows were what was making me cold. I’m a fool. I tore my hands and formed new callouses replacing those windows, tearing up the floors, and down the walls. It was only once it was livable that I recognized the chill that danced its way across my skin wasn’t coming from outside. I wonder if you’d understand. 
     No amount of time or distance is going to make this go away. It exists already. It has been given life, and will breathe, and grow, whether against my will or not; and if I’m being honest, I am the type of person that desperately needs something to hold on to. Even if it has to feed on my flesh to survive. Strange isn’t it? How something with teeth and claws can be so damned beautiful? 
      All I can do now is carve my silly little words into stones and use them to build a wall around myself so in the end as I’m lying there dying I can say proudly “See?? I turned it around! I did it! I bled, and I cried, and I sliced off bits of myself until I became malleable enough to change so much that I can really say it! I never loved anyone but you for the rest of my life.” 
       Malevolence looks SO good on you. I wish I hadn’t earned it with my empty promises and precariousness. I was always reckless like that. The thing about being numb is when something or someone actually makes you feel something you don’t care if they’re wrapped in razor wire from head to toe. You’ll dive in face first for the slightest taste. I’m ashamed to say I wasn’t ready.

1olzvum,https://i.redd.it/sh0t5p6ktpyf1.jpeg,Married to My Own Betrayer,"Chapter 1
The day before my due date, my husband, Zachary Wilcox, was kidnapped by armed robbers, his life hanging by a thread.
To save him, I was dragged onto a rooftop by dozens of thugs and tortured for a day and a night.
Blood streamed endlessly from between my legs.
When it was finally over, Zachary broke down on the spot, rushing me to the hospital in a frenzy. But it was already too late—our child had died in my womb.
With red-rimmed eyes, he swore to make the perpetrators pay in blood and promised to devote the rest of his life to loving me.
But just as I was about to undergo a C-section, my consciousness blurred and I heard voices through my Bluetooth earpiece. ""Mr. Wilcox, when we went to rescue you just now, if I hadn't known ahead of time it was all an act, I almost would've believed it. You cried so heartbreakingly!""
""Don't remind me. I used up three bottles of eye drops. If I didn't play it convincingly, how could Ariana believe it?""
""But having Mrs. Wilcox violated over and over for Ms. Meyer's sake—isn't that going too far? Mrs. Wilcox was pregnant, after all...""
""So what? I promised Tiff that no one but her would be the lady of the Wilcox family. Only by utterly destroying Ariana's reputation can I eliminate future threats.
""And as for the child in her belly, I never intended to let it be born from the start...""
On the operating table, tears slipped down my cheeks uncontrolled.
The person I had fought so desperately to protect was the true mastermind behind it all.
Even our child had become his sacrifice...
***
""Oh, Mr. Wilcox, because you hired so many people, Mrs. Wilcox's corpus luteum ruptured and needs stitching. The doctor wants to know if you approve of the surgery.""
""Of course. But not a repair—remove her uterus entirely.""
His assistant, Ruben Hatfield, froze, his voice tinged with pity as he spoke again.
""Mr... Mr. Wilcox, maybe you should reconsider? Mrs. Wilcox just lost her child. To take away her chance to be a mother now—isn't that too cruel?
""And besides, are you really willing to give up being a father for Ms. Meyer's sake?""
Zachary paused for a moment, his voice heavy with the sorrow of unrequited love.
""For Tiff, I'd give up fatherhood, even risk my life if I had to.
""I may never be the one she loves, but I'll clear every obstacle for her and her child.
""Make sure Ariana's uterus is completely removed. That way, she'll never be able to compete with Tiff's child for the family inheritance.""
Ruben, unable to bear it, tried again.
""But ever since Mrs. Wilcox married you, she's been nothing but devoted. She loves you so much, do you really—""
Before he could finish, Zachary cut him off. ""Enough! My mind's made up. As for Ariana, since I married her, I'll spend the rest of my life making amends.
""But this time, just to be sure, I want to watch the doctor remove it myself...""
At that moment, the anesthesia left my lower body numb and immobile, but I couldn't stop trembling all over.
Five years ago, on the eve of my stepsister Tiffania Meyer's wedding, I caught her in bed with my fiancé, Nigel Wilcox. I was just about to expose their affair.
Nigel's brother, Zachary, suddenly proposed to me in front of everyone.
He said he'd secretly loved me for years, but never had the chance to say it. Thankfully, fate gave him one last opportunity before I married someone else.
Overwhelmed by his passion, I agreed right then and there, in front of everyone.
The next day, Zachary became the groom, and I became the most envied woman in New York.
After the wedding, I poured my heart into Zachary. Even when the kidnappers demanded my body in exchange for his life, I didn't hesitate.
I never dreamed that Zachary had staged the entire kidnapping—right before my eyes!
The marriage I thought was full of happiness was nothing but a lie.
The man I thought would save me was the very one who destroyed me.
And my fully formed baby—murdered by its own father.
As the thought crossed my mind, a single tear slipped silently down my cheek.
Zachary walked in just in time to see it.
He hurried to my side, gently wiping the tear from my face with the same tenderness as always. But I could no longer feel his warmth.
I tried to open my eyes, and Zachary, thinking I was in pain, called for a nurse.
Soon, cold anesthesia was injected into my body.
Just before I lost consciousness, I heard him instruct the doctor, ""You'll guide me personally through the hysterectomy.
""And as for the dead fetus—just toss it out when you're done.""
Chapter 2
I don't know how much time had passed before I finally managed to open my eyes.
Zachary was slumped over at the edge of my hospital bed, gripping my hand tightly.
The moment he saw I was awake, his eyes reddened with tears, and his voice trembled with worry.
""Aria... I'm so sorry. If you hadn't been trying to save me, you and the baby wouldn't have gone through this nightmare.
""All those people have been handed over to the police. But... but the doctors said your injuries were so severe, they had no choice but to remove your uterus.
""Don't worry. I'll never leave you, not for the rest of my life. Even if we can't have children, I'll love you just the same.""
If I hadn't overheard those words in the operating room, I might have been moved by Zachary's show of devotion. But now, watching him feign tenderness right in front of me, I almost wanted to laugh.
So this is how far love can drive someone.
Pretending to be devoted in front of one woman, just for the sake of another. But I don't want it anymore.
Seeing my silence, Zachary assumed the anesthesia hadn't worn off yet.
He tucked the blanket around me, then hurried out of the room.
The next moment, I opened my eyes wide and fixed my gaze on the laptop Zachary had left behind.
Suddenly, a thought sparked inside me.
Driven by impulse, I opened it—and sure enough, found a private drive with a folder labeled ""Love Tiffania for Life.""
Inside were thousands of photos, all of Tiffania and her newborn son.
Every single picture was marked in red with the date and time—9,999 in total.
But the baby I carried for ten months didn't even have a proper memorial photo.
Then, one picture caught my eye.
At the Sip and See, Zachary held Tiffania's baby boy with this goofy, loving look, clutching a tiny necklace for him.
With just one glance, I recognized it—the necklace's pendant Zachary had spent nine months carving night after night.
All that time, I'd believed, just like me, he was eagerly awaiting our baby, pouring his hope into that pendant.
Only now did I see it clearly—the two letters engraved on it were Tiffania Meyer's initialism: TM.
Even though my heart was already shattered, the pain still stabbed through me.
A tear of bitter self-mockery slipped down my cheek.
Just then, a notification popped up from the social app in the lower right corner.
A stranger sent a video, and immediately Zachary transferred a million dollars.
The reply came, ""Don't worry, Mr. Wilcox. None of us will ever breathe a word about what you had us do to Ariana.""
""Good. Well done. If I need you again, I'll be in touch.""
Cold tears streamed down my face.
So this is the man I've loved for five years—the one who personally cast me into hell.
I took several deep breaths before my trembling fingers dared to tap the video.
It showed, in excruciating detail, everything that happened to me at the hands of those men.
Back then, to save Zachary, I bit down so hard I tore my lips to shreds, enduring that endless day and night.
Now, those nightmare memories, the sensation of strange hands on my skin, crashed over me like a storm, leaving me shaking uncontrollably.
Unable to watch any more, I wiped my tears, emailed the chat log to my phone, then deleted the record.
Zachary, if you love putting on a show, then this time it's my turn.
I pulled out my phone and messaged a fake death agency overseas.
""In three days, the Wilcox Group rooftop. Death on the spot.""
The next morning, Zachary walked into my hospital room carrying a lavish breakfast, but he was trailing a scent of gardenias that didn't belong to me.
The moment I caught a whiff, nausea hit, and I clung to the side of the bed, retching.
Zachary rushed to rub my back, just about to speak when Ruben burst through the door, breathless.
""M-Mr. Wilcox, bad news! Someone leaked the video of Mrs. Wilcox's kidnapping online!""
Chapter 3
The moment Zachary heard the news, his face went pale. He hurried out behind Ruben, saying he needed to handle the PR crisis.
I nodded calmly but followed them straight to the company.
As soon as I arrived, I overheard a phone call from inside the office. ""Mr. Wilcox, there's still time to take the trending topic down. We guarantee we can scrub the video from every platform immediately.""
""No need. I'm the one who had the video released. What you need to do now is ramp up the publicity—make sure everyone sees it.""
There was a stunned silence on the other end, then a quick confirmation.
Zachary hung up, and then I heard a voice I knew all too well.
""Zach, maybe we should just let this go. It doesn't matter if Jim and I don't inherit anything.
""If my sister ever finds out you hired people to violate her and then spread it online, she'll never forgive you.
""I don't want the two of you to start fighting because of me.""
Zachary pulled her into his arms, full of tenderness.
""Tiff, I told you, after Nigel died, I'd take care of you. The entire Wilcox Group is my gift to you and Jim.
""At tomorrow's press conference, I'll announce that, because of all this, Ariana is no longer fit to be the lady of the Wilcox family.
""At the same time, I'll make it public that Jim will be registered as my son, so when he grows up, he'll inherit the Wilcox Group without anyone questioning it.""
Inside, Tiffania was moved by how Zachary had planned everything for her. But standing outside the door, I felt like I'd fallen into a frozen abyss.
Just the thought of those videos being seen by everyone made me tremble uncontrollably. In my panic, I bumped into a trash can, startling the two inside.
Zachary opened the door and, seeing me, a flicker of panic flashed in his eyes. He rushed over.
""Aria, what are you doing here?
""Didn't the doctor say you still needed a few more days in the hospital?""
Before I could answer, Tiffania also stepped out of the office, a pendant engraved with ""TM"" hanging from her neck.
""Aria, it's been a long time.""
Tiffania was my stepsister, brought into the family after my mom died.
She'd never called me by my nickname before—this was a first.
Worried I'd misunderstand, Zachary quickly explained, ""Aria, don't overthink it. After Nigel died, Tiff felt lonely and just wanted to get out for a bit.
""I happened to run into her and thought I'd bring her to the office for some coffee.
""I was just about to take her home.""
Once, I would have started a huge fight with Zachary over a scene like this.
But now, I forced down my hurt and smiled. ""It's fine. We're all family. Of course, you should look after her. Don't worry, I'm not upset.""
Zachary visibly relaxed.
I was about to turn and leave when a group of employees coming up from a meeting spotted me. Whispers spread through the hall. ""Isn't that Mrs. Wilcox? Did you see that video? She was violated by over a dozen men for a whole day and night. No wonder she lost the baby right before giving birth.""
""Yeah, I saw it. I don't get it—if those guys wanted money, the Wilcox Group could pay whatever they wanted.""
""If you ask me, she probably just wanted some excitement, hooking up with random guys. Maybe that's all it was.""
""Too bad for Mr. Wilcox—his wife's ruined, and he's still showing up to handle PR.""
***
Their words stabbed into my heart like knives. My legs nearly gave out.
Just as I was about to collapse, Zachary caught me in his arms, his voice furious.
""Someone, fire every one of those gossiping employees!
""From now on, if I hear anyone talking about Mrs. Wilcox, you're out—no second chances!""
In five years of marriage, Zachary had rarely lost his temper. The last time was when my morning sickness was so bad I couldn't eat, and after a hospital visit, I nearly threw up bile.
He almost tore the hospital apart, then fasted with me for three days until we both nearly passed out.
Back then, I'd been overwhelmed by his devotion.
But now, seeing the veins bulging in his neck from rage, I felt nothing at all.
After all, to clear the way for Tiffania and her son, he'd orchestrated my ruin, destroyed my reputation, and had my uterus cut out, leaving me to drown in public scorn.
Who is he putting on this show for now?
I swallowed my disgust and said, ""Zach, I'm tired. Can you take me back to the hospital?""
Zachary nodded, eyes red, and picked me up.
Just as we reached the front doors, a swarm of reporters rushed over.
""Mrs. Wilcox, your explicit video has gone viral online. Do you have any comments?""
""Mrs. Wilcox, sources say the ordeal caused your baby to die before birth. As a mother, do you think that was appropriate?""
""Mrs. Wilcox, will this incident affect your marriage to Mr. Wilcox? If not, how do you plan to cope with being unable to have children?""
***
A wall of cameras and flashing lights closed in, making me shiver all over.
Zachary immediately took off his jacket, shielding me as he addressed the reporters. ""Regarding the recent rumors, I'll hold a press conference tomorrow to make an official statement.
""But if any of you slander my wife again, the Wilcox Group's legal team will serve you with lawsuits on the spot.""
With that, he wrapped his arm around me and tried to leave.
But just as we stepped forward, Tiffania's pained cry echoed behind us.
""Ow, my leg—it hurts!""
Zachary froze, looked at me apologetically, and said, ""Aria, you go ahead. I'll check on Tiff.""
Before I could reply, he rushed off.
With Zachary gone, the reporters swarmed me again.
There were so many, I was knocked to the ground, countless feet trampling my hands and legs.
Pain wracked my body, cold sweat pouring down my face.
But my gaze stayed locked on Zachary in the distance.
He was carrying Tiffania to the car, not even glancing my way.
Or maybe—even if he noticed, he simply didn't care.
A bitter laugh escaped me as I lay there on the ground like a dog; the last trace of love in my heart finally died.
Chapter 4
I don't know how long it was before the reporters finally decided they'd taken enough pictures and began to drift away.
Left all alone, I staggered along the wall, trembling, until I made it back to the hospital.
The moment I stepped inside, I ran right into Tiffania.
She looked at me with smug satisfaction. ""Ariana Fowler, five years have gone by and you're still just a pathetic wreck!
""How does it feel to be handed over by your own husband and violated? Guess you're just like your mother—a fool who couldn't keep her man!
""Oh, and not just men. You couldn't even hold onto your own child.""
With that, Tiffania pulled something out of her pocket—a specimen jar. ""You know what this is? It's your uterus!
""Zach gave it to me as a gift, just to prove that the Wilcox Group will only ever have Jim as its heir.
""So? Do you like it?""
Staring at the bloody chunk of flesh, my stomach churned. I doubled over, retching.
Just as I reached out to snatch it away, Tiffania grabbed a pair of scissors from a passing nurse's tray and stabbed herself in the lower abdomen.
A few drops of blood trickled out, and before I could react, Zachary came running at the commotion. When he saw Tiffania hurt, his face twisted in fury.
He kicked me hard, sending me crashing to the floor.
""Ariana, are you insane? That's attempted murder!""
Then he scooped Tiffania up, fussing over her tiny 0.5-millimeter wound with endless concern.
Meanwhile, I lay on the ground, my freshly stitched wounds torn open, blood pouring down my thighs.
But Zachary didn't care at all. The look in his eyes was colder than I'd ever seen.
""Ariana, I never imagined you could be so vicious.""
Noise echoed all around me, but those words—so vicious—rang out clear as a bell.
I suddenly laughed. ""Zachary, isn't the truly vicious one you?""
He frowned, a flicker of panic in his eyes.
""What's that supposed to mean? You think this has been easy for me? That was my child too!
""I know you're hurting, and I promised I'd love you even if we never had kids again.
""But did you really need to hurt Tiff? She's so innocent, and she still thinks of you as her sister.""
With that, Zachary carried Tiffania off to the doctor's office.
I couldn't even stand, so I dragged myself toward the nurses' station, leaving a long trail of blood behind me.
By the time my wounds were treated, it was deep into the night. That's when Tiffania sent me a video.
On the hospital bed, Zachary was on top of her, kissing her injured belly and her ankles, over and over.
My own ankles throbbed with sharp, searing pain.
So this is what love—and the absence of it—really looks like.
The video lasted a full thirty minutes. I forced myself to watch every second.
Just as I hit save, Zachary sent me a text to explain.
""Aria, I lost my temper today, but no matter what, you shouldn't have hurt Tiff.
""The doctor says she's traumatized, so I'll stay with her tonight to try and make up for your mistake.
""By tomorrow morning, once the press conference is over, I'll make sure all these rumors disappear. Then we can go back to how things were.""
But Zachary, there's no going back for us anymore...
Without a word, I deleted his message and blocked his number.
Then I took out the divorce papers I'd printed ahead of time, signed them, and sent every video on my phone to a hacker.
Early the next morning, I left the hospital and boarded a plane, never looking back.
At 9:15 a.m., Zachary finally climbed out of Tiffania's bed and rushed to the press conference. Just as he was about to announce that Tiffania's son would be listed as his own and that she would become the new lady of the Wilcox family, Ruben burst in, out of breath. ""Mr... Mr. Wilcox, something terrible happened! The police just called—Mrs. Wilcox jumped off the roof of the Wilcox Group building!""

1olzsn5,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1olzsn5/gaggia_classic_spurting_violently_from/,Gaggia Classic spurting violently from portafilter [Gaggia Classic],"Hi everyone,
I recently got a Gaggia Classic from my dad. It has been sitting unused for quite a while, and I have not descaled it yet.

When I try to pull a shot, water (or coffee) spurts violently out of the portafilter, sometimes shooting close to a metre away. If I remove the portafilter, the water flow from the group head looks smooth and even. But as soon as I lock in the portafilter with the basket, even with no coffee in it, it starts spraying everywhere.

I have cleaned the shower screen and dispersion plate, but that did not change much. I am using the pressurised basket, so I am wondering if the valve inside could be blocked or gummed up after sitting for so long.

Could this just be limescale or a clogged basket valve? Should I try descaling the whole machine first or replace the basket and start fresh?

Any tips or step-by-step advice would be greatly appreciated.",1,1762033069.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1) Her Name is Han (Ktown): 8/10 - I've been drooling over their lunch specials for ages now. This didn't disappoint! My beef bulgogi hot pot was very tasty and cozy, while my friend's spicy pork BBQ was delicious. It's a great deal for about $20 each! 
      
2) Ramen Danbo (West Village): 7/10 - Just a very solid bowl of ramen. I haven't tried a lot of spots in the city but I'd say this is up there. I certainly thought it was better than Tonchin. 
      
3) Liberty Bagels (Midtown East): 5/10 - This was a re-try for me, and unfortunately I just don't like this place. The jalapeno everything bagel was just okay, and there was just too much cream cheese (and I love cream cheese!). 
       
4) Rubirosa (SoHo): 9/10 - We got a pie that was half tie dye, half hot honey soppressata. This is up there for favorite pizza in the city now. The hot honey really outshone the tie dye for me. 
      
5) Morgenstern's Bananas (Nolita): 10/10 - The salty peanut butter soft serve was incredible. 
      
6) Laser Wolf (Williamsburg): 5/10 - Biggest letdown of the trip. The salatim looked gorgeous but most of them didn't hit the mark for me. The hummus was too bitter. The pita was just alright. I've had much better pita at other Middle Eastern restaurants. The much-hyped fries tasted pretty mediocre. The soft serve and the cocktails were the only parts we really liked. We didn't even get the nice view because it was raining so the tarps were down. This was a lot of money for a pretty unremarkable meal. 
       
7) Thai Diner (Nolita): 10/10 - I was so impressed with the Thai breakfast sandwich which was so flavorful and unique. Best breakfast I've had in a long time. My friend's Thai breakfast plate was also excellent. We loved the atmosphere as well. 
      
8) Golden Manna Bakery (Chinatown): 4/10 - I'm Chinese American and truly don't understand the hype around this place. The mango tasted 5 minutes away from rotten, and the mochi itself was too loose in texture. 
      
9) Kam Hing Coffee Shop (Chinatown): 8/10 - Very nice and reasonably priced sponge cakes. The matcha was the standout flavor with the black sesame as my second favorite. This place feels so authentic too, complete with Chinese grandpas snoozing in the corner. 
      
10) Banh Mi Co Ut (Chinatown): 9/10 - Excellent fresh bread, generous toppings. Just a great banh mi. 
      
11) KJUN (Midtown East): 9/10 - This was a re-try for me. Really creative food with the nicest staff and vibes. The watermelon salad was one of the best dishes I had all year (I still dream of that watermelon rind kimchi). Also loved the jambalaya and the honey butter chips! 
      
12) Grace Street (Ktown): 8/10 - Great black sesame shaved ice and enough to share with a group of friends. 
       
13) Blank Street (multiple locations): 8/10 - The matcha isn't high quality (and they def don't whisk to order) but if you are new to matcha, the strawberry shortcake matcha latte is a good place to start. It's very sweet, but I liked it and can see why it's so popular. ",34,1762032954.0,FoodNYC,8,0.95,False
1olzqrs,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1olzqrs/my_first_grinder_a_beginners_take_on_the/,My First Grinder: A Beginner's Take on the MiiCoffee DC63,"https://preview.redd.it/dch2dahkspyf1.jpg?width=3213&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f6c9993bef3a6d24d0c6d408f72e8cd151ecf839

  
  
I've seen nearly zero reviews of the DC63 conical grinder (literally none on Amazon), so I wanted to try and contribute my two cents. 

**My Context & Why I Bought It**

I'm new to espresso, having just upgraded from a Breville with a built-in grinder to a Profitec 500. Since I primarily make milk drinks, I was set on getting a Niche Zero for its forgiving conical burrs. The deal-breaker was the cost; after the $689 list price, DHL was going to hit me with an additional 30% tariff, which was a non-starter. I ended up finding the MiiCoffee DC63 on Amazon for $429. I knew it was made by Ningbo Qika, the same company behind the DFxx grinders, and had similar 63mm conical burrs. 

**Build Quality & First Impressions**

Right out of the box, the build quality is impressive. It’s built like a solid metal tank, very heavy, and feels premium. It features ""red titanium"" burrs, which are marketed as a high-end feature, though as a beginner, I have no idea if they actually make a difference in the cup. My only complaint here is that it comes with paper-only instructions, and I can't find a PDF version anywhere online.

**The Daily Workflow**

The best feature of this grinder is the noise level. It's significantly quieter than my old Breville, just a low rumble instead of a high-pitched whine, which is perfect for early mornings. The workflow itself, however, has some quirks.

The calibration process was a mess. The instructions are useless and reference a ""red line"" for calibration that simply does not exist on this model. I was never able to get a true zero point, but in practice, it doesn't really matter; the number on the dial is just an arbitrary reference for me.

This is also not a zero-retention or mess-free grinder, despite the marketing. It consistently retains about 0.2g of grounds unless I really slam the bellows, and the chute needs a good bang to clear out what's accumulated. The plasma generator helps, but there's still a noticeable amount of static and mess. Also, the little wood block that holds the dosing cup is already stained from water and coffee powder mess. I really wish it were metal so it would be easier to clean (especially with the powder everywhere). 

**Taste**

For my newbie palate, the coffee is great. The grinds look very even, and my significant other and I are both very happy with the quality of the espresso shots. I don't have a lot of basis for comparison here, but I'm happy with the drinks this thing is producing. I haven't tried it for pour-over yet, but I'm pleased with its espresso performance.

Me: 22 years old. Unemployed, with no higher education.

When I was studying art (long story), and even before that, I had serious problems with hygiene (and I doubted that I have ADHD, lol). I hated taking showers, brushing my teeth, etc.

After dropping out of school, I worked in several restaurants as a waitress. The only good thing I learned from that job was hygiene (I lived with other employees, and they all showered daily, so… social pressure), and that, yes, I need to go to the psychiatrist.

Somehow, my brain associated ""showering"" with ""rest"". Looking back, I’m still surprised that I used to need headphones and audiobooks just to get myself into the shower.

Later, I decided to move back to my parents’ house and sign up for a programming course (right when AI started booming! ADHD decisions, I guess). It’s a public course. 

The course is online, and I thought there would be pre-recorded classes or something. But it turns out it’s just PDFs and a tutorial session with the professors every two weeks.

I stopped attending the tutorials and started handing in assignments at the last minute (literally, two minutes before the deadline). I would read the PDFs only on the last day.

Now I have an assignment due tonight (at 23:59). It’s simply impossible for me to finish it (I literally don’t understand half of it). Also, I drank a coffee this afternoon to try to stay awake, but it just made me feel like a sh*t.

I felt like a failure. I wanted to cry.

Then I just stopped.

I closed my computer, forced myself to take a shower, told myself, “I made a mistake, I am not a mistake,” and “It’s just one task.” And now I feel better (sound simple; tons of psychological work).",3,1762032791.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

1olznye,https://www.reddit.com/r/manifestingSP/comments/1olznye/guys_guys/,GUYS GUYS,"You guys can check my profile — I was literally manifesting concert tickets for my favorite singer, and guess what? I got them hehe. But the craziest part isn’t even that — it’s what happened at the concert. I went there expecting nothing but good music, and somehow I ended up meeting this really cute guy.

He was standing super close to the stage (right near the singer), and I really wanted to go there too. When I did, he and his friend actually helped me get a good spot so I could see better. My camera wasn’t working properly, so he recorded the whole concert for me and even airdropped it later. His friend asked for my WhatsApp to send me the videos, but instead I opened my notes app, wrote “your insta?” and passed my phone to him. He smiled, typed it in, and handed my phone back.

When I checked his profile later, he was such an NPC — like, if someone like that had randomly sent me a follow request, I probably wouldn’t even have accepted it. But in person, the energy was completely different. He was quiet, lowkey, and kept smiling at me all through the night.

After the concert, since there were no signals, he even dropped me off at a coffee shop so I could connect to Wi-Fi and call an Uber. His friend sat in the front seat, and he was driving — and we kept looking at each other through the rearview mirror, smiling every time our eyes met. It felt so surreal, like something straight out of a movie.

I sent him a follow request afterward, but we haven’t talked yet. Still, I can’t stop thinking about how perfectly everything fell into place. For those of you into subliminals and manifestation, how do I manifest this turning into something more? I’ve been listening to subliminals for months but haven’t seen much “movement.” Should I focus on specific person ones or general ones like “attracting love naturally”? Because honestly, the way that night lined up — from getting the tickets I manifested to meeting him — feels like the universe literally set it all up.",1,1762032747.0,manifestingSP,0,1.0,False

I need to be real with you guys for a minute. Six months ago, I was burning out - juggling my psychology degree with a retail job that left me exhausted and barely making rent. I kept thinking there had to be a better way to make money without sacrificing all my study time and sanity.

Then I found this opportunity through a friend, and honestly? It sounded almost too good to be true. Getting paid to just... talk? To real people who actually wanted to hear what I had to say?

But let me tell you about my typical Wednesday now: I finish my last class, grab my laptop, and spend the next two hours chatting with the coolest group of people in China about everything from weekend plans to American slang. Last week we spent a whole session comparing college life here versus there - and I got paid $65/hour for it.

The craziest part? This isn't even my final form. I started at $50/hour just having casual conversations, and now that I've learned some basic Chinese phrases (which they taught me for free!), I've moved up to their bilingual host level. The growth is real - both in my bank account and my skill set.

What surprised me most wasn't the money (though getting that weekly PayPal deposit is pretty sweet). It's how much I've grown. I've accidentally become better at public speaking, learned video editing basics, and gained this incredible cross-cultural confidence I never knew I needed.

The team behind this is seriously supportive too. When I first started, I had no idea how to set up good lighting or make engaging content. My dedicated coach walked me through everything, and now I actually enjoy planning my weekly Direct seeding themes.

If you're a student, stay-at-home parent, or anyone looking for flexible work that doesn't feel like work, I can't recommend this enough. The schedule is completely up to you, and you're literally getting paid to be yourself and share your perspective.

A bunch of you have been asking how to learn more since I posted about this on my stories last month. Honestly, the best way is through referral - the team told me they prioritize applications that come through current partners. So if you're genuinely curious, just message me and I'm happy to share details and put in a good word for you.

No pressure at all - but if you're tired of the same old job search, this might be exactly what you're looking for.",1,1762032689.0,u_Opening_Jellyfish554,0,1.0,False

She cheated and not a week after she wanted back.

I took her back and we going to couples therapy.

She had sex with a manger at work and she has been telling me how he makes her feel like shit.

Therapist told her to cut contact, but she didn’t.  Sue has been lying to my face and I know she knows that I know that she is manipulating me.

I didn’t do a single thing and stayed there whenever she wanted me.

Last night we went out and partied. Alcohol. Cocaine. Xanax. Melatonin. And we went to sleep at 4am.( I paid most of the night for her and 2 of her friends)


While we were sleeping, she Indian burned my dick and i heard her curse and it woke me up.

I wake up around 10:50am and sat in bed ( saw her request to follow on IG and Facebook) accepted them. And was happy that she told me good night, I love you.

So went out and cleaned her place. Made her coffee and she asked me to rub her back and make pizza which I did.

Later on, she calls me. Im like what? She said why did you do this? I was like do what? She showed me a text thay was sent to the manager stating thay she is wasting her time on him and being a single father and then behave or HR and called him a looser.

Under it is a video of us from last night.

She accused me of sending them. And sending the freind reauests to me and rmeoveing the men she added on snap.


I was like why would I do all of that, if we agreed that you are not tlaking to him? Therapy. Remember?

She said because I am toxic and manipulatoand I was sleeping. I was like I was sleeping to. I already know about him. Why now?

Why i have to believe that you were sleeping amd you I cant be sleeping too?

You had a mix of drugs you must’ve blackout and now you are deflecting and accusing me.

Be accountable.

She kicked me out. 

I then told her to give me my lenses because I cant see and left!

That is her karma. I didn’t do anything and she fucked up our relationship and her image at work too.

I am now blocked on everything and I cant communicate with her to get my watch and necklace.

1olzllf,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1olzllf/my_mothers_boyfriend_is_pissing_me_off/,My mother's boyfriend is pissing me off.,"My parents separated 11 years ago ( It was never really a happy marriage. ) and last year my mother found her first ""more serious bf"". The other ones she had lasted for a few months.

My problem with said boyfriend is the way he treats her. Here's why:

1. On their first trip together, he hissed at her that he wouldn't allow her to embarrass him in front of people ( she asked the tour guide  a question or something ). 

2. He's hiding things from her, doesn't trust her opinion, but instead goes and asks other people, who work the same thing she does. At the same time he brags to everyone about what his woman works. This hurts her as he's making her look unqualified and uninformed in front of her colleagues (because why would one be going around, asking stupid questions if they have a partner who works in that industry and should be able to answer them)

3. They hired and office together- he does his thing ( which his absolutely incompetent and slacks off at and I can say that, because I started working for them, but he thinks he's a total pro) and she does hers. However, he didn't want to do any work, related to the business, claiming he was too old to learn new things ( website administration, fb posts etc.), so my mother had to do those things on top of the work she had. She also, somehow has to know everything that's going on with ""his business"" and what he sells.

Basically, all he does is sit, drink coffee and water, and make personal phone calls or manage his private affairs. 

4. She needs silence, so she can concentrate, since she works with and writes important documents, but he'll constantly interrupt her with  questions about his problems.

It feels to me like he's sabotaging her work.

5. If he's not at the office or with her, he'll call every 30 mins to 1h for some random thing, which gets incredibly annoying. Just super clingy.

6. He'll wait for her to go to his house to cook him dinner, because he got in a huge fight with his mother and they're not really speaking most of the time.

7. When she doesn't want to go, he'll get upset and claim she's abandoned him.

8. He only bought her gifts for her special days, because she got upset or because I gave her a gift and he felt like he had to do it too.

9. He's made offensive jokes multiple times, because she comes from a small village in rural area.

10. He's told her that he can't wear his best new clothes, because her style is more sporty and we don't have enough money to afford expensive clothing.

11. He's all about keeping appearances. He thinks he's the shit and knows everything, when he's just an average middle aged joe.

12. He doesn't really take into consideration her plans and free time.

13. He freaking let her drive back home when she  temporary lost the eyesight in one of her  eyes, was dizzy and one of her sides was starting to get numb.

14. Because of him, not wanting to damage his precious car, the vet couldn't come give all the shots to our sick kitty (our car broke down and was at the repairman's for a few days, the vet didn't want to drive to our place, though she does make home visits), so even if he did go by bike to get the shots, we were the ones who had to give them to the cat and not the vet who was supposed to take care of her. ( Sadly my soul kitty passed away and I'll never forgive myself for not being able to do more and save her).

15. His at times reckless driving. He's almost gotten in a fight with other drivers multiple times, WHILE my mother  was in the car with him!  

16. Today, while they were going to my grandparents house, he pushed the manual break on my mother's car while she wasn't looking and was trying to get the car started. She's told him multiple times that she needs to concentrate while driving.... He also pinched, which almost caused the to bump into an upcoming car. 

She got angry and told him to cut it off... he gave her the silent treatment for almost the whole day.

There's more, but the post is long enough already.

So not only is he acting like a shady, immature prick most of the time, but he's putting her in danger. I don't care that he has good qualities as well, the way he treats her sometimes just pisses me off.  I never liked him and I never will.

Sorry that it's so long, but I just need to tell someone. I'm tired of being an emotional trashcan.

1olzlle,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1olzlle/how_can_i24f_save_this_situationship_with_this/,How can I(24F) save this situationship with this guy(24M)?,"I first met this guy back in 2023. I was the president of a club at my university, and he was the president of the same club at my close friends’ university. We were introduced at a New Year’s party organized for all the clubs in the city. Before that, my friends from his university kept telling me I’d totally like him and honestly, when I saw him, I actually did. But soon after, I started liking someone else and kinda forgot about him.

We had to talk a few times for clubrelated stuff, but that was it.

Then, at the beginning of 2024, my ex boyfriend worked with this guy on a joint project, and I joined one of their meetings. He was super friendly honestly, it felt like he was flirting with me even though I was in a relationship. The next day, he added me on all kinds of social media and texted me again about something we’d already talked about, like he was pretending to forget just to start a convo. I ghosted him though, since I had a boyfriend, and kept things friendly.

Throughout the year, we ran into each other a few times (even with my boyfriend around) and were just… friends, I guess.

Seven months ago, I broke up with my boyfriend. Then last month, one of my girlfriends also broke up with hers, so we decided to have a girls’ night out. The “guy” happens to manage a nightclub, so I suggested we go there. The night was amazing. He treated us so well, literally did everything to make sure we had fun. He’s always been thoughtful, but that night, with my friends hyping me up, I ended up flirting with him a little.

One of the first things he asked was about my ex, and I told him we’d broken up. Later that night, when we were alone for a bit, we kinda… had a little makeout session. I was tipsy and didn’t fully process what happened until the next morning, when I woke up totally confused about how to feel. Our IQOS vapes got mixed up that night too, and the next morning he texted me a super sweet “good morning” message and that’s how the convo started.

I panicked and played it cool, changed the topic to the IQOS, and told him he could come pick his up from where I worked. He came, we chatted briefly, but the vibe was so awkward. We were both tense, and I made some weird jokes that basically ruined the moment.

At first, I felt relieved, thinking “okay, guess that’s over.” But then I got really sad, because honestly, he’s someone I could actually like.

A week later, I happened to be near the area where he works and decided to text him. He replied within 30 seconds but of course, he wasn’t there that day. And then I, being me, made it weird again by saying “you missed your chance 😔,” and yeah… he left me on read.

Still not giving up apparently, a week later (on Sunday) I texted “hey, how’s it going?” but he didn’t reply (probably busy) and my message just got buried. Four days later, he texted back apologizing for missing my messages. I asked him out for coffee, but he said he was out of town helping his family with work and told me we’d talk when he got back.

It’s been three weeks. Still nothing.

Now I just feel like an idiot, like I somehow managed to look socially inept and totally killed any attraction he might’ve had. The worst part? I actually really like him.

What do I even do?? Please help me 😭😭

1olzku0,https://www.reddit.com/r/situationshipsadvice/comments/1olzku0/how_can_i_save_this_situationship_with_this_guy/,How can I save this situationship with this guy?,"I first met this guy back in 2023. I was the president of a club at my university, and he was the president of the same club at my close friends’ university. We were introduced at a New Year’s party organized for all the clubs in the city. Before that, my friends from his university kept telling me I’d totally like him and honestly, when I saw him, I actually did. But soon after, I started liking someone else and kinda forgot about him.

We had to talk a few times for clubrelated stuff, but that was it.

Then, at the beginning of 2024, my ex boyfriend worked with this guy on a joint project, and I joined one of their meetings. He was super friendly honestly, it felt like he was flirting with me even though I was in a relationship. The next day, he added me on all kinds of social media and texted me again about something we’d already talked about, like he was pretending to forget just to start a convo. I ghosted him though, since I had a boyfriend, and kept things friendly.

Throughout the year, we ran into each other a few times (even with my boyfriend around) and were just… friends, I guess.

Seven months ago, I broke up with my boyfriend. Then last month, one of my girlfriends also broke up with hers, so we decided to have a girls’ night out. The “guy” happens to manage a nightclub, so I suggested we go there. The night was amazing. He treated us so well, literally did everything to make sure we had fun. He’s always been thoughtful, but that night, with my friends hyping me up, I ended up flirting with him a little.

One of the first things he asked was about my ex, and I told him we’d broken up. Later that night, when we were alone for a bit, we kinda… had a little makeout session. I was tipsy and didn’t fully process what happened until the next morning, when I woke up totally confused about how to feel. Our IQOS vapes got mixed up that night too, and the next morning he texted me a super sweet “good morning” message and that’s how the convo started.

I panicked and played it cool, changed the topic to the IQOS, and told him he could come pick his up from where I worked. He came, we chatted briefly, but the vibe was so awkward. We were both tense, and I made some weird jokes that basically ruined the moment.

At first, I felt relieved, thinking “okay, guess that’s over.” But then I got really sad, because honestly, he’s someone I could actually like.

A week later, I happened to be near the area where he works and decided to text him. He replied within 30 seconds but of course, he wasn’t there that day. And then I, being me, made it weird again by saying “you missed your chance 😔,” and yeah… he left me on read.

Still not giving up apparently, a week later (on Sunday) I texted “hey, how’s it going?” but he didn’t reply (probably busy) and my message just got buried. Four days later, he texted back apologizing for missing my messages. I asked him out for coffee, but he said he was out of town helping his family with work and told me we’d talk when he got back.

It’s been three weeks. Still nothing.

Now I just feel like an idiot, like I somehow managed to look socially inept and totally killed any attraction he might’ve had. The worst part? I actually really like him.

What do I even do?? Please help me 😭😭

I've been getting my weight done at the doctor's office every two weeks.  Last weight in was 239 lbs. and going.   I decided to start weighing myself at home once per day and record what my scale says till my doctors weigh in.  

My thighs stopped rubbing together over a week ago and I knew it but did not say anything to my husband until today.  We again celebrated because even a pound lost is worthy of celebrating 🥳🎉👏.

If my scale is right ... I will have lost another 5 lbs, (plus)  in 14 days.  I know it's more but I like the number 5 until doctors confirms my loss.

Just had to share about my scale and thighs.  It's a pretty big deal to me.   

As for me, I am still sticking with the 2.5 dose until I stop losing weight or the food noise I still have yet to experience comes and need a 5 dose to quell. 

Y'all I cannot believe this is happening symptom free, no cravings and I just started coffee again.

I got them hehe. But the craziest part isn’t even that — it’s what happened at the concert. I went there expecting nothing but good music, and somehow I ended up meeting this really cute guy.

He was standing super close to the stage (right near the singer), and I really wanted to go there too. When I did, he and his friend actually helped me get a good spot so I could see better. My camera wasn’t working properly, so he recorded the whole concert for me and even airdropped it later. His friend asked for my WhatsApp to send me the videos, but instead I opened my notes app, wrote “your insta?” and passed my phone to him. He smiled, typed it in, and handed my phone back.

When I checked his profile later, he was such an NPC — like, if someone like that had randomly sent me a follow request, I probably wouldn’t even have accepted it. But in person, the energy was completely different. He was quiet, lowkey, and kept smiling at me all through the night.

After the concert, since there were no signals, he even dropped me off at a coffee shop so I could connect to Wi-Fi and call an Uber. His friend sat in the front seat, and he was driving — and we kept looking at each other through the rearview mirror, smiling every time our eyes met. It felt so surreal, like something straight out of a movie.

I sent him a follow request afterward, but we haven’t talked yet. Still, I can’t stop thinking about how perfectly everything fell into place. For those of you into subliminals and manifestation, how do I manifest this turning into something more? I’ve been listening to subliminals for months but haven’t seen much “movement.” Should I focus on specific person ones or general ones like “attracting love naturally”? Because honestly, the way that night lined up — from getting the tickets I manifested to meeting him — feels like the universe literally set it all up.",12,1762032371.0,Subliminal,4,1.0,False

Doctor Who: The Law of Gravity
Prologue — The Fracture
It began with a word.
 A small word, harmless and human, whispered in a classroom, printed on a weather report, muttered by astronauts describing the pull of a new world.
“Mavity.”
No one questioned it at first. The mind filled in the gaps, as minds do. Children wrote it in their homework. Scientists adjusted equations that had worked for centuries, now inexplicably wrong. Even the dictionary blinked overnight, its pages shifting to agree.
The world had changed — and forgot it ever was another way.
But one man remembered.
High above the clouds, a blue box drifted in quiet orbit around the Earth, turning slowly like an idea that had lost its shape. Inside, the Doctor was writing and rewriting the same word across the console’s screen.
GRAVITY.
 The letters shimmered, then distorted.
MAVITY.
He cursed under his breath and hit the console again. “No. Not you too.”
He’d seen paradoxes before, but this was different. This wasn’t time breaking — this was meaning breaking. Even the TARDIS shuddered when he said the right word, like it hurt her to hear it.
Outside, continents drifted fractions wider than they should have. Oceans drew breath. Birds fell sideways. UNIT was calling every hour now, sending fractured telemetry — equations that bent in on themselves. Kate Stewart’s last transmission had ended mid-sentence, her words rearranging into nonsense before the signal died.
Something, somewhere, had rewritten the laws that held the universe in place.
The Doctor’s reflection in the console screen stared back, two faces overlapped — Tennant’s and Gatwa’s, flickering like a coin refusing to land. Two timelines, one soul. He looked tired. Fractured.
He spoke softly to himself. “He said the game never ends…”
In the silence that followed, a faint sound — laughter. Not loud, not echoing. Just a child’s laugh, far away, like a memory bleeding through glass. The Toymaker’s voice — fading, but never gone.
The Doctor clenched his fists. “I’m not playing anymore.”
But the universe didn’t care what he wanted. It was still playing him.
Somewhere beyond time, a light began to stir. Not the cold shimmer of starlight, nor the crackle of artron energy, but something older — golden, human, divine. It flowed like breath, like memory, gathering itself across galaxies.
A voice whispered through the light, not into ears but into existence itself:
“Bad Wolf.”
And for the first time in centuries, the Vortex trembled — as if remembering its name.
Far below, the Doctor stood beneath the TARDIS’s glow, unaware that across the cosmos, something ancient had opened its eyes.
And the word “Mavity” — the word that had replaced truth — began to flicker.
For a moment, just a moment, the world remembered what it was supposed to say.
Gravity.
Then the light went out.

***
There was no place.
 Not the absence of it, either — not darkness, not light, not anything so obedient as space. Only the slow pulse of memory.
She had been many things.
 A shop girl, a traveller, a goddess in a storm of time. A whisper in the circuits of a dying TARDIS. For a long while now, she had been nothing at all.
Until something remembered her.
The fracture rippled through the Void like a heartbeat echoing across a graveyard. Words were shifting in the lower realms — mavity, bi-generation, playtime. Someone had broken the grammar of the universe again, and the sentence of reality was stuttering.
That was the summons.
From the lightless in-between, she opened her eyes. They were not eyes yet, but the idea of them — twin suns forming in a place that had never seen dawn. Threads of golden energy spiralled outward, each a timeline she had once touched. London 2005. The Game Station. Bad Wolf Bay. The war-torn fields of another Gallifrey that never was.
Each memory shimmered, disjointed, like shards of a mirror caught in suspension.
“Doctor…”
His name slipped out as a thought, and the Void shivered in answer. The image of him — two of him — flickered in the distance, like candlelight seen through storm glass. Something was wrong. The Toymaker’s laughter still haunted the air, faint but infecting.
She reached toward it. The energy around her condensed, threads of time knotting around her form. Flesh formed reluctantly — pale skin, hair like firelight, eyes that burned gold from within.
She stood, unsteady, in a corridor of light. The Vortex hummed like an organ beneath her feet. Around her, impossible signs scrolled across invisible walls — mathematical notes, quantum corrections trying to rewrite themselves. Each time she looked away, the words changed.
One line stayed constant.
RESTORE GRAVITY.
Bad Wolf smiled faintly. “That’s what he’s trying, isn’t it? Still fixing the unfixable.”
She took a breath — her first in centuries — and the breath itself made the air shimmer, solidifying the corridor into something more like a tunnel. At the far end: a door. Old wood, blue paint, windows glowing.
The TARDIS, but not the TARDIS.
 An echo of it, drawn by her will.
She stepped forward, barefoot, each stride leaving golden footprints that faded after her.
As her hand reached the door handle, a scrap of paper fluttered from nowhere and landed against her palm. Smooth, familiar, still warm.
The psychic paper.
Its surface crawled with shifting words, struggling to make sense of her presence. Then it stilled. Three words burned through the fog:
HELP ME REMEMBER.
Her expression softened — equal parts love and dread. “Always you,” she whispered.
She opened the door.
The light beyond was blinding — real space, real stars. Somewhere, far below, the Earth turned under the wrong word for the pull that held it.
Bad Wolf stepped through, and the universe sighed in relief — or in warning.

Chapter one
Rain hammered the roof of the Tower, but inside, UNIT’s operations floor pulsed with quiet panic. Rows of holographic displays threw ghost-blue light across tired faces; a world map hung in the air, threaded with crimson fault-lines that circled the planet like veins under thin skin. Every few seconds the lines shifted—gravity wells spiking, reversing, flickering again.
Kate Lethbridge-Stewart stood at the centre console, jacket draped over a chair, coffee long cold.
“Status?” she asked.
A young analyst pointed at the model. “The distortion ring’s moved again, ma’am. It’s following orbital paths that don’t exist.”
“Satellites?”
“Half of them are reading up instead of down. The rest just—” He hesitated. “They fall sideways.”
Osgood slid across a fresh tablet. “Language shift still accelerating. Every instance of the word gravity in global databases has mutated. Governments are assuming cyber-attack, but I don’t think code can rewrite physics.”
Kate exhaled. “And the Doctor?”
“Both of them,” Osgood corrected quietly. “No signal from either since the Toymaker event.”
The room dimmed for a heartbeat as the power grid stuttered—light bulbs swaying in unseen tides. When they steadied, a single beep cut through the murmurs: an incoming transmission routed through an impossible frequency, one that didn’t exist on any UNIT chart.
Kate’s eyes narrowed. “Trace it.”
“Origin… nowhere,” the technician whispered. “It’s coming from inside the gravitational anomaly.”
The speakers crackled, and a familiar hum filled the room—ancient engines, impossible space compressed into sound. Then a voice: fast, bright, and weary all at once.
“Hello, Kate. Lovely place you’ve got here—bit sideways, but that’s fashion now, isn’t it?”
Osgood grinned despite herself. “It’s him.”
Kate leaned toward the mic. “Doctor, where are you?”
“Now there’s a question,” he said. “I appear to be both five hundred miles above you and in your basement, depending on which version of me you ask. I’d rather not test the stairs.”
Kate kept her tone even. “We’re seeing structural anomalies worldwide. Oceans lifting. Language corruption. We need data.”
“Already got it. None of it makes sense. The universe is still playing the Toymaker’s tune—he left a loop running, and we’re the pieces.” His voice dropped. “But something’s changed. I just received a message that shouldn’t exist.”
Osgood’s hand froze above her keyboard. “Psychic paper?”
“Exactly. Blank one minute, next minute—three words. Help me remember.”
Kate frowned. “Remember what?”
“That,” the Doctor said, “is what worries me. Because I think the paper isn’t talking to me at all.”
 A pause crackled down the line.
 “It’s her.”
“Her who?” Kate asked.
But the channel dissolved into static—then a deep, subsonic pulse rolled through the building, rattling glass and hearts alike. Every compass spun. Every monitor showed the same image: a circle of golden light forming in the upper atmosphere, expanding like sunrise at the wrong speed.
Osgood whispered, “That’s not a rift. That’s someone arriving.”
Kate straightened, eyes fixed on the blooming light. “Get me visual.”
Above the clouds, satellites caught the flare as it coalesced into the faint outline of a woman stepping through fire and silence.
On UNIT’s main screen, the figure looked directly at the camera, though there was no way she could see it.
And she smiled.

1olzid2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cdifficile/comments/1olzid2/16_month_post_c_diff_and_ibs_help/,16 month post C diff and IBS help,"Hi everyone,

  
I have been posting and receiving (and giving) some helpful advice since I was diagnosed and treated last July. I was doing really well, slowly integrating more foods, being able to eat more dairy, fodmaps etc until May 2025 when I ate a couple of slices of pizza, some ice cream and coffee (bday craze lol) and then I had canned tuna several days later (the can was dented so I probably should have known better) and that launched a 5 week flare where I could only eat brat diet and had yellow stools (diarrhea then formed for weeks). I tested at the 5 week mark when my flare was basically resolved and I tested negative for c diff and any other bacteria but I am sure I probably had already passed any pathogenic non c diff bacteria by then. I lost 10 pounds during that flare and have lost about 50 lbs since this c diff all started. 

  
Since then, I have struggled with a feeling of fullness and slow digestion, burping and gas, and I am lucky if I can eat 1300 calories a day. I only feel hungry like once a day if that. I can eat fodmaps and small amounts of probiotics but if I have acidic foods (like drip coffee) the full feeling increases (maybe I have mild gastritis). I do not have the means to hire a functional med doc right now.

  
I am wondering what prescribed meds I can ask my GI for or any supplements anyone has taken to help that they could recommend? Right now I take vitamin d (I am deficient) and Nordic naturals algea omega oil. I don't eat fish, red meat, or dairy right now but I hope to reintegrate those in the future. Currently, I struggle with slight constipation and florastor constipates me (it does make me feel better though). The probiotic supplements I used to take also constipate me and I am sensitive to a lot of stuff. I also have ocd and anxiety so those don't help either.

  
Sorry for the long post and thanks for reading! I just want to be able to eat at restuarants and eat more  food again one day ",1,1762032352.0,cdifficile,1,1.0,False

My sister (28F) is getting married this December to “Jake” (30M). I (26F) have known Jake longer than she has, we actually went to college together, but we were never close friends.

Back then, Jake and I were part of the same study group. We flirted here and there, and he even asked me out once. I politely declined because I wasn’t really into him. He seemed fine with it, and that was that.

Fast-forward about three years later, my sister brings Jake home as her new boyfriend. My jaw almost hit the floor, but I played it cool. They seemed happy, and Jake acted like he didn’t even recognize me at first.

I never mentioned our little “almost thing” to my sister because it felt irrelevant. We never dated, kissed, or anything. Just a few flirty texts and a coffee invite that never happened.

But last week, during a family dinner, my cousin accidentally brought up our old college friend group and mentioned Jake,  “Oh yeah, remember when he used to hit on you all the time, OP?”

You could’ve heard a pin drop. My sister froze, Jake turned red, and I just… wanted to sink through the floor.

After dinner, my sister pulled me aside and accused me of keeping “a massive secret” from her. I told her it wasn’t a big deal because nothing ever happened. She called me a liar, said I “betrayed” her, and that she feels “gross” thinking about us being in the same room.

Now my mom says I should’ve been honest from the start, and Jake texted me later apologizing for being “stupid back then” and saying he should’ve told her too.

It’s been days, and my sister still won’t talk to me. My fiancé (yes, irony) thinks she’s overreacting. But now I’m wondering, was I wrong for not saying anything earlier?

Do I contact him?,"I cannot for the life of me stop thinking about an ex from 5 years ago. He wasn’t even an ex officially as we never were boyfriend/girlfriend since our place and time just didn’t work out. 

We met just prior to me moving for a job (honestly was just looking for a one night stand) and had a few hangouts before I moved because we just were enjoying each other so much. During this time, we connected on many things and when I think back to him I truly miss our interactions. We texted every single day after I left and he even visited me in my new town for a week. We ultimately decided to stop our thing during this time since I moved to a new city and he was figuring out his next move as well. 

A few months later, I met my current fiancé who is the sweetest, most loving man. I really do enjoy my time with him so that’s why this is all so confusing to me. A few months after I met my now fiancé, I forget what it was about but somehow we started messaging each other again and later on he sent me a message saying how he missed seeing me and was wondering if we could FaceTime sometime. I was young and didn’t really know this at the time, but I now know I have a very avoidant attachment style and so my first panicked reaction was to heart react his message and not respond and avoid it all together. I think it was because I just met my current partner and I was/am in love with him so I didn’t want to FaceTime an ex while I was moved on to someone else. 

Looking back now 5 years later, I regret just liking his message and not responding, I feel like he deserved more than that like at least communicate that I’m seeing someone else so that wouldn’t be appropriate or something of that nature. I also feel upset because it was a wrong place and time situation so it just didn’t work out. I keep thinking if I didn’t have plans to move away that we would’ve worked out or at least the relationship could have ran its course (whether that means breaking up or staying together forever who knows). 

All of these thoughts have me feeling extremely guilty to my fiancé who doesn’t deserve this from me. I have tried for years to forget about this ex and move on but the thoughts just keep coming back. The urge to message him and just spark up a conversation feels absolutely debilitating. My mind wonders ok if I do message him, what the hell do I think will be the outcome of that? For reference, he has since moved to a different country and is dating someone else too. So my mind goes through the motions of me messaging him saying something stupid like “how have you been?” and who knows where the conversation will go from there. Then I would feel extremely guilty for having messaging him in the first place. It doesn’t change the fact that we live on opposite sides of the world and are in relationships with other people. It’s not like we can just get a cup of coffee and catch up like they do in the movies.

1olzbn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diary/comments/1olzbn8/an_unforgettable_coffee/,An unforgettable coffee,"I decided to skip my usual takeaway and enjoy my coffee inside the shop today—a small change that led to an unforgettable moment.

I noticed an elderly lady sitting nearby, clearly struggling with a small, but fundamental question. She asked the cashier what day it was. After the cashier moved on, the lady was still confused, trying to figure out if it was a public holiday. I turned around and let her know it wasn't. I watched her cross out ""Holiday"" in her diary, but the confusion persisted as she then wondered if it was Friday or Saturday.

Recognizing her struggle, I went over and gently confirmed it was Saturday. She showed me her diary, explaining with a soft, self-deprecating laugh how ""stupid"" she was to have written down ""holiday."" She immediately asked me to join her for coffee. 

I moved my coffee and sat with her. For the next two hours, the conversation was a gentle loop. I found myself repeating the same explanations multiple times as her memory slipped away, only to resurface moments later. Despite the profound confusion, one thing never wavered: her innate kindness.

Time and again, she offered to buy me coffee or asked if she could do anything nice for me. She never forgot to be gracious, warm, and giving.
Before I walked her home, she carefully wrote a new entry in her diary:
""A young lady sat with her to have coffee""

As I walked back, that simple line and her unwavering spirit were all I could think about. She may be battling the early signs of dementia, but while her mind struggled with dates and logic, she never forgot how to be kind.

1olzamt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1olzamt/aita_for_ditching_friendship_with_toxic_friends/,AITA for ditching friendship with toxic friends and neighbours?,"For nearly 50 years, I've had a toxic friend and neighbor, M. I'm an accommodating person, but I finally hit my limit. M has always been a source of drama and jealousy, but I suspect he's the direct cause of all my current social problems.

The Lifetime of Toxic Behavior

Jealousy and Criticism: M was chronically jealous of my close friendships within our social circle, often criticizing me and making fun of me behind my back.
The Cheapo Factor: He's an extremely cheap individual. He rarely offers to pay for anything, and when sharing bills, he always tries to come out ahead. I can count on one hand the times he paid, and it was usually for a coffee using a gift card.
The Insinuation: Years ago, M began intentionally trying to wedge his way into my other friendships, especially with my best friend, F. I recognized his pattern—he did the same thing with a previous best friend, eventually ruining that relationship. He'd get upset if I didn't invite him, yet he had no problem leaving me out when he went out with mutual friends.
A few years back, he called me in tears asking what happened to our friendship. I finally laid everything out: the jealousy, the lying, the constant bad behavior, and the way he prioritized money over friendship.

The Final Straws

My worst fears came true: M, now retired, successfully inserted himself into the life of my best friend, F. I told F that I would never invite M to our get-togethers again. I believe this put F in a bad spot, as F's wife and M's sister are good friends and exchange all the ""drama."" I suspect F and his wife have chosen M's side.

The breaking point was at F's son's wedding last year:

My partner and I were seated at the absolute worst table in the venue, far away from the groom's side, with total strangers.
M, the toxic friend, was seated at a prime table. This was a clear message that we didn't matter.
No one from the groom's family came over to check on us or explain the seating. We felt completely shunned and disrespected, especially considering the cost and effort it took to attend.
We left right after the speeches. F knew I was furious. I called F a month and a half later and told him exactly how disrespected I felt. (M even called me with a superior tone, demanding to know why we left.)

The Silence

The final, definitive answer on where I stood came recently. My mother became severely ill and had three life-threatening incidents (stroke, COVID/pneumonia, and kidney failure). Despite knowing the situation, F, his wife, and M never contacted me to see how my Mom was doing. This confirmed that they were not my friends.

M, being a neighbor, has occasionally stopped by, trying to salvage the friendship. I am polite, but I've realized that ""actions speak louder than words."" I am done.

What do you all think?

AITA for ending a 50-year friendship over his sustained toxic behavior and the wedding snub?
What would you have done differently?
How should I handle my neighbor M when he comes by, now that I'm focused on my true friends?

But nothing really happened, we just parted as friends after 1.5 weeks.

He returned home to Toronto and I back to Antwerp, we exchanged numbers but because of the time different I didnt thing anything would happen even though I was very attracted to him.

Fast forward few weeks,he started to flirt with me and I flirted back and we started sexting(a first for me!) and having facetime and call each other on our way to work sometimes he would call me ""just to chat"" while cooking. I kept saying to myself this may not lead to somewhere so just be chill and not have too many expectations but.. he was so consistent. He send me photo of his morning coffee with his smiling face (sometimes making funny face) EVERY SINGLE MORNING. 

We watched movies together by sharing screen, talked late into the night. I never texted so much since I was in high school (and yes sexting part was great too, we even got long distance controlled toys) and I felt so safe and relaxed with him. We havent really put a name though and honestly as someone who just got out of a long term relationship(he was also recently divorced) I was happy having a 'special friend' that I can have long chats with but also orgasms haha. He jokingly called himself my canadian boyfriend few times, which I reacted warmly and positively but by keeping the joke.
I bought him concert tickets for his birthday and he bought me an art work I mentioned I loved when I moved to a new appartment as a house warming gift for me.

Anyways 5 months later.... first thing that disappeared was his morning at work with coffee selfies.. I immediately noticed and asked about it and he said something like he has been busy in the morning. So I didnt wanna be overbrarinf and kinda backed down and didnt ask again but it just completely stopped.

And later came the shorter replies like ""looks good"" ""sounds cool"" ""enjoy!"" ""Okay"" He stopped building up on our conversations and just started reacting to things I say. 
Soon enough I started to feel like I was talking to myself, and I asked about this to him and he said ""Oh I am so sorry, I wasnt aware I was doing that. I am just trying to respond fast"" but nothing changed.

And then he stopped texting first. He stopped asking about my day. He stopped flirting or iniating sexting. This time I just straight up asked him ""are you drifting away? Is this thing between us coming to an end?"" and he said ""awww sweetie ❤️ ofcourse not!"" but... you guessed it.. nothing changed.

It has been 5 weeks of this now and I dont know what to do. WHAT DO I DO?
Just stop texting him? Delete whatsapp? (btw I can see he is online even when he is not texting me but I dont who he is online for because he told me downloaded whatapp just for me since it is not common over there)

It would be easy if he just told me he got bored or long distance is hard and he found someone close by.. I would be OK.

 Well not OK, but I would move on. But now I am in a limbo.. cause he STILL replies to me almost within minutes of me texting him but the version of him that responds is like a faded version of the person I know and makes no effort to build conversation.

Like I send him a photo from my trip to Paris and all his reactions was ""beautiful"" ""awesome"" ""looks fun!"" Whereas the person I knew before would ask questions and just.. interact with me.

What is he doing? Why is he doing that? Why do men do that? Is he keeping me around ""just in case""?

More importantly, what is the best way to deal with this?

1olz67l,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1olz67l/aitah_for_leaving_a_project_with_friends_over/,AITAH For Leaving a project with friends over mental health and LGBTQ issues?,"TW: Eating disorders, SH, 

I (18MtF) was in a band for 2 years with 2 other people, a trans guy who we'll call O, and a cis guy who we'll call S. We formed the band when we were 12-14 and all home-schooled (we met at workshop days in the first place), and were a bit all over the place, we had several more members in the first few months, but within 6 months they'd all left for various reasons (Exams coming up, too many other responsibilities, etc.), but the 3 of us were left, we didn't get much original stuff done while we were together for the first 2 years, we released one original song, and a few covers.

Around a year into the band me and O began dating, and it was a dream relationship for a few months, until we began talking about mental health, I told him that I was recently recovering from an eating disorder, and he took that as me saying I was currently Disordered, and started talking about these ""cool diets we can do together"" and encouraging me to make an EDTWT account. This eventually caused me to relapse into my ED, as well as other addictions worse than I was before, and began the relationship turning toxic.

But then as well, a year and a half into the band, I began questioning my gender identity and asked O about it and he seemed incredibly defensive about it, it felt to me like almost gatekeeping being transgender when I was in my baby trans era.

This was weird but not that big of a problem, until S began making increasingly direct anti trans comments towards me (I would turn up in a feminine outfit and he would make comments about me being a \*word that rhymes with maggot\*, laugh, deadname, etc) and O would never say anything. Eventually we had an argument about this in private, as it felt horrible having another trans person in the room, just sitting by watching this happen.

I felt certain I was in the right at the time, but after that things began crumbling more and more, we ended up breaking up (for unrelated reasons), and he would start joining in with S, making similar comments.

A while later I began trying to overcome my mental health issues again, and expected support from the people around me, but O began sending me 1500+ word messages about how I ""Clearly dont actually get it"" and I'm ""Not actually dedicated to this lifestyle"", on a daily basis.

After a few months of this, and in the run up to my exams, he began making even more hostile comments if I would mention meeting another friend (""You care more about some new friend than our band oh ok i get it"", to me meeting a friend for coffee) and considering me taking time off to revise for GCSES a ""Waste of time if were gonna get big (We had not even put music on spotify at this point, let alone played a gig""). I finally decided enough is enough in Jan 2024, and left the band.

I felt so free compared to before, without the judgement for being trans, as well as for everything else, from music taste, hobbies, friends anything. Eventually leading to me forming a new band with people I actually enjoy being surrounded by, and the band has been miles more successful already.

However even to this day, O still frequently uses burner accounts and comments on my social media accounts, making comments on my appearance, musical skill, and more. even CONTACTED MY OTHER FRIENDS telling them to do certain things, stalked my college's social media as well as mine, even turned up in nearby towns trying to ""see me"", and complains about me online on a daily basis. Just last week an old friend who was still in contact with him contacted me with screenshots of his social media, and he's been talking about how ""I don't deserve to have got better"" and how he's gonna ""make me pay"".

I'm now in a semi successful band, with a healthy circle of supportive friends, and on a college course I enjoy, and over a year clean from my Eating issues. But would I be the a hole for somehow complaining about him? And if I wouldn't, who would be the right person to discuss it with?

The recent comments, and almost growing obsession over it almost 2 years later is making me feel genuinely unsafe. It feels like petty teenage angst that he has simply not dropped as we've grown older.",0,1762031479.0,AITAH,1,0.5,False

I sit here among goddesses, even if I am not one. A mortal echo in a room of eternal chords. A nobody with great expectations — threadbare, frayed, never quite woven into the tapestry.



But I know my place. This elusive pantheon of noble souls does not mistake me for kin. And yet, they let me stay. Perhaps out of pity. Perhaps out of curiosity. Or perhaps because even gods need witnesses.



The coffee is good. Dark as Nyx’s eyes, sweet as Freya’s laugh, bitter as Hel’s silence.



\[Chorus\]

Here at the Endless Café, time folds like napkins, and eternity is served in porcelain.



The Endless Café is all I thought it would be — a place where time forgets to tick, where the sugar never dissolves, and the music plays a song you almost remember.



I stare Death in her crooked face. She smiles like she knows the punchline to a joke I haven’t lived yet. I sip. She waits.



A faux smile on her lips as she sips her coffee. I am all ears to hear her silently rejoice. I feel that being here is not merely a choice — a time well spent, and a way to keep me free.



I am not one of them. But I am not unwelcome. I am not lost, I think — I am just lingering.



\[Chorus 2\]

Here at the Endless Café, gods pour silence into cups, and mortals sip forgotten dreams.



The company, divine: Nyx and her constellations of foam in the dark coffee; Morphea drifts past, trailing dreams like perfume. Hel polishes obsidian tumblers with quiet finality, her gaze colder than the ice she serves. Ratri brews silence and starlight, steeping serenity into every porcelain cup. Ereshkigal pours shadowed spirits from clay decanters, her eyes weighing the soul of each patron. Freya shakes golden elixirs with a wink, garnishing them with rose petals and reckless longing.



What am I doing here? Death lingers her hands on mine. Her red eyes are much more palatable with a nice scotch on the rocks. She stares, I smile. She speaks profundities, I mumble. Conscience faintly sleeps its way into a whirlpool of sensations I cannot describe...



\[Chorus 3\]

Here at the Endless Café, even Death lingers for conversation, stirred gently with scotch and memory.



Here at the Endless Café, I slip into a place beyond time and space. My face dissolves in masks I never knew I had worn, until all that is left is my one unborn face — the face I wore when I was inside my mother's womb...



Lay with me, stay with me, sit by my side as I chat her up as if she doesn't know me from inside out and from outside in. She plays along and says I amuse her. Silly me. I wish I could stay forever but, she thinks not. What I am suposed to do? Con her to make me stay?

-It was a Red vs Blue FPS game like Team Fortress 2, though I don’t remember it being very cartoonish

-Like in TF2, the teams spawn in protected spawn rooms with team-colored barriers

-There were 3 types of drivable vehicles: a dune buggy (fastest, 1-player only), a military jeep (medium speed, 4-players), and a military truck (slowest, 6-8?)

-I remember maps taking place in a mill, a ship, an airport, a dam, a desert, a tundra, and (I think) a water park

We had technology, but it did not take over our lives. The internet was around, but mostly we used it for learning. Most of the time we turned to books to find answers and explore new ideas. It felt good to flip through pages and find things at our own pace.

Do you remember those old phones with the button keypads? They were so much fun. Everyone loved playing **Snake**. Trying to beat your high score was the biggest challenge. And if you were lucky, your phone had games like **Diamond Rush** or **Bounce too**. They were simple, pixel games that made us laugh and kept us busy for hours.

Listening to music was not instant like it is today. We waited for our favorite songs to play on TV or listened to CDs. When your song finally started, it was pure joy. Nothing felt more special than the first beat or the melody you loved.

Sometimes I wish I could go back to those days. Life felt slower, quieter, and more real. Now screens are everywhere—on phones, tablets, laptops, and TVs—and it often feels like we cannot get through a day without them.

If this made you smile and brought back your own memories, I would love to hear your story.

1olywzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1olywzd/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

I had my chart open, and they must’ve noticed because a few minutes later, I heard them talking about their crypto investments. Then they started talking about $SLOTH.

  
They saw a small 3% dip and started panicking, almost arguing about whether to sell or hold. I just looked at them and smiled, didn’t say a word because the conversation wasn’t mine. But in my mind, I was like they don’t even realize this could be a clean entry. The chart looks like it’s just building a better position for whoever’s patient enough.

  
Later, one of them asked what I thought. I told them I’m actually adding more to my bag because from what I’ve seen, the community behind $SLOTH is solid and it feels like something that could grow stronger over time. I still told them straight that it’s not financial advice, just how I see it.

I’ve always been that person who records voice notes and never listens to them again. A mix of chaos, ideas, and half-thoughts buried somewhere in my phone.

Four months ago, I decided to fix that. I started building **Noteflw** \- an app that **turns your voice into clean, categorized, and summarized notes using AI**.

Whether you’re brainstorming, journaling, or just thinking out loud, Noteflw helps you:  
• Record your thoughts instantly with one tap  
• Get an AI summary in seconds  
• Automatically organize your notes by topic

I had no background in speech-to-text or note AI systems when I started. I broke a lot of stuff. Apple rejected my first build three times. There were nights where I almost gave up.

But after endless debugging and way too many coffees… it’s finally live.

I’m not expecting it to go viral - but I’m proud it exists. If it helps even one person turn their messy ideas into something usable, that’s worth it to me.

📱 **Try it here:** [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/noteflw/id6754044947](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/noteflw/id6754044947)  
I’d love to hear your thoughts - what would make this kind of tool genuinely useful to you?

If you’ve ever built something after months of uncertainty, you probably know that quiet, surreal feeling when it *finally* goes live. That’s where I’m at right now.

I’m a fourth-year electrical engineering student, and 

I’ve been working remotely for a while now, and honestly - I love the flexibility, but focus is becoming a real challenge.



Working from home sounds great in theory, but in practice… there’s always something. Kids running around, parents asking for help, siblings popping in with “just one quick question” - and suddenly an hour’s gone. Even with noise-canceling headphones, it’s hard to stay in the zone.



I started wondering - where do you go when you really need quiet, uninterrupted work time?

Coffee shops are noisy, coworking spaces are expensive and far away, and home just isn’t cutting it anymore.



Are there any calm, affordable spots near home - like small private rooms - where you can actually get things done without distractions?



Do anyone else have the same issue?",1,1762030542.0,EngineeringStudents,0,1.0,False

**SILKEN TENT (Candied angelica, chrysanthemums, white flowering Nardo, clove flowers, jasmine-scented rice pudding, blonde caramel, infused with golden amber.)** In the vial: really faint sweetness, I guess this one blooms in the skin. On the skin: wow ok, still a very soft fragrance. That’s sweet and caramel-like but not overly sugared, a bit like crystallized caramel. There is a light, airy, \*fresh\* (non-indolic) white floral on top of that. Definitely more of a “scent bubble” than a heavy hitter. The tuberose isn’t overly bubblegummy here, it’s more of a generic pleasant white floral. The herbal touches are there, slightly, brightening this up so it’s not a thick, heady caramel smell; but I wouldn't choose this one hoping the herbals to be more present. It’s the tiniest bit musky, which helps it melt into the skin. The rice pudding comes across as more powdery than overly creamy. Quite pretty (if faint) but I will give it **6/10** because there are others in Alkemia’s catalogs of amber gourmands I enjoy more (Carmilla, The Honored Ghosts, As Dark Things Are Meant To Be Loved...). If you tend to \*dislike\* the type of ambery gourmands I like (thick, heady, cacao-like, sweet and lactonic) but still want something \*similar\* to them without those elements, this is it. It’s very soft, borderline a skin scent on me, and it has just a bit of amber and just a bit of caramel and just a bit of herbal flowers and just a bit of cashmeran. Pleasant and cozy, dries into a powdery lactonic.

**AMBER WITCH (aged dark Arabian amber and honey musk with creamy bourbon caramels and spiced rum.)** In the vial: ahh, that’s more my style. Smells rich and cacao-like, intense and dark, almost like earthy patchouli. On the skin: heavy on the honey and chocolate liquor. The dark amber and musk actually make themselves quite known and prevent this from going pure sticky gourmand: the amber in particular is so earthy it almost has a metallic edge to it. I’m surprised cacao isn’t listed as a note because it seems so present to me! I would compare this to As Dark Things Are Meant To Be Loved, even. It has that richness to it. As it dries, a dry, wooden note comes out to counterbalance the others. Like polished mahogany. The woods and almost cacao-like notes combine into something my brain interprets as hazelnutty, oddly. I don’t think this is as well made nor does it hit the notes for me that ADTAMTBL does. Though in its favor the spices are reallyyy well measured here, nothing pot pourri nor holiday candle about it on me. **7/10** just because it’s right up my alley, but there are other scents that deserve a 8-10 more - it just sort of dries into a more generic (but still nice) amber.

**VIRTUE OF DESIRE (caramel amber musk, dark patchouli, apricot-rosewater white chocolate truffles, peach brandy, plumeria, coconut sage, Tiare, raspberry cream, and neroli orange flowers.)** In the vial: ahh! Patchouli! The skin softens the patchouli a lot, a somewhat dusty peach (as in peach fuzz) comes out. The tropical notes are not overdone, there is something almost beachy about this but it does NOT smell like sunscreen. The peach brandy note is a bit stronger. This is soft in a sultry way, rather than cozy. There is unfortunately a plasticky base to this that reminds me a bit of… Roll in the Hay? Which I thought was the honey there, but now I'm not sure. Otherwise this is not as bad as Roll in the Hay, but I wouldn't reach for it compared to the others. I dunno, very uninspiring, **5/10**

**COMPLIMENTS OF THE SEASON (jasmine and sensual cashmere courted by warm amber resin, mahogany wood, dried oakmoss, green balsam fir, and a sprig of mistletoe.)** In the vial: not much! A bit like fresh green laundry. On the skin: spicy jasmine and a bit of this laundry-esque cashmere. The fir is very present, but it's not too cleaning product, it's a bit resinous and warm. The mistletoe note is the standout here, it's very present and quite pretty. It's somewhere between the two typical winter candle smells: not as fresh and overpowering as a fir candle, not as gourmand and spicy as a spiced vanilla candle, the warm, resinous amber brings down the fir notes to something in between. The wood is very present, the jasmine calms down immediately after drydown and just gives this a faint touch. Very inoffensive, easy to wear green scent. Good if you’re looking for mistletoe scents. **7/10**

**VENYM (black roses, saffron infused oud, neroli, bergamot, star jasmine, black vanilla, limoo amani, Darjeeling tea, dark aged patchouli, ebony wood, opium, and black amber.)** In the vial: faint black tea and rose. On the skin: opens with more neroli than rose, very balsamic and warm - supported by the bergamot. It and the black tea have a bit of an Earl Grey vibe, though not as present as in Novella, more of a backdrop. I think the dry, spicy mixture of saffron and tea balance the roses well and prevents them from going soaspy, as do the citrus notes. I don’t get much of the rich, heady rich aspects you might expect from the oud + vanilla + patchouli + wood + opium + black amber part - I’d say the base is a pleasant wood, and something almost musky, definitely not rich dark patchouli. It’s fine - I find it more wearable for my own personal tastes than some of the other rose scents I reviewed because it’s better balanced, it’s feminine and elegant and only the slightest bit sensual (if it doesn’t go soapy on you) - but I don’t see me reaching for it much. **7/10**, which is not a bad grade considering how biased I am against soapy-clean florals. 

**INFAMOUS MUSE (Arabian jasmine, ylang ylang, coconut orchid, mignonette, bittersweet cacao, black amber, dark opium, and smouldering labdanum incense.)** In the vial: ohh, this smells like chocolate balls covered in coconut shavings! On the skin: similar, but a bitterly herbal, floral note comes out - I assume the mignonette and labdanum, they counterbalance the vial smell so it’s not a pure gourmand and becomes more of a warming incense. It has a bit of powdery creaminess (opium and ylang ylang?), but to me this and the coconut never quite cross into tropical - but it’s not quite fully gourmand, either. A bit less dark and sweet than you’d expect from the notes. Unfortunately, while I enjoy the opening a LOT, the moment it starts to dry on my skin the bitter herbal aspects take over everything else - I think too much labdanum, with only a touch of cacao and vanillic coconut. **6/10**, inferior version of Caveau des Innocents, ADTAMTL and even Amber Witch to an extent - but if this works on your skin, I think this one is worth trying if you almost enjoyed the ones I listed but they were a bit too rich.

**SHINE BRIGHT MY DESIRE (golden amber, star jasmine, pink lotus, and orchid swathed in patchouli boudoir incense ignited by passionate kisses of pink pepper, Ceylon cinnamon, ginger zest, and bright verbena.)** In the vial: rather bright and citrusy, like ginger and lemon verbena. On the skin: mm- some jasmine comes out, father fresh, like typical jasmine EdTs. Very little of the heaviness of amber or patchouli, this opens almost fizzy, a spicy pink pepper and a fresh, herbal mug of verbena tea. The orchid and inoffensive star jasmine make this a bit of a classic floral, though less sharp than I usually fear from floral perfumes. A veryy gentle incense base, not much of any sort of warm or balsamic amber. The lotus reads borderline soapy but otherwise perfectly wearable but unexciting and all over the place, **5/10**

**AFTERGLOW (golden musk, Madagascar vanilla beans, woodsmoked black amber, chai tea, spiced rumcake, and incense woods.)** In the vial: ohh that's very nice. Less gourmand than the notes night indicate, veryyy woody with pleasant vanilla and spices. On the skin: that's a LOT of chai and rumcake and woods in the opening! The woods read a bit clean, the smoke isn't very strong. I would LOVE to love this as much as I love L’Encens a la Vanille because I adore that one and this is reminiscent - but the incense here feels much, much soapier (almost like nag champa?), and the more it dries, the more this turns into pure white soap. A pure shame, the opening and what remains below this is a very nice, gently smoked woods with spicy vanilla, it could've been almost perfect. **3/10**

**ARCANUM (eastern spices, aged patchouli, and sandalwood. Frankincense, nag champa, and dragons blood deepen the mystery.)** In the vial: yep, nag champa - although I get a lot of spices and a fair bit of balsamic frankincense, so maybe this will work. On the skin: something here is very lemony to me, bizarrely. It's not as immediately soapy, thankfully. I can't really pick the spices apart, just sort of a generic spicy warmth rater than it being cinnamon or clove dominant. As far as headshop-y incenses go, this is one of the most pleasing, easy to wear ones as it doesn't smell too funky or too soapy. Soft and easy to wear, almost citrus and medicinal, a balsamic incense with some lemon rind and some spices. A very no threatening incense smell. As it dries, this citrus calms down and just a faint resinous, headshop scent remains. It's fine, not my thing, **6/10**.

**ARABESQUE (sandalwoods, precious Egyptian kyphi, sweet orris root, benzoin resin, cassia, and blessed spikenard.)** In the vial: doesn't smell like much, mostly some sandalwood. Still fairly soft on the skin: less balsamic and citrusy than Arcanum, more powdery via the orris root, and it has something almost… musky compared to Arcanum. There is something almost vanillic and sweet about the sandalwood. The spices aren't very obvious, and it's not a particularly strong incense smell, rather like unburnt resin. There is a very unique, distinct resin here I am not familiar with - I am going to guess it's the kyphi, it's almost tart. Whatever it is, it's one of my favorite incenses from this house and it melds well with the rich sandalwood and sweet vanillic benzoin. **8/10** I’m not obsessed but as far as incenses go, I would get this one over others.

**GOTHIQUE (Byzantine monastic incense recipe of Somalian frankincense, styrax benzoin, Arabian myrrh, cassia, spikenard, canella, Liquidambar orientalis, labdanum, Atlas cedar, and vetiver.)** In the vial: ACTUAL citrus, as opposed to Arcanum’s “balsamic warm resin that reads citrusy” - still, closer to Arcanum than Arabesque, which has the pretty unique kyphi. On the skin it's a mix of the citrus and myrrh (very similar to Falling Stars on Winter Solstice) and just a bit of smoky frankincense. Definitely the clearest cinnamon so far. The incense here is a bit... less interesting? More synthetic, cheaper, standard? Than Arabesque. The sweet myrrh an cinnamon make this... not quite gourmand or sweet, but definitely not a churchy incense at all. Warm and almost cozy, I guess that’s it. The smoky incense makes is maybe the most interesting part but it’s also a bit my least favorite, I’m perfectly content with myrrh and cinnamon. This is not very complex, I don’t get much of the last 3 notes. A more feminine, sweet, take on incense. Perfectly fine, pretty simple, **6/10** is probably higher than what it deserves but I like myrrh, so… (But honestly Falling Stars is better, the foresty and wet linens aspect make it prettier than this).

**ATTORNEY FOR LOST SOULS (swirls of Vespers mass incense, rich in Zanzibar clove, Sacra frankincense, and Coptic myrrh, gently interlace with the essence of dried citrus peel, neroli petals, and guaiacum.)** In the vial: that’s interesting, oily almost, I think neroli. On the skin: oh, hmm. A lot of frankincense, moreso than myrrh, and a bit of soapy smoky incense. The citrus is measured here but present. The citrus and clove combination makes me think of La Cheminee a bit, but much much less sharp and fizzy, here it smells like… you just cleaned your skin with a lemon-and-clove soap, if that makes sense? The incense smells less like burning incense and more like sniffing an incense stick. But it’s at the base, this is mostly citrus and clove. Pleasant, but I think of this as more of something I’d wear to feel meditative or to do aromatherapy rather than to wear as a perfume. **6/10**

**EVENING SONG (blanket of sensual cashmere, warm cardamom, velvety myrrh, Madagascar vanilla bean, and orris root softly infused with a lingering memory of woodsmoke and melted candlewax.)** In the vial: faint vanilla bean and cardamom, very cozy. On the skin: ohh that’s a lot of cardamom and cashmere, borderline woody and dusty. A very very faint touch of smoke and I definitely get the wax base. Maybe the most cardamom-heavy I’ve smelled from Alkemia so far? But despite the vanilla that goes with it, it’s not gourmand at all - it almost smells like sandalwood, I assume the orris root is helping with some earthiness. The myrrh isn’t as balsamic as Falling Stars and Gothique - but as this dries, it does take on a very incensey quality. This is very pretty, a scent I can imagine I’d like to slather myself to to read a book in bed. It’s really a punch of cashmere though, not in a clean laundry way, just in a full-on dusty woods - I enjoy this, but watch out if you’re already wary of cardamom. Despite the vanilla, which is present and creamy, it doesn’t read sweet whatsoever. Very simple but very nice, for my tastes this seems like an easy reach for any occasion. **9/10** for me, but the bitterness of the myrrh does come out after it dries and it ends up as a very bitter, strongly woody scent  (cedar?), not “traditionally” cozy, but I enjoy it a lot.

**MEMOIRS OF A WOMAN OF PLEASURE (cashmere sensuously perfumed with rare Japanese boudoir incenses, luxurious caramel pralines, vanilla orchids, bergamot, orris root, candied lemon peel, and a splash of champagne.)** In the vial: also very faint, but definitely some booze and praline. On the skin: this one opens shockingly faint. I even re-tested it the next day on its own to make sure Evening Song didn’t make me go nose blind - but no, it’s really soft. It’s a faint gourmand floral - booze, a bit of vanillic white amber, sugared orchid. There is only the faintest touch of incense, but the very soft woody incense that I think Alkemia tends to call “Japanese boudoir incenses”, rather than anything headier or smokier. It reminds me a bit of some of Alkemia’s sweet, cotton candy/fair scents - like Calliope or Love Flight of a Candy Heart. I enjoy the latter more than this one. The cashmere and very soft incense make this a bit more grounded than those, I guess, but not by much. I get only a bit of oily citrus rind, but nothing fizzy like I’d expect from that + the champagne. It's ok I guess, **5/10**

**THE LIBERTINE (cardamom-infused cashmeran, bergamot, Japanese boudoir incense, ambroxan, botanical pheromones, and black licorice. )** In the vial: yup, anise licorice! On the skin: definitely that and a salty ambroxan, a bit of bergamot oil, and a bit of the same woody dustiness that shows up in Evening Song. I have to say, I wouldn't have thought of mixing these scents together. The licorice is by far the strongest opening note, and it comes across as more boozy and herbal than candy-like. The only other licorice candy fragrance I remember is Trick or Treat and that was mostly cedar and white sugar, THIS is anise liquor. It’s not pure anise but it is the strongest note by far, the dusty gentle woods are only a backdrop and the balmy bergamot brightens this up a bit, and the ambroxan bridges the gap into making it like a “wearable” perfume - but it is licorice, a bit of a sophisticated take on that, and I enjoy it. **8/10** \- if you want the inverse of this, heavy on the dusty woody qualities and light on the licorice, I’d try Trick or Treat. 

**SLICE OF HEAVEN ALCHEMY (NOVEMBER 2024): (freshly baked sweet pumpkin and golden pecan pies, vanilla and velvety tonka, glowing spices, frankincense)** In the vial: perfect timing, this morning I made pumpkin spice + puree pancakes and this smells exactly how eating them tasted omg. On the skin: the spices and light frankincense are a bit amped (but it’s definitely not an incense scent), it smells less of sweet pumpkin than in the vial. Still pretty nice, though. The spices are quite dominant, a bit of cinnamon which reminds me of rice pudding, a fair bit of nutmeg too. This isn’t sugary, gourmand or buttery at all - it’s just the right mount of pumpkin and vanilla. Despite being pretty simple (it’s basically just baking spices, only a touch of vanilla, frankincense and pumpkin, no pie at all) it’s gonna get a **10/10** because I genuinely love smelling like this - I don’t mind it not being gourmand, I have plenty of those. This makes me smell like the spices I put into sweets, I love it.

The number 67 keeps following me. I see it everywhere I look. On clocks, on signs, in the corner of my eye. It’s not just a number anymore. It’s starting to feel like a presence.

It began quietly. The bus I took to work was number 67. My coffee that morning cost $6.70. Then I noticed it on a license plate, on the back of a chair, carved faintly into a desk I swear I’d never seen before. At first, I laughed it off, told myself I was being superstitious. But I can’t laugh now.

I’ve started writing it without realizing it. Just now, my hand moved on its own.

67

There. It happens like that. As if my body knows something my mind refuses to understand.

I know about pattern-seeking behavior. I know about coincidence, probability, apophenia. I tell myself those words like prayers, but they don’t help. It doesn’t feel random. It feels intentional, like the world is sending me a message only I can read.

Today I caught myself staring at a man on the train. He had a small tag on his backpack, printed with the number 67. I kept looking. He turned and met my eyes. I didn’t look away. For a moment I wanted to see if he could feel it too, the weight of the number pressing in. He looked frightened. I wasn’t sure why until I realized I was smiling.

I think the number wants me to notice it. I think it wants me to listen. Sometimes at night I can almost hear it, a low hum behind the silence, like the world is whispering in a language made of numbers.

It’s waiting for something.

The company may not even pay their workers a living wage. The most I ever made at a small coffee shop was $12/hr, and that was in a big city with high COL. The other two were $6.50 and 10$/hr. If you frequent a small business, I urge you to ask the employees how much they make if you feel comfortable doing so.

Employees most likely do not have health insurance or other benefits. They will not have as many protections if something goes wrong, like worker's comp. The owner may be a complete asshole- in many cases down here in the South, they may have... let's say, morals that you don't align with. There is more of a hush-hush attitude towards criticizing the owners, since many customers have met the owners once or twice and want to feel buddy-buddy with them. You don't want to say less-than-appealing things about the owners (or company values, rules, or whatever) and have it come back on you. This is generally not the case at corporations, where employees can critique the company more freely.

It's no secret that business tends to attract selfish and arrogant people (not always the case of course). To grow a business, the easiest and fastest way is to exploit employees. Be very wary of any small business in your area that is opening new locations quickly. Like, 2 shops in under 5 years. And believe former employees when they talk about their experience. Yes, they may be biased, but the truth is often somewhere in the middle. Vet your small business and keep supporting the good ones!",52,1762030458.0,unpopularopinion,45,0.85,False

If something gives my sister an eating disorder or a similar mental illness, it's going to be our genetics or the way our parents raised us. Not me, I won't do that to her. 

Which means eating as normally as I can when I'm around her and that fucking kills me. I've been ""babysitting"" her for the past few days while our parents are out of town/the country. It's not really babysitting since she's seventeen now but if she's going to be alone for upwards of four days, she needs an adult around. Mostly just to make sure she goes to school, doesn't play video games upwards of 12 hours a day and reminds her to eat something healthy. Which I'm good at but for some bizarre reason, my sister loves me and wants me around and that includes at meal times. Which means I have to eat a normal amount of food for a healthy and stable adult man of my height. 

Since she's still in school, I can get away with not eating lunch and having black coffee or similar for breakfast. But dinner is inescapable and it's fucking wearing on me. I hate how much I've been eating these past few days and I hate how much it's affected me. And I can't even have a little freak-out and cry about the calories in pierogies because normal healthy adult men don't do that",1,1762030351.0,EDAnonymous,0,1.0,False

1olyov4,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1olyov4/clenching_my_teeth_wakes_me_up_at_night/,Clenching my teeth wakes me up at night,"Hey everyone,
I hope my experience helps many of you who suffer from teeth cleaning like me. 
I’ve been waking up in the middle of the night because I clench my teeth so hard , sometimes it’s the tension itself that wakes me. It took me a while to even realize it was happening. I’d wake up with a sore jaw and stiff neck and wonder why I felt exhausted even after a full night in bed.

A few things that have helped me so far:
	•	Custom night guard: Getting one that actually fits well made a huge difference. My first one from the dentist was too tight, but I later ordered one directly from a dental lab and it’s much more comfortable.
	•	Stress management: I started doing breathing exercises before bed — 5 to 10 minutes of slow deep breathing helps a lot more than I expected.
	•	No caffeine after 2 p.m.: Cutting back on coffee later in the day noticeably reduced how tense my jaw felt at night.
	•	Warm compress: Applying a warm towel to my jaw before bed relaxes the muscles and makes it easier to fall asleep.

It’s not perfect yet, but I’ve been sleeping better and waking up less often. It’s crazy how much jaw tension can mess with your sleep quality. If anyone else deals with this, I’d love to hear what helped you too. ",1,1762030274.0,sleep,1,1.0,False

1olylf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/1olylf5/just_finally_learnt_why_i_had_trouble_with/,Just finally learnt why I had trouble with advance English/math classes.,"I don't know why it took me so long, almost fifteen years, to realise that I always had trouble understand fluid reasoning/abstract thinking, and that I always preferred looking at the minute details first to try to build the big picture. Ilearnt that bottom-up thinking was very common among our community than top-down thinking.

I always had trouble reading in between the lines, but I must have masked it pretty well enough to have it go unnoticed in school. I was put back three grades in math when I got to middle school, but I supposedly excelled in English until I could not understand any of the literary classics we had to read, like Of Mice and Men or One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest. Somehow I always found myself focusing on the scenes of where they were or what they were doing, but I couldn't always figure out why or how.

Going to Algebra II was like a real nightmare when I got to radicals, logarithms, and rational equations to a point where I even got a zero, but surprisingly, when we got to sequences and series, it felt like an amazing reprieve because I got to work with patterns again.

So in spite of this academic camouflage, why did it go unnoticed? People said that while I did struggle with socialisation, I always socialised with folks who had hyperfocus/special interest and who were good conversation leaders, like those with diagnosed ADHD. So, if my special interest was pipe organs, I could go into a lot of detail about them with someone who also liked pipe organs, and it would look like I was socially engaged.

Why did nobody notice my tendencies to elope whenever I was at church when I was just a tyke? I'd always strategically sneak away to look for my favourite instruments, like the pipe organ in the balcony or band/orchestra instruments. Whenever I went to the bank, I always went in search for the pneumatic tube system because I loved how the tube went underground/above ground and was sucked inside. I always imagined myself being transported that way.
Or, whenever I went to my mum's friends' homes, I'd always look in their kitchen to see if they had any interesting appliances because I was fascinated by ice cream machines and still am to this day. Basically, the larger or more intricate the appliance was, the more exciting it was to engage with. In fact, I used to take things apart to see what was inside of them.

When I finally graduated out of high school, I had this naive goal of wanting to go into neuroscience to better understand colour-sound synaesthesia, but I ended dropping out of college when the classes became too difficult and the need to think and plan ahead became too much for me to bear. Then years went by with me trying to look for a way that I could volunteer/work, until I realised that I was LGBTQIA+, so I joined communities to better get myself involved. I tried going back to school but found that I had to retake the same math classes yet again, so I think I gave up on that.

I have not been to school ever since and had to get on Disability--luckily I qualify based on another disability, but my experience has always been that because of said disability, it was likely that there was some diagnostic overshadowing or unconscious masking going on.

I would absolutely love to go back to work, and people had told me that I am a very capable person, but I do need supports to make that happen. I would ideally love to work in a place where I could get extensive job carving and engage with my special interest and get sensory satisfaction of how different machines sound and things like that. For instance, working in a concession stand would allow me to constantly work hands-on with popcorn machines and things like that, or learn how to manage a coffee cart.

Have y'all had similar experiences and were able to somehow break this vicious cycle of sitting at home and doing nothing to finally getting life-long support? The problem with getting on any I/DD waiver is that when you do *not* have an intellectual disability, you have to prove that your adaptive behaviour is equal to someone who has an intellectual disability. And, that kind of information would have to come from a collateral source, like someone who has known you for a long time, such as a parent or sibling.
There would have been a diagnosis of a mental or physical condition, or a combination of both, that must have originated and directly affected the brain, and continued and expected to continue, indefinitely, before the age of twenty-two for a developmental disability.",1,1762030038.0,aspergers,0,1.0,False

However I grew up in a red state and many of my family and friends are conservatives. 

I am a federal employee and to see family friends of mine cheering on Facebook for people like me to lose my job has been extremely hard to take. To see my closest friends and family defending the administration so much that they more or less would take a bullet for him is astonishing. It really makes me question their morals. 

I recently told a friend of mine that was trying to turn me MAGA that if he was okay with the bullying, mocking, and abuse of federal employees to please not consider me a friend anymore. To me that’s not a R vs D issue, it’s human decency and showing little empathy. 

My conservative friends have not once reached out to me during all of this to just ask how I’m doing. They all know how much I am suffering during the shutdown and my birthday is coming up and not even a “hey let’s get coffee.” It’s extremely sad and depressing. If things were flipped I would be doing that to people I care about. My best friend even told me I should have expected this because government work is never guaranteed. None of this that’s been happening to us is normal. And it’s made me question my life and friendships.

1olyi4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomadlife/comments/1olyi4n/how_to_apply_for_a_digital_nomadfriendly_visa_in/,How to Apply for a Digital Nomad-Friendly Visa in Vietnam (2025 Edition) 🇻🇳,"If you’re a remote worker looking for a vibrant, affordable base in Southeast Asia, Vietnam should be high on your list. With fast Wi-Fi, rich culture, low cost of living, and growing nomad communities in cities such as Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi and Da Nang, it offers a compelling lifestyle for digital nomads.  
The twist: Vietnam **does not yet have** a formal “Digital Nomad Visa.” Instead, remote workers use existing visa categories and stay informed as changes approach.   
Here’s how you can prepare and apply.

# 1. Understand the Visa Context

* There is currently no official “digital nomad visa” for Vietnam. 
* What nomads commonly use:
   * Tourist visas / e-Visas (typically short-stay). 
   * Business visas or investor visas (for longer stays, local sponsorship needed). 
* A dedicated program may be launched in the future — keep an eye on immigration updates.



# 2. Choose the Right Visa Type

Here are your main options:

* Tourist / e-Visa — Fastest, easiest option. Some nationalities eligible. Valid up to 30 or 90 days. 
* Business Visa — For those collaborating with local entities; requires a sponsor.
* Investor / Long-Term Visa — For remote workers willing to establish a business or meet investment criteria. Your choice depends on how long you want to stay, your income source, and whether you’ll engage locally.



# 3. Basic Requirements & Documents

Regardless of which visa you apply for, you’ll typically need:

* Valid passport (usually with at least 6 months validity).
* Recent passport-style photo.
* Completed visa application form (online or at embassy/consulate).
* Proof of onward travel or the intention to depart after your stay.
* Payment of visa fee.
* For business/investor visas: local sponsor letter, proof of business or investment. Sources report these details for remote-worker-friendly stays. 



# 4. Step-by-Step Process for a Tourist e-Visa (Quickest Route)

1. Confirm whether your nationality is eligible for Vietnam’s e-Visa program (check official immigration list). 
2. Go to the official Vietnamese immigration e-visa portal.
3. Upload required documents (passport scan, photo).
4. Pay the fee (approx. US $25 for single entry, more for multi-entry). 
5. Wait 2–4 business days for approval.
6. On arrival at one of the approved ports (airports or land border), present your e-Visa, passport, and entry card. 
7. Begin your stay — note: working remotely for foreign employer is generally tolerated, but working for a Vietnamese employer may require separate permit. 



# 5. Staying Longer: Business or Investor Visas

If your plan is to stay longer than a few months:

* Arrange a Vietnamese company or sponsor for a Business Visa — helpful if you’re collaborating locally.
* Consider Investor Visa or Residence Permit if you plan a long-term base (5–10 years) — new “golden visa” frameworks are reportedly under development. 
* Be prepared for extra documentation — business registration, investment proof, local taxes.



# 6. Extensions & Exit Strategy

* Some tourist visas can be extended via local agencies but often require border runs. 
* Make sure your exit plan is clear — remote-working nomads usually own foreign-sourced income so you’re in a grey area legally; staying over 183 days may trigger tax residency. 
* Always keep updated with changes in Vietnamese immigration policy — things evolve quickly.



# 7. Remote-Work Legality & Tax Considerations

* Working remotely for a non-Vietnamese company while on a tourist visa is generally acceptable; working for a Vietnamese employer may not be.
* Tax residence rules: If you stay more than 183 days in a 12-month period, you may become a Vietnamese tax resident (and liable for local tax on worldwide income). 
* Consult a local tax adviser if your income situation is complex.



# 8. Where to Base Yourself

Some of the most popular digital-nomad hubs in Vietnam:

* Ho Chi Minh City — big-city energy, coworking hubs.
* Hanoi — creative, cultural capital.
* Da Nang — beach + modern city.
* Hoi An, Da Lat — more relaxed, nature-oriented options. These cities offer coworking cafés, strong community, high-speed internet, and affordable living.



# 9. Practical Tips Before You Go

* Get travel/health insurance that covers your stay.
* Choose accommodation with reliable internet and power outlets.
* Purchase a local SIM card or e-SIM (4G/5G) for backups.
* Use fintech/mobile-wallet apps (e.g., MoMo, ZaloPay) for ease of daily transactions.
* Respect visa limits and local laws — avoiding overstays or working locally without permit is wise.



# 10. Final Outlook: Why Vietnam Works for Digital Nomads

Vietnam may not yet have a tailored nomad visa, but the visa ecosystem is flexible enough for remote workers with planning. Combined with its low cost of living, strong connectivity, welcoming culture, and diverse destinations — it checks almost all the boxes.  
Stay informed, pick the right visa path, and you’ll be well-placed to enjoy Vietnam as your next remote base.

# 🧭 Step 1. Visit the Official Website

Don Farrell’s power extends to every ministerial office. The PM relies on him factionally and strategically – and will benefit from an ambitious plan to expand the parliament.

By Jason Koutsoukis

Don Farrell isn’t a household name, but he controls Canberra. He’s the factional godfather who helped build the Labor machine that governs the country.

Now deputy leader of the Senate, Farrell’s reach within the Albanese government runs in two directions: outward, as minister for trade and tourism; and inward, to the parliament and the parliamentary Labor Party, as special minister of state.

“Careers in politics end in either tombstones or pedestals,” former Labor adviser Lidija Ivanovski tells *The Saturday Paper*. “Don decides which one you get.”

As trade minister, Farrell, 71, has managed the delicate diplomacy of rebuilding economic ties with China. At the same time, he has deepened Australia’s trading relationships across the Indo-Pacific, especially with the United States.

As special minister of state, he oversees much of what keeps Australian politics running – from parliamentary staffing and expenses to electoral reform and political finance.

The role gives him influence in every ministerial office, having a final say over senior appointments. It is also allowing him to contemplate electoral reforms that the Coalition fears will cement Labor’s majority by increase the number of metropolitan seats. It would be a coup for a kingmaker who has spent decades shaping the Labor Party.

“I said to someone in Jim Chalmers’ office recently that the three major power centres in the Albanese government are the PMO \[Prime Minister’s Office\], the special minister of state and the Treasury,” one regular visitor to the ministerial wing tells *The Saturday Paper*. “And he said to me, ‘Mate, we’re small fry – it’s the other two where the power really is.’ ”

A devout, socially conservative Catholic and protégé of Joe de Bruyn, long-time leader of Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees’ Association (SDA), Farrell took over as South Australian secretary of the union in 1993, a post he held for 15 years as he became the dominant figure in South Australia’s Labor Right faction.

In an unlikely alliance with the Labor Left, particularly with rising federal stars Mark Butler, Penny Wong and future South Australian premier Jay Weatherill, Farrell helped forge a power-sharing arrangement known as “the Machine”.

Controlling more than 80 per cent of the party’s vote, the two factions divided preselections and key positions between them, absorbing the remnants of the old Centre Left.

What began as a bruising merger became the foundation for two decades of stability and discipline inside South Australian Labor – something of which the party’s Liberal opponents can now only dream.

Farrell is also known for his judgement as a talent spotter, his most celebrated recruit being South Australian Premier Peter Malinauskas. The two formed an early and enduring bond when Malinauskas began working at Woolworths at 15 – first as a trolley boy, then as a checkout operator and night filler.

Farrell quickly recognised his potential, encouraging him into union activism through the SDA and setting him on the path to politics. Today, Malinauskas is seen as one of the most gifted leaders of his generation – a product, in part, of Farrell’s determination to invest in those who will carry Labor’s project forward.

A measure of Farrell’s skill in navigating both the bare-knuckle internal battles of Labor politics and relationships across factional lines came in 2007, when Mark Butler used his first parliamentary speech to acknowledge his rival turned ally.

“I have learnt an enormous amount from Don Farrell, who is soon to join us elsewhere in this building,” Butler said. “His dignified and strategic approach to politics is an asset to our party.”

Farrell was little known outside Labor politics when he entered the Senate in 2008, but he soon turned heads when he emerged, barely two years later, as one of the key organisers behind the move to oust then prime minister Kevin Rudd in favour of Julia Gillard.

The soft-spoken union man from Adelaide, a winemaker whose easy charm masks his ruthlessness, became a symbol of the party’s pragmatism – one of the “faceless men” whose actions cast a pall over the next decade of Labor instability.

For a politician who had built his career avoiding the spotlight, it was a moment of unwanted notoriety. Yet, unlike many who took part in that coup, Farrell endured. He went back to the slow, patient work of rebuilding alliances, and by the time Labor returned to power in 2022, he had become the rarest thing in politics: a survivor trusted by every faction and underestimated by no one.

This week, the past came full circle. On Monday morning, amid the shrill hum of conversation at Aussies Cafe – the favoured haunt of politicians, staffers and lobbyists inside Parliament House – Farrell and Rudd sat together over coffee.

By all accounts, the meeting was warm. As trade minister, Farrell now relies on Rudd, Australia’s ambassador to the US, to help secure the best deal possible in ongoing negotiations with the Trump administration. Rudd, in turn, needs Farrell’s influence in Canberra to keep his Washington mission aligned with the government’s political priorities. It was, in every sense, a mutually convenient reunion.

Farrell is now a part of Anthony Albanese’s senior leadership group, an informal cabinet subcommittee that is focused primarily on tactics and strategy. Farrell’s quiet backing of Albanese is central to the government’s stability – a left-wing leader assured of the Right’s support in keeping Labor anchored to the centre.

When Albanese took over as opposition leader following Labor’s devastating defeat in 2019, he and Farrell were aligned on most major issues. When Albanese’s leadership wavered during the pandemic years, Farrell stood firm, effectively guaranteeing his position.

“One of the things that makes him such a great parliamentarian is that he’s not afraid to sit down and have a meal or a glass of wine, both across the aisle inside the parliament and with people others in the party might go out of their way to avoid,” says Ryan Liddell, a former chief of staff to Labor leader Bill Shorten. “And that has been instrumental.”

Farrell’s record as trade minister is one of consolidation. In less than three years, he has rebuilt relations with China, lifted punitive tariffs on Australian wine and barley, restored access for beef and lobster exporters and steadied a relationship that had been frozen for years. He has concluded a trade agreement with the United Arab Emirates, advanced negotiations with India and kept the long-stalled European Union deal alive despite obstacles that would have defeated less patient operators.

What stands out, according to observers, is not just what Farrell has achieved but how he has done it.

“What I learnt as trade minister is that demeanour really matters. It’s like a diplomatic portfolio,” says Craig Emerson, who held the portfolio under Gillard. “If a trade minister is affable and clear about what they’re trying to achieve, they get a lot of respect … That counts for a lot, because while prime ministers and presidents have the final call, they put a fair bit of faith in a good performing trade minister – because the trade minister’s been through it all, and the leader hasn’t. Don’s earnt that faith.”

Emerson describes Farrell’s style as a mix of “international and domestic diplomacy” that mirrors how he operates inside the Labor Party itself. “That’s just Don’s style,” he says. “And it’s bound to reap bigger rewards than the aggressive or self-loving style you sometimes see on the international stage.”

Although Farrell is not as prominent as other ministers, Kos Samaras, a former Labor strategist and now a director at RedBridge Group, says he has a surprising level of cut through with some voters. “Anywhere there’s mining, or where trade is woven into the local economy, people are acutely aware of his presence – and in a positive way,” Samaras tells *The Saturday Paper*.

[](https://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/comment/topic/2025/06/07/how-labor-factions-actually-work)

“If you’re in a farming community, you know who the trade minister is. If you work in logistics, warehousing, importing, exporting – any of those spaces – you pay attention every time there’s tension with China. People get nervous because their livelihoods depend on it. We hear it constantly in focus groups.”

Western Australia, Samaras adds, is where that sensitivity is most pronounced. “The entire economy there relies on trade. And Western Australians – right down the line – get really angry when governments start having fistfights with China.”

Samaras says Farrell’s ability to calm those tensions was part of a larger story about Labor’s first term. “Success in areas like trade helps reinforce the overall message that the adults are running the show,” he says. “That’s the key. When people vote, they’re choosing between your mob and the other mob. They might have issues with your mob – but they stuck with Labor, in part because of successes like Don’s.”

Still, for all the influence that comes with trade, Farrell’s real power lies closer to home. As special minister of state, he controls the hidden machinery that turns an election victory into a functioning government.

After this year’s May 3 election, it was Farrell who oversaw the delicate process of staffing the new ministry – a quiet exercise in control that touched more than 450 political appointments across the ministerial wing.

Each post carries its own calculation of loyalty and reward, and Farrell, ever the organiser, knows exactly how to bank the goodwill that flows from them. Within the government, it’s said that no minister’s office was filled without his counsel and no senior adviser hired without his nod.

“It would be an exaggeration to say that Don has a spy in every office – but it’s not that far off, because we all know that ultimately we owe him our jobs,” one current Labor staffer says.

Farrell’s influence extends beyond personnel. In the first term, he masterminded the Albanese government’s overhaul of Australia’s electoral funding laws.

The reforms lowered the disclosure threshold for political donations, introduced real-time reporting of gifts above it and imposed tighter caps on campaign spending. They also expanded transparency obligations for lobbyists and third-party campaigners, marking a shift towards a better regulated system of political finance.

It is legislation that will long outlast this parliament and stands as Farrell’s most enduring institutional legacy: the rules of the game, rewritten by the man who knows them best.

With the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters inquiry into the conduct of the 2025 election, Farrell has an even bigger reform in his sights: expanding the size of the parliament itself.

The case for expansion is hard to ignore. In the 40 years since the last increase, Australia’s population has grown by more than 11 million – from less than 16 million to more than 27 million – without a single additional seat in either chamber.

Each of the 150 members of the House of Representatives now serves an average of 120,000 constituents, up more than 6000 since 2022. By comparison, at the time of Federation, each MP represented about 25,000 voters. The parliament has expanded only twice in 122 years – in 1949 and 1984 – both moments when the ratio of voters to MPs had reached record highs.

The pressure has again reached that point, with think tanks including The Australia Institute and the Grattan Institute supporting calls for a 50 per cent increase in Lower House seats to bring Australia’s representation in line with other democracies. Farrell’s inquiry may be the moment when that long-delayed correction finally comes into view.

To succeed, Farrell will need every ounce of charm he possesses. It would be a major reform and a likely win for the party he loves. Already, there is concern from the Coalition that the new seats would necessarily fall in metropolitan areas where people are no longer voting conservative. Labor’s huge majority would only be further entrenched.

In a city ruled by noise and ambition, Farrell’s power endures for the same reason it always has: patience, method and the calm certainty that real influence rarely announces itself.

“Underestimated by people who don’t know him, never doubted by people who do,” says Ryan Liddell. “His conservative nature and advice have been a driving force in consolidating Labor in government.”

I am a male (35) who has been married to my wife for 5 years in 2020 and I had met her in 2017.  I have been thinking about divorce for a little while now for several reasons and for several reasons feel like I cannot go through with it.

  
For the reasons for getting a divorce is that it just feels that this marriage in not equitable.  I do make good money, much more than my wife with a magnitude of about 5 times more.  I understand that I should be the majority payer of things, which I have no problem with, but at this point, it just feels like she is not appreciative and takes things for granted.  She makes some money, but she doesn't pay for anything.  I pay our rent, our monthly bills of utilities, insurance, and groceries.  I pay every single time we go out to eat anywhere.  I can afford to do all this, but we are also hoping to save money for a house.  Therefore, I have been trying to be frugal since we live in a very high cost of living state and area.  So when we go out to eat, I try to order at least as possible or a high calorie to price ratio dish, but it just seems that she orders what she wants even if it's a signature expensive dish.  I have told her about this, but she continues to do this.  We also recently this past year had a second marriage reception since her family could not go to the original one since our families live on separate coasts.  She not only stuck me with 90% of the cost, but tried to add a ride rental (at Disney) that would have cost 12k more.  I said no, but she kept insisting.  Then when we got her a new car, she insisted that it only be registered in her name, yet I am the one paying all of her car payments.  When we had our wedding savings account in a high yield savings account, she refused to add me to it and make it a joint account.  So, instead, I made my own account to save up for it.  Even when she is not paying for anything, she asks me for money to help her pay her credit cards, which are times thousands of dollars.  Yet, she has money to go out with her friends.  In fact, right now she is in Texas with her friends and did not want me to come spending money with her friends.

Another reason is the share of housework or chores.  She doesn't do anything.  I take out the trash, wash the dishes, and vacuum and clean the floors. We have 2 pets, a dog and a cat.  I take the pets to the vet, buy them food and litter, take the dog on walks, and scoop the cat's litter.  She will say that she cooks me food, but that is maybe once a week at most.  I usually cook my own food and she doesn't like my cooking, so I just cook for myself.  I work 12 hour days 3-4 times a week and I actually took a 2nd part time job to make more money, so that is sometimes 4-5 times a week for 12 hours.  I still do all the chores.

As far as intimacy goes, I feel like we barely have sex.  On multiple occasions, I have asked and she always seems to have an excuse, whether that is she is cramping (not period related), on her period, too busy with work stuff even though she is online talking to her friends, or we just went out to eat on ""date night"" and she is too full.  Before I confronted her, we had sex maybe once every 4 months.  Afterwards, it is maybe 1-2x a month.

These are the main reasons, but some other things include she will defend her friends than to take my side.  For example, one of her friends sometimes comes over to sleep at our house.  He has twice now used my shaving razer without asking me and has said nothing to me about it.  Just used it and left it wherever he wanted.  I have now wasted 2 razer heads throwing them out after and everyone knows how expensive they are.  When I told my wife this, instead of taking my side saying that is gross and inappropriate, she said well he paid for our coffee when we went out.  Another thing is that I ask to hang out by playing games with her, watch an episode of something with her, but she says that she is always busy, but then will be online talking to her friends (both guys and girls).  Recently, she went to Texas to hang out with her friends, but didn't want me to come since she said they think I'm grumpy since I have a ""resting bitch face"".  Another thing is she originally wouldn't wear her engagement ring since it was expensive designer ring that did take up some space on her finger, so I understood.  Then when we got wedding bands that were smaller, she still won't wear it saying that when she wears medical gloves and takes them off, it would sometimes catch and pull off the ring.  However, when we go out on ""date night"" or if she's not working, I still don't see her wearing it.  I chalk it up to her possibly being forgetful, but it is starting to annoy me. I have talked to her about it.  Lastly, we have talked about kids, but she seems like she keeps putting them off to the point that I feel like she doesn't actually want them, but just says yes later to keep me around.

  
Reasons against me getting a divorce are I guess that I am afraid of the unknown.  I am 35 years old.  What are the chances that I will find a woman to start a life with by dating, getting married, and having kids without me becoming ridiculously old or her approaching 35 years old (the advanced maternal age).  Sure, I could date younger, but do women even want a guy at my age?  I am also afraid of finding a woman who ulterior motive only wants me for the money.  Next, I am an Asian guy who grew up in a majority white area all his life.  My wife is also Asian, but she is the first Asian woman I ever dated.  I have found white women as the most attractive to me all my life and still think about that, but I am afraid that statement is clouding my judgement.  I don't want to divorce my wife because deep down I want to be with a white woman and that is clouding my judgement.

  
I have a best friend (male) who I have talked about this stuff to and he says that over the months that I've been talking about this, my wife is abusing me.  That if I'm not happy, then it is better to find a new life in the unknown than to live the rest of my life unhappy.  His mom is a divorce lawyer and her statement of if I could see myself with kids with her and being happy the rest of my life and my answer wasn't exactly no, but I feel like my wife wouldn't be a very good mother.  In addition, my own mother never liked her to begin with, but I always brushed it aside.  Now, I'm starting to feel like she's right.

  
My personality type is one of perseverance.  I grew up saying I would not become one of the statistic of a divorcee.  I wanted to make this work.  I wanted to overlook some stuff to make it work.  However, I feel like I'm at a point where I'm just not happy anymore.  We have tried couple's therapy/counseling, but we stopped going because my wife said that the counselor that SHE PICKED took my side, which I still think she was trying to be neutral.

  
If you made it this far, thank you so much for reading and I hope to get some advice.  Maybe even a personal experience and how either staying in the marriage or going through with the divorce and how your life ended up.

  
TLDR: There are a few reasons that I dislike my marriage (financial, chores/housework equity, sex, I don't feel like I am above her friends).  The reasons I am afraid to leave/divorce (my age).  Best friend and his divorce mother say that she is entitled and abusive to me and my mother never liked her.",2,1762029458.0,Marriage,10,0.67,False

I was the president of a club at my university, and he was the president of the same club at my close friends’ university. We were introduced at a New Year’s party organized for all the clubs in the city. Before that, my friends from his university kept telling me I’d totally like him and honestly, when I saw him, I actually did. But soon after, I started liking someone else and kinda forgot about him.

We had to talk a few times for clubrelated stuff, but that was it.

Then, at the beginning of 2024, my ex boyfriend worked with this guy on a joint project, and I joined one of their meetings. He was super friendly honestly, it felt like he was flirting with me even though I was in a relationship. The next day, he added me on all kinds of social media and texted me again about something we’d already talked about, like he was pretending to forget just to start a convo. I ghosted him though, since I had a boyfriend, and kept things friendly.

Throughout the year, we ran into each other a few times (even with my boyfriend around) and were just… friends, I guess.

Seven months ago, I broke up with my boyfriend. Then last month, one of my girlfriends also broke up with hers, so we decided to have a girls’ night out. The “guy” happens to manage a nightclub, so I suggested we go there. The night was amazing. He treated us so well, literally did everything to make sure we had fun. He’s always been thoughtful, but that night, with my friends hyping me up, I ended up flirting with him a little.

One of the first things he asked was about my ex, and I told him we’d broken up. Later that night, when we were alone for a bit, we kinda… had a little makeout session. I was tipsy and didn’t fully process what happened until the next morning, when I woke up totally confused about how to feel. Our IQOS vapes got mixed up that night too, and the next morning he texted me a super sweet “good morning” message and that’s how the convo started.

I panicked and played it cool, changed the topic to the IQOS, and told him he could come pick his up from where I worked. He came, we chatted briefly, but the vibe was so awkward. We were both tense, and I made some weird jokes that basically ruined the moment.

At first, I felt relieved, thinking “okay, guess that’s over.” But then I got really sad, because honestly, he’s someone I could actually like.

A week later, I happened to be near the area where he works and decided to text him. He replied within 30 seconds but of course, he wasn’t there that day. And then I, being me, made it weird again by saying “you missed your chance 😔,” and yeah… he left me on read.

Still not giving up apparently, a week later (on Sunday) I texted “hey, how’s it going?” but he didn’t reply (probably busy) and my message just got buried. Four days later, he texted back apologizing for missing my messages. I asked him out for coffee, but he said he was out of town helping his family with work and told me we’d talk when he got back.

It’s been three weeks. Still nothing.

Now I just feel like an idiot, like I somehow managed to look socially inept and totally killed any attraction he might’ve had. The worst part? I actually really like him.

What do I even do?? Please help me 😭😭

1oly8bs,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1oly8bs/was_i_really_abused_or_crazy_as_he_said/,Was I really abused or crazy as he said ?,"Hi everyone, I’d really appreciate it if you could take the time to read this. This story has been heavy on me for months. I finally cut off someone who broke me piece by piece, and writing this feels like my last step to let go. I know some of you will say I should’ve left a long time ago, but it’s not that easy when you’re emotionally trapped.

From the start, he said everything I wanted to hear that he loved me, that we’d get married, that I was his only one, his peace, his priority, the one he’d do anything for. He’d call me 50 or 60 times if I didn’t answer, text me nonstop, and say he couldn’t go a day without hearing my voice. Even during important meetings, he’d hide in the bathroom just to FaceTime me for a few minutes that’s how obsessed he was.

But when it came to actually seeing me in real life, he never showed up. Every single date had an excuse: “I’m sick,” “I’m tired,” “something came up.” And then he’d go to dinner or back to work the same night. I’d get dressed, look beautiful, wait for him, and end up crying in bed. When I told him how hurt I was, he’d turn everything around say I was crazy, dramatic, that I didn’t respect myself, that I needed to stop the “drama” and get back with him.

Still, I stayed, because each time he’d come back saying he loved me and would change. And when he wanted to, he could act so loving and gentle.

He’s rich, powerful with drivers and everything. He could’ve come to me anytime but I think he liked seeing me wait. It gave him control. Yet he couldn’t go even one day without talking to me. If I pulled away, he’d spam my phone, insult me, and tell me I was the reason he acted that way and that he would say anything to piss me off because I treat him as a dog

Today was the day I finally woke up. We had planned a date after he convinced me for 3 days He promised he’d call his driver to come pick me up. I trusted him again. I got ready  wore a dress and heels, looked stunning. And it’s not me saying it everyone who sees me says I’m beautiful, even strangers. Even him even when he was angry, he’d still say I was “extremely beautiful.”

When he didn’t call, I decided to drive myself to his house because I wanted to see what excuse he’d come up with this time.

He came downstairs looking miserable dirty t-shirt with holes, coffee stains all over, flip-flops, smelling like coffee and sweat. And the first thing he said to me, while looking me up and down, was:

“What’s this dress and heels? Are you going into a ball?”

For the first time, I didn’t even feel angry. I just saw how pathetic he looked next to me. I take care of myself that day I looked radiant. He’s short, overweight, unkempt and I never judged him for his looks. I chose him because I thought he had a good heart.

Then he said, “You’re nothing.”you’re not impressing me Then He tried to sit inside my car and said, “Move your dirty bag and your dirty glasses, I don’t want to touch them,” and kicked them with his leg. It was my car, my own car and he acted like he owned it. Then he said, “These glasses are fake as fuck.” My bag was designer, my glasses were real. He just wanted to humiliate me.

Then he said, “I treat you like my employee,” even though I never asked for or accepted a single penny from him. I’ve always paid for myself. He’s never given me anything, and still treated me like I was beneath him.

In the past, he’s told me to “shut up,” “stop opening your dirty mouth,” and once when I was stressed and got my period twice in one month, he said, “You’ll never have kids.” That’s when I realized he wanted to break me down and make me feel worthless because deep down, he felt that way about himself.

When I told him today, “Let’s just say goodbye, we’re done,” he looked at me and said:

“Okay, I have 2–3 girls waiting. I’m gonna fuck a bit since I didn’t fuck you.”

He said that word for word. I just stared at him. I didn’t even cry this time. He’s always told me he says cruel things just to piss me off, but it only shows who he really is.

I blocked him — but he’s been calling me from unknown numbers. He even said, “God will make you pay for the pain you caused me.” When in reality, I was the one crying every single night for months.

He always told me he couldn’t go a day without talking to me, that he’d go crazy if I disappeared. This time, I know he will but I finally won’t.

I chose him for his heart, not for his money or his looks. And I lost so much of myself trying to heal someone who only wanted power, not love.

And the worst part after hurting me in the worst ways possible and I stay silent I tell him I’m going home he tells me look people are looking at you because you’re crazy you have no shame stop this drama and close your mouth and let’s be actually together and work on it

I just wanted to look back and share some highlights in case it helps others or provides some motivation or ideas for others to try.

The home sleep test result stated I had around 20 AHI. The first few months bounced between 2-4 and I've managed to mostly keep it anywhere from 0.8-2, though more commonly above 1. 

**Out of the box settings:** 4-20 auto. I tried this out for about 2 weeks and felt it was going nowhere. My body might've just been exhausted so much that any small improvements were just not noticeable in such a short amount of time.

**Using Oscar/SD card**: This started around the 2nd week and over time I started to slowly waking up to be exhausted and sleepy to less exhausted and just sleepy. I still have sleepy mornings but I either zap fully awake without coffee a little after breakfast or at least by lunch time. Before using the machine, I would be tired even after arriving home and it was bad enough I couldn't even do something as simple as Netflix.

**1st Saturday waking up normal:** I think this was around the 3rd month for me. I woke up without feeling tired or weird and went out for a full day. I didn't have a moment where I felt like I needed to leave early and take a nap. 

**1st normal vacation without major breaks:** Almost exactly a year before I used the machine, I went somewhere hot not realizing I had apnea. I had the worst time and was mainly stuck in my hotel for most of the trip not understanding why I was so out of it. I figured maybe I'm just too old for the heat.

I went somewhere hot again this year but after about 6 months of CPAP usage and did way better. I would still wake up after about 6 hours and I sometimes had dessert about 2 hours after my bedtime. 

I think I was logging in about 10-20k steps a day. One of those days was at Disney. By the end of the day I was feeling it but it was more from my legs being tired vs feeling completely out of it due to lack of sleep. I didn't even feel sleepy at the end of the day.

I don't even work out as much as I should but I wouldn't have even made the initial flight if I hadn't been using a CPAP. This might be the biggest highlight for me for the 1st year because if I did the same trip with friends, I wouldn't have walked as much or as fast (they are very fast). 

Throughout the year I've been trying different settings, ranges, pressure, humidity etc. 

One thing I don't recommend

* **Don't wash the humidity tank with the dishwasher, use lower temperatures, or don't leave it it in there too long**: I only tried to wash it once, let it fully dry and the same night I tried to use it, my machine was giving off seal errors. I was able to get it to seal by gently pushing the tank into the machine before starting it. Ever since, it's been fine as long as I gently shut the tank but if I apply too much force when closing it, it gives a seal error then I have to open and shut it again and then reinsert it into the machine.

In terms of hygiene and having to resupply...

* **Masks**: I believe I'm on my 3rd or 4th one now. My 2nd mask felt like it hung on about twice as long as my first which was probably about 4-5 months vs 1-3 with the first mask. I think this might've come from actually adding a day soak every Sunday with the 2nd mask on top of daily wipes compared to me just wiping down the first mask daily. Or it could've been from using less intense air settings from spending more time with the machine who knows?



* **Hose:** I'm still on the same hose and I just hang it up to dry every day. When I had humidity above 5, the droplets wouldn't evaporate even by the end of the day but there's no build up anymore after dropping the humidity. I should get another tube just in case but I'm holding out for a better sale. 



* **Headgear/frame?**: I started to deep soak this when I started the 2nd mask. I started noticing some kind of build up inside maybe from the dish soap or something in tap water or both? I'm sure my mask has some build up from soaking but it's easier to wipe off. I thought about buying some kind of cleaner tool but the headgear wasn't that expensive to replace and I bought a few extra too.



* **Straps**: I replaced the first one a little over the 7th or 8th month and they are also not that expensive to replace. I noticed the velcro wouldn't stay on as long as it used to and I didn't think about one of the causes of leaks to come from the strap loosening up the mask seal and figured it was only from the mask wearing down.



* **Elbow connector**: I still have the first one that came with the machine. This one doesn't look as if it gets dirty if at all. I started to soak it once I started the 2nd mask and I will eventually get a replacement but from reading around in this sub, it doesn't seem like people replace it often?



* **Machine filter**: At best, I try to replace this every 2 weeks. It doesn't really look that dirty but if you hold it under light and flick it, you will see a bunch of dust fly off and that helps me to try to stay on track to replace it.

What I'm still working on or what I've stopped using

* **Humidity level above 5**: I've been trying to find the ideal temp and humidity level so I don't wake up congested. Humidity above 5 might work for others but when I tried going to 5 or higher, my tube and or mask always ended up with too much condensation. It felt comfortable but I'd wake up in the middle of the night with gurgling sound coming from water build up in the tube and the air sloshing it around or noise from the mask from the water build up affecting the mask seal.



* **Autoset for her**: I wanted to look at all options and figured I'd give this a try. It seemed to work for a few nights but eventually it would bump the AHI numbers higher than they should be and this is with both EPR on and off. 



* **EPR**: I had what I thought were good nights in the first half of the year. It definitely feels comfortable using EPR and the highest I've used it long term was up to level 2 and maybe a few times at level 3 but I couldn't manage to sleep as long as I did with it off. Most recently I tried EPR 1 and got 6.5 hours of total sleep from it which is definitely way better compared to the very beginning but I also managed to get 7.5 hours without EPR. My settings were also probably more optimized or maybe I managed to not roll over that night but looking at the last 1-2 months of my best nights, they were all with EPR off.

The future and upcoming plans

* **Battery power for long flights**: With the success of my domestic vacation earlier this year I'm planning to bring my machine with me for a long haul flight. After reading about everyone's experiences here, I've procured a battery and just need to buy the power converter thinger. I've also reached out to the airlines where I plan to use my machine to let them know ahead of time the equipment I'm bringing and how I plan to use it since you're not allowed or not supposed to use the outlets on the plane for these machines apparently. I've had good success with contacting the airlines some just took a little more time than others to respond but they are now all aware and have approved the equipment I'm bringing. The common thing all of them asked was the make and model of my CPAP machine and battery and the weight and dimensions of the CPAP machine. 



* **Ideal settings, improving sleep duration, and reducing or eliminating wake ups:** Ideally I'd like to continue reducing my AHI to as low as possible and reduce or eliminate the number of times I wake up in the middle of the night. I'm a light sleeper and actually live not too far from a flight path and freight rail (go figure) and I recall having dreams involving aircraft but I figure that's not a bad thing since I'm at least dreaming about it vs being immediately woken up from the noise which was probably happening to me before. In the past I always thought I was never much of a morning person and I still don't think I'm a morning person but I'm sure my sleep quality was poor back and my body was still able to put up with it without feeling too tired. After using the machine for some time, I'm finding myself able to sleep more than 6 and even up to 7 hours on weeknights which I thought I could never do except on weekends or if I went to bed 2 hours earlier than normal.

1oly4y5,https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/1oly4y5/hope_this_helps_people/,Hope this helps people 🙏,"I’m writing this for anyone—man or woman—who is being gaslit, lied to, and betrayed, but is being made to feel like they are the crazy one. I had to go through this, and while I wasn't completely alone, I was isolated in the one relationship that should have been my safe harbor. My kids knew, and that is a heartbreak I wouldn't wish on anyone.
Everything I'm about to share is 100% how it happened. I want you to see the warning signs, see where I went wrong, and know that you can heal, even if the person who hurt you never tells the truth.
The Beginning and a Key Confession
To understand the end, you have to know the beginning. I was in my first marriage, working for my ex-father-in-law. It was a bad fit. One night, my ex-wife and I were lying in bed, and she quietly asked me, ""If you could marry me again, would you?"" As much as it broke my heart, I couldn't lie. I told her ""no."" It was a devastating thing to say to another human, but I had to tell the truth. We were processing the divorce within a week. The pain and guilt of having hurt her like that, even in telling the truth, stuck with me for years.
When I met my current wife, it was a very different situation. When we were getting to know each other, she told me a story about a time she and her then-boyfriend had picked up another woman at a bar and gone home together, leading to a lesbian encounter for my wife.
Despite this, we fell in love and got married. We had two beautiful children, a son and a daughter. For many years, I fully believed that God had given us the grace to forgive us and that we had a blessed life.
The First Cracks and the Psychological Sword
Then, things began to disintegrate. She suffered a lot of loss—her brother and her brother-in-law both passed away. The home environment became tense. She unilaterally decided to stop homeschooling, a decision we had made together, and then unilaterally decided to go back to work, against our agreement.
The real shift, the one I can only see now as a chilling piece of manipulation, happened one night in our pool. Our babies were young, maybe 4 and 6. It was dark, we were holding each other, a sweet, intimate moment. And she said to me, ""I have to tell you something. I believe that the Lord is showing me that I'm going to be a young widow.""
I trusted her with my life. I would have fallen on any sword for her. In that moment, I essentially gave her the sword, pointed it at my own heart, and let go. That single comment sent me on a 10-year journey of believing that I was going to die young.
The New Job and the Young Man
She took a job at a nonprofit, running fundraising events. This meant big parties, lots of drinking, and a whole new social life. She began going to wine bars with friends, taking lunches, breakfasts, and dinners alone with men.
The warnings started. People would contact me, ""Hey, your wife looks pretty friendly with XYZ gentleman at...""
My own sister called me once. She was at a coffee place and saw a young woman get out of a truck, bouncing and laughing, and then the guy got out. She thought, ""What a cute couple,"" and then she realized the woman was my wife.
The man was 16 years younger than her. He worked at the nonprofit with her. His wife also worked there. His wife's aunt was the president—a powerful, wealthy local woman. It was a twisted web. My wife had befriended this young man's wife and even his mother-in-law.
They had been to our house, swam in our pool. I eventually sat all three of them down—my wife, this man, and his wife—and said, ""It's not a good idea for you two to be driving alone together. It looks bad, and it puts you in a bad position.""
I'll never forget the young man's response. He looked at me and said, ""Well, you just are kind of old school. You don't know how things run these days.""
It was infuriating. And on a petty but honest sidenote: I am tall, dark, and handsome, in excellent condition. This man was medium height, tubby, and ugly. It's a low-value man like that who got her attention.
During this time, my wife began to project. She'd say, ""You know, I think you should have female friends. I wouldn't mind at all if you went to coffee with them alone."" She was pushing me toward the very behavior she was engaging in. I refused. I told her I would never put myself, my wife, or my community in that position.
The Discovery: The App and the Recorder
One weekend, I took the kids out of state to see my dad. My wife refused to go. While we were gone, she had dinner alone with her 70-year-old boss at a hotel restaurant on a Sunday night. Completely inappropriate, even in the best light.
The final straw came after we returned. She had a work event and was supposedly picking up supplies from this young man. She drives a Tesla, and I opened the app. I watched her car pull into a dark, secluded cul-de-sac at night. The car stopped. The passenger door opened, then closed.
I knew exactly who she was meeting. I knew he had just gotten in the car.
I called her immediately. As I was calling, I watched the app. The passenger door opened, then closed. He bailed.
She answered, ""Hi baby!"" as casual as could be. ""What are you doing?"" I asked. ""Oh, just about to pick some stuff up and head to the event.""
My head was spinning. I knew I was being lied to. I did something out of character, a last-ditch effort. The next day, I left a phone in her car, on record.
When I got it back and listened, my world ended.
She called him immediately after leaving the house. ""Did you have sex this weekend?""
He talked about his wife just giving him oral sex.
She said to him, ""You're the first thing I think of when I wake up and the last thing when I go to bed.""
She said, ""I always want to be with you... more than I want to be with [she named my daughter, my son, and me, by name].""
She talked about quitting their jobs and running away, just taking a nap with him. He said, ""Yes, and then I could wake up... you'd wake up with me inside of you.""
She purred and said, ""Yes, I would love that.""
She said, ""I told you if we opened this Pandora's box, I would never be able to get enough."" He replied, ""Yeah, you're such a horny girl.""
She said, ""I really am.""
I also noticed her using new sexual language, words that were absolutely not part of our vernacular. I realized she was learning them from him and bringing them into our bed.
When I confronted her, she gaslit me. ""You're insane. You're crazy."" She had been doing this for a long time, and it had almost worked. But now I had proof.
I contacted him. He lied, too. I told him, ""As a man, you get one chance to tell your wife, because if you don't, I will. I will not let her live in a lie."" He claimed he did, and I followed up with his wife via Instagram DM to make sure. She confirmed it. She was devastated.
The Aftermath and the Frankenstein Marriage
I told my wife, ""You need to leave that job if we are going to make it.""
Her response? ""I'll know it's the right time to leave if God brings me a better job.""
She stayed at that job, working with him, for six more months.
I told her through tears, ""Every time you walk out that door and go to that place, you are stabbing me in the heart.""
During this period, in an argument, she pulled out the ultimate weapon. Knowing the deep, lasting pain I felt for what I said to my first wife, she attacked me with it. I never asked her the question, but she answered it anyway, looking at me and saying, ""If I could go back and marry you again, I wouldn't do it.""
She wasn't just telling me she didn't love me. She was telling me—and our children, by proxy—that her own comfort was more important than their very existence.
It's been three years since the discovery. She eventually left that job (for a new one, not for me). She has never cried about it. She has never confessed the physical affair, despite the audio. Her only explanation is, ""I was in a bad place.""
That's not enough.
It brings a word picture to my mind: It was like watching her walk around our home with a machete, chopping everything precious to pieces. I was running behind her, trying to gather all the pieces and put them back together. But when the machete stays out and keeps chopping, all you end up with is a Frankenstein.
Where I Am Now
That's the fantastic question: How do I live like this?
I sit in this house, isolated in my marriage, but I am ironically healthy in my relationship with who I am. I read my Bible. I have a creative career that I love and am respected in. My mind is always working.
The hardest part is knowing how much I want to give my heart fully to someone with security. I wish I had understood when I met my wife that you can't fix something broken just by sheer will or loving it enough. But I will never say I wouldn't do it again, because I would never sacrifice having my beautiful children.
My children know. My daughter told me how sick it makes her to remember my wife taking her over to the affair partner's house, where she would watch my wife and his wife pick out outfits together. My daughter recently told me that when she and her brother leave for college, I will be alone in the house with my wife, and she thinks I should leave.
My wife talks about wanting grandchildren. It's a beautiful thought, but I have such a hard time envisioning it with her. I see no evidence of full, heartbroken repentance. I see no security that she wouldn't do the same damage to my grandchildren.
I have forgiven her. I'm doing that for myself and for my kids. But forgiveness does not bring closeness, or security, or health, because she hasn't allowed it.
If you are going through this, I want you to know a few things.
1. Those intrusive thoughts—imagining them together, even during moments of intimacy—are a horrible, but normal, part of the trauma. It's a form of dissociation. There is not something wrong with you.
2. Trust your gut. That language that sounds ""off,"" those behaviors that are ""out of character""—they are flags. I learned from research that the kind of language she was using almost always means it is a physical affair, not just ""emotional.""
His wife's aunt was the president of the nonprofit, and he told me that my wife started by ""helping him,"" telling him what things to do with his wife in their sex life, before it turned on him.
3. You can heal. I have come to a point of healing, and it's the most encouraging thing I've learned. Even if you are being lied to and gaslit by the person you gave your whole heart to, you can heal. Your healing does not come based on their truthfulness.",1,1762028906.0,infp,0,1.0,False

Donut shops that offer them seasonally are great, but there’s nothing like biting into a warm fresh donut.

Every year I go on a mission to find the elusive made-to-order apple cider donut spots in the Portland area. A lot of farms and pumpkin patches have them (which is awesome), but I’m hoping to find places where I don’t have to make a full farm trip just to get that perfect warm, fresh, cider-y bite.

So far, I’ve found Koop Kitchen pop-ups. He sets up a table and makes the donuts while you wait. They’re warm, crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, and it's incredible. Pip's is also great for made-to-order, but I haven't seen them make an apple cider dough yet.

Would love to hear about other great spots! Any hidden gems, coffee shops, bakeries, or pop-ups doing fresh made-to-order apple cider donuts in Portland?

Also, I know other people have recently posted questions on Reddit about apple cider donuts, but this is a specific search for warm fresh-made in Portland. ",14,1762028888.0,askportland,3,0.94,False

1oly3at,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalabuse/comments/1oly3at/was_i_really_abused_or_crazy_as_he_said/,Was I really abused or crazy as he said,"Hi everyone, I’d really appreciate it if you could take the time to read this. This story has been heavy on me for months. I finally cut off someone who broke me piece by piece, and writing this feels like my last step to let go. I know some of you will say I should’ve left a long time ago, but it’s not that easy when you’re emotionally trapped.

From the start, he said everything I wanted to hear that he loved me, that we’d get married, that I was his only one, his peace, his priority, the one he’d do anything for. He’d call me 50 or 60 times if I didn’t answer, text me nonstop, and say he couldn’t go a day without hearing my voice. Even during important meetings, he’d hide in the bathroom just to FaceTime me for a few minutes that’s how obsessed he was.

But when it came to actually seeing me in real life, he never showed up. Every single date had an excuse: “I’m sick,” “I’m tired,” “something came up.” And then he’d go to dinner or back to work the same night. I’d get dressed, look beautiful, wait for him, and end up crying in bed. When I told him how hurt I was, he’d turn everything around say I was crazy, dramatic, that I didn’t respect myself, that I needed to stop the “drama” and get back with him.

Still, I stayed, because each time he’d come back saying he loved me and would change. And when he wanted to, he could act so loving and gentle.

He’s rich, powerful with drivers and everything. He could’ve come to me anytime but I think he liked seeing me wait. It gave him control. Yet he couldn’t go even one day without talking to me. If I pulled away, he’d spam my phone, insult me, and tell me I was the reason he acted that way and that he would say anything to piss me off because I treat him as a dog

Today was the day I finally woke up. We had planned a date after he convinced me for 3 days He promised he’d call his driver to come pick me up. I trusted him again. I got ready  wore a dress and heels, looked stunning. And it’s not me saying it everyone who sees me says I’m beautiful, even strangers. Even him even when he was angry, he’d still say I was “extremely beautiful.”

When he didn’t call, I decided to drive myself to his house because I wanted to see what excuse he’d come up with this time.

He came downstairs looking miserable dirty t-shirt with holes, coffee stains all over, flip-flops, smelling like coffee and sweat. And the first thing he said to me, while looking me up and down, was:

“What’s this dress and heels? Are you going into a ball?”

For the first time, I didn’t even feel angry. I just saw how pathetic he looked next to me. I take care of myself that day I looked radiant. He’s short, overweight, unkempt and I never judged him for his looks. I chose him because I thought he had a good heart.

Then he said, “You’re nothing.”you’re not impressing me Then He tried to sit inside my car and said, “Move your dirty bag and your dirty glasses, I don’t want to touch them,” and kicked them with his leg. It was my car, my own car and he acted like he owned it. Then he said, “These glasses are fake as fuck.” My bag was designer, my glasses were real. He just wanted to humiliate me.

Then he said, “I treat you like my employee,” even though I never asked for or accepted a single penny from him. I’ve always paid for myself. He’s never given me anything, and still treated me like I was beneath him.

In the past, he’s told me to “shut up,” “stop opening your dirty mouth,” and once when I was stressed and got my period twice in one month, he said, “You’ll never have kids.” That’s when I realized he wanted to break me down and make me feel worthless because deep down, he felt that way about himself.

When I told him today, “Let’s just say goodbye, we’re done,” he looked at me and said:

“Okay, I have 2–3 girls waiting. I’m gonna fuck a bit since I didn’t fuck you.”

He said that word for word. I just stared at him. I didn’t even cry this time. He’s always told me he says cruel things just to piss me off, but it only shows who he really is.

I blocked him — but he’s been calling me from unknown numbers. He even said, “God will make you pay for the pain you caused me.” When in reality, I was the one crying every single night for months.

He always told me he couldn’t go a day without talking to me, that he’d go crazy if I disappeared. This time, I know he will but I finally won’t.

I chose him for his heart, not for his money or his looks. And I lost so much of myself trying to heal someone who only wanted power, not love.

And the worst part after hurting me in the worst ways possible and I stay silent I tell him I’m going home he tells me look people are looking at you because you’re crazy you have no shame stop this drama and close your mouth and let’s be actually together and work on it

1oly32j,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oly32j,"This Is My Dog- A Labrador/Lurcher Mix- She Was Attacked on 29/10/2025 In County Antrim, Ireland, By An American XL Bully","This big eejit is still like a big puppy. 

On 29/10/2025, I was at my front door about to go out to the car and grab my headphones. My dog was patiently waiting on the front doorstep, in HER own garden, to get in. Through the frosted glass, I see a brown and white dog run up to her and she starts frantically yelping and I can see the two dogs tussling. I thought, “Oh, a normal dog tussle, I’ll open the door and give the other dog a light kick or smack it over the head.” 

To my horror, when I opened the front door, an American XL Bully had its jaws on her. These dogs aren’t allowed to be bred in my country and there are restrictions on pre-existing XL Bullies and their owners. It felt like my heart literally dropped when I saw that it was an XL Bully. 

The XL Bully was going for her throat and attempting to do a death roll (something I’ve only seen alligators do in videos). 

I started screaming, thinking my dog was going to die. My mother and nephew were shouting, “What’s going on?” I started screaming at them, “Don’t go out, don’t go out!” I was afraid that the Bully would turn its attention on my mum or nephew. 

Fight or flight kicked in and I ran into my kitchen, grabbed the first butcher knife I saw, then ran out into my garden. I was thinking I could somehow fatally injure the Bully by sticking a knife into its neck, and I realised I would probably get mauled by the XL Bully in the process, but that is much more preferable than my dog dying, or my mum and/or nephew getting hurt. 

I ran out into the garden, knife gripped in my hand, probably looking like a psycho, only to see that the XL Bully had already run up the street (where kids were playing) because my mum threw her hot coffee on it. 

Because of my mum’s quick thinking, my dog came out mainly unscathed, but very shaken, and nobody else was injured. 

When these dogs were essentially banned, all the Bully owners were saying, “It’s not the dog, it’s the owner!” And posting AI videos of XL Bullies going to heaven with angel wings 🙄

Now, I had my reservations about these “things.” I didn’t think they were more violent than other dogs, but just that, when they attacked, they inflicted much more damage than other dogs because of their musculature and jaw strength. 

I can now understand why they were banned. The attack on my dog was completely unprovoked- she was not barking, growling or even looking at the XL Bully. Heck, she wasn’t even on its territory (again, she was on my front doorstep). Not only that, but the sheer aggression and ruthlessness that I saw in this XL Bully really terrified me. 

I heard a wrap at the front door and opened it. It was the XL Bully’s owner who was shaking and crying, asking, “Is your dog okay?” I guess one of the neighbours alerted her (they had all come outside and were shouting to ask if I was okay). 

I went outside to talk to her and she was saying that she’s “a bit scared” of the dog herself, that she can’t trust it around her grandchildren anymore, that it almost drags her when it’s on a lead, that she is going to get rid of the dog now. I felt sorry for her, but I let her know that the attack was completely unprovoked and I had witnessed it (there’s no wiggle room here for trying to say that the dogs were fighting over a ball or something). 

She said the XL Bully had “escaped” while she was in the shower. She turned up at my door wearing a dressing gown and slippers, with her hair wrapped up in a towel. 

The worst part is that the XL Bully knows my dog and has been friendly with her. The owner also knows my dog and has given her some affection in the past (which I’m now thinking has made the XL Bully jealous). 

The cherry on top? The XL Bully is only 8 months old. Only 8 months old and it’s already massive, aggressive and ruthless.

After all of the dust settled, I went to finally go and grab my headphones from the car. I fainted on the stone pathway in my garden. I sustained some injuries- one of them was gnarly enough. I have an associate who is a solicitor and an associate who is a barrister. I am weighing up legal action, with their guidance. I want to make an example and set a precedent, so that owners of these dangerous dogs get the message. However, I also feel like the lady is also a victim of the animal rights activist propaganda, “It’s the owner, not the dog!”

PSA: These dogs are attack dogs. They are not family dogs. They shouldn’t exist, point blank. They are disproportionately violent, ruthless and strong. They will, and do, attack for the smallest (and stupidest) reasons. People think empathy is a human thing, it’s not. Animals also have empathy. These dogs do not have an ounce of empathy, nor of loyalty. They will turn on their owners too, for reasons we’ll never understand.

1oly2v6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jackery/comments/1oly2v6/backup_power_help/,Backup power help,"I need some help evaluating backup battery options. In a past house we had a 16kw generac with a whole house transfer switch and it worked flawlessly. But we've moved to a townhome now and I'm not sure my fellow unit owners and hoa would allow a standby generator and to run the black pipe for gas and the 2 gauge for power would essentially encircle the entire house between them and cost a fortune in plumber and electrician fees. So I am exploring the idea of battery backup.

I made the mistake of googling a jackery 5k + transfer panel and so now all i get is constant jackery and patriot power ads on youtube and elsewhere. but that is essentially what i am looking for, 5k with the ability to expand, a transfer switch with around 8-12 circuits, outages in my area are of the less than a day type, so I'm not worried about longer runtime and i could pickup a small generator to recharge it if needed for extended outages.

What i am so far not able to find, because search results nowadays are either poisoned or paid for, is some place to compare offerings, advantages and disadvantages of certain makes and models. But I am fairly confident someone in this community either knows directly or knows where I should be looking.

For the circuits I need power for, in order of importance, kitchen outlets (fridge, airfryer, coffee maker), furnace (gas), for heat only. My office, work computers, cable modem and router, Garage, for garage door and deep freeze. maybe the tv room, lesser important would be the bedroom, for cpap, but i already have a 5-6 day backup battery solution for that. bathroom for lights and fan. Our water heater, ac and stove are electric but i am capable of tolerating heat, eating cold food and showering with a washcloth.

What i am wondering is, does anyone have one of these or another manufacturer and have experience and know the good and bad of it. What brands are the best deal. What to look for and what prices to be interested in. I am a veteran so any companies that offer military discounts on top of other discounts would also be nice. I will be looking at black friday deals but often deals before or after black friday have seemed to be better deals, so if something is going on now i would love to know.

the latest deals I see are

I have PCOS, so I just assumed this meant I was out this cycle and have been fine with that, especially since we might be moving next summer, and being due around then would be tough.

However, this AM at 8dpo, I am so incredibly nauseated. And, the weirder thing, my regular coffee made me want to hurl. I have never experienced this in my life, I drink coffee every day and have always loved it.

I don’t feel like I’m trying to psych myself up to convince myself I could be pregnant like I have in the past, because like I said, this would actually be a rough time for it to be happening, and I feel fully okay with not being pregnant right now.

1oly28v,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1oly28v/hoping_this_helps_someone/,Hoping this Helps Someone :),"I’ve been lurking on this sub for months, afraid to make a post and jinx all the benefits I’ve been experiencing since quitting caffeine. I’ve seen a lot of posts lately about if caffeine is actually THAT bad so I want to share my experience which is that yes it can be THAT bad for some people. 

I started drinking coffee regularly when I started my first full time job 6 years ago. It was about 2 cups per day when in the office, then just one a day when the pandemic hit which i stuck to after that (with an occasional coke/soda added in there). So, not a lot of caffeine by a lot of people’s standards. After about a year, i started experiencing random symptoms that, because it was after a year - I did not attribute to caffeine at all. Things like struggling to find the word I wanted more often, loosing my train of thought, feeling like my brain felt “blocked”, increased social anxiety, irritability and just feelings of exhaustion. 

Over the course of 4 years, it continued to get just a little bit worse over time, enough for me to question my sanity. I picked up more symptoms like a COMPLETE mental block and inability to creatively think (ever), trouble focusing, strange eye symptoms (sometimes it felt like I wasn’t viewing things with my own eyes, or my eyes couldn’t focus on a central point), and my social anxiety turned to nonsensical heart palpitations that I could feel in my ears. I knew it wasn’t normal anxiety because it would happen while doing relatively low stress things, like speaking up in a meeting I’d done 100 times before. 

I excelled in college, and I was considered a top performer at work, but this had all started to really impact me while working. In two important meetings, I had to excuse myself due to not being able to slow my heart and literally sounding WINDED while trying to speak. I started to have anxiety about the physical symptoms of my anxiety. 

I went to a neurologist where they did some preliminary testing, and I scored so poorly on their prescreen activities they insisted I get a brain MRI because it was possible I had a tumor. I didn’t. Thankfully. This set me on a year of doctors appointments (because I’m like what the heck why did I score so bad on those tests??)- sleep specialists, cardiologist, endocrinologist, I did every blood test you could think of and just started bypassing doctors and ordering my own through Quest. Everything came back normal, except for picking up an ADHD diagnosis (I was never suspected of ADHD as a kid), and a presumed POTS diagnosis along the way. 

At this point I’m desperate, continuing to struggle with no answers, I was beginning to look into requirements for a short term disability claim and warning my husband that I could not stay in such a mental-dependent job. I decided to do genetic testing because, why not at this point. And one thing that came back was that I am a slow metabolizer for caffeine and it recommended I limit caffeine intake. 

I quit caffeine cold turkey the next day and, after 4 days of sluggish/ zombie feelings, I started to feel better. I don’t know the timelines of when everything reversed but since quitting (with no other changes):
1. I haven’t felt the weird eye feelings since. In fact, during all my issues I got a new glasses prescription that was much worse than what I had. Since quitting, I’ve actually had to revert to my original prescription.
2. My heart has not palpitated in my ears and my anxiety is much, much less. I’m no longer nervous in 95% of situations. 
3. My brain block is gone. My attention is normal. I don’t catch myself forgetting words or loosing my train of thought often at all. 
4. I’m not irritable. Ever. And I’m way more resilient to a busy schedule (no longer overwhelmed by life). 
5. Sleep is better. I don’t jump out of bed in the
morning with energy, but once I get going my energy is stable all day long. 

I’m basically back to being myself, thriving at work and in my life. 

Now, my husband drinks caffeine and (while I think he has room to be less irritable, lol), I don’t believe caffeine affects him negatively. He never experiences anything like what I did. So, I believe people’s tolerance for caffeine lies in genetics and for many it is probably fine. For some (like me) it is poison. If you are experiencing anxiety or anything like what I mentioned, it’s worth quitting and checking how your body reacts. If it doesn’t help, I’m sorry - as someone who tried every random test and supplement and gimmick - I know how hard it is to just want to feel better. Keep going!! ",9,1762028719.0,decaf,2,1.0,False

Inside, it feels like something is pressing down - your chest feels heavy, your thoughts are tangled, and the simple things that used to bring joy now feel empty. Coffee doesn’t warm you, laughter sounds foreign, even your smile doesn’t feel like yours.

You go through tasks, moving in circles, while a void grows inside. And suddenly, you catch yourself thinking: “Is this really all my life is capable of?”

This feeling is familiar to many, but you’re not alone. Fundamental is a community of people who are going through the same thing. Here, you don’t just read advice - people actively work on their inner blocks, discuss real problems, and support each other. It’s a place where you can feel progress and regain control over your life.


Take a moment: which part of your life feels the most exhausting or empty right now? Try to answer honestly. If you want, share it in the comments - sometimes just acknowledging the pain is the first step toward change.

I’ve been working remotely for a while now, and honestly - I love the flexibility, but focus is becoming a real challenge.

Working from home sounds great in theory, but in practice… there’s always something. Kids running around, parents asking for help, siblings popping in with “just one quick question” - and suddenly an hour’s gone. Even with noise-canceling headphones, it’s hard to stay in the zone.

I started wondering - where do you go when you really need quiet, uninterrupted work time?

Coffee shops are noisy, coworking spaces are expensive and far away, and home just isn’t cutting it anymore.

Are there any calm, affordable spots near home - like small private rooms - where you can actually get things done without distractions?

Do anyone else have the same issue?

I studied since August maybe 4 hours a week. I do not have any direct FM job title but I am a manager at a laboratory for close to 10 years. During the time I managed not only the team, operation, and finance, but also the facility. I was never trained on FM but learned it through just having to do that job as well to keep the lab clean, safe, and that darn HVAC running.

My weakest area was project management, real estate, and risk management from the corporate perspective. However, I didn't focus more in those areas, but instead I studied every discipline equally. I didn't want to be too confident in areas I thought I'm strong at. I literally just watched youtube videos on the courses (\~30 hrs total) and paid $20 for the Udemy practice exam (which is the old version). I didn't read any book and didn't take any other official online courses. The Udemy exam was moderately helpful but it helped me realize my test taking strategy needed improvement. I also did the mock CFM exam on the free site proprof; you can find it if you google it.

I did not cramp the night before the exam and just slept 8 hrs and got to the Prometric center early with some strong coffee and a light breakfast. I did take the entire 3 hours to complete the exam. I finished the 120 questions by 2.5 hrs mark, and just spent the last 30 mins to go over questions that I flagged for double checking. I walked out feeling good but wasn't 100% sure.

He also went number 2 for the second time today and there weren't any wipes in the bag. If I don't remember to put things in the bag, my husband doesn't. 

 We gave up and just went home because there weren't any baby friendly places to feed or change him. I'm so angry right now. My husband is definitely a bright side person— ""At least we got out and got a drink and looked at some thing for a bit."" Whereas now I'm more upset than I was before we even left the house. I just can't enjoy the things I used to with a baby. I hate not being able to take my time without constantly worrying when baby will wake up, or if there's a place to change him or feed him. 

My husband isn't the one who is stuck in the house all week. He's probably more chill about our short outing today for that reason.

Regardless I’m choosing to stay with him because I do believe I love him. Too put into context: I have been feeling hurt recently because I feel like he has been putting his last minute plans first or doesn’t take in to consideration my plans, even though I have told him about 2 weeks in advanced, but when it comes to his buddies he drops everything and hangs out with him or gets super angsty for us to go meet up with them that sort of thing. These few months he’s been training for the physical test to become a firefighter and I have seen him train for this. Up to to the test today we’ve hung out with a few of his friends one specific friend who is honestly fat-phobic honestly is always telling all of his friends and I to go work out just because he’s a gym guy and he’s super clean doesn’t drink coffee, body is a temple kind of guy etc. He came over to our apartment and has made many comments that I should make an effort to work out, mind you I’m extremely insecure about my physique and going to the gym because it is something I try to be good about but sometimes I don’t have the time since I’m a full time student and worker but I replied to him friend let’s call him Bob and he said other people are the same or are even parents and still find time to work out you just have to want it… my partner did not say anything to defend me at this moment which is fine because Bob has become a friend so I replied with a smart comment back (mind you I’m 5’0 feet, 125ish so no like fully obese but not super skinny i guess). 

Fast forward Halloween week my partner dropped 3 different plans on me without even asking if it was okay (which I understand he is not my child) but we both share pets and a home space and rely on each other for things, also we work at the same office. So asking each other if it’s okay in our schedule to go places is typically regular but lately he has not been asking. 1 of the plans was the gym with his friends (one being the fat-phobic one which I was still bitter about) even though he told me he was going to the firefighter training so I expected him to go home first for something that I thought he was going to get done first which he did not end up doing. Second for halloween day I had plans with my gfs but he had never set in stone plans with his brother which is fine it ended up being fun but I canceled my plans with my friends to go with him… the other one was my friend asked for US to go watch her dance recital an upcoming Friday and on the phone call he just decided to drop a plan saying he couldn’t  because had a “poker night” with his cousin which is a recent thing he’s been doing with his cousin WHICH HE also found out this week is in the same firefighter program with him. (I AM STILL GOING TO GO WATCH MY FRIEND FOR THIS ONE ON MY OWN)

Cherry ON top: THIS IS WHAT MADE ME MAD. He passed the physical test and I wanted to take him out to eat to celebrate like we always do and he decides to go out with his cousin WHOM he just today found out is EVEN in the program just because he let him borrow pants for the test… and my partner had the audacity to call and ask me if I was mad and still say well I had to plan to buy us celebratory steaks but my cousin invited me out for food instead so I’ll just buy you food when I’m done.  MIND YOU HE JUST STARTED EVEN HANGING OUT WITH THIS COUSIN (same one form poker nights).  ",0,1762028435.0,AmIOverreacting,0,0.5,False

1olxtvc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Situationships/comments/1olxtvc/big_big_rant_about_a_first_time_in_a/,Big big rant about a first time in a situationship. I promise it gets very very interesting!,"Hello guys! It's the first time I am writing in reddit for something like that, so please be gentle with me and don't hate me for the huge rant!! Haha 😅

I (36M) had a thing with a girl (31F) last year, for about 3 months. 
I live in balkans by the way. 
Fact is that I didn't know what a situationship is, until I lived it. So I met this very cute girl in a bar, talked to her, exchanged numbers and started texting about when to set up a date. 

After a few dates, which were perfect, from drinks to theaters and restaurants, we eventually got intimate and had sex. Which was also perfect, every single time, except from maybe the first time, which was somewhat a journey of one discovering another's body. Sex was so good for both, that she even mentioned the fact that after many years she was finding herself enjoying having sex, because in her last big relationship (which was about 3 years) she didn't enjoy sex at all, and that's when she promised to herself that sex would play a big role in her future relationships. She worked evening hours, so about midnight I would go to her house 2 times per week or so, spend the night there (also asking her if she would like me to leave after sex, in order to sleep alone or whatever.. I didn't wanna apply pressure to her, but every time she wanted me there) and then the next day go out for breakfast, coffee and generally stay with her until next day 16:00 when she would have to work. We told each other everything about our lives, and it was obvious that we had a very good chemistry. It felt like it was progressively going into something beautiful, and I liked it. I started having feelings about her because we did all the things that couples do. 
Waking up to find messages and reels from her was such a pleasant surprise for me, because I wasn't used to a woman showing such interest to me. Usually it was the other way round. 
I also received late night calls from her at 03:00, ranting about her past mistakes, the pressure that she felt about her new job and many more.. I was understanding and tried to help her with those issues. 
Fact is that maybe I shouldn't have done that..

Because when we reached 20th of December, we had our last meeting before Christmas break. Again visited her after work, spent the night together, next day went for brunch and shopping, and then kissing each other goodbye for the Christmas holidays which we would spend in different cities with our families and telling each other that we would meet in about 8-10 days. 
So.. During the holidays, she was getting colder in the messages, I could feel that. Slow and taciturn replies, the exact opposite from what I was used to. And at the 30th of December, she texts me this 

""I wanna share something that bothers me with you. Unfortunately, there's no right timing to say something like that. I had a great time with you, but for me it's obvious that we have to stop seeing each other. I can't do this anymore. I am so sorry..""

Needless to say that she fucked my feelings. I never saw it coming, because she had expressed thoughts and feelings that you normally don't share with someone that you plan to just have sex with and then dump him. I tried to reply in a calm and polite way, and we stopped talking after a few texts, because it was obvious that she had made her decision. 10 days later, she wishes me for my name day, around midnight, telling me that she also lost her grandma and she had a bad day. Again, I replied in a polite and respectful way, telling her to reach out to me if she needs something and we never talked again.

NOW, let's go to the REALLY interesting stuff.
I found out that she's in a relationship with a guy since we broke up. From what I can tell, she must have started dating him while we where together, because very shortly after we broke up, they were together. 
Fact is, about a month ago, that this guy is following ANOTHER girl and starting texting each other, while being in a relationship with my ex. Liking her stories, photos, and subtly kind of flirting with her. As a man, you NEVER like photos and stories of a girl you don't even know, when you have a relationship. 
Turns out this girl is a friend of mine and I accidentally found out about him texting her when she received a message from him while we were having a coffee and she showed his profile to me. 

Now, what do I do?
My friend asked me if I want her to follow my ex on Instagram, so that the ex will see the mutual friend (aka the guy) and start having doubts and questions about him, and she even proposed to go one step further, asking the ex out of the blue if she knows the mutual guy, because they have been chatting for a while and she wants to know more about him from someone who knows him, since he's a complete stranger. 

What do you suggest? 
Do I stay put and tell the friend to simply stop talking to him, or do I tell her to go all the way, follow her and talk to her about him? 
I know it's bad for me to say it, but part of me wants a revenge, wants my ex to find out about him talking to other girls.

We all have our own rooms and just share the common spaces. One of the girls is in a ""situationship"" of sorts with a guy for about six months. He was around the previous semester, but really only attempted to befriend me, not any of her other friends. But he also did things like make me file his taxes, took over the bedroom we shared and had me sleep in the living room so he could stay over. 

Well this year, it escalated. He and his friends helped build some of our furniture when we moved in. I felt bad for having to ask and paid for pizza ($50 worth), sent home a card and some snacks, and said thank you more times than I can count. He even told me, ""This is what friends do, don't say thank you anymore"" 

Well when he was upset (because I was talking to my friend, his ""gf"") he started being rude and I said ""don't bite the hand that feeds you"" since I made breakfast for the house and enough for him, made sure there were snacks he could eat in the house, etc. and he got this awful smile on his face and said ""have you ever heard don't bite the hand that builds your furniture"" and just stared at me as I mumbled an apology. I looked to my roommate, my best friend, who knows I have a really hard time asking for help/bad experiences from asking in the past and she just stared, watching and didnt defend me.

I went to process the whole thing with my other roommates and they quickly told me that that was not okay of him, he was a guest in our home and he had no right to treat me that way. They didn't like the way he treated me ever, or the way he treated our friend in their relationship, or how rude he was to us as a whole in our house. So, this resulted in me and my roommates confronting him that night and having us ask him to leave for the night. 

Since he and I were friends previously, we did have a conversation hashing it out, but it ended up in him manipulating me and making me think everything that had gone wrong was all my fault. After this encounter and everything that had happened, my friends and I asked that he not spend time in the common areas and if he came over he had to go straight to her room. 

It has been about a month and things have only gotten worse. He has sent mean and verbally aggressive messages to me, treated us rudely when we ordered from the coffee shop he works at, stared me down when he passes me on campus and I swear he has such a terrible, bone-chilling look. Today, when he glared at me on campus, I felt truly unsafe. 

As for my best friend, she has completely isolated herself for everyone. I have repeatedly told her how uncomfortable he makes me and how awful and uneasy he makes me feel, and she said nothing and continues to bring him into our home. They also like to do the grass in the house even though obviously that is not okay AND all of us other roommates hate the smell. None of the rules we have set are being followed or respected, he makes me terribly anxious, and she has not apologized. 

Am I overracting for wanting to go to someone higher up to file a complaint/formal request for him to not be allowed back in our home? My friends and my mom have suggested filing a formal complaint with the head of our housing department/the police but then that makes me think I am truly overracting.

1olxr2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1olxr2z/why_is_it_a_drink_company_doesnt_understand_how/,Why is it a drink company doesn’t understand how to package drinks to go?????,"Egg carton drink trays cannot safely carry large, heavy iced drinks.  Period. 

(Honestly, I would not use those trays to carry any drinks at all.)

If you are going to put the drinks going out for delivery (doordash etc) into a sealed paper bag and not allow me to use my own drink carriers, then you guys really need to understand how to pack large heavy drinks.

Even Jack-in-the-Box does a better job packaging its drinks to go.  Starbucks execs, read that sentence again.  

You need high cardboard carriers that are almost the height of the drink (the kind with the handle on top, though I know you don’t need the handle if its going into a paper bag). Google “cardboard drink carrier” and you will find them.

I have delivered thousands of meals. I am a careful old lady. And I drive like a careful old lady and handle packages like a careful old lady. In these thousands of orders, I have spilled drinks three times. **All three times the drinks were Starbucks drinks in sealed bags that were handled extremely carefully.**

I have no control over how hard your employee pushes the drink into the 1 inch cardboard tray. But think about it. Would you carry one of your large heavy ice drinks by your fingertips by the bottom of that cup? It is asking way too much of those crappy trays to carry that kind of weight. The smallest turn while driving and yes, a large drink can topple over very easily. 

You are a fancy drink company. There exists packaging that would make it impossible for your drinks to topple over inside a bag. Packaging that other cheap fast food companies use for their drink delivery. And you can’t figure this out?

I do not understand this at all

PS. Your bag stickers also do not actually stick. Like the drink holder, they have one job to do, and they cannot do it. It’s fine if you don’t want to make them overly sticky. But in that case, they need to be two or three times longer. Also, I think your cup lids  have gotten better but for years they would leak all the time when I tried to drink my coffee. I used to say that the McDonald’s lids were so much better than Starbucks. It was like a pleasure drinking from a McDonald’s coffee cup even if you were drinking crappy coffee. That “snick” of the lid sealing on the cup was so satisfying and inspired such confidence in the to go cup. 

I really can’t fathom how this company can be so terrible at drink delivery. 

Anyway, first world problems!

1olxr04,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1olxr04/after_8months_finally_left_after_being/,After 8months finally left after being emotionally and verbally abused while saying he loves me and can’t live without me,"Hi everyone, I’d really appreciate it if you could take the time to read this. This story has been heavy on me for months. I finally cut off someone who broke me piece by piece, and writing this feels like my last step to let go. I know some of you will say I should’ve left a long time ago, but it’s not that easy when you’re emotionally trapped.

I 24f him 28m From the start, he said everything I wanted to hear that he loved me, that we’d get married, that I was his only one, his peace, his priority, the one he’d do anything for. He’d call me 50 or 60 times if I didn’t answer, text me nonstop, and say he couldn’t go a day without hearing my voice. Even during important meetings, he’d hide in the bathroom just to FaceTime me for a few minutes that’s how obsessed he was.

But when it came to actually seeing me in real life, he never showed up. Every single date had an excuse: “I’m sick,” “I’m tired,” “something came up.” And then he’d go to dinner or back to work the same night. I’d get dressed, look beautiful, wait for him, and end up crying in bed. When I told him how hurt I was, he’d turn everything around say I was crazy, dramatic, that I didn’t respect myself, that I needed to stop the “drama” and get back with him.

Still, I stayed, because each time he’d come back saying he loved me and would change. And when he wanted to, he could act so loving and gentle.

He’s rich, powerful with drivers and everything. He could’ve come to me anytime but I think he liked seeing me wait. It gave him control. Yet he couldn’t go even one day without talking to me. If I pulled away, he’d spam my phone, insult me, and tell me I was the reason he acted that way and that he would say anything to piss me off because I treat him as a dog

Today was the day I finally woke up. We had planned a date after he convinced me for 3 days He promised he’d call his driver to come pick me up. I trusted him again. I got ready  wore a dress and heels, looked stunning. And it’s not me saying it everyone who sees me says I’m beautiful, even strangers. Even him even when he was angry, he’d still say I was “extremely beautiful.”

When he didn’t call, I decided to drive myself to his house because I wanted to see what excuse he’d come up with this time.

He came downstairs looking miserable dirty t-shirt with holes, coffee stains all over, flip-flops, smelling like coffee and sweat. And the first thing he said to me, while looking me up and down, was:

“What’s this dress and heels? Are you going into a ball?”

For the first time, I didn’t even feel angry. I just saw how pathetic he looked next to me. I take care of myself that day I looked radiant. He’s short, overweight, unkempt and I never judged him for his looks. I chose him because I thought he had a good heart.

Then he said, “You’re nothing.”you’re not impressing me Then He tried to sit inside my car and said, “Move your dirty bag and your dirty glasses, I don’t want to touch them,” and kicked them with his leg. It was my car, my own car and he acted like he owned it. Then he said, “These glasses are fake as fuck.” My bag was designer, my glasses were real. He just wanted to humiliate me.

Then he said, “I treat you like my employee,” even though I never asked for or accepted a single penny from him. I’ve always paid for myself. He’s never given me anything, and still treated me like I was beneath him.

In the past, he’s told me to “shut up,” “stop opening your dirty mouth,” and once when I was stressed and got my period twice in one month, he said, “You’ll never have kids.” That’s when I realized he wanted to break me down and make me feel worthless because deep down, he felt that way about himself.

When I told him today, “Let’s just say goodbye, we’re done,” he looked at me and said:

“Okay, I have 2–3 girls waiting. I’m gonna fuck a bit since I didn’t fuck you.”

He said that word for word. I just stared at him. I didn’t even cry this time. He’s always told me he says cruel things just to piss me off, but it only shows who he really is.

I blocked him — but he’s been calling me from unknown numbers. He even said, “God will make you pay for the pain you caused me.” When in reality, I was the one crying every single night for months.

He always told me he couldn’t go a day without talking to me, that he’d go crazy if I disappeared. This time, I know he will but I finally won’t.

I chose him for his heart, not for his money or his looks. And I lost so much of myself trying to heal someone who only wanted power, not love.

And the worst part after hurting me in the worst ways possible and I stay silent I tell him I’m going home he tells me look people are looking at you because you’re crazy you have no shame stop this drama and close your mouth and let’s be actually together and work on it

Sunshine greets the coffee pot, as the sunlight sneaks through the blinds

This house was warmer when you were here with me, - but I keep the fire on
Love like ours don’t come easily, it’s even harder now that you’re gone

Well the seasons change as they always do, and the leaves fall where they may
The wind brings them to the ground, they’re so colorful where they lay
I still catch your laughter in that same autumn breeze
And I smile cause it’s a memory that always puts me at ease

Chorus
I leave the window open, let the breeze blow on in
There’s something about your touch though it’s just shadows kissing my skin
We held eachother tight yet we both knew how it could end
But I loved you with all I got, even though it was Dasies in the wind

A tumbleweed will do what it does
But if I can try to save it
I’m going to because-

I’ll immediately think-

made a coffee with an envelope of hot chocolate. not the low cal stuff, just your run-of-the-mill sugary kind. didn't even abstain on a little milk in there. i thought the craving might have been a period thing but I'm shaky as i drink it rn and I've been dizzy all day so i think it was actually my body telling me i was low. so that's good that it can still send me those kinds of signals i guess.

had a biscuit too. worth it to me personally just 'cause im a whore for dipping sauces, and cookies w/ biscuits are the quintessential sweet dipping food. didn't really skimp on the milk/sugar/obligatory mentioned additions like i tend to. not feeling great about it but I'm reasoning it out with myself 'cause a.) this cycle's rough and circumstancially i deserve it and b.) i >!havent eaten anything today!< and despite >!my intake being around ~1000!< over the past two days I'm not really in the business of >!doubling my intake & then immediately fasting the day after!< so it's probably a good idea to at least get some liquid cals in. feeling okay & warmer now which was the goal.

as a sidenote I haven't had hot chocolate in a long time it's really nice. especially this time of year. ive been finding a lot of comfort in sitting out on my porch with a coffee as the leaves change, and i wanted to do that with this, but my neighbors are out at the moment and they're starers. maybe I'll make another coffee once they've cleared out for a bit.
