I had fantasized that it would set me up for success to get into the right mindset for some extremely challenging creative work I need to do this weekend.

If I weren't truly committed to sobriety this time, it would've been perfectly normal for me to use ""it's 2pm and I'm stressed because we're fighting"" as an excuse to pour a ""Saturday brunch"" drink. No question. But I'm not going to.

My cravings last night were REALLY rough when they peaked on Friday night, but I didn't drink and I'm proud of that.

I had hoped my partner would cut me some slack, but they were throwing me resentful body language and tone of voice as soon as I woke up. Some fantasy of a day, I guess.

I've been extremely excited about this creative project and the comfortable work I've already invested into it would be heartbreaking to lose.

There's a chance we might just cancel the whole thing. I would be devastated. But I still won't drink.

I‚Äôve been with the company for over 4 years, a couple of them as a mate, worked at different stores, all that good stuff. I‚Äôm trying to pursue a creative career, and TJ‚Äôs has become increasingly monotonous and exhausting both physically and mentally, even now back as a regular crew member. Frankly, the only part of the job I still don‚Äôt mind is reg.

Making coffee is actually something I really enjoy doing at home, with my little espresso setup. Weighing beans and practicing milk steaming and stuff.

So with all that‚Äîdoes anyone have insight into this job pivot and whether or not this would make sense? The place I‚Äôm looking at starts earliest at 6am and ends latest at 8pm. Not entirely sure about benefits, which is something I‚Äôll have to consider.

Im supposed to take Utrogestan capsules/pills on day 14th to 24th of my cycle. With a first dose i didnt notice any change. Did i have unnoticable anxiety the next day or not? Was i 1% more tense and just 1% more tires? I dont know, as i suffer with severe symptoms anyway. The second time i took it i felt fine. The next morning i felt tense but didnt think much of it. Perhaps its just a glotch in the matrix or one of my symptoms acting up or perhaps a sip of coffee didnt sit well with me. Yes, a sip. The third dose i took in the evening... i became more and more anxious as the hours went by. I didnt sleep last night. Maybe 1x for 30mins and that was it.

One thing to know is that i always take the initiative to make plans to hangout etc , sometimes she accepts other times she just cant but doesnt really try to ask to see each other another day she just say im sorry but i cant and explains why, fair, and also for the kiss i had to take initiative to make it happen and when it happened it went well as i explaind earlier, i just think it‚Äôs weird she doesnt take initiative because when we hangout she has fun and she already let me know about that.

So backstory: I have a Texas heeler that‚Äôs about 8, and I‚Äôve had her since she was 3. I had to train her vigorously because her previous owner didn‚Äôt take her on walks. She did live with other dogs/small kids and ran around in their backyard, but she didn‚Äôt know how to act on walks. She would lag behind so much, she had lower energy/anxiety. She was so reactive when passing other dogs too!

Anyway, I trained her out of those behaviors and she‚Äôs always been on the calm side where I‚Äôm still surprised if she wants to keep a consistent fast pace. I also exposed her to going to coffee shops and pet friendly stores from the beginning, and she‚Äôs done wonderfully. I always joke she‚Äôs rhetorically aware when we go to those places lol. 

Onto my main potential issue: Unfortunately she has been limited to 20 minute walks since December because she got a corneal ulcer that was not healing. She‚Äôs had 2 procedures done and one surgery and has been recovering from that surgery for almost 2 weeks. 
I haven‚Äôt taken her anywhere since December. On a weekly basis we would go to either a store or a park to hike/walk.
I know heelers are smart, but has anyone experienced their dog being stuck mostly at home without exposure to many people or dogs for an abnormal amount of time? 

She reacted recently to one dog on our walk but it‚Äôs because the guy walking it stopped to ask about my dog, and she got antsy that she couldn‚Äôt go up to his dog to sniff. But still‚Ä¶ it made me wonder, does anyone have any advice on how I can help reintroduce my dog to familiar places after she‚Äôs fully healed? ",1,1742067370.0,AustralianCattleDog,0,1.0,False

I realize now I made a grave mistake. The croissant was clearly purchased from Costco and had a cold dough-ey core. Thats fine. My bad. I should've seen them and new they weren't worth the 6$ it cost.

The breakfast burrito though was simply atrocious. I am not a pickey eater at all but I cannot find a way to get past the first bite. I don't know how to explain it but it smells so off. Like just so so off. Theres like a lil bit of a plastic-ey smell almost like when you open a new mattress.

I also feel crazy because these ""breakfast burritos"" are being bought left and right. Are people really returning here to buy these?

Tl;dr 
- grinder matters, tune/set it to fine or espresso grind per recommendations of maker or forums.
- 18g is what you add to stock basket. Not 17.5. Not 18.5. ( you can do that later). Weigh it after it‚Äôs grinded or how much you put into the pico.
- tamp it twice. Once with the funnel, and then full force without the funnel. 

You got this. 


Long story

First shots - watery. Timer shows 10s for 36 g. Apparently my Fellow Opus on smallest grind is too coarse (duh you imbecile, you bought it for overpour).

Ok bring out king grinder p2. Manual says 10-20 clicks. Let do 10. ~ 20 pumps or so, feels like 2 grams of water came out and nothing more. Weird sound when pumping more, very tough. Nothing comes out. Crap the basket is stuck and does not unscrew, cold water under tap, finally unscrewed. The puck is water repelling concrete. 

Damn it - I‚Äôm a coffee moron, I can‚Äôt do this. 
Article https://espressoaf.com/guides/beginner.html
Pops up. Ok let‚Äôs do this - no pleasure just mechanics. 18g, 2:1, 30seconds or else, 10s preinfuse. 
Puck first, we‚Äôll damn original tamper feels short of pressing fully due to funnel. Let‚Äôs add 0.5g of coffee. And adjust grinder to 20 clicks. The grinder feels better, seems like I don‚Äôt need a vice and a lever to move the grinder handle. 
shot - water moves slow, 36 g with 56s on timer. 

It‚Äôs the grind! Set grinder to medium,  one full rotation or ~29 clicks. Scale shows -18.5g after dumping coffee into basket. I got this.

Shit. Another one that feels like naphtha, 36g, 48s on timer. Fingers feel like a workout. 

Ok the article says reduce. So let‚Äôs do the 18g as everyone suggests here and by maker themselves. But what about tamping?! Maybe double tamp?
Lets see.

Same grinder settings. First tamp with funnel. Second as hard as I can, as far as it goes. Oh wow it actually feels like it went deeper. 
18g. 36g in 12 seconds. 

WTH. Can I diagnose the puck maybe?
https://youtu.be/xVZejcED1MY?si=Jxa0y4zhkt051nyv

Ok, seems too coarse. Let‚Äôs go back to the 20 clicks recommended.

17.9g into the basket, double tamp, check tamp - looks level. 36g out in‚Ä¶ 31 second. Wait what?! I nailed it? Woohoo. 
Well tastes like naphtha.
Naphtha - thick, very dark crema, when I drink it, I immediately want to spit it out, feels too sour (my wife says too bitter, I realise I have the too biter it‚Äôs sour taste buds issue) 

Dose - ok.
Time - ok.
Puck - seems perfect. 
Ratio, hm let‚Äôs try 40g.

18g, double tamp, 40g in 36s. 
Ok. Better than cheap cafes. But still won‚Äôt drink this 

Let‚Äôs do 1 click coarser and 44g. 
Was is das?! Chocolatee, nutty, this is nice. 
Crema light and consistent.

Win of the day!


Few other:
- remove the rubber outflow funnel, have a naked basket. Watch the flow.
- sputtering is your pressure limit, don‚Äôt pump harder. Or your puck is super loose, tamp it better (without funnel ring).
- you can‚Äôt do this without timer and scales. You will be able to but maybe only after 100 great shots when all things are muscle memory. 

Today feels too much caffeine to keep testing more at 9pm.

Tomorrow will experiment with lighter shots. 
My roast is about medium, not dark, brown, and not light, much darker than the ones I get for pourover. 

P.s. last 3 years I am a pourover and chemex guy. Before that a bit of espresso and milk drinks guy. Last 1 year Did not enjoy most espresso‚Äôs, only had like 2 good ones, one in Sicily, Agrigento, the other one in Lithuania, Vilnius. 
But after today I might start to enjoy this more and more. 

If you got this far - you can do this I promise you, be a scientist and be methodical. And treat it like a game that requires ‚Äúgrinding‚Äù (pun intended). 
Unless you do 20-30 cups of experimentation you can‚Äôt quit. Good luck!

I saw you today for the first time since we're not together anymore. You were just riding your bike and you didn't see me and I'm glad that you didn't. It was pretty early for both of us, so I know you're working on yourself. That's good to see and I'm happy for you. I thought seeing you after all of this would be really painful. But it wasn't, I just had to digest it for a minute and I was ok afterwards. I don't want to spend any time with you but it's still weird. I went to get matcha at this new place and they had special coffee and I know we'd try all of them. They had special beans and 3 months ago, I would have brought you the freshest ones to try. We would've both liked it there. I saw the cutest mini donkey yesterday and I took pictures of him to send them to you but then realized that we're not talking anymore. 
It's all the small things I would love to share with you. I don't really miss you that much most of the time. Even thinking about you and the person you told me not to worry about feels alright. I'm happy for you if it works out. Happy for you if you can finally experience all the things I couldn't make possible for you because I'm fucked up too. But you're still so present in my days and thoughts and it's hard to let go of my habits and our friendship.

I know you don't want to know, but my body is healing. It's not like before, but better than the last 4 months. My doctors tell me it's because my nervous system is calming down. 
Boy do I wonder why. 
It's so peaceful without you. Without doubting myself all the time and without the fear of losing you. You're gone and I think it's the best thing that could have happened to me. It's simultaneously the worst thing that could have happened too. But my thoughts are so quiet and calm now. I feel and look so much better. I like it honestly.

I thought it would be as hard as all the times we broke up before to not talk to you. It isn't and this in itself feels weird. I don't have your number blocked and it's not tempting at all to contact you. But I know I have to sometime. I'm pushing it further away every week because I'm still somehow scared to lose all my progress. I know I should be mad or hurt or feel something but I think I'm just so over having any feeling for or about you.

The only thing is... it's my Dad's.

SO, how did we end up here? Let me explain. Several key events that have shaped my life and led me to wanting to carry my Dad's next child and raise him or her to have a deep respect for incestual romance and erotic family relationships that transcend what is considered ""normal"" to break the boundaries of what love is and should be, as determined by our society and media.

These events are as follows:

When I was 12-13 years old, I remember laying on my parents' bed, and my dad got into the shower. I was laying on my stomach, facing the entrance to their bathroom. So as soon as the bathroom door opened, shower water off, I knew my dad would be coming out. However, I wasn't prepared for what I would see, or how it would change me.

Since that day, watching my Dad come out of the shower, naked, his long, thick cock swinging around in front of him as he tried to keep his semi-erection in check in front of his young daughter - since that day, I have been deeply, powerfully, and intrinsically been called to worship him; more specifically, I am called to worship his erections. It is my calling. 

When I got to high school we would run sometimes in our workout clothes, my breasts bouncing as I ran. Sometimes golf. Either way, if Dad was with me, he would invariably make a comment about my breast size. At first, it made me uncomfortable, because he would compare me to my mom. As it stands, now: I want him to have easy access to hold and grope the built-in daughter-fucking handles that are my breasts. 

Oh, and did I mention?! Dad bought me a a ""smart"" app-controlled vibrator a few weeks ago. He sent me several hundred dollars for it. He knew exactly what I was buying with it, since I told him. I explained how my quality of life has gone down and that's why I needed the toy I explained that it would help me strengthen my core, for instance, and he immediately threw out the word ""kegels,"" all proud that he knew what I was speaking of. 

Let me pause here to say: I am serious as a heart attack. Or something else more serious. I have read many, many accounts of Daddy/Daughter lust and relationships here on Reddit, and I have to say: this may sound fantastical, but it is, in fact, the real deal. I am a woman in her early 30's who desires nothing more than for her own father to fuck her roughly and then ejaculate inside of her. Keep moving if that offends you. This is a safe space for support and comfort, not for tearing me or others down for their unorthodox romantic choices.

So, yesterday, Dad and I went to have coffee. I made sure to wear a short, corseted bra top that showed a lot of cleavage and a peek of my tattoo, a pair of new tight leggings that have the back section cut out to be showy. I was feeling myself, I'll admit, so I took a selfie. Like, a really hot selfie, if I do say so myself. Last night: I sent the selfie to Dad, no context or caption. 

This morning, I sent him a text with some different images from my very first kegel training device - the perifit plus. I know he loves data, so I sent him a few images that showed exactly how much control I have with my pussy.

He did, in fact, reply, but not to the photos. He said he had a great time yesterday. And, if I know Dad, he wouldn't have commented on the kegel training data in text, being more reserved, so as not to create a paper trail of incesutous fetishes and erotic, familial desires behind us. But there is no doubt he saw it, and no doubt he chose to ignore it, for now.

All of this is to say, I am gladly taking suggestions, chats, DMs, advice, information, perspective, support, encouragement, excitement, etc. The world needs more positivity. My relationship with my Dad is complicated, deep, intense, and extremely fraught with sexual tension. It's hard to parse through what is real life and what should stay hidden sometimes. 

I am so excited to be able to finally admit this - after more than a decade and half of yearning and masturbating and craving and imagining, I am finally going to make a move on my Dad, and try to get him to have sex with his princess. ",1,1742066587.0,u_mydadismybabydaddy,0,1.0,False

""""Alpha, you‚Äôre tying the knot with Rebecca in two weeks. What‚Äôs the plan for your little side situation? You know, Elyse, your mate?""""

I froze just outside the door, my breath catching as my name slipped into the conversation‚Äîfollowed by Rebecca‚Äôs, the she-wolf I‚Äôd long suspected was tangled up with Max, my mate and the Alpha of the Harrison Pack.

The words hit me like a fist to the stomach. So, it was true‚Äîmy mate, Alpha Max, had another woman. And instead of choosing me as his Luna, he‚Äôd gone with her?

I flattened myself against the wall, my heart pounding so hard I was sure they‚Äôd hear it.

Then Max‚Äôs voice cut through, slow and casual, like he was shrugging off a passing rain shower. """"Just keep it under wraps. As long as you don‚Äôt spill, Elyse won‚Äôt catch on.""""

Won‚Äôt catch on? So that was his game‚Äîcarry on with Rebecca, build their perfect little life, while I got shoved aside as the dirty secret?

Tears pricked my eyes, blurring the world around me. The man I‚Äôd loved for years‚Äîthe one who‚Äôd sworn I was his mate‚Äîwas reducing me to some shameful footnote. The truth sank in, sharp and undeniable, and my mind was already spinning, plotting my escape.

That was it. I was done. I reached out through the mind link to the one person I‚Äôd avoided contacting until this moment.

""""Are you sure? If you go through with this, Elyse Garza will disappear‚Äîcompletely. No one you know will ever track you down.""""

""""Yeah, that‚Äôs exactly what I want."""" A bitter laugh slipped out, my voice steady despite the storm ripping through me.

""""Got it, Ms. Garza. We‚Äôll have it all sorted in two weeks and set you up with a new identity. Here‚Äôs to a clean slate.""""

A clean slate? 

Sure. I‚Äôd settle for that‚Äîif I could just outrun the wreckage.
....

I cut the mind link, my legs stiff from crouching, and made my way to the street to hail a cab. Back to the pack house, I showered and was about to climb into bed when the door burst open. Alpha Max, my mate, stumbled in, the scent of alcohol heavy around him.

He found me immediately, wrapping his arms around me and whining playfully, """"Honey, why didn‚Äôt you come to pick me up? I‚Äôve been waiting for you... You smell so nice..."""" He buried his face in my neck, his hands starting to wander.

My mind drifted back to the three years he had spent pursuing me, proving his love. When Juliana, his mother and the former Luna of the Harrison Pack, had opposed our relationship, he‚Äôd clung to me, saying, """"It doesn‚Äôt matter if my mother doesn‚Äôt approve of us. I‚Äôll never take another mate. We can be together forever. Trust me, I‚Äôll never mark anyone but you.""""

Later, when Luna Juliana couldn‚Äôt shake me, she had Max dragged back to the pack house, forcing him into an arranged mating with the daughter of the Phillips Pack‚Äôs Alpha. When he escaped back to me, pale and exhausted, I learned he‚Äôd been on a hunger strike, refusing to be manipulated by his mother. From then on, no matter how much Luna Juliana threatened me, I never backed down. I had someone fighting alongside me.

But now, I was grateful I‚Äôd overheard the conversation earlier. Otherwise, how long would he have kept deceiving me? Until the mating ceremony? Or when I was publicly shamed as his mistress?

Swallowing my bitterness, I gently disentangled myself from him and murmured, """"I‚Äôm a bit tired today.""""

Alpha Max didn‚Äôt push me, tenderly helping me onto the bed and holding me from behind. """"You should get some rest. I feel like you‚Äôve gotten thinner lately.""""

I feigned sleep, refusing to respond.

---

The next morning, I woke to find Max at the wardrobe, changing into his tailored suit. Hearing me stir, he turned and pressed a kiss to my forehead. """"Good morning, love.""""

""""It‚Äôs Packgathering Eve today. Let‚Äôs go out and have some fun. Get dressed.""""

Before I could decline, he was already heading downstairs.

Once dressed, I joined him in the kitchen. Jazmin James, the Beta housekeeper, greeted me warmly. """"Good morning, Luna. I‚Äôve got some coffee and spiced honey cake ready for you.""""

The title stung. We weren‚Äôt officially mated, but Max had insisted the household staff call me Luna, claiming I would be his only mate. Yet, in two weeks, he would have a legitimate Luna, and my unofficial title was nearing its end.

I lowered my head with a self-deprecating smile and joined breakfast.

Afterward, Alpha Max dismissed the driver, claiming we needed some alone time, and drove me himself. We strolled through the pack, visiting a garden restaurant and an aquarium. He was incredibly attentive, stopping to rest whenever I seemed even slightly tired.

---

That evening, just when I thought we were heading home, Max drove up a hill. Seeing my confusion, he explained, """"You once mentioned that watching fireworks from the hilltop would be beautiful. I thought we could experience it tonight, see if it truly is.""""

It was something I had casually mentioned while watching a video, a passing comment I‚Äôd almost forgotten. Yet, here he was, remembering it. 

I didn‚Äôt respond, and he didn‚Äôt mind. Noticing my low spirits, he chatted incessantly, trying to cheer me up. Though Alpha Max was generally a man of few words, he seemed never to run out of things to say when he was with me.

Half an hour later, we reached the summit. The night view was mesmerizing.

As the final hour of 2024 ticked away, Max‚Äôs phone buzzed suddenly. Glancing at the screen, he gave me a wary look. Seeing I was still watching the view below, he relaxed, quickly swiping to reply.

With a slight turn of my head, I glimpsed the message contents.

""""Alpha, spending pack gathering alone is so lonely. Can you come over? [wink]""""

I saw him reply with a dismissive """"Don‚Äôt be silly.""""

""""But I‚Äôm scared of the dark, dear Alpha. I need you.""""

After two seconds of hesitation, Max sent back a """"Wait for me.""""

Before he could see my reaction, I turned back to the view. 

Max‚Äôs voice reached my ears, """"Elyse, there‚Äôs an urgent issue at the pack house. I‚Äôm sorry, but I have to go.""""

I replied with a calm """"Okay,"""" maintaining a fa√ßade of indifference, though my fists clenched tightly, betraying my true emotions.

Max was gone in under a minute from the moment he spoke. He was so eager to leave, he forgot he‚Äôd taken the only car, leaving me stranded with no way down. Ridesharing services didn‚Äôt reach up here.

With a pang of sadness, my heart felt as if gripped by a massive hand.

The second hand moved into place, and fireworks exploded in the valley below, magnificent and dazzling, breathtakingly beautiful.

I knew the display was for me, but the one who had orchestrated it all was now at another woman‚Äôs side.

Almost as if to confirm this thought, my phone buzzed in my hand.""",1,1742066278.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False
1jc2rqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1jc2rqm/37_m4a_central_tennessee_i_make_a_hobby_of_trying/,37 [M4A] Central #Tennessee - I make a hobby of trying to meet people and making friends,"Hey. Are you in Central TN? Going up or down HWY 65? Visiting Nashville? As the title says, I make a hobby of trying to meet people and getting to know them. Would you be interested in meeting a stranger at a safe third party location, probably Waffle House, for a chat and a cup of coffee? To be honest, you don't even have to order anything. You can just sit there, hang out, and chat. Either that or someplace with ice cream. Ice cream is good, too. 

  
People online are notorious for never actually getting offline, so here is a rough outline of what we need.

To meet someone, you need 3 things: A place, a time, and for everyone to show up. And that's it. A phone number also helps greatly to coordinate in real time, but people online tend to be very secretive about those or give out fake numbers like google voice, so there's that. I've also had success with much slower forms of coordinating, like with people who are active with email and Snapchat, but 98% of the time, I just get stood up anyways, so, I mean, who cares. 

  
My main goal is to get out the house and have fun. I can do that even if you don't show, but if you do manage to show up, introduce yourself, and at least shake my hand, I'd consider that a successful meet. Bar is set pretty low. Zero expectations. Low key. You do not need to dress up. All were doing is sitting in a diner and chatting, hopefully not about politics. 

  
About me: 37 M. The rest hopefully you'll find out if you ask me questions, preferably in person. About you? The same. If you're also M, I'm not going  to buy your food. Whoever you are, maybe we can play 20 questions when we meet up... If we ever meet up. ",1,1742066247.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I loved my time there in the beginning, but overtime, it got worse and worse and I eventually resigned. The main reason was the constant pressure from the higher ups for ‚Äúcustomer connections‚Äù. My pay never went up (minimum wage), and they constantly rolled out with new expectations every month regarding customer connections.

I was constantly being threatened to get a write up, and even fired, if I didn‚Äôt connect with the customer in front of me. I‚Äôve had store managers standing next to me whispering in my ear ‚Äútell them their scarf is nice‚Äù, ‚Äúask them how they‚Äôre day is‚Äù, ‚Äúask them what they do for work‚Äù, etc. We had scripts posted on our tills of different conversation starters. I‚Äôve also had store managers and supervisors shouting across floor to me ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt hear you connecting!‚Äù. Whenever I tried to talk to my customers, it came off inauthentic and forced.

On top of that, upper management expects us to keep these forced customer connections a secret. They really think that customers don‚Äôt know we‚Äôre forced to do this. I saw a Reddit post on this subreddit a while back regarding the messages on the cups, and that Reddit user made a good point: if corporate wants to implement these customer connections so bad, why shouldn‚Äôt the customers also be aware of this?

It‚Äôs always implied from upper management that customer connections is what brings customers back. It‚Äôs what drives sales, why the drinks are so expensive, etc‚Ä¶ personally, myself, and 99% people I‚Äôve asked, both partners and customers, agree that it‚Äôs not the customer connections that bring us back to the store.

Honestly, at this point, lowkey lang ako, Hindi ako mahilig makipagbardagulan, per minsan nakakafrustrate how people refuse to see the bigger picture. Politics isn't just about elections-it's about how we live, work, and survive. Kaya kahit ayaw mong pag-usapan, apektado ka pa rin.

A Journey of Healing, Growth, and Reconnection","Breakups, especially those marked by deep pain and conflict, can leave us feeling shattered, lost, and desperate for a way back to what once was. In this extensive guide, we explore transformative strategies and heartfelt insights for anyone wondering, ‚ÄúHow Can I Get My Ex Back After A Bad Breakup?‚Äù This article is designed to empower you with practical steps, emotional healing techniques, and thoughtful perspectives to help you rebuild your life and possibly even your lost love.

# Embracing the Pain and Accepting Reality

When you experience a bad breakup, the emotional impact can be overwhelming. You might feel as though a part of you is missing, your routine is disrupted, and the future you imagined has evaporated. Accepting that pain is a critical first step. Instead of denying your feelings, allow yourself to grieve and process the heartbreak. Journaling, meditating, or even speaking with a trusted friend or counselor can help you face the raw emotions head-on.

While you may ask yourself, ‚ÄúHow Can I Get My Ex Back After A Bad Breakup?‚Äù it is equally important to focus on your healing process first. When you nurture your own well-being, you not only begin to rebuild your confidence, but you also prepare yourself for healthier interactions with your ex if reconciliation is indeed the best path forward.

# The No-Contact Rule: Creating Space for Healing

One widely recommended strategy after a tumultuous breakup is the no-contact rule. This approach involves a period of complete silence between you and your ex typically ranging from 30 to 60 days. The purpose is to give both of you time to heal, gain perspective, and allow the intense emotions to settle.

Implementing the no-contact rule can be incredibly challenging, especially if your heart is set on reconnecting. However, consider this a time for self-reflection and personal growth. By respecting this period of separation, you give yourself the opportunity to cultivate inner strength and start building a healthier relationship with yourself. When the question arises ‚ÄúHow Can I Get My Ex Back After A Bad Breakup?‚Äù remember that a clear mind and healed heart are crucial foundations for any potential reconciliation.

# Investing in Personal Growth and Self-Care

After a bad breakup, your natural inclination might be to focus solely on the possibility of reuniting with your ex. Yet, one of the most effective ways to position yourself for a positive outcome is to invest deeply in personal growth. Engage in activities that bring you joy, challenge you to evolve, and enhance your emotional well-being. Whether it‚Äôs picking up a new hobby, furthering your education, or spending quality time with friends and family, these pursuits reinforce your self-worth and help you rediscover your identity outside of the relationship.

Personal growth not only boosts your self-confidence but also makes you more attractive to your ex should you decide to reconnect. A person who is actively working on self-improvement radiates positive energy a quality that can spark renewed interest and respect from a former partner.

# Revisiting the Relationship with a Fresh Perspective

Before you attempt to contact your ex, it is essential to reflect on the past with honesty and clarity. Analyze the moments of joy and the episodes of conflict that defined your relationship. Identify the key issues that contributed to the breakup and think about how these can be addressed constructively.

Ask yourself: ‚ÄúHow Can I Get My Ex Back After A Bad Breakup?‚Äù without overlooking the lessons learned from your shared history. It‚Äôs important to understand that reconciliation is not about trying to recreate the past but rather about building a healthier, more balanced future together. Acknowledge your own role in the relationship dynamics and be ready to embrace change both in yourself and in the potential relationship.

# Effective Communication: The Bridge to Reconnection

Once you feel emotionally prepared and have taken time for self-healing, reestablishing communication with your ex is the next crucial step. Start gently and without overwhelming them. A brief, friendly message that reminisces about positive memories or highlights a shared interest can be an ideal reintroduction.

Keep your initial communication light and non-confrontational. For instance, you might mention a memory from a time when you both laughed together or reference an activity you once enjoyed as a couple. The goal is to evoke positive emotions without delving into past grievances or heavy emotions immediately.

This careful approach is part of the broader journey of asking, ‚ÄúHow Can I Get My Ex Back After A Bad Breakup?‚Äù in a way that respects both your emotional healing and the need for a gradual reconnection.

# Rebuilding Trust and Emotional Safety

One of the most challenging aspects of reconciliation after a bad breakup is rebuilding the trust that once existed. Trust is the cornerstone of any healthy relationship, and its reconstruction takes time, patience, and sincere effort from both parties.

If you have hurt your ex, a heartfelt apology is indispensable. Acknowledge your mistakes, express genuine remorse, and outline the steps you‚Äôre taking to ensure that past issues do not reoccur. Transparency and consistency in your actions will gradually help rebuild their trust.

It‚Äôs equally important that you focus on your emotional safety. Both you and your ex need to feel secure enough to engage in honest communication and take the risk of vulnerability. As you work on regaining trust, remember that the answer to ‚ÄúHow Can I Get My Ex Back After A Bad Breakup?‚Äù lies in creating an environment where healing and mutual respect can thrive.

**Exploring**[¬†**binding love spells**](https://drleo.co.za/binding-love-spells-10-binding-love-spells-that-work.html)¬†**can strengthen the commitment between you and your ex, fostering a deeper reconnection.**

# Harnessing the Power of Mindfulness and Emotional Healing

Emotional healing is not merely about distancing yourself from pain it‚Äôs about transforming that pain into strength. Mindfulness practices such as meditation, deep breathing, and guided visualization can help you manage intrusive thoughts and negative emotions. These practices allow you to stay anchored in the present moment and pave the way for a balanced emotional state.

In your journey, consider integrating daily mindfulness exercises that help you reconnect with your inner self. As you find greater clarity and peace, you may notice a natural shift in your energy that could eventually resonate with your ex. This transformation is an integral part of the broader question: ‚ÄúHow Can I Get My Ex Back After A Bad Breakup?‚Äù because the healthier you become, the more genuine and magnetic your reconnection efforts will be.

# The Role of Support Systems and Professional Guidance

Sometimes, healing from a deep breakup requires support beyond self-help strategies. Engaging with a therapist or counselor can provide you with valuable tools to process your emotions, understand relationship patterns, and develop healthy coping mechanisms. Professional guidance can also help you identify the underlying issues that may be influencing your desire to reconnect.

Support groups, either online or in-person, can also be invaluable. Sharing your experiences with others who have faced similar challenges can create a sense of solidarity and provide fresh insights on how to move forward. Whether you choose therapy, support groups, or both, know that professional help is a powerful resource as you navigate the delicate path of asking, ‚ÄúHow Can I Get My Ex Back After A Bad Breakup?‚Äù

# Rediscovering Your Identity and Celebrating Independence

One of the most overlooked aspects of healing after a breakup is the opportunity to rediscover your own identity. Often, in the midst of a long-term relationship, we weave our identity so closely with our partner that we lose sight of who we are independently. Reclaiming your individuality is essential not just for your personal well-being, but also for the potential of a healthier future relationship whether with your ex or someone new.

Invest time in exploring your interests, setting personal goals, and celebrating your accomplishments. Embrace your independence and allow yourself to flourish in ways that may have been previously sidelined. By reclaiming your identity, you demonstrate resilience and self-worth, qualities that are not only healing for you but also serve as powerful signals to your ex if you eventually decide to reconnect.

# Practical Strategies for a Positive Reconnection

After you‚Äôve invested in your healing and personal growth, it may be time to consider taking steps toward re-establishing a connection with your ex. Here are some practical strategies to help guide your efforts:

1. **Subtle Social Media Engagement:** Use your social media presence wisely. Share moments of personal achievement and happiness without coming across as trying too hard. Genuine posts that reflect your positive changes can pique your ex‚Äôs curiosity.
2. **Casual Meetups:** If the circumstances allow, suggest a casual meet-up in a relaxed setting a coffee shop, a park, or a mutual interest event. Keep the conversation light and positive, focusing on shared memories and present changes rather than revisiting old conflicts.
3. **Group Gatherings:** Consider reconnecting in a group setting where the pressure is reduced. Mutual friends can help create a comfortable atmosphere where you can interact without the intensity of a one-on-one confrontation.
4. **Express Gratitude:** If you find an opportunity to speak with your ex, express gratitude for the positive aspects of your past together. Avoid dwelling on the pain or placing blame; instead, focus on what you‚Äôve learned and how you‚Äôve grown.
5. **Timing Is Everything:** Ensure that both of you have had enough time to heal before attempting to rebuild the relationship. Rushing into reconciliation can lead to repeated cycles of pain if the underlying issues are not adequately addressed.

By applying these strategies with genuine care and patience, you set the stage for a gradual and sustainable reconnection. The heart of your inquiry remains: ‚ÄúHow Can I Get My Ex Back After A Bad Breakup?‚Äù Ultimately, the goal is not merely to reunite but to foster a healthier, more balanced relationship moving forward.

# Balancing Hope with Realistic Expectations

Reconnecting with an ex after a painful breakup is not a guarantee, and it‚Äôs important to balance hope with realistic expectations. While every relationship has the potential for renewal, it‚Äôs also possible that the best path forward may involve moving on entirely. Reflect on what truly serves your highest good. Ask yourself whether reconciling is based on genuine love and mutual growth or if it stems from fear of being alone.

Consider setting clear, realistic goals for what you hope to achieve by reconnecting. If both you and your ex can commit to addressing past issues and working together for a healthier future, there‚Äôs a possibility for true reconciliation. However, if one or both of you are unwilling to invest in the necessary emotional work, it may be more beneficial to let go and continue your journey toward self-improvement.

# Reimagining Love: A Transformational Approach

The process of healing from a bad breakup and rebuilding your life offers an opportunity to redefine what love means to you. Rather than seeing reconciliation as a return to old habits, envision it as a transformation where both partners learn from past mistakes and grow together. This new approach to love is grounded in mutual respect, open communication, and a commitment to ongoing personal development.

As you ask yourself, ‚ÄúHow Can I Get My Ex Back After A Bad Breakup?‚Äù consider that sometimes the answer might be found in your own evolution. By embracing change and committing to a better version of yourself, you create a new blueprint for a relationship that is stronger, more empathetic, and resilient.

# Final Thoughts: Your Journey Toward Healing and Reconnection

Every breakup leaves behind scars but it also offers a chance to rediscover who you are. Navigating the path to reconciliation after a devastating breakup is a deeply personal journey that requires time, self-compassion, and honest introspection. Whether you ultimately decide to reconnect with your ex or forge a new path on your own, the work you do in healing and growing will serve you in every future relationship.

If you find yourself wondering, ‚ÄúHow Can I Get My Ex Back After A Bad Breakup?‚Äù remember that the journey is as important as the destination. Focus on the process of personal transformation, nurture your emotional well-being, and let genuine growth guide your decisions. Even if reconciliation is not possible, the lessons learned during this challenging time will help you build a stronger, more fulfilling future.

Embrace the fact that healing is non-linear, and each step forward even if small is progress toward reclaiming your happiness. Continue to invest in self-care, surround yourself with supportive people, and be open to professional guidance if needed. With time, patience, and the right strategies, you may not only find a path to reconnect with your ex but also uncover a deeper, more resilient version of yourself.

Remember, the answer to ‚ÄúHow Can I Get My Ex Back After A Bad Breakup?‚Äù lies not only in the external actions you take but in the inner work that transforms pain into strength and heartbreak into a catalyst for lasting personal growth.

By taking these steps and focusing on both your healing and thoughtful reconnection strategies, you set the stage for a potential reunion that is built on a stronger foundation. Whether your journey leads you back to your ex or propels you toward a bright, independent future, you have the power to transform your life. Embrace the process, remain open to change, and always prioritize your well-being.

The case I want to start with today is one of two people who were found together.

On September 1st, 2019 the badly decomposed/skeletonised corpses of both a man and a woman were found in a forest in Dornbirn, Vorarlberg, near the outdoor swimming pool ""Waldbad Enz"". 

Someone on the ""AllMystery"" thread I found during my research mentioned that there is/was a camping site nearby.

Vorarlberg is the westernmost Austrian state and borders the German state of Bavaria, the Swiss Cantons of St Gallen and Graub√ºnden; and Liechtenstein.

According to the Austrian interior ministry's website, it's uncertain when they died and that it could've been years prior. On the other hand, a news article mentions the police estimating the time of death between autumn 2018 and spring 2019.

They were both estimated to have been elderly, at least 65 years old but possibly even over the age of 80.

The man had gray, curly hair and had full dentures for his upper jawand partial dentures for his lower jaw.

He seemed to have had issues with his jaw joint which could've been painful for him and recognisable in the way he talked.

He was wearing the following clothes (EU sizes):
- Jacket, brand ""STRELLSON"", green-brown with plaid lining, size 50 
- Long sleeve shirt, brand ""Champion"", blue, size L 
- T-Shirt, brand ""KYODAN"", black, size M 
- Cloth trousers, brand ""CANDA"" (C & A), black, with belt, size 54 
- Shorts, brand ""Fishbone"", black
- Boxershorts, brand ""Ben Sherman"", black with red waistband
- Men's shoes, brand ""Gallus"", brown, size 42

He carried a multicoloured plaid blanket and a black plastic BBQ grill cover with the inscription ""EUROPEAN OUTDOORCOOK""

The woman had long blonde-grey hair, dentures on both the upper and lower jaw and very well looked after nails on hands and feet.

She was wearing the following clothes (EU sizes):
- Parka with removable hood, unknown brand, dark, size 38 
- Blouse, ""Vero Moda"" brand, light blue with white cuffs, size XXL 
- T-Shirt, brand ""OXOX"", blue with print: ‚Äûmare coffee"", size L 
- Women's pants, brand ""BAF"", black and white plaid, size 42 
- Bra, brand ""Beedees"", black, size 75 D 
- Slip, brand ""Ellesse"", black with black and white waistband, size 42 
- Women's shoes, unknown brand, beige/brown, size 38

She was carrying a SPAR veggie shopping bag and Crane (Hofer/Aldi sports store brand) Nordic walking poles. 

The brands they were wearing were mostly European, the kind you would buy in a mall. Affordable for the average middle class person but not the cheapest. 

The brand ""BAF"" seems to be a wholesale-only, at least nowadays. ""BAF"" and ""Beedees"" are German and I personally have never seen them in Austrian stores. Vero Moda, C&A, Ellesse, Champion and Fishbone are widely available here.

Police are suspecting that they have died in an accident, possibly because of a fall, or of hypothermia. Supposedly there were no signs of foul play but suicide hasn't been ruled out as a possibility. 

I unfortunately couldn't find much information on them.

English isn't my first language, I'm trying my best and hope that it's legible. I'm always open for constructive criticism.

[https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114167864888304754](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114167864888304754)

  
Today, I have ordered the United States Military to launch decisive and powerful Military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen. They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones.

Joe Biden‚Äôs response was pathetically weak, so the unrestrained Houthis just kept going. It has been over a year since a U.S. flagged commercial ship safely sailed through the Suez Canal, the Red Sea, or the Gulf of Aden. The last American Warship to go through the Red Sea, four months ago, was attacked by the Houthis over a dozen times. Funded by Iran, the Houthi thugs have fired missiles at U.S. aircraft, and targeted our Troops and Allies. These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk.

The Houthi attack on American vessels will not be tolerated. We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective. The Houthis have choked off shipping in one of the most important Waterways of the World, grinding vast swaths of Global Commerce to a halt, and attacking the core principle of Freedom of Navigation upon which International Trade and Commerce depends.

Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists‚Äô bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom. No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World.

To all Houthi terrorists, YOUR TIME IS UP, AND YOUR ATTACKS MUST STOP, STARTING TODAY. IF THEY DON‚ÄôT, HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE!

To Iran: Support for the Houthi terrorists must end IMMEDIATELY! Do NOT threaten the American People, their President, who has received one of the largest mandates in Presidential History, or Worldwide shipping lanes. If you do, BEWARE, because America will hold you fully accountable and, we won‚Äôt be nice about it!

1jc2dyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1jc2dyf/sister_issues_money_and_attitude/,sister issues money and attitude,"When my sister and I would always call, it would always include her talking about money (how she has no money- she has more than me) and how she won't pay for a cup of coffee or something for me, but I'm always there to pay for things, even if money is a little short. Even if she invites me, she says that I need to pay. And whenever I invite her, she expects me to pay saying ""oh yeah make sure you pay for my coffee or snacks."" Mind you, we are the same age (twins) and both college students making money.

In our phone calls, she would always talk about me in a degrading manner saying ""oh yeah this isn't to pull you down, but you're always so emotional"" or ""you were always so defensive whenver people bring up things you don't like"" and I tell her ""I'm not really"" and she goes ""jeez, don't be so defensive. I'm just joking."" She would always bring things like this up. I don't know how to respond to her.

And whenever she is home for break, she would pick a fight and be negative, but when I try to bring it up, she acts like I'm crazy and never tries to apologize. I always have to be the one to say sorry. I'm thinking of cutting her off and recently our family was thinking of going on a cruise, but I don't want to go bc our family trips always end up with arguments.

She always says that others are stupid bc they don't know ""common sense"", but also doesn't think that she can be stupid too. She uses MBTI as an excuse saying, she can't understand people bc she's a T. She makes comments saying my friends are stupid and she says she will never let go of her 6 yr+ grudge (an incident in middle school) that involved mainly me.

She recently got mad at me bc an aunt asked her how I was doing bc of my head concussion and my leave of school. She didn't like how that aunt was concerned for me. She also doesn't like when I follow her friends on Instagram, but follows my friends. She brought up that I need to be an adult and actually start paying for things, but I've been paying for my things and been saving. I have a drivers license and she doesn't. She says that I need to go outside and experience the real world, but again I'm in community college and she's living on campus. So our experience will be different.

I don't know what to do. I've been feeling more depressed and anxious around her (I have a history of depression and anxiety). Please help. I feel like she has narcissistic tendencies. I told my mom about this and she says that I shouldn't judge my sister and I need to be the more understanding one as the older twin. I feel like I'm going crazy.",2,1742065237.0,venting,4,1.0,False

I'd walk more, but my poor dog isn't really built for this. I've found myself envying friends who cycle and go anywhere between 10 and 60 miles on their bikes. In my jealousy I scoff at their posts of cakes and coffee at local caf√©s and the beautiful views they get to see.

I just don't know where to start. I'm decently muscled in the legs and core from of course walking and riding horses all my life, albeit out of practice these days, but how far is too far? What bike should I reasonably go for if I need a bit if everything? How do you even make cyclist friends? How do I avoid the inevitability of lycra?

1jc1wrc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1jc1wrc/my_story/,My Story,"God's really been looking out for my family and me, giving us so many second chances over the years. I just hope we don't waste them. Everything I've written about has happened to us, and no doubt there's even more that I can't remember. These amazing moments are listed in order, covering five decades from 1975 to 2025. I honestly believe that God takes care of us because I've felt it firsthand. Sure, a lot has happened to us, but when you think about it, fifty years is a long time in anyone's life or a family's journey.

When I was a teenager, my family had a swimming pool. One summer day in 1975, I was swimming alone and decided to dive in but dived a bit too deep for the pool‚Äôs depth. My chin hit the bottom with a loud click. It was scary to think my life could have ended right there, floating, or sinking in the pool, especially since I was alone. If I had been paralysed, I wouldn't have been able to get out.

Around the end of Year 10 in 1975, my parents arranged for me to transfer to a new school to study Music, since my current school didn't offer it in Years 11 and 12. Even though I was outside the catchment area, I got into the new school. It was a relief because I was bullied in junior high, but that stopped at the new school. I got to study Music and avoid the bullies. It felt like everything fell into place, even though I wasn't in the catchment area.

When I worked my butt off to get through Years 11 and 12, I scored high enough on my Higher School Certificate to get into Macquarie University, study History, and earn a Bachelor of Arts. Uni was a bit of a challenge at times, but I made it through and graduated.

I met Jackie at this Christian Youth Group called Young Life, and we started dating back in the winter of 1979. My mum, after just a couple of weeks, told me I should let Jackie know how I felt about her. So, one night a week later, I did just that. We went from being boyfriend and girlfriend to steady to engaged, all in one night, as I proposed to her. She said ""Yes,"" and I didn't even have a ring. I hadn't planned to propose that night; it just happened. I'd known Jackie for less than six weeks at the time. My mum encouraged me to follow my heart, not my head, 'cause Jackie had already captured my heart, and she still has it. Mums just know who's right for their kids.

When my mum showed me an ad for a government job, I had just finished uni and was about to get married in less than two months. I landed the job, and even asked for leave without pay for my honeymoon during the interview. I ended up staying in that job for over eighteen years, and everything worked out fine once I started working and took time off for my honeymoon.

We got married on December 5, 1981, and the very next day, we kicked off our honeymoon. As we headed to Forster, cruising north on the freeway from Hornsby, a woman in the lane next to us had a trailer. She flicked on her blinker and started merging into our lane, but we were in her blind spot. I tried to move over and slow down to give her room, but we were all moving at highway speeds, and she kept inching into my lane. I laid on the horn, and she finally noticed us just as I was about to hit the traffic safety barriers with a ditch on the side of the road. She quickly moved back into her lane. Talk about a wild start to married life!

When we were newlyweds renting a unit in West Ryde, we got hit with a bill we couldn't pay. But then, it was amazing, a cheque showed up in the mail the day after we got that bill. It was just a couple of dollars short of the bill, but enough to get it paid. We had no idea the cheque was coming, but it saved the day!

When we rented that unit, we asked if we could put a deadbolt on the door. The real estate agent agreed, if we gave them a set of keys and left the lock on the door when we moved out. A couple of months later, all the units in the block got burgled, except for ours and one other. Out of twelve units, ten got hit, but the two that didn't both had deadbolts. One of those was ours. The other units didn't have deadlocks, just the same easy-to-break-into locks.

When we had our first car, a green Holden HQ Kingswood sedan, someone stole it from the unit car park. Luckily, it was found later that day in Eastern Creek, though it was totalled. The police found the car without us having to wait months for the insurance company to decide about the payout if the car hadn't been found.

We were renting in West Ryde, and it was getting time to renew the lease or move out. We hadn't decided yet, but then my parents told us they were off on a four-month overseas holiday. So, the decision was made for us‚Äîthey asked us to housesit. We didn't have much furniture, and they had a big downstairs room we could stay in, with a toilet and shower next to it. They prepaid all their bills, so we didn't have any to worry about. We got a place to live rent-free while they were away and for a couple of months after they returned.

When we moved out of my parents' place, we rented a unit in Meadowbank for a year. During that time, and while living with my parents before, we saved up enough to put a deposit on another unit in Meadowbank. We paid off a small personal loan and bought the unit, leaving the rental market behind and stepping into homeownership with a mortgage.

After being married for six years, our parents started asking when we'd have kids. We hadn't really thought about it since we were busy with work, vacations, and often looking after my younger sibling, Chris. But then we decided to try for a baby. Surprisingly, after just six weeks, Jackie got pregnant, even after being on the pill for eight years, and carried Michelle to full term. Michelle was born with the help of forceps because she wasn't positioned correctly, but thanks to the doctor's skill, everything went smoothly.

Before Michelle was born, we realised how tough it would be to raise a baby in a top-floor unit without a laundry, especially since disposable nappies weren't a thing yet. So, we decided to sell the unit and buy a house. Wow, the unit sold the day we listed it, and we started house hunting. We found a house just in time and moved in before Michelle was born. It felt like there was planning that we found a buyer so quickly and a house at just the right moment, allowing us to move into our new home on the same day the unit sale was finalised.

When we were shopping at Blacktown Westpoint with Michelle, who was just a year old, we had a trolley, a pram, and a package to manage while getting out of the lift. We pushed the pram out first, and then Jackie and I went back in to grab the rest. Suddenly, the lift doors closed on us, and it started moving up, leaving Michelle alone in her pram on the floor we just left. We rushed back down after the lift stopped on another floor and found Michelle surrounded by a bunch of sweet elderly ladies, all wondering where her parents were. Thankfully, Michelle wasn't alone for long and was safe with the ladies keeping an eye on her.

Then there was this time I hit a semi-trailer. The car was totalled because the whole front, from both front doors to the bumper, was crushed. I lost control on a wet road and slid across three lanes, unintentionally aiming for a telegraph pole. Instead, we hit the truck, and the impact pushed us back into our original lane, sparing us from wrapping around the pole. The car was written off by insurance. I was fine, but Jackie got whiplash, which she recovered from, and our two-year-old Michelle ended up with a buckle imprint from her car seat on her stomach. The insurance company replaced her car seat, and she was okay.

Years after the accident, we had another child, Marcus. If we hadn't survived that crash, Marcus wouldn't be here today. It's amazing to think about how everything worked out, with the truck being there stopping us from a worse disaster, and now we have Marcus in our lives. When we were trying for that second kid, months went by, and we started losing hope, thinking it might never happen. We stopped actively trying, and then, surprise! Jackie got pregnant after we had given up. That's how we ended up with our second child.

When our youngest, Marcus, was three, Jackie was doing housework and was home alone with him. She suddenly heard a voice in the room telling her to check on Marcus. No one else was there, but she listened to the voice. She went outside and found Marcus on the road! She quickly brought him back inside, keeping him safe from any cars.

Another time, we were on holiday in Dubbo and visiting a big op shop. Our four-year-old, Marcus, wandered off like he usually does, but this time, he actually left the store without us knowing. My wife, daughter, and I searched for him inside but couldn't find him. We left the store and randomly turned left, not really knowing where he went. Luckily, we came across a couple, and the man was holding Marcus up in his arms. He told us he saw Marcus crossing the road alone and thought something was off since there were no parents around. So, he picked Marcus up and backtracked to find us. We were so relieved to be reunited with our son!

When we were on holiday, driving back from Melbourne to Sydney, our kids were young. We stopped at a roadside rest stop with a toilet. Our older kid, Michelle, wanted to go, so off she went by herself. To my horror, I realised it was a pit toilet. I told my wife, Jackie, to run after her. Jackie got there just in time and managed to save Michelle from falling into the pit below the toilet seat. Luckily, Michelle had left the door open, so Jackie could grab her before she disappeared into the pit. It was a narrow escape!

When we were super broke, all we could afford to eat were sausages and mashed potatoes for weeks. Jackie talked to some folks at the church we were attending and mentioned how hard things were financially. Someone, and we never found out who, put an envelope with our name on it in the offering tray. It had $100 in it, which was a big deal back in the nineties. One of the church elders gave us the envelope, and it came at a time when we were really struggling.

Later, we left that church because Marcus, our kid with special needs, was a bit too much for them. He was the only special needs child there and had some behavioural issues. We found another church where Marcus was accepted for who he is. Jackie and I even went through adult baptism there. It was a place where Marcus and we felt welcome and could acknowledge our faith.

My workplace offered a voluntary redundancy package, and I decided to take it. It turned out to be a great financial decision! We managed to pay off the mortgage and credit cards and even did some renovations. After that, I became a student and studied IT, web design, and networking. Then, I've launched my own website business, and it's just me running the show!

Back in mid-1999, after dealing with chest pain for what felt like forever, my wife finally convinced me to see a doctor. Turns out, my thyroid had gone rogue and was squishing everything in its path, including my windpipe and oesophagus. If it weren‚Äôt for my wife‚Äôs insistence, things could‚Äôve ended badly once my windpipe closed up. Surgery was a narrow escape, too; the doctor thought they might have to crack open my ribcage, to get at the thyroid from below as it was in my chest, but luckily, they managed to remove the thyroid through my neck, hiding the scar pretty well.

While waiting for the biopsy results at work, before the operation my wife Jackie called to say, ""There's no cancer."" At that moment, I swear I felt two hands on my shoulders, but when I turned around, no one was there. It was a surreal experience, feeling a touch when there wasn‚Äôt anyone there.

When I was on holiday with my family in Melbourne, we got lost and parked on the side of the road. Out of nowhere, a truck came over the hill and hit our car. Fortunately, the only damage was to the driver's mirror. It could've been way worse if the truck had been a bit closer. We were fortunate it wasn't a bad accident. During the same holiday, we took a bus while our car was getting the mirror fixed. We were having a tough time calming Marcus down, and this kind lady came over and prayed for us. It was just what we needed. She said God told her to pray for us, so she did.

When I saw a cat on TV twitching and moving around in its sleep, it was so active it actually fell off the coffee table it was lying on. The commentator said the cat had REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder, and I was like, ‚ÄúHey, that‚Äôs me!‚Äù I've been having dreams where I get super active and end up falling out of bed while still asleep. After this happened a few times, I decided to hit up the hospital and see a sleep specialist. They did a sleep study and, surprise, I got diagnosed with REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder. The sleep doc started talking about Parkinson‚Äôs Disease and my short-term memory issues, which was a bit of a wake-up call. You see, I had stumbled onto a TV program while channel surfing, and it made me connect the dots between my sleep habits and the cat's leading to my diagnosis.

Then there was this time when I had a nagging shoulder ache for ages, but I didn‚Äôt see a doctor 'cause, you know, I thought it‚Äôd just go away. Anyway, our church had a visiting healer for the first time, so I went up, sat in the chair, and didn‚Äôt even mention my shoulder. The healer didn‚Äôt ask either. They put some holy oil on my forehead, prayed over me, and laid hands on me. When I went back to my seat, I felt this burning hot circle right where my shoulder hurt. After a bit, the burning sensation faded, and I realised my shoulder pain was gone and never came back.

When my wife, Jackie, had a series of mini strokes which were TIA‚Äôs when she was 35, we already had two kids. The doctors said Jackie had to stop taking the pill immediately, and that I should get a vasectomy because a tubal ligation would be too risky for Jackie. Another pregnancy or childbirth could be life-threatening for her. So, I went ahead with the vasectomy, and we also went through counselling. The main thing was keeping Jackie safe and healthy. We made the right call with me getting the vasectomy. This way, Jackie is still with us, and I didn‚Äôt have to face raising our kids alone.

Jackie stumbled upon a job opportunity back in 2002 which was on the special needs school bus run with Marcus, and even though she wasn't actively looking, she embraced it wholeheartedly. She quickly became the caring presence in the back of the bus, looking after the kids. Jackie absolutely loves her role, and after working with several schools, she's finally found one where she's genuinely happy. Over the past 23 years, Jackie has been the dedicated carer on various school buses, and she has no plans of slowing down anytime soon!

When my eldest kid, Michelle, was getting bullied in high school, Jackie and I decided to pull her out of that school system. We reached out to another school, even though we weren't in their catchment area. They accepted her, and she settled in nicely. The bullying stopped, and she made some solid friendships. Later on, one of the bullies from her old school joined her new one, but by then, Michelle had a strong group of friends who stood up for her, and the bullying was quickly shut down.

When our church closed because it wasn't viable, we found a new one where we all felt at home. Marcus, who has special needs, was warmly welcomed there. The congregation had been hoping for someone like Marcus to join, and he fit right in with us. It was a perfect match for our whole family.

I often enter competitions to win, this one was for $1,000, and the community organisation I choose can win $10,000. I prayed about it and nominated our new church. I entered over thirty times and ended up winning the $1,000, while our church got the $10,000. The timing was perfect, especially during the Global Financial Crisis, and it was a huge help for both us and the church.

When Marcus was in Year 11, his high school tried to get him to sign out and leave for good, without coming back for Year 12. That would've been a bad move since the community program he was supposed to join was meant for folks who finished Year 12, not Year 11. Luckily, he found a spot at a special needs school for Year 12, which turned out to be his best school year ever. The new school was just right for him.

We renewed our wedding vows on our 30th anniversary in front of our church community. This time, unlike our wedding day, I got to kiss my wife, which I didn't get to do during our original ceremony. It was a beautiful way to show our commitment to each other by renewing such an important vow.

Once, Marcus and I got on a packed train, and I almost lost my grip on him while pulling him into the carriage. I could've left him behind. Thankfully, we stuck together because if Marcus had been left alone on the platform, I have no idea what might've happened.

During a crazy thunderstorm, when the wind and rain were coming down hard, the eucalyptus tree in our backyard next to the back fence toppled over and landed on our house. It was a total widow-maker. I was in the bathroom under the tree and stayed safe, and Marcus was in the kitchen, also safe. Most of the tree's weight was in the trunk, which landed in the backyard, but a bunch of branches ended up on the house, reaching all the way to the front main bedroom.

When I first noticed some weird symptoms, I had no clue what was going on. So, I went to see a neurologist. They told me I have Parkinson's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment. Now that I know what's up, I can get the help and treatment I need. My symptoms finally make sense, and the type of Mild Cognitive Impairment I have only messes with my short-term memory and some thinking skills, not my long-term memory. Getting diagnosed made me realise what the sleep specialist had talked about years ago actually came true‚ÄîI ended up with Parkinson‚Äôs Disease.

I was driving at 50 km/h when I went through an intersection with a stop sign, I didn't notice. I didn't realise it was an intersection until I heard another car honking like crazy. I should've stopped for them since they had the right of way. I glanced out my window and saw their car getting closer. We both swerved, but luckily, we didn't crash. I turned the wheel hard left, then right, to give us more space, and we missed both the car and a telegraph pole. The other driver stopped and talked to us, mentioning she had her mom and kid in the car. I had my wife and kid with me too. If we had collided, it could've been really bad for both families. But thankfully, we avoided it.

After that scare, I decided to stop driving once I got home. My neurologist and GP also told me to quit driving, and I know they're right. I've already stopped because I know I'm not safe on the road. I'm grateful we made the right call to stop. I‚Äôve come to terms with the fact that my driving days are over, and I‚Äôm okay with it.

When I finally got into the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) on my third try, it felt like the universe was telling me, ""Hang in there."" Now, I can finally get the support I need for my Parkinson's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment. It all happened at the perfect time, just when I was ready for it.

After being diagnosed with Parkinson‚Äôs and Mild Cognitive Impairment, my wife and I realised that as my condition worsened, it would be tough for her to take care of both me and Marcus, with his special needs. So, we decided to find Marcus a spot in a supported independent living share house. He loves it there, and it gives us peace of mind knowing he'll be taken care of both now and in the future.

I had a rough patch when I ended up in the hospital with Septic Shock from a nasty bacterial infection. It was from a bacterium called Proteus mirabilis, which I picked up from gardening. I got blood poisoning, ended up on life support, and was in a coma for three days. My heart was enlarged, my kidneys shut down, and I had a kidney stone blocking one of my ureters. Both my lungs got infected resulting in double pneumonia, and I was on dialysis. I was pretty out of it, with delirium that stuck around even after I woke up from the coma. I was contagious, so I spent ten days in isolation in the ICU. Visitors had to wear disposable gear to see me, and it all had to be tossed when they left.

After my time in the ICU, I was moved to the general ward. Made it through without losing any limbs to sepsis, which is a relief since many people with sepsis end up needing amputations. Sepsis can be deadly, with about five thousand people in Australia dying from it each year. I managed to shake off the delirium, though I still remember some of the wild thoughts I had during that time. My wife, was there every single day of those sixteen days I spent in the hospital, catching four buses daily just to be by my side.

Before they diagnosed me with blood poisoning and sepsis, I was in a lot of pain. I had gone to the hospital earlier that week, where they took some blood and managed to culture it. This meant they could pinpoint the exact bacteria causing the infection and treat it effectively without resorting to broad-spectrum drugs. They emphasised how crucial it was for me to return for treatment, and I was in surgery that very night.

During a routine skin cancer check, the specialist found a basal cell carcinoma on my nose that I hadn't noticed. Thankfully, he was able to remove it all. If left untreated, it could have led to more serious facial surgery and reconstruction. Luckily, I didn't need any complicated procedures since they caught it in time.

I went on a cruise with my dad, just the two of us, on the Majestic Princess from Sydney to Tasmania and back. We had a suite, and it was just before COVID-19 hit. Dad was still able to get around, even in his eighties, and we had such a wonderful time together. It was special to have that time with him before he passed away a couple of years later.

During the COVID era, when I visited him in the hospital, I was his only allowed visitor. On my way back to the train station, I rushed across a road even though the ‚ÄòDon't Walk‚Äô sign was flashing. I shouldn't have crossed, and I ended up falling right in front of a bus. I'm not sure if the driver saw me fall, but fortunately, I managed to get up and hobble away with just a hurt elbow and a shoe that had fallen off. Thankfully, the red arrow for the bus stayed red while I was on the crossing. If it had changed, the bus could've started moving over me. A woman on the other side of the road called out to make sure I was okay.

So, one day on another bus ride home, I was juggling two shopping bags in each hand. I couldn't hold onto the seat next to me or the hand straps from the ceiling because I didn't think to put the bags down, plus there wasn't really any space on the bus to do so. As the bus pulled away from the stop, I lost my balance and started falling toward a mom and her pram with two babies. I was in free fall and couldn't stop myself. Luckily, a person sitting behind me grabbed me by my belt and shoulder, pulling me upright just in time before I landed on the mom and her babies. I'm not exactly light since I'm on the heavier side, but they somehow found the strength and space to help me out. After that, someone offered me their seat, which was nice.

After my dad, Bruce, passed away, we had a funeral for him. Not long after, we went to clear out his unit since Mom had passed away a few years before. I discovered that Dad had kept a bunch of birthday, Christmas, and Father's Day cards we gave him as kids, tucked away in his bedside cabinet. I also started wearing his wedding ring from the day he passed. It was surprising to see how sentimental he was; I never expected him to be so sappy.

When Marcus, decided to leave his group home without telling the staff, he hopped on a bus from Baulkham Hills to Rouse Hill all by himself. We were on holiday in Hobart, and the police called us. After that, we used his Opal card to track his movements since Marcus knows how to tap on and off. Opal helped us figure out where he went, so we contacted the police and the house staff with the info. The police found him at Rouse Hill Shopping Centre, hearing him before seeing him because he was talking loudly to himself. They turned a corner, and there he was. Rouse Hill Shops is spread over a large area, not your typical mall. Marcus was safe and found by the police and staff.

A couple of years after my dad passed away, my wife, Jackie, accidentally stepped on an old answering machine we didn‚Äôt use anymore since we switched to NBN and don't need a home phone. It started playing a message from my late dad, recorded when he was alive. We didn‚Äôt know it was there. In the message, Dad tells me not to worry and that he loves me. I realised I was meant to hear it when I needed to, so I recorded it on my computer. Now, I can listen to Dad whenever I want, though it reminds me of how much I miss him and sometimes makes me emotional. It‚Äôs been four years since he passed, but I‚Äôm not deleting the recording because it‚Äôs a piece of him. It hurts knowing that after Mom died, none of us, not even my siblings or I, could keep him going. He just wanted to be with Mom and stopped eating. Now they‚Äôre together. I found the message when I needed it, and Dad‚Äôs words are helping me through the grieving process.

When Jackie passed out and went into a diabetic coma last Mother‚Äôs Day at Featherdale Wildlife Park, the 000 operator was super attentive. The first aid crew at Featherdale took care of Jackie while we waited for the ambulance. By the time the ambulance arrived, Jackie was out of the coma, but they took her to the hospital for observation and admitted her. After this scare, Jackie got serious about checking her sugar levels and managing her diabetes better. It was a real wake-up call for her.

A few weeks ago, a stray cat showed up at our doorstep without a collar or microchip. Jackie named him Max, and we've all fallen head over heels for him. It's been great having another cat to care for and share our home with, and Max has become a part of our family. He needs prayer though, for a good life as we‚Äôve found out he has Feline Aids. He didn‚Äôt ask for that. If anything, it makes me love him more. Fortunately, the Feline Aids cannot be transferred to humans, so we're safe if he scratches or bites us.

This year, I've started using support workers to help me get to medical appointments and join in on social activities. It's a big change for me since I used to spend most of my time at home alone. Now, I'm getting out more and meeting new people.

Through everything that's happened to me and my family, I've always felt that God has been there for us, both in the good times and the tough ones. We've felt protected in so many ways‚Äîmentally, spiritually, physically, emotionally, financially, and even on the road during dangerous times. It's like God's always been there, especially when things could've gone really wrong. I don't think it's just luck; it feels like it's all been part of a plan. I'm also incredibly grateful for my wife, Jackie, who's always been there for me and our kids. I truly thank God for bringing us together.

For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope. Jeremiah 29:11.

Be strong and courageous. Do not fear or be in dread of them, for it is the Lord your God who goes with you. He will not leave you or forsake you. Deuteronomy 31:6.

Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. Isaiah 41:10.

God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Psalm 46:1.

And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. Romans 8:28.

For you have been my help, and in the shadow of your wings I will sing for joy. Psalm 63:7.

Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. Psalm 23:4.

Bible readings are from the NIV.

We serve an Awesome God.

We have an Awesome God.

Give all the Glory to God.

1jc1wkk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bedbugs/comments/1jc1wkk/your_much_needed_success_story/,Your much needed success story,"Last year I moved into what I thought was a nice apartment building. It turns out, they‚Äôve had an on going bed bug infestation for years that they did not have to disclose.

For four months I received treatments, I went through literal hell. I had to take time off work to prep, spent money kennelling my cats for the day.

I found out that the exterminator couldn‚Äôt properly treat my couch. It was a $3000 sectional pull out, so I had to get it disposed of. The bugs didn‚Äôt get into my bed because I isolated it, and put traps under the legs.

For an additional five months I lived without a couch, sitting on the floor. I kept all of my clothes that were treated in garbage bags, the clothes that I wore I kept in large zip lock type bags, same with my shoes. The bugs were no longer infesting my unit but they would sometimes come in from neighbouring units. 

Finally, I was able to move. 

1.) I didn‚Äôt get rid of my bed, my rugs, or my dining table/ coffee table. There‚Äôs a lot of misinformation that gets spread on this sub that you must get rid of everything. The average person can‚Äôt afford that. Instead, I bought a steamer and heat treated these items the day before I moved.

2.) I didn‚Äôt have to get a new car, or even get my car treated. Like I said, I kept all of my clothes and shoes in ziplock bags.

3.) I didn‚Äôt get rid of my books either. I visually inspected them before packing them and didn‚Äôt find any bugs.

4.) I didn‚Äôt get rid of any of my electronics (tv, laptop, etc). In my humble opinion, unless your infestation is severe bb usually won‚Äôt go into these things. 

I‚Äôve been in my new apartment for almost two months now with no signs of bed bugs. My mental health is the best that it‚Äôs been in a year. Stay strong everyone

Description: This model allows me to grind coffee directly from my new Option-O LAGOM casa into a 58mm Profitec bottomless portafilter. It is held in place by a single magnet and is easily removable so you can grind into the standard catch cup.

*The design is specific to my portafilter, which has a straight handle and 2 tabs. I do not own other portafilters and cannot create or test other variants.*

I have tested the model with a 29mm tall Normcore dosing ring and a ~15mm tall watchget ring. With 18g of beans ground at a 0.6.5 setting, the grinds fall close to the center of the basket and do not overflow either ring. The static retention around the exit chute is low.

But your notebook stayed blank, your phone pressed to your ear instead. I lingered between shelves, the spine of a textbook resting on my palm, as your whisper cut through the silence:¬†*‚Äúi miss you‚Äù*¬†Three words, as clear as day. Your smile bloomed--soft, private, the kind that once curled toward¬†*me*¬†during midnight calls. Now it felt like a grenade had detonated in my chest, my heart in pieces.

I followed you to the bakery downtown, the one with the chalkboard sign that read¬†*‚ÄúLove at First Bite.‚Äù*¬†You walked out with two coffees, steam curling into the air. This time, I stepped into your path.¬†

*""who were you drinking with?‚Äù*¬†

Your laugh was too quick, your hand rising to tuck a strand of hair behind your ear.¬†

*‚ÄúJust a friend from class,‚Äù*¬†you said, voice brittle.

Later, after you‚Äôd left, I dug through the trash bin outside. Two empty cups. Only one stained with lipstick‚Äîyour signature crimson. The other was clean, pristine, as if whoever drank from it hadn‚Äôt left a trace. Or didn‚Äôt need to.

I gave all of me to you. Every heartbeat, every breath I held. Is this the ramification of love? To be the lighthouse you sail past, anchored in the dark while you chase brighter shores?

Maybe.

But tonight, as I delete your number, I wonder if silence is the only language you‚Äôll ever understand. Still, some part of me wants to believe that if I keep coming back, one day you‚Äôll wake up and beg for me to stay.

I have propanolol and although great, I can still have panic in my head without an elevated heart rate (40mg up to 2x a day). I have been on sertraline 10 years ago for depression (have been off them for 8 years and have felt extremely happy in life) however they caused severe emotional blunting at the time, to the point I just wasn't excited for anything. What's people experience with SSRIs for panic attacks? Did it actually help? Has people found certain ones better for emotional blunting than others? After a solid year of panic attacks  I'm ready to give it a go.

To note, my panic has got so so much better. I've done therapy, CBT, work meetings and presentations for exposure, propanolol etc but it's still there and my job is only going to involve needing to do these things more as time goes on. It's to the point when I know my turn is coming up to talk in a meeting, my heart goes from resting 45bpm (very active) to 150 and I'm so close to running out. When I take propanolol it's just the mind symptoms but still extremely debilitating. I'll say what I have to say bluntly in a few words so the meeting moves on because I'm so scared of people seeing a panic attack (this has happened before) despite knowing people understand and nothing bad can happen. I think I've done everything I can now, in a much better place, and just need to positively condition this last remaining panic in me.

I have never seen such constant pariah of violence on any sub in the history of Reddit since the realization that people take out their pent up anger by declaring every Tesla owner a Nazi. At this point I‚Äôm surprised there hasn‚Äôt been a Kristallnacht for Tesla owners.

This level of open unhinged declaration of violence and open season against people who haven‚Äôt done anything to you is disturbing beyond belief. I expected so much more from the city I went to college in.

Throwaway account, please bear with me.

A month before my 18th birthday, my dad told me I needed to move out ASAP. His girlfriend at the time, who later became his wife, said she wanted to turn my room into a reading space for her daughter. Her daughter, who was 15 back then, already had her own room but wanted a quiet place to read. I begged my dad to let me stay and even offered to pay rent to him and his girlfriend, but he said she had made up her mind. He told me it was time to grow up and learn how to be an adult.

I vented to my supervisor at work, telling him how this would ruin my future plans. He was 33 at the time and offered to let me move in with him. I told him it was a really kind offer, but I doubted I could afford rent for such a nice apartment. He said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about the rent. Instead, you can take care of housekeeping and stuff.‚Äù I was so relieved that I hugged him and promised I wouldn‚Äôt disappoint him.

Eventually, we developed feelings and started dating. I was going to university part time, working, and handling housework. Things were going fine until I found out I was pregnant at 21. His reaction crushed me. He said I was irresponsible and dumb, asking, ‚ÄúHow could you be so stupid and let this happen?‚Äù When I mentioned abortion, he got angry and said, ‚ÄúIf you do that, I‚Äôll kick you out on the street just like your dad did. That‚Äôs not an option. You better be ready, because this falls under the housekeeping agreement.‚Äù

I was completely dependent on him, so I promised I wouldn‚Äôt let him down. I ended up dropping out of university when I was six months pregnant, though I kept working. Later, he seemed to come around and even showed excitement about the baby. But after our daughter was born, things changed. I wasn‚Äôt the same, and I needed help. That‚Äôs when he became abusive.

I‚Äôll never forget the time he hit me hard in the face while I was breastfeeding because I forgot to make his morning coffee. He kept saying that since he worked all day, I wasn‚Äôt pulling my weight and was using the baby as an excuse to be lazy. I was getting hit over the smallest things.

Eventually, when our daughter was two, he got another woman pregnant. Just like my dad, he kicked me and my daughter out.

I ended up moving in with my maternal grandma, the only one who took me in. My daughter is six now. I‚Äôve finished my degree and have a great job. We are very happy.

Recently, my dad reached out to my grandma about reconciling. Apparently, he‚Äôs divorced now. His wife left him after he was diagnosed with Parkinson‚Äôs disease. My grandma supports whatever I decide but thinks I should at least talk to him.

I would always play outside by myself, I would always hang out by myself, watch movies and daydream. It was like that until I started primary school, then something changed. Or so I thought. I met people I could call close friends. We even lived in the same apartment building, so I didn't feel alone anymore. but there will be always a separate grouping in friend groups.I did not continue my communication with anyone after finishing primary school. It was kind of the same in middle school, but this time someone I could call my closest friend came into my life. We laughed together, stayed up all night, went to each other's houses, and even bought flowers for her mother. We would tell each other all our problems and look for solutions together, we studied together, we took exams together, everything suddenly made him feel like it would be like this forever. Other than  her I had friends again, but when I finished middle school I didn't keep in touch with almost any of them, and I had already argue with someone even before prom night. but I kept in touch with her. We told each other about our days, talked and met outside. I thought it would continue like this in the first year of high school. We went to different high schools. She went somewhere close to her house. I had the opportunity to get into a good high school. I felt like I made friends in high school, but we only talked at that school, none of them would come to me afterwards, they wouldn't text me, they wouldn't say anything. Sometimes they would ask for notes and nothing else. They would meet at each other's houses, they wouldn't invite me because I had a group of friends, but there was still grouping. They played games together and when they talked about different topics, they said they wanted to talk privately and that they didn't want me to be with them. While I was happy that I still had my friend from middle school,her circle of friends expanded.When I call her she start to say  ƒ± am busy or ƒ± have a headache. I didn't mind but I saw on the internet that she always hung out with her friends, she was closer to them, she spent more time with them, I felt like she loved them more. When I tried to talk to her about this she said I was talking nonsense. I got angry we argue she said to me we have been through a lot but she don't feel close to me anymore. i cried day and night. I had also lost the only person who asked me how I was doing. I felt an emptiness and started to distance myself from people. Every time I formed a bond I thought i would hurt like this again. Now I'm alone, I don't have a friend I can go out with. No one calls me or asks about me. I chat and talk to the people I went to at school, but none of them are my friends, I just know people. Even now whenever I start talking to someone they stop talking to me so I started to cut off communication. I drink my coffee alone. I sit alone in the cafe. I have no one to talk to. There is no one to listen to me. I don't know if my life will continue like this forever. I don't know anything.
