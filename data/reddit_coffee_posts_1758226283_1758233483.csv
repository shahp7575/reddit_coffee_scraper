1nklzhv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1nklzhv/possible_longterm_side_effects_of_dangerously/,Possible long-term side effects of (dangerously) coming off ofna large dose of Venlafaxine?,"**Personal Information:** 36F, combination ADHD diagnosis that is medicated. History of severe depression, and anxiety that are ever-present but managed. Depersonalization and derealization symptoms not officially attached to any diagnosis. I do not smoke, do any recreational drugs besides caffeine via coffee, and maybe have one drink once every few months. Major liver surgery in 2023, but have been monitored and no known lasting side effects other than a few months of anemia during recovery


**Background:** In addition to what is listed above, I was taking lamotrigine and venlaxine for around 10 years. Those medications were for a diagnosis of Bipolar II which turned out to be incorrect. I was told that it was no longer appropriate for me to have that diagnosis, and it was removed from my chart. However, doctors never discussed changing my medications even after the fact...probably because it would be miserable even done responsibly.

Unfortunately, multiple compounding events happened all at once at the beginning of this year. It led me to ""taper"" and stop my venlafaxine by myself over the course of maybe...2, 2.5 months. I had been on a daily dose of 225 mg of venlafaxine, for about 10 years. 

It was dangerous, I was miserable the entire time, and if it had not been an issue of ""I dont have health insurance or enough money for out of pocket, and I cannot see another doctor anyways for three months"" I never would have done it. I also had to wean off of 100 mg lamotrigine, but I am assuming that the venlafaxine is the big scary of the two. I last took those two meds in late March?

I know that it's possible that some of the mental health/physical issues I have in the following months may be related to doing this. Then again, a lot of it could be explained by my other stuff.

Again unfortunately, my current medical care is coming from a neighborhood clinic and a general NP. When I brought up something as simple as ""hey I think I'm not feeling an effect from my ADHD meds,"" her response was ""well what do you want me to do?""

She is very kind, but she is overworked, and not an MD/DO level specialist. I'm aware my dosage + how quickly I came off is unusual (because it was BAD), and it wouldn't be fair or productive for me to expect her to deal with this.


**Question:** Is there a good resource for patient education on possible long-term effects of coming off of antidepressants like venlafaxine? I know there is actual scientifically-backed discussion about this, but I also know the internet also has a Degobah-scale swamp of anti-psychiatry, anti-medication disinformation rabbit holes out there. 

 I would really appreciate some vetted patient education resources on the topic, if anyone knows of some! 

Thank you in advance.

1nklyum,https://www.reddit.com/r/MTHFR/comments/1nklyum/concerta_adhd_med_mthfr_c677t_gene_variant/,"Concerta ADHD Med, MTHFR C677t gene variant.","
Hello, I have gotten tested recently and found that genetically, I am compatible with Concerta, like it has no negative interactions. It did work the best when I tried it, however I have some concerns related to the MTHFR gene. The issue being, I do not understand how they interact with one another. Like, the Concerta and the issues with folic acid conversion. I specifically was shown to be heterozygous for C677t gene variant for MTHFR. This means I have a reduced folic acid conversion rate by around 30% compared to normal people. But I’m not sure what this exactly means for how I should go about taking medication. 

I think I should let readers know that when I take my Concerta medication, it doesn’t totally fix my ADHD issue. Usually when I pair Concerta with a cigarette or a coffee it works the best because of increased acetylcholine+ dopamine+ norepinephrine levels. But, the issue still after is that if I take one Concerta pill, each day, for three or four days in a row, it begins to have an effect like I took too much of it or like it “builds up” in my system over time and isn’t being properly flushed out before I go into a depressive period, where it resets. Is it possible that issues caused by MTHFR are causing a chain reaction where my medication is only working for about half the time it should? 

There’s more too. I’m still not sure if my issue with the medication is caused by the gene, or reduced serotonin issues. I never paired my ADHD meds with a serotonin-related  drugs except for last year, but it was not an experience I want to relive, not necessarily because it’s a bad pairing, but because it was a bad place at a bad time that I decided to take both. Anyway, I have read that decreased effectiveness of the drug over the course of a few days could be caused by your bodies need to maintain homestasis between serotonin and dopamine/ norepinephrine. That’s to say, that as the former lowers, the latter tend to rise(and Vice versa) which cause anxiety, other issues I deal with when I take the meds multiple days in a row. I tend to have naturally low serotonin levels because of my life situation(stressful environment) + MTHFR gene mutation. Hence, is it possible that me becoming anxious, sleepy, depressed after a few days on Concerta could just be the result of my heightened dopamine/norepinephrine levels rising then evening themselves out with my serotonin levels, so I just end up doing nothing for the days where I’m “reseting” and this is the time that my serotonin is reseting? 

Am I overthinking these test results? What do you guys make of my situation, please take the time to read through what I said, and give me a plausible explanation for why I can’t just take my meds everyday and not deal with issues of needing a break so often, maybe this is my limit, but I want to understand what is happening. Is it the folic acid conversion that’s causing this reaction, is it that my body is just rejecting the artificial dopamine? 

If anyone else has this with medication and got it figured out, are heterozygous with C677t MTHFR gene variant and manage, or something else, please let me know. ",1,1758233359.0,MTHFR,0,1.0,False

Did a telehealth consult and got prescribed Nitrofurantoin for 5 days (10 pills). I also got some Walgreen generic cranberry pills. 
This past Saturday, my symptoms of urgency and frequency peeing came back. Monday morning I went to my primary, she tested my urine and there is still a culture and wrote me a script for Cipro for 10 days, and to take Azo defense as well. She said if I’m feeling better by day 5 I can stop taking the Cipro. 
I’m on day 4 of taking Cipro, and I’m having a lot of anxiety because my frequency still hasn’t resolved. It’s not as bad as it was Saturday, I’m just stressing out because I’m going on my first cruise on 9/27 for a week and I don’t want to worry about having to go to the bathroom every half hour. 
My current plan is to call my doctor’s office this coming Monday if I’m still having symptoms. 

I’ve also stopped drinking coffee and soda this past week, I have had a few sweet treats here and there I will admit. I read online that not eating dairy can help so I did that starting today (9/18).  

Does anyone have a suggestions? I know this sub has a love/hate relationship with Cipro. ",1,1758233338.0,utis,0,1.0,False

1nkly7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/neurodiversity/comments/1nkly7c/does_someone_with_adhd_and_aspergers_struggle/,Does someone with ADHD and Asperger's struggle with attention in college? I need advice,"Hello everyone. I'm Miguel, I'm 17 years old and I study electrical engineering. I was diagnosed with ADHD (inattentive type) and autism spectrum disorder level 1 (Asperger's) at age 14. Lately, or rather all my life, I have had a hard time paying attention in class because I feel a physical need for constant stimuli (like using my cell phone, watching TikTok or writing, anything that gives me stimulation, I can't stay without doing anything, I feel super uncomfortable and it makes me feel generally unwell.). If I don't, I become incredibly anxious and unable to concentrate.

I was the best of my generation in school, I entered the most difficult university in my country by pure luck, since I never studied because it was impossible for me, now if I continue with this lifestyle I may not have been able to continue with my career or my life.

What I have tried:

· Take notes in class, but I still get distracted.
· Use breathing techniques, but they don't work for me.
· Schedule short breaks, but it is difficult for me to regain concentration.
- Try listening to music at specific Hz to concentrate.
- Drink little coffee because it seemed to help.
- Make concept maps

My question for you:

· How do they manage the need for stimuli in demanding environments?
· Are there strategies that have helped you in college?
· Has anyone found ways to channel that need for movement or stimulation without affecting their productivity?
- Any tips for studying or managing anxiety - worry about random things in life?
- Any study method to literally study?

I appreciate any advice as I feel like this is affecting my academic performance and my life. Thanks for reading me!",1,1758233313.0,neurodiversity,0,1.0,False

I’ve gone back and forth with wanting it done for years (I’m a masc lesbian she/her) but scheduled my consult last November, had it in April and surgery is coming up quickly.

Although I dislike my chest (it’s not big, but I want to be flat) I’m starting to get cold feet about surgery. I tore my ACL last year and had surgery on it in August 2024. The recovery was brutal not only physically (learning to walk again and a year before being cleared for sports) but mentally. 

I’m a very independent person and my ACL recovery put me in such a dark place mentally that I spiraled for months after, gained a bunch of weight and let my drinking get out of control. I’m finally back in a place in my life where I’ve lost the weight, in a great routine with an awesome job, but mentally struggling with the aspect of being back in recovery mode again and what that looks like for me. 

I have friends who’ve had surgery and went out to grab coffee with their drains still in two days later and taking walks, I have others who were physically drained and bedridden for weeks. 

I don’t really have a caretaker as my partner works weekdays and is gone from 7-7. She’s going to be taking off my surgery date and the day after to pick me up (my surgeon is making me stay over night which seems to be out of the norm and I’m unhappy about that). If anyone has any positive recovery stories or advice I could really use it. I don’t want to cancel my surgery but I don’t know if I’ll be able to handle the recovery :(

1nklx60,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Fiction_Bureau/comments/1nklx60/spoke_and_wheel_precision_arrangements/,Spoke and Wheel - Precision Arrangements,"I set fitfully that night. I had decided to write off the note I found as a leftover from the previous owner. But, Bloom County next to a Thomas Harris novel? I was careful to group books of the same genre when I arranged the shelving.  Or had I? Every other book seemed to be resting quietly with good behavior where I had left them, save two.  
There are several comedic characters in Bloom County. However, in a Thomas Harris novel, there’s only one character for practical purposes: Dr. Hannibal Lecter, the cannibal psychiatrist. Hardly a comedic protagonist.  In fact, one of literature’s most fantastic monsters.  
I climbed out of bed, stiff as always, and walked into the bathroom to take a shower, brushing off the idea that my books were moving on their own or worse yet, having someone or some force move them intentionally.  
After my shower finished, I quickly dressed while managing my craving for a cup of coffee.  Surely a nice cup would clear the cobwebs and restore some degree of sanity to my life.  
My shoes were on and I walked with a new pep in my step to the kitchen, passing the living room and my odd bookcase.  What I saw next made me cold with fear, and I forgot about coffee, breakfast, or the schedule for the rest of the day.  My heart started beating audibly, and I was horrified to have a flashback to my reading of Edgar Allan Poe and The Tell-Tale Heart.  Why was THAT the first thing I thought? I waved it off as much as I could and looked at what I saw, trying to wrap my head around it.  
My collection of Steinbeck works had been removed from the bookshelf. Yes, they were no longer on the shelf where I had so carefully placed them.  The shelf itself was empty.  It took me a moment to realize this as I turned my head to stare, mouth agape at the empty shelf.  
I turned back to the books themselves, and I will describe what I saw.  
The novels were arranged like the spokes of a wheel on my tile floor, just 5’ away from the bookshelf that was their original home. Tortilla Flat was next to Cannery Row, which was next to The Grapes of Wrath, next to In Dubious Battle, next to The Moon is Down.  They were all there, formed in a circular pattern. What’s more disturbing is that each had been arranged with precision. My eye could not tell if there was a difference between the angle or the spacing.  It was that precise.  Each book had its spine at what appeared to be the same angle. I lost my ability to use my vocabulary, so I’ll call it unsettling. I inched forward, this time a little afraid of my beloved books.  Possessed?  Maybe. Was I? Maybe. Did I make an involuntary moan?  Yep! My breath was shallow, and I could still hear my heart thumping along (Poe!!!) in a rhythm of its own. My feet moved on their own without approval from the head office, and I came closer to the spiral of books.  
Oh god. In the middle, like some Quarterback of literature, lying proudly on the floor (with precision) was East of Eden. The books had been arranged carefully to surround, or pay tribute to, East of Eden.  Why? Who had done this?  WHAT had done this? Why? How about another “why?” since I have no words right now.  
My heart thumped; my feet, my adversary, had been firmly onboard with my reluctance just a few moments ago, but now they were encased in cement.  The pit of my stomach was up to no good because I could feel movement. I stood horrified, yet a little impressed with the precision of the work. This wasn’t hasty. It was calculated and deliberate. I took a moment, and while I didn’t move, I ran my eyes over the arrangement.  Looking at each book individually. I didn’t get what I had hoped to see, but it gave me some relief that they were not moving and were behaving as books should behave. Just 5 minutes ago, I had an entirely skewed vision of books and their purpose. I carefully slid to my right, making sure that I was out of the reach of the circle of books.  Out of reach?  Where and why had that come into my mind as I glided over the floor?  They’re books.  I am not in the living room of my home, gazing at a den of rattlesnakes. These were books. I think they were books. At this point, I was less than confident about my use of words.  For now, let’s agree to call them books until proved otherwise. With the soft rustle of my pants against the couch, I stopped my counterclockwise movement.  It was at that point that I should have marshalled my resources and made a break for the door. My heart was beating so loud that I feared an explosion in my chest. My breath is as shallow as it gets.  My stomach was a carnival ride.  I could feel the heat rising in my face. My slow glide to the left revealed another horror. From my cautious vantage point, I could see the top edge of East of Eden, which now looked to be the Commanding Officer of the rest of the Steinbecks.  The topic of the book is never really that interesting.  It doesn’t get interesting or compelling until you break open the pages and begin a journey.  This time, however, the journey started without needing to do anything.  What I saw marked the beginning of a journey, a nightmare, and another mystery.  
Peeking at me from the top of East of Eden was a piece of paper that had been tucked between the pages. It seemed to look back at me arrogantly as it waited.  Once I could focus my eyes, my body nearly merged all of the heart thumping, shallow breathing, and nauseous stomach in one movement of panic, vomit, and loss of consciousness. The paper had writing on it. It was a note.",1,1758233239.0,The_Fiction_Bureau,0,1.0,False

I live abroad and I’ve got 2 very close friends that I met when I first moved here 7 yrs ago (we are all from the same country). They are a lesbian couple who recently had a baby (now 13 months old) through IVF. They are over the moon and I truly couldn’t be happier for them.

A few months ago it was mentioned that my friend’s sister wanted to come over, and with her sister being a fellow hairdresser she offered to cut my hair and in exchange I’d do hers. I was happy to do this so it was decided we would go down to visit the sister and her family at the beach town they were staying at (2.5 hrs down the coast from us) for a couple of nights. So there would be me, my 2 friends, their baby, the sister, her husband and their kids 11 and 14.

Me and my  2 friends and their baby got a triple room hotel for the 2 nights and agreed to split it three ways, I paid my share and the next month told them I was only going to stay for one night so not to intrude on their family time but I was still happy to pay my share for the 2 nights.

A few days before we go my friend asks me to  bring down additional hair supplies as her sister now wants a full head of colour as well as a cut during the trip.

The day before we go, I’m on the phone to my friend and she says “by the time we get down there the baby will be tired so you won’t mind staying in and chilling with her”  while they go out for a meal and drinks with the sister’s family. I’m happy to look after the baby and let them have family time but I didn’t like the way she just assumed I wouldn’t want to go out at all, even for a bite to eat on my only night there. I stay in and look after the baby and they wake me up when they come back drunk at 3am.

I didn’t mind waking up and having a chat with them but the next morning they get me up at 7:45am to go for breakfast with the baby. Prior to heading over to the sisters hotel my friend tells me about a wristband we can get over there that has all inclusive food and drink all day and night. They knew I was going to be up doing hair most of the day then heading to get the coach in the afternoon, she I said it wouldn’t be worth it and I’ll just pay as I go.

I had to pop to the pharmacy quickly so they went ahead and when I caught up with them they had got me a wristband anyway. They said they did so because they were offered 20% off. So I had to pay for a wristband I didn’t want or need.

We go to the pool and before I head up to do the sister’s cut and colour they had to put the baby down for a nap. The sister’s husband was up in bed hungover, one of my friends was playing a snooker tournament and the sister needed to show my other friend where the room was with the baby.

So I’m stuck for about 30 mins babysitting the sister’s two kids that I’d never met before in a pool. When my friend returns, I go up and do her sister’s hair for a few hours and she also gives me a haircut. I only charged her a small amount to cover the cost of the colour. Once the hair is done I go grab some food (which was miserable) and a coffee from the buffet and 30 mins after that I go to get the coach back.

So I was only there 22 hrs in total, did a 5 hour round trip, the whole thing cost me 200 euros, I got a very mediocre haircut (my initial reason for going), and I was basically a free babysitter the whole time. AIBU for feeling used?",3,1758233168.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

I'm not experiencing any of the warning symptoms yet (no blood, no hard stomach, I am ""bloated"" as in my stomach is bigger than usual, but thats probably just.. you know, and I am able to pass gas) BUT I have taken two laxatives (one yesterday, and 24hs after that one a second one today, which hasn't hit the time to work yet, and because tomorrow is friday, I'm unsure if I should go to a doctor or not.
Since 2 days I've upped my fibre intake, eating only soft foods like plums and tried black coffee bc that usually does the job. My bf massaged my stomach in the way ur supposed to and it did help (..lets just say I managed to go the tiiiniest bit) but obviously that didnt solve the issue, tho it proved that theres nothing actually blocking it up. Do I need to go to the doctor tomorrow or could I get something stronger from the pharmacy and wait out the weekend? 🫡

I was in pain on day 3, but I had eaten a shitton of bread over the last few days and I am utterly dehydrated (I drink max. 1,5l a day) and now after drinking a lot my stomach is bubbling so I'm HOPING that this is why this happend! Will make sure to drink more 😭

1nklqpe,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nklqpe/the_man/,The Man,"The obnoxious sound of Jack’s alarm clock jolted him awake. Slow and sluggish in an attempt to roll himself out of bed, he noticed from his bedroom window that it was raining. A sense of subtle joy overtook him, for he loved the rain.

He couldn’t come to a conclusion for the love of rain, but he felt it on days like this. Jack made his way downstairs to grab a cup of coffee and see his parents, who had left for their week’s vacation to Sicily, Italy. “Oh, yeah,” he thought to himself, forgetting they left around 5 a.m. for their 8 a.m. flight this morning. Jack didn’t work and had no obligations in the home for the most part. 

He was a good and respectful kid, though he had no sort of inclination to work. Entertainment and indulging in hedonistic pleasures was almost a daily routine for him since graduating high school. The priorities he would have after leaving his parents’ home—finding his passions and the question of what career path he would venture into—were too daunting to answer. He was way too comfortable. Mind you, that was the fault of his parents.

Jack was in the kitchen grabbing the coffee his parents made earlier in the morning. He proceeded and started making toast, poured himself a heaping bowl of Apple Jacks, and made his way into his room to play some games on his Xbox. The type of games he enjoyed were first-person shooters like Call of Duty, along with a few cups of coffee just to get himself awake. Jack aspired to be a skilled gaming personality since streaming was now so prevalent. The success of many YouTube creators and gamers Jack grew up watching motivated that vision he had for himself. The rain began to pour down harder, with echoes of thunder nearby. In the midst of his gaming, Jack noticed he felt a sense of comfort. 

Besides the coziness he felt on days like this, the rain also gave him a sense of relief from his complacency, knowing others were inside as well due to the stormy weather. “Most people are probably having some sort of leisure time as well,” he thought.

As Jack continued playing his games and eating what was left of his cereal, he was interrupted by a few knocks at the front door. He ignored it at first, not wanting to answer to some salesman or neighbor, so he continue with his leisurely morning in peace. He knew it was wrong, but his laziness overtook him frequently. He heard more knocks again, just as the first. Out of annoyance, he removed his headset and tossed it onto his bed, got up from his chair, and made his way downstairs to answer the door. It was a FedEx driver with a package who requested a signature of approval. It was for his father, whose name was Richard Campbell. Jack made a lousy attempt at his signature on the driver’s tablet; the man thanked him, nodded, and was off.

Jack peered to the right over at his friend Stephen’s house to see if he was home, since he hadn’t texted him to play games yet. There were no cars in his driveway nor on the street in front of his home. Jack acknowledged he must be at his community college classes today. He decided not to text him until evening to join him to play Call of Duty. Outside was murky, and it was still raining considerably hard. Jack closed the door and went back inside.

After setting the box down, he saw his car keys on the counter, reminding him he should grab a snack for later, knowing he would want something while gaming with Stephen. He pondered where to go as he quickly threw on shoes and a coat, left, and walked to his old 1999 Honda Civic parked in the driveway. The rain settled a bit, but was still more than a light drizzle. Jack lived in the suburbs of Huntington Beach, California, in a safe neighborhood, home to many middle-class families and a select few of the wealthy. His parents did quite well for themselves, so you could say Jack’s family lived modestly. Jack started driving to his local 7-Eleven a few minutes away, where he went roughly every other day. He knew the clerk since childhood, but the man strangely never said a word; as he recollected the thought, he smiled at the realization.

He approached the driveway entrance, and it was packed even in the rain, yet it was close to lunchtime, so he parked several spots from the store that were available. Mildly annoyed, he got out to walk inside and noticed a peculiar man—not homeless-looking, but rummaging through the trash, clearly looking for something. He was roughly six feet tall, wore a large jacket, denim pants, and a strange hat that was almost fitting for the outfit. Jack walked up and hesitated, seeing the man was partially blocking the door. He tried circumnavigating his way around him to go inside without notice. Then the man peered right, noticing Jack, and said,
“Sir, sir, have you seen a knife anywhere? You know, one that flips out and it’s about this big,” gesturing oddly with his hands.
“No, I haven’t. I just got here,” Jack replied, confused.

The man replied back, “Oh…” and proceeded to look. Jack opened the door, and before closing it, the man said a bit louder, “You sure?” He had a pocket knife in his hand, as he’d described a second ago, and said, “It was in my coat pocket on my right side the whole time.”

“I never checked it!” he yelled out, followed by some uncanny laughs, hardly breaking eye contact with Jack.

“Glad you found it,” Jack said nervously. He closed the door quickly, considering telling the clerk to call the police. The clerk was in the corner near the back door, texting—unaware of anything that had just happened at the front with the man. Jack looked back at the man; he was walking off, so Jack decided to get his things quickly, check out, and go home. In a haste, and while taking constant glances at the front entrance and glass windows for the man, Jack grabbed a bag of BBQ Ruffles chips, a Hundred Grand chocolate bar, and an original Red Bull in the span of ten seconds. He went to pay and considered telling the clerk about the man and the interaction, but didn’t, due to being in a hurry to leave. He bought his things and said, “Have a good one.”

The clerk didn’t say anything except for a nod of acknowledgement. Jack noticed the man was not to be seen as he walked out from the store, but as he walked a few steps he spotted him sitting in a black Jeep Cherokee a few spots from him. He walked speedily to his car to leave, and suddenly the man, a few paces away, noticed him again, calling out, “Hey, kid!”
“Thanks for the help anyway. Who knows what I would’ve done tonight. I don’t have much money. I’m pretty forgetful, wouldn’t you say?” he added, now looking at Jack with that strange look as before, except this time almost grinning and not breaking eye contact again.

Jack didn’t respond; he just needed to get into the car. He didn’t know what that was and didn’t care to find out by entertaining that conversation. He started to pull out, trying his best to avoid looking at the man still parked. He left and, while driving, felt an acute sense of paranoia that the man might be following him, not knowing what to expect at this point. As he started driving, the rain began to pick up again, setting the mood for something unsettling like this—coincidentally. He persisted, peering into his rearview window the entire way back home. Jack was having a hard time shaking the image of the man’s grin and creepy interaction they had.

What felt like an eternity, Jack was finally arrived back to the house. Getting out of the car, he made his way to the front door, then immediately stopped and felt the need to put his car in the garage. He just didn’t want to be noticed, even though he felt his precautions of being seen were a bit dramatic. He got back in the car and pulled into the garage.
“I’m an idiot,” he thought, going through scenarios in his head and concluding it could’ve just been a strange man looking for his knife who was too talkative. “I don’t know, man—the way he looked at me was almost menacing, but regardless, that was sketchy,” he thought, almost finding room for humor in the situation. 

He felt relieved to be home at least and clicked the button to close the garage. Just as the garage was closing, he saw a black car drive by and made a momentary flash of eye contact with a man driving, wearing a hat, who gazed inside at him as the garage door was creeping down about a quarter of the way. The garage made its way shut.

Jack couldn’t tell with certainty if it was the man from earlier, but seeing a black car and the man inside appearing to wear a hat made his stomach sink and his body tense up with fear. His heartbeat raced for a brief moment at the eerie thought of the man passing by. Consequently, his mind started to piece together a bunch of reasons not to be worried. Thinking the man from earlier knew where he lived became the only thing he could think about. “What if he pulled back around and he’s in front of the house looking for me?” he thought. He frantically locked the garage door and took his bag of snacks up to his room, where he sat for a while, listening to the rain and looking out his bedroom window for anybody that could be at the house. There was nobody to be seen except for a few passing cars and the empty neighborhood.

Jack didn’t want to scare his parents by telling them what happened while they were so far away in Italy, so he texted Stephen and explained the situation. Thirty minutes went by with no response. Hours went by, and Jack never left his window in fear of the man coming. He decided to get back on his games without his headset in order to hear anything going on outside that would raise any alarm in him. Stephen finally texted back just as Jack hopped into his first match of a different game called Fortnite. He felt partially relieved looking at Stephen’s text saying, “That’s creepy, man. I don’t think he’s out to get you though haha. Wanna hop on some games in a while?” “I’ll be home in a couple of hours.”

Jack knew Stephen couldn’t have known the severity of the situation, having not experienced it. “How could he not be creeped out and paranoid if he were in my shoes right now?” he thought. He would, Jack concluded, and the same worries came back and began to persist. A couple worried hours later he hopped on the games with Stephen around 7 p.m. Stephen had a long day of school and had gone out to dinner with some girl he recently met. As they were both playing Fortnite, Stephen asked, “Anything else happen since we talked?”

“Not really,” Jack replied. “I just keep thinking about it, but honestly I think I was tripping myself out thinking about it too much, if you know what I mean.”
“Yeah, I’m glad you answered my call and the guy didn’t get you,” Stephen replied jokingly.
Jack laughed and said, “No, for real—you should’ve seen me. I ran up to my room looking out the window for hours, thinking the dude was after me or something. Call me a lunatic or whatever, but in the moment I was ready to fight this guy if he pulled up to the house.”
“No, you wouldn’t,” Stephen said, laughing. “You’d be under your bed texting 911, let’s be real.”

“Nahhhh,” Jack said sarcastically, knowing he was probably right. They both laughed.
They continued playing for hours until Stephen had to go finish homework he was doing last second for his morning history class. They hung up the phone, and Jack was now alone but was left more at ease—either from Stephen’s jokes and downplaying the situation, poking fun at Jack’s overreaction, or just having another person to talk to to alleviate the end of Jack’s seemingly chaotic day.

There wasn’t much else to do. He had already talked to his parents that night and caught up on how things were going. He went to bed shortly after playing a few more games. The rain was settled but kept coming about in intermittent spurts. Something woke him—he heard a thud or a crack in the house he couldn’t make out, being mostly asleep. It wasn’t unusual for that to happen, he thought, and brushed it off. He then heard the sound of a car out front, and it was a neighbor pulling in across the street. Even after Jack’s relief, he still felt on edge and on high alert. The couple of sounds seemed to revive some anxiety that had vanished earlier. Lying in his bed, he looked out again, then one more time a few moments later out of paranoia and a last attempt of reassurance he could sleep soundly.

Another snap, the same as before, was heard in the house, only further. He nervously got up to investigate. In extreme hesitation, he poked his head looking towards the dim hallway. Jack gained some confidence and scoured the upstairs while turning the lights on. He looked out the windows of his parents’ room at the backyard, then peered out over the railing down to the downstairs hallway. I guess the house is just creaking and I’m being a little girl about it? Jack thought. In frustration, he turned the lights off, shut his bedroom door, locked it, and went to bed.

The midnight rain began to pick up and into the night persisted as a soothing white noise, with Jack’s window being cracked. His frustrations before bed allowed him to put his worries behind him and sleep like the man of a household does—comfortably, but with one eye open, as they say. During Jack’s sleep, the sound of a slow-moving vehicle could be heard pulling up just across the street.

The sound of the car being put into park was enough to wake him again. Jack took a second to peer out his window, being as tired as he was and now annoyed. He looked out and saw it was a black Jeep Cherokee parked on the other side of his house. His heart raced and he looked away from the window. Is it the guy? he asked himself with the utmost fear now settling in him. He went to look, but nobody got out. The windows were dark and he couldn’t make anything out from where he was. He laid back in bed, terrified of the thought that he knew the person saw him look. If it was the man, then I assume he saw me trying to see if it was him. What is this!? he thought to himself angrily and fearfully.

A car door then opened and shut, and Jack couldn’t bear himself to look outside. Footsteps a moment later made their way toward the house in an offbeat rhythm and veered off to the left and stopped. Jack boldly made a peek out the window and couldn’t see anybody. What? What!? he said to himself quietly in immense confusion. Is he sneaking up on me? Jack wanted to confirm the front door was locked but couldn’t in fear of leaving his room. He needed to hear what was going on.

“Where did the man go?” Jack said, trembling. He could barely move a muscle, too nervous to even take a step away from where he was. He didn’t want to make the faintest sound.
The faintest sound of the front door opening slowly could be heard downstairs. Jack nearly fainted, his heart was beating out of his chest, realizing the door was unlocked the entire day. He stayed put in his room silently, with his whole body tingling with panic.

There was no sound to be heard. Jack tried to open his window slowly while in a haze, listening attentively to the sounds and footsteps of the person below. Jack quietly got the window fully open, and he waited there. The silence was ominous—it was unbearable. The man could suddenly be heard running up the stairs and immediately at the top tried forcing the door open but couldn’t. Jack, still on the verge of screaming and fainting, noticed the man stopped. He heard him shuffle back a few paces away from the door.

Jack, on the verge of collapse, listened, then—Snap! Jack yelled. The man’s foot blasted through the door, making a huge opening, and the man got down on a knee to reach his left arm through the hole and up to unlock the latch on the other side of the door. He fiddled with the lock and slammed the door open. Jack instinctively drew himself to the window, climbed out to the edge, and without much hesitation leaped from the second-story window to the grass. He rolled on his shoulder hard enough to feel injured on getting up, but he still had the ability to run.

The man’s loud footsteps could be heard running down the wooden stairs in pursuit of Jack, who made a run for it as fast as he could. He made his way sprinting down the harrowing street of his neighborhood and could see the man in the distance wildly running after him. Jack almost started crying and yelled out, “Help!” loudly a couple of times as he tried keeping a steady gap between him and the man.

There wasn’t much use—the fact was nobody was awake to be immediate help. Jack kept his pace and he began to lose the man behind him, making his way around the corner to his local park. The man followed around the corner, but Jack was already most of the way through the park, entering the other side of the neighborhood.

Exhausted from running, Jack made it a few blocks down and hid behind some shrubs bordering the front of a neighbor’s house. I’ll lay here and watch for a while, he said, covered in sweat. His stomach on the dirt, arms and shoulders on the ground, he watched from behind the shrub, hidden. Jack sat there lying a few minutes until finally, the man—who he could see now was the one from before: six feet tall, the same jacket and denim pants along with a strange hat. The man was looking around aimlessly in search for Jack, now looking frustrated. Nearing closer in Jack’s direction, he could hear the man muttering words and swearing to find him.
“That fucki— that fucking kid, I’ll find him and kill him.”

His delirious state of mind and words just spoken startled Jack immensely. He couldn’t believe that was the same man from yesterday. He couldn’t believe he actually had vile intentions the entire time. It was all a sick trick, he thought to himself, thinking back to yesterday, trembling again. He watched as the man continued on, so Jack reached for his phone. It was at home on his bed.

“Damnit!” he whispered. “It makes sense—I did leave suddenly, but at a time like this?”
Jack allowed for a few more minutes to pass with the idea in mind to make his way back home, hoping he could build up the courage to. A few moments passed—it was time. He slowly crept upward about halfway, making a few glances of confirmation and started walking toward the street. He wanted to run, but if the man was near he thought he’d run into him unexpectedly or draw attention to the sound of himself if he wasn’t walking cautiously. The streetlights gave an incandescent and eerie feel as he made his way along. It stopped raining but a light sprinkle could be felt as Jack proceeded home.

He passed through the park to his side of the neighborhood. Not once had a car passed, and at an instant, a cat made its way across the street, startling Jack. He continued walking and his steps grew at a faster pace as he was approaching his house. He ran up, locked the front door with haste, and quickly got upstairs. He grabbed his phone from his bed and walked downstairs. He was peering out the living room windows, keeping watch for the man, as he called 911.

He saw something outside—he couldn’t make it out, it was hard to tell in the dark of night. The operator answered. “Hello, this is 911, what is your emergency?”
Jack gave a quick summary of what happened at 7-Eleven with the mysterious man. He quickly summarized the initial interaction, the man passing moments later in his car, seeing his house, and the later visiting him that evening and how he snuck up into the house, to his room and chased him out and down the street. The operator listened attentively, taking notes and asking further questions.
“Can you give me a description of what this man looks like?”
Jack turned away from the window, giving the reply.

The man was staring at Jack from behind the corner wall of the kitchen who’d been waiting for him to enter the house. He was smiling insanely with his pocket knife in hand.
“Ahhhhhhh!” Jack screamed and cried, dropping his phone. He picked up a two-foot candlestick stand nearest to him at the window.

The man took a step forward, making himself fully visible, and ran at Jack with a sinister and crooked look. Jack swung as he neared, hitting his side. The man tried grabbing Jack’s shirt, but Jack barely slipped away running toward the dining table. The man followed, laughing, running around, swinging his knife towards Jack, slashing his arm from across the table. The table gave a few feet of distant between them. The man got on the table and stepped over toward Jack in another attempt to grab him, but Jack kicked him off and missed a swing with the candle stand.

Jack ran for the stairs, with the man just behind him. The man to grabbed him by the shirt ready to stab him as they neared the top of the stairs. Jack spun around quickly, in a full 180 degrees, and swung with all his might, and the candle stand struck the man badly on the side of the head. The man immediately dropped to the top steps of the stairs, bleeding, and tumbled down to the bottom of the stairs. He lay there unconscious.

Jack started sobbing profusely. This went on for a moment. He then couldn’t endure another second of being at the top of the stairs looking down at the man. He didn’t know for sure if he was dead or not. Jack ran down the stairs, wiping his tears, and grabbed the knife off the floor that the man dropped after being hit, and called 911 again. He made the call from the sidewalk, looking into his house with the front door open.

He was traumatized and couldn’t bear being in the vicinity of the man who was likely dead. The cops couldn’t believe it. Jack’s parents and his friends later couldn’t believe what happened that night. Most of all, Jack couldn’t believe it. He was sitting there partially in delirium and a haze as the authorities made their way inside to investigate the scene. Jack stayed outside with a few cops who comforted him and asked a series of questions. The man was declared dead due to that mighty blow to the head with the candle stand. 

Jack was thinking how such a seemingly perfect day turned into a nightmare. He thought how just going to a 7 Eleven wouldn’t be the same anymore or even being at home. His prior worries of the man were justified with the events that happened that evening. This moment never left Jack, but the trauma got better with time, and he went on to venture into those things we mentioned in the beginning of the story.
The one thing he learned from this day was to never leave your front door unlocked.

Am I 20M wrong?","Hi reddit, This is my first post on this subreddit. The thing is, almost 2 months back I asked a girl from my coaching for coffee but she gave a vague response and I took it as a no. From past few days my friends have been asking me to ask her out again on text. I did that. Very formally. 
""Hi xyz, hope you’re doing well! Abc this side. Got your contact from the common group.  Remember  I had asked you for coffee once but then didn’t follow up. I kinda got awkward. Anyway, I thought I’d say hello properly this time instead of staying quiet. If you’re up for it, would you like to grab that coffee sometime? If not, totally fine.""
She replied ""Hi Abc, thanks for asking. Coffee’s not really my thing, but appreciate you reaching out. Happy to stay in touch here.""
To me it's a polite no.
But literally all of my friends who are in the batch are saying this is a very clear signal.

Their pont is: I asked her out the second day of our interaction without any considerable interaction or conversation then also she didn't say a clear no. After that I didn't follow up when she returned and neither greeted her with a basic hi/hello for literally 2 months and suddenly out of blue I am texting her this. Then also she replied to you politely and she never closed the door by adding happy to connect here. By leaving a door open as I never offered that. They say cannot say yes as she is afraid what I might think of her.

I genuinely feel she did this to not make me feel bas moreover it's also sounding AI written. They're all asking me to start initiating conversations with her. The point is, they're all boys and I am also a boy. Can the kind ladies of this subreddit please help me 🙃. I feel this is a no and if it's not a no then it's too mixed vibe.

BTW I replied to her, Ok no worries, totally respect this. And they all are scolding me by claiming that I should've texted something witty. Please help.",1,1758232600.0,RelationshipIndia,1,1.0,False

1nklm1o,https://www.reddit.com/r/alphaandbetausers/comments/1nklm1o/bean_stuff_an_app_that_helps_you_quickly_find/,Bean Stuff - An app that helps you quickly find actually good coffee shops easily (for coffee snobs),"Hi I have been working on a new app called Bean Stuff, no, this is not an AI account. I just set up a Reddit account for the app and then realised how spammy it looks when I post anything now :)

**What does this app do?**

Based on your location or an entered location, it will find all the coffee shops around you, rank them, and then list them out for you. It filters them based on a criteria with the goal of only showing you ""specialty"" coffee shops. When you just Google ""coffee shops,"" you get everything bad coffee shops, chains, and it is hard to see what is actually good. This app is for coffee snobs.

**The problem I want to solve with this app.**

I am passionate about coffee, so when I travel, I like to find great local coffee spots. Being in a new place, I would have to use Google and look for coffee shops. This was ok, but Google and I disagree on what good coffee is. So I would have to spend time sifting through results, finding ones that looked good, and then see where they were located and how far from me they were. Instead of doing all of this, I wanted an app that I could open and instantly see where good coffee shops are and have it be based on objective reasoning, not what others thought, as they may have a different opinion of good coffee.

**How does the app solve this problem?**

The app has an algorithm that uses your location and searches the web for coffee shops in your area (it does not have a single data source). It then lists the coffee shops in the app and plots them on a map so that you can see where they are in relation to you. It also assigns a ""snob score"" to each coffee shop that you can then filter on. So now you can decide how much of a snob you want to be, filter based on that, and then see what is close by. Could you do all of this with Google? Yes. Not saying I invented the wheel here. But this takes the work out of it, and for someone who loves coffee, having an almost instant and reliable way to find the best coffee around is huge!

I sat in a big fluffy chair against a wall and watched my wife enjoy herself. I wasn’t very social back then, I only came because she had asked me to. I heard a man take a seat on the couch to the left of me and when I turned to see who, I saw a man in a hoodie holding a big blue can of beer in my face. 

“Beer?” The man asked. 
“No I don’t drink but thank you” I politely answered. 
“Oh, why?” He said in a rather casual tone while he put the can on an end table next to him and took a drink of his opened one. I was confused by this and I guess I had shown it on my face. 
“I don’t mean to try and pressure you” he said “I only ask because there’s two kinds of non-drinkers. The ones who have trauma around it and the ones who don’t like the feeling or don’t like who they are when they’re drunk. I’ve always thought it’s kind of cool to see who is who."" He looked at me with a soft expression and kind smile, if he had seemed any different I would’ve gotten up and left. Instead I answered him. 

“Trauma” I said and that night was the first time I had a conversation without worrying if what I said was embarrassing. I learned that his name was Jason, he had come over from Iowa and that he didn’t like his family but never said why. I told him my name is Taylor and my fears about being a father. 

We had talked for so long that I had lost track of time. I only realized how late it had gotten when Anna, my wife, came to ask if I was ready to leave. I said goodbye to Jason, and got up to follow Anna. 

“Drive safe” Jason said “you’re gonna be an amazing father” he said to my back, and I felt as if he had really meant it. 



The second time I met him I didn’t recognize him. It was about a year later, my wife had gotten pregnant that night after the house party. I was out shopping for baby supplies for our new born daughter. 

I remember I was getting ready to pay for the assortment of food, diapers, and other things in my cart when a woman stopped right infront of me. 

“Taylor” she said with the tone of an old friend “how have you been?” She asked. 

“I’m sorry, do I know you?” I asked, looking her up and down trying to find something that stuck out, something that would pierce the fog of drowsiness in my mind. That’s when I looked into her eyes, that simple glance took me back to that night. 

“Oh” she began “I’m sorry I forget that others don’t ha-“ 

“Jason?” I cut her off “the house party right? I thought you were a dude”. I said with a bit of a laugh. She laughed a bit with me 

“Well I was back then, I started transitioning to a woman around a year ago. It’s Isabell now” she said with a bit of tension in her voice, as if bracing herself for something. 

“Oh” I said in thought, I hadn’t known that was a thing until now. “Well you look good, and really happy” as I said this she seemed to relax a bit, as if something I said soothed her but I didn’t understand what. 

“Thanks” She said back with a smile “you look like a father” 

We both laughed and continued to talk for longer than I really meant to. We talked about how it was possible for her to be a woman through hormones and how much of a little terror my daughter was. Just like the first time I felt free to say whatever I felt. 

Then my phone rang, it was Anna asking if I’d be home soon. I told her I’d be home as soon as I could be and said goodbye to Isabell for the second time. 


Quite a few years later I had forgotten all about Isabell. My career had taken off allowing me to buy a house, it wasn’t fancy but it was a good home. Anna had started her own business, my daughter was 12 now. My life, until this day, was going well. Earlier in the morning my daughter had told me something, something she made me promise not to tell mom. It was a subject I only knew about thanks to Isabell. 

I sat leaned back in my chair in the cafe, my laptop open in front of me but I was too lost in thought to see the screen. Instead I just scratched my lower lip and chin. Then, as if knowing I needed her, Isabell sat across from me. 

“Hi Taylor” she said, setting her purse on the table. This time I recognized her but she had changed so much. There was no sign of Jason anywhere except for soft her eyes and her kind smile. 

“Isabell?” I said somewhat shocked “what’re you doing here?” 

“Oh I was teaching one of my students not far from here and needed a late morning pick-me-up” she slightly shook her coffee as she said this. “I’m surprised you remember me after all this time” 

“I was actually thinking about you funny enough” I said then realized how that sounded and chuckled a bit “in a friendly way of course” 

She laughed a sweet laugh and said “don’t worry I’m not gonna go anywhere near Anna’s territory” she said, flicking her hand downward playfully at me. ""How's your wife and daughter doing?” 

I sighed and leaned forward, closing my laptop. “Actually I was just told I don’t have a daughter, I have a son and my wife doesn’t know it yet.” This got a side eye from Isabell “I don’t know what to do” I continued “I want what’s best for whatever type of kid I have and I’m scared because I don’t know what to expect. How was it when you started working on being a woman?” 

She looked down at her cup as if my words brought back a deep pain she forgot. As it turns out, it did. She explained everything to me. She told me about the town she grew up in and how scared she had been to tell her parents. Turns out her fears were right and her parents kicked her out, this is how she came to be at that house party. She had found a place to live with that friend of a friend of Anna’s. At the end of it all she told me that she was happier than she ever knew she could be. 

We sat in a long silence after her story, taking the entirety of her life that she had laid before me. 
“What if I mess it up?” I asked, I wasn’t asking Isabell specifically but she answered anyways 

“You will” she said and I looked up at her eyes as she spoke “it’s gonna happen no matter what, so give yourself room to say ‘I’m sorry’. My parents never did that, it would’ve changed a lot probably.” Then she looked out the window. We say for a bit longer talking here and there, nothing too serious. 

Then she got up and said that her next lesson was starting soon and that she needed to go. She handed me her card before she left in case me or my son needed anything. “Isabells magic keys” it said in bold leaders with a long winding line of piano keys on it. I kept the card, even to today. 



I wouldn’t get a chance to use it though. Two months later I got a call on my cell phone. I remember I had just sat on the couch to watch tv with Anna and Jason, my son. I answered the phone with a harsh annoyed tone, which dropped the moment a shaky voice started talking. The man who had called was a friend of Isabell’s, he explained that she had died and my name was on the list of people she wanted at her funeral. 

I didn’t understand why she had such a list or why I would be on it. I went regardless, I owed her that much. Anna and Jason also came. Anna had heard through her friends that Isabell had been murdered. A man posed as a father and used her business to get her into his house. To this day I will never understand such evil, I wonder if the man could ever understand the kindness he had taken away. 

While at the funeral I met lots of people who knew Isabell, they knew her more than I ever could. Many of them never knew she used to be Jason, that was known to only a few of us. During the wake I had walked up to the casket, it was closed. I looked over and saw a woman standing next to me, she looked almost like Isabell. 

“Did you know her well?” I said, stumbling over what to say. 

She looked at me with a harsh look “I knew my brother quite well, thank you” then she crossed her arms and stood there a bit angry. 

I looked at her with sadness that she never knew how amazing her sister was “no, you didn’t” I said in a factual tone and simply walked away. I walked by myself somewhat aimlessly until I found myself in a silent room. I stood for a second enjoying the silence when I heard someone sniffling. I looked over and saw a person in a chair, they wore a black dress that looked a bit too small on their wide frame. I walked over to them softly and as they looked up I could see the dark shade of a freshly shaved beard under their running makeup. 

I simply looked down at them and asked with a gentle smile “do you drink?” 

They shook their head no as another tear ran down their cheek.

1nkll0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nkll0u/electric_kettle_vs_coffee_maker_which_boils_faster/,Electric kettle vs coffee maker: which boils faster?,"Hey everyone! I've been on a mission to perfect my morning coffee routine, and I recently stumbled upon an interesting discovery that I think you'll find useful. After years of using a traditional coffee maker, I decided to experiment with an electric kettle, and the results were pretty eye-opening.

First off, let me share what prompted this experiment. My old coffee maker was taking forever to heat up, and I was getting impatient (especially during those groggy Monday mornings). I'd heard people raving about electric kettles, so I decided to give one a try. I found this awesome model on https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle that had great reviews, and I'm so glad I took the plunge.

Here's what I discovered: Electric kettles are significantly faster at boiling water than coffee makers. We're talking about a difference of several minutes here. While my coffee maker typically takes 8-10 minutes to heat water for brewing, my electric kettle gets the job done in about 3-4 minutes flat.

But why such a big difference? It comes down to the heating element design. Electric kettles are specifically engineered for one job - heating water quickly and efficiently. They have powerful heating elements that are in direct contact with the water, while coffee makers have to distribute heat through various components before actually heating the water.

Some other benefits I've noticed:
- Energy efficiency (less electricity used due to faster heating)
- Temperature control options (perfect for different types of coffee and tea)
- Versatility (great for instant noodles, hot chocolate, and more)
- Safer design with auto shut-off features

If you're thinking about making the switch, I'd highly recommend checking out the selection at https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle. They have some great options that won't break the bank.

One thing to keep in mind: while electric kettles boil water faster, you'll still need a separate method for brewing coffee, like a French press or pour-over setup. But trust me, the time saved and the control you get over water temperature make it totally worth it.

I've been using my electric kettle for about six months now, and I honestly can't imagine going back to waiting around for my coffee maker to heat up. The convenience factor alone has been a game-changer for my morning routine.

What's your experience with electric kettles vs. coffee makers? I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences in the comments below!",1,1758232432.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

I've been REALLY struggling getting any work done ever since I've switched from working at libraries, universities, and coffee shops - to working from home. I'm an animator, and the main reason I'm switching to working at home is because I upgraded from laptop to PC for my animation work (PC is faster + more efficient).

There are SO many distractions at home. Today, for instance - I literally spent about 5 hours ""taking care"" of my bonsai tree during the time I should have spent working. Yesterday, I walked my dog for a couple hours while I should've been working. Other days, I'll waste time doing things like watching tv/videos, cleaning, or just laying on my bed doing nothing but scrolling on my phone. Since my ""office"" is in my room, it's easy for me to tell myself I'll take only a 5 minute break on my phone lying in bed - only for that 5 minutes to turn into hours of wasted time.

Working at home causes me to take my sweet time with EVERYTHING! Making/eating breakfast, walking my dog, simply getting up in the morning, etc. I feel no sense or urgency or pressure to get things done quickly - probably because I'm already in my comfortable home. It's incredibly hard for me to even wake up on time and start working at the designated time I tell myself (8am-4pm). I also feel less energy ever since I stopped going out of the house to work. Another thing that bugs me is how isolating/lonely working from home can feel. I also should mention I have ADHD, which only amplifies all of these problems.

I need serious help guys - before this starts affecting my career!! Any advice you have is greatly appreciated. Thanks.",5,1758232053.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

I found a wonderful partner that embraces me, herpes and all.","I was diagnosed with HSV-2 at 20. I'm 31 now. I had had a few boyfriends since then, but for the past 5 or 6 years I've struck out *hard*. Cannot tell you how many times I have seen the light wither in a man's eyes in real time during a disclosure. The advice was to always wait two or three dates before telling them, but that only meant building things up and breaking my own heart again and again. It was killing me. Every girl friend of mine found loving partners, but... there I was. The perpetual solitary, the sexual pariah.

I switched up my strategy. On Hinge, there's this thing called a Match Note, a message that only generates if a person matches with you. In it, I disclose that I have herpes. This means that I am able to automatically disclose to people right from the jump. It's pragmatic, to-the-point, impersonal. If herpes is a deal breaker, they can unmatch and filter themselves out without sending some awkward, conciliatory message meant to turn me down without hurting my feelings. They just disappear.

I matched with a variety of men. No real chemistry, but at least the herpes talk was out of the way. Well, three weeks of that and I matched with a guy. We went on an excellent date. We connected over shared backgrounds, interests, curiosities. Five unbroken hours at a coffee shop, just ravenously learning about each other. On date two, I touched on the topic of herpes to gauge where he's at. He said that after receiving the Match Note, he did *a lot* of research into herpes. The probability of transmission, the potential dangers. He said that it sounds virtually harmless, that the greatest harm it presents is the mental impact of stigma. And, *wow*, was it refreshing to listen to someone educated on the topic. He doesn't mind that I have herpes--not because he has it or because he's irresponsible with regards to sexual health, but because he looked at the established medical information on herpes and made the informed decision to pursue me regardless.

On future dates, we had sex. And it was fantastic. No shame on my end, no hesitation on his. He genuinely desires me, all of me. For the first time in a long time, herpes does not feel like a specter looming over me. Last night, we made our relationship official. I'm so happy.",7,1758232010.0,Herpes,3,0.89,False

First, why do you personally feel it’s important to use one for your own case? Some people lean on it for privacy when they’re online all the time, others say it’s more about keeping safe on public WiFi, and then there are folks who just want access to shows or sites that aren’t available in their country.

The second part is more specific, why do so many people see the Surfshark VPN extension as their go-to option? From what I’ve seen, it looks simple to use and doesn’t feel too heavy on the system, but I’m wondering if there’s more to it. Maybe it’s the price, the speed, or the fact that it covers unlimited devices.

Personally, I get why a VPN matters, coz even simple stuff like browsing on free WiFi at a coffee shop can leave you wide open. But when it comes to choosing one, it seems like Surfshark keeps popping up in conversations as the favorite. So yeah, I wanna hear people’s thoughts why is using a VPN a must for you, and why do you think Surfshark’s extension beats the rest?",1,1758231998.0,VPN_Question,0,1.0,False

Reggie & Curt and Rod: SHADY QUEENS!! These divas are gossiping and throwing shade about people left right and centre!

Daisuke and Dishy: Now I know people hate Dishy but I feel like Daisuke is the only one that talks to it.

   * Awesome location, max 5 mins walk from Myeongdong Station Exit 4
   * Very comfortable and clean bunk bed/capsule (has curtains for privacy)
   * Had lockers with a lock
   * Friendly and helpful host
   * Small breakfast included (toast, jam, peanut butter, cereal and tea/coffee if I remember correctly), do forget to clean your own dishes
   * Laundry machines (for a small fee), and there were drying racks open for anyone to use (I wouldn't recommend leaving very valuable pieces on them)
   * Vanity area with large mirrors, great spot to do hair or makeup before going out
   * Showers and toilets were okay; they do provide shampoo and body wash, but if you're particular about shower products, buy your own 
      * ALSO WEAR FLIP FLOPS
2. Seoul Cube Itaewon
   1. Beds were decent, there was a slight smell of humidity, but that's to be expected with summer in Seoul
   2. Awesome washroom, like honestly, I showered so many times because it was just so relaxing (specifically the larger shower room with the toilet and sink inside)
   3. Breakfast included; there was quite a variety, in my opinion. I can't remember everything they had, but I remember every morning I would eat two toast with butter, ham and cheese and drank tea as well. I think they had cereal as well
   4. Friendly host, and I found so many nice guests to interact with at night in the lobby
   5. Good security, you need a code to get into the building and the rooms (different codes)
   6. Provided lockers outside of the room (not large enough for a suitcase or carry-on, I had mine beside my mattress in my bunk)

I'm not sure if this is the right place for me to talk about this, but this place is called ""off my chest"" and I definitely have a lot of things to get off my chest right now.

I apologize in advance if I end up making lots of grammar mistakes, as English isn't my first language, and I usually don't write stories that long. This is going to be an incredibly long story, but I just didn't find a way to condense it any more than I already did.

Anyway, let's get to the point. I (now 28M) have been in a really toxic relationship 5 years ago (then 22M), the experience of which really messed with my mind and self worth, and it still affects me to this day.

It all began in 2019, during my second year at university. The year before, my long term girlfriend - someone I had been with on and off for seven or eight years - ever since we were kids - had broken up with me. That was a heavy situation in its own right, but that's not the focus of this particular story. The breakup was painful for a few months, yet because it ended on relatively good terms, and because I was now living in a new city, constantly meeting people and discovering new experiences in my first year, I managed to not think too much about it and moved on fairly quickly. Looking back now, that time - transitioning from my first year into my second was the happiest period of my life. But then everything changed.

At the start of my second year, a few friends and I went to this welcoming party for the new first years. The subject I studied isn’t exactly popular, so every year only a handful of people enroll. That makes us a small but tight-knit group where everyone knows everyone. Anyway, during the party one girl from the new batch caught my attention. Not in a romantic or sexual way or anything like that, she just really reminded me of someone, and I couldn’t for the life of me figure out who (I still don’t know lol). I’m not going to use her real name (or anyone's for that matter),so let’s just call her Emily (then 19F).

After a while she had noticed that I had been staring at her, so she approached me. I expected our conversation to be awkward, but we hit it off right from the start, which was rare for me, as I was a very anxious and introverted person. But talking to her I somehow felt no anxiety. Eventually we both grew tired of the party, so we left it together and walked back home to our dorms. We exchanged our socials, said our goodnights and went our separate ways. I thought it was a pleasant night, but didn't think much of anything about that girl in the following days and just continued with my regular life. 

Then she started texting me a lot, and I mean **a lot**. At first I found it a bit weird that some girl I talked to once at a party was absolutely bombarding my phone with memes, and conversations of a very familiar nature, as if we were close friends for years, but slowly I started to lower my guard down and did the same to her. Eventually we decided to just meet up at the stairwell of our dorm, as we both lived at the same building, but on different floors. We ended up sitting there and talking into the late hours of the night. Our conversation turned more and more flirty (mostly through her initiative), she became very touchy, we had tickle fights etc. I noticed then, that I saw traces of my ex girlfriend in her, and I told her that. Funnily enough she said I reminded her of her own ex too, and that's why she was so eager to get to know me better.

After that first night at the stairwell we started meeting there every evening in the same place - at the top level of the stairwell - where nobody usually came. Then, during one of our tickle fights I accidentally pinched one of her breasts as a defense mechanism when I was being tickled. I didn't do it consciously, I am just very sensitive to tickling, and to make it stop I usually just flail my arms around everywhere to make it stop, and it just somehow happened to land on her breast that time. I of course apologized immediately, but the mood changed completely between us. Her chatty manic personality and touchy behavior was immediately replaced with stone cold silence. She then backed away from me. Then, with a voice full of sadness and maybe even contempt she told me that I objectified her with that action, that I clearly don't respect women, and that she's very disappointed in me, as she thought I wasn't like the other guys. I kept apologizing and said it was an accident, but she wasn't having it and told me that she'll be going back to her room, and then she left.

At that point I thought that I irreparably fucked things up and this would be the end for whatever that even was between us, but in a couple of days she was back to bombarding my socials with her messages and memes, and soon enough we met on that stairwell again. She told me that she still haven't forgiven me about the breast incident, and that it would only be fair for her to ""violate"" my private parts to make things even. I didn't object, so she started a tickle fight again and then she pinched my balls through my pants (wasn't a pleasant feeling). We then went back to our usual deep conversations, and flirtatious questions and answers.

Eventually we ended up cuddling on that stairwell like a couple of homeless junkies, and she was laying on top of me like I was a body sized pillow for her. She eventually sat up and started grinding on my crotch. I asked her what she was doing. She replied in a most childishly innocent voice that she was just being friendly and that she's just a naturally touchy person. I laughed it off, and told her that maybe we should just go to my room, she agreed. 

Thankfully none of my two roomates were around at the time, so we had some privacy. We got in my bed and cuddled. Eventually, through her initiation, more serious things happened, but we were awkwardly interrupted by one of my roomates who returned to the room, so we just called it a night and fell asleep together. When I woke up early next morning for work, she didn't let me leave the bed by putting her hand into my underwear, and grabbing me by my privates. We fooled around, but eventually I had to leave. I know I'm throwing out a lot of information at you, but these things will be important later, so bear with me. 

As time went on, sex became almost a daily occurrence for us, but I should mention, that funnily enough, even though we were having regular sex, we hadn't kissed each other yet, so I suppose we were going through this whole thing backwards, starting off heavy without having experienced anything light beforehand. Then, a couple of weeks later, during one of our evenings we were listening to good music, cracking jokes, and then talking about something deep with each other, and then there was this perfect moment of silence when we just looked into each other's eyes for a couple of seconds, and without even thinking, I instinctively leaned in to finally kiss her. It was a long and passionate kiss, but when it ended, she pulled away and seemed very caught off guard by it, even started panicking a little bit, and started pacing circles around my room and not saying anything. I have to admit that I was quite confused by her reaction considering we've done a whole lot worse things for a few weeks now. I asked her if everything was alright. She paused for a bit, and without looking at me, told me: ""everything is both alright and *very* not alright."". I asked her why. Was my kissing  bad, or if I stepped out of line, but she told me: ""no, nothing like that, I just promised myself I wouldn't do this with any guy, at least not for a couple of years while I'm studying here. I told her that we alreary did far worse off things and she seemed to have no problem with it. She then started doing her innocent childish voice again and told me: ""that was different, OP, I was just being *friendly* with you"". I then thought that maybe she took our fooling around as a casual thing with no strings attached, and the kiss now finally made it seem ""real"" for her, like something she couldn't easily back away from anymore. I told her that we can stop everything if that's what she wanted, but after a short pause she finally walked up to me again. I noticed a slight smile on her face, but also the shine of a single tear running down her cheek, she looked me in the eyes and told me: ""No... I don't think I want this to stop. But I'm afraid that I will end up really hurting you one day"", and then she kissed me herself. If only I took her warning seriously back then.

After that night, things definitely changed between us. While before she was very touchy in a slightly annoying way (random tickles, slapping my ass without warning, randomly grabbing private areas) she was now touchy in a much more sweet and mellow way (holding my hand, snuggling herself up to me, softly caressing my skin, placing my hand on her thigh etc.) She became much less hyper and ""crazy"" too, and more softspoken and ""real"" with me. We started hanging out almost every day, constantly going to the movies, visiting museums, watching Netflix either at my or her room, going on walks, taking small trips to nearby cities, etc. She even took me to her hometown where she introduced me to her mom, dad, as well as her siblings, all of whom seemed to really like me, and has shown interest in meeting my parents which I would have happily arranged had they've not been out of the country at the time. 

Things were going great for almost a year, to the point where I remember thinking to myself how strange it was that we seemed to avoid having even the slightest of arguments throughout that entire period, considering that during my last and only relationship we used to have major arguments pretty frequently before we both had enough. Not that I haven't noticed at least some unpleasant things about her, such as the fact that she avoided talking about us, or showing the same level of affection to me when around other people from my study community, for example - only holding my hand when obscured behind a table, or kissing me only when taking me into a different room where no people could see us, while around others. The only people that she didn't try to hide our relationship from were our closest friends. Or when around complete strangers who didn't know us. But showing affection around our own community was a big nono for her.

I also noticed that she had a particular dislike of my female friends, especially my best friend, let's call her Victoria, who was a fellow second year, and with who I used to hang out with the most before I met Emily. Victoria was actually very happy about Emily and I being together, and was actually the person who pushed me to get to know Emily better from the very start when she started bombarding my socials with memes and I was weirded out. She also tried befriending Emily multiple times by inviting her to her parties or just to drink coffee with us in-between classes and so on, but Emily would always find some excuse, and in those rare moments when they were in the presence of one another, Emily would always go completely silent, keeping her distance and would have an annoyed look on her face, which was a huge contrast to her usual hyper and chatty personality. At the time I suspected Emily felt threatened by Victoria due to our closeness, but I always assured her that Victoria is like a sister to me and nothing else. Emily would tell me that she's not jealous, she just simply dislikes Victoria as a person. Eventually I just let that issue go. (They did actually start getting along perfectly fine several years later when they both ended up in the same group when studying their master's degree, so it seems Emily only had a problem with Victoria only when we were together)

Emily would also pretty consistently ask me if I wasn't ready to ""run away"" from her yet, as ""she was going to end up hurting me one day"", especially during very sweet moments, such as cuddling in my bed, kissing, or talking about deep things. All these things seem like very red flags to me now with hindsight, but I don't know, back then I somehow ignored all those things and rationalized them within my head, not wanting to admit that some day things could actually go wrong. Eventually though that day inevitably came.

In our study program, first year students have to go on a two week trip to do some practice field work, so after almost a year of seeing one another almost every day, we parted ways and she went on that trip. A week into her trip some friends and I decided to visit that place, as it's also the place of an annual festival which we wanted to visit, and also we were just interested to see how the first years were handling their first field practice.
When we came there, all of the first years were gone for the weekend except for Emily and one of the guys from her group, let's call him Peter. Immediately things seemed off to me, as that guy was following Emily around everywhere she went, even to the point where he followed her to the bathroom and waited by the door for her to come out. They would also sit very close to one another and I could swear I saw the same patterns of behaviour in Emily that she would do when around our community with me. I could swear I saw her holding his hand under the table, but I was afraid to come off as overbearing or paranoid, but when I asked my friends if they were seeing the same thing, they told me they see it too. Eventually I snapped and took Emily outside the house we were all in to talk about all this. She told me I was being paranoid, and that all of this was just in my head. She admitted that she was being touchy with him, but told me that I out of all people should know by now that it's just how she was brought up and doesn't mean anything by it, it's just her way of being friendly. I wasn't exactly satisfied with that conversation but I let it go for then.

We went back into the house, and then she insisted on holding both of our hands without hiding as a way to show that this didn't mean anything. I still felt very uncomfortable about the situation, as I had never seen her acting that way around other guys throughout our entire year together. But I stayed silent. Then I noticed that the both of them started disappearing somewhere, and I couldn't for the life of me find them anywhere. It was late at night, and completely dark everywhere around us, as it was a pretty rural forested area. I ended up finding them sitting cuddled next to one another on a remote steep hill. I got very upset but she just called me paranoid again and told me that they got tired of all the noise and just wanted to go to a quieter place to wind down. All three of us then walked back to the cabin where the others were.

Pretty soon they disappeared again, but this time I couldn't find them. One of my friends however did see them, and told me he saw them making out in a secluded area. That's when I really got angry. My friends were upset on my behalf too. I found Emily and dragged her away from everyone for a talk yet again. But this time I was yelling, and asking whether it was true she was kissing him. She got angry too, yelling at me that I'm just like her parents who are apparently overbearing and controlling, that I don't trust her, that I don't accept her for who she is etc. But eventually she admitted that she did in fact kiss him. I had nothing to say to that, and just wanted to walk away, but she stopped me and started saying the same old spiel how none of that means anything, that's just how she interacts with people, that's it's just her way of being friendly and that there's no feelings between them. Then she tried making me believe that I have an antiquated idea of how people interact with one another these days, that everyone does these things with their friends and it's completely normal, that I'm just too jealous and controlling to realize that, and that I was even somehow misogynistic and hypocritical and that I think it's fine for men to do these things with their female friends but not for women with their male friends (I absolutely don't. I don't think anyone should be making out, or sensually touching their friends while having a significant other, nor have I ever done anything close to that). I retorted that never in my life have I done even a sliver of the things that she considers ""normal"" when it comes to friendships, nor ever seen any of my friends doing anything of that sort with their friends. 

Our argument went on and on until I told her I just don't want to have anything more to do with her. This triggered her again, she started crying and asking me about what it would take to make this right. Despite everything I loved her deeply and didn't want to lose her, so I told her that she could start by not making out and fondling her friends. She tried to start going off about the same things about it being normal to her before I interrupted her and told her that I don't care and that it's completely unacceptable to me and if she wants to continue having me in her life she would either have to stop, or it's final. I also told her that I lost all trust in her and I don't know how long it would take for me to trust her again, so I would appreciate if she didn't hang out with Peter, the guy who she just made out with. She complained some more, but we eventually came to an understanding and went back to the others with cooler heads.

I also realize that I forgot to mention two very important details, one being the fact that all of this happened on the eve of Emily's birthday. And this argument that we had happened right before 12 am, so as we were returning to the others, half of the people there started singing happy birthday to her, while some from my own friend group who were still angry at her after finding out about the kiss started interrupting the others by yelling at her and calling her the most unpleasant of things. I tried to calm my friends down, because even if I was still mad at her, I didn't think she deserved all of that on her birthday (or any other day tbh). It was something we had to solve by ourselves. But it was too late, Emily had a bit of a mental break, and started having a panic attack (that's the second important detail, she had those from time to time). She then just told me ""Sorry for even being born, I'll just go kill myself"" and ran somewhere into the deep darkness. I tried looking for her for like an hour or two, but couldn't find her. She didn't pick up her phone either. But thankfully she returned a few hours later shortly before sunrise, but wouldn't talk to me or anyone anymore. 

The next day my friends and I had to leave, and I didn't see or talk to Emily for the remainder of the week until she returned from that place. When she did return, she let herself into my room, and we discussed about what had happened the week before. I can't say it was a productive conversation, as we mostly talked about the same things as in our original argument, and I reaffirmed that if we are to have any sort of future she has to stop behaving that way. She said she would try her best and then we parted ways for that day. To my unpleasant surprise, I found out that she was having a party in her room that very same evening, and that besides her, it was just three guys, one of them being Peter.

I texted her to let her know that I knew what was going on, and that I'm just tired of playing the same old game with her over and over again, I specifically asked her to stop hanging out with Peter if she didn't want us to stop seeing each other, and she was doing the exact opposite thing on the same day she made that promise. Instead of texting me back, she went up to my floor, came into my room and locked the door behind her. She then started crying heavily and literally dropped herself on her knees in front of me begging me not to leave her. She told me a lot of sweet nothings about me being the only one in her life with whom she could have a real genuine connection, she said she would do anything and answer anything just to make it right. 

It then occurred to me to think about the nature of our own relationship, how it began, and how she genuinely thought that she was just being ""friendly"" with me when we were having various sexual activities with one another. I realized that if she did all that with me when she thought I was just her ""friend"" until that fateful kiss, she probably did all of those things with her other friends too. So I asked her. Her crocodile tears were suddenly gone and in the most chill and casual voice she said: ""yeah, with most people, though it varies what I do with whom, for most of them I just squeeze or flap around their dicks because I find the feeling funny, but I did have sex with some"". I was completely horrified. I asked her ""if that's your idea of a friendship, what's your idea of a boyfriend, what in your mind is reserved for him?"", She then again very casually and cheerfully did a gesture with her tongue and cheek which implied a fellatio. 

I was completely devastated by everything that I found out. I had spent a year with this girl, and I had never seen or heard even an inkling of anything that she was telling me now. I had a realization that I spent that year living a lie. She had been messing around with pretty much every single male friend of hers behind my back the entire time. It then occurred to me to ask her if she even sees me as her boyfriend, or if I was just another one of her ""friends"". She then honest to God told me: ""No you're not my boyfriend, you never specifically asked me to be your girlfriend, you're just the most special of my friends with whom I spent the majority of my time this past year, and now that I'm spending more time with other people you started getting jealous and are constantly angry with me"". 

I felt completely betrayed, everything was a lie. She introduced me to her family, we talked about the places we would live together in the future, we even talked about having kids some day, and after all that I'm just a friend? It just didn't make any sense. It never even occured to me that I would have to ask something so specific after all the things we've done. She then followed up: ""I can be your girlfriend if you want it that badly, but seeing how you're constantly mad at me for just being myself, as well as being so jealous, I don't see us lasting very long"". 

I didn't have much words to say at that point, I just told her to go back to her party and to leave me alone. She then turned on her annoying baby voice again and told me she wouldn't leave until she knows everything is good between us, and did a toddler-like pout with her lips. I told her that I don't see any way that would ""make it good"" between us, and told her to leave again. Then, she asked if I was really that mad about some party, and that I can come too if I want, as if completely oblivious to the metric ton of shit she just dumped on my brain a minute ago. I asked her to leave for the final time, and she finally did.

I couldn't sleep for most of that night, and in the morning she texted me again, asking me if I still want to be her boyfriend, telling me that she's willing to try and do whatever it takes to get back my trust and for things to go back to normal, though she mentioned that she didn't trust herself enough to be able to stay true to her word for long. This is an exact quote of my response to her: ""I cannot and will not ever be able to act as if nothing happened. Like you yourself said about me, I will constantly feel jealousy. I will judge you, and I will analyze your every move, and if you don't want me to be like this you would have to do something which is impossible. You would have to change your ""communication"" habits from the core, you would have to stop hanging out with Peter, as well as all of your other male friends, and I could go on and on. You will not do this. I will constantly be angry at you, we will constantly fight. Therefore I think it's best we go our separate ways. And I'm not just talking about your stupid party. It's a general issue that I now have with you. Whenever you will as much as talk with any other guy, I will be suspicious and will judge you inside my head, because I can't ever trust you again. You don't even trust yourself with this, you told me as much. Would you actually want this? Do you want to constantly have fights with me over the smallest of issues from now on? Do you want to constantly make excuses for yourself over everything? Because I don't want any of that shit. Goodbye Emily.""

If anyone managed to read my mess of a story up until this point one might think, damn that was a heavy thing, but you managed to do the right thing in the end. Sadly, one would be wrong to think that. The worst of it hasn't even started. After like a month of us not talking anymore, my mental health took a nosedive to the bottom, and my judgement started to get cloudy. I really missed her. I really loved her. I felt the biggest of holes in my chest not being able to be with her anymore. I was addicted to her. 

Eventually I reached out to her again, and ignoring all the pain she caused me, and disregarding what sliver of dignity I had left, asked her if we can just go back to how it used to be, and that I would just learn to ignore her ""side activities"" somehow. This time it was her rejecting me. She told me that I had my opportunity and I didn't use it. It would never be the same between us, but she wouldn't mind staying friends, but not in her old sense of the word, but in mine, so no more physicality, and the time we would spend together would be a fraction of what it once was. 

After that, we would meet up for coffee or a kebab from time to time, but I would see her less and less frequently. Her whole demeanor towards me had changed into a cold indifference with the occasional fake smile thrown in. At the same time I would constantly see her hanging out with Peter and a bunch of other guys, and the knowledge of that would build up resentment in me which would lead me to have outbursts at her after which we would cease contact for a month or two, before my stupidity would inevitably bring me crawling back to her, then that would lead to us hanging out even less, and then rinse and repeat.

I was constantly having an internal battle with myself where one side started idealizing Emily as a person that she never was while at the same time trying to put blame for every thing that went wrong solely on myself, while the other side made me feel deep resentment towards her for everything that she made me go through, imagining myself as a victim that never made any bad decisions about her. I felt like I was going insane, and this made me into a very bitter and ugly person. I was drinking more and more alcohol, I was gaining a lot of weight, I started smoking, and I was becoming rude and dismissive towards my other friends, not just Emily. And it's not like I could cut her out of my life even during the moments when I wanted to, she still lived in the same building, I constantly saw her being around. She is also part of our small community, we went to the same faculty every day, she was friends with many of my friends, so wherever I would go, I would see her. The best I could do was just to avoid talking to her.

To make things worse, Emily started a major gaslighting operation about me, to myself as well as to the wider community of our studies. It was as if she just decided to ""delete her browsing history"" of anything to do during the time when we were ""together"". Whenever I, or anyone else would mention to her something that us two did together, or just generally anything that happened during that period, she would just give the most confused blank stare, a shrug, and either say that it never happened or that she doesn't remember. In her mind we were never anything more than our current form of friends. We had never kissed, had sex, or did anything of any significance together. When somebody from the wider community would ask Emily if we were together, she would say something in the lines of ""oh I hugged OP like once, and then he somehow got into his head that we were a couple because of that, but nothing happened, really"". Then stories such as this would spread to the wider community and be repeated by everyone whenever the question would come up. I was essentially made up to be a hopeless delusional person that was making up lies. I heard those type of comments from her and others so much, that even I myself had started to question my sanity, and my recollection of events. And if it wasn't for the memories of a few of my close friends who did see us together, my old pics, and our old chats, I would have probably fully succumbed to that gaslighting myself.

It took me about two years to finally get over her. In that time I grew to just accept her as who she is and hold no positive or negative feelings towards her. I appreciate the year that we spent, even if it was a lie, before I found out everything each day was full of happiness and adventure. Nowadays I mostly just try to avoid her when I can. She also at least tries to appear very pleasant with me whenever we do end up talking to one another, but she still feels some resentment towards me from the the things other people say she says about me when I'm not there. We stopped hanging out one-on-one entirely long ago, but whether I like it, or not, she is still very much is present in my life, as like I mentioned previously, the community of the thing we studied is very small and close-knit, so even after we both graduated from the university years ago, we are still a part of that community when working in that field, so I see her pretty often. 

I wish I could say that this whole thing was just a silly mess that we can laugh about when looking back at it, because it happened when we were both still very young and stupid in 2019-2020, and that she had since changed and matured for the better, but from considering what I overhear about her or see with my own eyes from time to time, she's completely the same person. Completely unchanged, giving only brief gimpses of hope that she's finally changing, before she inevitably shows her old colors again. Thankfully not to me this time.

A year after our ""breakup"" she also found herself a ""proper"" boyfriend who I at first hated, and he strongly disliked me as well due to her not so pleasant stories about me which were not necessarily always true, but funnily enough her boyfriend and I somehow ended up becoming the bestest of friends, even *before* she ended up screwing him over in *the exact same way* as she did me, because we were just having too many common interests and personality traits with one another to dislike each other for too long. We even lived together as roommates for a year some time later.

She's now on her third boyfriend, and they at least on the surface appear to get along well and have been together for a while now. Probably the longest out of us three. Though it is concerning how low-key they're keeping that relationship, a lot of people in a very small community don't know anything about it, despite them being together for about 2 years now, and it reminds me of the exact same thing happening to me back then. I also continue seeing her fondling multiple men who aren't her boyfriend when he's not around. I honestly wish that guy the best. Both I and her second boyfriend have warned him in advance when she first started coming on to him. He made his choice.

So now we're finally back to the present. I have gotten over *her*, but I haven't gotten over what happened during that one year, nor its aftermath. I am left with severe trust issues, basically no self esteem to speak of. Like I mentioned previously, I became a very bitter and cynical man, I have trouble feeling empathy anymore, I'm incapable of loving anyone both platonically and romantically, in fact, the more interest or affection any person shows me, the more indifference I show in return. I realize that very quickly after the fact, but I can't control it. I also just don't care about anything anymore, I feel no shame anymore, I constantly make an ass of myself. And I hate all that. I hate my current self. And because of that, I drink more and more. I'm pretty much an alcoholic now, I get blackout drunk every second or third time I go out drinking, I can never stop after just one drink, because it's almost the only thing that makes me think less about everything. It's affecting my friendships, it's affecting my finances, and it's really affecting my health. 

Before I met her, I used to be the complete opposite of the person I am today. People described me as very kind, empathetic, and always very helpful, even to my own detriment. My friends even used to tell me to learn to say no to people. I was happy and I had my life together. Now some good friends have become distant friends, and some are saying the very same thing - that they don't understand how I changed that much for the worse, and hope that I will turn my life around.

Throughout the years I tried seeing psychologists, but none of them seemed to work for me, and I don't have the money to keep trying new ones. Maybe the best thing about seeing them was the fact that I realized that I feel slightly better when I say out loud what's usually constantly tormenting me locked inside my own head, and I suppose I'm doing that right now. Writing all this has been very therapeutic for me.

I also tried to give dating a chance again in 2022. It was a different girl from our study program, and she was the one that initiated everything. I just sort of let it happen hoping that over time I might actually feel something for her, or at least fix myself somehow, but that moment never came. I didn't love her, I wasn't attracted to her and at the tail end of that relationship I even felt annoyed by her. It honestly feels as if sometimes I feel asexual. We lasted for only a little over a month and a half. We broke up because I couldn't show the affection that she expected of me, and our sex life was almost non existent, because I wasn't even a little bit attracted to her. I have not been with anyone else since then, other than a few short one night flings, some of which could have had potential to become something more, but the moment I would even think of a relationship I would feel physically ill and chicken out of it. I have not even made a single attempt to overcome that feeling. There's just no point.

TLDR: got into a really good relationship with a girl for about a year during which nothing bad happened. Eventually caught that girl cheating. The girl said it's not cheating, but her way of expressing her ""friendliness"". Found out this girl has been fucking around with literally all of her male friends the entire year we were together. Then found out we weren't even ""together"" in the first place, and I was just her ""most precious friend"" because I technically never asked this girl to be my gf, despite spending almost an entire year together, sleeping together, talking about future family plans, being introduced to her entire family, and doing every other imaginable thing together. Then the girl begs me not to leave her and promises to chsnge her ways for me. Broke up with her anyway. Then I started going crazy and missing that girl hard. In a moment of weakness I got into contact with that girl again, but things were never the same and she started gaslighting me and our whole extended community that the whole thing we had together was all in my head the entire time and that nothing had ever happened. Then I  became a bitter, cynical chain smoking alcoholic incapable of loving or trusting anyone anymore despite geting over the girl herself years ago.",3,1758231640.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,1.0,False

After 6 months of unemployment, I had to accept an in-office role out of necessity.


My day looks like this:

🚇 1.5 hour commute (bus + train) just to get to the office.

☕ By 10am, people go for coffee + smoke break + chit-chat → back at desks ~10:45.

🍽️ From 11am–2pm, everyone takes staggered “lunch breaks,” errands, gym sessions, long talks → most are actually back at their desks only by 2:30 or even 3.

👶 Parents leave early for school pickups.

☕ Another “coffee break” around 3:30.

🗣️ By 4–5pm it’s all small talk + preparing to leave.

🚇 Another 1.5 hours travel to home → reach ~7pm, totally drained.


The reality:

Barely any real work gets done.

Boss micromanages as if we’re in school (“Where are you going?” when I step out for the washroom 🤦).

I feel my time, energy, and potential are being wasted.

Productivity is invisible, family time gone, hobbies gone, health slipping.


Comparison to remote work:

At home, I could do gym, cook, walk the dog, and still overdeliver at work.

Got promoted, won employee awards, and genuinely enjoyed life.

Had time for hobbies (swimming, tennis, painting) + quality family time.

Remote = fulfillment, balance, and growth.

Office = exhaustion, disappointment, and no life outside work.


I know the job market is tough (still hunting for a remote or at least hybrid role, or something closer). But honestly, this in-office setup feels like a soul-crushing waste of life.

Sorry for the rant - just needed to vent. If you’re working remote, cherish it. 🌱",60,1758231575.0,remotework,17,0.95,False
1nkl7u2,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1nkl7u2/finding_it_impossible_to_work_from_home/,Finding it IMPOSSIBLE to work from home,"Hello. I've been REALLY struggling getting any work done ever since I've switched from working at libraries, universities, and coffee shops - to working from home. I'm an animator, and the main reason I'm switching to working at home is because I upgraded from laptop to PC for my animation work (PC is faster + more efficient).

There are SO many distractions at home. Today, for instance - I literally spent about 5 hours ""taking care"" of my bonsai tree during the time I should have spent working. Yesterday, I walked my dog for a couple hours while I should've been working. Other days, I'll waste time doing things like watching tv/videos, cleaning, or just laying on my bed doing nothing but scrolling on my phone. Since my ""office"" is in my room, it's easy for me to tell myself I'll take only a 5 minute break on my phone lying in bed - only for that 5 minutes to turn into hours of wasted time.

Working at home causes me to take my sweet time with EVERYTHING! Making/eating breakfast, walking my dog, simply getting up in the morning, etc. I feel no sense or urgency or pressure to get things done quickly - probably because I'm already in my comfortable home. It's incredibly hard for me to even wake up on time and start working at the designated time I tell myself (8am-4pm). I also feel less energy ever since I stopped going out of the house to work. Another thing that bugs me is how isolating/lonely working from home can feel. I also should mention I have ADHD, which only amplifies all of these problems.

I need serious help guys - before this starts affecting my career!! Any advice you have is greatly appreciated. Thanks.",4,1758231556.0,productivity,3,0.83,False
1nkl7lf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nkl7lf,Share Breedings You Are Excited About And Why.,"It doesn’t matter if it’s just a plan or if they’re on the ground already. Doesn’t matter if you’re doing the breeding yourself, just admire the thought behind the dogs in the pedigree, or if you’re just an excited soon to be puppy buyer.

I’ll go first, unfortunately my plans fell through again for the first stud I wanted to take her two, but fortunately I did have a back up choice, and had already made contact with Girmo’s owner. Honestly, I would have paired them up in her next litter, so it just switched around the orders. I will be sending a female to a friend to hopefully work and add to his program since my guys lack a lot of the popular lines that have saturated my state. The others are bite sport homes, or active pet homes that want to dabble in sports for fun. 

In general, with Edge I want to increase the length of croup, add a bit more rear angulation, bone, darken eye color, and try to fix the eye shape. There’s a chance I might get some larger pups, my bitchlines have in the past have occasionally produced some oversized, legitimately 100lb dogs and over 26 inches at the shoulder.  

Edge her self falls smack dab in the middle height wise, but she does have substance is a bit over the desired weight limit. Temperament wise, Edge has a lower threshold for prey drive activation, and aggression in bite work. She has naturally full hard grips, and is naturally talented in tracking. She is also very territorial not crazy, but you’re not rolling up in my yard without one of the residential humans letting you in. Once you’re invited and outside the yard she is stupidly social, dog friendly, is neutral/friendly to livestock, but I haven’t tested her herding instincts yet as getting her SV compliant is the highest priority. Both her sure and dam have shown great herding instincts.

Girmo brings a much higher threshold for drive activation and a thicker nerve base overall. He does compliment want I want to improve, though that is a terrible stack, but the only one I could fine of him. He has a big motor for obedience, natural tracking skills, and a love for protection work you would normally find in these lines. He’s social with people, loves kids, good with non-asshole dogs, and is neutral to livestock but he hasn’t been tested.

This breeding is sort of a way for me to increase the influence of my bitchlines, bringing in a different path to Manto, while maintaining the traits that make me adore that bloodline. I’m hoping with fingers crossed we get what I think we’ll get with this litter. I’d love to raise up my first stud dog for competition, it would also be a nice chance to add some diversity to the local stud dogs. There’s been some major popular sire issues for a while locally.  

So, finger’s crossed! She was at a great place in her heat, 48ish house post ovulation, so I’m excited. This is also her first litter, and the first third generation breeding to carry my kennel name. And I’m hoping she produces better than her mother. I have another granddaughter of my foundation girl, but she was bred under my mentor’s program, so carries their kennel name, same bitchline though.

Not perfect, but solid side money. I’ve got a full-time job anyway, so I was just happy doing tasks when they popped up.

Two of my friends kept begging me to join because they were making good money, so I finally did in May. And then… boom — the drought started 🌵.

I passed an assessment for a project paying $28 per task (dream, right?), only for it to get closed for Egypt right after. Nice. Then there’s Cypher evals — three times now, the tasks show up *exactly* when I log in for work, and vanish the second my shift ends. Perfect timing, universe.

And then, when the rate was adjusted from $7.5 to $15? Not a single task for four days. (Okay, there *were* some on Wednesday, but of course they dropped at 10 AM and ended at 3 PM… while I was at work. Naturally.)

  
Oh, and the best part? I literally took a whole day off to wait for tasks… the site stayed empty all day. Next morning, I’m at work, chilling with a 15-minute coffee break, I check the site and boom — that glowing “Start Task” button finally appears. The task takes 20 minutes, I had 15, and unlucky me… I *am* the teacher, so skipping class wasn’t really an option 🤦‍♂️.

😞""I'd rather kiss a pig than her,"" the billionaire's son humiliated me in front of everyone when I was 16...🥹💔
CHAPTER 1: FIRST HEARTBREAK

I wonder how much trouble I’ll get into if I pour scalding coffee all over Professor Lincoln or stab the hand he’s running down my arm with a fork.

I grimace, hoping it passes off as a polite smile as I pull my arm away from his. “I understand, Professor; I’ll get the papers to you on Monday, I promise.”

Elias Lincoln, my Fundamentals of Genetics Professor and the biggest sleazebag to walk the planet, leers at me, his mud-colored eyes raking my body in a way that makes me shiver with disgust. 

“You know, April,” he says huskily, “as my TA, I expect more from you.”

I swallow, turning back to the coffee order I’m preparing. Fridays are always busy at Rover, the local campus café. The last thing I need is my perverted Professor trying to petition me at my second job by using my first job as an excuse.

“I understand, Professor,” I answer, trying to concentrate on drawing the leaf art on the latte I’ve made. “I’ve been a little busy, but I’ll come through.”

“You know you’re also failing my class, right, April?”

I sigh. “I’ll come through, Professor,” I repeat.

“You know, if being a Teaching Assistant is too much work, there are…other things you can do for the pay.” My hand jerks when he reaches for me again and runs a finger up my arm. I hiss as some coffee spills over, scalding my hand.

I glance over at Mindy, my manager. Our eyes meet briefly, and I know she sees the pleading in mine, but she looks away, ignoring the fact that I’m being harassed right under her nose.

“That’s okay,” I grit out as I set about making a fresh cup.

“I could also tutor you?” His hand trails further up my arm, and I freeze when he brushes it against my boob. “Privately, of course.”

“If you’re done with your coffee, Professor,” I grit out, taking a deliberate step back, “we’re kind of busy today.”

The scumbag smirks. “Three days.”

“What?”

“If you don’t agree to my private tutoring in three days, I’ll have to find another TA.”

I gape, feeling equal parts terrified and angry. “You’ll fire me because I won’t sleep with you?” I ask incredulously.

He shakes his head. “Why do you have to make it sound so vulgar?”

“Because that’s what it is,” I hiss. 

“I need this job, Professor.” My tone turns pleading. “My sister has pediatric type 1 diabetes and I’m her guardian, we have no insurance and her care is so expensive, I—”

“All I’m hearing is you could use the extra tutoring.” He stands and smirks. “Three days, April.”

And then he’s gone.

I stare at the glass door in utter disbelief, feeling like I’m going to drown—under the weight of his proposal, the consequences if I refuse. The absolute shit storm my life is in.

If I lose the TA job, I won’t be able to afford June’s medications, half of the rent, or next semester’s tuition.

A tear slides down my face, dropping into the coffee cup in my hand with a tiny splash.

***

“Hi, Lou,” I greet when I arrive at my apartment in the evening.

My roommate, Louise, turns to me from her perch on the couch. “April!” She mutes the TV and bounds over to me to give me a hug.

“Hi,” I sigh against her, feeling the weight of the day threaten to drag me down.

“April…” She pulls away slightly, and her sharp blue eyes study me, no doubt noting my red-rimmed eyes and the eye bags underneath. “You good?”

I shrug, dropping the grocery bags on the counter.

“Where’s June?”

“Sleeping,” Louise answers.

I glance at my watch. “Has she—”

“Gotten her insulin shot and had a chicken sandwich for dinner—whole wheat bread.”

I give my roommate a tired smile. “You’re a godsend, Lou; I don’t know what I would do without you.”

She shrugs. “Anything I can to help. You run yourself ragged, April.”

I sigh, unpacking the groceries. “I’m all she has.”

“April—”

“If I don’t work hard, if I don’t get money for her medication and something happens to her—” I take in a shuddering breath as an image flashes through my mind. Of my parents—lying dead on the floor after overdosing together on heroin.

I shake my head, forcing the memory away.

“I can’t lose her, too.”

Louise sighs, taking the box of cereal from my hand. “What about yourself?” she asks, moving for the cupboard. “You entered school on an academic scholarship and now you’re barely scraping C’s because you’re too exhausted and burnt out. You’d be off your scholarship if not for your TA job and—”

“Professor Lincoln wants to fuck me.”

Louise pauses. “What?” 

I shrug helplessly, feeling tears form in my eyes. “If I don’t agree in three days, I’ll lose the job.”

“Oh, April,” she sighs and pulls me into her embrace, stroking my back lovingly. “You poor thing.”

I sniff, resting my chin in the crook of her neck. “I’m so tired, Lou,” I whisper. 

I’m glad June is asleep. I always have to be brave for my little sister. If she ever knew what a mess I really am… 

She can’t handle losing the last parental figure in her life.

“Let’s report him to Student Affairs,” Louise says.

I scoff. “I have no proof; it’ll be my word against hi—”

I freeze, my gaze zeroing in on the TV behind Louise.

“What?” she asks as she pulls back.

I stare at the TV—at the interview going on. A man and a woman in their fifties, with three boys in their twenties standing behind them, smiling at the camera politely.

“Lou,” I whisper. “Volume.”

“What?”

“Volume,” I insist, staring at the boy in the middle.

Short dark curls, wickedly intelligent green eyes, sinfully luscious mouth. A face carved by the gods themselves. 

*“This is a joke, right?” Cruel mocking laughter. “Me, kiss you? I’d rather eat shit.”*

*More laughter, cruel and mocking—and the sound of my young, teenage heart shattering.*

Louise finds the remote, and soon, sound fills the room.

“…and there you have it,” the reporter is saying. “Ladies, it’s your chance to participate in a real-life version of The Bachelor. The Ashfords are accepting applications for brides for their three eligible sons—Lucas, Peter, and Nathan. The three heirs must find suitable wives to enable them to move forward and start a new generation of Ashford leadership.”

I swallow hard. Nathan Ashford. My high school crush—no, crush is too small a word.

My first love.

And my first heartbreak.

The thing is, almost 2 months back I asked a girl from my coaching for coffee but she gave a vague response and I took it as a no. From past few days my friends have been asking me to ask her out again on text. I did that. Very formally. 
""Hi xyz, hope you’re doing well! Abc this side. Got your contact from the common group.  Remember  I had asked you for coffee once but then didn’t follow up. I kinda got awkward. Anyway, I thought I’d say hello properly this time instead of staying quiet. If you’re up for it, would you like to grab that coffee sometime? If not, totally fine.""
She replied ""Hi Abc, thanks for asking. Coffee’s not really my thing, but appreciate you reaching out. Happy to stay in touch here.""
To me it's a polite no.
But literally all of my friends who are in the batch are saying this is a very clear signal.

Their pont is: I asked her out the second day of our interaction without any considerable interaction or conversation then also she didn't say a clear no. After that I didn't follow up when she returned and neither greeted her with a basic hi/hello for literally 2 months and suddenly out of blue I am texting her this. Then also she replied to you politely and she never closed the door by adding happy to connect here. By leaving a door open as I never offered that. They say cannot say yes as she is afraid what I might think of her.

I genuinely feel she did this to not make me feel bas moreover it's also sounding AI written. They're all asking me to start initiating conversations with her. The point is, they're all boys and I am also a boy. Can the kind ladies of this subreddit please help me 🙃. I feel this is a no and if it's not a no then it's too mixed vibe.

They turned the volume up and handed out earplugs.  
We traded outrage for soothing syrup and called it peace.  
I’m here to scream back.

>**\[Hook\]**  
Scream louder — wake the dead in their feeds,  
Break the scroll that sells your needs.  
They’ll calm your mind so your mouth stays closed —  
I’m the noise you can’t dispose.

>**\[Verse 1\]**  
You swallow soft pills for a hard world, belly full of trending lies,  
weak-minded worship the bandage, not the wound they sterilize.  
We got a culture built on comfort, a worship of the instantaneous,  
mashed-up morals on autoplay — empathy reduced to ratings.  
You beg for ease and they build you the tranquilizer app,  
a lullaby in code — dopamine on tap.  
Don’t mistake anesthetic for care; a comfortable slave still lives in chains.  
We stitch our conscience with excuses while the real thieves reframe the game.

>Two teams on a stage — red vs blue in permanent fight,  
while the ringmaster sells the seats and writes the script at night.  
They bicker like children while the house gets bought by the few,  
you shout about freedom while your feed is curated for you.  
This war’s a mirror trick: dopamine for attention,  
they monetize your anger, invoice you for tension.

>**\[Pre-Hook\]**  
Placate the masses with soft goods, glossy ads and virtue-slogans,  
so you’ll never ask why the roads sag under armored wagons.

>**\[Verse 2\]**  
Look: AKIRA-sized — silicon muscle, corporate bone,  
Facebook and Google — they ate the town and left the throne.  
If they can’t make it, they buy it, fold it in, swallow it whole,  
create a body made of platforms and call it progress for the soul.  
They collect shadow dossiers on your coffee and your vows,  
they track the route your loneliness takes and sell the map to crows.  
Surveillance capitalism — Zuboff wrote the ledger in plain ink,  
they auction off your patterns while democracy starts to sink.  
Black-market whispers in daylight deals, ads tuned to your fear,  
behavioral architecture, engineered to steer.  
They whisper “help” then sell the cure — data for the highest bid,  
they own the sky our conversations used to live in; now the sky is grid.

>**\[Bridge\]**  
This new gilded age: gilded for them, rust for us,  
oligarchs in suits, ethics turned to dust.  
They buy Congress, buy platforms, buy silence at a scale that stings,  
there’s no refactor in their code for what a human being means.  
This is not a bug; this is an engineered feint —  
a system built to pacify the many and enrich the quaint.  
Don’t mistake your outrage for leverage — it’s currency in their vault,  
you scream into the ledger; your voice pays someone else’s fault.

>**\[Verse 3\]**  
So I scream louder: peel the sticker off your radio, unmute your spine,  
stop trading your attention for a curated headline.  
Build a runway, not a hashtag — construct, don’t click the bait,  
refuse to be the audience that funds your own fate.  
We need bridges that are public, not platforms with private tolls,  
roads built by people’s hands — not invoices for their souls.  
Pay the tax on truth; make the monster pay for the roads it rides,  
call it theft when the commons is sold and you’re billed for the rides.  
This is cognitive warfare; weaponized convenience at scale —  
they’d rather you be quiet, docile, a walking data-sale.  
But we are not a market, we are not a product catalog to trade —  
we are the signal fire, and signal fires refuse to fade.

>**\[Final Hook\]**  
Scream louder — wake the dead in their feeds,  
Break the scroll that sells your needs.  
They’ll calm your mind so your mouth stays closed —  
I’m the noise you can’t dispose.

>**\[Outro\]**  
Call out the monster by the names it gives itself: surveillance capitalism, oligarchy, platform-monolith.  
Name the theft. Name the engine. Do not comfort the comfortable; unmask the comfortable thieves.  
If you want peace, build it — don’t buy a substitute. If you want freedom, fight for it with more than clicks.  
Scream louder. Tend the signal fire. Pass the light.

Diss Poem's Rant:

Surveillance capitalism is the engine under all this noise: a new form of market power that turns private behavior into prediction products and sells those predictions as commodities. Shoshana Zuboff calls it a systemic extraction — not just advertising, but behavioral modification at scale. A new architecture of power that feeds on attention and erodes the capacity to act freely. What feels like entertainment or convenience is actually capture. Every scroll, every location ping, every purchase becomes part of a behavioral shadow file that is bought and sold in marketplaces we can’t see. If you haven’t read it, *The Age of Surveillance Capitalism* is the operating manual for how platforms turned life itself into harvest.

The logistics angle is not a footnote; it’s the ledger. Massive delivery fleets ride on public roads paid for by taxpayers, while shareholders pocket the gains. Corporations invest billions in fleets, routing algorithms, and drone projects, but the actual asphalt, bridges, and neighborhoods are treated as free inputs. Local governments carry the wear, and the bills show up as potholes, cracked bridges, and thin school budgets. That is organized extraction in its most obvious form: private profit mapped onto public expense. This is why states are starting to experiment with delivery fees and infrastructure surcharges — because the cost of doorstep convenience is being offloaded onto communities without consent. When the trucks are armored, electric, and optimized, but the roads underneath them crumble, you see the asymmetry clearly: corporate efficiency is subsidized by civic neglect.

And the monster? Big Tech consolidated itself into a handful of architectures that now control the nervous system of modern life. They bought rivals, folded whole industries, and rewrote the terms of access. Social feeds, ad exchanges, mapping, messaging, logistics — each market was captured, monopolized, and then engineered to serve as a behavioral lever. Antitrust cases and court findings are only beginning to name this: the ad-tech lawsuits, the merger histories, the judgments that call out monopoly structures. But the truth is already visible — this isn’t just data mining, it’s an engineered environment where consent can be nudged, elections can be tilted, and consumer behavior can be tuned in real time. Convenience has become the camouflage of control.

This concentration corrodes democracy at its root. By turning attention into a tradeable commodity, by designing feeds that prize outrage and compulsive engagement, these systems industrialized persuasion. What used to be the messy public square is now a predictive ad auction. Content that divides, inflames, or hooks is rewarded; nuanced or boring truths are buried. Outrage is the currency, not deliberation. That’s how echo chambers harden, why conspiracies metastasize, and why politics feels like theater optimized for clicks rather than governance aimed at reality. When the architecture of information is itself tilted toward keeping us scrolling, shared facts and civic trust are the casualties.

The platforms don’t stop at engineering feeds; they bankroll lobbying, pour money into think tanks, and structure acquisitions so alternatives can’t survive. It isn’t just that the gatekeepers of information decide who gets heard — they also decide who gets funded, who gets throttled, and which ideas wither in obscurity. When corporate architectures can test a thousand micro-variations of a political message, amplify the ones that move people, and then sell those insights to whoever pays, democracy ceases to be a conversation among citizens. It becomes an engineered market transaction. Consent is no longer built; it’s purchased. Public life gets hollowed out from within, procedurally, until almost no one remembers that it once belonged to us.

This matters to me not as theory but as daily reality. I can feel the dial turned up on my own nervous system. I can sense the erosion of patience when I scroll, the narrowing of focus when feeds reward only quick reaction. I can see the armored trucks in my own town — the roads wearing thin, the budgets stretched, the convenience never questioned. It would be easy to name villains and leave it there. But that would be another form of consumption — outrage consumed as spectacle. The harder, truer work is to name the pattern, educate myself and others, and take steps that hold power to account where I live. That means translating “surveillance capitalism” into household language. It means showing how a pothole is connected to a package, how a drained budget is tied to fleets of vans, how a child’s attention span is being sculpted by a feedback loop designed elsewhere.

And it means gathering, however small at first. Ten neighbors in a library room is not a revolution, but it is a seed. A one-page handout that shows local delivery counts is not a lawsuit, but it is leverage. A three-minute ask at a council meeting may not change the world, but it forces accounting where there was none. If corporations treat civic life as free infrastructure to exploit, then our defense has to start with claiming the commons — roads, schools, bandwidth, and attention — as something sacred. The act of measuring, teaching, and asking for accountability is how that defense takes form.

At the same time, this has to be sustainable for me. Burnout helps no one. That’s why I pair civic acts with private rituals: candle and ledger, one page of freewriting, one act of refusal each week (unsubscribe, disable, replace). Outrage has to be metabolized into durable practice, not consumed until it poisons. Joy is not a distraction; it’s how resistance endures. If public life has been hollowed out, then tending private life with discipline and ritual is part of reclaiming the balance.

The larger point is this: convenience is not neutral. Every “frictionless” app, every instant purchase, every seamless feed hides a cost. Sometimes that cost is asphalt under a van. Sometimes it’s a child’s mind captured by outrage. Sometimes it’s a fragile democracy worn down by engineered consent. The systems thrive because they are invisible. My responsibility — and anyone’s who feels the hum — is to make them visible, local, and accountable. Not to fix it all at once, but to begin: one neighbor, one ledger, one council ask, one refusal, one ritual of renewal.

That’s how the monster is met: not with panic, but with clarity and steady practice.

Context is that I had always carried nicotine pouches (tobacco free snus) when work being busy meant i couldn’t go out for a smoke, so I was used to them and thought they were pretty good. So while I was sick, I said while I’ll use the pouches to relieve cravings as smoking cigs would make my flu worse. 

Flu went and I continued not smoking to the present day, where I’m about 4 and a half months off smoking. No relapses thus far, first time quitting. 

The hard part is, I’m not nicotine free at all (although I’ve cut down from 6mg to 2mg pouches over time) and I am so fucking sad all the time. I miss smoking a cigarette with my coffee, I miss having a cigarette with friends and I just miss that part of my daily routine so much. the nicotine pouches are fine, but I’m just feeling pretty mediocre everyday and I don’t know why.

Also, I can’t seem to point to any significant benefits of quitting smoking. I don’t taste anything better, I don’t have a better sense of smell, I don’t have more energy. In fact, I would say I feel worse overall after quitting. I’m sad all the time, I constantly want to relapse and I’m so congested every morning from smokers flu that I thought would be gone by now. 

Any words of encouragement? Is this normal? I just wish I wasn’t so melancholy all the time. I think I’m on the verge of buying a pack and saying fuck it, who cares anyway?

This is my first time doing a query and I want to make sure I’m doing it the best way I can! Thank you in advance for your help. 

Dear [Agent],

College sophomore Wilder Ashe just wants to end it all. And he would have too, if it weren’t for Willow, the spunky girl who ran into him one autumn evening, tossing his plan (and his pills) onto the university cobblestone sidewalk. 

Wilder never expected to be the monster in his own story, yet somehow the memories of his past have turned him into precisely that. He’s a portent of destruction, a bad luck charm. He’s spent a decade hiding from himself—that is, until Willow comes barreling into his life on a cold, North Carolina day. A tentative friendship between the two emerges, spurred on by accidental meetings and the stubborn, immovable for that is Willow. An unlikely mentor is found in Hazel, the wise older woman who runs a cozy cafe in their Blue Ridge Mountain town, as the maternal figure they never had takes the two broken students under her wing. 

As the year unfolds, enveloping them in a tapestry of stars and myths and music, the two burgeoning friends begin to realize they might have more in common than they think. Wilder wonders what it means to be a part of a constellation—to be important, to be known. But burning brighter (and truly belonging) means ridding himself of his oppressive secret. To Wilder, that’s impossible—until he receives a note that twists like a knife in his chest, forcing him to decide if he is willing to confront the monster inside to save his friend. 

And, as it turns out, a boy with secrets to hide and a girl who is used to running away might come away with both broken walls and fractured hearts.

I am seeking representation for THE STARS & THE GHOST THEY CREATED, my adult contemporary, complete at 96,000 words. THE STARS & THE GHOST THEY CREATED is reminiscent of the depths of mental health in Emily Austin’s EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM WILL SOMEDAY BE DEAD, with the unforgettable relationships between broken friends in Frederik Backman’s MY FRIENDS.

I am an artist and graphic designer located in [City], Texas, though I hail from the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, the setting of my novel. I wrote constantly in my youth while dealing with my own mental health issues and neurodivergence. You can usually find me running (while trying to stay out of the scorching Texas sun), playing with my two rambunctious rescue dogs, or reading in a local coffee shop. THE STARS & THE GHOST THEY CREATED is my first full-length novel. 

Thank you for taking the time to consider my work. I look forward to hearing from you. 

Warmly,

1nkkm4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/KetamineStateYoga/comments/1nkkm4w/trip_plan_a_tantric_practice_to_deal_with_anger/,TRIP PLAN: A Tantric Practice to Deal with Anger,"In three days (Sunday), I will rise early in the morning, have a glass of water, take out the dog, and prepare for my monthly deep ketamine journey.

In my many journeys over the past three years, I've ranged from clear intentions to no intentions at all. I have performed very specific yogic practices designed for the various phases of the trip -- the come-up, peak, and come-down -- and I have done absolutely nothing but sit on my cushion and watch reality fragment, whirl, and reassemble itself.

This time I have a practice I intend to carry out. A tantric method from Tibetan Dream Yoga.  In this practice, you do not deny or block or fight against *anything*. If there are negative emotions, you ""carry them onto the path."" (This distinguishes tantra from sutra, the ""path of renunciation"" where you try to ""purify"" negative emotions, which basically means getting rid of them.)

**And my focus is anger.**

*Why?* Well, there are a lot of components to the answer.

For one, I seem to have a lot of it stored deep down. This makes sense -- what kid who endured what I did growing up would grow up free of anger and frustration? So consciously I can cut myself some slack. But still I have avoided it, instead inviting my trauma-pain, the grief and sadness, held them in my strong grown-up arms. Anger, apparently, I'm less comfortable with accepting in myself.

The tantric method is all about accepting. I will try, deep within the ketamine state, to ""carry the anger onto the path.""

In the personal reflections below, I give some more reasons that have converged on this plan to work with anger in my upcoming ketamine trip.

**Trip Design**

\[NOTE: I do not suggest this method for anyone else. I have a lot of experience and still there are risks involved. In fact, if someone told me they were planning to journey this way, I would at the very least raise questions and might even try to dissuade them.\]

I mentioned this will happen in the early morning, on an empty stomach. (I might need to have tea or coffee to stave off caffeine withdrawal; in that case I'd eat a small amount.) Journeying in the morning is optimal, I have found (for me), in terms of staying focused on whatever it is, in this case ""carrying the anger onto the path,"" acknowledging its dream-like nature and letting it go with my breath...

I will take a couple of very light puffs of 5-MeO-DMT from a vaporizer. This has the effect of loosening my emotions. There is an immediate rising of awareness in the body.

Then I will put the ketamine lozenges under my tongue, all at once (which will reduce the duration of the trip but make it more intense), and breath deeply (perhaps performing Nadi Shodhana) as I hold the medicine in my mouth. I will remind myself, ""carry the anger onto the path... this is a dream..."" as the ketamine whisks me away.

At some point during the come-down I may take a few puffs from a cannabis vape. My tolerance is near zero as I have cut my usage way down. This is another reason I am anticipating this ketamine journey as I can sense the greater overall sharpness in my focus due to cutting out cannabis. But cannabis can be very useful in revealing stored emotions and helping them move and it can synergize powerfully with ketamine so I may use it lightly. (The downside is a reduction of focus and memory.)

**Personal reflections on a tantric practice**

A few weeks ago, I attended an online course on lucid dreaming taught by Chongtul Rinpoche, a Tibetan Geshe who received extensive education at Menri Monastery.

There are many approaches to lucid dreaming, and this is about as traditional as it gets. Chongtul sometimes teaches from a scroll and always delivers the ancient teachings without modification, though he is intent that the deep meaning get across to his mostly Western students.

For eight hours, he gave teachings in Tibetan Dream Yoga, from a text called the Bon Mother Tantra. (He explained that in the Father Tantra, you rely on external methods – at least this is how I remember it – whereas the Mother Tantra is concerned with your own internal resources, what is deep inside you.)

A book on Tibetan practice by another master of Dream Yoga, Tenzin Wangyal, relates the traditional idea that the various paths – Sutra, Tantra, and Dzogchen – are suitable for different levels of practitioners. I found it amusing that they are really quite blatant about it – If you aren't very spiritually keen, stick with Sutra. If you've got a knack, Tantra, and if you're one of the most gifted practitioners, you have a shot at Dzogchen. (I note that Tenzin Wangyal is a master teacher whose goal is to benefit his students, and accordingly, at the Dzogchen retreat I attended last year, he presented a Sutra approach as well that helped me make a major breakthrough.)

Chongtul read from the ancient text, **""Carry the anger onto the path.""** Not just anger, there were verses for all sorts of negative emotions, ""Carry the jealousy onto the path,"" etc.

**The Challenge of Anger**

There is no question anger has a central role in the suffering of today's human population. Of course you can see it tearing the social tapestry to shreds, and then I find it again and again at the core of my friends' and my emotional pain, the stuff we're trying to deal with in psychedelic therapy.

The Sutra approach to anger would be to acknowledge its nature as a ""poison,"" something that seizes the bodymind and leads to karmic actions that radiate the anger out into the world and back onto the person who expressed it. There are purifications you can do to spit it out of your nervous system and behaviors you can adopt to prevent it from arising in the first place.

But Dream Yoga is a tantric form. You **""carry the anger onto the path.""** Rather than working to eliminate or avoid it, you embrace it in the core understanding:

**""This is a dream.""**

All of it. Every bird, tree, building, airplane, every thought, feeling, sense impression, the whole history of the consciousness of every being since the dawn of time and from here on out: This is a dream.

*(I mentioned Dzogchen is considered the highest path and here the approach to anger would be to simply to allow it to exist along with everything else, an illusion. Words are tricky here.)*

What a challenging and beautiful approach! It is similar to mystically inflected modern methods like Jungian Therapy and Shadow Work. For me it feels deeper and more challenging.

Because there is no exception. It's not just the negative emotions you acknowledge are dream figments – ""this anger is a dream,"" ""this fear is a dream"" – but the joyful emotions too, and not just the emotions but literally everything. The Earth, Sun, multiverse. In this way, it brings constant intimacy with the absolute fact of death. Dreams are temporary and most of them are forgotten before they're even once recalled.

It's not easy to ""carry the anger onto the path!""

**Dialogue between Aspiring Dream Yogi and His Ego**

""This anger is a dream.""

""Mmm, no it's not – this time it's real.""

""But I am practicing the tantric Dream Yoga. Everything is a dream, including the anger.""

""Mmm, yeah, I know I said that and I do intend to practice. But… that guy at work was really an asshole.""

""Carry the anger onto the path.""

""Yeah, yeah. Easy for you to say when you don't have to deal with the people I work with.""

""They're dreams too.""

""Nah, you can't talk me out of the anger this time. You don't know what happened. I deserve to be angry!""

And the Ego wins this round. Once a person is saying they deserve to be angry – literally, that they deserve to have a painful state in the body, a clenching in the breath, because of somebody else's jerky behavior – it's hard to talk them down because there are so many layers of misunderstanding.

*This is why Tantra is a famously difficult path!*

**Why Tantra Is So Challenging**

Another reason a novice yogi might adhere to a Sutra approach at first: ""Bringing an emotion onto the path"" is not merely a decision in the mind, it is a full-body act. When you acknowledge the dream-like nature of something, it is not enough to say, ""This is a dream"" – there is a deep knowing that settles into the body and breath. The general form of this insight, that our bodies and breaths are involved with every thought that enters our heads, is unfamiliar to many Westerners when to a Tibetan yogi it is second nature.

There are profound benefits to this method. There is no part of you that is excised, deemed unacceptable. Everything comes onto the path. The anger isn't the problem. The shame, the jealousy, the desire, not problems. If you attach to them, identify with them, then they'll build up a lot of pain. And it's much easier not to attach to something if you truly believe it's a dream.

**A Teaching on Dreams Within Dreams**

A few years ago, at a retreat on the Nine Purification Breaths, I described a harrowing lucid-dream experience to Tenzin Wangyal.

""I realized I was dreaming. I'm having a lucid dream! I was elated. The dream ended too quickly and I awoke in my bed. But then I realized… This is a false awakening, I'm still dreaming! I was so happy to still be having a lucid dream. Then I woke up again, and again realized I was in a dream. …And then I was filled with terror.""

Of course I was. Because at that point, I wondered, **""Will I ever wake up?""**

Tenzin Wangyal replied with a smile, ""It's what you think isn't a dream that cause the suffering.""

""Will I ever wake up?""

""When you realize it's all a dream.""

What a strange and wonderful teaching. Bring everything into the dream and that's how you become Awake!

I’m 19, based around Raleigh, and open to making connections with anyone who feels like we might vibe. A bit about me: I’m a student who splits her time between studying, going for walks around the city, and spending way too long making playlists I never finish. I really love cooking simple recipes (even if they don’t always turn out perfect lol), reading books that make me think, and doing yoga when I need to clear my head. I’m the type of person who notices small things like sunsets after rain or the smell of coffee in the morning and I love talking about those “little joys” in life. I wouldn’t say I’m the loudest person in the room at first, but once I get comfortable I tend to be chatty and love laughing about random things. I value kindness, honesty, and people who are curious about the world. If you’re the kind of person who enjoys deep conversations as much as silly jokes, we’ll probably get along well. What I’m looking for: honestly, just genuine connections. Could be friendship, could be something more over time, but mostly I want to meet people who bring good energy and are open-minded.

I have a potato stand, In eyesight of where they usually walk past, to get to the cash register, it is the first item they see on that patch of items, it is in magnificent shelfs (5/5) +2 for display, so it should be the most appealing place to get potato.
But!
I have one small extra space of potato, tucked away in a corner they usually don't walk in, no potato easy in sight, In a normal appealing shelf (2/5) and no extra for display. (I have it since I had extra shelfs and extra space, so I just randomly put it there to make my store look big) 
But the customers have NEVER bought a potato from the 2 top most appealing stands 🤣 they walk right past it. And if someone buys potato, it's always from the hidden bottom one. 
I am curious to know if anybody knows how their minds work? 

Another thought: I have a bit of a restrictive path, but not too much, and I try to keep one option on each side of the shelfs in the restrictive zones so they don't need to go back around. But many do. And there are also alot of them that get angry out of now here. I have my shelves stocked, I have coffee in place, I have the items available, and many come in and leave Long before closing time. So I don't get WHY they get angry?

about 2 and a half weeks ago i started getting sharp stabbing pains in my upper left abdomen that happened randomly.  It eventually progressed into a band of pressure if my lower back above my hip, and even tenderness around there.  

The sharp pains keep happening but now i can feel them from the back abdomen and rarely the sides and the pressure is wore than ever.  As of two days ago i lost my appetite and started to get some nausea.  I noticed that with certain oily foods the sharp pains happen more and my stomach feels very acidic/fiery.  I had some coffee a week ago and it felt like my whole abdomen was on fire.  

My medical history

* ct scan abdomen done in april 2024. Colonoscopy and endoscopy done. Found ulcer and benign polyps. Polyps removed, ulcer treated. Scan Negative.
* ultrasound abdomen done in january 2025 due to abdominal pain in right side. Found small gallstone, but likely not the culprit as pain subsided.
* ct scan end of april 2025 of abdomen chest and pelvis. All negative. Recurrence of sibo symptoms briefly as i had this in the past.
* recent bloods and lipase etc all good

Do i have concerns of pancreatic cancer with my symptoms?  Do my ct scans of the abdomen from april of this year and last year rule me out of pan cancer?

1nkk8dc,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewedAppliances/comments/1nkk8dc/should_you_try_the_best_singleserve_brewer/,Should You Try the Best Single-Serve Brewer Nespresso Vertuo Next,"Testing out the Nespresso ENV120BCA Vertuo Next was an adventure that blended both convenience and style into my daily caffeine fix. As someone who depends on coffee to kickstart mornings, diving into the capabilities of this sleek espresso machine was almost too exciting. From unboxing the machine, which flaunted a classy black and rose gold design, to brewing my first cup, there was a lingering anticipation of whether it could become my new morning companion. The machine didn’t just fit perfectly on my counter; it brought a sense of modern sophistication to my kitchen.

**Design and Build**  
The first thing that caught my attention was how compact and stylish this coffee maker is. Measuring just 15.08 inches in depth and 5.59 inches in width, it’s easy to tuck away on smaller kitchen counters or coffee nooks. The splash of rose gold on the predominantly black machine added an aesthetically pleasing touch that my home definitely benefited from. It’s not just eye candy; this coffee maker is thoughtfully constructed, too. Made from 50% recycled plastics, that attention to sustainability took it a notch higher for me. However, at 13.85 pounds, I wouldn’t exactly call it lightweight if you plan to move it frequently.  

**Ease of Use**  
Operating this coffee machine was a breeze, even for someone like me who struggles with technology before the second cup of coffee. A single button is all it takes to brew your favorite cup size, and the machine reads the integrated code in each coffee capsule to adjust settings—tech magic at play! From a dense Ristretto to a shareable Carafe format, there are seven coffee size options to choose from. This makes the machine versatile enough to cater to different moods and caffeine needs throughout the day. It’s an ultra-friendly setup, which even my tech-averse partner managed to use without any hand-holding from me.

**Technology and Features**  
One of the highlights I noticed while testing the Nespresso Vertuo Next was its smart connectivity. Thanks to Bluetooth and Wi-Fi capabilities, the machine updates itself automatically, ensuring that the brewing system is always fine-tuned for optimum coffee extraction. Though setting up the connectivity could have been slightly quicker (and I’m not the most patient person), the promise of constantly improving performance was worth the effort. Adding to the experience, the capsule ejection is automatic, so no messy cleanup sessions are needed, a massive plus in mornings when time runs away from you.  

**Plus Points**  
- Seven coffee size options, including Carafe Pour-Over Style  
- Sleek modern design with rose gold accents  
- Made from 50% recycled plastics, boosting sustainability  
- Simple and intuitive one-button operation  
- Automatic software updates ensure peak performance  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Dependency on Nespresso Vertuo capsules means less flexibility for other coffee brands.  
- Priced higher than traditional coffee makers with additional cost per capsule.  
- Connectivity setup, while innovative, could feel gimmicky to users who prefer simplicity.  

**Performance and Outcome**  
Performance is where this machine strongly stands out. Every cup I brewed had beautifully balanced aromas, smooth crema, and the kind of richness that makes you forget about overpriced café coffees. Whether it was a quick single serving in the morning or a larger cup for winding down in the evening, the machine adapted effortlessly. The first time I used the Double Espresso function, it felt like my personal barista had just whipped up a masterpiece for me. Yet, despite the amazing results, the price of capsules did make me pause—it adds up if you’re an everyday drinker like me.  

**Competitive Options**  
Looking at alternatives, I compared the Vertuo Next to the Keurig K-Cafe and the Breville Bambino. The Keurig offers decent versatility at lower costs and doesn’t require proprietary capsules. Still, the crema and layered richness from the Vertuo absolutely outshine the Keurig’s results. The Breville Bambino, although equally aesthetic, demands hands-on brewing knowledge and isn’t as beginner-friendly. For those who prize ease and style, the Vertuo stands apart. However, budget-conscious coffee lovers may still gravitate towards its competitors.  

**True Value**  
Is it worth the splurge? The answer depends on what you value most in a coffee machine. For those who appreciate high-end finishes, cutting-edge tech like smart updates, and perfect brews with every cup, the investment feels justified. However, if the proprietary capsules feel restrictive or you’re seeking a budget machine, you might hesitate. Personally, I found the sustainability factor and overall user experience to be worth the price, though I’d admit I’m hoping for more affordable capsule options in the future.

As the coffee in my coffee isn't good enough anymore, I would transfer my current home grinder, the 1zpresso JX Pro, to the office and need a replacement after almost 4 years.

The budget doesn't really matter, I want something that makes a delicious cup of mostly light to medium roasts in my Chemex or V60. 

I've looked at the Pietro, but the suboptimal ergonomics are a no-go, therefore, the three options above. 

The biggest con for me regarding the C40 is the plastic catch cup. It's a high-end device, my use plastic? 

I'm honestly torn between the K Ultra and ZP6, I guess there isn't an obvious answer. K Ultra seems to be a bit more versatile, but it is also more expensive.

1nkk86x,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthMomentum/comments/1nkk86x/could_binbata_laundry_detergent_be_the_best/,Could Binbata Laundry Detergent Be the Best Eco-Friendly Choice? Full Review,"Testing out the Binbata B0BZ449P9G Laundry Detergent Sheets has been quite a fascinating experience. As someone who does laundry almost daily (yes, life with kids makes that mandatory!), I was curious about these laundry strips that claim to be eco-friendly, unscented, biodegradable, and kind to sensitive skin. Were they just a gimmick, or would they actually live up to the hype? Spoiler alert: they mostly delivered, though there are a few quirks to keep in mind.

**Compact Yet Mighty Design**

Opening the box for these little strips was a game-changer. They’re incredibly compact compared to traditional liquid or powder detergents. No huge plastic jugs cluttering my laundry area anymore! I appreciate how lightweight and small they are, which makes them perfect for saving storage space. The strips are thick enough to hold together during handling but dissolve quickly once in water. The polymer concentration technology seems to pack an excellent punch, tackling everything from coffee to sweat stains without breaking a sweat of their own. With all ingredients being free of harsh chemicals, I feel reassured when washing delicate fabrics. 

[Check Binbata B0BZ449P9G price on Amazon.](https://healthquay.com/p/b0bz449p9g/)

**Eco-Friendly Packaging**

We’ve all seen the staggering amounts of plastic waste caused by conventional laundry detergents. These strips, however, come in plastic-free, recyclable packaging. I love how this approach reduces carbon emissions and fuel consumption significantly during transportation. It feels good knowing that while I’m cleaning my family’s clothes, I’m not contributing as much to global warming. This aspect alone puts the detergent miles ahead of many alternatives cluttering store shelves.

**Safe for Sensitive Skin**

My youngest child has mild eczema, so I always tread carefully when choosing detergents. The Binbata strips ditch phosphates, bleach, and fluorescent agents, relying instead on natural plant-based ingredients like coconut oil and sapindus mukurossi. I was skeptical initially, but after multiple loads, it was clear that the strips delivered on their promise of being hypoallergenic. No itching, no redness—just fresh, clean clothes. I don’t miss the artificial fragrances either. In fact, the completely fragrance-free formula works wonders for those who avoid strong scents, though some might miss the “fresh laundry smell"" typical of traditional detergents.

**Ease of Use**

Those mornings when I’m rushing to get two kids ready for school and smash out some laundry, I now find these strips incredibly convenient. Just toss one in with the load, and you’re good to go. There’s no mess like with liquid detergents and no accidental “oops, I dumped in too much” moments. Dissolution in the wash is quick, and I’ve experienced no residue issues. A blend of anionic and non-ionic surfactants ensures the strips dissolve effectively in cold, hot, hard, or soft water—although I recommend giving your load a quick double take, especially on larger washes, to ensure every strip has dissolved completely.

**Positives:**

- Lightweight and compact, saving storage space.
- Hypoallergenic, plant-based formula suitable for sensitive skin.
- Zero-waste, biodegradable packaging aligns with eco-conscious values.
- Convenient and mess-free to use.
- Effective stain removal performance.

**Negatives:**

- Unscented formula might not satisfy everyone’s need for a “fresh laundry” scent.
- On larger or heavily soiled loads, I sometimes found myself wishing for a booster product.

**Competing Brands**

Comparing the product to liquid detergents, these strips win hands down in terms of portability and environmental impact. Traditional brands require those huge clunky plastic containers and often contain synthetic fragrances or skin irritants, which this product completely sidesteps. However, some competitors in the eco-friendly laundry world—like Tru Earth and Earth Breeze—offer similar items that dissolve comparably well but include a few scented options for those who prefer them. One area where the Binbata laundry detergent stands out is its thicker sheet design, which feels sturdier than some rival brands’ offerings. Yet in terms of variety, other brands slightly outshine Binbata with their availability of more scent choices.

**Price to Quality Ratio**

Speaking candidly, it’s always a debate in my head: Does an eco-friendly product justify a higher investment? With this laundry detergent, the answer is dependent on values. If you’re the kind of person who prioritizes sustainability and family safety over rock-bottom prices, then these sheets deliver decent value. They may not be the cheapest option, but considering the convenience, skin safety, and reduced carbon footprint, I found the purchase justifiable for my household. Economically, the ""200 count"" packaging ensures decent longevity, so you’re not running out every other week.

We had been waiting about 20 minutes. Three people walked in. It was an older woman and what appeared to be her son and maybe his wife. They sat down.  They were talking at a normal volume, a loud normal, as if they were in a coffee shop or at home.  Ok. So they have a different social norm from me where you always talk loud in every social setting. There were four or five other couples waiting. All of which spoke in a respectful lowered volume, seemingly understanding that other people in the room are waiting to have surgery or waiting on people who are in surgery...whom all could possibly die in the coming hours.  I assumed all the other couples were just as anxious as I was, waiting to see if they will ever see their loved one again. I could be wrong, maybe it is just me who gets nervous when being intubated and being cut on by a guy in a green costume.

Anyway, these three people continued to talk and laugh as if they were sitting at their dining room table or getting a burger at a fast-food joint.  No problem. They do them, I'll do me.

Then the son pulled out his cell phone and conferenced in the rest of the family.  So now we have about six or seven people talking as if it were an Easter egg hunt.  He turned up the phone volume all the way so Mom could hear everyone, as they wished her success in her upcoming journey.  It seemed to be a joyous family event unfolding right next to us.

Unfortunately, I was not happy to be part of their fun adventure as my, and my girlfriend's mind, body, and spirit, tried to control all the horrible thoughts of the possible terrible outcomes we were about to face.

I know...""that was their way of handling the stress"". Then please, take it into the hallway. I think, at the very least, show some curtesy for others in such a place and an acknowledgement that for other people this might not be a time to celebrate publicly.

What would you do?

After Covid in 2022, I started dealing with constipation that never really went away. To manage it, I’ve been using morning coffee.

A couple of months ago, I started noticing a tinge of blood in my saliva. At first I thought it was dental-related (I get regular check-ups and even had a cleaning), but the blood continued. Sometimes it seemed linked to walking/exercise, other times to dry mouth. Around the same time, I also had a burning feeling in my throat, but didn’t think much of it.

In late July, I went to the doctor. He started me on omeprazole and sent me for a chest X-ray. A few days later, one evening after eating spicy food, I spat out about a teaspoon of blood — which really alarmed me. I went to A&E, but they didn’t find anything. An online consultant suggested acid-related irritation.

The next day, I saw my GP (just before travelling abroad). He told me to continue omeprazole, said the chest X-ray wasn’t back yet, but reassured me not to worry. We ended up cutting the holiday short after 2 days and came back. The X-ray later came back clear.

I was urgently referred to ENT: the exam was clear apart from some redness. Because of my past smoking history (quit a few years ago), they suggested an MRI, which I’ve done and am awaiting results.

I also had an upper endoscopy that I’d already been waiting for — this too was clear. The consultant told me to stop omeprazole.

Since then, I’ve been taking Gaviscon Advanced nightly, and the frequency of blood in my spit definitely reduced. But in the last 2 weeks, I’ve started to notice it again. Nothing else has changed. It’s always just a tinge — not a lot — but still very concerning every time.

The throat burning is intense at times — it honestly feels like spikes being dragged down my throat. Oddly, it sometimes improves with eating, but tea and warm drinks seem to make it worse. From what I’ve read online, pepsin might be involved. Sometimes I even wake up in the morning, having eaten nothing, and still get the burning.

Has anyone else experienced blood-tinged saliva with LPR/acid reflux? I’ve struggled to find much online where others describe this.

Please any help or advice if mush appreciated.

How did idea for pranks and jokes and presents came through their head. They said I was important to them. I couldn't exactly comprehend how, why or how much. They were now just accepted into their dream university too. It's far away, and I hoped they got accepted into a closer one. All I felt was numbness. I took a cup of coffee, but I head to fight my head the whole time trying not to disappear. I think they noticed. One part of me hopes so, but I don't think I would explain how I feel to them.


My brother did the same. I'm not happy for him. He never expressed the will to move out, yet he did. I'm the one stuck at home. He doesn't even really know me. I am trans and closeted, and he's into the alt right. I was hoping for him to go away so I could come out to my mother.

I have no community. I don't have anyone. Even the ones I call friends are just strangers I can talk with.

My family doesn't have a lot of money. Maybe I could move out, but right now I don't think I will soon. All I can see why is how messed up I am. I could have moved out. I could have spent my money more wisely. I could have been abroad a few times. But I didn't. I am lazy. But I don't think it's just that. Maybe someone should have believed in me. That I can move out. That I can go to India to see the temples (my life dream). And if I tried and failed, it would have just been part of life. But they never ever suggested me to try.

But it's not their fault. I know I shouldn't be doing this and should be better. But I can't. Not now. Now I just wish to rest from my empty existence.",2,1758228942.0,self,2,1.0,False

He’s home with me while his older brother is in school, and I try to take him somewhere every day-coffee shops, restaurants, kids museums, parks, trails, stores, and friends houses. But wherever we go, it’s a struggle.

In parking lots, I let him decide to hold my hand or be carried for safety, but he just screams the whole time. At restaurants or coffee shops, he won’t sit still. If I ask him to stay in his chair, he screams because he wants to run around. In the store, he screams if I put him in the cart, but if I let him walk, he runs off. Even when I give him the decision to either hold onto the cart or sit in it, he refuses to listen.

It’s the same at home. It makes me sad, because I really want to take him places and do fun things, but it gets so overwhelming for me that I usually end up leaving early. My 4 year old is so easy to take anywhere, even when he was 2, but my younger one is a completely different story.

I guess I’m just venting. I know 2 and 3 is a rough age, but I didn’t realize it would be so much harder with second child energy.",0,1758228868.0,Parenting,12,0.5,False

*loud and continuous knocking at the door, followed by a deep and gentle* ""Hello?..""
.
(What the fuck...) I thought to myself. 
. 
No one should be out here. Rich told me during our conversation at the station, that nobody is allowed in the area besides staff because of the fire near by. But maybe it is just a lost hiker or something? I don't know. 
.
*the knocking continues. Getting louder and harder than before*
.
But I should check, the machete Rich told me about is right by the desk, I want it just in case this isn't a lost hiker. I get out of my seat slowly and I pick up the machete and put it behind me so I don't scare whoever might be behind the door, if this is just a lost hiker. And than I slowly walk to the door. And before I get to the door, just to be safe. 
.
""Hel...Hello?..."" 
.
And just like that. No more knocking. Nothing at all now. 
.
I approached the door and put my hand on the knob. I slowly turn it and pull the door open gently. 
.
Nothing standing there. Nothing at all. 
.
I quickly turn around and go to grab the flashlight on the desk and take a walk around the cabin while basically touching it by staying so close.
.
Not a sign of anyone being here besides me. Absolutely nothing at all. 
Crickets chirp around me, owls who-ing in the distance. As peaceful as a night should and can be.
.
(What the actual hell was that?) I thought to myself. 
.
I make my way back inside and shut and lock the door. I make sure all windows are shut and locked. And turn everything off in the cabin. 
.
It was close to 1:30 by this point. and since I had done the check in on the outside and everything was normal. Besides what happened. 
.
I decided that I should get in bed and hopefully go to sleep. 
.
I brushed my teeth and cleaned my face, just trying to ignore what just happened. thankfully the water does work well and is even heated. So that's a plus right now. I Got my clothes changed and started into bed. 
.
I made sure I brought my own sleeping bag and pillows, didn't wanna use old and God knows how many people's heads have used ones here. 
.
The bed is nothing amazing. It's a twin size bed that looks like it has been clearly well used. But thankfully has visibly clean sheets and a comforter. But I still put my sleeping on top of the cover. Tucked my inside and got all good and comfortable. Pretty cool in the cabin this time of the year so the sleeping bag was a good choice. 
.
After a little bit I ended up passing out and apparently sleeping through the whole night. Without a peep from me. but with plenty of sounds all around me. Peaceful.
A Goodnight to me.
.
I woke up the next morning around 8:30, it was cold that morning so it took a lot of energy and motivation to get out of my sleeping bag. Cause who like's waking up freezing. 
.
But once I did get out, I started on my normal morning routine. Got coffee, brushed my teeth. Clean clothes on and prepared myself for the start of a new day and my new life for awhile. 
.
.
.""Several weeks later"".
.
.
Time went by rather quickly being out here. When I first came out here it was chilly and leafs just started falling off of the trees and bushes. But still nice. 
.
Now a small and thin blanket of snow covering everything all around me. Giving my zone an air of beauty I didn't know was possible. 
.
Been obviously spending most of time walking my zone during the day. So far I'm getting use to my zone, walking around and marking everything I can in my map and notes for reference points and land marks. 
I made sure to take plenty notes of all animals activities. 
.
The patterns of the herds of Deer I see around take and do. How often I see a squirrel take a dump, and that a duck I saw flying over head the other day, I couldn't recognize it but it was pretty interesting and cool. 
I even got a beautiful picture of Two chipmunks sitting on a snow covered log while it lightly sprinkled over top of them.
.
Also been getting my daily routine down pat at the cabin of radioing into the Ranger station of my accounts throughout the day and filing my reports on the computer to send to headquarters and Rich. And also getting pretty good at Texas Hold 'Em in my down time. And still can't make out the temp on the oven. So I just set it to something and wait til it gets warm and throw my food in and just watch it. What a life.
.
Haven't had any more moments of silence or guest showing up to the cabin randomly. 
I say hello everytime I step outside, walk to a new spot I haven't been. And everytime I walk back inside the cabin. It's becoming a second nature thing for me to do by this point. Things were normal. 
.
Then there was one morning after waking up. Something wasn't normal. It was quiet.
I woke up and couldn't hear. It hasn't happened before like this.
.
I thought to myself (ehh you just woke up, maybe just still asleep some and not hearing everything right away.)
.
So I get up and walk to the bathroom which isn't far from my bed. I pee and start my morning bathroom routine. 
I still couldn't hear anything. Not evening me peeing. 
.
Still just thinking I'm half asleep. I went to go start washing my face and hands, and also brush my teeth. I turn the water on and couldn't hear the faucet running, nor anything on the sink making noise when I moved them. Absolute silence. 
.
I thought that maybe I haven't said enough hellos or missed saying it at some point yesterday. Wasn't sure but again, better safe than sorry. I said ""Hello"" and waited for the sweet sounds of the woods to creep back in like they have before. Except Nothing happened. Not even my own voice made a sound when I spoke. 
I haven't even heard the gentle ""Hello"" I have everytime before. Just absolute and utter silence. 
.
I start to panic a little and get my clothes on fast as I can and walk outside to start saying ""Hello"" and hope everything goes back to normal. 
Get my pants on, a shirt and some slippers I brought.
I open the front door. Walk to the bottom of the last step going outside. Take a deep breath and yell ""Hello!"". 
Still nothing. Not even another ""Hello"" or anything making the slightest noise.
.
(Oh shit. this can't be good.)I thought. (I can send an email to the Station and let them know what's happening.) after that I headed back inside, got on the computer and write the station a message. 
.
""Rich or Josh are you guy's there? I just woke up and I can't hear anything. What's going on?"" 
.
I Sent it and waited by the computer for a response. 
.
It took a few minutes to get a response but when I did, it was Jonah. 
.
He said. 
""Hey Alex it's Jonah. Rich and Josh left out earlier this morning to go meet with the neighboring County Ranger teams to discuss some roads being blocked by some downed trees by the county line and to see what needs to be done. They told me to wait inside for messages or calls on the radio.""
.
And I wasn't expecting him to then say this. 
.
""But I can't hear anything either, have you been making sure to say Hello?"" 
.
More fear creeping in now. I responded. 
.
Me.
""Yes I have, literally every time I make a step or breath I take I say it so the silence stays away. 
Have you been making sure to say it?"" 
.
Jonah.
""Of course I have, I've been working here for 4 years now and have never slipped up once. Are you sure you've been saying it?""
.
Me.
""YES IVE BEEN SAYING IT I SWEAR!. Is there any reason you know why it's happening if everyone here makes sure to says it? Obviously we have been doing it or it would have happened sooner right?"" 
.
It took Jonah a good five or more minutes to respond to me. When he did he said. 
.
Jonah.
""Right, but this has happened like this before. We got it quick but......about a year ago or more. A family was broke down on the road heading into the Park and their kids wondered into the woods and got lost. it happened then, stayed quiet while we looked for them. Rich Had me and another employee at the time stay with the parents while him and Josh went looking. After probably two hours of searching, They found them and the kids must have said it cause when Rich saw them and the kids saw him. All noise came back.""
.
Me.
""So does that mean there's possibly someone lost out here and they're causing this to happen? And did the parents or kids ask about it?""
.
Jonah.
""it's a high probability, even though the parks closed for the season and with the wild fire making its way in our area. Should definitely not be anyone out here. But clearly there is. And yes but they were taken in by police, cause by the time they were found The police got involved and took it from there. They know what happens out here.""
.
I had to ask. 
.
Me.
""What happened to them?""
.
Jonah.
""Still with us and breathing. But outside of that. I don't even know. They've never talked or you would have known before coming here.""
.
Me.
""True. But Okay, should I make my way to the station and we set out and both start looking together?""
.
Jonah.
""No I can't leave. Rich said no matter what, don't leave the station. someone's gotta be here to radio into and take calls from headquarters. Except now it's a message headquarters thing. You should head out and start by your cabin and work your way around til you get to the station, check in with me before heading back around."" 
.
Great, now I have to go look for someone who's not supposed to be out here and bring them back to safety, while not being able to hear a dang thing. Obviously a lost person isn't good and I'm not upset at them for being lost. Just not sure how easy it'll be since we can't hear anything. And not knowing what happens with it quite like this for a long time. But i gotta look for them. For not just their safety. But possibly for all of us out here.
.
Me.
""Okay, I'll get a bag packed with some supplies and start from the east side of the cabin and work my way to you. And what's the code to the safe in my cabin with the gun?""
.
Jonah.
""It's 2709. All the shells for it should be in there and have a bag to carry them in.""
.
Me.
""Great. Hopefully I won't have to use it for anything. But better safe than sorry.
If I don't make it by night fall to the Station. Come looking."" 
.
Jonah.
""Understood. Bring your radio with you too just in case you find them and can call it in. Good luck, and Be safe.""
.
Me. 
""I'll do my best. Thank you.""
.
I get out of my seat and start throwing on my cold weather clothes and boots and Pack a bag with some food and water and an extra jacket. Flashlight and batteries, the radio. And get the gun from the safe and load it full and throw the ammo bag over my shoulder as fast I could move. 
I grab my map and head out looking for someone out here, hoping to stop this soon.
.
I started going east and making my loop toward the station, I'm looking at probably a probably a good Ten plus miles I have to put in until I get to the station, I had to try and make it there before night and hopefully have found someone on the way and make the silence go away. 
.
Time passes and I've made it probably close to five miles by now. Still haven't found anyone and the silence hasn't gone away yet. I started walking at 9 and it's 11:30 now. At least I'm making good time.
.
I start to get close to a spot I marked on my map that has a small pond that usually the animals around here drink out of. I was expecting it to be frozen over from the cold and no animals around.
.
I was wrong.
.
I see a Buck is thrashing all around in the pond breaking up the ice. The buck is mangled and covered in blood, and laying all around the pond is the bodies of another deer, looks like five to six of them. 
.
(Wh...what the hell...?) I think to myself. 
. 
And after a few seconds of watching it. It sees me. And it starts coming towards me.

Hey there,

I’m looking to connect with someone genuine who enjoys good conversation, laughter, and building a real connection. Friendship is always the starting point, but I’m open to seeing where things can naturally go whether that’s just good company, something casual, or eventually more.

A little about me: I’m 33, 5’10”, athletic build, green eyes, and brown hair. People would describe me as laid back, sarcastic in the best way, and always down to laugh. My work keeps me busy with odd hours, but I actually enjoy the flexibility it gives me. I can travel and usually work around different schedules pretty easily.

When it comes to interests, I’m all about the outdoors during spring, summer, and fall whether that’s hiking, camping, being out on the water, or just a long walk with good company. In the colder months I switch gears and keep it cozy with reading, cooking, binging shows, or relaxing with coffee and good conversation. I also really value physical connection and quality time. It’s my way of feeling close to someone.

I’m hoping to meet someone who’s fun, witty, playful, and open minded. Consistency matters to me, and I’d love to find someone who enjoys both the silly side of things and the deeper conversations. Someone who’s not afraid of a little sarcasm, loves to laugh, and appreciates genuine connections.

If this sounds like your vibe, send me a message. I’d be glad to get to know you.

The Aquasana AQ-5300+R Replacement Filter Cartridges have been a game changer in my home, providing healthier water for my entire family. This product focuses on enhancing the quality of water by reducing up to 99% of 78 contaminants, including lead, chlorine, mercury, pesticides, and even microplastics. The fact that it’s WQA certified to meet NSF/ANSI Standards 42, 53, and 401 speaks volumes about its reliability. My morning coffee now tastes so much better, and even my cat seems to enjoy the water more than the tap alternative! Having used this every day for months, I can say it's been a worthwhile addition to our daily routines.  

**Ease of Installation**  

I’ve never been a fan of complicated installations, and one of the highlights of this water filter is just how easy it is to replace. The twist-off, twist-on system means I didn’t have to call a plumber or deal with disconnecting water lines. Within minutes, the new filter cartridges were securely in place, causing no disturbances to the flow of water. Even after replacing it a few times, I'm still amazed by how user-friendly the design is.  

[Check Aquasana AQ-5300+R price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b01lb0l6ms/)  

**Performance That Makes a Difference**  

Using this filtration system regularly, I noticed a remarkable improvement in the water’s clarity and taste within the first week. The system filters up to 800 gallons effectively, providing clean water that costs only about ten cents per gallon. It’s been satisfying to know that not only am I drinking purer water, but I’m also saving money as fewer filter replacements are needed compared to other products. Whether I'm making soups, boiling pasta, or even steaming vegetables, the difference in taste and quality is clear. These filters make a noticeable impact on our meals, beverages, and even pet care.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Certified to remove 99% of harmful contaminants such as lead, asbestos, and pharmaceuticals.  
- Easy twist functionality ensures quick filter changes without professional help.  
- Enhances both taste and clarity of water for better hydration and cooking.  

**Things to Keep in Mind**  

Despite its efficiency, there are aspects worth considering. The product uses plastic materials, which might be a concern for those seeking more sustainable options. Although the simplicity of replacing the filters is great, it’s important to ensure you’re always using genuine Aquasana replacements. Untested third-party cartridges aren’t certified for performance, which could influence the water quality.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Could explore use of eco-friendlier materials instead of plastics.  
- Genuine cartridge replacements are a must but come at a slightly higher cost than generic alternatives.  

**Design and Build Quality**  

Compact and lightweight, the design blends well beneath my sink without compromising space. Measuring 2.2 x 9.5 x 9.5 inches and weighing just one pound, the product feels well-thought-out in terms of size and efficiency. Its unobtrusive build fits neatly and works seamlessly without making you feel like your under-sink space is overly crowded. The sleek design is a minor, yet delightful touch, making it easier to maintain.  

**Competing Brands**  

When looking at similar products, I seriously considered the APEC WFS-1000 and iSpring RCC7 filtration systems. Both are strong contenders, offering multi-stage filtration systems tailored for removing contaminants. However, the Aquasana filter edges them out with its ease of use and certified contaminant removal. The twist-off design is significantly quicker and simpler than the alternatives I’ve tested. Where it does fall short is in material sustainability—some competitors are beginning to incorporate recyclable components. Still, for its price range and convenience, Aquasana holds a significant lead.  

**Value Proposition**  

Given everything it offers, this filter set delivers exceptional quality for its price. It provides consistent, clean water without stretching your budget over time. While there are cheaper options on the market, none seem to match the balance of certification, ease of installation, and level of contaminant removal that this one ensures. It feels like a smart investment for anyone focused on health and convenience.

1nkjo9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLoperDiet/comments/1nkjo9c/the_loper_diet/,THE LOPER DIET,"Today is my first day on the development of this thread. 

Today I shed light onto a diet I have been working on for years. 
One that is unique. 
One I believe will change lives. 

Let’s go into the criteria I have established.

- This diet must fulfill all micronutrients
- This diet must run off ketone bodies
- This diet must be low in saturated fats 
- This diet must have high omega-3s 
- This diet must have significant antioxidants 
- This diet must have significant poly/mono fats
- This diet must be medium to low in protein
- This diet must contain vegetables 
- This diet must contain prebiotics 
- This diet must contain probiotics 
- This diet must be financially viable for MOST 
- This diet must be sustainable/enjoyable 

I have spent countless hours studying nutrition. 
What works, what is established. 
What has not been established. 

This diet is not compete. 
Matter in fact I plan to build a community full of ambitious people to help me solve critical flaws anyone can produce! 

So what foods do I eat! 
- eggs/egg whites (considering discontinuing) 
- almond milk 
- Greek yogurt 
- keto bread (I will deny any keto haters) 
- cinnamon 
- coffee
- Artificial Sweeteners (yep)
- sardines 
- broccoli 
- spinach 
- beef (minimal, considering discontinuing) 
- almonds 
- walnuts 
- hard cheese (minimal)
- canola oil (any seed oil… YEPPPP)
- raspberries 
- blackberries 
- Acai berries 
- banana 
- beef liver (considering discontinuing) 
- flavored carbonated waters (peak) 
- sauerkraut 
- Sugar free syrups (YEP)
- Nutritional Yeast 
- Chia Seeds 
- dark chocolate 
- cocoa powder 
- chicken 
- salmon 
- tilapia 
- cod 
- any fish (I mainly eat sardines)
- most vegetables (I listed ones I eat)
- most fruits (I do the ones highest in specific antioxidant)

NOW, to make this clear!
These foods make many meals that can be made from such a unique variety of foods. 

What sounds impossible is possible as well!
- This diet is real
- This diet works 
- This diet I love

- You can do keto and eat fiber
- You can do keto and eat fruit 
- You can do keto and eat vegetables 

Keto is a parameter that is bound to one thing
Production of ketone bodies
That is it, if you are producing and are in nutritional ketosis 
I consider you’ve met that parameter!

My diet is unique, I don’t follow one direction!
I utilize many principles from every perspective of nutrition science!

Ketone bodies are smaller particles than glucose. 
This means they utilize less oxygen to make ATP 

SO although glucose broken down into ATP = 35
Ketone bodies = 10 ATP 

Ketones are utilized faster and are preferred! 

This diet works towards 
- Low oxidative stress 
- Low lipid panel (LDL, TRIGLYCERIDES)
- low inflammation 
- Peak focus 
- Peak cognitive ability 
- Peak longevity/lifespan 

What sounds undesirable can become very desirable once you allow your mind to open up to dismissing the highly palatable foods we are so accustomed with. 

This is a brief introduction to..
The Loper Diet!

Expect many many updates and breakdowns on every working mechanism with time!

Bless those who welcome advances in our current ideologies in nutrition to make critical changes in our longevity!

*Creak.*



Faint footsteps were heard by the girl all the way from her room. She stayed on the dusty old wooden floor, listening. Hoping that the footsteps were true. They kept coming along with faint shuffles. Someone was in the house with her. Susan hoped that the new people in her home were nice. Every other person that came by was mean or reckless with her things. All she had left was her brown teddy bear with a small pink bow around its neck. The bear wasn’t in her care however, making her sulk from not having the comfort of it. It was hard to pick it up. Susan always left it somewhere on the floor just from being so exhausted in even lifting the arms of it.



Her own small bare feet made it downstairs, creating footprints on her way down. Old furniture was wrapped up in plastic wrap. She heard small chatter, at least by two people. Susan peeked her head out from a wall near the living room. A man and woman stood in the living room, it looked like they got a safer way of entering. She remembered the last person who tried to come into her home by breaking into her window, cutting their hand in the process. The woman seemed eager to be there, while the man had a hesitant look. Her teddy bear sat up straight on the coffee table. Even when she walked past the two adults, they didn’t notice her. Arms reaching out for her only stuffed animal.



Slim tiny fingers phased through the bear. Making her pout and trying again. And again. After a few more attempts the girl stomped her foot hard on the floor, the adults flinched. She tried to get their attention. Yet her faint voice didn’t fill their ears. “Bear.” she said and pointed at the bear and jumped up to try to put herself in eye view. She was ignored. 



“I want my bear.” she spoke louder. 



The man called out first, “Hello?” he said with his voice echoing the quiet house.



“Hi!” Susan replied back with a wide grin. 



The man never looked down towards her while the woman shined her flashlight in different directions. Susan frowned. They were ignoring her. Every person that came into her home always ignored her, or screamed and ran away from her. Even when she begged them to stay from being so lonely. She couldn’t do anything but watch them leave. Over and over again. Every new person comes and goes, and Susan sat in her room. Waiting for days for a new friend. Her hands balled up into fists. All she wanted was her bear, waiting for someone to play with. “I want my *bear*!”



The two flinched again. Finally, they heard her. Their head turned to the bear on the table. Susan made an attempt to grab it again. It fell backwards. The woman began to freak out. The man stepped closer to the bear despite the woman's protest. Susan watched the man poke her bear. Then lifting it like it was nothing. Her arms were quick to reach up in the air for it. The man examined it while she stood on her tippy toes to grab the leg in a small tug. He let go of it with a step back. With more energy she used, she held her bear, for the first time in years. The two adults freaked out more simply at her holding it. 



“Who's right here?” the woman asked shakily, slowly beginning to get behind the man.



“Me!” Susan yelled. She didn’t care if they didn’t hear her anymore. “Me Susan!” 



Her breathing quickened as the hold on the bear became unbearably tight. Slamming it down on the ground and screamed louder. “Look at me!” 



She screamed over and over again. Stomping her feet. Each scream got louder and louder. They didn’t hear her. No one ever did. Not even when she begged for people to stay and play. Begged them to be her friend. Everyone left. Just like her parents. They didn’t spare her a glance when she held onto their feet to make them stay. An old vase caught her eye. Storming over to the large blue glass vase and throwing it. The adults jumped back as it shattered. She began to throw more things. Going from glass to old moldy pillows. The man covered the woman's head to shield her from the shattered glass.



“What the hell is going on?” the woman yelled with a firm grip on the man.



“MY NAME IS SUSAN!” the girl roared. “LOOK AT ME!”



Her hands went into her tangled hair, pulling out of frustration before starting to cry. She then hugged herself. They were bound to leave after her outburst. Every other person did the same. Then she’d be left alone again. Waiting for the next person to come by.



The adults spared glances and looked around for her. Susan yelled out again until their eyes at least landed on her. 



“Susan…” the man said. “We can’t see you.” She watched him walk towards the table, the only thing that wasn’t broken in the living room. “If you’re here, knock on the table please.”



To her, it was an odd request given that she was standing right in front of them, yet compiled. Doing slow three knocks on the table. Glaring at the man. Waiting for a negative reaction. The man’s eyes widened while getting on his knees. She tilted her head at his actions. Getting closer with small steps. He asked for her age, and she wrote it on the table. *Seven*. For once someone noticed her and wanted to get to know her instead of running away. Her breathing slowed down. Closing her eyes for just a second. When she opened them, the man stared at her in shock. Almost as if it was his first time seeing her.

  


Susan spoke out hesitantly, “Hello.” 

  


“Hello Susan.” The man was quick in replying. Hesitantly reaching his hand out. Her own hand reached out. His warm large hand touched her cold one. The girl smiled for once in her lonely life. Now crying happy tears. She made a new friend, and hoped they’d never leave.

1nkjf0s,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nkjf0s,I just bought 100 shares in DUOL,"Now that the FED has finally lowered rates, I've been looking for an AI hyperscaler that can actually deliver. 

As I've mentioned before, this is now a stock pickers market...

#Financials

The first thing to catch my eye about DUOL was the quarterly revenue and gross profit curves. Can we all agree that they are a thing of beauty? 

This company now delivers operating margins of 13.5% and an ROE of 19.15%. Again, extremely impressive for a company that's only been profitable for 6 quarters. Their minimal debt shows disciplined execution.

But I don't think we're finished. I think DUOL has the AI-ready platform to scale to a ROE of 60%+ ...we could be talking about the next magnificent company here, a true compounder.

#The Courses

The next thing was to test the app. I had used it about 2 years previously, but now the improvements are enormous. 

They've obviously really thought about the course material, redoing it where necessary. I feel like they have some top PHDs designing the syllabus.

For example, it used to start with sentences like ""the dog drinks water""...

Now it starts with ""I want a coffee"" - literally the first thing you need to say in a new country. Sentence bridges like ""also"" and ""actually"" are introduced early as well, giving flow to sentences, building confidence.

The repetition is now broken up with AI voice calls, language games and podcasts, all hosted by their viral characters.

Recently they announced they would be expanding many more courses from A2 to B2 language proficiency level - even providing language proficiency certificates for employers.

I spoke to my 12 year old foreign nephew for the first time in English the other day. I asked him where he learned English? expecting him to say it was from school - NOPE, it was Duolingo - apparently it's simply fun...

#Unlimited Scalability

DUOL is right to focus on languages right now, but the courses they could add are endless. Here's just a few ideas:

- Sign language
- Personal finance (badly needed imho)
- Home/car maintenance
- Philosophy
- Business administration 
- Geography
- History 

They have already added Chess, Mathematics and Music - Where does it end?!

#AI Hyperscaler

Even without AI, this company is a gem, but with artificial intelligence it's a true beast. They can use AI for:

- Reducing human workload in writing repetitive course material (still human reviewed).
- Creating exciting upsells such as the ""Talk with Lily"" voice call feature.
- Initial drafting of illustrations (this feeds into their viral marketing).
- Directing customer service requests to the right human (my help ticket was responded to in under 2 hours!).

The idea of ChatGPT integrations competing with them is laughable. This isn't as easy to replicate at scale as it looks. They already have the user base momentum...

Actually, the fact most of us still use ChatGPT and Midjourney instead of Gemini, should tell us something about the significance of first-mover advantages in AI.

#Valuation

Now let’s address the high valuation. 

I'm not one of those morons that is going to tell you PE ratios don't matter - earnings absolutely do, and always will matter.

Normally as a value investor I wouldn't buy a company with such a high forward PE.

However, what I look at more is the TRAJECTORY of capital efficiency and operating margins - which in this case (given the clear AI runway) more than justifies the price.

This company is somewhat newly profitable. Some distortion of valuations are to be expected. Earnings in November are likely to continue showing improvement in capital efficiency.

This company is about to start really standing out in stock screeners...",2,1758227341.0,AsymmetricAlpha,5,0.67,False

My idea of a perfect holiday is simple: mornings by the beach, long walks, a little shopping, and early evenings. I dress modestly, behave respectfully, and nightlife isn’t part of my plan. 

However, I’ve had difficult experiences in other Arab countries, from catcalling to unwanted touching and that has made me cautious. Online, Dubai looks modern and safe, but I also read stories about people being arrested for the smallest things, which makes me nervous. Sometimes I wonder if I’ll simply be left in peace, or if smiling at the wrong person while sipping an iced coffee could somehow turn into a problem.

He notices little absurdities everywhere. Like how people proudly say, “I’ve had my coffee,” as if they’ve just survived a battle. Or how motivational quotes tell you to “be yourself,” which is weird because half the time, being yourself is exactly what got you into trouble.

To Vish, life isn’t this big, polished TED Talk moment—it’s more like a badly edited sitcom. The laugh track’s always late, the characters keep forgetting their lines, and the plot makes zero sense. And somehow, that makes it even better.

He doesn’t see the world as something to conquer. He sees it as something to play with, to poke at, to argue with like it’s a friend who’s always a little drunk.

I have been diagnosed with anxiety for my entire life and adhd and OCD “tendencies” caused by my anxiety but I am starting to think I might just have OCD. I have been spiraling about different fears since I was a child, phobias is my worst. When I was younger I was terrified of bugs and would convince myself they were in my hair and wash my hair multiple times a day. Then after years I started to believe that if I don’t knock 3 times on every table and lock things three times my parents were going to be killed and something really bad would happen to me and the pattern of three made me feel comforted. After I got over that, I started to spiral about getting mugged and s*xually assaulted when I was walking home from class (even though I lived in such a safe college town) and so I would check behind my shoulders 24/7 and eagerly hold my taser every. Single. Day.  When I stepped outside. I could not feel safe if I wasn’t in my own room.

I have seen them a lot since moving here, and I am consistently on an intrusive thought cycle of remembering what they look like when I saw them, thinking they will touch my feet, and it just makes me want to throw up and never leave the house im so afraid. Obviously I know how irrational this is they have no interest in being near humans but it makes me unable to relax when walking on the street even to get coffee or just be a normal person, all I can think about is rats and I will even hit myself in the head to get the thoughts out or say STOP out loud and I look absolutely crazy lol.

They usually sit too thick in my nose.  I don’t think I like coffee or chocolate notes, also not a fan of orange blossom.

The sweetest perfumes I own are Strawberry Mochi by D’annam, Santal Basmati by Affenescence,  Debasser by DS&D.

I’d like some kind of cake/cookie/pastry scent… but not too thick or overly sweet. Something with a bit of a twist or an edge would be cool.

It’s pretty chipped on each leg from moving and my dog over the years, all 4 legs have an angled screw through and they’re all pretty stripped out so the table wobbles and legs bend if it’s moved around. There’s also a spot that’s a semi deep scratch on top that was stained over when we got it. Lastly a bit of nail polish remover that got spilled on it

I have some wood working experience, at-least enough to mostly stumble through sanding and staining. I’m wondering what is recommended to fix the paint chips and that deep gash on the top once I get the table sanded down",1,1758226768.0,furniturerestoration,0,1.0,False

I have a better idea of what I want now and would like some recs.

Me: 5'9"", 160lbs

Use Case:  <2 mile trips (one way) from my apartment to/around a downtown area with mostly flat well paved roads, sidewalks, and bike lanes. Used as transportation to and from coffee shops, doctor appointments, pick up lunch, etc. to save time/not have to use my road bike/car.

Priorities: Folding, wet weather protection, low weight, small form factor.

Don't really need: Range, power, hill climbing.

  
The KQi 100F is totally fine, but for what I want I think it's too heavy, cumbersome to carry and move, and probably more than I need in terms of speed/power. I know it's on the smaller/lighter side, but a shoulder injury makes it more difficult that I'd like to carry, and I feel bad lugging it around when I get food or sit down at a bakery. I also don't need something going 25mph downtown when I have to start and stop constantly for cars, and there's really only one uphill that I go from 25mph to 20mph, which doesn't seem that extreme. I think I can also do something smaller, since in general I'm not a big dude.

I would consider the KQi air, but after my experience with the 100F I won't be getting anything from NIU in the future. I've looked at the VX5 PRO, but I'm not sure a \~5lb difference in weight would really do much. I've honestly considered a Razor Icon Shadow since it's \~12lb lighter and overall smaller. No idea how the spec differences would translate to the real world though, so any help is appreciated!",1,1758226495.0,ElectricScooters,2,1.0,False

I want a consistent FWB type situation where we shoot the shit, drink, smoke, cuddle, kiss and fuck. Hopefully multiple times per week. I'm single and have no kids, my own place (can host) and a car. I, personally, am a fan of car play as well (i know not everyone gets down with it).

I'm very easy-going, I love to communicate, I appreciate honesty and I'm quite emotionally intelligent. I want to get to know you first and I think chatting, talking on the phone and meeting IRL are a great way to get familiar with each other.

I live a healthy lifestyle where I do cardio and lift weights multiple times per week. I have a good job that pays more than just the bills. I eat pretty well and don't really eat much junk food (but I do like to indulge sometimes). To me there's something awesome about cuddling up to a nice movie and eating some junk food together lol. I'm looking for a lady who is DDF (i'm DDF as well) but to be clear I would love if we could smoke weed and/or drink together.

Hopefully we have some things in common too! I like horror, thriller and action movies, video games, board games, passionate about music, love to go to restaurants, concerts and raves. I also love comedy and watch quite a bit of it on youtube and have been to a few live stand up shows. I know a really nice comedy bar I'd love to take you to and a few arcade bars too.

I'm white, born and raised here in Toronto. I'm average height with a muscular build, a cute smile, a full head of hair and a full set of teeth... lol. I like to think I'm pretty decent looking but I have a very strong, confident personality to go with it. I'm pretty athletic and extroverted but I have a nerdy side as well. I like computers and technology and geek out to music, video games and movies.

So if you are open to a respectful FWB situation where we can get more familiar and personal with each other and I sound like someone who you would like to get to know then feel free to shoot me a message. I'm pretty engaging, love to have real, deep conversations and I don't bite! A nice first date for us would be meeting up for coffee and going for a walk. Maybe I'll even let you meet my cat.

I’m getting married in June, and I would love to get my skin fixed. When I was in college, I was on accutane and had a lot of success with it. My skin remained pretty clear for several years after. But, since turning 26 my skin has done a complete 180 and I can’t seem to get it under control. 
My skin is sensitive so I do have to be careful with particular products. I’ve gotten to the point where I feel like my skincare is pretty simple because my skin reacts best to this. 

At night: 
- Double cleanse (first with centella 1004 oil, second with vanicream face wash. 
- byoma hydrating serum
-differin adapelene gel
-vanicream lotion (daily moisturizer)

Morning:
- vanicream face wash
- vitamin c serum
- vanicream lotion
- centella sunscreen 

I eat overall very healthy (except for the occasional sweet treat), I exercise, I drink lots of water, no soda, only drink one cup of coffee a day so I’m feeling stuck. If anyone has any advice as to how I can help my skin that would be amazing <3",2,1758226400.0,SkincareAddiction,3,1.0,False
1nkizwt,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/1nkizwt/threw_up_randomly/,Threw up randomly???,"Hello.. Yesterday I started having really bad pain in my groin while getting ready for my haircut appointment. I thought it was maybe my period so I was just like ok whatever. I went out to eat and then went home and started feeling nauseous. I thought it was just from my wisdom tooth which is currently coming in making me salivate, so I ignored it. But then I woke up at 3 am with awful stomach pain. I was like wow okay I have diarrhea and I don’t want to get up. Eventually I gave in and went to the bathroom but as I stood up I was like I AM GOING TO PUKE SOON. So I grabbed a water and a bucket and went to the bathroom and threw up violently for like 30 minutes. It was dark brown liquid, very acidic. Not coffee grounds at all but there were some light reddish specks. Felt better and went to bed. My throat hurt terribly though.

I woke up today and I am… fine?

It seems like I ate something bad. THE ONLY thing I can think of, is that I ate some frozen chicken fries and fish sticks before my haircut.. The thing is, I seem to be slowly becoming allergic to fish? It was just seafood at first, but in recent years when I have eaten freshwater fish, my throat starts itching and burning. But it never affects my stomach. However the “allergy” does seem to be getting progressively worse. Should I try eating fish again to see if it makes me vomit now lol?? Should I be worried?? I don’t throw up that often. I’ve also had some easy bruising lately + I haven’t had my period since May BUT that’s pretty normal for me. (NO I AM NOT PREGNANT)

I'm tired of them so I thought I'd give this a shot. I've heard good things from friends who have found interesting people on here. I like the idea of writing up a post and catching the intrigue of someone and not having the attraction based solely based off of pictures. Words can be impactful. How someone writes matters and so is what they say.

With all of that said what I'm looking for is a real connection. Possibly one that could lead somewhere someday. I'm basically looking to start our relationship with a cuddle buddy type situation and if we really enjoy spending time with each other I'm open to something more meaningful down the line. Just want to enter into it slowly and chat to start. Then plan a meetup for coffee and conversation or maybe even grab some dinner and go for a walk... something along those lines anyway.

A little about me:

I'm single and ready to mingle lol. I'm white (european background) but was born and raised in Toronto. Currently have my own place about 20 mins east of downtown. I have a great job that keeps me busy 9-5 mon to friday but I have some free time to spend around those hours. I have a car as well. I have brown hair, brown eyes and I'm in pretty good shape and live a healthy, active lifestyle. I go to the gym regularly and really enjoy doing things outside (while its warm out at least.) Think hiking, biking, going for a run or a long walk around Queen St E. I eat pretty well and take good care of myself. Would love to find a lady who pampers herself, stays in shape, lives a healthy lifestyle and is a good conversationalist. I'm pretty passionate about music, movies, video games and board games. I love horror movies and cuddling up with some snacks as well. Definitely looking for a little spoon and craving some touch.
