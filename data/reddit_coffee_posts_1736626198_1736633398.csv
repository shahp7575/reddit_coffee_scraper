Once, we were on a coffee date, and he was loudly discussing something that upset a nearby homeless man. The man grew angrier, mistaking my partner’s tone as an insult, and approached our table. I kept looking at my partner, hoping he’d act, but he just froze. The man reached our table, shook it, and demanded, “What did you say?!” It wasn’t until I stood up—hot coffee spilling on me—that I managed to calm the stranger down. At home, when I told my partner I didn’t feel safe, he didn’t apologize but instead whined about me not seeing him as “a man.”

About a year later, one of his best friends got drunk during a group night out and groped multiple women, including me. Imagine literally being “grabbed by the p\*ssy” by someone your partner calls a best friend. The girlfriend of the perpetrator later organized private talks with us to confirm what happened. I told my partner beforehand, expecting support, but instead, he told me to “just get over it” and “be cool,” refusing to confront his friend about the assault.

When his uncle’s health declined, my partner moved him in, despite my objections. This man s\*xually harassed me, addressing my breasts when speaking, openly watching porn in my dining room, and exposing himself if caught. I told my partner I’d move out if his uncle wasn’t removed, but he hid in his gaming room every evening, ignoring the situation. I finally left to stay with a friend, and only then did my partner ask his uncle to leave. Though I came back, I had fallen out of love with him by then, yet we stayed together for years and even got engaged.

I should have left the night he drunkenly described how he’d m\*rder me if I ever “betrayed” him. He said he’d forgive me, act like the perfect husband, then k\*ll me with a hammer when enough time had passed, disposing of my body in a national park.

What finally ended things was discovering his open journal on our shared desktop. I needed the dual monitors for work and saw my name in an entry. I shouldn’t have read it, but I found him calling me a “n\*gger b\*tch” and writing vile things about me, his employees of color, and women in general. I made a copy and confronted him, and he begged me not to tell anyone. We broke up and I moved out.

That was 2.5 years ago. Recently, I saw him and became furious at the sight of him. Would I be the asshole if I posted in the local “Are We Dating the Same Guy” forum and shared what I went through?

I've been following here for a while (since the 2022 Xbox Trailer ""within next 12 months""). I think we've seen plenty ""ok really when is it coming out?"" posts, but I wanted to ask something different.

**How long do you think Hollow Knight: Silksong will stay relevant?**

Like, we've been in genuine limbo for the entirety of the game's pre-release. The game has been in a ""coming soon"" status since it was announced. Even then, every single legitimate new drop we've gotten has affirmed that the game will release ""soon.""

We've never gotten a message saying:

* ""We don't plan to release this year but we promise the game will be amazing"" or anything like that.

We've only gotten:

* *""It can't be too much longer surely""*
* *""That's exactly what we said""*
* *""We had planned to release in the 1st half of 2023, but development is still continuing. We're excited by how the game is shaping up, and it's gotten quite big, so we want to take the time to make the game as good as we can.""*

The infamous **""Hey Gang""** tweet could be interpreted either way. On one hand, it says ""We planned to release the game this year."" On the other, it says ""We want to take our time to make the game good since it's so big.""

There was also when Geoff Keighley deconfirmed Silksong being at Summer Game Fest. He said it would ""be a while"". However I'm going to take his words with a grain of salt due to tha fact that he also said he speculates that covid delayed the game, but random fan who encountered Team Chery at a coffee shop found out that they were entirely unaffected since their team is so small.

This limbo is part of the reason for why it's so difficult to just ignore the game and do other stuff. Of course, I do actually play other games and have other stuff going on, but Silksong is always around the corner.

Most of the other games with long waits only start off with cinematic trailers with no gameplay to be seen. Not only did Silksong have a trailer with 2 whole minutes of gameplay in like 8 different environments, There was a playable demo 6 years ago, Yeah sure it could've been buggy (hehe) but it was *public.* It wasn't only the devs playing a janky version that would explode at any moment.

Most of the games that have a comparable wait to Silksong are Triple-A games by large studios:

* Elden Ring
* Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2
* Metroid Prime 4 (which even has a release window now)

Cyberpunk 2077 took 8 years, but that one promised to be like GTA or something (I don't know much about it besides that it took a long time to make and has a lot of stuff to do).

The record holder for the longest wait between announcement and release is **Duke Nukem Forever** at 14 years. Assuming development for Silksong started in full in 2018 after Godmaster released, we're already halfway there!

The one exception is **Omori**, I think. Any experts, please correct me on this. I just did a bit of reading on Wikipedia. The game is said to have released 6.5 years after development started. That game turned out pretty good according to reviews (never played it). If Silksong is on that schedule, then August 2024 is looking pretty good... oh...

This isn't to say I'm upset or anything. Of course Art takes time. I wou'dn;t even say it's the lack of communication which is driving us all Silksane. it's how the game could literally come out tomorrow or in 10 years. Both are legit predictions. (Shadow drop or they're taking their time)

It's also so strange because Hytale another highly anticipated game with a long delay isn't really in the same boat. For those unaware, or morel likely those who have forgotten, Hytale is a spirtual sucussor to Minecraft being developed by the creators of the Hypixel Servers. (Only ever played Minecraft on Xbox so I'm not entirely familiar with them, I just know they are huge in the Minecraft community stuff) It's trailer has almost 4 millions more views than the trailer for Super Mario Odyssey the best selling 3D Mario Game. 47 Million to 51 million.

The Hytale devs have been acquired by Riot Games. Contrary to popular belief (or not I don't actually know, I don't really see anyone mention this game at all) The Hytale team communicates with the community quite frequently.

It's just that every time they make a blog post they make it clear that the game is not coming out in the near future. Like their post in 2021 said don't expect anything until 2023 at the earliest and then when 2022 came around they let us know not to expecting anything next year.. or the next or even the year after. See where I'm going? The game is getting more and more massive and genuinely looks like it's trying to be Minecraft, 3D Terraria and Roblox all at the same time, while still looking like a feasible game.

They even reached out to the niche Hytale YouTubers to show them top secret footage and let them talk about it to the diehard fans that care. Like imagine if Team Cherry showed mossbag footage of a new boss but didn't show us anything but let him talk about it. Like not spoiling the game, but also keeping a community engaged. Nowadays we just get graig cussing us out every other year :(

The thing is, Waiting for games is the fun part. Like it's the Hype Season. Halloween is only one day of the year but the whole month of October is spooky season. The months leading up to a new Kirby Release are so fun for me. Reading up on all the lore, replaying all the old games to 100%, doing those soul crushing boss rush modes. Then when the new game comes out, I think about how it'll be on the list when I'm hyped up for the next game.

Silksong's hype season has gone rotten. They revived it back in 2022 and even then they snatched the rug from under our feet. Could've let us know it wasn't coming before 11 months in. Even then 19 months later with us not knowing anything else. Absolutely silksanity.

I'm sure Silksong will be good when it comes out, but it's kinda hard to think that. Makes me all anxious and stuff. Wish we could just get the game's release date announced. Even if it's like 2030 or something.

My big question is why the game is so relevant in modern gaming discussions. Not a passive aggressive why, but out of genuine curiosity. Why don't most gamers at large thing this game hasn't been cancelled. Anyone who's frustrated is just impatient and should play other games. It's not like I check r/GamingLeaksAndRumours everyday haha.... (Please save us SamusHunter)

TL;DR I've went through all 5 stages of grief. Denial(Copium), Anger(Impatience), Bargaining(Just give us any news), Depression(the game is cancelled), and Acceptance

Also kinda unrelated, Team Cherry 100% without a shadow of a doubt did not change game engines from Unity to something else.

1. They would've made an announcement before restarting development. Throwing away 4-5 years of progress that would not translate over (see 2)
2. Like seriously, they use a Unity specific plugin to program the enemy behavior, they would legit have to build everything from the ground up. [Source](https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/inside-the-mind-of-a-bug-unity-and-playmaker)
3. the game was delayed indefinitely before the Unity Runtime fee was revealed. There wasn't any indication of a release between May 2023(time of delay) and September 2023
4. The Runtime doesn't exist anymore, they've gone completely back on it.

Anyway I hope you enjoyed my longass rant / vent. I've been spending way too much time thinking about this game over the last few years. I might stick around until February but if 2025 is another nothingburger year, I'll probably retire from skonging.

PS. I'm the guy who started the Silksong is already out on r/HollowKnightMemes back in Fall 2021! I got the idea from r/titanfall. I did it on an old account I deleted because reddit was taking up too much of my time. I promised I get off reddit once Silksong came out ... but it got delayed so I have an alt now.

Anyway, I want to hear your thoughts. I didn't even talk about the upcoming ""Hollow Likes""

1hz72ra,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1hz72ra/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

Oval cut diamonds offer a unique blend of elegance and value, making them an excellent choice for engagement rings and other fine jewelry. Here are the key points to consider:

* Oval cuts create an illusion of greater size and can make fingers appear longer and more slender.
* They typically cost 25-28% less per carat than round diamonds, offering better value for budget-conscious buyers.
* The cut quality is crucial for maximizing brilliance and minimizing the ""bowtie effect.""
* Aim for a length-to-width ratio between 1.30 and 1.50 for the most appealing look.
* Oval cuts are versatile and suit various setting styles, from classic solitaires to modern designs.
* **Recommended Vendors**: For a reliable buying experience, consider purchasing [from trusted retailers such as those](https://labdiamondsreview.com/diamonds/) that provide comprehensive grading reports and advanced visualization tools to assist in selecting the perfect stone.

# Who is this for?

* Couples seeking a distinctive yet elegant engagement ring design
* Buyers looking for larger diamond appearances without the high price tag of a round diamond
* Those who appreciate a blend of classic and modern aesthetics

# Who is this not for?

* Buyers who prefer traditional, round-cut diamonds
* Those who prioritize an official cut grade from grading institutions

# Pros and Cons

Pros:

* Unique, elongated shape for a classic yet modern look
* Appears larger than round diamonds of the same carat weight
* Generally more affordable than round diamonds
* Versatile for various setting styles

Cons:

* Presence of a ""bowtie effect"" that can impact light performance if not properly cut
* Lack of an official cut grade from major grading institutions

# Recommendations for Smart Buying

1. Prioritize cut quality: Look for optimal proportions (table 53-63%, depth 58-62%) to ensure maximum brilliance.
2. Inspect visually: When possible, view the diamond in person or through high-quality videos to assess the bowtie effect.
3. Consider certification: While GIA doesn't provide cut grades for ovals, look for AGSL grading or ASET light performance feedback.

1. Compare prices: Use reputable online retailers like James Allen, Blue Nile, or Brilliant Earth to compare prices and options.
2. Choose clarity wisely: Oval cuts can hide inclusions well, so consider SI1 or SI2 clarity grades for the best value.

# FAQ

1. What is the bowtie effect in oval diamonds?It's a dark area in the center of the diamond caused by light leakage. While present in all oval cuts, its visibility varies.
2. What's the ideal length-to-width ratio for an oval diamond?Most prefer ratios between 1.30 and 1.50, with 1.35 to 1.50 considered classic.
3. Are oval diamonds less expensive than round diamonds?

Yes, typically about 25-28% less per carat due to less waste during cutting.

1. How do I evaluate the cut of an oval diamond without an official grade?Focus on table and depth percentages, and use visual tools like ASET images when available.
2. What settings work best for oval diamonds?Ovals are versatile and look great in various settings, including solitaire, halo, and vintage styles.

Remember, personal preference plays a significant role in choosing an oval diamond. Consider your style, budget, and desired appearance to find the perfect stone for you.

Raise a glass to the home of misfit toys and miscreant troops who will strategically transfer all your equipment to alternate locations because we either need it more than you, or it was your own fault ordering a leather chair for your office in Camp Liberty.""*

Pop quiz. 

When human forward units need something how do they get it? 

Our own militaries have developed drop pods, capable of delivering necessary equipment from orbit directly to the requesting unit. With such a convenient technology available, easy to adapt to any deployment device available, you'd think the humans would develope their own version right? 

Wrong. 

At some length we have discussed the sheer insanity of human military personnel. How they react when you fire on the Chaplain or the Medic can not be understated and is difficult to understand.That being said, it would be a good idea to introduce their, to coin another human phrase, ""Nickle Flapjack toilet water"" psychos. By all means, if encountered, fire everything you have as they do not enjoy the position of non-combatants and medical personnel. 

You would be forgiven to expect me to begin talking about human infantry, armor, or their special forces, but those units also rely on these menaces to civilization, refered to humbly and simply as The Transportation Corps. 

Laugh now, you will learn to respect them later. 

While drop pods are supremely effective and transport vessels are perfectly acceptable in a pinch, human forces still rely on ground transport for the majority of their logistical needs. Seems archaic, especially in light of how advanced humanity has become, but there is something to be said about a convoy of 40,000 pound vehicles with trailers, escorted by other vehicles that are armed with every munitions that these kleptomaniacs can get their hands on, and piloted by maniacs who will willingly plow through your unit to deliver the equipment they are carrying to the unit that needs it. 

Perhaps not the most intelligent tactic, sure, but when that 20K road missile, operated by crackpot with a death wish, decides that you might splat well on their windshield you begin to sympathize with insects. 

Not a good feeling. 

After the transportation soldiers run through your oh so carefully conceived and constructed positions like a bear that ate a kilo of cocaine, they will return fire as their vehicles are being unloaded. Perhaps you would think it's a reprieve, and that now lighter vehicle wouldn't dare try that again? No, my friends, now they have the opportunity to conduct a ""truck rodeo"" for a live audience.

Bear in mind that there is no malice on the part of the human vehicle operators. In their demented little minds they think it's a game. 15 meter long trailers, no longer burdened by the loads of equipment that once occupied their decks, are whipped around wildly through your ranks pulled by a 9 meter long all terrain behemoth of steel and depleted uranium armor controlled by a marginally intelligent bonobo that thrives on caffine and chaos. 

In addition, it is widely believed that the human Transporation Corps is entirely populated by criminals. Ammunition, fuel, armor plates, coffee, alcohol and food will go missing. There is an active report regarding a leather living room set that disappeared from an officers workplace. If it can be believed, a pack of human transporters operating under the cover of darkness, snuck behind enemy lines, tactically aquire an expensive and very comfortable leather chair, load said chair onto the back of one of their escort vehicles, and relocate it to a formerly abandoned bunker that had been renamed ""Trans-ghanistan"" on a human held base. 

That report is unconfirmed, though the bunker was identified from orbital scans. 

To reiterate, these Transpotation units are viable targets, and you may engage them as you see fit, however you should expect return fire from whatever weapons platform they were able to pilfer that fit on a truck bed or trailer. Also expect them to treat the human ""Geneva Conventions"" as if it were a to-do list that needs to be completed in short order, and multiple times while in theater. They have very little self control and share the same moral compass as a fire and forget munition. If you anticipate these soldiers not to do something, they will do that exact thing just to see if they can and get away with it. 

One final thing in closing. If anyone is brave enough to do so, you will be rewarded handsomely for the safe return of my leather chair. The coordinates are on the last page of your handout.

The coffee shop I was at suddenly fell into silence as I processed the information. And then it hit me. We have grown so much apart in the last 15 years, but I was still stuck with the idea of her when we were kids. I still see her as someone who shares her thoughts with me in the back of our classroom, her likes, dislikes, her dogs, her life at home, her reliance on my notes because she couldn’t see what was written on the blackboard even with her eyeglasses on, everything. And I secretly loved her. I loved her in high school after we went to different schools. I loved her in college when she studied architecture and then shifted to veterinary medicine. I loved her after she graduated and started working at a veterinary clinic. And I loved her in silence still after we’ve grown apart.

I felt a panic attack coming up, but forced to collect myself because it would be selfish of me to feel devastated when she’s happy. I sent her a message, complimenting her very cute baby daughter and a quick congratulations. I felt her happiness when she thanked me. I wanted to respond that she will make a great mother, but decided to no longer send a reply.

The only thing that I am really ''dependent'' would be caffeine, but I have reduced to 2-3 a day now & that Is with my current issues, I tried stopping several times, but I believe that I need to fix my health before stopping caffeine, as it's helping me waking up.



From what I recall, I have always been anxious, had problems fitting in society, the same feeling a teenager would have when growing up, but it never went away really, instead, I battled with it my entire life. The last time I felt ''normal'' I would say, was back when I was 14-15, before I started experiencing with drugs (weed), alcohol and energy drinks.



I have battled with these issues & managed to have a good life, with great friend, an amazing family, girlfriends, It never was perfect, as I never felt ''good'', but I always told myself that I was lucky compared to many others in the world & kept going.



With all this, school was.. really difficult for me, I was smoking weed a lot back then, but even after I got off, battling my anxiety was really difficult & so, school was on & off, I didn't get anywhere with it really. The same happened for my jobs, everything was on and off.



Around 6 years ago, I found a job in a metal shop, I was able to work 3 years there, as I never kept any jobs in the past, it was great. I managed to get in a better spot in my life, I got off weed for good, I payed off my debts. After the 3 years, I was lucky enough to switch company & work field as well, using my English that I learned with gaming over the years, I managed to get an amazing job, a great opportunity for my career & my life in general.



When I did the transition, I felt like it was finally my time to shine. I believed that It was time to become who I was meant to be, become the best version of my self. My health wasn't really a concern during that time, all I had really was the highs and downs off caffeine & I believed that stopping for good would resolves that & so, have a steadier energy levels throughout the day.



I did a great job in the first position I was hired for, since it's customer service, it was stressful for me, but I was able to deal with it and push trough, it was hard at times yes, but so are many other jobs in the world. 1 year in, I was offered a promotion, with a lot more responsibilities, an insane work schedule, but also an amazing salary, better than I ever had, providing me with the chance to prove myself, what I had always been hoping for.



2 years ago, I started working in the new position, I did an amazing job, it was going great, fixing problems after problems & dealing with the insane stress level that was added to my life, as I was on call 24/7, everyday. It wasn't always really busy, some weeks were very calm, but some were pure hell, but what provided me with the most stress/anxiety, was the constant uncertainty.



With that being said, I was managing & I was leaning towards the fact that the company told me that it was temporary & there would be changes in the future to improve my quality of life. 1 year or so after starting this new job is where my health started to knock me in the face. I wasn't bad at first, but it got so bad.. even though I tried everything I could to help my case. I tried working on my sleep, diet, exercising more, anything I could at home. As for the specialists, we tried ''everything'' that would be considered in the ''normal'' range I would call it, that would be, blood tests ( nothing abnormal was found ), sleep apnea, hypoglycemia. Sleep apnea was my idea, as my doctor wanted to put me on medication at that point, that was before she put me off work recently. I did at home tests for sleep apnea, all was negative, next time would be to go sleep in a clinic ( my least idea ).



I took my vacations in October, 3 weeks off, to stop caffeine and relax, at the end of it, I was still in the same state, waking up destroyed, taking me an hour to be able to get up, get my first coffee & 1-2 hours after, start my day, pure hell.



The next week, I went back to work, but on Tuesday, I went to see my doctor & she put me off work, prescribed me sertraline, 25 mg. I wanted to get on it, but after online researches, I chose not to & got a psychotherapist. We came to the conclusion, after 2 appointments, that we would take the time to understand what I going on, see what needs to be done & considerer medication if needed.



I never got anywhere since that time, I really wanted to push & get better, but didn't make any progress, I also believed that I might need time as well, but can't see any changes really. It's so bad now, I am always tired, I have a good day, maybe once or twice a month & because of that, I have issues doing anything now, anything at home even. I don't see my friends much & don't do any activities as well, since it started being a living hell.



Yesterday.. I saw my doctor again, I told her all this, we both agreed that this can't keep going & that I would try sertraline 25g, see her at the end of the month again & see my psy every 2 weeks. I have been looking at the pills, searching online to make sure this is the right thing for me. This scares the s\*\* out of me, I found more good stories than bad, but the main thing is, it doesn't make sense to me, this solution comes from my doctor who believes all my issues are caused by anxiety or a depression, I am anxious, but I love life, If it wasn't of thing.. I would be doing a great many things and having fun. I know it takes time to adapt to this drug, but I am thinking about after, when it ''should'' be better, is this really it?



Feels like something is missing, It feels like I missed something to try that would make a lot more sense than this. I might be wrong, probably am? I don't know, I don't know anything anymore, I am confused & lost. I want to put this in the past and move on, keep learning & improving, but I can't find the answers.



I understand if this is too long to read & I don't expect this to work, but I don't know what else to do at this point.. maybe someone out there has the answers, as I believe that there is always one.



From the bottom my heart, thank you in advance.",3,1736632201.0,Anxiety,2,1.0,False

Comments:
The Festivity Blend has been the most memorable coffee I’ve had. I can really taste notes of the cranberry jam, and it’s amazing as an iced pour over. Their beans tend to have pretty unique notes, and are always roasted recently (even within 30 days at the grocery). 


BALAM has to be my favorite roaster though. They are dedicated to ethical sourcing, and I love how they acknowledge the role indigenous peoples in giving us great coffee.
Their XAMAN is amazing and chocolatey with a hint of raspberry. Their Ethiopian also has a really pronounced blueberry note. 

The Hualalai was souvenir from my partners trip to Hawaii. The beans are not roasted evenly, but the coffee feels smooth and there’s no bitterness. 

There is a Blue Bottle Decaf in there, but I cannot say I recommend it. There was a woody aftertaste that I do not enjoy in pour over. It was just okay as espresso. This led me to doing some research on them. Upon finding out it was acquired by Nestle, I will no longer be giving their other beans a try.

","Hi, I’m 20M, and I’ve been in an exchange program abroad that ends on February 10th. While here, I met a girl (19F) under unusual circumstances at a bus station. We exchanged numbers initially out of convenience, but I’ve liked her ever since.

Here’s the background:

1. A month or two after meeting, I decided to call her, even though I was nervous. Before the call, I first sent her a WhatsApp message, but she didn’t read it. I then decided to call her, and she picked up. During the call, I invited her out for coffee or a walk. She politely told me she wasn’t in town (I later saw through her Instagram that this was true). Despite this, the call went well—she asked me questions about how I was doing, adapting to life here, and how my studies were going.
2. After that, there wasn’t much contact for a while, except for holiday greetings (I wished her a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year, to which she warmly responded).
3. Most recently, on Friday morning, I messaged her on WhatsApp to invite her to go ice skating this weekend (Saturday or Sunday). The message was casual, not pushy. However, she hasn’t replied yet, despite being online multiple times since I sent it.

Here’s the tricky part: she hasn’t even opened the chat. If she wanted to ignore me, wouldn’t she just read the message and not respond? This makes me wonder if she’s doing this intentionally—maybe to see if I’ll take more initiative or make a bigger move?

I feel like time is running out to make a real connection before I leave. I don’t want to pressure her or seem desperate, but I also don’t want to give up too easily.

Should I wait for her to reply, send a follow-up message, or try calling her again? Or would that come across as too pushy?

I genuinely like her—not just for her looks, but for her values, personality, and the way she carries herself. I don’t want to blow this, but I’m also unsure what the best next step is.

1hz6h3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diary/comments/1hz6h3s/red_thread/,Red Thread,"We are always finding ourselves at an end. Constant shifting and turning out new endings. The only solace is in the open nature of endings. No answers ever come in true stories. No final bow or tied knot. So years later, perhaps, that end can become a beginning again. We are woven in and out of one another’s lives in ways we don’t fully conceive of. The ways in which we relate to one another may change shape and reform into different bonds, but the potential for a continuation of a story is ever present. Many a rope I thought broken over the years still had length to spare. Now I know not how and if I’ll ever see some again, but I hope for it, and that hope keeps my own thread aloft in the tapestry of my life.

Boyfriends, childhood friends, college comrades, roommates—they’ve come in and out of my life over the years. Showing me the only bonds that ever truly fade is those separated by death. Though even those I’ve lost I still speak two in quiet moments or through strife. I’ve always delighted in stories that reveal the tapestry, but we cannot know the pattern of it while we live it. We can only leave our hearts open to the possibilities. Such is one particular connection that tethers me to hope, reinforced by the words of a lost mentor who I speak to in the form of a prayer at times.

I’ve known Mark Huang nearly all of my life. Even writing his name here in full gives me a strange sort of peace. He was an old school acquaintance I can trace back nearly to age five. He was always there, and because I have few memories before school age, it feels as if there was no time before knowing him. He may not always have been in my classes, but he was always around. And he stood out, because he was Chinese-American in a predominantly white school and because he was one of those clear cases of ADHD you just knew about. He was loud and unequivocally himself in a way that I always respected. In our elementary days, he might have annoyed me from time to time by interrupting band class by being loud and making jokes.

I took things very seriously in life. I was always playful, but serious even about my fun in life. Wildly protective of my friends and dedicated to justice should it only be enforced by playground politics and not by teachers, as it should have been. So, Mark’s inability or preference for not taking things too seriously never really made sense to me. It never made sense to me how he would spend time with the boys who were racist bullies in our town full of bigots, but I imagine he found his own ways to laugh at them. On occasion when someone would cross a line I did not perceive, he was given to getting into shoving matches with the aggressor. I never quite understood or heard what would set this off, but I would generally assume that Mark had a good reason for it. Though I might’ve handled things differently, he was always kind to me, so I didn’t have reason to doubt him.

My mother worked as a Teacher’s Aid in that school, so I was always staying after school while she helped wrap up work. I would get extra brownie points with teachers, usually by doing little chores around the different classrooms like putting stickers on tests or washing the chalk boards. My mom seemed proud of me when I did this so I always wanted the teachers to like me, and sometimes they would allow me into the teacher’s lounge to use the laminator, which I had a fascination with. Other days, I would play games or ‘pretend’ with the kids of the other teachers, who I became close to over the years. One day, I suppose Mark stayed after school waiting to be picked up.

Mark and I weren’t particularly close back then, as I was very reserved and shy, sticking close to only the people I trusted most. I remember a couple instances in which I had reason to spend time with him that stand out because when it was just the two of us, he was rather calm and earnest. I came to perceive him differently when I met his little brother in Pre-Kindergarten, for instance. I had never had a particular proclivity towards younger children, but he was so cute and energetic that I took a shine to him. I think his name was Zackary, though I could be misremembering. Mark and I played with him and his oversized puzzle pieces and when Zackary would throw something or screech, Mark would gently correct him in a way I admired. I was a sweet moment for me and it made me soften towards him and also children considerably. I can’t remember exactly how old we were at the time, but I do distinctly recall trying to envision myself with a child for the first time and wondering what a child between Mark and I would look like. Would they look like Zackary or would their hair be slightly browner and their eyes more hazel, like mine? I must have been nearing puberty by then to have that thought.

There was also a time our desks were put together in a group with my neighbor, Evan. We were tasked with a project to make a British Fort and write a paper about it. The boys were friends, as Mark lived down the road from us, so they argued the entire time and I therefore learned how to take the lead on group projects and developed an affection for both of them I hadn’t had previously. I would say they became my first actual friends outside of my best friend group. One time my father caught them throwing rocks at one another at the end of our driveway and I watched them fighting over something until my father went outside and yelled at them. They never came back after that, but occasionally I’d see Mark ride by on his bike.

I don’t recall many instances of us speaking again until Highschool and by then my parents had been divorced for 3-4 years and although things weren’t good at home, they had evened out somewhat. But I had become more guarded and less open. No longer one of the smartest people in the class, I had spent freshman year being humbled and excluded. No one spoke to me in my honors classes, and I retreated pretty deeply inside myself everywhere except for band class. By sophomore year, most people were familiar enough with me to know I was polite and didn’t talk much, but that they shouldn’t cross me or I’d let out a scathing observation about them based on the amount of time I spent watching them.

I had sophomore Spanish with Mark and some other people I had become friendly with outside of the honors classes. This and band and art classes had become my sanctuaries. In these spaces people either found my defensive attitude funny or I had the safety to be silly. I caught Mark being rude to one of my acquaintances that I found annoying but kind, and told him to stop being an asshole. He did. And turned his full attention to being friendly with me instead, and I couldn’t help but smile. He was more socially adept by then, and was able to talk to girls instead of showing off for attention. This is what I would consider the start of our friendship, with so many years of familiarity and trust it was easy to be my actual self with him fully.

I didn’t have to hide my quirks or my demons with Mark, and by then I had more than a few. Divorce, puberty, and 9/11 had happened all around age 12. My Dad had moved to a small rental house on the other side of town, where there was nothing to do and no friends to see. My mom had gone through phases of grief I’m familiar with now, and came out of divorce scared, hardened, and controlling. My father was sad and angry. My mother depressed and anxious. And my friends didn’t know about any of it. They pulled away and I did too until school and church was all that I had with them. By the time Mark came around, I was thoroughly hopeless and lonely. He was a welcome respite from the darkness and false positivity I had learned to mask my own depression with. He wasn’t in band with me anymore, but I would start to see him more and more in my art classes and in art club.

When we went to the art museum in Philly, he stuck around nearby and although most of his male friends were on our bus home in a group in the back, he sat with me at the front of the bus and shared his earbuds. To this day, this is still one of the kindest gestures that stands out to me from anyone in high school. I had a boyfriend, but he wasn’t very nice to me and Mark knew it. Mark had a girlfriend and she was a little bit stuck up from what I remember of her, which was really not him. So we were both in doomed relationships we would go on to hold onto for far too long. There was no chance of me crossing the line of intimacy with him considering, but I remember the deep feeling of safety, as we mirrored each other sitting with our knees up against the seat in front of us, feet dangling and backs curled with only our shoulders touching—sharing earbuds from his mp3 player. He played Bloodhound Gang songs he knew I liked that were inappropriate and would make me laugh, he played stuff he loved from Blink 182, and he showed me some new songs I don’t remember now. That was the essence of our friendship right there at the beginning. Able to quietly ‘be’ with one another without expectations. To this day, it is what I miss most and have never found in anyone else in quite the same way. It is the moment I believe I felt the spark and the warmth for the first time.

Mark went to college in Philly, being the adventurous person he was, and I went to a small school 20 minutes outside of the city. He was the only person aside from family to come visit me in college. Sometimes we would get together on 1^(st) Friday, where art and cultural locations had discounts for college students and we would go to museums around the city. He knew I wasn’t much into sports or drinking, so he always kept it tame for me and showed me around the city. In hindsight I wish I had done that much more often with him throughout college, as lonely as I was. But the summers home from college are when we really became close.

My childhood friends and I had grown distant, and I would see a couple of my Spanish class friends instead, most notably Lauren and Emily, who I would continue to gather with for years. We were all friends, as pretty much all of the punk, emo, artist kids knew each other. So if you were friends with one branch, you spent some amount of time with all of them. Thus, Seth Fields, who also grew up with Mark and I—was friends with Allen, was friends with Joey, was friends with Arielle, was friends with Emily, was friends with Mark. Often Mark and I would spend late nights in the summer getting high with Seth, or swimming, or just generally loitering in spaces we were supposed to be in. I was always such a rule follower that it was fun to break a couple innocuous ones with Mark and friends. Mark and Emily and I would sometimes spend time together also. But very seldom did I see that whole group in one place. If I did, it was almost always Mark who invited me.

As summers went on, Emily would have more gatherings at her house or Lauren at hers, but it was really that first one that meant the most to me. Mark was my summer. I would take my summer classes, or exercise, or see movies by myself, and go to work every night, and then I would meet up with Mark. We might gather the group together to play tag on the old school playground, or we might just sit and roll cigarettes to smoke in the middle of my street in the part of the neighborhood no one would notice us. We might go for a night swim at the lake and see each other half naked for the first time or we might just walk around a parking lot climbing on things and kicking rocks around while we talked. I think we both knew that it was a good time no Marker what we were doing, but we were both pretty restless people—wanting to be out somewhere with noise and lights in the middle of the night.

As time went on, Seth became more and more frustrated with Mark and I for spending all our time over at his place and smoking all his weed without paying. Social signals that didn’t really register to me yet. I assumed if Mark told me to meet up somewhere, that we were welcome there. That and the first time I really got high from smoking was with them, so I didn’t really know the etiquette. Mark and Seth would also fight about things Mark said sometimes and we got kicked out once. Once when I was very high and had just smoked about 20 minutes prior. I was not yet experienced in how to handle myself when high and had laid back on the futon-bed I was inhabiting to meld with the blankets. I heard the two fighting and once again instructed Mark to “stop being an asshole” not-so-tactfully. This time it only made him more frustrated and whatever they had been arguing about escalated. I was in my own hazy world a moment later and didn’t hear the direction from Seth to leave. Mark came up to me to collect me saying we had to leave. “Leave?!” I panicked. He said yes and helped me up.

When we got to our cars, he looked at me trying to figure out how to open it and asked if I was going to be okay. I said yes and that I would just sit in my car for a while until I could see straight. This didn’t sit well with him so he said he would wait in his car until I felt capable of driving and that he would follow me home. So there I sat, feeling like a burden but barely able to remember where I was and why I was there. I developed a little mantra in my head and when I had it memorized, I turned the key in the ignition. “Lights, hands on wheel, eyes forward—you’re driving,” I repeated to myself aloud the whole way home. I could barely handle the feeling of forward motion without getting the spins and drove 20-25 mph the entire 5 miles home. Behind he followed at a safe distance, even when a car passed us both. I had a white-knuckled death grip on the wheel that didn’t let up until I was safely in my driveway. Mark must have been frustrated with me, because once our paths deviated, he didn’t follow me the final 100 yards to my driveway. But his street was across the intersection from my neighborhood and he probably realized I was okay from there.

Years of experience sneaking around my house and into my house after Mom was in bed made slipping in quietly easy, but I wasn’t sure if I was moving especially slowly, so perhaps she picked up on the fact that I wasn’t sober. I made it to bed just fine, but I thought Mark must be upset with me over the situation, which I became uncertain about whose fault it was. I didn’t hear from him to hang out for the next few days and when we did, we just loitered somewhere in town for a bit before he went off to seek out an adventure or spend time with his girlfriend, Julie. I felt a little displaced and asked if we could hang out again. I said it would be nice if we could have a bonfire somewhere outside if Seth didn’t want us to come back to his house, maybe we could get a couple people together in the woods.

We decided on a spot down the street from our intersection—maybe the equivalent of 5 blocks away. There was a nature preserve there where the abandoned golf course stood. There were plenty of trees for cover, but the side by the entrance had expensive homes to it’s left. I was hoping to get high with a few people and chill and had no idea how many people Mark had invited. I walked from my house and when I entered the property and rounded a line of trees, I saw 5-8 cars parked in the lot lit by the headlights of another car. I was so focused on what idiots they were being to park in the lot after dark that I scarcely noticed my own idiocy in approaching unguarded. I looked for Mark’s face in the crowd of people sitting near their cars and when he and our friend Mario saw me, they tried to subtly tell me to “go home, Jess.” Dumbly, I kept approaching my friends trying to figure out what was going on and why they were ‘giving me shit’. The car with it’s headlights glaring was a ranger’s car upon closer inspection.

I spun around and started to walk back into the shadows when he spotted me and instructed me to come talk to him. He wasn’t quite a cop, but in a small town with no police force, the local park ranger had jurisdiction in kids disturbing the peace on a nature preserve, clearly there for a party. The ranger asked what I was doing there and I continued to state the obvious, “I’m here to meet my friends.”

“What’s your name and where are you coming from?” he asked.

“Jessica Kabitskii…Salem Woods, down the street,” I responded referring to the name of my two-cul-de-sac neighborhood.

“And what were you planning on doing here?”

“Having a campfire and hanging out.”

“Were you planning on drinking?”

“No.” I answered honestly. I was planning on getting blazed, but I didn’t offer that clarification.

“What’s in that backpack, then?” he gestured toward the draw-string bag on my back. I wanted to smack myself in the head it was so obvious.

“Water and potato chips.”

“That’s it? Lemme see.”

I opened my bag and showed him the 2 liter water bottle I brought for my dry mouth and family size bag of chips from Wawa. He was surprised I hadn’t lied. There was nothing else on me.

“Ah…okay,” he sighed, “Who invited you here.”

“Uhh…my friend Mark,” I confessed with no prodding. ‘Narc, Jess!’

“Mark who?”

“Huang.” I said, hoping he wouldn’t ask me to point him out, and trying to think of a way to get out of this conversation.

“Of course,” he almost laughed, sighing instead, “Mark! Get over here.”

Mark was on his feet and next to me so fast he must have expected me to give him up. I never could lie to an authority figure and this was my first time ever even interacting with a ‘cop’.

“Hey, Mr. Stites,” Mark laughed charmingly. Oh. The father of one of our elementary classmates, and my neighbor a couple housed down. Mark must have rode bikes with his son Tyler. I didn’t know him or his dad very well, but he seemed to almost expect mischief from Mark, but it softened him. Mark never got into any real trouble.

“What are you doing here, man?” the ranger asked informally.

“We were just meeting up for a bonfire,” he corroborated my story with ease.

“Am I going to find any alcohol?”

“No sir,” Mark lied dutifully.

Mr. Stites turned to me, “Okay, you can go, but I don’t want to see you out here again after dark.”

I looked at Mr. Stites, who looked back at his ticket pad, and then to Mark with apologetic eyes. Then I turned healed and walked away into the dark without looking back. Fortunately for all of us Mr. Stites did not appear to have questioned everyone or searched anyone other than myself. He sent everyone home straight after and I saw a pack of headlights in the distance behind me, heading out of town. He sent Mark home with a ticket, I found out the following day, when Mark invited me over to hang out at his house instead of going out.

Even though he had gotten himself in trouble, he hadn’t lost the right to see his friends, but he was obviously lying low for now and just invited me over to watch ‘Shark Week’ on the Discovery Channel together. I had never actually been to his house before, though I had always known where he lived from years of riding his bus home with my best friend when I would go to her house after school. She lived just down Cobbs Mill Rd a ways further, but Mark was only a short distance from the intersection that separated us. No wonder I would see him riding his bike so often. The boys back then would ride all the way into town, where Seth lived. If I had grown up knowing how to ride a bike, I probably would have done the same. His house was minimally set back off the road, surrounded by woods on three sides, and just as modest as my home. It wasn’t ostentatious, but it wasn’t unkempt either. I felt at ease there immediately. Just the right fit that made me feel at home. I enter through the kitchen, and the living room was set on the right on the other side of the kitchen wall. I didn’t inspect thoroughly, as was my custom to not appear rude inspecting someone’s home.

I just took it in and Mark lead me into the living room to sit on the couch next to him. He was dressed in grey sweatpants and an old white t-shirt that didn’t quite fit him anymore. His hair was a little scruffy and he had a tiny bit of stubble on his chin. I took off my shoes and sat cross-legged as always, trying to get comfortable, but for the first time in all the time we had spent together feeling acutely conscious of the fact that we were alone. Where do I put my hands? Why am I suddenly so aware of my hands? And the fact that his skin is showing at his midriff. Mark was stretched out lazily on the couch leaning away from me on one elbow, with his legs bent and in different directions. I’m not sure if he noticed me staring at him while I asked him about what had gone down at the golf course after I left. He seemed unbothered by all of it, or perhaps just didn’t want to rehash it and was mad at me for narcing on him.

Still, I felt so self-conscious and couldn’t understand how he could feel so ridiculously relaxed that he was letting his shirt ride up enough to see the scar on his stomach near his belly button. I wanted to ask him about it, but then he would know that I was staring at his stomach, feeling my own squirm. Maybe I should ask. Maybe I want him to know I’m looking at him.

‘What?! No. You definitely do not want him to know you’re looking at his stomach, like THAT.’

‘Why not?’ said a dangerous little voice from the back of my head.

‘Because it’s MARK.’

My eyes moved from his stomach to his face for a moment. He didn’t look at me and gave no indication that he noticed. He blinked slightly in that way that he did, like once he started blinking, he couldn’t stop for a moment. But then he was done talking and I had nothing else to say for a time, and was forced to look away. I kept my eyes trained on the sharks, not really giving a fuck or processing what was being said. But now all I could think about was that skin, and the tiny reveal of dark hair dipping beneath the band of his sweatpants. My mouth filled with saliva and I became acutely aware of my vagina resting on my heels and pulsing.

‘My god…my god…stop IT. If he wanted that sort of thing from you he would have tried to be closer to you. You’re being weird and even if you tried to kiss him, he wouldn’t let you. He doesn’t see you like that.’

‘Well he did take the fall for you last night and still invited you over. And there was that one time he checked you out when you were in a bikini. Just look at him.’

‘Nope…can’t do it.’

‘Look at him.’ I did. He looked back. I looked away.

‘Do it again, but look at his lips this time.’ The dangerous voice was demanding.

The side door Mark had let me in through earlier opened suddenly, and my shoulder twitched from surprise. His mom came in with groceries, saying something to Mark that I didn’t catch. They had a short back and forth, he announced me. Mom said hello. I said ‘hi’. And by the time she left the room, I had myself gathered together again. Mark seemed unbothered.

‘What do I say to him now that I’m aware of his body? Christ.’

‘I don’t know but he doesn’t seem interested anyway. He might’ve let you suck him off, just because, but it wouldn’t mean anything to him. And now his mom’s home, so that’s not going to happen either.’ Dangerous voice could be nasty when it didn’t get what it wanted. Damn. And now memories of things Mark had said about his girlfriend Julie came flooding in. He wants someone who comes up with fun plans and adventures, not someone who can’t think of anything to say while we stare at sharks.

‘He looks bored, doesn’t he?’

‘Yeah, actually. And his mom probably doesn’t want you hear anyway.’ Now both voices seemed to agree, but not in my favor.

“I think I’m actually gonna go. I got some stuff to get done at home.”

Mark seemed surprised by my sudden declaration of departure after only a short visit. “Oh. Okay. See yah.” I put on my shoes. “Later, dude.” I was out the door unceremoniously and back to my car without running but definitely feeling panicked.

I’m sure that night I must’ve talked to the guy I would eventually date online and pushed these feelings deep deep down, because I don’t recall seeing him for the remainder of the summer. And the following one wasn’t quite the same. He got back with Julie and didn’t have as much time for me, although he did invite me to attend a Matt & Kim concert with them. And I might have attended a house party at his Philly apartment with Emily. We didn’t have a lot of contact after that. By the following summer he was single again and I was not. I likely got swept up in that relationship and lost track of everyone. Him and Emily both.

When I finally made it out to Mark’s apartment again, I was still with Ron, right after his brother had died. Right after Dan had died, and Ron was struggling and I thought it would be a good opportunity for him to have some fun, but he didn’t seem up to it and for whatever reason Mark didn’t seem to like him. Ron wasn’t his usual social self, and all interactions felt very forced and he drank a lot very quickly. But this was not uncommon for him and I didn’t think anything of it until he said he felt sick and started spitting on Mark’s carpet like he was outside. I was getting embarrassed so I babysat him for a while until Mark asked if I wanted to smoke. Emily said she would watch Ron, given she had been hoping that Seth would show up and was disappointed also. I went out on the strange enclosed brick balcony with Mark. The natural rhythm of our friendship returned for a moment, away from the chaos of drunk people inside. We hadn’t been in touch for a while, so we caught up briefly, awkwardly, and I apologized for Ron’s behavior. He was kind about it and said he understood. He knew I was unhappy. So he made me laugh, and for just a moment I smiled at him and he smiled back and I felt something I had never felt before in my life, like a flash of light passed from his eyes to mine and back. And I wanted nothing more in that moment and in my life than to kiss him. I almost did.

‘You can’t’ the voice chastised, and the moment was over. We went inside. He was called over to play pool and Ron said he needed to get sick in the bathroom. When I found him there, he was projectile vomiting all over Mark’s toilet. Mark came in shortly after and looked pissed but helped me clean it up and put Ron in his bed. As the night wound down, I lay awake in Mark’s bed next to Ron, smelling Mark’s pillow and feeling restless. I had displaced Mark to the living room and all I could think about in that moment was how badly I wanted to be next to him in that bed—making out, fucking, cuddling, anything. But this wasn’t right. This isn’t it.

I mused over it into the early hours of the morning, until the battle with myself was won and I had decided that it was time to break up with Ron somehow, and that if he was still awake, maybe I could just be with Mark or tell him how I felt about him. How I already loved him, and felt so happy when he was around. How I felt safe with him. How I wanted more now that I saw the spark.

‘Do it.’

I did some kind of yoga move to exit the bed over a snoring Ron. I crept out into the living room where there were piles of blankets on the floor over sleeping drunks. I wasn’t quite sure which one was Mark, so I sat on the giant windowsill of his studio and stared down at the city lights and the sun rising. Then I started to hear whispering and movement. At first I looked over thinking someone was waking up, but it was more like the sound of two people trying to quietly have sex while their roommate was in the same room. But who…

‘Emily.’

‘No. Why…please no.’ I heard Mark’s voice. Then Emily’s. My stomach turns. I creep past them, because they already know someone was out there. I grab my cigarettes and go outside to the balcony. I smoke and cry until the sun comes up and then I do a once over the toilet Ron wrecked. Ron and I leave with Emily as fast as possible the next day, as one does after a night of drinking when everyone just wants to be hungover at home. I smoked too much and don’t feel great myself, so I snuggle in Ron’s bed the rest of the day. I try to put it out of my mind. I was stupid to think Mark felt anything for me. Stupid to think it would turn into anything and equally desperate not to be alone.

Emily would eventually tell me it happened a couple times with Mark. At first I think they must have feelings for each other, so I default to being supportive and they both confirm that’s not why it happened. Looking back now, I think Emily was continuously disappointed by Seth, who she had been on and off with for so long, and cared for for so long but they had just never gotten together. Seth didn’t come because he was at odds with Mark. And who can guess what was inside of Mark’s head? Of course I like my version in which he feels the same way I do and it hurt that I brought my boyfriend and that we’re sleeping in his bed and Emily is sad too, so let’s just comfort each other. But who really knows.

By the next time I was single, we had graduated college, Mark was living in the city, and since he and Emily slept together, he wasn’t around much anymore. Nor were we really invited over often at all. I spent my time with Emily and the coffee shop crew and tried to stay with Ron until that fell apart. It was one of the worst years of my life and I felt very small. So when I ran into Joey months later, it felt like fate.

The last time I really heard from Mark was when I reached out to him to see if he was going to the highschool reunion. He said no. He said everyone he wants to see he sees. I feel small again. He congratulates me on my engagement to Joey and I don’t know why suddenly telling him hurts so badly, because I’ve been stuffing my feelings down for so long that I forgot I felt that way about Mark. I told myself he was just my friend who I loved dearly. Which is true. But from the moment I said yes to Joey I felt trapped. I tried to make it work, but the truth is, I had felt what love is supposed to be already. And I had denied it for so long that it ceased to mean anything. I had lied to Mark and to myself until I was so insignificant to him that I didn’t even warrant a response in 2023 when I last reached out.

I saw him in passing one day in 2023. I hadn’t expected it. And there he was. And I ran. Again. Because I don’t know what to do with these memories now. All these years later. And I definitely don’t know how to meet him as a stranger. I loved him. And I realized it 11 years too late.",1,1736631221.0,Diary,1,1.0,False

Almost every other customer this morning was just flat out mean, rude, and a pain in the ass. And we were busy but we weren’t even behind! Our drive times at the highest were a minute and mobile/cafe were doing a damn good job at getting orders out on good times. I had someone standing at the end of the bar with an empty cup and I went over to pour a cold brew (I’m on drive bar) and decide to be nice and ask what he’s waiting on. He starts tapping his cup on the counter at me saying he wants a refill. I said oh I’m sorry sir you have to go up to the register for that. He says I already did but here just use this cup and refill it. I say I’m sorry I’m not allowed to do that. My mobile/cafe bar looks over and is like what’s going on and I explain and she says to him I have to do things in sequence but I’ll have it out soon. He rolls his eyes and walks away. 

I go to take someone else’s order a while later and this man comes up to the register on the phone with someone, is trying to order while talking to someone on the phone, hangs up and starts texting someone while I’m trying to get him to pay. He’s literally standing there ignoring me finishing his texts then pulls up his apple wallet. I assume he’s using Apple Pay then and hit card on my register. He pulls up his Starbucks card through the Apple wallet (totally fine) and scans and I’m like oh okay hold on I hit the wrong button. Continues to try and scan THREE TIMES while I’m trying to cancel the card processing and I’m like sir if you could just give me a moment I need to cancel the card processing (every time you scan your card while I have card processing up it just says invalid transaction type). He rolls his eyes and huffs at me. Finally I’m able to hit the button and he leaves. 

Someone comes in in the morning and gets a coffee and leaves. He comes back HOURS later and says he wants his free refill. My coworker at the register was the one who had previously rung him up and gotten his coffee earlier and she asks him if he’s been here all day. He says no and she tells him you can only get a free refill if it’s in the same visit. He looks at her like she’s crazy and say No? And I step in and say you can’t leave the store if you want refills and he goes THATS NOT HOW STARBUCKS WORKS! I say yes it is and turn around and he stomps out. Comes in like 30 mins later with friends and orders new coffees. Betting he called corporate or looked up the refill policy. 

But seriously like what the hell is wrong with people?! If these kinds of Starbucks customers had people come into their work and treat them like this they would be outraged! So why the hell do you think you come in here and treat us like this?! It’s INSANE!!!!!

Hi!

I'm looking for a plant.

To make a long story short, I lost my grandmother in January last year.
Before she passed away, she had unfortunately also become demented and had been for about 5 years.

So I haven't been able to ask her about the name of the flower, as it is a memory I have from my childhood.

When I was a child, I remember my grandmother having a green plant on her coffee table that dripped when it was supposed to rain.

I don't remember exactly what it looked like, other than that it was a green plant without a flower.

However, I have never found out if it was a story and it dripped due to overwatering, for example like monstera, or if it was actually true.

I have questioned my mother, and she remembers the plant and the story, but she also doesn't remember what it was called.

Has anyone heard of such a plant and perhaps knows what it is called?

I would like to get one, in memory of her.

It is NOT a monstera.

I’d spent all my pocket money on the Micra and held off getting a grinder or scale. 

Went down to 3FE coffee shop here in Dublin and the barista there very kindly dialed in and then ground my first bag and she did a great job!

Once, we were on a coffee date, and he was loudly discussing something that upset a nearby homeless man. The man grew angrier, mistaking my partner’s tone as an insult, and approached our table. I kept looking at my partner, hoping he’d act, but he just froze. The man reached our table, shook it, and demanded, “What did you say?!” It wasn’t until I stood up—hot coffee spilling on me—that I managed to calm the stranger down. At home, when I told my partner I didn’t feel safe, he didn’t apologize but instead whined about me not seeing him as “a man.”

About a year later, one of his best friends got drunk during a group night out and groped multiple women, including me. Imagine literally being “grabbed by the p\*ssy” by someone your partner calls a best friend. The girlfriend of the perpetrator later organized private talks with us to confirm what happened. I told my partner beforehand, expecting support, but instead, he told me to “just get over it” and “be cool,” refusing to confront his friend about the assault.

When his uncle’s health declined, my partner moved him in, despite my objections. This man s\*xually harassed me, addressing my breasts when speaking, openly watching porn in my dining room, and exposing himself if caught. I told my partner I’d move out if his uncle wasn’t removed, but he hid in his gaming room every evening, ignoring the situation. I finally left to stay with a friend, and only then did my partner ask his uncle to leave. Though I came back, I had fallen out of love with him by then, yet we stayed together for years and even got engaged.

I should have left the night he drunkenly described how he’d m\*rder me if I ever “betrayed” him. He said he’d forgive me, act like the perfect husband, then k\*ll me with a hammer when enough time had passed, disposing of my body in a national park.

What finally ended things was discovering his open journal on our shared desktop. I needed the dual monitors for work and saw my name in an entry. I shouldn’t have read it, but I found him calling me a “n\*gger b\*tch” and writing vile things about me, his employees of color, and women in general. I made a copy and confronted him, and he begged me not to tell anyone. We broke up and I moved out.

That was 2.5 years ago. Recently, I saw him and became furious at the sight of him. Would I be the asshole if I posted in the local “Are We Dating the Same Guy” forum and shared what I went through?

This Simple Diet Tip Let Me Eat What I Want While Losing Weight!,"At 150kg, I used to think I’d have to cut out half the pantry and live on chicken and salad to lose weight. Or worse, I’d need a food scale to weigh every single thing I ate. Sure, those things might work short term, but they’re not sustainable. And honestly, who wants to live like that forever?

My biggest tip when it comes to dieting is this: you’re looking to make a **lifestyle change**. These fad diets aren’t something you can stick to for life, so why start them in the first place?

Over the years, I’ve put together a super simple framework that helped me lose weight without giving up the foods I enjoy. It’s not magic, and it’s not about eating fried chicken every day (because yeah, let’s be real, that won’t work). It’s all about moderation and balance.

Here’s the framework I follow: every meal should have three key things:

1. **Protein** – like eggs, chicken, fish, lamb, beef, or if you’re vegetarian, lentils or chickpeas.
2. **Carbs** – like potatoes, bread, rice, pasta, or noodles.
3. **Veggies** – pretty much any veg you like: lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber, carrots, broccoli, asparagus… the list goes on.

You pick one of each, and you’ve got a meal that’s filling, balanced, and still lets you eat the foods you enjoy.

For example, let’s say you usually grab a croissant with your coffee in the morning. You don’t need to give it up! Just tweak it a bit. Take your croissant (your carb) and cut it in half. Make an omelette with two eggs for your protein—season it however you like. Then throw together a quick salad with lettuce, cucumber, and tomato, and add a squeeze of lemon juice. Put the salad and omelette inside the croissant, and boom! You’ve got a delicious egg croissant that’s high in protein, full of veggies, and still satisfies your cravings.

Losing weight doesn’t mean you have to miss out on your favorite foods. It’s all about finding ways to make them work for you. If I can lose 40kg this way, you can do it too!",8,1736630149.0,WeightLossAdvice,1,0.83,False

At the same time, I don’t want to waste too much time and risk losing her interest — if there’s any to begin with.


Hey everyone,

I’m in a bit of a dilemma and would love to hear your thoughts.

I’m a 29-year-old male, and there’s this woman I know — she’s a 34-year-old family friend. We often meet at gatherings, and over time, I’ve started to feel like there might be some sexual tension between us. The thing is, I’m not great at reading signs, so I’m struggling to figure out if it’s all in my head or if there’s something more.

Here’s why I think there might be something:

I’ve noticed that when I’m around, she tends to adjust her appearance, like unbuttoning the top of her shirt when I enter the room (which I’ve only realized later through pictures etc).

She often bends over to pick up toys or items when I’m nearby, in a way that feels intentional.

She always tries to hug me when we greet or say goodbye. Even when it’s not really necessary, she seems to linger to get that chance.


But I could be imagining all this, and I really don’t want to misinterpret innocent behavior.

Lately, I’ve been wanting to spend more time with her one-on-one, but arranging that feels tricky. It might look weird if I ask her to meet alone for coffee or something, especially since she has a child. I don’t want to come across as a weirdo or make her uncomfortable.

I’ve been trying to figure out a natural way to be around her in a more relaxed, private setting where we can be more open, but her responsibilities as a mom complicate things.

I do like her, but I’m at a loss on how to proceed without crossing any lines or scaring her off. How can I gauge if she’s interested without making things awkward? And how can I subtly flirt or show interest without overstepping boundaries?

Would love to hear your advice!

Thanks in advance!

TL;DR;
I (29M) think a 34F family friend might be flirting with me through subtle gestures, but I’m not sure if I’m imagining it. I want to get her alone to figure it out, but don’t want to make things awkward. Looking for advice.

When I used nicotine - I would always have a zyn in or be vaping whne driving. When I chewed, I would even put one in for a drive that was less than 10 minutes.

  
When driving after quitting, I would crave it like no other. It was also so tough because I was already out and about, so the temptation to stop at a gas station to pick up a can of zyn was even stronger.

  
It took 3+ month for this to go away. I know that can sound discouraging. I remember when i start my quit and heard people saying they were still having cravings 2-3 months later, I always got almost sad. It sucks. However, I rarely think about it anymore.

Next game I go to I obviously see her and we are looking at each other throughout the game (this is a championship game) her coach calls timeout and during the huddle she turns around and waves and her teammates and coach look at me then look at her and then she got pulled to the side and got benched lol.

1hz5xds,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1hz5xds/never_been_one_of_the_girls/,Never been “one of the girls”,"For my entire high school career, I never felt like I could fit in with the girls in my class. 95% of them are the “popular girls”— yes, they are just one, big group of girls that are all friends and everyone knows them— and the other 5% is the “outcasts,” AKA the artists, non-girly girls, and so on. I go to a private religious school, for context, so the class sizes are small to begin with.
For two years, I tried to be friends with the popular girl group and would stand on the outside of their circle, laughing and playing along. Don’t get me wrong… these girls are actually nice people. They’ve always been kind to me, but we just aren’t real friends. They don’t remember me and don’t invite me events, but it’s not malicious— they just genuinely forget me because I’m so quiet and I don’t speak up when they start to plan things and I hear bits and pieces of their sleepovers and get-togethers and dinners. I always chalked it up to the fact that they all played sports together, but slowly I realized it was deeper than that. Not only do some of the girls not even play sports anymore, but a few of them never did in the first place.
The reason they all get along with each other, and why I’m always on the outside, is that not of them are afraid to talk to each other. They hang on each other, hug each other, laugh together… they are themselves around each other. They have common interests, which helps, but they’re just not afraid of anything when they’re together.
This “power” they have to overcome any sort of societal fear of being judged is *terrifying* as someone with social anxiety. I don’t understand how someone can just be comfortable with who they are and know that their friends aren’t going to judge them. I want to have that, but I’ve never been able to find people that I can truly be myself around.
I always become a “therapist friend,” listening to other people’s ups and downs, thoughts and fears… don’t get me wrong, I love being there for people and helping them. But I’ve never found someone to listen to *me*. When I’ve tried in the past, they just *don’t listen.* They don’t understand, they can’t relate to my crazy mental health problems and unique experiences. They don’t like the same niche hobbies as me. And I fear I’ll never find anyone who does. When I try to open up, the people around me don’t understand what I’m going through and they can only treat me like a little kid with weird behavior.
This past year, the girls in my class have been trying to include me more. They’ve invited me to events— though, they were last minute, and required some extra help getting me in the loop through friends within the group feeling bad that I wasn’t invited— and they’ve been attempting to treat me like one of them. But it feels so artificial. They invite me to a party, buy me a Christmas present, and then don’t speak to me at school other than an occasional “hello” or a smile as they pass in the hall. Just recently, they’ve all been planning to get together at one of their houses before a school dance. Since I’m part of the group chat (only within the past couple weeks did I become part of this group chat), I’ve gotten all the messages. I was excited at first, thinking I’d finally get to get ready with some girls for a dance, have all that kind of stuff that I never experienced growing up. But then my stomach twisted around as I thought about being with them. I know for a fact that being in the same house as them is not going to make me “one of them” or even include me in all of the inside jokes, past memories, and girly talk. I’m always there watching them hang out with each other, but never really part of it. I’m crying while writing this, now, because it’s stupid— this is all I’ve ever wanted, to be part of their group. It’s happening, but now I don’t want to be there. I don’t want to go to their house and just be part of an Instagram post but not their actual memories. They’re all going to forget me in five years. I’ll be on their Instagram feed once in a while, maybe, but I’m not going to be part of what they loved about high school or that group of girls you call up for a chat when we’re all middle-aged and have our own families. It’s terrifying knowing I’m going to be forgotten. I just want to know what it’s like to be one of them. I want to have a girl group that talks about boys and gets coffee after school and lays in each other’s laps at football games and braids each other’s hair on the bus. I want to be “one of the girls.” I’m sick of just being in this void in between the outcasts and the popular kids. I don’t know what I am anymore. I’m a senior now and I’m going to graduate and go to college, but I don’t even know what I want to study anymore. I don’t know what kind of job I’ll have, I don’t know if anyone will want to date me, I don’t know if I’ll make any friends.

1hz5ubt,https://www.reddit.com/r/hysterectomy/comments/1hz5ubt/laparoscopic_assisted_vaginal_hysterectomy_for/,Laparoscopic Assisted Vaginal Hysterectomy for large fibroid - need advice!,"I am scheduled for a Laparoscopic Assisted Vaginal Hysterectomy (LAVH) on 2/20/25. My journey began back in September of 2022. I was 34, had been divorced for a year, knew I didn't want any more kids (I have a soon to be 13 year old), didn't want any oopsies to happen while enjoying being newly single, and had recently lost a friend to ovarian cancer, so I found my gynecologist/surgeon, explained my desire for permanent sterilization and had a bilateral salpingectomy (tube removal) within a couple weeks.

While my surgeon was operating he noticed a ""large fundal fibroid"" per the operative note. We discussed keeping an eye on things as I was healing and could address it later if need be. I had an L5-S1 spinal fusion for scoliosis back in 2016, so was no stranger to lower body pain and probably wouldn't be the best judge of what feels normal or not :) I'm not sure if it was psychological, potentially internal irritation from the surgery itself, or being off hormonal birth control...but a few weeks after my tube removal I began to have pelvic pain (pressure and cramping up even when not on period). I gave myself a few months to heal up and let me hormones re-regulate, but the issues were still there.

Over the course of the next year the symptoms remained. Intermittent pain ranging from pressure, cramping, stabbing pain, searing pain, lots of pain while ovulating on my right side, and then my periods were starting with brown coffee ground like blood. I finally went back to see my surgeon/gynecologist August of 2023 and did an ultrasound and had it officially sized at 3.5 x 3.5 x 3.3 cm. He explained the fibroid was the likely culprit of my symptoms since it was impinging on my endometrial cavity, and would continue causing issues until we did something about it. He provided 4 options: restart birth control to regulate hormones and potentially stop fibroid growth, uterine artery embolization to block blood flow to the fibroid, myomectomy to surgically remove the fibroid, or laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy to be one and done. My symptoms weren't bad enough to warrant surgical intervention, and I really wanted to be hormone free, so I decided to just keep trucking along.

However, by February 2024 the symptoms just continued and I was getting tired of the gross coffee ground periods so I went back for a brief visit and ultrasound. Everything looked very similar, so he provided the same 4 options for treatment. I decided on trying a low dose birth control pill (Norehindrone Acetate 1 mg/Ethinyl Estradiol 0.02 mg) to see if that would help with the periods. After a few months on the pill my pain symptoms seemed to be a little bit better, and the coffee ground blood went away so I was happy. 

Unfortunately, over the span of the past year even on the birth control things slowly began backsliding again. The frequency of the pain episodes became more and more, the coffee grounds didn't come back but my period wasn't ""normal"" I would have a day or two of gross smelling brown ""tissue-like"" stuff, one day of bleeding, and then a few more of the gross stuff.

Beginning in December 2024 the pain went from intermittent to constant. It's not severe by any means, but anybody who has lived with chronic pain knows how draining a constant nagging pain can be. Early in the month I was 12 hours late taking my birth control pill, it was the only time ever that I had been late taking it, but I still ended up having some spotting for a day or so...but then when it came time for my period, it never came! Pain and cramping but no bleeding.

I had my yearly exam with my PA on 1/2/25 and explained what was going on so she sent me in for an urgent ultrasound on 1/3/25 and told me to get in with my gynecologist once I got the results back. Results showed it had increased to 5.3 cm x 4.9 cm x 3.8 cm and was now causing a ""mass effect"" on the endometrium. I knew based off the previous conversations with my gynecologist the 4 options I had, so I did a ton of digging around on the internet and came to the conclusion I needed to just bite the bullet and have the hysterectomy done. My gynecologist and I both kind of laughed as he walked in because I told him the second he was through the door ""I'm ready!"".

I'm on the books now for the laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy on Thursday 2/20/25. With all the research I had done, I went in confident that I wanted to keep my cervix to provide additional pelvic floor support as well as avoid any differences sexually. My gynecologist listened to my points, and said he would leave the cervix if I really insisted, but he said he's only ever left it in 2 of his patients in the 90's when there was an Oprah craze about it, and they both ended up needing to have it taken out later which resulted in a harder surgery to remove due to adhesions from all the cauterization. He gave the usual doctor line of ""if you were my daughter I would tell you to take it all out"". I certainly don't want to be his 3rd patient ever that he leaves it in on, and I don't want to wait another month before I can even get in to see a new doctor for a second opinion (plus then have to wait for surgical availability). I'm slowly accepting my fate as reality is settling in. I'm worried about my recovery, I have 50/50 custody of my son with a 1 week on/1 week off schedule, but when he isn't here I live by myself with 3 old cats. I'm also extremely worried about my sexual life being altered. As someone who didn't orgasm until I was 30, I've been making up for lost time and would be miserable if anything changed.

If you've made it this far and have a similar experience, I have the following questions/concerns:

* Was your sex life/ability to orgasm altered in any way (positive or negative)?
   * My gynecologist promised that the cervix isn't a large source of pleasure (I only orgasm with clitoral stimulation) and that my vagina wouldn't be any longer/shorter/looser/ect.
* What was your recovery like? Like I said before, I'm a single ""part-time"" mom who lives alone and takes care of 3 cats. I'm also in a supervisory position with a lot of responsibility at work, so I can't take a ton of time off. My current plan is to take off 2 full weeks utilizing my state's paid medical leave and then work from home for the 3rd week. I went back after just a weekend after my tube removal, which was stupid and I definitely had a tough week but felt back to normal after about 2 weeks.
   * I plan to have my mom come in from out of town to take me to/from the hospital and probably spend the first night or two home with me. I'll see if my ex can keep my son for an extra couple of days to really just focus on resting, and then my dad who lives about 10 minutes away offered to drive my son to/from school the remainder of the week. I'm hoping I'll be up to driving by the 2nd week.
   * I purchased a long ""grabber"" tool. I had one for my spinal fusion and it was a lifesaver.

I'll post an update once I'm all healed up. I'm hoping it will be an ""ah-ha!"" moment type of experience like I had with my spinal fusion and the nerves are worried are normal. I was terrified to go through the fusion with the odds being stacked against me for a positive outcome but had such a significant reduction in pain after I had the surgery that I always say it was the best decision I ever made (actually tied with LASIK! :)).

1hz5tqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hz5tqx/my_house_keeps_moving_when_im_asleep/,My house keeps moving when I'm asleep ,"Last week I noticed something strange, when I woke up from an abnormally long sleep my house wasn’t where it was supposed to be. I live in the suburbs of salt lake city Utah in a house that’s pretty old but for some reason when I woke up that day my house was in a field.

A wheat field that seemed to stretch endlessly to the horizon. I couldn’t tell if I was dreaming or not so I just got in bed and closed my eyes. The next thing I knew my house was back where it was supposed to be.

Though that wasn’t the last time this happened. About two days later things started to feel off. Everything felt like a dream, as if nothing was real and it was all in my head. But no matter what I did I couldn’t get rid of the feeling.

Yesterday I noticed that all the plants outside were gone. I looked at doorbell camera footage suspecting they were stolen but from what I saw the plants were never there to begin with. I texted my wife who planted said plants but she claimed she has never brought a plant in or around the house since we moved in.

I called my dad asking him about the plants but he said the same thing. I think im starting to go crazy or something because I could have sworn there was two pots in front of the house with some orange and red flowers and a tree out front. In fact now it seemed that my house was the only one without a tree on the property.

Anyways I have decided to write things down and post them online or where ever I put this for now this Is just a note to myself written on a word document.

I got out of bed this morning and had a donut and coffee for breakfast. My wife leaves for her work earlier than me. It makes the mornings peaceful and quiet. But sometimes, especially times like this it makes me feel quite lonely. When I walked out the front door I looked across the street to see my neighbors didn’t have and trees or bushes. As I turned my head and looked down the street I realized no one had any bushes or trees. Everyone gardens were empty patches of dirt bricks laid in circles around nothing.

A feeling of uneasiness filled me but I decided to worry because it was probably just a dream. I debated whether or not I should still go to work or take the day off. As I stood on my front porch it hit me, if I was dreaming I could wake myself up or at least become lucid. I did everything I could but nothing seemed to work. I walked inside and went to lay down for a bit when I hit my hip on the counter “*FUCK”* I shouted out loud.

The sharp agonizing pain or bumping into a marble corner was indescribable it hurt a million times worse than it should have. I looked at my hip and noticed I was bleeding. It wasn’t bad just a small cut but it still hurt enough for me to call it quits for the day.

When I pulled out my phone to call in sick I couldn’t find my bosses contact. And I couldn’t remember his number, and for some strange reason I couldn’t remember his name or hers i completely forgot what they looked like what they sounded like. And then I couldn’t remember where I worked.

I sat down trying to think but I started to question if I even had a job. Nothing felt real and I had no idea what was happening.

I think I just need to get some sleep.

I woke up to loud bang.

I jumped out of bed dazed and confused I was sweating and I couldn’t remember what I was doing asleep so late until I saw my laptop open beside me. I heard footsteps that crept closer to the door. “WHO ARE YOU” I shouted the bedroom door swung open and I saw my wife. “Your home? This early?” I asked “its seven, I’m late.” “oh shit its seven but that doesn’t make any sense. I feel like just two minutes ago I was going to go to work but then some weird stuff happened, and speaking of that I need to tell yo…” “work? You got a job?”

“what do you mean you got a job?”

“you said you were going to work why didn’t you tell me that you got a job?”

“What are you saying I’ve had this job for ten years I- I don’t know what else to say.”

“Are you okay?”

“well no there’s a bunch of weird stuff happening and I’m losing my mind about it”

“like the plants you wont shut up about”

“well yeah but the neighbors don’t have any plants didn’t you see?”

“honey you need to get some rest, I don’t know what has gotten into you.”

“what?”

My wife never called me honey before

“its just you need to sleep”

“I’ve been sleeping. ”

“well okay then. I need to run to the store and buy some dogfood.”

“What? For who?”

“for us silly.”

Her voice sounded strange. Monotone and lacking any emotion at all

“while I’m gone you should really go sleep”

“No, What do you mean for us?”

“for our dog its hungry”

“We don’t have a dog”

She looked at me with a blank stare and said

“I don’t know what your talking about he’s right outside.”

I turned around and looked out the back door and saw a small sheep dog running around on a yard full of dirt I couldn’t remember if there was grass in the backyard and then I started to remember having a dog.

I looked back at my wife and I couldn’t seem to fully recognize her. Her face felt off. I could recognize her voice even the strange way she was talking to me but her face I just couldn’t remember even when looking directly at her. I made myself dinner and went to my bed but my wife never came to join. I shouted her name a few times until I forgot what her name was. It was like I had been shouting gibberish I got out of bed and felt lost.

I walked around the dark house that now felt like I different world and couldn’t find my wife but then it hit me a realization, a fear. I was alone. And I never had a wife. I keep reading this over and over and over again but I cant remember anything I didn’t type in the last five minuets.

I’m losing my mind.

I have decided to just go to sleep and figure things out in the morning.

I woke up around 3 ish in the morning I was cold so I got up to turn on the heater but when I looked outside I saw a forest I ran to every window in the house to be met with the same sight. A pitch black forest, one of those it eats you alive forests. I couldn’t believe what my eyes were seeing I decided to go back to sleep and pray that this was just some weird dream but as I was getting in bed I saw a not on my nightstand it read “*don’t talk to them, don’t listen to them, don't look at them and never leave the house.”*

We’re flying into San Juan and picking up a rental car the next morning. Then driving from San Juan to La Parguera and spending two nights there (bio bay tour is already booked!). I thought about driving down the center of the island, through Utuado on the way to La Parguera. I really want to see some beautiful mountain views while I’m in Puerto Rico. And then returning to San Juan on the route recommended by Google, which goes through Ponce and Cayey. 

Does anyone have any recommendations  about a scenic driving route to La Parguera, with driving that isn’t too difficult? Maybe a coffee plantation on the way that would be a fun stop? 

Any suggestions about hikes near La Parguera and Cabo Rojo would also be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks for any help- this sub has been invaluable in planning my trip and is the reason we chose to go to the west! ",2,1736629447.0,PuertoRicoTravel,0,1.0,False
1hz5ti5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hz5ti5/aita_for_being_mad_that_the_boiler_is_bust/,AITA for being mad that the boiler is bust! ,"I, (f,46) am really cheesed off with my husband (m, 50). I genuinely cannot believe I am writing this. My husband (m, 50) told me to 'fuck off you little witch' after I voiced my opinion because a couple of days ago I warned him of the consequences of not putting our heating on for just a short amount of time and he ignored me and something bad happened. That first day he took heed of my warning but then his 'tiny little man brain ' (in quotes because that is what he calls it, not me) took over and he decided that the financial cost of having the heating on far outweighed the benefits of having it on, so he turned it off. I wasn't asking for much, 15 degrees at worst, but he turned it off anyway. This morning we get up to have a wash before work and he informs me that there is something wrong with the boiler and there is no hot water. He tried for a good half hour and thought the condensate pipe was frozen. After not much investigation, bytheway the boiler is about 5 months old, it is discovered that indeed the pipes are frozen....but on the goddam INSIDE! It is so damn cold inside our home that the pipes have frozen. Inside. I have never heard of such a thing. Inside FFS! 

I tell him that him being stingy with the energy usage is getting beyond a joke. We are NOT short of money. We aren't relying on government grants to bang an extra few quid on the meter, we're totally fine for money. He is just so goddam tight that he REALLY hates paying for utilities (he HSTES utility firms. Don't get me started but his hatred of them is leading to this) and he doesn't care if we starve or freeze doing it. My feet are so cold and damp that my toenails are falling off from mould and I wish that wasn't true but it is. But I told him that he really needs to change things for the sake of our health and he lost his fucking mind. 

Our cat is old and cold. The dog doesn't like being more than 5 inches away from me because it is cold. She has hip dysplasia and arthritis. Husband has arthritis or so he claims so he is aware of how the cold gets to your bones. People comment that it is warmer outside than it is inside and sometimes that feels true. But my husband is such a dick about it that not only does my request seem unreasonable, he makes me sound just downright evil for making a request. He does shut me down often and if I vent and tell him that him ignoring the issue isn't going to sort anything he shuts his eyes and doesn't talk to me again until he feels like it. The amount of time it takes him to get over it can vary from a couple of hours to a few weeks. If he feels I haven't dropped the subject then he will ignore me completely until he thinks I have. I swear, we have given weeks not saying a word to each other when I have raised a subject he doesn't want to talk about! 

Right now am mad, frustrated, a little bit nauseous, and he put my whole 'rant' (after he told me to 'fuck off you little witch!)  down to medication that I take for epilepsy. The dog is literally shivering because it is so fucking cold in here but he won't accept it. 

I'm fucking cold. The house is cold. Mould is growing on the floor, on the walls, on the ceiling and on my feet, but now I feel abusive because I wouldn't accept him telling me to drop it as a reason to escape the inevitable serious chat. 

Btw, whilst moaning about lack of money for bills, he spent £1000 on a camera and equipment, another £1000 on a coffee machine and he just bought 2 laptops at a thousand quid each. That's £4000 he has spent in 2 months and I am a witch for telling him he should rein his spending in because other things need to come first, and a fucking boiler that will stop all of us from freezing to death should definitely come before his morning coffee. Incidentally, getting the beans is too much trouble for him so he sends me. I have no money and can't drive, he controls the money and he has 2 vehicles and I told him that if he got his new gadget then he wasn't passing the responsibility of buying the consumables onto me because I don't have the means he has, and at the first goddam opportunity he got he sent me out in the snow to walk to the supermarket to buy him coffee beans. Why can't he go???? He has legs!!! 

I'm done with this marriage. I work my ass off to provide him with all his wants whilst ignoring my needs. 6 months ago I was due to go for tests to see why I can't tolerate 90% of the food I consume but he won't allow me time off. Have my nails done once a year? Not at that price! I have long hair and he begrudges me a visit to the hairdresser's once a year. BUT I LIKE HAVING LONG HAIR!

I won't go into what the pets think of him but let's just say no matter how angry he tells me I am, the pets still want to be near me. He doesn't feed them or play with them or give them the basics like water or attention. God help them if they need a vet! Too much money and trouble even though they are insured. 

I can't hack it. This post is totally real. I really am this frustrated. My husband really does hate me enough that paying for gas when it is literally freezing inside our room is an expense I don't deserve.

ps. my income is greater than his. We work the same hours but I do all the upkeep like cooking, cleaning, DIY gardening, pet care, shopping etc etc et fucking cetera.  He won't admit it but he resents me for that income. I mean, that money pays for our holidays and everything he says we don't need like cleaning supplies and new underwear. He gets proper resentful if I spend my money on myself, which I don't understand because A, I have never said no to anything he ever wanted from any of our monies past or present (am taking £600 for a computer chair. Every penny of our savings for a sports car. Every single gadget known to man is dumped in a corner in our house somewhere and B, I only spend what I have spare after bills, essentials, insurances and savings and everything he says I need to pay. His gifts come from this budget and his gift wants often run into 4 figures. My 'extra' income is £300 a month, he gets the rest of anything we both earn and any profit, plus tax rebates and anything else. In return I get him pointing at my to do things even when I am already doing 3 other things that he doesn't want to do because it's boring! 

AITS for saying 'i love you but you aren't worth risking death for. I know what our vows meant but it doesn't mention anything about sitting in silence in a stone cold room in the middle of winter just because your husband holds a personal grudge with any and all utility companies.

I used to be on 100 mg, and at that point of my life, I had to drop out of my PhD, could barely handle going to the store, and broke up with my girlfriend. 

After going down to 75 mg, i have been able to handle more activities, however i feel like my stress levels and overstimulation are still high. 

I want to hear about what happened when you changed from 75 or 100 mg to 50 mg in the long run. 


( backstory to why i am asking is below)

I plan to tell my doctor the following symptoms I've been having every day. 

1) wake up
2) feel a lot of weird things in my body. Which is then accompanied or caused by slight to moderate anxiety. Most morning i am feeling nauseous latelty, but that goes away around noon or so, latelty. Sometimes i end up throwing up or gagging from the nausea. After i know i can take my medicine, i take my pristiq and losartan. 
3) an hour after taking medicides im still a little sensitive to the feelings, and then ill start to pee more often for a few hiurs. I will also get warmer at this time. Slightly anxious/overstimulated still. This lasts for about 2 more hours. 

I have also noticed that after workouts i would get overstimulated also and feel down, causing me to have trouble working out 

I also stopped eating choclate and stopped drinking coffee over a year ago because the overstimulation and/or anxiety would be elevated at a higher level for days after consuming these things. 


I expect that my dosage will be lowered, and I want to know if it's worth it or if I should just be switching meds, etc. But I also really want to hear your stories, since as of now, I'm planning to try the 50 mg dosage if my doc thinks it's a good idea. ",1,1736629334.0,Pristiq,0,1.0,False

You know that feeling when you start a side project and tell yourself ""2-3 months max""? Well, 9 months and countless coffee-fueled weekends later, I'm excited to announce that Atomin, my habit tracking app, is finally live! 🎉

My wife (who's a designer) looked at my initial UI mockup and said ""Oh honey... no."" So she redesigned everything, giving me what she calls ""fun little design challenges"" - which is designer-speak for ""make this pixel-perfect or sleep on the couch.""

**What's Atomin?**

* A beautifully crafted habit tracker inspired by atomic habits
* Features a fancy calendar UI that my wife designed and I spent way too many hours implementing
* Tracks your habits with beautiful visualizations
* Sends push notifications (that actually work, which felt like a bigger achievement than my college degree)
* Lets you share your achievements (because if a habit streak isn't shared, did it really happen?)

**Tech Stack:**

* Flutter (obviously 😄)
* Riverpod + Hooks for state management
* Internationalization
* [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/) for backend
* Lots of tears and Stack Overflow visits

The real MVP feature? It actually ships with working dark mode! 🌙

**The Indie Dev Journey:** Between my full-time job, family life, and this project, I've learned that:

1. ""I'll work on it this weekend"" means ""I'll stare at the code for 20 minutes then take a nap""
2. Git commits at 3 AM are never a good idea
3. The hardest bug to fix is always in the ""simple feature that will take 5 minutes""

But hey, we made it! Would love for you all to check it out and share your feedback. Every download makes those 9 months worth it (and helps justify all those times I told my wife ""I'm almost done, just one more feature!"")

**Download Links:**

* iOS: [App Store Link](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/habit-tracker-atomin/id6738307621)
* Android: [Play Store Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.devcat.habitus&pcampaignid=web_share)

**What's Next?** Besides fixing whatever bugs you all find (please be gentle), I'm planning to add more features and improvements. Your feedback will help shape the app's future!

For anyone else juggling a full-time job while building their dream app - keep pushing! If I can do it, you can too. Just... maybe don't promise your spouse it'll only take 2 months 😅

Let me know what you think! I'm here for any questions, feedback, or to share war stories about fighting with Riverpod unit tests at 2 AM.",2,1736629227.0,indiehackers,5,1.0,False

I’ve been reading posts on this subreddit for a little bit and after being told by my roommate to post about the situation I find myself in, here I am. 

	I met Rob through some mutual friends in college when he was sitting with them before their English class, I had my class before them so sometimes I would sit and talk with the group before heading to another class. I’m what you would call a Chatty Kathy, so even when it would just be him, and I had time, we would talk about our mutual interests. After a while he followed me on Instagram and we would have conversations, I’m not huge on social media so when he asked for my phone number so he could talk to me more easily, I thought nothing of it. At this point our conversations were short and sweet but nothing was really growing from there, that is until, the farmers market. 

	I don’t go to the farmers market often, but that morning I had plans to that I hadn’t told anyone about but my roommate. I’m walking along having my manic-pixie-dream-girl time and I see Rob standing at a stall waving at me. I stop to talk to him, his mother, sister, and friend, after a bit of pleasant conversation we part ways and I went off to continue shopping. As I am walking out of the market, I see him at a different stall and we talk for a little bit until he invites me to come get coffee with his group at a local coffee shop, me, “down to clown” as we youths say, accept and we have a nice time. After this though, Rob would text me multiple times a day, and at this point I could see what was happening. 

	For some added context: I have never been in a relationship with a man, I’m not one for labels (aside from the fact that I am 100% Asexual) as my attractions lie in someone’s personhood over their physical appearance or what they have going on downstairs, and while objectively Rob is conventionally attractive (this becomes relevant later), I was more so interested in the things he told me he liked and our similar senses of humor. 

	After a few more days of talking, Rob invites me over to his family’s house for a get together with some of his friends and family. I went and met his friends, who were to say the least, guys in their early 20s. They’re good guys but I could also feel the divide of me being the only female presenting person in the group becoming apparent. Little things like saying a joke I said earlier and it suddenly becoming much funnier, not including me in conversations about things like fishing (even though I’ve grown up in the same area as them and done the same things), and other things that I’ve come to expect living in the body that I do. After I had gone home I got the message I knew was coming, Rob asked me out on a date. I accepted, and we had plans to go to a nature trail near where I lived, but unfortunately my manager at work added a shift to my schedule right for the time that we were supposed to go. I called in a rain check and we were both bummed out to say the least. This, however, brings us to our first date.

	I needed to get a new sports bra, and what do you know! Victoria’s Secret was having a sale. But the thing is, I’m not about to tell this man that. So when we were talking about our plans for the day, I said that I was going to the mall to go to the bookstore. Rob decides that he’s going to come with, doesn’t ask, and asks what time he should meet me there. I panic, I can’t meet him there and be walking around with the red seasonal bag that everyone sees but no one mentions. So I told him to meet me there 30 minutes after I planned to arrive so that I could go, do my shopping, run to my car to hide my purchase and come back and meet him. We walk around the mall and go into the classic stores, Hot Topic, Spencers, the like. He is really interested in the graphic tees and is struggling to decide which one to get, eventually I help him come to the decision and he gets me a matching shirt, when I tell you Reddit, this shirt is not my personal taste, but he wanted to do something kind for me, and even after offering to pay for it myself, he insists on getting it for me. We agree to wear them out one day and leave it at that. He then lets me know that he’s planning on taking me to dinner afterwards to this restaurant I’d never been to but he really likes. I was just planning on going home but didn’t want to hurt his feelings so I went. I have a few very serious food allergies, and this man chose a place where he knew I would be able to get dessert. Which as anyone with food allergies knows, is a big deal. We have dinner and there’s great conversation, albeit a few moments where he was on his phone and asked a few questions that you really shouldn’t be asking, like how much I weigh. The date ends and he walks me to my car, something of note my dinner was safe for me to eat but his dinner included one of my big allergens. When we got to my car he kissed me, and then he kissed me again. Getting traces of his dinner onto my lips. As I was driving home I started to feel really ill, and when I got home everything just got worse. I’ve chalked it up to him just not realizing, which sucks but we can talk about it later. 

	Ever since the first date he texts me 24/7, the things he started sending were sweet, good morning/night texts, asking how I was and what I was doing that day, we went out again to a restaurant and I insisted on paying, which made him uncomfortable. He told me it was because of the way he was raised, and that being a gentleman was to the core of his being, but I didn’t want him to be the only one contributing financially. I was able to pay, he’s used the excuse of me having rent to pay, and cats to feed, which I do but I also budget very strictly and work full time on top of being a student, so my “fun budget” is a pretty sizable amount. The second date went as well as can be expected, and we left it there with plans to go out the following week.

	The day of our third date comes and I wake up feeling horrible. I’m absolutely exhausted, congested, and really just needed to rest. I texted him to let him know that there was no way I was going to be up for going out to the nature trail that he wanted to go to that day. He was bummed but understood, and would later let me know that he might have been the one to have gotten me sick because he just had a really strong immune system (I am immunocompromised) and he had a stuffy nose on our second date. We left it at that and my roommate and his boyfriend offered to take me to go get soup to help with my ailments, Rob and I had been texting on and off between my naps and I mentioned that my roommate and I were going to get food. After I sent this text it was radio silence from Rob for the rest of the afternoon. I decided to open Instagram later on and saw on Rob’s close friends story that he had posted a rant about how he hated the fact that he overthought about everything. I was concerned to say the least so I responded to it and asked what was wrong, this is when he sent me a rather long text about how he was upset that I went out with my roommate for food and that he felt like he was being used, and that he knows it’s probably not like that but his brain keeps telling him it is. 

	Now, if you didn’t catch it before, my roommate is a man, who is in a very happily committed relationship, with another man. I am very close with them both, to the point where they call themselves my “gay dads.” In no world is it a possibility that anything like what he was implying would happen. I explained this to him while also coming from a side of understanding of how I could see why it might come across that way. I offered to not go out with them as much, and to let him know where we were going and what we were doing. In hindsight I should have handled going out with them better, we could have ordered food in so it didn’t look like that but as they say, hindsight is 20/20. I offered to see him the next day, I said we could go to the bookstore, (I’ll admit I wanted to see the kind of books he read.) and I was anticipating him telling me that he was taking me to lunch during the date, which he did. But I was still recovering from the day before, I did not have a lot of energy, I was up for going to 2 places max. Rob said while we were at the bookstore that he wanted to take me to another place so he could look for a spear for spear fishing, a bit out of the way but ok. We get to the store, and he takes me to the gun section and starts going in depth about his interest in firearms, now, I was raised in the country, I know how to handle guns safely, but I also grew up in the American eduction system, and guns freak me out. I was uncomfortable but we left for lunch and he wanted to go to another fishing and hunting store to walk around after. At this point I was exhausted and the thought of walking around anywhere felt impossible, but I didn’t want to say no so I went, after we got through that, he took me to an ice cream shop, at this point I had been asking if he could take me home for a bit, but he wanted to just add more and more things to the itinerary. It got to the point where we were in his car (he insists on driving everywhere) and I was begging for him to take me home but he wanted to talk and I suspect do more for a little bit, but eventually I got home and was able to take a nap. 

	Now we get to the phone call. I was at work and he started calling me before I texted him that I could call him later. He said that he wanted to talk about something with me. After a long day at work I got home, and the phone call that ensued was interesting. As you’ve read previously, I am Asexual. I’m not into anything like that and have been clear about that with any partner I’ve had, however, if intimacy is something that my partner wanted for the aspect of closeness, I don’t know if that would be completely off the table, it would be a situation that I would have to be in to know how I would react. Rob called me and to spare you the details, he is into things. The things he was describing felt as if they were centered around control of my life. I just don’t know how to feel. I know that I’ve spent a lot of this post pointing out what should be red flags, but he does genuinely have great qualities. He’s a great cook, he’s a gentleman, he’s perfect on paper.

We got home on Tuesday and aside from taking our dog out for a car ride (she's an old lady), I have been stuck in the house crying. My mom wanted me to get some fresh air, so we planned on going to a couple stores and then getting coffee. I ended up breaking down and crying in the middle of the first store when I saw a photo album and thought about how the only photos we would have in our family album are of us with our angel baby. We went home after that and I'm back under a blanket crying. I know this pain is just temporary, but it feels never ending.

So wondering would you go to a like a let's make a dinner party.  So getting ready to move and start college will be living  alone.   I know it will be hard to make friends. 


So wondering how it would be to like safety meet some other girls then maybe have a let's meet and have a cooking party.   I really love to cook things then I was thinking how cool would it be if we like small thing like 4-6 other girls to cook with. We could fight lonely with food. 


Does it sound like it would be fun feel kind of afraid but then would before cooking together. Go get coffee or something first I guess.   I don't know really trying to learn and think of things

1hz5lxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_erepresent/comments/1hz5lxo/the_best_spa_treatments_to_boost_your_skin_health/,The Best Spa Treatments to Boost Your Skin Health,"Healthy, glowing skin is a cornerstone of beauty and confidence, and spa treatments can play a vital role in achieving and maintaining this goal. Beyond the relaxing ambiance of a spa, specialized skin treatments are designed to nourish, rejuvenate, and restore your skin’s natural radiance. Whether you're looking to combat signs of aging, improve hydration, or address specific concerns, here are the best spa treatments to boost your skin health.

# 1. Facials for Deep Cleansing and Rejuvenation

Facials are a classic and effective spa treatment for improving skin health. Tailored to individual skin types, facials cleanse deeply, exfoliate dead skin cells, and hydrate the skin. Many facials also include gentle massages that promote circulation, leaving your skin refreshed and radiant. Whether you have dry, oily, or combination skin, facials can be customized to meet your unique needs.

# 2. Chemical Peels for a Youthful Glow

Chemical peels are an excellent option for addressing issues like uneven skin tone, acne scars, or fine lines. These treatments use safe acids to remove the outer layer of dead skin cells, revealing smoother, healthier skin underneath. With varying levels of intensity, chemical peels can be adapted to suit both beginners and those seeking deeper rejuvenation.

# 3. Microdermabrasion for Smooth Skin

Microdermabrasion is a non-invasive exfoliation treatment that uses a fine abrasive tool to gently buff away the top layer of skin. This technique stimulates collagen production and improves texture, leaving your skin feeling soft and looking vibrant. It’s especially effective for minimizing pores, reducing sun damage, and smoothing fine lines.

# 4. Hydrating Masks and Wraps

If hydration is what your skin needs, hydrating masks and wraps are a perfect solution. These treatments use nutrient-rich products to infuse moisture into the skin, restoring elasticity and combating dryness. Ingredients like hyaluronic acid, aloe vera, and seaweed are commonly used to nourish and revitalize the skin, leaving it plump and healthy.

# 5. LED Light Therapy for Skin Repair

LED light therapy is a cutting-edge treatment that uses different wavelengths of light to address a range of skin concerns. Blue light helps combat acne by killing bacteria, while red light stimulates collagen production and reduces inflammation. This painless, non-invasive treatment enhances skin repair and promotes a youthful complexion.

# 6. Collagen-Boosting Treatments

Collagen is essential for maintaining firm, youthful skin, and certain spa treatments are designed to stimulate its production. Treatments like radiofrequency therapy or collagen-infused facials help improve skin elasticity, reduce wrinkles, and promote a smoother appearance.

# 7. Exfoliating Body Scrubs

While most focus on facial treatments, body scrubs are an excellent way to improve the skin’s health across your entire body. These treatments exfoliate dead skin cells, improve circulation, and leave your skin feeling soft and silky. Scrubs often use ingredients like sugar, salt, or coffee grounds for a refreshing and invigorating experience.

# 8. Anti-Aging Treatments

For those looking to combat signs of aging, anti-aging spa treatments like vitamin-infused facials, dermaplaning, or oxygen therapy are great options. These treatments focus on reducing fine lines, improving skin tone, and restoring a youthful glow.

# 9. Detoxifying Mud or Clay Wraps

Mud and clay wraps are excellent for detoxifying the skin. These treatments draw out impurities, tighten pores, and leave your skin feeling smooth and refreshed. They also improve circulation and help your skin absorb essential nutrients.

# 10. Aromatherapy-Infused Skin Treatments

Combining the benefits of aromatherapy with skin care, these treatments use essential oils to nourish the skin and calm the mind. Popular oils like lavender, rose, and chamomile not only hydrate the skin but also create a deeply relaxing experience.

Regular spa treatments tailored to your skin’s needs can dramatically improve its health and appearance. By incorporating these therapies into your skincare routine, you can achieve a radiant and youthful glow that reflects your inner vitality.

It just dawned on me that green coffee storage might contribute to my coffee being bitter and/or grassy.

Does it make sense that if i’m storing my coffee beans in my non-climate controlled garage, that the outside of the bean gets way more roasted than the middle of the bean? Granted, i already know that’s the case but wouldnt the temp discrepancy between the outside of the bean and the inside of it be worse if the bean were stored in 30ish and below temperatures?",1,1736628789.0,roasting,4,1.0,False

This take might sound kinda silly but i just need to know you guys opinions on this cuz im kinda confused on what I should feel. So I (21M) have a guy best friend (21M) and im also Bi if that is important, well not really best friends anymore as we arent as close as we were once was but you get the point. Starting our college days we enrolled in the same city but not the same university and he’d take me to go on places and tell me he would take me there soon and it would be his treat. That went on for like after every if our hangouts but I noticed that he did not really give that same treatment to our other friends but I did not mind it much. Then he went overseas for a vacation and he then told me he would take me there so he could give me a tour cuz he wants me to experience what he experienced. I know it sounds normal but the way he said it to me seemed not in a “friend” way. 

After some time I began to get too busy and drained from my exams in university that we did not really hang out anymore. Our last ever hangout was when we studied together in a cafe then went out to eat korean bbq and he acted like he was my partner and he acted kind of shy which was the first time I ever saw him like that. After eating we went to get some coffee before we leave. When we got our coffee he just acted very much like a gentleman and waited for me to be able to get home. And i know it is normal for friends to do that but idk it just felt different. He didnt act the same towards me and our other friends. After like I think 1-2 years we didnt really talk and I never thought of him once, I suddenly get a dream where it was only me and him doing “stuff” and mind you I never saw him that way since I see him as the close friend that I watched over since we were 9. I only saw him like a brother but after that dream it made me look back on all the things we had done and makes me confused. Help a brother out",1,1736628491.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

You ever find yourself lookin' back, ponderin' how everything went to hell? Here in what's left of Longview, TX, it's hard not to reminisce about when it all began. People had their theories on what would bring the downfall. It wasn't zombies takin' charge, nor aliens. No catastrophic disease wiped us out. It was greed plain and simple. Greed that brought it all down. And who am I foolin'? I was as guilty as anyone. As long as I had my peace, didn't much care 'bout the world beyond. 

It all unfolded so gradual, sneakin' up on us. Things just kept gettin' worse. Folks takin' from folks, government squeezin' every dime, taxes creepin' up while wages stayed put. It all boiled over into an economic collapse, not enough to go 'round for everyone. People started pickin' sides based on their politics and soon enough, fists started flyin'. Government thought they could clamp down with martial law, but that only fueled the fire. Somewhere along the way, it turned into a full-blown Civil War. While we were busy tearin' each other apart, a few other nations saw their chance. They jumped in, one after another, and before we knew it, the whole damn world was at war. Alliances formed, and it was like the final straw breakin' the camel's back. As nations fought, their own people turned on each other. By the time the dust settled, there weren't many left, at least here in America. 

 

 

**Entry 2 The Start** 

 

Well, reckon I oughta start at the beginning. 'Bout eight years back, the whole world went to war, and that's when everything started unravellin'. Society just collapsed under the weight of it all. 'Round here in the states, ain’t much left but ruins and assholes. 

Folks got desperate real quick. Cities turned into battlegrounds, and the countryside weren't much better. Those of us left, we had to fend for ourselves. Scavengin' what we could, watchin' our backs every damn minute. It was survival of the fittest, and luckier than most, I reckon. 

It was downright horrific at first, but now it’s just plain sad. Seein' how low folks can stoop is heartbreakin'. At the start, it was easier to keep clear of the chaos. Didn’t have to go far to find someone lookin' to take from others. I stayed on the move, stickin' to them old farm roads and logging trails. Folks didn’t venture out that way 'til they'd picked the land clean of anything worth takin'. 

Them days, it was a sight easier to get 'round. Gasoline hadn’t gone sour yet. Could fill up the tank and drive for miles without worryin' 'bout runnin' dry. Now, you gotta scavenge for every drop, prayin' it won't clog your engine worse than it already is. Seems like every little thing's just a bit harder now. 

Ah, hell, I reckon I've rambled on enough in this journal. The only reason I'm putting pen to paper is to hold onto a semblance of sanity. I believe it's time for me to retire for the night. 

 

**Entry 3 The Present** 

 

Woke up this mornin’ to the sound of birds chirpin’. Funny how somethin’ so normal can feel like a luxury these days. Stepped out of my makeshift shelter and took a deep breath of the crisp morning air. The sun was just peekin’ over the horizon, casting long shadows over the broken buildings and tangled weeds of what used to be a bustling town. 

Had to remind myself to stay alert, even in moments of quiet. Danger’s always lurkin’, whether it’s other folks lookin’ to take what ain’t theirs or just the unforgiving nature of this new world. Made my way to the outskirts of town, hopin’ to find some supplies left behind. Been hearin’ rumors about a group settin’ up camp nearby. Don’t know if they’re friend or foe, but reckon it’s worth findin’ out. 

As I walked, memories of better times kept driftin’ back. Sunday barbecues, laughin’ with friends, the simple joy of a cold beer on a hot day. Hard to believe how much has changed. Sometimes feels like a whole different lifetime. But there ain’t no goin’ back, only forward. 

After searchin' around for a few hours, I managed to scrounge up some cans of veggies and a couple of batteries. Ain’t sure if they work yet. Still hopin' to find a handheld radio, maybe catch a signal, see if anyone’s out there. Don’t much fancy interactin' too much, but it's hard to keep a grip on reality when the only company you got is the trees.  

Won’t be too long 'fore I have to up and move again. Don’t wanna be found out by any groups. Thinkin' I’ll head on into the Angelina National Forest. Ain’t too far a trip from Longview. Pretty sure there's still some cabins out there, and the wildlife should be plentiful. Hopin' I can stay there a spell without too much worry. 

 

**Entry 4 Others** 

 

'Bout halfway to the Angelina National Forest, I came across a family broke down on the side of the road. A father, mother, and their kid. Must've given 'em quite a scare, but trust's a rare commodity these days. They were havin' car trouble, so I offered to help in exchange for some trade. They didn't have much to offer except information. Turns out, they were runnin' from that group settin' up near Longview. Guess they weren’t good people after all. 

Anyhow, these folks didn’t seem too bad. After takin' a good look under the hood, I figured out they'd thrown a rod. Ain’t no fixin' that, so I told 'em where I was headin' and offered to let 'em tag along till we find another ride. After loadin' them and their stuff up, we headed out. 

Some time passed in awkward silence, and I was getting’ tired of it, so I popped in an old CD and lit up a smoke. You should’ve seen their faces. I thought they were angry ‘bout me smokin’ with the kid in the truck, but nope—they just hadn’t heard music in a long while. 

After a bit more drivin', while they enjoyed the music, we happened upon Center, TX. Used to be a peaceful, small country town, but now... it’s just dilapidated. Figured this was as good a place as any to try and find them a ride of their own. 

We looked ‘round for a while and found some decent stuff. Managed to spot a car that'd fit them and their belongings. It ain’t runnin', but I reckon I can fix it. After some more scavenging, I found a local mechanic shop and gathered the parts I needed. It’d take a bit of time, but it should do the trick. 

Spent the last few hours of daylight workin’ on that car, getting’ my hands greasy and sweat drippin’ down my face. The family pitched in where they could, passin’ tools and keepin’ watch. The father—turns out his name’s Jim—was a real help, and his wife, Mary, kept their boy, Tommy, busy. Kid’s got a curious mind, kept askin’ questions ‘bout what I was doin’. 

As the sun dipped below the horizon, we decided to set up camp for the night. Found a safe spot and got a little fire goin’. The warmth and the crackle of the flames made it feel almost normal for a while. We finally made proper introductions. Jim’s a mechanic, which explained his knack for helpin' out with the car. Mary used to be a nurse, and little Tommy was just eight years old, full of questions and wide-eyed wonder despite everything. 

Over the fire, we shared what little food we had, and stories too. Jim and Mary talked about their life before things went to hell—Jim’s love for old cars and Mary’s passion for helping people. They’d been on the move for months, always lookin’ over their shoulders. 

I told ‘em a bit about myself, too. How I’d been wanderin’, tryin’ to stay clear of trouble, and how I ended up in Longview. There was a comfort in the simplicity of the conversation, a reminder of what it meant to be human. 

As the fire burned low, we all settled into a weary but peaceful silence. It wasn’t much, but it was a connection, and in these times, that was worth more than gold. Tomorrow, we’d see if the car would run, but for tonight, we had each other and a flicker of hope. 

As the sun peaked over the horizon, I rose and coaxed the fire back to life. Luck had been on my side—I'd managed to scavenge some coffee yesterday, so it was shaping up to be a mighty fine morning. After brewing myself a cup cowboy style, I returned to the car and put the finishing touches. With a quiet prayer, I turned the key and she started right up. The rumble of the engine must've startled Jim and Mary awake, prompting them to rush out to see what was happening. I couldn't help but grin as they came over, their faces a mix of surprise and relief. 

 

**Entry 5 Separate Ways** 

After a quick breakfast, I helped them load their things into the newly fixed car. As we worked, they asked if I had any plans for settling down somewhere. I shook my head and told them I didn’t feel safe settlin’ down anywhere for too long. This world had a way of turnin’ on you when you got too comfortable.  

They nodded, understanding my reasons, and we exchanged farewells. I watched them pull away, a small knot of worry forming in my chest as I saw them disappear down the road. I shook my head, trying to clear away the unease, and turned my focus back to the task at hand—scavengin' what I could. I needed to gather enough supplies to make it through the mild winter that was on its way. 

 

**Entry 6 Unexpected Freeze**

 

You ever get that feelin' like you’ve got everything lined up just right, and then Mother Nature comes along and throws a damn wrench in the works? Yeah, well, seems this winter’s decidin' it ain’t gonna be mild after all. Temps are already droppin' below freezin'. Got me a bit agitated, I’ll admit, but at least I found myself an old log cabin with a wood-burnin' stove and a decent pile of seasoned firewood. Small victories, I rreckon. 

Here’s hopin’ I got enough food to stretch if I ration it right. Huntin’ ain’t gonna do me no good in this weather, and there sure as hell ain’t no wild fruits around either. Might have to make the trek into town, see if there’s any old cans left on the shelves, maybe even find me some books. One way or another, I gotta ride this out.  

Wouldn’t ya know it, while I was in town, it started snowin’. Snow! Can you believe that? I can’t recall the last time we saw snow in this part of Texas. Mother Nature sure has her mean streak, don’t she? Still, I managed to scrounge up a few more cans of food and even found some books I’m lookin’ forward to. Guess it ain’t all bad. 

Reckon it'll be a spell before I jot anything down in this old journal again. Figured I'd just sit back, read, and take it easy ‘til spring rolls around. Here's hopin' nothin' comes along to throw a wrench in that plan—knock on wood. 

 

**Entry 7 Wrench in The Plans** 

 

Damn it, damn it all to hell! I done jinxed it. Of course another group of survivors just had to be in the area, and of course they just had to see the damn smoke of my fire. How long they’ve been here; I’ve no damn clue, but now they’re asking me to house them in this cramped little cabin. There ain’t many of ‘em just five, but that five more then I wanted to see. There are two men ones older probably in his fifties, the other a bit younger, thirties maybe. Then the three women, looks like they range from maybe twenty to late forties. I really don’t wanna deal with them, but if they keep botherin me I might have to do something. 

 

**Entry 8 Trouble** 

 

Well, they went and made the damn choice for me. I stepped out for a bit, just to clear my head and shake off some of that cabin fever. When I came back, there they were—crowded 'round my place, hootin' and hollerin', makin' all sorts of demands. Talkin’ big ‘bout how I needed to share my food and shelter, as if I owed 'em somethin’. Far as I could tell, none of 'em had a gun, so I raised my rifle and let off a shot into the air, just to shut ‘em up. That got their attention real quick. They tried arguin’, throwin’ all kinds of reasons at me, but I weren’t havin’ none of it. I’d already made it crystal clear—I ain’t helpin’ ‘em. As I stood there, watchin' their faces shift from shock to anger, I knew I had a choice to make. These folks might not have guns, but desperation makes people do crazy things. We stood there, locked in a stare down, until one of 'em got bold. But a well-placed warning shot had him stoppin' dead in his tracks—funny how a bullet whizzin' past your head'll do that. I made it real clear the next one wouldn’t be a warnin', and they best be leavin’. Guess they finally caught on that I wasn’t messin' around. That night, I rigged up some simple alarm traps, just in case they came back. They didn’t. But now I reckon I’ll have to find another spot to ride out the winter ‘fore things really take a turn for the worse. 

 

**Entry 9 The Search**

When the sun finally decided to peek back out, I stepped outside with a new mission—find somewhere even more secluded. As I wandered, my boots hittin' the 147 bridge, I stopped and glanced out over Sam Rayburn Lake. That’s when I saw ‘em—small islands scattered across the water, sittin’ there quiet as could be. Can’t rightly figure why I didn’t think of it sooner. Guess even I ain’t above a little foolishness now and then.

With that idea stuck in my head, I set off to search every lake house I could find, intent on scroungin’ up a boat. If I could just get myself to one of those islands, I reckoned I’d be sittin’ real pretty. Trouble was, findin’ a boat wasn’t the problem—fixin’ one up was. Most of ‘em were rusted out or had seen better days, and even if I could get one runnin’, there weren’t no guarantees it’d hold up. Seemed to me the best bet was somethin’ simple, like a canoe or maybe a little rowboat. Just somethin’ I could load up my gear and paddle my way out to some peace and quiet.

 

**Entry 10 New Home**

 

After another restless night at the cabin, I figured there wouldn’t be a second chance to leave without trouble followin’. So I made my mind up—time to move on. I headed to that lake house where I’d spotted the best-condition john boat of the lot. The motor on it was shot, so I tore it clean off and set out huntin’ for a pair of paddles. Didn’t take me long to find some, and soon enough, they were tossed in the bed of my truck, along with everything worth takin’ from the cabin. Hell, I even wrestled that stubborn wood-burnin’ stove out of there. That fight nearly got the better of me, but I wasn’t about to leave behind somethin’ that could mean the difference between survivin’ and freezin’.

Course, it’s a fool’s errand to think I’ll get all this across in one trip. That little boat’ll take some back-and-forth haulin’, no two ways about it. But I’ve already picked my destination—a small, lonely island sittin’ about forty-five minutes out from the nearest shoreline. Secluded, outta sight, and far enough from anyone wanderin’ too close for comfort. If I can make it there, maybe—just maybe—I’ll find myself some peace.

Well, I’ll be damned—it’s like I done hit the jackpot. After rowing so hard I nearly threw my back clean out, I finally reached the island, and what do I find? A house already sittin’ there, like it’d been waitin’ on me all along. And not just any house, mind you. This place must’ve belonged to some rich son of a gun. It's massive, with those floor-to-ceiling windows like you’d see in one of them fancy magazines. Gonna have to board those up quick-like, though—they’re just askin’ for trouble. Strangest thing is, for all the time it’s been out here, it ain’t taken much of a beatin’ from the weather. Lucky me, I reckon.

Got all my gear hauled over in just a couple of days and made sure to stash my truck good and out of sight. While I was snoopin’ around the place some more, I struck gold again—found a stash of fishing gear tucked away. Reckon I’ll be sittin’ pretty here for the rest of the winter. Hell, might even finally crack open those books I’ve been meanin’ to read, the ones I had to set aside when that cabin got all riled up.

I can picture it now: sittin’ by a nice campfire, line in the water, just takin’ it all in. Lord knows I ain’t fished in years, but somethin’ about this feels right, almost like it’s a bit of normal pokin’ through all this mess. Could even see myself stickin’ around past winter. For the first time in a while, it feels like I might’ve found a place worth callin’ home.

 

**Entry 11 Spring**

Well, spring’s crept in, though it ain’t in no hurry to make itself known. The snow’s been gone for a spell—it never sticks ‘round long in these parts—but the chill’s still hangin’ on like it don’t know when to quit. Probably be a couple more weeks before it starts to feel like spring proper. These last few months, though, they’ve been peaceful enough. Got plenty of readin’ done, which was a nice change of pace, but I’ll tell you one thing—I’m downright sick of fish. If I don’t see another scaly bastard for a good long while, it’ll still be too soon.

Still, this island’s been good to me, but I’m thinkin’ it’s about time to move on. Cabin fever’s settin’ in, and I need to see somethin’ other than these trees and this lake. First thing’s first, though—I’ll need to check on the truck and see if she’ll even start.

 

**Entry 12 Moving On**

Hours later, there I was, yelling and cussing at that damn truck like it owed me money, blood dripping from my knuckles where the wrench had slipped and sent ‘em crashing into the frame. It felt like the truck was winning this fight, and let me tell ya, I don’t take kindly to losing—not even to an old hunk of metal. I’d been wrestling with the fuel filter, and it was putting up one hell of a battle.

Before that, I’d spent more time than I care to admit scrounging up a working battery and airing up the tires. You wouldn’t think finding something as simple as a damn battery would be so hard, but nothin’s easy these days. Anyway, by the time the sun started to set, I’d about hit my limit. I sighed, muttered a few choice words, and crawled into the back seat for what promised to be an uncomfortable night.

The next morning, after choking down a light breakfast—no coffee, of course—I got back to it. That fuel filter wasn’t gonna beat me, not today. It took some elbow grease and a fair bit of stubbornness, but I finally got the godforsaken thing swapped out. Feeling a bit victorious, I climbed into the driver’s seat, ready to fire her up. And wouldn’t ya know it, nothin’ happened.

I’ll admit, I threw a proper tantrum. Might’ve even invented a few new curse words in the process. Once I got all the anger outta my system, I popped the hood to figure out what went wrong, and I’ll be damned—I’d forgotten to hook the battery back up after changing it. Ain’t that just the way?

I let out a sigh big enough to change the weather, tightened up the battery clamps, and climbed back in. She fired up—rough as hell, but she fired. I leaned back in the seat, breathing a little easier for the first time in days. With the truck rumbling along, I grabbed a bite to eat and pulled out a map to start planning my next move. Wherever I was headed, it was time to get goin’.

But it really only gets worst. ","Compared to the wives who spent years or decades with their alcoholic husbands, I’m only the 2nd year in. But it’s true, it only gets worst and worst. The DV, the verbal and emotional abuse, the insults, the delusions and the humiliations, it all just got worst. 

AA taught us that alcoholism is a progressive disease, that you don’t blame a cancer patient for having cancer or get angry with him. I used to believe that and be so loving and supportive. A few weeks back I just suddenly have this clarity, that I’m making myself a fool for staying in this marriage. That I am the only one to blame to put myself in such a horrible situation. If I have walked away, I would not have to be dealing with all these anymore. 

My alcoholic husband always asked me: “why do you still want to be with me?” To be honest, I don’t have an answer anymore. I used to say it’s because I love him, but then the person I loved is long gone. He couldn’t even be nice to me anymore. Just constantly berating and humiliating in every little ways. Whenever he drank more than 3 cans of beer, he would start being abusive. Kicked me out of the house, saying it’s over, threw away the wedding ring, etc. I’d always pick up after him. 

I’ve been the only financial source throughout our marriage due to his alcoholism. I feel so belittled every time he told me money doesn’t mean anything to him, that he broke or threw away the things that I worked hard to earn. A few nights ago, he was drunk again and wanted sex, we did and at some point since it lasted too long as too much alcohol in his body I said I can’t do it anymore and wanted to stop. He wouldn’t listen to me even I said it for five times. I feel so violated. It isn’t feel like rape but just so violated. 

Today, when he got up after another night of abuse, I asked him if he wanted coffee. He said “don’t talk to me anymore, you’re a horrible person” I walked back to the bedroom and took off my wedding ring for the first time. I am going to go home in less than two weeks and will never come back (another country). I might miss him when I am gone, but I just don’t feel loved or cared for or respected anymore. There’s nothing for me to hold onto anymore. Even when he’s sober, he still treats me like a piece of shit. 

I lost myself in this marriage. I’m an independent woman with my own career and I support myself well. This marriage with him made me forget who I am, and made me believe I am this piece of shit he keeps telling me every day. 

If you have a wife or husband who is supporting you throughout your journey, please really really appreciate them and make sure you tell them how much you appreciate them every day. Thank you for reading. ",202,1736628223.0,stopdrinking,72,0.98,False

1hz5am9,https://www.reddit.com/r/tipping/comments/1hz5am9/fighting_back_against_forced_tipping_culture/,Fighting Back Against Forced Tipping Culture," Let’s talk about tipping culture and how it’s gotten out of hand. We’ve all been there: you’re buying a coffee or grabbing a quick snack, and the person at the register turns the screen to you with that awkward line, “It’s going to ask you a question.” You know what’s coming — the guilt-laden tipping prompt.

Don’t get me wrong: I believe in tipping when it’s deserved, but tipping culture has spiraled into something beyond rewarding good service. It’s become a way for businesses to push labor costs onto customers while wages stay stagnant. Tipping isn’t just for servers making $2.13/hour anymore — now it’s everywhere, for every interaction, even where there’s no service at all.

I decided to take a stand in a small but powerful way. I created a **CashApp QR code** that I can display on my phone. So when that screen turns to me, I flip the script: I turn my phone around and say, “It’s going to ask ***you*** a question.” It’s a tongue-in-cheek way to highlight the absurdity of asking customers to subsidize wages in every single transaction.

The goal isn’t to offend workers — they’re not the problem. It’s to point out the larger issue: companies that don’t pay their staff fairly and instead rely on tip prompts to guilt customers into making up the difference.

Imagine if more people did this. It would spark conversations, make people rethink tipping culture, and maybe even pressure businesses to pay livable wages instead of passing the buck to customers.

What do you think? Would you ever use a QR code like this?

1hz58se,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hz58se/sexual_harassment_kind_of/,Sexual harassment. Kind of?,"I'm a student in a grad program that involves doing internships, currently looking for a post-grad job. One of my past internships was a great fit for me, offers a stable career path, the leadership seems good.

But the dynamic with my supervisor was really weird. They'd probably be my supervisor again if I went back. Even if not, it's a small team, so we'd interact a lot.

Nothing ever happened. But they were just way too focused on me. Giving me way more support than others, always wanting to talk to me, wanting to see me outside of work. Asking me personal questions and sharing about their life. Staring at me? They're in a committed relationship, too.

What really made it feel weird was that they'd be indirect. For example, heavily implying they want me to come to some party, but not directly asking. They said they needed my personal phone number for some logistical thing, but never actually used it for that. There was this whole thing that ended up with us alone in their office, door closed, me sitting in their chair, them bending over across my lap.

I felt like I was going crazy because technically they weren't doing anything. Maybe this was all normal work stuff. But something about the vibe was intense and flirty.

After my internship ended, we kept in touch a little. I started a new internship and they started volunteering there. Again, they were really focused on me. They'd always go out of their way to come find me and talk. Our supervisor noticed and tried to stop them. Once, the supervisor called them out to their face. They said, ""You're lucky to have her."" That was the turning point where I started to really think this wasn't normal.

After our supervisor called them out, they would still pop up near me, but they'd have a reason for why. Each reason seemed normal, but it happened many times in a row. They'd also volunteer the reason unnecessarily. I think maybe they left an item of theirs where I'd find it, so that I'd return it? That sounds crazy, right?

They started asking me to hang out outside of work. I was relieved that they were finally being direct. This seemed better than finding their stuff at my internship. They brought up sexual topics, talked about longing for someone you can't have, and downplayed their relationship with their partner. They said they've been doubting whether they have the right motivations. They randomly brought up how sometimes their partner goes out of town and they're alone for the weekend. Multiple times, they asked if I need help with things that would have involved going over to each other's places, which I didn't.

At the end of their volunteer gig, they suggested I should come meet them at a weird time/place. I couldn't get there because of car trouble. They said they'd drive me. Which is 2 hours of driving for them. Just so we can get lunch? I worried this was to avoid their partner. I didn't go.

I didn't talk to them for a couple of months. I felt like I'd ended up in a situation I didn't want to be in. If they're driving 2 hours to get me, I'm supposed to sleep with them, right? But, I also felt paranoid for thinking that was happening. They sent me a joking text about some work news being a secret, which it wasn't actually. We have secrets now. Great.

Job applications were coming up. I hit them up, wanting to check on the situation. We got coffee. Their partner showed up unannounced in the middle. They both seemed upset with each other. It seemed like the partner didn't know I was going to be there, or I wasn't what she expected.

That was enough for me. Even if I was wrong about all this, I was too stressed out, and it wasn't worth it.

I texted them that I needed to stop hanging out with them but wished them well. They tried to play it off like I was having a crisis, and I doubled down and explained why. They said they support my decision if that's what I need. Okay. Cool. Love this for us. What a successful outcome.

After job applications opened, I got an email from a mutual connection inviting me to apply where they work, which I strongly suspect was their idea, because of some specific things about it that don't make sense.

The part where it's kinda not sexual harassment is the part where I really liked them. I liked their attention. I was into it. I'm sure they could tell that I liked it, and that encouraged them. So I'm being unfair to them. They were probably responding naturally to my signals. It's not fair for me to be like, ""It's so weird that you always come talk to me!"" but also like...they're probably doing it because I'm really happy when they do...

I did try to set boundaries. It was hard to stick to that, because of my feelings, the power dynamic, and them pushing it forward. It was hard to wrap my head around what was going on and make the right decisions. I think they tried too. A couple of times, I saw them noticeably make an effort to walk it back. But then, they eventually reached out again. There were many times when they could have done more, taken it farther, and they didn't.

I do think, as my supervisor, they should have been more real about boundaries, but most of this happened after the supervisor role ended. And I'm kinda glad all that went down. Because if it didn't, I'd probably have thought, ""I guess it's fine, nothing really happened"" and applied to that job. And then all this would have been playing out, except they would have been my supervisor and I'd be stuck in it, at work, all the time.",2,1736627894.0,offmychest,3,0.76,False

1hz52us,https://www.reddit.com/r/Patagonia/comments/1hz52us/w_trek_report_january_3_nights/,"W trek report (January, 3 nights)","First, I want to thank everyone who's contributed to this subreddit. My girlfriend and I found it incredibly helpful for planning our trip! To give back, I decided to share a report on our W Trek experience.

**Planning**: We didn’t plan too far in advance, so some campsites were already sold out, and others only offered premium camping options. We booked everything—campsites, flights, buses, and catamaran tickets—on November 25th. Our trek was from January 6th to January 9th (3 nights). We opted to hike from West to East and stayed at Paine Grande, Cuernos, and Chileno.

Since we booked full-board campsites, we carried 33L and 30L backpacks, and that was more than enough. Here’s what we found essential to pack:

* Sunscreen
* Daypacks
* Slides
* Water bottle
* and Good shoes and clothes ofc.

What We Didn’t Need:

* Down jacket (we were lucky with the weather, but it wasn’t necessary-we were cold only in th Torres Base when we did the sunrise hike)
* Cash (except for the shuttle bus, you can pay by card everywhere)

**Trip Report**: I’ve measured all distances with my Apple Watch, so I’ll share the data here. I won’t go into too much detail about the scenery but will focus on time management, logistical tips and camp reviews.

**Day 1: Catamaran, Glacier Grey, Suspension Bridge, Paine Grande Camp**

* Distance: 28.5 km
* Elevation Gain: 1102m

We arrived at Paine Grande Camp at 11 AM, checked in (we couldn’t access our tent until later), and left our packs at the entrance to the recption. After grabbing our daypacks, we headed to Glacier Grey at noon, aiming to reach the viewpoint. We felt physically well, so we continued to the first Suspension Bridge too. The hike was amazing, with solid elevation gain, but nothing too brutal. It took us nearly 8 hours, so if you’re a slower hiker or want more breaks, I recommend starting earlier or turning back after the Glacier Grey viewpoint.

Dinner at Paine Grande was decent—soup, pork, veggie burger, lots of sides, and dessert. You won’t leave hungry.

**Day 2: Paine Grande, Camp Italiano, Mirador Frances, Mirador Britanico, Cuernos**

* Distance: 27.6 km
* Elevation Gain: 1129m

We started our day with a solid breakfast—scrambled eggs, bread, yogurt (you pay extra for coffee). We left after 9 AM and hiked to Mirador Frances and Britanico, dropping our packs at Italiano. The trails were pretty quiet, probably because most hikers had already started by 8 AM.

The views were incredible, but the section from Frances to Britanico was longer than expected and took some time. Afterward, we grabbed our packs and headed to Cuernos. We were rushing to make it for dinner, and the section from Frances to Cuernos was technical but very scenic. I wish we had more time to enjoy it!

We arrived at Cuernos around 8 PM, checked in, and went straight to dinner. Cuernos was my favorite camp—great vibe, spacious tents, and a delicious meal (salmon with rice, soup, and dessert). The only downside was the bathroom location—quite far from the premium tents.

**Day 3: Cuernos to Chileno**

* Distance: 14 km
* Elevation Gain: 975m

After two long days of hiking, we were excited to have a shorter day. It rained in the morning, so we left at 10:30 AM—highly recommend this if you want to avoid crowds. It was our first encounter with strong winds, but they were still manageable.

We arrived at Chileno before 4 PM, checked in, and relaxed. Chileno is a small camp, and if the weather isn’t great, there aren’t many sheltered spots. The restaurant has only four tables, and three are reserved for dinner, so you can’t hang out there before or during dinner and the reception is small and there is a kitchen for hikers too.

Dinner in Chileno looked fancy but was disappointing—small portion and served cold. We didn’t mind too much since we’d only hiked 14 km, so we weren’t starving. We went to bed early to catch the sunrise at Torres Base.

**Day 4: Chileno to Torres Base, Central, Shuttle, Bus**

* Distance: 16.6 km
* Elevation Gain: 917m

We woke up at 3:15 AM and started our hike at 3:30 AM to Torres. The final section is steep, but it’s manageable. We reached the viewpoint at 5:20 AM, and there were only a few hikers there. If you can, go for a sunrise hike—later in the day, it gets super crowded.

The sunrise was magical, and this is where I decided to propose to my girlfriend—definitely a moment I’ll never forget.

Afterward, we rushed back to Chileno for breakfast (which ended at 8 AM). It was very average: bread and pulled chicken with mayo. We then headed down to Central, where we ran into hundreds of day hikers on the way up. Honestly, this was my least favorite part of the trek because it was all downhill and very crowded.

To Sum It Up: We had an unforgettable experience. While we’ve hiked in the Austrian Alps before, Patagonia is truly unique—its nature is unparalleled, and I highly recommend experiencing it for yourself.

Our Tips:

* If you have time and good weather, start your hike a bit later to avoid crowds. There were hours when we didn't encounter anyone.
* Do a sunrise hike to Torres—it’s worth it!
* Consider staying 4 nights or more. We would’ve liked to, but Camp Grey was full, so we rushed the first two days.
* Book full board. While the food at Paine Grande and Chileno wasn’t amazing, it was nice not having to carry and cook our own meals.
* Bring ziplocs to carry trash.
* Go from West to East to avoid the crowded, uphill route from Central to Chileno.
* Bring a backpack cover. There are areas with a lot of dust, and in addition to protecting from rain, it will also keep your pack clean from the dust.",5,1736627453.0,Patagonia,0,1.0,False

1hz4xud,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1hz4xud/had_the_best_date_of_my_life_but_apparently_i/,Had the Best Date of my Life But Apparently I Still Can't Catch a Break,"Hey so this actually happened a little bit ago but it's still sitting in the back of my head so I thought I'd yell about it on here to try and get it to go away.

I (M22) went on my first date in a pretty long time with this cute girl I had a class with, and it went really well I thought. We initially met at a coffee shop on campus and ended up just talking to each other for three whole hours, and it only ended when I got hungry and she said she didn't have time to go with me to lunch. Coming off of it, I felt really good because I'd never really been in a relationship before and having what felt like a successful date was a real shot to my confidence, plus I honestly just really liked her. She was smart, she was funny, she had goals and seemed like she was going places, honestly it almost felt like she was more put together than I was and that was a bit of a turn on.

Well, unfortunately I had to go out of town that next weekend so I told her we should set up a second date before I left, but even though she initially agreed she said the day of that she was busy and had to work on some surprise homework. Unfortunate, but understandable. We met up together during our class and she still seemed into me. But then when i got back, she put off our second date again and I started to realize that I was always the one that was initiating conversation. Not a great sign, so I waited a day or so and flat out told her that I was starting to stress out about it and that she needed to tell me if she was actually interested in a second date or not. Not angry or upset, just asking for honesty and communication.

She texted me back and said that, while she really did like me, she just didn't have time between her classes and her job to put into a relationship right now and she'd prefer we just be friends. Now, I'm not an incel or anything and I am perfectly capable of accepting that; I would certainly have been more than okay with just being friends seeing as I did legitimately enjoy her company and I am perfectly capable of putting any crush off to the side in order to keep a good friend, but then the one-sidedness of the whole thing stayed the same. I would say ""hey, would you like to hang out or do something as friends"" or I asked for her advice on planning a vacation to somewhere she had said she went recently, and it was the same ""sure I'd love to meet up"" until ""sorry I'm too busy"" came back around.

Now, once again i found myself at a crossroads. I felt like something was off and I point blank asked her about it, and she replied that she honestly didn't even have time have any kind of relationship, platonic or not, and that it would be best if we stopped talking outside of class. And I guess I get that, y'know, life can be hard and we only have so much time, but on some level I do feel pretty hurt. I feels like I did a lot of work, that i was willing to bend over backwards to try and make something work because I thought she was a legitimately cool person and I didn't want to just give up on that because of the smallest speed bump, but I guess she felt differently, and that doesn't make me feel very good. it's just another event in a long line of things that made me feel like I wasn't worth other people's time, or they didn't see me as worth their time.

Now, I'll be the first to admit I probably got my hopes up way higher than I should have. I've been single my entire life and the prospect of having someone around who was so pretty and cool and shit really got me excited, so I can understand if from a certain perspective I made my own bed on this one and I need to ""calm down"", but on another level it just feels so shitty that I felt there was something there, and she admitted she really liked me, but that she just decided she ""couldn't make time for me"". Like, how am I supposed to interpret that at face value and not feel a little like garbage. For once in my life I thought I'd met someone who had a chance of sticking around and of giving me the time of day, but apparently I just have the worst luck in the world.

I guess on some level I'm writing this out because I want the people on the angry internet site to tell me if I have a right to be a little upset or if I need to sit down and shut up, but honestly it just felt nice to write it all out instead of keeping all the nebulous thoughts in my brain hole. I'm, of course, not angry at her and I don't feel like I ""deserved"" her attention or some shit, I just feel a little hurt and annoyed that I so consistently put in effort with people and yet find myself so often getting pennies on the dollar back in terms of effort. How am I supposed to interpret that other than that I'm the common denominator and must not be worthy of other people's time and attention?",0,1736627069.0,self,3,0.5,False

So I'm in the process of getting a gastric bypass.   
I have a date, 21 feb. 

And i really would love to vent a little bit.  
I am excited and looking forward and really curious about life after surgery.  
I'm a diabetic and can't wait to maybe get that under control without medication (insulin at my case). 

But at night my head is going crazy.  
Sometimes I'm afraid that I'm gonna die on the operationtable. Sometimes I'm afraid I'm gonna get a shitload of complication that makes me regret everything and I can't go back.  
I'm afraid life will give me hell and absolutely not what I wanted or expected.  
All those fears became much worse since becoming a mother (babygirl is 14 months old).   
I'm so afraid I'm gonna die on the surgery table and my partner has to tell my babygirl that her mother left her because she wanted to be thin.   
I know that is not the whole story, I know. I want to be healthy and happy for me but also for her. I wanna live till i'm 150 for her. That is why I'm doing this. But still.. does that really matter if I die? 

But also something stupid but today I went to the city with my babygirl and we went out for lunch. I had a nice coffee and a piece of pumpkin spice cake. Yes I know that was not the healthiest of options but I'm already dieting for a few months and sometimes I just take something nice. Still losing weight.   
And those moments are so valuable to me, my babygirl eating a nice croissant and a little piece of cake for me. And it is so stupid because it is still a nice moment without the cake but I'm so afraid I will miss that so much. 

What if I'm not able to do this?  
What if I'm gonna fail?   
What if what kept me overweight is going to make me fail this surgery?

I think I eat healthy and luckily I'm not struggling with food anymore (I had anorexia in my teens and could overeat in my twenties). I can eat 1 cookie and leave it at that. I can diet without restricting too much. I can be strict on myself without becoming anorexic again.  
But still.. there is a reason I'm still overweight. I'm scared the surgery won't work or something.

Is all of this relatable to you guys? of not at all? or haha.

I just had my first RMR test at Dexafit. All the online RMR and BMR calcs estimate me in the 1300-1500 range, which I know from experience is way to high.

Morning coffee is a chocolate 26 Fairlife heated up with a teaspoon of instant coffee. Other than that I drink water. I don't like fruit and rarely eat it, and I get 110-125g protein per day. The chicken shortage is totally my fault.

The TDEE graph for sedentary cracks me up. It says I **MUST** eat 1200 calories per day but that I would only burn 1073. That sure explains a lot.  🙄

I told them I work a desk job, and my exercise routine is Zumba 1-2 hours per week, walking 3-4 miles per day with a 25lb vest, and at home strength training with dumbbells and body weight exercises. Their only advice was try to build more muscle through strength training.

I'm hoping to get into an Endocrinologist once that insurance mess is squared away. WW Clinic has been helpful in getting ZB and keeping an eye on me, but I would like a specialist to sort out my metabolic issues.

1hz4pw4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1hz4pw4/work_meal_outwish_me_luck/,Work meal out....wish me luck ,"Currently going through what I think is a flare up, had relentless IBS D symptoms throughout Christmas and New Year and am currently on an elimination diet. So far my diet consists of:

Breakfast (intermittent fasting):
Shot of high phenolic olive oil
Glass of kefir
Porridge with chia seeds and milled flaxseed 
Coffee

Lunch:
Apple
Banana 

Dinner:
Boiled rice
Fried egg
Zoe Daily30 portion
Spinach

I know this isn't sustainable (especially lunch!) but I'm adding in one different thing every day to see what I can tolerate. The last 3 days BMs have been relatively ok but I have a work meal out next Thursday which I am dreading as the only menu choices are pizza and pasta. I'm taking 2 Colpermin pills before each meal. Luckily the restaurant is over the road from the office so I'm hoping I'll be able to excuse myself if I need to.

I've never taken Immodium before so not sure whether to have one before the meal or just eat it and see how it plays out...",3,1736626469.0,ibs,3,1.0,False

My sodium levels have been low the past 5 years, around 133. 
My doctor is requesting a retest in 6 weeks. 

I powerlift 4 days / week & aim to have 2 active rest days / 1 lazy day. 

I do drink quite a bit of water, and one electrolyte (600mg sodium) / day + an occasional sugar free soda, plain black coffee. 

For years, I’ve opted for “no salt added / low sodium” foods / broths = should I quit doing so, in order to help my sodium intake? I don’t dislike salt; my fiancé has high BP so I tried to keep salt out where I could for his sake. 

My other bloodwork shows only low ferritin (20) / iron levels, etc are normal.

I have HEAVY menstruation; it’s just been that way all my life - mom, aunt, grandmother had hysterectomies due to this reason. 
I had normal thyroid panels / hormone checks / transvaginal ultrasounds = some fibroids but otherwise normal findings. 

I’m just seeking ways to improve this. ",1,1736626467.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1hz4pp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hz4pp6/aita_for_confronting_my_friend_for_stealing_my/,AITA for confronting my friend for stealing my business idea?,"1, 18f, have this dream of running my own coffee truck. I have the camper i'm going to renovate already, I just need to save up and find the time to start it as it's a huge project. However, I made the mistake of telling one of my closest friends, We will call her Elizabeth, about my idea. She said that would be cool and didn't say much else. Well, a few days later she tells me she's got this great idea SHE thought of. She told me she wanted to do a coffee trailer. Didn't acknowledge that it was my idea or anything. She then goes on to say ""Didn't YOU say you wanted to do something like that?"" as if i hadn't been planning it for 6 months and had told her about it not too long before this conversation. She even said ""You can work with me if you want!"" NO. I wanted MY own business. I don't wanna work for you. She has been posting about it all over her instagram story and now people will think i'm the one who copied her because i'll be announcing it after her. And about a day after she told me her idea, she got her own! Using daddy's money. I had to save up for MONTHS to buy the trailer and make sure it was really what i wanted to do. But she gets to decide within two days of me telling her about my idea to do a trailer
When I confronted her about my feelings, she basically said ""Sorry, but coffee trailers are really popular nowadays"" and ""my therapist told me to do it""
Maybe i'm overreacting but i'm really hurt because i thought i could trust her as she was my closest friend.
Getting lots of mixed reviews so here’s a little edit:
Elizabeth Also got her mom to message MY mom for some reason. 
My mom did not want to be a part of this also we are adults. We can work it out ourselves.
I believe she did this to scare me.
I am aware my coffee truck isn’t original but it’s the fact i’m not given ANY recognition for giving her the idea.

I see some beautiful new homes in the community with primaries on the first floor, which is what we need. We also wanted walkable, though. I know it’s about four miles from downtown, so probably isn’t very walkable. But does anyone know if there are stores or coffee shops/cafes, or parks nearby? It’s hard to tell from the overview map of the community and we’d love to hear some local input about the area. Community is bordered by Shookstown and Bowers Roads and Kemp Lane.
