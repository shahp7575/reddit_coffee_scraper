The golden years offer a wonderful opportunity for personal growth, social connection, and continued learning. By focusing on holistic wellness, seniors can ensure their later years are truly shining.

[Embrace Your Golden Years: A Holistic Guide to Senior Wellness](https://preview.redd.it/ele9bku8xyhf1.jpg?width=1408&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7f360c0dddaa6463ee474665bcbeaa376ab0a57f)

# Stay Active, Stay Healthy: The Power of Movement

Regular physical activity is paramount for healthy aging, promoting flexibility, balance, and cardiovascular health without excessive joint stress. Experts recommend that **seniors complete at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week**, which can be accumulated through activities like walking, swimming, or cycling. These sessions can even be broken down into 10 or 15-minute segments throughout the day.

**Consider these low-impact and beneficial activities:**

* **Tai Chi and Yoga:**¬†Excellent for promoting flexibility, balance, and mind-body connection. Tai Chi, in particular, can make it easier to walk on uneven surfaces without losing balance.
* **Water Aerobics:**¬†A gentle yet effective way to build strength and endurance.
* **Walking and Cycling:**¬†Great for cardiovascular health and can be easily incorporated into daily routines.
* **Strength and Flexibility Exercises:**¬†Simple exercises like wall push-ups, pelvic tilts, shoulder exercises, and various stretches can be done at home to maintain muscle strength and improve range of motion.
* **Balance Training:**¬†Crucial for fall prevention, these exercises can even be practiced while queuing at the bank or store.

**Important Safety Tips for Exercise:**

* Always start with a 5-10 minute warm-up and end with a cool-down.
* Wear comfortable clothing and appropriate non-slip shoes.
* Stay hydrated by drinking water, milk, juice, or coffee/tea throughout the day, even if not thirsty.
* **Listen to your body:**¬†If you feel any pain or discomfort, rest or reduce intensity.
* Those with chronic conditions like heart disease, diabetes, or hypertension should consult a doctor or physical therapist for tailored exercise plans.

# Fueling Your Mind and Body: The Wellness Plate

A balanced diet is critical for overall health, providing energy, reducing the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes, and supporting cognitive function. The **MIND diet**, which combines principles from the Mediterranean and DASH diets, is specifically recommended for brain health and can help prevent and even improve symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Studies show that adherence to the MIND diet can make a senior's brain appear on average 7.5 years younger, significantly lowering the risk of Alzheimer's.

**Key ""Brain-Boosting"" Foods (MIND Diet recommendations):**

* **Green Leafy Vegetables:**¬†Aim for six or more servings per week (e.g., kale, spinach).
* **Other Non-Starchy Vegetables:**¬†Try to include at least one other vegetable daily.
* **Berries:**¬†Two or more servings per week (e.g., blueberries, strawberries) for their high antioxidant content.
* **Nuts:**¬†Five or more servings per week; choose unsalted, dry-roasted, or raw options.
* **Whole Grains:**¬†Make up more than one-third of your staple foods to help control blood sugar and inflammation.
* **Fish:**¬†At least once a week, especially fatty fish like salmon, tuna, or mackerel, which are rich in Omega-3 fatty acids crucial for brain health.
* **Beans:**¬†Incorporate beans into at least four meals per week for protein, fiber, and B vitamins.
* **Poultry:**¬†Consume chicken or duck at least twice a week as a lean protein source.
* **Olive Oil:**¬†Use as your primary cooking oil.

**Foods to Limit for Optimal Brain Health:**

* **Red Meat:**¬†Limit to less than 320 grams per week.
* **Butter and Stick Margarine:**¬†Keep to less than one tablespoon daily, substituting with olive oil where possible.
* **Cheese:**¬†Limit to no more than once per week.
* **Pastries and Sweets:**¬†Restrict to less than four times a week due to their negative impact on brain health.
* **Fried and Fast Foods:**¬†Consume no more than once a week.

# Sharpening the Mind: Cognitive and Mental Well-being

Maintaining a sharp mind and positive mood is vital. Many seniors face challenges such as social isolation, loneliness, and increased rates of depression and anxiety, which can be exacerbated by chronic illnesses. These issues are often unrecognized and untreated due to stigma.

**Engage your brain with these stimulating activities:**

* **Puzzles and Brain Games:**¬†Crosswords, Sudoku, and jigsaw puzzles enhance problem-solving, memory, and attention to detail. Mobile apps also offer daily brain challenges.
* **Reading and Book Clubs:**¬†Reading keeps the mind keen and vocabulary rich, while book clubs add a social dimension for discussing themes and plots.
* **Online Courses and Learning Platforms:**¬†Websites like Coursera or edX provide endless opportunities for lifelong learning, from history to computer programming, at your own pace and from the comfort of your home. Many platforms also offer forums for interaction with other learners.
* **Creative Arts:**¬†Activities like painting, knitting, or pottery stimulate the brain, provide a sense of purpose, improve hand-eye coordination, and can even alleviate symptoms of anxiety or depression.

**Prioritize your mental health:**

* **Seek Support:**¬†If experiencing persistent sadness, anxiety, or feelings of isolation, it's crucial to seek professional help. Organizations like Jefferson Center offer specialized teams and in-home care programs for seniors, addressing challenges like hoarding and grief.
* **Combat Stigma:**¬†Recognizing that mental health issues are treatable and common, helps in seeking timely support.

# Connecting with Others: Building a Vibrant Social Circle

Social connection is a powerful antidote to loneliness and a significant factor in positive mental health, life satisfaction, and quality of life for seniors.

**Strategies to expand your social circle:**

* **Actively Participate in Community Activities:**¬†Join fitness classes, handicraft workshops, or gardening groups offered by community centers or adult day care programs. These provide platforms to meet like-minded individuals and build new friendships.
* **Utilize the Internet and Social Media:**¬†Technology offers convenient ways to stay connected with family and friends, and to meet new people through interest groups or online discussions. This can broaden your social reach beyond your immediate vicinity.
* **Volunteer Activities:**¬†Volunteering allows you to meet others with shared values, find new meaning and purpose, contribute to the community, and integrate more fully into society.
* **Visit Family and Friends:**¬†Regularly inviting loved ones over or visiting their homes strengthens emotional bonds and provides opportunities to meet new people through their networks.
* **Music and Singing Groups:**¬†Joining a choir or learning an instrument can boost cognitive function and emotional well-being, while offering social and creative collaboration opportunities.
* **Cooking and Baking Classes:**¬†Exploring new recipes can be a fun and nutritious activity, and group cooking sessions can become social events where people share tips and recipes.

# Proactive Healthcare and Home Safety

Regular health check-ups are essential for early detection and control of common age-related diseases. For seniors over 60, general health check-ups are recommended every 3-4 months, or every six months for middle-aged individuals.

**Key Medical Checks to Consider:**

* **Specialized ""Add-on"" Screenings:**¬†Beyond routine checks, consider tests for heart health (cardiac ultrasound), brain health (CT/MRI for headaches/dizziness), and various cancer screenings (annual for those over 50 or with family history).
* **Bone Density:**¬†Important for preventing osteoporosis, especially after age 40 if experiencing persistent pain in the lower back, pelvis, or knees.
* **Post-Meal Blood Sugar:**¬†Crucial for detecting glucose intolerance, even if fasting blood sugar is normal.
* **Vaccinations:**¬†As immunity declines with age, vaccines are vital to prevent severe illness and complications. Recommended vaccines include annual **flu shots**, **Hepatitis B**, **pneumonia**, **shingles**, and **diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTaP)**.

**Safe and Convenient Home Environments:** Many seniors prefer to age at home. **Home modifications can significantly enhance safety and convenience**, particularly for fall prevention.

* **Install Grab Bars:**¬†In bathrooms, showers, and next to toilets and beds to assist with standing and movement.
* **Non-Slip Surfaces:**¬†Apply anti-slip mats or flooring in bathrooms and kitchens.
* **Remove Obstacles:**¬†Clear pathways of clutter and consider removing door thresholds to ease movement, especially for those using wheelchairs.
* **Improve Lighting:**¬†Use night lights in hallways, bathrooms, and stairwells to prevent falls in the dark.
* **Assistive Devices:**¬†Utilize tools like shower chairs, adjustable beds, and emergency call systems to support daily living.
* **Government Subsidies:**¬†Many regions offer subsidies for home modifications for seniors in need.

By proactively engaging in these aspects of wellness‚Äîphysical activity, nutritious eating, cognitive stimulation, social connection, and preventative healthcare‚Äîseniors can truly thrive and enjoy a vibrant, purposeful, and joyful life.",1,1754734062.0,ChinaMedicalSupport,0,1.0,False

\--------- Food ---------

I was more interested in the food and spent more time researching the cuisine of each region than on the things to do. I had made reservations in advance to most of the restaurants and it was worth it, since they were fully booked when we visited. We also had gelatos (no surprise!). Listing down our recommended restaurants and the food we liked. I am trying to be concise but am happy to elaborate to any questions in comments or DM.

**Rome**

[Er Buchetto](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XujinKRRtKzoBN8d8) ‚Äì Great start. Sandwich made of just bread and¬†porchetta. Loved it.

[Antico Forno Roscioli](https://maps.app.goo.gl/t3YT3AXaQ8Hq9h8Y6) ‚Äì Yummy¬†pizza al taglio. Also, I preferred their¬†suppli¬†than the one from ‚ÄòSuppli Roma‚Äô, which was also good.

[Roscioli Salumeria con Cucina](https://maps.app.goo.gl/g396usrpkFbZZbda9) ‚Äì The¬†carbonara¬†was A-1. The complimentary¬†burrata¬†and¬†pesto¬†was so good.

[Checchino Dal 1887](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rq6zAy5FuvEPX5M5A) ‚Äì The¬†coda alla vaccinara¬†was excellent. My best find of the entire trip.

[Trattoria Da Enzo al 29](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4CYe68MihyCjvFnD8) ‚Äì We had a very good meal. Loved their¬†polpette al sugo¬†and¬†mascarpone¬†chesse custard with wild strawberries.

[Trapizzino | Mercato Centrale Roma](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CBWM6uQKWcJH2ER1A) ‚Äì Good fast food. Liked their Pollo alla Cacciatora.

[L'Elementare ‚Äì Trastevere](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4SK4PkdsFMZh44NL9) ‚Äì Traditional Roman-style pizza. Both our pizzas were generously filled with fresh ingredients. Would have loved to try the entire pizza menu.

[Ristorante La Tavernaccia Da Bruno](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cANBQQtRNV3FbPLe6) ‚Äì Their pasta with clams was good and roasted suckling pig was fulfilling. Highlight for us was their pistachio cake and the service. Best dessert of our trip.

Gelatos: [Gelateria La Romana](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4odTHCix3cPDL1hv9), [Fiordiluna](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DJ3DD9bc7oT2TUwv8).

**Florence**

[The Antico Ristoro di Cambi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8ULtv2jHnqhqQvMdA) ‚Äì We had 2 very satisfying meals here. Mostly everyone was ordering the Florentine steak but I had made reservations elsewhere to try it. Our recommendations.

Bruschetta with chicken liver pate, anchovies with butter (heavenly!!) and bread,¬†pappa al Pomodoro,¬†pappardelle¬†with wild boar ragu, Livornese codfish (Spouse‚Äôs best find)

[Osteria del Cinghiale Bianco](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pE2d3uwQjdZyJT238) ‚Äì Their¬†pappardelle¬†with wild boar ragu was good but I preferred the¬†pappardelle¬†at ‚ÄòCiambi‚Äô. My spouse liked the livornese codfish here.

[Trattoria Mario](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8gX6kAXK1DVQgJzZ8) ‚Äì The Florentine steak was very good. Finished with a home-made¬†torta della nonna.

[I' Girone De' Ghiotti](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gccpiVS7M71BZmvBA) ‚Äì Wanted to eat sandwich at ‚ÄòI Fratellini‚Äô but it was strangely closed. We went here which was right across and had great, hot sandwiches ( Suicida & Beatrice ).

[Biscottificio Antonio Mattei Museo Bottega a Firenze](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZaBxgeQZoTWmLVov8) ‚Äì Loved their¬†biscotti. Seemed expensive but it was worthy.

Gelatos: [La Gelatiera](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1U9zDY9EwnpZfokY9), [Gelateria Della Passera](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mmUmz7upP85xJgkg6).

**Venice**

[Osteria La Zucca](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YudpQFJDVCjvzzWM7) ‚Äì Another fantastic dining experience. We loved the rabbit & the pumpkin and mushroom lasagna. We finished with a dessert (forgot the name) with chocolate chips.

[Osteria San Isepo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xKiQd7wFLxq81GVx7) ‚Äì We had¬†Bigoli in salsa¬†and the fish. Good meal and lovely service.

[Trattoria da Romano](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nCahgJwFd4QtubjH6) ‚Äì We had their famous¬†risotto di g√≥¬†and fried prawns, squid and vegetables. Our most expensive meal of the trip.

[Pasticceria Bonifacio](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pkCADSxa7vmpJQmp7) ‚Äì Great place for pastries and coffee.

Cicchetti - [Bacaro Risorto Castello](https://maps.app.goo.gl/W3wrGR5KoPcrEfTF6), [Adriatico Mar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vDHdSdWTFxg5FYbv8) (Baccal√† Mantecato Con Polenta)

Gelato: [Gelateria Crema](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7UQuveS7Ai8db26GA) (Burano)

**Milan**

[Osteria dell'Oca Giuliva](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pLNVo3z1KxMozsu17):¬†Risotto alla Milanese, grilled sea bream & ravioli with butter & sage. Satisfying meal. It was a last min decision to go here. They have some bad reviews from tourists but we had a better experience.

Summarizing, we loved the entire food experience part of our trip and thought we ate at really good, authentic places. Do let me know if any of them weren‚Äôt. The service varied but we never had one bad experience. We missed out on some food and restaurants, for which I will gladly go back some day. It was a successful food tour for us.

\--------- Things to do ---------

About the things we did. We visited

Rome: Colosseum (impressive), Roman Forum, Palatine Hill, Trevi fountain, Pantheon, Borghese Gallery (don‚Äôt miss), Saint Peter‚Äôs Basilica (beautiful) & Trastevere.

Florence: Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore (looks amazing on the outside), Sunset at Piazzale Michelangelo (don‚Äôt miss, [plug](https://www.reddit.com/r/florence/comments/1ml2a6f/sunset_at_piazzale_michelangelo/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)), Ponte Vecchio, Ponte Santa Trinita (to look at Ponte Vecchio), leaning tower of Pisa, Galleria dell‚ÄôAccademia di Firenze (David!!!) & the leather market.

Venice: St Mark's Campanile (amazing view of entire Venice), Doge's Palace, Piazza San Marco, Basilica Santa Maria della Salute, Grand Canal, Basilica S.Maria Gloriosa dei Frari (don‚Äôt miss), Lido beach (very clean, wished we stayed for more time), Burano island (beautiful) & Murano island.

Milan: Duomo di Milano (don‚Äôt miss)

\--------- Comments ---------

I am listing some info & experiences (not criticism) below.

* Venice is BEAUTIFUL!!! ([plug](https://www.reddit.com/r/Venezia/comments/1mjie37/venice_is_beautiful/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button))
* Everywhere, it was crowded but not like it was made out on the internet about Italy. It just felt like summer at any famous tourist destination in Europe. Once you step out of the tourist spots, everything was just fine.
* There are plenty of water fountains everywhere. Do carry your water bottles.
* The service & interactions were more easy-going, genuine & fun the more you moved out of the tourist areas. ¬†
* I used the Trenitalia website to book all our intercity travel tickets. The site and their app works great. They also have huge number of kiosks in all major train stations.
* The Frecciarossa is awesome. The seats were great in Premium & Business. I had booked 2 months in advance & got great deals.
* The vaporetto services in Venice were great. We purchased a one-time ticket on our first day to reach our hotel in San marco. We purchased a 24H pass on the 2nd¬†evening to explore surrounding islands on 3rd¬†day & reach the central train station.
* In Rome, we saw a pickpocket attempt in metro (at night), ticket validating machines malfunctioning in bus, a bus never turned up for 45 mins. All other times, the public transport was good to go around Rome. We took the 48H pass and made full use of it.
* In Florence, we mostly moved around on foot. We used the bus a few times and it was good. They were a bit late but they arrived.
* In Pisa, our bus tickets were checked both times, to & from the Leaning tower. Please learn how to validate the bus tickets or the concept of ‚ÄúTap & Go‚Äù ‚Äì 1 ticket per credit card. We were good but the ticket inspectors caught people both times, who just didn‚Äôt understand how to do either.
* Trenitalia decided to terminate our train from Florence to Venice at Bologna (16th¬†July) with no information. We went on a morning run at Bologna, from Platform 1 to 11, to catch the regional train to Venice, leaving in 10 mins. It was fun :)

The last few points are only to mention our experience. We have traveled a bit and understand that these things happen. The only intention is to inform and ask you to factor in a buffer time, in case you plan to use public transports.

One final note. We loved what Italy offered us and we will certainly be back for more. I know, we visited the most touristy cities in Italy but it was such a dream come true to tick off all the attractions we had only read about growing up. There are so much new food to try & many more amazing places to explore. I am grateful to all the subreddits ( r/ItalyTravel, r/roma,¬†r/rome, r/florence , r/firenze , r/Venezia ) from where I got some amazing tips about restaurants & things to do.

Eko paid the driver and rushed up the front steps, his heart pounding a frantic rhythm against his ribs. He pounded on the door. ""Aldo! Aldo, let me in!""

The door flew open, and a disheveled Aldo stood there, his hair askew and a look of utter desperation on his face. ""Eko! Oh, thank god! You won't believe what's happening!""

Eko pushed past him, his eyes scanning the living room. It was a bachelor's paradise, cluttered with video game controllers, empty pizza boxes, and band equipment. In the middle of it all, perched regally on the back of the sofa, was Malty. She was holding a large, fluffy orange cat in her arms, stroking its head with an almost worshipful expression. The cat, Snuggles, looked completely at peace, purring loudly, its eyes half-closed in bliss.

""Greetings, Eko,"" Malty said, her voice dripping with an imperious, theatrical tone. ""As you can see, I have begun my sacred duty. The feline monarch and I are deep in discussion.""

Aldo, wringing his hands, ran a hand through his hair. ""Dude, she's been like this for an hour! She won't let go of Snuggles, and she keeps talking about how he's a 'noble beast' and the true 'prince' of the house. I can't get her to stop!""

Malty glared at Aldo. ""Quiet, commoner! A prince deserves his due respect. And a love consultation requires a clear, quiet mind, which I cannot have with your incessant complaining.""

Eko sighed, running a hand through his hair. This was worse than he thought. ""Malty, can you please put the cat down? Snuggles is not a prince. He's a cat. A very fluffy cat, but a cat nonetheless.""

Malty's lips thinned into a fine line. ""You dare to question my judgment? This feline's noble bearing is undeniable! He has the soul of a true warrior!""

""He's a house cat!"" Aldo wailed. ""He chases laser pointers and sleeps all day!""

""Silence!"" Malty commanded, and the cat in her arms seemed to purr even louder, as if in agreement. Eko noticed she wasn't yelling, but her voice held a new, quiet authority that was somehow more terrifying.

""Okay, let's just calm down,"" Eko said, trying to take a more diplomatic approach. ""Malty, I'm here to help you with the love consultation. Can we focus on that?""

Malty's face brightened. ""Ah, yes. The consultation. You see, Aldo's friend, Roy, is in a bit of a predicament."" She leaned forward conspiratorially. ""He wishes to court a girl, but he is a fool who does not know the first thing about it.""

Aldo groaned, his face buried in his hands. ""She's been reading my texts. She thinks my friend Roy, who works at a coffee shop, is a 'prince' who needs to 'court' a girl named 'Stacey' with 'a song'.""

""What?"" Eko asked, his eyes wide.

Malty nodded sagely. ""Indeed! Roy's words were 'I wanna ask Stacey out, but she's super into poetry. I don't know what to do.' So, I advised him to write a poem that will make her his lover by the end of the day.""

Aldo's head shot up. ""No, she told me to tell Roy to write a poem about how his love for Stacey is like 'the eternal flame of a thousand suns, burning forever for all eternity.' He thinks that will make her fall in love with him!""

Eko stared at Malty, a look of pure bewilderment on his face. She, in turn, looked back with a completely satisfied, proud expression, as if she had just solved a world-ending problem. Eko knew he had to do something, and quickly. Malty's misguided ""advice"" was going to completely ruin Roy's chances.

Aldo threw his hands up in frustration. ""Malty, you think writing poetry will help Roy tell Stacey how much he loves him like it's Romeo and Juliet?!"" he exclaimed, his voice incredulous.

Malty blinked. The fluffy orange cat, Snuggles, yawned in her arms. ""What's a 'Romeo and Juliet'?"" she asked, a genuine flicker of curiosity in her eyes.

Eko ran a hand through his hair, trying to think of the most basic, Malty-proof way to explain one of the most famous tragedies in the world. ""Okay, so... 'Romeo and Juliet' is a really old story. A play, actually. It's about two families who hate each other, and a boy and a girl from those families fall in love.""

Malty's eyes widened, her regal demeanor softening slightly. ""A forbidden love! How romantic! What happens next? Do they conquer their families and rule their kingdoms together?""

Aldo shook his head vigorously. ""No, dude! It's a tragedy! They both die!""

Malty‚Äôs smile vanished. ""They what?!"" she demanded, a look of horror spreading across her face. ""That is... that is terrible! How can a love story end with death?! It is an abomination! Who wrote such a thing?!""

""Some guy named Shakespeare,"" Eko said with a shrug. ""It's a classic.""

""A classic?"" Malty scoffed. ""In my world, a classic love story ends with a heroic battle, a royal wedding, and a long and prosperous reign! Not... not this."" She looked utterly disgusted. ""And you people think this is a good thing to emulate? Are you all mad?""

Aldo pointed at Eko. ""See? This is why her advice is so bad! She thinks everything is a grand, epic romance, but it's not! Roy just wants to go on a date with a girl!""

Malty held Snuggles closer, her expression a mix of offense and disdain. ""And a date, as you call it, is the first step to a grand, epic romance! Roy's love poem is a powerful, romantic gesture that will surely win the girl's heart. It's a declaration of eternal love! Why do you not understand?""

""Because it's cheesy, Malty!"" Aldo yelled. ""Nobody talks like that! It's a first date, not a marriage proposal! He's going to scare her off!""

Malty puffed out her chest. ""Nonsense! A woman of proper standing would be thrilled to receive such a powerful declaration! He must show his strength and devotion!""

Eko stepped forward, putting a hand on Aldo's shoulder. ""Okay, okay, let's take a deep breath. Malty, I get what you're trying to do, but this is a different world with different rules. People here don't want to be told their love is like 'a thousand suns.' They want to be told they're funny, or smart, or that they have a nice smile.""

Malty looked at him, her brow furrowed. ""But that is a commoner's love! It is weak and fleeting!""

Aldo rolled his eyes. ""No, Malty, that's what's real! What you're talking about is a fairy tale. That stuff only happens in books... or anime, I guess.""

Malty's face paled again. ""So my world... is just a fairy tale to you?"" she whispered, her voice a little shaky.

Eko saw a sudden, deep vulnerability in her eyes. The tough, imperious facade was cracking. This was the same girl he had seen in the cell, scared and alone. He quickly changed his approach. ""No, not a fairy tale,"" he said gently. ""It's just... a different story. And here, in our story, we do things differently.""

Malty was silent for a moment, looking from Eko to Aldo and then down at the cat in her arms, which had started batting playfully at a loose string on her t-shirt. She seemed to be processing this new information, the idea that her world and its grand gestures were not the only way.

""So... what is this 'Stacey' girl's favorite thing?"" she asked finally, her voice small and uncertain.

Aldo's eyes lit up. ""Poetry!"" he exclaimed. ""That's what I've been trying to say! She's into poetry, but like... modern poetry, not the 'eternal suns' stuff!""

Malty straightened up, a look of determination on her face. ""Then we shall give her poetry! But a new kind of poetry... 'modern poetry' as you call it."" She gently placed Snuggles on the couch. The cat immediately curled up and went back to sleep. ""We shall find out what this 'modern poetry' is, and we shall help this foolish 'Roy' win his 'Stacey'!""

Aldo grabbed his laptop from the coffee table. He flipped it open, and the screen glowed to life, a stark contrast to the dim lighting in the room. Malty watched, completely mesmerized by the glowing screen.

""What's this?"" she asked, leaning in close. ""Is it some kind of scrying device?""

""It's a laptop,"" Aldo said, running his hand over the smooth plastic case. ""It's what we use to look up information and... well, everything.""

Malty's eyes widened. She reached out a hesitant finger toward the screen. ""It's a commoner's magic box!""

""Yeah, something like that,"" Aldo said, a small, proud smirk on his face. He began to type on the keyboard, his fingers moving with practiced ease. Malty watched, her head tilted, as if trying to decipher a new kind of spell.

""Can I try it?"" she asked, her voice full of a genuine, childlike curiosity.

Aldo immediately pulled the laptop back, clutching it to his chest as if it were a priceless treasure. ""No! Go get your own,"" he snapped. ""I don't want you to ruin my laptop. You don't know how to use it!""

Eko, seeing the look of disappointment on Malty's face, stepped in. ""Aldo, come on. That's not fair,"" he said gently. ""She's just curious. We're trying to help her understand our world, remember? She can't do that if you don't let her touch anything.""

Aldo sighed, but he knew Eko was right. He slowly lowered the laptop. ""Fine. But be careful with it,"" he grumbled, pointing at the trackpad. ""This is the trackpad. It's like a tiny magic scroll that controls the cursor on the screen.""

Malty, her face now a mask of pure concentration, placed her finger on the trackpad and began to move it. The cursor, a small arrow on the screen, moved in a jerky, chaotic fashion, flying from one corner of the screen to the other as she overcorrected. Aldo winced, watching the laptop's screen with a look of extreme anxiety.

Eko, ever the teacher, put a calming hand on Malty's shoulder. ""Slowly,"" he said. ""Just a little bit. It's very sensitive.""

Malty took a deep breath and tried again, her movements more deliberate this time. She managed to move the cursor to the search bar. With Eko's guidance, she began to type, her fingers landing on the keys with a forceful, heavy-handed touch. ""Modern... poetry,"" she whispered to herself.

When she finished, Eko gently nudged her hand to the trackpad. ""Now, click on the search button.""

Malty's finger hovered over the button, and with a small, triumphant cry, she clicked. The screen instantly filled with a thousand examples of modern poetry. They read through several, their eyes scanning the strange, asymmetrical lines and the lack of traditional rhyme schemes. Malty's face was a study in confusion.

""These are... not poems,"" she said, her voice filled with disbelief. ""Where is the glorious cadence? The beautiful, rhyming words?""

Aldo shook his head. ""That's the point, Malty. It's free verse. It's not about the rhyme, it's about the feeling. It's about what the words mean.""

Malty looked from the screen to Aldo, and then to Eko. Her expression was a mix of awe and a new, unfamiliar kind of understanding. This was a new magic, a new art form, completely alien to her world.

""So, the power of this magic... comes from the feeling, not the words?"" she asked, her voice a hushed whisper.

Eko nodded, a small smile on his face. ""Something like that. So, what do you think we should do next?""

Malty's eyes darted between the glowing screen and the two friends. The weight of her failure with Roy was heavy on her, and the new, strange art form of ""modern poetry"" was a mystery she was determined to solve. She straightened up, her regal posture returning. ""We will craft a new weapon for this 'Roy',"" she declared, her voice firm once again. ""A poem that is both modern and, dare I say it, royal! We will blend the two worlds.""

Aldo snorted. ""You mean, we're going to write a poem that's both cheesy and a little bit dramatic?""

Malty glared at him. ""It shall be a poem of great sincerity! A powerful missive that speaks the truth of his heart, in a language that this 'Stacey' will understand!"" She turned to Eko. ""Your thoughts, loyal counsel?""

Eko leaned back, a small smile on his face. This was a challenge he could get behind. ""Okay, let's start with the basics. What's the main idea? What does Roy want to say to her?""

""That she is a bright and shining star in his celestial kingdom!"" Malty said, her hands gesturing dramatically. ""That his heart is a fortress, and she is the only one with the key!""

""No, dude,"" Aldo interjected. ""He wants to say he thinks she's cool, and that he'd like to get to know her better. Like, maybe he could start with something about her smile. He always talks about her smile.""

Malty wrinkled her nose. ""A smile? It is a fleeting, common thing! A true monarch's love is built on a foundation of eternal light!""

""But a smile is what's real, Malty,"" Eko said gently. ""The poem needs to feel personal. It needs to feel like it's from him, not from a royal decree.""

Malty was silent for a moment, thinking. She looked back at the screen, at a few lines of free verse about a city street at night. ""So... the poem must speak of common things... but with a noble heart?"" she asked, a new idea dawning on her.

Eko nodded. ""Exactly. Let's start with the smile.""

Aldo took his laptop and typed a few lines. ""How about: 'Your smile is like a light, I can't look away.'""

Malty scoffed. ""Weak! It is a declaration, not a poem! It lacks power!""

""Okay, you try it, then,"" Aldo challenged. ""But remember, no 'celestial kingdom' stuff.""

Malty's eyes narrowed in thought. She looked at the laptop screen, then at the half-eaten pizza on the table, then at Aldo's fluffy cat, Snuggles, now sleeping peacefully on the couch. A new kind of poetry began to form in her mind, a blend of her world and theirs.

""The words you speak are like an army,"" she began, a slow, melodic cadence entering her voice. ""But the light of your smile... is the banner that leads them.""

Eko's eyes lit up. ""I like that. It's dramatic, but it's grounded. It's a good start.""

Aldo was skeptical, but he typed the words anyway. ""Okay, what's next? What about his feelings?""

""He feels a great honor to stand in her presence,"" Malty said, puffing out his chest. ""He feels a powerful pull, a... a gravitational force!""

Aldo rolled his eyes. ""Okay, maybe a little less sci-fi. How about... he feels a little nervous, but excited to see her again?""

""A warrior does not feel 'nervous'!"" Malty snapped.

Eko intervened. ""Malty, it's okay to feel nervous. It shows you care. It's a strength, not a weakness.""

Malty considered this. It was a completely alien concept to her, but she was trying to learn. ""Then... we shall speak of a 'brave trembling',"" she said, a new spark of inspiration in her eyes. ""A 'brave trembling' that speaks of his great devotion!""

Aldo typed the words on the screen, and the poem began to take shape. Eko helped to refine it, toning down some of Malty's more theatrical phrases and smoothing out the transitions. They worked together for the next hour, a strange and unlikely team, united in their goal to fix the mess they had made.

Finally, a complete poem sat on the screen. It was short, but it was powerful. A beautiful, strange fusion of Malty's grandiose world and their own.

*I am a general of clumsy words,* *a warrior of a thousand missteps.* *But your smile is the banner I follow,* *the light I seek through the darkest depths.*

*The universe has spoken to me,* *in the brave trembling of my heart.* *And with this poem, and with this plea,* *I wish for us to start.*

*A simple coffee, a quiet plea,* *to tell you what is true,* *my heart is not a grand kingdom,* *but a small, warm home, for you.*

They all stared at the screen, a collective sense of pride washing over them. It was a good poem. It was honest, and it was sincere, and it was a thousand times better than the ""eternal suns"" poem Malty had come up with before.

Aldo grabbed his phone and took a picture of the screen. ""I'm sending this to Roy,"" he said, a look of genuine hope on his face.

""And it shall be the first step in our victory!"" Malty declared, a triumphant smile on her face. ""The grand redemption quest... is a success!""

Aldo slammed the laptop shut. ""Alright, let's send this poem to Roy before things get worse. Eko, can you print the poem?""

""Yeah, but who's gonna send the poem?"" Eko asked.

Aldo paused, looking at Malty, who was now playing with Snuggles again, a serene expression on her face. A mischievous grin spread across his features. ""I've got an idea,"" he said, his eyes twinkling. ""You two are going to take a trip to his house to deliver it.""

Malty's eyes widened. ""A quest! A sacred pilgrimage to deliver the missive of love! I accept!"" she declared, holding Snuggles up in the air like a royal scepter. ""But the feline monarch must accompany us!""

Aldo immediately shook his head. ""No, you can't! Snuggles hates being outside. He'll freak out.""

""C'mon, Aldo,"" Eko said, placing a hand on his friend's shoulder. ""Just let Snuggles enjoy the outside. We'll get your cat home safely.""

Aldo sighed in defeat. ""Fine. Just be careful with him. I'll send you the address on your phone.""

Eko nodded and began to call a ride-share service on his phone. A few minutes later, a car pulled up to the curb. Malty, still holding Snuggles like a precious artifact, brought the cat to the taxi. The driver, a weary-looking man, looked at them and the cat with a mixture of confusion and disbelief.

""Are you serious? Bringing a cat to-"" he started, his voice a flat, tired monotone.

""Hush,"" Malty said, her voice stern and regal. ""Do not disrespect King Snuggles. We've got a quest to finish!""

The driver sighed deeply. ""Dios mio... you gotta be kidding me,"" he muttered under his breath.

""Just drive to the location,"" Eko said, giving the driver a reassuring, if slightly apologetic, look.

The driver shook his head as he pulled away from the curb, and the grand, cat-accompanied quest to deliver the poem of love had officially begun. The taxi ride began as a quiet rumble, but it quickly became anything but. Malty, holding Snuggles on her lap, pointed out the window at the passing cars. ""Behold, Eko! The iron steeds of this realm!"" she declared, her voice loud and theatrical. ""And look at their banners!"" she added, gesturing to a passing car with a bumper sticker of a cartoon fish.

The driver, who had been trying to ignore them, groaned and gripped the steering wheel tighter. Eko, sitting in the passenger seat, just smiled apologetically.

""Don't mind her,"" Eko said, half to the driver and half to himself. ""It's a long story.""

Malty ignored him, turning her attention to the radio. A pop song with a heavy bass beat filled the car. She sat up straight, her eyes wide with a mix of fear and fascination. ""What sorcery is this?! A bard's song, but without a single lute or drum!""

The driver turned down the volume without a word. ""King Snuggles demands silence for his contemplation!"" Malty announced, and Snuggles, as if on cue, let out a soft meow and began to knead at her chest. The driver rolled his eyes and mumbled something in Spanish under his breath.

As the car wove through the suburban streets, Snuggles, who had been surprisingly calm, suddenly perked up. His ears swiveled, and his tail began to twitch. He let out a low growl, his eyes fixed on a small dog barking from behind a fence.

""He senses an enemy!"" Malty exclaimed, holding the cat closer. ""A beast of the outer lands! Fear not, my liege, for I shall protect you!""

Eko quickly put a hand on her arm. ""Malty, no. It's just a dog. A very small dog. Please don't open the door.""

Malty reluctantly sat back down, but not before giving the driver a severe look. ""This vehicle provides no proper defenses for the monarch! A grave oversight!""

The driver, completely fed up, pulled to a stop in front of a small, nondescript house. ""This is the address,"" he said, his voice flat. He didn't even wait for them to get out. As soon as Eko paid him, he sped away, leaving them on the curb.

Eko and Malty stood on the sidewalk, a printout of the poem clutched in Eko's hand, and Snuggles still in Malty's arms. The cat seemed to have lost all his bravado and was now purring contentedly, rubbing his head against Malty's chin.

""Behold, Roy's citadel!"" Malty said, pointing at the modest house. ""It is a humble abode, but one we shall bring great victory to!""

Eko looked at his phone, then back at the house. ""Okay, this is it. Let's go.""

As they walked up the driveway, a young man with glasses and a nervous expression opened the door. It was Roy. He looked at Eko, then at Malty, and finally at the cat in her arms, his eyes wide with a mixture of confusion and panic.

""Eko? What are you... and who's this?"" Roy stammered. ""Is that... Aldo's cat?""

Malty stepped forward, her regal posture returning. ""Greetings, Prince Roy,"" she said with a deep, dramatic bow. ""We have come to deliver a sacred missive.""

Eko sighed. This was going to be a long day. Roy, utterly bewildered, just stared at them. He pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose, his eyes darting from Malty to Snuggles and back again. ""A... a sacred what now?"" he asked, his voice barely a whisper. ""And why do you have Snuggles?""

Eko quickly stepped forward. ""Sorry about that, Roy. It's... a long story. We came to help you with the Stacey situation. Malty had an idea.""

Roy's eyes widened with genuine fear. ""Malty? The girl Aldo was telling me about? Oh, no. Did she... did she tell you to write a poem about the eternal flame of a thousand suns?""

Eko winced. ""Something like that. But don't worry, we fixed it."" He held out the folded piece of paper. ""We all worked on it together. It's a... modified version. You just need to read it.""

Roy hesitated, glancing nervously at Malty, who was now holding Snuggles like a ceremonial goblet. ""Is... is the cat necessary?"" he asked, his voice cracking slightly.

""He is the royal witness to the delivery of the sacred words!"" Malty declared. ""His presence blesses your quest!""

Eko shook his head. ""Just read it, Roy. Please.""

With a deep breath, Roy took the paper from Eko's hand. He unfolded it slowly, his eyes scanning the lines. As he read, his expression shifted. The panic on his face slowly melted into confusion, and then into a look of genuine surprise. He read the poem a second time, a small, tentative smile forming on his lips.

""I am a general of clumsy words,"" he murmured, reading the first line aloud. ""That's... that's pretty good. I feel like that sometimes."" He kept reading, his voice growing stronger.

*...my heart is not a grand kingdom,* *but a small, warm home, for you.*

He finished reading and looked up, his eyes glassy. ""This... this is amazing,"" he said, his voice full of genuine emotion. ""It's... it's not cheesy at all. It's what I was trying to say.""

Malty puffed out her chest proudly, while Eko just gave a relieved sigh. Roy carefully folded the poem and tucked it into his shirt pocket, right over his heart. He looked at Eko and Malty, a newfound determination in his eyes.

""Thank you,"" he said, his voice firm. ""Thank you both. I'm going to send this to her right now.""

An hour later, back at Aldo‚Äôs house, Malty and Eko waited patiently. Aldo, pacing back and forth, was biting his nails down to the quick. He had received a text from Roy, who had sent the poem to Stacey. A moment later, his phone buzzed with an incoming text from Roy. He snatched it up, his eyes widening as he read the message. A huge grin spread across his face, and he let out a whoop of triumph.

""She said yes! She loved it! She even said it was the best poem she's ever read!"" he exclaimed, doing a little dance of victory. ""We did it! We actually did it!""

He turned to Malty, his expression filled with genuine gratitude. ""Thank you, Malty. You did the right thing. The poem was a masterpiece.""

Malty, who had been blissfully playing with Snuggles, looked up at him, a regal smile on her face. ""You're welcome. Before we leave, can I bring King Snuggles to Eko's house?""

Aldo's grin vanished. He snatched Snuggles from her arms. ""Oh no you don't. He's mine.""

""Sorry, Malty,"" Eko said, stepping in to mediate. ""But the cat belongs to him. Rules are rules. You need to hand him over.""

Malty's shoulders slumped in disappointment. ""Sorry, King Snuggles,"" she said to the cat, a sad look on her face. ""It looks like the guard wants you to stay in your castle."" With one last, longing stroke to his fluffy head, she handed him over.

Just then, the front door opened, and Eko's dad walked in. He was a tall man with a friendly smile, but his eyes widened in surprise when he saw Malty.

""Eko? I'm here to pick you up,"" he said, his eyes darting between Malty and Eko. ""And... who's this?""

Eko's face turned a deep shade of red. He stammered, ""Oh, who? Malty? Yeah, that's... uhh... a long story about how I met her.""

Eko's dad just smiled. ""Her name is Malty?"" he asked, and Malty gave a small wave. ""You should marry her, Eko. I think that girl likes you.""

""Actually, she's going to stay at my house,"" Eko said quickly, trying to change the subject.

""Well, come on in, Malty!"" Eko's dad said, his smile growing even wider. ""I just got paid, and I bought a present for both of you!""

""What's that?"" Eko asked, his curiosity getting the better of him.

""A house for you and your future fianc√©e, Malty!"" his dad announced with a flourish.

Eko and Malty just stared at each other, their mouths agape.

""WHAT?!"" they both said in unison.

[Living by the water](https://keyspacerealty.com/investment-in-dubai/dubai-waterfront/) is a dream for many people. Waking up to endless blue views, feeling the breeze on your balcony, and hearing the gentle sound of waves can make life feel special. In the UAE, two of the most popular places for this lifestyle are the Dubai waterfront and the coastal areas of Sharjah waterfront. They share the same coastline, but the experience in each city is very different. If you are planning to move or invest, it helps to know what each has to offer so you choose the one that fits you best.

**Dubai Waterfront Lifestyle vs Sharjah: Which One Fits You** The Dubai waterfront is full of life and energy. Places like Dubai Marina, Bluewaters Island, and Palm Jumeirah are packed with restaurants, malls, and beach clubs. You can step outside and find something to do right away. The Dubai waterfront market is a great example of how the city mixes shopping with leisure. There are also luxury stays such as the sea view hotel Dubai and ocean view hotel options, giving the area a constant high-end feel. The Dubai waterfront is perfect for those who enjoy a busy and vibrant lifestyle.

Sharjah waterfront areas are much quieter. Places like Maryam Island and Sharjah Waterfront City offer modern buildings, boardwalks, and nice restaurants, but without the fast pace. Families walk along the water in the evenings, and children ride bikes by the promenade. The focus is on calm and community instead of non-stop activity. Sharjah waterfront living appeals to people who prefer peace over nightlife.

**Everyday Life and Atmosphere** Life in the Dubai waterfront areas suits people who enjoy being in the middle of the action. There are rooftop lounges, live music events, and beach activities almost every weekend. It is easy to spend an entire day out without leaving the neighborhood. The downside is cost. Rent, service charges, and dining prices are higher. Even a simple coffee feels premium when the caf√© is inside a sea view hotel Dubai. The ocean view hotel properties also add to the glamorous feel of the Dubai waterfront.

In Sharjah, life is slower and more family-oriented. Neighbors know each other, and evenings are about relaxing or spending time together. There is less high-end entertainment compared to Dubai, but you get a stronger feeling of home. If you like peaceful walks by the water instead of busy nightlife, Sharjah Waterfront City and other Sharjah waterfront areas might be the better choice.

**Cost of Living and Property Value** Waterfront living in Dubai is expensive. Apartments with marina or ocean views can cost two or three times more than similar homes elsewhere. Properties in Palm Jumeirah or JBR are not only about space, they are about status. The Dubai waterfront market attracts buyers willing to pay extra for the name and location.

Sharjah waterfront living is more affordable. A spacious sea view apartment in Sharjah Waterfront City can cost much less than a smaller home in Dubai. Parking, utility bills, and service fees are also cheaper, making it easier to live there long term. This draws young families, first-time buyers, and investors who want steady rental income without the high costs of the Dubai waterfront market. If you are looking for apartments or other properties for sale in the UAE, you can explore listings through[ Keyspace Realty](https://keyspacerealty.com/) or[ Keyspace Dubai](https://keyspacedubai.com/) to find options that fit your budget and lifestyle.

**Commute and Connectivity** One thing to think about with Sharjah waterfront areas is the commute. If you work in Dubai, peak hour traffic can be slow. However, new roads and better public transport are improving the situation.

Dubai waterfront areas have a big advantage here. From places like Dubai Marina or Bluewaters, you can reach Downtown Dubai or DIFC in under 20 minutes on a good day. For professionals, this convenience is a strong reason to choose the Dubai waterfront.

**Quality of Life and Environment** The Dubai waterfront is carefully maintained. There are landscaped walkways, jogging tracks, outdoor gyms, and parks for pets. Hotels like the ocean view hotel blend well with residential areas, keeping the whole place polished. The sea view hotel Dubai locations also add to the luxury lifestyle that many residents enjoy.

Sharjah waterfront living focuses on balance. Maryam Island, for example, has green spaces, walkable streets, and eco-friendly designs. The idea is to enjoy the view and modern comfort without too many high-rises crowding the skyline.

**Cultural Experience and Community Feel** The Dubai waterfront attracts people from all over the world. This makes it diverse and exciting, but it can feel less personal because residents often move in and out. Building long-term friendships might take time.

Sharjah waterfront areas are more traditional. People tend to stay longer, and community ties are stronger. You are more likely to see the same neighbors year after year in Sharjah Waterfront City, which creates a stronger sense of belonging. For families, this stability can be a big advantage.

**Which One Should You Choose** If you want an active lifestyle, luxury, and plenty of entertainment, the Dubai waterfront is the right choice. From fine dining by the marina to shopping at the Dubai waterfront market, everything is designed to impress. Staying in a sea view hotel Dubai or ocean view hotel also gives you a taste of the high-end living the city is known for.

If you prefer peace, affordable homes, and a family-friendly setting, the Sharjah waterfront is ideal. The views are just as beautiful, and the pace is more relaxed. Living in Sharjah Waterfront City offers a balanced lifestyle without the high costs of Dubai. If you are ready to explore available homes, check[ Keyspace Realty](https://keyspacerealty.com/) or[ Keyspace Dubai](https://keyspacedubai.com/) for curated property listings across the UAE.

Both cities offer something unique. The Dubai waterfront is about glamour and speed. The Sharjah waterfront is about comfort and connection. The best choice depends on whether you want the excitement of a busy city or the calm of a close-knit community.

I‚Äôm buying some items that are packaged in plastic but need to be packaged safely into my luggage with cushioning so for now I left it on the coffee table in our airbnb to figure out once its a few days before we leave. No one really seemed to have a problem with it (airbnb with 5 people including me).

I was sitting on the couch which is behind the coffee table and talking to our friends together. He‚Äôs sitting across from me at the dinner table.

He suddenly sounds angry at me and starts talking and telling me to get my shit off the table because he wants to use it too. He also talks about the night before when he told me to move it or else he‚Äôd throw all my shit on the table outside to which I explained why its there.

I start talking back about how it doesn‚Äôt even take that much room (a fifth of the table) and it‚Äôs not that big of a deal. I‚Äôll put it away once I find a safe means to pack it into my luggage.

He then quickly stands up as I stood up, grabs a wood woven tatami and slams it into my face, my glasses fly off, and my face starts burning. 

I then speak calmly at him:

‚ÄúWhy are you this upset over this? It doesn‚Äôt even take that much room and you‚Äôre hitting me across the face for no reason?‚Äù 

He responds:

‚ÄúI fucking told you to move it last night and you didn‚Äôt do anything, its still here‚Äù

Basically he continues justifying it until our friends say that it was a bit much (a bit lmfao he smashed that tatami across my face and my glasses are crooked now).

He went to his bedroom after and I went to mine after a few minutes getting ready to leave immediately (I left the house just to calm my mind and chill out a little).

I‚Äôm now questioning the kind of person he is since I‚Äôve been friends with him for years. I didn‚Äôt even say anything to piss him off and feel like I didn‚Äôt do anything that warranted even a fraction of that reaction.",1,1754732786.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

1mllfqb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1mllfqb/i_avoid_taking_the_late_night_bus/,I Avoid Taking the Late Night Bus,"I avoid taking the late night bus. If I can, I'd rather take a cab or a lift from a friend. Heck, I'd even go for a long walk back home, like I did a couple of times before. But usually I make sure to come back to my parent‚Äôs house before six o‚Äôclock in the evening. As well as block the street view from my room window with a black-out curtain. Some would say that's a bit irrational of me, but I have my reasons. I have too many experiences to count.

If you've ever had the chance to take the last bus of the night, you will probably know this feeling. The dimmed fluorescent lights, the old seats, the view outside the dusty windows of the dead sidewalks and empty roads, all illuminated by orange and yellow streetlights that shimmer like endless waves of stars around a city landscape. The quiet ambiance of it all was comforting for me back then. Especially after closing long night shifts during my time as a food server. It was a 40-minute drive from my workplace. Not too long, not too short. Just enough time for me to pull out my earphones and listen to a couple of songs before arriving back home to my solo apartment, where I would take a shower and watch a movie before going to bed. This was the only bus that reached my flat that late at night. At the time I couldn‚Äôt afford to get a driver's license.

The first weird night that I remember started off like usual. I closed off shift, changed out of my uniform, and went to the bus stop across the street. Four minutes on the dot and the rusty bus with its 90‚Äôs design arrived. Other than being refurbished on the inside, this was the only bus that didn‚Äôt get any upgrade in the city. Public transit had to cut costs, I assumed. I went to my usual seat at the back near the window as the bus slowly drove off. As per routine, no one was around except for me and the bus driver. I had taken that bus enough times to the point that I had memorized the route in my head: drive straight about twenty blocks, pass by the curve, exit to the right, and then continue on till the last stop. The last stop was near my place. As expected, we had passed the first twenty blocks. But unexpectedly, as we passed by the curve, the bus then steered to the left. For a second I thought that I might've taken the wrong bus. But I didn't. I checked the small TV screen hanging from the ceiling, and the route number was correct, along with all the names plastered in the ""next stop"" list. There were times before when the bus had taken a different route due to some construction work ahead or because of a car accident. So, I thought this was the same case. I have guessed that this would cause a 15-minute delay since the city wasn‚Äôt that big. So, I waited.

Twenty minutes passed by. Then thirty. Then forty. Then fifty. And now it's been over an hour, and the panic was settling in. I didn't recognize the area we were in anymore. There were trees instead of a city, with barely any streetlights illuminating the location. I tried to open GPS on my phone, but there was no signal. I kept clicking on the stop button, but the bus just wouldn't stop. If anything, it seemed that it went faster. And faster and faster with every click I pressed. I was just about to get up from my seat and approach the driver, but the vehicle rumbled and shook so aggressively that it practically forced me to sit back down. It was all too fast. Too hard for me to comprehend what was going on.

I remember we went through a tunnel, I think, and that for a split second I found myself inside pitch darkness. The wind shrieking through the open cracks of the window beside me almost sounded like screams in my ears. Once we got out of that tunnel, the bus suddenly stopped. I almost bashed my nose at the seat in front of me when it halted. The sound of the automatic doors opening up made me look out of the window once more. And there it was. The final stop near my home, inside the city. I got off from my seat and went out of the bus, right before the doors shut on me. My feet narrowly touched the ground as it drove off and disappeared into the horizon. I could only watch. Honestly, to say I was confused would be an understatement. I didn't really know what to think. I just went back home like nothing had happened.¬†

Two weeks had passed since then, and I had almost forgotten about that incident. Everything went on as normal and mundane as it ever was. Come to work, finish work, get back home, take a shower, watch a movie, and go to sleep. Boring, I know. But what else would you expect from someone working in customer service? It wasn‚Äôt supposed to be that interesting. However, it was when I let my guard down that it happened again.

Same as every night before, I got off work and headed to the bus stop. The bus arrived four minutes on time, and I went inside. I was about to head to my usual spot at the back, but I saw a man sitting there. This was the first time that I wasn‚Äôt alone on the bus this late at night. I didn‚Äôt bother to look at him closely. Being the average person in the situation, I simply took one of the front seats instead, and proceeded to put on my earphones and listen to some music. I was following the beat of the song as my eyes were focused on the shimmering buildings we were passing by. But slowly the rhythm got lost on me. Something didn't feel right, and I wasn't sure what it was. Not until I noticed the reflection in the window of that man sitting in the far back. His wide-shot eyes were staring right at me, piercing the back of my skull. He was sitting far away, yet even in the dimmed lights of the bus I could see his dilated pupils. The last thing you should ever do is give attention to a drug addict or a mental nutcase. That's the number one rule you should know about when living in a city. Usually, ignoring these types of people is the safest bet in most scenarios. But in this case, the man kept staring daggers at me no matter how much I tried to ignore him. I was browsing through my phone nonchalantly, tapping on random songs on my playlist and checking for new messages from friends and family. But inside my mind I was contemplating if I should get off at the next stop and get a taxi instead. I was counting in my head how much money I had left in my wallet before I glanced back at the reflection in the window again. The guy was now sitting right behind me with a wide smile. Clearly in the mood to chat.

""Heeeey""

""Hi?""

I couldn't ignore him anymore. For all I knew, I would have pissed him off if I continued up with the act. I tried to keep a calm face as he flashed me his yellow, toothy grin. His skin looked sickeningly pale under the florescent lighting.

""Watchya listening to?""

""Um, Radiohead?""

""Niiiiice, niiiiice""

His breath stank like he hadn't drunk water in weeks. But oddly enough, even though he had sounded completely drunk, there was no stench of alcohol on him. Only the scent of rot came from his mouth and clothing. He had looked as if he had gone through hell and back, and I didn‚Äôt know whether to pity him or feel more mortified.

""You know you shouldn't be here, riiiiight?""

""Why shouldn't I be here?""

""You know why...""

""I don't.""

""Hahaha!! You're funny \~""

He leaned down on the head of my chair, resting his wrists and chin on it, and talking to me as if we were best buds on a school trip. I have been told a few times in my life that I have a good poker face on me. But I have to admit. He was getting way too close for my comfort, and I found myself frantically looking for a way out. I noticed at some point that we were approaching the next stop ahead. Right then and there I decided that I should get a cab. My savings didn‚Äôt matter at this point.

""Yeah, this is my stop. I should get off now.""

The moment I said that, the smile on his face dropped. Suddenly he looked more sober. His slurred tone had gotten replaced with judgmental silence. Yet his bloodshot eyes remained all the same. Still wide as plates. As if threatening to pop out of their sockets at any second. I don‚Äôt recall him blinking even once.

""This isn't your stop."" He whispered.

The creepy atmosphere from before had instantly turned alarming. I couldn't decide what was worse. The fact that he knew what my stop was, or the chance of this guy following me to this stop like a maniac. Was he stalking me? Did I have a stalker? I didn‚Äôt know, nor did I want to find out. I needed to get out.

""You know you shouldn't be here. Right?"" He said in a hushed tone, not moving an inch. Before I could think about it, I started speaking up again and rushed out of my seat.

""I'm meeting up with a friend. I don't know what you're talking about.""

I remember pulling out my phone and pretending that I was making a call as I got off. I guess I thought at the time that pulling out my phone would somehow deter that weirdo from following me out of the bus. But he didn‚Äôt end up following me. Instead, I saw that creep watching me through the window as the automatic doors shut behind me. With his unblinking eyes...

And just like that, I have never seen that guy again.¬†

I stopped taking night shifts after that. But I still found myself in situations where I had no choice but to take that damn bus and deal with other weird shit. I could keep listing these moments on and on and on. Like how I saw a trail of dry stains throughout the whole bus with an unrecognizable stench, or how I saw an old lady sitting at the front seat mumbling to herself deliriously in a language that I couldn‚Äôt understand, and the stuff that I ended up finding under the seats. Other then chewed up gum and burnt out cigarette buds, there were always animal bones hidden somewhere on that bus. Sometimes of birds, others I am not so sure. One time there was even a deer skull, laying near an empty bag of chips. Right underneath my feet. Didn‚Äôt dare to touch that thing. However, none of these times gave me a legit reason to stop taking the bus.

Not until the incident after the night club, that is.

I wanted to get out of my typical 9-to-5 work routine, and my friends convinced me to go to a nightclub. A trashy nightclub, not too far away from my workplace, with really good cocktails. We had all planned to get blasted and stay up till dawn. But after a couple of tequila shots, just as things were getting wild, my manager texted me that I needed to fill up a morning shift for tomorrow. I was about to protest until she dropped on me that my coworker had gone through a severe car crash. There was no one else available to take over their position, and she promised me a bonus if I had made her this solid. Now thinking back on it, I should‚Äôve rejected her demand regardless. But my guilt and need for extra cash took over my pride. That‚Äôs how I ended up cutting my visit short and headed to the bus stop again. Couldn't afford to get a taxi that time around. I remember standing at the stop, tolerating the cold outside and wearing my leather jacket over my outfit. It had been a while since I dressed up for a night out. I felt really good about myself.

I was a bit tipsy, but I swear.

I swear I was aware of my surroundings that night.

Four minutes passed, the bus arrived, and to my absolute shock, it was full. Too full. As in the passengers were practically pushed onto the windows. Literally piled up on one another like a messy stack of sardines stuck in an airtight can. The doors barely opened with the amount of limbs stuck at the entrance. It looked as messy as it sounds, and I was the only one around to witness it. Instincts took over me. I turned around from that door and tried to run away from the sight. Only to realize it was a mistake when I felt a strong grip on the back collar of my jacket. That single grip turned into multiple as they were all trying to pull me into that bus.

""LET GO OF ME! LET GO!!""

I don‚Äôt remember what else I shouted and cried that night. I just remember the struggle of it all. Of me resisting the pain of nails clawing deep into my skin and pulling on my hair. Of fingers trying to clench around my neck and wrists, even trying to reach the inside of my mouth, and scraping at my teeth. It probably lasted for a minute or two until I finally heard the familiar sound of the automatic doors closing shut. But it felt far longer than that. Far more torturous. It felt disgusting. They tore off my jacket when I managed to release myself from their grip. I almost fell down face-first onto the concrete floor below me when I heard the vehicle driving away. As for what happened after that, it was all a blur. I couldn‚Äôt tell you for the life of me how I managed to get back home. And I wish I could say it was all in my head. I wish I could say it was just a weird hallucination or a dream. But the scratches and bruises that I found the next day on my back and wrists said otherwise.

Believe it or not, though, this wasn't the worst night. This was not the night that broke the final straw for me and made me leave everything.

The last night was with a coworker. Duncan.

Duncan was a newbie. Clumsy, rowdy, and as expected from a teenager working at their first job, completely careless. Nonetheless, everyone in the workplace seemed to have liked him. His friends from high school would drop by often and cause a ruckus like the punks they were, and random customers would recognize the boy immediately and chat with him at the front register for hours nonstop, from old folks to youngsters alike. He was pretty popular, basically. Other than our exchanges of hellos and goodbyes, we didn't interact that much during our shifts together. I didn't know much about this kid, nor did he bother to get to know me either. We were simply acquaintances living our own separate lives.

One afternoon when we switched shifts, Duncan came up to me and asked about the late-night bus. Apparently his girlfriend was living near my area, and her parents weren't home for the night. As he explained to me, she was about to move out of the city soon, so he was eager to visit her as often as possible. But this was his first night shift, so he didn‚Äôt know much about the bus routes from the workplace. I was hesitant to give him the details; I really was. But the kid was very determined.¬†

""It reaches the stop exactly at¬†twelve, so you‚Äôll have to be there four minutes early. Once you get in, drive till the last stop, and you will reach my area.""

""Thanks, dude! Much appreciated.""

With the bright smile he always carried on himself, he was about to head to the front register. But I grabbed at his shoulder, and he looked back at me confused. I knew I had to warn him. I could still feel those bruises and scratches plastered all over my back.¬†

""I really think you should take a taxi, though. Maybe ask one of your friends to give you a ride or something.""

He cocked an eyebrow at that. He had a very expressive face.

""But it‚Äôs expensive, man. And all my friends are, like, busy and stuff. Taking the bus is far cheaper, you know?""

""‚Ä¶Listen, just‚Ä¶"" I wanted to tell him about everything. Tell him what had happened to me. But I knew he wouldn't believe me. I had a hard time believing what I saw for myself. So why would he believe a stranger like me? If anything, he'll think I'm delusional or trying to mess with him. Nonetheless, I was still the adult in this conversation. I had to say something.

""Don't talk to any weirdos on that bus. And if anything feels off, you get off immediately. No matter what stop you're at. Okay?""

He laughed at that. Unsurprisingly...

""What are you, my mom? Seesh, relax! I won't talk to any crackheads and shit.""

""Just promise me. Promise me you'll get off that bus if anything happens, alright?""

""Fine, fine."" He waved me off and got back to work, looking as carefree as ever. Yet here I was feeling a pit in my stomach.

Duncan was such a dumb kid. But he was still just a kid. He had his parents, his own friends, and his girlfriend. The people in the city really cared about him.

So, imagine how I felt when he went missing.

The next morning his girlfriend went to our workplace to ask about his whereabouts. She looked really worried that he didn‚Äôt answer any of her calls. The manager tried to call up the kid multiple times before reaching out to his parents, his emergency contact. And his parents eventually ended up calling the police. They interrogated all of us, checked the footage of the security cameras, and went to check the bus stop where he was last seen. But nothing was found. They couldn't find him. A missing person report was filed shortly after. Three months had passed since he went missing. It was getting harder for me to focus on my job. I thought for sure that he was a goner. But then one day he came back. Just like that. Like nothing. Fucking. Happened.

All the staff members asked him where he was and what had happened, but he only gave different vague answers and stated that he didn't want to talk about it. Everyone checked on him and were happy about his arrival.¬† But I wasn't.

He was skilled, quiet, and apathetic. The complete opposite of how he used to be when he started working with us. He wasn't acting like a teenager at all. Even his manner of speech had changed. The usual ""bro,"" ""man,"" and ‚Äúdude‚Äù in his vocabulary were nonexistent. His friends would still come by, and customers would still chat with him at the front register. But the smile he wore around them seemed rather fake. When I mentioned this to the manager, she simply told me to leave him alone. Stating that Duncan was probably traumatized and going through a lot. Most of the workforce accepted that conclusion, and I did leave my coworker alone and minded my own business eventually. But every once in a while, I would catch him staring at me during work hours as I was roaming around the workstation. He didn't even try to hide it. He would just keep on looking. We were reaching the end of the month, and our manager informed us of the next month's schedule. I almost dropped¬†my cup of coffee in the morning when I noticed that she had decided to put me on night shifts with him. I called her about it immediately.

""Duncan asked me to put you with him since the both of you take the same bus route. Considering everything the poor boy went through, I decided to be considerate.""

*Considerate, my ass; you put him on night shifts again.* Is what I would have said if I had the confidence at the time. But I kept that thought to myself.

""I don't take that bus anymore; I told you that.""

""Why not? You still live at the same address, no?""

""I am, but‚Äî""

""Oh, come on, are you really going to be that petty? Grow up, Kylie. You're an adult.""

She said, like a scolding mother. And I unintentionally ended up snapping at her as a response.

""Why does he need to take that bus for?? His girlfriend doesn't even live in my area anymore! He lives on the other side of the city, for crying out loud!""

I could imagine her rubbing the temple of her nose as she sighed on the other side of the line.

""Look, I don't know. If you really have a problem with this, then talk to Duncan yourself. Otherwise, this isn‚Äôt my problem. We are low on staff for the evening, and we have too many people working around morning and noon. So, unless you can find a replacement, sweetheart, I can‚Äôt do much for you.""

""...Fine.""

And just like that, I was forced to do my first night shift in a long time. With my suspicious young coworker.

When I begrudgingly arrived to work that evening, I was already expecting the worst-case scenario. I had nightmares about him. Some of him stabbing me with a kitchen knife, others of him locking me inside the freezer. I felt myself becoming more paranoid by the day as I waited for the inevitable. I even brought my pocketknife that night, just in case. But work had surprisingly gone normal. So normal, in fact, that at some point throughout the shift, I was starting to wonder if I was overreacting. Other than the awkward silence between us, Duncan didn't do anything weird. He didn‚Äôt give me any odd looks or acted out of character for once. He was simply working the front register and smiling at the customers as he put in their orders. It was as typical as it could get. Briefly I had the relieving thought that everything was actually fine. Even as the two of us eventually changed out of our uniform, and waited for the bus together after work.

It was when we got on that bus that the silence between us had brought me back to my senses. Back to reality, if you can call it that. The white noise from the talkative customers back at work, and the wind passing through the dead highway had left once we sat down inside that old bus. There were no more distractions that could pull me out of my anxious thoughts. Not even my own phone. Once more, I am contemplating my situation, as this silence is practically torturing me. Yet Duncan was staring out the window with an unreadable expression. The streetlights gently caress his face. But the lights seem non-existent in his eyes. As if swallowed by a void of some kind rather than flickering with life.

""So, uh...how's your girlfriend?""

He didn't bother to answer me, much less look at my vicinity. I knew teenagers could be passive-aggressive sometimes, but I never thought they were that skilled at giving the silent treatment. My manager's words went through my mind once again. Maybe I was being too judgmental about that kid, I thought.

...Too judgmental about a kid who had just so happened to be wearing a very familiar-looking jacket. Something that I should‚Äôve realized sooner if I wasn‚Äôt such an idiot.

""Listen. If you want to talk about it‚Äî‚Äù

""Work sucks, doesn't it?""

For the first time in a while, he talked to me. I had almost forgotten his voice up until that point. It was definitely Duncan's voice. But something about it was different that night. The tone was more somber and rough than I had expected it to be. He continued.

""Doing the same thing over and over again...it's exhausting. Don't you ever want to get away from all that? Just take the bus and leave? Start a whole new life somewhere with a different name?""

I didn‚Äôt know what to respond.

""Well, I do. I think that's why I took the bus that night. I just wanted to get out. Get away from everything. See if I can be someone else for once in my life.""

He looked at me with an empty stare and an all-knowing grin. As if he's an old soul who has seen it all. That grin did not fit him.

""Turns out I'm a nobody. No matter where I go. But yet here I am. Still trying to be somebody. Funny, huh?""

For a moment he looks down at his own hands, curiously examining them. His words and gestures were far too melancholic for a teen his age. Was he more depressed than I thought? Is this a cry for help? I couldn‚Äôt help but get worried for a second. I was about to reach a hand to his shoulder.

""Duncan‚Äî

""He'll come back. Don't worry about it.""

I retreated my hand back as the stranger with Duncan's face cut me off. He looked back out of the window. Still with the same grin and the same dead eyes. Slightly chuckling to himself.

""Your life is boring. I won't bother with you anymore. But hey, if you do find someone interesting, bring them over. Maybe then next time we can go out for some drinks and listen to Radiohead.""

He stretched and rubbed the back of his neck with a slight crack as he charmingly smiles at me. His teeth almost look like fangs under the dim lighting.

""The drinks will be on me.""

It was not Duncan. That was not a teenager. And deeper in me I knew it was not a person. Whatever that thing was, it had spared me from something unimaginable. It took me a long time to realize that fact and think it through, but that night I was too scared to even move. He glanced out of the window again.

""Looks like it's your stop. Guess it's a farewell for now.""

""... Who are you?""

""I told you. I'm a nobody.""

As if on cue, I noticed my stop. The bus ever-so slowly brings itself to a halt. Many questions appeared in my mind, but one in particular still haunts me to this day. Who was driving the bus?

""Bye, Kylie.""

The stranger said as he waved me farewell. I got off the bus and watched it leave. I went back home. I didn't watch a movie. I didn't take a shower. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat, and I didn't d¬≠rink. All I did was sit by the door to my apartment the whole night. Making sure it was locked.

Wondering what had happened to Duncan.

I‚Äôm 22 f and my boyfriend is the same age as me. 
This is going to be quite long so stay with me, I really need help. It goes all the way back to school years. 
We used to go to the same school as kids and he bullied me. Fast forward to high school. We did occasionally bump into each other at parties but never really thought much of it. He would also text me from time to time for advice. He was madly in love with this one girl, she lead him on for 3 years, nothing ever came of it. He went to Europe for work at some point and would post some stories etc. He would like and comment on my videos from time to time. Then he texted me that he knows my family has a garden and he could send me some fun tomato seeds to plant or whatever, if I agree to go for a drink with him when he gets back. I did. I did it think much of it, just wanted to talk to someone from my past since I haven‚Äôt really been in contact with any of those people. We met up quite early in the day around 2pm and ended up having so so so much fun until 2am at some bar. We said our goodbyes and that was it. After that he started texting me every day and invited me to more ‚Äúhang outs‚Äù. The chemistry was very much there. He changed a lot, he wasn‚Äôt a stupid kid anymore, he was focused, ambitious and one of the most disciplined people I‚Äôve ever met. It impressed me. One day we went on a random trip, just got in a car and started driving. It was around 3h of driving one way. We got there around midnight and he was to tired to drive back, so I got us a big apartment with like 5 different beds. We ended up talking the whole night and when the Sun started rising we got a little playful and he tried to kiss me. I really didn‚Äôt want to. As is said before the chemistry was there, he did impress me and I found him very inspiring, interesting. But I didn‚Äôt feel that physical aspect at all. Seeing him trying to kiss me was quite repulsive. We finally did kiss. It was weird. The whole drive back felt awful and awkward. But right when he was dropping me off we got to talking about the kiss and we kissed again. It was a good kiss this time, still no excitement on my part. It felt wrong. He got invested and I got confused. He invited me to a Halloween party with his friends, some of them I knew from the past. I didn‚Äôt really know where we stood. I got very confused because I did like him a lot but I didn‚Äôt feel that spark, that physical connection, and it bothered me. And also he was confusing. He would invite me to dates, pay for me at the cinema etc. But he‚Äôd always say we‚Äôre just friends. Even tho no one asked. So when he invited me to this party I was even more confused. We decided to do a joint costume. When we got there it was all couples, everyone was drinking. I don‚Äôt really drink much since my dad is addicted and I don‚Äôt like alc in general. So I got really drunk really quickly. He would bet on sports games and stuff so at one point when he was going out to cool off and smoke with the guys he handed me his phone and told me to tell him when his best friend texts him about the bet they will be placing today. I was very drunk and very confused about my feelings, and I knew he‚Äôd text his best friend what he feels, so I decided to get some clarity. I know, so messed up. I should‚Äôve never done that. But I did. I found out, instead of taking about me, he was taking about the girl from the past. That he was thinking of her. While we were literally at a party together. Why invite me? Why act like you‚Äôre into me when you‚Äôre clearly not over something from your past? I got mad. And I started tearing up as his friend looked behind my shoulder and took the phone, exposing to everyone that I was going through his phone. We went out, me, the guy I came with and the friend who saw me with his phone. We argued for a bit, the friend, Let‚Äôs call him ‚ÄúB‚Äù was an advocate for both. It was quite funny. And then it all went downhill. We got an Uber, he said he didn‚Äôt want me to go home alone while I‚Äôm drunk and shaken up so he got in with me. We started kissing. He slept over and we did it. In the morning as well. Then when he was about to leave he told me ‚Äúwe should stop talking for a while and see if we miss each other‚Äù. At that moment everything turned red. I was furious. Not at him, at myself. I was cheated on before, in every relationship I was in. I was furious that I put myself in yet another situation like this. That I was stupid. I didn‚Äôt plan on speaking to him again but he texted me and he slowly got back into my life. He started sleeping over. Bought flowers for me, my mom, my grandma. My whole family loved him. He knew how to charm them. He was respectful, had manners and showed off. In December 2023 he asked me to be his girlfriend. I said yes. It wasn‚Äôt the first time he asked me, but previously I said I needed more time, untill I finally cracked. I felt bad, I didn‚Äôt want to say no again, and I thought that I like him so maybe it‚Äôs the slow burn kind of relationship. Previously I always felt it immediately, but maybe this is good. Boy was I wrong. We started dating and the problems kept rolling in. His work ethic used to impress me, now I despised it. I did want him to chase his dreams and focus on work, but he‚Äôd put it on a pedestal, I was never the priority. One day his friends from a different country visited and despite having to go to work at 4am the next morning, he stayed with them until midnight. Meanwhile he would stop texting me every day at sound 7pm because ‚Äúhe has to get good sleep‚Äù. It made me sad. Because he could put his friends above work, but he couldn‚Äôt do that for me. I started building resentment very early on. He called an influencer hot in front of me, and I told him ‚Äúwe‚Äôre you trying to get a reaction out of me? It‚Äôs not like she would ever look at you, so it doesn‚Äôt bother me‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt really think before saying this. He got mad. The thing about him, when he gets hurt, he doesn‚Äôt show it. He doesn‚Äôt say it. His ego gets bruised so he acted all nonchalant. I could always see through him. It truly didn‚Äôt bother me untill one day I found out he was searching for her OF pictures and pleasing himself to them. I was visiting him in his job abroad at that time. Packed my bag, and decided to leave and never speak to him again. He made me stay. He would also always tell me I‚Äôm too emotional for explaining my emotions to him. Whenever he‚Äôd hurt me, I‚Äôd tell him, and he would always undermine it. Explain himself or talk about the things that are wrong with me instead of just saying sorry or taking accountability. We moved in together, I left my entire family and moved across the country with him. I was miserable. Working 18h shifts as a waitress, while he was at home ‚Äúmaking us millionaires‚Äù. I‚Äôd come home to a sink full of dishes. He‚Äôd complain about the house being dirty. He was the one making the house dirty. I was barely there. We payed the bills 50/50. Most of the things at the house I had to buy. Like sheets, pans, kitchen utensils, cleaning supplies. He‚Äôd always say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need these things so why should I pay for them, I could cook on one old pan, sleep under one sheet‚Ä¶‚Äù but I couldn‚Äôt. He‚Äôd work from home, expect me to cook, clean, and put out. I could never rest on my day off. Whenever I‚Äôd rest he‚Äôd give me looks and complaints. How if I wanted to be successful I have to put in the work. I was working 18h shifts, cleaning, grocery shopping, cooking. While he was sitting at home ‚Äúworking‚Äù on his computer. Most of the time I‚Äôd come home to him playing league of legends with his friend. He‚Äôd say he finished working and just started the game. But the house was all messy. I would tell him that instead of playing the game he should‚Äôve at least washed the dishes. He would tell me that he didn‚Äôt have the time and that he works all day so he deserves to chill, and that I rest as well on my days off. And he said that he doesn‚Äôt like to wash dishes so I should be the one doing it, because it‚Äôs a feminine thing. I was furious. I wanted to break up with him even before I got into this relationship. But I‚Äôm a hopeless romantic and I clearly cannot learn from past mistakes. I held onto the good parts. Onto the good moments from the very beginning. But I knew I needed to get out. I did make some amazing friendships at work and I didn‚Äôt want to go back to my hometown. I had an addicted father, and I was always too absorbed into his addiction, always trying to help him, or protect my mom. I was depressed there, I was bullied. I had a very roughly childhood and no good memories from that place. There was nothing left there for me. And I also realized that the only reason I moved with my then boyfriend was because I wanted to get out of that place, I wanted to feel loved, even if it wasn‚Äôt real, I wanted to feel like I have a home. I wanted to build it. And In this new town I created a life for myself that I liked. Except for the boyfriend part. I was so torn. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I couldn‚Äôt go back to my hometown but I couldn‚Äôt exactly stay there as well‚Ä¶ and then a job opportunity fell from the heavens. I got an amazing job. I wasn‚Äôt qualified for it, i didn‚Äôt have any experience in that field. I got it by being a friend of a friend.. and I had to move, I was still across the country, but now 2 hours away from my then boyfriend. We stayed together for a bit. I was summer. He had his own busy summer business and I now had a new job. After countless fights and attempts to fix things  from me, he‚Äôd only make small changes, and repeat the worst things. It was a vicious cycle. Some more examples, he planed a trip for my birthday, plenty of activities! He gassed it up so much and I was so excited, ever since I was a teen I never really had many friends to invite to birthday parties, so I just didn‚Äôt celebrate. Me and my mom would just make a fruit salad and call it a day. And I wanted to feel special on my birthday. Like it was MY DAY. All about me. Maybe it‚Äôs selfish but it was my dream. Anyway. We get into a car and we drive to the destination, we were supposed to take a boat with desert or something like that, he didn‚Äôt take into account how long the drive would be, so we missed the boat. We went to a coffee shop instead. Then he told me we‚Äôre going to a candlelit dinner with live music in like an exotic garden. We get there, the lady tells us she doesn‚Äôt know how he booked the tickets but there‚Äôs no music or candles today, but we can sit and get some ramen for free. Yay. Then he took me to a trampoline park because one day I mentioned I wanted to go to one and feel like a kid again. We get there and the lady tells us the ticket he got was only relevant untill 6pm, it was 8pm now and the building was closing in 20 minutes so we couldn‚Äôt even buy another one. And then we just drove home. (This was back when we still lived together). The whole ride I was just silently crying while staring at the window. 
A few weeks later I found out he was watching *orn the day before my birthday I just described. Watching it WHILE PLANNING MY BIRTHDAY. A day before the actual birthday trip. Then I also found out he was sealing the ex girl, a few weeks after that. Then I also found out he lost even more money on the sport bets. He was already 50k in dept when we met, then by the time we moved in together he was around 100k in debt, and then I found out he pissed away another 30k. Great. Okay back to now. I am at this new job. It‚Äôs almost the end of the summer basically. At least where I live. We‚Äôre not together anymore, and the thing that made me break up with him was, I texted him all that was in my heart, that I didn‚Äôt feel attracted to him in the begging and all the worst things, how I felt each time he‚Äôd hurt me, how I wanted to break up with him almost every week for the entirety of our relationship. And I asked him to do the same. Pour it all out. So maybe we can start on a clean slate. He said that ‚Äúhe doesn‚Äôt really know what I mean‚Äù so I said okay. Thanks for making me feel stupid again, and that for me it‚Äôs over. He came over to my work place a few days after that wanting to talk and fix things. We went to the beach and sat on a bench. He told me how much I mean to him and that he realizes what he did and he always tried to be better but sometimes his own ego wouldn‚Äôt let him. That he‚Äôd do anything for me. That he can‚Äôt imagine his life without me. That he doesn‚Äôt want any other girl. That one of his friends said ‚Äúyou can finally party with me‚Äù but he didn‚Äôt want any of this, that he just wants to live with me again, build our relationship and our ‚Äúempire‚Äù. And then he said he thought about what I said, and that all he could come up with was that whenever I‚Äôd make him breakfast (when we still lived together) he‚Äôd look at me dancing and singing in the kitchen and having a good mood in general, he was mad, and didn‚Äôt like me. Because he didn‚Äôt understand how I could just relax while not being a millionaire. And that he‚Äôs also scared of turtles. That‚Äôs what he fucking said. I laughed in his face. Since then he‚Äôs been coming to my workplace almost every week, bringing my favorite things and flowers, taking me on dates and appreciating me, being present. Ofc I told you the worst of it, almost nothing good, but there was plenty of good as well. But the bad does surely outweigh the good. But yeah I can feel a shift and he‚Äôs present now, before he‚Äôd always have his mind somewhere else whenever we were at a restaurant or even at home. Now it feels like he‚Äôs there with me, and it feels nice. But idk if I can feel it anymore. There‚Äôs too much that transpired. But i am also very spiritual, and I do feel this weird connection to him. As you can clearly tell, he‚Äôs a piece of shit. Absolute garbage. Even with the good parts. I think I also wrote this because I needed to read it myself and remind myself why I even broke up with him. But if there‚Äôs anyone that experienced this at the beginning and came out the other end happier than ever, I‚Äôd like to know. I did learn a lot from him, inspire all of this he is still the disciplined ambiguous guy I once fell for. He‚Äôs been acting exactly how I always wanted. And the shift in his behavior started way before. He did always try to fix everything I had a problem with. But he would also still hurt me with other things. Oh he also has severe adhd. And I know I sound like a crazy person right now but I think broken people do deserve love still? And that he clearly changed his ways, he hasn‚Äôt done anything wrong since like 3/4 months. I know this sounds so stupid and wrong. But I cannot give up. I don‚Äôt know what it is. And before I would leave after things like this. As soon as I got cheated on I was out, cut off all contact and never thought about coming back or fixing this. And in my previous relationships, whenever I‚Äôd think about the future I would always see myself with girlfriends having fun, living life. At some subconscious level I knew it wouldn‚Äôt work. But with him, I can see it going both ways. I can see us together. And I never had that before. I just can‚Äôt seem to give up. And I tried so many times. I don‚Äôt know what to feel or what to do.

1mlldbf,https://www.reddit.com/r/clusterheads/comments/1mlldbf/help_advice_anything/,Help. Advice. Anything.,"Hey! I'm episodic and been cluster free for a year and a half...and of course it's come back at the WORST time! I'm in the UK and going on a 2 week roadtrip in the US tomorrow. 

This is the longest I've been CH free and I believe it's down to MS. This cycle seems odd, shadows all the time and mini attacks in the morning, bedtime and I've been woken up a couple of times. It's awful but I'm able to stay in bed and huff on my oxygen. During my worst attacks I couldn't even stay sitting. 

I've been relying heavily on my oxygen. I've  been using ice packs, redbull, coffee, VD3 and I've been micro dosing very few days the past 2 weeks. Last night I took enough to trip, I was not nice but I was willing to try it to break it. I've shadows this morning so I don't think it worked...

I have prednisone and sumatriptan nose sprays from my neurologist but I have never used them before. I don't know how they will affect me. Not sure if I'm being stupid for not taking these. This is my first time having a cluster since my diagnosis so it's my first one with medication, including oxygen. 

My go to is ice packs and oxygen and I won't have either...

My main worries are all the travelling...I have about a 16 hour travel day tomorrow including  being in an airplane for 8.5 hours and the time differents. I will be going 6 hours behind.

Any advice or help?

So 2nd update, I sat my now ex down and spoke to him about how it would be for the best that me and him need to see other people because his views and opinions on what kind of relationship he wants isnt exactly the same as mine and explained my reason's why i think it would be for the best, he responded saying ""ok, I was going to do it last night anyways because we had a conversation about me needing to spend more time with you because you think the relationship is failing because we dont spend enough time together, among other reasons why you think the relationship is failing and that I think the relationship is failing because I can't meet all your needs"" this was on the 6th of august on Tuesday (current date is the 9th of august being Saturday)

So both me and him came to a mutual agreement that it would be the best for me and him to break up and he brought it up to his mum that me and him had broken up and that it was a mutual agreement between me and him and we left it at that but then his sister came home late that afternoon and started having a go at me for breaking up with her brother after knowing everything he has gone through, I told her that it was a mutual thing and that i basically dont know why she is even butting in and making it a big issue if it was a mutual thing that both me and her brother agreed on. 

She then kept calling me a slut and a whore and every other name under the sun because she reckons I had fallen in love with someone else even though that wasn't mentioned at all and started saying that I was exactly like my father because I was apparently going off to date someone that had moved to America that I was claiming that I had known for a while and all that even though I had never dated anyone that moved to America and I had no idea what she was on about then she kept trying to twist the story of me and that person who at the time was one of my ex's who i used to be engaged to way before I even got with her brother in the first place but he never moved to America because he was born and raised in America and I tried explaining that to her but she wouldn't listen and kept talking over me.

After a bit of her basically screaming in my face, she then brought up my mental health which I had never told her about or spoken to her about because I would I tell or speak to someone who I dont trust or like at all about my mental health which means either her mother, her brother or her mother's partner told her because they were the only ones that knew and that I was trying to sort out situations outside of the relationship i had with her brother.

She continued to rant on about all of it and then she started calling me a fat, ugly, lazy piece of shit because she reckons that all I do is sit in the room and play games and that I never help around the house and that im apparently leaching off of her mum and her mums partner when she has witnessed me cleaning up the house, doing dishes, doing washing, picking up rubbish, etc, and has seen me set up items of my own in the house to help out with the house such as bathroom supplies, a new dish rack, I've even spent hundreds and thousands of dollars on toilet paper, laundry detergent, dishwasher liquid, food for dinner offered to help with other things and got told no and that they didn't need any help all while giving money to their mother money to go towards rent, bills and groceries .

I've even helped out with doing cleaning around the house and putting all my rubbish in the bin even if I have to be stuck with doing the exact same thing as I did the last time I helped out with cleaning the house without any complaints while she has barely even helped out around the house at all, I think she has only done dishes 2 times since I've been here and she has complained that she is always stuck with doing the dishes while all the other times she was supposed to do them, she refused to do them because she was always stuck doing the dishes even though she chose to do the dishes willingly.

But she is choosing to blame other people's rubbish on me that other people barely put in the rubbish and leave laying around the house while I basically clean up after them when its time to clean and the thing that I dont understand about her claims that I apparently leave rubbish all over the place and never clean up after myself, how can she immediately blame other rubbish that is laying around the house thats not anywhere in the bedroom where she claims that I am 24/7 and when I own my own rubbish bin which sits in the bedroom with me which I use only for cotton swabs, paper, cardboard and other things similar to them so how can she blame be for every single bit of rubbish laying around outside of the bedroom and scattered all over the floor and counters and everywhere else not in the bedroom if she claims I'm always in the bedroom and she knows I have my own bin in the bedroom that I always put my rubbish in.

And she has also claimed that she has had to clean up after me multiple times and had to wash all of my dishes when the only dishes I mainly uses are my own and I always wash my own dishes after I use them if someone else hasn't taken my dirty dishes to use for their own food or to make themselves coffee's, etc, and i also dont own that many dishes either because I only own 4 pink plastic cups (1 of them are missing and one i found with half of the cups snapped off so its unable to be used leaving me with only 2 pink cups, 4 purple cups (only have been able to obtain 1 out of the 4 because the other 3 are missing because other people keep using my cups when I've made it very clear that they are mine and if anyone else wants to use them they would need to ask me because they are my cups but no one has ever asked to use them and just uses them anyways), i was supposed to have 3 coffee mugs but one broke ages ago and ive managed to find the other 2 but one of them is missing a handle due to it breaking off somehow and I used to have a nutribullet blender but according to my now ex, his sister was the last one that touched it and the entire blender is missing and ive been trying to look for it since about September last year and I still haven't found yet along with a cup with the band kiss on it which i mainly use for when i have a coffee.

So with all of my dishes that I personally own and use, the only about of dishes I could get back was 2 coffee mugs and 3 plastic cups so thats like 5 dishes out of like 12 or 13 dishes that I personally own not including the reusable straws I had which would make it about 14-15 dishes in total i had all together and pretty much everyone except for my ex hasn't bothered to help me look for my other cups and my nutribullet that I had paid for and I had owned way before even coming here to live with them because I had no where else to go at the time.

And out of all the accusations she was throwing at me which both me and her knew weren't true at all that I found to be the most bullshit out of all of them was that she was saying I was eating all of their food and leaving fuck all for everyone else when it's actually been my ex and his mother eating most of the food because they eat a lot more food than me and their mothers partner because how am I supposed to know what food is out there if I dont see any of it or dont get told until its dinner time and thats it, the only people that would know would be my ex partner and his mother because she pays for most of the shopping while my ex partner would help with putting it away and I wouldn't know when the shopping would get here or when it would be purchased which that also didn't line up with her accusation that im always in the room doing nothing but sitting on my fat ass playing games.

Some of the other things that she was accusing me of was also apparently saying that the dude that lives in America is a 40yr old guy and that i was dating him and that either way it wouldnt matter because i would be into that sort of thing and yet she has been dating someone who is in their 20's since she was either 16 or 17 and was letting him be in the shower with her at that time and letting him leave hickies and shit on her back while her and everyone else knew she was under the legal age so doing anything remotely sexual no matter how vanilla or explicit it may be.

She also kept calling me a feral all because i hadnt had the chance to clean my cats litter box because ive been so caught up and busy dealing with other issues that i am currently trying to get out of and saying that there was maggots all through my cats litter and the mattress that i have to sleep on which she had previously owned before giving it to me and my ex when i was with him.

So now I've currently been packing all of my belongings while waiting for people who are apart of my other issues outside of the relationship i had with my ex to inform me about a place being available for me to move into with my cats.

So yea thats the last and final update I have for you all hope the people that read this enjoy their time reading it and hopefully I dont have to do anymore updates on the whole situation.",0,1754731983.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,0.5,False

I really liked her alot since the start, but initially she didnt feel the same way, but we continued to stay friends (like best friends, who talk everyday all the time). 10th grade we spent together, she was in my class and we would sit on the back bench and talk all day, id say jokes and she'd laugh. I was pretty insecure and possessive tho throughout and even if she would walk around the school as friends with another guy, id be really pissed and become dry with her, im sorry i just cant control it. Around the end of 10th grade, just after boards, she fell for me on a school trip and we had some magic moments of walking with arms locked and all that, but it was pretty superficial. We also went to the beach once, and I told her that we both need to go to IIT together. Shortly, JEE prep started for both of us and i was pretty devastated that we werent going to the same coaching, but soon I was quite okay with it. We kinda retransitioned back from our relationship to just really good friends. We used to call everyday during the start, but as 12th grade came, we were both really busy and just spoke on text. She was a topper throughout her life, and thats what would push me to do my best (she is going to get in, now i have to, too). Fast forward to JEE Mains result, she fell off from her topper position, and i feel really bad for her, as she was pretty lonely throughout the prep, and shes not the type of person who discusses her problems. I was always just a message away, but she would always just stay completely locked up in her room studying, and after a point its kinda mindnumbing, and ruins ur mental health. Single child, always at home alone, both parents working. Anyways, I cleared mains and advanced and am now at IITB, and she is also joining a local college in Mumbai thru CET, obviously not what we hoped for, but im glad she's here in Mumbai. Here is where the problem is, even tho we would talk daily, there were always mixed signals and tbh i never felt she liked me. We still talked daily, platonically. One day out of the blue, she asked me whether we should give it a shot, and obviously i said yes. We even went on a date to a coffee shop & beach afterwards few weeks back. I to this day am very insecure and possessive about her, and i really love her, id do anything to make her happy. Last week she told me about a Vir Das show and one guy from our school in 10th has invited her to come along. I told her that I dont want her to go alone w him, maybe we can go sometime. She also knows by now obv how possessive i am. She agreed initially with me, but day before yesterday she changed her mind and obv i was not okay w it, but im not anybody to stop her. She will be going tomorrow with him to Vir Das, and ima be at home depressed about it, she also stopped talking to me since then now. SHe says she's going for vir das and not for the guy obv, but i just feel like if i were in her place id refuse to go in a heartbeat if she told me she wasnt okay. I also just feel like shes interested in me now because ive gotten into IITB.

TLDR; Ive been extremely insecure and possessive about her and she knows, we've known each other like best friends 4 yrs, started dating just few weeks back and now she wanna go for a comedy show with another guy, even tho i told her im not okay with it. Also got into iitb recently, and i think thats why she is interested in me, not me as a person

1mll4qv,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultsurvivors/comments/1mll4qv/never_felt_true_safety/,Never felt true safety,"Since my dad sexually (and emotionally) abused me from somewhere between 0-8 years old, and we all lived together until I was 20, I‚Äôve never felt true safety. It‚Äôs been one of those aha-experiences that bamboozled me the most. Clearly I‚Äôve been hyper vigilant all of my life and just didn‚Äôt know it, even when I‚Äôm alone with just myself.

I‚Äôve been trying to do EMDR but after just 10 sec my whole body becomes warm, I get red spots, my throat tightening and it feels like I‚Äôm going to explode or smth. 

We started to practice safety instead, and after trying and failing two times, the third time I finally calmed my inner child until a saw an image of my mom‚Äôs chest in her old bathrobe flashing by. That was the safest thing I knew as a child and it wasn‚Äôt even safe since she couldn‚Äôt truly comfort me. She didn‚Äôt know why I was crying. I think my dad threatened to kill mom if I ever told the truth, since I repeatedly said I was afraid mom would die but no explanation of why. 

Anyway a huge wave of energy released after that image and I started CRYING. Like loud. Then we talked abt it and after that session I felt 10 kg lighter, it was easier to breathe, the music sounded better and the world looked prettier and much calmer.

That evening I was watching a Disney movie when it became much harder to breathe and my heart started to ache badly. I realized I was abt to have my first panic attack but i managed to control it after one hour of grounding, putting my head in the freezer, splashing water, breathing, sniffing coffee and calming my inner child lol

After this session I‚Äôve been slowly getting more closed up again and not able to process the trauma. I get that it‚Äôs my ‚Äúcontainer‚Äù that‚Äôs expanding and contracting. 

I know I‚Äôm going to have to keep practicing safety, and letting my therapist see my body‚Äôs reaction and not judge me and just sit with it. 

I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone else has dealt with this - any advice? 

I truly feel like If I learn how to feel safe, my body won‚Äôt feel like a prison anymore and I could say and do everything that I‚Äôve always wanted. It‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ I feel like I would be unstoppable, I could achieve anything. 

I‚Äôve done EVERYTHING in my life in fight or flight - and accomplished a lot (to feel worthy and that life is worth living), I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ so hopeful to see what I can do when I feel true safety.",1,1754731039.0,adultsurvivors,1,1.0,False

1mll3ko,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mll3ko/sick_day_final_part/,Sick Day - FINAL PART,"*I found one of Dad‚Äôs old flannel shirts today. The green one with the ripped cuff he always wore when working on the truck.*

*It still smelled like him.*

*I sat in the garage holding it for almost an hour. Just breathing.*

*And then I looked up at the ceiling‚Ä¶ and I could¬†feel¬†the attic above me.*

*I need to keep going. I need to get through it.*

*Thursday. 2003*

I came into the kitchen around 7:45AM, my cast already starting to itch and the whole left side of my body sore like I‚Äôd gone ten rounds with a semi-truck.

The sun was shining through the curtains, warm and golden, like nothing was wrong. Like nothing had ever happened.

Mom was at the stove, poking at eggs she clearly didn‚Äôt want to eat. Her hair was pulled into a low, messy bun, and she had that¬†*tight smile*¬†on her face. The one she wore when things were bad, but she didn‚Äôt want me to know they were bad.

Dad sat at the table, already showered and dressed, black coffee in front of him. His work boots were beside his chair, unlaced. He hadn‚Äôt touched his toast.

Tori sat across from him, pushing a spoon through a bowl of cereal and scowling like we‚Äôd personally ruined her life.

‚ÄúHey, kiddo,‚Äù Mom said when she saw me. ‚ÄúHungry?‚Äù

I shrugged. ‚ÄúNot really.‚Äù

I slid into the chair beside Dad and winced as I bumped my cast against the table.

He glanced over, then reached out and gently adjusted my plate so I wouldn‚Äôt have to move it.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôs the wrist?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúSore.‚Äù

He nodded. ‚ÄúDoctor says it‚Äôs a clean break. You‚Äôre lucky.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt feel lucky.

I felt like something had reached out of the dark and tried to¬†pull me back in.

Tori let out a loud sigh and crossed her arms. ‚ÄúSo what‚Äîhe just gets to stay home all week now?‚Äù

Mom shot her a look. ‚ÄúVictoria.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? I‚Äôm just saying‚Äî*some*¬†of us have finals next week.‚Äù

Dad sipped his coffee. ‚ÄúThe doctor gave him a note for the rest of the week.‚Äù

Tori rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúOf course he did.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe has a broken arm,‚Äù Mom said, her voice thin.

‚ÄúAnd a head full of ghosts,‚Äù Tori mumbled under her breath.

‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù Dad asked, his voice sharp.

‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù she said, but she didn‚Äôt look at me. Just stared at her spoon like it had personally offended her.

Dad sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose. ‚ÄúI have to go back in today. I told Jim I‚Äôd cover the shop until at least Friday.‚Äù

Mom nodded quietly.

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt leave him here alone,‚Äù Dad added. ‚ÄúNot with his arm like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll stay,‚Äù Mom said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll call out.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù He shook his head. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve already missed two shifts. I called Mom this morning. She‚Äôs gonna come over and sit with him today.‚Äù

I froze.

‚ÄúGrandma?‚Äù I asked, trying not to sound¬†*too*¬†twelve about it.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôll be here by ten,‚Äù Dad said, like that was the end of it.

I looked at Mom, hoping she might object‚Äîbut she didn‚Äôt. She just smiled, soft and sad. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll like the company. She‚Äôll probably bring muffins.‚Äù

Tori snorted.

I just stared down at my plate, appetite gone.

I didn‚Äôt want muffins.

I wanted someone to believe me.

After everyone left, the house went quiet.

I watched through the front window as Dad backed the truck out of the driveway, Mom in the passenger seat, Tori slouched in the back. She gave me one last dramatic look before disappearing behind the glare of the window glass.

I listened to the garage door groan shut.

Then silence.

Just me.

I turned on the TV in the living room and laid down on the couch, cast resting on a pillow. The cartoons were bright and loud, but they didn‚Äôt do much to quiet the rest of the house. The attic was still up there. Still waiting.

I glanced at the clock. Grandma wasn‚Äôt supposed to be there for another hour and a half.

I‚Äôd just started zoning out to¬†*Pokemon*¬†reruns when‚Äî

*Knock knock knock.*

Three quick knocks at the front door.

I sat up fast, heart racing.

Not because I was scared, but because¬†*no one*¬†ever knocked that early unless it was a delivery or something bad.

I peeked through the peephole.

Three kids stood on the porch.

Zack, Taylor, and Blake.

My friends.

Well‚Äîsort of.

We ate lunch together, played¬†*Super Smash Bros.*¬†whenever someone had a sleepover, and texted more than we actually talked in class. They weren‚Äôt the most popular kids, but neither was I.

Zack¬†had a backpack slung over one shoulder and was holding a manila folder. Blake stood with his hands in his hoodie pockets, his hair a mess like he barely made it out of bed. And¬†Taylor‚Äîshort, sharp-eyed, in a jean jacket way too big for her‚Äîhad a Yoo-hoo in one hand and a silver pack of Pop-Tarts in the other.

I opened the door with my good hand.

‚ÄúDuuude,‚Äù Taylor said, eyebrows raising as she looked at my cast. ‚ÄúYou actually broke it?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo way,‚Äù Blake muttered, leaning closer like he was gonna poke it. ‚ÄúYou fell out of the¬†*attic*?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, stepping aside. ‚ÄúYou guys wanna come in?‚Äù

They didn‚Äôt need a second invitation.

They crashed into the living room like we did every Saturday.¬†Zack¬†handed me the folder.

‚ÄúMs. C said to give you your makeup work,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe told her we‚Äôd stop by before school.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd my mom only said yes ‚Äòcause I told her you were¬†*tragically injured,*‚Äù Taylor added, tossing the extra Pop-Tarts she had in her backpack onto my lap. ‚ÄúStrawberry. You‚Äôre welcome.‚Äù

I sat down and pulled my blanket over my legs.

‚ÄúThanks, guys. Seriously.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid it hurt?‚Äù Blake asked, flopping into the recliner. ‚ÄúFalling, I mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike a lot?‚Äù

‚ÄúLike someone tried to rip my arm off.‚Äù

Taylor let out a low, long whistle. ‚ÄúMetal.‚Äù

Zack¬†gave her a look. ‚ÄúHe could‚Äôve died.‚Äù

‚ÄúStill metal,‚Äù she shrugged, cracking open her Yoo-hoo.

Then Zack tilted his head. ‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ why were you even up there?‚Äù

I hesitated.

I looked at them‚Äîall three.

They weren‚Äôt jerks. They weren‚Äôt like the kids who whispered about me in the hallway. And they‚Äôd come all this way, early, before school, just to check on me.

So, I told them.

Everything.

About Mollie barking at the walls. About the noises in the attic at night. About sneaking up there with my lightsaber, and the nest. The scratching. The shape in the dark. The fall. The hand. The attic door¬†*slamming shut on its own.*

Their faces changed.

Taylor sat forward slowly; Pop-Tart half-crushed in her hand now.

Zack didn‚Äôt blink.

And Blake said, softly, ‚ÄúDude‚Ä¶ what the hell?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou think something‚Äôs living up there?‚Äù Taylor asked, eyes darting toward the ceiling.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI¬†*know*.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt chased you?‚Äù Zack asked. ‚ÄúLike‚Äî*actually*¬†chased you?‚Äù

I nodded.

‚ÄúI heard it breathe,‚Äù I whispered.

They all looked up at once.

The attic was directly above the living room.

And the house suddenly felt smaller. Quieter. Like we‚Äôd said something out loud we weren‚Äôt supposed to.¬†

For a long time, nobody spoke.

Then Blake whispered, ‚ÄúWhat if it‚Äôs listening?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say that,‚Äù Taylor said, smacking his arm.

‚ÄúNo, seriously.‚Äù Blake shifted nervously in his seat. ‚ÄúWhat if it knows you‚Äôre home alone right now?‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, you‚Äôre freaking yourself out,‚Äù Zack said. But his eyes hadn‚Äôt left the ceiling.

A faint creak echoed from somewhere upstairs.

All three of them jumped.

I clenched my blanket in one hand. ‚ÄúIt does that a lot. Usually at night. Sometimes it‚Ä¶ moves around.‚Äù

Zack stood and grabbed his backpack. ‚ÄúWe should go.‚Äù

‚ÄúDude, come on,‚Äù Taylor said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not gonna leave him here alone with that thing crawling around the attic.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have school,‚Äù he said, but his voice was shaking now. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs not like we can do anything about it in the middle of the day.‚Äù

Taylor looked over at me.

I could see it in her face. She wanted to help. She just didn‚Äôt know how.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs come back after school,‚Äù she said suddenly. ‚ÄúLike, tonight. I‚Äôll ask my mom if I can stay over.‚Äù

‚ÄúMe too,‚Äù Blake said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell my dad I‚Äôm staying at Zack‚Äôs.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy my house?‚Äù Zack asked.

‚ÄúBecause you‚Äôre boring and trustworthy,‚Äù Taylor shot back. ‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôre gonna need someone to bring snacks.‚Äù

Zack rolled his eyes but didn‚Äôt argue.

I nodded slowly. ‚ÄúOkay. Yeah. Tonight.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll bring flashlights,‚Äù Blake said. ‚ÄúAnd, like‚Ä¶ salt. Isn‚Äôt that a thing?‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly if you‚Äôre fighting ghosts,‚Äù Taylor muttered. ‚ÄúThis thing‚Äôs not a ghost. It‚Äôs something¬†*else.*‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, well‚Ä¶ what¬†*is*¬†it then?‚Äù

We all looked at each other.

No one had an answer.

Then‚Äî

BANG. BANG. BANG.

We all screamed.

Taylor nearly dropped her Yoo-hoo.

‚ÄúWHO‚ÄôS READY FOR MUFFINS?‚Äù a voice called through the front door.

‚ÄúOh my god,‚Äù Blake gasped, clutching his chest. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna piss.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just my grandma,‚Äù I muttered, stumbling to my feet.

I opened the door and there she was:¬†Grandma. Gray sweater. Big smile. A basket of muffins in one hand, an off-brand orange juice jug in the other.

‚ÄúOh! I didn‚Äôt know you had company!‚Äù she beamed.

Taylor stood, adjusting her oversized jacket. ‚ÄúWe were just leaving. School. You know.‚Äù

‚ÄúUh-huh,‚Äù Grandma said, eyeing the three of them with that warm, old-lady suspicion that could melt concrete. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôll keep an eye on our patient here. Don‚Äôt worry.‚Äù

Zack cleared his throat. ‚ÄúSee you later.‚Äù

‚ÄúAfter school,‚Äù Taylor whispered to me as she passed.

Then she was gone.

All three of them, heading back down the porch and across the lawn, glancing over their shoulders like the house might try to follow.

Grandma shut the door behind them and turned to me, her smile softening.

‚ÄúYou look pale,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWant to sit with me while I knit? Or would you rather go lay down?‚Äù

I stared up at the ceiling.

At the attic.

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm good right here,‚Äù I said quietly.

Grandma made me a grilled cheese and tomato soup and insisted I eat every bite, even though I wasn‚Äôt hungry.

She didn‚Äôt ask a lot of questions. Just hovered, smiling gently, pouring me juice, tucking the blanket around my legs again even after I kicked it off. She had that quiet, steady kind of love that made you feel guilty for keeping secrets.

After lunch, she flipped through the channels until she landed on a soap opera‚Äîsomething about twins and betrayal and a baby that might be cursed‚Äîthen settled into the recliner with her knitting needles clacking softly in her lap.

By the time the second commercial break hit, she was out cold. Head tilted, mouth slightly open, one hand still tangled in blue yarn.

The house was quiet again.

Except for the TV.

I left it on and padded down the hall. My wrist still ached, but the pills from the hospital were finally working. I just needed to pee and splash some water on my face.

I pushed open the bathroom door with my good hand and stepped inside.

The door swung closed behind me.

Click.

I turned the faucet on. Let the water run.

And then‚Äî

Footsteps.

Fast.

*Slapping*¬†across the hardwood floor outside.

I spun around.

Something hit the bathroom door.

Hard.

The whole thing shuddered on its hinges.

I backed up.

My heart was racing now, pounding in my ears.

Then‚Äî

A hand curled around the edge of the door.

Long fingers. Grayish skin. Black, cracked nails.

It gripped the doorframe like it was trying to keep me in.

‚ÄúNo no no‚Äî‚Äù I whispered, shoving against the door.

It didn‚Äôt move.

I pressed my back to the wall, eyes darting around the room, breath catching in my throat.

That‚Äôs when I heard it.

A low, rattling breath.

Not from the other side of the door.

From above.

I looked up‚Äîslowly.

The¬†vent above the toilet¬†was rattling slightly, the metal slats twitching like something was pressing against them from the inside.

A soft scrape echoed through the vent.

Then a finger.

Then another.

It was crawling out.

The vent cover popped loose with a soft¬†*ping*, clattering to the floor.

Something slid through.

Long limbs. Pale skin. Elbows that bent the wrong way.

It dropped into the bathtub behind the¬†shower curtain¬†with a heavy¬†*thump*.

I couldn‚Äôt move.

The room was dead quiet.

Except for the sound of it¬†breathing¬†behind the curtain.

Each breath made the plastic¬†suck in, then puff out again.  
Suck in‚Äîpuff out.

I could see the shape of it now, faint and twisted behind the floral print.

Then the curtain¬†moved.

Just slightly.

Just enough.

Like it was leaning closer.

I opened my mouth to scream‚Äî

The door yanked open.

Light flooded in.

The hallway. Grandma‚Äôs voice, faint: ‚ÄúSweetheart?‚Äù

I¬†ran.

Out of the bathroom, past her, down the hall, gasping, heart hammering like it was going to crack through my ribs.

She followed, confused, knitting still wrapped around her wrist.

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù she called after me. ‚ÄúAre you okay?¬†

Grandma hurried in behind me, a mess of yarn still tangled around her wrist. ‚ÄúWhat on earth‚Äî? What happened?‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt speak at first. My chest was tight. My wrist throbbed. My heart was doing somersaults.

She crouched down beside me, one hand on my shoulder. ‚ÄúWas it your arm again? Did something‚Äî?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was in the bathroom,‚Äù I whispered.

Her brow furrowed.

‚ÄúWhat was, sweetheart?‚Äù

‚Äú*It.*‚Äù I pointed down the hallway. ‚ÄúIt grabbed the door. It came through the vent. It dropped into the tub‚ÄîI saw it. I¬†*heard*it.‚Äù

She stood slowly, eyes narrowing just a little.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll go check.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo‚Äîdon‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù

But she was already walking. She walked to the kitchen and pulled a large knife from the knife block.

I watched her disappear down the hall, every second stretching out like rubber. I thought maybe I‚Äôd hear her scream. Or call for help. Or say something¬†*anything*‚Äî

But when she came back, she just shook her head.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing there,‚Äù she said gently. ‚ÄúNo handprints, no vent cover on the floor, no mess in the tub.‚Äù

My stomach twisted.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not possible,‚Äù I said.

Her smile didn‚Äôt reach her eyes. ‚ÄúI think you might‚Äôve dozed off and had a nightmare.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was¬†*awake.*‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt argue.

She just picked up her knitting and settled back into the recliner.

The house stayed quiet for the rest of the afternoon. Too quiet.

By the time my parents got home, I was already standing at the foot of the stairs, waiting for them.

Dad looked exhausted. His eyes were bloodshot, and his uniform shirt had a grease stain down the front.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still up?‚Äù he asked, tossing his keys into the bowl on the side table.

‚ÄúI need to ask you something.‚Äù

He raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

I hesitated. Then said, ‚ÄúCan Zack, Taylor, and Blake come over?‚Äù

Dad blinked. ‚ÄúTonight?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust for a little while. Maybe a sleepover. Nothing big.‚Äù

He glanced at Mom, who looked at me with that tired mom-face that says¬†*not tonight,*¬†but also¬†*we feel bad for you.*

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, bud,‚Äù Dad said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still healing. And I‚Äôm beat.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey already asked their parents,‚Äù I lied quickly. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre bringing flashlights and movies. It‚Äôs just to hang out. I swear.‚Äù

He rubbed his temples. ‚ÄúYou sure you‚Äôre up for that? After the hospital and‚Äîeverything?‚Äù

I nodded, trying to keep my voice steady. ‚ÄúYeah. I just‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt want to be alone tonight.‚Äù

Something in that hit him. He didn‚Äôt say anything for a moment.

Then he sighed and reached for his phone. ‚ÄúTell them to be here by nine. Quiet night. No roughhousing.‚Äù

I nodded again. ‚ÄúYes. Thank you.‚Äù

He headed for the kitchen. ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt go back in the attic. I mean it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt,‚Äù I said.

That was a lie too.¬†

The doorbell rang at 8:47PM.

Blake was the first one through the door, backpack half unzipped, his hoodie sleeves pulled over his hands. ‚ÄúYo,‚Äù he grinned, like we hadn‚Äôt just seen each other earlier that morning.

Taylor came in next, wearing flannel pajama pants with little bats on them and carrying a flashlight the size of a baseball bat. ‚ÄúWe come bearing snacks and questionable judgment.‚Äù

Zack followed with a tote bag full of supplies‚Äîflashlights, batteries, two packs of Oreos, and a sketchpad covered in doodles. ‚ÄúMy mom gave us Capri Suns, but Taylor chugged most of them in the car.‚Äù

I laughed‚Äîactually laughed‚Äîand stepped back to let them all in.

Then Tori came down the stairs in her tank top and pajama shorts, holding her phone and looking¬†*thoroughly unimpressed*.

Blake froze halfway through dropping his backpack.

‚Äú...Hey,‚Äù he said, all casual-like, but his voice cracked halfway through it.

Tori raised one eyebrow. ‚ÄúHey.‚Äù

She looked at me. ‚ÄúIf these dorks eat all the pringles‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWe have our own snacks‚Äù¬†

Blake turned to me, ‚Äúis she going to join us?!‚Äù¬†

¬†‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not invited.‚Äù

She rolled her eyes and started walking toward the kitchen. Blake stared after her like she was the sun and he was an unsupervised moth.

‚ÄúIs she staying home tonight?‚Äù he whispered.

‚ÄúShe¬†*lives*¬†here,‚Äù Taylor said. ‚ÄúStop being weird.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not being weird,‚Äù Blake muttered.

‚ÄúYou literally¬†*stared at her forehead*¬†like it had the answers to the universe.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs too old for you, Blake,‚Äù Zack said, dropping the tote bag with a thud.

‚ÄúAge is just a number,‚Äù Blake replied.

‚ÄúAnd restraining orders are just paperwork,‚Äù Taylor deadpanned.

We moved into the living room and laid everything out: sleeping bags, pillows, snacks, the flashlight arsenal. I put on¬†*Tremors*‚ÄîBlake‚Äôs pick‚Äîbecause he claimed it was ‚Äúeducational‚Äù for people dealing with underground monsters.

Taylor was already halfway into the Oreos, and Zack was organizing the batteries like we were about to defuse a bomb.

It felt normal. For a little while.

The monster didn‚Äôt feel so close.

We laughed too loud. The movie jumped a couple times because our DVD player was scratched, and Blake kept yelling ‚ÄúTHIS IS FORESHADOWING‚Äù every time Kevin Bacon did anything brave.

But under it all, we were waiting.  
Waiting for the house to go quiet.

Waiting for the lights to go out.  
For my parents to retreat upstairs.

At around 10:40PM, they finally did.

We heard Mom‚Äôs voice say, ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt stay up all night,‚Äù and then Dad‚Äôs muttered ‚ÄúThey better not wreck the furniture.‚Äù

Footsteps on the stairs.

The creak of the bedroom door.

Silence.

Taylor muted the movie.

We all looked at each other.

Zack was the first to speak. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ we doing this?‚Äù

Taylor nodded. ‚ÄúI say we check the attic. All of us. Flashlights, snacks, slingshot‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI forgot the salt,‚Äù Blake said.

‚ÄúNo one asked for salt,‚Äù she hissed.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just saying, if it¬†*is*¬†a ghost, we‚Äôre unprotected.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a ghost,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs something else. Something that breathes and moves and¬†*hurts*¬†things.‚Äù

Everyone went quiet.

‚ÄúI want to know what it is,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI need to know.‚Äù

Zack sat forward. ‚ÄúThen we make a plan. In and out. If anything feels off, we¬†*leave*. No hero stuff.‚Äù

Blake nodded, clutching his flashlight like a sword.

Taylor grinned and cracked her knuckles. ‚ÄúMonster-hunting club begins tonight.‚Äù

We turned off the movie.

And started getting ready.

We stood in the hallway beneath the attic hatch, flashlights in hand, all four of us staring up at the square in the ceiling like it might blink.

The pull string was gone.

Blake tapped the ceiling with a¬†plastic Wiffle bat¬†he‚Äôd brought for ‚Äúbackup,‚Äù as if the attic might just open for effort. It didn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶‚Äù he whispered, ‚Äúdo we have a plan? Or are we just standing here until the attic gets bored and eats us?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got it,‚Äù Taylor said, stepping back and dragging over a¬†folding step stool¬†she‚Äôd pulled from the laundry room. She thudded it into place beneath the hatch, climbed up two steps, and squinted at the latch. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a little out of reach. I need something to pop it open.‚Äù

Blake held out a¬†ruler¬†with duct tape wrapped around the tip. ‚ÄúCustom made.‚Äù

Taylor blinked. ‚ÄúWhy do you¬†*have*¬†that?‚Äù

‚ÄúFor science.‚Äù

Zack just shook his head and held up the¬†metal rod from a broken curtain¬†they found in the garage. ‚ÄúTry this instead.‚Äù

Taylor smirked. ‚ÄúMuch better.‚Äù

She stretched on the top step, flashlight clamped under her arm, and jabbed the rod upward. It took a few tries, but finally‚Äîclick.

The latch gave.

The attic door didn‚Äôt fall open fast‚Äîit creaked down slow, groaning the way old wood does in scary movies, until the opening yawned above us.

We all stared at the darkness inside.

‚ÄúI am regretting this,‚Äù Blake whispered.

‚ÄúYou regret everything,‚Äù Zack said.

‚ÄúI regret¬†*being friends with you,*‚Äù Blake shot back.

I stepped forward with my cast cradled close. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll hold the ladder steady. When you all get up there you can pull me up.‚Äù

‚ÄúI got it,‚Äù Taylor said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go first.‚Äù

Just as she grabbed the top rung of the attic ladder‚Äî

‚ÄúWhat the hell are you doing?‚Äù

We all jumped.

Blake actually gasped. Zack swore under his breath.

Tori¬†stood at the end of the hallway, holding a¬†half-eaten Pop-Tart¬†in one hand and looking like she‚Äôd caught us trying to summon the devil.

‚ÄúSeriously?‚Äù she said, eyeing the gear. ‚ÄúThis is your plan?‚Äù

‚ÄúI told you to stay in your room,‚Äù I muttered.

Tori ignored me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going up there now? With a broken arm, a ruler, and¬†*Blake*?‚Äù

‚ÄúI brought a foam sword too,‚Äù Blake added helpfully.

‚ÄúI rest my case.‚Äù

Taylor gave her a slow blink. ‚ÄúYou coming over here just to roast us or‚Ä¶?‚Äù

Tori stared up at the attic, her face hard to read.

Then, without another word, she walked over, took the flashlight from Zack‚Äôs hand, and stepped beside the ladder.

She didn‚Äôt look at me. Just stared into the black square above.

‚ÄúMollie was my dog too.‚Äù

The hallway went quiet.

Blake blinked at her like she‚Äôd just confessed a crush. Taylor actually looked impressed. And Zack‚ÄîZack didn‚Äôt say a word. He just adjusted the flashlight beam.

Tori stepped up beside Taylor.

‚ÄúWe going,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúor are we gonna stand here all night waiting to pee our pants?‚Äù

The attic creaked as we climbed in one by one.

Taylor went first, her flashlight cutting a shaky beam across the dust-heavy air. Blake followed, muttering ‚Äúnope, nope, nope‚Äù under his breath the entire time. Zack climbed behind him, trying to pretend he wasn‚Äôt breathing fast. I was last, hoisting myself up one-handed while Tori reached down and helped steady me with surprising care.

The air was warmer than it should‚Äôve been‚Äîthick, almost humid. It smelled like insulation and mildew and something¬†*sweet*¬†underneath, like rotting fruit or meat left out too long.

‚ÄúUgh, it smells like someone microwaved a diaper,‚Äù Blake whispered, holding his shirt over his nose.

‚ÄúNo one light a match,‚Äù Zack said. ‚ÄúThe air up here might be flammable.‚Äù

We all stood together under the low, angled ceiling. The old Christmas boxes were still stacked near the wall. The fan blades Dad took down three summers ago were still leaning in the corner.

But the¬†nest‚Äî

The thing I saw two nights ago, made of insulation and shredded blankets and god-knows-what else‚Äî

Was gone.

‚ÄúWait,‚Äù I said, spinning slowly in a circle. ‚ÄúWait, no. No, it was¬†*right here.*‚Äù

I stepped toward the far corner, flashlight shaking.

‚ÄúThere was a nest,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt was‚Äîlike, something had made it. It was here. It chased me¬†*from right here.*‚Äù

Tori walked beside me, scanning the floor with her light. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing. You sure it wasn‚Äôt another part of the attic?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm¬†*sure.*¬†I swear it‚Äî‚Äù

And then‚Äî

The attic breathed.

Or maybe it¬†*exhaled.*

A long, low sound, like something massive shifting in the rafters.

My flashlight flickered.

I turned fast. ‚ÄúDid you hear that?‚Äù

‚ÄúHear what?‚Äù Zack whispered.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know but maybe we need to leave,‚Äù Blake said. ‚ÄúRight now. No notes, no souvenirs‚Äîjust vibes and trauma, let‚Äôs¬†*go‚Äî*‚Äù

It moved.

A shape. A blur. Something behind the beams. It darted, fast and low, and¬†*no one else reacted.*

Only me.

‚Äú*It‚Äôs here‚Äî*‚Äù I yelled.

No one answered.

‚Äú*GUYS, IT‚ÄôS HERE‚Äî*‚Äù

The light flared, and then‚Äî

It lunged.

I didn‚Äôt see its face.

Just claws.

Long, black claws raked across the floor¬†as it tore forward. The shadows swallowed it and spat it back out like smoke. I saw it leap‚Äîtoo fast, too tall‚Äîand I shoved Zack sideways as it crashed through where he‚Äôd been standing.

‚ÄúWHAT ARE YOU DOING?!‚Äù he yelled.

I didn‚Äôt answer.

‚ÄúWE HAVE TO GO!‚Äù I screamed.

I ran.

Back toward the hatch.

Back toward the edge of the attic.

But the ladder wasn‚Äôt there anymore. Someone had pulled it up behind us.

And that‚Äôs when the thing roared‚Äîlow and wrong and wet.

It charged.

I turned to the only other way out: the¬†window.

A tiny square, just big enough to fit through.

‚ÄúTori!‚Äù I shouted. ‚ÄúThe window!‚Äù

I got there first, yanking it open with a grunt. Taylor was already behind me, kicking the crate under it into place.

We¬†climbed out one by one, onto the slanted roof just above the back porch.

The night air hit me like a punch. Cold. Wet. The stars overhead blurred by my tears and panic.

Blake slipped on the shingles and screamed. Taylor grabbed him.

Zack looked at me wildly, ‚Äúwhat are you doing!? Stop!‚Äù

Tori was last.

But as she turned to climb through‚Äî

The thing reached out.

A¬†clawed hand swiped out of the darkness, slashing toward her back. She twisted just in time, swinging the flashlight like a weapon and connecting with a sickening¬†*CRACK.*

‚ÄúGO!‚Äù she shouted.

But it grabbed her ankle.

She kicked. Screamed.

Zack reached for her.

The roof groaned.

She¬†*almost*¬†made it.

And then‚Äî

The shingle beneath her foot slipped.

And she fell.

I watched her tumble backward into the darkness below, her scream trailing off as her body disappeared from sight.

Then silence.

Just our breath. The hum of the night. The wind.

And the open window behind us.

Still breathing.

We stood on the roof for what felt like forever.

No one said anything.

The wind moved through the trees below. Porch lights from the neighbors cast long shadows on the lawn. And somewhere out there‚ÄîTori.

She wasn‚Äôt screaming anymore.

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù I said, scrambling toward the edge. ‚ÄúWe have to find her‚Äî‚Äù

Zack grabbed my good arm. ‚ÄúCareful.‚Äù

Blake looked like he might throw up. His flashlight was shaking so bad the beam was bouncing off the trees.

Taylor was already climbing down the drainpipe mumbling as she went, ‚Äúwhy did you do that?!‚Äù¬†

We followed.

By the time we reached the ground, we found her crumpled near the base of the hedges‚Äîface scratched, one shoe missing, her left leg bent wrong.

She was breathing.

Barely.

Her eyes fluttered open for a second. She saw me.

Then closed them again...

The ambulance came fast.

Too fast.

Blue lights lit up our front yard while neighbors peeked through their blinds. My parents ran outside barefoot. My mom screamed when she saw Tori on the stretcher.

The paramedics asked questions. Zack answered most of them. Taylor barely spoke. Blake cried once, then pretended he wasn‚Äôt.

No one asked me anything.

No one looked at me.

Later, inside, the four of us sat in the living room, scattered across the floor like broken puzzle pieces.

The popcorn bowl had spilled during the panic. One of the sleeping bags was still half-zipped. The¬†*Tremors*¬†DVD menu looped quietly on the TV screen.

I hugged my knees, cast pressed to my chest, and stared at the carpet.

‚ÄúI saw it,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúIt¬†*grabbed her.*¬†It pulled her back.‚Äù

No one said anything.

Taylor sat with her back to the couch, arms crossed, face hard. Her ponytail was messed up, and her sleeve had blood on it.

Zack didn‚Äôt even look at me.

‚ÄúShe wouldn‚Äôt have gone up there,‚Äù he said flatly, ‚Äúif it weren‚Äôt for you.‚Äù

That hit harder than I thought it would.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt make her go,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúShe¬†*wanted*¬†to. She said‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Taylor cut in, ‚Äúshe said ‚ÄòMollie was my dog too.‚Äô Because she felt¬†*bad*¬†for you.‚Äù

Blake sniffled from the recliner. ‚ÄúYou said we‚Äôd just look. You said it wasn‚Äôt going to¬†*do*¬†anything.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt¬†*know*¬†it would attack,‚Äù I snapped. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know it would‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all in your head, man,‚Äù Zack said. ‚ÄúThere was nothing there.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere¬†*was!*‚Äù I shouted, louder than I meant to. ‚ÄúI saw it. It chased us. It grabbed her ankle.‚Äù

Silence.

Taylor finally looked at me.

But not like she believed me.

Like she was looking at someone she¬†*used*¬†to know.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the only one who ever sees it,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs kinda weird, don‚Äôt you think?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt have an answer.

Taylor looked down to the floor, ‚Äúnothing grabbed her‚Ä¶we all saw what happened‚Ä¶you pushed her.‚Äù

I looked down at the carpet, suddenly aware of how loud my breathing was.

Outside, the ambulance was gone.

So was Tori.

The front door creaked open.

Mom stepped in first, her face pale like a ghost. Behind her came Dad, still in his pajamas, hair windblown, eyes heavy with something worse than anger.

The kind of look you give someone when you don‚Äôt recognize them anymore.

‚ÄúGet your stuff,‚Äù Mom said to the others.

No one said a word.

Taylor. Zack. Blake. They just moved. Silent. Tired. Like kids leaving a funeral.

I didn‚Äôt expect a goodbye, but it still hurt when I didn‚Äôt get one.

Mom ushered them out without looking back. Then the door closed.

Just me and Dad now.

The house groaned softly in the quiet. The movie menu still looped on the TV‚Äî‚ÄúPlay,‚Äù ‚ÄúScene Select,‚Äù ‚ÄúSpecial Features.‚Äù The last time anything felt normal.

Dad walked over to the couch and sat down slowly. He looked like he‚Äôd aged ten years in one night.

I didn‚Äôt move from the floor.

He rubbed his face with both hands, then looked at me.

‚ÄúI just got off the phone with the hospital,‚Äù he said, voice raw. ‚ÄúTori‚Äôs stable. Banged up bad. But she‚Äôs gonna be okay.‚Äù

I let out a breath I didn‚Äôt know I‚Äôd been holding.

He nodded to himself. Then leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees.

There was a long silence.

Then he said, ‚ÄúYour friends‚Ä¶ they told us what happened.‚Äù

I looked away.

‚ÄúThey said it was your idea. That you made them go up there. That you were the only one who saw anything.‚Äù

I said nothing.

‚ÄúBut I believe you think it‚Äôs real,‚Äù he added, softly. ‚ÄúI do.‚Äù

My throat burned.

‚ÄúIt¬†*is*¬†real,‚Äù I whispered.

He didn‚Äôt answer.

Instead, he let out a shaky breath and said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something I haven‚Äôt told you.‚Äù

That made me look up.

He wasn‚Äôt meeting my eyes. Just staring at the floor.

‚ÄúThe night Mollie died‚Ä¶‚Äù he started, voice slow, like the words were too heavy to push out. ‚ÄúI told your mom I found her in the attic. I told you she must‚Äôve gotten into poison.‚Äù

I nodded. ‚ÄúYou said she was already gone.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe was. But it wasn‚Äôt poison.‚Äù

He finally looked at me.

‚ÄúWhen I found you up there‚Ä¶ there wasn‚Äôt any rat bait. No spilled box. No teeth marks.‚Äù

He swallowed hard.

‚ÄúThere was just a¬†hammer. Covered in blood.¬†And your hands‚Äîyour shirt‚Äî*you*¬†were covered too.‚Äù

I froze.

A strange ringing filled my ears.

‚ÄúI thought‚Ä¶ maybe she‚Äôd already been hurt. Maybe you‚Äôd found her like that and tried to help. Maybe you grabbed the hammer because you were scared. I¬†*wanted*¬†to believe that. You had tried to soak up her blood with your blanket but‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúDad‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúBut now‚Äîafter Tori, after the attic, after tonight‚Ä¶‚Äù He trailed off.

I stared at him, my pulse thudding like thunder in my ears.

‚ÄúI think we need to go back,‚Äù he said quietly. ‚ÄúBack to the neurologist. Back to Dr. Kim.‚Äù

I shook my head.

‚ÄúYou remember what she said when you were five,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúAfter the surgery. About the scar tissue? That if anything changed, if the headaches came back, if you started‚Ä¶ seeing things‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm¬†*not*¬†seeing things,‚Äù I snapped.

He didn‚Äôt argue.

He just said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think this is your fault. But I think something‚Äôs wrong. Something we can‚Äôt see.‚Äù

I stood up, fists clenched.

‚ÄúYou think I hurt Mollie?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think something hurt you,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd I don‚Äôt know how to fix it.‚Äù

My chest felt tight.

My cast itched like fire.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt see it,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúYou never see it.‚Äù

He stood, slower than me. Careful.

‚ÄúI see¬†*you.*¬†And that‚Äôs enough to scare the hell out of me.‚Äù

¬†

Mom stayed at the hospital with Tori.

Dad made a bed on the couch, but I knew he wasn‚Äôt sleeping. I could hear him tossing. Getting up. Sitting back down. Every hour or so, he‚Äôd check on me through the crack in my bedroom door.

He didn‚Äôt trust me anymore.

And maybe he was right.

But I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it.

The creature. The attic. The way no one else had seen it. The hammer. The blood. The¬†*thing*¬†inside the wall breathing.

If it was in my head‚Ä¶ then why did everything feel so real?

Around 3AM, I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore.

I grabbed my¬†plastic lightsaber, flicked the red blade to life, and crouched beside the¬†wall in my room where I first heard the noise.¬†

The plaster felt cold under my fingers. Hollow.

I grabbed the old¬†metal bat¬†from under my bed.

And I started swinging.

CRACK.  
CRACK.

Drywall split apart. Chunks of insulation spilled onto the floor like guts. Dust filled the air like ash.

Behind it‚Äîwooden beams. And a gap.

Big enough to crawl through.

Inside the walls, it was tighter than I expected.

Spiderwebs clung to my face. The wood groaned around me. But I knew the house‚Äî*my house*. And I knew that if I went up just a little further, past the bathroom vent, past the pipes, past the beams‚Ä¶

I could get to the attic.

It was a short crawl.

But it felt like a mile.

The attic opened like a mouth.

The lightsaber buzzed softly, casting everything in a red haze.

And then I saw it.

The creature.

It stood taller than a man. Skin stretched too tight. Limbs long and crooked. Its mouth hung open‚Äînot for a scream, not a growl, just a sound like¬†breathing from the bottom of a well.

Its eyes locked on me.

It charged. I pulled back a marble in the slingshot and let it fly and it bounced off its skull.

I swung the lightsaber. Plastic cracked across its arm.

It didn‚Äôt flinch.

It lunged‚Äî snarling and snapping its teeth at me I tossed my arm forward

And it¬†bit down on my cast.

I screamed. Felt the pressure. The pain.

I slammed the saber against its skull over and over, backing toward the old boxes in the corner.

One toppled.

A can of paint thinner splattered onto the floor. The creature lifted me with one hand and chucked me against the far wall my arm getting tangled in wires in the corner. The weight of my body jerking them from their place and causing sparks to fly out into the air of the attic.

The flame caught the insulation like a match to dry leaves. The mix of the paint thinner and the sparks made it go up quick.

Whoosh.

Fire spread fast.

Too fast.

The attic filled with smoke.

Flames danced across the beams, chewing up memories. Christmas boxes. Old furniture. Toys.

The creature screamed.

A real one this time.

Animal and furious.

I scrambled for the window, climbing up onto the roof.

Smoke poured from the attic window behind me, thick and black, curling into the sky like a signal flare. The heat licked at my back as I scrambled onto the pitched roof, my cast thudding against the shingles.

The monster came through the fire.

It¬†burst out of the window¬†like a living shadow, its skin scorched and blistered, its claws dragging sparks across the wood. Parts of it still smoked. One shoulder was blackened. The side of its face looked like melted wax‚Äîbut it didn‚Äôt stop.

It moved like it couldn‚Äôt feel pain.

Like it had never been alive in the first place.

I turned and ran, slipping across the slanted rooftop, nails tearing at the shingles as I tried to crawl higher. The slope dipped fast near the edge, right above the driveway. One wrong step and I‚Äôd fall.

The creature lunged again.

I spun, swinging the¬†broken lightsaber hilt¬†like a club. It caught the monster‚Äôs jaw with a¬†*crack*, sending it staggering, but only for a second. It came back harder‚Äîclaws slashing.

One caught my side.

The fabric of my shirt ripped. I felt heat and pain, and then blood.

I screamed.

‚ÄúGET AWAY FROM ME!‚Äù

I shoved it. Hard. With everything I had.

We both slid.

Shingles ripped free beneath our weight. The roof groaned under us. A beam snapped with a deep¬†*POP*¬†from below.

I tried to dig my fingers into the edge. My cast scraped uselessly along the surface.

The creature grabbed my leg.

I kicked wildly, boots slamming into its burned face. Its grip loosened for just a second‚Äî

And that‚Äôs when the roof¬†gave way.

There was a deep, horrible¬†*cracking*¬†sound, and suddenly everything tilted.

The whole corner of the roof¬†collapsed in flames.

We fell together, tangled‚Äîme and the thing that wasn‚Äôt supposed to exist.

The air ripped past me.  
Heat roared up to meet us.  
Then‚Äî

Blackness‚Ä¶

¬†

The lights were soft. The air sterile. Machines beeped in slow, steady rhythms.

I opened my eyes.

White sheets.

An IV in my arm.

My wrist in a new cast.

And¬†Dad, sitting beside me, his arm bandaged in thick, burnt gauze.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre awake,‚Äù he said quietly.

My throat was dry. ‚ÄúTori?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs okay. Your mom‚Äôs still with her.‚Äù

I nodded.

‚ÄúHouse is gone nearly‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBurned up the attic and your room, the Fire chief says it started in the attic. Electrical wiring. That‚Äôs what they think.‚Äù

I looked away.

‚ÄúI pulled you out from under what was left of your room,‚Äù he continued. ‚Äúthe doctor‚Äôs said it was a miracle.‚Äù¬†

I didn‚Äôt answer. I looked at his arm that was bandaged, he must have been burnt in the fire trying to save me.

¬†A knock came at the door.

Dr. Kim¬†stepped in, holding a folder.

She smiled softly at me. ‚ÄúGood to see you, sweetheart. We ran a scan while you were under.‚Äù

She handed the folder to Dad.

He opened it.

Stared for a long time.

Then he turned it toward me.

An MRI.

Black and white. Fuzzy.

But clear enough.

Something round, pressing into part of my brain.

Like a shadow blooming behind my eyes.

Dad‚Äôs voice cracked.

Even with the windows cracked and the door rolled halfway open, the air clung to me‚Äîsawdust, WD-40, old sweat and rusted metal. The kind of smell that sinks into your skin. I stood there for a while just breathing it in, like it might fill the hole in my chest.

He was gone.

Three weeks ago, the cancer finally won.

It wasn‚Äôt sudden. We‚Äôd known for months‚Äîmaybe longer, if I‚Äôm honest with myself.¬†

But even when the chemo started thinning his hair and turning his skin that gray-yellow color, Dad never wanted to talk about it.  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a bump in the road,‚Äù he‚Äôd said.  
He meant it.

He still worked in here up until the last two months, dragging himself out of bed with a thermos full of black coffee and a stubborn glint in his eye. I‚Äôd tell him to rest. He‚Äôd grunt something like, ‚ÄúNah, I‚Äôve still got a few good licks in me,‚Äù and then he‚Äôd go tinkering with something that didn‚Äôt need fixing just to prove he still could.

I used to sit on that upside-down milk crate and watch him work. We'd listen to the radio, WLIK on low, playing some twangy acoustic stuff that I hated as a kid and miss now like hell.

He didn't say much. Never did. But when I‚Äôd hand him a socket wrench without being asked, he‚Äôd nod like it meant something. Like maybe he was proud of me in his quiet way.

I think about that more now. All the things he said with gestures. The way he'd pat my back when he passed by. He wasn‚Äôt a perfect dad. Not by a long shot. He yelled when he got overwhelmed. Shut down when he didn‚Äôt know how to help. Hell, when I came out as gay, he just nodded and flicked the tv channel over to Will and Grace.¬†

He never really knew what to do with feelings‚Äîhis or mine.

But he showed up. Every time.

Even when I didn‚Äôt deserve it.

And now...  
Now I‚Äôm standing in the middle of his garage with my childhood in one hand and nothing but silence in the other.

¬†I‚Äôd come home to clean the place out‚Äîafter the funeral, after the casseroles, after the endless parade of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry‚Äù from people who didn‚Äôt know him, not really.¬†

I knew Mom and¬†Tori couldn‚Äôt deal with it.¬†

I was going through his old toolbox when I found it: my¬†*Space Jam*¬†blanket, folded neatly in the bottom of a milk crate, sun-faded and worn thin at the corners the blood stains soaked into the fabric and turned slightly brown with age. It was tucked beneath a tangle of orange extension cords and a cracked Thermos. I don‚Äôt know why he kept it. Maybe he forgot it was even there.

But the second I saw it... I swear I felt twelve again  
and then that whole week came back‚Ä¶¬†

The one we never told anyone about.The one I thought I‚Äôd imagined until now.

***2003***

*MONDAY*

Monday morning, I woke up to the sound of birds tapping on the gutters and the muffled slam of a screen door somewhere down the street. April sun was slipping in through the blinds in soft golden stripes. I reached for the alarm clock, blinking at the numbers.

7:04AM.

School started in exactly twenty-six minutes.¬†

I rolled back over and coughed‚Äîdry, flat, fake.¬†

But I‚Äôd been rehearsing all weekend. Practicing in the mirror, rasping like I had strep, even holding the thermometer to the light bulb for a second too long before chickening out and shaking it back down.

I wasn‚Äôt sick.  
Not in the way my dad would understand.

I just... couldn‚Äôt go back.  
Not to the jokes.  
Not to Luke Bennett and his sharp elbows and sharper laugh.  
Not after what he whispered in gym class last Friday in front of everyone.

The door cracked open, and Mom peeked her head in. Her face lit up when she saw I was awake.  
‚ÄúHey, sweetie.‚Äù  
Her voice was soft and singsongy, like she used when I was sick for real. ‚ÄúYou feel any better this morning?‚Äù

I shook my head dramatically and gave a weak little sniff. ‚ÄúNot really‚Ä¶‚Äù

She crossed the room and sat on the edge of the bed, brushing my bangs off my forehead. Her fingers were cool and gentle. I remember she was still in her bathrobe, the pink one with little blue flowers.

‚ÄúYou feel warm,‚Äù she said, though I was pretty sure I didn‚Äôt.

I didn‚Äôt say anything. I just gave her the most pitiful look I could manage.

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she smiled, smoothing the blanket. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go talk to your dad, let him know you‚Äôre still sick and see what he says.‚Äù

She kissed my forehead and stood up, but before she reached the door, my older sister‚Äôs voice floated in‚Äîsarcastic and smug.

‚ÄúFake,‚Äù she said, peeking her head around the corner with a smirk. She was already dressed for school, backpack over one shoulder, highlighted hair pulled into a sloppy ponytail.

‚ÄúShut up, Tori,‚Äù I muttered, keeping my voice low so Mom wouldn‚Äôt hear.

‚ÄúYou better hope you‚Äôre actually faking it. Because if I catch the plague from you, I‚Äôll kill you myself.‚Äù

I flipped her off.

She raised her eyebrows like she was gonna rat me out‚Äîbut she didn‚Äôt. She just snorted and walked off, calling over her shoulder, ‚ÄúEnjoy your sick day, loser.‚Äù

Mom didn‚Äôt notice. Or pretended not to. She just shook her head,¬†

‚ÄúLeave your brother alone, Victoria.‚Äù¬†

Mom walked away muttering something about the two of us being impossible and padded down the hall toward the kitchen.

After a few minutes I heard Dad's boots thud down the hall before he knocked twice on my door‚Äîhe always knocked, even if he was already turning the handle.

My head wasn‚Äôt hot. My throat wasn‚Äôt sore. But I still pulled the covers up to my chin and added a few dry coughs for effect.¬†

I‚Äôd practiced them the night before.

¬†‚ÄúHey, you good buddy?‚Äù

I coughed again, this time with a little throat rasp. ‚ÄúI still don‚Äôt feel good.‚Äù

He stepped in. His dark work shirt was already tucked into his jeans, sleeves rolled up, the familiar¬†‚Äú*Dale‚Äù*¬†patch stitched over his chest.¬†

His hair was still wet from his shower, and he smelled like Irish Spring.

He crossed the room in two strides and laid a calloused hand on my forehead. His fingers smelled like engine oil

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt feel like a fever,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre pale.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say anything. Just looked up at him from the nest of blankets. The morning sun hit the side of his face, and for a second, I thought he looked tired. Not the kind of tired a nap would fix. The kind that just builds and builds until it lives in your bones.

He didn't press it. He never did when it came to me being sick. I think after my surgery, he started to believe I was made of glass.¬†

When I was 5 years old, I had a brain tumor, it was removed though and I was fine, but it scared the hell out of him and mom.¬†¬†

‚ÄúJust rest, okay?‚Äù he said, already halfway out the door. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna work in the garage most of the day. You need anything, come get me.‚Äù¬†

He turned back toward the door, then paused. ‚ÄúYou want anything? Waffles? Cereal?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe toast.‚Äù

‚ÄúComing right up.‚Äù

He left without another word, humming something low and tuneless. I waited until I heard the faint clink of a toaster lever and the sound of the garage door creaking open before I climbed out of bed.

I spent the first couple hours exactly how I imagined: sprawled on the carpet, watching¬†*The Amanda Show*¬†on my old Zenith box TV, sipping Capri Sun through a chewed-up straw. My feet were cold. I didn‚Äôt mind.

The house felt... calm. Like it exhaled once the world left for work and school. I knew every sound it made. The way the fridge clicked when it kicked on. The creak of the hallway when you stepped just right. The faint¬†*clunk*¬†of the dryer vent in the wind.

But around 11AM, something was off.

I was halfway through a bowl of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, flipping through an old¬†*Nintendo Power*, when I heard a thump.

Not from outside. Not from the garage.

From the hallway.

Just one. A soft thud, like a dropped shoe or someone stumbling. Then nothing.

I muted the TV and listened.

Silence.

I tried to laugh it off, but something in my chest pulled tight. The air suddenly felt heavy, like when a storm's about to roll in.

I crept to the hallway and peeked down it. Every door was shut... except the closet. The one by the bathroom. Its door stood cracked open just an inch‚Äîjust enough to show darkness inside.

I hadn‚Äôt opened it. I was sure of it.

I stood there for a long time, heart punching the inside of my ribs. Then I grabbed the broom from the laundry room and‚Äîlike an idiot‚Äîpoked it shut from a distance.

*Click.*

I exhaled.

Later that afternoon, I asked Dad if he‚Äôd opened it earlier. He looked up from the engine he was working on, grease on his fingers and forehead.

‚ÄúWhat closet?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe hallway one. By the bathroom.‚Äù

He shook his head, wiping sweat off his brow with the back of his arm. ‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt been inside the house all day.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt say anything else. I think he chalked it up to imagination. Or nerves. Or both.

That night, I couldn‚Äôt sleep.

The ceiling fan rattled gently overhead, and the streetlamp outside my window painted familiar shadows on the wall. I pulled the blanket up to my chin and counted the blinking red numbers on my clock.

2:13AM.

I was just starting to drift off when I heard it.

A low hum. Not a sound I recognized. Not the fridge. Not the fan. Not the vent. It was inside the wall. Soft and vibrating, like a voice pressed through insulation.

Then... something moved across the ceiling.

Not a shadow.  
Not a trick of light.

Something that didn‚Äôt belong. Something crawling, but too smooth. Too slow. It passed just above me like a ripple in the plaster, just long enough for my breath to catch in my throat.

I didn‚Äôt scream. I didn‚Äôt move. I just laid there, every part of me rigid, listening to the silence that followed.

I didn‚Äôt know it then‚Äîbut that was only the beginning.

NOW

I shuttered the memory away and pulled out my phone to write this just so I didn't forget.

I tucked the blanket into my jeep and decided to drive home for the night. I have to come back to do more work in the garage and it's already so late...",1,1754730840.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1mlkylu,https://i.redd.it/z37pexmulyhf1.png,Poketto: Apple Card-inspired native finance tracker. In-app purchase free for a limited time.,"# Background

Like a lot of you, I've always loved Apple Card's clean UI and wished I could track all my finances with that same intuitive interface. The problem? Life doesn't happen exclusively on Apple Card ‚Äì we've got other cards with better rewards, Venmo transfers, cash transactions, you name it.

So I built Poketto, an iOS app that brings that Apple Card aesthetic to all your financial tracking. This started as a side project that my friends and I have been using for the past two years, and I finally decided to polish it up and release it on the App Store.

# Features

* It's 100% native iOS¬†
* Built from the ground up for iPhone using SwiftUI and Core Data with all the smooth animations and gestures you'd expect. And of course it supports iCloud syncing across multiple devices.¬†
* Your data stays yours¬†
   * Everything is stored locally on your device or in your personal iCloud account. No third-party servers involved without your explicit permission (for example, sending your receipt photo to OpenAI to turn them into transactions.)¬†
* Very simple to use¬†
   * Think of it like virtual bank accounts. Log expenses (withdrawals) and income (deposits). No overcomplicated jargons to understand.¬†¬†
* Multi-currency support¬†
   * Exchange rates update hourly, so you can track transactions in different currencies and see everything in your preferred currency. You can even group transactions across multiple currencies into one ‚Äúcompound transaction.‚Äù¬†
* AI Transaction Logging¬†
   * After adding your OpenAI API key, you can log transactions by snapping receipt photos or describing purchases in natural language, such as ""coffee at Starbucks $4.50.‚Äù Even more AI features and LLM provider support are in the works, including Apple‚Äôs on-device foundation models arriving with iOS 26.¬†

# Pricing

Poketto is free to use, but requires Poketto Pass to unlock all features. You can get Poketto Pass through either a one-time purchase of $19.99 **(free for a limited time until Aug 17)**, or subscription for $0.99/month or $9.99/year.

[**Download on the App Store**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/poketto-money-tracker/id6463721292)¬†



I hope you find Poketto useful! I am both the developer AND a heavy user of this app. That means I'm constantly finding ways to make it better based on real daily usage, not just theoretical features. Feel free to email me with any feedback/ideas at¬†[hello@pokettoapp.com](mailto:hello@pokettoapp.com), or join our [Telegram group](https://t.me/+iZgdcnkYdVE3ZTU1). ;)

I could tell just by looking at her that she really didn‚Äôt want to ask for help, and she was having a hard time getting her words out. 

I said ‚Äútake a breath babe, what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù. She looked absolutely defeated and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gonna lie.. I was just released from jail and I need a ride‚Äù. She had all her stuff in a flimsy jail trash bag, which I easily recognized as I‚Äôve been in jail before myself. 

I‚Äôm always happy to help if someone needs a cigarette or food or even a few bucks, but I never give rides. Then I remembered how lucky I was to have my family waiting for me when I got out of jail. Something told me to help her. I asked her where she needed to go and it was on my way home, so I told her to hop in. Again, I never give rides to strangers, but there was just something about her. 

It was like a 20 minute ride and we chatted the whole time about politics, faith, addiction, parenthood, mental illness, I mean everything! There wasn‚Äôt a single moment where I felt anything negative or shady. We truly connected! 

I‚Äôm a stout believer in treating people the way you would want someone to treat your loved ones, and I‚Äôm so glad that I did. I gave her my phone number and asked her to stay in touch.

*Where pitching outclasses poetry, and the Mariners are one win away from being the Astros‚Äô evil twin.*

---

### Parse the Odds: A Math Class You‚Äôll Actually Enjoy

Let‚Äôs start with the numbers because, frankly, they‚Äôre more reliable than your ex‚Äôs excuses.

* **Drew Rasmussen (Rays)** is a human ice sculpture against the Mariners: 2-0 with a 0.61 ERA in four appearances. That‚Äôs not just good‚Äîit‚Äôs *glacial*. Seattle‚Äôs .244 batting average against righties (22nd in MLB) is like a toddler trying to solve a Rubik‚Äôs Cube: persistent, but not impressive.
* **Luis Castillo (Mariners)** has a 3.30 ERA in five career games vs. Tampa, which is decent but still sounds like what happens when you let a barista brew your own coffee.
* The Mariners are 6-1 since the trade deadline, while the Rays are clinging to wild-card hope like a sunburned tourist holding a parasol.

**Odds Breakdown**:

* **Moneyline**: Seattle (-125 to -140) is the favorite, implying a **57-59% chance to win**. Tampa (+115 to +130) has **41-43% implied odds**.
* **Spread**: Seattle -1.5 (odds: +250 to +270) and Tampa +1.5 (-410 to -440). The Mariners need to win by *two runs* to cover, which feels like asking a vegan to eat a salad and still pretend they‚Äôre hungry.
* **Totals**: Both books have the Over/Under at **8 runs**, with **Under** as the slight favorite (1.87-1.95 odds). That‚Äôs **52-54% implied probability** for Under.

---

### Digest the News: Castillo‚Äôs Short Start, Rasmussen‚Äôs Longer Resume

Recent updates? Let‚Äôs call it a ‚Äúmixed metaphor‚Äù of mediocrity and excellence.

* **Castillo‚Äôs** last start against Texas was shorter than a TikTok tutorial on how to tie your shoes. He lasted just 3 innings, which is about as long as a Mariners fan‚Äôs patience during a Rays‚Äô rally.
* **Rasmussen** was perfect against the Dodgers, throwing a scoreless inning that was less a pitch and more a *performance art* piece.
* The Mariners‚Äô recent 6-1 stretch? They‚Äôve turned into the NBA‚Äôs **‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna need a bigger boat‚Äù** team, sailing toward the AL West title.

That night, I was in bed when I heard her again‚Äîsoft footsteps in the hallway, the shuffle of her nightgown. At first, I thought it was another one of her wandering spells. But when I peeked out the door, she was just standing there in the dark, head tilted back, eyes wide open like she was looking at something on the ceiling.

Her lips were moving, but no sound came out.

‚ÄúGrandma?‚Äù I whispered.

She turned her head toward me in one sharp motion. Her pupils were so dilated that her eyes looked black. When she spoke, it wasn‚Äôt in her voice‚Äîit was low, guttural, like someone was speaking through her.

‚ÄúBlood of the firstborn‚Ä¶ blood of the last.‚Äù

Before I could ask what that meant, Rick‚Äôs voice barked from downstairs, ‚ÄúDalton! Leave her be!‚Äù

I stepped back into my room, but when I closed the door, something in me snapped. Maybe it was the fear, or maybe I was just tired of feeling like no one would tell me the truth. I stormed down the stairs.

Rick was in the kitchen, leaning over the counter with a glass of whiskey.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with her?‚Äù I demanded.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs fine,‚Äù he said without looking up.

‚ÄúNo, she‚Äôs not. She‚Äôs‚Äîshe‚Äôs talking like she‚Äôs possessed, she‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs fine.‚Äù Louder now.

‚ÄúBullshit! You‚Äôve been lying to me since the day I got here!‚Äù

That got his attention. He slammed the glass down so hard it cracked at the base.

‚ÄúWatch your mouth, boy.‚Äù

‚ÄúOr what?‚Äù

For a second, I thought he was going to hit me. Instead, he grabbed the whiskey bottle and smashed it against the edge of the counter, glass spraying across the floor.

Daniel rushed in, shouting, ‚ÄúHey! Enough!‚Äù

But I was already backing away, heart pounding, the heat in my face turning to something like panic. I turned and bolted for the door.

The barn smelled of hay and sweat and something sharp, like iron. The horses were restless, shifting in their stalls, ears flicking at noises I couldn‚Äôt hear.

Tess was pawing at the ground, nostrils flaring.

Without thinking, I grabbed her reins and led her out into the cool night air.

‚ÄúCome on, girl,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get the hell out of here.‚Äù

The moon hung low and swollen in the sky, its pale light making the trees look silver and unreal. I swung onto Tess‚Äôs back and kicked gently, guiding her toward the trail at the back of the pasture. I sent a text message to Caleb asking if he wanted to hangout. Then one to Leah.¬†

We were half a mile out when I heard the rustle in the brush.

Tess froze. Her whole body went rigid beneath me.

Then the mountain lion leapt.

I barely had time to throw my arm up before it hit us, a blur of fur and claws and teeth. Tess reared, screaming, and I was thrown hard into the dirt. My head cracked against something solid, and the world went black.

I woke to the smell of blood.

It was everywhere‚Äîon my hands, my arms, smeared across my chest. My breathing came fast and shallow, and my vision swam before it focused on the shape in front of me.

The mountain lion was dead.

Its throat was torn open, the ground beneath it soaked dark.

Tess was gone.

And my hands‚Ä¶ my¬†*fingernails*‚Ä¶ were thick with something under them.

Footsteps crunched through the leaves, and I turned to see Rick and Daniel approaching, flashlights cutting through the dark. Tess was with them, reins in Daniel‚Äôs hand, her eyes still rolling white from fear.

‚ÄúJesus Christ,‚Äù Daniel muttered when he saw the cat.

Rick‚Äôs eyes went straight to me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs starting.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs starting?‚Äù I asked, my voice shaking.

‚ÄúWe need to get back to the house,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNow.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going anywhere until you tell me‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand,‚Äù Daniel said, his voice tight. ‚ÄúThe moon‚Äôs almost full. If we don‚Äôt get home before it crests‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúBefore¬†*what*?‚Äù

Rick stepped closer. His face was pale. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been having blackouts. Waking up in places you shouldn‚Äôt be. It‚Äôs not sleepwalking. It‚Äôs the curse.‚Äù

I laughed once, short and sharp, because it was all I could do. ‚ÄúThe¬†*what*?‚Äù

‚ÄúOur family‚Äôs bloodline,‚Äù Rick said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs tainted. Generations back, one of our own crossed the wrong thing‚Äîsomething that wasn‚Äôt meant to be human‚Äîand it marked us. We‚Äôre lycanthropes, Dalton‚Ä¶

¬†‚ÄúFucking Werewolves.‚Äù

My mouth went dry.

Daniel glanced at the moon over the trees. ‚ÄúWe have to get Grandma to the cave. Now.‚Äù

We got back to the house just as Caleb‚Äôs pickup pulled in. He hopped out, concern etched across his face. ‚ÄúYou texted me‚Äîwhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù

Before I could answer, headlights swung across the yard. Leah.

‚ÄúYou okay? I saw your text‚Äî‚Äù

Her words died when Grandma stepped onto the porch.

She wasn‚Äôt humming.

She was staring at the moon.

Her lips peeled back in a slow, animal snarl.

Rick was already moving toward her. ‚ÄúDaniel‚Äîchains. Now.‚Äù

Daniel sprinted for the barn.

‚ÄúWhat the hell is happening?‚Äù Caleb demanded.

‚ÄúGo inside,‚Äù Rick barked.

Then it began.

The sound of bones popping. Skin stretching. Low, guttural growls that made the hair on my arms stand on end.

Grandma‚Äôs body twisted, her hands curling into claws, her face elongating, teeth sharpening into something that could tear through bone.

Rick followed. His shirt ripped down the back, muscles bulging in ways that didn‚Äôt look human, his jaw snapping forward as his eyes bled into gold.

And then it was my turn.

Pain ripped through me, white-hot, blinding. My spine arched. My fingernails split and lengthened into black, curved points. My teeth cut into my own tongue. I tried to scream, but what came out was a howl.

‚ÄúInside!‚Äù Daniel shouted, dragging Caleb and Leah toward the feed room in the barn.

The last thing I saw before the change took me completely was their faces‚Äîwhite with terror‚Äîas Rick lunged for the door.

They made it to the feed room just in time.

The lock rattled as something slammed into the door‚Äîonce, twice, again. A low, rumbling growl rolled through the wood. Caleb was gripping a pitchfork like it was the only thing keeping him alive. Leah was white-knuckled around a hunting knife Daniel had pressed into her hand.

Outside, claws scraped the walls. Hooves clattered in panic as the horses in the stalls kicked and screamed.

Then, silence.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt trust the silence,‚Äù Daniel whispered.

It didn‚Äôt last long.

A shadow moved past the small window. Golden eyes caught the light. A snout pressed to the glass, fogging it with hot breath.

The night became a blur of noise‚Äîgrowls, snapping jaws, wood splintering under inhuman strength. Every second felt like it might be the one that broke the door.

And then, slowly, as the black sky turned gray‚Ä¶ the sounds faded.

When Daniel finally opened the door, the yard was littered with torn clothing, blood, and the faint, sharp smell of iron.

Rick was sitting on the porch steps, human again, head in his hands.

Grandma was gone. Later found walking the streets of town completely nude and covered in scratches.¬†

And I‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt look at my own hands without seeing claws.

In the days after the full moon, things went back to something that looked like normal‚Äîat least on the surface.¬†

Rick didn‚Äôt talk about what happened in the barn, and neither did I. Grandma had been moved to the smaller bedroom upstairs, where Daniel could keep a closer eye on her. And me? I found myself spending as much time as possible with Caleb and Leah.

We didn‚Äôt talk about the claws, or the chains, or the thing I‚Äôd become that night. We just‚Ä¶ lived. Fishing trips. Milkshakes at the diner. Sitting in the grass behind the barn, watching the sun set over the mountains.

But the summer was ending, and so was my time here.

The morning, I was supposed to leave, Caleb and Leah came by to see me off. Caleb handed me a battered baseball cap. ‚ÄúFor when you come back,‚Äù he said.

Leah didn‚Äôt say anything at first. She just hugged me‚Äîtight, like she wasn‚Äôt sure she‚Äôd see me again. When she pulled back, her smile didn‚Äôt quite reach her eyes. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget about us,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúNot possible,‚Äù I told her.

Rick and Daniel drove me to the airport. The ride was quiet, the hum of the tires and the occasional cough from the AC the only sounds between us.

At the gate, Rick shook my hand. ‚ÄúYou did good, kid,‚Äù he said.

I wasn‚Äôt sure if he meant the summer, or the moon, or just surviving.

Daniel gave me a hug. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got people here. Don‚Äôt forget that.‚Äù

I boarded the plane with my carry-on and didn‚Äôt look back until we were in the air, the mountains shrinking into jagged shadows below.

Mom was waiting at the gate when I landed. She hugged me so tight I almost couldn‚Äôt breathe, and for the first time in months, I didn‚Äôt pull away.

At home, we sat in the kitchen with mugs of coffee‚Äîmine more cream than coffee‚Äîand I told her about the summer. Not everything, but enough.

When I finished, she was quiet for a long time. Then she said, ‚ÄúThe curse skipped me.‚Äù

I blinked. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know your uncle and I have different dads. Rick‚Äôs father was‚Ä¶ well, he‚Äôs the one it started with. Passed it to Rick. The gene‚Äôs still in me somehow, but it‚Äôs dormant. I can‚Äôt change.‚Äù

My stomach tightened. ‚ÄúSo you knew.‚Äù

She nodded slowly. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think it would ever touch you. But after what happened at school‚Ä¶ when you lost control like that‚Ä¶ I thought maybe it was active. And I didn‚Äôt know how to handle it.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you sent me to Rick,‚Äù I said, my voice flat.

‚ÄúI sent you to someone who could teach you what I couldn‚Äôt,‚Äù she said. Her eyes were wet, but she held my gaze. ‚ÄúI thought he could help you understand it before it destroyed you.‚Äù

I looked down at my hands, flexing my fingers like I was expecting to see claws.

‚ÄúCan it be stopped?‚Äù I asked.

She didn‚Äôt answer right away. ‚ÄúMaybe. But not by pretending it isn‚Äôt there.‚Äù

You know, they say family is everything‚Äîour roots, our home. But sometimes, those roots grow tangled in shadows we didn‚Äôt ask for. Trauma isn‚Äôt just pain; it‚Äôs a legacy. It‚Äôs a ghost whispered from one generation to the next, a silent burden stitched into the blood we carry. We inherit scars like heirlooms, handed down in silence

Family‚Äôs supposed to be where you find safety. But sometimes, it‚Äôs the place where the darkest curses get handed down‚Äîlike this damn werewolf blood running through my veins; it‚Äôs a beast howling inside me, passed down like a twisted legacy no one asked for.

But maybe it‚Äôs not about fighting the curse‚Ä¶ maybe it‚Äôs about owning it. Because if you‚Äôre gonna be a monster,

then make damn sure it‚Äôs on your terms‚Ä¶",1,1754730183.0,spoopycjades,0,1.0,False

Part 2","By the time sunlight crept through my bedroom window, the house already smelled like coffee and fried eggs. Somewhere downstairs, a screen door slapped shut, and a dog barked once, far off in the fields.

I hadn‚Äôt slept. Not really.

Maybe an hour here and there, but most of the night I‚Äôd just stared at the ceiling, playing everything over and over in my head‚ÄîGrandma running like a wind-up doll, the look in her eyes, and those¬†*other*¬†eyes outside the kitchen window.

I didn‚Äôt want to believe I‚Äôd seen them.

But I had.

I pulled on a T-shirt, ran a hand through my hair, and made my way downstairs. Daniel was in the kitchen, flipping pancakes, a towel slung over his shoulder. He gave me a smile that felt automatic.

‚ÄúMornin‚Äô. You hungry?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, sure,‚Äù I said, sitting at the table. My voice came out thin.

‚ÄúRick‚Äôs already outside,‚Äù Daniel added. ‚ÄúStorm last night knocked out part of the fence again. Or maybe a buck rammed through. Hard to tell.‚Äù

I hesitated. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think there¬†*was*¬†a storm.‚Äù

Daniel shrugged. ‚ÄúOne of those dry ones, I guess. Wind, no rain.‚Äù

I stared at him. He didn‚Äôt blink.

After a minute, he slid a plate in front of me‚Äîthree pancakes, golden and steaming, a little pad of butter melting in the middle. It should‚Äôve smelled good. Should‚Äôve tasted like home. But I had no appetite.

‚ÄúDid you‚Ä¶ hear anything last night?‚Äù I asked carefully.

He poured himself coffee and took a seat across from me. ‚ÄúYou mean Grandma?‚Äù

I nodded, but my eyes stayed on my plate. ‚ÄúAnd‚Ä¶ anything else?‚Äù

Daniel sipped his coffee. ‚ÄúOld houses make weird sounds.‚Äù

‚ÄúI saw something,‚Äù I said, a little more firmly. ‚ÄúOutside the window. Eyes. Too high off the ground to be a coyote or anything like that.‚Äù

He set his cup down with a clink. ‚ÄúYou were tired, Dalton. Jet-lagged, overheated, stressed. First night in a strange place‚Äîour brains like to fill in the blanks.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt imagining it.‚Äù

Daniel opened his mouth like he was about to say more, but at that moment, the back door swung open and Rick stepped in, covered in dust and grass seeds, boots muddy and sleeves rolled up.

‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù he said, grabbing a water bottle from the fridge. ‚ÄúDaniel, the whole east section is leaning. We‚Äôll need to restring it before it collapses.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm on it.‚Äù

Rick turned to me. ‚ÄúEat up, Dalton. You‚Äôre coming too. We‚Äôve got posts to dig.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait,‚Äù I said, standing. ‚ÄúCan we talk first? About last night?‚Äù

Rick glanced at Daniel, then back at me. ‚ÄúSure. But it‚Äôll have to wait. Fence isn‚Äôt going to fix itself.‚Äù

‚ÄúI saw something out there.‚Äù

He gave a half-smile that didn‚Äôt reach his eyes. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll see all kinds of things out here. Coyotes. Deer. Raccoons trying to sneak in through the crawlspace. Last month Daniel swore he saw a chupacabra.‚Äù

Daniel rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúIt was a mangy fox.‚Äù

‚ÄúStill gave me a heart attack,‚Äù Rick muttered, then tossed a pair of work gloves onto the table in front of me. ‚ÄúFinish your pancakes. Then boots on.‚Äù

Just like that, the conversation was over.

They didn‚Äôt believe me.

Or worse‚Ä¶ they¬†*did.*

And they didn‚Äôt want me to know the truth.

By noon, the sun had clawed its way above the trees, spilling heat down on everything like it had a grudge.

We rode out to the edge of the property in Rick‚Äôs truck‚Äîme in the middle, Daniel riding shotgun, both of them sipping lukewarm coffee from thermoses that smelled faintly of bourbon. The cab was quiet except for the rattling of tools in the bed and the occasional squawk of country radio fuzzing through the static.

The fence line sat near the edge of the woods, where the fields turned wild and the trees leaned in close, like they were eavesdropping.

As soon as we parked, I felt it.

That same pressure behind my eyes, that prickle at the back of my neck. Like I was being watched.

‚ÄúGrab the wire,‚Äù Rick said, hopping out.

Daniel was already walking the line, boots crunching in the dry grass, muttering about loose posts and snapped nails. I followed, carrying a spool of wire and a hammer, trying not to look at the forest‚Äîeven though every part of me wanted to.

It was too quiet.

No birds. No wind.

Even the bugs seemed to be holding their breath.

We worked in silence for a while. I held the posts while Rick hammered, the metal ringing loud in the stillness. Daniel worked farther down, tying off the last strand with thick gloves.

‚ÄúGrab me another nail, would ya?‚Äù Rick asked, wiping sweat from his brow.

I turned toward the toolbox‚Äî

**Snap.**

The sound came from the woods. Sharp. Like a branch breaking under something¬†*heavy*.

I froze. Rick did too.

‚ÄúProbably just a deer,‚Äù Daniel called over. But his voice had gone flat.

All three of us turned toward the tree line.

Another sound followed. A slow rustling. Then a heavy thud.

A footstep.

Then another.

Something was¬†*moving*¬†in there. Slow. Deliberate.

Then we saw it.

Just for a moment.

Something stepped between the trees, half-shadowed by the undergrowth. Too tall. Too narrow. Limbs too long. Its shape didn‚Äôt make sense‚Äîlike someone had taken the rough outline of a dog and¬†*twisted it*, stretched it wrong. Its head hung low, and it moved like its joints didn‚Äôt belong to it.

It was watching us.

Rick raised his rifle without a word and fired.

The crack of the shot split the air like a whip.

The thing¬†*jerked*¬†back, unnaturally fast, disappearing into the woods with a motion that was all wrong‚Äîlike a puppet getting yanked offstage.

Rick fired again, but the trees swallowed it whole.

‚ÄúBack in the truck,‚Äù Daniel said sharply, already moving.

We didn‚Äôt argue.

We threw the tools into the bed and climbed in. Rick turned the key with shaking fingers, and the engine sputtered before roaring to life. The tires spat up dirt as we peeled away from the trees.

No one spoke.

No one¬†*had to*.

But as we sped down the long gravel road back toward the house, my skin crawled.

The windows were rolled down, and the hot wind roared in my ears.

And then I heard it.

A voice.

Low.

Whispering.

From the woods.

**‚ÄúDaaaalllltooonnn...‚Äù**

My blood turned to ice.

Not shouted. Not screamed.

*Called.*

Like someone knew me. Like someone wanted me to follow.

I twisted in my seat and stared out the back window.

Nothing.

Just trees.

Just shadows.

But something in those shadows¬†*knew*¬†me.

And it wanted me to know it was there.

By the time we got back to the house, the sun was starting to dip behind the trees, casting long shadows across the fields. No one talked about what we saw out there.

Not the shape.

Not the sound.

Not the voice that called my name.

Rick went straight to the barn, muttering something about checking the generator. Daniel headed to the cellar to grab canned peaches for dinner like it was just another Tuesday. I stood in the entryway, shoes muddy, shirt stuck to my back with sweat and nerves and heat, trying to pretend my heart wasn‚Äôt still racing.

I needed to get clean.

Upstairs, the bathroom was small and old. White tile with hairline cracks, a mirror with a rust-stained edge, and a clawfoot tub with a curtain that barely covered half the space. I peeled off my clothes and stepped in, wincing as the water came on cold and climbed slowly toward lukewarm.

The pressure was terrible.

The kind of shower where the water dribbled more than sprayed, but I didn‚Äôt care. I stood there with my hands braced on the tile and let it wash over me, watching the dirt and sweat swirl down the drain like it might take the fear with it.

For a while, the only sound was the hiss of water and the occasional groan of pipes.

I closed my eyes.

Tried to breathe.

Tried to forget the voice.

Tried not to picture the thing in the woods.

But then‚Äî

*creak.*

The floorboard outside the bathroom door.

I froze.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I called, voice low.

No answer.

I waited.

Nothing.

I shook my head. Probably the house settling. Everything here made noise. I turned off the water and pulled the curtain aside.

And nearly screamed.

Grandma was standing in the doorway.

Not fully inside the bathroom. Just standing there, her silhouette framed by the hallway light behind her. Her nightgown hung limp around her ankles. Her hair was a tangled cloud around her face, and her eyes‚Äî

They were locked on me.

Wide.

Empty.

Unblinking.

‚ÄúJesus‚ÄîGrandma,‚Äù I gasped, grabbing a towel and yanking it around my waist. My skin went cold.

She didn‚Äôt move.

Didn‚Äôt speak.

Just stared.

‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù I asked.

Still nothing.

Then, quietly‚Äîso softly I almost didn‚Äôt hear it‚Äîshe said:

**‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt be here.‚Äù**

My throat tightened. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

She blinked. Once. Slowly.

‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt like strangers,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúThey smell your skin. They know your blood.‚Äù

I backed up against the sink, clutching the towel tighter.

‚ÄúGrandma‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúThey always come for the loud ones first,‚Äù she said, and then her face changed‚Äîjust slightly. Her mouth twitched into a smile.

Like a child telling a secret they weren‚Äôt supposed to know.

Then Rick‚Äôs voice called from downstairs: ‚ÄúMa? Where‚Äôd you wander off to?‚Äù

Grandma turned without another word and disappeared down the hallway.

Like she hadn‚Äôt just stood there saying things that would keep me up for the next ten years.

I stayed frozen for a long time. Dripping. Trembling.

And when I finally moved, it was only to lock the bathroom door behind her...",1,1754730139.0,spoopycjades,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Mets vs. Brewers: A Same-Game Parlay for the Ages**  
*Where the Brewers Bring the Heat and the Mets Bring the Mystery*

The Milwaukee Brewers (70-44) stomp into Milwaukee like a team that‚Äôs already drafted their World Series parade float, while the New York Mets (63-52) stagger in, still reeling from a four-game losing streak that‚Äôs left them more ‚Äúmystery meat‚Äù than ‚Äúmeatloaf.‚Äù Let‚Äôs break this down with the precision of a radar gun and the humor of a ballpark hot-dog vendor who‚Äôs seen it all.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Numbers Don‚Äôt Lie (But They Might Roll Their Eyes at the Mets)

The Brewers are -147 favorites, which translates to a **60% implied win probability**. For context, that‚Äôs like saying the sun has a **60% chance of rising**‚Äîstill not as certain as your Uncle Joe‚Äôs claim that he ‚Äúinvented‚Äù nachos, but close. The Mets, at +123, offer a **44.6% chance**, which is about the same odds your local barista has of remembering your coffee order without you spelling your name 12 times.

Historically, the Brewers thrive as favorites, winning **67.2% of games** in that role this season. They‚Äôve got a **3.63 ERA** and a **1.240 WHIP**, which is baseball-speak for ‚Äúwe‚Äôll outpitch you before we outslug you.‚Äù The Mets? They hit 140 homers (10th in MLB) but have a **3.68 ERA** and a 39.4% win rate as underdogs. Translation: They‚Äôre a one-trick pony with a side of inconsistency.

The over/under is set at **9 runs**, with the over priced at 2.0 and the under at 1.82‚Äì1.83. Given both teams‚Äô offensive firepower (Christian Yelich‚Äôs 21 HRs vs. Juan Soto‚Äôs 26), this feels like a ‚Äúhot dog eating contest where both chefs forgot the salt.‚Äù High-scoring? Absolutely. Predictable? Only if you‚Äôve seen the script for *The Dark Knight*.

### News Digest: Injuries, Mysteries, and Why the Mets Need a GPS

The Brewers are as healthy as a vegan at a salad bar. Their starter, **Tobias Myers**, is a human torque wrench, and their lineup? A home-run machine with Yelich leading the charge.

The Mets? They‚Äôve got more questions than a rookie umpire in his first game. Their starting pitcher is still ‚ÄúTBD,‚Äù which is baseball‚Äôs way of saying, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre winging it.‚Äù Their offense? A rollercoaster of ‚Äú*we‚Äôll hit 26 HRs one game, then 0 the next*.‚Äù Recent losses have been soÊÉ® that even their bench coach is

Like, if you go barefoot onto the road, your feet will be burned! Hahaha, No, no, just exaggerating, though it was pretty hot. Anyways, enough about this. Me and my younger brother were on bicycles and our younger sister was trailing behind us on a scooter. We were just riding down streets aimlessly, trying to find something to occupy ourselves, when my younger brother, Jetson, noticed something.

‚ÄúHey guys, stop here for a moment.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I ask, my bike wheels skidding as I braked on the scorching road.

‚ÄúI hear something‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúCome on, let's keep riding, I don‚Äôt hear anything!‚Äù My sister whines.

‚ÄúYeah Jet, I can‚Äôt hear anything, let's go.‚Äù I say, agreeing with my sister, Paige.

‚ÄúNo! Listen!‚Äù Jet says, pointing to the bushes and trees off the road. I get off my bike and wheel it over to where Jetson is standing while my sister starts making annoying noises in her annoyance of being held up. I stop where Jetson is and listen hard. I hear it, the rushing of water, a river. The bushes and trees were probably hiding a river that we haven‚Äôt found yet, despite living in this neighborhood for most of our lives!¬†

‚ÄúYo! It might be a river! That‚Äôs awesome! A new discovery!‚Äù I say, excitedly because I was annoyed at the neighborhood because of the lack of new things to discover. My brother knows of my excitement in new discoveries as he is nodding, proud of himself.‚ÄúI can‚Äôt hear anything! And even if it is a river, so what?! Come on, let's go home, I'm hungry.‚Äù Paige 	whines. I turn around to face her.

‚ÄúGo home if you want! Me and Jetty will explore the river ourselves!‚Äù I snap at her, louder than I meant to.

‚ÄúStop being annoying.‚Äù Jetson says to Paige.

‚ÄúY-you're not going to come home with me?‚Äù Paige asks, a hint of tears in her eyes.

‚ÄúNo, you already know the way.‚Äù I respond, pushing the bike onto the grass off the road and kicking the stand down. I motion Jetson to follow and start walking towards the sound of the river as Paige takes off, crying.‚ÄùMaybe you shouldn‚Äôt have shouted at her.‚Äù Jetson says, matter-of-factly. I turn around to face him.

‚ÄúHave I told you about the times when me and ‚Äúmy‚Äù dad were living in Thailand? About how I had no genuine friends except for annoying idiots? Huh? I ask him angrily.¬†

‚ÄúWell if you can‚Äôt control your temper then you're no better than them.‚Äù Jetson responds. Damn, he‚Äôs good at that, giving rational responses. I opened my mouth to argue but I stopped, Jetson was right, and I was mad about it. We bushwhack in silence until we reach the clearing where the river was. It was‚Ä¶ Wrong‚Ä¶ The river seemed to be whispering as it flowed, an evil presence trying to communicate‚Ä¶ Giving warnings. It smelled‚Ä¶ Like‚Ä¶ Rotting fruit and it had a metallic whiff to it. It was shadowed by great trees towering over us like guardians of the river. I also remember thinking it couldn‚Äôt be possible for the river to be here. Like, we were in New-Port-Richey where there were inlets from the ocean at the back of the properties, where people would get their skiffs, travel up the inlets and to the ocean and fish. What I‚Äôm trying to get at is that there shouldn‚Äôt be enough space! There would be no room, we should be at the side of one the inlets, on the mangroves but no, it was a spacious clearing and the river was definitely not one of the inlets because it was too narrow and it was the wrong color! The inlets were green, a muddy green! This was the wrong color, it was‚Ä¶ Black... This river shouldn‚Äôt be here, it was wrong.

‚ÄúWeird, right?‚Äù I ask Jet, expecting him to not understand and to ask what was weird. Jet didn‚Äôt respond and when I looked at him he had a distant look in his eyes.

‚ÄúJet?‚Äù I ask, tentatively. Jetson ignores me still and takes a step towards the river.

‚ÄúJet!‚Äù I say, raising my voice.

‚ÄúWhat the hell are you doing?‚Äù I add in. Jetson continues to ignore me and takes steps. He reaches the bank next to the rapids and drops down onto his knees.

‚ÄúJET!‚Äù I shout. Jetson whispers back to the river, as if the river actually was whispering and Jetson was just responding. I stride over to him and put a hand on his shoulder.

‚ÄúDude, stop ignoring me and stop acting weird, it‚Äôs creepy.‚ÄùI say, Jetson ignores this. Jetson points to the river. I look to where he points, and I don‚Äôt notice it at first but then I see it, his reflection was missing!

‚ÄúDude, what the fu-‚Äù. I began but I noticed Jet was gone. I spun around, looking for him, and then I spotted him, he was being pulled down the rapids!¬†

‚ÄúJET!!!‚Äù I shouted and jumped in after him and then I thudded against the ground.¬†

‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù I say, getting up on my shaky knees. The river was gone, it was just dirt, soil and mud, and through the bushes in the clearing, I saw the green murky inlet, mangroves on the side. My mum and my stepfather didn‚Äôt believe me. The cops didn‚Äôt believe me as well, of course they didn‚Äôt, who would believe that story? No one! The aftermath of the incident was horrible, when I dove into the ground, my lower face hit a rock stuck into the terrain. That caused me to dislocate my jaw and lose a few molars. My right knee hit the ground pretty hard as well, so I also fractured that kneecap. The cops checked out the scene of the incident and couldn‚Äôt find the river of course, only the inlet, which should have been there in the first place!

Like, what the hell! Who would drink water from the murky green inlet? And how could Jetson get swept away? The inlets have no current and Jetson can swim pretty well.

I thought about Jetson, how I could have stopped it, how I didn‚Äôt, and how I wanted to join him wherever he was‚Ä¶ I bushwhacked and I reached the clearing, there was no inlet and mangroves‚Ä¶ There was the river, back to claim me as well.

I‚Äôve noticed that during the day my brain feels like it‚Äôs working at about 20% capacity ‚Äî slow and tired. But at night my mind suddenly feels like it‚Äôs working at 300% ‚Äî clear, sharp, and focused. My mom experiences something similar, but my dad doesn‚Äôt.

I have allergies to pollen (I don't know if it is pollen, bacause I wasnt tested for it.) and usually get a runny nose during the summer. I take Aerius for it and runny noses get away. My mom is allergic to aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), and her brother also has allergies plus some skin rashes.

I need to say I'm very poor student a my grades are not good. I'm trying to learnt hard but I don't get it.

**Mapping the Minds of Cinema** pairs iconic film characters with their coordinates in Cognography ‚Äî a cognitive positioning system that maps how a mind perceives, judges, and structures experience.

In *Heat*, Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) embodies the CAS coordinate ‚Äî a mind oriented toward Conceptual Perception, Analytical Judgment, and Scripted Structure. His worldview is defined by pattern recognition, unemotional logic, and a disciplined adherence to pre-set rules.

**Perception ‚Äî Conceptual**  
He isn‚Äôt caught up in the physical or emotional mess of Chris‚Äôs situation. Even when prompted about furniture or relationships, his mind stays on patterns and principles ‚Äî ‚Äúwhen I get around to it,‚Äù ‚Äúnothing you can‚Äôt walk out on in 30 seconds.‚Äù His reality is filtered through a conceptual rule set, not immediate sensory or sentimental demands.

**Judgment ‚Äî Analytical**  
Neil assesses situations quietly and surgically. He asks direct, stripped-down questions (‚ÄúYou sure?‚Äù) and applies a logical framework to relationships, crime, and risk. His emotional responses are subdued, showing calculated detachment rather than empathy or pragmatic compromise.

**Structure ‚Äî Scripted**  
The ‚Äú30 seconds flat‚Äù rule appears again ‚Äî not as a one-off philosophy, but as a structural law governing every choice. His operational life is tightly scheduled and bound to disciplined execution. Even in casual conversation, he moves quickly back to action items: bank score, platinum, coffee shop at noon.

6# - It takes two - Maybe controversial but this is my least favourite out of the three hazelight titles, the dialogue and writing was just slightly worse than the other two entries. However, if you have a partner I‚Äôd still recommend

7# - Lego Star Wars 2 - A classic ps2 title that is still just Lego Star Wars, the only annoying thing about this port is having to replay every level maybe 3/4 times as some collectibles do not stack sadly

My dog passed in June and I had the last part of his cremation package arriving that day.

Chapter 1 - The Shattered Illusion

After five years of marriage, Natalia Webb received an unexpected invitation to a child's birthday party.

The message came from a mutual friend of hers and her husband, Alexander Powell. Moments later, the friend withdrew it‚Äîbut Natalia had already seen it.

The name of the child‚Äôs father on the invitation made her hands shake.

Alexander Powell.

Though common names existed, Natalia couldn‚Äôt ignore the sinking feeling in her chest. The next day, she found herself outside the party venue.

Inside the decorated hall, Alexander lifted a little girl into the air as she laughed and made a wish: ""I want Daddy to spend more time with me and Mommy!""

Beside them, a woman kissed the girl‚Äôs cheek before smiling at Alexander. ""My wish is for us to always be happy together.""

Natalia‚Äôs mind went numb.

A name could be coincidence‚Äîbut not that face. Twelve years together, five as his wife‚Äîshe knew him better than anyone.

Even among the guests, she spotted familiar faces.

Watching the picture-perfect family, Natalia‚Äôs eyes burned, but she couldn‚Äôt bring herself to step forward.

She turned and left.

The city streets buzzed with life, but her heart had frozen over.

She remembered their third anniversary, when she‚Äîonce firm about never having children‚Äîhad excitedly suggested, ""Alexander, let‚Äôs try for a baby.""

She‚Äôd expected joy, or at least surprise.

Instead, he‚Äôd hesitated before pulling her close.

""The company‚Äôs in a good place, but let‚Äôs wait a little longer, okay?""

Back then, she‚Äôd believed him.

Now, the truth hit like a slap.

How foolish she‚Äôd been.

They‚Äôd met in high school, academic rivals battling for first place.

At university, he‚Äôd pursued her relentlessly for a year.

From then on, his love had been all-consuming.

He was cold to everyone‚Äîexcept her.

During sophomore winter, when she had dawn classes, he brought her breakfast daily‚Äîcroissants kept warm in his coat, coffee steaming in a thermos.

Junior year, when a misdiagnosis suggested leukemia, he lit candles in the chapel and prayed for her.

At graduation, she fell during a dance performance. He didn‚Äôt leave her hospital bedside for three sleepless days.

When she woke, disoriented, he‚Äôd sobbed.

""Marry me. I can‚Äôt lose you.""

Later, she learned doctors had feared she wouldn‚Äôt wake.

Yet Alexander had knelt before her parents, swearing, ""Even if she never opens her eyes again, I‚Äôll marry her. She‚Äôs my only wife.""

After graduation, they wed.

When Alexander took over as CEO, his devotion never wavered‚Äîuntil even she, once childfree, dreamed of his baby.

She never imagined this.

Natalia dialed Alexander‚Äôs number.

He answered, background chatter faint behind him.

His voice was warm. ""Natalia, to what do I owe the pleasure?""

Across the street, she watched him step outside, his height making him stand out effortlessly.

""Alexander, where are you?""

Taken By My Gay Best Friend And His Boyfriend

Chapter One
Scarlet POV
Living with your best friend, who is also gay, has its benefits. Like now, fashion disaster hell. I've gone through everything, and there's not a single thing in this room that feels right.
Tonight is different, and I don't want to be wearing my generic crap, I want something unique and worthy of what tonight is. Swinging the door open, I stay in my lingerie.
""Zain!"" I call out, step back, and look at the mess in my room. I need to get this cleaned up before tonight as well. He walks in and laughs.
""Did you throw a bomb in here and watch it explode?"" His eyes look at the mess. ""Jesus, Scar, what were you looking for? An outfit for every day of the year?"" He holds up my exercise leggings. I'm confused right now. Do I need to get you a maid?""
Groaning, I throw a dress at him. ""Help me! I need something to wear for tonight!""
Sighing, he steps in. ""You realise only a few people are coming. It's nothing big, so you don't need to look top of the shelf.""
I know that. ""Yeah, I know, but I'm thinking tonight might be the best night to move things forward with Jacob."" I've put this off for years, and now... It feels so much like a burden, like something holding me back.
His eyes widen. ""Okay, then you need a full re-work, none of this will do."" He throws the leggings at me and tuts. ""You need help, serious help if you were going to wear any of these.""
""Are you joking? There has to be something here I can wear.""
""Darling, you're about to lose something that many keep sacred, something that you kept sacred for years. We're doing this properly. Now put on your big girl pants, and let's go shopping.""
I groan louder and let myself flop back onto the bed, my legs kicking uselessly in the air. ‚ÄúZain, I don‚Äôt want to go shopping. Can‚Äôt you just‚Äî‚Äù I grab a random black dress from the chaos and hold it up hopefully. ‚Äú‚Äîmake this work? Add a belt? That would work right, it would look amazing.‚Äù
He plucks it from my fingers like it‚Äôs contaminated. ‚ÄúSweetheart, unless you‚Äôre planning to mourn your virginity, this isn‚Äôt the vibe. Where the fuck did you even get this dress? Don't answer that, I don't want to know.‚Äù
I scowl and throw a pillow at him. ‚ÄúThen what am I supposed to wear?‚Äù
‚ÄúNot that,‚Äù he says dramatically before tossing the dress behind him. ‚ÄúNow come on, get dressed. Leggings, sneakers, hoodie. Functional, not fabulous. Save the fabulous for tonight.‚Äù
I stay slumped on the bed, groaning into the sheets. ‚ÄúYou are a menace.‚Äù
Zain ignores me, yanking open my drawers and tossing clothes at me one piece at a time. ‚ÄúCome on, move it. I‚Äôll literally drag you through the mall in your panties if I have to.‚Äù
Muttering curses under my breath, I peel myself off the bed and start dressing. Hoodie over my head. Leggings pulled up. I hop around trying to shove my feet into sneakers while Zain critiques my entire existence.
‚ÄúScar, for the love of Gucci, those leggings are inside out.‚Äù
Fuck my life! I yank them off quickly.
‚ÄúHurry up before I have to explain to mall security why my best friend is flashing shoppers.‚Äù
I give him the middle finger but wriggle into the leggings anyway, hopping on one foot as I jam my foot into the tight fabric. ‚ÄúMaybe you could just distract them with a song and dance,‚Äù I say.
‚ÄúSweetheart, you know I would,‚Äù he replies, tossing me a pair of sneakers next.
‚ÄúUber‚Äôs three minutes away,‚Äù he announces, slinging his messenger bag over his shoulder. ‚ÄúChop, chop, virgin queen.‚Äù
‚ÄúStop calling me that,‚Äù I hiss.
I pull them on quickly, shoving my foot in without untying the laces first. I grab my purse off the chair, stuffing my phone and wallet inside, then yank the apartment door open.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to get me arrested.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm just trying to set the tone for the evening!‚Äù he says with a wink. ‚ÄúTonight, we say goodbye to Princess Purity.‚Äù
I punch his arm, but I‚Äôm laughing too, nerves buzzing in my chest. I'm glad I have him, he makes all this so much easier, I can't imagine how scared shitless I would be without him here as my support.
‚ÄúKeys?‚Äù Zain prompts, already halfway out into the hall.
I backpedal, grabbing my keys off the side table. ‚ÄúGot them!‚Äù I lock the door behind us, twisting the key twice, then yank it out just as Zain is bouncing impatiently by the stairwell.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre slower than my grandma in stilettos,‚Äù he teases.
‚ÄúYeah, well, maybe your grandma has more energy than me,‚Äù I snap back, but there‚Äôs no real heat in it.
Chapter Two
Scarlet POV
We tromp down the stairs together, the concrete steps cool against the soles of my sneakers. The stairwell smells like dust and someone‚Äôs spilt takeout. When we hit the lobby, I shove the door open, holding it for Zain to saunter through.
Outside, the evening air is brisk and carries the scent of nearby food carts. The wind blows, and it lifts the edge of my hoodie, making me shiver.
Zain immediately shrugs out of his light jacket and throws it over my shoulders. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt have you freezing your tits off before you even get laid.‚Äù
I snort a laugh, tugging it tighter around me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so charming.‚Äù
‚ÄúI know,‚Äù he says brightly, tapping his phone.
A car turns the corner and slows in front of us, headlights sweeping over the sidewalk. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs our Uber,‚Äù he announces.
We walk over, Zain popping the back door open like a gentleman. I slide in first, scooting across the seat to give him room. He slams the door shut and buckles up in one smooth motion.
The driver, a guy in his forties wearing a baseball cap, glances at us through the rearview mirror. ‚ÄúVelour Mall, right?‚Äù
‚ÄúYep!‚Äù Zain chirps.
The driver nods and pulls away from the curb, merging into traffic.
The city crawls past the windows in a blur of neon signs and brake lights. I fiddle with the strap of my purse, my stomach tying itself into tighter knots the closer we get.
Zain is oblivious to my internal breakdown as he's scrolling through his phone again.
‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù he says, flashing the screen at me. ‚ÄúWe hit Zara first. Then maybe Elle & Co. if we don‚Äôt find anything. And if all else fails, we swing by Lust Boutique for the emergency slutwear.‚Äù
I cough, nearly choking on my own spit.
‚ÄúKidding. Sort of.‚Äù He grins, pocketing the phone. ‚ÄúWe are not leaving until we find something that makes him forget his damn name.‚Äù
I stare out the window, watching the rows of shops and diners slide by. ‚ÄúWhat if he doesn‚Äôt even notice?‚Äù
Zain gives me a sharp look. ‚ÄúScarlet. Honey. Men are not that complicated. You look hot? He notices.‚Äù
I smile faintly, but the anxiety doesn‚Äôt fully loosen its grip.
The Uber glides into the mall‚Äôs drop-off lane, easing up next to the curb.
Zain unbuckles and flings his door open. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go, gorgeous.‚Äù
Following him out, I close the door behind me and step onto the sidewalk. The driver gives a little wave before pulling away, tires crunching over gravel.
The mall looms in front of us, its lights bright against the dimming sky. People are coming and going, arms loaded with shopping bags, and the low hum of chatter fills the air.
Zain loops his arm through mine and tugs me toward the entrance. ‚ÄúOnward to glory!‚Äù
This is going to be painfully long. The sliding doors woosh open, letting a wave of cold air blast over us. I hug his jacket tighter around myself as we step inside.
The mall smells like pretzels, coffee, and the faint chemical tang of new clothes. Music hums through the overhead speakers, but it's nothing I recognise, just an upbeat pop song with a heavy bass beat.
Zain guides us straight to the escalators. We ride up the steps hum beneath our feet, and I tap my fingers nervously against the rubber railing.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not chickening out, are you?‚Äù Zain teases.
‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I lie.
He grins. ‚ÄúGood. Because if you do, I‚Äôm making you try on leather pants. No backsies.‚Äù
I groan loudly enough that a woman nearby glances over.
We reach the second floor and step off the escalator, the polished tile gleaming under the overhead lights. Boutique stores stretch out in both directions, glittering with expensive displays.
Zain scans the shops with a critical eye, then points. ‚ÄúThere. Velour. They‚Äôll have something perfect.‚Äù
We head toward it, weaving around slow-walking teenagers and a woman wrangling a double stroller. Zain leads the way into the boutique without hesitation, holding the door for me.
Inside, everything smells like expensive perfume. Mannequins in tiny dresses and sky-high heels pose under spotlights, and the racks are packed with silk, velvet, and leather.
Zain claps his hands together. ‚ÄúMission time.‚Äù
He beelines for a rack of dresses, fingers flipping through hangers faster than I can even register.
‚ÄúNo. No. God, no,‚Äù he mutters. ‚ÄúMaybe if you wanted to scare him away...‚Äù
I trail after him, picking half-heartedly at a rack of satin dresses. Nothing feels right.
Chapter Three
Scarlet POV
Suddenly Zain gasps like he‚Äôs found the Holy Grail. ‚ÄúScar! Over here!‚Äù
He holds up a black dress, simple, sleek, short, but with a plunging neckline and thin spaghetti straps. The fabric looks buttery soft under the lights.
I step closer, heart thudding. This is, well...Woah. How do I explain this dress? Other than it should be illegal, but damn it looks beautiful at the same time.
‚ÄúYou have to try it,‚Äù he says, already pushing it into my arms.
I nod mutely, hugging the dress against my chest.
‚ÄúThe dressing rooms are back there,‚Äù a salesgirl chirps, appearing out of nowhere with a blinding smile.
‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I mumble, following Zain to the back of the store.
The dressing rooms are small but clean, mirrors are lining the walls, and overhead lights are a little too bright.
I duck into one, hanging the dress carefully on the hook. I peel off the hoodie and leggings, shivering slightly in just my underwear. My fingers fumble a little as I pull the dress over my head.
It glides down my body like water, clinging to curves I usually pretend don‚Äôt exist.
When I step out, Zain is waiting, arms crossed, eyes bright.
The moment he sees me, he presses a hand to his heart dramatically. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna cause accidents.‚Äù
I flush under the intensity of his gaze, smoothing the dress over my hips.
‚ÄúIs it too much?‚Äù I ask, biting my lip.
‚ÄúToo much? It‚Äôs perfect. Sexy but still classy. You look like someone who knows exactly what she wants, and is about to take it.‚Äù
I turn to the mirror, hardly recognizing the girl staring back at me. Maybe tonight won‚Äôt be so scary after all.
I twist in front of the mirror one more time, heart hammering in my chest. The dress really is perfect. It hugs my waist, dips low enough to hint at cleavage without screaming desperation, and the way the fabric shimmers under the lights almost makes me feel... dangerous.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre buying it,‚Äù Zain says firmly, already yanking the tag up to check the price. He winces slightly but recovers fast. ‚ÄúWorth every penny. Let‚Äôs go, Cinderella.‚Äù
Just like that, the first dress he finds is perfect. ""I envy you,"" I mutter, and he laughs.
""What's to envy? Other than my fabulous hair?""
""Are you joking? In less than five minutes, you find the perfect dress! How?"" I would have been here for weeks.
""All in the fashion, trust me. You're buying it, ignore the price, I'll pay, as a celebration and gift for you finally losing your virginity, even if it could be a better guy.""
""Don't,"" I warn, and he laughs, holding up his hands.
I duck back into the changing room, shimmying carefully out of the dress, and wrangle my hoodie and leggings back on. My fingers are clumsy, still buzzing from how different I felt in that fabric.
When I step out, Zain is waiting at the counter, the dress slung over his arm like a trophy.
I shuffle over to him, cheeks burning. The salesgirl gives us a plastic smile as she rings it up, folding the dress delicately into crisp tissue paper and sliding it into a glossy bag with the store‚Äôs gold logo.
Zain whips out his card before I can even reach for my purse.
‚ÄúZain‚Äî‚Äù I start.
‚ÄúNope,‚Äù he says brightly, tapping the card reader. ‚ÄúI mean it. Consider it a sacrificial offering to the goddess you‚Äôre about to become tonight.‚Äù
I roll my eyes but mutter a soft ‚Äúthank you‚Äù as he grabs the bag.
We step back out into the mall, the noise and bright lights hitting me like a wave. For a moment, I just stand there, clutching the bag like a lifeline.
‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù Zain says, linking his arm through mine again. ‚ÄúStep two.‚Äù
I blink up at him, stomach knotting tighter. ‚ÄúStep two?‚Äù
He grins, all evil mischief. ‚ÄúWe got the dress. Now we get the armor underneath.‚Äù
I immediately don‚Äôt like the sound of that. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean by armor?‚Äù
‚ÄúScar,‚Äù he says patiently, as if explaining something to a particularly slow child. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt wear grandma panties under that. You need lingerie. Sexy, scandalous, soul-snatching lingerie.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äî I don‚Äôt need‚Äî‚Äù I sputter.
‚ÄúYou do,‚Äù he says, steering me across the walkway with terrifying determination. ‚ÄúTrust me.‚Äù
I glance around, trying to spot where he‚Äôs taking me. When I see it, I stumble a little.
‚ÄúZain,‚Äù I hiss, tugging on his arm. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he sing-songs, dragging me closer.
It‚Äôs not just a lingerie shop. It‚Äôs a full-on adult store. Neon pink signs. Mannequins in latex. A huge display window with more dildos than I ever wanted to see in my lifetime.
Chapter Four
Scarlet POV
My entire body locks up. ‚ÄúZain, I‚Äôm not going in there.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou are,‚Äù he says, already pulling me toward the door.
‚ÄúNo, seriously, I‚Äî‚Äù
He stops, turning to face me, holding both my shoulders. His hands are warm through the hoodie and his jacket.
‚ÄúScarlet. Listen to me. No one cares. No one‚Äôs going to look at you weird. People come here for the same reason you are, to feel sexy. You deserve to feel sexy. Tonight is a big deal for you, and you are going to own it.‚Äù
I swallow hard, shifting from foot to foot. Everything inside me is screaming to run back to the safety of food courts and Forever 21.
But Zain‚Äôs eyes are steady. Warm. Fierce.
Deep down, a tiny, reckless part of me wants to feel the way I did in that dress again.
Powerful. In control, so I blow out a breath and nod. ‚ÄúFine. But if anyone I know sees me, I‚Äôm killing you.‚Äù
He grins, looping his arm back through mine. ‚ÄúDeal.‚Äù He pushes the door open with a flourish. The inside of the store is... a lot.
Velvet curtains, low, thumping music, racks of lace, satin, and leather, shelves lined with vibrators, handcuffs, and oils. I try not to look too hard at anything, keeping my eyes glued to the floor, like that might make me invisible.
Of course, Zain is in his element. He leads me straight past the more hardcore sections, toward a display of lingerie sets on glossy black mannequins.
‚ÄúHere we go,‚Äù he says, flipping through a rack of lacy bras and matching panties. ‚ÄúNothing scary. Just sexy.‚Äù
I hover awkwardly behind him, clutching the dress bag to my chest like a shield.
‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù he says, pulling out a few options and holding them up for my inspection.
One is deep red lace, sheer and strappy.
Another is black satin with tiny, delicate bows.
The last is a barely-there mesh set that makes my face flame just looking at it.
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wear that,‚Äù I whisper.
‚ÄúYou absolutely can,‚Äù he says firmly, thrusting the black satin set into my hands. ‚ÄúThis one. It‚Äôs sexy but not screaming ‚ÄòI have no idea what I‚Äôm doing.‚Äô‚Äù
I stare at the delicate material in my hands, my heart hammering.
‚ÄúWhat if he thinks it‚Äôs too much?‚Äù I say quietly.
Zain snorts. ‚ÄúHoney, men don‚Äôt think when they see lingerie. Their brains just short-circuit. Especially if it‚Äôs on someone as hot as you.‚Äù
I press the set against my chest, feeling like a deer caught in headlights.
Zain softens. He steps closer, squeezing my shoulder.
‚ÄúScar... This isn‚Äôt about him. It‚Äôs about you. Wear it for you. Because you deserve to feel like a damn goddess, whether he worships you properly or not.‚Äù
I nod, biting my lip.
‚ÄúGood.‚Äù He pats my back. ‚ÄúNow, go try it on. And if you don‚Äôt, I swear to God, I‚Äôll start picking out crotchless ones instead.‚Äù
I groan but shuffle toward the fitting rooms at the back of the shop, cheeks burning the entire way. The fitting room is even smaller than the boutique‚Äôs, just a velvet curtain separating me from the rest of the store.
Standing here, I stare down at the lingerie in my hands, black satin, tiny delicate straps, little bows so small they feel like a joke.
My fingers tremble slightly as I peel off my hoodie and leggings again, leaving me in just my old cotton underwear and a sports bra. I look down at myself, grimacing.
Yeah... Not exactly the stuff of fantasies.
Quickly, I strip off the plain underwear and carefully slide the new set on. The satin bra cups lift and shape me perfectly, the panties soft and snug, sitting high on my hips.
Chapter Five
Scarlet POV
When I catch my reflection, I freeze. I don‚Äôt look like me.
I look... confident. Like the kind of woman who knows exactly what she‚Äôs doing. Even if, inside, I‚Äôm shaking like a leaf.
‚ÄúScar?‚Äù Zain calls through the curtain. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt come out in the next thirty seconds, I‚Äôm coming in and getting an eyeful.‚Äù
I groan, cover my face for a second, then drag my feet to the curtain. Peeking out, I see him standing there with his hands on his hips, eyebrow arched like he‚Äôs waiting for a performance.
‚ÄúWell? Let‚Äôs see it!‚Äù
Squeezing my eyes shut for a moment, I step out.
When I open them again, Zain is staring, and for once, he‚Äôs silent.
His mouth hangs open slightly, like he‚Äôs actually stunned. He whistles low under his breath and places one hand dramatically over his heart. ‚ÄúSweetheart... you just ended world peace.‚Äù
I feel my cheeks go nuclear. ‚ÄúStop it.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious!‚Äù he says, circling me like he‚Äôs inspecting fine art. ‚ÄúIf Jacob even thinks about looking away from you tonight, I will personally castrate him with a glitter pen.‚Äù
I burst out laughing, hugging myself awkwardly.
‚ÄúYou really think it looks okay?‚Äù
Zain gives me an exaggerated glare. ‚ÄúScar, you look like sex on legs. In fact, you‚Äôre not allowed to wear that outside your bedroom. I feel like I should throw a jacket over you and escort you to a safe house.‚Äù
I laugh harder, the anxiety loosening its death grip a little. I twirl once, the soft satin brushing my skin.
‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I say, cheeks burning. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take it.‚Äù
‚ÄúThank God,‚Äù Zain says, clapping his hands. ‚ÄúNow go get dressed before some poor sap in here has a heart attack.‚Äù
I duck back into the fitting room, my face still flaming, and shimmy out of the lingerie. Sliding back into my leggings and hoodie feels weirdly anticlimactic after seeing myself like that.
I fold the lingerie carefully and carry it back out where Zain is already bouncing on his heels.
‚ÄúYou ready to make questionable decisions and traumatize people with that body?‚Äù he teases.
‚ÄúShut up,‚Äù I mutter, pushing him toward the register.
We pay... well, Zain pays, because he insists this is all ‚Äúhis legacy‚Äù, and step back out into the mall.
As soon as the door swings shut behind us, Zain spins on his heel, pointing a finger dramatically at me.
‚ÄúNow listen carefully, Scarlet Louise.‚Äù
I blink at him. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù
He jabs the air for emphasis. ‚ÄúThe underwear you‚Äôre wearing right now, the cotton, the sports bra, the tragic neutral colors ‚Äî must never see the light of day again.‚Äù
I gape at him, laughing.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious!‚Äù he says, pacing like a general giving a war speech. ‚ÄúThey die tonight. They die with your virginity. You will bury them. You will burn them. You will exorcise them.‚Äù
I double over, clutching the dress bag and the lingerie bag to my chest, trying not to wheeze from laughing.
Zain grabs my shoulders, giving me a firm shake. ‚ÄúPromise me, Scar. Promise me you will destroy them.‚Äù
‚ÄúOkay!‚Äù I gasp. ‚ÄúOkay, I promise.‚Äù
He nods solemnly, like he‚Äôs just saved my eternal soul.
Then his face brightens again. ‚ÄúNow, pretzel?‚Äù
I snort, still giggling. ‚ÄúDefinitely pretzel.‚Äù
He links our arms together again and we march down the mall like we‚Äôve just survived a war. Behind us, the neon glow of the sex shop fades away, but the weirdest thing is... I don‚Äôt feel embarrassed anymore.",1,1754727355.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False
