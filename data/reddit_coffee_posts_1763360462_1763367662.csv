I'm currently in a full-time office job but looking to pick up part-time shifts (evenings and/or weekends) at Costa coffee chain to help supplement my income. I'm based in the UK, London and excited about the role, but my background is all office-based with no direct retail or catering experience, which I think is why my applications haven't gone far.

I'm worried my CV might come across as overqualified (I'm a manager) or mismatched since it highlights unrelated skills. Should I downplay or omit my current work history to seem more entry-level and ""unskilled,"" or is there a better way to present transferable skills like communication and teamwork from my office role? Any tips on tailoring my CV for Costa, or what stands out to managers when reviewing applications from non-retail backgrounds?

Thanks in advance for any advice!",1,1763367248.0,Costa,0,1.0,False

not sure if i'm using the right flair but if anyone's going to Baguio, baka bet nyo saluhin ung transient na nabook ko🥹 

Php 1,200 for 2pax 

i paid 1.2k for downpayment ng 3d2n (1.2k per night)  pero sabi sakin is pwedeng 2d1n lang if may kukuha so up to you if alin ia-avail. 

i've tried this transient twice already and i guarantee na it's a good one. it's perfect for those na naka-budget trip lang and it's location is near sa pinaka-center ng city. hindi lang kami makakatuloy umakyat since super busy sa school and work 

details about the transient: 
- includes breakfast and coffee
- no aircon pero with fans and malamig naman ung location 
- own CR with heater
- clean amenities 
- comfy bed ( i swear !! we almost missed our itinerary kasi super lambot and comfy ng beds nila) 
- no curfew 
- limited parking space 

location: 

Lower P. Burgos - near Sto. Nino Slaughterhouse / Balajadia's Kitchen 
 
- one jeep away from Burnham and SM (diretso baba) 
- already tried walking papunta nightmarket and wala mang 30 mins nakarating na ako 
- near Baguio Market 

please message me if you're interested and i can show proof of legitimacy if ever

1ozarm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ozarm8/best_friend_confessed_he_loves_me/,Best friend confessed he loves me ..,"So… this is a mess and I’m not sure how to explain it without sounding all over the place.
I’ve had this best friend for years 
let’s call him David. From the moment we met, it felt like we’d be in each other’s lives forever. Our families are close, he’s basically been like extended family.

For context David has slept with my sister and two of my distant friends. He even set me up on a date with one of his friends. Just keep that in mind.

Recently, the man I genuinely thought I was going to marry and I broke up. It was heartbreaking. We didn’t end because of cheating or fighting ..we just grew apart even though we still cared about each other deeply.

In the middle of all that, I went to get coffee with David because I needed to clear my head. At first he listened, gave advice, tried to help me sort through everything.

Then out of nowhere, he stops, looks me dead in the face, and says:

“He was a loser. You deserved better. I’m in love with you and I know we’d be incredibly happy if you’d just give me a chance.”

My brain just… froze. My first instinct was to defend my ex. I told him no, absolutely not. I reminded him that we already agreed nothing romantic would ever happen between us — and, hello, he slept with my sister. Like… how am I supposed to overlook that?

After that the whole vibe just died. We both went quiet and then went home. I didn’t hear from him for over a month.

Then last week we ended up at the same BBQ with mutual friends. We did the normal small talk. But then he starts telling our friend Amanda that he can “manipulate people into doing what he wants” and that he’s used those tactics on women before. I ignored it, but it definitely stuck with me.

And THEN he looks at me, winks, and whispers that he meant every word he said earlier — and he’s still planning to get his chance with me.

I told my mom about it and she tried to reassure me, saying maybe he just cares, maybe it’s harmless… but honestly, I can’t shake how wrong it felt.

So here’s my question:

Am I the asshole for wanting to cut him out of my life completely?
Block and  never look back type deal?
Because in a moment where I was genuinely hurting, he made everything about himself. He dismissed my feelings, talked down about someone I loved, and acted like my heartbreak was his opportunity.

I just feel really gross about the whole thing.  He keeps making overly excessive attempts to reach out.. far more often than before.",1,1763367148.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

We all heard it countless times and it is always the same.

My long story short is that I talked to someone 1 year ago and although no contact at all, I keep reminded about him.

Long story: Talked 3-4 months, never saw each other face to face and never did any haram. Alhamdulillah.

We were in different cities, I was far away, 6 hours of driving with car in one direction. Never managed to see each other.

Ok, we figured out it doesn’t work and we split.

I deleted him, blocked him and never spoke to each other again.

I had and have very bad time forgetting him.

I’ve spent my whole ramadan praying for reunite, searching for Laylatul Qadr and asking Allah for him on the day of Arafah. Not blindly, but also making it good and if it is not, please remove the feelings.

7 months ago it was so bad I was begging Allah for few hours to stop everything, I want to move on because this is not healthy and asked him to send me a man who is meant for me.

1 hour later I saw him in a grocery store, eye to eye (check my last post, it is very interesting), but I just walked passed, not even saying hi.

Now I’m thinking I’ve messed up my chance and thinking about it 7 months later.

Never saw him again.

I said ti myself again - Ok, this needs to stop, you should move on, you will be fine.

Alright, let’s go!

Few months later, my new friend (I moved to this new city remember) is looking actively for someone for me. She is married and her and her husband have great circles of good people.

She proposed some people and one day she mentioned him, saying he is a great guy here, everyone knows him, works hard, follows religion etc. She doesn’t know we ever talked.

I told her the story and she stopped mentioning him.

Ok, keep moving on.

Bear in mind, I’m not even stalking him, I want strict no contact because I wanna forget.

Few night ago I had a dream about him. He was very close to me and I could feel his presence, like it was real…

And then yesterday… I went with friends to another city for a football game. While we were  sitting in one coffee shop, I looked left and saw someone who looks EXACTLY like him. Like they are twins!

I didn’t know it will hurt me that. 

I asked one of the friends to tell me something about his features so I could tell if it is him and he was not. But before that she said he has a ring!

That hurt even more and my first thought was “I don’t wanna him to be married to someone else, but me, I need to pray tahajjud again and increase my duas”. 

Later when I passed by that man, I saw it is not him.

Whole night I was thinking about that and forgot the event and was alone in the company of thousands of people.

I’m still thinking about all of it.

He deactivated all his accounts. Saw it because I wanted to see if he got married (I thought maybe this is was Allah wanted to tell me with that ring and the guy I saw).

I prayed istikhara last night before sleep and I said - ok, this is not normal anymore, I need to know and I need a change of situation.

I asked Allah for a specific dream if he wants us together. I didn’t get that dream, don’t even remember what I dreamed of.

The ending line - I’m trying to move on and forget because that man is not in my life at all and I keep getting reminded of him which is setting me back.

The duas I’m making I don’t see any answer, I am just confused.

I keep telling myself that he maybe even got married and this need to stop and here I am, writing super long post about the things I never told anyone.

Please give me a good advice, I’m trying to tie my camel. I’m trying to do my part, I started and wanted to move on, but It doesn’t help to see him in the dreams, to see someone who looks the same as him, it doesn’t help when people recommend him…

Curiosity won, so I ran a tiny experiment:

1. Heated water to 90 °C in **two** kettles: Basic plastic kettle and 18/8 stainless-steel kettle.

2. Steeped 4 g of the same loose-leaf tea in separate cups for 4 min.

3. Smelled, tasted, then poured each sample through a coffee filter to check any residue.

# Why it matters

**BPA & micro-plastics**: Heat makes plastic leach chemicals and tiny fragments into your drink.

**Flavour**: Stainless (and glass) stay neutral, so the tea actually tastes like tea.

**Longevity**: A decent steel kettle lasts years and is fully recyclable when it finally dies.

Now we're not talking again. What do I do?","The original 9 month period resulted because of a bunch of explosive fights in a shirt time period. if anyone wants me to elaborate in the comments, I will. Honestly, a lot of them were screaming matches and I said a bunch of mean shit as well, it was also my fault to be clear. For example, I said I preferred my mom over him, was basically glaring and pointing at him the entire time, overall my tone was very disrespectful and it's hard to describe specifics because a lot of it was in tone and body language.

To summarize, though, in our biggest fight, I told my dad, ""If you're not going to understand what I'm saying, I'm not going to talk to you."" And he loves giving the silent treatment. He's been doing it since I was 8, and I'm always the one to go and apologize. I didn't this time, though, so he took away my phone, didn't let me watch TV at all, didn't let me go to clubs after school, turned the wifi off to my school computer, didn't let me go grocery shopping with my mom because he knew I liked it, stopped buying oat milk because I like using it in my tea/coffee, didn't let me go shopping for clothes, etc. He would take pictures of me and save them when I was upset or record me (he knows I hate being on camera). One time that really hurt was I was super excited about my school's homecoming parade, and I thought that if I convinced my mom to take the entire family I could tag along too. He took everyone except for me. I didn't get any birthday presents that year. He did all of this to try and push me to talk to him out of necessity, but I'm just as petty as he is. I didn't speak a word to him until I just couldn't fucking handle it anymore because finals season was coming up.

This time it started out much more ridiculous, though. About two weeks ago, my parents were getting our cabinets repainted and I suggested a dark color. Everyone in my family agreed on that except my dad. When I told him, he basically just came up with 10 excuses to undermine everything I was saying, and it made me so mad that he always had to be right all the time, which is what actually upset me. I got way too pissed about it for sure, I'll admit. I went downstairs and was loudly complaining to my brother (also my fault) about the colors, not even talking about my dad really, and he stomps downstairs, basically asking me what my fucking problem is. I asked him if he even heard what I was saying, (he didnt respond) and he told me I can't go and pick out the color with him anymore lol. I was still honestly infuriated that he gets all worked up when he doesn't even know what I was saying and I loudly complained about that too. I know I started this, and at root it's my fault for making an issue.

He came back downstairs and said I wasn't allowed to study at our dining room table anymore (he hates us sitting in our living room because he thinks we'll ruin the furniture for when he invites guests over, plus the electricity bill from more lights I guess). I started talking back and I asked him, ""What'll you do? Take my phone away? Turn the wifi off? Take away my computer?"" as I still don't have a phone at this point, and the wifi isn't on on my school computer because he can't use parental controls. That pissed him off even more and we basically just ended up yelling at each other a bunch until he told my mom ""She needs to leave the house, she causes all the problems in here."" I said I'll leave, he said it was fine by him, so I put my jacket and shoes on, and left. He said nothing. I came back about 3 hours later at 1 am.

I never planned on actually running away ofc, but he loves tossing words around and I was tired of it. I haven't spoken to him since, and my mom won't speak to him either because he had the audacity to ask her why SHE didn't stop me from leaving the house when he told me to basically get out. What am I supposed to do now???? Whenever someone talks to him first he takes it as confirmation that he was right and thinks he holds power over us.

I know I was being a jerk,​ and I know I was acting like a baby, but I'm just so tired of him. I'm tired of him putting the emotional burden on everyone else to fix things, or trying to use things I enjoy or even things I literally need against me. I start out feeling guilty in situations like these and lose it all because he retaliates by trying to make me miserable. He even hid my carton of my favorite drink in his car after this, and then stomped around the house when I found it. I should be sorry, but I'm not because I'm just so done with him, and honestly, I'm just like him. I'm too stubborn and petty to feel any real remorse, and I can't bring myself to fake apologies. I know I'm not the angel in this situation, but I'm just so, so bitter. I don't know what to do. I can't let go of anything.

TL;DR: We didnt speak for 9 months over a series of arguments. I got upset and left the house over something small and we haven't spoken since.",1,1763366398.0,relationships,6,1.0,False

Am I the asshole for getting pissed off at my partner for breaking up with me how he did??? 


My husband and I broke up on Nov. 1st, 2025 after being together for three yrs, in which I almost lost him twice due to cancer, which absolutely killed me each time to sit and witness it… The few problems we had in our relationship was mostly centered around stuff like chores, jobs, money, etc. On Halloween night we had amazing s3x, and had a great morning the next day. We went over to his mom’s house for coffee, hallmark Christmas movies (her absolute favorite) and our little crochet corner we had going on. We ended up in a small fight over lunch because I have a lot of food insecurities from the past trauma. So since things were getting heated, I decided to stop what I was doing, go home to take anxiety meds, smoke, and give everyone a chance to calm down and breathe. He ended up calling me saying that he was done and that he wanted to break up. So, of course I started sobbing and ran back over to try and talk to him and see wtf had just happened. He went off saying that he was done with me and my bs and that he can’t do this anymore. Despite my heart breaking, I tried to calm him down and everything, and it made him even more mad. He then started yelling at me again saying, “No, shut up! I’m not your love, I’m not your babe, I’m not your husband, I’m nothing to you anymore. I’m done. I want you to get your stuff and get out of my house, and out of mom’s house. You’ve made me resent you to where sometimes I can’t even stand to be in the same room as you without getting upset, Cam” And to make matters worse, all of this happened in front of his mom.. 

I had no money saved up so I couldn’t afford a hotel or anything that night and my friend had their cousin that weekend, so I ended up packing up my car, parking at a hiking trail, and slept in my car. About a week later we both just so happened to have therapy appts at the same time that day. His mom gave him a ride that day and they sat on the far side of the waiting room from me and didn’t even acknowledge me. He called me later and said, “since according to what I’ve been told, you seem to think that we’re just on a break, let me clear things up. I’m breaking up with you, me and mom have already started packing up your stuff in boxes for you to pick up later. But I don’t want you to step foot in my house or to ever see MY cats again, so I’m keeping your stuff at mom’s house.” At the end of the conversation he made a comment saying, “if for whatever reason the universe thinks we should be together again, then so be it, but that probably won’t be for a long time. You don’t know what it’s like to be independent at all and you’re just really immature and definitely not at my level. But I guess only time and the universe will tell, and I want you to know that this is hurting me also, but I have to do this for myself. It wasn’t and easy choice to make and wasn’t a spur of the moment thing either. I’ve been thinking about this for awhile now”


(Like, I’m sorry.. B!tch what??? You wanna say that again for the people in the back??? 
You’ve been thinking about whether or not to break up with me for awhile now??? Someone that you always said was your ride or die, and best person that you’ve ever dated???)


Fast forward to literally last night, where I FINALLY get a text back from him since we broke up. Caption??? “I thought that you would like this also, and I didn’t have anyone else to share this with or anything” Opened it… a link to a porno he found.. 😑😑😑 And then proceeded to ask me to send him the latest videos I’ve made. (I’m a cornstar on the side) 

Followed by a little bit of a conversation, in which he ends up saying, “I enjoyed our time together. You made a huge positive impact in my life. You have so much love and kindness to give, and you deserve to be with someone that makes you happy. But I don’t plan on ever getting back together with you, Cam. I thought that you understand that. I’m completely done for good. I’m sorry if that upsets you and if I just hurt you again. But I hope that eventually we can just be friends, because it would still be nice to have you in my life in some way” 


So, I guess my question is, do I have the right to be pissed off with him??? Because yes, I had felt him becoming distant about a month or two before this, and ended up self-sabotaging the relationship because I knew what was probably coming next.. I felt it in my jellies, and my jellies have never steered me wrong before. Am I the asshole here for being kinda pissed off at him for how all of this happened??? Or is what he did/said valid??? 

Please no hate or negative comments, just genuinely asking for advice here… 😭💔😭

I’ve had a Saeco GranAroma for about 3 years. Overall it served me well, even though it constantly spilled coffee grounds inside the internals and required daily deep cleaning. We make around 6 cappuccinos a day, so speed and convenience mattered more than perfection.

Recently the milk frothing started failing. It works fine for the first ~60% of the cycle, then chokes and sputters for the remaining 40%. I’ve done:
- Full cleaning of every detachable part
- Descaling
- Milk system deep clean
- Coffee oil remover cycle
- Manual scrubbing of all silicone and plastic components
- applied back all the grease 

Each time the first coffee is perfect, then it goes back to choking.

Before I retire it and switch to a Jura, I’d like to know if there is anything else I can try. I know I can buy the external frother, but I prefer a clean countertop. Also, since we use two different milks, dropping the tube directly into the bottle is much more convenient than cleaning a separate frother between milks.

Has anyone fixed this issue permanently? Any insider tips, hidden parts to replace, or known weak points of the GranAroma milk system?",1,1763366113.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

I was in Bangkok first and honestly hated it. Too loud, polluted, hedonistic energy everywhere. I couldn't find a tight-knit community, just people passing through. 

Now I'm in Koh Lanta and while it's beautiful, I'm realizing it may not be what I'm looking for. It's mostly backpackers, old expats, and tourists. The accommodation is mainly bungalows, there are no gyms, and you need a scooter to get anywhere. I also haven't met any educated Thai women here seems like they don't actually live in places like this as they leave for University in other places.


What I'm looking for:

My routine is pretty simple: wake up at 6am, short walk, coffee, deep work until noon, eat, walk around, workout, then usually meet someone for a date in the evening. I work a few focused hours per day and I really value that time being undisturbed.



My main priorities are undisturbed work in a proper apartment, dating long term (educated Thai women or serious western women) and weightlifting 

I need:
- A proper apartment with AC where I can work in peace
- Walkability, like actual sidewalks, shade from trees, the kind of walking you'd do in a European city. I don't want to rent a scooter or hear them constantly
- A real gym since I'm trying to bulk
- Community of serious digital nomads and online business people, not just backpackers
- Dating pool of both local educated women and serious western women 
- Affordable
- No tourism needed, I'm here to work and build a routine


I keep hearing Chiang Mai but wanted to check if there are other options I'm missing, or if specific areas of Chiang Mai are better than others for what I'm after.

Been together 9 years.

My boyfriend came home from a team-building once, and while he was sleeping he mentioned a female co-worker’s name. It bothered me, so I checked his account and saw a group chat where another co-worker was teasing him about her. When I asked the co-worker, he said it was just a joke because he saw them go out for lunch. My boyfriend also said she was just a co-worker.

Later on, I met her when I joined his team for a movie. She didn’t talk to me at all. During dinner, she even switched seats so she ended up beside my boyfriend. While my boyfriend was asking me what I wanted to eat, she kept inserting herself and asking him about his order. She also took off her jacket and had a tube top underneath.

When we were going home, my boyfriend and I offered to drop everyone off at their bus stops. The girl kept telling everyone not to accept because my boyfriend “must be tired.”

I’ve met them a couple more times since then, and another co-worker even asked me why this girl and the guys close to my boyfriend don’t talk to me. She said it’s strange because they’re close to their boss, and I’m his girlfriend. She also mentioned that the girl pretends she’s not close to my boyfriend in front of me, but is always looking for him at work.

After I finally expressed my feelings to my boyfriend, he stopped going out with them unless I’m there. But now it’s awkward because his close friends and that girl ignore me whenever we’re together. The good thing is the other female co-workers actually vibe with me and treat me normally.

What triggered me again was that a co-worker invited my boyfriend for coffee last night and sent a picture of that girl.

TL;DR; My boyfriend mentioned a female co-worker’s name in his sleep. I later found out he was teased about her in their group chat. When I met her, she ignored me, acted weirdly around my boyfriend, and even switched seats to sit beside him. Some of his close friends also ignore me, and another co-worker said the girl looks for my boyfriend a lot at work. After I expressed my feelings, my boyfriend stopped going out with them without me, but now it’s awkward because his close friends and that girl still ignore me. Other female co-workers are fine with me. Last night a co-worker sent my boyfriend a photo of the girl again, which triggered everything.",2,1763366086.0,relationships,2,1.0,False

1ozagtw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_Rl35yuqaU,The Culture of Sporting in Modern France,"# The Culture of Sporting in Modern France: Inside the World of Ball-Trap

Sporting clays in France — known locally as [ball-trap](https://clayarena.com/fr-fr/) — is far more than a sport. It is a cultural identity built on heritage, landscape, precision, and the uniquely French blend of technique, aesthetics, and community.

Today, France stands as one of the global capitals of **parcours de chasse**, **compak sporting**, and **tir aux plateaux**, supported by one of the densest networks of shooting grounds in Europe.

# 1. What Ball-Trap Means in France Today

In the French sporting world, **ball-trap** is the umbrella term for all clay-target disciplines. Within it live:

* [Parcours de Chasse](https://clayarena.com/fr-fr/) **(PC)** — classic open-terrain sporting
* **Compak Sporting (CS)** — compact sporting inside the **cage**
* **Fosse Universelle**, **Fosse Olympique**, **Skeet**, **Hélices**, and others

But it’s **sporting** — PC and Compak — that defines the modern French identity of clay shooting.

As shooters often say at French grounds:

>

# 2. The Density of Shooting Culture: Clubs de Ball-Trap Across France

France hosts one of the strongest infrastructures for clay sports in the world:

* Over **560+ clubs de ball-trap**
* Hundreds of **stand de tir** with PC and CS layouts
* High density of shooting grounds from the Atlantic coast to Provence and the Alps
* One of the largest national competition calendars in Europe

A typical modern French sporting ground includes:

* **tour de tir** (high tower)
* machines **A, B, C, D**
* **menu des plateaux** (target menu)
* **plateaux battue**, **chandelle**, **lapin roulant**
* rich forests, vineyards, hills, rock walls, and natural terrain

France remains one of the few countries where the course **does not imitate nature — it** ***is*** **nature.**

# 3. Why Sporting Is So Popular in Modern France

# 1. Hunting Heritage Meets Athletic Precision

Because Parcours de Chasse recreates natural scenarios — **fuyants**, **entrants**, **rasants**, **doublettes** — it is extremely popular among both hunters and sport shooters.

# 2. Beautiful, Natural Terrain

French PC courses are famous for landscapes:  
wooded ridges, vineyards, ravines, rolling hills, pine forests.

# 3. Social & Gastronomic Culture

A French shooting ground almost always includes:

* a terrace
* good coffee
* a warm clubhouse
* food, conversation, and community

>

# 4. Strong FITASC Influence

As the birthplace of FITASC, France naturally carries strong sporting traditions, rules, and course-setting philosophies.

# 4. Modern Sporting Disciplines in France

# Parcours de Chasse (PC)

The flagship discipline of French sporting.  
Key elements include:

* **plateaux battue**
* **midi / mini** clays
* **relief-based trajectories**
* long natural courses across terrain
* tournaments from 100 to 200 targets

PC is considered the **highest artistic expression** of French clay shooting.

# Compak Sporting (CS)

A modern, fast, dynamic format:

* five shooting posts inside a **cage**
* confined shooting sector
* **doublettes simultanées** and **doublettes en rafale**
* fast rhythm and intense focus

French Compak fields are often picturesque: lined with trees, stone walls, or vineyard edges.

# 5. The Competition Scene: France as a Sporting Powerhouse

France hosts one of the busiest competition calendars in Europe.

Main events include:

* **Grand Prix de France**
* **French Sporting Championships**
* **French Compak Sporting Championships**
* FITASC events and regional tournaments

French shooters are consistently visible at international podiums, particularly in **Parcours de Chasse** and **Compak Sporting**.

# 6. The French Shooting Technique: A Culture of Precision

French shooters pay exceptional attention to technique:

* **épaulement** — clean shouldering
* **ligne de mire** — sight line
* **avance** — lead
* **swing fluide** — fluid barrel movement
* avoiding **arrêt du swing** — stopping the swing

# A widely repeated saying among French coaches:

>

# 7. The Soul of French Sporting: Nature, Style, and Precision

Modern French sporting culture is built on:

* respect for tradition
* love for natural terrain
* passion for well-designed trajectories
* elite technique from experienced masters
* warm, social shooting-ground communities

Sporting in France is **not only a sport** — it is a lifestyle.

>

# Conclusion

The culture of sporting in modern France blends history with modernity, nature with technique, and sport with aesthetics.  
France remains a world leader in **Parcours de Chasse**, **Compak Sporting**, and **tir aux plateaux**, with shooting grounds that are admired for their beauty, challenge, and tradition.

Its **ball-trap** culture continues to inspire shooters around the world — and define what sporting can be at its highest level.",1,1763365986.0,Vombat07,0,1.0,False

I'm a Londoner travelling in Australia for a few months. 

I thought I would understand Australian coffee culture as it's so deeply absorbed into London life - the flat white and the long black imported and now a UK-wide phenomenon.

But I'm actually just a bit confused by the options here. Or I'm just not sure what to ask for.

In the UK a long black is a stronger (less diluted) Americano - flat white a more concentrated Latte (slightly more complicated than that of course - having to do with the quality of the foam).

Here - a long black seems to be the same as an Americano in most places... It seems the choice in most places is black or white - and I'm generally having to ask how many shots each has to work out how strong the resulting coffee is going to be. Can someone help me decode the system?

FWIW: My general rule in coffee places is to only ask for a flat white in a place where I'm fairly sure of the skill of the barista - and to get the equivalent of a long black/short Americano anywhere else and add milk manually.",5,1763365647.0,AskAnAustralian,26,0.86,False

Anybody know a place that has a decent version of something like that already on their menu? Obviously, I could go somewhere and explain it, but I'd prefer if they already had experience. And me not being the weird guy asking for something off-menu. ;)",5,1763365429.0,canberra,13,0.63,False

As a woman in her 30s, in the area I live I’ve seen this niche for people wanting to “do” things. It’s not just go for a coffee, it’s paint and coffee, it’s not just drink a pint, it watch a classic film and have a pint. 

I dont want to go into to much details about my plans - however it would involve collaborating with other local businesses. 

The best way I can describe it, there has been a growing trend for local cafes to host weekly run clubs, meet at cafe get coffee run, get breakfast. My idea is similar to this, but the focus would be on a creative outlet. 

My first thought was making an Instagram page and reaching out to local businesses, seeing their interests and then setting stuff up via eventbrite etc. I see similar businesses post events they’ve held and I just don’t understand how to start??

I work full time, have never had my own business - feel a bit silly but I have no idea how to appear professional 😅

I am based in the UK. If that makes a difference. 

My main targets would be cafes and brunch spots. Maybe pubs too.

1oza9it,https://www.reddit.com/r/ContradictionisFuel/comments/1oza9it/the_contradictoryinternalstates_hypothesis_why/,The contradictory-internal-states hypothesis: why you might work more like a badly-calibrated quantum computer than a rational agent,"Sometimes I suspect decision-theory models assume humans operate with one stable internal logic — which is adorable, in the same way it’s adorable to believe your cat respects you.

Consider the alternative: humans don’t resolve internal contradictions.
They simply stack them, the way someone with too many books starts using the dining table as auxiliary shelving.

Anecdotal evidence (i.e., being alive) suggests people simultaneously carry:

- belief A and not-A,

- incompatible intentions,

- parallel narratives that never meet,

...and still manage to wake up at 7am, pay bills and remember to buy coffee.


This feels less like classical logic and more like a kind of domestic paraconsistency, where contradictions coexist because nobody has the computational budget for a full epistemic defragmentation.

The question then isn’t “why are we incoherent?” but:
what if this structured incoherence is the native architecture?

This creates several entertaining possibilities:

1. Internal contradictions might be efficient features,
like emotional multitasking but without the TED-talk optimism.


2. “Decisions” may simply be whichever internal state won the five-second election.
A sort of low-turnout epistemic democracy.


3. Simulations with single-logic agents are modeling imaginary rational aliens.
Humans might be more realistic if they had multiple logics active and a pragmatic, improvisational switching heuristic.


4. Computational systems inspired by this might better mimic human subtleties,
especially the very human ones like “planning to sleep at 11pm and opening 17 Wikipedia tabs at 2am.”



So my question is:
is there any good formalization for a cognitive architecture with persistent contradictions and pragmatic mode-switching?

Thinking of something between:

- hierarchical Bayesian models,

- paraconsistent logics,

- multi-state phenomenological machines,

...or some obscure Soviet paper from the 70s that explained everything and nobody translated.

1oza9da,https://www.reddit.com/r/BetaReaders/comments/1oza9da/complete1530literary_fictionthe_new_sensation/,[Complete][1530][literary fiction]The New Sensation,"I just finished this about ten minuets ago and would like my writing style and story crafting critiqued.

*The New Sensation*

The Chatroussats had been married for thirty years, happily if rather ordinary in appearance with no great dramas or incidences to speak of. They had no children and so were utterly devoted to one another, nor did they ever travel outside of Paris, having only done so once when they were married in the quaint church at Pontoise. 

One day Mr. Chatroussat said to his wife, almost impromptu:

“Minnie, dear Suppose we were to go somewhere this weekend?”

“Where to?” his wife asked in response to such an unprecedented question.

“Anywhere that is open and warm, where there is greenery and sights we don't see living here in Paris. It is spring and I am tired of seeing the same paved streets and garish buildings around me.”

“This is all so sudden, Geoffrey. Perhaps we should wait and pick something more suitable and inexpensive.”

“Meh,” he shrugged his shoulders, “why wait? Perhaps we should even visit Pontoise to see how much it has changed since we were there.""

""That would be delightful if that is what you wish.""

""Then it's settled. I shall make arrangements and we shall leave on Saturday.""

***

By a single road did they arrive at the hermitage, with its rolling green hills and knolls, and houses of stone set around them like flowers in a bouquet. It seemed that little had changed and Minuxet even pointed out that she recognized the same notch in a stonewall, but Mr. Chatroussat appeared too distracted by inner thoughts to have noticed.

“Just look, Geoffrey. Right there. What a melancholy thing to see now that all this time has passed.”

“It is. Very.”

She said no more about it.

“Shall we go up to the church?” he asked.

“Yes. Perhaps the vicar is still here.”

They went passed the cottage huts and into the yard of the church itself, seeing the steeple just as it had been so long ago. “To think it was through those very doors we emerged together and now seeing them again as we are,” Minuxet said affectionately to her husband.

“Indeed,” was all he said.

They saw a groundskeeper busy at clearing away weeds from the garden bed.

“Excuse me my good man,” Mr. Chatroussat called. The groundskeeper turned up from his work.

“Aye, what may I do for you two?” he asked. He had full, ruddy cheeks and a moustache and wore a workman’s cap, but what drew both Mr. and Mrs. Chatroussat’s eye was his wooden hand.

“We only wanted to know if abbe Lecroix is still practicing.”

“He retired a few years ago and moved to Montmartre. I miss him dearly.”

“And who are you?”

“Me, sir? Jacob.”

“Just Jacob?”

“Aye.”

Mr. Chatroussat did not say anything at this. Mrs. Chaatroussat, whose eyes had not departed from the man’s wooden hand, caught the attention of the groundskeeper who gave a nonchalant laugh.

“You’ll have to excuse this, my good woman. I know it makes some uncomfortable.”

“I am sorry,” Minuxet said, her cheeks glowing red with embarrassment, but the groundskeeper shook his head.

“Never mind, madame. It is alright. Yes.”

“How did you come by to have it?” Mr. Chatroussat asked.

“Fool that I went out to mend a cart on my own only to have its axle fall on my hand, crushing it through to the bone. The doctor prescribed cutting it off, so he did so and replaced it with this.”

“How horrible!” Minuxet exclaimed.

“Is it? I’ve got so accustomed to it now, though sometimes I can almost feel my old hand in it and times are that, leaning against something, I can sense it through it. It is fantastical surely. Crazy talk. But it is true”

“It is no different than wearing spectacles or a hat,” Mr. Chatroussat said. “I have heard of similar phenomenon for those who must walk added by canes. The nerves do not sense absence and will take on a perceived object as their extenuating appendage. Remarkable to have this confirmed.”

“If you say so,” the groundskeeper shrugged.

Minuxet’s focus had shifted from the hand to his face and his features. She could not pick up on it, but their was a familiarity to them, as if she had met this man before.

“Would the two of you care to join me for lunch?” he asked.

“We would love to,” Mr. Chatroussat said, but Minuxet shook her head.

“You two may go on. I’ve had something come over me and I am not hungry.”

“Are you alright, dear?”

“Yes. The ride out must have had a spell on me. I wish to walk around and see Pontoise. I will eat when we are back in Paris.”

“Very well, then.” He turned to the groundskeeper, and the two of them entered his cabin leaving Minuxet alone.

She went off into the courtyard, by a fencing of iron that partitioned the neighboring houses of the hermitage. She could not recall when last she had seen so much grass and she kneeled down to feel it with her hand, and doing so that peculiar inner disquiet came to her again. What was it, she thought? Why had that man seemed to resemble a forgotten memory? Certainly she had never once seen him, had never ventured out here in  thirty years.

She wandered down the dirt path hoping that ignoring it it would go away on its own, but it did not. She then thought what her husband and that fellow had been discussing. Perhaps it was a confusion for someone else that was upsetting her and there was nothing more to it? Yes, that is it! she said to herself.

She passed by a man who was chopping wood upon a stump while a young boy would replace them with a fresh block.

“Excuse me, sir,” she called out from the road and leaned on the gate to the man’s yard. “Can you tell me about the man who lives by the church? The groundskeeper?”

“Him? He lost his hand about two years ago.”

“Not that, no. Who were his parents?”

“He had no parents. Just his mother, who was a washer woman for the church.”

“Whom was his father?”

“No one knows. She said he was from Paris and was here getting married. She defended herself by saying he had forced himself onto her. None believed her and many took to calling her a hussy and would have nothing to do with her. After he was born she killed herself. The former rector had pity and took in the child himself. All of this was a long time ago.”

She looked at the boy and saw the resemblance he had to him. “Is that little one your son?”

“Yes, madame.”

“Thank you for your trouble. Adieu.”

She took her leave of the man who watched her go, perplexed.

Minuxet went off the path and into the field that slopped down into a valley, walking down it where at the bottom was a clump of trees where she could be hidden to herself while her thoughts were processing what she had been told and though she had not yet admitted it to herself she knew it in her heart to be true. The groundskeeper and her husband were son and father.

She rested on a fallen tree. A chipmunk came up to her, slowly and cautiously, extending itself to smell at the tip of her shoe before scurry away. The nature around her had seemed transformed in some way. Then a new thought, fresh in its malicious intent, came to her:

“Does he know?”

Was that the reason he had so earnestly wanted to visit here? To see the son he had abandoned? Or was this all just a perverse cosmic prank on her? What is real and what is mere inference? Who can know? It could still be coincidence, the mother could had been lying, or talking about another; the resemblance, indefinite. But what is worse than truth or doubt? She could never be certain of anything hereafter and that was the most terrible of all.

She got to her feet and brushed herself off. She started out back to the church. When she returned to it, her husband and the groundskeeper were still in his cabin. She found them talking over cups of coffee.

“Minnie, dear,” her husband said, “where did you go off to?”

“Nowhere. I walked around the hermitage and circled back.”

“Are you well now?”

“Yes.”

“I am pleased to hear it. You must try this coffee. Jacob makes a delightful brew. How did you say you did it?”

“I add cinnamon in with the beans. It was how the old abbe liked his and I have taken to it.”

“Geoffrey, dear,” Minuxet said, “I think I would like to go home now.”

“So soon? Are you sure you are feeling well? Perhaps a doctor could have a look.”

“It is nothing, but I would like to leave.”

“I am sorry, Jacob, but we must be off. It was a pleasant meeting with you.”

It bothered me, so I checked his account and saw a group chat where another co-worker was teasing him about her. When I asked the co-worker, he said it was just a joke because he saw them go out for lunch. My boyfriend also said she was just a co-worker.

Later on, I met her when I joined his team for a movie. She didn’t talk to me at all. During dinner, she even switched seats so she ended up beside my boyfriend. While my boyfriend was asking me what I wanted to eat, she kept inserting herself and asking him about his order. She also took off her jacket and had a tube top underneath.

When we were going home, my boyfriend and I offered to drop everyone off at their bus stops. The girl kept telling everyone not to accept because my boyfriend “must be tired.”

I’ve met them a couple more times since then, and another co-worker even asked me why this girl and the guys close to my boyfriend don’t talk to me. She said it’s strange because they’re close to their boss, and I’m his girlfriend. She also mentioned that the girl pretends she’s not close to my boyfriend in front of me, but is always looking for him at work.

After I finally expressed my feelings to my boyfriend, he stopped going out with them unless I’m there. But now it’s awkward because his close friends and that girl ignore me whenever we’re together. The good thing is the other female co-workers actually vibe with me and treat me normally.

Paulina swore it was Isaac who leaked them. She brought her people, shattered every bone in Isaac's body, and tossed him into the ocean to feed the sharks.

Nina filed a lawsuit against the tyrannical Paulina, but it was immediately crushed—because the man pulling strings behind the scenes was Lloyd Foust, the most powerful kingpin in the city.

He was also Nina's husband of six years, a man who had once loved her.

""Baby, your brother bullied Paulie first. He got what he deserved. Stop making trouble,"" Lloyd said, siding with Paulina. He believed her story. But Nina didn't.

Dressed in mourning black, Nina clung to Isaac's photo and livestreamed for 99 days straight, stirring up public outrage. With the weight of public opinion behind her, she petitioned the court to release the yacht's surveillance footage from that day.

Lloyd locked her in the basement for seven days straight, making sure she missed the court date.

When she was finally freed, Nina immediately prepared to file her third appeal.

That night, Lloyd dug up Isaac's ashes, set them over the fire, and threatened Nina to sign the settlement.

He shoved her toward the flames, the urn teetering on its rack.

""Baby, you've pushed this slander against Paulie too far. Keep going, and your brother won't have anything left.""

He tossed his expensive cigar carelessly to the floor, his long fingers tracing her chin with a gentle touch. His eyes were soft.

But every word he spoke cut like a knife, leaving her bleeding inside.

Nina stared at him, refusing to look away. ""Why? Have you forgotten Isaac saved your life?""

During a disastrous international deal, Isaac had shielded Lloyd from 50 stab wounds, then spent three years in a coma.

Lloyd spent millions tracking down the culprit, tearing him apart piece by piece. He once said that anyone who hurt Isaac was his enemy.

But now, Lloyd's patience had run out. ""Paulie saved my life. Anyone who messes with her is my enemy—including you and Isaac.""

Nina bit her lip so hard she nearly drew blood. She couldn't understand how things had come to this.

This was a man who had once loved her with everything he had.

Six years ago, if not for Lloyd, she would have died in a remote mountain town.

Her parents died when she was born, and Isaac raised her on his own.

To make ends meet, Isaac dropped out of school and moved to New York for work. Thanks to his imposing figure, he was hired as Lloyd's bodyguard.

After taking the knife for Lloyd, Isaac begged him to bring his little sister to New York.

So Lloyd led a team deep into the impoverished mountains and met 18-year-old Nina—a girl so pure and beautiful that, for the first time, the hardened man felt his heart skip a beat.

He fell for her instantly and confessed his feelings right there.

Nina, shy and timid, didn't dare respond.

Lloyd decided to bring her back and let their relationship grow. But then, the townsfolk came with knives to stop him.

Women were scarce in the mountains. Nina's beauty had been coveted for years. They planned to use her in turns, then sell her for a hefty price.

The two groups fought for a whole day. Lloyd took 30 knife wounds but managed to rescue Nina, barely alive and still comforting her, ""It's okay, sweetheart. You're safe now.""

That one gentle word was all it took—Nina was lost to him.

After Lloyd recovered, they got married.

He taught her how to use knives and guns, how to survive, how to have dignity and self-respect—slowly transforming her from a timid girl into a confident woman.

Lloyd gave her the best of everything. When it came to Nina, he was always there.

Nina loved New York. She thought she'd always be happy with Lloyd and Isaac.

But dreams are fragile.

Lloyd's cold voice shattered her memories from above. ""Stop stalling. Your brother doesn't have time.""

Still, Nina clung to hope, wondering if Lloyd had any love left for her. ""If I don't sign, will you really burn Isaac's ashes?""

Lloyd didn't bother with a real answer, simply clicking his tongue in arrogant impatience.

""Baby, Paulie took a fatal knife for me. I promised her a year by my side. Didn't I tell you? She's my bottom line. Everyone has to accommodate her. Why do you insist on going against her?""

Paulina and Lloyd had grown up together—she'd chased after him for ten years. But he'd married Nina in a whirlwind, and Paulina hated Nina for it, having her kidnapped and tortured for ten days straight.

Nina would never forget the whips that lashed her skin, the toothpicks shoved under her nails, the steel needles piercing her flesh... Paulina even took away her first child.

For that, Lloyd broke ties with the Larsen family, using every trick to send Paulina to prison for three years.

Nina thought Paulina would vanish like the nightmares from the mountain town. But a year ago, Lloyd brought her back, declaring before all his men, ""For the next year, Paulie will also be your boss. Her power will surpass everyone's.""

He'd forgotten everything Paulina had done to Nina.

Nina sobbed, demanding answers, but Lloyd didn't care. ""Loyalty is everything in our world. I'm just repaying a debt, Baby. She won't affect you.""

Nina fell silent, knowing she had no right to refuse. She could only wait for Lloyd's debt to be repaid. Instead, she received news of Isaac's death.

She swallowed her bitterness. ""I'll sign. Just let Isaac go.""

Lloyd patted her head. ""That's my good girl.""

He picked up the urn, and Nina sighed in relief, reaching out for it.

But in the next instant, Lloyd flicked his wrist—the ashes spilled into the fire.

""No—!""

Nina screamed in despair, lunging for the flames, but the bodyguards held her back.

Lloyd looked down at her, cold and merciless. ""Baby, you crossed my line. This is your punishment.""

Nina glared at him through tear-filled eyes, her heart trembling with pain. ""Lloyd, I'm leaving you...""

Just now, whatever love she had left for him burned away with Isaac's ashes.

In that moment, Lloyd's smile vanished, his expression turning terrifyingly cold. ""You think you can leave? There's a tracker implanted in you. Even if you run to the ends of the earth, I'll find you.

""So just be good, won't you?""

Nina shivered to her core.

He'd implanted the tracker to protect her from enemies. But now, it had become his weapon to hurt her without restraint.

After Lloyd left, Nina sat by the fire all night, clutching the ashes. At dawn, she dialed the only number Lloyd couldn't monitor.

""Mr. Granholm, can you help me fake my death and escape?""

Leaving Lloyd alive was impossible. Faking her death and starting over was her only chance.

Marco Granholm didn't hesitate. ""Isaac did more for me than anyone. I'd risk my life to get you out!""

Once Lloyd's right-hand man, Marco had split off for reasons unknown, building his own empire overseas.

With Marco's help, her chances doubled.

""But Mrs. Foust, the tracker inside you is complicated. I'll need a month to make a duplicate.""

As long as she could get away, Nina would wait—not just a month, but a year if she had to.

Chapter 2

Nina set up an empty tomb for Isaac. She bought a bottle of bourbon and picked a few wildflowers by the roadside to place before the grave.

By the time she got home, dusk had settled in.

Suddenly, Paulina's laughter rang out, sharp and unexpected. ""Mr. Foust, easy now, you're hurting me.""

She was wearing a micro-mini slip dress, her chest covered with kiss marks.

Lloyd gripped her chin, about to kiss her, but stopped abruptly when he caught sight of Nina.

Nina didn't spare them a glance, heading straight upstairs.

But Lloyd's cold voice stopped her. ""Freeze! Get over here!""

Nina hesitated for two seconds, then obediently walked over.

Lloyd had run with the underworld long enough to expect absolute obedience. He hated anyone who defied him. Before leaving, Nina didn't want to stir up trouble, so she swallowed her pride and approached him.

But the next moment, Lloyd ordered, ""Apologize to Paulie!""

Nina bit her lip so hard she tasted blood. He was actually asking her to apologize to the woman who killed Isaac.

She couldn't do it.

Lloyd stood, anger flaring, but Paulina tugged his sleeve. ""Enough, Mr. Foust. I don't blame Mrs. Foust. Don't force her.""

He brushed a kiss across Paulina's lips, his voice hoarse. ""Paulie always knows how to behave.""

Then, he pressed her closer, deepening the kiss, his hands wandering under her clothes—utterly indifferent to the humiliation of his own wife standing nearby.

Even though she'd already decided to leave, Nina's heart twisted in pain.

She tried to go upstairs to rest, but the housekeeper blocked her way. ""I'm sorry, Mrs. Foust. Mr. Foust says Ms. Larsen was frightened by your accusations and needs to stay here for a few days. She's chosen the primary bedroom. Please move to the basement for now.""

Nina smiled faintly. It didn't matter anymore.

She didn't care about a bedroom. She didn't even want Lloyd anymore.

In the middle of the night, Nina was jolted awake by a scream.

She recognized it instantly—it was her dog. ""Teddy!"" Nina burst out of her room, frantic.

In the living room, Paulina was directing her friends, who were slashing at Teddy with knives.

The malice in Paulina's eyes brought back every nightmare Nina had ever had.

Just because Lloyd had once complimented Nina's piano playing, Paulina had taken a knife and sliced her fingers—one thousand times—ensuring she could never play again.

Nina trembled uncontrollably, trauma flooding back. Teddy let out another agonized yelp.

Forcing herself past her fear of Paulina, Nina rushed forward, shoving Paulina aside and gathering Teddy's bleeding body into her arms.

Paulina hadn't expected Nina to fight back. Her pretty face twisted with rage. ""You bitch! How dare you touch me! Teach her a lesson!""

Bang!

Someone grabbed a bottle and smashed it over Nina's head.

Blood poured down her face, but she clung to Teddy, using her body as a shield.

The bottle came down a second time, harder than before.

Nina's vision blurred, but she bit her tongue, refusing to collapse.

A third blow was about to fall when a cold male voice rang out from the doorway. ""Who dares hit my wife? Are you out of your mind?""

Lloyd strode in, gun raised, aiming at the attacker's head.

Paulina instantly threw herself in front of him, sobbing theatrically. ""Mr. Foust, Mrs. Foust set her dog on me. My friends were just standing up for me. It's all my fault—I shouldn't have stayed here and upset Mrs. Foust. I'll leave...""

She took a step, but Lloyd yanked her back.

""You're my savior. No one has the right to send you away. Paulie, I'll make sure you get justice for this.""

Lloyd walked over, his gaze icy as he stared at Teddy.

In that moment, Nina understood what he was about to do. She shook her head desperately. ""Loy, Teddy didn't bite her! Check the security cameras—there's proof!""

But Lloyd ignored her, his lips curling into a cruel smile. ""Baby, mistakes have consequences.""

He snatched Teddy from her arms and slammed it to the ground.

Teddy whimpered, coughed up a mouthful of blood, and died.

""No!"" Nina screamed, crawling over to cradle Teddy's lifeless body, her eyes blazing at Lloyd. ""You killed our child! I hate you!""

Years ago, after Paulina had caused her to lose her first child, Nina had fallen into depression. Lloyd had bought Teddy to cheer her up, and with Teddy's companionship, she'd slowly healed.

Lloyd had once said, ""Teddy is our child. I'll love him forever.""

But now, just because of Paulina's accusation, he'd killed the dog they'd raised for six years, without even checking the facts.

With trembling hands, Nina closed Teddy's eyes.

The moment Teddy died, her heart for Lloyd died too.

Chapter 3

Nina cried until she was completely spent, her sobs wracking her body. For a moment, Lloyd felt a pang of guilt and stepped forward instinctively to help her up. ""Come on, sweetheart, let me get you cleaned up.""

But she pushed him away, her face expressionless.

Irritation flickered across Lloyd's face; he wanted to say more.

Nina didn't even glance at him. She cradled Teddy's lifeless body and walked outside, heading straight for the sycamore—Teddy's favorite spot to lounge in the shade.

With her bare hands, Nina dug a shallow grave, gently placed her dog inside, and covered it with earth.

""Teddy, rest easy...""

She pulled out a lighter and tossed it onto the wooden doghouse.

Lloyd had built that doghouse himself six years ago, sanding and polishing every plank, working on it for ten months before it was finished.

Now, flames consumed it, turning it to ash—just like the dream she'd held onto for six years.

Next, Nina grabbed an axe and swung at the sycamore. Lloyd had planted it for her, saying sycamores symbolized longevity, a love that would never fade.

But now, his love felt like nothing but a cruel joke.

With the final blow, the sycamore split and crashed to the ground. In that moment, Nina severed the last of her attachment.

""Lloyd, from this day forward, I don't love you anymore!"" she said inwardly.

All it took was Paulina claiming she'd been frightened, and Lloyd canceled multimillion-dollar deals just to stay home with her. He tied her apron, held her on his lap, spoon-fed her at every meal, and gently wiped her mouth afterward—doing everything he used to do for Nina.

For seven days, their shameless flirtation was on full display, but Nina didn't care. She spent every day kneeling on a prayer mat, saying prayers so Teddy's soul could find peace.

On the seventh day after Teddy's death, Nina finished her final prayer. The basement door opened.

Lloyd walked in with Paulina in his arms. His voice was cool. ""Take off your wedding ring and give it to Paulie.""

Nina froze, staring at him in disbelief. ""Lloyd, do you even know what you're saying?""

He barely blinked. ""Paulie saved my life. If she wants something and I can afford it, she'll have it.""

Nina clenched her fists so tight her nails dug into her palms.

How absurd. The diamond ring on her finger was custom-made by Lloyd—one of a kind. When he slipped it on her hand, he'd smiled indulgently, ""Baby, you're my one and only. As long as we love each other, you're never allowed to take it off.""

Nina had obeyed. For six years, even when her finger was injured and bandaged, she never removed it.

She thought their love would last forever. She thought she'd never have to take it off.

But now, to please another woman, he was forcing her to give up her wedding ring.

Suddenly, Nina laughed—a bitter, hollow sound. She laughed at how short Lloyd's promises were, at how quickly his love had vanished.

""Fine,"" she said quietly.

Lloyd was taken aback, not expecting her to agree so easily. His throat tightened, and he tried to stop her. ""Baby, wait—""

But Nina slipped off the ring and tossed it to the floor. ""If she wants secondhand goods, let her pick it up herself.""

Without another word, she turned and walked away.

She hadn't made it to the front gates of the Foust's residence before the guards forced her to her knees.

Lloyd's voice rang out behind her, cold and menacing. ""I've spoiled you too much, let you get away with everything, and now you dare defy me right in front of my face.""

The butler handed him a wooden rod covered in spikes—the kind used to punish disobedient staff. Lloyd raised the stick, his tone icy. ""Apologize! I told you, everyone must respect Paulie. You're no exception.""

Nina's body shook. She couldn't believe Lloyd's favoritism for Paulina had gone this far. Tears burned in her eyes as she stared him down, stubborn to the end. ""I did nothing wrong. I won't apologize.""

Paulina clung to Lloyd's arm, sobbing. ""Mr. Foust, Mrs. Foust is just upset about how well you treat me. She didn't mean to go against you. Please don't be angry with her.""

Her words only made things worse—Lloyd hated being defied.

Sure enough, the next moment, the rod—thick as a man's arm—came crashing down on Nina's back.

The first blow made her cough up blood. Dazed, she remembered the day she first met Lloyd, when he picked wildflowers from the roadside and knelt before her. ""Little girl, I like you. Be my girlfriend.""

Back then, his eyes were so sincere.

The second blow sent darkness swimming before her eyes, pain nearly making her faint. She remembered five years ago, when an enemy had kidnapped her and threatened Lloyd, demanding he break his own legs. He didn't hesitate—he swung the knife at himself.

He'd loved her so fiercely.

The third blow finally made her lose consciousness. As she slipped into oblivion, she thought she saw Lloyd at their wedding, tears of joy streaming down his face as he swore, ""Baby, I'll treat you well for the rest of my life.""

But he'd broken his promise. He'd broken every promise.

For another woman, he beat her until she was battered and broken.

Nina lay in bed for seven days before she could even stand.

The first time she managed to walk into the yard, Paulina strode over, her face smug with triumph. She flaunted the wedding ring on her finger. ""Now both Mr. Foust's body and heart belong to me.""

Nina's face was unreadable. ""If you want him, he's yours.""

Paulina was startled, then slapped Nina hard across the face. ""You bitch! Mr. Foust was always mine. You seduced him away from me.""

Nina's calm only made Paulina angrier. She raised her hand again, but caught sight of Lloyd approaching. Quickly, she snatched off the ring and flung it into the water.

Then she threw herself into Lloyd's arms, sobbing. ""Mr. Foust, Mrs. Foust bullied me. She threw away the ring you gave me. She said I'm not worthy...""

Instantly, Lloyd's eyes blazed with anger. ""Nina, do you have anything to say for yourself?""

Nina met his gaze, her voice flat. ""Would you believe me if I did?""

Lloyd's lips curled into a cold smile. ""No. I only believe Paulie.""

Nina was shoved into the water to retrieve the ring.

Darkness and cold swallowed her whole.

As a child, the townsfolk used to dunk her in water for fun, leaving her with a crippling fear of it. Lloyd had drained every pond at the villa for her—until last year, when Paulina wanted to grow lotus flowers, and he relented.

Now, Nina was on the verge of drowning. She fought desperately to reach the surface, finally dragging herself onto the bank—only to hear Paulina's cries. ""Mr. Foust, Mrs. Foust doesn't seem willing...""

""She doesn't get a choice."" Lloyd's voice was merciless. He ordered the guards to beat her with bamboo poles whenever she surfaced.

Every time Nina tried to rise, she was struck back down.

The wounds on her back split open again, the icy water numbing her body.

But none of it hurt as much as her shattered heart.

""Lloyd, I regret ever loving you. I regret it so much.""

Chapter 4

Nina was unconscious for three days before she finally woke up.

The housekeeper tending to her breathed a sigh of relief. ""Mrs. Foust, you're awake at last. After you sank to the bottom three days ago, Mr. Foust was terrified. He held a gun to the doctor's head and swore that if you couldn't be saved, we'd all die with you.""

The housekeeper went on about how worried Lloyd had been, how much he loved her.

But Nina would never believe it again.

If he truly loved her, he wouldn't have brought that bully home for everyone to see.

If he truly loved her, he wouldn't have killed the dog that had been her emotional lifeline.

If he truly loved her, he wouldn't have forced her, knowing her fear of water, to be beaten into it over and over.

""Lloyd, stop lying to me!"" Nina thought bitterly.

Once the housekeeper was gone, Nina began writing her ""farewell letter.""

""Lloyd, by the time you open this letter, I'll probably be gone...""

She and Lloyd had promised to write each other love letters every year and open them together on their anniversary.

They'd kept that tradition for five years. But ever since Paulina saved his life last year, Lloyd hadn't written a single letter. Nina had written many letters, and he hadn't read a single one.

Nina placed her finished ""farewell letter"" in a box, then began burning the love letters, one by one.

By the time she reached the last letter, Lloyd burst into the room, his pupils contracting as he lunged for the fire, but he was too late.

""Baby, why are you burning the love letters?""

Looking at the blisters forming on his hand, Nina spoke calmly. ""They're old. I wrote new ones.""

Lloyd let out a breath, pushing down the unease in his chest, and reached for the box.

Nina stopped him. ""Wait for our anniversary.""

The anniversary was just three days after she planned to fake her death.

Their seventh wedding anniversary—Nina was going to give Lloyd a gift he'd never forget.

She'd heard that Isaac's spent bullet casing would be up for auction tonight. Taking her black card, she hurried to the event. As soon as she sat down, Lloyd arrived with Paulina and took the seats beside her.

He brushed Paulina's hair from her face, his gentle gaze no different than the way he used to look at Nina.

Their lips drew closer, about to meet in a kiss, when Nina cleared her throat. Lloyd froze, finally realizing Nina was sitting right there.

His expression flickered awkwardly, and he instinctively reached for her hand, but Nina pulled away.

Now, Lloyd's heart and mind were filled with Paulina—he barely saw Nina at all.

The first auction item was Isaac's bullet casing.

Paulina shot Nina a provocative look and cooed to Lloyd, ""Mr. Foust, I want it.""

Lloyd didn't hesitate. ""Of course, Paulie. Whatever you want, I'll buy it for you.""

Nina dug her nails into her palm, fighting back a surge of emotion, and pleaded softly, ""Loy, that's my brother's keepsake. Could you please—""

Before she could finish, Lloyd cut her off coldly. ""Baby, you're acting up again. How many times do I have to tell you? Paulie saved my life. I'm going to fulfill all her wishes this year.""

""But..."" Nina tried again.

His tone grew impatient. ""Enough. Don't make a scene.""

The auctioneer began the bidding. Lloyd immediately raised his paddle. ""One million dollars.""

Nina's palm was almost raw from gripping so tightly, her eyes blazing with determination. In the next instant, she stood and made a bold gesture—raising her hand high to signal the ultimate bid.

At this auction, that gesture meant she was going all in, no matter the cost. She would take the item, whatever the price, with no limit.

Paulina's face paled. ""Mr. Foust, I really want that...""

Lloyd shot Nina an annoyed look. ""Don't talk big, Nina. If you can't pay, don't embarrass yourself.""

Nina ignored him, stepping onto the stage and swiping her card for the transaction.

Lloyd sat up straighter, suddenly remembering he'd once given her an unlimited black card.

His eyes narrowed dangerously.

Just after Nina finished her ritual for Isaac, a notification popped up on her phone.

""Mr. Foust's little wife's 999 private photos will be auctioned as the grand finale tonight!""

Nina's blood ran cold.

Only Lloyd had those photos.

Was this his revenge?

She rushed back to the auction hall, and the moment she looked up, she saw Lloyd sitting on the platform, casually smiling down at her.

""Mr. Foust, you're really something. You once gouged out a man's eyes for looking at Mrs. Foust, but tonight you're putting her private photos up for everyone to see.""

Lloyd's smile was cruel. ""She made Paulie cry. This is her punishment.""

It felt as if a steel blade was twisting in Nina's heart, the pain nearly suffocating her.

Just because of Paulina, he was willing to let every man see her most private photos.

He'd always been possessive—if any man so much as looked at her, he'd lock her away, claiming her for himself, whispering again and again, ""Baby, you're mine. Your body is only for me.""

Nina bit her lip hard, forcing her tears back. Numb, she walked inside and, under the men's leering stares, pressed the auction button again and again.

With every press, her heart grew colder—until, at last, the part of her that had once loved Lloyd died completely.

She walked up to him, her face expressionless. ""Are you satisfied now?""

Lloyd glanced at her pale face and gave a mocking smile. ""Sorry, not yet.""

Nina soon understood what he meant.

He had frozen her card.

She couldn't pay, and her private photos would be released for anyone to see.

In disbelief, she looked at Lloyd, her eyes full of despair. He just sneered, ""Baby, if you don't learn the consequences of defying me, how will you ever behave?""

Nina's heart was dead, and she closed her eyes in agony.

She thought it was finally over, but it was only the beginning.

Lloyd even posted every shameful detail of her past in the poor mountain town online!

Chapter 5

Nina grew up in a remote mountain town infamous for human trafficking. She and her mother had been abducted there together. Nina witnessed, with her own eyes, her mother being humiliated to death by the townsfolk.

After coming to New York, Lloyd had hired countless therapists to help her heal.

It took six years for Nina to finally crawl out of the shadows of her past—only for her own husband, the man who claimed to love her, to rip open her deepest wounds and put them on display for the world to see.

Nina's PTSD hit her like a freight train. She collapsed to her knees, gasping for air, her entire body shaking uncontrollably.

The gossip about her grew uglier by the minute.

""Ms. Powell actually grew up in a place like that? She's probably been passed around by every man in town. No wonder she got Mr. Foust hooked. She must be incredible in bed.""

Some people even threw money at her, asking how much she charged for a night.

Lloyd saw it all. He glanced at her with icy indifference, then walked away hand in hand with Paulina, letting the crowd humiliate Nina without once looking back.

Nina didn't even know how she made it home. She collapsed on her bed, her eyes blank and lifeless.

Her depression gnawed at her body, and for a moment, she wished she could just end it all.

Her phone rang several times before she finally answered. ""Mrs. Foust, your fake corpse is ready. Once the tracker is finished in two weeks, you can leave.""

Marco's assurance helped steady her nerves.

Staring at the ceiling, Nina's resolve hardened.

No. She was going to survive this.

She wouldn't die for a scumbag like Lloyd—he wasn't worth it.

The butler informed her that there was a charity gala she had to attend.

The moment she arrived, a man approached her, sleazily and boldly. ""Mrs. Foust, I've seen all your private photos. Ms. Larsen said you're cheap—20 dollars for the whole night.""

Nina trembled. ""Get lost!""

But the man grabbed her, dragging her toward the stairwell.

Nina struggled, her clothes torn by rough hands. Just then, Lloyd's furious voice cut through the chaos. ""What the hell are you doing?""

The man dropped to his knees. ""Mr. Foust, your wife seduced me! She said if you can have Ms. Larsen, she should be allowed to have men too. She begged me to sleep with her, just to piss you off.

""Mr. Foust, I swear I'm not lying. Mrs. Foust has been with plenty of men before me—I'm her 100th.""

Paulina lowered her eyes, a flash of malice passing through them—Nina caught it in an instant. Suddenly, she understood, this was Paulina's trap.

""Loy, it's Paulina! She set me up!""

But before she could say another word, a sharp pain shot through her belly—Lloyd had kicked her down the stairs. ""Nina, you're getting bolder by the day.""

He was smiling, but his eyes were murderously cold.

Paulina gasped, ""Mr. Foust, Mrs. Foust is bleeding! What if she's pregnant with someone else's child?""

Lloyd's smile twisted, his jaw clenched so tight it looked like he might snap his own teeth.

Nina was dragged back home.

The doctor examined her, hands trembling. After half an hour, he barely managed to speak. ""Mr. Foust, Mrs. Foust is indeed pregnant.""

Lloyd kicked the coffee table aside, grabbed Nina by the chin, and snarled, ""Whose is it?""

Nina was just as shocked. Facing Lloyd's predatory stare, she knew she had to be clear. ""It's yours. It must be from that night in the garden, three months ago.""

No sooner had she spoken than his hand crashed across her face.

The blow was brutal—her lip split and bled.

He seized her by the throat. ""Still lying to me? After we slept together, I made sure you got birth control shots. How could you possibly be pregnant with my child?""

What?

Nina was stunned.

Paulina spoke up. ""Mr. Foust promised me that while he was with me, he wouldn't let you get pregnant. So, Mrs. Foust, your baby can't possibly be his.""

Nina felt all the strength drain from her body. ""Lloyd... he actually agreed to something like that for Paulina?

""Lloyd, is this really just gratitude?""

He ordered his men to tie Nina to a wooden bench and began beating her stomach.

The stick landed again and again, the pain so fierce it nearly tore her apart. But Nina stopped fighting.

She knew—no matter what she said, Lloyd would never believe her.

By the 200th blow, her dress was soaked in blood, but she couldn't feel the pain anymore. When your heart dies, nothing else hurts.

Lloyd watched her the whole time. Seeing her hollow expression, he felt an inexplicable ache deep inside.

Suddenly, he shouted, ""Enough! Stop!""

He strode over to Nina.

Just then, Paulina cried out, ""Mr. Foust, I get faint at the sight of blood...""

She promptly collapsed.

Without hesitation, Lloyd scooped her up and rushed out.

As soon as he left, Nina collapsed to the floor, blood gushing from her lower body.

Agony crashed over her, her belly twisting in pain.

She begged the housekeeper to take her to the hospital, but without Lloyd's orders, no one dared help.

Nina bit down hard. No—she couldn't die today. Just two more weeks and she could escape!

She crawled out of the villa, leaving a trail of blood behind.

In the end, it was a stranger who called 911 for her.

""I'm sorry, Ms. Powell. Your uterus is destroyed—we have to remove it. If you'd come even a minute earlier, we could have saved it...""

Nina lay on the operating table, the harsh white lights stinging her eyes.

After a long, long time, she finally smiled.

It didn't matter—she never planned to marry again. Uterus or not, it was all the same.

From now on, she would live for herself.

Chapter 6

One week after Nina was discharged from the hospital, she was surrounded by a group of people in tattered clothing.

""Mrs. Foust, you promised you'd support us for life. Why did you sell the foundation?""

Nina had wanted to help people from disadvantaged backgrounds like herself, so Lloyd had set up a fund for her—the Nini Love Foundation.

She called Lloyd. ""Did you sell the Nini Love Foundation?""

He sounded utterly unconcerned. ""Paulie wanted a dress, and the seller specifically asked for the Nini Love Foundation. Baby, don't be so stingy.""

Nina pressed, ""Do you even remember what the foundation means?""

""It's just a fund, isn't it?"" Lloyd was clearly impatient. ""Only one more week and my year with Paulie is up. I'll buy it back for you then...""

Nina couldn't listen anymore.

She would never forget how, six years ago, Lloyd had solemnly promised her, ""The Nini Love Foundation is our pride and joy, like our child. Even if I go bankrupt, I'll never sell it.""

But now?

He'd killed their dog, then their unborn child, and now, for Paulina, he'd sold their other 'child'—the Nini Love Foundation.

""Lloyd, Lloyd... you're the one who's severed every last tie between us.

""From this moment on, there's nothing left between you and me!"" Nina thought.

Three days later was Nina's birthday. Maybe sensing her mood, Lloyd insisted on throwing her a grand party.

On her birthday, Lloyd arranged a drone show, covered the venue in rose petals, and stacked luxury handbags and designer clothes into mountains...

Nina didn't even glance at any of it.

He wrapped his arms around her waist from behind. ""Baby, stop thinking about that bastard. Cheer up. Once my year with Paulie is over, we'll have a child together.""

Lloyd didn't know—the child he'd killed was his own flesh and blood.

Nina had gotten a paternity test and paid the doctor a hefty sum to send the report to the Foust family after her death.

""Lloyd, if you ever learn the truth, will you regret it?"" she wondered.

Lloyd was about to say something else when a business partner called him away.

He'd barely left when Paulina approached, wine glass in hand.

""Nina, I bribed the doctor to switch out your birth control shots, then got a man to frame you for cheating. I had a whole list of tricks ready, but Mr. Foust believed me so easily. You know what that means? It means you're trash in his eyes!""

Nina's fingers trembled. Just yesterday, Marco had sent her a button camera, which she'd worn today.

Paulina thought she'd struck a nerve and grew even more smug. ""Weren't you always trying to find out what happened to your brother? Let me tell you—the photo scandal was my setup. That day, I broke every bone in his body. Blood covered the deck, his brain spilled out, and he was still calling your name.

""So before I threw him overboard, I told him, I'll be sending you after him soon.""

No sooner had she spoken than Paulina slapped herself, and Lloyd's cold voice sounded from behind.

""Nina, you're bullying Paulie again!""

""I didn't!""

""I saw everything!"" Lloyd ordered his men to hold Nina down, his eyes dangerous. ""Didn't I tell you? She's my bottom line. If you touch her again, I'll pay you back a hundredfold.""

Before Nina could react, the bodyguard's hand was already raised—

Smack!

The first slap landed, burning hot.

Then the second, the third...

Nina struggled desperately, her voice hoarse. ""Lloyd, you're blind and heartless!""

Lloyd was busy tending to Paulina's bruised cheek, his tone icy as he ordered, ""Keep going. Don't stop.""

Smack! Smack! Smack!

The bodyguard's grip was like iron, and Nina couldn't escape, no matter how she tried.

One slap after another rained down, faster than a storm.

Her ears rang, her face felt like it was on fire, but she bit down hard, refusing to make a sound.

When Lloyd finished applying medicine to Paulina's face, he asked casually, ""How many?""

""Ninety-nine.""

Lloyd narrowed his eyes, smiling. ""Let's make it an even hundred.""

The last slap knocked Nina to the floor, where she coughed up a mouthful of blood.

Her cheeks were swollen, her lips split, her face streaked with tears—she looked utterly miserable.

But she was smiling.",1,1763364729.0,NovelLinks,0,1.0,False

1oza2cv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libyan_Expats/comments/1oza2cv/libyan_trends/,Libyan Trends ◇,"The other day I was stuck into some serious traffic around Tripoli's upscale neighbourhood of Ben Ashour; and couldn't help but notice how trends have changed - some for the better and some for the worse.

Let's start off with the worst male trends; and the award goes to those silly pumped up hairstyles.

It starts off with the bottom shaved down to the skin; the middle part is trimmed  and the top is parted into 2 rolls one on each side.

That's just godawful.

It's more of a split pompadour style ( made famous by Elvis Presley, James Dean and other popular figures ) or a Louis XVII wig with a touch of punk rock style - if you prefer

Simply horrendous.

Some variations showcase  extensive use of hair wax / gel to keep the top in the upright position - and that's slightly easier on the eye.

The trend has spread among 10 year olds, all the way to the late 20's crowd.

Most of these guys will be riding beatup  scooters as if they were Harley Davidsons.

One thing is for sure while observing the average Libyan stuck in traffic; they ALL have an over inflated sense of self worth - also known as arrogance.

Most folks were clearly self absorbed into their smartphones; whether it's video calling their wife ( GF ? ) about some drama or posting their latest ""Update"" on social media including pics of traffic, selfies or whatever snacks they were pigging out on from the trendiest coffee shops.

That pretty much somes up Libyans living the dream.

Next up are the female trends; and here I was pleasantly surprised. 

I was literally surrounded by girls from mid 20's to late 30's with curled up lips - using botox, fillers etc.

They all dressed in black abayas with a flock of hair hanging from the forehead and drove mostly KIA sedans or compact SUVs.

Many also wore large sunglasses while others were sporting colored contact lenses, lip gloss and light makeup.

All in all they looked pretty no doubt; but what's behind the facade is yet to be known.

**The Ideal candidate must be:**

strong analytical skill,proactive, detail oriented, manage multiple stuff at the same time and always under tight deadlines and under pressure (we're greedy, have no respect for health, we getting fat bonuses we won't share but you should tag along, don't be a pussy). you should also be the best at interpersonal skills (your manager won't, but anyway) and always bring new ideas we will reject for reasons. Basically, we strongly believe we are entitled to a genius who doesn't talk back.

**Roles:**

Small list of 15 tasks usually two persons should do.

**Qualifications:**

* degree in accounting, law, finance, we're also not desperate so we might consider degrees in 'related fields'.
* 3 years XP in everything corporate administration post qualification.
* must already know how to use a software only we use.

* Another special skill, the last, we promise, it will be an advantage.

* Work from home (as little as we can give you but at least it shows up in our list of perks)
* Employee welfare and fun (compulsory team building, EOY party both on a Saturday. shitty coffee and a broken baby foot)
* Career path with HRDC funded training with shitty participation certificates
* Competitive salary package that is 5k above minimum salary.

We promote diversity and equal opportunity(lol). We value employees haha, its true.

Over the last couple of years I have kept contact minimal, responding to her only when it’s about big news (her news, not mine) or on birthdays, and not responding when she lashes out at me or becomes irrational. 
After our last contact she blocked me when I didn’t respond to a long text where she blamed me for ‘discarding her’ because she’s ‘poor’ That is obviously not the reason so I did not entertain the bait. 

Soon I will return to my home country after 2+ years to visit my father and friends. I will visit the city where she lives to see my friends. It’s a small city so I’m terrified to run into her. I also have a younger sister that still lives with my mom (classic) and I’d like to see her too. Several people have suggested I should offer to have a coffee with my mom to “do the right thing” and/or have closure. But, in all honesty if I would do it, it would be out of duty and essentially to make her feel better about my estrangement. I just don’t see how it will be a good time? I would have to pretend everything is fine. I would have to email her because I am still blocked everywhere else. I would have to strengthen myself for the expected attempts at gaslighting/guilttripping/manipulation. Her ego is already shattered because I have put so much distance between us after being enmeshed for my whole childhood. And confronting/making a boundary with a narcissist does not invite healthy repair. The last time I visited, I wrote her that I would love to see her and my sister but that I will not stay at her apartment. Instead of respecting this boundary she lashed out at me and said she “doesn’t want to see me either” I didn’t fall for the manipulation and she didn’t text me again so during that trip we did not see each other. 

My father has suggested I see her because “it’s the right thing to do” but he also comes from an abusive household where everything was swept under the rug. I understand my mother is ill and I have empathy for her, but also feel that my duty should be to my own healing? I would appreciate any feedback!!! Feel like im going crazy and haven’t even seen her yet haha

My family (mom, dad, sister, and I) will be traveling to Japan for the first time in the second week of December, and I’d love to get some insights or advice on our rough itinerary so far.

Anything with an asterisk (\*) is something we don’t necessarily feel we have to do – more like “maybe” items.

**OSAKA**

**Day 1**

* Arrive in Osaka (1:15 PM)
* Check into hotel (around 3 PM)
* Rest / freshen up
* Dinner
* Stroll around Dotonbori Street



**Day 2**

Using Osaka Amazing Pass

* Osaka Castle
* Umeda Sky Building
* HEP Five Ferris Wheel\*
* Dotonbori Night Cruise



**Day 3**

Osaka Amazing Pass (again)

We’re not quite sure which attractions to pick yet, but here a couple things I just put on the list:

* Osaka Museum of Housing & Living
* Osaka Museum of History

If anyone has recommendations for must-do sites under the pass, I’d love to hear them!



Thinking of heading to Kuromon Market in the evening?



**Day 4**

Shopping Day

* Shinsaibashi
* Amerika-mura



* Shinsekai Market
* Tsutenkaku Tower
* Denden Town



(Not expecting to do everything on this list, but grouped them based on what’s nearby.)



**OSAKA → TOKYO**

**Day 5**

Travel to Tokyo

* Check in at hotel in Ueno
* Rest / nap
* Dinner
* Ameyoko Shopping Street



**Day 6** – Shibuya & Harajuku + Shinjuku

Shibuya / Harajuku:

* Meiji Shrine\*
* Yoyogi Park\*
* Shibuya Scramble Crossing
* Shibuya Sky\*
* Hachiko Statue
* Shopping
* Street Food



Shinjuku:

* 3D Cat Billboard
* Godzilla Building
* Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building\*
* Omoide Yokocho



**Day 7**

Originally had TeamLab Planets here but my parents might have vertigo issues so we’re skipping it.

* Here’s the current plan:
* TeamLab Planets\* (likely skipping)
* Tsukiji Outer Market\*
* Azabudai Hills / Tokyo Tower for photos\*



Ginza:

* Imperial Palace
* Uniqlo Flagship Store
* MUJI Ginza



Question:

What’s a good replacement for TeamLab / first half of the day?

Dad loves trying food, mom is down for anything (especially shopping), and my sister and I like cultural spots / K-pop / coffee & matcha places. Thinking of looking into Minato City.



**Day 8** – Asakusa

* Kimono rental (about 2 hours)
* Tea Ceremony\*
* Asakusa Shrine
* Sensoji Temple
* Nakamise-dori Street
* Tokyo Skytree\*

Then thinking of heading back to Shibuya or Shinjuku to hit anything we might’ve missed.



Please let me know what you guys think. TIA!

Why cant the consultant just let everyone pay for their own coffee?

When I'm a consultant, I'm going to have to do the same?

I would like to leave as a suggestion the coexistence of the three models of ""clients"" 
This is based on the model that now governs another game I'm in (one that has nothing to do with role-playing) but whose game model I thought might help here.
Since several of us are between those who are angry about the now prompt launch of p2play, others who say ""fine, but let it be by subscription"" and another part who can buy coffee so they have no problems with the current course.
What if all three live together?
In the game that has this model, the game itself is free, it is a TCG (card) game where per day it gives you the chance to open two envelopes with 5 cards in each envelope. Then there is the subscription option, which costs 9.99us and gives you the possibility of opening one more envelope and other exclusive benefits...
And then there's in-game currency (like status coffee) which you can buy individually or in batches. That in-game currency is used to buy everything from more packs to some things that you could easily access via subscription (but not all of them, obviously).

So.. why not apply the same system here in status?
Dude, free until... I don't know... 15 shares or 20? (Those who think they are decent to at least enjoy the game) Per day..
Then if you want the 60 actions (and some benefits such as being able to edit fleeting events) you pay a subscription... and leave the coffees as an added bonus.


I mean... it would make everyone happy and in the process they make profits whether from those who want to pay a subscription or from those who don't 🤷

**Background Knowledge:** 

So, growing up Xander lived in Florence Oregon with his Mother, Sasha Skye. He was close friends with Vashti Hughes because their moms were best friends and happened to have children at the same time. 

In first grade Xander befriended a boy named Logan Ferro, who quickly joined him and Vashti in their fun times, throughout elementary school - middle school they had a 'bully' named Kai. 

Xander and his Mom moved to Portland when his mom was diagnosed with Cancer so she could get better treatment at the start of high school, but he would go visit Florence every summer and stay at his uncle Arthur's house.   
  
Before Xander moved away Logan *really* wanted to be popular and he changed a whole lot and lowkey became kinda a bully like Kai and then Xander was like ‘brochaho ur being a dick. It's either us (him and Vashti) or PoPuLaRiTy’ and ofc Logan chose popularity + more friends so they had a huge argument/falling.  Since Xander left they never rlly got to resolve it.

**The Actual Plot Line:**

So Xander comes back for senior year of high school (sometime in late august) because his mother is DIED after her treatments stopped working, (more on that later) and Xander's grandparents can't take him cuz they live in an old folks home. So Xander goes to live with Arthur. (His Mother's Brother)

During the three weeks that they have left of summer Xander and Vashti go around wasting time doing wacky stuff like shopping, visiting the beach... and going to a party at Kai’s house. 

When they are at the party Vashti leaves Xander alone for a bit and he runs into Logan, who attempts to reconnect with him before getting stopped by Kai, who says some rude stuff and then leaves.   
  
After that fiasco Vashti and Xander dip and go to walk in the forest before they get ATTACKED by some Werewolf / monster or something and kill it, (later in the story we find out it was a kid from their class when he ends up getting reported as missing) they go back to the party freaking out this, but Kai does NOT believe them, and seeing as he's apparently very popular now, so does everyone else. 

When school starts up rumors that Vashti and Xander are a little weird have spread, which leads a girl named Sun to come talking to them. Her, Vashti and Xander start to become paranormal investigators (of the sorts), and They start the DeadTide Club (which is really just them meeting up after school in an empty classroom) 

The name DeadTide comes from when the earth-moon connection line is perpendicular to the earth-sun alignment, so the gravitational pulls partially cancel each other out. The water in a tidal area experiences a temporary pause in its movement as the tide changes direction, either from flood to ebb, or ebb to flow. 

ANYWAYS so then while this is going on Logan has been having some deep doubts about his friendship with Kai and compares it to Xan and Vashti's. These fears get so bad that Logan brings it up to Kai and Kai basically says “it's them or me."" And since Logan is pretty codependent on Kai he stays.

One day Logan, Kai, and his friends are at the beach and Logan feels like he's being ignored while Kai is off getting high and drinking with his gang. So Logan starts to carve stuff on drift wood BUT he drops it and it rolls down the dune, he has to go down and grab the stick that is now bobbing into the water. When he wades in and grabs it something GRABS HIS FOOT and pulls him into the ocean while he's screaming for Kai or SOMEONE, but he gets pulled all the way under. He somehow saves himself and comes back up to shore and goes to Kai, basically saying something along the lines of  “WHAT THE FUCK MICHIAH."" and then Kai is like “bruh when did you go swimming"" and Logan just snaps and is like “bro if you guys aren't getting in the car right now you can walk home urself."" and so he leaves and drives home. 

THEN Logan goes to the next club meeting. This was the last straw, and now he finally sees that Kai doesn't really care about him that much.  
  
So then there's a few episodes of them being a gang and doing shit with the supernatural and Kai being a bully and Logan and Xander kinda rekindling the flame and falling in love and such. 

The gang trauma bonds because apparently they are the only ones who can see it/were there when it happened/the only ppl who care about it?? 

There's a lot of world building for like twenty episodes or so with different monsters and more scary stuff. Throughout this time Xander is noticing weird stuff only happening to HIM and people are watching him…

In one of these episodes Kai goes missing and is missing for like a week, then Arthur gets some radio single and the gang piles into the boat and goes out to find it. They end up finding Kai but he’s being attacked / held captive by these creepy hot siren ladies and then they save him and he’s very confused, because he was under the impression that they did NOT like him that much, and they're just like 'you're not a great person but you don't deserve to die or anything man.’ and then when they get back to land Kai is kind of a bro but not really, he just doesn't bully them anymore. 

Right after this happens Xander is visited by a scared Faerie-like person, and they are like ALEXANDER SKYE you must go do bla bla bla and you're the only person who can do it… and Xander is like …. Yeah creepy okay… no… But they tell him to remove the Hag Stone form where it was buried under the lighthouse in Heceta Head so that they can get into the human world. And Xander… does it? Because he’s maybe being threatened? Because they’ll hurt Vashti or logan or something...

Some more drama happens and we’re starting to get a grip of what is going on, a main villain gets introduced in one of the episodes because XANDER TOOK THE FREAKIN STONEEEE and they try to stop him but fail and more creepy things are unleashed onto Florence. (Kai is there in a wrong place wrong time situation and officially becomes part of the gang but no one really likes him and he's kinda bitchy)

After this happens, and throughout the next few episodes a bunch of cryptic letters are sent to Xander and they cause him to doubt himself, and he asks Arthur about his dad and he’s really averting the topic and stuff so Xander drops it, but the weird stuff keeps happening. And Xander keeps running into a creepy guy. Xander starts to suspect that there's something else at foot.

Xander meets up with the letter giver, or confronts them and it turns out its the Fae from the beginning who told him to move the hag stone. Xander lets him go after asking a few questions that he Fae is like 'im sorry i can't answer that because of my treaty/law thing with Rithlorn' 

Who's Rithlorn?

After all this weird stuff happens Sun decides its a good time to lore drop and tells the gang about Fae. 

Basically Faeries were created by God as basically to guide humans around and help them with stuff. BUT Faeries or 'Fae' developed a habit of being jerks so God threw them into another world that is basically just earth but in a different dimension, like the spirit world, or the upside down from *Stranger Things*.   
THE CATCH IS they can move things and stuff, like your car keys or your glasses, and this is where the lore about Fae stealing your shit comes from. They can also see humans, but they cannot physically interact or harm them, once an object is in their hands it can no longer touch a human, and basically its been taken into their dimension, but once they set it down it appears back into the human realm.   
Also Fae can alter the appearance of their world, like add on things to a building or basically just like, make it look different/build construction but it will not be altered in the human realm. ALSO Humans can kinda see Fae sometimes and that's where ghosts come from (Fae can work Ouija boards and most of the time when ur talking to ‘ghosts’ you’re talking to a bored Fae)

  


Anyways after that nice tidbit of information, Sun turns around and points at Xander and accuses him of being a CHANGLING.

Everyone gasps. 

So basically they all get really suspicious of Xander, and Sun pulls out this huge bulletin board of all these facts about Xander and everyone is like ‘no… Xander’s not a spy…. He wouldn’t do that…..’ And Vashti at first sticks with Xander but at the end and the evidence is laid out she starts to believe Sun… 

Even Xander believes her because of all the letters he’s been getting obviously he’s part of it somehow. He himself thinks he very well could be, he's never been a 'normal' person, and he starts to feel really guilty for possibly replacing Sasha’s real kid. So he lets the gang tie him up and take him back to Sun’s house for questioning. 

Anyways eventually its really late and everyone is kind of freaking out but then Arthur breaks down the door with sun’s sister (more on her later) and is like ‘get your hands off my nephew right now.’ and they really don’t wanna be doing this to their bff so they’re like ‘YES PLEASE’ 

Anyways Arthur lore drops about how Xander is the son this guy named Rithlorn. (remember that name?)  
He says that Sasha met Rithlorn around this time seventeen years ago, when Sasha and Arthur were seventeen. When Arthur first met Rithlorn he thought he could tell there was something... not fully human about him... And he spent a couple of days doing research to try to find out who he was, but when he couldn't find ANYTHING about this guy except for an old photo from the late 1800's of a guy who looked eerily similar to Rithlorn he turns to a guy named William, the local weird kid in town. Will helps Arthur find out about the Fae, and through this he finds out that Rithlorn guy is actually some evil Fae man from two hundred years ago. When Arthur found out who Rithlorn was he flipped out, because he knew, due to other information, what Rithlorn was trying to do. So he camped out at Rithlorn's house and kidnaped Rithlorn’s SISTER, but it turns out that she also thinks he’s crazy for wanting to take over the human world so they try to defeat him together, but Rithlorn is mad powerful, and it goes all wrong and Rithlorn’s sister ‘dies’ (she doesn’t rlly Rithlorn just hurts her real bad and then banishes her to some tower in Fae world–this will be important later) BUT they manage to like lock the portal for like 17 years. (idk Xander is 18) Buuuutttt Rithlorn already got what he wanted. A conduit. Rithlorn's plan was to go to the Human realm during the time that the Dead Tide happens, prolonging the time it stays open with his powers, knock up a human, and create a child that could go unnoticed in the human realm until he needed it for his dark magic-take over the world purposes. 

And that conduit is Xander. He’s not a changeling, but he’s not exactly human either…. And so everyone is like *phew* and then Xander's like ‘but wait then why don’t I look like the Fae I've seen. And Arthur tells him that Rithlorn put a glamor on him to make him fit in better among humans, without it he would look like him. And that lowkey freaks Xander out and he runs outside and Logan has to go calm him down and some romance happens. 

Arthur tells them that Rithlorn is lowkey going crazy again cuz Xander is of age and they gotta fix this STAT. So him, sun, and Sun’s sister do some lore searching while Vashti and Kai take bets on whatever is going on outside with Logan and Xander. 

Xander then comes back and Lore dumps about him taking the Hag Stone and the letter Fae.

SO the three smart bros come to the conclusion that there is a magic portal to the Fae Realm that happens during the Dead Tide once every year, in which the water ebbs and the shore is pushed far back, revealing the sea floor. Though previously it had been prolonged by the Hag Stone that Arthur put in the light house back the first time he defeated Rithlorn, but since Xander took it, the portal will open up in a few days. 

Then they all get prepared to fight the evil Fae man while also keeping the creepy Fae apocalypse at bay. 

The time comes where they have to shut the portal down once and for all and Xander, Logan, and Sun's sister go off to close the portal while while Sun, Vashti, Kai and Arthur go to put the Hag stone back. 

Sun’s older sister knows how to close the portal, but needs Xander’s powers Fae powers, Xander throughout the last few chapters has been awakening his powers more since the stress level has gone UP and he's like pretty sure he can do it. So he tries really hard to close the big swirling portal in the middle of the sea floor (Which is uncovered because of the Dead Tide.) When all of a sudden his powers falter.  

AT THE LIGHT HOUSE, Arthur, Sun, Vashti and Kai encounter a bunch of the Fae + monster  lackeys, AND Rithlorn. They have to have a big bad battle. (They come across the Letter giving Fae but decide to spare them because they are very pitiful and sad and scared, so they run off into the forest)   
Kai, being the untrained person he is, is nearly killed by Rithlorn, but Sun, being one of the only people who treats him kindly and is kind of his friend, shoves him out of the way and slices and dices Rithlorn with her sword. 

For a few wonderful seconds everyone celebrates. Because it's \*over\* they \*won\*

And then Sun is stabbed, by none other than THE LETTER FAE. 

As the color drains from Sun's face and the world is deathly silent, the glamour melts from the body of the Fae we originally thought was Rithlorn. And so does the glamour on the letter Fae. Revealing that HE WAS RITHLORN THIS WHOLE TIME \*Vine boom\* He pulls the sword out of Sun before kicking her to the dirt. 

This man is fucking evil.

She dies. Rithlorn. (We now know that it was RITHLORN who sent Xander the notes, he was just wearing glamour) Is revealed as the REAL Rithlorn and everything goes to SHIT like jaw dropping SHIT. 

Kai is scared cuz he spent the better half of this season redeeming himself with Sun.

VASHTI is destroyed because Sun was like her quirky younger sister. 

And Arthur is like ‘FUCK NOT THIS GUY’ cuz when they killed the lackey “this seems too easy…"" and it was. it was. 

ANYWAYS BACK AT THE PORTAL. I bet you were wondering what caused Xander's powers to snap, it was Rithlorn using the surge of magic to take the glamour away (Magic is like a hive mind r smthn idk yet) Xander's powers faulter but he presses on, eventually he lets out a burst of magic SO INTENCE it shatters his glamour and now he looks like a full on Fae. 

Unfortunately, just as the portal is closing some hand reaches out and pulls Logan in, and in the split second that that happens Xander re opens the portal just a bit, dives in, and it closes. 

When the portal closed all the Fae + Magic things disappeared. 

So.... Sun's sister has to walk back alone, is faced with all this shit, then has to add to it by saying Logan and Xander got yoinked into the Fae realm. Everyone is depressed. It sucks. A lot of people cry. It’s sad. Everyone is FUCKING SAD.



**(SEASON ONE ENDS)** 

**SOME LORE ON WHY RITHLORN HATES HUMANS:**   
Rithlorn comes from a family of Fae that are basically the reason why the Fae live in the rip off U*pside Down*. He hates humans because they are advancing in technology and basically turning the world into something it ‘shouldn’t be’ and he wants the FAE to be able to do that, but since they’re trapped in the Fae realm they CANNOT. So that SUCKS. And so he used his crazy powers to open a rift into the human realm and then fucked a human because a Human + Fae child can walk in-between both realms, and has the power of a Fae n stuff. He was HOPING that one day Xander could break the spell keeping them locked up. 

  
So yeah.... That's it guys... I'd love any questions you have or anything I should do to make it make more since lol. ",1,1763362873.0,CHATHELPWITHMYCOMIC,0,1.0,False

1oz9m8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SirLoinstakes/comments/1oz9m8t/vii/,VII,"Watching her nurse the coffee, Eochu moved back to the fire. He pulled a small steel pot from his gear and the provision from his pack.

He tended to travel light but he always carried some jerked meat of one sort or another.  Today it was venison, there was a lone carrot in there and 2 smallish red potatoes.  A small cloth bundle held a few herbs and a fist sized packet of salt.  With another glance over his shoulder to assure she was ok he took the pot and headed back up towards the water fall.

He paid attention as he went and sure enough there on the bank he found a few sprouts of wild onion.  Catching about a half pot full of water he took his meager fixings over to a fallen log near the fire.  Pulling a broad bladed, antler handled knife from his belt he carved off a clean spot of the fallen log and set to chopping the carrot, potatoes, wild onion sprouts and then finely slicing the jerked venison.  He added it all to the pot along with a healthy dose of the herbs and a good pinch of salt.  

With the hatchet from his belt he found 3 green limbs that suited his purpose and deftly hacked them off a nearby tree trimming them up with the razors edge. 

Making a tripod over the fire with the three limbs he hung the pot’s wire handle from it and watched as the flames flickered at its blackened steel bottom.

He dug out his ladle and a single hand carved wooden bowl with its matching spoon.  
He looked up to see her watching him with those intelligent eyes.  He took the coffee pot from the edge of the fire and offered her a refill.  She still cradled the cup close and thanked him for the refresh.

Eochu stirred the pot with his ladle & took a tentative sip.  A few more minutes yet at that temp and the jerky would really soften infusing the stew with flavor and proteins. 

The woodsman moved around the camp putting his things away while the stew simmered. 
He had a hunch the green eyed brunette beauty was deep in thought assessing her options, planning her next step and possibly evaluating how much she could trust him. 

Rechecking the stew, he was content with it’s progress and ladled out a bowl full.  He took the meager wooden bowl over to her with its matching spoon and offered to trade.

She accepted, handing over his mug.  He gave a self depreciating shrug and said “I travel light, mostly alone.  If I’d known you were coming I’d have stocked up on utensils.” 

That earned him the first hint of a smile from her that he’d seen yet.  He liked the way it started with a crinkle in the corners of her eyes.  

Eochu drained the last of the coffee pot into the mug and drank it down quickly.  He dug in his bags and found another biscuit, offering it to Aisling with her stew.

While she ate he tended the fire and put away the coffee pot.  She finished the bowl of stew and sopped up the last with the biscuit, only then rising to bring him the bowl.

Eochu was an expert judge of men and horses.  He could size up either with a shocking degree of accuracy.  It was not the same for him with women.  Seeing her standing for the first time, He figured Aisling at maybe 5’8”.  Those brunnette curls draped to mid back.  She had a full chest accentuated by the plunging neckline of that red velvet dress and a set of what he’d heard called “child bearing hips.” 
As yet he’d seen nothing more than half her calves under that dress where she’d fallen, but something told him there were muscular legs tied to a cushion fit for riding under there.  

Snapping out of his reverie, he took the bowl she offered and filled it from the pot of stew.
He tucked in then and Aisling seemed to take note that he’d waited for her to finish with both the coffee and the stew before partaking himself. 

She seemed steady on her feet now though she moved a bit tender, Eochu had little doubt she was well on her way to a full recovery.  A little coffee and a good stew could work wonders.
The big woodsman patted the log beside him and said “I may look part Grizzly bear but I promise I won’t bite.” 
A split second’s contemplation and she settled down on the log next to him.
He asked between spoonfuls “Do you hurt anywhere? Any injuries I can’t see need tending to?”  
She looked a little shy as she responded “I think I’ll be ok, surviving an ambush like that with nothing more than a bump on the head and sore feet isn’t too bad.”
The woodsman finished his soup and stood.  “I’ve got some salve I keep for the horse in my pack.  It works wonders on things like saddle sores.  If you’ll permit me, I’ll tend to your aches.”

With a bit of a blush to her cheeks, she nodded her permission.  Eochu stepped over to his pack and returned with a rag, his canteen and a small jar.  

He knelt at her feet where she sat on the log and dampened the rag from his canteen.  She modestly bunched the skirts she wore up at her knees revealing her muscular ivory toned legs from mid calf down and set one foot upon his knee.  The big woodsman gently washed the offered foot with the damp rag.  He took care to go no higher than what she had chosen to reveal and worked his way down bc to the sole.  With it clean she traded out and he did the same for her second appendage.
With that done he reached to fingers into the little medicine jar and read the slave between his to large hands.   This time started at the soles, using his thumbs to work in the salve in small circles, even getting in between her dainty toes.  He took his time, making sure no part of either foot got neglected, rubbing the salve in thoroughly and massaging up to the exposed parts of her calves on each leg.  
He was rewarded for his efforts by the sounds she made. A deep “mhmmm” thrumming from her chest when he hit a good spot, a sigh of near bliss when he switched from one to the other.
For her part Aisling was shocked at the treatment from the woodsman at her feet.  He was big, dark and imposing.  He’d been pretty casual about his dispatching a half dozen violent men alone.  He moved through the woods like large predator.  Wolf or bear or maybe one of those mountain lions.  She couldn’t quite pin it down, she just felt it in her bones.  It was a primal feeling that tickled something deep within her, an old instinct from a time before men pretended to be civilized.
So far he had treated her with something more than just hospitality.  It was a caring, protectiveness, he’d put her needs first at every turn since she’d awakened.  
She pondered this dichotomy as he finished up and put his things away.

She watched from her spot on the log, feet dangling as he eased over to the big red stallion at the edge of the grove.  The woodsman spoke to the horse in a soft tone like the one she’d heard on the edge of her consciousness as she’d come around.  The woodsman led the horse back over near the gear and with one big hand slung it up to rest on the stallion’s back.
With a practiced ease he cinched all the straps and let the horse stand there.

Eochu nudged some dirt over their small fire with the toe of his boot ensuring it was out and then stepped next to her.  Towering over her he said “we should take care of your feet for a while yet.  You can ride, I’ll walk.  Will you permit me to carry you to your mount?”  

She could only nod in response before he’d scooped her up in his arms.  It wasn’t that far but she let her head rest on his shoulder as he stepped towards the big red stud.  This close she could smell him.  He smelled of cedar wood, leather and camp fire.  She felt a flutter in her belly.  That ancient primal instinct growing stronger.

Eochu set her on the stud and headed back out off the ridge back towards the carriage path.  ",1,1763362730.0,u_SirLoinstakes,0,1.0,False

I remember the exact moment. 3:17 AM, floor of my tiny apartment, cold coffee forgotten on the table. My phone screen glowed with $97.43. Rent due in three days. I’d just shut down another dead-end Shopify store—$1,200 vanished in ads, not a single sale. Before that, print-on-demand dragged on for six weeks and netted $64. Amazon FBA? $3,100 in fees for a warehouse full of dust. I was out of moves, out of cash, and staring down the barrel of going back to a job I hated.
A few months before, I’d scraped together enough for a cheap flight to China—just to get out of my head. Wandered into Shenzhen’s electronics markets, those endless rows of stalls buzzing with deals. That’s when I stumbled on it: a product that looked too good, felt too real. The seller handed me a sample. I tested it right there—plugged into my phone, pop-up animation flawless, noise cancel that cut through the market chaos, sound that tracked my head turns. Serial checked out clean, full coverage. I bought one to bring home, spent nights tearing it apart, comparing every detail. It was 1:1 quality, no question. And the price? $10 a unit straight from the source. The idea hit like a brick: Buy 100, flip locally. Simple. Low risk. Real math.
Back home, with $97 staring me down, I finally bet on it. Wired $1,000—my last dollar, plus $400 from my sister (who believed in me when I didn’t). Hands shaking, I hit send. Didn’t sleep for days, refreshing tracking like my life depended on it. When the box arrived, I ripped it open. Tested the first unit. Perfect. No issues.
Posted one basic listing that afternoon: “Lightly used, need cash fast—$49 meetup.” First reply in 11 minutes. By night, nine gone, $441 in my pocket. The messages kept coming—WhatsApp groups, campus chats, IG DMs. A week later, the full 100 sold out. That $1,000 became $3,900 profit. A month in, $12,000. Ninety days? $47,000. Now I’ve got a small spot in Shenzhen, suppliers who text me first, and coffee that doesn’t taste like regret.
I don’t need another $42 from you. I’ve built enough to chase bigger things—AI for supply chains, maybe my own line. But I haven’t forgotten that $97.43 glow, the knot in your stomach when everything’s on the line. The endless guessing, the fear that this will be the failure that breaks you.
That’s why I packed it all into one file—the contact, the market details, the quality checks I did, the listing that started the snowball. Not a course. Not hype. Just what pulled me out, so you don’t have to stumble like I did.

1oz9iun,https://www.reddit.com/r/MurricsContent/comments/1oz9iun/work_in_progress/,Work In Progress,"Every morning at 2 am, my dog Molly wakes me up to go outside. Like clockwork, I slip on my house shoes, put on a robe, grab my phone, and walk to the back door. Some old boards creak as I step on them, the sounds of clit clat coming from Molly walking ever so excitedly behind me. This has been our routine for 3 years now; wake up, let her out, she sniffs around the yard and tree line, does her business and runs back inside. Rain, sleet, snow, hot, cold, doesn't matter the weather, this is our 2 am routine.

This morning though, was not like other mornings. As I opened the back door, the cold, crisp, winter air rushed through the steadily growing gap. As I opened the door completely, I noticed what I thought to be a very dim ball shaped light illuminating from deep within the woods. ""That's odd"" I mumble to myself, squinting my eyes to possibly get a better look as I take a step outside, Molly brushing past me. She, oblivious to any possible intrusion, happily sniffs around, starting from the porch, making her way to the grass, then the side privacy fence, and eventually too far out for me to properly see her. Molly is a Bolognese breed; small, white, fluffy, docile, quiet, never barking, and overall a very good and loving companion. She was given to me by a friend of mine when my wife left me a little over 3 years ago. She divorced me, took the house, the kids, the car, the furniture, the bank account, everything. The only thing the court said I could grab was the clothes on my back, toiletries, and 2 suitcases of clothes and my dog. Molly has gotten me through many traumas these past few years, she is such a great dog. The move to the forested mountains of West Virginia was the best thing that has happened to me. Its quiet, quaint, and peaceful. I stay in a fairly small house, 2 beds, one of which was converted into an office space, 1 small bathroom, and a kitchen/living room combo. The people here are nice and friendly, they keep to themselves, and respect property lines. During hunting season from what I have noticed, people will not venture into my property without asking first, and typically, I am fine with it as long as they leave nature the same way as it was when they came. That's why seeing that dim light in the woods gave me cause for curiosity. Maybe it was the landowner who was next to me who decided to go camping with his family, besides, it was a nice night out anyways. Just as I was trying to put my thoughts together and come to a conclusion, Molly made her way back into the house, stopping halfway and looking up at me and give me a quiet bark. I looked back towards her and then back to the stationary light, ""Come on Molly, lets go back to sleep.""

""Chirp, chirp"" Clank clank. I wake up to a small blue bird, pecking on my window to give me what I assume to be a morning greet. ""Urgh"" I sit up, stretching and wiping my eyes. I look down towards the ground and see Molly still asleep facing the closed door. Looking at the clock, I read 8:00am, an hour and a half, before the new stock exchange opened. Plenty of time to get ready for the day. It only took me 45 minutes to shower, walk Molly, exercise, and sip on some coffee while watching wildlife from my back porch. Looking out where the light was I see a man standing at the edge of the treeline dressed in a red and black flannel shirt, what I think is blue jeans, and a fuzzy cap. He carries either a rifle or shotgun, but from this distance I cant tell. He makes no motion, makes no sound, just stares towards the forest, back facing toward me. ""Hello? Can I help you?"" no response was given by this man, ""I'm not sure if you know this, but you're on my property,"" still no response, not even a budge or reaction. Oddly enough, I don't feel threatened by his presence, rather I feel an aura of peace and calmness. ""Listen, whoever you are, I am fine with you hunting on my land, just please leave nature the same way you found it, ok?"". Eventually I get to the study, turn on all the relevant channels on my wall mounted tvs and power on the laptop and the apps I need to use; work phone by my side. As I open the blinds, the warm light of the Sun shines through. ""Ah yes, this is going to be a beautiful day, I can tell,"" I say as I look down at Molly, she sitting by my leg leg, looking up at me and wagging her tail. ""Go on, sit on your bed"" As soon as I say this, a call comes through, ""Ah, 9:30, time to start the day"".

""Good morning, Mountain Inves...."" I greet the caller but he quickly cuts me off.

""WHAT, THE, ACTUAL, HELL!!!"" a man's voice scream through the other end ""$500,00 dollars on CORDSYNERGY!? WHAT ARE YOU THINKING!?""

""Sir, if you give me a minute, I can explain my rational"" I pleaded

""YOU BETTER!""

""Yes sir"", I go on to explain why I felt a large investment into this chemical energy company was a good deal including their positive return on investment history, newfound reserves of oil, and their partnership with other major players in the industry. After a very tense 45 minutes to an hour conversation, he agrees and hangs up the phone. I sigh as I rub my eyes and lean back into the chair, my head hanging over the top of the back of the chair.

""Aoof"" Molly looks at me, wagging her tail as she puts her paw on my leg, panting

""You're such a good dog,"" I say as I pick her up, place her on my lap, and pet her long, soft, curly white fur. The day goes on with many calls. Some good, some not so good, many stock highs and many many more lows. I can only imagine the people I made very wealth, but the stress always comes from not wanting to make any of them poor, but as this industry is, some do inevitably go broke, those are the worst calls. I remember one such investment about 3 or 4 years ago. A woman around the age of 30, new to investing, wanted to build up a nest egg for her family. After paying off all her debts, she was left with 200,000 dollars, so she came to me. My reputation even before Starting up Mountain Investments was good, but now as a solo investor, I felt that it gave me more time to be more personal with my clients and their needs. Given that, I took a few hours out of my day, wanting to hear about her life and the investment strategy she wished to partake in, whether she wanted to be aggressive or passive, she chose aggressive and I agreed. Sadly, this was during a very bad year in the economy and most of the stock market collapsed, losing her and many of my clients hundreds of thousands, even millions of dollars. Sadly, a phone call came that day that I was not ready for.

""Sir, is this Michael from Nations Investment Group?""

""Yes sir, it is""

""I am Officer Daniels with the Atlanta PD, investigation unit. We are investigating a murder suicide and your name came up as a possible lead. Sir, your name and number was written on a piece of paper in the victims house, is there any reason why that may be there?""

Shocked at the news, my skin got clammy and sweaty. the room was spinning and my head was light.

""Sir, are you there? Mr. Michael?""

""Yes sir, sorry, this is not news I wanted to hear today.""

""I am going to ask again, do you know why your name and number was written in a piece of paper in the crime scene?""

""No sir, I do not. The only thing I can guess is this was a client of mine. May I ask the name of the client?""

""No, sir. We cannot indulge this information.""

the conversation went on for hours as I slowly realized this person, this victim was the same person trying to amass a small fortune for her family. When the economy tanked and she lost her fortune, she was left with nothing. Sadly, she thought the only way out, was to end herself as well as her husband and kids, not to leave them with the shame or guilt of losing everything. This was the straw that broke the camels back as they say when it came to my marriage. This event caused me into a deep spiral of mourning and alcoholism, so much so that I would neglect my work by staying home, lounge on the couch in my urine stained underwear and drown in Jack. The light of the tv would light the house from sun up to sun down. Eventually after a year of this, I lost my job, was forced to move out, and moved up to this beautiful mountain. Since then, I have not touched a drop of alcohol, my life is so much more simpler, or so it was.

Slowly, I stand up from my chair as Molly drops onto the floor landing on her feet.

AITA?","This was a while ago but it's been bothering me ever since because I know it's a serious social faux pas to show PDA with Finns and I really want the family to like me.

Anyway, here's the story. So I've been dating my girlfriend, who is Finnish-American, for 8 years and she's moved between America and Finland several times. She also has 3 sisters who are all younger. My girlfriend is more Americanized than her sisters because she's spent more time here so is more comfortable with being affectionate even when not alone, like we sometimes hug or hold hands when we're in the living room instead of just in her room or the basement where we watch movies and such. When we first started dating 8 years ago I didn't know about the severity of the rule and hugged her in the kitchen when her mom was there and she told us to get a room. I thought she was joking because that's the kind of thing my mom would joke about. We have a much better understanding of each other now and her family treats me like one of their own, but one of her sisters is VERY intimidating.

It gets kind of messy here I think. I was making a sandwich at my girlfriend's house and she was making coffee, and she did a little happy dance because her favorite mug (a my hero academia mug with Deku doing a cool pose) was clean and right in the front of the cabinet and I thought it was so cute that I just looked at her and said ""I love you"" without thinking and her sister got angry at me. She said ""Can't you two do that downstairs?"" And stormed off. I felt so embarrassed, because I really want her to like me, but I find her extremely scary. Her mom calls her the Stomper because of how loudly she walks. And her footsteps sound like my dad's when he's angry. I asked my girlfriend if what I said was inappropriate and she said no, that her sister was just sensitive to relationships because her first boyfriend just dumped her, but I can't get it out of my head that I seriously fucked up.

I actually have no idea if her sister likes me because when the family took me to Finland for Christmas to meet her grandparents and cousins she got very drunk and hugged me and cried about how she loves how happy I make her sister and that she can't wait for me to be her brother but I never got that impression from her sober. And I think I messed up there too because I said ""Awwww, really??? I think you're kind of scary...""

Upon telling a friend A of over 30 years this, one of his first responses was ""I probably won't be able to visit you"". That stung a bit and to be honest it felt like another nail in a friendship I think had drifted in the last 5 years or so. Although we hung out, it was rare to get invited to his either individually or for our families - or even just to catch up over coffee or whatnot.

I'm in a group chat with friend A and friend  B and we've continued chatting like we always have. friend B has messaged me outside of that to see how we are and such, but nothing from the friend A.

Friend B messaged me last week asking if I could reach out to friend A because he's taken it really personally that I moved but that he's happy for me and my family seemingly.

I refer back to what he said when I announced our move. He's got the means for him and his family to travel so that's no excuse and he took an expensive trip with his family this summer so it's clear I'm not a priority.

I just don't know if I should reach out after effectively a year of silence. Or what I'd even say or gain. I don't hold any ill will, friendships change over time and that's cool.

1oz9adf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/1oz9adf/comment_from_sleep_technician_after_my_psg_but/,Comment from Sleep Technician after my PSG (but before MSLT),"Long story short: 

Woke up from my PSG. Was getting ready for MSLT. Daytime technician asked why my doctor wanted a sleep study done. I said I'm ridiculously sleepy + just started low-dose modafinil. 

She said, **""Just between you and me, based on the patterns of your PSG last night, you definitely need a stimulant... because girl you are TIRED.""** 

Now I'm wondering... what did that comment mean exactly?? I know sleep technicians are *not* supposed to tell you or confirm/deny anything, so 1) I was shocked she said anything at all and 2) has anyone else ever gotten a comment like this from a sleep technician? I'm so curious to know!!

For those that want more details:

I'm a 24F in med school. Past 11 months I have been having progressive worsening of fatigue and increased sleep need despite forcing myself to get 8 hours of sleep nightly (even if it means abandoning my studying). It has progressed to the point where I take multiple naps a day, fall asleep in coffee shops, have microsleeps when driving (and need to pull over for a 30 min nap in my backseat for my safety), sleep at my desk, drink ungoldly amounts of caffeine, and more. Most distressing is that I have had such horrific brain fog. Its been very difficult with the daily heavy content load I am dealing with for school. So far, my only saving grace has been studying flashcards on the treadmill... so lets just say I do a lot of walking. Other things to note: I have daily headaches, naps are not really refreshing but I do feel refreshed after full nighttime sleep, am on a SSRI, no typical N1 symptoms, my mom also has hypersomnia-like sleep tendencies (but never diagnosed). 

I went to a sleep medicine doc who thought my symptoms didn't fit into 1 box but was concerned enough for my functioning as a student and human being that he prescribed me a low dose of modafinil until I got my sleep study results back.

Completed my PSG and MSLT 2 days ago. It was a nightmare being off my modafinil and and having no caffeine, but I made it out alive somehow. For the PSG, they let me sleep **11 HOURS!!!** I was shocked. They said it was because I went into REM about an hour before they were going to end the study, but even then that would be 10 hours of sleep data they wanted from me?? But that seems like a long time. This is when the comment by the sleep technician was made as I was getting ready for the MSLT.

MSLT was a terrible time. I was being taunted with the idea of sleep for the 2 hours in between and then I swear the second they said ""alright, we're going to begin the nap now"", my body forgot how to sleep. I felt like I was sitting there super anxious and in this weird state of sitting with my thoughts but visually seeing shadowy images of what I was thinking of?? But I felt like I was not fully conscious of the amount of time going by so IDK. I ended up doing all 5 naps. Now I wait for my results. Eeeek

I remember the exact moment. 3:17 AM, floor of my tiny apartment, cold coffee forgotten on the table. My phone screen glowed with $97.43. Rent due in three days. I’d just shut down another dead-end Shopify store—$1,200 vanished in ads, not a single sale. Before that, print-on-demand dragged on for six weeks and netted $64. Amazon FBA? $3,100 in fees for a warehouse full of dust. I was out of moves, out of cash, and staring down the barrel of going back to a job I hated.
A few months before, I’d scraped together enough for a cheap flight to China—just to get out of my head. Wandered into Shenzhen’s electronics markets, those endless rows of stalls buzzing with deals. That’s when I stumbled on it: a product that looked too good, felt too real. The seller handed me a sample. I tested it right there—plugged into my phone, pop-up animation flawless, noise cancel that cut through the market chaos, sound that tracked my head turns. Serial checked out clean, full coverage. I bought one to bring home, spent nights tearing it apart, comparing every detail. It was 1:1 quality, no question. And the price? $10 a unit straight from the source. The idea hit like a brick: Buy 100, flip locally. Simple. Low risk. Real math.
Back home, with $97 staring me down, I finally bet on it. Wired $1,000—my last dollar, plus $400 from my sister (who believed in me when I didn’t). Hands shaking, I hit send. Didn’t sleep for days, refreshing tracking like my life depended on it. When the box arrived, I ripped it open. Tested the first unit. Perfect. No issues.
Posted one basic listing that afternoon: “Lightly used, need cash fast—$49 meetup.” First reply in 11 minutes. By night, nine gone, $441 in my pocket. The messages kept coming—WhatsApp groups, campus chats, IG DMs. A week later, the full 100 sold out. That $1,000 became $3,900 profit. A month in, $12,000. Ninety days? $47,000. Now I’ve got a small spot in Shenzhen, suppliers who text me first, and coffee that doesn’t taste like regret.
I don’t need another $42 from you. I’ve built enough to chase bigger things—AI for supply chains, maybe my own line. But I haven’t forgotten that $97.43 glow, the knot in your stomach when everything’s on the line. The endless guessing, the fear that this will be the failure that breaks you.
That’s why I packed it all into one file—the contact, the market details, the quality checks I did, the listing that started the snowball. Not a course. Not hype. Just what pulled me out, so you don’t have to stumble like I did.

1oz994u,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_johnsmithmath89/comments/1oz994u/breville_espresso_machine_tips_and_tricks/,Breville Espresso Machine Tips and Tricks,"# Introduction: Why Breville Machines Are Loved Worldwide

Breville espresso machines are some of the most user-friendly machines you can buy for your home. Even if you’re a beginner, you can make café-quality espresso with just a few simple steps. But the real secret is this:

**Breville machines shine the most when you know how to use them properly.**

In this guide, I’ll share the best **tips, tricks, techniques, settings, and barista secrets** that help you pull richer shots, get creamier milk, and enjoy better coffee every single day.

This article is intentionally written in **simple, clear English** so anyone can follow along easily.

# SECTION 1: Essential Breville Espresso Tips for Beginners

# 1. Always Use Fresh Coffee Beans

Old beans = flat taste.  
Fresh beans = richer, sweeter espresso.

**Best practice:**  
Use beans roasted within 2–4 weeks.

# 2. Set Your Grinder Properly

Breville machines like the Barista Express or Barista Pro come with built-in grinders.  
A small change in the grind size can dramatically change your espresso.

# General Guideline

* **Too fast shot (under 20 seconds)** → Make grind **finer**
* **Too slow shot (over 35 seconds)** → Make grind **coarser**

The grind should look like **fine sand**, not powder.

# Target Shot Time

24–30 seconds for a double espresso  
This is the “sweet spot” for flavor.

# SECTION 2: Tips That Improve Espresso Quality Instantly

# 1. Preheat Everything

Preheat your:

* Portafilter
* Cup
* Group head

Cold metal makes weak espresso.

**How to preheat:**  
Lock the empty portafilter and run hot water for 2–3 seconds.

# 2. Use the Right Coffee Dose

Most Breville machines work best with:

**18–19 grams** of ground coffee (double shot basket)

# 3. Tamp Properly

Tamping is pressing the coffee inside the portafilter.

# Rules for perfect tamping:

* Press **evenly**
* Press with **firm pressure** (about 30 lbs)
* Keep the surface **flat**

Uneven tamp → uneven flow → bitter espresso.

# 4. Wipe the Rim of the Portafilter

Always clean the rim after grinding.  
If coffee grounds sit on the edge, the water flow gets uneven.

# 5. Run a Water Flush Before Brewing

Press the shot button once without coffee for 1 second.  
This clears the group head and stabilizes temperature.

# SECTION 3: Milk Frothing Tips and Latte Art Secrets (Breville Machines)

Breville steam wands are beginner-friendly, but a few tricks make a huge difference.

# 1. Use Cold Milk

Cold milk gives you more time to stretch (add air).

Whole milk makes the creamiest micro-foam.

# 2. Angle the Pitcher

Hold the pitcher slightly sideways so the milk spins like a whirlpool.  
This creates tiny bubbles = smoother texture.

# 3. Steam Wand Position

Place the wand just **below the surface** of the milk.

# Goal:

* Add air for 3–5 seconds
* Then submerge deeper
* Let the milk spin until it feels warm (65°C or 150°F)

# 4. Don’t Overheat the Milk

Too hot = burnt taste  
Too cool = flat taste

**Perfect temperature:**  
You should stop steaming when the pitcher becomes too hot to hold for more than 2 seconds.

# 5. Spin and Tap Before Pouring

* **Tap** the pitcher to remove bubbles
* **Swirl** the milk to make it glossy

Now you can pour smooth latte art.

# SECTION 4: Advanced Breville Tricks for Better Espresso

These tips can take you from “beginner” to “home barista.”

# 1. Use the “Razor Tool” Properly

Many Breville models come with a Razor Tool.  
It trims the coffee bed to the perfect height.

Use it after tamping for more consistent shots.

# 2. Try the “Pre-Infusion” Trick

Breville machines automatically pre-infuse (add light water pressure).

But you can control it manually:

**Tip:**  
Hold the shot button halfway for 1–2 seconds before locking the pressure fully.  
This results in smoother, sweeter espresso.

# 3. Use Filtered Water

Tap water minerals can:

* Change taste
* Build scale
* Damage the machine over time

Filtered water protects the boiler and improves flavor.

# 4. Descale Every 2–3 Months

Breville machines collect mineral buildup.  
Clean them regularly to keep temperature stable.

# 5. Try Single-Wall Baskets

Pressurized (dual-wall) baskets help beginners.  
But for café-quality espresso, use **single-wall** baskets.

Single-wall baskets give you:

* More crema
* More flavor
* Better control

# SECTION 5: Troubleshooting – Fix Common Breville Problems

# Problem 1: Espresso is too bitter

Possible causes:

* Grind is too fine
* Water too hot
* Over extraction
* Stale beans

**Fix:**  
Make grind coarser, shorten shot time.

# Problem 2: Espresso is sour

Possible causes:

* Under extraction
* Grind too coarse
* Not enough coffee
* Low temperature

**Fix:**  
Make grind finer, increase dose.

# Problem 3: No crema

Causes:

* Old beans
* Wrong grind
* Too little coffee

Use fresh beans and grind finer.

# Problem 4: Weak milk foam

Causes:

* Wrong milk
* Wrong wand position
* Overheating

Start with cold whole milk and keep the whirlpool motion.

# SECTION 6: Table Summary for Quick Learning

|Problem|Cause|Simple Fix|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Bitter espresso|Too fine grind|Make coarser|
|Sour espresso|Too coarse grind|Make finer|
|No crema|Old beans|Use fresh beans|
|Weak foam|Not enough air|Keep wand near surface|
|Uneven extraction|Uneven tamping|Tamp flat and even|
|Burnt taste|Overheated milk|Stop at 150°F|

# SECTION 7: User Experience – What Home Baristas Say

**Michael, NYC**  
“I struggled with sour espresso until I learned how shot time affects flavor. Now I hit 28 seconds every time. Huge difference!”

**Sarah, Texas**  
“The whirlpool trick for milk frothing made my cappuccinos taste like a coffee shop.”

**Jason, Florida**  
“Using filtered water alone improved my espresso more than any expensive upgrade.”

# SECTION 8: Expert Insights from Baristas

Professional baristas agree on these three rules:

1. **Consistency beats equipment.** Small changes in grind size matter more than buying a new machine.
2. **Milk texture determines latte quality.** Perfect micro-foam is the secret of velvety drinks.
3. **Fresh beans are everything.** No machine can fix old coffee.

I had been focusing on my health and now that I was being treated for Narcolepsy I might actually be able to work and graduate. I was full of determination. 

End of dream.

After waking up it took me a while to realise I actually already have my bachelor (2017). 

And after standing up I wanted to grab something from my drawer but my husband was also there and I am not sure what emotion or state I was in. Groggy for sure. But then I had a drop fall from cataplexy and I fell hard on my right cheek. 
I wonder if it will turn out bruised 🥲
