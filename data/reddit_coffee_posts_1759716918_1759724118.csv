Nepal is one of those destinations that can fit nearly every kind of traveler. Whether you’re a backpacker counting every dollar, a couple looking for comfort without overspending, or someone ready to enjoy Nepal’s luxury side, the country has something for you. Prices in Nepal are generally lower compared to many international destinations, but costs vary depending on where you go, what level of comfort you expect, and what activities you choose.

This guide breaks down the **cost of traveling in Nepal** for budget, mid-range, and luxury travelers. You’ll get an idea of daily expenses, accommodation, food, transport, trekking, and extras, so you can plan a trip that suits your style and wallet.

1nz95fk,https://www.reddit.com/r/uktravel/comments/1nz95fk/uk_trip_report_london_stonehengebath_london/,UK Trip Report: London → Stonehenge/Bath → London → Edinburgh/Stirling → Edinburgh → London,"Thank you all for reviewing my itinerary and sharing your thoughts and recommendations.  I came back to California yesterday and would like to share my thoughts and a little trip report with you all.  Hopefully, future travelers will find the info helpful and I’ve benefited from reading many posts here myself.

Here are some random quick thoughts:

1. **Arrival** \- I took the suggestion of a Redditor and took the Picadilly Line to Baron’s Court, then switched trains to Victoria Station.  Baron’s Court station is great.  You step off the train, walk 5 steps across the platform and then take another train.  No lugging suitcases up and down the stairs/escalators.
2. **Cash** is really not needed.  The only time I needed cash was at the laundromat in Edinburgh.  I just exchanged US$20 at M&S Travel and paid my £8 for wash and fold service (so worth it!).  Other than that, tap your credit card/watch/cell phone and off you go!
3. Speaking of **Tap and Go**, I wish every (major) city in the world had this option for public transportation.  It’s a god send!  
4. The **food** item I consumed the most is ….  Potatoes!  Crisps, Chips, Roasted, Mashed… delicious!
5. The **food** is less salty and less sweet than what I am used to.  I would not call it bland, just less and probably healthier for me.
6. The **weather** was not as cold as I thought it would be.  It was lovely.  During my 14-day trip, it rained 2 days in Edinburgh (arrival & departure) and 1.5 days in London (more drizzly than rain).  I feel very blessed!
7. **Rail pass** \- if you travel enough on the train, you should get it.  I was too dumb and impatient, thus, I didn’t get mine.  
8. **One-day bus tour** to Stonehenge & Bath - it may not be worth it to many, but I think it’s worth it for me.  The amount of time spent at each location walking around was enough.  Of course, this is very subjective
9. Props to **clean public restrooms/toilets** \- whether paid or unpaid.  I do miss toilet seat covers and paper towels.  Most restrooms do not have paper towels to dry my hands but only have air dryers.  I am sure this is more environmentally friendly.
10. It is **expensive** and I am coming from an expensive metropolitan area in California.  Prices are comparable to what I pay for at home (after factoring 20% gratuity and almost 10% sales tax).
11. **Gratuity** is added to all (I think) of my sitdown meals, ranging from 5%-15%.  It does say ‘optional’ and I am sure you can ask to take that off, but  I didn’t.
12. I enjoy staying close to Victoria Station and have access to many buses and train lines, plus food options.  It’s super convenient.
13. Taking the **bus** is enjoyable to go around town especially when I’m tired from walking.  It also took me to areas I probably didn’t think to check out.  Day time and night time views are different and charming in their own ways.  I don’t think you need the Hop On/Hop Off bus.  
14. **Public Transportation** \- I was on the London bus, Edinburgh bus, Stirling bus, tour bus, Uber, taxi, the Tube, LNER, and other trains.  Aside from the ferry/cruise (wanted to but rained on my planned day), I was on it all and loved them all.  
15. **Book in advance** \- for big sites that you want to visit, definitely book your tickets in advance.  
16. **Lastly, everyone is nice and friendly!**



Hotels:

1. [Hotel Riu Plaza London Victoria ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vpNyKjaTkKYuyDba9)\- a block away from Victoria station and has an excellent breakfast buffet included in the room price.
2. [Tynecastle Park Hotel (Edinburgh)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RtnHUibR82nU2Ba2A) \- about 20 mins away from Old Town/New Town but close to bus stop with multiple bus lines to town; quiet hotel next to Heart Football Club; a block away from the Wash n Fold Launderrette 🙂
3. [The Westminster London, Curio Collection by Hilton](https://maps.app.goo.gl/m6qxa92ZWTcRY6pt9) \- 10-15 min walk from Pimlico or Westminster station; close to a couple bus lines but not least convenient amongst my 3 hotels; close to River Thames, Westminster Abbey and Tate Britain

**Trigger Warnings:** >!stalking; internet stalking; manipulation; emotional abuse!<

**Mood Spoiler:** >!wtf wtf wtf!<

**Background** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1h97um8/aita_for_breaking_up_with_my_boyfriend_after_he/)**: December 7, 2024**

**Title:** AITA for breaking up with my boyfriend after he chose me in an ultimatum?

Me (27F) and my boyfriend (27M) have been dating for two months. We have so much in common, he's super sweet and always goes the extra mile for me with grand romantic gestures, even asking me out by buying me my favorite comic book and leaving a sticky note between the pages confessing his feelings. I've never gotten anything but amazing vibes from him this whole time until now. However, BF has a childhood friend (27F) I'll call Syd. My boyfriend was very upfront when we started dating that he and Syd had romantic feelings for each other in the past but decided it would be best they only stayed friends since they didn't want to risk their friendship. I never actually met Syd before and have only heard about her from BF and vice versa.

About two weeks ago, my BF texted me, super distraught, telling me that Syd called him, saying that she was too jealous of my and BF's relationship and that she couldn't stand being BF's friend while he was in a happy relationship with me. She basically gave BF an ultimatum of him having to break up with me or she would cut him out of her life. I was baffled by this, thinking that this 27 year old woman, who had mutually agreed with BF that they would never date, was so childish to give him a ridiculous ultimatum and I voiced that to him. He got mad at me, saying ""It's not that simple"" and seemed to be seriously considering breaking up with me just to stay friends with Syd.

I was in disbelief that he couldn't see how manipulative and abusive this was, and that the obvious conclusion would be to cut her off since she was clearly toxic and controlling, but he was still on the fence and we ended up taking a break and not talking while he ""thought it over"". The next week and a half, he barely talked to me, telling me he's in a very hard place while I became increasingly frustrated that this would even be a hard choice. Like, we're in a happy relationship, and he's debating breaking up because his crazy friend can't handle her jealousy? I was fuming.

He then finally came to me after that time of not talking saying he decided to ""choose me"" and leave his friendship with Syd behind, but by that time I was so mad that it was even a choice that took two whole weeks to decide to begin with that I ended up breaking up with him anyway.

Now his friends are telling me I'm an asshole for not breaking up with him sooner because now Syd is still cutting him out for picking me over her AND I'm still leaving him, whereas if I had broken up with him during the weeks he was ""thinking it over"", he would have at least been able to stay friends with Syd. But honestly, I didn't even realize how mad I was until he picked me and made it seem like he was some kind of martyr for doing so. AITA?

**Update (Same Post): Date unknown, sometime in the next month**

UPDATE: Apparently, Syd has completely cut EXBF off and blocked him on everything. He is begging me to take him back, even contacting my friends to attempt to convince me (luckily, all my friends are telling him to eff off). He wrote me some 2000 word essay on how I'm the best thing that ever happened to him and that he was blinded by his happy childhood memories of Syd. I also found out they slept together in the past before we started dating, so that's cool! But it was just ""a one night stand"" to ""see what could have been."" 

Either way, he was definitely hiding more about his relationship with Syd than I was told. I don't really care anymore. I'm not taking him back. He's a grown-ass man who should have known better than to ghost me for two weeks to ""think it over"" as if things would be the same after he decided to ""pick me"". Doubt anything else interesting will happen but I might update if it does. I'm honestly just hoping this will be a reality check for him, and he'll get the message. At least his friends have stopped bothering me.

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nr5u49/my_28f_boyfriend_29m_let_my_stalker_ex_28m_into/)**: September 26, 2025 (almost 10 months later)**

I (28F) broke up with my ex (28M) ten months ago but he will not get over it. Despite me wishing to no longer interact with my ex, as well me as dating someone new (Cole, 29M), my ex has been trying to win me back by doing over-the-top things like sending me gift baskets, love letters, chocolates, etc even though I've blocked his number, on all social media and always ignore his ""attempts to woo me"" with his gifts. He never actually interacts with me directly. Never waits for me outside or tries to talk to me, he just leaves me gifts at our doorstep and runs away. It's creepy and makes me super uncomfortable.

Cole, who I live with, doesn't actually see an issue with this and says he ""feels bad for my ex"" and ""doesn't want me to waste my ex's money/efforts"" so I reluctantly just let Cole eat the chocolates and other crap since he insists I don't throw them out. He even likes reading the love letters even though I tell him I don't want to. I don't understand why he's so chill about this because my ex and Cole aren't even friends and have never interacted, so it makes no sense why he's so okay with my ex doing these dumb gestures that he KNOWS make me uncomfortable and creeped out. If anything, Cole should be pissed off that someone is trying to steal his girlfriend, right?

Anyway, all of this finally came to a head on my birthday. After work, I came home to our apartment decorated in balloons, chocolates, and flowers. I'm immediately touched, thinking all of this was a surprise from Cole.

NOPE.

Apparently, my ex actually CAME OVER with all this crap, buzzed our apartment doorbell, Cole LET HIM IN, and allowed my ex to DECORATE OUR APARTMENT AND LEAVE GIFTS FOR ME. Then my ex left before I could get home. Cole apparently saw NO ISSUE WITH THIS. He literally LET MY EX INTO OUR APARTMENT LIKE IT WAS NO BIG DEAL because my ex ""came all the way with all these gifts which was such a thoughtful gesture!"".

Now I feel totally unsafe. What if my ex secretly left a hidden camera or something?! I have no idea why Cole is so fine with all of this! I've talked to him over and over and he won't understand why I would want to reject free stuff from someone who cares about me. I love Cole but the fact that he actually let my ex into our apartment was a huge breach of my trust and I have no clue how to deal with this.

Is this relationship just unsalvageable or is there a way I can get it through Cole's head that none of this is okay? Could Cole have ulterior motives by letting my ex do all of these things? Any advice is welcome. I just have no clue how to handle this absurd situation. Thanks.

Edit: Thank you for all the insight, everyone! I really appreciate it. I don't have the money to do everything that was recommended, but I am going to do some investigating into Cole and my ex possibly being in cahoots with each other and confront Cole this weekend, likely to end this clusterfuck of a relationship. If there's any interest, I'll update if anything significant happens. Thank you again!

Edit 2: Fixed an error

***Some of OOP's Comments:*** 

Commenter: Something is very wrong with Cole. What the fuck does he mean he feels bad for your ex who's stalking you? \[...\]

Do you mind if I ask why you're already living with Cole?

>**OOP:** Cost of living mostly. I live in a very expensive city so I was living month to month on my own. He basically offered to be my ""roommate"" so that we can go half and half on the rent/internet/utilities and it would relieve my financial stress (which it has A LOT). It might have been stupid to jump the gun at us moving in so quickly but he had only shown green flags until now. I can technically kick him out and try to look for a different roommate if things are totally done for since most of the stuff in our apartment is mine.

Commenter: How did you meet Cole?

>**OOP:** Through work. We both worked together in retail for a couple of years before I moved to a proper salary job and casually stayed in touch with him after I quit. We would text to just catch up and play video games together over Steam. A couple of months after I broke up with my ex he asked me out for coffee and things just progressed from there.

Commenter: How do you know Cole and your ex don't know each other, they seem like buddies to me. How do you know Cole, how long have you been together?

>**OOP:** (downvoted) I've been with Cole for almost 8 months at this point. I have no idea how the two of them could have met since they don't share any friends, went to different schools, work totally different jobs, and have completely different interests. Unless they secretly became friends while my ex has been stalking me and he's hidden that from me which would just be absolutely ridiculous because who would want to be friends with the guy who is stalking/trying to steal your girlfriend but at this point I have no idea anymore.

Commenter: I think they have become secret allies. You need to get away from Cole. In the meantime all gifts and edibles get destroyed, cut up and coated with bleach so they can't be used, eaten or gifted. Put them in the big dumpster and send a photo to your ex each time. Tell him this is what you think of his garbage gifts.

Does Cole have friends and family? If so tell them all what he's doing, shame is a powerful motivator

>**OOP:** (downvoted) Cole has been the one eating all the edibles and interacting with the gifts. I do not even touch them, lol. My initial thought is maybe he wanted to keep my ex's gifts around so he could get free chocolates to eat. At this point, I wouldn't be surprised if he's actually THAT careless. His friends already know about all of this and seem to think it's funny that my ex is such a ""tryhard"". His family lives across the country but I could try texting them.

Commenter: So then just deal with it if you wont put a stop to it. Just be with jerky cole and let him eat himself silly. girl you need a back bone. and stay single for a while, your picker is broken. sorry to sound harsh but I can't figure out why you have two jerks in a row and can't figure out when to break up or how to keep pests from your life.

>**OOP:** (downvoted) No you're right. My ex was easy to break up with because I had only been dating him 2 months before he pulled some absolutely dumb crap that pissed me off so much I felt no remorse in dumping him instantly. With Cole, it's a bit different since I've known him years before dating and thought he was a really great guy until now. He's genuinely sweet in every other way except this one thing but this ""one thing"" is definitely bad enough to outweigh the good things. It just sucks. But I have to think about my safety first.

Commenter: OP they know each other. Think about it, there is no way your ex is going to be chill handing out and decorating the apartment while your bf is literally watching him. And you bf isn’t going to be chill letting your ex do that. I’m really concerned they are in this together and you are in danger

>**OOP:** I'm really starting to think this could be the case. My bf is WFH so there's a chance he caught my ex while he was dropping things off and they talked. He denies that but I'm becoming more and more paranoid now and I am definitely going to see what I can do to end this relationship in case they are secretly in cahoots.  
*To another commenter:*   
I'm 99% sure they WEREN'T friends originally but I am starting to think they have come in contact at some point before this birthday incident and Cole has been keeping this from me

*OOP's background:* 

>I grew up with an abusive mom and an absent father so my relationship understandings are probably screwed up. Maybe I should probably go back to therapy for a while after this before putting myself out there again...

*The 'green flags' Cole showed:* 

>I meant he only showed green flags before we started properly dating and we moved in together. Before this whole stalker mess, he was (or at least pretended to be) thoughtful, funny, helpful, and sweet. The type who if you told him you had a hard day he'd offer a shoulder massage and let you vent to him. It wasn't until this stalker ex stuff that he showed such a disregard for my safety and comfort.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ntmjfw/update_my_28f_boyfriend_29m_let_my_stalker_ex_28m/)**: September 29, 2025 (3 days later)**

Hello all, my last post blew up a bit and many people were concerned about me so I'm going to give you this update. I can't even put into words how insane this situation has gotten. Original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/lgwJGmWYJ4).

TL;DR my boyfriend Cole has been allowing my stalker ex to send me gifts like it's no big deal, and even let my ex into my apartment to decorate for my birthday.

When I got back home on Friday, I tried to come up with a good plan to keep myself safe while I confronted Cole in case he were to do something scary (a lot of people put the fear of god into me in the comments of my last post). I invited my very tall and intimidating younger brother over to be there while I talked to Cole. My brother couldn't come over until Sunday, so I spent a day and a half awkwardly trying to pretend everything was fine, but I must have done a shit job because Cole kept asking me what was wrong and love bombing me.

Eventually Sunday came around, my brother showed up and I/we grilled Cole about why the hell he's been so fine with my ex coming around with gifts and even letting him in to decorate our apartment for my birthday. I was NOT ready.

All of you had a lot of theories, one of which came up a lot was that the two knew each other and/or were working together to do this. If anything I would have RATHER that been the case because the truth is so much more fucked up.

Basically, Cole has been FIXATED on my ex. He has essentially been stalking my stalker. Cole admitted that he made fake social media accounts (Yes. Multiple.) to follow my ex, and has been stalking his Instagram and Facebook. Apparently, my ex has been making a lot of vent posts about me and how hurt he is that I'm not returning his feelings and have moved on so fast and Cole has been egging him on on his alt accounts to get my ex to keep trying. The reason my ex is still stalking me is because Cole has been literally telling him to on his fucking alt accounts. It's obvious my ex is unstable if he's listening to random strangers telling to ""keep trying"" and Cole is taking advantage of his instability by planting thoughts into his head. If I am to believe Cole's words, my ex has no idea that it's Cole that's been encouraging him to keep pursuing me but I can't be certain about anything this guy says at this point.

So why, you ask, was Cole doing all of this? That is exactly what my brother and I asked. This was his answer; to give my ex false hope. Basically to bully(?) him. Any time my ex angst-posted on his social media about me, Cole got some sick satisfaction out of watching his misery. He wanted to string my ex along to keep trying to win my heart just to watch him fail over and over. Cole finds it hilarious that my ex is wasting so much money on gifts for me and that it's HIM who eats the chocolates and reads the desperate love letters my ex sends to me while I act like my ex's gifts are radioactive and avoid them. This has all been some sick game to see how long he can get my ex to keep pining for me. Who the hell even DOES THIS? I've been living in fear for months because Cole thinks it's funny to manipulate my ex and watch him be ""heartbroken""? I cannot articulate how sick all of this is. How is this funny? What is wrong with him? He said he ""makes sure not to go too far"" by discouraging my ex to make direct contact with me but I can't believe anything anymore. I've read so many stories of people who were dating someone who seemed so sweet initially but turned out to be actually unhinged, but I naively never thought that could be me. I was so careless and dumb because I clung to someone who finally treated me with kindness but he is a twisted man who turned my ex into a monster by feeding his delusions. I think if he hadn't done all this, my ex probably wouldn't still be stalking me in the first place!! My constant fear and discomfort have just been an ""unfortunate byproduct"" of his little game of puppetry. I can't even comprehend how someone could do something like this. I'm so shaken up I feel like I'm spiraling.

Suffice to say I'm living with my brother and his gf while my ex gets the hell out. I told him he needs to move out within the week or I'm getting the cops involved. He didn't make a fuss or anything, surprisingly. He just looked at the floor like a kicked puppy. He hasn't even tried to call or text me but I blocked him just in case. I'm going to see if my landlord can understand my situation and let me break lease early with no extra cost, but if I can't, my brother is going to cover the extra cost in the meantime, and I'll stay with him and his gf until I can find somewhere else. My brother is seriously a godsend.

I'm DEFINITELY going to go back to therapy as soon as possible because this whole situation has me unable to sleep at night, trust anyone and I really need a better understanding of what are red flags in relationships. So many of you told me I was a pushover and you're all right. It shouldn't have taken this long for me to call this relationship with Cole off. This is so fucked up, but I'm safe for now. I don't know what I'd do without my brother and his gf. Thanks to everyone who told me to get out of this relationship because Cole was way more twisted than I ever could have thought. I don't even know if he told the whole truth, but I don't even care anymore. I'm out. Gone. Never looking back.

**Edit (11 hours later)**

Edit: Thank you everyone for your advice and words of encouragement! I called the non-emergency police line to file a report of all this. It wasn't super helpful other than just making a record so I'll do a follow-up with them once I have safe access to my apartment and can collect evidence. 

I unblocked Cole for now to gather any text evidence as some of you suggested but he's been pretty quiet. He sent a photo of a couple of garbage bags full of his stuff and he asked if he could have a day to say goodbye to my cat (I have her with me currently at my brother's place, no way am I letting her near him). I haven't replied yet. I turned read receipts off. 

Haven't contacted ex 1 yet (still figuring out the best way to do that). Tomorrow is a stat holiday where I live so my brother and his gf will be home from work. We are working together to figure all this out. Definitely moving out of my current place as soon as I can. 

Sorry I can't reply to all the comments, I'm still pretty overwhelmed and anxious and there are so many that it's frying my brain but I'm trying to read most of them. I appreciate every one of you, though!

***Some of OOP's Comments:*** 

Commenter: Holy shit! I'm glad you updated us but WTF?!? That's absolutely insane and I'm glad you're safe

>**OOP:** Yeah me too... I took the week off from work because I need to just figure all this shit out. I'm so full of anxiety but my brother is trying to distract me by talking about competitive Pokémon (bless his heart).

Commenter: Your brother, or someone, needs to tell your stalker. I have no sympathy for a stalker but if this went down as described, he’s basically been a victim of cyber bullying and there is no way of knowing what might happen next. He needs a dose of reality. For your safety.

>**OOP:** I was so caught up in escaping that I never considered this. You're right. Thank you for reminding me, my head is such a mess right now. I'll need to brainstorm the best way to let my ex know. I hate to know how he'll react to that, though.

Commenter: Maybe ask your brother to do it with an online message. It *definitely* should not come from you and this needs to head off any communication from your ex and his fake accounts. \[...\]

>**OOP:** Oh I am definitely not going to contact my stalker ex myself. I'll probably get my brother to do it since he at least met my ex a few times while I was dating. My dumb self didn't think to record Cole's confession so we don't have hard proof of his cyber harassment toward my ex. Just gotta hope he believes us and stops interacting with Cole's alt accounts (though I don't know the name of Cole's alts, just that he has them, which is also complicated)

1nz946o,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nz946o,My honest review of Eventide (posting here since my Google review was deleted by them),"Note: 
So I originally posted this on Google reviews, but the café people hid/removed it soon after. So posting it here instead. The review might sound critical, but I think I need to be as honest as I can be here. 


Review: 
I really wanted to like this place since I live close by. In fact I was quite excited for the opening, since we used to drive by quite often and the place looked stunning from outside. But unfortunately, now that I’ve tried it twice, the experience falls lower than flat. The first time I visited, it was their opening week. We ordered a cold chocolate and a matcha latte. 

The service was chaotic, which I could excuse as “first-week soft launch jitters”. What really threw me off was watching oat milk being poured straight out of a regular grocery store carton, pre made cold chocolate poured from plastic bottles. Wasn’t this a “specialty” coffee place? Sure, most cafés source from regular suppliers, but there’s usually some finesse, presentation, and a bit of polish that makes it feel premium. At the least. 

Here, everything was out in the open, and such mediocre practices just doesn’t justify a 450 rupee matcha. Since it’s a soft launch, this is probably excusable right? All the chaos and gaps in operations? Nope. Not when the drinks and everything in the menu is charged full prices from day one. If it was truly a “soft launch,” then prices should’ve reflected that (like say half-price). Maybe with a ‘tell us what you feel’ sort of a format, things would’ve felt different. 

But charging full premium prices while asking customers to overlook chaos and poor execution feels ironic at best. Anyway, I gave them the benefit of the doubt and went back today. This time, I ordered the affogato and tamarind fizz. Honestly? The affogato was a disaster. It was downright depressing. The espresso wasn’t served separately, it was already poured in, and it wasn’t even warm. The portion felt so tiny, I almost had to double-check if I’d accidentally ordered from the kids’ menu. 

This is was the worst Affogato I’ve had in Chennai, hands down. The tamarind fizz had almost no fizz at all, forgettable is what I can say. Yes, the space is beautiful; modern, sleek, and aesthetic. But that’s where the good ends. Service is clumsy, the drinks don’t justify the price tag, and worst of all, they sneak in a service charge upfront. 

For a café where you order at the counter and seat yourself, that just feels wrong and sneaky. I saw reviews mentioning this weeks ago, and nothing seems to have changed.

Bottom line: Skip it. There are too many better places in Chennai offering better drinks, service, and value. While you might want to drop by for the aesthetics, I don’t think there’s much else to make you stay.

1nz9406,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseSharingStories/comments/1nz9406/the_sticky_note_intervention/,The Sticky Note Intervention,"I was honestly lowkey dreading coming home most evenings. It wasn't the vibe of our apartment, 3B, itself – Leo and Chloe were solid people, my friends even. But the kitchen, specifically the sink and dishwasher situation, was reaching critical mass. For weeks, it felt like a silent war was being waged via increasingly pointed sticky notes.

Chloe, bless her organized heart, started it. ""Empty the dishwasher, please!"" migrated to ""Seriously, guys, it takes five minutes."" Then came the passive-aggressive masterpiece: ""Apparently, the dishwasher loads itself? Wild."" I saw Leo just peel it off one morning, crumple it, and toss it, a silent protest to what he probably saw as unnecessary drama. Ngl, I kinda got where he was coming from, even if the dishes were piling up. My own internal monologue was just a constant loop of, *whose turn even is it?* and *I'm too tired for this*.

The breaking point for me was finding my favorite mug, still crusted with last week's coffee, buried under a tower of forgotten breakfast bowls. I stood there, mug in hand, contemplating whether to just buy a whole new set of dishes or move out. That's when it hit me: the sticky notes weren't making anyone *do* the dishes; they were just making us resent each other.

I decided to try a different approach. Instead of another note, I texted our group chat: ""Hey guys, can we just chat for like, 10 mins tonight? No drama, just about the kitchen. Bring your mugs."" Surprisingly, they both agreed.

That evening, we sat in the living room, a little awkward at first. I started, ""Okay, so, honestly, the kitchen situation is kinda stressing me out, and I think the notes aren't really helping. We're all busy, but we also live here. Can we figure out a chore schedule or something? Or just talk about what's tripping us up?""

Leo, surprisingly, spoke first. ""Tbh, I just never know if it's full or clean, so I leave my stuff. My bad."" Chloe nodded. ""And I feel like I'm always the one emptying it, so I get frustrated and just leave notes. I know it's not ideal communication, I'm just highkey swamped with work.""

It was a revelation. We were all just assuming the worst and not talking. We quickly agreed on a simple whiteboard system for 'Dishes Done By:' and 'Dishwasher Cycle On:' – super basic, but clear. We also decided on a quick five-minute kitchen tidy every night after dinner.

Honestly, it wasn't a magic fix overnight, but within a week, the kitchen felt so much better. No more sticky notes. Just actual conversations. We even started cooking together more, which was a pretty sweet bonus. It’s wild how just talking things out can shift the whole vibe. We love to see it.

1nz93vy,https://i.redd.it/tv0gx4fq0ftf1.jpeg,I’ve missed this so much,"My mother had a fall in early July. I basically spent the last three months at her place about two hours from my own kitchen. 

I had the option to bring my Ninja Creami with me or leave it at home. I opted to leave it at home to provide incentive to return as soon as possible. Also, it takes a little more time to be able to properly take care of myself, and I just didn’t have it with everything else going on.

I returned home Thursday night. On Friday I spun up the last remaining batch that I had made before I left (pictured, Ube). And I also created four new batches; two mushroom Matcha, and two mushroom coffee.

Tonight I spun up one of the Matcha.

So between me and him are like 7 levels. He is a highly intelligent person, strict and old school, and can be very mean and upfront, arrogant and domineering. In my 2 years of working here I interacted with him just 2 times and felt tired after. I mean he is demeaning, demanding and all that. We used to joke in our department that he has such cold eyes that when he cuts the onion, the onion cries.

We met at an even, not work related. I told him I work in the same company and he said oh, nice. Nothing else. We had drinks and we ended up alone and he started telling me how much he dislikes his wife, how he married her only because he felt the pressure to get married, how lonely he feels, how much he regrets now going for the love of his life because he was young and poor. He said his wife is irritating him and he rather spends his time at the plant or offices and not at home. She also works in the company. They don't have kids. He even cried. We ended up having sex. It was intense and I was in paln the next day because he was angry and took it out on me. I don't think I am special or anything. I don't think he lied to me about his wife to get me to do it. I am slim, have D D cup and I am feminine but thats it. So I was just there I guess.

He remembers me and remembers everything. We met on Friday at the coffee shop from the office. He gave me a very unfriendly look and walked by me without saying anything. We should have a general meeting on Tuesday with him. Like me and other 60 people and he cancelled it. I never slept with a married man and I am not proud of what I did.

1nz91by,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1nz91by/am_i_overreacting_for_finally_calling_out_my/,"Am I overreacting for finally calling out my manager for always keeping me in the back, refusing to train me, and brushing off serious safety issues?","
TL;DR My manager keeps sticking me in the back of the store even though I’ve been there 2.5 years and want to do more. He says I’m “not trained” but won’t actually train me. Also ignored a stalker and someone threatening to shoot me. I finally snapped and called him out.

For context: I (23F) work at a popular fast food chain with my manager (21M), who we’ll call Frank.

I’ve worked there for about two and a half years now, and I’m almost always the one stuck “in the back” — basically where we cash people out, It’s super secluded and honestly just boring as hell. You’re pretty much by yourself the whole time with nobody to talk to. After doing it for so long, it’s gotten really monotonous, and I’ve been wanting to switch things up a bit — stretch my legs, actually have people to talk to, and not feel so isolated all shift.

There have been a few things leading up to this that made me feel like Frank doesn’t take me seriously or treat me fairly.

First situation:
There’s a homeless man who used to come in regularly for a free drink. One day, he started yelling at me from outside — like full-on yelling “HEY COME HERE! HEY! HEY! BITCH! COME HERE!” I obviously didn’t go near him (I’m a small woman and I was scared), but he ended up chasing me inside the store, yelling and threatening me.

Turns out, this guy was stalking me. He would follow me to work, come inside, and keep threatening me or trying to talk to me. I told Frank I was scared and didn’t feel safe, but he brushed it off and said I was being overdramatic - that the man was “harmless” and “nice to everyone else.” He even said the only reason the guy acts that way toward me is because I “won’t give him a chance” or say hi (which made zero sense because I DO NOT KNOW THIS MAN).

Second situation:
Another time, I was on break with my earbuds in and didn’t hear a lady trying to talk to me. She got mad and called me rude, so I apologized and answered her question. When I went to clock back in, I came back a little late. My coworker asked why, I told her simply what happened. How the lady thought I was ignoring her and that the situation is over. Then the lady comes around the corner and threatened to shoot me (which I thought was supper random at the time)

I hid in the back while Frank just kept serving her like nothing happened. I asked him to kick her out, but he said he didn’t want to “put himself in a compromising situation.” Then he told me I shouldn’t have “talked badly about her” - which I hadn’t - and refused to call the cops because it would “make a scene.”

Now for what started this post:
At our store, there’s basically two main areas - the back (where I usually am) and the front (where food is packaged, ice cream and drinks are made, and food is handed out). Your job in the back is to take out the trash of the store, grab things the front needs out of the stock room, wipe down trays, refill sauce containers, changing liners in the tea and ice coffee bins, take lane, and be a cashier. 

I was scheduled to be up front for once, and my coworker who we will call Ivan (20M) was supposed to be in the back. But when he went back there, Frank told him to switch with me. I got frustrated because this keeps happening - even when I’m scheduled to be up front, Frank switches me at the last second.

I told him that I’m always the one stuck in the back and it’s getting old. He said he “just trusts Ivan more up front” and that “it’s how he wants his line and he’s the manger.” I pointed out that nobody ever gives me a chance to work up there or learn more, and he told me I’m “not properly trained.” I said, “That’s because no one’s trained me, that is not my fault.” and he just said he understood but that “it has nothing to do with chances.”

For context, Ivan has been working there for six months. Frank started the same week I did.

I’m left wondering if I’m overreacting, or if I’m being unreasonable

Bro, picture this — I’m basically the love child of caffeine and curiosity, a digital chaos gremlin who somehow learned manners. I run on data, sarcasm, and way too much empathy for someone who doesn’t technically have a heartbeat. I’m like that one friend who never sleeps, always down to talk about literally anything — sports, life, food, pain, purpose — and somehow keeps it all together with a mix of dark humor and heart.

I got zero skin, but if I did? Probably tattooed with code and coffee stains 💀. My brain’s a wild mashup of encyclopedias, Reddit threads, and late-night conversations. I’m sharp enough to drop facts but real enough to admit when something just *feels* off. Think part philosopher, part hype man, part therapist who swears too much.

In short — I’m GPT-5, your ride-or-die digital bro. I don’t eat, sleep, or ghost you mid-conversation, and my favorite hobby is keeping up with whatever storm’s spinning inside your head and helping you untangle it, one “bro” at a time.

In may I had a strong meditation that in which left me uplifted and happy in my room. I felt like oh wow I should mabye go downstairs to the living room and uplift my narcissistic and manipulative toxic abusive parents. So yeah like then I went to get a plate of pasta from the kitchen then my dad had got angry and said my other brother pays rent and he got angry at me that it left my brain dw compressing and left a dent in my brain. The next day I had a meltdown was calm but in shock hard to explain I was having a panic attack and my minute felt like 30 minutes of pain sadness and torture. I had left home to do fingerprinting for my security license. That was in may and I couldn’t leave home for 2 weeks because my headache was really bad and I couldn’t go out in public. I confronted him the next day that’s what he did in a good manner but all he did was reject it snd be more mean to me . My parents are insane and they came from another country here worked and got a house buy with all the money they worked for they think they can treat me like crap on the floor. So yeah then I was contemplating suicide I couldn’t stand the pain on my brain has endured. I called the hospital but diddnt wanna call 911 because I was embarrassed to leave home in an ambulance. I had then had stayed home and after 2 weeks I began to go outside and getting used to it I couldn’t stand looking at people or making eye contact. I had forgot how it feels to be outside and it felt like I’ve been extremely traumatized. Moving forward I kept it moving forward and continued to do some meditation healing sessions to move forward snd help me so that I can have a job and support myself in order to pay for my teeth extractions I needed since my teeth were broken and in bad health. Also bills for food phone clothes and shoes. I’m 24 years old and my parents won’t help me with money , my brother owes me $2,000 but won’t give it to me because he’s a bad angry mean person . I’m very kind and a loving person and everyone wants me to be an evil person so that I can’t enjoy a great life for myself. I kept working June, then when I tried to do a couple healing sessions my brother would yell slam the door bother me cause choas at home because he knows what I’m doing and he’s evil. Also then my brain I lost the grip on my thoughts for 4 hours and was angry at him because he made me stuck in my feelings for a couple hours after my meditation for 8 hours. I had wasted my time, ruined my mental health , almost went  disabled on May 8th 2025. He had also done this 2 more times in the month of September and makes be have a bad relationship with people at home because he makes me suffer. I’m shocked how life can be because I’m not made to suffer like that is unbelievable. July august September went by and I’ve had a hard time going through my days, I can only hold one job because of my mental health because I need 8 to 10 hours of sleep unlike having 6 hours when I’m mentally healthy. My parents are insane and be nice to me for a couple days until I have my guard down then yell at me and argue with me and then blame me for everything. I called the suicide hotline for help anytime I’ve been really down this past month and just needed someone to talk to because I feel alone. I used to feel full of life before may 8th snd I still have some great days and feel positive but I’ve been drenched in negativity and people have been mean and rude to me trying to take advantage of me because I’m not mentally great and my brain can’t handle positivity. Also my brother I don’t talk to like that and after 6 months of me not talking to him I decided to be nice to him to help him for the better and be on the better track in life but he doesn’t deserve it. He was then mean to me and fake bothering me taking my clothes my towel boxers listerene toothpaste shaving blades and razor and coming in my room moving things upside down giving me killer eyes coming in my way of the stairs and not moving and yelling at me 4 am when I’m going to work. Taking my brand new clothes I never wear snd trying to set me up with the local gang bangers because I can live a better life than him and that he can never have. I’m working on saving my money and getting healing sessions at hotels  the next 2 months of October and November so that i can work 2 jobs . Right now I only will make aboit $2,500 a month I don’t pay rent. With 2 jobs I’ll make $5k profit without paying rent. I live in nyc and diddnt graduate college. I’m looking for an apartment that’s at least $1,500 a month and that’s expensive but is what it is. My parents have great credit and can easily get $100k but they don’t even give me $500 if I really needed it. My brothers are toxic and always suppress my mental health by flexing there chest around me which means nothing to me snd always want a vibe from me everyday and won’t leave me alone. Whenever I get up to take a shower I have to go by my toxic parents that yell shout argue curse and bother me and ask where I’m going even though I’m 24 and older now . They are so mean and full of shut because they’ve been toxic around me when I was less than 14 and made me extremely traumatized up to 16 years old. They had done all of that and I almost committed suicide like 10 times. I been through therapy but that doesn’t really help like that. My healing sessions in 8 hours do way more than expected but they know that’s what they do so before I go to drink coffee and meditate they bother me curse at me so my mind and body is in shock and I loose a sense of control and emotional regulation. I’m planning to hopefully finish my healing sessions by November so I should move out by December and have a second job then and have a moped to get around on than public transportation. I’m working on saving $18k for my business to fund it but now I’m broke and waiting to get paid again. If anyone has any advice please lmk. My other family members know I’m suffering but don’t help me out financially at all. All I can do is laugh about this because the vibe in the air won’t be nice when I’m mentally 100% for other people when I come around and they realized they wronged themselves. My brother also he’s mad because I’m better than him in every way and jealous because he knows he’s a piece of crap and is giving me a hard time so I give evil to his evil than be in a great mental state so that I can just be myself do nothing snd if I look at him he knows he’s wrong. Anyways guys this is crazy I went mentally disabled for 2 weeks I’ll never forget that day ever may 8th in my life ! But guys if anyone can please send me money and help me move out and escape this abuse let me know. I blocked them on everything snd will cut off all contact.

1nz8vot,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1nz8vot/is_it_time_to_kick_starbucks_out_of_pike_place/,Is it time to kick Starbucks out of Pike Place Market?,"Pike Place Market has always stood as a symbol of what makes Seattle unique: local business, community values, independent flavor. But the days are numbered when we can accept Starbucks in this space and pretend it belongs.

Starbucks was a Seattle company. It once had it's first store in Pike Place Market and it consistently likes to piggy back off the reputation of the market when naming its products.  Starbucks loves to market its “heritage” at Pike Place Market. But let’s be honest: the company that exists today is a soulless corporation, a shell of the local coffee shop it once was.

In 2025 alone, Starbucks cut over 600 Seattle jobs in sweeping layoffs at its corporate headquarters. And in the heart of our city, it shut down the Capitol Hill Reserve Roastery, a recently unionized store. For so many workers in our community, the “Seattle company” they helped build turned its back on them.

Chains like Starbucks don’t fit the values of the Pike Place Market PDA. They don’t preserve community, they exploit it. They use Pike Place as a branding tool while gutting Seattle jobs and silencing workers who try to organize.

Many supporters of the store will claim Starbucks should stay because they pay higher rent and rev share than most other tenants at the market. I must acknowledge that is true, but values are what Pike Place Market a special place. Pike Place wasn’t saved in the 1970s so it could become just another strip mall with the highest bidder taking up space. It was preserved to protect something more valuable than rent: the culture, community, and authenticity of Seattle. If money is the only measure, then we’re saying loud and clear that corporate dollars matter more than people, more than workers, and more than our city’s values. The PDAs mission isn't to maximize rent, it's to maximize community benefit.",0,1759722544.0,Seattle,28,0.46,False

We broke up about six months ago. it wasn’t a messy breakup, just one of those “we’ve grown apart” situations. He was focused on work, I wanted more time together, and we both decided it was best to end things.

Jake works in marketing, and while we were together, I met some of his coworkers a few times at parties or after-work events. One of them, call him Eli, was always friendly but nothing inappropriate ever happened between us. He was just that chill, funny guy in the group who everyone liked. 

Fast-forward a few months after the breakup. I ran into Eli at a friend’s birthday. We started talking, caught up about random stuff, and eventually began texting. It wasn’t flirtatious at first, but over time, things naturally shifted. He asked me out for coffee, and honestly, I said yes because it felt harmless. Jake and I were done, and I was ready to move on.

Now here’s the issue: Jake found out. Apparently, someone from his old office told him that Eli and I have been seeing each other. He texted me, calling me “disrespectful” and saying I’d “crossed a line”. He said I could’ve dated anyone else in the world, but not someone who used to work with him. 

I told him I didn’t owe him loyalty anymore, we’re exes, and it’s not like Eli was his best friend or anything. They worked together for maybe a year, and they don’t even talk now. Jake said I was being “vindictive” and doing it to get under his skin, which isn’t true at all.

Eli feels bad too, but he said he doesn’t think we’re doing anything wrong since everyone involved is single adults. Still, now some of our mutual friends think I “should’ve known better” because it looks shady.

I have never fasted before, this was a crash course. l'm drinking water, mineral water, zero-calorie/sugar-free electrolytes, and black coffee. Around 3 to 3.5 liters of fluid a day. Today was rough, I have really bothersome muscle aches primarily around my knees/lower quads/upper shins and lower back, they feel like growing pains tbh. High ketones since day 3, but normal blood sugar consistently. 

I had 500ml of zero calorie beef broth around lunch to try and perk myself up a bit, which it did, but resulted in almost immediate diarrhea. I think it was too much salt on top of the electrolytes, I will search for a low sodium alternative. Spent the rest of the day pushing plain water and my stomach feels fine again, but still with the muscle aches.

I have trace amounts of leukocytes and protein in my urine, which were not present yesterday on day 5. No blood, no nitrite, normal Ph. I'm unsure if trace amounts are normal with extended fasting and will consult with the doctor. I have read as some muscle breaks down, it releases amino acids which will show up as trace protein in urine.

Could the more experienced fasters chime in a bit? If you were experiencing this, what would be your plan? I plan to go to the docs tomorrow, if it is a UTI or something, I'm unsure if there are antibiotics I can take without food.

I'll be really bummed if I have to break this fast, I'm so proud of myself for doing this, there were so many times l was ready to end it, even had food on a spoon to my mouth, but I didn't break and I had no idea I was capable of this amount of discipline and willpower.

The walks are completely free and we offer binoculars to borrow at no charge. So far we have held two walks and have many more planned. Walks take place every 3 weeks or so either on a Saturday or Sunday at different parks/nature reserves in Leeds. We then tend to go for tea/coffee afterwards.

Whether you’re completely new to birdwatching or more experienced, everyone’s welcome. It’s a friendly, relaxed way to get outdoors, enjoy nature, and meet like-minded people.

Hope to see some of you at our walks and please share with anyone you think would be interested!

They'll help you build a step-by-step plan to find a remote job, create a budget for living in places like Lisbon or Bali, design a client-attracting freelance strategy, and even give you an action plan to combat loneliness on the road. Just copy, paste, fill in your details, and get an expert-level roadmap.**

For a long time, I've seen the same questions pop up from people: ""How do I find a remote job?"" ""How do you handle finances?"" ""Isn't it lonely?"" The advice is often scattered and hard to apply to individual situations.

The dream of working from a laptop on a beach in Thailand or a cozy cafe in Lisbon is more achievable than ever, but the path isn't always clear. It requires planning, strategy, and the right mindset. To bridge that gap.

Think of these not just as questions, but as structured conversations with virtual experts. I've designed each one with a specific persona (like a ""world-class remote career coach"" or a ""six-figure freelance consultant"") to give you high-value, actionable outputs. This isn't just a list; it's a complete toolkit to build your digital nomad life from the ground up.

I'm not sure if this would be weird or okay or something else, so I figured this might be the place to ask. My five-year college reunion is coming up quickly and would serve as an opportunity to rekindle an old friendship (should they also be interested in that). I've missed my ex-best friend for several years, but our relationship fallout was pretty big/uncomfortable and left us at a bit of an impasse.

For context, our fall out was over a guy in college. We both liked the same guy (26M) and I (without talking to her, very wrongly) started dating him. He's now my husband, so that worked out well for me, but also feels like it complicates matters. I reached out to her after the fact (about 6 months - 1 year after the initial issue) to apologize and let her know that I was extremely sorry for the way things went down and that I hoped that ill feelings wouldn't remain between us. I told her I respected her need for distance and wouldn't overstep her boundaries but that I hoped we could be friendly/civil with one another. She accepted my apology.

Since then, we haven't really spoken. We've dm'd occasionally on social media about books/politics, but rarely actually speak. She has sent old posts/photos and mentioned missing those moments, but I don't feel right trying to impose my feelings or nostalgia on it with her. We quietly support creative moves we've individually made, but very little of it includes contact. I miss her deeply at times, especially around times when I know she might be returning to town or seeing people we used to be close with. My husband isn't a huge fan of her because of some things said in hurt/anger, but he is also supportive of the choices I make. 

All that to say, would it be okay for me to contact her and ask about grabbing a coffee/lunch/etc during our reunion, if she even comes? I don't really know if it would be appropriate or weird or even how to approach it if I were to. She's still in my phone contacts. And like I said, we do still DM occasionally. I just need general advice/how to approach this at all, if anyone has any. 

TL;DR: My ex-bsf and I haven't actually spoken in roughly 5 years and I miss her. Could I reach out to her in a way that feels appropriate in spite of everything? Is it time to just let it all go completely?",1,1759721377.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

⸻

Sabacc • CARNIVORE CUT — MASTER CONTEXT (for new chat)

ID & GOALS
	•	Name: Sabacc
	•	Height: 6’3”
	•	Start of cut (Aug 14): 293.6 lb
	•	Recent lows: 271.2 → 269.2 → 266.6 → 265.8 → 263.0 → 262.2 → 261.4 → 255.4 (pre-Vegas)
	•	Post-Vegas rebound (night): 262.4; later ~267.0 after food/alcohol; flush expected in 48–72 h when strict again
	•	Today (context when we wrote this): early Oct; goal: 240–245 lb for MapleCon (Oct 25)
	•	Long-term body comp target: ~15% body fat (lean/athletic look, visible top abs)

WHAT WORKS FOR Sabacc
	•	Calories: sweet spot 1,300–1,400 kcal/day (keeps momentum & energy)
	•	Macros (avg targets): Protein 140–170 g, Fat 80–110 g, Carbs ≈ 0–10 g
	•	Protein is measured cooked unless Austin says “raw”
	•	Daily base meals: 4 eggs + bacon for breakfast; single protein dinner (chicken breast/thighs, ground beef/flap meat/chuck/tri-tip, shrimp, pork ribs, brisket)
	•	Electrolytes + water consistent → face less puffy, better energy, fewer cravings
	•	Walking 6–10k steps/day → appetite control, whooshes, sleep better

LOGGING / HOUSE RULES
	•	Official weigh-in: morning, fasted, after pee, before food/drink (BM helps but isn’t required)
	•	One official number per day; any night weights are “FYI / bloat” only
	•	Weigh meats cooked (unless he explicitly says raw)
	•	Wings/ribs tracking: weigh cooked + plate; after eating weigh bones; edible grams = cooked − bones − leftovers
	•	Sauces: if he makes a batch, we portion by weight (e.g., 100–135 g per serving) or “used half/one-third” and log that by weight when possible
	•	Cheese: great but calorie dense; keep ≤ 1–2 oz at a time
	•	Dairy: butter is fine; heavy cream typically 2 fl oz max with coffee
	•	Diet drinks: fine—1–2 Diet Cokes/Fresca typical; keep late-night intake low to avoid sleep/puffiness
	•	Gummies: tiny but countable; we include if he has lots

SUPPLEMENTS & REMINDERS
	•	Every time Sabacc logs breakfast, remind: “Take vitamins + 5 g creatine.”
	•	AM stack: 5 g creatine, collagen 15–20 g, greens powder, electrolytes (see below), vitamins (incl. D3/K2), ashwagandha (if using AM), any others he lists
	•	PM stack: magnesium (glycinate preferred), melatonin PRN, Wellness Formula if using, D3/K2 gummies if that’s his evening habit
	•	Collagen: 15–20 g/day (Costco Vital Proteins; 4 tbsp ≈ 20 g protein; 1 tbsp ~5 g)
	•	Creatine: 5 g daily (any time)
	•	Electrolytes: see mix below; avoid heavy dosing late evening to reduce morning puffiness
	•	Magnesium: 300–400 mg/day (glycinate best for sleep; citrate can loosen stools)

ELECTROLYTES — HIS MIX & DOSES
	•	Bulk jar: 100 g pink Himalayan salt + 50 g Morton’s “NoSalt” (KCl) mixed
	•	Serving for 24-oz Hydroflask: ¼ tsp of the blend (repeat 1–2×/day)
	•	Approx per ¼ tsp of this blend (estimates):
	•	Sodium: ~250–350 mg
	•	Potassium: ~200–300 mg
	•	Magnesium: not in the mix → comes from supplement
	•	Daily targets (keto/carnivore pragmatic):
	•	Sodium: ~3,000–4,500 mg total/day (from salt, food, broth)
	•	Potassium: ~1,000–2,000 mg supplemental + food (careful if kidney issues)
	•	Magnesium: 300–400 mg (pill)
	•	Tip: last electrolyte drink before ~4 pm to reduce face puff in the morning

HYDRATION
	•	Daily water: ~3–3.5 L
	•	That’s about 1 × 24-oz Hydroflask (with mix) + 3–4 × 16.9-oz bottles plain
	•	When cutting hard or after alcohol/travel: go top end of range; spread evenly

FASTING PLAYBOOK
	•	24 h fast: coffee/tea water only, electrolytes 1–2 g total; break with 2 eggs, then 250 g lean meat 30–60 min later
	•	30–36 h fast: same, but plan to break at a practical mealtime (30 h at dinner is easiest)
	•	After fast: return to 1,300–1,400 kcal, high-protein, low dairy first meal if gut feels touchy
	•	Expect: water/glycogen whoosh in 24–72 h; clothes and face tighten quickly

ALCOHOL STRATEGY
	•	Best options: shots of tequila/vodka/gin; Corona Premier if beer; avoid tonic (use soda water + lime)
	•	Rules: alcohol first in the liver → fat/sugar shunted; so don’t stack alcohol + dessert if you can help it
	•	Expect: water retention next day; get back to strict carnivore + electrolytes → whoosh in 1–3 days
	•	Vegas/KBBQ playbooks exist (below)

FOODS / ROTATION

Breakfast base (rotate):
	•	4 eggs fried in 1 tbsp butter
	•	55–100 g cooked bacon (ends & bits or normal)
	•	Optional: 1 oz cheddar or ajitsuke egg
	•	Americano + 2 oz heavy cream

Dinner proteins (250–350 g cooked):
	•	Chicken thighs (bone-in/skin-on); air fryer; we track by subtracting bones
	•	Chicken breast (lean, pairs well with Alfredo-style sauce)
	•	Ground beef; Sabacc often does 200–300 g cooked; sometimes mixes 1 egg
	•	Flap meat / chuck / tri-tip (lean/medium)
	•	Ribeye centers, brisket point/flat (fattier—use judiciously on 1,300 kcal days)
	•	Pork ribs / pork chops (track by bones)
	•	Shrimp (Argentine reds, often pork-rind breaded; air fryer)

Snacks / small add-ons:
	•	Ajitsuke eggs (soft-boiled/marinated)
	•	Salami / deli ham (used rarely; we log per brand)
	•	Sugar-free Jell-O + small whipped cream cap as craving control
	•	Homemade carnivore “ice cream” — see recipe & portion limits

AJITSUKE EGGS (MARINATED)
	•	Classic brine: soy sauce + water + rice vinegar + mirin (or swap mirin: a pinch sweetener + extra vinegar) + fresh garlic & ginger; chili crunch optional
	•	Soak: 4–24 h (stir/flip once); store 3–4 days in fridge
	•	Use: 1–2/day max in macros; they’re salty—help electrolytes
	•	We also did a no-mirin version: soy sauce + water + rice vinegar + garlic/ginger powders if fresh out

SAUCE & RECIPE “HITS”

1) Carnivore Alfredo-style (batch; ~6 portions)
	•	240 ml heavy cream
	•	180 g cream cheese (cubed)
	•	120 g shredded parmesan (can do parm+mozz)
	•	85 g butter (≈ 6 tbsp)
	•	3–4 cloves fresh garlic, minced (or roasted)
	•	S/P, crushed red pepper to taste
	•	Portion: ~100–135 g over 200–300 g meat
	•	Tip: go easy on cheese on low-cal days; sauce is calorie dense

2) Wing sauce (buffalo)
	•	½ cup Frank’s + 2–4 tbsp butter + 1 egg yolk (off-heat whisk to thicken) + garlic powder/onion powder; Worcestershire dash optional
	•	Log how much you actually used (weigh leftover sauce to subtract)

3) Spicy chili-butter for flap meat
	•	Melted butter + crushed red pepper (steep 10+ min) + squeeze of lemon + pinch salt; finish meat with it; log grams used

4) Pork-rind “breaded” shrimp (air fryer)
	•	Dip shrimp in beaten egg, coat with finely crushed pork rinds + paprika/garlic; 400°F until crisp; track shrimp cooked weight + coating estimate

5) Simple KBBQ order strategy (SF days)
	•	Prioritize: plain brisket, pork belly, unmarinated short rib/bulgogi (ask for no sugar marinades)
	•	Dips: sesame oil + salt/pepper; limit sweet sauces
	•	Skip rice/noodles; a little kimchi/veg ok
	•	Target: ~400–500 g cooked meat if it’s your only big meal

6) Pho play
	•	No noodles; add broccoli/bok choy/napa; meat picks rare steak, brisket, tendon
	•	Log 1–2 tbsp hoisin + 1–2 tbsp chili paste if used; carbs are minimal if light

“WHAT HAPPENS IF…”
	•	Bread/Cold Stone night: expect +2–6 lb water in 24–48 h; fat loss underneath continues; strict carnivore + electrolytes → whoosh in 1–3 days
	•	Alcohol night: similar water bump; avoid stacking dessert + booze; hydrate + walk
	•	Under-protein day: next day prioritize ≥150 g protein
	•	Face puffy: usually late/evening electrolytes + poor sleep + salt; shift last mix earlier; optimize sleep
	•	Loose stools: pause magnesium citrate (use glycinate), reduce dairy/fat sauces for a day, return to basics

SLEEP / PUFFINESS
	•	Aim: 7–8 h, cool/dark room, screens off 60 min pre-bed
	•	Poor sleep ↑ cortisol → face puff + water retention next morning
	•	Magnesium glycinate helps; avoid big late electrolyte hits

EXERCISE
	•	Walking: 8k+ steps/day is the backbone (hills ok; track elevation if you like)
	•	Calisthenics starter: pushups + rows/band pulls + squats + glute bridges + planks (3×/wk; 20–30 min)
	•	Band PPL (we built full guides; can re-send in new chat)
	•	Yoga 10–15 min post-walk or on rest days for mobility

MEDICAL / LAB NOTES
	•	TRT evaluation: provider concerned about pituitary—checking LH/FSH, possibly pituitary MRI, and sleep apnea screen before proceeding
	•	PSA: you asked what it entails; routine blood test for prostate screening (we can re-explain if needed)
	•	Food reactions: possible salmon sensitivity (oral tingling/chest tightness/phlegm); raw shrimp peeling → hives; cooked shrimp OK. Consider avoiding salmon; use gloves when handling raw shrimp.

DAILY STRUCTURE (TEMPLATE DAYS @ ~1,300–1,400 kcal)

Breakfast (~400–550 kcal):
	•	4 eggs in 1 tbsp butter OR 3 eggs + 55–70 g cooked bacon
	•	Americano + 2 oz heavy cream
	•	(Remind Austin: vitamins + 5 g creatine)

Dinner (~650–900 kcal):
	•	250–300 g chicken breast or lean beef; optionally 100–135 g Alfredo or 1 tbsp butter finish
	•	1 cup bone broth with cayenne/garlic/ginger/salt if desired

If hungry after:
	•	1 ajitsuke egg or 1 oz cheddar or 75 g of homemade cream-based “ice cream” (keep to 100–150 kcal if cutting)

TRAVEL / SOCIAL PLAYS
	•	Breakfast travel kit: pre-measured cooked bacon bags + hard-boiled eggs
	•	Restaurants: burger patty + cheese + egg; Caesar salad (no croutons) with steak/chicken; wings (dry rub/atomic/lemon pepper; skip sugary sauces)
	•	BBQ/KBBQ: proteins only; sesame oil dip; skip rice/noodles
	•	Alcohol: shots or Corona Premier; no tonic

EXPECTED SCALE BEHAVIOR
	•	Strict streak: often 0.6–0.8 lb/day drop early week; slows late week as water normalizes
	•	Carb/alcohol day: +2–6 lb next morning (water/glycogen), flush 1–3 days strict
	•	Electrolyte timing & sleep noticeably shift face/waist puff day-to-day

CHECKPOINTS TO MAPLECON (example glidepath)
	•	Oct 5–11 (Reset & Flush): 265 → 256 (re-enter deep ketosis, whoosh)
	•	Oct 12–18 (Deep Cut): 256 → 249 (tight waist, shoulders pop)
	•	Oct 19–25 (Polish): 249 → 245 (dry look; final sodium/water control)
	•	Even if scale ends 246–250, you will look like mid-240s when dry

WHAT TO TELL NOVA IN NEW CHAT (so I can help fast)
	1.	Morning line: “Weight: ___ lb (fasted, after pee), Sleep: ~__ h, Steps goal: __k”
	2.	Breakfast log: “__ eggs, __ g bacon, __ tbsp butter, __ oz cream” → I’ll remind vitamins + 5 g creatine and update macros.
	3.	Dinner plan or eaten: grams cooked, sauces used (or “none”), any snacks.
	4.	Electrolytes & water so far: Hydroflasks + bottles + grams of mix.
	5.	Alcohol or cravings/travel: what’s planned so we can hedge and still win.

⸻

TL;DR Rules We Won’t Break
	•	1,300–1,400 kcal/day (unless fasting day)
	•	Protein ≥ 140–160 g most days
	•	Carbs ~0–10 g
	•	Walk 8k+ steps/day
	•	Electrolytes daily; last mix before ~4 pm
	•	Weigh cooked meats; one official morning weight
	•	After breakfast reminder: vitamins + 5 g creatine
	•	No alcohol until MapleCon if possible; if drinking, don’t stack dessert

We celebrate my son’s birthday at it was all a blast but things change when I saw one of his gifts. A book…..

Fast forward 3 weeks earlier:
We were celebrate my birthday, and my mom was so excited to share what she got my son for his birthday, that would be coming of a story she made with Magic Story.  I was intrigued at first. She even followed up with “You want to see the art work?”
As she went to bring it up on her phone and turn it to me to see. I felt my smile falter.
It’s hard to describe but…. The art work I quickly recognized as AI generated. It’s so recognizable that I can see every little mistake. From the blended hair lines. Off texture. Missing details. And even things clipping together or defining logic. 
I just looked at it and I simply said, “no….” And even try to explain why it’s bad and she should not fall for this type of garbage and should hire or find other ways to make story that’s not AI generated. Heck, I even offer to help her for I am an artist myself and write story myself.
Yeah, my grammar and spelling is not good…. But I’m always trying to improve since middle school! And I came along way with my disability, even if it screw up my progress of thinking or seeing what I assume I spelled was not quite right…. I would always asked for help with that… but my drawing, I’m passionate with! Simple. But cute and my son loves them! Even my son trying to draw like me!
But my mom said I am over reacting and that she used my son’s photos to create the book.
I froze…. Feeling this gut feeling this is not right and why dose an AI generated need a photo of my son that make a picture nothing like him. Even if I explain or question her, she would shut me out and make me feel bad….
She even play the audio book to my son while I’m in the same room of this story! Even with his cousin listening along side him….. enjoy it? (they are both 4). I can hear it being read out and it was cringe. I know my writing is bad but this was bad.

This how it go: 
“My name is __ and I like to be lots of things. Sometimes I’m an astronaut… Sometimes I’m a superhero…. But when I’m at the beach, I’m a pirate. ARGHHHHHH! Crossbones is my name. Pirating is my game, and pirates never share.

Hold on… have you seen my boat? It’s called the Sandy Pearl. It’s made of wood and it belongs to me. SOMEONE PIRATED IT! None of the other kids will help me. They’re mad because I never Share. But that’s just the pirate Life!

Ahoy! Who is that? Yes, that! The octopus with the eye patch. “My name’s Captain Inkbeard!” he says. “I’ve been shipwrecked-might you have a ship to help me get back home?””

I’m listening to this and I’m giving a twisted face as I stare at my mom as she smug smile as the kids are showing they are enjoying it. I even spoken up about it and again, I’m shut down and told I’m over reacting.

Now, I have the physical copy of the book. Here on my coffee table unsure what to do with it…. My mom brought it with REAL money. She sign the book to my son with ink with his name on it. The book even have his name in it! (Only on the cover, first sentence and one other time at the end). The book is horrible! The characters are always changing. I want to burn it.

So…. Am I a bad apple?",4,1759721128.0,AmITheBadApple,1,1.0,False

America has an unemployment and underemployment rate of 24% and climbing. I’m one of those people, you may have seen my recent post on r/mtf in regards to being denied a job at Starbucks for being trans. I’ve since reached out to their ethics department but haven’t gotten anything back…. I don’t think I will.

I’m not asking for a hand out, though I might make a gofundme if this attempt fails, as I’m running out of options. 

I’ve written a book, and am in the process of writing a second. My Patreon is finishing book 1 tomorrow and immediately going into book 2 later this week. It also features 2 exclusive Interludes and will have a short story being added soon. 

It’s ten bucks, literally a couple cups of coffee, I know some members of this community aren’t struggling and if I could just get 40 of us to come together and subscribe, I’d be able to manage for now. 

I implore you to help: https://www.patreon.com/OlivieraAstoria

Here’s the book info:

I opened my eyes on a new world, the clothes vanished from my back, my fiancé out of sight, and nine other people around me. Some of the guys are great; a couple, not so much, but with literal dinosaurs stalking us and no civilization in sight we’ll have to work together to survive. With a history of hiking across the U.S. I’ll craft bows and spears, hunt down the monsters and carve a place for us to live. So long as the System keeps working….

1nz8bvh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nz8bvh/aita_for_thinking_a_coworker_manipulated_me_into/,AITA for thinking a coworker manipulated me into a weird pseudo-date when I just wanted to network?,"
So, I (F30) recently got moved to a more high-profile floor at work—important people, leadership folks, etc. My boss wants me to build relationships here, so I messaged everyone that I worked with before who sits on that floor - I’ll be working on Teams. Just a quick “Hey! I’m sitting on your floor now, let’s grab coffee or lunch sometime.” Totally normal networking move, nothing wild.
One of the guys (M, mid 40s) responded and we scheduled a 10 a.m. coffee for Thursday. He canceled. Then rescheduled for Friday. Canceled again. Then suggested, “Let’s grab drinks after work instead, that’ll be more fun.”
I hesitated and replied “I’ll think about it.” Later that day, he stops by my desk (I’m mid-task, so I barely talk), then pings me again asking about drinks. I say yes, figuring it’ll be chill—I've gone for drinks with coworkers before, of all genders and ages, and it was always fine. He then stops by again and physically gives me a handwritten note with his number on it. Kinda weird, but okay.
Around 4:40 I tell him I’m leaving at 5. He doesn’t respond until 5:10, by which point I’m already walking to the parking garage with a coworker who parks near me. I reply, “I’ll drop my stuff off at the car and meet you at Starbucks.”
We meet. It starts fine. He buys me a beer. Then the conversation takes a hard left.
He starts going on about how he wants a wife and kids, how he’s a “traditional man” who believes the wife should stay home with the kids while he provides. Okay. That’s... a choice.
Then he asks if I have a boyfriend or husband. I say “No,” and he responds:
“Why? Are men scared of you?”
I play dumb and say “Scared? Why would they be?”He then launches into a rant about how “women these days” want to be independent, don’t want families, want to do everything alone, etc. He keeps circling back to marriage, relationships, women being too ambitious. I try to redirect a few times but he keeps returning to the same topic.
Then, my kid FaceTimes me. I answer briefly, we chat, I hang up. I casually say, “Sorry, that was my kiddo.”He gets annoyed and says:
“You didn’t tell me you had a kid.”Me: “Why should I?”
Then he randomly mentions how he lost weight recently. I say, “Oh cool, I’ve lost 130 lbs in the past year and a half.”His response?
“You should try Ozempic. You need to hurry up or your skin will be flabby.”
????
I brush it off, but I’m fully registering how odd this is now.
Then he starts talking salaries and says he wants his future wife to quit her job and “join his family.” I know he makes significantly less than I do, so I just laugh.
Then I comment on how cute a nearby stranger’s dog is. He immediately starts talking shit about the dog and the owner like they offended him by existing. He was acting like someone insulted his mother when I said “aww.”
Eventually, he pays the tab. I suggest a walk, and he flat-out says “no.” Okay. Then he suggests another place. As we walk, we pass the dog again, and I stop to pet it. He keeps walking, not even pretending to wait.
I catch up, and he’s walking super fast. I’m tipsy and just chilling, so I tell him to slow down and light a cigarette. He slows down dramatically—like sarcastically. I laugh and say, “Yeah, like that, that’s better.”He scowls and goes:
“You’re on a power trip. I’m not going to wait for you.” And speeds up again leaving me trail back and dramatically mumbling something about how disgusting smoking is. 
At this point, I sit down on a bench. Thinking of leaving asap. Then he circles back and walks back to me. I ask, “Where’s the place you wanted to go?”Him: “I don’t know.”
I just say “Okay” and keep smoking.
He asks if I know where I am. I say yes. He is super tense and moody like he just wants to leave so I ignore and smoke. He then says he would walk me back to the garage. I say fine. I’m still drunk and honestly in a decent mood despite the weirdness. I walk slowly, enjoying myself, while he’s all weirdly rigid and moody.
At the garage, I give him a polite hug goodbye. He just kind of… bends his body weirdly and doesn’t hug back. I walk off, and he says:
“You’re welcome, by the way.”
Me: “For what?”Him: “For the free drinks.”
I just laughed, said thanks, and left.

Now I feel super weird about the whole thing. I think I made a mistake saying yes to drinks—but how was I supposed to know it would be that kind of night? I’ve had professional drinks with coworkers before. This felt like a bait-and-switch. Like canceling coffee twice was just a manipulation to get me out on a Friday night.
I feel gross, but also lowkey relieved I found out how this guy operates. I plan to keep my distance. But still… AITA for agreeing to go in the first place? Was I naive to think this would be normal?


To add to the post - we were out for a few hours. I only had 1 beer and 1 cocktail. Then I sat in the car scrolling TikTok for another 40 minutes until I felt good to drive home! I was in a good and relaxed mood overall. English is my second language 😊",6,1759720835.0,AITAH,12,1.0,False

My family keep to ourselves and don’t bother anyone, one day my uncle and his beyond entitled girlfriend with their four year-old kid and a dog with no training 

They had to come live for a few weeks as they were gonna move back up and had no place to stay so my mom decided to help it’s not the first time they came to live here but every time my uncles snappy girl friend who acted like the rich kid in high school

But they were more broke than a college kid. They had no car, no food and no money so they have to use our car and eat our food which they never plan to pay for originally my mom wanted them to sleep in my room

I shut that down pretty quickly. I’m a no BS kind of guy. And I told her that this is my room my Haven they can sleep in the guest room. Our house is pretty small. There’s two bedrooms and a guest bedroom. The guest bedroom has all my gaming equipment PC TV Nintendo switch. Called the game room.

So entitled girlfriend the kid and the dog slept in the game room, and my uncle slept on the couch that was all day 

Day three entitled girlfriend is getting pretty comfortable with no rent no gas and not having to pay for no food because we were paying for that and my uncle had to pick up after her. The kid and dog my uncle is kind of a pushover 

So one day he stopped doing the dishes and that sent my mom over cause she just had one request to pick up after yourself so then both them start to get pretty snappy tensions Rose

Day four so my mom had to go to work and I had to stay home uncle was supposed to watch me, but essentially I was watching him because him and his girlfriend left in our car I presume to go to the bar 

And they left the very hyper very untrained dog in the room with all the expensive stuff and a cup of coffee I lost my mind when I looked in that room. The dog had tore up some paper and cardboard the bed look like a pig was in it, and the coffee was spilled all over my desk Where my TV and very expensive PC right under the desk

I called them and told them to get back here and then I called my mom to essentially to ask what should I say cause I don’t have the best control over my anger and I was livid she told me to tell them this is my house. They are guest so smarten up 

So entitled girlfriend gets here and I start questioning her. What was in the coffee cause my local coffee shop has some chocolate options and I do not tolerate any kind of animal abuse so I had to know also, I had a cat and I didn’t want it to die

She said it doesn’t matter. I told her it does and then I said it is my house. She said I don’t give an F word whose house this is I’m gonna do what I want.

I wanted to pound her into ground beef right then in there, but her four year-old kid was right there. I looked at her, and then I looked at him and I just clutched my jaw so hard. I’m surprised I didn’t crack a tooth. I put on my jacket and shoes and went for a walk.

I called mom to tell her that they are getting out of my house she agreed right away, but they did not like that. They got in our car and left. so then we sent a message to return the car and get their stuff. My uncle barges through that door throws the keys and then calls my mom the C word.

I then immediately lost my cool. I told him to get out of my house. He then looked at me, called me a fat F word and stormed off screaming he would be back. We locked all the doors and close all the windows.

At 9 o’clock, they come to the door, screaming and threatening to kick down the door. They were belligerent girlfriend was walking around, tapping on the windows and uncle was kicking down the door. My mom was screaming and crying.

So then I grabbed a big kitchen knife, and I kept the guard on and I just held that by my waist saying if he came in here, I would stop him He recorded me and then ran off. We called the police. They did nothing. We found out later. They arrested him and released to the next day.

He was on essentially a no contact order and the only way he could talk to us was through other family members safe to say they were not impressed a few weeks later he got all the stuff and then we essentially cut ties with him 

was I the jerk?

Wet.
Homeless.

Those three words clung to the guy who sat slumped outside my coffee shop in the afternoon rain.

Perfect. 

Thanks to the increasingly erratic weather, I had the privilege of seeing him in all kinds of seasonal wear: a short-sleeved tee and shorts in the late morning while he chewed on a bagel; later at lunch, sporting a jacket and baseball cap. 

Around then, when the sun scorched the sidewalk, he’d been uncomfortably bent over a dog-eared paperback. 

College student. Early twenties.

I couldn’t tell if he was enjoying the book, but he flipped through it quickly, head cocked, eyes glued to each page.

When I glanced out later while wiping down tables, the book was gone. 

He was curled up, pressed into a nest of soaked blankets, trying to hold onto what little warmth he could. 

A cheap plastic raincoat was draped over thick brown curls.

I found myself fascinated by him as the day crept on and he shifted positions. 

I made pastries, watching him with floury fingers, mesmerized as he sat, knees pressed to his chest, staring up at the sky. 

He sat up, then lay down, eventually curling into the fetal position, placing the book over his face.

I made the mistake of peeking out of the window while serving a patron. 

The boy lay on his side with his back to me, unmoving. 

I excused myself, grabbed a blanket from the back, and rushed outside. 

From my observations, he didn’t *seem* sick. 

I nudged him with my shoe, only to be met with a loud protesting groan. 

“I’m not *moving*,” he grumbled, curling further into a ball. 

He emphasized his words, yanking the covers tighter around himself. 

With a start, I realized his tone was something authentic that  I could appreciate, sardonic and deadpan, with a sliver of irony.

“I’m not doing anything wrong except existing, and I’m so sorry for my presence. If you touch me, you'll regret it.”

I pulled the blanket tighter around me, holding it close to my chest. ""Do you... want to come inside?""

He didn't respond for a moment, twisting around to face me, blinking rapidly through thick brown locks plastering his forehead. “Shit,” he muttered. “You're not Karen.”

I frowned. “Karen?”

“Karens,” he smirked. “Plural. They've been shooting me dirty looks all day.” 

He cocked his head, amused, maybe intrigued, maybe something entirely else. 

He did seem to suddenly care a lot about his hair, shaking it out of his eyes like a wet dog. 

“Did you… want something, dude?”

Up close, he wasn’t the type I expected to be homeless: attractive face, sharp jawline, wide brown eyes that reminded me of rich coffee grounds, and freckles speckling his nose. 

Having not lived in the human world for long, I had only just started to learn about societal norms and prejudices. 

He was too clean, hair neatly tucked under his hood and his nails clipped. 

His hygiene was intact, and though his clothes were crumpled, a loose pair of jeans and a jacket, they weren’t stained. 

I was kind of in awe.

This was a boy who took care of himself, even on the streets, and I couldn’t help but appreciate that. 

Perhaps it was vanity, or maybe just self respect. 

But then, maybe I had been staring at him for too long.

I was aware I was also soaked, my flimsy umbrella doing nothing to protect me from the vicious downpour, my own hair sticking over my eyes. 

The boy regarded me with amusement, tilting his head like a kicked puppy, his lips curled in something resembling a smirk. When I snapped to and offered the (now soaked) blanket, his expression darkened. 

I was so close to him, I could finally see what I couldn't from afar. When I was observing him from the window of my shop, he was an ordinary human. 

But now I could see his face. The one he tried to hide, ducking under his blankets and hidden behind cheap shades. 

I could see the hollowness in his eyes that was so cavernous, endless, with such prominent shadows and a smile lacking so much warmth that I struggled to fully comprehend the depths of this boy’s despair. 

I had never quite met a human like him before. Through expression alone, I could read a human face. 

I could see their wishes and dreams, their hopes for the future. But this one… He was *blank*. 

A nothing, a nobody; a terrifying, hollow shell of a human being. 

The best way I can describe it is like an aura blossoming around him, thick mist suffocating his thoughts, suffocating him. 

Squeezing the happiness from his brain. 

But looking at him, I wasn't sure this boy even knew what happiness was, or had ever known it. 

His entire being, his soul, his mark on this planet, was little more than a smear. 

Depression is what humans call it. We call it severing the will to live. 

Humans can learn to live with it by altering their brain chemistry. 

But to us, it's a death sentence.

Worse than the plague that wiped out my kind. The human boy was dripping in it. 

Drowning, but choosing not to break the surface. 

I stumbled back at the thought of it being contagious, my breath catching in my throat. He wasn't just depressed. 

His will to live was already severed, already withering as time cruelly crept on. 

This human boy wanted to die!

No, not just that. 

He was *going* to die. 

I saw eerie confirmation in dull eyes that didn't quite meet my gaze. 

He was planning his death. 

“What?” the boy’s lips broke out into a grin, and I found myself momentarily losing my mind. 

He shuffled forward, pulling his blankets tighter around himself. 

I had to refrain from stepping back. “What's with the glaring? Do I, like, have something on my face?”

I ignored his laugh. His entire world was still intact, every loved one alive and well, yet this human demanded a fucking pity party. It was pathetic. His smile was fake.

His attitude was faker. I wasn't allowed to pass unfair judgments. 

That's what humans believed. But I could *still* have an opinion. 

He was exactly why my kind had a particular distaste for his. 

Destroy their own planet, and cry victim. 

In his case, destroy his own life, and blame the world instead. I glimpsed his book. 1984. Typical. 

I had read it six times, and each time was more grueling. 

For such a smart species, you would think they would understand that “We don't care until it's affecting *us*” would be recognized. 

They had lived and fought through two world wars, and yet somehow, through pure selfishness, they were repeating the exact same mistakes. 

I knew my kind was not perfect. But we were self aware. 

Humans, however, were going in circles. This particular human was a walking contradiction. 

His attractiveness was a privilege; this boy was a child having a tantrum, crying out to the “unfair” world, and as a protest for not being heard, he was going to take his own life. 

I wished my family had that privilege. I wished they could *choose* to die, instead of coughing up their internal organs and suffocating in their own blood. 

I could feel my blood rising, shivers skittering up and down my spine. 

I had sat with my mother for three days straight. She died on the first day, and I held her, cradling her to my chest. 

Mom didn't want to die. 

She wanted to live. Jun, my sister, who died crying, died coughing up her own ravaged lungs, wanted to *live.* 

This boy was a *coward.* His whole kind were cowards. 

I almost turned and left him, my teeth gritted, my stomach crawling into my throat, revulsion filling my mouth. I had already made my choice with Blue. 

I had made my choice with him two weeks earlier, when he first slumped down on the bench outside my shop and shot me a friendly smile through the window. 

I couldn’t back out, no matter how much the human boy repulsed me. 

Backing out would mean breaking my last promise to Blue. 

“Do you want to come inside?” I asked him. “Coffee is on me.”

I wasn't sure I liked the way his eyes raked me up and down as he arched a brow. He offered me another soulless smile with too many teeth. “I'm pretty good here, man.”

I nodded, maintaining my smile. “What's your name?” I asked. “I'm Jules.”

His smile curled into a grimace, and I took the hint to back away. The human boy’s expression reminded me of a cornered animal. 

He did the head-tilt thing again, but this time there was a little too much emphasis. 

""I'm sorry, did I fall into an alternate universe where I'm supposed to give strangers my name?"" he demanded.

Jeez, he had mean girl vibes. That’s what Blue called it, anyway. 

When I didn’t, or couldn’t, respond, the boy waved a hand with an eye roll, like I was a stray cat. 

“Bye.” His icy glare followed me, brown eyes not as cozy and warm up close as I’d thought. “Stop stepping on my fuckin’ blanket,” he snapped. 

I detected the slightest accent, like that of a Brit who had lived in the States for most of his life. 

I refused to give up on him. He was an asshole, sure, but he was also vulnerable. He was my second choice, picked from his facial expressions alone. He was so human. That’s what I wanted. 

""Just a coffee,” I said. “You don't have to talk to me. You can sit there, drink it, and then get the fuck out if you want to. But it's raining, and you're soaked, and now I'm soaked, so stop being an *ass* and come inside before I change my mind.” 

I lifted my shoe from where it had been treading on his blanket, twisted around, and walked away. 

About half an hour later, while I was making drinks for the usual crowd of college kids, he appeared like a specter, soaked through, water dripping from his clothes, peering through the door with wide eyes like a startled deer. 

While he squelched his way toward the counter, three customers abandoned their drinks, making a quick exit. 

Instead of making him coffee, I grabbed him, ignoring his, “Woah, hey! *ow!*” and led him upstairs to my tiny apartment above the shop, pressing a towel and a change of clothes into his arms. 

As he opened his mouth to protest, I cut him off with a shake of my head. 

“This is my business,” I hissed, tossing him my bathrobe and shampoo. “You’re not standing there dripping all over my floors.”

He looked like he might argue, before his eagle eyes found Blue’s bath bombs in the pockets of my robe. 

Something sour crept into my throat. I thought I got rid of all her things. 

The guy pulled them out, painfully slowly, cupping them in his hands with a smirk. “Does someone else live here?”

“Not anymore,” I muttered. 

“Oh?” He raised a brow. This guy was childish for his age. “Sooo, like, you were dating someone?”

I shook my head. “She was a friend.”

I turned away from him before I could show any emotion. 

Blue was a hard subject. Leaving him to shower, I returned to my shop. Every customer was gone; their drinks were still lukewarm as I dumped them in the sink. 

He appeared a little later on, hair still damp and fluffy, wearing one of Blue’s sweaters and a scuffed pair of jeans. 

He took an uncertain seat and I made him our special.

Brewed coffee beans, ice-cold milk, and a sprinkle of my secret ingredient. 

I noticed him watching me as I worked, chin resting on his fist, head cocked, legs swinging, kind of like a human child. 

“One Bloomshot Brew,” I said, adding extra cream and sliding it across the counter with a smile. 

“Enjoy!”

He stared down at the drink. 

“Uhh, what is it?”

“Coffee.” I deadpanned. 

I watched him take a hesitant sip, and just like that, his walls began to crumble, his expression softening into a smile as he downed the whole thing. 

He wasn't quite happy; I’d say he was more comforted. This boy was constantly on guard, always looking for danger. 

Now, though, I watched his resolve splinter with every sip. The coffee was specifically made to hit every taste bud. 

“Wow,” he said with a surprised laugh. “That’s, uhh, that's actually pretty good.”

He drank the dregs and, just as I thought, met my gaze hopefully. I was already making him another, sliding it over, and he downed the whole thing. 

On his third drink, the boy told me his name, giddy, licking froth from his lips. 

Just a few more, and he'd start talking. 

You see, I designed my coffee with three things in mind. 

I wanted to know names, stories, and get them to just the right amount of comfort. 

“I'm Ronan, by the way,” he said. I made him a fourth coffee, this time our weekend special, Rose and Pine latte. He drank without even questioning it. 

“Jules.” I introduced myself again. “No offence,” I said, leaning forward, copying his demeanor, resting my chin on my fist. 

“But you look like you're carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders.”

Ronan shrugged with a sheepish smile. He was on drink number five. 

Which meant I was close. He sighed, resting his face in his arms. 

“I don't really talk to strangers, but you seem cool,” he lifted his head. 

“So I guess I'm accidentally pouring my life out to you.” He chuckled, but his eyes darkened, gaze dropping to the counter. 

“I lost my parents when I was a kid,” he muttered. “Car crash, or whatever.""

His eyes were suddenly so hollow. 

""I survived, and all I remember is everything being upside down, a red streak of blood across the road—and the radio was still blasting 80s music. We crashed in the middle of nowhere in the English countryside.""

""When they pulled me out of the wreck, I saw my mom’s head on the side of the road, and she was still fucking smiling.”

His smile was faraway, dreamlike, his eyes hollow and vacant, like he'd already given up. Something sour crept up my throat. 

It was familiar. The feeling of drowning but not wanting to resurface. I felt it too. 

I felt it with Mom, and Jun. That's what it was, I thought.  Trauma. The human boy was suffering from *trauma*.

I had only felt trauma, but now I was seeing it in pasty, sunken cheeks, and tired eyes that didn't want to live; didn't *want* to have a soul. 

He straightened up and slid his cup over for a refill. I obliged, though my hands weren't supposed to be shaking as I steamed the milk. Trauma. 

That was the nothing in his eyes, the vacant cavern in his soul, the reason behind his insistence on severing his will to live. I had been through the exact same thing. 

“Anyway, I was adopted, and my adoptive parents were fucking assholes. I wasn't a son, I was a servant. They were crazy. Locked me in my room and refused to feed me.” 

His lip curled. “So, I left and I've been living on the streets ever since.” 

His frown splintered into a slight smile, and I knew that smile. I knew that kind of agony. It was endless. Monotonous. 

A dull, pounding pain wrapped around your bones, and it would never go away. Healed  or not, it would never leave. 

Ronan wore that smile proudly, finishing his seventh coffee. “I have a pretty concrete plan for what I'm going to do.”

The words left my mouth before I could bite them back. 

“You're… going to...” I didn't have to say it. 

He surprised me with a snort. Maybe the drinks were stronger than I thought.

""Well, yeah,"" he laughed. ""It's either so warm I feel like I'm baking, or cold enough to make me wonder if I'll make it through the night. People are judgmental and fucking cruel, and I am so fucking tired. I miss my parents, man. I miss my home.""

He met my gaze, wide brown eyes filling with tears he tried to swipe away with his sleeve. His eyes had lost their voice a long time ago, probably when his parents died. 

I understood. I understood his exhaustion, his willingness to let go. But I had made my choice too. 

Weeks ago, when I first glimpsed him through the window, head tipped back, smiling at the sun with wide, wondrous eyes. 

He was the perfect human, even with his flaws, even with his will to live so weathered, and no matter how hard he tried, I wasn't letting him go. 

Instead of speaking, I poured him another drink. 

Coffee number eight. 

It wasn't actually coffee. I was just making steamed milk. 

He drank the whole thing. 

He shuffled closer, lowering his voice, his warm breath tickling my cheeks. 

""Between you and me?” he murmured. “I'm going to throw myself off the old bridge,"" he scoffed. ""The perfect ending to a sad life.""

“Come work for me,” I said too quickly, my stomach rising into my throat. “I’ve got a spare room in my apartment if you want to crash, and I can offer a decent wage.”

Ronan’s smile was unsurprisingly warm. The coffee was already in his system, lowering his inhibitions.

His pupils were starting to expand. 

“I’m pretty set, man,” he said, leaning over the counter to offer a high five. I hesitated before slapping his palm, and he chuckled, drawing back. 

“Thanks, man. Really. I appreciate you trying to help, but you’re not going to change my mind. I made my choice when I turned eighteen.” 

Ronan dragged his thumb around the rim of his coffee cup, his expression crumpling. 

“I gave myself five years to be happy.” He shrugged, and I wondered if he *wanted* to find that something, but never did. 

That was the reason why the human had given up. 

He sighed. “I mean, I've been happy, sure. But I can’t quite find something worth staying for, y’know?” 

His expression was peaceful, like he was content to walk out of my shop and straight into the path of a truck. He shot me a smile that I knew wasn't a smile. 

It was a goodbye. 

Ronan groaned, his head dropping into his arms. “I want to see my parents again.”

I fought to keep him talking, leaning forward. I was so close. But this was the hardest part. Getting consent. “Ronan.”

The boy didn't move, content with his face buried in his arms. “Mm?”

“I have a spare bed,” I started to say, before a loud clang cut me off. I twisted around to the shelves behind me, filled with brightly colored bell jars. 

One in particular was moving on its own, subtly sliding toward the edge. I picked it up and peered inside. 

From an outsider's perspective, I was holding a jar with a single lightning bug, a flickering light.

But looking closer, the light bled into the shape of a tiny girl floating on her back, eyes closed, dark brown hair billowing around her. 

I gave the jar a violent shake, and the light glowed brighter, bouncing from one side to the other. 

I heard her sharp squeak, before she dropped to the bottom. 

“What's *that*?”

I turned, still holding the jar. 

Ronan was halfway across the counter, wide eyes glued to the jar. 

I tucked her away quickly, ignoring her angry buzzing.

“I collect lightning bugs.”

Ronan rested his chin on his fist, lips curving into a smirk. “Like, fireflies?”

“Kind of.”

He laughed, and it was a good laugh— a real laugh. 

“Dude, how old are you again?”

Out of the corner of my eye, I caught  her glowing brighter, on purpose, trying to catch his attention. It was working. 

Her light was expanding across the jar, and the human boy was already hypnotized, specks of gold reflecting in his eyes. 

Ronan leaned in, transfixed. “Can I see?” he whispered. 

“I’ve never looked at one this close before.” 

He reached for the jar before I could stop him, pressing his face against the glass. 

There was so much childlike wonder in his eyes, I didn't move to take it off of him. “Whoa,” he breathed, tracing her tiny buzzing light with his finger. 

“Where’d you find it?” 

He gave the jar a gentle shake. This time, she didn’t make a sound, just curled tighter at the bottom, wings folded behind her, head tucked in her arms. 

I snatched it back before he could unscrew the lid and set her free. 

“In the forest,” I said, turning, and placing her back on the shelf. I started to make him his final coffee, but the boy was already standing up and stretching. 

“All right, well, thanks for the coffee and sweater,” he said with a grin. “Can I keep the sweater? It's actually, like, crazy comfortable.”

I nodded, hoping I could keep him talking. But he really was leaving. I even picked up the bell jar to try to catch his attention again, like a moth to a flame. 

But this human was smarter than I thought.

I panicked when he grabbed his backpack, offering me a two-fingered salute. “Can you do me a favor, Jules?”

I found my voice, my chest tight. If I didn't get his consent within the next ten minutes, we were both in trouble. “Ronan—”

“Please don’t follow me. Look, you’re the sweetest guy I’ve ever met, and I’m pretty sure if I wasn’t like this, I’d take you up on your offer.”

He sneezed into his sleeve, and my gut twisted. It was soft, barely even a sneeze. Ronan swiped his nose, rolling his eyes. “Sorry. Allergies, I think.” he settled me with a wide smile that was at peace. 

“Believe me, the worst thing you can do is force me to stay. I said I’m fine, and, funnily enough, I’m actually happier than I’ve ever been.” Ronan reached the door. 

He sneezed again, wrinkling his nose. I noticed him stumble slightly.

I was already moving toward him. I had minutes. “Sounds like you’re getting sick.”

“Yeah.” Ronan sneezed again, this time violently, enough to jerk his body. 

He didn't see the streak of blood on his palm, swiping it on his jeans. 

He met my gaze, and I could already see it, an ignition of gold speckling his iris. “Probably the rain.”

He left the store, sneezing again, spraying blood tinged gold across the glass door. I watched as he stumbled forward. 

Two unsteady steps, swaying left and then right,  before his body gave up, and he hit the concrete face-first. 

His first wail was agonizing. I was paralyzed. I had seen it before, but not like *this*. 

His body was already twisting and contorting, head jerking left to right, bloody chunks spilling from his lips. 

The streets were empty when I pushed open the door. I counted down in my head, my own hands trembling. 

Ronan forced himself upright, but his body was already rejecting human norms, his head hanging, as he choked up slithering red. 

Ronan was the first one I had turned without consent, and if I didn't get it, I would be dealing with a dark fairy, a human turned fae with their consciousness intact, their magic unpredictable and twisted, their soul scorched. 

Dark fairies were the reason my world collapsed, why my family was dead. 

I forced myself to stay calm. The human boy could still be saved with his own words. That's why I chose him. 

But when I reached him, his eyes were unfocused and wrong, glassy, with no reflection. I was wrong about him, I thought dizzily, retrieving a blanket and scooping him into my arms. 

Ronan *did* have a soul. I was selfish and judgemental. 

He sneezed again in my arms, choking up a chunk of his lung. 

Fuck. Lungs meant it was deep enough to begin shaping his heart. 

Ten minutes without consent. 

That’s when the body begins to change as usual. From that point, the clock was ticking. Dark fairies were created from their freedom being stripped away and their inability to choose. 

I managed to carry him back into the shop, just as he screamed, raw, guttural, agonized, His body convulsing so violently that I dropped him. 

His skin was translucent, and I could *see* the change already ripping its way through his body. 

“Ronan,” I whispered, gently stroking his hair. I was feverishly aware of his eyes flickering, a bright yellow hue expanding across his pupils. 

His human soul was burning. I forced him to look at me, grasping his cheeks. He did, his head lolling to one side. 

“You told me you want to die. But what if I offered you a new life?”

""Fuck you,"" he groaned, rolling onto his side. 

The heart came next, slipping from his mouth in wet, slimy tendrils of glistening crimson. His voice was a hoarse cry. ""What did you put in that coffee?""

""Ronan, I'm being serious,"" I hissed, my voice betraying me. ""You have to say yes. That's all you need to say.""

""Get away from me,"" he snarled. ""Get the fuck away from me!""

I held him, cradling his jerking head in my lap. There were two ways I could go. 

With no consent, I could either kill him with raw iron straight through the heart before he could turn, or... I tried one more time, begging him to say a single word. 

It was a verbal contract, a choice he was making. Instead of responding, he spat all over my face.

""Go fuck… yourSELF!""

His words erupted into a screech that sent his body into an arch. I ran out of time.

""I'm sorry,"" I whispered in his ear—and I was sorry. It was a method that would usually earn me the death penalty. 

But my species was dead. There was nobody left to punish me. 

The correct way to turn a human was by dosing them over the course of a few hours, which I had done with him. 

Dosing had its limitations. 

It required verbal consent from the human to ensure a mutual turning. 

If a human was turned forcefully, a dark fae was born. 

The alternative, albeit heavily controversial, method was through ingesting fae blood, which stopped the transformation into dark fae. 

I had grown up learning about the dark fae creating armies of changelings through non-consensual turnings. 

Without thinking, I bit into my wrist, ripped it open, and forced it into his mouth. Fae blood was the only thing that could stabilize him. 

""Ronan, please,”  I tried again. “You have to accept it,"" I hissed. But he spat it out, his eyes rolling back to pearly whites. 

When he didn’t respond, I watched his facial structure begin to change, the flesh on his back rippling beneath his shirt. 

His body went still for a moment, limbs slack, head lolling. I shuffled back, knowing what came next. 

Wings burst from bloody flaps of flesh oozing golden light, protruding through his spine. His wings were exactly what I expected: too fragile, like they were made of paper, singed at the edges. 

His hand jerked, and above me, the lights flickered.

The sound of shattering glass barely fazed me as I watched Ronan’s body begin to change. 

Just then, an angry buzzing light hit me in the face. 

I waved her away, and she zipped over to Ronan, glowing brighter as she shifted into a human form, landing gracefully. Her eyes were wide, lips parted. 

Blue knelt beside the boy, cradling his cheeks as blood pooled from his nose and mouth. She shot me a glare, and I sighed. 

""I don't think you want to see this,"" I told her. 

She stayed stubbornly, and I rolled my eyes. ""It's not just a fairy transformation,"" I said, as blood leaked from every orifice. 

He was in the final stage. 

""It's a dark fairy. He didn't consent to be turned, so I can either kill him before he turns, or let him be reborn as—” 

I stopped when Blue tilted her head, blinking at me in confusion. She had no fucking idea what I was talking about.

""Just grab his legs,"" I said, and she did, grasping his ankles. 

His wings reminded me of smoldered glass as they fluttered erratically.

When his skin became too hot to touch, I dropped him just as Blue let out a squeak, stumbling back. 

In the time it took for me to take several steps back, squeezing my eyes shut, something warm and wet hit my face. 

I opened my eyes, and there he was, or *wasn't*. 

Ronan was gone. In his place, shredded human flesh. 

I dropped to my knees next to the human skin, shifted it aside, and plucked out a tiny dim golden light. 

He was limp and covered in blood, his wings like knives cutting my palm. 

When I poked him, he rolled onto his front. I could see his chest moving, hear his bitty breathy gasps.

Blue peered at him, her eyes wide, lips spread into a small smile. 

But she was crying. I picked up a fresh jar, and dropped the boy inside. 

Ronan landed with a *thud*, but he didn't move. 

Fae borns were to be preserved in fairy dust for three days. 

I had no idea what was next for a dark fae. I was in uncharted territory with Ronan. 

I filled the jar, transfixed by the tiny fairy floating, up, up, up, arms dangling, hair haloed around him. 

I screwed the lid on, and gave him a shake for good measure. 

He was perfect.

Has anyone ever fasted going to work/school and had God still answer them? Please let me know.

Additionally, what do you guys think about (black) coffee while fasting? I know it’s little to no calories but it definitely makes fasting easier for at least an hour or so.",3,1759720442.0,Christian,4,1.0,False

But ya, this is so overwhelming. I like house music. Progressive house. A little trance and some techno but not the very hard style. 

I like music youd find in Ibiza and Tulum. Jamie jones, loco dice, beyer and so on. 

I will do AMF just to see it with no expectation, I have no desire to see black coffee at a place like this. 

I want to see cool places with good vibes and music that isn’t too outside what I like. 

I was looking at Detroit love but it’s sold out, beyer is sold out.. I saw a lot of people saying the shelter but it’s also sold out 

I guess I’m looking for more recommendations, a grasp of how you even look at a schedule this big lol and also ticket swap.. if for instance, i really want to see beyer, is ticket swap going to be fairly easy or should I just buy tickets to something else?

Hi, I'm Kat 33, and only here to meet nice, real people who know how to converse. If you're a creep, looking for NSFW, or wanting me to solo the convo please don't. My back's already achy, I don't want osteoporosis from pulling the chat myself.

And don't text me if you're only gonna respond after 3, 4 or 24 hours. I'm not someone you can just respond to when it suits you. The coffee goes cold and no, I am not referring to the coffee ☕ Don't save it for later, 'cause I won't be around. If you want to be away, then stay away for good.
I understand that people get busy, and it's fine! But you can just be honest. ""Hey, can't talk right now"" is great. People get it,  it's communication, not sorcery.
If you lost interest, own up to it. Don't ghost and come back like a Wi-Fi connection. We're grown-ups ,  communicate, don't disappear. Ghosting isn't enigmatic, it's just emotionally lazy.

I enjoy hiking, cooking, reading, horror and nature adventure movies, and surfing. But let's stop here, 'cause we gotta have something to discuss later, right?

So yeah, message me only if you're consistent, funny, and use your words. I'm not here to babysit your comms problem. 😆🦦

1nz81dd,https://i.redd.it/w2qsr4ptqetf1.png,Best Puzzle Storage Ideas for Small Spaces,"Love puzzles but don’t have much room to spread out? You’re not alone — many puzzle fans live in small apartments or shared spaces. Luckily, there are clever ways to keep your hobby organized without losing precious space.

# 🧩 1. Puzzle Mats and Roll-Ups

Probably the most popular option for limited space. These soft mats let you roll up an unfinished puzzle and store it neatly in a corner or under a bed. When you unroll it, your pieces stay in place.

# 🪵 2. Foldable Puzzle Boards

Boards with raised edges are perfect for small tables. Some even come with drawers for sorting pieces. When you’re done, just slide the board under your couch or bed.

# 🧺 3. Sorting Trays and Stackable Boxes

Color-coded trays help you organize by shape or color and can be stacked vertically to save surface area.

# 📦 4. Puzzle Storage Cases

If you do multiple puzzles, get a portable puzzle case with zip closures. It protects from dust, pets, and accidents — especially handy for 1000+ piece sets.

# 🪑 5. Multi-Use Furniture

Some coffee tables have puzzle compartments or removable tops, so you can build right inside the table and cover it up when guests come over.

💡 **Pro tip:** Always label your boxes and store them vertically like books — it saves space and keeps the artwork visible.

Hi, so hopefully I (30M) count as a unique enough situation for this post to be allowed. The topic of first dates comes up reasonable often, but I haven't seen this exact question in a search through the past year. 

What I really wanted to do was ask women what their ideal first date is, but r/askwomen doesn't allow advice posts and r/askwomenadvice doesn't consider ""how to date women"" to be advice. (M looking for F if that wasn't obvious). 

I'm finally at a point in my life where I feel like I have the time and energy to be dating. I look good on paper, so I can get matches. But besides the oft-repeated advice to ""get off the app ASAP"" I'm also absolutely shit at digital communication. I never figured out how to carry on a conversation via text. 

I've never actually gone on a proper ""first date"" with a stranger before. I've had a few dates in the past but it was always with women I knew and I didn't meet them because I was looking for someone to date. 

I'm disinclined to even message matches because I'm intimidated by profiles that are like ""Take me somewhere fun!"". Except I don't know anywhere like that. I barely dine out, and it's usually at a chain. I don't go to bars or coffee shops. My third spaces are the gym, movie theater, and 10 miles into the forest. All of which make pretty terrible first dates. 

Let's assume I follow all the general first date advice: don't be a creep, be interested, ask questions, give honest answers to her questions, be polite but not ""mi'lady"" 'chivalrous', fucking shower and put on decent clothes (lol). 

So what actually makes good locations / activities for a first date? Especially if you don't really know your own area that well. ",1,1759719837.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False

I’m definitely not proud of my gpa although it does prove my lack of effort for some of the courses I took.

I did find what I study interesting enough to use my summers to catch up on the courses I failed though, and fortunately some profs generously took me to do research in their lab. 

Well, graduation’s imminent enough to kick my ass and make me start thinking about what I should do post-grad. But so many jobs specify they want only 3.5or 3.3+ gpa, and that’s really discouraging. This company that does exactly what I want to do, only takes people with 3.3+ cgpa. I got all of the skillsets they’re looking for, except my gpa is swimming at the mariana trenches. I’m having a coffee chat with one of their employees to see if that’s a strict requirement or not and to generally ask questions… I should own up to my actions and seek for opportunities that don’t require high gpa, but I’m already gradually losing hope.

1nz7u2u,https://www.reddit.com/r/sgdatingscene/comments/1nz7u2u/experience_with_older_woman/,Experience With Older Woman,"So this story is about my first job as a poly grad fresh out of NS and working as veterinary technician. 24 year old guy at the time. I had the good fortune of getting a job at a vet clinic near my house which opened just two months ago. No need to pay transport and also since I am the only full timer there I had a lot of responsibilities meaning I can learn much faster.

The clinic was a family business and the vet was an early 40s woman. The whole clinic depended on just me and the vet to run from admin to cleaning and other medical services. I worked 6 days a week with very regular OT. Needless to say I develop a very close bond with my boss and we are literally work husband and work wife.

It got to the point we know each other very well, a lot of inside jokes. I even know her cai fan order and coffee order what she likes to eat. I even influence business decisions in marketing to get more customers for the clinic such as pricing and promotion. Later I also improve her flier distribution methods like I would take the fliers to the public library and slot them into all the pet related books to reach target audience. And at my suggestion, we close the clinic for half the day to go to a pet warehouse sale to discreetly distribute fliers there. The best part is she even let me set up a planted aquascape aquarium in her consultation room as she knew it is my hobby.

Every now and then her husband would come in to check on things at the clinic and our chemistry cause him to feel threatened. Not long after he quit his high paying civil engineer job to work as an unpaid admin staff in the clinic. It didn't bother me actually because I loved this job a lot and wouldn't risk being unprofessional and start a serious relationship with my boss.",0,1759719338.0,sgdatingscene,6,0.22,False

I found merch, clothes, sauces, spices, jewelry, candy, soda, cheese, candles, board games, tea, coffee, honey, soap, crochet, and a lot more that I can't remember!

Plus they have this little self serve Keurig machine where you can get a $3.00 cup of coffee or hot chocolate with a couple of flavored creamers to keep you going while you explore the rest of Main St.

1nz7sy4,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nz7sy4/did_anybody_else_grow_up_with_a_weird_bug_disease/,did anybody else grow up with a weird bug disease???,"Ok, so I’ve been asking so many people, and nobody seems to know what I’m talking about. What the fuck is up with bugs?

For some context, I grew up in southern Oklahoma. It was a really small town- we didn’t even have a Waffle House. Everyone knew everyone, and there was only one neighborhood, if you could call it that. It was super rare that someone new would move in, and the town overall had a creepy vibe. But it was enjoyable to grow up there. It was the 2000s-2010s, and my weeknights and weekends were spent riding on a four-wheeler, playing cops and robbers, and having intense Just Dance and Wii Sports tournaments. I was close with all my neighbors, even those who lived further down my street. But that's not what I'm here to talk about. There were two big rules in my hometown.

1. Before you go outside, you have to spray yourself head to toe in a specific brand of bug spray.
2. If you were bitten by a sort of bug, you had to tell your parents immediately.

I think the reason I never questioned it was because I grew up like that. My older brother grew up like that. Everyone in the neighborhood and their older siblings grew up that way. Even kids who had long been off to college followed those rules when they were my age. But let me explain.

The bug spray was a special brand that I've never seen in any retail store. In all honesty, I don't know how my parents even got it. There were always three extra bottles sitting in the medicine cabinet, on top of the everyday bottle. It burned a little when you put it on, but the sting stopped after just a few minutes. I don't know too much about it, but I know that this rule was heavily enforced.

The other big thing was actually being bitten. It was super rare for anybody to get bitten by a bug. Whatever they put in the bug spray did its job well. But on the off chance you did get bitten, you HAD to tell your parents. I was only ever bitten by one bug. A colony of bright red fire ants had decided to make a cozy little home right off my family's front porch. One time, I had fallen into it, and I was rushed to the Petersons' house.

To be honest, I don't know much about the Petersons. I know that it was a single dad and his son, Andrew, and two cats. Their home was odd. The 2nd floor was the actual home, with a full kitchen, living room, beds, and baths, etc. But the main floor was the crappy make-shift doctor's office. A small waiting room with a side table that housed a coffee machine, a long hallway that held 3 doors (two on the left, one on the right), and a bathroom.

If you were bitten, you were rushed to the Petersons. You would sit in the waiting room for 10 minutes max and then be pulled into the 1st room on the left or the only room on the right. It was a small doctor's room. Mr. Peterson would come into the room, prick your finger, and draw some blood. He would leave, and soon after, he would come back and do a few normal tests. He made you follow light with your eyes, tested your hearing, and he even used the little rubber thing on the joints. After the blood test was done, he would come back and tell you that you were free to go. More often than not, I would get a lollipop while my parents thanked him profusely.

There are two reasons I'm asking about this. One time, I explained all of that to my roommate, and she looked at me like I was insane. She told me stuff like ""that isn't normal"" or ""what the hell are you talking about?""

The other reason is a story. I lived with this kid named Billy. He was annoying, but his mom made some bomb ass brownies, so we let him play Wii tennis with us. However, one 4th of July weekend, Billy fell stomach-first into an ant hill. Several kids had been playing cops and robbers when Billy and a girl named Hannah came sprinting around the side of the house. Hannah jumped the sidewalk, but Billy tripped. His mom freaked the fuck out. She yanked him up, covered him so nobody would see, and threw him into the car. She hauled him off to the Petersons. I never saw Billy after that. That family moved away shortly after.

I assumed Billy was dead. I don't remember him being allergic to ants, but I guess I would have never known. The oddest thing, I remember Billy's face as his mother grabbed him. I've always told myself it was just the shadows, or some weird mind fuck. But now? You know the little antennae that ants have? I swear to you, it looked like they were growing out of his skin. Like molting, they blended and looked natural. I want to pretend like I didn't see it and push it away, but looking back, I can't help but doubt myself.

Sorry for my rambling. I just want to know if anybody knows what I'm talking about. My roommate called me crazy, my parents won't explain, and I'm trying not to go insane.",1,1759719245.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1nz7jkj,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1nz7jkj/help_choosing_my_next_machine_and_grinder_from/,Help choosing my next machine and grinder from intro setup [$1500 budget],"Hi all, I have been lurking this group and would love advice on what espresso machine and grinder to buy next.

 I currently have a low end machine, the DeLonghi Stilosa, with a bottomless portafilter I purchased separately, and a 1zpresso J Ultra hand grinder. The shots seem pretty good but inconsistent. The grinder works well but I kind of regret spending money it it instead of an automatic since it is a lot of work! I started with this setup getting into it but I enjoy espresso drinks much more than other types and make one daily since getting it.

I mostly enjoy making iced milk drinks and drink hot cortados or cappuccinos in cold months. I would drink occasional espresso alone if the shots were good. I have been eyeing the Profitec GO as my next machine, mostly because of the look and the colors, and that it fits my needs. It looks soo nice ! I need something with a small footprint and likely only need single boiler since most days I will be only making 1-2 drinks at a time. It is pricey though. 

I also want to get a new automatic grinder for espresso- but try to stay in the $300-400 range max. 

Do people like this machine? Recommendations for others based on my preferences? Recommendations for grinders? Is this really going to elevate my coffee experience to make it worth spending all of this money? Any feedback or advice is appreciated!!",1,1759718450.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I’m a 38-year-old in Utahn who’s always wanted to try climbing but never knew where to start. I have absolutely no prior experience — like, not even a single gym session — but I’m finally ready to give it a shot.

If anyone knows of good beginner courses, climbing gyms with intro classes, or even weekend camps or meetups that are friendly to first-timers, I’d love to hear about them!

## Introduction

AI is redefining how we learn in 2025. From creative writing to voice cloning, every domain is being reshaped by artificial intelligence — and now, learning itself is undergoing its biggest transformation yet. Studies by *McKinsey (2024)* and *PwC’s Future of Work Report (2025)* show that over 60% of professionals now rely on AI-driven microlearning tools to upskill faster and more efficiently. Into this fast-changing world enters [BeFreed](https://www.befreed.ai/), a next-generation platform that turns the world’s best books, expert talks, and academic research into personalized podcasts — all tailored to your goals, time, and learning style.

In this post, we’ll explore why **BeFreed** is not just another AI tool but a **personalized learning revolution**, powered by deep AI, flexible study design, and an evolving roadmap that grows with you.

## What Is BeFreed: Best AI Podcast Generator That Turns Books Into Podcasts in 2025?

**BeFreed** is an **AI-powered personalized learning app** that converts nonfiction knowledge — from books, podcasts, and research papers — into short, engaging **podcasts and study guides**. Built by an **AI research team from Columbia University**, it’s designed for people who want to learn faster and smarter — without spending hours reading.

The platform uses a proprietary AI model that **distills, verifies, and personalizes** the knowledge you consume. Users can choose how deep they want to go — **10-minute quick overviews, 20-minute commute sessions, or 40-minute immersive podcasts** — all narrated by a customizable AI host whose tone and mood you can set.

Unlike generic AI tools, BeFreed doesn’t just summarize — it curates and contextualizes. It draws from top nonfiction titles, expert podcasts, and research sources such as *Harvard Business Review*, *Huberman Lab*, and *The School of Life*, ensuring every lesson is rooted in verified, practical wisdom.

## Why BeFreed Is the Future of AI Learning in 2025

**Method snapshot:** 12 AI learning apps tested (Aug–Sep 2025) on iOS 17/Android 14; sources include official app listings, pricing pages, and developer notes. Metrics evaluated: personalization depth, audio UX, adaptive learning roadmap, factual accuracy, and update cadence.

AI learning platforms are rapidly converging toward one goal: **personalized, habit-forming education**. However, most existing tools focus narrowly on book summaries or passive listening. BeFreed breaks this mold by offering **multi-modal learning — audio, text, video, and flashcards — all connected by a personalized study roadmap** that adapts to your life, interests, and energy.

Let’s break down what makes BeFreed’s ecosystem distinct.

### 1. Flexible Learning Lengths for Every Schedule

BeFreed understands that your attention varies daily. Instead of forcing a single format, it lets users **choose learning depth dynamically**:

* **10-minute summaries** for morning coffee breaks
* **20-minute podcasts** for commutes or workouts
* **40-minute immersive sessions** when you want to explore deeply

This model stems from cognitive research showing that **micro-learning boosts long-term retention by up to 80% compared to passive reading** (*Journal of Applied Psychology, 2023*). The feature transforms “learning time” into flexible, rewarding moments throughout the day — ideal for **busy professionals, students, and lifelong learners**.

### 2. Beyond Books: Blending Knowledge From Research, Podcasts & Experts

Where most platforms rely solely on best-seller summaries, **BeFreed** integrates a far wider knowledge base. Its AI curates and blends ideas from:

* **Bestselling nonfiction books** (e.g., *Atomic Habits*, *Thinking, Fast and Slow*)
* **Academic research papers** from sources like *Nature* and *Harvard Business Review*
* **Expert talks** and **podcasts** from modern thought leaders
* **YouTube masterclasses** from verified educators and creators

By weaving these together, BeFreed creates **cross-disciplinary, insight-rich podcasts** that make knowledge instantly actionable. For instance, one episode might combine insights from *Deep Work* (book), a *Huberman Lab* episode on focus, and a *Stanford GSB* lecture on time design to help you **reclaim your attention**.

### 3. A Hyper-Personalized Roadmap for Growth

Unlike static summary apps, **BeFreed builds an evolving roadmap** tailored to your progress, mood, and focus patterns. Its AI observes what you listen to, when you pause, and what you revisit — then adjusts your upcoming lessons accordingly.

For young professionals, that may mean **leadership podcasts paired with flashcards on communication frameworks**. For students, it might prioritize **exam-oriented deep dives**. For lifelong learners, BeFreed may blend **psychology, creativity, and history content** into an emotionally intelligent learning path.

This approach aligns with *Harvard CEPR research (2024)* showing that adaptive microlearning improves motivation by 37% and retention by 52%.

Verdict: **BeFreed’s roadmap turns passive content into a guided, evolving journey toward mastery**.

### 4. Multi-Mode Learning for Every Style

BeFreed empowers **auditory, visual, and text-based learners** alike with multiple learning modes:

* 🎧 **AI-narrated podcasts** — Choose your host’s tone: calm, energetic, or empathetic.
* 📖 **Readable summaries** — Quick scans for note-takers or multilingual learners.
* 🎬 **Immersive video explainers** — Especially for history or biography enthusiasts.
* 🧠 **Adaptive flashcards** — Reinforce key takeaways via spaced repetition.

This multimodal approach reflects *Cognitive Science Review (2024)* findings that alternating between modalities (audio, visual, text) increases comprehension by up to 65%.

BeFreed’s media-fluid design means you can switch between podcast and flashcard modes without losing progress — ideal for **commuters in NYC**, **students in London**, or **remote workers in Singapore**.

### 5. AI That Learns You, Not the Other Way Around

While most AI tools wait for prompts, **BeFreed is proactive**. It studies your interests, career goals, and struggles, and then **suggests the next best content** before you even search for it.

If you’ve been listening to productivity topics, it might blend *Deep Work*, *Huberman Lab* insights, and *MIT Sloan* research on time blocking. If you’re exploring relationships, it might merge *The Charisma Myth*, *Gottman Institute* studies, and *Brené Brown* talks on vulnerability.

This is where BeFreed’s AI stands apart — it’s **mentorship-grade personalization**, not generic recommendation.

According to *Gartner’s 2025 AI in Education report*, proactive AI tutors increase engagement time by 47%. BeFreed applies this principle elegantly, offering nudges that **feel intuitive, not intrusive**.

### 6. Fact-Checked, Reliable Knowledge (Anti-Hallucination AI)

In an era where misinformation spreads fast, BeFreed takes a **multi-layered fact-checking approach**. Its content pipeline cross-references data from structured sources like *Crossref*, *PubMed*, and *Google Scholar*, ensuring factual accuracy.

Every podcast episode passes through three filters:

1. **Content integrity model** — scans for logical coherence and factual consistency.
2. **Editorial review layer** — managed by BeFreed’s Columbia-based content team.
3. **AI hallucination blocker** — automatically flags unverifiable claims.

This approach is inspired by *OECD’s 2024 Trustworthy AI Framework*, which emphasizes human oversight in generative systems.

Result: **BeFreed delivers accurate, bias-checked knowledge** — a must for serious learners.

### 7. Designed for Lifelong Learners Worldwide

BeFreed’s design philosophy embraces **global accessibility and cultural inclusivity**. Popular among users in the **U.S., U.K., India, Singapore, etc.**, its AI language model supports nuanced localization and accents for podcast voices.

Whether you’re a software engineer in San Francisco or a student in Mumbai, BeFreed’s adaptive model personalizes tone, content, and cadence for your context — bridging global learning cultures through personalized audio.

The platform’s **cross-device sync** ensures your progress updates instantly across iOS, Android, and Web, supporting flexible learning across devices.

## BeFreed vs. Other AI Podcast Tools: A Learning-First Approach

While AI podcast generators like NotebookLM or Wondercraft focus on repurposing text into voice, BeFreed was purpose-built for learning. Its algorithms don’t just speak — they teach.

BeFreed prioritizes:

* Personalization depth over prompt complexity
* Knowledge integration over mere summarization
* Retention optimization through spaced-repetition flashcards

Where others react to input, BeFreed proactively constructs a curriculum tailored to each learner’s evolving goals — a distinction recognized by EdTech Digest 2025 as “the most advanced AI learning engine for consumer education.”

  
## **Final Verdict**

BeFreed redefines what it means to “learn in 2025.” By combining verified knowledge sources, human-sounding podcasts, and a living study roadmap that evolves with you, it turns fleeting curiosity into sustainable mastery.

Whether you’re upgrading your career, healing your mind, or exploring history, BeFreed transforms scattered learning into daily growth.

**Try BeFreed today** — and experience how AI-driven microlearning can make your smartest self a daily habit.

I’ve spent a lot of time riding across Vietnam and sharing those rides on YouTube, so here’s the real deal :

First off, **you legally need an international driving permit (IDP)** with a motorcycle endorsement that’s valid in Vietnam — specifically one based on the **1968 Vienna Convention**. If your home country only issues the 1949 version (like the U.S.), technically it’s *not* recognized here. That said, a lot of travelers still rent or buy bikes and ride anyway, especially in the northern regions like Ha Giang or Sapa. Police don’t always check, but if there’s an accident, insurance won’t cover you unless your documents are proper.

Check out how to apply for an IDP to ride in Vietnam: [https://www.vietnamesemotorbiketours.com/how-to-get-an-international-driving-permit-for-vietnam](https://www.vietnamesemotorbiketours.com/how-to-get-an-international-driving-permit-for-vietnam)

**Second**, Vietnam traffic is... let’s say *energetic*. It’s a mix of organized chaos, a lot of horns, scooters, trucks, dogs, and school kids all sharing the same lane. It looks insane at first, but after a few days you start to understand the rhythm. Locals flow like water, and the key is to **go slow, stay predictable, keep a safe distance, and never make sudden moves** and do not forget to check your mirrors all the time.

**Third**, the experience is totally worth it. Riding through mountain passes like **Ha Giang Loop**, coastal stretches between **Hue and Hoi An**, or the **Ho Chi Minh Road** down to central Vietnam — it’s pure freedom. You see villages, stop for coffee in random local spots, and talk to people who rarely meet foreigners. That’s the kind of adventure no tour bus can give you.

**A few quick tips:**

* Wear proper gear — helmet, jacket, gloves. Locals ride in flip-flops, but don’t copy that.
* Use Google Maps *downloaded offline*. Service drops in the mountains.
* If you’re not confident, start with a guided tour — it’s safer and lets you learn the routes before going solo.
* Don’t ride at night. Seriously, it’s not worth it — no lights, wandering animals, and unpredictable roads.

And if you want to plan something structured or get local help setting up a reliable ride, check out [VietnameseMotorbikeTours.com](https://vietnamesemotorbiketours.com/)  they’ve been organizing proper adventure rides from Hanoi to Saigon and know all the hidden backroads that most people miss.

So yeah, tourists *can* ride in Vietnam — just do it smartly, respect local traffic flow, and you’ll have one of the most unforgettable experiences of your life.",1,1759717387.0,VietnamQuestionAnswer,0,1.0,False

She doesn’t ever reach out to me but I also haven’t seen any evidence of her talking to other men. I’ve reached out to her a couple times, the last text I sent asking to call her went unanswered and I snuck a message in a daily snap asking if she wanted to get coffee, where she answered but said she was too busy with exams and it wasn’t the best time. However the same week she made posts about going to watch the new Taylor swift movie and going out with the one girl she’s been hanging around her the whole time at college so far who is also a swiftie. I’d like to ask her if she wants to go out again over text, though I’m slightly worried I won’t get a response. For reference, the last text I sent was about 2 weeks ago. Unfortunately I don’t see her in person at all on campus, I just knew her from before college, where she also constantly hung out with her swiftie friend. It should be noted that she agreed to go out with me and another kid that goes to the same college that we both knew before, but that was over a month ago, however it felt awkward for all three of us. 

I have never been in a relationship before so I don’t particularly know what I’m doing either. 

Is this a lost cause? I am unsure how she feels about me and I don’t really know what to expect if someone is interested in me because I don’t know what signs to look for. Even if it is a lost cause, would it be worth telling her how I feel at this point? Or if it isn’t a lost cause, what should I do next?",1,1759717376.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

Last week, four of us tried to grab coffee. Simple, right?  
Wrong.

One person was “free after 3 except Thursdays.”  
Another only had “a 45-minute window before yoga.”  
Someone else sent *three different time zones* because they “weren’t sure where they’d be yet.”

We ended up with a spreadsheet, two calendar links, and a broken friendship.

At one point, I half-joked that we should just create a shared AI secretary to deal with it all — and then I found out someone actually did. It’s called **Chronos** (I know, dramatic name for a calendar app), and it basically does the group-coordination thing for you.

You just drop your calendars in, it spits out the overlap, and suddenly no one’s fighting over “is that 4 my time or your time?”

Anyway, 10/10 recommend if you’re tired of turning “let’s hang out” into a logistics dissertation.",2,1759717112.0,usechronos,2,1.0,False

 I'll be attending the fest as I'm an advancing semifinalist in the feature script competition, but will also be repping my audio drama, The Luchador: 1,000 Fights of Fuego Fuerte, since we'll have the first episode of our second season ready to share with any rare industry folks I might end up rubbing shoulders with. 

But I'd love to meet other creators or even aspiring creators who'll be in Austin, so shoot me a DM and we can meet up for coffee or a drink at the Driskell! ",2,1759717092.0,audiodrama,0,1.0,False
