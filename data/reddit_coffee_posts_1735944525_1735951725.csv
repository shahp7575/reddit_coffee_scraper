ive lived in tons of areas of LA, such as santa monica, westwood, beverly hills, west hollywood, toluca lake, woodland hills, and now live south of hancock park.

i can tell you right now that being where i am, i might as well be in texas or some other state. this area sucks. ive always enjoyed the bev hills/west hollywood area and being where i am now, im NOT happy about. everything around me sucks. no good gyms, no good coffee places, lacking good restaurants, parking nightmare, closest movie theater is at the grove which is an abysmal nightmare, no decent parks, too many people (which makes no sense to me - thought the west side was more packed), general low income filthiness. 

im surprised how easy it was to park on the west side compared to here. i cant even grab a cup of coffee without having to pay for a stupid meter. larchmont village sucks (no offense).

for those of you looking for a place to live, BE SURE u get something right in the middle of where you want to be. being ‚Äúonly 3 miles away‚Äù of your ideal neighborhood is NOT gonna cut it for you. trust me.

im in the process of interviewing with a company (remote as well) and if i manage to get that, im gonna pay the fine to break the lease because I‚Äôll be making considerably more than I make now so it‚Äôll make more financial sense.

sort of a rant but this might help others who are looking for a place to be. 

by the way, the reason why i moved here was because the price for the unit was unbeatable but of course, there is always a catch. sigh.",3,1735951238.0,MovingToLosAngeles,2,1.0,False

1ht1tli,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1ht1tli/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

#Intro:

Salary: I make $120,000~ and my husband makes $110,000~. Our post-tax/deductions earnings are $1,600 2x a month for me, $1,900 2x a month for him. I pay for FSA for the kids, FSA for myself, health insurance, dental, etc., and save more into my 401k equivalent. So, per month, we take home about $7,000. We have a joint bank account, joint CC, and I handle all household financial matters other than his personal retirement.

#Assets:

Assets|Amount|

Cash| $4,000 |
Retirement (mine)| $317,000|
Retirement (husband)| $77,000|
Son's 529| $12,650| 
Son's UTMA| $9,520| 
Daughter's 529| $4,250| 
Daughter's UTMA| $2,700| 
**Total excluding kids' accounts**:|**$398,000**

I have been saving for retirement since 2016. My husband worked before 2016 but stopped until 2021. We both have decent pensions (mine is 33% of my highest income until I die and his is closer to 40% of his highest income until he dies), so I look at my retirement savings as more of something I will most likely leave to my kids. I should probably just buy real estate, but I would rather have the tax savings.

We used about $15,000 of cash this year moving. The home is not listed in assets (or debt) because my parents bought it under their name and pay for the mortgage. The condo worth is $1,200,000 (based on two almost exact ones selling in the past six months on this street). My parents pay the mortgage. Before we moved, we also lived with them (rent free).

If we put the 529 in my parents' names, it would not be counted for FAFSA. However, we make enough and honestly have enough. Our kids don't need help from the government when they have us.


#Debt:

Debt|Amount|
:--|:--:|
Student loans (husband)| $5,000 |
Car (mine)| $5,000|
Best Buy CC|$3,300|
Ikea CC|$3,000|
**Total**:|$**16,300**

My husband went back to school for four years and graduated in 2021. Most of his education was paid for via scholarship, but he took out a little bit for housing. The loans were deferred until 2023. My car, which we both use but is under my name and my dad's, should be paid off in a year or so.

Ikea CC is 24 month interest free. Best Buy CC is also 24 months interest free. We made large purchases when we moved this year. We do not use the cards for anything else. I divided the amount owed by 23 months and pay a little over that number each month.

**Total**:|**$4,595**

If I had to pay for my daughter's care ($2,000 for infant care) and mortgage+property tax+HOA fee ($3,300 + $400 + $300 = $4,000), our expenses would be $10,595. My parents take care of my daughter and pay for our living expenses, even though they are both retired.

I have not yet decided what to do when my kids are out of daycare. Do I take over the mortgage? Do I put that ~$2,000 into their 529s/investment accounts/UTMAs? I asked my parents if I could help pay for the mortgage now but they said no.

Initially, I did try to buy the house (to personally take the mortgage) but my parents insisted they buy it and wouldn't let me do it. Because the home belonged to a family member that passed away, there was no way for me to buy it without my parents agreeing. I also would have not been able to take a 15 year at 2.5% mortgage, which is what my parents have. 

Of the people I know in my city/area for whom I know the financial background: 

- one is a single man who was given their house by their parents (not sure about salary)
- one is a single woman who lives in a home owned by her parents (not sure about salary)
- one is a married couple with one kid who make slightly more than us that had their parents help with the down payment on their 1mil house
- one is a couple with one kid who make significantly more than us (more than double) - not sure about the extent of help from parents
- one is a couple with two kids who are having a tougher time (the father used to make more than us combined but makes less now and the mom stays at home) and had to use a trust fund left to them to stay afloat
- one is married couple with two kids who make more than double, who lived with their parents until recently, had medical/business school/undergrad paid by parents, and have also borrowed a bit of money (in addition to their savings) from family/parents to buy a house (they have currently have no childcare costs because grandparents take care of the kids)
- one is a married couple with one kid where the dad makes more than double what we make combined (has been in FAANG) and inherited money to purchase their home, though they'd obviously rather have their parents around

I am not saying this to downplay *my* privilege. I know I am. Many people my age who have kids and can live here tend to have some sort of family help, though I am sure I have the most. We're all lucky. (There are plenty of self-made/independent couples too.) If my husband and I had to, industry jobs would pay us 50% to 100% more, but we would rather not since government jobs are significantly less stressful and there's no overtime. We can choose this, again, thanks to my parents.

This area appreciated 20%-40% during 2021, so many people are shut out from purchasing unless they have a bit of money. A lot of all cash purchases too. I have no idea how, given that condos here are $950k to $1.2mil for older ones, $1.5mil for new ones, and small SFH are $1.7mil to $2.2mil, but I also also not a saver (as you will see).

##If you're still with me: SPENDING TIME

#FRIDAY- $172.50

8:00AM Husband gets my son, I get my daughter. I make a mocha oat milk latte at home with our espresso machine, and my husband makes omelets and slices fruit. He is WFH today but I took it off since my son is on break. 

9:30AM I take the kids to the local park to play. We run around on the jungle gym, gather pine cones, and talk about Christmas decorations. 

11:00AM We head home and the kids help me in our garden by digging up dirt as I set up the concrete blocks for planters. My mom surprises us with cherimoya and lemons. She's also here to kidnap the grandchildren for the day. Involved grandparents are the best.

12:00PM Husband and I eat leftovers from last night (Japanese A5 wagyu, potatoes, and broccolini). 

1:00PM I start a load of laundry and go to Ralph's to buy dried cranberries, mini marshmallows, two types of grapes, broccoli, potatoes, cilantro, shallots, eggplant, lemons, tomatoes, zucchini, raspberries, two kinds of tomatoes, ice cream sugar cones, chicken drumsticks, parmigiano reggiano, and goat cheese. **$86.27**

3:30PM My husband and I discuss taking down the Christmas tree (we look at the city's policy for tree pickup), but we don't do it yet. I switch the laundry to the dryer and hang a few pieces to airdry.

5:00PM For dinner, my husband roasted lamb, potatoes, and broccolini. He also made a compound butter (shallot, parsley, garlic, lemon). For dessert we have grapes - they're incredible and the kids finish the entire carton (one pound). 

6:30PM Before the kids get TV, my son and I sit down and he reads a book to me. It is a simple book that consists entirely of ""I am top cat. Am I top cat?"" on six different pages. My son can blend letters together so we have started teaching him how to read.

7:00PM The kids get 30 mins of TV (today my son picks Cars 3). They say good night to the TV and we play together until bedtime.

8:00PM We get the kids ready for bed. Our kids' bedtime routine is as follows: kids go upstairs, dad gives them both a shower, we brush their teeth, we read a little and play in my son's room. I take my daughter to her room and my husband puts my son to bed while I tuck my daughter in.

9:00PM After the kids go down, I buy a game on steam (Everholm) for **$11.99** and some earrings from Aliexpress (**$74.24**). I clean up in the kitchen/dining area.

10:00PM My husband and I hang out in our bedroom and fool around. 

11:00PM I get ready for bed (wash face, brush teeth, take out contacts). I should have a skincare routine but I don't. Maybe when the kids are older?

#SATURDAY - $79.11

8:30AM Husband and I get the kids up for the day. We have toast & fruit & a latte (for me). My makeup takes about two minutes (moisturizer, sunscreen, a single swipe of eyeshadow, and eyeliner).

9:30AM we head over to attend a holiday party at a friend's home. The hostess is fantastic. She set out activities for the kids (painting) and made a TON of food. The (six) kids played together. We have lunch (it is delicious.) She sends us home with a party bag (my daughter's has a new Tonie figurine, which my daughter immediately latches onto and listens to for the rest of the day). The host family and my family have known each other since our kids were around one. I met them at a local park, and we've been friends since. The two other families there include my friends (known the husband/dad since elementary school) and another couple with a son the same age as my son (the mom is a fantastic baker and always very careful of my daughter's anaphylactic energies). We all see each other once a week, sometimes more, since we often meet up at the park, do Halloween and Thanksgiving and Christmas events together, etc. 

I want to take a moment to really highlight that they are truly wonderful people. They are so brilliant, so kind, so thoughtful, so capable, just so amazing and I am so very grateful they are our friends. That's a lot of so.

1:00PM Kids napped and I get boba **$19.64** (espresso milk tea for husband, a milk tea for me, and a second tea for tomorrow morning). I stop by a grocery store and buy pasta and bags of discounted Twix, guilty pleasure. **$17.98**

2:00PM I wonder if I should buy a blowout brush since I do nothing with my hair. I put it on my birthday wishlist. I chop and deseed vegetables (eggplant, zucchini, sweet peppers, tomato, shallot) for dinner.

4:00PM After the kids are up from their naps, we go to the park. My son plays with another boy who happens to be two weeks older than him (I chat with the parents.) Venus is especially bright and I point it out to my kids. My son, who has 10000 questions about planets, ends our talk with ""I LIVE ON EARTH"" and runs off. My daughter loves the slide (and me), so all I do is run up and down the play area with her.

5:30PM For dinner, I make roasted vegetable pasta, a favorite for both kids (as there is a gratuitous amount of cheese) and a bit of leftover lamb. My son eats the eggplant! My daughter only wants pasta (but does try the vegetables). Dessert is more grapes. 

7:30PM The vegetable scraps are gathered and my kids and I go out back to our compost pile & bury them.

8:00PM I play with the kids in playroom, then it's bedtime for them.

8:45PM After putting my daughter in bed, I go to supermarket to pick up two cartons of the grapes they loved. I also buy ketchup, whole grain mustard (tomorrow's dinner requires whole grain and dijon), Worchester, chocolate chips for baking, green onion, ginger, and shallots. **$41.49**

9:00PM I get home, load the dishwasher, and hop onto WoW to play with my guild - we end up not raiding since most people are gone but shoot the shit while questing. I met them through a mom friend who suggested I join her guild (very understanding of parents). They're mature, respectful, fun, and casual. 

11:00PM: I log off and go downstairs to make raspberry jam with the lemons my parents brought. After I clean a little, I have yuzu sake and hang out with my husband (who is playing some persona-like game). 

12:00AM: Bedtime!

#SUNDAY - $42.50

8:30AM I wake up and take a shower while my husband gets both kids up for the day. 

9:00AM Kids have toast with butter and raspberry jam (I know, sugar), while my husband goes to buy donuts (uses a gift card for the order - $54 for a dozen) and we drive to a park to meet up with some of my friends I've known since middle school.  

9:30AM The kids play outside and eat broccoli, fruit, and donuts. I try to make a new friend for my daughter (there is another girl around my daughter's age), but the other girl is not interested so I stop. My friend bought coffee for everyone (hojicha latte for me and flat white for husband). She gifts us two books (my kids LOVE the books she's picked in the past), I gift her fancy hot chocolate (also hojicha flavored). My other friends give us a bag with toys (we do toy swaps with them since our sons are the same age). We talk a little about politics (we're upset), children, gamete donation, fostering, real estate, public/private school, and general financial investments. my two kids are with my husband, and i get to leisurely sip coffee and talk to other adults about ""grown up"" topics. 

I think how lucky i am that my parents sacrificed so much to subsidize my life (since we are talking about real estate). My friend (she's on the East Coast now and visiting for the holidays) says she would move back if her parents gave her a free house. 

1:00PM: Because we are at the park all day, we get MCD for kids and my husband. **$18.82** After we get home, I head out again to the farmer's market only to see it is closed (was going to get elote for lunch), so I pick up Korean fried chicken **$23.68** for myself while husband put the kids to bed for a nap. I eat lunch and chat with a friend, who is in the process of spring cleaning (winter cleaning)? He sends me photos of his ""junk"" (literally, cardboard boxes) and I marvel at how clean and organized a childfree home is. 

4:00PM After the kids' naps, we go to a park (regularly scheduled every Sunday afternoon with open invitation to three other families). 

5:30PM We leave to my parents' house (a minute away). I give them some of the jam I made. My parents spend time with my kids, and my husband and I sit on our phones. 

6:00PM We head home with food from my mom. I was going to cook but will punt that to tomorrow. We have fish, pork, chicken, mmmm.

8:00PM Bedtime for the kids.

8:30PM I wash the dishes and schedule our week out. I have Monday and Tuesday off, my husband has Thursday and Friday off, and Wednesday is a holiday. 

8:55PM I order stainless steel scrubbing pads, paint-your-own wooden vehicles, a dye-free scrub daddy, and a fluffy rolling elephant ride-on, which can swivel 360 degrees. That one is $40. The total cost is $66.88, but I use a gift card.

9:00PM I have a snack - lemon blueberry goat cheese with raspberry jam and toast

10:00PM I play Stardew valley while my husband plays Persona. He comes up a little bit before bedtime and we snuggle.

11:20PM bed for me.

#MONDAY - $482.05

8:00AM - We get the kids up. Breakfast consists of sweet pepper omelets and grapes. I buy yoga classes (**$120** for a $150 gift card, about five classes).

9:00AM finds me coordinating playdates with three different groups (neighborhood kid group, friend group, and school group). I am trying to figure out which sports class, climbing gym, trampoline park, and/or playground cafe we will be doing this week, in addition to visiting a regional park with a train. I settle on rock climbing tomorrow. I book the class but realize it was for the wrong time slot, so i call them and they're able to change it to tomorrow! **$68** for two people, one hour each. I make a note on my to-do list to do the waivers.

9:30AM My husband goes to the office, my mom picks up my daughter, and I take my son out for lunch. 

10:00AM We arrive at the mall, so I put our names down. My plan was to get soup dumplings. A friend spontaneously decides to join us (family of three, baby being almost half a year old). 

11:30AM We are seated. We eat, commiserate over how hard babies are, and I pay for lunch as a Christmas present to them. **$152.46** including tip. After the meal, I take my son on the merry go round **$2.00** and buy him a Lego set **$86.19**. The store gives me a small free set. We head home.

2:00PM We get home, I put my son down for a nap and get the laundry started. I load up Bridgerton and Stardew Valley.

3:30PM My son wakes up and we build Legos together (I build and he helps me find pieces). It takes 2 hours as he needs a lot of prompting, but I figure he will get better as he practices.

5:30PM I start prepping dinner. I make honey mustard chicken, parmesan sweet peppers, and cheddar smashed potatoes. I use up the last of the honey - this jar was orange blossom honey, but I will get buckwheat next. 

7:00PM My husband gets home with our daughter. We eat dinner, with grapes for dessert. My daughter is especially excited over this and demands the entire bowl.

7:30PM After dinner, I work with my son on his reading while my husbands works on the alphabet with our daughter. We play after.

8:30PM Bedtime routine. My kids have no issue going to sleep, so I am in and out of my daughter's room in five minutes (she tells me ""go away, byebye"" after I pull the blanket over her. Such attitude.)

8:45PM I buy a Hemlock & Oak daily planner for 2025. It's made in Canada, a beautiful and minimalist design. 20% off but shipping is $11 so total is **$53.40**. Will the planner fix my ADHD? No, but I buy it anyway.

9:00PM I play a little Stardew Valley.

11:30PM My husband comes to tuck me in, but he goes back downstairs to play videogames after.

#TUESDAY - $160.16

8:00AM We get the kids up. Husband makes breakfast and orders dinner **$97.94** for us (We eat sushi as our NYE tradition.) I set pickup for the afternoon. I have oat milk & cold brew. My husband takes my daughter to my parents and then work. 

9:00AM I get ready for rock climbing by finding my son a pair of sneakers that I bought a year ago that fit him now. My son plays independently for now so I file my nails and put on some makeup.

10:00AM We meet the other families at the rock climbing gym. Apparently I didn't need to buy a ticket for myself, and if I bought in person, the kid ticket is only $25. Oh well. It's very kid-friendly but my son hates it. *Hates.* I manage to convince him to try four walls and one slide, but he is absolutely done after. 

12:00PM One of the other families and I choose Italian for lunch. My son eats some pizza and spaghetti with meat sauce, and I eat his leftovers. I enjoy getting to know the other family. They're outgoing and we share similar interests (like boardgames and videogames). At the end of the meal, I venmo our share **$30** plus tax and tip to the other family, then head with my son to pick up dinner.

1:20PM I buy ikura for my son's dinner, though he tells me he wants butter chicken (???). I also buy jelly sake, potato chips (son's request), and baby puffs. **$22.23**

1:35PM: We are walking to the sushi place when my son says he wants ice cream. We are out of cones at home, so we walk over to the store and I pick up two boxes of sugar cones. **$9.99** I finally am able to pick up the sushi and head home.

1:45PM I tuck my son in for his nap, watch Beef, play a little SD valley, have a tiny bit of coffee, and fold clothes. SO. MANY. CLOTHES. I swear I do two or three hampers a week.

2:00PM I make hummingbird water and hang the feeder outside. My parents text me and ask for paper plates.

3:30PM My son wakes up. I do some dishes as he cleans up his playroom, and we head out to the park. 

5:00PM We swing by my parents' house to pick up my daughter. I give my parents the plates and wait for my husband so we can carpool back home. 

6:00PM My husband arrives and we head home for dinner. Rice & chicken from last night for my daughter, ikura and rice for my son, and toro & yellowtail handrolls for the adults. We offer our kids our food but they decline. 

7:00PM Some friends message me to see if I am free tomorrow morning for a walk. We decide on a local trail.  

7:30PM The kids are allowed to watch fireworks on TV AND have a juicebox (normally only for birthday parties) and a tablespoon of ice cream each. I only know this because we are basically out of ice cream and there's barely any. I make mini cones and give each kid one. They are beyond ecstatic. Ice cream AND juice in one night?! 

8:00PM We play with legos (my daughter and I play with duplo), we read some books, and the kids are put into bed. 

8:45PM My husband and I begin drinking. I have a sake jelly and my husband pours some champagne for us. 

11:30PM We prepare for bringing the new year in with a ""bang."" yes, I made that lame pun up years ago and it's been our tradition since (sushi & that). We snuggle then I brush my teeth and go to bed.

#WEDNESDAY - $142.34

9:00AM Wow I am up late. I find my husband has gotten the kids up and picked up breakfast from a local Taiwanese cafe. **$37.12** He gets me an osmanthus oolong milk tea, which I put in the fridge for later, and a pepper beef breakfast sandwich. He also stopped by 85C for buns. **$24.45**

9:30AM We head to the trail and meet up with my friends. My son insists on biking, while my daughter wants her scooter (that lasts all of two minutes, so my husband and i take turns carrying it). I catch up with my friends, the kids run around happily, and the two miles ""hike"" (flat, paved sidewalk) passes by easily, though at the end my daughter wants to be held. The day was warm - even though it said it was 51F, it felt like 80 in the sun. My friends invite us over for lunch, so we pick up McD for all the kids **$19.97** and head over. We normally don't get fast food this often, because my son eats at school (we pack lunch and it's much healthier) and my daughter eats at my parents'. Still, with the holiday rush, it is what it is.

12:00PM My friends make clam soup, galbi short rib, okra, bok choy, and rice. Yummm. We talk (they are thinking of upsizing and have a tax question) and set a playdate in two days, so we can treat them back for lunch.

1:30PM My daughter is overtired by the time we get home for her nap and I stay with her for 20 minutes to stroke her hair. She eventually calms down and falls asleep. I leave after I am sure she is asleep. I usually don't do this, but kids need flexibility. 

2:30PM I drink the tea from earlier and head out to buy gas. It is **$60.80** for 13.7 gallons, which gives us around 550 miles for our hybrid SUV.

3:00PM I make playdate plans with another family for the afternoon at the park. I try to have my kids outside every day for two to eight hours whenever we can. It does mess with my ability to clean or do household chores, but my husband and I are on the same page and will take a little mess in exchange for our kids getting to run around outside. 

3:30PM I finish Beef while the kids are sleeping, drink my tea, and enjoy the relative silence. It is wonderful. My husband is downstairs, gaming.

3:45PM The kids wake up but my daughter is screaming and in a terrible mood. I hug her while I wait for her to calm down before I pick her up and take her downstairs. It is okay for her to have big feelings and be angry, and I am here to comfort her, but we need to behave before we continue with our day. 

4:00PM While the kids are having a snack (fruit), I prep dinner (throw a bunch of ingredients in the instant pot). My friend texts me that her kid is still napping so it'll be just us this time. We head out to the park.

5:30PM We head home. I made chicken potato soup in an instant pot. My husband boils udon noodles (two minutes). The kids eat a ton, especially the udon. They then have a plain sugar cone, Japanese potato chips, and green & red grapes for dessert. After, we play in the living room.

8:00PM Bedtime routine. They're both very giggly, verging on overtired, so I breathe a sigh of relief when my daughter goes to bed with no issue. 

9:00PM I go downstairs and eat a chocolate croissant from 85C. I then do laundry while watching Always Be My Maybe and log into WoW to look at the month's new trader post offerings before picking up the weeklies.

10:00PM My husband comes up and we have bonding time.

11:00PM We talk about the kids. A lot of reminiscing about when they were babies (they are still babies to me). 

12:00AM I brush my teeth, apply tretinoin since I am working tomorrow and won't be in the sun, and go to bed.

#THURSDAY - $369.58

7:00AM Why am I awake this early? Maybe my body knows today is a work day? I get ready for the day (put in contacts), scroll IG for fifteen minutes or so, make a coffee, and throw laundry into the wash.

7:30AM I am WFH. I log in for work , check my emails and do my timesheet.

8:00AM I hear my husband get my son and daughter up, so I text my parents that my daughter is awake. 

9:00AM I go downstairs to make myself breakfast - mocha latte & toast. I find cookies in the diaper bag (from my friend yesterday) and take my loot upstairs to eat while I work. I love sugar. Most people can't tell because I'm underweight, but my diet would be 90% sugar water (full sweetness milk tea, flavored lattes, coconut water, matcha) if dental work wasn't so expensive. I already have three dental implants.

9:30AM My mom comes to get my daughter, and my husband takes my son to the regional park, which boasts both a train and a zoo on site. They use tickets I purchased earlier in the year (10 tickets for $60). $12 total but is prepaid. I keep working. It is quiet but I have a lot of emails.

11:00AM A friend texts me about a free preschool pass deal for sea world. I log in and buy two. I check out the price of tickets for my husband and I. We can either buy single day tickets for $70 each (cheapest), or an annual pass for $102 each, which includes 50% off parking. The annual pass is on a $8.50/month with 0% APR offer, which to me seems like the better choice as long as we go two or more times in the year. I text my husband to ask how he feels about it. He says yes and I pay **$17** upfront. I immediately text a bunch of local friends about the deal.

11:15AM Back to work. so. many. emails. They're not important but i read them all anyway because honestly it is the day after a holiday, no one is online, and no one needs me. 

1:00PM My husband and son get home. I go downstairs to greet them. He tells me he pet a snake and a possum at the zoo (**$4** for zoo tickets) and rode the train. Very exciting when you are three. I grab peach sparkling water and pop the morning laundry into the dryer. My husband ate with my son at the park ($23 total) asks me what I want. Even though I want curry, it's $17 and I usually go there on lunch dates with my husband. I pick a $4 cheeseburger from In n Out.

1:30PM I tackle admin work and start sketching out a plan for technical work.

2:50PM My husband comes home with burgers, fries, and some alcohol (he took a detour)**$13.68** and **$67.10** respectively. I take a 10 minute break to eat.

3:30PM My son is up, so my husband takes him grocery shopping. They go to Costco (**$122.25**) and Ralphs (**$122.25**). At Costco, they get sparkling water, oxtail, beef tongue, sweet peppers, and pasta. At Ralphs, celery, blueberries, strawberries, blackberries, oat milk, eggplant, zucchini, two types of cheeses, basil, pasta, and vanilla ice cream.

4:10PM I get off work. My King Arthur package is supposed to arrive today and I am planning on making make snowflake crisp (taiwanese nougat) and chocolate chip milk bread, along with broccoli & cheese pasta for dinner. However, when I check, the package has been delayed five days. I need milk powder to make the baked goods, so none today.

5:00PM I start dinner. The recipe takes 15 minutes after the water boils, so the meal is done quickly. My parents drop my daughter off.

6:00PM There's too much lemon juice in the pasta (I didn't measure and juiced directly into the pasta) and it's sour. Neither kid eats much, so my husband eats most of it. My son, who loves broccoli in any form, is not down with the melted cheese on his and refuses to eat his vegetables.

6:30PM We don't force them to finish anything, ever. After the meal the two devour a carton of sweetest batch strawberries while watching 30 mins of tv.

8:00PM Straightforward bedtime.

9:30PM I get a hankering for brownies. I loved boxed brownie mix, so I always keep a box handy. I add espresso powder, natural cocoa powder, vanilla extract, sub the water out for milk, use melted butter, and add an extra egg yolk. While the brownies bake, I fold laundry.

11:00PM: I eat a brownie and start cleaning the dishes and the rest of the kitchen. This week has been an anomaly with cooking - my husband usually cooks 100% of the dinners, which I prefer because he never cleans up after (regardless of who cooks). To me, it's fair if he cooks and I clean, not fair if I do both, especially since I am also stuck with laundry duty and we do two to three hampers a week (the folding and sorting and hanging drive me insane). After, I head back to fold more clothes.

12:00AM: My husband starts cooking his oxtail recipe for tomorrow's lunch/dinner. He comes upstairs and watches me finish laundry, then we cuddle and talk about tomorrow's plans. I brush my teeth and go to bed.",5,1735950301.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,1,1.0,False

Title: How Do You Stop Overthinking and Focus on Your Own Growth?

Comment:
I‚Äôm 22 and feeling stuck right now. I‚Äôve been living with my grandma, helping out with her and her live-in helper‚Äôs 18-month-old, and working at a coffee shop with inconsistent hours. I‚Äôm teaching myself to code and trying to build skills for the future, but it‚Äôs hard not to feel like I‚Äôm falling behind compared to others my age.

I tend to get in my own head a lot, overthink things, and feel like I can‚Äôt trust people easily. I don‚Äôt talk to many people about how I‚Äôm feeling because it‚Äôs hard to open up, but I know I can‚Äôt be the only one who struggles with this. So many of my friends seem to have their lives in order and I feel like the laughing stock. 

If you‚Äôve felt like this, how do you focus on your own happiness and growth? How do you stop comparing yourself to others, stay motivated, and move forward when you feel stuck?

1ht1k7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/EthicalNonMonogamy/comments/1ht1k7i/partner_lied_and_hid_multiple_meetings_with_her/,Partner lied and hid multiple meetings with her ex-- need advice,"I need some outside perspective here.  Me (53/M) and my partner (31/F), have been together for 2 years, live together, love each other deeply and have intended on building a life together.  We became ENM about a year ago, and explored both group dynamics as well as solo dating.  While there were some (expected) challenges along the way, being ENM has suited both of us very well with few jealousy or trust issues, and has brought us closer together.

Just a few days ago, a friend of mine told me she saw my partner with another man dining at a nice restaurant. This restaurant happens to be where I took her on our first date.  I asked my partner about it, because I was out of town on that particular night, and this felt odd because if she had been on a date with someone she would have told me (we fully inform each other about any solo dates).  And, she had told me instead she was meeting a good female friend (non-romantic) of hers that evening.  
  
She looked a little embarrassed, and said yes she was having dinner with someone. When I asked who, she said it was her ex-boyfriend, but it was ""nothing"".  She said he was in the area and needed to drop  off some paperwork so they just spontaneously met for dinner.  I was pretty shocked to find out about this, because one of our few rules was ""no dating an ex"".  And on top of that she lied to me about who she was seeing that night.

I was pretty hurt and she apologized about it. She said nothing happened between them and it was a friendly dinner.  She asked if she could do anything to mend the breach of trust, and I asked her to show me the text messages with her ex to confirm this was just an innocent dinner.  She then is clearly uncomfortable with this, and admits they set up a dinner a few days before. She finally shows me the text messages, and as I scroll back, I realize they have met up before on multiple times for drinks, dinner, coffee, etc.  In fact her on her last message she asked him to come see her on her lunch break at work.

At this point I am devastated. After much crying and me talking to my therapist about it, I agree to forgive her. Per the advice of my therapist, I ask her if she would promise to never lie to me again about her ex. She promises. I ask her if she's spoken to him since our last talk, she promises she hasn't. She agrees to show me her phone again to show there are no new texts.  However, she is by her laptop so I ask her to pull up her messages on her laptop instead, and there are several texts she clearly deleted on her phone that are still there on her laptop.  The last one being ""He knows about our dinner"", with her sending him screenshots of IG racy photos she is asking him to delete along with a ""call me don't text me""

I love her dearly but this is too much. Though she swears their relationship was platonic, I don't know how to believe anything she says.

Is there any good reason I should stay with her? I'm devastated.",1,1735950187.0,EthicalNonMonogamy,2,1.0,False

I‚Äôm 22 and feeling stuck right now. I‚Äôve been living with my grandma, helping out with her and her live-in helper‚Äôs 18-month-old, and working at a coffee shop with inconsistent hours. I‚Äôm teaching myself to code and trying to build skills for the future, but it‚Äôs hard not to feel like I‚Äôm falling behind compared to others my age.

I tend to get in my own head a lot, overthink things, and feel like I can‚Äôt trust people easily. I don‚Äôt talk to many people about how I‚Äôm feeling because it‚Äôs hard to open up, but I know I can‚Äôt be the only one who struggles with this.

If you‚Äôve felt like this, how do you focus on your own happiness and growth? How do you stop comparing yourself to others, stay motivated, and move forward when you feel stuck?

I was diagnosed with ADD (inattentive) about 2 months ago.  I saw the psychiatrist yesterday (2 month wait) and was prescribed 15mg Adderall XR.

My primary symptoms are bad anxiety and a constantly noisy brain, like radio stations playing in my head constantly and I have a tough time keeping focused on the right station.  Constant thought loops, Constantly overwhelmed with thoughts and planning.  Many more symptoms but this is the main one. 

I took 15mg Adderall XR today for the first time today at 9am.  Skipped my coffee.  There was never a euphoria or sense of ‚Äúeverything going silent for the first time‚Äù.  Fine by me.  Not looking to get high in the slightest. Never felt any ‚Äúkick in‚Äù which I figured, considering XR.

So what did I feel?  Not much that was noticeable.  It was a pretty lax day at work so I wasn‚Äôt high stress (symptoms much worse w stress). I was able to stay on task and complete tasks a little bit better.  For example I read through a long email chain that‚Äôs been in my inbox for a month and understood it and annotated, and I actually called 2 people for questions instead of putting it off and never doing it.  But I still did have my moments of distraction (which may be a result of just boredom).

But the noise, while dulled, is still there a bit.  Like right now, I‚Äôm kind of thought looping (not as hard as unmedicated) on the idea that this whole ADHD diagnosis is wrong, the meds didn‚Äôt work, I‚Äôm back at square one, etc.  I was hoping that those thought loops would completely cease.  Maybe my expectation was just too high.  Or maybe my dose is too low.  Or maybe I need to give it time.  Or maybe I don‚Äôt have ADHD.  See what I mean?

What did you guys experience your first dose?  Is it reasonable to expect the overwhelming thoughts to stop or was I too optimistic?  All experiences are welcome!  Thanks.",2,1735949627.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

As a child, it rivaled Sesame Street in terms of wonder. Everything seemed so big, wonderful, and full of adventure. I remember playing on the park playground. My house being so big. The general store where if I was very good, mom and dad would get me candy. The coffee shop where my mother would buy me blueberry muffins, which I still love to this day. There was also an enchanted forest next to another park where I would sometimes look for fairies, elves, and other fantasy creatures in. The only place that seemed small was my preschool.

The last time I visited Bren Mayr, it was VERY different. I noticed how small the place really is. And how small the houses really were. And how old ugly they actually are. The playground is gone. As is the coffee shop. And the enchanted forest, was just a small park forest. But I saw a new beauty. The houses may be old and ugly. But looks can deceive. Maybe those houses look bad, but do their jobs very well and are meant to  endure. Perhaps they've been renovated a lot externally. There was a newer and safer playground there. And there's a bigger coffee shop now. The preschool was MUCH bigger then I remembered. Because it's part of a larger Elementary and Middle School building. 

Sadly, the last trip was in a car. And I never got out. But I'm planning another visit this Spring. And this time, walk those streets again. Maybe grab lunch at the general store which is still there. Grab a muffin at the current coffee shop. Relax at the park on a bench. And maybe see a bit of nature in the forest. And of course, see my old house again. Plus, I'm also trying to balance my inner child with my adulthood in healthy ways. To not get stuck in the past, but not run towards the future either.

## Introduction

Traveling comfortably and hygienically is paramount, and a often-overlooked element is the cleanliness and protection of your travel neck pillow.  A quality travel neck pillow cover is your first line of defense against germs, spills, and general wear and tear, ensuring your neck pillow remains a source of comfort, not discomfort, throughout your journey. This guide will help you navigate the world of travel neck pillow covers, highlighting the best options for ultimate comfort and protection. We'll cover various types, materials, features, and maintenance tips, empowering you to make an informed decision based on your individual travel style and needs.


## Types of Travel Neck Pillow Covers: Finding Your Perfect Fit

The market offers a diverse range of travel neck pillow covers, each designed to address specific needs.  Understanding these differences is key to selecting the ideal cover for your next adventure.

### 1. Washable Travel Neck Pillow Covers: Hygiene on the Go

For frequent travelers, a washable travel neck pillow cover is a non-negotiable.  The ability to easily clean and sanitize your pillow cover after each use is crucial for maintaining hygiene and preventing the buildup of bacteria, sweat, and allergens. Look for covers explicitly labeled as """"machine washable"""" and check the care instructions to ensure they can withstand repeated washing without shrinking or losing their shape.

**Materials to Consider:**

* **Polyester:** A durable and easy-to-clean option, often blended with other fibers for added softness or breathability.
* **Cotton:** A naturally soft and breathable material, although it may require more delicate washing than polyester. Cotton blends often incorporate other fibers to enhance durability and wrinkle resistance.
* **Bamboo:** Known for its softness, breathability, and antimicrobial properties, bamboo fabric offers a luxurious and hygienic option.  It's typically more expensive than polyester or cotton.
* **Microfiber:**  A synthetic fabric that is incredibly soft, lightweight, and quick-drying.  It's also highly resistant to wrinkles and pilling.

**Top Brands Offering Washable Covers (Examples ‚Äì Replace with actual brands and models):**

* Brand A:  Known for its durable polyester blends and vibrant colors.
* Brand B: Specializes in soft, breathable cotton and bamboo blends.
* Brand C: Offers a range of microfiber covers with various designs.


### 2. Waterproof Travel Neck Pillow Covers: Protection Against Spills

Accidents happen, especially during travel. A waterproof travel neck pillow cover provides an extra layer of protection against unexpected spills, whether it's coffee, juice, or even that unfortunate mid-flight turbulence incident. These covers are typically made from materials that repel liquids and are easy to wipe clean.

**Materials to Consider:**

* **PVC:**  A durable and completely waterproof material, but it may not be as breathable as other options.
* **Nylon:** A lightweight, durable, and water-resistant material that offers a good balance of protection and breathability.
* **Silicone:** A soft, flexible, and waterproof material that‚Äôs easy to clean.


**Top Brands Offering Waterproof Covers (Examples ‚Äì Replace with actual brands and models):**

* Brand X:  Known for its durable PVC covers designed for maximum spill protection.
* Brand Y:  Specializes in lightweight, nylon covers that are both waterproof and breathable.
* Brand Z: Offers silicone covers that are both waterproof and incredibly easy to clean.


### 3. Soft Travel Neck Pillow Covers: Prioritizing Comfort

For those who prioritize comfort and a luxurious feel, soft travel neck pillow covers are the perfect choice. These covers are made from materials that are gentle on the skin and provide an extra layer of comfort against your neck.

**Materials to Consider:**

* **Silk:** A luxurious and naturally hypoallergenic material that is incredibly soft and smooth against the skin.
* **Fleece:** A cozy and warm material, ideal for colder climates or flights.
* **Velvet:** A plush and luxurious material that adds an extra layer of comfort and softness.


**Top Brands Offering Soft Covers (Examples ‚Äì Replace with actual brands and models):**

* Brand 1: Known for its high-quality silk covers.
* Brand 2: Offers a range of plush fleece covers for added warmth.
* Brand 3: Specializes in luxurious velvet covers for ultimate comfort.


## How to Choose the Right Travel Neck Pillow Cover: A Buyer's Guide

Selecting the perfect travel neck pillow cover involves considering several key factors:

### 1. Material: Balancing Comfort, Durability, and Hygiene

The material of your cover significantly impacts its comfort, durability, and ease of cleaning. Consider the following:

* **Breathability:**  Essential for preventing overheating, especially during long flights or journeys in warm climates.  Bamboo and cotton are excellent choices for breathability.
* **Durability:** Look for materials that can withstand repeated washing and general wear and tear. Polyester and nylon are known for their durability.
* **Softness:**  Choose a material that feels comfortable against your skin. Silk, bamboo, and microfiber are known for their softness.
* **Water Resistance:** If spill protection is a priority, opt for waterproof materials like PVC or nylon.


### 2. Size and Fit: Ensuring a Snug and Secure Cover

Ensure the cover fits your neck pillow snugly to prevent it from shifting or bunching up during use.  Check the dimensions of your pillow and compare them to the cover's specifications.  Some covers offer adjustable straps for a customized fit.

### 3. Additional Features: Enhancing Comfort and Functionality

Consider these additional features that can enhance your travel experience:

* **Zipper Closure:**  Provides a secure fit and prevents the cover from slipping off.
* **Easy-Care Features:** Look for covers that are machine washable and quick-drying.
* **Travel-Friendly Design:**  Compact and lightweight covers are ideal for packing.
* **Antimicrobial Properties:**  Some materials, like bamboo, naturally inhibit the growth of bacteria.


### 4. Brand Reputation and Reviews: Informed Decisions

Before making a purchase, research different brands and read customer reviews. This will help you gauge the quality, durability, and overall satisfaction of various travel neck pillow covers.


##  Maintenance and Care: Extending the Life of Your Cover

Proper care and maintenance will significantly extend the lifespan of your travel neck pillow cover and keep it looking and feeling its best.

* **Follow Washing Instructions:** Always check the care label before washing your cover.  Some covers require hand washing, while others can be machine washed.
* **Air Drying:**  Air drying is generally preferable to machine drying, as it helps prevent shrinkage and damage.
* **Regular Cleaning:**  Wash your cover regularly to maintain hygiene and prevent the buildup of bacteria and allergens.
* **Storage:** When not in use, store your travel neck pillow cover in a clean, dry place to prevent dust and dirt accumulation.


## Industry Trends and Future Innovations

The travel accessories market is constantly evolving, with new materials and technologies continuously emerging.  We can expect to see further advancements in:

* **Sustainable Materials:**  Increased use of eco-friendly and sustainable materials in the production of travel neck pillow covers.
* **Smart Features:**  Integration of smart features, such as temperature regulation or built-in antimicrobial technology.
* **Personalized Designs:**  More customization options to allow travelers to personalize their covers to match their individual styles.


## Conclusion

Choosing the right travel neck pillow cover is an investment in comfortable and hygienic travel. By considering the factors discussed above‚Äîmaterial, size, features, and brand reputation‚Äîyou can find the perfect cover to enhance your travel experience. Remember to prioritize hygiene, durability, and comfort to ensure your neck pillow remains a reliable companion on every journey.


## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Can I use a regular pillowcase as a travel neck pillow cover?**

A: While you can, a dedicated travel neck pillow cover offers superior protection and hygiene features.  Regular pillowcases may not be as durable or easy to clean, and they may not fit your neck pillow as snugly.

**Q: How often should I wash my travel neck pillow cover?**

A:  Ideally, after each use, especially if you've been sweating or there's a risk of spills.  At minimum, wash it after every trip.

**Q:  Are all travel neck pillow covers machine washable?**

A: No, always check the care instructions before washing.  Some covers require hand washing.

**Q: What's the difference between water-resistant and waterproof?**

A: Water-resistant covers repel water to a certain extent, but they may not be completely waterproof. Waterproof covers are designed to completely prevent water from penetrating the fabric.

My boyfriend James (25m) and I (23f) are in a large friend group (<10) that has several couples in the group. Ofc as normal, some members of the group are closer to us than others, and one couple (Eliz 23f and Tony 24m) are very good friends of ours and we always end up talking to them at large group hangs. We've a lot in common with them and we share a hobby which we often do together with others from the big group. Because we share a lot of interests we occasionally go on double dates, and both myself and Eliz (and our bfs) hang out 1-2-1 on the reg (eg get coffee/lunch).  

Eliz lives in a house share with 4 others from the large group and one of them, Jack 25m, has started to complain about being ""left out of group hangs"" that are in reality just the Eliz, Tony, James and I going on double dates (we go on no more than 4 a year). 

Recently, Jack has confronted Eliz on several occasions demanding to have himself and his gf included in the ""group hangs"" we are having. They don't do the hobby we share with a larger number of the group and now class that hobby as a ""secret group hang"" they are excluded from too, mostly bc we have a separate gc from the main one as we where asked to by the main group as its a really niche hobby. We never use that gc to organise bar trips or social hangs outside the hobby. 

When Eliz returned home after our last double date Jack accused me of being the reason he and his gf are ""left out"". He specifically claims I purposefully exclude his gf, I have receipts that show I always ask her to stuff I do with Eliz and I and she is busy/says no/doesn't respond. I am normally the one that initiates the double dates bc James has bad organising skills.  Jack made Eliz cry this time and she feels like she's being targeted.

I live in Kansas City, but I've spent most of my life in the NYC metro. I moved here in 2015 for a great job, and I've been here since. I live alone in a nice, modern home in the South Hyde Park area. I love living inside the city and don't see myself living far away from an urban area.

I'm handsome, slim, and in great shape. I have deep, dark eyes and dark hair peppered with greys. I keep my facial hair short and well-groomed. I don't currently have any tattoos or piercings.

I pass regular background checks due to my job so you know I'm not shady. I have no debt or unpaid bills. I'm not addicted to anything. I don't need to be taught basic adult skills like how to care for myself or my home. You won't have to pick up after me or take an overwhelming share of the mental load. I've even kept my plants alive for years! Hopefully, you've got stability and minimal drama in your life. Ideally, you're independent and have a job that you enjoy. 

Politically, I'm a very passionate progressive/liberal. If you have some ""conservative"" values, that may not necessarily be a source of conflict. However, if you're a supporter of the modern Republican party and the MAGA movement, we are not a good fit. I'm not a religious person, but it is okay if you are as long as you can accept that I am not. Lastly, I do not have children and would prefer to date someone without children or whose kids are older and independent.

Except for a fulfilling relationship with a loving partner, I have a happy and comfortable life that doesn't want for anything. I'm capable, confident, independent, and have my life together. I want to meet someone with the intent of developing an enduring relationship. We can proceed at a pace that makes sense for us.

-------------------------
**Some things I enjoy:**

* **Food**: I have a very adventurous palate and love trying new foods. I avoid eating at the same restaurant twice to force myself to broaden my food experiences. If you're a vegan/vegetarian, that's fine! I'm open to the idea of some version of vegetarianism myself. I'm a competent cook, but I don't enjoy cooking. I'd prefer a partner who does. I promise that I'm great at doing the dishes and cleaning up in the kitchen.

* **Fitness**: My health is important, especially as I get older. I exercise regularly and also run. I'd love someone who prioritizes their health and fitness as well.

* **Coffee**: My COVID project was learning to appreciate coffee. My home ""cafe"" looks like a meth lab. I love it. I'll make you a great, fresh cup of pour-over in the morning. 

* **Bread**: Well, now that I'm kind of an expert in fresh pour-over coffee, I've somehow stumbled onto sourdough. I obtained a 220 starter from San Francisco named Doughlene and am raising her child Doughrothy. I've managed to keep her alive (I'm really good at taking care of stuff!) so far and have made various flatbreads. Maybe I'll try an actual loaf soon...

* **Riding**: I own a modern-retro scooter (a la Vespa) and enjoy riding it around the city. Don't worry, you do not need to get on the scooter if you don't want to. I promise I ride safely and with proper gear, and never speed or get on the highway.

* **Therapy**: I have been seeing a therapist for about half a year, and I'm finding it invaluable. After my previous relationships failed, I felt it was important to work on myself and set up future relationships for success. I think everyone would benefit from therapy at various points in their life.

* **Politics**: I'm a ""political junkie"". I frequently read articles and listen to podcasts. I also have a great deal of interest in the Supreme Court.

* **Movies**: I'm a huge cinephile and enjoy going to the theater. 

* **Music**: I love live music. I'm tolerant of most genres but gravitate towards indie, pop, and EDM. I like discovering new music, so if you want to share something you're vibing to and think I might like it, please share it with me.

* **Gaming**: I love to play board games with a group or my partner. I especially like games that involve some sort of social component and intuition, like The Resistance. Going out for trivia nights at bars is also one of my favorite things to do. I sometimes play single-player video games that allow me to stop at any time.

* **Cleanliness**: I'm probably the tidiest man you'll ever meet. I keep both my home and myself tidy. I'm something of a minimalist as well. I am not a big fan of collecting tons of trinkets and knickknacks and would not do well with a hoarder.

* **Drugs**: I have no dependencies or addictions whatsoever. I only drink socially and in moderation. I don't smoke *anything*, and I don't want to date someone who smokes a lot of anything. It smells gross and makes you taste gross. I sometimes enjoy a low-dose edible or a psychedelic. It's okay with me if you casually enjoy alcohol, marijuana, or ""lighter"" drugs more often than I do. 

* **Traveling**: I'm more of a homebody, but I like road trips. I want to drive across the country in a camper someday. I enjoy hiking and ""glamping"", but don't love prolonged camping. I would be agreeable to traveling far and wide with a partner.

It is perfectly fine if you don't share all my interests. I want you to be your own person with your own passions. As long as we align on our core values and ideals, the rest is not all that important.

------------
Please be serious about meeting in person. I don't want to text endlessly. If you're interested, feel free to reach out to me via chat or Reddit mail (preferred). **Please include a picture of your face with your message and describe yourself physically**. It's not much different than if we were on a dating app. I **will** ask for a picture if you didn't include one to start. Being weird about this would lead me to believe you're not serious and I'll likely move on.

------------
If you're **long-distance** (i.e. more than 2 hours away) and still interested, feel free to message me, but *only if* you're willing to make an actual effort to meet me in person after chatting for a bit. Ideally, you're in a position where you'll be able to relocate to Kansas City to live with me in a hypothetical future in which we're both committed to one another.

Is there a difference between just going out and going on dates when you're in a relationship?","We have been in a relationship for 3 years now, just moved in together over a year ago. Since moving in together, for me it doesn't seem like we've been going on a lot of dates. It's been more hanging out or doing activities together. I was going through a rough patch with jobs last year. I went through 4 difference jobs and it really hit me financially and emotionally. I felt soo lost and it took a huge toll on my mental health. He is amazing and took on more work (he's a concreter). Was happy to take on more financial responsibility for us, but honestly it wasn't so different. He just worked more. Now I've found a stable job I love.

We agreed to try and go on more dates at least every fortnight. But we're both confused on what is classified as a date. I, 29F, think when you're in a relationship you should specify when we are going on a date, where we are going and what time.
Where as he 26M says that any time we spend together doing things, in his mind is classified as a date. We try to do different activities together, he's very active and prefers to do more active dates He is very healthy, does not drin nor does he like coffee. So I do my best to cater for him too.

I was offered a 2024 Hummer EV SUV (completely blacked out) with 2,000 miles on it. It was a demo vehicle that a dealership employee had been driving. Initially, they quoted me over $800/month, but I got them down to $750/month, including tire and rim protection, thanks to EV rebates. It seemed like a great deal‚Äîespecially after test driving it. The Hummer drove like a tank and felt incredibly well-built, and I was excited about making it my first EV.

However, the vehicle had been poorly maintained. The seats were stained, the center console was sticky, and there were coffee spills everywhere. Despite the dealership‚Äôs attempts to clean it, it still wasn‚Äôt up to my standards‚ÄîI‚Äôm extremely OCD about cleanliness, especially with a $90K vehicle. They offered me $200 off the sticker price to get it professionally detailed, but that wouldn‚Äôt have changed my monthly payment, and I felt it wasn‚Äôt enough to resolve the issue.

On top of that, I live in an apartment and won‚Äôt have access to a Level 2 charger until I move in a year. Between the charging concerns and the frustration with the vehicle‚Äôs condition, I decided to pass on the Hummer.

I ended up leasing a 2025 Ford Explorer ST with a twin-turbo V6, and I love it. It feels like the perfect gas-powered vehicle to end on before I eventually switch to an EV. While I‚Äôm happy with my decision, I still feel like I missed out on a great deal with the Hummer. Maybe in the future, I‚Äôll get another shot at a Hummer EV‚Äîor perhaps a Mustang Mach-E.

Let‚Äôs see what the future holds for EV incentives, though. I have a feeling they may not be as generous as they are now in the coming years.

We had a lot in common, and coincidentally, she was moving into the building right behind mine. For our first date, we met for coffee, and she seemed really interested in me; so much so that she insisted we have dinner the same evening. I could tell she was quite impressed and genuinely into me.

We went on a few more dates, but something about her offline behavior was always bothering me. She would deliberately play texting games and take 2‚Äì3 days to reply to my texts, and after our fourth date, she didn‚Äôt respond to me for an entire week and a half.

I decided to stop texting her because her behavior didn‚Äôt sit right with me, and honestly, I found it annoying. Two weeks later, out of the blue, she messaged me saying, ‚ÄúHi, how are you doing?‚Äù I ignored the text and didn‚Äôt bother replying. I even deleted the message so she wouldn‚Äôt see a ‚Äúread‚Äù notification.

A few days later, she saw me talking to a friend downstairs and texted me the same thing again. I starred liking her over the month so I gave in and replied ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing well. How are you?‚Äù She responded, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing well too.‚Äù At that point, I decided to step back and see if she would take some initiative in the conversation, but she didn‚Äôt. That was the end of that.

Since she lived in the building right behind mine, we ran into each other a few times. Each time, I kept my composure, showed no emotion, and went about my business as usual. The last time we crossed paths, I was driving, and we ended up in what felt like a staring contest.

We had just exchanged Christmas gifts/cards where we both wrote about how excited we were for the future of our relationship in 2025. She opened up to me about her ex who was a complete monster to her who pushed her into sex etc. She broke up with him a year before we met through a sports club.  
I always kind of knew about it because for her birthday I offered to get us ice hockey tickets in another city where we would need to stay overnight and she refused saying there was something about her past which meant she was uncomfortable with it. Since then I never pushed for us to spend weekends away as I knew she was nervous about the whole thing and it was clear to me she had had some sort of relationship trauma. However before the new year we went out for a date and meeting her friends which went great. Afterwards she offered to drive me back to the bus station as we live in different towns but when we were on the way home she got sick and I wanted her to feel better so I told her that ""I don't care if I miss the bus"" as there was another one coming in an hour and she interpreted this as that I didn't care about her or her feelings.  
I then went in to kiss her since I wanted to show I was there for her and she pulled away and said she was going to throw up so I kissed her on the cheek instead.  
We then got to the station and parked up and I said to her again that I didn't care if I missed the bus, I gave her a hug and went to kiss her again on the cheek and it's brought back painful memories of her ex and it turns out I've opened up these old wounds for her. To reiterate I did not have any intention to seem pushy and I wasn't trying to force her to make out with me or whatever as I knew she wasn't feeling well and I wanted her to feel better to make sure she was ok and that I was there for her but although I meant well she has interpreted this as me repeating the actions of her ex being all pushy. 

We spoke the day after where she told me how she felt and I apologised for what I did and told her I didn't want to come across like her ex and she said she knew that I meant well and I didn't intend to come across the way I did. For the next few days we went NC since she asked for space to think everything over and I trusted her not to go seeing other guys so I gave her space and she got in touch the other day saying she would be down to have a chat and she agreed to do a face to face chat in a no pressure setting (coffee shop) and we did that.  
When we spoke she said she was really freaked out that night by my actions and she was sure she wanted to end it there and then but over the days after that when I gave her space she said that she was in two minds about leaving me or not as she feels like I have breached her trust even though in all she knows I never intended to come across the way I did. After our conversation she said she could give the relationship another go but she said there are no promises as to whether we can build that trust again and it feels really heart breaking because over the months I've started to really care about her and I want to be there for her healing process because she said she might not be fully over the abuse this ex put her through.

A filled basket is around 18g of coffee, and water to the line is about 130g. 20g of water will not make it to the top of the pot, so you should yield a drink with 110g of liquid. This is a 1:6 ratio which to me seems too strong.

I tried 11g of coffee to get closer to a 1:10 ratio and holy moly what a difference. It didn‚Äôt taste like wanna-be espresso, or like really concentrated drip coffee. It tasted more like its own category which is between the two. Much more balanced overall.

This has been bothering me since 2024, and I am seeking out if I (28, female) am going crazy or the asshole that my husband and his family are accusing me too. 2024 was a major bad event left and right, so bear with me with the story. I'm not a very good storyteller, so I apologized and I will try my best. Sorry this is a long rant and this is not a full account detail despite this is a long long read. My husband (39 - call him John) convinced my sister in law (33), her husband (37 - call him George), and my mother in law (65) to move into my house, from NY to TX, when they are expecting a newborn to be closer to family and help them save money for a house super last minute out of a whim. ¬† We agreed on certain conditions: their cat (I‚Äôm highly allergic) would stay in a gated area, they‚Äôd take the spaces (two guest rooms, master room, and upstairs game/living room), and they‚Äôd pay $2,500 monthly rent utilities included‚Äîfar less than their $6,000 apartment in NY. This arrangement was decided despite me paying the mortgage and utilities entirely on my own. I grew up with the ‚Äúmy house, my rules‚Äù mentality, so I set basic expectations: keep the house clean, respect the furniture (I had just purchased new pieces), and don‚Äôt disturb my workspace (I work from home in the living room). John left two months after they moved in due to a job six hours away, and I was left to manage the household. Here's what happened over the six months they stayed:

1. When my sister in law (super pregnant at the time) and her husband first moved in, I told them basic expectations and rules about the house like clean to maintain and avoid property damage. I noticed my George was making a mess and my SIL was cleaning after him, while she was very pregnant and hurting. This bothered me on how he‚Äôs not helping his wife out, so I sort of called him out on how he shouldn't make his wife do all this. I specifically called him out when he was laying on the couch and told her to fetch the massage gun in the room, when my SIL felt super uncomfortable. My SIL was still working, WFH, and her husband recently quit his job. He does day trading instead, but not making much money and then plays games like Counterstrike and chess on his computer. He spilt water all over the cabinets and did not even clean up the water. I went over and called them out and explained to them AGAIN how these new cabinets do not have any protective paint or layer and they need to wipe it ASAP.
2. George complained about no ethernet port upstairs. Then he opened the window and put out a long ethernet land to the master room that was located downstairs, and I informed him not to use the AC if the window is cracked because you will waste electricity bill and it's leaking. He whined like a baby about how hot it was upstairs. He had a fan tower, and that should be suffice until we resolve everything. Upon the electrician's arrival to put the ethernet that he's paying for. They made it. loud noises and disturb my SIL and I work. My SIL was furious and mad about it. However, he complained it was necessary. The electrician informed me that my attic has hornets, so I had to pause my work and deal with the situation and called for an emergency pest control. Once that was dealt with, the electrician showed me a picture that the attic was missing a big chunk of insulation, so I had to deal with the home builder to refill since I was still in warranty. I informed my SIL husband not to use the AC again until they fill it in. Again he whined and complained like a child. I told him to suck it up and it's only temporary. I was paying the electricity bill anyway.
3. While I was working in the living room around 10:30 am, I had my meeting call. George comes down and makes a lot of disturbance and noise while cooking in the kitchen. I kindly asked him if he would refrain from cooking when I am on call and it only takes 30 minutes. It didn't happen as much, but his action relapsed over time again. Overtime I didn't notice, but he created a big grease stain on the kitchen cabinet because he constantly cooked bacon on high heat. I honestly didn't watch him, but I was also afraid he's putting bacon grease down the drain as well. Because of that I told both my SIL and him to be careful next time. I was highly upset since we just got this house 3 months ago.
4. While they were using the Tesla, I noticed they already ruined the car with a curb rash. I didn't tell my husband, because I know he will be pissed but I had to cover $400 out of pocket to get it fixed. With the curb rash fix, I also made an appointment to do a PPF wrap cover to prevent any further damage from them that cost me $3k out of pocket. Additionally, the car developed significant tar damage, costing another $400 to fix. I asked George if they drove through fresh roads and they remembered the neighborhood they were looking at. I told them they ruined the car and I had to pay more money out of pocket. George just said okay and never offered to pay. I've noticed he constantly uses the Tesla A LOT and kept using the tollway that I paid for and racking up the toll. I told them to use the toll if you're late to something, but you wouldn't need the toll as much.¬†

From 1-4: I complained to my husband about it and how I am annoyed with George not respecting the house and the car we just bought. I also told him that I don't like how her husband is not treating her right while she is pregnant. I said that his common sense is so bad that I really don't understand how inconsiderate he is. ...This is all less than 1 month after moving in the house. Oof.Sort of irrelevant ish, but I had a personal family problem. My family business got robbed within 30 seconds and lost everything. I was distressed at the time and figuring out how to help my family back in California, while I am in Texas. Besides that‚Ä¶¬†

2 weeks later.

5. My MIL moved into the guest room to help out with the upcoming baby. It was fine, but I noticed she was cleaning up my SIL's husband's mess and tip-toying around him not to disturb him while he was day trading or he's screaming his lungs out when he lost his counter strike game. However, she makes a lot of disturbance. I was like fine whatever, she's a guest but I do sometimes ask her to refrain while I am in a meeting. Same rules and expectations. But I was not okay that my MIL was cleaning up my George‚Äôs mess all the time, but she's there as a guest to relax until the baby comes. NOT do house chores around the house. I vacuumed and prepared the rooms upstairs and it was a mess that George made and didn‚Äôt offer to help.¬†

6. The cat peed on my couch, and George didn‚Äôt clean it properly. He just dabbed it with a paper towel and called it a day. I was in the middle of a work meeting and didn‚Äôt have time to explain how to clean it properly, so I handed him the Bissell machine and told him to follow the instructions. Instead of reading them, he made the situation worse. After my call, I checked his work, and the couch was still dirty. The urine had seeped deeper, so I had to give him step-by-step instructions. This wasted 1‚Äì2 hours of my work time, which I shouldn‚Äôt have had to spend.4 days later, the cat peed on the couch again. This time, my mother-in-law (MIL) sat on it. While in another work meeting, she informed me, and I paused my call to tell George to clean it immediately since it was a biohazard. He ignored me, saying he‚Äôd do it later, even though he was just day trading for fun and doesn‚Äôt have a job. Ten minutes passed, and MIL had to clean part of it herself. I confronted him again, but he still refused to act. MIL went upstairs to explain the urgency, and I overheard George rudely ask her to clean it instead. His tone infuriated me. I went upstairs, yelled at him, and told him not to disrespect MIL or expect her to handle his responsibilities. This is¬†*his*¬†cat, and he should clean up after it immediately. I was frustrated that I always have to interrupt my work to handle issues he dismisses as unimportant. I broke down and told my husband what happened. Instead of supporting me, he said my reaction was childish and asked me to apologize to George. I acknowledged that yelling wasn‚Äôt ideal, but I‚Äôd given George multiple chances, and his dismissive attitude‚Äîespecially toward MIL‚Äîwas unacceptable. I‚Äôm upset that my husband sided with his family instead of understanding my frustration. Why is my work treated as less important while George‚Äôs hobbies are prioritized? Why should I apologize for calling out his rudeness?

7. George‚Äôs mother joined and stayed in the house for a couple of months to help out the baby when it's time to come. I was okay, that's fine, but they don't have a car. So there were many times I had to step away from work to take them around, but George did not offer at all. I noticed they were not using the dishwasher and had been hand washing the whole time. At this time, I wasn‚Äôt home most of the time and I went into the office. I checked the dishwasher and it was flooded with mold, and I reminded the family to check and handwashing surprisingly raised the water bill by a lot. No one wanted to admit and fix the dishwasher, so I had to unclog it myself + threw away a lot of the wood utensils. I told them in the beginning not to put wood utensils in the dishwasher since it will stripway the protective mold, and put plastic lids on the top rack or else it will ruin the plastic. They eventually ignored the rule of eating outside of the kitchen, which led to crumbs and damaging my brand new coffee table with stains. They ignored it so I reminded them. At this point I am just super annoyed. I complained to my husband about it, and we had an argument over this. I told him that they are not respecting the house and the furniture. It‚Äôs super basic, but he said I am being materialistic about it and asking why I bought these expensive furniture in the first place. I ordered before I knew they were moving in.¬†

8. Cat pissed on the couch again. 4 times within 1 week. You know the drill...The moms clean up the mess while the SIL husband didn't do anything. So that irked me and yet naturally I complained to my husband.

9. My FIL joined us at the house, making it very crowded. That week, I was swamped with work, leading back-to-back meetings, including presentations and research interviews, while juggling multiple roles. My FIL lingered awkwardly in the living room, so I suggested he go upstairs to watch TV and relax. He hesitated, saying he didn‚Äôt want to disturb George. I assured him George wasn‚Äôt working‚Äîhe just plays games‚Äîand that watching TV wouldn‚Äôt bother him. Later, my husband blew up at me, accusing me of being disrespectful for suggesting FIL move upstairs. I was shocked because we had previously agreed the upstairs living room was for their activities during my work hours. I explained that I needed my monitors to present and take notes during my meetings, and going to the office wasn‚Äôt feasible since I couldn‚Äôt book a space all day. This week, I had to work from home due to critical deliverables, but I always tried to finish by 5 p.m. so they could use the downstairs living room. When my husband suggested using headphones, I explained that the TV noise would still be audible through my microphone, distracting both me and my colleagues. I also reminded him I‚Äôve been accommodating his family since they moved in, often sacrificing my own needs. The stress has been overwhelming‚ÄîI‚Äôve even skipped meals due to work pressure. If I barely have time to eat, how can I be expected to cook for his family? Despite my efforts, he accused me of being unaccommodating and claimed I hate his family. I told him this wasn‚Äôt true‚ÄîI care for them and have sacrificed a lot. However, the constant pressure to take care of them is beyond what I signed up for. I‚Äôll help where I can, but the expectations are unreasonable.This led to our first major argument, during which he claimed I wanted his family to move out‚Äîsomething I never said. For context, I only complained about George‚Äôs behavior in the first month after they moved in, not about his sister or the rest of his family. After that, I stopped complaining altogether.

10. SIL went into labor, I took the parents to my work since it was close to the hospital. They were chilling in the office, until my SIL gave birth. The parents bothered me unaware while I was talking midway in the meeting. I told them I'm in a meeting, and if they can tell me AFTER. They can't see the baby yet after a couple of hours. Again I stopped midway and took them to the hospital. I don't know if their social awareness is lacking. At this point I also had to do errands returning boxes for the parents, which set me behind work a lot.¬†

11. A few days after, I got laid off. I spiraled into depression and panicked about the house finances. I told my husband I wouldn‚Äôt receive severance for a month and had only enough emergency savings to cover immediate expenses. With a $6k mortgage, I was desperate to find a new job. At this point, my SIL and her husband hadn‚Äôt paid rent for two months. My husband excused them, saying they couldn‚Äôt find a sublet for their $6k New York apartment. The stress was overwhelming because my husband doesn‚Äôt contribute to the mortgage. He spends his money on car payments (including his sister‚Äôs), insurance, and non-IPO stocks, while saving for a room he rents out of the city. My emergency fund could only sustain us for a year, so I became hyper-focused on cutting costs.Utility bills spiked‚Äîelectricity jumped from $80 to $300, and water from $40 to $200. I suggested limiting AC use and switching to tower fans to save money, but my husband got defensive, accusing me of caring more about money than family comfort. I explained we were in a tough financial spot and proposed three options:

1. Limit utilities.
2. Have his family contribute.
3. Come up with another plan.

He rejected all the options, arguing, ‚ÄúDo you want money? All you care about is money over family.‚Äù He also accused me of treating his family differently than I would treat mine. This hit a nerve. I grew up in a Vietnamese immigrant family that came to America with nothing. I was raised to be frugal, sacrificing comforts like cable, internet, and AC to ensure basic needs were met. I worked hard to build a career in tech without help and paid off most of my debt, providing for my family and in-laws when I was financially stable.But now, my savings‚Äîbuilt through years of sacrifice‚Äîwere being drained. I told my husband his family‚Äôs behavior was irresponsible and unfair. MIL & George grew up with everything provided by their parents and had no debt, unlike me. Still, my husband lashed out emotionally, yelling and blaming me. He insisted we were financially fine, but I knew otherwise‚Äîif this continued, we‚Äôd lose the house in less than a year.He claimed we could sell his stocks or small house as a last resort, but I wanted to avoid that. Selling assets during a recession could lead to losses, and I feared he‚Äôd ultimately blame me if it came to that. I needed to preserve our safety net until I could secure another job, but he refused to contribute or offer solutions. The situation left me anxious and frustrated. As the primary breadwinner, I felt immense pressure. Without income, I was watching my hard-earned savings deplete, while my husband‚Äôs unwillingness to compromise or step up added to my stress.

12. I worked tirelessly to update my portfolio and started job hunting, juggling countless interviews. My in-laws were indifferent, telling me to relax, completely unaware of how competitive the job market was. To avoid interruptions, I began taking initial interviews in my neighbor's house since my in-laws often disturbed me in the living room. Despite my efforts, my husband and I argued again about the living room usage. During this time, a tornado in Dallas destroyed my in-laws‚Äô fence, trapping their car in the garage. I had to drive my MIL from Austin to Dallas‚Äîa three-hour trip‚Äîon short notice, sacrificing critical prep time for an interview the next day. Sleep-deprived and unprepared, I lost that opportunity. A couple of weeks later, I landed an interview with a major tech company. I informed my in-laws not to disturb me during this time. However, halfway through the interview, my MIL started cleaning the kitchen, humming loudly, and washing dishes, creating a huge distraction. Unable to pause the interview to address her, I resolved not to interview at home anymore and borrowed a neighbor's room for future interviews. When I casually mentioned the incident to my husband, he got defensive, blaming me for not explicitly telling his mom to stay out of the kitchen. This led to another argument. Later, when he visited Austin, he confronted his mom, yelling at her for interrupting me. He then berated everyone in the house for causing stress before storming off back to work. During our argument, he accused me of being disrespectful and overly critical, saying my complaints stressed him out. He even threatened divorce, as he had done multiple times before, and once said he‚Äôd ‚Äúbeat me up‚Äù if I were a man. He dismissed my feelings, labeling me a dictator for setting boundaries in the house I owned. His outbursts and threats left me questioning our relationship. I explained to him that in my family, the homeowner‚Äôs rules were respected, whether rent was paid or not. Growing up, I sacrificed a lot as the oldest sibling, often sleeping on the couch so my younger siblings could have a room. Giving up my dreams to support his dreams. He said I‚Äôm not sacrificing anything and being selfish. The frustrations I had buried for years surfaced‚ÄîI worked hard to own a home, yet I felt like a guest in it. George made the situation worse. He drank excessively, upsetting my SIL, yet my husband refused to address his behavior. When my family visited, they commented unprompted that the house didn‚Äôt feel like mine but like it belonged to my SIL and George. They felt uncomfortable in the living room because George dominated the space, forcing them to retreat upstairs. This validated my experience‚ÄîI no longer felt at home in my own house.Despite everything, I tried to focus on my job hunt. My husband oscillated between apologizing and lashing out, but the cycle of arguments, avoidance, and unresolved issues left me emotionally drained.

13. George‚Äôs family came to visit. I halted some of my interview prep and toured around them to Austin.¬† My husband came around the end of July to visit, but then I got an emergency message from my family that my grandpa was in the hospital that was critical. I didn‚Äôt have a good relationship with my grandpa because of the trauma I‚Äôve dealt with back in highschool that my family was very dismissive about. I booked my flight back to California when I had the biggest tech opportunity I needed to prep. I was in and out of the hospital for 2 weeks, dealing with 15 interviews. I didn‚Äôt have a space or room to interview anywhere, and my immediate family does not know I was laid off. I didn‚Äôt want to stress them out, since they have been through so much already this year. Within the second week of getting stressed out from getting answers from doctors and how my grandpa is doing worse, my family and I witnessed his last breath in the hospital and saying his goodbyes.¬† My family and I hurried to figure out last minute funeral arrangements. I paid out $20,000 out of $90,000 for the funeral. After the funeral, more family drama unraveled within my own family. I had to mitigate that. I was able to get a job offer but it was much lower income than I had in the past but it was better than nothing. I had to return back to Austin, since this job was hybrid. I flew back and had a 1 week break to recover.. I was in a super depressed state and overwhelmed with a lot of things. I didn‚Äôt want to be bothered and just wanted to recover in my bedroom for a bit. I was more stressed financially about taking a big chunk of my savings, so I ended up signing up for the energy program where the energy provider controls the thermostat for rebates. It saves about $100 per month. My in-laws were complaining about the temperature of the house to my husband, who never had control or owned it. His family still firmly believes he owns the house, but he never set up anything from the mortgage, utilities, and everything about the house. My husband messaged me at the time, but I was so depressed that I didn‚Äôt respond to anyone or left my room for 2-3 days. Then my husband blew up on me on the phone and I explained I‚Äôm not controlling the thermostat. He said the baby is sweating and I should cancel the rebate immediately, but I said that it will take time and it was off hours and I have to wait until the next business day. From my POV, I‚Äôve witnessed my mom with 4 younger siblings and we never had AC on during the summer days even when my siblings were infants. Also the fact my mom brought all my siblings to Vietnam when they were babies, that my family in Vietnam did not have AC. They are in fact very poor to afford one. So I thought if my siblings and I survived in the humid heat of Vietnam as babies, then it‚Äôs fine. Just find other ways and solutions like a fan temporarily. My husband calls me materialistic and unwilling to prioritize family comfort. Anyways it didn‚Äôt end well so I think my husband and I agreed to a divorce at this point, and I just stopped caring at this point because I‚Äôm really in deep depression and rock bottom. I didn‚Äôt even feel safe within my own home. My husband finally suggested that he will take over and cover the electricity bill - this only lasted 2 months anyways‚Ä¶ I think the part I‚Äôm upset about is knowing that we were not financially stable, that he is willing to blow off the money. Idk somehow with the no contact with my husband once again. I wrote a message about how I felt. Idk what happened, but we made up again. I visited him for 6 hours and spent the weekend with him to discuss. We talked it out and I cried a lot because of how I felt through all this year and I felt how unfair it was. My husband was gaslighting me that I was the problem and the fault, and did not take accountability that his emotional response by blowing this out of proportion and didn‚Äôt talk it out thoroughly caused all this problem in the first place. I just explained what I wanted this whole back and forth argument if his family respected the house. But he disagrees with my whole house, my rule scenario and their priority and needs are more important.We end up making up to make it work again. We said I‚Äôm not thinking as a team, and I am being selfish. I don‚Äôt think he realized I gave up a lot of things, and I don‚Äôt see how he compromised his end. He left me to go pursue his dream job that I fully support and I do not want to take away from him. Yet, when I ask for small requests I am considered selfish. It‚Äôs been his way, and he never compromised options to make me feel comfortable. Out of frustration, I told him I gave up my dreams to support his dream. I thought we initially agreed to move to Seattle soon, but I got stuck living in Texas which I was super unhappy about. He was super dismissive that I was selfish and I never sacrificed anything. At this point the conversation was a blur. Yes I‚Äôm dumb for taking him back.

14. I originally planned to give away my Lexus to my siblings to use for college - they are all still in school. They need a reliable car, and they can pass it down to each other. My brother has been asking before we bought the Tesla. I agreed, but I halted the plan when the in-laws were borrowing it. I told my husband that I wanted to give my Lexus away, but I couldn‚Äôt since the Tesla is his car. I explained if I took that away I would get shit on by his family regardless either way. My husband told me that‚Äôs not their business, and this is our car and we should be a team. My SIL & George had 3 months to look for a car. They barely looked for a car until the last 2 weeks. They scrambled.¬† The week before my car was about to get shipped off to California, the car got damaged and I was scrambling to find an auto body repair shop to fix it within the week. I was stressed about that and calling the insurance. Eventually I shipped the Lexus and I used the Tesla as my daily drive to work. My SIL and George got a brand new Tesla Model 3. I‚Äôve noticed they barely drive their Tesla Model 3 and are extra careful, but literally do not give a shit about the Tesla Y. When my husband asked to test drive the new model 3, George made an excuse oh you don‚Äôt have insurance, don't want to be liable.. My husband has a really good tract record and the safest driving car, so this is something I‚Äôve noticed.

‚Äì At this timeline my husband had a house problem back in Dallas and he didn‚Äôt have the savings to fix the water damage. I gave him 10k because that is considered an emergency fund that I allocated for.

15. So within a month, I started to focus on myself to improve my mental health and distraction. I went to work overtime. I started going to the gym everyday, leaving me Saturday to run errands and Sunday is my only rest day to recover. My MIL was not living with us, so the whole month with my SIL & George it was normal. I didn‚Äôt bother them nor they didn‚Äôt bother me, so I just focused on doing my own thing. It was going well and my relationship with my husband was better. My MIL came back again staying with us to help out watching the baby since my SIL is returning to work in October. When I started my new job, I told everyone that the company I worked for is very private and secretive. I WFH on Monday and Friday, the living room is actually off limits since they are not allowed to see my monitor screens or hear me when I‚Äôm discussing in meetings. The company I worked for monitors everything on my work laptop. I got slapped in the wrist the first week when my manager noticed someone was in the background. I told the same scenario to my MIL, she acknowledged. But the following week, she went to the living room with the baby. I told her, hey just a reminder the company I work for is private and restricted with all the work information. I noticed my MIL behavior changed towards me, but I just went on my way to focus on work, work out, do my errands and house work, and rest on Sunday. I did not have time to hang out with anyone with my current work schedule. I leave the house at 6am and I don‚Äôt return home until 8pm - this is super exhausting. My husband came down to visit the family and me again for the short holiday weekend. It wasn‚Äôt even a full day he visited. He just had a small argument with his sister about not cleaning the air fryer, something trivial. Out of nowhere my MIL said she doesn‚Äôt feel respected in this house and she blamed me for being disrespectful. My SIL and George were like wtf what is MIL talking about? MIL told them that the day she hit her head on the fridge, that I was being rude. In my POV, I did not hear her head being hit, I heard 4 thumps that she attempted to push the freezer. After the 4th push, I noticed there was something stuck between the items not closing the freezer door properly. I went up quickly and told her hey this box was in the way and didn‚Äôt close. I remember she was being snarky to me for no reason, George was there standing and didn‚Äôt help out at all. I told my POV, and my husband dismissed it super fast. Her second account was a grudge over oat milk. I pointed out she used the wrong oat milk that's meant for lattes with lots of oils and it wasn‚Äôt good for my SIL. She gave it to my SIL for her oatmeal, where the oat milk she was supposed to use had 3 ingredients.¬† I was mindful of my SIL conversation being upset that George tricked her by taking heavy cream and caused her to gain weight.. Next case, my MIL assumed I would separate my food. First of all, I never cared about who‚Äôs using the grocery. I bought groceries for the inlaws before and no one used it and it had to be thrown out. Ever since I got a new job, I don‚Äôt have time to get groceries anymore. My SIL naturally always asks if this is her item, since she‚Äôs forgetful. I just pointed out and told her what hers and mine were, but my MIL took it the wrong way that no one can have my food. My SIL noticed the misunderstanding and told my MIL that it was not true. My husband did not listen and said I was being selfish. My MIL mentioned about the living room, and I 1000% beeing telling everyone the reason it‚Äôs off limits while I was working. Husband blew up that I was being a bitch and a dictator and I‚Äôm like this is a whole misunderstanding from the MIL. I was so fed up and tired having this conversation about this AGAIN, and I blurted out ‚Äúdo you want a divorce then?‚Äù in front of his family. He packed up and left the house and drove back down. When I was discussing with my MIL, SIL, and George there was a whole misunderstanding. It was hours of conversation that my MIL was being selfish, telling me how come I don‚Äôt spend time with the family ‚Äì hello I just got back from being laid off, witnessing a death right in front of me, and I‚Äôm heads down working and don‚Äôt have time. I had my puppy but left her back in California for my family to take care of. I knew my mental state wasn‚Äôt there to take care of her. If I don‚Äôt have time to take care of my own dog, my baby, what makes you think I have time to spend time with family. She keeps invalidating like oh with family i join them after work. She said ‚ÄúI hide when it's stranger. Why do you do that?‚Äù I replied that I‚Äôm an introvert + my family does the same. we just do our own business and she keeps saying I'm wrong.. My SIL and I explained to my MIL I am an introvert and I stay in the room to recover, she said idk about for me I feel better spending time with my family. I'm super exhausted from this conservation and knowing how ignorant, selfish, and inconsiderate they all are. My MIL was lecturing me how I don‚Äôt communicate, but also contradicting myself that I am being unreasonable/complaining? What pisses me off when she says ‚ÄúThis is not John‚Äôs house‚Äù.. I explained to the family it‚Äôs not because I paid for this with my own money and he never contributed anything since day 1. They tried to lecture me like this is family and it's wrong to implement rules, and I told them I put rules cause yall are ruining my property. I worked super hard for it and I do not not want to get taken away from someone ungrateful. My in-laws started gaslighting me that I never told them the rules about my new job and the space is off limits while I was working.. Hello, ‚Äì when I complained to my neighbor to get their perspective I told them what I told my in-laws. I have recordings. My MIL keeps invalidating things when she asks questions and the way I answered how we were raised she invalidates it completely. This point I was ganged up about the car, which I knew from the beginning and told my husband I will get hated on no matter what. I had the plan since the beginning before my in laws moved to give it away. I‚Äôm like you literally give me a lecture about helping the family and it's not okay to help my side of the family?? Does it make sense? They all said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre dumb giving away 30k cars away‚Äù and?? that's family?? Does that bother you? You guys have income and adults in their mid 30s, my siblings are in college with no jobs and no car. George said ‚ÄúI would never do that for my sister‚Äù. MIL got mad like they had to rush getting the car. Mind you he wrecked the Tesla the 1st month driving the car‚Ä¶So. He‚Äôs pretty inconsiderate.¬† George starts invalidating my family‚Äôs upbringing and dissing them and me in front of my face. George is super privileged that I learned he got into Princeton because his family donated, so everything was given to him. He grew up with his parents paying for everything, and he expects that everyone pays for him and in fact it‚Äôs a poor man's mentality to refuse the offer. I‚Äôm like in Asian culture, we take care of our elders since they work so hard for us. As adults, we shouldn‚Äôt expect from parents and provide it back so they can relax and they spend most of their time providing for children. My siblings and I always refused money from our parents when they gave it. This conversation made me dislike George even more. George brought up the cat pee incident and I was being a cry baby and being rudeI explained to my SIL what happened and she agreed that he shouldn't have asked MIL to do it. I was surprised that my MIL ganged up and defended George that his stock exchange was more important than my job. The fact my MIL said the house shouldn‚Äôt be a designer house and always clean, I‚Äôm like yes it can if you maintain it nicely. Note: my in-laws live in a hoarder house style, so I am trying to break away to make it nice and minimal.I feel like my efforts to accommodate my in-laws have been dismissed, and my sacrifices have gone unrecognized. My husband has consistently prioritized his family‚Äôs needs over mine, leaving me feeling unsupported and disrespected in my own home. The repeated conflicts and lack of accountability from my in-laws and husband have taken a toll on my mental health.

Given these circumstances, I‚Äôm struggling to determine if I‚Äôm at fault for enforcing rules in my own home and expecting respect from my in-laws. I‚Äôve tried to set boundaries to protect my property and mental well-being, but my husband and his family view this as unreasonable. The in-laws moved out of the house to a new house they bought a block from my house. Apparently they had over $100k down deposit sitting there already, while I was panicking on my end and dealing with my husband‚Äôs debt.

I'm becoming resentful and would just like to get a divorce and get it over it. Do you think this relationship is salvageable at this point? Am I wasting effort and energy to try to convince my husband to make him understand my POV and what's unfair?

This is my third place in six months, so I was excited to finally settle into a space that‚Äôs close to both my school and workplace. The room is big, I have a private washroom nearby, and everything seemed perfect at first. However, things have started feeling off, and I need some outside perspective to know if I‚Äôm overthinking.

My landlord is a middle-aged widower, and initially, he seemed polite and welcoming. But on the second or third day of moving in, while I was studying at the dining table (near the kitchen), he brought up a very personal story about his manager approaching him sexually. This felt awkward and completely unprompted, as our prior conversations had only been about work or school.

Over the next few days, he kept initiating small talk, like asking about my exams or how my day was. While I don‚Äôt mind polite exchanges, I‚Äôd prefer not to have much interaction. Things escalated on the sixth day when he ordered takeout food for me. When I went downstairs, I found the living room filled with candles and two cups of coffee set out. He had left the food in the kitchen, but I declined to join him because the whole setup felt uncomfortable.

The next night, he knocked on my door twice at midnight but left when I didn‚Äôt answer. Now, every time I need to go through the living room to my room (the main door passes through it), I feel uneasy. He spends most of his evenings (4 PM to midnight) sitting on the sofa in the living room, making it hard for me to pass through without him trying to start a conversation. The kitchen is visible from the living room, so I feel watched when I cook or use the space. He often comments on what I‚Äôm doing or tries to share unnecessary house information.

When he went on a trip recently, he texted me at 6:30 AM on New Year‚Äôs Day asking if I was comfortable in the house. I‚Äôm assuming he was in a different time zone, but the message still felt intrusive.

Now, I mostly stay in my room and avoid leaving when he‚Äôs home because I feel so uncomfortable. I‚Äôm the only girl living here, and the situation is making me anxious.

Am I overthinking this? Is this normal behavior from a landlord, or should I be concerned? I just want a peaceful, private space, but I feel trapped in my own room.",3,1735947529.0,shitrentals,9,0.71,False

TW : >!descriptions of COCSA, grooming, porn addiction, hypersexuality, emotional neglect, verbal abuse, psychological abuse, physical abuse, ED, animal abuse, suicide attempts, suicidal ideation!<

A little background, my biological mother gave me up when she was younger to her sister. Sorry for the long story,

I've had a terrible porn addiction since I was 6-7(unrestricted internet access) and it got me groomed several times in my childhood, a few times got caught and only reprimanded. When I was around that age or maybe 5(memories are a bit blurry) I was at my grandma's and the girl next door(4-5) years older than me made me reenact lesbian porn for her, took pictures of me, touched me, made me touch her, lick her fingers, suck them, gag on objects and stuck them in me. It went on for 2 days and I finally told my aunt crying because I felt guilty and disgusting and she did nothing.

It's dubious at best and I can only suspec that my uncle might have also SA'd me in my sleep as I shared a bed with him and his wife when I visited, and my aunt had said he did things to her and her sisters(didn't specify anything but she sounded serious). She only told me this randomly when we were having a talk about his health worsening, which she said he deserved and explained there are reasons as to why she hadn't sent me to my grandma's after a certain age.

Eventually me and my aunt moved to the city my biological mother resided in (my aunt blames me for this anytime I lament it even though I was 7, later I found out my biomom wanted us there because her sugardaddy at the time found out about me and wanted her to take care of me. How pathetic that she only ever acted like she cared for me for her own gains.) and gradually my aunt was less and less at home, got boyfriends(which I hated, obviously) and I buried myself deeper into online communities, sadness, anger and porn. I was also into art and horseriding which my biological mother funded. My biomom wasn't around a lot but when she was she made sure to terrorize me or her dog. She chased me around a table in pure anger for eating strawberries(the table was white) in my clothes I also wore to school and would violently beat the dog too. I was blinded by her money though. I grew to see gifts and money as love since that was about the most I'd get and I rejected anything else which came rarely as it was. I was secluded and really angry most of the time, since many days I was stuck in the appartment. During that time I also encountered a man that decided to enter the building and follow me around the stairs as he was jerking it and staring at me and grabbed my hand to touch it. Luckily I found my way inside and after he waited 15 minutes he left and I cried the entire day, my neighbour from downstairs found me on the floor panicking when she came to check on me. Didn't want to report to the police because it was all a blur to me and still is. Plus, it's the police. They wouldn't have helped, the building didn't have functional surveillance anyway..

Finally one day, when I was about 10-11, detached from my aunt as I was and moneyhungry, and above all bored where I was and passionate about my horseriding, I went to spend one summer with my biomom(considering moving there to continue my passion) in the country she lived in. One day I had an emotional outburst and she tok my phone for a check. Obviously my phone was full of porn, groups where I'd talk to strangers online and bitch about my aunt to them, and all sorts of edginess you'd expect. And from then on my life became Hell on Earth. No more phone, obviously, and she decided I was to stay with her so she could ""fix and discipline me"".. WIth therapy..right? Right..? Let's just say that night she called me over to strangle me in front of her friend I came to her with, before said friend stopped her. Slapped me and beat me, sent me to bed. She also told me if I wanted to kill myself when I said it that I should go ahead and gave me a knife.

From then on I would get called a whore everyday, put to clean the house, told I didn't deserve to live, that I would've been an orphan had my aunt not taken me in, that I'm nobody's child, that I'm disgusting, evil, child of the Devil, that I'm abnormal and just like my father because I clearly don't have anything in common with her(sure buddy keep telling yourself that), that i'm nothing and if she gave birth to me she could kill me.

Other than that she would rejoice in the fact that she made me cry(she used to tell me she was a bully until 8th grade and loved beating other kids and that they feared her), brag about her abuse(""discipline"") and would sometimes provoke me for no reason-One time we were sitting at the table eating, her new sugardaddy was there with us, and I was looking around the table and at them while eating and she snapped at me and made me cry. He told her to stop and she immediately started laughing and saying she was just joking.

One time I ate a chocolate from the pantry in secret and she caught me lying and she told me she'll be cutting all my hair off the next day for it, and that the same happened to her in her childhood. I begged her in tears not to. The next day I had a pixie cut and the guy had to cut my hair while I was crying(he initially asked her not to do this to me as well.. but customer is always right apparently.) and then she looked me in the eye with her cold dead eyes and told me ""You know, a woman's hair is her power.."".

She forced me to stuff myself with food after being full because I put more than I could eat on my plate until I got sick and said if I puked she'd make me eat my vomit.

She started going horseriding with me just because all the while grounding me over every minuscule reason and forcing me to restart my progress every other 2 weeks(1 if I was lucky) which made me even more depressed and eventually I couldn't take it anymore and I quit. One time she beat me with a horsewhip in a stable for forgetting about something I had to take with me that day.

She sent me to private catholic school and I got bullied but more often marginalized for being a foreigner and not knowing the language as well. She'd always make me pray before bed and many times I had prayed in tears whispering and begging God to ""kill me"" ""end my suffering"" ""take me away"". I was also maladaptive daydreaming a lot whenever I was alone and sometimes I'd be late on my tasks when she got home and I'd get hit.

She beat me with a silicone cooking tool once for sleeping and not answering the door at 9 P.M in front of one of her friends(she didn't help me).

One time she was driving and I was in the backseat and I don't remember what she was screaming about at me but I think I talked back so she pulled over and started beating me and smashing my head around the seats and I peed myself a little. I told her about it and she smiled gleefully and said ""Yeah? Good!"".

Another time she found a few hairs around the bathroom floor(was supposed to clean all of it before I left every time) and she beat me, took me to her very and I mean VERY spacious balcony, beat me with the garden hose and then brought me a toothbrush and a bucket with water and detergent and told me to scrub all of it and be done by the time she was coming home and locked me outside in the heat(we lived in a southern country near the sea and this was in the summer) and I did it.

Another balcony incident was when we were on vacation in Mexico and we were in bed reading. She noticed I was holding my book ""folded"" so I could hold it in one hand and she warned me not to do it again. I did it again, without realizing, so then she stood up and grabbed me by my hair, slammed me into the floor and started hitting me in the head with her fists and hands, dragged me around by my hair and when I started screaming louder she told me to be quiet. It hurt so much I couldn't stop so she slammed my head a few times into the wooden floor and one if those times my mouth was open from wailing so one of my teeth ended up a little chipped and I saw a little white thing fly across the floor. I checked later and it was indeed as I thought. She also used her silicone slipper on me to beat me all over my back since I was curled up on the floor. Then she dragged me by my hair around the room a few times and settled on locking me on the EXTREMELY small balcony at night to sleep under the small coffee table that barely fit in there. She said I deserved it. At some point she came to throw a blanket at me and it had started raining. I don't remember when exactly she let me back in but I slept there for a while. I had black bruises all over my back the next day.

She beat me everyday while I was there as well and she was pregnant at the time. Anytime she'd bleed from her ""stress""(getting inexplicably mad at me and beating me} she'd tell me I'm evil and trying to kill her baby and that I'll be a baby killer.(She got into a  car accident where she ended up killing a little girl at one point ironically)

She would take pictures of me when humiliating me and send them to my aunt until my aunt got tired and threatened her with the police(a lot of people know her in our town since she is known as the town's whore) finally and my biomom asked me if I wanted to go home around that time. I was so broken down by her abuse I told her no, that I needed more discipline, that I was evil and didn't deserve to go back to my aunt, that I had to pay for my sins, and I believed myself fully. I recall that moment and it's almost like I was some drone programmed by abuse.

While I stayed with her she once beat her dog and hit it against the railways of her balcony, which broke its leg, for chewing her lingerie. She told me later that she intended on throwing it off the balcony at first.

I used to fantasize about putting an end to either her life or mine very often at night. I didn't even have a TV in my room but I'd often stay up since I couldn't sleep.

I don't know what to call them but I've had chronic nightmares ever since to this day.

Eventually I went back to our town at around 12 years old sometime in the winter and she tormented me a while longer..She would sexualize me? One time I was leaning ahead on a table coloring and she told me it's inappropriate to sit like that in front of her boyfriend? I was sent back to my aunt eventually. We got kicked out of the appartment she only received because of me, she said she wouldn't be helping us anymore and we had to move to a studio appartment and struggle in a bad area for years. I still wasn't allowed a phone and when I'd gotten my hands on one again I contacted some of my ex online mutuals and of course, porn. Got caught again, my aunt hit my head into the bathroom sink(My head was swollen the next day at school but she denies ever having done this so one day I gave up bringing it up.) Anytime I did something bad she'd threaten me with sending me back to my biomom for her to abuse me again. I was always paranoid so bad that one time she rang my Nokia she gave me before I left for school and I couldn't find it while I was in a hurry and I started wailing and screaming about how I'd ""kill myself"". I was so loud when I left a police car passed by and I'm sure it was for me.

Later I got a phone for some time but I was always paranoid about it getting checked which it did multiple times. One time it had been a long time since it hadn't happened and I had quite a few ""friends""(most weren't true friends but that's okay, I wanted friends, I wanted to socialize. Below is the story of how she took my phone again, mocking me on an outing with her friends that I must be lonely not to have friends anymore later.

\>She came home accusing me of breaking her trust again and demanding my phone. She kept going while I withheld my phone and while I kept saying ""Mommy what happened?"" since I was confused. She told me that I must love being a whore. and that apparently one of our acquaintances informed her that SOMEONE at A PUBLIC RESTAURANT said something along the lines of ""Everyone cums allll over \_ONE OF MY VERY COMMON NAMES\_"" (I was around 13-14). I told her it wasn't true and she wouldn't believe me. I tried grabbing my phone from her hand and she later told everyone I wanted to beat her. Went to my room and slashed my wrists in a rush of adrenaline. I didn't know how deep the slashes needed to be so I'm only left with scars now, She walked into my room while I was staring at my wrists and sniffling on the floor curled up and she didn't pay me any mind. Later she saw and called me stupid.

Another time she accused me of stealing money from her. When she found said money she announced it to me after screaming at me and calling me a ""deceitful"" viper and didn't even apologize.

While on the street we saw an overweight woman and she said I'd end up like her and made various comments of the like which in turn made me have an ED for 2 years. Then started commenting on how skinny I am and that I should eat.

Last time I saw my biomom she told me I shouldn't be mad she loves her kids.(I'm not mad or upset, she has a golden child and a black sheep in my siblings like any self respecting narcissist and if I had to live with her I know I would have been the black sheep.) When I said I'm okay calmly she got offended and said I should be. That she just couldn't love me because I was the ""failed experiment"". And now she knows better(no she doesn't but I don't care anymore.)

My aunt also cut her off recently. I'm set to see a therapist soon.

My porn addiction worsened over time, I was also addicted to sexting and cybersex. I turned it into my coping mechanism along the years and I could stay in bed for hours(up to 15+ at a time) looking at it, sexting randoms, etc. I only got more attentionseeking and worse over time. I'm deeply disgusted by myself now that I've finally quit cold turkey and every day I wonder why couldn't I have gotten therapy right away.

Ôøº These facilities are situated at:

Anheuser Busch Sports Park: 4990 Olentangy River Rd., 43214

Dodge Park and Community Center: 667 Sullivant Ave., 43215

Scioto Southland Park: 3901 Parsons Ave., 43207

Residents can dispose of food scraps at these sites free of charge, 24/7. The collected waste is transported weekly by Compost Clubhouse to a composting facility in London, Ohio, diverting it from the Franklin County Sanitary Landfill, which receives nearly 1 million pounds of food waste daily. This initiative supports the city‚Äôs Climate Action Plan, aiming for a 90% reduction in organic waste at the landfill by 2050. The program received grant support from the Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio (SWACO). The first 300 residents who registered were eligible for complimentary household buckets to collect and transport food scraps, though participation is open to all residents using their own containers. Acceptable items for composting include fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy, meats, coffee grounds, and soiled non-coated paper products.

I don't really mind the comments and brush them off but today at a job interview for fast food I was (understandibly) told I needed to have it tied up tightly and I can't really get it into a tight bun because it's not really long enough.

People are now telling me they can't even bare to look at me and that I look like a whole different person üò≠ IDK what to do!

I get that a coffee shop isn't a fashion contest but I'm low-key starting to get self conscious (I thought it looked fine tied up!) I'm just wondering what anyone's else's routines are for situations like these, (having extremely poofy hair and being told to really tie it down and control it while you work, without looking ugly)

3c low porosity mixed hair. 
My routine is pretty much just wash scalp with sulfate free shampoo when I feel like it's too oily. This can be either every four or five days. 

I usually rinse it everyday with water because trynna touch low porosity hair when it's dry is almost impossible without having it poof (like the 4th pic after waking up from a nap)

My psychiatrist has been very slow in giving me medication. He started me off on the lowest dose possible, 10mg, and will keep me on it for a month until increasing the prescription by 10mg and so on and so forth.

As a result, I'm taking Vyvanse but I'm not seeing any effects just yet. I'm getting impatient because I seriously need to start doing more, so I've been looking into other options.

One such option is Coffee. I'm not a coffee drinker, I simply never tried it. Would it be okay to have coffee in an attempt to energize myself? Do those who take ADHD Meds find coffee and caffeine still have an energizing effect, or is it nullified?",4,1735947260.0,ADHD,6,1.0,False

I'm getting to my wits end with Tinder, Bumble, Hinge etc. to the point I'm considering running a dating night. Probably age-restricted, since I don't want 20yo girls being hit on by 50yo balding men.

For women in particular, I want to know what you'd be looking out for in an event. 

* What format would make you interested in going? Speed dating, pre-selected pairing by the host/you, centred around an activity (mini golf, garden bingo, etc.)
* What safety/inclusion considerations should I make?
* Location, organisers, etc.

  
Because I want to keep this as low-cost for everyone, and also safe, I'd probably like this to be a non-alcoholic event. Something with like coffee and tea, instead of booze. IME having to buy six women drinks at the Cube gets expensive quick and I'm not comfortable with encouraging people to intoxicate their dates.

Chapter 1 is ""done"" for now and wanted any constructive criticism or thoughts on what I've written. This is the first thing I've put to paper so far.","Incredible heat rose to the roof of the foundry, the extraction units could barely keep up. Fumes and sweltering heat consumed all within. Logar wiped the sweat of his brow onto his forearm leaving a streak of black across his face. He took a moment to rest his hammering arm, the familiar sound of metal striking metal was still ringing in his ears. Bliss. He took a large drink from his flask, some overspilling and running down his chin. He ran his hand through his beard, his callouses catching his skin as he did, and wiped it on his thigh. Gripping his hammer once again, he returns his metal to the forge to reheat and begin striking once more. Muffled voices and a symphony of hammer-strikes fill his ears.

Clang.

The clock reads 5 minutes until days end.

Clang.

Sweat drips onto the anvil.

Clang.  

The metal quivers under each strike, as if it fears the hammer.

Clang.

The alarm sounds, the orchestra of hammers can be heard entering a crescendo as the day ends. Logar‚Äôs grip loosens on his hammer as his white knuckles return to their normal colour. Slipping the handle through the loop on his belt he puts his bay into shutdown, the machinery slows as the heat starts to fade. Beginning the long walk through the cavernous foundry back to the smith‚Äôs quarters he runs one of his hands over his stubble-covered head, his hand slowing as if it were running over coarse sandpaper, as he scans the other bays to see how others are squaring up to his quota.

‚ÄúHow many is that today then Thor?‚Äù a younger voice questions him from behind. Thor, an unwelcome nickname given to Logar thanks to his stature and finesse with a hammer. ‚ÄúFour.‚Äù Logar replies. ‚ÄúFour?! We‚Äôve only just managed that between the three of us.‚Äù The voice retorts. Logar looks over his shoulder at the three younger men behind him. The trio of short, wiry individuals had tired deep-set eyes and were visibly fatigued, all at least 1 foot shorter than Logar. ‚ÄúHmm‚Äù he grunts, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got hammers heavier than you three‚Äù. The half wry smile unhidden from his face. The younger men stay quiet as they storm passed Logar.  
‚ÄúSuch a sharp mind for a man named Thor‚Äù a husky voice said mockingly from a nearby bay. ‚ÄúNot as sharp as yours I fear Pol‚Äù Logar replied slowing his pace to face the bay. The husky voice turns to face Logar. Opolli. A tall, broad, red-headed woman and good friend, her hair coiled in a plait sat neatly on the top of her head. ‚ÄúGood to see you‚Äù she said as she extended her arm toward Logar. ‚ÄúYou too Pol‚Äù Logar replied taking her hand and bringing them into a shoulder to chest hug.

‚ÄúFour is pretty impressi-‚Äú ‚ÄúSix‚Äù Logar interrupts. Pol looks curiously at Logar, ‚ÄúWhy lie to them?‚Äù ‚ÄúThey might try harder with a more reasonable goal to catch‚Äù Logar grumbles sternly. Pol chuckles. ‚ÄúThey still feel inadequate y'know.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf they keep letting children in the foundry, what do you expect?‚Äù Logar says with a sarcastic smile. Pol smiles as she begins to move toward the catwalk, placing a hand on Logars upper back. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get cleaned up, I think it‚Äôs my turn to get food.‚Äù

Walking along the catwalk both are silent in the company of a good friend, drinking in the remaining heat and smell of something so familiar to them both. Beneath the catwalk are rows of conveyers bringing material into the machines, flooded with scrap metal from across the system.

Arriving back to the smiths‚Äô quarters, they both find their locker and begin to undress and head to the shared shower block. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a new one‚Äù says Pol looking at a burn on Logars upper-back. ‚ÄúBouncing sparks. Nothing a quick pat out couldn‚Äôt fix‚Äù he replies. Logar grabs his towel and starts to pace over to the shower doors, waiting for Pol as she unties her plait. They continue to walk into the shared showers together and choose the first two they come across.
Logar places both hands on the wall and lets his head drop between his arms. The water slowly turning black as it ran down his body, wincing as the hot water streams across the burn. The air was thick with steam and loud with the sound of running water, Logar could just make our Pol‚Äôs hair across the block. Logar made his way back to the changing room and noticed a few of the smiths listening intently to the monitor in the corner of the quarters.

‚ÄúHouse Sanguinis will be landing on Beskin-5 tonight to greet the local leaders.‚Äù The voice from the monitor claimed.

Rumours and conspiracy started to spark between the smiths.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard they‚Äôre conscripting people for the war.‚Äù 
‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard they‚Äôre only here to perform a tithe on the wealthy.‚Äù
‚ÄúI was told the tithe will be on the weak.‚Äù

Pol overheard these claims as she was walking back into the quarters, running her towel through her hair, ‚ÄúL, what happened the last time they were here?‚Äù
  
‚ÄúThey left.‚Äù Logar replied with disdain in his tone. ‚ÄúThey come, they eat, they leave. The rumours are always the same.‚Äù Pol smiles as if she knew Logars answer before he spoke. 

‚ÄúWhat if you‚Äôre wrong this time?‚Äù spoke two of the other smiths in unison. 

‚ÄúThen Pol can have my hammer‚Äù his eyes flicking to her for just a moment as she drops her towel. 
‚ÄúWow, such a gift from Thor himself. The gods truly bless me this day‚Äù she replies sarcastically as she begins to get dressed. 
Logar lets out a sharp exhale through his nose, the corner of his mouth curling into a smile. ‚ÄúOn second thought, you can have my quota instead.‚Äù
  
‚ÄúNow, now, no need to be vengeful‚Äù Pol replies.

The monitor speaks once more ‚ÄúWar-Bishop Margrave plans to visit Beskin-3 next and will be making planetfall in the weeks to come.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs he doing here?‚Äù Logar spoke directly to Pol. Pol, bemused with Logar‚Äôs words replies ‚ÄúWho knows? Margrave being here doesn‚Äôt change anything.‚Äù Logar raises an eyebrow then turns to get dressed, ‚ÄúWhat are we eating tonight?‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI was thinking the place on the 19th Floor‚Äù replied Pol. Logar nods in reply.

They walk toward the exit of the foundry; the automatic doors open revealing the city of Kilner. Kilner, one of the few vast super-cities found on Beskin-3, spanned from the surface into the lower atmosphere. Hundreds of floors spanned the city for every level of society, labour workers like Logar and Pol were stuck in the bottom tier of floors, the upper tiers were reserved for the elite. The foundries were placed on the lower levels of the city for easy access to natural resources, the ship ports and to warm the floors above. The living quarters could shift if a promotion was given, the individual's living space would be moved to an appropriate floor via the shifting mechanisms within the city. Kilner has a population of around 13.5 billion, humans and other space faring species together in a mixing-pot.

Pol presses the button to call the transporter then wanders toward the edge of the walkway to investigate the service shaft. She turns her head upwards to see the sprawl of the city above.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been above Floor 25, never needed to.‚Äù She states.
‚ÄúWhy would you need to?‚Äù
‚ÄúOverheard an officer saying there‚Äôs a nice caf√© on 27.‚Äù  
‚ÄúOverpriced and undercooked no doubt‚Äù  
The transporter doors open. Black glass walls and the lights were a stark contrast to the foundry floor, Pol places her palm on the rear panel as a keypad displays itself above her hand. She dials 19 as the panel scans her palm. The doors close swiftly but softly behind them as the transporter shifts into position. They watch together as the number rises from -8 up to 19. 

They both stand firm whilst the transporter is fired vertically through the floors above. Logar is watching through one of the glass walls as they flash by the living quarters, engineering and optics. A deep hum can be heard followed by a bass thump as each floor passes by. An electric whirl whistles in the background met with a clunk as the transporter locks into place on Floor 19.

Pol, who was poised to leap out of the transporter from the start, moves quickly out and onto Floor 19. 19 was a vast entertainment floor with a large portion open air. One of the few floors that you can see the sky, a rarity in Kilner, Logar and Pol take their first look at the outside world today. Logar takes a deep breath almost as if to try and catch fresh air, all he smells is food stalls, oil and some of the unwashed populace. Away from the open-air area, streets and alleyways run down either side of the floor giving access to food, shops and leisure.  

They begin to both move through the crowds toward a street on the east side of the floor, Logar following Pol‚Äôs red hair through the horde. Signs litter the alleyways that break off from the street. Most written in languages from around the cluster that Logar didn‚Äôt understand, his translation chip only works on spoken word, in an array of brightly lit warped shapes and symbols. Distracted by the signs he loses sight of Pol in the crowd; he scans the immediate area with no luck. Logar squinted his eyes as he looked up at the vast blinding corporate billboards, flicking between House Sanguin tapestry to adverts for new optics, it felt like they were burning out his retina.

Logar felt a searching hand scan his forearm then clutch his hand. Pol pulled him through the crowd over the edges of the street. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been here hundreds of times and every time its overwhelming.‚Äù Logar speaks whilst rubbing his thumb and middle finger over his eyes. Pol smiles as she continues to lead Logar through the crowd toward the restaurant, ‚ÄúNot much further.‚Äù They skittered along the edge of the crowd passing another 4 alleyways before arriving at the diner. 

‚ÄúI see they never came up with a better name for this place.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean? Floor 19 Diner just rolls off the tongue‚Äù laughs Pol.

Pol leads Logar to her usual table. Neither of them takes a menu, Pol knows what they both want.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know a Fisco worked here‚Äù says Logar quietly.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs new. She‚Äôs gorgeous, isn‚Äôt she?‚Äù

Logar looked over at the Fisco, a species of human & Fizzen hybrid. They are taller than your average human, slender, and have pale peach-green skin with scale-like freckles dotted across their body. Piercing yellow eyes, sharp cheekbones and slim lips frame her face. The Fisco noticed Logars gaze and proceeded to glide and weave through tables toward them.
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôll it be, hon?‚Äù approached the Fisco.
Pol answers ‚ÄúSteak and eggs, two please‚Äù
‚ÄúCoffee?‚Äù
‚ÄúPlease.‚Äù
The Fisco slinks away.
Logar gives Pol a knowing look, raising one eyebrow.
‚ÄúYou always order the same thing.‚Äù  
Logar chuckles, she‚Äôs right.
‚ÄúHave you heard about the Thessen in the foundry across the floor?‚Äù.
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre big. They‚Äôre strong. If they can coordinate their bulk they‚Äôll make fine smiths.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt feel intimidated then?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy would I? They should be better than us. If they aren't, they won‚Äôt last long.‚Äù

The Fisco re-appears with their food, ‚ÄúTwo Steak and Eggs.‚Äù She paused. ‚ÄúI made sure you got the big one.‚Äù She said placing her hand on Logar‚Äôs shoulder, running it down to his bicep and after giving it a playful squeeze, she floated away. Logar‚Äôs face turns red with an embarrassed smile.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôd eat you alive‚Äù Pol, with half an egg in her mouth, mumbled.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt doubt it.‚Äù

As they continue eating their meal they watch as crowds of human and alien alike burst through the bustling street outside. The muffled news report from earlier in the day can be heard playing from one of the billboards above.

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm going to head home after this, it‚Äôs been a long day.‚Äù  
‚ÄúI was thinking the same‚Äù remarked Pol, ‚ÄúAre you still on 3?‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, you‚Äôre on 2, right?‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah, feel free to come over and have a night cap.‚Äù
‚ÄúNot tonight, Pol, maybe another day‚Äù replies Logar.

Pol lets out a dejected smile, Logar‚Äôs answer never changes. She‚Äôd just be grateful for the company. As they stand up to leave, Logar swigs at the dregs of his coffee. Pol walks to toward the door with purpose, keen to get back to her hab. Logar makes eye-contact with the Fisco on the way to the door, she smiles softly. He smiles shyly in reply.

They push their way through the street in an attempt to make their way back to the transporters. Logar can hear shouting from a nearby alleyway, he sidles over towards the noise, a large crowd has gathered around a preaching loyalist.  

‚ÄúHouse Sanguinis is the true ruler of the cluster, our blood runs deep!‚Äù he shouts into the aether, his eyes seemingly looking at nothing above.
‚ÄúThe dogs come to help. The void calls!‚Äù his hollow voice cried, speaking in riddles.
‚ÄúThe machines are waiting. Only blood can sate their thirst.‚Äù The final word almost sounding painful to speak. Dropping to his knees as if gravity had pulled him into submission, he bowed his head and returned to silence.

The crowd moved closer to the man as Pol pulled Logar by his shirt to the back of the group. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs take our chance to leave whilst this lot are occupied.‚Äù 
Logar nodded, moving himself alongside Pol toward the transporters. The huge number of transporters on this floor meant they didn‚Äôt have to wait long. They dart into an empty transporter as its occupants leave, Pol quickly taps 2 then 3 whilst holding her hand on the reader. The doors close with just the two of them inside, not a moment after the door closes the transporter darts downwards.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll catch you in a few days, I‚Äôm on some weird rotations to cover for an injury‚Äù Pol says.
‚ÄúShame, I turned that down. I prefer my routine.‚Äù  
‚ÄúI could do with the extra creds‚Äù
The transporter arrives at 3, the visible difference between the public levels and the hab levels was obvious. Pol gave Logar a quick hug before he stepped out into the dimly lit hallway.
‚ÄúNight.‚Äù
‚ÄúNight.‚Äù
Logar takes a deep breath and continues walking, with passing thoughts about the words of the preacher. He shrugs off the thoughts, it‚Äôs just preachers being preachers, they exist to sow trust in Sanguinis and distrust in others.
Arriving at his hab, he places his hand on the scanner and the door slides open revealing his hab. It was small, but it was home. His bed in one corner, his communicator in another. The walls were unpainted, as abiding with hab policy, still their original metallic sheen. He wasn‚Äôt lucky enough to get a real window, but he did have a window monitor that he could choose his view. The view never changed, it was always the skies of Harlep-9, permanent sunset on a tidally locked planet with ashen mauve skies.
Logar used each foot to take off the others shoe before turning and falling onto his bed. He closed his eyes just for a moment.
His alarm was blaring, it was morning already.  
Realising he hadn‚Äôt removed his clothes from the night before his hand slammed down to turn his alarm off.
The next 4 weeks we‚Äôre no different. Wake up, work, eat, sleep.  
32 days pass with no change.  
Day 33, he isn‚Äôt woken by his usual alarm. Instead it has changed to broadcast the arrival of War-Bishop Margrave to Kilner.  
‚ÄúLeader of house Sanguinis, War-Bishop Margrave arrived in Kilner this morning. He will be visiting Mayor Werth, the infirmaries on floor 29 through 32, the engineering bay on floor 9 and the foundries on floor -8‚Äù
Logar‚Äôs communicator immediately pinged in the corner, a message from Pol.
‚ÄúShit‚Äù the message read.
Ping.
‚ÄúIs this bad news?‚Äù the second message read.
Logar stopped for a moment in thought.  
‚ÄúComms. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs nothing, he has to go somewhere, otherwise no-one would believe he came. Send Pol.‚Äù  
Ping.
‚ÄúI hope you‚Äôre right‚Äù the final message read.
Logar, not trusting his own words, knew what this meant. This was The Call.

What beans to buy for equivalent taste? My wife dislikes acidity or tartness - loves chocolatey, nutty, caramelized flavors in coffee which according to her only starbucks has given thusfar. I quite like volcanica and a few other roasters - any suggestions? (She dislikes peets and most of their roasts simply because of a particular tartness in their roasts - even the ones they say they do not have them - even in darker roasts she feels it). Appreciate advice.

What would you look for in a good dating event?,"I'm (25M Aussie) thinking of hosting a a dating event in my town (Toowoomba) because, let's be honest, Tinder fucking sucks. Meeting people in person is always way better and noone else is running one. I'd like to know:

*  What format works best (I.E. speed dating, people paired with people, treasure hunt etc.)
* What safety/comfort things would make it more appealing to go? No point setting this up if it's only a bunch of guys who turn up
* How can we encourage women to get involved too? I don't want all the pressure to be on the guys to approach throughout the event. That'll just make it really intense for the girls and make it really daunting for the blokes. Everyone should be getting involved!

  
If you've run these events before, I'd really love to know your thoughts. What went well, how did you do it, what didn't work so well, etc.

  
Also, the way I have it in my head is making it a non-alcoholic event (remove a potential barrier/cost and keep it safer). Something like, sit down with a coffee with your date, or something. Thoughts?

Austin Reaves is a real life Kirby. I have watched this man develop his handle mid season his rookie year, to slowly become this paint driving hungry beast. Went from averaging less than 10 ppg to averaging a double double. At 6'5 and 206 lbs, he somehow manages to OUTWORK bigs on offensive boards.

His ability to seek contact while driving the paint, his ball handle, and ability to finish at the rim -- it's unreal. I can‚Äôt unsee the impact DLo has had on his game. Not to mention the likes of Rajan Rondo who he's had the privilege of soaking up game from early on as well.

Lets talk about his obsession with being an elite passer... I can‚Äôt unsee LeBron and that innate desire to play the game ""the right way"".

Austin Reaves is psychotic about developing his skillset, and his sponge-like ability to absorb new things is on full display for our enjoyment at a critical point in our season.

He's hit some rough spells but Austin Tyler Reaves is truly HIM -- sky is the limit & I'm fucking stoked he's a Laker.

So I recently graduated college and moved back from Florida to Virginia. Back in 2021 I was diagnosed with POTS and subsequently Hashimotos. I worked with some amazing holistic doctors to get me back to a functional state and throughout 2022 I improved significantly after learning I had a gluten allergy and going gluten free. I also did a strict AIP diet but eventually got back to my normal diet minus the gluten. While I was in school I mostly avoided dairy but it wasn't a hard rule, I would only consume it on occasion but otherwise bought dairy free products. Now that I've been home, I feel that I consume more dairy like coffee creamer and ice cream and I now believe I'm allergic to this and stopped consuming it a couple weeks ago. 

For almost a month now, I've been experiencing what I can only describe as air hunger. I'm still able to breathe, but at times it feels as though I can't get a full satisfying breath. Like, out of 10 breaths maybe I can get one that is deep and filling my lungs, other time its as if my lungs are being stopped by my chest. It's a weird and terrifying sensation. If my breathing is 'normal' and not deep it's not as bad but it sucks feeling like I can't do a deep breath. I'm wondering if this is a thiamine deficiency because at first I was worried it was a heart problem but I haven't had any chest pain or heart issues in the past and at times it doesn't seem to be a bother at all like when I am asleep. 

Anyway over the summer my worst symptoms I experienced were occasional brain fog sometimes severe, general inflammation and shooting pains around my upper back a bit below my shoulder, palpitations from my POTS, watery eyes, that fullness feeling in the neck, chest soreness (the ER doc said its most likely hashis inflammation after making sure my heart was fine), and now this air hunger that absolutely sucks and makes me feel like I can't breathe automatically.  I'm planning to see a primary care in a few weeks to establish one and get more tests done and likely get referred to an endocrinologist but I'm wondering if anyone has any idea on what I could be feeling or what has worked for them. I don't currently know my levels since I haven't had labs done in a couple years but I assume my antibodies are up again. Just really annoying considering I was functional and feeling good and balancing a busy schedule in college and now I feel like I have to go through another gauntlet just to figure out what's wrong with me again. Slight rant at the end but any tips or suggestions or even words of encouragement/hope would be greatly appreciated. ",2,1735946547.0,Hashimotos,4,1.0,False

After those months he convinced me that he was ‚Äúthe one‚Äù and we started dating.. in that time he was ‚Äúvisiting‚Äù me in the city I was living in came to find out he had moved to that city so he was staying in a friends parents house. 
I had heard of this friend a few times in his passing remarks he would say ‚Äúoh you and *******¬†‚Äú are so alike he also always tells me about this or about that.
One day while he was staying in this guys friends house, this friend and his family came to visit. My now ex but at the time boyfriend, Specifically told me, the parents and sister were going to be there. Not one mention about his friend and I remember 2 things ‚Ä¶ when I asked about the friend not visiting he said something like ‚Äúoh maybe he‚Äôll join them later‚Äù and when I wanted to put makeup on to meet the parents because I was feeling very tired and wanted to put my best foot forward he( my boyfriend) made such a problem about me putting on makeup. 

So we walk into the house I meet the parents greet them and thank them for having him/ us and while waiting for the sister to come out. I hear a voice come out from the opposite direction and like a fiction movie. I see this guy, my heart stopped my throat ran dry and my lips parted as my jaw dropped. I‚Äôd never seen someone more my type than this guy.. I snap back to reality and try to continue talking while my brain is fuzzy. He greets my ex and comes over to greet me when I tell you I lost all sense in my brain, which does not happen to me often EVER!! I move over to the kitchen to make a coffee trying to gather myself and the friend comes over to greet me properly he starts talking to me and not only is he completely physically my type but he‚Äôs also completely kind hearted, nice and funny!!! Things I can say my ex was not in the sense that he would only do these things when people are watching.
I can feel this friend‚Äôs energy and it‚Äôs so calm collected and humble. 

Needless to say he has lived rent free RENT FREE in my mind since that day. I never saw him again but I have always wondered if there was a way I would be able to somehow make something happen between the friend and I or does it go against every law / code or rule‚Ä¶? 
I don‚Äôt plan on ever speaking to my ex he abused me before I broke up with him - he must have been under the impression that I would stay because mentally he had been psychologically abusing me so by the time it happened physically he probably thought I would stay. 
Anyway.. that‚Äôs that‚Ä¶ would it be wrong of me to pursuit the friend or is it something I can try .. he could still decline me which I honestly wouldn‚Äôt mind I just believe he could be my dream guy and wouldn‚Äôt want to leave that stone unturned.",1,1735946536.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

He was very nice & said I was so beautiful, we got on really well in those short 3 minutes, he asked for my number and I gave it to him.

He texted me almost straight away to say he wanted to meet me and go for some coffee, but I unfortunately had to fly back home to England.

I visited Scotland again on the 30th December. He said he absolutely wanted to meet me. I met him and we had an amazing time. He kissed me at the end, on the lips and on my hand and asked me multiple times if I wanted to see him again, I said yes definitely.

After the date, he texted me to say ""enjoy your show"" with a smiley face, because I had booked to see a theatre show while I was there.

I flew back the next morning.

I decided to text him today because I hadn‚Äôt heard from him since after the date evening.

heres the update after I just texted him:

me = ""when do you think we can see each other again, I really liked you""

him = good morning, yes we will arrange something again, do you plan on coming to scotland again soon?

me = no plans

him = i can come over to you. possibly around march, got a few things here to do first

me = ok thats good id really like to see you if you come

I‚Äôve never had food intolerances from cheese or coffee before either.

3 weeks postpartum at about midnight until 7am I woke up with bad stomach pain from the sternum to under right rib that radiated to the middle right back - no nausea or vomiting just pain that wouldn‚Äôt subside (that day ate rich like cream cheese and did have coffee)

 3 days later ate more cream cheese and coffee and same thing and pain happened but from 9pm/2am but I did something bad that night - I hopped on google and well now I am convinced I have pancreatic issues (pc) since then I haven‚Äôt been able to eat, water stool because I haven‚Äôt eaten and I am just constantly shaking and obsessing over this.

The recent tests I have had are liver bloodwork is great and so is my bilirubin (2 years are go it was at 0 then  November it was 12 p/mol and a few days later 9/pmol 

I had a full abdominal ct scan with contrast about 6-7 years ago and a full body pet scan about 10 years ago - so I am trying to calm myself that the c word is slow growing and it could have been picked up on those tests! 

No severe weight loss (minus from having my baby) my appetite and bowel movements were normal up until 4 days ago when my anxiety heightened from the google search! 

I do have a dr app on Tuesday and will be asking for an ultrasound but I need some reassurance please I can‚Äôt live like this it‚Äôs so debilitating. I should also add that the pain is never sharp just dull and worse when I am hyper fixated on it!

I know you‚Äôre hesitant to trust again. I know you‚Äôre scared and scarred. But I‚Äôm here now. And even if I can never understand. I can still try. 

The rain left its mark on you. And I know your skies have been forever gray in the wake of me. And while I can never change what you went through. I can at least try to make amends for it. 

It was never my goal. You know me. And I guess I should‚Äôve known you. But hindsight is 20/20. A sorry only goes so far. But I‚Äôll repeat it on and on. Until I die. 

To put you first. To go out of my way. To patch your cuts up just fine. That‚Äôs all you wanted. And I think I can help with that. 

It takes so little to mend your shattered heart. I know. A cup of coffee or a late night dinner and all of a sudden your smile is real again.

Have had my allotment a couple of years (just) and this year think I need to focus on building up the beds. I have ten raised beds I inherited - some taken up by perennial fruit: gooseberries (though not a very productive bush tbh), rhubarb and raspberries. I have two for flowers (in theory - bit weedy at the moment) So I have 6 beds currently I want to put to work. 

I want to revitalise the beds before putting in more perennials, self seeders, and some easy crops. They are pretty weed blighted - marestail and bindweed are rampant - so I'm trying no dig after an initial weed/ turnover, with cardboard laid down. My question is about the material on top, and how to build it up without going bankrupt. 

I have my own compost heap but it barely generates enough compost to cover one bed. I will have to buy some but I'd like not to spend a fortune on filling these beds - they are c.1.5m x 1.5m each and about a plank deep (though the planks will need replacing soon I fear). They are low on volume as well as nutrients at the moment.

For free, I have access to:

- wood chip - some is new (Christmas trees, smells divine but very fresh) but some is old - we are getting the remains of some older trees which have fallen in recent storms, and so much less fresh/ closer to breaking down
- horse manure - takes 3 sacks to cover one raised bed a couple of inches (and that's all I can fit in my boot in one trip)
- cardboard - almost limitless
- kitchen scraps - I am saving all the coffee, fruit, and veg waste I can (and occasional wood ash). At the moment I dump it on my compost heap.

Any suggestions for how to bulk up volume and nutrients in my raised beds?!

1hszzxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/PercyJacksonfanfic/comments/1hszzxo/disasterus_name/,Disasterus Name,"When Tony Stark became a father after a one-night stand, he thought naming his son after figures from Greek mythology was a clever nod to his love of ancient tales. He settled on Kronos Hephaestus Stark, a name that made him chuckle every time he said it out loud.

But what Tony didn‚Äôt know was that the mother of his child wasn‚Äôt some random person he met at a gala. She was Apollo, the Greek god of the sun, prophecy, music, and poetry. Of course, Apollo had conveniently forgotten to mention the whole ‚Äúgod‚Äù thing. In Tony‚Äôs defense, how was he supposed to guess? It wasn‚Äôt like there was a checklist for identifying shapeshifting deities.

Years later, when Kronos‚Äîor as Tony fondly called him, ""Kro""‚Äîstarted showing signs of being... different, Tony chalked it up to genetics. Bright, impossibly charming, and with an uncanny ability to predict things before they happened, Kro seemed like a prodigy. Tony, ever the genius, figured his son was just taking after him.

Until the kid accidentally set Stark Tower‚Äôs roof garden on fire. With his bare hands.


---

Chiron sighed as he watched the newest demigod arrive at Camp Half-Blood, led reluctantly by his mortal father. It wasn‚Äôt hard to tell whose child this boy was. Blond hair, a radiant smile, and an aura of sunlight that practically screamed Apollo.

Dionysus, lounging at a nearby table, didn‚Äôt even bother to look up from his poker game. ‚ÄúAnother one?‚Äù he muttered, glaring at the satyr who had brought the boy.

‚ÄúMore of a liability than usual,‚Äù Chiron murmured, glancing over at the man who had escorted the child. The man was currently arguing with a nymph about the ‚Äústructural flaws‚Äù in Camp Half-Blood‚Äôs design.

Tony Stark was not having a good day.


---

Tony had finally gotten the full story. Apollo‚Äîhis kid‚Äôs other parent‚Äîhad decided to pop in for a little divine intervention. The god showed up in a flash of golden light, as dramatic as Tony had been warned Greek deities could be.

‚ÄúYou named him Kronos?‚Äù Apollo had asked, utterly aghast.

‚ÄúWell, excuse me for not realizing I was naming the spawn of a god,‚Äù Tony had shot back, arms crossed defensively. ‚ÄúI thought it was clever!‚Äù

Apollo had groaned. ‚ÄúYou named him after the Titan who ate his children! And Hephaestus? He‚Äôs your uncle! It‚Äôs like naming your kid after the family weirdos. No offense to Hephaestus.‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean,‚Äù Tony had muttered under his breath, ‚Äúyou did sleep with me.‚Äù

Kro, meanwhile, was grinning ear to ear, thrilled to learn that his other parent was the literal sun god. ‚ÄúDoes this mean I get cool powers?‚Äù he asked, his voice practically vibrating with excitement.

Apollo had sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. ‚ÄúYes, kid. It does.‚Äù


---

Now at Camp Half-Blood, Kronos stood awkwardly as Chiron introduced him to the camp‚Äôs hierarchy.

‚ÄúName?‚Äù Dionysus drawled, clearly uninterested.

Kro straightened up, radiating the confidence only a Stark could muster. ‚ÄúMy name is Kronos Hephaestus Stark.‚Äù

The camp went silent.

Dionysus choked on his Diet Coke, his face a mix of shock and disbelief. ‚ÄúYou named your kid what?‚Äù

Tony, standing a few feet behind his son, held up his hands defensively. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know gods were real!‚Äù

Chiron coughed into his hand to hide a laugh. ‚ÄúWell, Kronos, welcome to Camp Half-Blood. I imagine you‚Äôll be staying in the Apollo cabin.‚Äù

Kro‚Äôs eyes lit up, practically glowing. ‚ÄúDoes that mean I can shoot lasers or something? Dad, can I shoot lasers?‚Äù

Tony groaned. ‚ÄúKid, let‚Äôs just get through orientation first, okay?‚Äù


---

As the days passed, Kro quickly became the talk of the camp. Not only was he the son of Apollo, but his mortal parent was Iron Man‚Äîa fact he made sure everyone knew within hours of arriving.

It didn‚Äôt take long for Kro to start showing off his abilities. From conjuring small orbs of sunlight to playing a flawless guitar solo he‚Äôd never learned, he was a natural at everything Apollo‚Äôs children were known for.

But his name continued to be a source of endless teasing.

‚ÄúYou really named him Kronos?‚Äù Clarisse muttered one afternoon, watching as the boy tried (and failed) to control a flaming arrow.

Tony, sitting nearby with a cup of coffee, sighed. ‚ÄúYes, I get it. I screwed up. Can we please move on?‚Äù


---

Despite the initial hiccups, Kro thrived at Camp Half-Blood. He quickly became a favorite among the campers, not just for his sunny disposition but for his ability to fix almost anything‚Äîa skill that seemed to come from his middle name.

One afternoon, as he was helping repair a chariot, Apollo appeared once again, this time to check on his son‚Äôs progress.

‚ÄúI gotta admit,‚Äù Apollo said, watching as Kro tinkered with the wheel, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs got your knack for engineering.‚Äù

Tony smirked. ‚ÄúYeah, well, he‚Äôs my kid too. Not just some prophecy machine you dropped on my doorstep.‚Äù

Apollo raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúFair enough. But for the record, I still think the name was a terrible choice.‚Äù

‚ÄúNoted,‚Äù Tony replied, rolling his eyes.


---

Over time, Kro‚Äôs unusual name became less of a joke and more of a badge of honor. He might have been named after a Titan and a god of fire, but he was carving out his own identity‚Äîone that blended the best of both his parents.

By the time his first summer at camp ended, Kro was a hero in his own right, proving that sometimes, even the most chaotic beginnings can lead to something extraordinary.

As he stood at the gates of Camp Half-Blood, ready to head back to Stark Tower with his dad, Kro turned to Apollo, who had come to see him off.

‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù Kro said, grinning. ‚ÄúFor everything.‚Äù

Apollo ruffled his son‚Äôs hair, his golden aura softening. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna do great things, kid. Just... maybe don‚Äôt name your kid Kronos.‚Äù

Kro laughed, and Tony smirked, shaking his head.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Tony said, wrapping an arm around his son. ‚ÄúOne Stark disaster is enough for now.‚Äù",3,1735945985.0,PercyJacksonfanfic,1,0.81,False
1hszzkt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hszzkt/i_won_the_lottery_but_my_life_was_a_lie/,"I Won the Lottery, but My Life Was a Lie","It all started with a man in a suit.

I was at a gas station, counting the crumpled bills in my wallet, when a man tapped me on the shoulder. He looked completely out of place‚Äîclean-cut, polished, and far too refined for the dingy convenience store.

‚ÄúTake this,‚Äù he said, holding out a lottery ticket.

I frowned. ‚ÄúWhy? What‚Äôs the catch?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo catch,‚Äù he replied, smiling in a way that felt too perfect, too calculated. ‚ÄúThink of it as a gift.‚Äù

I hesitated for a moment but eventually took the ticket. ‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I said, though the word felt strange in my mouth.

He nodded, almost approvingly, and walked out the door without another word.

The next day, I checked the numbers. My hands shook as they lit up, one by one. It wasn‚Äôt a small win. It was the jackpot‚Äî$20 million.

My life changed overnight.

I quit my job, moved into a beautiful house in the suburbs, and started living a life I‚Äôd only dreamed of. For the first time, everything felt like it was falling into place.

But the cracks started to show almost immediately.

At the bank, the teller greeted me by name before I even introduced myself. The salesman at the car dealership seemed to know exactly what I wanted, down to the color of the interior. Even my barista at the local coffee shop slid me a free drink with a knowing smile.

‚ÄúLucky guy,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThings always go your way, don‚Äôt they?‚Äù

At first, it felt nice. Who wouldn‚Äôt enjoy a little extra luck? But the more it happened, the more uneasy I became.

One morning, I realized that every traffic light turned green as I approached. Not just once, but every single time I drove anywhere.

Then, there were the people. Conversations felt rehearsed, like everyone knew exactly what I was going to say. Once, I overheard two men in the park talking about me.

‚ÄúDid you see his new car?‚Äù one of them asked.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù the other replied. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs perfect for his character arc.‚Äù

I stopped in my tracks. Who talks like that?

Emily came into my life not long after.

We met at the grocery store, where our carts collided. She was gorgeous, charming, and everything I‚Äôd ever dreamed of in a partner. By the end of the week, we were practically inseparable.

It was all too perfect. Too easy.

One night, as we sat on the couch watching TV, she turned to me and said, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait to see how it ends.‚Äù

I froze. ‚ÄúWhat ends?‚Äù

Her eyes widened for a moment before she laughed nervously. ‚ÄúOh, nothing. I was talking about the show.‚Äù

I wanted to believe her, but something about her answer stuck with me.

It got worse after that.

One day, I was running errands when I noticed a black van following me. No matter where I went, it stayed close behind. I tried losing it by taking random turns, but it didn‚Äôt work.

Panicked, I turned onto a back road and ended up in front of a massive warehouse. The black van pulled into the lot and disappeared inside.

Something about the place felt wrong. Against my better judgment, I parked my car a block away and crept toward the building. Through a grimy window, I saw rows of monitors, each one showing live feeds of places I recognized: my house, my car, the park, even my bedroom.

Pinned to a corkboard in the center of the room was a stack of papers labeled ‚ÄúPROJECT WINNER.‚Äù Beneath it were detailed scripts describing events from my life‚Äîwinning the lottery, meeting Emily, even smaller moments like ordering coffee.

At the bottom, in bold red letters, were the words: ‚ÄúSEASON FINALE IN TWO WEEKS.‚Äù

I confronted Emily when I got home.

‚ÄúWhat the hell is this?‚Äù I demanded, slamming the script onto the table.

She stared at the papers, her face pale. ‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt supposed to find that,‚Äù she said quietly.

‚ÄúIs any of this real? Are you real?‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt answer. Instead, she grabbed her phone and walked into the other room. That night, she packed her things and left without saying a word.

The next morning, I found a new script on my bedside table.

It was titled: ‚ÄúSam‚Äôs Final Scene.‚Äù

My stomach turned as I flipped through it. It described everything that had happened to me in perfect detail‚Äîthe man at the gas station, the lottery win, the warehouse. But it didn‚Äôt stop there. It outlined my next steps: run outside, confront the black van, and be taken away.

Before I could process what I was reading, I heard the rumble of an engine outside.

The van was waiting for me.

I stepped outside, script in hand, and walked toward the van. The back doors opened, revealing a brightly lit interior filled with monitors and cameras.

On every screen was me‚Äîeating breakfast, walking my dog, staring blankly out the window. My entire life, playing out like episodes of a show.

At the far end of the van, a man in a director‚Äôs chair turned to face me.

He smiled. ‚ÄúWelcome, Sam. You‚Äôve done well. The audience loves you.‚Äù

I stumbled back. ‚ÄúAudience? What audience?‚Äù

He gestured toward a monitor, and the screen changed to show a massive auditorium filled with people. They were cheering, clapping, some even crying as scenes from my life played out on the big screen.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been part of something special,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe Project Winner series has been our most successful show to date. But all good things must come to an end.‚Äù

I shook my head, the truth crashing down around me. ‚ÄúMy life‚Äîit‚Äôs not real? None of it?‚Äù

The director shrugged. ‚ÄúDoes it matter? The audience believed it. That‚Äôs what counts.‚Äù

I tried to run, but the van doors slammed shut behind me. The lights flared, and everything faded to black.

When I woke up, I was sitting in my living room. Everything looked normal‚Äîmy furniture, my pictures, even the coffee cup on the table.

But I knew it wasn‚Äôt real.

The cameras were still there, hidden in the corners, their lenses trained on me. My life is a script, and I‚Äôm still playing my role. Somewhere out there, they‚Äôre watching, waiting for me to entertain them.

I don‚Äôt know how this ends. But I know one thing: it‚Äôs not my story anymore.",3,1735945959.0,nosleep,0,0.72,False
1hszyrq,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/1hszyrq/ilola_tea_company_claims_to_have_invented/,"""Ilola"" tea company claims to have invented compressed tea","I was looking up ""tea humidor"" online since I heard someone talking about a humidor, I had never heard of it. I came across this website and thought in my head ""perfect!"" Little did I know, I was gonna see another white wellness company appropiating an ancient culutral practice.

The act of compressing tea into cakes goes back centuries in china, it is a cultural staple and is incredibly delicous. Tea has been compressed in many different shapes and sizes. I have seen tuo cha cakes that would make just enough for one gaiwan or pot (around five grams). Their claim that they invented small compressed tea cakes is laughable and disgusting. Im sure there are tuo cha cakes you can by right now aged longer than the existence of this company. 

Other ridiculous thing, the only reason they exist is because people cannot measure loose leaf tea? Good loose leaf is so damn cheap, and you can just boil it and drink it grandpa style. What is complicated about throwing leaves into a cup and boiling water, it cant be harder than making coffee! 

These cakes are about five grams, they sell packs of twelve for eighteen dollars. So a serving of tea (one gaiwan, large cup or small pot) costs about 2 dollars. I looked on yunnan sourcing. Only the highest quality aged teas commanded more of a price per steeping. A kg of oolong could be found for 60$ the same price you would pay for 150-200 grams of some shitty herbal tea cake. They have oolong which is rolled and then pressed into a cake, which confounds me, but even that is cheap junk. And even if you want cheap stuff, you can go to any asian grocery and get delicous cheap oolong for cheaper then they command, and god knows you can boil the crap out of it. 

If able bodied people dont have the patience to chuck leaves in hot water, they dont deserve tea. Innovation shouldnt destroy culture, and act like they invented it at the same time. 
Im not even being pretentious, you should look at what they are saying about their tea, its a bunch of wellness nonsense. I can enjoy cheap tea happily, but this is some seriously expensive garbage.

Long story short, we opened up a small coffee shop (30 seats) in our town. We originally planned on opening 6 months ago but health, mother nature, and bad contractors, had other plans. Now we've tapped in to most of our cushion money and are panicking and need to bring in revenue as soon as possible. 

We have only been open a month and are only doing between $2,000 and $3,000 a week currently, and offering limited breakfast items (breakfast sandwich, parfait, danishes, etc) plus an assortment of coffee, espresso, and tea. The problem is, because we hired people when we originally planned to open, we can no longer sustain the excess labor and, since we pay well above minimum wage (which is what most other coffee shops pay) we are averaging around 110% a day in labor.

I want to avoid letting anyone go if we can help it. What marketing ideas, collaborations, events, or anything, do you guys recommended to start spreading the word about our business. 

Thank you in advance!",1,1735945898.0,barista,2,1.0,False

Notice the birds chirping in the morning.  
Notice the sunrise.  
Notice the aroma of your morning coffee.  
Notice the always helping colleague.  
Notice the warmth of your dinner.  
Notice the details while someone is speaking to you.  
Notice the quiet coming of the night.

After you notice every small and big thing around you, start being grateful.

Gratefulness is a *choice*, not a *task*.

Now start sharing it with other people‚Äîyour family, friends, colleagues, or even strangers. It doesn't matter how you do it, as long as you spread it. Be the shining light for other people. If you don't, you're going to become another part of the darkness plaguing the world.

You don't know who is going trough a rough time. We have all gone trought a tough time aswell in our life. Most certainly there's been someone who helped. If so, why don't you become that person to someone.

What I'm trying to say is... start noticing. Being grateful is the art of noticing. Only when you internally recognize it and share it does it become something? So why don't you try? It doesn't cost you anything.

Being grateful is *free* and being a good person is *priceless*.",6,1735945800.0,gratitude,1,1.0,False

Really need help‚Ä¶ 18 F likely to be estranged after academic year and have 4 days before I need to finalise my decision,"4 days to go‚Ä¶ I should have done this sooner as I need to tell my parents my final decision at a joint therapy session my psychologist organised this coming Tuesday‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been given the ultimatum that either I completely conform to their conservative and strict beliefs and pursue the rest of my life on their conditions only, or I‚Äôm getting kicked out and no contact after the end of this school year. 
To give some context, I‚Äôm in my final year of the IBDP (like A-Levels but for masochists ig) and have always had a difficult relationship with my parents. Absent cheating father who‚Äôs only perceivable emotion is anger and has a hobby of breaking stuff and on rare occasions gives out a blood filled mouth and a black eye bc he‚Äôs ‚Äúthe man of the house‚Äù and emotionally volatile mother with a victim complex who at some times I can almost talk to as a friend as she had me younger than she should have, but has never really been a mother to me understandably because of resent (her in laws gave her hell bc I was born a girl and ruined their bloodline of only men for 7 generations but that‚Äôs another story). 
Their culture is very different to mine, as I was born in the UK and currently go to an international school in France. They come from a super religious background that I just don‚Äôt fit with as I have a different interpretation, and have pretty sexist prudish beliefs. So needless to say, they lost their shit when I got caught talking to a guy‚Ä¶. The same guy‚Ä¶ Thrice. 
Was it incredibly careless for me to do so again and again? Obviously, but I‚Äôve always seen myself having a love marriage eventually and can‚Äôt stand the idea of having to spend the rest of my life with someone I don‚Äôt yet know or trust, especially seeing how horribly my parents arranged marriage went. And before anyone asks, they‚Äôre from a culture that looks down on divorced women and considers them run through and incapable of making the man stay, especially after children which she was pressured to have instantly our of fear of being labelled infertile ‚Äî so no, she will not divorce him. As much as I pity and empathise with her, she unfortunately defends and supports these ideologies and tries to make me conform to them, which I am unwilling to do. 

Anyways, most recent time I got caught with the guy was in November, and despite genuinely wanting a future with him, they think flirting with a white boy means I‚Äôm going to be a prostitute and bring shame to the family. Their reasoning: ‚ÄúWhite people are in one persons bed one night, then another tomorrow. Being with one you‚Äôll just become exactly the same and I won‚Äôt be able to live anymore if someone asks me why my daughter‚Äôs body is on a nude magazine‚Äù (don‚Äôt ask). 
This was the last straw for them and myself, and they were like ‚Äúwhy should we pay for the university of someone who just wants to betray us? If you‚Äôre that ‚Äòdesperate‚Äô we can get you married, not everyone needs to go into education and career‚Äù. Keep in mind I‚Äôve always been really passionate about my education since school was my safe space as a child, and they know how much I want to pursue a career. When I asked what if I can somehow pay for my own higher education and pursue my life as I want, their answer was that I would be forever estranged and dead to the family. 
Issue is I‚Äôm the oldest sister to 12 F and 6 F who both see me as their parental figure as I basically raised them more than their parents did, and I also almost have a maternal instinct to take care of them which is why it feels so wrong to think of leaving them behind. My father has been hitting people less and objects more, and my mother has started therapy so I know they‚Äôll at least have a marginally better upbringing than I did, but marginally better isn‚Äôt as good as what they deserve and I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm being selfish for wanting to escape. 

Since November I‚Äôve been preparing for this, researching into all of the support I can rely on and the options that I have. Thankfully I have some pretty incredible friends in my life, one whose parents tried to take me in at 16 when the police got involved because they were scared of what would happen to me in the care system and are potentially able to give me their home for a year so I can save up before going to uni, one other whose parents have also offered me their home, and one who has lots of professional connections and experience and is helping me with getting online qualifications and a job. 

The plan: take a deferred year and save up some money working freelance web development while living with my friends. Then (hopefully) go to Bristol University where I know there is a lot of support for estranged students and those with health conditions and disabilities (endometriosis, extreme weakness and low weight, being prone to collapse, essential tremors, and also adhd and cptsd for contexts sake), and I already have a Student Finance account set up with my national insurance number as I still classify as a resident and will pay home fees bc EU agreement. I should be eligible for the tuition fee loan (¬£9250) and the maintenance fee loans (¬£10227) yearly, which will hopefully cover the important things like my uni and rent, and I‚Äôll continue working freelance web dev as a side job while at uni so hopefully money from that will help me be able to afford a somewhat decent lifestyle. The course I‚Äôm applying to is Bsc International Business Management and I‚Äôm hoping to do a law conversion course after that and pursue Corporate/IP Law. I have the grades, I have the drive, I just don‚Äôt know if my plan would work out or not. I don‚Äôt have any alternative to this other than handing to reins of my life to my parents and going where and doing what and being with whom they want me to. And tbh I‚Äôm so exhausted of not being able to be myself and feel secure in my own house, and it‚Äôs only making my physical health and weight loss so much worse because of my mental health. Idk if I‚Äôm doing this correctly or if maybe I‚Äôm just being unreasonable and should just suck it up instead of running away. All I know is that if I ever have children (which I do kinda want, even though it‚Äôs hard with endo), I would never forgive myself if I couldn‚Äôt raise them away from this cycle of generational trauma. 


(this has not much relevance but I find it so ironic that while writing this my father has ‚Äúgracefully‚Äù thrown the coffee table across the living room downstairs breaking it, and shattered a bunch of glass decorations and my sisters lego set because  there were 3 lego pieces that were on the carpet and that pissed him off :D I think he‚Äôs trying to help me with my answer, but god I hope losing one daughter teaches them to do better with their others‚Ä¶ Or I swear the moment I can afford it I‚Äôm fighting for custody.) 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

tldr; always had a crappy relationship with my parents, my education and future is now at risk, but I have child sisters I‚Äôm afraid to leave behind. I have a possible plan but am scared I haven‚Äôt considered something important, and they gave me the deadline of the 7th January to announce to them if I‚Äôll go my own way after this academic year ends or if I‚Äôll make it up to them, fix my beliefs to suit theirs and stay. I‚Äôm 98% sure leaving would be best for me but that 2% is terrified I‚Äôm doing something wrong.

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it‚Äôs you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength‚ÄîI wish I‚Äôd had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There‚Äôs so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it‚Äôs not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian‚Äîyour mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she‚Äôs gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I‚Äôve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I‚Äôm certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup‚Äôs rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn‚Äôt know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you‚Äôll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I‚Äôm deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea‚Äôs trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, ‚ÄúW-what does this mean?‚Äù

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. ‚ÄúNot here, not now. Let‚Äôs get home, then we can talk.‚Äù

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother‚Äôs shrill voice called after them, ‚ÄúLeaving already? You haven‚Äôt stayed for lunch.‚Äù

Sorin‚Äôs jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.‚Äù With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. ‚ÄúDamn it, damn it, damn it.‚Äù

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea‚Äôs gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

‚ÄúD-do you‚Ä¶ think this could really be true?‚Äù Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. ‚ÄúLook, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might‚Äôve signed, we‚Äôll have proof.‚Äù He paused, deep in thought. ‚ÄúDad must have something lying around.‚Äù A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. ‚ÄúWhy did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could‚Äôve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!‚Äù

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. ‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt really know what was going on back then‚Ä¶‚Äù

A sob erupted from him. ‚ÄúI loved him so much, Drea. I don‚Äôt remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end‚Ä¶‚Äù

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another‚Äôs embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, ‚ÄúCall Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.‚Äù

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn‚Äôt rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it! That woman is going to pay today. I‚Äôve tolerated her long enough!‚Äù He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

‚ÄúAdrian, no!‚Äù

---------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to styling your home, the right furniture can make all the difference. Black metal furniture pieces are trendy choices that not only add elegance but also enhance the overall vibe of your decor. So, which black metal furniture pieces fit best with your decor? Here‚Äôs how to choose the perfect ones for your home.

### Understanding Your Style

The first step in incorporating black metal furniture is understanding your personal style. Are you leaning towards modern, industrial, minimalistic, or perhaps a more rustic vibe? Here are a few styles common in home decor:

- **Modern:** Clean lines and a sleek finish define this style.
- **Industrial:** Raw edges and an unfinished look add character.
- **Minimalistic:** Simple and functional without extra decoration.
- **Rustic:** Incorporates natural elements with a cozy feel.

### Key Pieces to Consider

Once you have a grasp of your style, consider specific black metal furniture pieces. Each of them has distinct attributes that can complement your decor:

#### 1. Black Metal Coffee Tables

A black metal coffee table can quickly become the centerpiece of your living room. Look for one with interesting shapes or textures to elevate your space. For instance, a round table can soften angular furniture, while a rectangular one can fit snugly in a large room.

#### 2. Black Metal Dining Chairs

Pairing black metal dining chairs with a wooden table creates a fantastic contrast. You might opt for chairs with fabric cushions for added comfort or choose sleek, minimalist designs for a more modern look. Either way, they can add an elegant touch to your dining area.

Check the Details Here -&gt; ;) https://amzn.to/3Bwu5mR  
  
#### 3. Black Metal Shelving Units

These shelving units not only offer functionality but also bring a stylish flair to any room. They can be used in living rooms, kitchens, or offices to display books, plants, or decorative items. Choose a design that fits your overall decor theme. Industrial styles may incorporate wood and metal, while modern designs focus on glass and sharp lines.

#### 4. Black Metal Bed Frames

A black metal bed frame can define your bedroom‚Äôs aesthetic. Whether you choose a simple design or something more intricate, it can create a stunning focal point. Incorporate bright bedding or colorful accents to soften the look and balance the dark tones of the metal.

#### 5. Black Metal Accent Tables

Accent tables are versatile and can fit into almost any nook or cranny in your home. Whether you need a side table for your couch or a small table for your entryway, black metal options blend seamlessly into any decor style.

### Combining with Other Materials

To make sure your black metal furniture fits well with your decor, think about how you can combine it with other materials:

Check the Details Here -&gt; ;) https://amzn.to/3Bwu5mR  
  
- **Wood:** Adds warmth and texture, balancing the coolness of metal.
- **Glass:** Provides a sleek appearance while allowing light to pass through, making spaces feel larger.
- **Fabric:** Softer textures can break up the rigidity of metal, creating a more inviting atmosphere.

### Colors and Textures

When integrating black metal furniture, consider the colors and textures in your space. Black pairs well with almost any color, but you can also play with various textures to create a dynamic environment. Pair black metal with:

- Bright colors for a bold contrast.
- Neutral tones for a subtle, sophisticated vibe.
- Earthy tones for a grounded, organic feel.

### Final Touches

After selecting your black metal furniture, add accessories that enhance the overall look. Decorative pillows, area rugs, and artwork can help tie together the elements of your decor. Don‚Äôt overload your space; instead, focus on balance and harmony.

In essence, integrating black metal furniture into your decor not only allows you to express your personal style but also creates an inviting and stylish environment. Choose pieces that resonate with your theme and combine them thoughtfully with various materials and textures. Enjoy the transformation of your space!

Mixing Black Metal Furniture with Other Design Styles: Tips and Tricks
----------------------------------------------------------------------

When incorporating black metal furniture into your home, you can achieve a striking and stylish look. However, knowing how to mix these bold pieces with various design styles can be a bit tricky. Here are some useful tips and tricks to guide you in blending black metal furniture seamlessly into your decor.

### Embrace Contrast

One of the most effective strategies when mixing black metal furniture with other styles is to embrace contrast. Black metal pieces offer a stark look that can enhance the appeal of softer materials. Consider pairing a black metal coffee table with a plush, light-colored sofa. This combination brings balance, allowing each element to shine.

Check the Details Here -&gt; ;) https://amzn.to/3Bwu5mR  
  
### Don‚Äôt Overdo It

While black metal furniture can be captivating, using too many heavy pieces can overwhelm your space. To avoid this, choose one or two statement pieces and allow the rest of your decor to create a light atmosphere. For instance, a black metal dining table can serve as the focal point, while you opt for lighter or colorful chairs to maintain visual interest.

### Mix Textures

Combining different textures is a great way to create depth in your design. Black metal contrasts beautifully with wood, fabric, or even glass. Here are some examples:

- **Wood:** A black metal bed frame alongside rustic wooden nightstands creates an appealing mix of modern and traditional elements.
- **Fabric:** Pairing black metal dining chairs with upholstered seats can soften the look. This combination encourages comfort while still maintaining a chic style.
- **Glass:** Use black metal shelving against a backdrop of glass elements to create an airier feel. This mix allows for light to flow through the space, keeping it from feeling heavy.

### Utilize Color Accents

Color accents can bring life to your black metal furniture. Using colorful cushions, throws, or artwork can create a thoughtful dialogue in your design. For example, if you have a black metal bed frame, dress it with vibrant pillows and a colorful throw for a cozy, inviting look.

### Consider Scale and Proportion

When mixing black metal furniture with other pieces, it‚Äôs essential to think about scale and proportion. A large black metal dining table can dominate a smaller dining room. Counter this by incorporating lighter or smaller-sized items that ensure everything feels balanced. Here‚Äôs what to consider:

Check the Details Here -&gt; ;) https://amzn.to/3Bwu5mR  
  
- Use large black metal pieces in spacious areas where they won‚Äôt overwhelm.
- In more compact spaces, opt for smaller black metal furniture to maintain a pleasant flow.

### Focus on Your Style

Your personal style should always be at the forefront when mixing black metal with other designs. Whether you lean towards modern, industrial, or even boho styles, determine how black metal fits into your vision. For instance, in a modern space, perhaps you choose sleek lines and minimal decor, while an industrial aesthetic allows for more rugged combinations with raw materials.

### Accessorize Wisely

Accessories play a vital role in tying together your decor. Black metal furniture can serve as an excellent backdrop for vibrant decor pieces. Think of elements like:

- **Artwork:** Bold art pieces can create a dramatic contrast against black metal.
- **Plants:** Incorporate greenery with planters that are made from wood or ceramic to break up the boldness of metal.
- **Lighting:** Lighting fixtures in soft tones can add warmth and balance out the coolness of black metal.

Remember, the key to mixing black metal furniture with other design styles is to create harmony. By focusing on contrast, texture, and the right proportions, you can make stunning combinations that highlight your unique taste. Allow your personal style to shine through and experiment with different accessories to create a space that feels balanced and inviting.

### Conclusion

Finding the right black metal furniture pieces for your home decor can transform your space into a stylish and cohesive environment. Consider the unique attributes of black metal, such as its durability and versatility, as you decide which pieces align best with your personal style. It's important to think about how these elements interact with your existing decor. Whether you're opting for sleek tables, bold shelving units, or eye-catching accent chairs, focus on what complements your vision and needs.

Mixing black metal furniture with other design styles can yield stunning results, creating a well-rounded aesthetic. Whether you lean towards industrial, modern, or even bohemian designs, black metal acts as a neutral backdrop that can harmonize with various materials and colors. wooden accents, soft textiles, or lively artwork can enhance the overall ambiance and make your space feel inviting.

After a few years I noticed that I was falling into a routine of 4-5 spots and I wasn't trying as many new places as I wanted. So for 2024 I decided to try one new ""restaurant"" each week no matter what. To fit my life a bit better I did count coffee shops. I definitely found myself running out on a Sunday night multiple times or grabbing something cheap to keep to my budget. I kept track of every new place I went, even if there were more in one week.   
  
This ended up being one of my favorite things I've done since moving here and I've been able to eat at a ton of new fantastic places. Here is my list of where I have been, you can probably tell I already took a lot of ideas from this sub. I would love to hear some ideas for places that I should add to my list and try out! 

For Context: I live in Lincoln Park but I have a car and am fine with driving for a meal, I work in Franklin Park. For the most part I go out as a solo diner, but I do one dinner a month with my sisters, and about one date a month with my SO. I also do a burger list with about 100 places so I'm always looking for burgers. 

I am planning on doing this again next year... but I think only one new place every 2-weeks.

I chose CR as my kids first international trip and have been planning for months. Below is information I wish I‚Äôd known. Enjoy! 



General Tips



1. Transportation

 ‚Ä¢ Taxis are the only legal transportation in Costa Rica but are significantly more expensive than Uber. In La Fortuna, Uber is available, but in Monteverde, you‚Äôll need other options. With either, you can negotiate for multiple stops. Offer the driver some cash to turn off the app and wait for you between stops. I have contacts at the bottom.

 ‚Ä¢ Booking transportation through an agency was a lifesaver as a single dad. The long drives (e.g., 4 hours for 85 miles) can be mentally exhausting, and the cost isn‚Äôt likely much more than renting a car with insurance.



2. Packing Essentials

 ‚Ä¢ Costa Rica has two seasons: rainy and really rainy. Pack waterproof shoes and comfortable walking shoes. Wet feet can ruin your day.

 ‚Ä¢ Also pack a waterproof sling bag and lightweight, packable rain jackets.

 ‚Ä¢ Always carry a power brick and charging cords in your sling. You don‚Äôt want to lose access to maps, Uber, or translation tools.



3. Currency

 ‚Ä¢ The exchange rate is simple: 1,000 Colones ‚âà $2. No need for a converter. 5,000 colones is $10.  Example: 10,000 is $20. 



4. Communication

 ‚Ä¢ Check with your phone provider, but with T-Mobile, you can text for free. If you want to call for free, you can buy a Travel Pass for $30. This will give you 5 gigs

 ‚Ä¢ Everyone uses WhatsApp in Costa Rica. Download it before your trip and get the contact info of reliable drivers or guides.



5. Food

 ‚Ä¢ Eat at sodas, family-owned restaurants, for authentic and affordable meals. Learning a bit of Spanish helps, but most menus are straightforward.

 ‚Ä¢ Arroz = Rice, Frijoles = Beans, Pollo = Chicken. Most local dishes are a combination of the first two.

 ‚Ä¢ Tip: Tacos and burritos in Costa Rica differ from Mexican ones. For something closer to home, try the Tacos Mexicanos at Taco y Taco in Monteverde. Picky eaters? Go for the chicken fingers‚Äîthey‚Äôre consistently good.



6. Pura Vida Spirit

 ‚Ä¢ Costa Ricans are some of the kindest people you‚Äôll meet. Tips aren‚Äôt expected, but they deeply appreciate them. When tipping, they may even ask, ‚ÄúIs this too much?‚Äù



San Jos√©

 ‚Ä¢ San Jos√© is chaotic, with heavy traffic and little appeal. Skip staying there overnight; head straight to your first destination after landing. If I had to do it again, I would not have flown into SJO.



La Fortuna



1. La Fortuna Waterfall

 ‚Ä¢ Stunning but a workout! There are 550 steps down and 550 back up. My boys (15 and 17) handled it in 15 minutes down and 30 minutes back. I attempted it faster and regretted it!

 ‚Ä¢ Swimming in the waterfall pool is exhilarating but challenging. The current is strong, and you‚Äôll be swept back if you venture too close.



2. Bogarin Trail

 ‚Ä¢ A wildlife gem. The owner, Geovani, built this 60-acre trail in 2000. It‚Äôs a top spot for sloths (40+ on-site), poison dart frogs, toucans, and other birds. We saw four sloths and highly recommend it.



3. Baldi Hot Springs

 ‚Ä¢ Relax in pools of varying temperatures with swim-up bars and loungers. Don‚Äôt miss the waterslide‚Äîit‚Äôs said to be the second fastest in the world, and spectators cheer on brave sliders!



4. Chocolate & Coffee Tours

 ‚Ä¢ Educational and fun for older kids. For coffee enthusiasts, consider waiting until Monteverde, where they grow Arabica beans (the type we drink). In La Fortuna, you‚Äôll see coffee plants, but they aren‚Äôt the same variety.



5. Arenal Volcano

 ‚Ä¢ Great for spotting monkeys and hiking. If you can see the volcano (it‚Äôs often shrouded in clouds), stop and take a picture‚Äîyou may not get another chance.



Monteverde Tips



1. Different Climate

 ‚Ä¢ Monteverde‚Äôs higher elevation makes it cooler. Pack a long-sleeve shirt or hoodie for evenings.



2. Taco y Taco

 ‚Ä¢ The best meal of our trip! Their Tacos Mexicanos are fresh, delicious, and reminiscent of home, with vibrant fruits and veggies.



3. Stay Close to Town

 ‚Ä¢ We stayed at an Airbnb outside of town, which was cool because of the wildlife (monkeys!), but getting into town was a hassle without addresses. Next time, I‚Äôd stay in or near the town center for walkability.



4. Activities

 ‚Ä¢ Skip Kinkajou Night Tours. They showed us only four animals (likely pre-planned), and one was barely visible. Poison dart frogs, for example, aren‚Äôt found at this elevation. If you want a night tour, do it in La Fortuna.

 ‚Ä¢ My boys loved ziplining with Treetop. Guides told us it‚Äôs the best in Monteverde. Meanwhile, I did the hanging bridges with my daughter‚Äîboth are incredible experiences.

 ‚Ä¢ The Finca Ecological Reserve in San Luis is unparalleled. A 30-minute drive from Monteverde on rough roads, this 70-acre reserve has been family-owned for generations. It‚Äôs a birder‚Äôs paradise with toucans, hawks, and barbets. The best way to visit is with Prof. Dulce, a local guide who‚Äôll take you for breakfast, then to the cloud forest for lunch. Her knowledge and passion make the experience unforgettable.



Tamarindo



Tamarindo is completely different than the other two and, honestly, the perfect end to an action-packed trip. No rain. Hot! Much more Americanized food. Very cool bars and restaurants.



1. Activities

 ‚Ä¢ Surf instructors are everywhere. We were offered $70 for a lesson with my boys, and if they didn‚Äôt stand, it was free.

 ‚Ä¢ There is a casino. It‚Äôs nothing fancy, but there are tables and slots.

 ‚Ä¢ Lots of nice clothing stores, spas, and boutiques.

 ‚Ä¢ Beware of drug dealers! The guys selling whistles are also selling weed and blow. I was offered three times on the first day.

 ‚Ä¢ I booked a sunset cruise through the Tamarindo Diria Resort. It was great, though the ‚Äúsnorkeling‚Äù wasn‚Äôt much as they told us beforehand there was nothing to see in that area.

 ‚Ä¢ Most other activities I inquired about were at least 40 miles away, which, in Costa Rica travel time, is like 2 hours.



Contacts

 1. Christine (Costa Rica Inspirations)

 ‚Ä¢ Expert planner who handled all our transportation and tours.

I walked away for a while to get a coffee as I drifted from the star system and returned right before the supernova occurred.  I placed my headphones back on, and heard each explorer playing their song.  Then, one by one it was quiet.

1hszn4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1hszn4j/re_adrift_pt_2/,Re: Adrift [Pt. 2],"Jacob tentatively approached the fizzling datapad and slowly picked it up off the ground, trying to turn the machine back on. Of course, it didn‚Äôt work. The internals were most likely fried, and he was very happy that they hadn‚Äôt used lithium batteries, or it would have blown up. But still, it was junk now. 

‚ÄúHm. That‚Äôs seriously suspicious.‚Äù 

He turned the broken datapad over in his hands, inspecting it. No external machines, no receivers. Which had to mean that whatever he had tried to open, had the kill switch embedded in the code. Not that he knew how to bypass that. He was an engineer, not a coding expert. Furrowing his brow, he sat down and began to think, really think. The only other person with him was Evelyn, and as far as he knew, she didn‚Äôt have anything to hide. On the other hand, seven thousand years was a long time by yourself, and maybe she just went crazy. Then again‚Ä¶ if she had gone crazy, why leave him alive? Why bypass the lock to let him in here at all? Why help him so much if it was going to let him onto her scent and possibly become an obstacle? Wouldn‚Äôt it just be easier to kill him, and run the ship entirely with her clones? It didn‚Äôt add up. 

Sighing, he picked up the datapad and stuffed it into his tool belt. If he can get it working again, maybe he can get some answers. Of course that was harder said than done, datapads were not something he was familiar with, and from what he did know they were very, very compact. And he had fat fingers. 

Opening the airlock back into the hallway, he shook his head and looked up at the ceiling- behind him, the drone that had detached and followed behind disappeared into another crevice in the wall. Of course, Jacob just continued on, having not seen what happened just a few feet behind him. 

With a hiss and a clunk, the door sealed behind him as Jacob cautiously spoke out, looking to the wall and thinking of his next move. 

‚ÄúHey, Evelyn, anything on where we are?‚Äù

The answer wasn‚Äôt immediate like before, but it was swift. 

**‚ÄúCurrently no. I‚Äôm trying to chart these stars and they just aren‚Äôt lining up with our galaxy maps of the Milky Way. Though I did find some information on our immediate surroundings.‚Äù**

Jacob tapped the wall and started following the guide bands back to the mess hall. After all that, he needed a drink. Something with a kick. 

‚ÄúAnd that would be?‚Äù

He asked, running his hands over the tools in his tool belt. He still didn‚Äôt know if he should trust Evelyn after what happened in the server room, but he was going to give her the benefit of the doubt. He didn‚Äôt really have a reason to be suspicious of her, and letting him into the server room in the first place wouldn‚Äôt have really been a good move if she really had nefarious intentions. 


**‚ÄúWe're hardly using any of our fuel, since we‚Äôre orbiting a red giant. So that‚Äôs one thing. The star system has six planets, three being gas giants. One almost had enough mass to become a second star, but failed. It‚Äôs one of the few Brown Dwarves we have documented. The other three are barren, with no magnetosphere and no tectonic activity.‚Äù**

Jacob turned a corner and paused, looking into the mess hall. There were several drones, all security, floating around the tables. 

‚ÄúEvelyn, what‚Äôs up with the drones?‚Äù

He asked, looking warily around the mess hall. The drones all turned, their camera flashing red and blue for a moment before they vacated the room. 

**‚ÄúRoutine patrols. For some reason every single programmer put the mess hall on these things's routes, so they all end up here at the same time sometimes.‚Äù** 


Jacob raised an eyebrow before slowly walking over to one of the food printers. Punching in his order, he listened to the mechanical whirrs of the machine Slowly, agonizingly slowly, the cup rose from the plate as the printer finished making his drink. With a woosh, the amber liquid filled the cup waiting below. 

**‚ÄúJacob, please tell me that‚Äôs coffee-‚Äù**

Evelyn said disapprovingly as Jacob grabbed the cup and took a sip. It burned delightfully as the fluid made its way down his throat. 

‚ÄúNope, but it does have caffeine.‚Äù

He gave one of the cameras- or what he thought was a camera- a wink as he took another drink. It was a concoction  he snuck  into the printer database while no one was looking, a real special concoction of Energy Drink and bourbon. No he didn‚Äôt have a drinking problem. 

**‚ÄúUh huh‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm just gonna take a look at what you- JACOB!‚Äù** 

Evelyn‚Äôs voice boomed from the speakers, shrieking as they reached their highest frequency, making him wince. 

**‚ÄúThat can‚Äôt possibly be good for you! I‚Äôm taking it away.‚Äù**

Jacob watched as a medical and security drone made their way towards him, the medical drone‚Äôs hanging arms splitting into several tendrils as one dipped into his cup and siphoned away the contents.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre no fun Evelyn. I‚Äôm the only crew member, not like I can hurt anybody‚Ä¶‚Äù

He sighed, but didn‚Äôt put up a fight. The medical drone floating away, one of the tubes hidden in its undercarriage barely visible- and full of his mystery drink. 

‚ÄúDamn‚Ä¶‚Äù

He shook his head, before punching in a new code into the food printer. This time, straight black coffee filled a new cup, steaming hot and bubbling still as he grumbled. Sitting down at the table, he shot the security drone a dirty look as it floated away.

**‚ÄúI saw that. Look, I know you can‚Äôt hurt anyone, but you‚Äôll hurt yourself. WE only have each other and i can‚Äôt have you chasing the bottom of a bottle.‚Äù** 

Evelyn‚Äôs voice seemed‚Ä¶sad. He looked down into his coffee cup and bit his lip. He had been so busy thinking about how she could have been hiding something, and stealing his drink he hadn‚Äôt stopped to think about what she might be feeling. Even though she was an artificial intelligence, she was still a person. She was probably just as worried, if not more so, about ending up alone. At least with him, his suffering would end eventually. She‚Ä¶ was practically immortal. 

‚ÄúSorry, Evelyn. I didn‚Äôt think about it. I‚Äôll drink in moderation only.‚Äù 

He sighed, giving the security drone a smile- before the lights abruptly shut off. Only the red glow of the Red Giant outside illuminated the mess hall as Jacob looked around. 

‚ÄúEvelyn?‚Äù

He asked, standing- and launching himself into the ceiling. With a heavy thunk, he collided with the metal and winced, rubbing his head. He felt a pretty large lump where it had struck the ceiling, and cautiously pressed the button on the side of his helmet. With a hiss, it sealed into place, his breath briefly fogging up the visor before his vision cleared again. 

‚ÄúFuck, no gravity. Which means no power. Evelyn must be in power save mode..‚Äù

Grunting, he pushed off the ceiling, heading into the hall. Carefully making sure he didn‚Äôt put too much force behind his legs and slam into the floor. He succeeded and gazed at the guide bands on the wall- all now slightly off hue. He carefully read each one before tapping the red band. Carefully, slowly, he pushed off in the direction of the band. He didn‚Äôt need to get lost, and although he did help design the ship, so had every other crewmember. So he knew less than he thought, and he knew that. He just needed to mitigate his own confidence in knowing the ship and he would be fine. 

Entering a hallway without light from the star they were orbiting, Jacob slowed himself. Red blinking lights floating ahead only told him that something was in his path. Most likely, drones that had no central intelligence to guide them, so they shut off in the middle of whatever they were doing. And hitting one of those while barreling down the hallway would suck, so he slowed himself and began to gently push the machines out of the way. Not that they could feel, he just didn‚Äôt feel like fixing them if they got damaged. Eventually, and it was eventually, he got through them all. A lot of them had clumped up, probably due to the weak gravitational pull between them- or maybe they just all happened to be near one another when the power went out. 

‚ÄúAlright engine room engine room‚Ä¶‚Äù

He looked to the wall as the light of the red giant poured back into the ship through the windows, searching for the red band- and found that both of the bands in this hallway were red. 

‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs not good.‚Äù

He tapped his chin, before shrugging and randomly choosing one- pushing down the hallway and quickly making a left as the band split in two. Truthfully, he was probably following the wrong band, but if he was he could just have to- he paused, grabbing onto one of the many latches in the walls and walls, meant for this very possibility. The ship was getting colder, he could see ice starting to form on the windows as the condensation within the ship cooled. He wasn't going to be able to double back like he had hoped if he was wrong. Pushing himself forward with a grunt, he shot forward, deftly avoiding another floating drone. Barreling down the halls now at full speed, he nervously watched as ice formed all over the ship, the glow of the star making the ice crystal shimmer iridescently as he shot past. He was sweating, the droplets condensing in his hair before the suit siphoned it away.

As metal and glass, and now ice, whizzed by, something grabbed his gut. It felt‚Ä¶wrong, like something was very wrong, but he couldn‚Äôt put his finger on it. He went to wipe his forehead, hand clunking against his helmet and chuckling to himself as the gut feeling grew stronger. Though he had to ignore it. He didn‚Äôt have time for gut feelings, he had an engine to get back online. Or he‚Äôd freeze. Most likely. 

Bursting into a large room, he pumped his fist as he saw the familiar shapes of the engine. The large pipes carrying hydrogen to the reactor all funneling into the massive central metal and concrete beast at the center. Warning labels and radiation symbols covering the area as he pulled out his wrench, slotting it into a lever and pulling slowly. A section of wall peeling away as the emergency door is opened. The watertight tube holding the control rods in the center of the- wait. Something wasn‚Äôt right, the room was covered in small round balls. Or most of the room, since the only light in here was from the red giant behind him, from the hallway. It was actually quite dark. 

‚ÄúShit, it‚Äôs too dark to really see in here‚Ä¶ there has to be a flashlight or something in the engine room.‚Äù

He backed away from the door- almost relieved, as he didn‚Äôt really want to know what those round balls were. Maybe the control rods had broken, and that was the radioactive fuel leaking out in globs. He shuddered and began digging through the containers laying around. Mostly, it was tools, but eventually-

‚ÄúAha! There you are.‚Äù

He crooned, pulling out a heavy looking flashlight. While it was clunky, the moment he turned it on it became apparent why. It flooded the entire engine room with light as if it were trying to emulate the red giant looming outside. Carefully keeping the light pointed away from himself in the interest of not going blind, he stood in the doorway into the reactor once more. And froze.

‚ÄúOh come on.‚Äù


He muttered, teeth grinding together as his eyes darted around the room. Plastered all over the reactor room were small, fleshy sacks. They almost looked like muscle that had been taken off the bone, rolled into a ball, and slapped onto the walls and left there. Wet, dripping with some sort of mysterious red liquid, and pulsing. There were hundreds of these little sacks, connected together with long strings of what looked like more flesh or maybe just some sort of ooze. And he did not like the look of them. If he wasn‚Äôt about to die of hypothermia he wouldn‚Äôt be stepping foot into this nightmare, but he didn‚Äôt have much of a choice in the matter. 

‚ÄúFuck this, fuck that-‚Äù

He whispered, pushing off whatever clean edges he could find, avoiding the fleshy nodes as best he could. So far so- All of a sudden, the ship lurched, spinning. Jacob didn‚Äôt move, but the entire room around him spun like a  top on its head, slamming his right arm into one of the pustules with a squelch. Screaming in pain, he tried to yank his arm out of the fleshy mass, but the bulb seemed to expand, engulfing the entire limb. He could feel bone cracking, bits of his environmental suit flying everywhere as flesh was ripped from his arm- it hurt. 

‚ÄúGet the fuck off me!‚Äù

He screamed, pushing off the floor, trying to rip the beast off his arm. The other flesh bulbs seemed to be wiggling, like they were laughing at his predicament. The room, still spinning, was hard to navigate, especially with this thing ripping into his arm. Distracted, he tried to grab one of the rapidly moving handles on the wall with his good arm, blood spraying out from his other limb. Turning his head, he only had a few moments to watch as the bar he had been trying to grab rapidly rushed towards his face. 


Jacob groaned as he lifted his head off the mess hall table, hair sticking up in all directions. Jumping to his feet, he began to check himself over. No rips in his suit, no pain in his arm. He didn‚Äôt even look like he had moved from his spot at the mess hall table. 

‚ÄúEvelyn!‚Äù

He yelled, her voice quickly popping up from a speaker. 

**‚ÄúYes Jacob? Your heart rate is elevated, what‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù**

Jacob whipped around towards the voice, grabbing the edges of the speaker on the wall and staring into it. 

‚ÄúTurn on all the cameras, check the engine room, check everywhere, I think there‚Äôs something on the ship.‚Äù

He panted, wiping away the cold sweat on his forehead. There were a few seconds where the only thing that could be heard was Jacob's heavy breathing. 

**‚ÄúJacob, there‚Äôs nothing in the engine room. There‚Äôs nothing anywhere on the ship.‚Äù**

Evelyn answered, worriedly. A medical drone moseying its way into the room and stopping as it‚Äôs armed unravelled into its several different tools, taking his temperature, checking vital signs, heart rate, chemical imbalances-

‚ÄúShow me.‚Äù

He said coldly, taking out his datapad- and sighing as it sparked and smoked the moment he tried to turn it on. Growling, he turned, the various tools popping off of his skin as he stormed away, towards his room. Only glancing at the wall to make sure he was going the right direction 

**‚ÄúJacob! What has gotten into you. Nothing is wrong with the ship-‚Äù** 

Slapping his hand onto the scanner to his room, he listened to Evelyn try and calm him down through the speakers 

‚ÄúShut. Up. I know what I felt and what I saw, why are you pretending you don‚Äôt know what I'm talking about?!‚Äù

He yelled, storming into his room and ripping open his locker. Pulling out his backup data pad, he tapped a few buttons and connected to the ship's cameras. Flicking through each room, he paused at the engine room. It was working normally, the emergency door closed tight as it should have been. 

‚ÄúI- i saw it, i felt it!‚Äù 

He shouted, gripping the data pad tightly in his hands. He opened the door to his room and bolted out, not hearing what Evelyn had to say as he bolted down the halls. No ice crystals, no evidence of any collisions between drones‚Ä¶ and as he burst into the engine room, he saw all the crates tightly closed. Not even the one he had pulled a flashlight out of was open. Frantically grabbing his wrench from his belt.

**‚ÄúJacob, what are you doing? JACOB DON‚ÄôT OPEN-‚Äù** 

Ignoring Evelyn, he grunted as he pried open the emergency door, the large door slowly opening- and saw the reactor, the control rods all in place, blue light illuminating the entire room. And no pustules. No fleshy tendrils connecting anywhere. Nothing. 

‚ÄúWhat- ‚Äú


A security drone‚Äôs cold grasp spread througy his shoulders, yanking him away from the reactor. Dragging him out of the engine room as another drone closed the emergency door, sealing it in place while Jacob was pulled away. 

**‚ÄúWhat the fuck was that Jacob?! You know that if the engine is running the reactor is active, you could have just absorbed enough radiation to kill you!‚Äù**

Her angry, synthetic voice reverberated through the halls as Jacob was pulled into the medical bay. The drone throwing him onto the tough bed, the scanners above, like metal arches with small bulbs, immediately getting to work. 

**‚ÄúNow you‚Äôre going to need to go through radiation treatment! You could have DIED, Jacob!?‚Äù**

Jacob stubbornly stared up into the ceiling as Evelyn ranted. 

‚ÄúX-ray my arm.‚Äù 

He muttered, pulling out his working datapad. Evelyn only getting angrier. 

**‚ÄúYou had a bad dream Jacob! There‚Äôs nothing wrong with your arm!‚Äù**

One of the machines began to slowly pan over his entire body, statistics being given to Evelyn as she redirected them to his datapad. 

**‚ÄúSee? Nothing is wrong with you  besides having a LOT of radiation in your body.‚Äù**

Jacob looked over his X-rays as the medical bed powered down, its job done. He panned over all the pictures, the data. There was his bone‚Ä¶the muscle‚Ä¶ nothing was out of place. He could have sworn that something had happened, it had been so real. He hadn‚Äôt ever had a dream that vivid but‚Ä¶he supposed there was a first for everyone, and this was his. 

**‚ÄúNow since you so stupidly ran into the reactor, you‚Äôre going to be taking a lot of pills. And you‚Äôre gonna need to flush your system.‚Äù**

Jacob sighed and covered his eyes with his arm. The darkness was nice.

‚ÄúI know. I know. It was dumb, I'll take whatever you give me Evelyn. Just- don't make it taste awful.‚Äù 

Evelyn huffed, before a tube lowered from the ceiling, and dumped out several tubes. Each one contained a different bottle of medicine. One read ‚ÄòPotassium Iodide‚Äô, another seemed to be a thick red liquid, and the last one almost looked like vitamins. Carefully, Jacob picked them up off the floor and gave them a look over. 

‚ÄúThat's it? You said a lot.‚Äù 

He asked, turning to one of the cameras in the room. 

**‚ÄúYes, well these are for the moment. I need to observe you for a couple days to see just how badly you fucked yourself over. Then I can give you more. Your suit took most of the radiation, so you probably only have mild radiation poisoning. Most likely.‚Äù**

Jacob scratched his chin as she spoke, listening best he could. He glanced down at his suit and slowly began stripping it off- pressing the button by his helmet to release the tightened fibers.

**‚Äú-and one more- JACOB! WHY ARE YOU STRIPPING?!‚Äù**

He paused and looked up, the entire suit almost entirely off his body. 

‚ÄúWell- if the suit took most of the radiation I should take it off right? It's irradiated now.‚Äù 

He could almost hear her grab the bridge of her nose, if she had one. He didn't think it was unreasonable, but maybe she-

**‚ÄúJacob. did you pay attention, at all, on earth. The environmental suits siphon the radiation into small beads of lead and then drop those on the ground. The suit is fine.‚Äù**

He sheepishly pulled his suit back up, pausing as he saw his arm. While the X-ray had shown him he was entirely fine, there was a small red line around his bicep, almost like a seam. But the closer he looked the more it just seemed like it was from the suit. Like an impression from your bed from laying wrong. 

‚ÄúRight. Uhhh‚Ä¶ Hey i'm starving, can my medicine be taken with food? I'm very ***hungry.***‚Äù 

sealing his suit back up, he opened and closed his fingers. He really was ***starving***, he felt like his stomach was eating itself. Made sense, he hadn't eaten anything when he woke up, and then he's been working for who knows how long. Maybe that's why he passed out at the table. 

‚ÄúWell then head to the mess hall. And yes, you can take them with food. Just not caffeine.‚Äù 

Jacon groaned as he found the magenta band, and began to follow. Behind him, the security drone from before seemed to be  burning something. Its arm modified into a flamethrower, it was blasting flame into a small, charred ball on the ceiling‚Ä¶

In the mess hall, Jacob tapped the top of one of the printers. He didn't know what he wanted to ***eat***, so he let his stomach decide. Just letting his hand tap away at the keyboard. 

**‚ÄúWow, you really are hungry. A whole ham, a pound of mash potatoes and sausage gravy.‚Äù** 

Evelyn said, surprised at the sheer amount of food he was printing. 

‚ÄúOh, Yeah, I mean I haven't eaten anything today, so I figured why not get a large meal. If I don't finish it I'll have leftovers.‚Äù

Watching as a steaming ham was printed before his eyes, his mouth watered- and his arm shot out, grabbing the still steaming hot unfinished ham and shoving it into his face. With a yelp, he dropped the ham with a splat. 

‚Äúow!‚Äù 

He looked down at his hand, and flexed his fingers. He must have been ***hungrier*** than he thought, if his hands were moving before his mind could stop them. 

**‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶just wow.‚Äù**

Evelyn teased, making Jacob roll his eyes. Punching in the code again (the nozzle stopped if the print was interrupted) he had to wait again for the ham to finish. This time, keeping his hand in check as the mouth watering smell of honeyed ham filled the room again. Well, doubled, since the ham on the floor also smelled delicious. But that one would need to be cleaned up, this one was for him. 

When it finished, he carefully picked it up by the plate and carried it to the table. The moment he set it down onto the metal top, his hand grabbed a fistful of ham and shoved it into his mouth. His eyes watering as the heat hit his face again, he chewed. It was delicious, and took another bite. and another. And another. Taking sips from his red liquid (it tasted AWFUL, like liquid cherry medicine) all the while. 

By the time he finished the ham, his potatoes were done. His hand shot out and grabbed the plate again, shoving more food down his gullet. The gravy spilled from the nozzle onto an empty build plate as he licked his lips. 

**‚ÄúOkay, increased appetite‚Ä¶not really a symptom of radiation, I hope that's just because you skipped your- breakfast?‚Äù**

Jacob gulped down the last of his potato, holding up a hand while he did. fingers twitching a bit 

‚ÄúWell it helps that it was delicious. Someone must have gotten top of the line printers because hot damn- that was amazing.‚Äù 

He patted his stomach and glared at the rest of his medicine, before sighing and picking one up- and tossing it across the room.

‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù 

**‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù**

Both of them spoke in unison, as the orange bottle hit the wall and rolled around on the ground. Jacob looked at his arm, then the bottle, as he stood- walking to the bottle and picking it back up. Again, his arm moved on its own and tossed it across the room. 

**‚ÄúJacob stop messing around.‚Äù** 

Evelyn said, irritated as a medical drone floated into the room. 

‚Äúi'm not doing that on purpose. Maybe I have nerve damage?‚Äù 

He asked worriedly, flexing his fingers as he tried again to pick up the medicine bottle- this time, he didn't toss it. 

**‚ÄúUh-huh. Totally.‚Äù**

1hszmd7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hszmd7,Espresso Tamper and Portafilter made from Tulipwood,"Made from Tulipwood and finished with Danish oil. It's a birthday gift for my friend that loves making espresso. 

This is my first turning project that hasn't resulted in a major mistake or design flaw so I'm pretty happy about it. The tamper and portafilter handles are both threaded into their respective bases so can be replaced if necessary. 

Definitely some areas for improvement but I'm focusing on being happy with my work and not obsessing over minor imperfections that likely I'll only notice. Since making this my approach I've been having much more success overall. 

I'm very new to turning so still not confident to turn a perfect circle for the handle on the tamper. Decided to leave it flat to ""allow for even pressure"", definitely not because I wasn't confident in my ability to turn a nice even bead. If anyone has any advice on how to do this I'm all ears.  

If anyone is interested I bought the portafilter on Amazon, I got my friend's wife to tell me the model number of the espresso machine they have and then bought a compatible portafilter. I got lucky and the one I bought actually had a detachable handle so I was able to use the included threading for my handle. 

I searched online for tamper base kits but couldn't find any in stock. Eventually I found a store called Coffee Addicts and they sell lots of different types of bases. This one is 54mm. ",22,1735944995.0,turning,6,1.0,False

1hszlg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1hszlg8/restless_sleep/,Restless sleep,"**Background**: I sleep at 12-1 am, but as the sun starts rising (5-6am) I start tossing and turning, in and out of sleep. By about 7am I'll actually wake up and open my eyes, but if this is still too early depending on the day, I'll just go back to sleep, continuing to go in and out of sleep until I get up at 10:30-11:30am. Throughout the day I don't feel tired, maybe unmotivated, but if I lay in bed in the afternoon I will fall asleep and  continue the same pattern of going in and out of sleep for 1-2 hrs. 

For reference, I'm 16yrs on holiday so this is just my natural sleep pattern without any alarms. But only getting 5 hours (if I don't want to keep tossing and turning) doesn't seem okay, even if I'm not feeling the effects atm. I live a healthy lifestyle, good diet (although dinner is quite late if I don't wake up early/nap), light exercise, no social media, although I do have a high screen time bc. of youtube+reading, no coffee just tea, journal/don't feel very stressed, social.

In 2022 I struggled with insomnia due to external stressors, struggling to fall asleep as well as stay asleep, waking up in a cold sweat throughout the night. Since then, I've used melatonin (1mg) irregularly, only if I rlly need to make sure I get good sleep / am changing my sleep schedule. Of course,  even though I haven't struggled with insomnia since then, my sleep schedule has been what can be expected of a typical teenager.

But up until recently, for a good month I was sleeping consistently well: 10pm-6am, in about 10 minutes. So it's definitely possible for me to get back on track!

**Questions**: Is there a name for this type of restless sleep? Should I be worried if this continues long-term? Would this affect my performance in school? Is it better to just get up or keep going back to sleep? What are possible causes? Have you had any experience with this issue/ is it normal?",1,1735944925.0,sleep,0,1.0,False

Last night I told my roommate that I was going to do a Goodwill trip and to leave whatever she had in the hallway for me to take. Well, cut to today around 1:00PM and I was taking around 4 of my own bags and 1 of hers that I saw in the hallway downstairs to put them in my car for Goodwill. I got everything to Goodwill with little to no problems-snow doesn't count-and I even stopped to get myself a Dunkin' coffee and McDonald's fries and nuggets (not that it really matters). So I get home and am on my laptop for around 4.5 hours before my roommate gets home and just thinking it was a successful day. My roommate gets home and notices the bag in the hallway was gone and asks me where it went. I informed her that I took it to Goodwill like I had said. She's immediately upset and informs me that it was her laundry that she had been piling up for the last few weeks as she packed up her room. I'm immediately ashamed and call the Goodwill only to be informed they had likely already put it onto the floor, but that we could come look for her stuff and take it. She is back from her bathroom break at this point and picks up her keys to go to Goodwill and hopefully get her stuff. We have a mini argument because she wants me to go help her search for her stuff, but I insisted that I wouldn't even know what I'm looking for because I don't pay enough attention to what she wears or owns. She promptly leaves and has been gone for around 30 minutes as of now.

TL;DR: As the title says, I took my roommate's bag of laundry to Goodwill and now she may have lost a 13 Gallon trash bag worth of stuff if she can't find it at the store. I will update when she gets back if she was able to find any or all of her stuff.",0,1735944912.0,tifu,9,0.37,False

Iv been in therapy for 7 months so far and have been doing self reflecting/meditating for about 10 months. 
I cut my mom off 2 years ago. 
I recently tried to reach out to her, to have a coffee admit her wrongs and listen to why I cut her off in the first place, and give her another chance to be my mom. 
I gave her 3 weeks to think about it. 
I spoke to my therapist to get her opinion, she said go for it but dont expect an apology or anything. 
So instead of saying to my mom I want to see her again. I decided that its better to not see her as all of my progress would be for nothing and be diminished( i have a pattern of getting close and then pushing her away, I stopped it from happening again, I have BPD.) 
Her text back to me was that she agreed that she doesn't want to see me again either. So it just goes to show she cant be accountable for her mistakes and cant actually love anyone, cuzz she doesn't think she does anything wrong. 
Im so sad with no motivation as my body is in shock for the last couple days since she agreed no contact.

**I am in search of a mentor who would be willing to let me come into their studio to shadow and learn from.** Someone to help me take my first steps into this beautiful area of the music industry. What I offer in return is an eager mindset to learn, along with any type of volunteer help your studio might need. Whether its setting up a mic stand or grabbing you a cup of coffee, I'm ready.    
  
I am a professional musician in the Madison area (I play saxophone). I graduated with a math degree and worked for AmFam for a bit as an automation developer, but decided that corporate life was not for me. Thus, in 2022 I left Amfam and moved to Peru to do some soul searching... after lots of interesting, life changing events, I met my wife (an incredible singer) and moved back to Madison this year.  
  
Now, as a stubborn alternative to returning to corporate America, I am pursuing music production and mixing/mastering as it perfectly combines all my interests in tech, music and analog gear, among other things. There is nothing I'd rather do than sit in a studio messing with knobs to find the perfect sound. 

Unfortunately, I'm having difficulty finding people here in Madison who do this professionally and am not sure where to begin.

Here is a google drive containing some of the music I've been producing and mixing with my wife:
