I have an old Nespresso essenza that stopped working. The machine can make coffee, but the on/off button doesn't work anymore. I tried to fix it, but I can't understand how it works. Does anyone know? The first picture is the on/off board, inside the machine. Second picture is the button itself. Third picture is the back of the button, which is what touches the board. If I wiggle a screwdriver around the board, it eventually turns on, but I can't understand how.

In this same time Supervisors/Head Baristas have gotten a 15p raise (April 2025). Supervisors/Head Baristas do everything Baristas do and:
- Weekly grinder cleaning and maintenance
- Batch brew + espresso recipe setting
- Stock management (ordering, stock count & reconciliation) 
- Scheduling (staff sick calls/covers)
- Onboarding and training new staff 
- Assigning and ensuring cleaning duties are completed every day
- Monitor and report wastage + investigate problem areas. 

All of this requires three months of training. And you’re telling me it only deserves 40p more per hour than a regular barista? How is that fair? Who will even want to be a Supervisor/HB if the raise is that poor?? What an embarrassing company. No wonder the entirety of specialty coffee shits on them. They can keep calling themselves specialty but the quality they produce has gone significantly downhill in the past two years and they don’t help themselves when they treat their employees like machines that can just pull 16h shifts on command.

1je5kx7,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1je5kx7/passover/,Passover.,"One April, many years ago my family and I were celebrating Passover. Now this is a holiday I have participated in for all my life, and the story of Moses and the Exodus is one I, and many people I’m sure are familiar with. But I want to tell you about the last plague from the story, about how a spirit of death would kill the firstborn of every family, except for those who had smeared lambs blood over the top of their door.



 On this particular holiday, on a particular year, my wife, and three children returned home in our minivan from having dinner at my in-laws home that evening. As we piled into our front door, my youngest spoke up and asked me; “Dad, do we have to mark our door with blood?” “No” I laughed, but then I had an idea, just a dumb, simple idea that a parent sometimes thinks of to entertain their child, “But maybe we can!” I picked up my youngest, and carried them into the kitchen where I set him down, and opened one of the many cupboards to get out some red food dye. I mixed some in with water, and dipped in a paint bush to lightly paint a small smear of light red over our door frame, just as in the Exodus.  



That night I had a nightmare where I was standing in the hall in front of our bedroom, looking down towards the front door of our home. I just looked down the hall, silently staring at the front door that was slightly ajar, and letting in a wedge of golden morning light that shown across the hardwood floor. but this feeling of dread had frozen me in place, I knew somehow something sinister was waiting for me behind the open door, just out of view. But no matter how much I wanted to shut the door, I knew it would be a race to see who was faster, me, or what was hiding on the other side of the door. Thankfully I would never find out that answer, as I would wake up that morning in a cold sweat.



I woke up that morning feeling groggy and generally unrested, and the dream still fading in and out of my waking memory. My wife still slept, but I decided to get up out of  bed, being careful not to disturb her, and make some coffee, and get ready to face the day as usual. While the coffee was brewing in the machine on the counter, I put on my untied shoes, and in my robe and PJ’s, walked outside to get the paper that was usually at the end of the driveway at this time. But Before I could leave the threshold of my door, what I saw, like in my dream, froze me in place. Laying scattered randomly all up and down the street, where the lifeless bodies of every one of my neighbors laying is dark pools of their own blood, each one dragged from their home after being violently murdered. Every, single, one. Even their pets lie lifeless and sprawling along the suburban road. I didn’t even notice my wife come up behind me to ask me what I was doing, but looking over my shoulder seeing what I did, shocked speechless just as I was. I finally snapped from my daze, and turned hurriedly to go back inside to get the phone to call the police. But as I did, I saw the smear of red on my door frame, just above my head from the day before, and there in the mix of red food coloring and water where, the tell tale signs of someones inspecting fingers.

She was a NEET dropper, and I’m an engineering student—we had a two-year age gap. We even shared our photos (though she deleted hers after I viewed them). She would send me snaps with a timer, so I couldn’t save any of them, while she saved most of my snaps.

After a while, we started calling each other. She was the one who insisted on calling, while I was the one who always insisted on ending the call due to some personal reasons. She would talk about her day, share her experiences (including how her ex was toxic), and I noticed that she sometimes blushed while talking to me. We had around 5-6 calls, each lasting 40-50 minutes.

At one point, I asked for her Pinterest because Instagram seemed boring to me. I’m active on Pinterest and post my pictures there, so she could easily see me anytime. But for me, it was completely one-sided—I had no option to see her anywhere. It felt like I was talking to a faceless person. Eventually, I realized Pinterest Messenger sucks, so I asked for her Instagram 2-3 times, but she kept denying it for silly reasons—I still don’t know why.

Despite this, things were going well, and we even decided to have a coffee date after her NEET exam. But after about 25 days, I honestly forgot what she looked like, so I asked her to send me a picture. We agreed to exchange pictures again, but due to a misunderstanding on my part, she suddenly said she didn’t want my pictures anymore. I jokingly asked, ""Kalesh ke mood me ho?"" (Are you in the mood for drama?), to which she replied, ""Yes.""

So, I said, ""Then let's not talk."" (Because, by then, I knew she had started liking me a little too.) She stayed on my Snapchat screen for 4-5 minutes before replying with a simple ""Ok, bye."" Then, she removed me as a friend, and I did the same.

1je56pq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ostomy/comments/1je56pq/having_bag_blowouts/,Having Bag Blowouts,"Hey guys, I've been having poor luck this past March with my ileostomy. My 2-piece system (Coloplast) keeps on having bag blowouts. Specifically, the Brava wax ring I use between the flange and my skin, it doesn't hold for more than 2 days. I wake up in the early morning (1am to 2am) with that itching, burning sensation and have to change everything because it just couldn't hold. I use to manage every 4 days, so this is really aggravating. 

Did I get a shitty box of Brava rings? Did I get a shitty box of flanges? I have no idea and I'll be calling the support line (also seeing if I can get some freebies outta this!) because I am stressed/tired/frustrated/angry. Did I mention that I'm dealing with some peristomal skin issues because of this? Talk about being paranoid all the time.

For context, the first time the bag blew was March 6th, after having eaten some tortilla chips. I have since removed those from my diet. The next time was March 9th; from what I'm guessing a 1/4 cup of refried beans and the Bavarian sausage did me in. Then, March 14th - I had some sashimi, rice, and some of the sliced ginger. About a cup of rice. I chew like a cow, but around 4am, there it was again. March 16th, another early morning bag blow. And then 2am today.

It boils down to: What am I doing wrong? Most of my diet consists of white rice (1/2 to 1 cup), chicken (breaded cutlet), fried eggs, scrambled eggs, boiled eggs, plain bagel with smooth peanut butter, yogurt and banana, at most 2 cups of coffee a day with almond milk and raw honey for sweetness, salt and vinegar chips, Aylmer vegetable soup or Lipton chicken noodle. I like fish and chicken for my proteins, I am terrified of having veggies unless they're pureed because of a semi-blockage in my small intestines'. I try to eat before 7pm so I don't have a big output or backflow. 

I sleep on my left side hugging a small pillow because I still ""feel off""; I have tried with a wedge pillow but that's still a work in progress. I use to sleep with a small electric blanket but stopped because I assumed the retained heat under the bed sheets was melting the ring faster.

All in all, can anyone provide insight? Do I have to go back to basics with my food intake? Cut down on coffee? Try a different Brava ring? Make do with the wedge pillow and sleep on my back?

If you’re working from home or hopping between coffee shops, you’ve probably wondered: **Is a coworking space really worth the cost?** 💰

As someone freelancing for a while, I’ve faced the usual struggles—distractions at home, unstable Wi-Fi, and the loneliness of working solo. After trying out different coworking spaces, here’s what I’ve found:

# Why Coworking Spaces Are Game-Changers for Freelancers

* **Boosts Productivity** – No more procrastination or Netflix temptations! The work-focused environment helps you stay on track. 
* **Reliable Internet & Office Setup** – Fast Wi-Fi, ergonomic chairs, printers, and meeting rooms—everything you need! 
* **Networking & Collaboration** – Meet like-minded professionals, potential clients, and partners. You never know who you’ll sit next to! 🤝 
* **Work-Life Balance** – Separating home and work helps maintain a routine and avoid burnout. 
* **Cost-Effective** – Renting an office is expensive, but coworking spaces give you all the perks at a fraction of the cost.

# When It Might Not Be Worth It

* If you rarely need a quiet workspace
* If you’re happy working from home with zero distractions
* If your budget is super tight and you don’t mind missing out on networking opportunities

# My Experience: Why I Switched to a Coworking Space

After struggling with productivity and isolation, I decided to try out a coworking space. I checked out a few places, and the best fit for me was [**Exospace**](https://www.exospace.in/) in Bhubaneswar. It’s affordable, has a great community, and offers everything I need to work efficiently.

💡 **Pro Tip:** If you’re unsure, many coworking spaces offer free trials or day passes. Give it a shot and see if it improves your workflow!

### Faucet Water Filters: Convenience at Your Fingertips

## Factors to Consider When Choosing a PUR PLUS Water Filter

Choosing the RIGHT type of PUR PLUS water filter depends on several factors. Considering the following elements, you can make an informed decision and find a filter that aligns with your needs and lifestyle.

### Water Quality

The quality of your tap water is a primary consideration. If you live in an area with known water quality issues, such as high lead levels or chemical contamination, you'll want to prioritize a filter certified to remove these specific contaminants. A water quality test can provide valuable insights into the composition of your tap water. Look for filters with certifications and test data that specifically target the contaminants present in your water.

### Water usage

How much filtered water do you typically consume daily? If you only need filtered water for drinking, a pitcher filter might suffice. However, for households that use filtered water for cooking, making coffee, and filling water bottles, a faucet filter or dispenser would be more convenient. Estimate your daily water consumption to determine the appropriate capacity and filtration speed needed.

### Budget

PUR PLUS water filters vary in price based on type, features, and filtration capabilities. Factor in both the upfront cost of the filtration system and the ongoing cost of filter replacements. While a cheaper filter may seem appealing initially, the long-term cost of frequent replacement might potentially be higher than that of a more expensive, longer-lasting filter. Searching for a PUR PLUS water filter sale might result in great deals. Checking for a best price PUR PLUS water filter online or discounts is a good idea.

### Ease of Installation and Maintenance

Consider how easy the filter is to install and maintain. Faucet filters are generally easy to install and require minimal tools. Pitcher filters require no installation. dispensers require more space. Filter replacements are a recurring task for all types of filters. Check the filter life and replacement cost to determine the overall cost of ownership. The PUR PLUS water filter replacement schedule is important to take note of.### Features

Some PUR PLUS water filters offer additional features like filter change indicators, multiple spray settings (for faucet filters), and electronic displays. Determine which features are important to you and choose a model that meets your needs. Some even offer filter-as-you-go filtration technology.

### Space Constraints

Evaluate the amount of space you have available in your kitchen. pitcher filters and faucet filters are compact options that don't take up much counter space. Though, dispensers occupy more space and require a dedicated spot on your countertop or in your refrigerator.

## PUR PLUS vs. Brita: A Rapid Comparison

PUR and Brita are two of the leading brands in the water filtration market. Both brands offer a range of products, including faucet filters, pitcher filters, and dispensers. The main difference lies in the contaminants the filters are certified to reduce and the features they offer.Many consumers are looking at a PUR PLUS vs Brita comparison as part of their research.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Came out quite great IMO: 

Park Hyatt: ""Where rich people go to prove they're richer, expect marble bathrooms and a bill that'll make your eyes water. Also, the concierge might judge your shoes.""

Grand Hyatt: ""Convention central. Prepare for a sea of suits, overpriced cocktails, and the faint scent of conference room coffee. The gym is impressive, though, if you can find it.""

Hyatt Regency: ""The 'we're trying to be everything to everyone' hotel. Good for business trips, okay for vacations, and guaranteed to have a buffet breakfast that's just...fine.""

Hyatt Centric: ""Hipster-adjacent. They'll have cool art and local craft beer, but the rooms might be tiny and the 'local experience' could just be a map to the nearest overpriced coffee shop.""

The Unbound Collection by Hyatt: ""Basically, they bought some weird, cool hotels and slapped a loyalty program on them. Hit or miss, but at least it's not another beige box.""

Destination by Hyatt: ""We're going to make you really feel the local culture, by charging you a premium for it. Expect 'authentic' experiences that are carefully curated for tourists.""

Hyatt Zilara/Ziva: ""All-inclusive, which means unlimited mediocre food and watered-down drinks. Perfect for escaping reality, less perfect for your waistline. Expect a lot of screaming children, or screaming adults, depending on the hotel.""

Hyatt Place: ""The 'we're not a motel, we swear' hotel. Clean, functional, and perfect for when you just need a bed and maybe a sad little breakfast sandwich. The gym is usually a treadmill and a dream.""

Hyatt House: ""Extended stay, so expect a kitchenette and the lingering smell of microwaved leftovers. It's like living in a slightly nicer dorm room.""

Andaz: ""We're trying really hard to be cool and local, but we're still a chain. Cool design, but sometimes function takes a back seat. And expect to pay a premium for that cool design.""

Thompson Hotels: ""Where the vibe is 'too cool for you.' Expect dim lighting, moody music, and a cocktail menu you can't pronounce. Also, prepare for small rooms, and big prices.""

Hyatt Vivid Grand Island: ""New and all inclusive, so we are still working out the kinks. Please be patient while we try to figure out how to make all the food, and drinks, at the same time.""

Caption by Hyatt: ""We're trying to make you be friends with strangers, and also work at the same time. Expect exposed brick, and a lot of people on laptops. Please do not expect quiet.""

1je4ykg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1je4ykg,A Review of Prince Nana Coffee,"TL;DR for non-weird coffee people: You're paying for the label, but it delivers a classic ""diner coffee"" cup that's perfect for your Mr. Coffee. 

TL;DR for weird coffee people: A medium-dark roast commodity coffee with some quality control issues. Fairly woody taste but not bitter, a bit better than it looks.

  
As a weird coffee person and big AEW mark, I knew [this coffee](https://princenanacoffee.com/products/house-blend) was in my destiny. I got this coffee for Christmas and was delighted. I had no doubt this was Nana putting a label on some commodity coffee and had set my expectations accordingly.

CONS: 

\- HOW DO YOU NOT CALL IT ""WHOSE HOUSE"" BLEND????!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!

\- Questionable quality control. The overall roast on these beans is medium-dark; it's not an oily mess out of the bag, which was a pleasant surprise. But there are a TON of broken pieces and quakers in the bag. It was kind of shocking. Even cheap grocery store coffee does a better job of sorting out broken pieces. And the roast itself is fairly uneven on individual beans. I expect any bag of coffee to have off-roast beans per cup, but you can see the variability of roast level on individual beans.

\- ""100% Pure Coffee"" - so.... it doesn't contain chickory? Cool. Basically just telling you it's a Robusta-Arabica blend. 

PROS:

\- Not overly bitter! I've had ""medium roasts"" that have been the equivalent of charcoal and was surprised that the beans weren't scorched and that the coffee actually has a taste besides ""roast."" It's mostly woody, but as long as you drink it before it gets to room temp it never gets to rubbery. 

\- Comes in a nice resealable bag. Will definitely reuse it once I'm done with the beans. 

\- I don't think the coffee was fresh but I don't taste that weird oxidized thing you get from really stale coffee, so maybe not that old.

\- You get to think of the Prince Nana dance every time you make a cup.

Is this a great coffee? Not even close. Does it delight me every time I look at it? Yes. I'm happy to have given Prince Nana a few bones in exchange for some commodity coffee. It sort of feels beside the point to brew this in a V60, but it gets the job done. The coffee does best brewed in the low to mid 80C, ground a little courser than you'd usually go, and served in a classic diner mug. 

My only other AEW consumable merch was the Little Bit of the Bubbly, and this is a better coffee than that was a sparkling wine. ",55,1742304548.0,AEWOfficial,4,0.97,False

This innovative experiment, dubbed Project Hangang, will involve 100,000 participants and run for a thrilling three months, providing a first-hand look at CBDCs in action. 

Imagine converting your regular bank deposits into digital tokens that can be used for everyday purchases. Thanks to this pilot, participants will be able to buy goodies from well-known merchants like 7-Eleven and Ediya Coffee, all with a simple QR code scan through their banking apps. Just think of swipe-to-shop convenience! Each person can have up to 1 million won (about $690), with a total limit of 5 million won during the pilot. 

This initiative is a collaborative effort between seven major South Korean banks, designed to simplify payment processes and reduce transaction costs. The goal? To discover if CBDCs can streamline current banking setups and bring about more efficient transactions. 

As noted by the Bank of Korea, this testing phase builds on prior research and marks a significant move towards integrating CBDCs into our daily lives. Not only does this align South Korea with global CBDC trends, but it also positions the nation as a frontrunner in real-world applications of digital currencies. 

Could this be a stepping stone towards a future where $BTC, $ETH, and other digital assets become commonplace in retail? Investors and crypto enthusiasts, keep your eyes peeled—this is certainly one to watch!

1je4wrd,https://i.redd.it/htb4o45i9gpe1.jpeg,Saffron Fields Region Background,"[Note: This is a schizopasta based on Rebel Inc. The author does not recommend anyone read it]

The ""Saffron Fields"" region was known for its golden-yellow saffron fields, which brought wealth and fame to the land as a cultural center. However, by the end of the 20th century, this prosperous region fell under tyranny. In the 1980s, Sadam Kashani came to power, a self-proclaimed ""Golden Shah,"" whose charisma was combined with ruthless cruelty. Kashani built his regime on a cult of personality, surrounding himself with portraits in poses of ancient kings and forcing the population to praise him in hymns where he was called the ""Guardian of Saffron."" His rule began with promises of regional revival but quickly grew into repression against any dissent: opponents were executed in central squares, and their families were sent to labor camps in mountainous areas.

From 1995 to 1999, ""Saffron Fields"" waged a protracted war with the neighboring Republic (like Mountain Pass), whose lands lay beyond the southeastern mountains. The conflict, known as the ""Water War,"" erupted over disputes about control of the river that fed both regions. Kashani, confident in his military might, sent an army through the Foxtrot Juliett passes, but his plans failed due to poor troop preparation and guerrilla attacks by militias. The fighting was accompanied by the destruction of villages such as Golf Papa and Echo Papa, where houses were burned and fields were covered with salt. By 1999, the war ended without a clear winner, leaving the region exhausted.
After the war, Kashani strengthened control by introducing a saffron tax that enriched his elite but ruined farmers. His ambitious dam project on the river, called the ""Great Saffron Barrier,"" was supposed to provide water for his capital Delta Yankee but caused protests: rural communities feared it would flood their fields and deprive them of their livelihoods. Protests were suppressed with brutality, which sowed the first seeds of resistance.

By 2001, Kashani's position had become shaky. His army, weakened by war, could not cope with growing unrest, and rumors of secret negotiations with foreign powers and the use of chemical weapons against the rebellious population ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) undermined his authority. In winter 2001, an international coalition led by major powers, under the pretext of ""liberating the region from tyranny"" and ""protecting human rights,"" began Operation Golden Flower.
Coalition forces easily captured key cities: Echo Whiskey fell after three days of siege, and Golf Sierra after the garrison surrendered, fleeing and leaving behind supplies of saffron. However, in mountainous areas such as Foxtrot Mike and Foxtrot Kilo, the coalition faced fierce resistance: local militias, armed with trophy weapons, set up ambushes using terrain and dense forests.
Sadam Kashani, hiding in a bunker under his residence in Delta Yankee, tried to organize a counteroffensive, but his plan failed due to the betrayal of generals who surrendered positions in exchange for amnesty. In April 2002, during a ridiculous escape attempt, Kashani was captured. His truck, loaded with bags of saffron, got stuck in the mud on the road to Charlie Kilo, and coalition soldiers found him in a ridiculous pose - with a gold ring in his hand and a bottle of local wine. He was tried for crimes against the population and then hanged without the right to appeal the verdict in an expedited manner. The coalition established a temporary administration, but its presence was limited: troops began preparing for withdrawal, leaving the region at the mercy of local forces.

After Kashani's fall, chaos ensued in the region. The power vacuum was filled by a new force - the insurgent group ""Crimson Swords,"" led by Kashani's former military leaders and local leaders from mountain clans. Their symbol - 2 red swords surrounded by a black diamond and white ornaments, inspired by ancient craft patterns - became the banner of resistance. The ""Crimson Swords"" declared themselves fighters for independence, accusing the coalition of plundering saffron riches and destroying traditional ways. Their leader, a mysterious warrior named Rustam al-Saffron, a former commander of Kashani, called for a ""return to the golden age"" through the overthrow of ""foreign invaders.""
Rebel bases began forming in hard-to-reach mountainous zones of Foxtrot Juliett, Foxtrot Mike, and Delta Kilo, where the coalition failed to gain a foothold. These camps, hidden in caves and dense forests, became training centers: rebels were trained in guerrilla warfare, using captured weapons and improvised mines. The neighboring republic (for reference, in the game, messages regularly appear about financing rebels by a neighboring state (damn 7 bucks for a counterattack)), thirsting for revenge for past defeats, became their secret sponsor. Through smugglers crossing the mountain paths of Foxtrot Kilo, they supplied automatic rifles, grenades, and even radio stations, hoping to destabilize the region and force the coalition to leave.

By April 2002, the war had ended, but ""Saffron Fields"" remained on the brink of a new conflict. Coalition forces, though victorious, began winding down operations, leaving local armed formations to maintain order. These forces, formed from Kashani's former soldiers and recruits, were poorly trained: their rifles often jammed, and their uniforms were patched. Coalition commanders who decided to stay temporarily tried to strengthen positions, but their authority was undermined both among the population and among rebels who called them ""puppets of the infidels.""
The population of ""Saffron Fields"" split. Urban elites living in Delta Yankee and Echo Whiskey welcomed the coalition, seeing it as a chance for modernization: they opened cafes and traded with foreign soldiers, exchanging saffron for coffee and cigarettes. Rural communities, especially in Golf Papa and Echo Papa, accused foreigners of destroying traditional ways: their homes were destroyed, and old mills along the river fell into disrepair. In the mountainous regions of Foxtrot Juliett and Foxtrot Mike, the ""Crimson Sickles"" enjoyed support due to promises to restore independence and share wealth. Legends of the ancient king Saffron-ibn-Gold, who supposedly protected the valley from invaders, became part of rebel rhetoric, strengthening their influence among local clans.
Religious communities, which previously served as mediators between warring parties, now divided. Mullahs in cities supported the coalition, hoping for peace and restoration of mosques destroyed by war, while mountain sheikhs joined rebels, seeing them as a force capable of resisting the ""infidels.""",22,1742304399.0,rebelinc,2,1.0,False

I got some basic lighting going (some candles, a few flashlights pointed at the ceiling, and a few battery-powered lanterns) and then immediately pulled out the Solix C1000 and plugged the refrigerator into it. It fired right up and was running fine when I left for work. It was at 85% when I left, and the screen showed it could run for another 5-6 hours wide open (which should mean it will last a fair bit longer as the compressor is only running about half the time).

I used the smaller Solix C800 to brew a pot of coffee for my wife and then to power a hot plate to cook breakfast for my daughter. The coffee + breakfast pulled the capacity from full down to about 47%. The coffee maker is a doozey. 

I have a couple of smaller power banks as well, and I used one of them to power lights in my daughter's room so she could get ready for school. 

Power is out only my neighborhood and is supposed to be restored around noon. We'll see how the refrigerator fairs over the course of the day. I considered staying home to see if I could power my router/modem and work remote, but apparently the internet service is also out (somehow related to the power problem).

1je4oqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1je4oqq/how_do_you_decline_social_events/,How do you decline social events,"I’ve moved overseas with my husband’s job. I never had a lot of friends back in the UK but I have a handful of close friends. 

I keep being invited to social events with other women. I don’t mind one on one interaction but I don’t feel the need to meet up for coffee with the same person every couple of days. It’s exhausting. I really really don’t want to attend things like toddler group with a dozen other mums, card groups with 20 women twice a week etc. My child goes to pre school so she’s getting interaction there. 

I’m really happy being on my own most of the time. I have a chronic illness so I nap every afternoon. If I’m able to I can go for a walk with my headphones in (it’s really safe here) or go to the gym or pool. Then sometimes other expat women think I’m lonely and don’t have any friends and try and chat to me in the sauna or jacuzzi. But I’m really happy going for a coffee and reading my kindle or browsing the shops on my own! 

I have occasional events I have to go to with my husband but he’s there to support me so I can mask for a couple of hours and then do nothing the next day.

I’ve also noticed the age old pattern that I meet a fellow mum here, we have a coffee together and then she never Whatsapps me again because obviously I’m too weird. 😂

After a week, he asked if we wanted to meet up. I was happy to text and asked when he was available. He said this week is good and then gave me his number, and I messaged him on WhatsApp and suggested we go for a walk and have a coffee or something. He just replied: Hi. I'd love to. Nothing against it.

1je4kmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1je4kmu/aitah_for_confessing_my_feelings_to_a_coworker/,AITAH for confessing my feelings to a coworker?,"So, here’s the deal—I’ve been volunteering abroad since October, and there’s this girl I work with who’s absolutely amazing. She’s gorgeous, kind, and has a heart of gold. At first, I wasn’t looking for anything serious, but over time, I started to feel like maybe she was into me too.

There were signs—she painted a portrait of my dogs (which, like… effort, right?), we hung out at the Christmas market with some coworkers, had a blast, and then she straight-up asked me on WhatsApp what kind of girls I liked and if she was my type. And what did I do? I panicked like an idiot and dodged the question because I was scared. Smooth.

Fast forward a bit—I went back home for a visit, and when I returned, I gave her a necklace to thank her for the painting. She was super happy. I was also the only one who remembered her birthday, so I baked her a cake. Things were going well… until a new volunteer showed up.

At first, I didn’t care, but this dude basically glued himself to her side like a lost puppy, and yeah, the jealousy hit hard. It got to the point where I was getting low-key aggressive and knew I had to do something before I lost it.

So, this week, I finally grew a pair and told her how I felt. She seemed surprised—said she wasn’t expecting it and didn’t know if she was ready for a relationship—but she appreciated my honesty and said it didn’t mean she was rejecting me. Later, I messaged her apologizing for being so direct and asked if she’d like to grab a coffee and talk more calmly. She said yes and told me I didn’t need to apologize, that being honest was a good thing.

Now I’m stuck in my head wondering—did I mess this up? Was confessing a mistake? I felt like I had to get it off my chest because the whole situation with this other guy was messing me up, and I was starting to act like an ass.

My mother suddenly died 2 wks. ago -just when we were going to set our meeting date.  I've been 2,000 km. Away For funeral and family stuff.
So far it's been great emailing nearly daily between each us. This alone, i appreciate mutual and natural desire for us to share daily like this, with a lot of curiosity and learning about each other. We are reliable for each other in this way. We've had 1 long video-chat.

In addition to some shared passions anlifelong activities in arts snd creativity, our topics include bit on food/ cooking explorations, where we've lived, worked,  our lifestyles (some differences), not as much on travel yet, bits on current family situation.  
I'm not naturally flirty in words, even though I'm a wordsmith lover. 

Meanwhile a huge part of me, is bracing for a possible let-down in actual meeting. So am enjoying our topic discussions -- which is like a form of foreplay. Admittedly I do get aroused at the end sometimes. And we don't talk about sexual stuff.

Hey everyone! So I broke up with my boyfriend after a year together back in jan. He took 9 months to tell his family about me, and 10 to ask me to actually be his girlfriend, however by this point, we were certainly together. He was going out with other girls for coffee but didn’t see the issue with not telling me for months. He also accused me of cheating as I turned my location off, however I did this as i got incredibly sick, not being able to walk so was going nowhere. He would text me saying a girl won’t stop texting him but never actually told them he was seeing someone, despite me encouraging him to say that. The list goes on, so needless to say I broke up with him (even though he couldn’t understand why). I got back together with him a month or so later as I felt I didn’t give him a chance. I explained my feelings and he said he loved to hear where he went wrong and that i should have said earlier (as if communication was the issue…). First week back was great. I got flowers from him for the first time, and it seemed better UNTIL he said the reason I broke up with him must have been because me and my family were jealous of his achievements! He was making it very clear that he did not know what my issues were, and couldn’t see a problem with his behaviour, despite him seeming pretty coherent when we rekindled. He also turned everyone against me after the first breakup, but then said it’s my problem what people think of me. My final straw was him asking me how much my rates were, got up and threw £300 of cash at me whilst I was on the bed, albeit doing it jokingly and I went along with it. I just don’t think this is something one should do whilst trying again with the relationship. I ended things a few days ago as it just wasn’t working. Aside from all that, we had a fun relationship! I feel as if I didn’t really express my feelings enough in the relationship, and maybe instead of ending things, I should have said more of how I felt? Or should he have just used common sense to not treat me like that? But since he’s now going around calling me a psycho to everyone, it makes me think I did make the right decision.

1je4gn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/SmartBizBooks/comments/1je4gn8/5_common_bookkeeping_mistakes_that_cost_small/,5 Common Bookkeeping Mistakes That Cost Small Businesses Thousands,"Bookkeeping is the backbone of any successful business. Yet, many small business owners unknowingly make costly mistakes that can lead to financial losses, tax penalties, and cash flow issues. Whether you're managing your books yourself or relying on an accountant, avoiding these errors can save you thousands of dollars in the long run.

In this blog, we’ll explore the five most common bookkeeping mistakes and provide actionable solutions to ensure your business stays financially healthy.

**1. Mixing Personal and Business Finances**

**The Mistake**

Many small business owners use the same bank account for personal and business transactions, thinking it’s convenient. However, this habit makes it incredibly difficult to track expenses, separate deductions, and maintain accurate financial records.

**Why It’s Costly**

* **Tax Headaches:** The Tax Authorities requires clear documentation of business expenses. If personal expenses get mixed in, you might lose deductions or face an audit.
* **Messy Bookkeeping:** It’s harder to see how your business is performing when personal transactions clutter your financial reports.
* **Legal Risks:** If your business is structured as an LLC or corporation, mixing finances can jeopardize your legal protections.

**How to Avoid It**

·         Open a separate business bank account and credit card.

·         Pay yourself a salary rather than withdrawing money randomly.

·         Use accounting software to track business expenses separately.

**Illustration:** Imagine you’re at a coffee shop and use your business card to buy a coffee for yourself. Later, you struggle to remember if that was a business expense or not. Multiply this by dozens of transactions, and your books become a mess!

**2. Not Keeping Track of Receipts and Expenses**

**The Mistake**

Throwing away receipts or failing to record expenses leads to missing deductions, incorrect financial reports, and potential Tax Authorities penalties.

**Why It’s Costly**

* **Lost Tax Deductions:** Without proof of expenses, you can’t claim deductions, costing you money in unnecessary taxes.
* **Cash Flow Confusion:** You might underestimate expenses, making it seem like you have more cash than you actually do.
* **Audit Risk:** If the Tax Authorities audits your business and you can’t produce receipts, you could face fines and penalties.

**How to Avoid It**

Use apps like QuickBooks, Expensify, or Hubdoc to scan and store receipts digitally.  
Set up a routine to record expenses weekly instead of waiting until tax season.  
Keep all business receipts for at least three years for Tax Authorities compliance.

**Illustration:** Let’s say you spend $500 on new office equipment but lose the receipt. When tax season comes, you forget to claim it as a deduction—losing out on valuable savings!

**3. Failing to Reconcile Bank Statements Regularly**

**The Mistake**

Many small business owners assume their bank balance is accurate and don’t cross-check their books with bank statements. However, this oversight can lead to undetected errors, fraud, or cash flow problems.

**Why It’s Costly**

* **Fraud or Errors Go Unnoticed:** If someone overcharges you or an unauthorized transaction occurs, you might not catch it in time.
* **Inaccurate Financial Reports:** If your books don’t match your bank statements, you could make decisions based on incorrect numbers.
* **Overdraft Fees:** You might believe you have more money in your account than you actually do, leading to overdrafts and penalties.

**How to Avoid It**

·         Reconcile bank statements with your accounting software at least once a month.

·         Set up automatic bank feeds in bookkeeping tools like Xero or QuickBooks.

·         Watch for duplicate charges, unapproved withdrawals, or missing deposits.

**Illustration:** Imagine you deposit a $1,000 check from a client, but the bank misplaces it. If you don’t reconcile your books, you may assume the money is there—until payments start bouncing!

**4. Misclassifying Employees and Contractors**

**The Mistake**

Many small businesses misclassify workers—mistaking independent contractors for employees or vice versa. This mistake can result in hefty fines and back taxes.

**Why It’s Costly**

* **Tax Authorities Penalties:** If the Tax Authorities determines a contractor should have been classified as an employee, you may owe back taxes, interest, and penalties.
* **Legal Issues:** Misclassified workers can sue for benefits like overtime pay or workers’ compensation.
* **Payroll Tax Problems:** Businesses must withhold taxes for employees but not for independent contractors. Confusing the two can lead to payroll tax miscalculations.

**How to Avoid It**

·         Use Tax Authorities guidelines (the ""right to control"" test) to classify workers correctly.

·         If unsure, consult a bookkeeper or accountant before hiring.

·         Ensure contracts specify worker classification to avoid misunderstandings.

**Illustration:** A marketing consultant works 30 hours a week exclusively for your company. Even though you classify them as an independent contractor, the Tax Authorities might say they’re actually an employee—leading to back taxes and penalties.

**5. Not Preparing for Taxes Year-Round**

**The Mistake**

Many business owners wait until tax season to think about taxes, scrambling to find deductions and organize records at the last minute.

**Why It’s Costly**

* **Missed Deductions:** Poor record-keeping can result in lost tax savings.
* **Hefty Tax Bills:** Without proper planning, you might not set aside enough money for taxes, leading to financial strain.
* **Penalties and Interest:** Failing to pay estimated taxes on time can result in Tax Authorities penalties.

**How to Avoid It**

·         Keep track of deductible expenses throughout the year instead of rushing in April.

·         Set aside a percentage of profits (e.g., 25-30%) in a separate tax savings account.

·         Work with a bookkeeper or tax professional for quarterly tax planning.

**Illustration:** You run a successful online store and make $100,000 in profits. You forget to set aside money for taxes, and when tax season arrives, you owe $25,000—causing a financial crisis.

**Final Thoughts: Stay on Top of Your Books & Save Thousands**

Small bookkeeping mistakes can add up quickly, costing your business thousands of dollars in lost deductions, Tax Authorities penalties, and financial mismanagement. But by avoiding these common errors, you can protect your profits and ensure your business remains financially strong.

1je4f5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/SmartBizBooks/comments/1je4f5u/the_1_reason_small_businesses_fail_and_how_to/,The #1 Reason Small Businesses Fail (And How to Prevent It),"Starting a small business is exciting. You have a great idea, a passion for what you do, and a vision of success. But here’s the harsh truth—most small businesses don’t make it past the first few years. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 20% of small businesses fail within the first year, and 50% don’t survive past five years.

Why?

Some might say it’s poor marketing, tough competition, or even bad luck. But if you dig deeper, there’s one major reason most small businesses fail.

**The #1 reason? Poor cash flow management.**

It’s not necessarily that businesses aren’t profitable—it’s that they run out of cash before they can grow or adjust to challenges. The good news? This is preventable.

Let’s look into what poor cash flow really means, why it’s so dangerous, and, most importantly, how to keep your business financially strong.

**What Exactly Is Cash Flow (And Why Does It Matter)?**

Cash flow is simply the money coming in and going out of your business.

* Positive cash flow means you have more money coming in (from sales, investments, etc.) than going out (for rent, payroll, inventory, etc.).
* Negative cash flow means you’re spending more than you’re earning—a dangerous situation that can put you out of business fast.

Many business owners focus too much on revenue (how much they’re selling) and not enough on cash flow (when they actually receive money). You can have a million dollars in sales but still run out of cash if customers don’t pay on time or expenses pile up too quickly.

**Why Poor Cash Flow Is the Silent Business Killer**

Here’s how a cash flow problem can sneak up on you:

·         You land a huge client and invest in more inventory. But they don’t pay for 90 days. Meanwhile, you still have rent, payroll, and supplier bills to cover.

·         You expand too quickly, opening a second location before the first is financially stable. Suddenly, you’re juggling twice the expenses without steady revenue.

·         You rely too much on credit, racking up debt without a clear repayment plan. Before you know it, interest payments eat into your profits.

Even profitable businesses can fail if they don’t manage cash flow properly. If you don’t have enough cash on hand to cover day-to-day expenses, you’ll struggle to keep up—even if sales look great on paper.

**How to Keep Your Business Cash Flow Healthy (And Avoid Failure)**

Now that we know the biggest reason businesses fail, let’s talk about how to protect your business and stay financially strong.

**1. Forecast Your Cash Flow Like Your Business Depends on It (Because It Does)**

A cash flow forecast is your early warning system. It helps you predict when money will come in and go out, so you’re never caught off guard.

***How to do it:***

* Create a simple spreadsheet (or use software like QuickBooks) that tracks expected income and expenses for the next 3-6 months.
* Be conservative—assume some customers will pay late and some unexpected costs will pop up.
* Review and update it weekly.

*Example:* A coffee shop owner notices that summer sales drop every year. By forecasting cash flow, they can set aside extra money during peak seasons to cover slow months.

**2. Get Paid Faster (Because Waiting 60+ Days for Payment Can Kill Your Business)**

One of the biggest reasons small businesses run out of cash? Late-paying customers. If you’re waiting 60 or 90 days to get paid but still have bills due, you’re in trouble.

*How to fix it:*

* Set clear payment terms upfront (e.g., “Net 15” instead of “Net 30” or longer).
* Offer early payment discounts to encourage faster payments.
* Use automated invoicing with reminders. Many accounting software options can handle this for you.
* Charge late fees if customers don’t pay on time.

*Example:* A freelance graphic designer used to wait months for client payments. By switching to 50% upfront deposits and automated invoicing, cash flow improved dramatically.

**3. Cut Unnecessary Expenses (Without Hurting Your Business)**

If you’re struggling with cash flow, look at where your money is going. Many small businesses waste money on things they don’t actually need.

How to cut costs smartly:

* Audit your subscriptions—are you paying for software or tools you don’t use?
* Negotiate better vendor rates—suppliers may offer discounts for bulk purchases or early payments.
* Outsource strategically—hiring freelancers instead of full-time employees for certain tasks can save a lot.

*Example:* A small marketing agency was paying $500/month for premium office space they didn’t really need. By switching to a coworking space, they saved $6,000 per year.

**4. Build a Cash Reserve (Because Emergencies Happen)**

Unexpected expenses—like equipment breakdowns, slow sales months, or economic downturns—can put you out of business if you’re not prepared.

How to create an emergency fund:

* Aim to save at least 3-6 months’ worth of expenses in a separate business savings account.
* Set aside a small percentage of profits every month.
* If you have a big sales month, don’t spend it all—save some for leaner times.

*Example:* A boutique clothing store faced an unexpected rent increase. Thanks to their cash reserve, they could afford the jump without going into debt.

**5. Don’t Expand Too Quickly (Unless Your Cash Flow Supports It)**

Growing too fast is one of the biggest mistakes small businesses make. Opening a new location, hiring more employees, or launching a new product before you have steady cash flow can backfire.

How to grow the right way:

* Expand only when you have at least 6-12 months of steady, positive cash flow.
* Test new markets before committing big money.
* Have a financial cushion so you’re not relying 100% on projected future income.

*Example:* A restaurant owner was tempted to open a second location right away but waited a year to build up cash reserves. When they finally expanded, they had enough cash to cover expenses for six months, reducing financial stress.

**Final Thoughts: Cash Flow Is the Key to Long-Term Success**

Most small businesses don’t fail because they’re bad ideas or because the owner isn’t working hard. They fail because they run out of cash.

By forecasting cash flow, speeding up payments, cutting unnecessary expenses, and building an emergency fund, you can avoid this trap and keep your business financially strong.

1je4e7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1je4e7u/how_to_build_an_email_list_that_converts/,How to Build an Email List That Converts,"Alright, let’s dive into the delightful world of email list building—a little like tending to a garden, but instead of daisies, you’re growing a community of eager customers. Now, growing and nurturing your email list isn't just about the numbers; it’s about building relationships and providing value. If you’re ready, grab a cup of coffee (or tea, if that’s your thing), and let’s get into some strategies that might just transform that email list from crickets to a vibrant community.

1. **Create Irresistible Lead Magnets**: Imagine someone walking into a bakery, and instead of just a plain ol' muffin, they see a mouthwatering free sample. That's what a lead magnet should feel like! Offer something your audience can’t refuse—think e-books, cheat sheets, or exclusive content. Make it irresistible. If it’s as enticing as the last slice of pizza at a party, you’re golden!

2. **Utilize Sign-up Forms Everywhere**: Picture your email sign-up like confetti—scatter it everywhere! Seriously, place forms on your website, blog, and social media. But don't just plop them down like random decorations at a party. Make sure they are eye-catching and contextual. After all, if someone’s just read a heartfelt story about your journey, they might be more willing to sign up and join you on this adventure.

3. **Leverage Social Proof**: Here’s a little secret—people love a good testimonial. Featuring reviews or success stories can give your subscribers a peek into the community they’re about to join. Make them feel like they’re stepping into a club where everyone’s having a great time, sharing their wins and supporting each other—a bit like that infamous after-party where all the best stories come out.

4. **Craft Compelling Content**: Content is king, but engagement is queen, and that court has to be in your favor! Send out newsletters filled with valuable insights, personal anecdotes, and, yes, maybe a bit of your signature humor. Share stories that make people feel seen and understood. When your subscribers find value in what you send, they’ll be itching to engage and, ultimately, buy.

5. **Consistency is Key**: You don’t want to be that friend who ghosts everyone for months, right? Stick to a reliable cadence, whether it's weekly, biweekly, or monthly. Consistency builds trust and keeps your audience eager to see what you’ll come up with next. Just like that television show you wait for every week, your emails should have that same anticipation.

6. **Segment Your Audience**: Not everyone’s going to be interested in the same things. Some folks might be chasing discounts, while others want the inside scoop on your latest project. Segment your audience based on their interests and behaviors, so you can tailor your messages like a customized playlist instead of a one-size-fits-all mixtape.

7. **Encourage Engagement**: Ask questions, run polls, or invite subscribers to share their thoughts. When you invite participation, it’s like opening the door to your home and saying, ""Come on in, pull up a chair!"" Making them feel part of the conversation fosters community and, dare I say, loyalty.

8. **Analyze and Adapt**: Lastly, keep your eyes peeled. Use analytics to see what’s working and what isn’t. If a particular subject line gets more clicks than a sale at a gadget store, take note! Continuous improvement is part of the journey, just like figuring out how to make that perfect batch of cookies—it might take a few tries, but eventually, you’ll have your secret recipe.

So, as you venture into the world of email list building, remember it’s not just about adding names to a list. It’s about cultivating a community, engaging in meaningful conversations, and walking alongside your audience on their journey. And who knows? With a little love and strategy, your email list might just become the highlight of your relationship with your customers. Happy nurturing!",1,1742302887.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

1je49pn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon_Training/comments/1je49pn/half_marathon_race_report_now_onto_my_hardest/,Half Marathon Race Report - now onto my hardest challenge: my first marathon.,"Hey guys, just wanted to share my race after what was and unforgettable pre race week and not for some fun reasons! Let me explain.

Race Information

* **Name:** Media Maraton Villa Carlos Paz * **Date:** MARCH 16, 2025 * **Distance:** Half Marathon * **Location:** Cordoba - Argentina. *** Shoe for the race: New Balance SC Elite V4 (first race using carbon plated shoes)

About me: started running in 2021, at 41 YO, now I am 45 YO, running 4 times a week and going to the gym the other three days.

Goals

I was aiming at around 1:46:00 time, with a pace around 5:00 per KM.

Training

Subscribed to Runna for this one. Been hearing  a lot of good things about the app, and since, because of my schedule, I train alone and very early in the morning (I run 4 times a week and 3 days I lift at the gym), the app helped my with structuring my plan, between easy runs and speed sessions and it pushed me hard! It was a challenge for sure, but it was a lot of fun and made me feel stronger than ever as training progressed. It was a 12 week training plan.

The Unexpected

As I've said, training was going awesome and the hype for the race was at peak level. This is a race that I wasn't able to run last year because I was dealing with peroneal problems that had me off running for almost 6 months.

Thing is, ten days before the race, while at the gym, I decided to not to a hard leg session that day because I wanted to start deloading the legs to be well rested for the race. Stupidly I decided to make 3 series of jump box excercise. At the last rep of the last series, I stumbled while jumping, and bang my tibia with the box HARD! It instantly swelled and blood was coming out! I thought it was the bang, so I went home and put ice on it. The thing is the bang left a scar (it was a hard hit) and that scar, once it healed, would stop more blood from coming out of the injury, so two days before, the area was incredibly swollen and it made a hematoma. I have a friend who is a doctor, and he gave me a corticosteroid injection to see if it would get better but nothing, so the decision was made to make a cut into the wound to take the coagulated blood out of there. That was last tuesday, so 5 days before the race. When I got out, and for the next three days I was having a hard time even trying to walk, so I saw myself almost 100% out of the race. I was borderline depressed after all the training I went trough.

Since the race is around 50 km away from where I live, we reserved to have a four day holiday with the family, so we had to go anyway. You can imagine my mood. Having to come and having planned the holiday around the race. But the foot started to get better on saturday, I mean, the wound was giving me a lot of pain since it hasn't healed properly yet, but i was able to walk with little pain, so I asked my friend if I could run. He said to me to try runnning 3 o 4 km the day before and see how it responded. The fear was that I get a hematoma again. Went ofr it and had no pain while running.

The day of the race was key to see how I woke uo, and if there was no blood or the area was swollen I had a green light. Woke up that day and, MIRACULOUSLY it was ok. The happiness I had was hard to explain. I was able to at least try to run the race, which two days before it was impossible for me to even think of being able to run.

Pre-race

Woke up at 5:00. Cured the wound, and prepared for the race. Breakfast was at 5:30, and i had a coffee with two toast with some butter on them. Drank half a Gatorade before leaving and had a nougat 20 minutes before the start.

Race

In training, the targeted pace was 5:00 per km (8 minutes and 3 per mile), but since I wasn't able to run  at all last week, and taking into account that i had no idea how my leg was going to respond at the race, the fact that I was there at the start just made me soooo happy!

Weather was great, it wasn't cold but neither hot. Started the race and gradually tried to get the pace that I've trained for, and was feeling great! No pain whatsoever. So i was able to mantain it and even get a little faster on the second half. Course had some hills on it, so it's not an easy route, but I was feeling great and couldn't stop thinking about how lucky I was to even be there running. Last meters I had a terrible cramp on my left leg, but I endured and finished strong with a time of 1:43:31 according to my watch. Official time could be a little less.

Nutrition wise I had two caffeinated gels, one 6 km in, and the other 12 km in, I had a third one ready but decided to skip and instead ate a banana that was given to me at around 15k.

Running is a privilege, and I always feel that way, but never more clear after the incredible journey leading up to this race!

Post-race

Family was waiting at the finish line (wife and two kids, 8 and 4), and I saw them twice during the course, so it was very emotional. I cried like a baby once I crossed the finish line and even more when I saw them after finishing.

So this was and unbelievable race for me, taught me a lesson to be even more grateful to being able to do this at this age, and the privilege I have of being healthy. And also, so proud of me that even with all the setbacks of the injury, I never in my mind gave up, and was able to endure it all and be there at the start.

Thank you for reading, this ended up being a long race report and sorry for the grammar, I am from Argentina so english is not my first language!

KEEP RUNNING!!!!!

Super long post so ill summarize here.
Started hrt. Didn’t see the wall of emotions, depression, doubt, sadness that is hitting me.  I love to cry btw but wow.. the depression part is very intense more than ever.

From reading(reddit posts)/ youtubing (thx dr z.) apparently this is caused by the initial hits of female hormones as my brain adjusts /  Transitions to female. These random bouts get better in time right?

————


Long version. 
Im on week 2 of hrt injections. And I love the fact that my journey has started. And i love it But…..I am having really strong spikes of depression.  

This morning i woke up thinking i cant do this. Sadness / depression  has also punched me in the face mid day. This has happened both weeks about 1-2 days after doing my injections. The depression is a feeling of sadness, loss, failure, that im gonna grow old and be a mess and alone and no sex ever again…and when I’m old old.. my old frail lady self consequently will be a burden for my son and their quality of life will also be impacted.  I don’t wish to be a burden on anyone especially my son. 

Wow….. just a lot… once i wake up, get some coffee, listen to dr Z  on youtube it subsides or if i give it time/ ride through it,  get exercise i start feeling better. 

But wow… its intense feelings.

Reading about  hrt i realized the estrogen is making me WAY more emotional AND consequently bringing bouts of strong depression.  Im also reading later it gies away. So ok maybe this us just normal as i transition physically.  

This negative experience is in turn stirring my fears and doubts that I’m not doing the right thing for me.

The depression consists of fear. To old,, failure, loss, aloneness, loss of time, expense of $$, of my life being ruined / made worse. That i should have just STFU about my inner desires. That I’ve earned another FAFO(f around find out) patch. 

So… do i hold the course let hrt work Or abort  now? Detransition?  It’s a fork in road i didn’t know was there till I hit it. I honestly thought i had already answered that question prior ton starting HRT. Sigh. 

I hear/read the depression gets better once body normalizes on estrogen and ive read that MANY. transitioning people hit this wall. Its something i just didnt see coming.  Im not sure how to deal w this feeling atm other than to share my question and experience here.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When choosing a portable power station for overlanding, there are several key features to consider to ensure you have reliable and efficient power on the go. Here’s a comprehensive guide to help you make an informed decision:

**Capacity:** One of the most crucial factors is the capacity of the power station. Measured in watt-hours (Wh) or ampere-hours (Ah), this determines how much power the station can store. For overlanding, aim for a capacity of at least 100Wh to 300Wh, depending on your needs. If you plan to run multiple high-power devices like laptops, cameras, or small appliances, opt for a higher capacity model, ideally above 500Wh.

- **Power Outputs:** Look for a variety of power outputs such as USB-A, USB-C, AC outlets, and DC ports. This ensures compatibility with different devices. USB-C ports are particularly useful for charging newer smartphones and laptops quickly. AC outlets are essential for larger devices like CPAP machines or small appliances. DC ports can be handy for connecting directly to your vehicle's battery.
- **Charging Time:** Fast charging capabilities are a significant advantage. Most portable power stations come with built-in solar charge capability, but the speed and efficiency can vary. Look for models that offer quick charging via AC adapters or car chargers. Solar panels can also be a great addition, especially if you plan extended trips without access to electricity.

**Battery Type:** Lithium-ion batteries are the most common type used in portable power stations due to their high energy density and longer lifespan compared to lead-acid batteries. However, lithium-ion batteries can be more expensive. Some models use lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and slimmer but may cost more. It's essential to balance cost with performance and durability.

- **Weight and Size:** Portability is key for overlanding. Opt for a power station that strikes a balance between capacity and portability. A compact design that’s easy to carry and fits snugly in your vehicle is ideal. Lightweight models under 10 pounds are preferable for backpacking or hiking.
- **Durability:** Overlanding often involves rugged conditions, so choose a power station that is durable and weather-resistant. Look for models with robust casings made from impact-resistant materials like polycarbonate. Water-resistant designs are also beneficial, especially if you plan to use the station in wet or dusty environments.

**Brand Reputation:** Research the brand’s reputation and customer reviews. Established brands tend to offer better build quality, reliability, and after-sales support. Check online forums and social media for user experiences and feedback. Brands like Goal Zero, Jackery, and Rockpals are known for their quality and durability.

- **Additional Features:** Some power stations come with additional features like built-in LED lights, LCD displays for monitoring battery levels, and smart power management systems. These can be invaluable during off-grid adventures. For instance, an integrated flashlight can be useful in emergencies or when setting up camp at night.
- **Safety Features:** Safety is paramount when dealing with electrical devices. Look for power stations with built-in safety mechanisms like overcharge protection, short-circuit protection, and thermal regulation. These features prevent damage to both the device and your connected gadgets.

**Price:** While budget is always a consideration, remember that investing in a high-quality portable power station is worthwhile for long-term reliability and peace of mind. Prices can range from $100 to over $1000, depending on the capacity and features. Determine your budget and prioritize the features that matter most to you.

​ Shop here &gt;https://www.portablepower101.com  
**Compatibility:** ensure the power station is compatible with your devices. Check the voltage and amperage requirements of your gear to avoid damaging them. Many power stations now offer universal adaptors or come with a range of cables and adapters, making them versatile for various devices.

By considering these key features, you can select a portable power station that meets your overlanding needs, providing reliable power wherever your adventures take you. Whether you’re camping in remote areas or traveling through rugged terrains, having the right power station can make all the difference in your journey.

Real-World Testing: Top Portable Power Stations During Five Overlanding Expeditions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overlanding enthusiasts know that reliable power is crucial when venturing off the beaten path. Portable power stations have become indispensable tools for keeping electronics charged, powering lights, and even running small appliances. To help you choose the best portable power station for your next overlanding adventure, we tested five different models across five distinct expeditions. Here’s a detailed look at how each performed under real-world conditions.

**1. Goal Zero Yeti 1000XL**

The Goal Zero Yeti 1000XL was our first choice for a comprehensive power solution. With a massive 1000 watt-hour capacity, it easily powered our camping gear, including a mini-fridge, LED lights, and multiple smartphones. It features multiple charging ports, including USB-A, USB-C, and AC outlets, making it versatile for various devices. On our first expedition through rugged mountain terrain, the Yeti 1000XL handled the cold weather with ease, maintaining its performance throughout the trip. However, its weight and size made it less convenient for more agile setups.

**2. Jackery Explorer 1000**

The Jackery Explorer 1000 is a lighter and more portable option, weighing in at just 22 pounds. Despite its smaller size, it still boasts a 1002Wh capacity, which was sufficient for our needs on a desert expedition. It offers six different charging ports, including three USB-A ports, one USB-C port, one AC outlet, and two DC ports. Its sleek design made it easy to transport and set up. The battery held up well during the day's heat and night's chill, though we noticed a slight decrease in efficiency in extreme temperatures.

- Capacity: 1002Wh
- Ports: USB-A, USB-C, AC outlet, DC ports
- Weight: 22 lbs

**3. Rockpals 500W**

For a mid-range option, we tested the Rockpals 500W. This model has a capacity of 500Wh and comes with a variety of ports, including four USB-A ports, one USB-C port, and one AC outlet. Its compact size and lightweight design (only 13.2 lbs) made it ideal for backpacking. During our third expedition, which involved dense forest trekking, the Rockpals 500W proved to be a reliable companion. However, its lower capacity meant it needed recharging more frequently compared to the larger units.

**4. Anker Powerhouse II 200**

The Anker Powerhouse II 200 offered a smaller capacity of 200Wh, making it perfect for those looking for a lightweight, compact solution. We used it primarily for charging smaller devices like smartphones and action cameras on our fourth expedition, which took us through steep canyons. Despite its limited capacity, it performed admirably and was easy to carry around. The drawback was its lack of versatility in powering larger devices, which might be a limitation for extended trips.

- Capacity: 200Wh
- Ports: USB-A, USB-C, AC outlet
- Weight: 4.8 lbs

**5. Bluetti AC200P**

We tested the Bluetti AC200P, a high-capacity model with a 2000Wh battery. This powerhouse offers 1700 watts of continuous power and 3500 watts of surge power, making it capable of handling even large appliances like a microwave or a coffee maker. On our fifth expedition, a coastal journey, the AC200P provided ample power for all our needs. Its robust build and multiple charging options made it a standout performer. However, its significant weight (60.5 lbs) and bulkiness were trade-offs that might limit its suitability for more agile travel setups.

1je3ymn,https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/1je3ymn/reluctantly_turning_to_dating_apps_for_connections/,Reluctantly Turning to Dating Apps For Connections,"I believe this may be some poor accountability, and it doesn't sit well with me that I feel like I need to look into dating at under 6 months since my LW passed. However, my only alternative is to sit in an empty home from 5:00 pm on Friday until 5:00 am when it's time to head back to work. I can almost do it without bothering to turn on any devices. 

I'd been alone in most social aspects for the last 10+ years outside of my great relationship with my LW. It took some time but I eventually grew to be 100% content with doing everything with my LW. 

Since my family is essentially nonexistent, I feel like I need to at least get started with getting some human being in my circle. My personal worries/concerns of potential problems as a completely single person are myriad. The first few days after my LW passed I was highly worried I didn't lock the front door leaving out for work, the stove and/or coffee machine were still on, the TV was left on... I had to drive around the roundabout behind my house 2 times to double back and make sure I hadn't left the garage door up. I understand I had some brain fog going on, but simple random shit just had me shook. I left out - along with 0 kids and no pets, I don't really engage with very many of my neighbors. 

I'll get to the point... yesterday my old HS girlfriend texted me that she doesn't do any dating, and doesn't really hook up with anybody, because she's been in ""a routine so long   that she just doesn't think about any *needs*."" 

The light bulb went off for me as to at least one major hindrance to why I haven't even been able to get a single decent conversation going on a dating app I broke down and gave a chance. I feel like the women in my age group are probably also caught up in routines, and while they have profiles on a dating app, they're not really eager to break their routines to engage in the activity required to start a relationship. To their credit, maybe they've taken a few shots on new connections, and they've proven to be wastes of time regarding breaking their routines. 

I can't even get mad at the players, it's just really a pretty shitty game at the moment. I'd gleaned this from the sidelines before my new marital status forced me to consider the need to get back out here. Fortunately, I'm growing incrementally with my own sense of independence with each week. But, it would be great to have a real conversation besides my one depression-affected HS buddy who sends me texts daily about his next get rich scheme OR his ""new"" review on some fucking album from the late-80s to mid-90s... my new focus is shifting to just putting together my own *new routine*.

Then he said, “Like how I like my girls.” I jokingly replied, “You’re only allowed to like one.” Just lighthearted stuff. Then he goes, “No, I can like many and love one.” I was a bit confused and was like, “Huh? Can you actually like many?” And he just said, “Yes.”

At first, I thought he meant emotionally, which threw me off, but he was actually talking about it in a sexual way. He started explaining how men think about sex all the time and that’s just how they are. He was saying he likes this and that, and I kinda just took it to heart. To me, thinking about sleeping with other women is bad, but he said it only matters if he actually does it, he reassured me that he’s loyal and would never do anything.

Then somehow, it turned into a thing about my insecurity. He brought up how I “watch men every day” because I watch MMA, basically comparing it to what he was saying. I mentioned earlier that he watches too much porn, and he threw in the whole “half-naked men” thing, which was just silly because, like… it’s a sport??? Things escalated, but we kinda made up.

In the end, I told him what hurt my feelings and that he could say things a bit nicer (this was about other things too). He apologized but also said he doesn’t like being doubted or our relationship being questioned. He asked me not to be unsure all the time because if he’s here, it’s because he wants to be—and that should mean something.

Now it’s a ”new day” but I somehow think about it. I know men have desires, not saying women don’t. I personally am bit different and barely have liked one person in my life. Also I don’t have any experince regarding dating prior to this. Do men really think think about sex a lot and if they see women, they think about sleeping with them without any romantic feelings? Like a nice body and so on. I’m not sure what I’m trying to get from posting this? I guess the way it was delivered, affected me? Maybe I’m trying to clear my mind.

I take care of all of our household chores and do a majority of the cooking. My husband's main job (outdoor) is flexible, so he can work whenever, as long as the work gets done. Therefore the pay is terrible. He works 3 other (manual labor) side jobs throughout the week. He doesn't work on Sundays. He works from 7 to 3, four days a week. 7 to 5, one day a week, and 7 to 1 on most Saturdays. I work remotely a few nights a week for a couple hours when he gets home. I work from 3 to 5 and then cook dinner. This is how we're able to afford for me to stay home.

My husband wakes up at 6 most mornings. Sundays I let him sleep as long as he wants. (Usually 9am.) I know manual labor is hard and I'm thankful for him. But if I don't get up at 6am with him (maybe twice a week I don't get up with him but I rarely sleep past 7), he tells me to get out of bed before he leaves and tells me I'm being lazy and that if he wouldn't have woken me up, I wouldn't have got up until our son woke me up. He says I need to be doing things around the house, not sleeping. He will question when the last time I worked out was. He wants me to do these things for me, to make myself better. But it doesn't always feel that way.

I understand his POV completely. But I take care of any night wakings my son has. I usually only have to go in his room maybe once a week to put him back to sleep which lately means an hour or two of rocking. (My husband will let me sleep if I tell him this.) Several nights a week he has what I think are night terrors. I don't usually go in there, but the screaming wakes me up, I turn the volume off the monitor so it doesn't wake my husband, and I watch to make sure our son doesn't cry for longer than a couple minutes. (If I go in there it actually wakes him up and then he's up for two hours.) Last night, my son did this 4 different times. Each time I'm awake for 10 or more minutes before I'm able to fall back to sleep.

My husband just thinks I'm lazy and that I suck at taking care of our home. I wish he understood that keeping the house spotless with a toddler and 2 shedding animals is difficult. When I take care of our son I have to attempt to do chores, when he watches our son, he gets to play the whole time. I have a calendar where I write down chores I've done each day so I can keep up. There's been twice where he's done a big chore of some kind and then I have to hear how easy it was for him to do even though he was taking care of our son. He takes good care our son. He'll play with him while I cook most of the time. But after dinner he will lay on the couch while I finish feeding our son and look at his phone. He'll run the bath when I ask, then get back on the couch until I call for him and we do bedtime together. He will read a book while I clean up the living room. Then I get our son to sleep while he gets back on the couch or plays video games. It's usually 20 to 45 minutes until I am out of my son's room. I then have to clean the kitchen and make my husband's lunch and coffee. It's 9pm by that time. It's normally 11 before I get in bed. He says I'm just slow, that I could get everything done much quicker if I was faster.

This is already too long, so I won't go into detail of what I do every day. But am I overreacting? I know he works hard but is it unreasonable for me to sleep til 7 some days?

I warmed up with 3 sets of 8 bodyweight squats

Goblet squats with a 5kg dumbell 4x10-12

Lunges with 5kg dumbells 3x8-10

Hamstring curls 4x25

standing calf raises with 16kg barbell 4x20

Glute bridges 4x12-15

  
I don't want to burn out, I don't feel like I will but today reminded me why I have so many times in the past. Why is this? I got a good amount of sleep last night, I've been having protein shakes everyday since sunday and I'm doing the work. Yet I feel like shit and tired right now. Tomorrow I'll go for a walk in the park to clear my head or something. I want it this time. ",4,1742300498.0,workout,38,1.0,False

I’m scared that this will lead to me falling off. 

I don’t have sugary drinks (I can count the times I wanted to try a new coffee drink that had sugar in it on one hand within the past 2-3 months), no fried foods, stick to complex carb snacks/breads.

Ik he didn’t care or respect me enough but ig I just miss the potential because of the connection and shared values 

This is gonna be long af and ain’t nobody gonna read it 😂 but I just need to rant cuz ik my friends r sick of this man LMFAO. Was exclusive with and seeing this guy (let’s call him John) for around 8 weeks. Midway through at around the month mark, John lied (and triple downed) on the fact that a group picture with a picture of his ex on his IG wasn’t his ex. I knew he was lying and the next day his friend/co-worker dmed me (supposedly without being asked to) telling me reasons I should give him another chance. I was over it tho and went to his friends place to pick up something that I owned when John was waiting there (cancelled his work meetings for the day) and was basically asking for a 2nd chance, was super apologetic, and even started crying near the end of the long ass 6+ hour conversation. I ended up giving him a 2nd chance cuz I genuinely really did like him. Normally I would never have even entertained the idea but I felt such a good connection and loved the similarities that we shared in terms of ethnicity, religious beliefs, general values and what not. I really was willing to move past it, but I think it brought back that he wasn’t over his ex (who lives in a diff country now) or maybe he just wasn’t into me. The last 2 weeks he started pulling back slowly (I’m talking communication becoming complete ass like not calling me anymore, pulling back completely in terms of affection, wanting to hang out for shorter amounts of time) which honestly is genuinely the shittest feeling that I wouldn’t wish upon anyone but I’m an over thinker so I didn’t know if it was just in my head. I communicated this on occasions because I’d rather just know if someone was over it because that’s just a part of life. But he would reassure me and say it had nothing to do with me and would act so confused that I would even think that he was pulling back or over us. This literally caused so much confusion and stress as it felt like a complete 180, but whenever I tried to communicate he would just deny it which hurt way more than just telling me off the bat because I didn’t know what to make of it. 

The last time we hung out was last Monday and I honestly couldn’t handle it anymore, it felt like he wanted me to be the one to end things so he wouldn’t be the “bad guy” idek. He told me again that it was just family stuff and that it was his priority and it wasn’t about me. He made it sound so so bad like it was something he couldn’t say (found out that it was a disagreement with his parents about his dog, which yes sucks, but not an excuse to pull away and is not hard to communicate). I liked this guy so much that I would have taken his dog in for him if he had nowhere to go 🥴 I couldn’t handle the way he was making me spiral with the complete switch up but denial of the fact, so I reached out to the same friend the next day. I figured he’d probably lie but that I’d be able to tell where John’s mind was at based on how his friend words what he says. However, I was surprised that his friend was honestly kind and gave me really good advice and basically told me to take a step back and put myself first. So honestly the convo with his friend gave me the push I needed to send John a text which I knew would make him finally end it even though I didn’t want that myself. His friend even showed me that John said “def the best girl I’ve been with by a longggg shot” right before he ended things which just hurt more cuz how could u think that, yet that’s not enough for you to make things work. Even worse, he didn’t even care to talk when I got something of mine, just tossed it in the car and said take care without glancing at me - honestly just made me feel like I was wasting his time. I ended up texting him two days later (oops) saying that it was a lot in the moment and that I’d like to take him up on his offer to meet up one last time over coffee to have things end amicably, but it was almost 5 hours at that point without a response when I know he saw it so even tho he might have answered later that day I knew he didn’t want to do it and honestly he’d prob have nothing new to say anyways. His friend did tell me “Well I mean you’re a free girl now 😭😭😭😭 block him 🤣 move on I know when u decide to do so you’ll find someone who appreciates you” so I decided to do just that for my sanity and block his # cuz I have no idea if he would have just ignored my text or what not and it was clear he didn’t care for or have any respect for me anyways like I know he clearly was just not that into me but ig I’m just missing the potential of what he could have been like 🙃",1,1742300253.0,rant,1,1.0,False

I ended up giving him a 2nd chance cuz I genuinely really did like him. Normally I would never have even entertained the idea but I felt such a good connection and loved the similarities that we shared in terms of ethnicity, religious beliefs, general values and what not. I really was willing to move past it, but I think it brought back that he wasn’t over his ex (who lives in a diff country now) or maybe he just wasn’t into me. The last 2 weeks he started pulling back slowly (I’m talking communication becoming complete ass like not calling me anymore, pulling back completely in terms of affection, wanting to hang out for shorter amounts of time) which honestly is genuinely the shittest feeling that I wouldn’t wish upon anyone but I’m an over thinker so I didn’t know if it was just in my head. I communicated this on occasions because I’d rather just know if someone was over it because that’s just a part of life. But he would reassure me and say it had nothing to do with me and would act so confused that I would even think that he was pulling back or over us. This literally caused so much confusion and stress as it felt like a complete 180, but whenever I tried to communicate he would just deny it which hurt way more than just telling me off the bat because I didn’t know what to make of it. 

The last time we hung out was last Monday and I honestly couldn’t handle it anymore, it felt like he wanted me to be the one to end things so he wouldn’t be the “bad guy” idek. He told me again that it was just family stuff and that it was his priority and it wasn’t about me. He made it sound so so bad like it was something he couldn’t say (found out that it was a disagreement with his parents about his dog, which yes sucks, but not an excuse to pull away and is not hard to communicate). I liked this guy so much that I would have taken his dog in for him if he had nowhere to go 🥴 I couldn’t handle the way he was making me spiral with the complete switch up but denial of the fact, so I reached out to the same friend the next day. I figured he’d probably lie but that I’d be able to tell where John’s mind was at based on how his friend words what he says. However, I was surprised that his friend was honestly kind and gave me really good advice and basically told me to take a step back and put myself first. So honestly the convo with his friend gave me the push I needed to send John a text which I knew would make him finally end it even though I didn’t want that myself. His friend even showed me that John said “def the best girl I’ve been with by a longggg shot” right before he ended things which just hurt more cuz how could u think that, yet that’s not enough for you to make things work. Even worse, he didn’t even care to talk when I got something of mine, just tossed it in the car and said take care without glancing at me - honestly just made me feel like I was wasting his time. I ended up texting him two days later (oops) saying that it was a lot in the moment and that I’d like to take him up on his offer to meet up one last time over coffee to have things end amicably, but it was almost 5 hours at that point without a response when I know he saw it so even tho he might have answered later that day I knew he didn’t want to do it and honestly he’d prob have nothing new to say anyways. His friend did tell me “Well I mean you’re a free girl now 😭😭😭😭 block him 🤣 move on I know when u decide to do so you’ll find someone who appreciates you” so I decided to do just that for my sanity and block his # cuz I have no idea if he would have just ignored my text or what not and it was clear he didn’t care for or have any respect for me anyways like I know he clearly was just not that into me but ig I’m just missing the potential of what he could have been like 🙃",1,1742300115.0,Vent,0,1.0,False

The first thing I noticed was having to use the restroom multiple times each morning.  

This became an issue for me because I've had a regular running schedule the past 10+ years. I get up, drink a couple pints of water, drink a coffee, use the restroom and then head out to run 3-5+ miles.  

I can use the restroom and feel ready to go, but it never fails, 1 mile or so into my run, I have to head back home to use the restroom again.  

I obviously eat a lot of fiber, I drink a lot of water. I'll have something light for breakfast or sometimes skip it.  I consistently eat lunch and dinner and never really eat past 6pm.  

Weekends I don't mind, I have an extra cup of coffee and wait out the second bathroom break.  Work days I'm on a schedule and just have to build in time to circle back to my house to use the restroom. 

Is there any way to better control the double bathroom breaks?   My preference would be one and done! ",1,1742300046.0,PlantBasedDiet,12,0.6,False

Been buying specialty cofffee but getting it ground at the coffee house. I want to start grinding my own coffee and making espresso.

The machine I've settled on is the Delonghi Dedica. Seems like a good beginner option with a few upgreades and goes for very cheap where I'm from.

The three grinders I am considering are Eureka Mignon Manuale, 1zpresso X-Ultra and Kingrinder K6.

Manual - obvously price is a big factor here, from what I read I can't get a good quality electric grinder for the price. The K6 goes for 100**€** around here and the X-ultra is about 140**€**. I've never used a manual grinder and I suspect that once the novelty wears off, I might get tired of manually grinding after a while.

What I was wondering about is the quality compared to a budget electric grinder - are the two manual grinders I've mentioned better than the Eureka for example in terms of the ground coffee they produce?

Between the two manual grinders, I've seen some complaints about misalignment with the K6 and 1zpresso having better build quality, so I'm leaning towards the X-ultra. Any input?

As far as electric goes, the Manuale seems like the best espresso-capable grinder in the price range \~250**€** where I'm from. I've read they have good build quality. Other suggestions are appreciated as well.

Budget is there as a reference, but would like to spend as little as possible as I have with roommates who might use the stuff and I don't want to splurge on anything too nice just yet.

TL;DR - First grinder buying advice, do the two manual grinders I've mentioned produce better results than the Manuale?",1,1742300037.0,espresso,1,1.0,False
1je3hwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1je3hwi/food_is_weird_thread/,Food is weird thread,"We all know food is weird in Severance, I wanted to collate a few examples to get a better idea of what's going on - please add your own examples in comments!

- The first episode title, and Petey's catchphrase - who is reintegrated and therefore knows more than most - is ""Whats for dinner, kids?"". In that episode as well, Mark is asked by one of the foodless dinner guests what his take is on the whole ""food vs. life thing""... quite an odd question!

.

- 'foodless dinner' may relate to some kind of societal food scarcity - though no-one at the dinner looks starving... particularly Ricken.... but maybe thats just in Keir / Lumon towns, and they have foodless dinner as a slightly pretentious way of acknowledging other peoples suffering

.

- Gemma's food on the testing floor, in Lumon logo drop shapes. One of them is 'rendered marrow'. As far as I can think, there are no references to eating meat.... possible cattle collapse in outside world (also helly's question 'are we cattle)

.

- Pips bar & grille, we never see what Mark eats. But the name doesn't sound like something meat-y, as pips are what you get in fruit... and we know Pips has a strong connection to Lumon

.

- Pineapples as bribes for the outies, pineapple bobbing, Melon parties.... Interesting focus on tropical fruits as rewards, when its heavy winter outside. Perhaps its creative contrast, perhaps its a show of Lumons power where other global food systems / networks may have broken down. Or perhaps the world has gone into permafrost and only Lumon can grow these things

.

- Helena / Helly eating the boiled egg in very very small bites, again seeming to show some kind of acknowledgement / respect towards food scarcity

.

- Something looks weird about the 'coffees' the Eagans drink, and Cobal doesn't drink the coffee she is poured on her trip, and doesn't drink the water... however Devon's one and attitude towards getting a coffee seems pretty normal

1je3htf,https://www.reddit.com/r/StoryIdeas/comments/1je3htf/the_phone_in_the_lost_and_found/,The phone in the lost and found:,"I work as a lost and found prevention officer at the local library. Most days are pretty mundane—people forget books, jackets, and the occasional coffee cup. But every now and then, something unusual comes through the door.

A couple of weeks ago, I found something that’s stayed with me ever since.

It was a Saturday, and the library had quieted down as usual. I was going through a stack of items left behind in one of the study rooms when I found a phone—a mid-range model, cracked screen, a little worn. It wasn’t unusual to find forgotten tech, but this one had a personal touch. The phone was unlocked, with a simple wallpaper: a picture of a park, with the sun setting in the background, and two people sitting on a bench, their heads leaning close together.

I didn’t mean to snoop, but something about the image stuck with me. So, I scrolled through the photos, thinking it might help me figure out who the phone belonged to.

The first few were typical—shots of sunsets, coffee cups, a dog running through a field—but then I found something else: a series of photos taken in the same park. They weren’t professional or planned—just candid moments of two people laughing, holding hands, and enjoying each other’s company. The more I looked, the more I felt like I was getting a glimpse into their life, their love.

There were photos from vacations, snapshots of small celebrations, and even a silly one where they had clearly been trying to take a selfie, but one of them had blinked. The woman in the photos had a bright, contagious smile, and the man, with messy hair and glasses, had the kind of look that said he was always there for her, no matter what.

It wasn’t until I reached the last few photos that I paused. The last picture was a simple one. It showed the couple holding hands at that same park, but the angle was different this time—it was taken from behind them, as if someone had snapped the photo without them noticing. And it was clear they didn’t see the camera because their faces were turned toward each other, lost in the moment.

I felt a strange tug in my chest. These were people who cared about each other deeply, their lives captured so casually, so beautifully. And yet, here I was, holding their phone, with no way to know who they were or how they’d left it behind.

I could’ve just handed it over to the lost and found, but I felt like I needed to know more. The phone’s call log had a few entries—none recent, but one stood out. It was a missed call, with a name I didn’t recognize, but it was followed by a text message: “I’m here, let’s meet at the park. I miss you.”

It was then that I realized the couple wasn’t just a happy pair—they were probably long-distance, or perhaps one of them had to move away for a while. The photos felt like a window into their love story, and now the phone, sitting here on my desk, felt like a piece of that story.

The next day, I took a chance. I reached out to the number in the text message. I didn’t know what to expect, but I was hoping someone would be able to identify the phone.

To my surprise, the person on the other end of the line didn’t seem confused. Instead, they laughed, a soft sound that seemed to carry a mix of relief and warmth.

“Oh, thank you,” the voice said. “I was starting to think I’d lost it for good. I’ve been looking for that phone everywhere. It’s... important to me.”

I asked if they were the owner or if they knew the couple. It turned out, the voice belonged to the man in the photos. He had left the phone behind by accident during a visit to the library. He told me they’d been together for years but had recently been separated due to work. The phone had all their memories—photos, texts, and even voice memos they’d left for each other when they couldn’t be together.

He thanked me again, and we arranged for him to pick it up. Before he hung up, he added something that made me smile:

“Thank you. You have no idea how much those photos mean to me. They remind me of what I’m working towards. And soon, I’ll be holding her hand again.”

He picked up the phone the next day. We exchanged a few brief words, and he left with a quiet but happy expression on his face.

It was a small thing, really. Just a phone left behind in a library. But for some reason, it stuck with me. Maybe it was the reminder of how simple moments—like a photo of two people laughing together in a park—can carry so much meaning. Or maybe it was just the fact that, in a world full of distractions, I got to play a tiny role in reuniting someone with something precious to them.

I’ll never forget the look on his face when he walked out of that library. It was the look of someone who had found something they thought was lost forever",1,1742300000.0,StoryIdeas,1,1.0,False
