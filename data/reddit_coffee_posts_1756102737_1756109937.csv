Founders here are building unicorns while still finding time for Barton Springs, live shows, and the occasional taco crawl.

The Burnout Problem in Austin Startups

Long days of product development.

Nights filled with investor decks.

Weekends eaten up by customer support.


Even in a city with such creative energy, founder burnout is a silent epidemic.

Why Burnout = Lost Opportunity

Investors, mentors, and teams can all spot it. When founders burn out, decision-making slows, opportunities are missed, and morale collapses.

The Burnout Antidote: Delegation

You don‚Äôt solve burnout with yoga or coffee breaks. You solve it by not doing everything yourself.

That‚Äôs why more Austin founders are using VAConnect:

To reclaim focus on high-value tasks.

To keep investor pipelines moving without draining energy.

To manage customer support so founders can recharge.


Real Austin Founder Story

A fintech founder admitted they were ‚Äútwo weeks away from shutting down‚Äù from exhaustion. Once they onboarded a VA to handle ops and customer comms, their stress dropped instantly. Six months later, they raised their Series A.

1mzkkj1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MyBali_Trips/comments/1mzkkj1/bangli_kintamani_life_near_the_volcano_2025_guide/,Bangli / Kintamani ‚Äì Life Near the Volcano (2025 Guide to Bali‚Äôs Highlands & Caldera Living),"Hey Reddit üëã  
If you‚Äôre looking for a different side of Bali - cool air, volcano views, black lava landscapes, and a rhythm of life that‚Äôs far removed from the beach club scene - Bangli and Kintamani might be what you‚Äôre looking for.

I recently spent a few weeks exploring the area and staying near Mount Batur, and here‚Äôs what I wish I knew before going.

# Where Are Bangli and Kintamani?

* Bangli Regency is a mountainous region in central-northeast Bali, bordered by Gianyar, Karangasem, and Buleleng.
* Kintamani is the highland area surrounding Mount Batur, Bali‚Äôs second-highest volcano (\~1,717m), and its massive caldera lake (Danau Batur).
* About 1.5‚Äì2.5 hours from Ubud, depending on traffic and route.

# Why People Go

# Epic Natural Scenery

* Mount Batur is an active volcano and one of Bali‚Äôs most iconic landmarks.
* The crater lake (Lake Batur) inside the caldera makes the views surreal.
* The black lava fields are otherworldly - like walking on the moon.

# Sunrise Hikes

* Batur is a popular sunrise hike (\~1.5‚Äì2.5 hours up, depending on the trail).
* You‚Äôll need a guide (local rule), and yes, it‚Äôs crowded - but the view is unforgettable.
* Pro tip: there are less crowded, alternate trails (e.g., via Serongga village).

# Cool Climate

* Daily highs: \~20‚Äì24¬∞C; nights can dip below 16¬∞C.
* Bring a jacket or hoodie - this is one of the few places in Bali where you‚Äôll be happy to bundle up.

# Less Tourism Pressure

* Outside of the sunrise hike crowds, the area is quiet, local, and underrated.
* Great for slow travel, motorbike trips, nature photography, and disconnecting.

Where to Stay

* Lake-view villas: Look around Toya Bungkah or Abang Village - lots of options with panoramic views of the lake and volcano.
* Lava-view stays: Airbnb-style homestays built on black lava fields - rugged, surreal, peaceful.
* Hot spring resorts: Toya Devasya, Batur Natural Hot Spring - stay on site and enjoy thermal baths in the cool air.

# Food & Local Life

* This isn‚Äôt a foodie destination - but you‚Äôll find local warungs, grilled corn by the lake, and warm soups.
* Don‚Äôt skip trying jeruk kintamani (the local citrus), fresh vegetables, and arabica coffee grown right in the area.
* Locals are friendly and curious - very few long-term foreigners stay here, so people will remember you fast.

# Hot Springs

* After a cold sunrise hike or lava trek, soaking in a natural hot spring is the ultimate reward.
* Toya Devasya is the most developed (multiple pools, restaurants).
* Batur Natural Hot Spring is more affordable and low-key.

# How to Get Around

* You need your own transport. Rent a scooter (make sure the brakes are solid!) or hire a local driver.
* Roads are winding and steep in places but paved.
* Great area for motorbike day trips - views at every turn.

# Who Will Love Kintamani / Bangli?

* Nature lovers, hikers, photographers
* People seeking quiet mountain life
* Travelers wanting a reset or an off-grid experience
* Adventurous couples, solo explorers, or remote workers who don‚Äôt need beach vibes

# Who It‚Äôs Not Great For

* Partygoers, nightlife seekers
* Beach lovers - the coast is far
* People needing fast Wi-Fi - signal can be spotty in remote areas
* Digital nomads who live in cafes - there aren‚Äôt many here

# Final Thoughts

Kintamani and the Bangli region offer a side of Bali most visitors never see. It‚Äôs moody, raw, elemental - and deeply peaceful.  
Come for the volcano, stay for the mountain stillness, the misty mornings, the kindness of strangers, and the feeling that you‚Äôve landed *somewhere entirely different* from the Bali of Instagram.

Chapter 1

\*100 million. Take the money, leave the country within a week, and never come near my grandson again.‚Äù

Mrs. Livingston, my boyfriend‚Äôs grandmother, sat across from me in her silk blouse and diamond earrings, her face tightened with disgust, as if my very presence dirtied the air she breathed.

In my old life, I would have broken down, red-faced and trembling, telling her I loved Austin, that I was not after money. I would have fought for him until my last breath.

But this time, I only smiled faintly and nodded. ‚ÄúAlright.‚Äù

Her brows lifted for a second, then she gave a cold laugh. ‚ÄúAt least you finally know your place.‚Äù

I lowered my eyes, took the check, and stood. I did not argue. I did not beg. Not anymore‚Ä¶ Because I had already died once for Austin.

He pulled the trigger himself in my past life by staying at his side. It was an accident, they said A drunken rage, a gun meant for someone else, but it found my chest instead. And while my blood soaked the floor, he did not even look at me. He only whispered another woman‚Äôs name. When I opened my eyes again, I was here. Back to the night I was still his wife. Back to the time before the betrayal was complete. Back to this moment, where his grandmother handed me a check meant to erase me from his life.

So I took it. Quietly.

By the time I returned to the villa, the night was heavy. The house was far too big and the only warmth came from a photo on the coffee table. Austin‚Äôs arm around my waist, his lockec

eyes on me with a tenderness so deep it once melted my heart.

brushed my fingers across the glass and memories flooded in.

Three years ago, under a bridge, I found him half-dead in the rain. My officemate-spiteful and cruel-had thrown my phone into the dark floodwater, and I had gone searching for it, cursing he name, when I heard the sound of someone struggling to breathe.

There he was. Collapsed against the concrete, a fresh gunshot wound tearing through his side. Blood mixed with the storm, pooling beneath him as he fought to stay conscious.

‚ÄòWho are you?‚Äù I asked, my voice trembling with fear.

‚ÄòI‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt remember,‚Äù he whispered, shivering, his lips pale as the rain plastered his hair to his face. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt take me to a hospital. Please‚Ä¶ no hospital.‚Äù

So I took him home. To my tiny apartment where the walls cracked, where the pipes dripped, where we survived winter by huddling under three quilts.

And in that poverty, we found love.

He waited for me downstairs after my late shifts, just to walk me home. When cramps twisted me into knots, he stayed up all night, rubbing my stomach until I could sleep. Behind my back, he worked himself to exhaustion at three different jobs just to buy me a bracelet I had only glanced at three times through a shop window.

And every night, he pulled me close, whispering against my skin, ‚ÄúBaby, I only want you because

Back then, I believed him. Back then, I thought we would always stay like that. He even dragged me to a tattoo shop, had my name etched on his chest. ‚ÄúPain means I‚Äôll never forget you,‚Äù he said with a smile.

I thought it was forever.

Until his memories returned.

He was never a poor, broken man. He was the heir of the Livingston mafia, a man who controlled half of New York‚Äôs underground empire. He had not been abandoned. He had been hunted, nearly killed by rivals but managed to killed them.

And once he remembered who he was, everything changed.

He moved me into this sprawling villa, gave me jewels I never asked for, but the man I loved was Jone. He wore suits I could not pronounce, held meetings about power and blood, and disappeared for nights on end.

lied to myself that he was simply busy.

But then I saw the photos. Him opening a car door for Yvette McKinsey, her smile glowing up at him, his eyes soft in a way they no longer were with me. The headlines screamed ‚ÄúA Perfect Match‚Äù and ‚ÄúA Marriage Made in Heaven.‚Äù

That night, I sat alone under the moonlight and finally understood.

The man who braved storms for me, who broke his back to buy me a bracelet, who carved my

ame into his flesh‚Ä¶ had died the day he remembered who he was.

The Austin I loved no longer existed.

n my past life, I refused to let go. I begged. I humiliated myself. And I ended up buried six feet inder because of it.

But not this time.

Because this time, I had been reborn

That night, the villa was silent, just like always. Austin didn‚Äôt come home.

n my past life, I would have sat on the sofa until dawn, waiting for his shadow to finally appear hrough the door. But this time, I didn‚Äôt. I went to bed early. At sunrise, I headed to the visa

center.

What did surprise me is the fact he told me, and what guilt I feel now for becoming a trusted enough friend to be confided in, to have exciting news shared with, when my own thoughts are like this and I'm not being the type of friend I want to be to the people I care for.

I look forward to spending time with him. He spends his time with me. A lot of time. Too much time. I don't know what they have in common, and I've tried to see it, and I see the white picket fence, the relocate to wherever he wants to go, the buy a house and have a kid and take over the family business and she'll stay at home. There's nothing wrong with her, and nothing wrong with that type of life, and nothing wrong with wanting what you want. 

That's not what I want.

This might be a long story, sorry in advance.

I met my partner on a dating app almost four years ago. Everything was going well until we were together for almost a year. He suddenly changed, got obsessed with a spiritual coach, told me he was in love with someone else, felt he was supposed to love everyone and wanted to be poly. We broke up, cut contact but started talking again after four weeks. In these four weeks he lived a lifetime and he had started a relationship with someone else. In the weeks that followed he ""calmed down"", the relationship with the other person ended and we worked it out together. The past three years have been okay and we kind of jokingly referred to that period as his ""manic phase"". He has been pretty stable but did experience some depression earlier this year. He has never been diagnosed with anything. 

The past few weeks I feel his energy is getting chaotic again. He is making lots of new connections and forgets about my feelings. He is obsessed with the same coach again and wants to channel this person's energy somehow. Two weeks ago when I pointed out that his energy and behavior feels the same as it did three years ago he got mad at me. He felt I was holding him back and I didn't trust him. This conversation got very nasty and I decided to act like nothing was wrong after it because I felt he was looking for something to push me away with. 

Yesterday I couldn't reach him during the day and he forgot we had an appointment. Three hours after we were supposed to meet I got a hold of him and we met up. I decided to keep my feelings to myself and just ask questions to try and understand why things suddenly are the way they are. I knew being confrontational would push him away. I found a checklist online to see of someone is manic and decided I would try to find out. 

When he greeted me he told me he had a very special day with people he met a while ago. They had a meditation session at 10am which I knew about but after it they had all kinds of special experiences. He saw his own aura and he felt that now he sees the world in 4K where before it was 720p. He thinks he is connected to something greater than himself. That he is made of love and connected to all living things. He also told me he had been having psychedelic experiences the past few days. Like seeing different colors in his cat's fur and seeing trippy effects when waving his hand before his eyes. Things he usually only experiences when taking LSD (which we haven't done for about a year). He is not taking any drugs or alcohol, but he is drinking a lot of coffee which he is very sensitive too. He also said he saw someone paragliding when I saw nothing. He is absolutely sure about it. We were in the middle of a city. 

To my surprise when we talked about the way he felt, he said he felt hypomanic. So he does know this, even though he never got diagnosed. But he feels (contrary yo three years ago) that he can ground himself and stay in touch with reality. He does this by meditating. I asked him to not shut me out and forget about me since it makes me feel sad and not important. He told me this has been a pattern of his for years. That he hurt is ex girlfriend and his mother too by not checking in and staying out with no notice. He can feel a kind of chaotic energy and he knows when it started but he likes it. He wants to keep this energy because he feels good. He feels like he hasn't been taking up enough space for years, always doing what other people want and now he want to go out and ""play"". I told him I understand, that I don't want to change who he is but just want to not be forgotten about. I wanted to talk about a way to keep communicating but he has a hard time concentrating on this. He wanted me to channel his energy and elevate my own energy to we can level. I have no idea what to do with this. I do feel happy for him that he is feeling so good, but we both know this isn't ""normal"" and very hard to manage. He calls it ""the flow"" and he enjoys it a lot. 

The hard part is that I have two children and even though we don't live together we are kind of a blended family. I feel like I have to protect my kids from him but at the same time I want things to appear normal. When he was depressed earlier this year he didn't see them for a few weeks and they picked up on that very quickly. We went out as a family this weekend and all went well but I'm not sure if and when things will fall apart. 

I know my best bet is to ride this one out until he crashes and talk to him about diagnosis and treatment when he is out of this episode but I feel so sad and anxious. It's hard to act normal or even enthousiastic about his ""flow"". I don't know if this is just the beginning of something worse, or if this is it and it will calm down eventually. His father has been hospitalized a few times and had to have ECT sessions to ""reset"". I'm not sure about the diagnosis but I believe they tried lithium at some point so it feels like maybe they thought he had bipolar. He was having delusions and had to take benzos and antipsycotics which he quit on his own again. My boyfriend has seen what these treatments did and feels like psychiatric care can be harmful. He didn't like the effect the medication had on his dad, he felt it made things worse. I'm not sure if he would be open to talking about medication, he for sure isn't open to it now because there is ""nothing wrong"" as long as he is grounded.

I thought about calling his brother about this because I think he would listen but I think if I do things behind my boyfriend's back and he finds out, the shit will hit the fan. My boyfriend does have some friends but not the kind I can trust with this. Does anyone have advice for me or some uplifting words maybe? Is there a way to kind of keep him grounded?

*July 17, 2025*

**CW: Pet loss** (mentions of the peaceful passing of two beloved senior pets)

So, bit of backstory:

In 2020, I moved in with my then-girlfriend (now wife). Along with our shared life came a shared menagerie. I brought my dog, Gemma. She brought two cats: Indy and Pekoe. I had high hopes that the animals would become some quirky Pixar-style blended family. I was a fool.

Gemma was the sweetest, scruffiest, quietest old mutt you‚Äôve ever met. The kind of dog who looked like she'd seen things but mostly just wanted a gentle chest rub and a soft place to nap. She loved cats, in a way that felt like she wished they were *her* pets. I've seen her gently lay down next to cats, with this hopeful look on her face. She never barked. She didn‚Äôt snuggle, exactly, but she‚Äôd lie nearby, always quietly hoping the cats might someday love her back. She was the canine equivalent of a kid on the first day of school holding out a juice box like, ‚ÄúFriends?‚Äù

Indy, one of the cats, was a calico tabby with the emotional range of a bomb about to go off. Chaos incarnate. She hated the move, hated Gemma, hated everything really, except for my wife and, somehow, eventually, me. For the first year I lived there, she refused to come down to the first floor. Eventually, she came around to me, but she never stopped treating Gemma like an unholy menace. Even once she started hanging out downstairs, she‚Äôd travel across furniture and windowsills like a tiny fluffy assassin avoiding pressure plates, just to avoid setting paw where Gemma might have breathed. Poor Gemma had to give up on her dream of having a cat buddy real fast after getting swatted (undeservedly) two too many times.

And then there was Pekoe. Pekoe is a large orange tabby with the emotional resilience of a wet loaf of bread. Anxious, clingy, and - this is important - he had absolutely no time for me. He was a sad fat boy who lived only for my wife. He didn‚Äôt like me. He tolerated Gemma. He hated cuddles unless they came from his chosen human. If my wife closed her office door, he‚Äôd cry like the Romeo understudy in a high school drama class. He‚Äôd side-eye me like I was the guy she told him not to worry about. We had an understanding. I existed, and he pretended I didn‚Äôt.

So that was our house for years. Gemma trying to just exist peacefully with the dying hope the cats might one day accept her. Indy radiating murder vibes or snuggling my head with begrudging affection. Pekoe ignoring me with great enthusiasm. It was an uneasy truce, but it held.

Two years ago, Gemma passed, peacefully, at 16. We were gutted. A few months later, Indy, who had slowly warmed up to me over time, decided I was her **Person**. She got clingy. She‚Äôd caterwaul when I left. Sleep on my chest, my head, my back. Wherever she could drape her angry little body. Full gremlin energy, but affectionate.

Recently, Indy‚Äôs health declined. She had a worsening heart murmur, and about a month ago, we made the difficult decision to let her go gently. She was 17. We were devastated all over again.

And then, immediately after Indy‚Äôs passing, like within a few days, something shifted.

Pekoe changed.

Suddenly, the cat who had ignored me for four years became obsessed with me. He sleeps with me at night now. Rolls over for belly rubs like I‚Äôm some kind of feline massage therapist. He insists on being in my office all day. If I go back to bed, he climbs in and snuggles up like I‚Äôm the last patch of sunlight in the universe. He wants me to feed him now. And he'll ignore my wife, his actual person, to come bop my chair and demand attention. Then he purrs like a dying lawnmower and looks at me with the kind of absolute adoration usually reserved for cult leaders and those who open cans.

We didn‚Äôt change our routine. We didn‚Äôt rearrange the house. My wife is still very much present and fully available for cuddles. But Pekoe is acting like I‚Äôm his long-lost soulmate and he‚Äôs making up for lost time.

Which leaves both of us, me and my wife, completely baffled.

I have several theories:

1. Indy bullied him into keeping his distance, and now that she's gone, he's free to pursue this forbidden human romance.
2. He‚Äôs grieving, and somehow senses I'm grieving too. But it feels less like ‚Äúlet‚Äôs heal together‚Äù and more like ‚Äúrub my belly, grief monkey.‚Äù
3. This is a long con. He‚Äôs softening me up for something. I don‚Äôt know what. He‚Äôs *terrible* at being a cat, so probably not murder. But definitely *something*.

The shift has been instant and total. I feel like I‚Äôm living with a completely different animal. Nothing else has changed. My wife is still here. She is supposed to be his person.

Now apparently I am?

Has anyone else had a cat pull this kind of emotional U-turn? I feel like I‚Äôm living with a completely different animal now. I mean, I‚Äôm not complaining - he‚Äôs a great cuddler and he‚Äôs terrible at being a cat, and that‚Äôs sort of charming in its own right - but I feel like I missed something here. Is this normal? Is this grief? Is he just now realizing I give excellent belly rubs? A glitch in the Cat Matrix?

Or have I been a mark all along?

**TLDR:** My wife‚Äôs cat spent four years ignoring me like I was a piece of furniture that owed him money. Then our other cat passed away, and now he‚Äôs obsessed with me. I have theories, and concerns.

____

># Some of the comments by OOP:

- 

*[Somebody says cat can get cuddlier with age]*
***Treasure her.***

There may be some truth in what you say here, because Indy also softened with age. She went from napping sinisterly in remote corners of the house to becoming what we affectionately referred to as *the ten-pound terrorist* (she wasn‚Äôt actually ten pounds, but the name stuck). She would scream at me until I was properly bullied into the chair, couch, or bed she had selected for cuddling. It was like living with a tiny, affectionate dictator.

So perhaps Pekoe has now learned this skill, and without Indy to contend with, has decided to adopt her tactics for himself. *I think you‚Äôve cracked this case wide open.*

(And thank you. Sorrow and joy are deeply intertwined in our household. If you haven‚Äôt already, I highly recommend *The Prophet* by Kahlil Gibran, especially his section on [Joy and Sorrow](https://poets.org/poem/joy-and-sorrow). It captures it beautifully.) 

- 

*[One commenter says Pekoe just misses Indy and reaches out]*
I *desperately* want to believe this, and you may very well be right. But I‚Äôve been so suspicious of his motivations that it‚Äôs hard to trust this sudden wave of relentless adorableness. It feels like it could be nefarious. Or, at the very least, deeply selfish. Which, in all honesty, I respect. You get those belly rubs, Peeks. If this turns out to be a fully coordinated emotional assault, I will be in awe of the long game.

I do want to reinforce that it never really seemed like the cats got along, which is why I have a hard time believing he‚Äôs grieving in any classic sense. Indy barely tolerated him any more than she tolerated Gemma. I once caught them sleeping on the same bed within inches of each other, and it was such a rare event it became a household breaking news. We discussed it *all afternoon*, like a panel of cable news pundits trying to fill airtime during an election cycle.

To be fair, though, maybe Pekoe *would* have preferred a more peaceful, interloving household. I imagine he misses Indy in the way that the Stockholm hostages miss Jan-Erik Olsson.

- 

In the world of cats, the system of territory is very solid. Even humans are considered territory.

My theory is: 1) Both cats viewed you as Gemma‚Äôs territory. They don‚Äôt challenge a larger animal on their territory so they stayed away. 2) Indy must be the alpha out of the 2 cats. You became her territory once Gemma is gone. 3) Indy‚Äôs gone, now Pekoe gets to have you all to himself.

I experienced something very similar between two cats that I got around the same time. The second cat became much more affectionate with me once the first one passed away. [shoopshoop3](https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1m1wme2/i_thought_my_wifes_cat_hated_me_for_four_years/n3kwzie/)
> This theory actually makes a lot of sense to me.

>That said, the idea of Gemma being the alpha in any regard is... objectively hilarious. She was the most passive dog imaginable. She was a literal peacemaker in her day. Not submissive, necessarily, but deeply uninterested in conflict. With other dogs or cats, her whole vibe was ‚ÄúThere's stuff to sniff, why you stressing?‚Äù

>Indy, she was absolutely the alpha. Or rather, not an alpha. A queen. The smallest in the house in size, but the largest of us all in personality. She ruled with an iron paw. Her domain included all of us. We affectionately called her the ten-pound terrorist.

>And Pekoe? He‚Äôs definitely a little princeling. The soft, sourdough loaf-like, emotionally needy heir to the throne, now basking in the full light of attention. **[OOP]**

- 

When Gemma and I first moved in, I was persona non grata to both cats. Indy appeared to warm up slowly over time, but Pekoe‚Ä¶ Pekoe was obsessed with my wife in a way that bordered on the unhealthy. When I joke about there being an air of romantic competition between us, I‚Äôm really only half-joking. The other half is projecting my own wildly inappropriate insecurities. That cat had zero doubts about his status as the favored son. I, on the other hand, was very much the unwelcome interloper.

Which is probably why all of this feels so confusing. In this house, I‚Äôve mostly been considered ‚Äúspare human‚Äù by all the animals ‚Äî even my own dog, at times. My wife has always been the clear favourite. Is it because she is a soft, cuddly human with a sweet disposition who gently coos, soothing savage beasts? Perhaps. Is it because she‚Äôs a soft touch who routinely feeds her four-footed children from her plate? Absolutely, yes.

So, you‚Äôre probably right. Maybe Pekoe hasn‚Äôt abandoned his obsessive devotion to my wife. He‚Äôs just realized he can now distribute himself a little more evenly. For our benefit, of course. Out of generosity. Like a benevolent lord bestowing affection upon his lesser subjects.

- 

Whenever my wife would leave for more than 24 hours, he‚Äôd come seeking a bit of affection. But it was always begrudgingly. He wouldn‚Äôt cuddle, precisely. He‚Äôd just sit within arm‚Äôs reach and give me a look that said: ‚ÄúYou may pet me, fat man, but don‚Äôt get any ideas.‚Äù

He wouldn‚Äôt purr. The only sign he was accepting the interaction was the absence of tail twitching. And once he‚Äôd had his fill, he‚Äôd leave, casting one last baleful glance over his shoulder that clearly meant: ‚ÄúTell no one of what happened here. If you do, I will deny it‚Ä¶ and end your bloodline.‚Äù

Outside of that, unless I was opening a can of tuna or holding a piece of chicken, I was not interesting to him in the least.

- 

Cats do not seem to do well with the concept that multiple cats can love multiple people. Multiple people may love one cat, sure. But not the other way around.

It‚Äôs cat math. It doesn‚Äôt have to make sense. It just is.

- 

*[about the death of a cat]*
It really is hard, but in a subreddit like this, I know everyone here knows that pain intimately. And we all know it‚Äôs worth it, for the years of laughter, weirdness, and love they give us.

- 

I can promise you, she most definitely was bullying. She bullied all of us. That was her love language. It was also her method of establishing her monarchy.

She didn‚Äôt gently coax me into cuddles. She would caterwaul and screech until I followed her to the chair or bed she had chosen for our ‚Äúshared‚Äù comfort. She would occasionally go out of her way to surprise-swat Gemma, just to remind her who ruled the realm. And if she realized Pekoe was even in staring distance, she would flip the entire fuck out.

Indy was absolutely a bully. But she was our bully.

In all seriousness though, I do hope this is the new normal. Pekoe is very squishy, and I like giving him belly rubs. If he pulls this rug out from under me, I will be absolutely destroyed.

- 

*[about the name Pekoe for an orange cat]*
I first read this as ‚ÄúOrange Pekoe is a genius‚Äù and was both surprised and horrified.

Firstly: no, he is not. He is absolutely terrible at being a cat. He refuses to climb on furniture. Chase a mouse? Never. We bought them a cat stand once. He never made it past the first level. His idea of playing with a toy is one swat, followed by existential fatigue.

Is he capable of finding food once it leaves his field of vision? No. Does he turn his head to re-establish visual contact with said food? Also no.

Then I realized what you actually wrote, and yes, absolutely. It is genius. My wife is much smarter than I am, and she loves tea. Her staple? Earl Grey.

Just kidding. It‚Äôs Orange Pekoe.

- 

*[somebody says maybe OOP is ill and the cat picks up on it]*
Yes, I‚Äôm good. Just had bloodwork done recently, I‚Äôm currently working at n weight loss with my doctor. I appreciate the thought though.

># [Update](https://np.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1myfq5k/update_i_thought_my_wifes_cat_hated_me_for_four/)
*August 24, 2025, 1 month and 1 week later*

It has been over a month since[ I posted about this situation](https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1m1wme2/i_thought_my_wifes_cat_hated_me_for_four_years/), and I can tell you: ***I am slowly going mad.***

Many of you responded to that post, alluding to some version of the theory that Indy, our cat who recently passed, had *claimed me* as hers, and that she had kept the other cat, Pekoe ([I thought I should share some pictures of him this time](https://imgur.com/a/EI1IW8u)), from me. I have now come to believe this may be true, but not in the way you all thought. I think she was *protecting me from him.* One might even say she did it for his own good.

**He does not stop meowing.**

Am I exaggerating? *Of course I am.*¬† He is not capable of uttering a constant, repeating, irritating meow every second, on the second, for all eighty-six thousand, four hundred seconds of the day. He is asleep approximately 16‚Äì18 hours of the day. He also spends 10‚Äì30 seconds per meal inhaling the variety of damp, brown, p√¢t√©-like meat pastes we drop onto his ornate, flower-shaped ceramic cat dish, *multiple times a day.*

**Meow.**

He *is* capable of keeping up that unrelenting pace of meowing for several consecutive minutes, sometimes as many as fifteen of them (my personal best in resisting his un-siren-like call), bundled together into an episode of mind-eroding sonic torture. It is not loud. No, it is worse than loud. It is like a psychic lance to the skull. As though someone is tapping on the blackboard of my mind with chalk-dusted fingers, little scratches of nerve-wrenching shocks to my cerebellum. Over and over and over again.¬†

**Meow. Meow.**

I have ascertained some of the meanings of his belligerence. The purposes of these verbal assaults are many. Here are just a few of the reasons he has decided to employ this persuasion technique:

* He would like his breakfast approximately three hours early (5 a.m.).
* He would like a second serving of breakfast.
* He thinks he can convince whichever one of us didn‚Äôt serve him breakfast that he hasn‚Äôt had breakfast yet.
* He would like some of *my* breakfast.
* He would like lunch now. Yes, he has recently decided he would like lunch.
* He is thirsty. He, of course, has a massive cycling water bowl, but it seems he must announce when he is heading off for a drink.
* He would like an afternoon snack.
* He would like *my* afternoon snack.
* He is wondering if he can have some of our dinner.
* He would like his own dinner.
* He would like my wife to stop singing.
* He would like to be pet.
* He would like to be drawn into a cuddle and pet.
* He would like to be drawn into a cuddle and pet at 1 a.m.
* He would like to be drawn into a cuddle and pet at 3 a.m.
* He would like to have a post-breakfast cuddle.
* He would like to have a post-dinner cuddle.
* He would like to be elevated onto the bed.
* He would like to be de-elevated from the bed.

Here are two things he does *not* utilize this skill for:

* Warning us he is about to vomit a hairball (or his dinner) onto the bed.
* Letting us know he has failed to reach the litter boxes, and has instead opted to poop on the stairs.

**Meow. Meow. Meow.**

And finally, to explain the elevation points, and the yet-unmentioned and most egregious use of this newfound misuse of his vocal powers, I must explain that my desk, where I work most days, is in a cubby in our bedroom. Directly behind me is our marital bed, which, in his ascension and self-crowning as King of this Domain, he has claimed as his royal throne.

Yes, there are stairs installed at the end of the bed. Yes, he is perfectly capable of using them. But no, he does not lower himself to such indignities when his human-powered elevation device is present. To be clear: **I am that human-powered elevation device.** Not my wife. Not any other nearby human. *Just me.*

**Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow.**

And this leads us to the newest, and most heart-melting, yet infuriating, implementation of his royal declarations: begging for my attention. Not just my attention, but a very specific form of attention that he bypasses my wife for entirely. She cannot perform this task, apparently. Only I can.

**Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow.**

This is entirely our fault. He was terrible at being a cat in the first place. He had no motivation to chase mice, strings, or even little laser lights. He never showed any interest in getting to high places like most other cats. In fact, the only time I‚Äôve seen him try to ascend further than the couch was to get to the *back of the couch*, where my wife had left her bowl of ice cream unattended. He has always been spoiled, and we spoil him further, because there is no going back. He is nearly 17. This is who he is. **A hedonistic loaf of fur.**

**Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow.**

Even as I write this, he is pawing at the back of my chair, demanding that I perform my duty. That duty? Belly rubs.

It‚Äôs not just any old belly rubs. He likes when I grasp him firmly, but gently, press my head against him, and flop him down onto his side. A gesture that began out of pure frustration (after being interrupted for the seventh time in an hour, I pressed him to the bed and gave him a fury-fueled belly rub as recriminations for his bad behaviour) only to have him start purring. Loudly. The same way he used to purr for my wife when she would relent and let him cuddle her in the wee hours. A purr I once interpreted as a petulant, performative, dramatic cat version of: *‚ÄúSee, fat man? She loves me more.‚Äù*

**Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow.**

Now, weeks later, I must repeat this ritual several times a day. I am not allowed on the bed with him. I must remain seated in my chair, leaning over him so he can paw at my shirt or attempt to clean my face. He either wants to be fully on his back, clinging to my arm with his front paws, or slightly on his side, kneading the air like a baker of invisible biscuits. Is it cute? Of course. Is it annoying and inconvenient? *Almost exclusively.*

* When I am in meetings. **Meow.**
* When I am deep in a programming binge. **Meow.**
* When I am desperately trying to maintain focus on a passage of prose. **Meow.**
* When I am trying to watch course material for work. **Meow.**

**Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow.**¬†

It is slowly eroding away at my tether. I can feel each utterance pierce into the meaty noodles of my gray matter, like an infestation of furry caterpillars crawling amongst my neurons. And yet, how can I be angry with him? How can I be annoyed, his aged-purr muscles sputtering as I stroke his belly, sounding like an ancient lawn tractor lurching back to life, the engine struggling to turn over even with the choke fully pulled out. The kind of noise you hear before some gristled old man in a plaid shirt with a yellowed moustache says *‚Äúyou can‚Äôt just cold start ‚Äôem, gotta warm ‚Äôem up first.‚Äù*

Sometimes I try to re-establish my grasp of reality by engaging these mewlings in conversation:

**‚ÄúMeow.‚Äù** 
‚ÄúSorry, I didn‚Äôt catch that.‚Äù 
**‚ÄúMeow.‚Äù** 
‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not time for dinner yet, buddy.‚Äù 
**‚ÄúMeow.‚Äù** 
‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt talk to your mother like that.‚Äù 
**‚ÄúMeow.‚Äù** 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not okay to use that kind of language in this house.‚Äù 
**‚ÄúMeow.‚Äù** 
‚ÄúSeriously, where did you learn that word? It wasn‚Äôt from me.‚Äù

Is it working? I don‚Äôt know. My wife and mother-in-law find these exchanges hilarious. They don‚Äôt realize this is my last-ditch effort to keep my sanity. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs working. I am losing it. He never stops until he gets what he wants. Any sense of autonomy I had as an adult has rotted away. I no longer feel in control of my day, let alone the idea of having any say in my destiny. I have no choice here. I must comply. I can only choose to endure or comply. There is no relief from it. I have no mouth but I must meow.

**Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow.**¬†

Is this why we often jest about cats owning us? It doesn‚Äôt feel so funny any more. It feels horrifyingly, viscerally, unerringly true. I once believed I was terrorized by the other cat, her machinations and demands feeling pointed, but now, I wonder: *have I been inherited, passed like a crown, from one master to the next? Is this orange monster my Joffrey?*

I can feel myself coming unglued at times, and the conversations take a darker turn. I‚Äôll turn to my wife and say:

‚ÄúListen, I‚Äôm not 100% on the translation, but I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs saying he‚Äôs tired of it here, and he‚Äôd like to be taken to the shelter to find a more extravagant home, something more suited to his proclivities.‚Äù

Or:

‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty sure he just said it‚Äôs time to cut the apron strings. He‚Äôs ready to get out there, get a job, and find a place of his own. I think we should support him in gaining his independence.‚Äù

Or:

‚ÄúPekoe tells me he‚Äôs interested in taking up lake swimming.‚Äù

She finds these less funny, especially since I‚Äôve repeated them enough that she now warns of severe consequences if I even think such a thing.

Do I think such a thing? Only in jest, I assure you. I may be going mad, but I am not a monster. I would never hurt this cat, or any other creature. I am gentle with them, and I love them more than people. Even this cat. This cat, who tests the limits of the love between us. I *do* love him. I do. I swear.

**Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow.**¬†

I am just baffled. Annoyed, certainly, but mostly baffled. Why does he like this ritual so much? Is this play for him or some elaborate humiliation ritual for me that I do not yet fully comprehend? If I stop and turn back to my work, he will wait a few minutes, then cry for me again, and when I return he has *stood up again*. So being knocked over is part of it. But why? Why is he so particular? What does it mean? What *is* this?

**Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow.**

I am resigned to my fate. I will act as his personal elevator, and I will serve him his rubs of the belly. I do, and will find mental fortitude and emotional sustenance as he enjoys my attention. I will let my heart melt as he grasps my arm. Or when he paws my shirt. Or when he makes his air biscuits. But ‚Ä¶why are the air biscuits he makes so slow‚Ä¶¬†

and‚Ä¶ so delicious?

EDIT: Thank you all for the compliments on my writing, and for the awards! I'll try to respond to as many comments as I can.

You say he's obsessed, but you wrote 25 paragraphs and 25 bullet points about him. Are you sure you're not the one who's really obsessed here? [Immediate-Shift1087](https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1myfq5k/update_i_thought_my_wifes_cat_hated_me_for_four/nadxkwc/)
> Is it obsession when someone is simply trying to make sense of the persistent, ongoing, and unrelenting source of their torment? If so, then yes, I am hopelessly obsessed with this tangerine terror.

>That said, your concern is fair and appreciated. Pekoe has lived a long, spoiled, and medically complicated life. Even before I was in the picture, he went through a health crisis so severe that even the vet thought he was beyond help. My wife stubbornly refused to give up on him, nursed him back to health, and they‚Äôve been an inseparable (and arguably co-dependent) pair ever since. He‚Äôs been pampered and coddled for years.

>He does have some arthritis and is on specialized food for urinary issues, but he‚Äôs monitored and cared for, and nothing so far suggests an underlying new medical crisis. At this point, I think what‚Äôs changing is less his health and more his focus. His vocalizations aren‚Äôt exactly new, it‚Äôs just that they used to be entirely aimed at my wife, and after Indy passed, he seems to have redirected that fixation onto me. Healthwise, he is what passes for normal for him. Me on the other hand, that's another story. **[OOP]**

># Some of the comments by OOP:

- 

My wife named him‚Äîand (not so coincidentally) it happens to be her favorite tea.

As for your situation, I‚Äôd brace yourself; there‚Äôs a distinct possibility you‚Äôre in for a similar adventure. And if you ever find yourself in need of guidance on the proper belly-rub technique, you know where to find me.

- 

I genuinely love that your inclination is this is him desperately trying to make good on some perceived debt of affection. Some version of *""Dear God, I have not fulfilled my obligations of affection to the fat man, and now, with the departing of our dearly beloved Indy, I must make amends.""* That, that is so wholesome.

The world needs more people like you in it.

- 

*[somebody says to close the door on Pekoe]*
I‚Äôm confused: are you suggesting that a solid-core door might somehow silence him? How? Am I to use this door as some kind of weapon? Or are you suggesting that I might be able to exile him from *His Domain*? That *I* actually have a choice in where *he* decides to lay himself out?   
  
I admire your faith in my supposed powers of persuasion, but Pekoe is governed only by the paths of sunbeams, his stomach, and his own whims.

On the rare occasions I‚Äôve tried to exile him, he‚Äôs simply yelled and scratched until he was let back in. Remove him from the door, and he returns. Every time. Unperturbed. Relentless. I can imagine that a more solid door could dull the sound of his demands for entry, but would it stop them? Not in the least. 

As much as I wish a piece of wood could be my salvation, it‚Äôs an idea that‚Äôs been trialed, failed, and long since abandoned. (But seriously, thank you for trying to help!)

- 

I think the better question is: would *I* take well to button training? Do I really want to know what he‚Äôs thinking? It might be safer to remain in my delusions. It‚Äôs entirely possible that his true thoughts are far more harrowing than I assume.

That said, I‚Äôll float the idea to my wife. Several people have suggested it. Part of me feels like at 17 he might be too old to learn new tricks‚Ä¶ but then again, he *has* successfully trained me to give him belly rubs, so perhaps I need to rethink my assumptions.

- 

It really is something Pekoe doesn‚Äôt seem to like. My wife has an incredible singing voice, and it‚Äôs honestly one of my favorite things about her. I love when we‚Äôre in the car together and she sings along. One of our first big date trips was to wine country, and one of the best parts of the whole weekend was the several hours we spent sharing a Spotify playlist and belting out every song. She just doesn‚Äôt do it much around the house because Pekoe - along with his many other titles and responsibilities - has apparently appointed himself our resident music critic. For whatever reason, he does not like her singing.

- 

*[on getting another cat so Pekoe isn't alone]*
It's a really good thought, and I love how much everyone here wants Pekoe to be happy. There was a dog who passed a few years ago, and another cat in the house who passed more recently. We do our best not to leave him alone for long. We‚Äôve talked about whether bringing in another cat might help, but given his age and physical limitations, we worry it could be more stressful than supportive. For now, we‚Äôre just trying to make sure he gets all the attention and comfort he needs from us. 

- 

I think suggesting that people who don‚Äôt approach animal behavior the same way you do, or who prioritize their relationship with their pets differently, are *weak-willed* sets the wrong tone. It risks making people less open to your insights, even if those insights have value.

That said, I actually share some of your perspective. Pekoe definitely understands that the rules are different between my wife and me. He knows he can practically stick his face in her bowl before she admonishes him, whereas if I make a certain noise, he knows to get his paw off the coffee table and avert his eyes from my food, *thank-you-very-much*.

And just to clarify: I was writing my original post with deliberate exaggeration. I‚Äôm not actually losing my mind, and I do love this cat. The whole point was to poke fun at his bizarre ritual of demanding to be knocked over in order to get belly rubs. It‚Äôs inconvenient, sure, but it‚Äôs also endearing in its own ridiculous way.

- 

I‚Äôve lived through two cats who have lost their hearing, and I found both experiences both heartbreaking and amusing. Having a cat scream affectionately at me is somehow more tolerable.

No, his hearing is both intact and acute. If I had the equipment to measure it, I am certain that Pekoe has broken land speed records getting his chubby ginger butt across the house the moment the can opener makes contact with a tin of tuna.

Even though, after every time I empty and drain a can of tuna I pour him a generous dish of tuna water, that does not stop him from incessantly meowing through the entire opening and draining process.

I had just gotten out of highschool last summer, and was taking a gap year trying to figure out what i wanted to do, and he had already had a successful high paying job, and things were going good between us. We got along well and i supported him and was there for him, but for some reason when it was time for him to support me, he didn‚Äôt support me at all. And by support i don‚Äôt mean financially, because i paid for my own things. It‚Äôs just that every time that I had an idea of what I wanted to pursue, he would discourage me and say that I wasn‚Äôt smart enough for that or I wouldn‚Äôt be able to handle it. Which hurt but i stopped caring about it. And then we broke up for a bit and while we were broken up, he went out with his ex-girlfriend for coffee to catch up I guess, and this part is particularly important because his ex is around his age and is stable in her life, and i assume that‚Äôs where the random change of heart came from on his end. Because when I went over to his place to give him his stuff back, he told me basically like he never wants to get back together because I don‚Äôt have my life together and there‚Äôs no stability from my end and I don‚Äôt have anything going on for me even though I was already planning on going to school to pursue my paramedic license in the spring. But yeah, all he did was just say that he wanted stability which I can understand, but it caught me off guard because in the beginning he never really cared about wanting stability because he said he would support me (not financially) while I was going to school, but I guess he had a change of heart, but then he told me when I have my life together to text him and we can try again?

Caf√©s thrive on **quick service** and **small-ticket orders**. They need a POS that‚Äôs:

* Fast and easy to use
* Supports digital wallets & QR codes
* Tracks combos like coffee + snacks
* Offers loyalty programs for regulars

**2. Restaurants: Experience & Accuracy**

Dine-in restaurants prioritize **guest experience**. Their POS must:

* Handle table reservations & split bills
* Manage kitchen display systems (KDS)
* Track menu performance
* Offer analytics on peak hours & staff productivity

**3. Food Courts: Scale & Central Control**

Food courts have multiple outlets running simultaneously. They need a **centralized POS** that can:

* Manage multiple brands from one dashboard
* Handle high-volume orders quickly
* Integrate with delivery apps
* Standardize pricing, offers, and reports

**Why One POS Doesn‚Äôt Fit All**

Each food business has unique challenges. Using a generic billing system slows growth and creates inefficiencies. With a **tailored POS**, caf√©s, restaurants, and food courts can optimize operations, boost profits, and deliver better customer experiences.

If you're looking for a heartwarming and thoughtful read that delves into family dynamics and second chances, you might want to settle in for this one.

**A Quick Peek (No Spoilers, Promise!)**

""Home Again"" tells the story of Madelaine Hallowell, a hugely successful, albeit somewhat jaded, talk show host. Her life is all about the fast lane until a family crisis calls her back to her small, sleepy hometown. This return forces Madelaine to confront her past, including the family she left behind and the first love she never quite forgot. It‚Äôs a journey of rediscovery, healing, and figuring out what truly matters when the bright lights fade.

**What Really Stood Out For Me**

Kristin Hannah has a real knack for creating characters you can root for, even when they‚Äôre making mistakes. Madelaine, for all her fame and success, felt incredibly real and relatable. Her struggle with balancing her public persona and her true self, along with the complicated feelings of returning to a place you thought you'd outgrown, resonated deeply. I found myself really invested in her emotional journey, wanting to see her find peace and happiness. The way the story explores the nuances of family relationships ‚Äì the unspoken hurts, the enduring love, and the quiet forgiveness ‚Äì was truly moving. Hannah's writing style is just so engaging and easy to fall into; it‚Äôs like she‚Äôs telling you a story over a cup of coffee. You can find more details about the book here: [Home Again By Kristin Hannah](https://pdfhive.com/home-again-by-kristin-hannah/).

**A Few Candid Thoughts**

While I genuinely enjoyed this book, there were moments where the pacing felt a little slow, especially in the middle section. Some of the emotional beats, while powerful, occasionally verged on predictable. It wasn't enough to detract from the overall experience for me, but it's something to be aware of if you prefer a very fast-moving plot. However, I believe the depth of the characters and the emotional payoff are well worth the journey. Sometimes, a slower pace gives you more time to really connect with the characters and their struggles, almost like watching friends work through their problems.

**A Little Something for New Readers**

If you're just starting your reading adventure or thinking of picking up a book like this, here are a few friendly tips:

*   **Take Your Time:** Don't feel pressured to rush through the pages. Savor the story, let the characters' emotions wash over you. Reading is not a race!
*   **Find Your Comfort Zone:** Grab a cozy blanket, make a warm drink, and find a quiet spot. Creating a comfortable environment can make the experience so much more enjoyable.
*   **Embrace the Journey:** Even if a book isn't a high-octane thriller or a grand fantasy, stories about human connection, love, and growth can be incredibly rewarding. Allow yourself to feel what the characters feel. That's where the real magic happens!
*   **It's Okay to Explore:** If you find this book isn't quite for you, that's perfectly fine! There are countless other books out there waiting for you. The goal is to find what you love. Maybe [Home Again By Kristin Hannah](https://pdfhive.com/home-again-by-Kristin-Hannah/) will be that book for you!

**So, Would I Recommend It?**

Absolutely! I'd highly recommend ""Home Again"" if you enjoy contemporary fiction, family dramas, and stories about personal growth and second chances. If you're a fan of authors like Liane Moriarty or Nora Roberts (but with a bit more emotional depth), or if you simply appreciate a well-written, character-driven story, this one is definitely worth adding to your reading list. It‚Äôs a lovely reminder that sometimes, the answers we seek are found by looking back at where we began.

Happy reading, everyone!",1,1756106837.0,pdfhive,0,1.0,False
1mzjy4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitMalaga/comments/1mzjy4g/m√°laga_the_city_of_happiness_and_contradictions/,M√°laga: the city of happiness (and contradictions),"This week I found myself chatting with a taxi driver in Tarragona. Lovely woman, born in a small town in Seville, living up there for more than thirty years. I praised Tarragona‚Äôs Roman ruins, its golden light, the medieval walls‚Ä¶ She smiled politely, but then dropped the bomb: her dream was still to return to Seville one day.

And why? She couldn‚Äôt explain it in numbers or bullet points. She just said: the light, the people, the way life feels like an event even when you‚Äôre just buying bread. That special southern ‚Äúsomething‚Äù that makes time flow slower and sweeter. She called it Andaluc√≠a, but I couldn‚Äôt help narrowing it down in my mind: M√°laga.

Because M√°laga has that glow. That stubborn joy that makes even a short coffee feel like a celebration. Javier Castillo called it ‚Äúthe city of happiness‚Äù during his Feria speech, and you know what? He was right. Here, the sunshine isn‚Äôt just weather‚Äîit‚Äôs personality.

But happiness is a tricky beast. Say too loud that M√°laga is the capital of joy, and suddenly it feels like the people who live here aren‚Äôt allowed to be sad. As if heartbreak, unemployment, or just a bad Monday magically don‚Äôt exist because palm trees and espetos do. Happiness, in that sense, is a double-edged sword: it lifts some up, but leaves others crushed by the pressure to smile.

Still, it‚Äôs hard to deny: M√°laga does tilt the scale toward joy. The problem? Someone figured out how to sell that joy in bulk.

We‚Äôve turned M√°laga‚Äôs easy living into a commodity. On one side, the cheap-and-cheerful model: endless stag parties, beer spilled on Calle Larios, and strangers sleeping it off on caf√© chairs. On the other, the ‚Äúluxury only‚Äù model: skyscrapers that don‚Äôt belong, housing prices aimed at wallets fatter than a tourist‚Äôs suitcase, and natural heritage sacrificed at the altar of speculation.

And here‚Äôs the catch: institutions keep telling us we must pick one. Don‚Äôt like the chaos of 80s M√°laga? Then swallow the Airbnb invasion. Don‚Äôt want the stag-do circus? Then prepare for a skyline of glass towers that you‚Äôll never be able to afford to live in.

This is where M√°laga‚Äôs ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù risks curdling into bitterness. Because yes, everyone who visits says they don‚Äôt want to leave. But more and more malague√±os are being told they must leave, because the city of happiness apparently has no space left for those who actually live and work here.

So, is M√°laga the capital of happiness? Absolutely. The question is: happiness for whom?",1,1756106704.0,VisitMalaga,1,1.0,False

**Hook:** Cooling inflation and a dovish Fed have bulls cheering, yet new risks‚Äîfrom screwworms to tariffs‚Äîlinger in the background.

**What‚Äôs happening:**
- The **Fed signaled possible 2025 rate cuts**, lifting Treasuries and sparking a sharp bounce in rate-sensitive REITs.  
- **Emerging markets** look set to outpace developed peers on *looser policy* and *lower inflation*, according to T. Rowe Price.  
- Massachusetts‚Äô **millionaires-tax windfall** delivered a $2 billion budget surplus, funneling cash toward schools and rail.  
- A **rare screwworm case** in Maryland has ranchers on alert, while **labor markets cool**, easing wage-price pressure.  
- Germany is shopping for new trade partners amid U.S. tariffs, and New Zealand may *ease bank capital rules* to spur competition.

**Why it matters:** A friendlier rate backdrop boosts bonds, REITs, and high-dividend plays, but supply-chain bugs (literally) and trade friction could dent margins. Investors may want to diversify beyond U.S. megacaps before the policy tides fully turn.

(In the real world, that is.)","I'm a 59 year old guy, separated since early 2024, officially divorced in February.  I'm young looking for my age (as I was told several times at my 40th year Class of '84 reunion).  No kids.  I'm not overweight (although I'm trying to lose 10 pounds).  I had all of my hair until my ex-wife said she wanted a divorce; it triggered some nasty alopecia aerota, but Toppik and eyebrow makeup help me look more presentable.  I still have all my teeth, and they're not ""British.""  No mustache, no beard, no tattoos, no deformities.  Huge blue eyes.  I clean up well.  

I met my ex-wife on match.com; we were together for about 10 years.  Before that, I met about 95-plus-percent of the women I've had dates through Match.  (Remember, this was before dating apps like Tinder opened up to the over-20 crowd.) 

I depended on online dating to meet women, in large part because I was really, really confused about when it's okay to approach a woman in the real world.  ""Women go to the gym to work out.  They don't want men bothering them."" ""Waitresses and customer service workers are being friendly to you because it's their job.  They don't want men hitting on them."" I didn't want to be ""that guy""; the creepy guy who's always flirting with women who just want to be left the fuck alone.   

I've been burned too many ties with what i thought was flirtatious body language.  Even with lots of eye contact, knees pointing towards me, hair fidgeting, and sometimes straight up flirting, when I asked who I thought was a *very* interested woman on a date, out comes the mention of a fiance or husband. 

In the years before I met my now ex-wife, the amount of times I've gone on a date with a woman I met in the real world was ... oh, maybe once a year since 2000, if that.  An adult bar mitzvah class, at the dog park, a few through a singles activity group I belonged to about 25 years ago ... really, not many.

I want to meet women around my age; older Generation Xers that still ""think young"" like me.  I don't want to date a woman who's young enough to be my daughter.  I see posts from 50-something women all the time here, describing how they're struggling to meet men, or that nobody notices them.  However, whenever I smile at a woman in the supermarket, I usually get a stinkeye back at me.  It's men and elderly ladies that talk to me in line at the market; not women my age.  I live in a dense, walkable village and metro area in the Rust Belt, where women feel comfortable walking alone.  If I say ""hi"" to a 50-something woman passing by, she'll look at me as if I'm an alien.  There's still the ""don't want to be *that* guy"" fears; she came here to work, drink coffee, shop, work out, or whatever, not to meet men.  I'm finding that women *never* approach me, unless they're unavailable, dating=wise.

So, single women between 50 and 59, when is it okay to approach you in the day-to-day real world, without looking like a creep or threat?  Is it basically just the dog park and speed dating now? ",3,1756105892.0,datingoverfifty,7,1.0,False
1mzjpe7,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/1mzjpe7/35000_decisions/,35000 decisions,"I recently came across the saying that we make an average of **35,000 decisions a day**‚Äîranging from micro-decisions (like whether to snooze your alarm) to major life choices (like which school to attend or whether to migrate).



This idea really struck me because I often find myself obsessing over the *‚Äúwhat ifs‚Äù*‚Äînot just about the future, but about things that happened 5, 10, even 20 years ago. For example: what if I hadn‚Äôt snoozed my alarm one morning? Could that tiny 5-minute difference have placed me in the wrong place at the wrong time?



I think about how **micro-decisions and high-stakes decisions might carry equal weight in shaping our lives.** One small choice can ripple into massive outcomes. For instance, imagine a man who chose coffee instead of tea one morning because he had worked late the night before. That single choice delayed him just long enough to avoid being caught in the 9/11 attacks.



If that‚Äôs true, then why do we fear the big decisions (moving abroad, changing careers, choosing schools) when the ‚Äúsmall‚Äù choices we make every day could alter our lives just as much?



This ties into ideas like the **Red String Theory, Burnt Toast Theory,** and others. It also makes me think about:



* How much of our decision-making is just from us predicting which is the best outcome,
* How *indecision* itself is a decision,
* Or whether the ‚Äúchoices‚Äù we think we have are actually the idea of ""illusion of choice"".

The next day, I found myself back at the parlor. I decided to stop in before seeing Thomas.

Bill looked up from behind the counter and gave a little wave, like we‚Äôd known each other for years. I didn‚Äôt say anything. I just pulled the small, folded paper from my pocket and gave it to him.

*Single scoop ‚Äî pistachio.*

He read it and slid the paper into his apron pocket. He laughed. ‚ÄúNot many people your age go for pistachio.‚Äù 

When he handed me the cone, I turned to leave, but he called out, ‚ÄúHey hold on a second.‚Äù

I froze, halfway to the door.

‚ÄúNothing bad,‚Äù he said quickly, hands up. ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ you seem like you‚Äôve got an eye for order.‚Äù

He nodded toward the little stack of napkins by the register. ‚ÄúLast time you were in here, you straightened that whole pile without even noticing.‚Äù

I felt heat crawl into my cheeks and managed to say. ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be sorry. I was wondering‚Ä¶‚Äù He rubbed the back of his neck. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been needing help in the back. Organizing, cleaning out the old freezer, that sort of thing. It‚Äôs quiet back there. No customers.‚Äù

My fingers tightened around the cone. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Why me?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause I think you‚Äôd be good at it,‚Äù he said simply. ‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt be many hours. Just when you feel like it.‚Äù

I hesitated, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll think about it,‚Äù I said in a whisper.

Bill gave a small nod. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all I ask.‚Äù

I returned his nod and stepped outside. I started down the trail toward the reservoir, thinking about Thomas.

And for some reason‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt want to tell him about Bill‚Äôs offer.

Thomas was crouched near the shoreline when I got there, staring out over the water. When he saw me, his usual smile faded at the sight of the ice cream.

‚ÄúYou went without me?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Always wanted to try this flavor.‚Äù

Thomas looked away, skipping another rock. ‚ÄúGuess you couldn‚Äôt wait, huh?‚Äù

I ignored the bite in his tone and held up the folded newspaper. ‚ÄúYou need to see this.‚Äù

He pushed his irritation somewhere else and took the paper from me. I pointed to the headline.

‚ÄúLocal Teen Found Dead on Reservoir Dam.‚Äù

His eyes moved over the words slowly. When he reached the photo, he stopped. ‚ÄúSeventeen. Shot himself right on the dam‚Ä¶‚Äù

He looked over at the dam. ‚ÄúIt must‚Äôve happened when we were sleeping.‚Äù

My throat felt dry. ‚ÄúI saw him, Thomas. In my dream. Two nights ago.‚Äù

He looked up at me sharply. ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ saw him?‚Äù

I nodded. ‚ÄúSame tan skin. Same hair. I didn‚Äôt know who he was until I saw this. In the dream, I was sinking. There was this‚Ä¶ glow, like moonlight. And whispers ‚Äî so many whispers ‚Äî saying my name. Then he appeared, pulled out a gun, and‚Ä¶‚Äù My voice faltered. ‚ÄúWhen he fired, I woke up. But it felt real. I thought I actually heard the bang.‚Äù

Thomas‚Äôs jaw tightened. ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs just a freak coincidence. Your brain making stuff up.‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought that too,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut you don‚Äôt get *this* specific by accident.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt say anything for a while, just stared at the photo again. Then he folded the paper and handed it back.

‚ÄúWhat are you going to do about it?‚Äù

I clutched the paper to my chest. ‚ÄúI have no idea.‚Äù

Me and Thomas went back to my place that night and went into the basement. My dad wasn't around, I assumed he just went off into the city to party. I instinctively threw on Silence of the lambs and pulled out my scrapbook and flipped through it again.

Page after page of clippings stared back ‚Äî faces, headlines, grainy photos of the dam and shoreline. My notes wound in the margins like tangled roots. Kyle Morrison‚Äôs photo was the newest addition.

I traced my pen along the printed date of his death, then started flipping back through the pages.¬†

I chewed on a pen cap. I wanted to dig deeper. The article about Kyle Morrison said his wake would be tomorrow afternoon, maybe me and Thomas could slip in and check it out. The library downtown had old microfilm reels, but they charged for printouts, county records cost money too. I had just spent most of the money I had on ice cream as well.

I counted the crumpled bills and change I had scavenged from our couches and kitchen drawers. 2 dollars and eighty cents. I dropped my head down and let it hang there a second. Then I thought about Bill‚Äôs job offer.¬†

‚ÄúHow many times do you think the actor that played Buffalo Bill practiced his naked balls tucked in dance he does.‚Äù Thomas said, interrupting my thoughts.¬†

I snorted despite myself. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sick.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd yet‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre laughing.‚Äù

Thomas was lying across the cushions with his legs dangling off the side, tossing a balled-up napkin into the air and catching it.

I closed my scrapbook, sliding it onto the coffee table. ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I said quietly, ‚ÄúBill‚Ä¶ the guy from the parlor‚Ä¶ offered me a job.‚Äù

Thomas caught the napkin midair and sat up a little. ‚ÄúA job?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust in the back. Organizing stuff, cleaning. Away from customers.‚Äù

He tilted his head. ‚ÄúWhy would you want to do that?‚Äù

I shrugged. ‚ÄúI need money. I want to find out more about the reservoir, I‚Äôm gonna have to pay for records, copies‚Ä¶ all of that.‚Äù

Thomas frowned. ‚ÄúYeah, but‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt even like people.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about people,‚Äù I said, trying to keep my tone even. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about having the resources to keep digging.‚Äù

He leaned back, staring at the ceiling. ‚ÄúSo, what‚Äîyou‚Äôre just gonna spend all your time at the ice cream shop now?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like that. I‚Äôd still come out and see you.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt answer. The ticking of the wall clock filled the silence.

I tried to laugh it off. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre being dramatic.‚Äù

He shook it off. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù Then there was another pause.

I looked up at the movie. ‚ÄúGod I think Jodie Foster could open up a Tuna Can with that sharp ass jaw line of hers.‚Äù

And we both laughed.

The next afternoon, I stood across the street from the parlor, shifting my weight from foot to foot. The sun was hitting the big yellow building at an angle that made it almost too bright to look at. My stomach twisted as I crossed the road, went across the parking lot and pushed open the door.

The smell of waffle cones and sugar hit me right away. Bill was behind the counter, wiping it down. He looked up and smiled. ‚ÄúBack again.‚Äù

I stepped closer to the counter and slid a folded scrap of paper toward him.

He picked it up, unfolding it. In my messy handwriting: *I‚Äôll take the job.*

His eyebrows lifted, and the corners of his mouth pulled into a grin. ‚ÄúYeah? Well, that‚Äôs good news. When do you want to start?‚Äù

I gave him another pre written note. *Tomorrow?*

He read it. ‚ÄúTomorrow works. I‚Äôll have you start with sorting some things in the back room. It‚Äôs quiet in there, just you and some dusty shelves.‚Äù

That sounded perfect.

Bill reached under the counter and pulled out a small notepad. ‚ÄúWrite down your hours whenever you come in. I‚Äôll pay you cash at the end of each day.‚Äù

I wrote my name on the first page and slid it back to him.

‚ÄúGlad to have you on board Ellie,‚Äù he said, then leaned in just slightly. ‚ÄúAnd hey If you ever feel overwhelmed, you can always take a second to leave and come back when you're ready again.‚Äù

His warm words made me smile. ‚ÄúThank you Bill.‚Äù I said quietly.¬†



**Chapter 5**¬†



After I left the parlor I went to go collect Thomas so we could head to Kyle Morrison's wake.¬†

After a half hour walk into town we approached the only funeral home our town had. I had no plan. I wasn‚Äôt even sure of what I was looking for. We waited until everyone had entered and then quietly slipped in.

The funeral home smelled faintly of lilies and floor polish. Soft organ music leaked from hidden speakers. Thomas stood beside me, hands jammed deep in his short pockets, his eyes looking over the clusters of black-clad figures.

Kyle‚Äôs photo rested on an easel at the front of the room ‚Äî a school portrait from last year, his smile small and uncertain. A framed football jersey leaned against the stand, its colors too bright against the muted carpet.

‚ÄúLook at that old man in the wheel chair, I never thought an actual person could look like the baby from eraser head.‚Äù Thomas whispered.

I tried very hard not to laugh and then collected myself. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre literally at a funeral we snuck into, keep down.‚Äù

Thomas put one of hands up to the corner of his mouth and pulled it across his lips like they were a zipper. Then he yanked the invisible zipper off and through it in the direction of the old man.¬†

We stayed near the back, half-hidden behind a row of folding chairs. I looked around but for what I didn‚Äôt know. I tugged at the edge of my sleeve thinking this was a waste of time.

Near the refreshment table, a group of teens stood close together, speaking in hushed tones.

‚Äú...been bad for months,‚Äù one of them whispered. ‚ÄúYou know that, right? His mom said he barely left his room.‚Äù

Another shook his head. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt just that. He was having these dreams toward the end¬† ‚Äî about the reservoir.‚Äù

My heart gave a hard, quick thump. I leaned in to focus more on what they were saying.

‚ÄúYeah, he told me,‚Äù the first boy said. ‚ÄúSaid he could hear whispers calling him.‚Äù

‚ÄúJesus,‚Äù someone muttered. Their voices trailed off as they turned to walk to another part of the room.

I glanced at Thomas but he was busy mimicking a stiff older gentleman who had come in with a cane. My gaze drifted toward Kyle‚Äôs picture again, the stillness of his face in the frame.¬†

We didn‚Äôt stay long after that. The murmurs and the scent of lilies clung to me as we made our way back to the school house.¬†

‚ÄúWell that was a whole lot of nothin.‚Äù Thomas said, clapping his hands behind his back. ‚ÄúWant to go swimming again?‚Äù

My mind was still stuck on the conversation I had overheard. I almost didn‚Äôt hear him. ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm too tired. I think I'm going to head home for today.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell ok, what do you want to do tomorrow?‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt come by tomorrow,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my first day at the parlor.‚Äù

Thomas slowed his pace, glancing at me like he hadn‚Äôt heard right. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúI told you Bill offered me a job. I start tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, but‚Ä¶‚Äù He rubbed the back of his neck. ‚ÄúI thought maybe you‚Äôd change your mind.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy would I?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúBecause,‚Äù he said, his voice low, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need it. We could spend the day down at the shore. Or‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, literally anywhere else.‚Äù

The words were light, but the way he kicked a rock down the sidewalk made my stomach tighten.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm ditching you,‚Äù I said quietly.

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù he replied.

He shook his head slowly. ‚ÄúYou think you‚Äôre gonna find answers about the reservoir by scooping ice cream?‚Äù

‚ÄúI told you I need the money to dig deeper.‚Äù I said, pulling my bag over my shoulder.¬†

He frowned, like I‚Äôd said something wrong, but didn‚Äôt answer right away. When he finally spoke, his voice was quieter. ‚ÄúFine, do what you want.‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt sure what to say and we walked the rest of the way to the trail head in awkward silence.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you later, ok Thomas?.‚Äù

He didn't respond right away and looked down the trail.

He forced a smile and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you later Ellie.‚Äù Then he made his way into the woods.

I stood there a second watching him go. Then I made my way home.

I walked up the cracked sidewalk and onto the driveway, gravel crunching under my sneakers.

My dad was sitting on the top front porch step, elbows on his knees, a bottle of water dangling from one hand. He looked up as I approached, his face pale in the porch light. I started playing with my pendant.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre home late,‚Äù he said, voice low.

I stopped at the bottom step. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

There was a pause ‚Äî the kind that usually ended with him snapping or slamming a door. Instead, he let out a breath and rubbed his eyes. ‚ÄúAbout the other night‚Ä¶‚Äù He shook his head like the words were heavier than he expected. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt myself. You know how it is. The alcohol‚Ä¶‚Äù

I whispered. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt always blame the alcohol.‚Äù

His eyes flicked away. ‚ÄúI know. I‚Äôm just saying‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm trying. I don‚Äôt want to be that person to you.‚Äù

I studied him, the way his shoulders hunched, how his voice softened when he thought it might matter. I‚Äôd heard versions of this before, different words, same pattern.

Still, I nodded once. ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù

He gave a weak smile, like my answer meant more than it should. ‚ÄúYou want something to eat? I saved some leftovers.‚Äù

I stepped past him into the house. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine.‚Äù

In my room, I sat on the edge of the bed, listening to the faint sounds of him moving in the kitchen. I wanted to believe him, part of me even did, but the rest of me tucked the apology away with all the others.



**Chapter 6**



The back room of the parlor smelled like cardboard and freezer frost. It was dim except for the narrow strip of sunlight slipping under the door that led to the front. Stacks of syrup boxes, cartons of sprinkles, and buckets of cone sleeves were shoved into every corner.

Bill was standing by the freezer, holding a clipboard. ‚ÄúAlright, here‚Äôs the plan. Everything in this pile,‚Äù he pointed to a stack of unopened boxes, ‚Äúgoes on the shelves. Old stuff to the front, new to the back. That‚Äôs it.‚Äù

I nodded.¬†

‚ÄúTake your time. I‚Äôll be up front if you need me,‚Äù Bill said, heading toward the door. Before he left, he added, ‚ÄúYou can put on music if you want. Radio‚Äôs over there.‚Äù

I threw on the local alternative station and got to work.

For about an hour, I opened each box with a box cutter, reading the labels before placing the items neatly on the shelves. My hands worked automatically, and my mind drifted‚Äîto the dam, to the photos in my scrapbook, to Kyle Morrison.

Every so often, muffled voices and laughter would filter in from the front.

When the last box was empty, I broke it down and stacked it against the wall. Bill came in just as I was lining up the last carton of waffle cones.

He glanced over the shelves. ‚ÄúLooks better than I‚Äôve ever seen it.‚Äù

I gave a small shrug.¬†

Bill smiled. ‚ÄúMinimum wage is 5$. But here's 6$ for the hour, and help yourself to a free item on the menu as well. Same time tomorrow?‚Äù

I nodded. ‚ÄúYeah. Thank you Bill.‚Äù My voice noticeably coming out a little louder than last time.¬†

I went quietly into the main lobby and behind the counter and quickly made myself a root beer float before leaving.

The late afternoon sun hit my eyes as I stepped outside, blinking until the parking lot came into focus. I could feel the faint ache in my shoulders from lifting boxes in the back‚Äîstrangely satisfying.

Across the lot, I saw the narrow trail slipping into the trees. Down to the old schoolhouse. Down to Thomas.

I lingered at the edge of the sidewalk, staring at it. The shadows between the trees swayed with the wind.

A week ago, I would‚Äôve taken that path without thinking. I took a sip of my float.

I turned in the opposite direction, toward Main Street.

As I walked away from the parlor, I felt the hair on the back of my neck prickle, like someone was watching from the tree line. I didn‚Äôt look and continued walking away.

The library was a twenty-five minute walk from here, and I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about what I might find.

The library‚Äôs brick facade came into view and I hurried inside. I instinctively put my bangs in front of my face as I made my way to the archive room. The archive room felt older than the rest of the building ‚Äî cooler, dimmer, like the air had been sealed up for decades.¬†

I started flipping through the local papers from the 1930s, anything that focused on the reservoir construction I would stop to read. Most of the stories were dry and official ‚Äî construction updates, worker related grievances ‚Äî but the tone shifted whenever the old village was mentioned.

One article reported on a ‚Äúpublic hearing‚Äù that turned out to be anything but. Outsiders were barred. No explanation given. The article ended with a vague statement from the council:

*‚ÄúOur customs are our own, and we intend to preserve them.‚Äù*

Other clippings told of families refusing to sell their land, some threatening violence if approached. A woman was fined for assaulting a surveyor. Another man was arrested for destroying bridge timbers to delay the dam‚Äôs completion.

There was one tiny quote, only a sentence long, written at the bottom of the article:

*‚ÄúProtect the passage.‚Äù*

I copied it down.

The deeper I read, the more the village felt‚Ä¶ self-contained. Cut off. Like they didn‚Äôt just want privacy ‚Äî they wanted separation.

And then, a week before the dams construction was finished, a headline:

**""Village Council Declares We Will Not Relocate.""**

The article claimed the residents ‚Äúintended to remain, regardless of circumstance,‚Äù and that they had ‚Äúmade their peace with what must come.‚Äù

I stared at the words for a long time, my pencil hovering over the page.

Made their peace.

With what must come.

It didn‚Äôt sound like they were talking about water.

I flipped to the paper the next day. It was the day the mass suicide happened.¬†

I rubbed my eyes. I needed a second opinion on all of this. I went to the head libryan at her desk. I wrote it down on a piece of notebook paper. *I would like to pay for some printouts*.

The stiff looking older lady that smelled like every school textbook I ever had combined read my note. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 50 cents for every 10 pages.‚Äù¬†

She didn‚Äôt seem taken aback about me communicating with notes, probably thought I was trying to be polite since it was a library. I handed her a dollar, and she followed me to what I wanted copied.¬†

I pointed out each old article I wanted.¬†

About halfway through she said ‚ÄúYou know, if you're interested in the old village you should visit the town's historical society. They have more about the village than we do.‚Äù

I quickly pulled out a piece of paper and wrote, *Where?*

I handed it to her and she said, ‚ÄúNot far, about a half mile down the road east next to the hardware store.‚Äù

She finished copying everything I wanted and before I could write down *Thanks.* She walked away.

I walked out of the library feeling good. I thought of Thomas and couldn't wait to tell him what I had found.

I made my way back to the parlor, down the trail and down the shore and found him sitting near the water's edge.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôve you been?‚Äù he asked without looking up.

I dropped down on the rocks a few feet away from him. ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ doing some research.‚Äù

I picked up a flat stone and tossed it into the water. It skipped once before sinking.

He finally turned to look at me. ‚ÄúYou could've asked if I wanted to come.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like we have to be joined at the hip, Thomas.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù he said, half grinning.

I didn‚Äôt respond. I leaned back on my hands, watching the ripples fade on the surface of the reservoir. He studied me for a long moment; his head tilted like he was trying to read something written on my face.

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù he said finally, turning back to the water. ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt forget about me, ok?‚Äù

I put a hand on his back then shoved him a little. ‚ÄúI could never forget about you.‚Äù

He playfully shoved me a little back in response.

I decided not to tell him about what I had found at the library or about the historical society. Instead, we spent time ranting and raving about different movies and actors. The air felt noticeably different between us though. We talked until the sun went down and I decided to go home.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you later Thomas.‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúYou mean I‚Äôll see you tomorrow.‚Äù He replied.

His response made me feel a little uneasy. ‚ÄúHave a good night Thomas.‚Äù I said while waving and walking away. He waved back half smiling and made his way into the schoolhouse and I made my way back home.

Back in my room I pulled out some paper and made a list of things I wanted to find out about the village. I wanted to see a map of it. I wanted to know what their customs actually were. I wanted to know why they choose death over simply relocating.¬†

I looked at my small list and yawned laying back in my bed. I thought about going back to the parlor for another hour of work and actually felt myself looking forward to it.¬†

I thought about Thomas and the way he acted when I saw him today. I wondered if I should ask him to come with me tomorrow, but something in me didn‚Äôt want to.

1mzjk94,https://i.redd.it/4kgwc4vk64lf1.jpeg,Why Hudayriyat is my favorite off plan in the UAE right now,"
1. The hills alone took two years to build. Modon reshaped the land, and the villas are arranged in levels, so each row of villas sits 10 meters higher than the row infront, meaning every villa will have fully unobstructed views from your pool and bedroom balcony, and complete privacy. The elevation allows you to either have a full sea view, canal view, bateen view, marina view, and goes as far to show the etihad towers. This does not exist anywhere in the UAE. These man-made hills require large machinery, labor, and time; two years of just land preparation means millions spent before even start construction of the villas; Modon are prioritizing making architectural statements and a unique project rather than minimizing costs. 

Note: you can see the hills built to your left once you enter Hudayriyat from the bridge, it looks incredible 


2. Price/sqft

To give an idea of the value and how low the price/sqft is in Hudayriyat

1. It‚Äôs one of the lowest price/sqft villa community in Abu Dhabi. Bloom villas (Seville) are going for 1,545 AED/sqft for plot area, while villas in the hills of Hudayriyat are going for 1,508 AED/sqft, and even lower in Naseem (the flat villas) which are around 1,300. Central location, best community/amenities in UAE, man made hills, private/public beaches, sea views, too developer, and still priced lower than Bloom Living‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs also lower in price/sqft than most villas in Yas, Saadiyat, etc. The sizes in Hudayriyat are generally massive. Bloom will not be a quarter of what Hudayriyat will be, yet sits at a higher price/sqft‚Ä¶just let that sink in. Modon have major 


2. The closest comparable is Hidd Al Saadiyat. Hidd is located on a beach‚Äîeven though it's not well maintained, it is beachfront. The villas are older and not finished to a premium standard. The community itself offers very little; just one gym and one coffee shop. While it may be closer to walk to the beach, the community doesn‚Äôt offer even 1% of the amenities Hudayriyat does. In reality, Hudayriyat has no direct comparable‚Äînothing like it has ever been built in the UAE. If Hudayriyat‚Äôs end value ends up being 20% below Hidd, your average profit after handover completion would be 155%. Pick out any project in the market in AD right now, none of them will offer half the value/returns of Hudayriyat (my opinion based off my research/calculations). 



3. Land/location:

It sits adjacent to royal palaces, also located next to bateen (many royal families living there). This is the first freehold property sold to foreigners within Abu Dhabi Island; which it takes up 53% of. It‚Äôs sits next to the new Bulgari resort, Emirates Palace, and Lulu Island (massive masterplan to be built there).


4. There is no community offering the same sports and amenities in the UAE at this level. Saadiyat is the cultural hub, Yas is the entertainment hub, Maryah is the financial hub, and Hudayriyat is the sports hub. Surf, the only Olympic Grade Velodrome in UAE, hiking hills, running tracks, and any sports your kid could think of; this has end-user/family written all over it. It provides the best and healthiest lifestyle for families. There will also be a 5 star sports hotel right in the center. The masterplan aims to attract professional athletes around the world to come to Hudayriyat and do their pre-season preparations. This is not the same concept as the entertainment in Yas, or the cultural offerings in Saadiyat, this is meant to also attract residents across all of Abu Dhabi to come multiple times a week to work out, play sports, or even enjoy the beach,restaurants, bars etc. Logically, Hudayriyat will have much more traffic on a day to day basis than any area; hence why the commercial side is split from the residential, to offer residents peace and quiet. 



5. Modon is a semi-government developer that (in my opinion) is going to reach and exceed Aldar in the near future. As far as backing, they‚Äôre already there, I‚Äôm talking about track record. Modon is building their track record to gain investors‚Äô loyalty, hence the unique projects, competitive prices, amazing payments plans that are also linked to construction etc. You will not go wrong with investing with Modon right now. 



Drawback (If I had to think of one):

1. The Island will take long to take shape, it‚Äôs a massive Island that is still in the beginning stages. Expect delays too for such big projects. Hudayriyat villas aren‚Äôt a quick flip, it will require patience and holding power.

I‚Äôm open to grabbing coffee, checking out local spots, exploring the area, or just hanging out and chatting. If anyone‚Äôs down to meet new people or has suggestions for good places to go in Bellevue, I‚Äôd love to hear them!

Thanks :)

1mzjgv0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mzjgv0,"Does Lucy die after her trip to the moon? (More specifically, on the moon)","I've seen at least 2 videos on tik tok now talking about how Lucy probably died on the moon, and I just can't wrap my head around that so let's talk about it.

First off, the videos talk about this supposed ""secret"" news report in Cyberpunk 2077, the game, talking about a female body being found floating near the moon, holding a sun embracing pose. Now, this does sound like it could be Lucy, as in the last moments of the final episode, she embraces the sun.

I've done some research on internet, not the game, (because I mostly have no idea where i'd find that report) and I can't seem to find a singular website where it talks about it. Not to mention, the videos talking about Lucy dying also don't show this news report which is kind of odd in my opinion.

A lot of stuff reinforcing the fact that she may have killed herself, is what she was feeling. I've seen many people talking about it and it's pretty good ""proof"" as to why she'd do it. Feelings like guilt, sadness and most likely suffering from depression. I mean, pretty much her entire crew died, which she considered her family. We also see her crying, crying herself to sleep and walking aimlessly around Night City in the credits of the last episode. Some say she might've done it so she could be with David again, saying she only went to the moon so David's final wish didn't go to waste.

That's a lot of solid stuff maybe ""proving"" that she did infact die. But, some evidence might say otherwise. Now, I wanna talk about the memorials she did for the crew. More specifically: David's. 

She wrote ""You didn't take me to the moon, but you were there with me"". This implies that she went to the moon already, and then came back to make the memorials, completely eliminating the possibility of her actually being the dead woman in this ""secret"" news report and ultimately dying on the moon. But then again, it could be speculated that she did those before going to the moon, which I think is kind of a stretch.

My last piece of evidence for her being alive, which in this case might be kind of a stretch. But it's the in-game messages with Falco. He mentions a couple times ""We"" or ""Us"" meaning, he's not just referencing to himself left in the crew, but also someone else. 

What bothers me with this, is that it makes a lot of sense as to why Falco gives V David's jacket. It would make no sense as to why Lucy wouldn't have kept it to herself, unless she was dead.

That's it. Both theories have their arguments but I can't quite put my finger on which is right and which is wrong. I'm obviously hoping she's still alive, but i've got no idea. So i'm asking for y'alls opinion and comments on this, i'd like to know what you guys think and let me know if I missed some stuff that I didn't talk about.

[Also, very sorry for this atrociously long post, I just had to talk about it. I WANT AN ANSWER

### The Echo of a Feeling

Alex world had shrunk to the four walls of their sun-drenched living room and the ever-shifting landscape of his wife Clara‚Äôs mind. Alzheimer‚Äôs was a cruel thief, but Arthur refused to see it that way. It wasn't stealing Clara; it was just slowly drawing the curtains, room by room, on the magnificent mansion of her memory. His job, as he saw it, was to sit with her in the remaining light.

Some days, the curtains were open wide. She‚Äôd call him ‚ÄúArtie,‚Äù her old nickname for him, and tell a garbled but recognizable version of the story of their first date. Those were the good days.

Then came the bad days. The days of confusion, of fear, of a profound, unnamable sadness that would cloud her brilliant blue eyes.

But one Tuesday was different. It was a new kind of bad.

Arthur found her on the bedroom floor, curled into a tight ball, trembling violently. Her breaths came in short, sharp gasps. She wasn‚Äôt crying; it was a silent, seismic terror.

‚ÄúClara? My love, what is it?‚Äù he whispered, gathering her into his arms. She felt like a startled bird.

She couldn‚Äôt form words, just a low, guttural moan. She clung to his shirt, her fingers clutching the fabric as if she were falling. For hours, she was inconsolable, flinching at his touch one moment and clinging to him the next. The doctor later chalked it up to a particularly severe ""sundowning"" episode, a common symptom of her disease. But Arthur‚Äôs gut told him it was something more. This wasn't just confusion; it was the echo of a trauma.

The episodes began to recur, always with the same physical symptoms: the trembling, the gasping, a hand instinctively pushing against an invisible weight on her chest. And then, one afternoon, as he was helping her sip water, she looked at him with a startling, fleeting clarity.

Her voice was a ragged whisper. ‚ÄúIt‚Ä¶ hurts.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat hurts, darling? Your head? Your chest?‚Äù

She shook her head, frustration etching her face. She tapped her chest, then her temple. ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ the‚Ä¶ the *memory* hurts. The one I can‚Äôt find. It feels‚Ä¶ dirty. It hurts.‚Äù

A memory that hurts. The phrase lodged itself in Arthur‚Äôs heart like a shard of ice. What memory could be so powerful that its shadow could terrify her so, even when its details were lost?

Clara‚Äôs physical health began a rapid, inexplicable decline. The spark of her was fading faster than the disease alone could account for. It was as if her spirit was succumbing to a wound her mind could no longer locate but her body could not forget.

In her final week, she was mostly silent. But in a moment of quiet lucidity, she took Arthur‚Äôs hand. Her eyes were wide and clear, filled with a sorrow so deep it stole his breath.

‚ÄúArtie,‚Äù she said, her voice surprisingly strong. ‚ÄúI feel so broken. Like something was taken. I can feel the‚Ä¶ the emptiness where it was. I‚Äôm so sorry.‚Äù

She died peacefully in her sleep two days later. The official cause was complications from Alzheimer‚Äôs. But Arthur knew that was only a partial truth. She had died of a broken heart, inflicted by a ghost she couldn‚Äôt see.

Grief was a fog, but through it, a resolve began to harden. *‚ÄúThe memory that hurts.‚Äù* He had to know. He started with her things. Her old laptop, her journals.

He found a calendar from her time at the architectural firm, from before she was diagnosed. Neat, professional notes were punctuated by a single, cryptic entry for a Friday evening months before her symptoms became severe: **""Team wrap-up - M's office. 7 PM.""** Underneath, in faint, hurried pencil, was a word that made his blood run cold: *""Unwell.""*

He remembered that night. She had come home late, pale and withdrawn. She‚Äôd said she had a migraine and went straight to bed. When he‚Äôd asked about it the next day, she‚Äôd shrugged it off, seeming genuinely unable to recall much about the evening. He‚Äôd thought nothing of it at the time.

Now, it was everything.

Arthur, a retired history teacher, became an investigator. He called old colleagues. He was met with awkward silences, hurried excuses, and condolences that felt hollow. The firm‚Äôs partners, Mark and Ian, were particularly evasive when he asked about that specific team meeting.

The final piece came from Sarah, a junior designer who had left the firm shortly after Clara. She agreed to meet him, her face etched with guilt.

‚ÄúI should have said something,‚Äù she whispered over coffee, her hands shaking. ‚ÄúI left early that night. But I‚Ä¶ I forgot my phone. I came back and the office was mostly dark. I heard‚Ä¶ sounds. From Mark‚Äôs office. It wasn‚Äôt right. Clara sounded‚Ä¶ scared. I was too afraid to do anything. I just left.‚Äù

She took a shuddering breath. ‚ÄúThe next week, they gave me a huge bonus and a glowing recommendation if I agreed to leave quietly. I was young and scared, so I took it. I convinced myself I‚Äôd misheard. Mr. Evans, I think‚Ä¶ I think they took advantage of her. I think they knew her memory wasn‚Äôt what it used to be. That she wouldn‚Äôt be able to‚Ä¶ to tell anyone.‚Äù

The ice in Arthur‚Äôs heart solidified into cold, sharp rage. They hadn‚Äôt just assaulted his wife; they had weaponized her condition against her. They had committed a crime knowing the victim would be unable to testify against them, leaving her to drown in the aftermath of a horror she could not name.

Arthur went to the police with Sarah‚Äôs statement. It was too late for a conventional rape case; without Clara‚Äôs testimony or physical evidence, it was a tragic dead end. But he had one move left.

He requested a meeting with Mark and Ian, under the pretense of discussing Clara‚Äô pension. He sat in the sleek, modern office they had built, the office Clara had helped design.

He didn‚Äôt shout. He didn‚Äôt accuse. He simply laid a photo of Clara, radiant and healthy, on the desk between them.

‚ÄúShe died,‚Äù Arthur said, his voice quiet and steady, ‚Äúof a disease that stole her memories. But it couldn‚Äôt steal the feeling of what you did to her that night. She called it ‚Äòthe memory that hurts.‚Äô She felt your violence in her bones long after she forgot your faces. You didn‚Äôt just attack her that night; you sentenced her to a year of fear and pain she could never understand.‚Äù

He looked at their pale, guilty faces, their eyes unable to meet his. ‚ÄúThe police can‚Äôt touch you. But I want you to know this. You will live with this. Every time you look in the mirror, you will see the men who murdered my wife. Not with a weapon, but with a cruelty so profound it echoes in an empty room. That echo will be your life sentence.‚Äù

He stood up and left, taking Clara‚Äôs photo with him. He walked out into the sunlight, not feeling victory, but a semblance of peace. He had found the monster for her. He had given a name to the ghost that haunted her. And in doing so, he had finally laid the memory, and the woman who carried it, to rest.",1,1756104883.0,thesopranos,6,0.6,False

So I started browsing of coffee machines to make a one time investment and came across this sub reddit and all the information is so new to me.

Later, I went into the room to grab my laptop charger. And that‚Äôs when I saw her crying heavily. I asked her about it. She was in a super vulnerable state. And when I gently pushed to understand why she was crying, she murmured her ex‚Äôs name.

It was a massive turn off. I felt like I wasn‚Äôt her real husband, just a legal name on paper. It felt humiliating. I left her crying and slept on the couch.

Part 1

So I'm writing this part just before my breast augmentation in the morning.

I had my consultation done less than 4 months ago, online Dr Alenka Paddle was fantastic at explaining everything and yes she has done trans women before.

I had my pre-op 2 days ago I brought a good friend for back up(appointment got moved back a day for some reason but they gave a week notice)and I got approved for the largest size currently available in Australia the Mentor 790cc (still waiting for those larger implant sizes to be available in Australia Mentor)

I basically had to with the largest size because I'm tall and wide to even look proportional on my body.

Did some shopping (locals you don't realise how good you have it) had some good food (wow I mean WOW) and coffee on quite small cups (lol i keep asking for a large it was medium at best ) and did about 30km in 4 days on foot simply just walking around (in the northern part of Australia where I'm from if you just go for a short walk expect to coved in sweat) and generally froze my bum off. 

Part 2 
A day and bit after surgery.

My surgery was second on the list for the morning I still had to be there at 0815. One of my two friends M who live  locally gave me a lift over to the day surgery. Had to pay the day hospital fee then, and fill in a few other forms, It was mostly just sitting around and speaking with nurse and the anesthesiologist (both ally by the way) and froze my butt of in the prep room. I gave my Partner, Mum, and biggest mentor a call, finally about 0930 Dr Paddle came in to drawn her guidelines on me she is such a nice and a warm blanket. Within about five minutes the nurse came to collect me. I lay down on the surgical table they put another warm blanket on me and the nice anesthesiologist and I had chat i felt the drugs hit the blood stream and had chance to say exactly that and the was waking up in another bed shivering badly threw my legs as well very sore forearms I dont remember exactly what was said, but I was put into a wheelchair and taken to the recovery room and sat in comfortable chair in a room over looking the street. They gave me bag of goodies (ok stuff that I'd need for my recovery) and my licence to have boobs (actually a piece of paper with rego numbers on it for the implants), making me think that i had hit by a boob fairy driving a truck for some reason.

Now they say that a compression bra is supposed to very tight but I wasn't quite prepared for that level of squish.

M took me back to the accommodation were back there by 1300 i think. and helped me get settled, first thing I did was lay on my back in bed the thing that they tell you not to do and it took a few minutes to figure between M and I how I could stop turtling (think a turtle stuck on it's back) on my bed a sit up (quite a funny moment now that i think of it) and we made a pillow ramp for me to elevated as well making it easier to get out of bed.

At about 1530 M was relieved by R my other friend who lives in the area and wouldbe able to stay the night (a requirement from the surgically team). I had brought my mini-pc from home and we proceeded to watch all of the second season of Kaiju number 8 on Crunchroll (well the episodes that had been released so far (really enjoying so far)). I know in this time I past in and out of consciousness a few time. 

Had some dumplings and cup of noodles for dinner as well as few good meds (top-notch pain killers, anti-inflammatories, antibiotics, and muscle relaxants, and HRT) could not much and went back to bed. R watched RE:ZERO until midnight and I just passed in and out of awakeness 

R had to leave quite early to get to work, leaving me alone for most the day except for visit by M for coffee. Played a little bit of Balatro over the day and signed up to Disney Plus to watch Alien Earth.

I'll start writing part 3 the post-op appointment and flight home.",5,1756104392.0,transgenderau,0,0.78,False

\*100 million. Take the money, leave the country within a week, and never come near my grandson again.‚Äù¬†

Mrs. Livingston, my boyfriend‚Äôs grandmother, sat across from me in her silk blouse and diamond earrings, her face tightened with disgust, as if my very presence dirtied the air she breathed.¬†

In my old life, I would have broken down, red-faced and trembling, telling her I loved Austin, that I was not after money. I would have fought for him until my last breath.¬†

But this time, I only smiled faintly and nodded. ‚ÄúAlright.‚Äù¬†

Her brows lifted for a second, then she gave a cold laugh. ‚ÄúAt least you finally know your place.‚Äù¬†

I lowered my eyes, took the check, and stood. I did not argue. I did not beg. Not anymore‚Ä¶ Because I had already died once for Austin.¬†

He pulled the trigger himself in my past life by staying at his side. It was an accident, they said A drunken rage, a gun meant for someone else, but it found my chest instead. And while my blood soaked the floor, he did not even look at me. He only whispered another woman‚Äôs name. When I opened my eyes again, I was here. Back to the night I was still his wife. Back to the time before the betrayal was complete. Back to this moment, where his grandmother handed me a check meant to erase me from his life.¬†

So I took it. Quietly.¬†

By the time I returned to the villa, the night was heavy. The house was far too big and the only warmth came from a photo on the coffee table. Austin‚Äôs arm around my waist, his lockec¬†

eyes on me with a tenderness so deep it once melted my heart.¬†

brushed my fingers across the glass and memories flooded in.¬†

Three years ago, under a bridge, I found him half-dead in the rain. My officemate-spiteful and cruel-had thrown my phone into the dark floodwater, and I had gone searching for it, cursing he name, when I heard the sound of someone struggling to breathe.¬†

There he was. Collapsed against the concrete, a fresh gunshot wound tearing through his side. Blood mixed with the storm, pooling beneath him as he fought to stay conscious.¬†

‚ÄòWho are you?‚Äù I asked, my voice trembling with fear.¬†

‚ÄòI‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt remember,‚Äù he whispered, shivering, his lips pale as the rain plastered his hair to his face. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt take me to a hospital. Please‚Ä¶ no hospital.‚Äù¬†

So I took him home. To my tiny apartment where the walls cracked, where the pipes dripped, where we survived winter by huddling under three quilts.¬†

And in that poverty, we found love.¬†

He waited for me downstairs after my late shifts, just to walk me home. When cramps twisted me into knots, he stayed up all night, rubbing my stomach until I could sleep. Behind my back, he worked himself to exhaustion at three different jobs just to buy me a bracelet I had only glanced at three times through a shop window.¬†

And every night, he pulled me close, whispering against my skin, ‚ÄúBaby, I only want you because¬†

Back then, I believed him. Back then, I thought we would always stay like that. He even dragged me to a tattoo shop, had my name etched on his chest. ‚ÄúPain means I‚Äôll never forget you,‚Äù he said with a smile.¬†

I thought it was forever.¬†

Until his memories returned.¬†

He was never a poor, broken man. He was the heir of the Livingston mafia, a man who controlled half of New York‚Äôs underground empire. He had not been abandoned. He had been hunted, nearly killed by rivals but managed to killed them.¬†

And once he remembered who he was, everything changed.¬†

He moved me into this sprawling villa, gave me jewels I never asked for, but the man I loved was Jone. He wore suits I could not pronounce, held meetings about power and blood, and disappeared for nights on end.¬†

lied to myself that he was simply busy.¬†

But then I saw the photos. Him opening a car door for Yvette McKinsey, her smile glowing up at him, his eyes soft in a way they no longer were with me. The headlines screamed ‚ÄúA Perfect Match‚Äù and ‚ÄúA Marriage Made in Heaven.‚Äù¬†

That night, I sat alone under the moonlight and finally understood.¬†

The man who braved storms for me, who broke his back to buy me a bracelet, who carved my¬†

ame into his flesh‚Ä¶ had died the day he remembered who he was.¬†

The Austin I loved no longer existed.¬†

n my past life, I refused to let go. I begged. I humiliated myself. And I ended up buried six feet inder because of it.¬†

But not this time.¬†

Because this time, I had been reborn¬†

That night, the villa was silent, just like always. Austin didn‚Äôt come home.¬†

n my past life, I would have sat on the sofa until dawn, waiting for his shadow to finally appear hrough the door. But this time, I didn‚Äôt. I went to bed early. At sunrise, I headed to the visa¬†

center.¬†

took the express lane, signed what needed signing. A passport and visa could be ready in a week. Freedom was that close.¬†

By the time I stepped back outside, it was noon. I walked aimlessly and picked a random restaurant. But the moment I pushed the door open, I froze.¬†",1,1756104012.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

# TL;DR

‚ö†Ô∏è **NO RAGE TRANSFERS!** 11 teams play midweek Carabao Cup.Don‚Äôt make early moves.

üîç **Small Sample Size Alert** ‚Äì We‚Äôre only 2 GWs in. It‚Äôs still vibes and educated guesses at this point. Your season isn‚Äôt over, your misery has just begun.

üß§ **Defensive Resurgence?** 12 clean sheets in 19 matches is a lot. Long-term trends suggest this defensive resurgence won‚Äôt continue.

**ü§ï Premium** **Injury Watch:**

* Palmer had a groin issue in the warm-up. Monitor üëÄ
* Saka has a hamstring issues. Based solely on the fact that we know hamstrings are a pain in the arse (well, leg actually but you know), we think he misses GW3.

ü§® **Fraud Watch:** **Reijnders Edition**It‚Äôs probably too early to say he is a fraud. But it's also too early to say he is the best pick in the game. Hopefully you agree with me this time but you don‚Äôt need to rush out and buy him.

‚úíÔ∏è **Gyokeres Scores + Maybe on Pens?** Bagged a brace incl. a pen, but Saka & Odegaard were off. Pen duty still unconfirmed but we think it is him.

üìä **Who‚Äôs Shooting?**All the xG/xGI data shows us is a lot of guys close together so we look at something a bit more basic.. Richarlison, Cunha, Semenyo, Gordon, Bowen all getting involved.

üõ°Ô∏è **Defensive Contributions (DefCons) Matter** Another 25 players with points from tackles/interceptions etc. Key repeat names: De Ligt, Lacroix, Senesi, Tarkowski, Van den Berg &... Wieffer

üö® **Mats Wieffer = Midfield Cheat Code?** Listed as mid but playing RB so he hoovers up tackles, blocks, etc. 23 defensive actions + 8 ball recoveries. Super deep cut for draft leagues. One to monitor for wildcard squads for your 5th mid spot.

üìù **Match-by-match analysis** also included... but lighter this week than last week!

Something I've been too ashamed to admit, even to myself.

Six months ago, I discovered ""vibe coding"" with AI tools like Claude Code. Today, I'm staring at 47 abandoned projects, $40,000 in lost income, and the crushing realization that I've become the very developer I used to mock: **all talk, no ship.**

But this isn't just my story. I know it's yours too. I can see it in your GitHub graphs. I can feel it in the silence when someone asks ""What are you working on?"" I can taste it in the bitter coffee at 3 AM when you're starting your fifth ""revolutionary"" project this month.

We need to talk about what's really happening to us.

# The Seduction

Remember your first time? That first moment when you described an idea to Claude Code and watched it bloom into existence?

For me, it was a sales qualification system. Something I'd been thinking about for years. In the old world, it would have taken months of planning, architecting, coding. But there I was, talking to an AI like it was my pair programmer from the future, and in five days‚ÄîFIVE DAYS‚ÄîI had something that worked.

I'll never forget that feeling. My hands were literally shaking. My heart was racing. I felt like I'd discovered fire. No‚ÄîI felt like I'd discovered how to summon fire from thin air with just my words.

That night, I couldn't sleep. My mind was exploding with possibilities. Every problem I'd ever wanted to solve, every app I'd ever dreamed of building‚Äîit was all possible now. All of it. Right now.

**That was the night I lost myself.**

# The Descent

Here's what they don't tell you about unlimited power: it's a prison disguised as freedom.

Week after week, I built. Sales qualification systems. Proposal generators. Freelance platforms. Each one more ""intelligent"" than the last. Each one solving the same problems in slightly different ways. Each one abandoned the moment the next idea arrived.

But here's the sick part‚ÄîI felt PRODUCTIVE. I felt like a god. My GitHub was greener than a rainforest. I was ""learning new technologies"" and ""exploring different approaches."" I was ""iterating"" and ""innovating.""

I was lying to myself with vocabulary I'd learned from startup blogs.

**The truth? I was a dopamine addict, and AI was my dealer.**

That rush when the AI understands exactly what you want? When it generates that perfect piece of business logic? When everything just FLOWS? It's better than any high I've ever experienced. Clean, pure, intellectual heroin.

And just like any addiction, I needed more. More projects. More complexity. More ""revolutionary"" ideas. The simple sales tool became an AI-powered suite. The suite became a platform. The platform became an ecosystem. Nothing was ever enough because the high wasn't in the completion‚Äîit was in the creation.

# The Moment of Reckoning

Three weeks ago, my girlfriend found me at 4 AM, surrounded by empty energy drink cans, frantically explaining to Claude how to build ""the future of sales automation.""

She asked me a simple question: ""Can you show me something‚Äîanything‚Äîthat actual people are using?""

The silence that followed was deafening.

Forty-seven projects. Thousands of hours. Zero users. Zero customers. Zero impact.

She continued: ""You've been 'almost done' with something for six months. You've turned into that guy who's always 'working on something big' but never has anything to show for it.""

I wanted to argue. To show her the code. The clever architectures. The elegant solutions. But I couldn't, because she was right. I'd become a cautionary tale. A walking meme. The developer equivalent of that guy who's always ""about to make it big"" in crypto.

That night, after she went to bed, I did something I should have done months ago. I calculated the real cost:

* **Time**: 1,800+ hours
* **Opportunity cost**: $40,000 (conservative estimate)
* **Completed projects**: 0
* **Projects someone asked for**: 0
* **Problems actually solved**: 0

I threw up. Actually threw up. Then I cried. Then I laughed at the absurdity of it all. Then I cried again.

# The Brutal Truths Nobody Wants to Hear

After six months in this self-imposed purgatory, here are the lessons carved into my soul:

**1. ""Vibe coding"" is creative masturbation** It feels amazing, produces nothing of value, and leaves you empty afterward. You're not building; you're playing entrepreneur dress-up with AI as your enabler.

**2. Speed is worthless without direction** I can build in a week what used to take months. So what? A faster car doesn't matter if you're driving in circles. I've become incredibly efficient at going nowhere.

**3. AI amplifies who you already are** If you're a builder, it makes you build faster. If you're a dreamer who never ships, it makes you dream faster. It's a mirror, not a magic wand.

**4. The hard parts are still hard** AI solved the wrong problem. Building was never the bottleneck‚Äîcourage was. The courage to show your work. To face rejection. To support users. To do the unsexy work that turns code into a company.

**5. Every unfinished project is a small death** You're not just abandoning code; you're killing a part of yourself. Your confidence. Your trust. Your identity as someone who finishes things. Death by a thousand repos.

**6. The community is enabling this** We celebrate the wrong metrics. ""Built X in a weekend!"" gets applause. ""Supported the same app for 2 years"" gets ignored. We're incentivizing the exact behavior that's destroying us.

# The Uncomfortable Mirror

Here's what I see when I look at my abandoned projects:

* 15 sales qualification systems (each ""better"" than the last)
* 8 proposal generators (AI-powered, of course)
* 12 freelance platforms (revolutionary, naturally)
* 12 random ""this will change everything"" ideas

But here's what they really are:

* 15 versions of the same fear of commitment
* 8 elaborate procrastination schemes
* 12 monuments to my ego
* 12 reasons I can't look myself in the eye

**We're not building software. We're building elaborate coping mechanisms for our fear of finding out we might not be as special as we think we are.**

# The Path I'm Taking (And Maybe You Should Too)

I'm done with the delusion. Done with the ""vibe."" Done pretending that motion equals progress. Here's what I'm doing, and what I think we all need to do:

**Accept the Truth** I'm not a visionary. I'm not a 10x developer. I'm just someone who got drunk on possibility and forgot that possibility without execution is just fantasy. Admitting this is freedom.

**Pick Your Corpse** I'm going back to my first project. The simplest sales qualification system. The one I built before I knew enough to overcomplicate it. It's not the best one, but it's the one I'm going to resurrect and ship, even if it kills me.

**Embrace the Suck** The next three months will be boring. Marketing. User interviews. Bug fixes. Support emails. The stuff that separates professionals from hobbyists. The stuff I've been avoiding. The stuff that actually matters.

**Measure What Matters** Not commits. Not features. Not ""progress."" Revenue. Users. Impact. The metrics that don't lie. The metrics that don't care about your clever architecture or your AI-powered whatever.

**Find Your Anonymous Addicts Meeting** I'm joining a accountability group. People who will call me on my BS. Who won't be impressed by another ""quick MVP."" Who will ask the uncomfortable questions: ""Where are your users? What's your revenue? Why are you starting something new?""

# The Challenge to All of Us

We're standing at a crossroads. We have tools that would seem like magic to developers just five years ago. We can build anything. But we're building nothing.

**The debate is over. ""Vibe coding"" as a lifestyle is a dead end.**

But here's the opportunity: What if we took all this power, all this capability, and did something radical? What if we... finished something?

What if we picked one thing‚Äîjust one‚Äîand saw it through? Not because it's perfect. Not because it's revolutionary. But because it exists, it helps someone, and it proves we're more than just AI-assisted dreamers.

**Here's my proposal:**

Let's declare the next 90 days a ""Shipping Season."" Pick one project. The oldest one. The simplest one. The most embarrassing one. I don't care. Pick it and ship it.

No new projects. No ""quick pivots."" No ""I just had a better idea.""

Ship. Or admit you're not a developer‚Äîyou're just someone who plays with AI.

# The End of the Debate

I know some of you are reading this and thinking ""But vibe coding helps me prototype faster!"" or ""You're just using it wrong!""

Maybe you're right. Maybe you have the discipline I lack. Maybe you can dance with the devil and not get burned.

But I'm betting you're just like me. I'm betting your GitHub is a graveyard too. I'm betting you've felt that sick feeling when someone asks ""What happened to that app you were building?""

This isn't about the tools. It's about us. About what we've become. About what we're choosing, every day, when we start another project instead of finishing the last one.

**The tools gave us wings. But we're using them to fly in circles.**

# The Promise

I'm making a public commitment, right here, right now:

In 90 days, I will have paying customers for ONE project. Not a new one. Not a better one. The first one I abandoned. The simple sales qualification system that started this whole mess.

If I fail, I'll delete my GitHub, admit I'm not a builder, and go get a job where someone else makes sure I finish things.

But I won't fail. Because I'm done being a cautionary tale. Done being the guy with ""potential."" Done being anything other than someone who ships.

Who's with me?

Who else is ready to stop vibing and start shipping?

Who else is ready to prove that we're more than our abandoned dreams?

Time to wake up. Time to ship. Time to prove we're builders, not just dreamers with API keys.

**Join me. Pick your corpse. Resurrect it. Ship it. Prove we're more than this.**

I am 24 years old (female), I have one best friend from elementary school, a boyfriend (he has his own company) and other people are more like 'lets grab a coffee' than friends. I had friends in high school, but it all fell apart, we just weren't for each other at the end of the day. I notice that I'm always the one who calls these people first for hangout and when it's their turn they either do nothing or remember later, some never.

1mzizht,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianDating/comments/1mzizht/coffee_dates/,Coffee Dates,"I‚Äôve been seeing debates online about whether a coffee date ‚Äúcounts‚Äù as a real date after a viral video of a woman who declined to go on one. Some say it‚Äôs low effort and shows a lack of seriousness. Others argue it‚Äôs a practical way to see if there‚Äôs a connection before spending lots of money or planning something elaborate.

Personally, I lean toward the second view because a first date is really just about seeing if you click, and not a time to prove commitment through the size of the billüòÖ. I don‚Äôt see coffee dates as ‚Äúcheap,‚Äù I see them as smart because they also offer an ‚Äúeasy‚Äù way out in case there‚Äôs no connection. 

Do you guys think a coffee date is a ‚Äúreal‚Äù date, or is it too casual? What makes a good first date to you as a woman/man? I want to hear fellow Christian perspectives on this.

Now what?,"I want to think its fake because we all know these things happen. He is also a surgeon so maybe someone could use that to attract more matches. But we met on Tinder last year in the spring. He didn't use his real name, but a random word. Let's say that random word was Night.

So this account I found has the same few photos he had last year when we met but also 2 brand new that I know are knew because I took them 2 months ago. He has the same nickname Night. The profile is verified! (my friend said that its entirely possible to verify a profile, then delete all pics and put fake ones of the person you have stolen them from. but still...). Some details are not the same as they were last year. But the hobbies he listed are the same, he is half French and the favourite song he put there (spotify connected) was a French song. He listens to French music a lot, but I don't remember this one. The age is hidden though. Which I know is a paid feature, to hide your age.

I didn't find him in our city. My cousin is on Tinder and went on vacation in Prague. She found his profile in Prague, near a hospital he visits occasionally.

Is there an chance it isn't him? I mean he is a good looking guy but nothing out of ordinary. If I would want to scam someone using a surgeon profile I would choose more professional pics. One of the pics there was a selfie (he has that selfie on facebook too though). But its the kind where in background one can see food, half empty coffee mug and its not a flattering pic.

1mziwxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mziwxr/aitah_for_not_wanting_custody_of_my_granddaughter/,AITAH for not wanting custody of my granddaughter,"My son is an addict. Hes been on and off drugs for the last 15 years. He has a serious gaming addiction also. He had 3 children with his ex. He went to jail and the mother was severely addicted. The children were taken into CAS (CPS) custody. I applied for kinship and lost midway through the process because 1, the children are half native and they wanted the kids to stay within the community and we were 4 hrs away. 2, i said my son could come home after jail (so he could continue the progress hed made and he had nowhere else to go) but told Cas id kick him out of need be. They ghosted me but not before twlling me that everytime i had a video chat with my Granddaughter, after she would have a fit, so i let go to let her heal and adjust to life with her maternal granmother. 

Fast forward 4 years and my son and girlfriend were homeless in active addiction, they get pregnant. Found a place to live. Seemed to be sober. I was resistant to become involved in the baby's life and knew they were in no position to take care of a child given their history, but i always had hope my son would find his way. In the last few weeks of pregnancy they had an argument and she took off. Ended up in the hospital and tests came back positive for drugs. 

Fast forward one year, i have come around to having contact with them all. Have bonded with my Granddaughter. Knew they still had their issues. And now, last week, they asked if we could take her for a few days because they're stressed out.  We're like ""of course"" next thing i get a call from CAS asking how long we'll be taking her for and activities etc as my son and SO asked for ""respite"" we were asked to drop her off at her great grandmothers 40 minutes away. Had a convo with her and found out that they made comments that ""they cant take care of the baby"" ""that they dont have enough food for themselves"". My sons SO unfriended me on facebook and the both have been MIA for 4 days. Not responding to my messages. 

I remeber my son, 5 years ago, calling me and saying he called CAS and told them they couldnt take care of the babies and told them i would take them. I told him then that we were in no position to take care of 3 babies. I would have to quit my job and even with the money the agency would give us it still wouldn't be emough to provide for them, pay for rent amd food for everyone, including our younger daughter. 

This time, (as both my husband and the maternal great grandmother feel they're giving up custody of her) i am unemployed, laid off after 6 years and and finding work in my feild is borderline impossible. We still have our daughter to look after. And honestly, after being a parent since 18 (now 47) i want to be a grandparent, not a parent. I have medical issue and my own mental health issues to contend with. Just having her for 2 days im exhausted and i can see myself falling into bad parenting habits of letting her sit in her high chair a few minutes longer so i can have a smoke (i can see her constantly and am at the door only 10 feet away) i put her to bed with a bottle (apparently you're not supposed to do that anymore) when i wake up i have a smoke, get my coffee ready and her food and then get her up...i feel guilty and ill equipped to parent a 1 year old properly 24/7 365 for another 18 years. Im at an age where i want to be selfish and be an adult. I never had that, going from a child immediately into parenthood. I wasnt a bad parent, but i wasnt the best...

Edit. My husband is in the same frame of mind as i am. He wants to be a grandparwnt and, as he is older than me, 54, he says he is not equipped either. I understand some people at our age have small children, and grandparents raise grandchildren everyday, but we know our limits, AITAH for not wanting to raise another child for at least 18 more years and wanting a life for ourselves. Or do i ""suck it up"" take her because shes blood and risk my husband resenting me, both of us resenting her, put stress on both our health (i was just up helping my husband because he was throwing up because of his own issues) and end up doing a bad parenting job. Like i said i wanst the best parent, but we didnt abuse our kids, loved them, did activities with them all the time, had them in classes, they always had what they needed. Food, clothes, roof, love. But my son and daughter are total 180's in comparison. ",3,1756102769.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False
