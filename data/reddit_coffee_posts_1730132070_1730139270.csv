1. Relay on discipline ⏰
You enrolled into university and you should respect yourself to not drop out when harder periods come. Think only one day at a time and be happy for every single day you manage to study. 

2. Mix up subjects 📚
Unless it's something due that day, you should study more classes at the same time. It's not the best option to be on the top of the class in one course, and in the bottom for another. 

3. Get enough sleep 😴  
You can't really pull all day studying while on coffees and barely holding your eyes open. 

4. Know your schedule and priorities 📝
Make a study plan and know what you need to do for a day. It'll help you stay on track and prioritize tasks. 

5. Make a nice study environment 🧑‍💻
Have a clean desk, quiet place and no distractions. Take regular breaks and other small things to keep you motivated. 

All of these tips help you maintain diversity and feeling of how each study day is different.

CW/TW: heavy angst, hurt/no comfort, not a fix-it, alcohol, drunkenness 

Summary: Getting over Aziraphale is the hardest thing Crowley has ever done. When he Fell, it was hard, but he knew in an instant what he had lost. With Aziraphale, he never saw it coming. Up until now, he had always had hope.


Excerpt: The angel got in the lift and Crowley heard nothing from him for six months. Then, out of the blue, Aziraphale was calling, asking for his help.

“Just one last time, Crowley,” Aziraphale pleaded. “I need you.”

He sounded anxious and sad and truly desperate. It was a big ask, but Aziraphale was probably right. While he wasn’t absolutely sure, Crowley thought it just might take an ethereal being and an occult being, working together, to foil an apocalypse. Last time it took Aziraphale, himself, the not-really-the-Antichrist, and a whole lot of luck to pull it off.

He had been saying yes to Aziraphale for six thousand years. It was a hard habit to break. Of course he said yes. He’d only said no once, and while he wasn’t sorry, he had been miserable ever since.

Firstly a few rings I don't recommend.

Slime Charmer - keep this at the door to your hutch if you're that way inclined, but it's not worthwhile using considering how quick it is to nuke slimes down with a max rank Infinity weapon (or any club with proper spam).

Java - just buy coffee from the saloon and turn it into triple espresso if you want the speed boost.

\---

Firstly, the ring I always have equipped:

Always equipped: Iridium + Lucky - lucky rings have a solid impact across all your experiences, and the iridium band covers too many use cases - a glowstone ring also works but I think the 10% damage boost is worthwhile as well.

These second two rings I swap out, and I'll explain why.

Napalm + Savage: The speed boost is significant and the explosion means you'll clear rocks (and enemies) at speed without needing to slow down. There's a small risk of destroying some useful loot, so it's worth being conscious of your environment. I cannot stress how much faster you move with these two.

Lucky + Burglar: This boosts your loot from enemies enormously - giving you doubles. Paired with the Iridum+Lucky ring as well, you have the best loot chance as well as the magnetism to suck them up.

  
For me - I'm mostly farming specific enemies - notably lurkers (or the occassional rare slime) - so I run the Iridum/l & Napalm+Savage until I spot such an enemy, and then swap my N+S for B+L.

It works fairly well and with quick inventory management can be done at speed.",1,1730138887.0,StardewValley,0,1.0,False
1ge8tnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Norway/comments/1ge8tnt/norwegian_dating_culture_a_foreigners_observation/,Norwegian dating culture - A foreigners observation ,"Hey! So I’ve been living in Norway for just under a year and here is my observation about Norwegian dating culture (for context I have lived in London, Madrid and now Oslo).

I would love to hear your opinions, if you agree or disagree etc etc. 

1. Dating culture here is cooked: Dating in Oslo is so different. I get the impression that very few people here want to date, Oslo is very much hook up central. There’s no romance like you would experience in other cities. Everyone is swiping on dating apps like emotionless zombies looking for the next bit of entertainment to try before they move on to the next. It’s so sad to see. 

2. Gender roles are non existent: This is an observation I’ve gathered from talking to my colleagues who are in their mid thirties and married (or for the most part, divorced). I think this isn’t a positive or a negative. It’s just interesting however I do feel like Norwegians have gone to the extreme of this as divorce rates are soaring because men and women (speaking from a heterosexual POV), have no need for each other anymore. Everybody and their dad is divorced. 

3. Women do all the chasing: This part just baffles me each time 😂 Anytime I go out to a club like BA3 for example, the women are on the prowl. Like they will literally throw themselves (and I mean very literally throw themselves) at the men. I’ve been out with my male friends and women would just come and grab their faces. I’ve never in my life seen this type of carry on before. It’s very interesting to watch. The men don’t need to put any effort because they know the women will do all the work. I guess this ties in with point number 2. I guess it’s nice that the men get a break from chasing (all power to you!) but it makes dating as a foreigner so difficult because, naturally as a girl who has lived in Spain most of her life, I’m not so forward when it comes to men and I’ve had a lot of them say that they just assumed I wasn’t interested because I wasn’t running after them. 

4.Romance is dead and Chivalry is all the way down in the pits of hell : I’m more than happy to be corrected on this but Damm, Norwegian men don’t have a romantic bone in their body. They put zero effort into dates, most even suggest going to their place and having some wine as a first date. That wouldn’t pass in London or Madrid for example. And im not saying they need to plan a whole dinner but going out for coffee is literally the most basic date idea and it works great. They also rarely offer to pay. Not even for a little coffee on the first date. It makes them so boring to date. There’s no excitement there’s no wooing. Again, ties in with point number 2 and 3. The men here are just used to doing nothing at all, because they know the woman will carry the weight. It’s interesting but makes dating so incredibly boring. No passion no romance. Might as well date one of those AI things.

And this is no hate to Norwegians so please don’t come crying and throwing a tantrum. I live here by choice because I love it here, and I also like Norwegian people.

It be fun to organize something and create a little writing group. Not sure! Does something like this already exist?

I’m 22 and I started drinking coffee as a young teenager. At some point we got a machine that used nespresso-like pods which I really liked, I typically used powdered milk to make it more creamy and hide the bitter taste.

Fast forward to last year I did an internship in Switzerland where we had a nespresso pro machine using the ‘pro’ pods/pouches which had much more complex flavors than what I was used to. At the same time I was googling a lot which caused the discovery of this subreddit. 

I wanted to try a ‘real’ espresso machine and set my heart on the sage barista express. I didn’t end up getting it after reading about the mediocre grinder on this subreddit. I ended up with the bambino plus! I liked it at first but quickly learned that it wasn’t the best for delicate straight shots of (light roast) espresso, which is what I liked the most. 

After some more research and sending back the bambino plus, I decided on the ECM Classika ii PID which I’m using now. It’s amazing. 

I buy my beans from a local specialty roaster here in Amsterdam called Fried Hats, their beans are incredible because they only sell single origin beans often from small farms and families. 

So here I am now exploring more and greatly enjoying a couple espresso’s a day! ",2,1730138812.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

Yesterday I was hanging out with a friend drinking some beers/mixed drinks, and he noticed I had to go to the restroom to urinate pretty often to the point where he mentioned (not joking around) that maybe I should go get a prostate exam. This isn't the first time he's mentioned to this to me either -- although he may be a little sensitive to this because a friend or relative of his had prostate cancer.

It made me wonder about it, because I had been thinking if I should be concerned before he said anything. I'll often have to urinate pretty intensely (like can't wait around to go) and I think more often than I used to. I've always chalked it up to the fact that I drink two cups of coffee in the morning, and just drink a decent amount of liquid in general, or to the fact that I've been drinking alcohol. But I'm not sure -- how should I gauge this? Should I try to keep a log first and see from there? Should I get a prostate exam anyway, although the age I see recommended is typically 50, and up at 40 for high risk? I'd really like to avoid it unless it seems necessary.",1,1730138747.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Hello darlings! 💖 I just posted another installment of my Ineffable Prompt A Thon AU inspired by @ineffablyruined, following Lingering!

Week 11’s prompt is Stained ✨ Crowley tries to get through the aftermath of his breakup with Aziraphale, but he's struggling immensely. Thankfully, he doesn't have to go it totally alone.

This is still a little angsty, but we have another hopeful ending from Crowley’s POV. It’s all uphill from here ♥️

Tags: Human AU, Coffee Shop AU, Crowley POV, Breakup Aftermath, Heartbroken Crowley, Crowley Is A Mess, Platonic Cuddling, Emotional Support Ex Boyfriend, Hopeful Ending

*Excerpt*:

The floor of the bandstand had been ripped out from under his feet as Aziraphale insisted he felt nothing for Crowley besides sexual attraction, that he was merely *experienced* in making people feel cared for and that was all, and he’s been careening ever downward since, dropping at an incredible velocity with increasing acceleration as the hours go by since the initial plunge. Crowley had already been falling for Aziraphale, but then he’d been *pushed*, he’d been shoved off the precipice by the hands Crowley is hopelessly in love with in a shocking departure from their usual acts of pulling him closer and holding him tightly in a grip that sometimes seemed unwilling to relent.

This fall, Crowley muses as he gingerly sits up on his sofa, wincing at the too vivid sunlight streaming through the window and the pain in his muscles from being curled up on the too short sofa, this excruciating and painful descent, is one he *should* have fucking seen coming, and one he could have prevented if he’d just kept his mouth shut for *once.*

Why had he *insisted* on even broaching the subject with Aziraphale, *why* had he given into his proclivity for asking questions, for not letting things that should remain sleeping undisturbed? Aziraphale has been nothing but plain regarding his needs and boundaries, he’s expressed himself directly and with confidence, but Crowley had to go and *fuck it up* like he fucks *everything* up, he went and let himself believe that there was *more* between them, that there was so much more because *he* felt so much more.

He’s been a fucking *fool.*

1ge8pr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ge8pr1/hmm_kinda_confused_lol/,Hmm kinda confused lol,"So here’s the story. I’m 24, and I met this girl, 21, on Tinder. We started chatting for about 2-3 weeks and got along well; we shared similar interests, so everything seemed like a good match. We decided to meet for a date—pretty classic coffee date. We talked about everything: university, sports, life in general. I felt like we clicked really well.

After coffee, we walked to a park, sat on a bench, and things just seemed to flow naturally. At one point, she leaned into me, and I wrapped my arm around her, eventually leading to a kiss. Afterward, we headed to another café to warm up and enjoy the moment. Honestly, it felt like a great success. She even messaged me right after saying she had a wonderful time, so I thought everything was going really well.

Then I had to head back to finish my last week in the military. We messaged a bit here and there, and then planned another meet-up. I suggested Saturday because Friday would be too tight unless she came to my place. She agreed to meet on Friday.

Before she came over, I asked if she needed any snacks or drinks, but she said she would be perfectly happy just spending time with me. I picked her up, we went to eat, then back to my place to look at planets through my telescope. We decided to sleep after that, but I have a small bed, so it wasn’t exactly the most comfortable night. She left around 5:30 a.m., saying we could happily meet again another time. I walked her to the door, we said goodbye with a kiss, and that was that.

The next evening, she texted, thanking me for the date but saying she didn’t feel enough interest to keep meeting. She mentioned I was a nice, cool guy and wished me the best. I’ll admit, I was a bit caught off guard. I had a feeling something was off, so I told her I might not have seemed fully myself since the military had been wearing me down. I also shared that I’m not used to meeting someone I’m genuinely interested in, but I respected her decision.

She replied that it wasn’t about me at all—she just needed to focus on university and other things going on in her life. I get that; she’s studying something challenging, but that realization seemed to come out of nowhere. She also told me she deleted her Tinder and emphasized that her decision really had nothing to do with me.

Honestly, I’m kind of at a loss about the whole thing. The second date actually went well; she kissed me on her own and cuddled up, too. I admit I might have been a little too caring or shown too much too soon. At one point, I noticed she seemed a bit tense, but only for a moment, and then she opened up to affection again. Plus, I had a lot on my mind; a friend from the military had passed away just the previous week in an activity I’m also really into, so it was still fresh, though she doesn’t know about that.

For me, it’s like either I missed something that I didn’t notice, or maybe it was just too much for her. I don’t know. I even reserved a brunch table as a surprise but ended up going alone lol now I’m left wondering if I should just let it be or maybe reach out in a month or two?

My thoughts.,"I bought samples of every single scent. They were tested with spritzes to the neck and wrist on clean skin, no scented body lotion.

**Crystal Ritual**  
  
notes are described as 

TOP - frosted jasmine, crimson strawberry, midnight velvet rose, 

HEART - precious woods, styrax incense, 

BASE - palo santo smoke, sweet amber.



Immediate: cool mineral  
  
2-10 minutes after application: strong rose and sweet strawberry, almost strawberry juice smell.  Faint cool mineral background

1 hour after application: Still sweet in a slightly juicy way, smells less like strawberry juice, more fresh. Mineral smell still present. Overall a very ‘cool’ fragrance, fittingly for the name.  
  
4+ hours after application: Mostly light woods and subtle spice with a cold sweetness over the top.  
  
Wear: Wears well for several hours on my skin.  
  
I like it and will use up the sample, but it’s not really my sort of thing, not even for a summer scent.



**Kill For Me**



Notes are described as

TOP- Agarwood oud, Green cardamom, Sichuan Pepper

HEART - Sandalwood, Vanilla absolute, vetiver

BASE - Dalbergia rosewood, roasted tonka bean, black amber



Immediate: Warm sharp cologne

2-10 minutes after application: very classic men’s cologne style fragrance, warm and clean. The woods are pulling very strong on me. Faint old bonfire scent.

1 hour after application: Warm, clean, and woody with a hint of fancy men’s shaving soap.

4+ hours after application: A soft and subtle old-fashioned barbershop smell.   
  
Wear: moderately good. Had faded a fair bit by 3pm.  
  
Definitely not for me. Will give the sample to a friend. Sort of smell I’d love to catch from someone I was involved with, but not on my own skin.

  


**Deaths Elixir:**



Notes are described as

TOP- Green Cardamom, Sargal Saffron, Sceptre Raspberry

HEART- Black Leather, Jasmine Flowers, Sweet Amber

BASE - Oakmoss, Patchouli Leaf, Vetiver



Immediate: Raspberry!

2-10 minutes after application: Damp, woody, herbaceous with the raspberry a subtle touch over it. Like picking wild raspberries in a forest grove.

1 hour after application: Complex deep autumnal scent - woods and damp rich mossy earth. Patchouli pretty prominent on me, which is common for my body chemistry.

4+ hours after application: gently sweetened and freshened patchouli with a faint hint of spice.  
  
Wear:

Good! Several hours. Sits close to the body, which I prefer.

I like it, but the patchouli overwhelms it on me. 



**Vampiren Veil**  
  
Notes are described as

TOP- Sargol Saffron, Jasmine Flowers, Crimson Strawberry

HEART- Burnt Sugar, Fir Tree Resin, Ambrox Crystals

BASE- Black Amber  
  
Immediately: Rum

2-10 minutes after application: strawberry creme brulee with an edge  
  
1 Hour after application: Sweet but not super sugary sweet - a more complex and refined sweetness.

4+ Hours after application:  Warm skin, powdery spice, and a hint of fresh farm strawberries in the height of summer.  


Wear. Good. Very subtle after about 4 hours.

I like this much more than Crystal Ritual - this is far more how I like my sweet/fruit fragrances. Not as feminine, more deep notes.

  


**Moonstruck:** 

Notes are described as:

TOP: Black Coffee, Frosted Jasmine, Sweet Licorice

Heart: Pink Pepper, Vanilla Absolute

Base: Patchouli Leaf, Ambroxen



Immediate: Sharp powder?

2-10 minutes: Powdery, very faint whiff of aniseed

1 hour: Generically ‘soft’ smelling

4+ hours: vintage high femme body powder

Wear: poor



Did not like this at all - shame.



**Ritual Spirit:**

Notes are described as

Top: Tobacco Leaf, Ritual Spices

Heart: Vanilla Absolute, Trinitario Cacao, Roasted Tonka Bean, Tobacco Blossom

Base: Dried Fruits, Palo Santo Smoke, Precious Woods



Immediate: Herbaceous sweet/acrid contrast

2-4 minutes:  Complex, with the tobacco and vanilla quite strong on me. Not much depth, however.

1 hour: Now softer with more depth. A warmly sweet and comforting smell with a hint of spice. An old fashioned tobbaconist.

4+ hours: warm, soft sweetness with faint incense.



 I liked this a lot. Found it soothing and comforting as a scent.



Wear very good. Lasted a long time.

  
  


**Pretty as Poison:**



Notes are described as

Top- Tatarian Black Cherry, Black Amber Plum, Bitter Almond

Heart - Aged Liqueur, Midnight Rose

Base- Vanilla Absolute, Ceylon Cinnamon, Roasted Tonka Bean



Immediate: Smoked autumn fruits

2-10 minutes - Bitter almond comes through a bit more, fruits sit lower in the blend to add a subtle tart juiciness.

1 hour: Subtly smoky with the liqueur adding a richness to it, bitter almond adds complexity

4+ hours: Matures into deep warm vanilla and spice.



Wear: very good



Like this one a lot. Towards the top of the list. Will probably buy a full at some point.



**From Hell**:

Notes are described as:

Top: Sandalwood

Heart: Black Styrax, Benzoin Siam, Patchouli Leaf

Base: Ambroxan Resin, Black Amber



Immediate: Sandalwood and patchouli - your hippy aunts bedroom.

2-10 minutes: becomes subtler, more complex. Warm, dry, spicy.

1 hour:  Somehow the patchouli is staying balanced on me in this blend. We’re now into autumnal woods territory.

4+ hours: rich, soothing warm woods.

Wear: Exceptional.



THIS IS THE ONE. Full size ordered.

1ge8m2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/FlairEspresso/comments/1ge8m2s/pressure_and_light_vs_medium_roast/,Pressure and light vs medium roast,"I learned how to use a flair with light Ethiopian coffee. My preferred espresso shot was 14g in 35g out in about a minute, with about a 10 second preinfusion. When ramping up, I could easily hit 9 bars and hold it for a bit, then allow a gradual decline in pressure.

I’ve recently got a bag from the same roaster, that was roasted about 8 days ago. The bag is a medium ‘espresso’ roast.  I coursed up the grind to attempt a 1:2 ratio of 15g in 30g out in 30 seconds. What I found was during ramp up, I could totally feel the puck getting destroyed past 6 bars or so and got tons of channeling. 

For my second pull, I tightened up the grind a smidge and got the ratio and time I wanted, but I kind of held back the pressure, which again happened to be right around 6 bars, just as I felt the puck integrity want to give out. 

I’m caffeined out at the moment as I had a couple cups of French press earlier this morning…but anyways, it got me thinking, does the darker you go with a roast require less pressure? Is a medium or dark roast coffee typically pulled at pressured less than 9 bars? Or maybe I just need to preinfuse for less time with this roast.

I [M/NB24] have been on one date in my entire life and moved to a new country about a month ago. Recently, I met this girl [F26] from that country who studies at the same university in a large lecture-type class, the last class of the semester. We had some mutual connections and had texted back and forth a bit a few days before but hadn't talked in person until the class. Since we study in different programs and our classes (other than this one lecture) are usually in different buildings, she messaged me first the day after and asked if she would see me again. Since I found her attractive and it's unlikely we would run into each other after this class, I suggested we get a coffee a few days later (but didn't call it a date, because I don't know what she thought and I'm usually pretty slow with these things.)

The first red flag for me was that she said she basically had no money and asked me to pay for her coffee. I've had friends before who don't have a lot of money and I have absolutely no judgment about that (and it's believable enough in this case), but they still usually pay for themselves - I live in an expensive country but she did ask for one of the cheapest coffees on the menu. If we called this a date I would be more OK with it, but since we were (on the surface) just meeting as friends, it was a bit of a turn-off.

It turned out that she's also single - we talked a lot at the cafe but even though I could keep up the conversation easily, I didn't enjoy the flow of it. I've always had more close female friends than male friends and what I always appreciated about them is that we could leave space for each other's viewpoints and perspectives, rather than just agreeing with the other person. Honestly, the whole conversation just felt a bit fake - and since she grew up in my home country for a few years and spoke warmly about it (where I had similar conversations with ""friends""), it reminded me of what I had decided to leave for good reason.

Since then, she's been messaging me a few times - and while she hasn't explicitly said that she's interested in me, we both essentially talked about considering a relationship and I know from her own words that she likes my personality. I find her attractive, as I already mentioned, and I do think she has the right values in general, but given my experience, I'm not sure if I should give her another chance or just listen to what my gut is saying and gently tell her it won't work out.

1ge8ig8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creepystories/comments/1ge8ig8/the_greenridge_road_library/,the greenridge road library,"My neighborhood isn't your cliche movie neighborhood. The lawns aren't perfect, kids don't leave bikes lying around on the sidewalks, and neighbors don't smile and wave as you drive by.  We all kind of mind our own business, for the most part. To be honest, I don't think I've ever had a conversation with any one of my neighbors. But to my defense, my neighborhood isn't built like a traditional neighborhood.

I live in Castro Valley. Emphasis on the ""valley."" The entire town is built on hills. The block I live on resembles more of a roller coaster than a street. I wish I could say you get used to living like this, but you don't. My house is smack in the middle of a hill; and after a decade of living here, I've discovered that I'm a ""house half uphill"" kind of guy.

My ten-year-old son, Cooper, loves it here. There's a single-screen movie theater down the street, next door to that is a comic book shop, across the street is an ice cream parlor, and a few blocks over is Golfland. I'm convinced that Castro Valley was designed by a child.

Cooper had overheard my wife and I talking about how unfriendly our neighborhood felt and he had an idea of how we could do our part in fixing it. When he visits my mother-in-law, they like to go on walks. I guess a neighbor of hers has one of those Little Free Library things in their front yard. The mailbox looking thing that the owner fills with books, and anyone walking by is encouraged to trade one of their own books for one in the library. Cooper said we could fill it with all of our favorite books, so our neighbors could get to know us a little better.

He had spring break coming up, and I had vacation days lying around, so I planned on taking the week off to spend with him. I figured building the library was a great opportunity for a father-son project.

The sun was setting, and admittedly, it may have taken a little longer than anticipated to build, but there it was nonetheless. We took a step back and admired the little library that was now standing firmly in our yard. I handed him a paintbrush and told him that all the library was missing was a name. He gave it some thought, then started with the brush. When he moved away, I could see that he painted ""Greenridge Road Library"" in big green letters. Fittingly named after the street we live on.

The next day, I peeled myself off of my mattress and dragged my feet into the kitchen. Cooper was sitting on the couch, fully dressed, shoes tied, hair brushed, ready to go. I have weird attachments to all of Cooper's stuff. He's our only child, so every little thing of his is tethered to precious memories. I couldn't just let him put his books, which my wife and I read to him over the years, outside for strangers to take. So, I told him we would go to the bookstore to get new books to use.

Before we left, Cooper ran over to check our Greenridge Road Library. I hurried to catch up to him when I saw him jumping up and down with excitement. He screamed ""Dad! Dad! Look!"" And to my surprise, there was already a book sitting inside of the little library, patiently waiting for us to adopt it.

It was a Penguin Random House children's book titled: ""How to Swim and Dive."" It was a cute, little, vintage, book about learning how to swim. And even though it was covered in a clear, but yellowing, protective jacket; the book was extremely weathered. It looked decades old. The style of the cover art and pictures throughout the pages made me think it may be midcentury era. The once bright colored spine was cracking and had a slight tear through the ""V"" in the book name, giving it the new title: ""How to Swim and Die."" That got a guilty chuckle out of me.

The book jacket proudly wore a sticker for the Hayward Public Library. Hayward is Castro Valley's sister city, so it wasn't too surprising that a book from there ended up minutes away in our front yard. What was surprising was the fully intact checkout card still in the sleeve on the inside. The only name and date on the card were: Roger Davis on April 3rd, 1964.

Out of curiosity, I Googled the name Roger Davis. Facebook and LinkedIn profiles popped up, all of smiling young men that were half of the age my Roger Davis would be today. I tried to narrow the search down by adding ""California,"" but no luck. I'm old enough to remember life before the internet, So I went to scavenge for The Yellow Pages book that I thought we still had somewhere.

If I had given it any real thought, I would have remembered that we got rid of our last one about five spring cleanings ago. I figured this would be the perfect time to introduce my son to the public library system. I told Cooper that we could go to the Hayward Library; since that was where the book was originally from. And we could maybe even see if they could look up any information on Roger Davis.

Although he was incredibly eager to get inside and work the case, Cooper still held the library door open for the fragile moving old man walking behind us. The librarian glared at me over the top of her thick lenses, with an ""Are you serious?"" look on her face. She sighed and lectured me on why she couldn't share the private information of their members, even if they had it. Which they didn’t. Those records were long gone. Also long gone: the Yellow Pages, apparently. I don’t know why I assumed the library would have them, but they didn’t. So, I ordered one on my phone to be delivered to my house and we left. On the way out, Cooper whispered to me that he'd be a nicer librarian for The Greenridge Road Library.

The following day was a hotter than usual spring day. My wife and I decided that a family day at the community pool sounded good. We didn't have a pool in our backyard, and no one else we knew did, either. And as a result, Cooper wasn't the best swimmer. But lucky for him, we just so happened to have come into the custody of a how-to swim book.

We got to the pool and I had the highly important job of securing pool chairs for my family. It took me a little while to collect enough chairs. It would have taken longer, if not for the elderly gentleman who graciously volunteered his chair to me. His attempt at hiding from the sun under a bucket hat and sunglasses was failing, so he was leaving anyway. He was amused that I was carrying around such a vintage book. On his way out, he gave the faintest smile and said that he had the same book when he was younger.

I started thumbing through the pages to see if there were any good pointers that I could relay to Cooper, and I must not have looked hard enough the first time we found the book because I now noticed handwritten numbers on the bottom corner of every page. Two numbers on each page and they didn't correspond to the page number at all. The first page had ""37."" The next one had ""66,"" the third page had ""46,"" and so on; fifteen numbers in total. There was no obvious reason or pattern to the order, but they were neatly written and obviously intentional.

I'm not too proud to admit that my wife is smarter than I am, but I still felt like a complete idiot when it only took her a millisecond to glance at the pages and say ""Oh, neat! It's coordinates.""  Of course. Why wasn't that my first guess? Cooper asked what coordinates were and when I explained them to him, he got really excited at the thought of it being buried treasure. That excitement soured to disappointment when I shot down his proposal to go chase the coordinates that exact minute. I told him we could go the following day, and then hit the biggest cannonball he's ever seen as a distraction.

Cooper shook me until I fully woke up. He wouldn't stop until I had Google Maps open. He watched with anticipation as I typed in each number of the coordinates. The pin dropped into a cluster of trees, a little ways off of the Ward Creek walking trail in the Hayward hills. To his delight, it was only a ten-minute drive away.

Cooper was so excited walking that trail. He's not an introvert, but he rarely talks to strangers. That day, he was waving and saying hi to everyone we crossed paths with. The family walking their dog got a hey from Cooper. He said ""Have a nice day"" to the pale-haired, old man, that was catching his breath on a bench. One jogger even got a high-five from Cooper.

I couldn't help but feel like an irresponsible parent when we reached the point of the walkway that we had to diverge off of to get to the coordinates. It didn't seem like the safest trek for a ten-year-old to make, but I couldn't stomach telling him that he couldn't see this through. As we approached the coordinates, I could make out glimpses of unnatural colors in the distance. At first, I thought it was a group of people, and slid Cooper behind me as we walked up.

Standing directly on top of the coordinates, we were dead center to a group of trees. On each tree, was a t-shirt nailed to it; creating a surrounding audience. The shirts were small, like they'd fit Cooper. Six in total. Vintage, ringer style shirts with red trim and matching red font that read ""Hayward Plunge."" On the inside tags, I could make out handwritten names: John, Henry, Susie, Wayne, Donna, and Jackie.

I had no idea what Hayward Plunge meant or who these names belonged to, but that didn't really matter, I was full on panicking. My fight or flight was in high gear. This wasn't the innocent treasure hunt we thought it would be. This was wrong, very wrong. I was wrong to bring my son here. I played enough high school football to know what dried blood stains looked like on fabric.

I didn't want to let Cooper see the concern on my face, and I knew he was on the verge of asking if we could start digging for the treasure that he thought was beneath us. I needed to get him out of there as soon as possible. I tried to drum up fake enthusiasm and say we needed to celebrate us making it to the finish line. I told him we deserved ice cream for our hard work. He wasn't ready to leave until I told him he could get as many scoops and toppings as he wanted. Luckily, that was enough to get him out of there.

I thought a night of sleep would help distance me from the kid's shirts on the trees, but it didn't. It was on my mind as I got out of bed, and as I made my coffee, and was very prominently on my mind as I stood at the front room window watching my own child play in the front yard. I watched him look under rocks for bugs, and lay in the grass, and eventually check The Greenridge Road Library. Then, I watched him run into the house holding a stack of books.

He proudly laid them out on display. My stomach turned as I realized they were more vintage books. Artwork and color palettes from an era long gone. Titles like ""The Clumsy Cowboy"" and ""Hurry Up, Slowpoke."" I peeked over his shoulder as he grabbed one and skimmed through the pages. On the inside cover, read the generic ""this book belongs to:"" with Wayne scribbled under it.

For the last twenty-four hours, six names have been playing on a loop in my head. Wayne was one of them. I grabbed a different book and opened it: Susie. I didn't need to grab anymore, I already knew what I'd find. But I did anyway. One inside cover after the other; John, then Jackie, then Henry, and finally Donna.

I was ready to tear the Greenridge Road Library out of the ground at this point. I scoured through my Ring notifications. Ever since we installed the library, it seemed like all of Castro Valley stops by and looks through it. I had hundreds of clips of people in front of it. It could have been any one of them. I dissected each clip to see if I could find who left the books. The problem was that the library was positioned in a way that the camera couldn't see if someone was taking or placing books. To be honest, this made me incredibly skeptical of my neighbors. Was it the dad walking his kids? The moms pushing strollers? The dog walker group? The mailman?

I gave up the hunt and set my phone on my lap as the clips continued playing. At this point, I was fully losing it. I don't know why this upset me as much as it did. It's not like someone is putting inappropriate material in the library. No one was committing crimes. It was just weird and creepy. I thought maybe it was an elaborate prank. I was willing to accept it as a prank and move on.

When I picked up my phone, it was halfway through a clip. There was no one in front of the Greenridge Road Library, or my house. So, I was confused as to why this was recorded. Then in the corner of the frame, I noticed an old man, standing across the street, and looking at the library. He remained still for an uncomfortable amount of time before turning and leaving. The video was super grainy and he was so far away that I couldn't make out any details of his face. It felt strange, though. This was enough to make me want to solve all of this, simply so I could feel like my family was safe in our home.

I tried to take inventory of all the information I had. The books, the names, the year on the library card, the coordinates, and the blood stained shirts on the trees. Shirts that had text on them. ""Hayward Plunge."" I typed the phrase into a search bar. The first suggestion was a link to the Hayward Parks and Rec website. To the right of that was a small collage consisting of a map, street view, and picture of the inside of a building.

Built in 1936, the Hayward Plunge is an indoor swimming facility. It's essentially one big pool inside of a hangar-like structure. Additionally, after seeing the map of where the plunge was located, I realized the trail that I was just on the other day, ran directly behind the building. Finally, things were starting to click.

I was waiting at the front desk as the teenager working it went off to get the manager. I felt a little foolish, but at this point, there was no way I could leave this thread loose. The manager came walking up and asked how they could help me. I took a deep breath and made the jump. I explained how I came into possession of Roger Davis's swim instruction book, how it led me to the trail, and to the displayed Hayward Plunge shirts. Which all brought me there to speak with her.I don't know what I was expecting. It was a lot of random information to unload on an unsuspecting stranger. I for sure wasn't expecting the manager's face to drop like it did. She paused for a second, then asked ""Could we talk in my office?""

I took a seat at the desk across from her. She didn't hesitate. She said, ""Back in the day there was a small beginner swimming class that had some students who went missing."" That was chilling enough, but she continued. ""This was in the 60's, so they didn't have camera surveillance or anything like that. The Hayward P.D. didn't have any evidence of who took the kids or where the kids went."" I didn't know what to say. I didn't need to say anything, because she wasn't done. This time needing a little more strength, eventually pushing out, ""It's like, an urban legend around here, so take it with a grain of salt; but people say their swim instructor had something to do with the missing kids."" I could see it in her eyes before her words came out. I knew what was coming next. She looked me dead in the eye and said, ""The instructor, his name.... was Roger.""

Everything was still spinning when I strapped my seatbelt in and it didn’t stop during the drive home. What did I invite to my home? What danger did I put my son in? Who or where was Roger Davis? That last question would be answered a lot quicker than I anticipated.

Waiting for me at our front door, was the gigantic waste of paper that is, the Yellow Pages. It made a huge thud on my kitchen table when I set it down to grab a beer. I could feel it staring at me the whole time. Begging me to open it. I knew I had to, but I really didn't want to. I was already fed up with this whole situation. It had escalated to points that I was not prepared for. I looked back at the yellow pages. It was just sitting there. I took a swig of beer and said fuck it.

I found the residents section and made my way to the names under D. It didn’t take long to put my finger over the first Davis. It was a page over and near the bottom, but there he was. Roger M. Davis. I should have left it there. Cool, I found him. Mission accomplished. I should have taken the win and moved on with my life. But I just couldn't help myself. I needed to know.

I panned to the right of his name, where his address was. I felt my beer rising in my throat as I did. Next to his name and under ""current address"" was, Green Ridge Road.

The scariest house isn't always the one that looks like it. It's not always the dilapidated house with the dead lawn and shady looking tenets who won't make eye contact with you. Sometimes it's the house that's painted in the friendliest shade of soft yellow. The one that has an American flag perfectly flying from the porch. The one with the old man that comes out like clockwork to hand water his lawn. The house that you have no problem sending your kid to their front door for candy on Halloween. What is it they say about book covers?

Roger Davis was arrested for the murders of John and Jackie Miller, ages 9 and 8. Donna Zimmerman, age 7. Wayne Jackson, age 8. Susie Lee, age 8. Henry Parker, age 6. Almost sixty years after he committed the crimes. He was 86 at the time of his arrest.

I gave the police everything I had. They used fingerprints from Henry Parker's copy of ""The Rise and Fall of Ben Gizzard,"" that was left in our library, to match with some found on belongings of his that his diligent mother kept well preserved after all these years. Roger's prints were also a match on all of the kid's books, as well as the ""How to Swim and Dive"" manual we found in our little library.

Cadaver dogs hit on the area of the coordinates and they were able to recover the remains of all the children. My stomach still fills with shame and dread because I willingly brought my son to the burial site. I let him stand feet above the bones of murdered children as we played around on a pretend scavenger hunt.

We were in the middle of dinner weeks later when I heard the sirens. Flashing lights followed, reflecting off our walls. Our street doesn't get police activity very often, if at all. I knew who they were coming for.

It took me a couple of minutes to walk down my street and get to the house surrounded by the crime scene tape. As I approached, two officers walked out a slightly hunched, white-haired man, in handcuffs. He looked frail and confused, and unremarkable from any other elderly person in the community. He wasn't someone who looked like they would be getting arrested. The policemen closed the squad door behind him, regardless.

I observed him as he sat in the backseat of the cop car. He wasn't moving at all and he was seemingly focused on the nothingness in front of him. He stayed like this for an uncomfortable amount of time.

An officer told me he couldn't share any information on the case, not knowing that I was the one who revived the six cold cases with my findings. There wasn't much more for me to see, and it felt like it was time for me to head back home.

I looked one more time at Roger. I just wanted to burn into my eyes what evil could look like, so I never put my son in danger ever again. After a few seconds, the vile old man slowly started to turn his whole body towards the window. Towards me.

His face was blank and devoid of any humanity. He pointed his vacant and dark eyes at me. I could see the faintest bit of recognition from him once he saw me. I didn't want to look away. I didn't want to give him the satisfaction of seeing fear on someone one last time. Even if I was terrified inside.

My last glimpse of him, before the car hauled him away, was the slow movement of his mouth forming the slightest, perverted, grin. He was enjoying this. He knew that he'd die soon, and he'd essentially got away with his crimes. I don't think that's what made him smile in that moment, though.

He knew that I'd see him again. Every time I watched someone leave a book in the Green Ridge Road Library for Cooper, or when Cooper's baseball coach pulls him aside to give him tips on his swing, or when I had parent-teacher conferences and met Cooper's teachers. He knew that I'd see him in every one of those people that I was trusting to be around my son.

He knew that's how he would live on.",1,1730138081.0,Creepystories,0,1.0,False

I [M/NB24] have been on one date in my entire life and moved to a new country about a month ago. Recently, I met this girl [F26] from that country who studies at the same university in a large lecture-type class, the last class of the semester. We had some mutual connections and had texted back and forth a bit a few days before but hadn't talked in person until the class. Since we study in different programs and our classes (other than this one lecture) are usually in different buildings, she messaged me first the day after and asked if she would see me again. Since I found her attractive and it's unlikely we would run into each other after this class, I suggested we get a coffee a few days later (but didn't call it a date, because I don't know what she thought and I'm usually pretty slow with these things.)

The first red flag for me was that she said she basically had no money and asked me to pay for her coffee. I've had friends before who don't have a lot of money and I have absolutely no judgment about that (and it's believable enough in this case), but they still usually pay for themselves - I live in an expensive country but she did ask for one of the cheapest coffees on the menu. If we called this a date I would be more OK with it, but since we were (on the surface) just meeting as friends, it was a bit of a turn-off.

It turned out that she's also single - we talked a lot at the cafe but even though I could keep up the conversation easily, I didn't enjoy the flow of it. I've always had more close female friends than male friends and what I always appreciated about them is that we could leave space for each other's viewpoints and perspectives, rather than just agreeing with the other person. Honestly, the whole conversation just felt a bit fake - and since she grew up in my home country for a few years and spoke warmly about it (where I had similar conversations with ""friends""), it reminded me of what I had decided to leave for good reason.

Since then, she's been messaging me a few times - and while she hasn't explicitly said that she's interested in me, we both essentially talked about considering a relationship and I know from her own words that she likes my personality. I find her attractive, as I already mentioned, and I do think she has the right values in general, but given my experience, I'm not sure if I should give her another chance or just listen to what my gut is saying and gently tell her it won't work out.

1ge8f5q,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1ge8f5q/cannot_stand_my_roommate_anymore/,Cannot stand my roommate anymore,"When I first moved in with my new roommate, I thought I’d hit the jackpot. The rent was reasonable, the place was cozy, and she seemed nice enough during our initial meeting. She was friendly and chatty, sending me recommendations for local coffee shops and even offering to introduce me to some of her friends. But once I actually moved in, things took a turn for the worse.

My roommate had an obsession with candles. Not just a candle here or there, but candles everywhere. She’d light them constantly and then leave the apartment, forgetting about them. I’d come home from class to find candles melting away on tables, bookshelves, and sometimes even the floor. Each time I’d blow them out, I couldn’t help but wonder if she was intentionally trying to set the place on fire.

Then there was her strange schedule. She didn’t seem to have any regular commitments, so she’d sleep all day and come alive at night, binge-watching reality TV at top volume. I’d try to sleep, but her nightly commentary on whatever drama was unfolding would echo through the thin walls. I tried earplugs, white noise, everything—but her voice cut right through.

Things got worse when my food started disappearing. At first, it was just a yogurt or a granola bar, but soon whole meals I’d prepped for the week would vanish. I tried labeling things, hoping she’d get the hint, but she’d just peel off the labels and continue eating whatever she wanted, like it was no big deal.

One weekend, I went out of town to visit family, and when I returned, I found my room door open and my clothes scattered everywhere. Some of my favorite sweaters were missing, and her strong perfume scent was all over the room. When I asked her about it, she just laughed, saying she “borrowed” a few things for a night out.

The last straw came when I got home late from studying to find my room overrun with her friends. She’d decided to throw a party and use my bed as extra seating. Strangers were lounging around, and my books were being used as coasters. When I confronted her, she just shrugged, saying, “Oh, sorry, didn’t know you’d be back so soon.”

I need some advice forreal before I try and break my lease. ",8,1730137860.0,badroommates,9,0.9,False

1ge8buc,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1ge8buc/the_dreams_of_hyacinth_redux_preview/,The Dreams of Hyacinth (redux) Preview,"Nick made his way up the stairs, out of the transit station, trying to look inconspicuous. Just another commuter going to work right? Nothing strange about that. He tried to ignore his headache. It wasn't working.



Out in public, the scars on the back of his neck, hidden under his collar itched. All of his implants were colored to look like skin, and the blending was admirable, but he still felt exposed walking around. He seemed to have lost Houndstooth forces for now, but who knows how long before he'd be noticed again. For the fifth time he checked his camera hacks. It looked like the code Queenie copied for him worke; when he peered in on the camera lines, he didn't see himself. He couldn't be invisible, that would have been too obvious. Instead he had replaced himself with a composite based off of a bunch of media he had downloaded two nights ago. He looked generically male shaped, generically handsome and generically dressed.



The very illegal submachine gun strapped to his back under his coat, and the very *very* illegal crystal memory cube in his belt pack weighed heavily and reminded him that he was not very generic at all.



He went to a coffee cart and got a flat white. He wasn't really thirsty, but a coffee would give his hands something to do while he walked, so he didn't fidget. Cradling the hot coffee in both hands to warm them - Hyacinth was a controlled environment, but it was also old enough that they adjusted the temperature for Earth based seasons. It was 'winter' and while nobody would die of exposure on Hyacinth, it was still colder than Nick preferred. It never got this cold on Parvati.



As Nick walked around Congregation Square trying to look inconspicuous and hide from Houndstooth, he sat down on a bench - leaning forward a little so the gun didn't hit the back of the bench - across from a merchant. They sold beverages of all different kinds, human, k'laxi, Sef, and others. People were walking in and out carrying small paper bags. Maybe he'd gotten away with it. Maybe he'd actually lost them.



Far in the distance a siren started. It had a piercing, long wail. It was mechanical, or made to sound mechanical. As soon as it started, others joined in, making a massive minor chord wall of sound. It was loud, it was worrying. It was meant to be. Nick wasn't the only one who didn't know what it meant, but he was probably one of the only people in Congregation who could query a KB real-time and ask what it was.



**Spin Alarm**, was what came back. Details, he thought.



The KB began to rattle off a canned explanation. When Hyacinth was so old that it was built before gravity manipulation. To get around that small detail, originally the Orbital spun, so that centripetal force made ersatz gravity. It wasn't gravity, and didn't feel like it, but it was better than nothing. There was a link to a raft of very old welcome articles that explained how to deal with centripetal force and what to do about nausea and how most people got over it within the first week of arrival. As soon as humans learned how to manipulate gravity, Hyacinth was spun down and remained stationary.



That didn't mean the spin engines were removed however.



They could pivot and move in nearly every direction. On the rare occasions that Hyacinth needed to change position or orbit, they could be repurposed. Plus, it was expensive to remove them, and Houndstooth wouldn't spend that kind of money unless they had a good reason.



Just as they were designed to do nearly a thousand years ago, the spin engines on High Mars Hyacinth fired. Being a cylinder sixty miles by twenty meant that - at first - other than a low rumble and a jolt, there was no change. After a minute or two though, Nick looked up and saw the stars start to move. The ever present crescent of Mars below started to move out of the current glass panel and into the next.



Human balance is sensitive. K'laxi is more, but he wasn't around any at the time. As soon as the spin started, Nick felt weird. It was like that carnival ride he rode when he visited that fair on Parvati with his parents when he was small. His inner ear began to argue with his eyes about where 'up' was. He looked down at his coffee, and the liquid in the cup began to slosh oddly, and *very slightly* start to lean to one side. If it was happening this fast, then the spin engines were thrusting hard. As hard as a Starjumper maybe. Nick queried the KB again and it helpfully mentioned that they could thrust at up to ten gees on when set to Emergency Stop. Nick didn't think there was an Emergency Start, but who knows. The KB wasn't sure either.



In the time it took Nick to query the KB, things got worse. People started to stagger, and some fell to their knees. A K'laxi wearing an embassy uniform fell to their knees and vomited. After, they began a keening wail that Nick had never come out of a K'laxi's mouth before. They were clearly in distress. Nick stood to try and help them, but was overcome with waves of dizziness and his own nausea. He sat down hard on the ground and laid on his back. That made it better.



""Nick! Nick!"" His comm chirruped. ""Nick, answer dammit."" It was Eastern.



""Eastern? Where are you? I thought Jameson had you.""



""He did. I talked my way out.""



Even this uncomfortable, Nick felt incredulous. Jameson was Hyacinth's most notorious gang leader. You didn't 'talk your way out' of his clutches. ""Tell me later. Someone is spinning Hyacinth up, are you safe?""



""Safe? Sure I'm safe. I'm in the Basement.""



The illegal moving bazaar in the underground maintenance tunnels? ""How are you able to reach me on comm? The Basement usually has a comm block.""



""Well for one, I'm using your implant line instead of your comm line."" She said ""And for two, I have root, so I was able to go around the block.""



Root? How did she... No, another thing for later. ""Well, can you tell who turned on the spin engines? Everyone down here in Congregation is doing poorly. Most everyone is laying on the ground, waiting for the world to stop moving."" Nick also didn't mention that they were all starting to feel heavier too. The spin engines were designed to spin Hyacinth up to one gee equivalent, but the gravity generators had already had everything up to a gee. If the engines continued, everyone would feel two gees, and while that's survivable by k'laxi, it won't be without injury if they fall wrong. For the humans it will be mightily unpleasant.



""Millisec, I'll see."" A pause. ""Nick, it looks like the command was sent from the Houndstooth Command Center. They turned it on themselves!""



What? It was their station, of course they had access to ""Why?"" Nick said aloud.



""The orders don't say, but I'll give you two guesses.""



As soon as Eastern had finished transmitting, Nick heard a rhythmic clanking. He turned his head, and fighting waves of nausea he saw three Houndstooth 'customer protection technicians' in powered armor clomp around the square. They had blackened visors, and their rifles were in their hands. As they walked they looked over everyone as a mini drone hovered behind. Nick could feel it scanning, but it hadn't reached him yet. They turned on the spin to make everyone stop moving, so they could find someone! Talk about overkill. The gun on Nick's back itched. If they scanned and caught it, he was dead - and that was one of the more positive outcomes. Nick had to be somewhere else, *now*. If he got to his feet though, he'd give himself away to the CPTs. ""Eastern! I've got CPTs nearby. They have a drone and it's scanning people."" he thought over the comm.



""Already? Fuck. Nick, they must have knew where you were and were just trying to hold you. Talk about overkill though.""



""Later, Eastern! What do I do?""



""You have your sub right? You could shoot your way out."" She could feel Nick's expression over the comm and quickly said ""kidding, kidding. Hold please."" While Nick waited, he dared not look at the CPTs clomping around, but he could hear the whine of their servos and the thump of their boots as they moved and stopped, and moved and stopped. It seemed like they were checking everyone. If they knew he was here, why didn't they just come towards him?



Because his hack had worked, he realized. He'll have to thank Queenie later - if he survives. He heard more of that odd keening wail from k'laxi further away from him, and that caught the attention of the CPTs. They walked over to check them out. Nick couldn't believe they were checking out of concern, but that did mean he was right to not make his image on the cameras to be k'laxi.



There was a commotion from the k'laxi, and a odd shout, and then the CPTs yelled and started chattering among themselves. Before Nick could figure out what was going on, there was a deep thump, and he felt a shockwave. Had one of the k'laxi thrown a grenade? Nick knew that their civil war was ongoing, and that there were reports on the news of it being very brutal, but he had no idea that the war had come to Hyacinth. By the alarmed sounds of the CPTs, they hadn't realized it either. One of them had triggered their assistance siren, and the other's suit was yelling 'medic! medic! medic!' over and over again.



""psst!"" Nick turned his head, pushed down the wave of dizziness that accompanied it, and saw a gardening robot peer out from underneath a large potted tree. ""Get over here!"" It was speaking in Eastern's voice.



Without checking to see if the CPTs were busy, Nick half rolled, half undulated towards the opening under the tree. Without grace, he felt down the hatch and landed on his back a couple meters down, knocking the breath out of him. Now, he was dizzy from the centripetal force and the fall. Coughing, he tried to sit up and push past the dizziness. Next to him was a gardening cart, and the little bot was waving a small spade from the front. ""Taxi's here Nick! Get your rear in gear!""



He pushed himself to his hands and knees and flopped onto the cart. With an electric whine and a strong smell of ozone, it started to move away - slower because of the high gravity.



Nick kept his eyes shut. It was easier that way. ""Eastern, one, thank you for the rescue. Two, where are we going?""



""You're welcome Nicholas North, and I'm taking you to the Basement. I've got some friends down here and they can help.""



""Were these the same ""friends"" that let you get into Houndstooth CIC? How did you know what they were doing?"" Nick's voice warbled as the car raced over bumps and gaps in the paneling.



""I told you Nick, I had root. Don't worry about it. You'll be here soon and we can work out next steps. You have the memory crystal?"" Eastern sounded distracted.



She was deflecting. ""Yes, I have it."" Nick didn't say anything else, but a knot grew in his stomach. Eastern was doing things she shouldn't be able to do, and none of her answers about why she could do that were satisfying.

1ge88ap,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ayurveda/comments/1ge88ap/ayurvedic_gerd_cure/,Ayurvedic GERD Cure,"This is a long, detailed post. It outlines how I, male late 20s / early 30s, overcame GERD (following clinical diagnosis) in 15 months. The cures outlined are derived from traditional Indian / Ayurvedic medicine and studies. Good luck to everyone, wish you lots of healing. I am not a doctor so please consult with a professional as needed.

I was diagnosed by gastroenterologists (multiple) and told I would be on meds for the rest of my life. I spent hours studying natural cures and speaking to doctors around the world, and have summarized in the post below.

Given GERD results from weakening of lower esophagus sphincter, the cure focused on giving time for the sphincter to heal by 1) quoting the area with protective items (eg cow ghee) 2) reducing acid production in the stomach by eliminating acidic foods and 3) doing yoga to heal the impacted area. Causes of my GERD were likely stress and excess spice.

**Summary**

1. Hot water with organic cow ghee every morning (empty stomach) and night (last thing before going to bed)
2. Homeopathic medicine three times a day, as prescribed by homeopath
3. Fresh organic red cabbage and carrot juice every morning for 3 months. Juiced myself.
4. Significant shift in diet, led to weight loss. Quit alcohol. Detail below.
5. Smaller meals, equal to 1 cup or less
6. Yoga every morning focused on stomach strengthening and digestive poses
7. Sleeping on incline mattress, at least 2-3 hours after eating
8. Lot of meditation and focusing energy on digestive tract and stomach
9. Chew food properly. Don’t need to overdo it but I used to inhale food prior to my diagnosis. This was not good.

**Natural meds / other meds**

* Homeopathy - Please find a naturopath or homeopath near you - there are tons of homeopathic medicines designed to treat GERD and the medicine prescribed will depend on your specific symptoms, age, etc. I took daily for 15 months.
* Deglycerolized licorice root: took before most meals, helps quote stomach to protect from acidity. Available on Amazon and completely natural. I used DGL whenever I got acidity, it helped soothe things.
* Gaviscon if acidity got bad
* I did NOT use any Omeprazole / anti acid as once you start this, it is very difficult to get off. All my western doctors pushed me towards anti-acids but I refused after researching online.

**Morning routine**

* On empty stomach, have hot water (50 ml) with organic Cow ghee (clarified butter) (quarter tea spoon) mixed into it (took with Manuka honey to help with flavor). I boiled water and added ghee to let it mix in. This helps quote your esophagus and protects it from reflux for the day. VERY important. I did this every day.
* Then 20 mins later, freshly juiced red cabbage and carrot juice - red cabbage has shown to help with GERD and carrot is to help with flavor. I did this every day for the first 3 months.
* Then in the morning, yoga stomach strengthening / clearing poses (help a lot if you do regularly). You can find these on YouTube. I did this every day and continue to - you will need to find exercises that work for you.
* My typical breakfast was two boiled eggs (no yolk)

**Throughout the day**

* Sip hot water throughout the day, will help a lot in managing reflux. When you have reflux, your body is producing a lot of acid and as a result, excess heat. Pouring cold water / drink on it is harmful (think of how a hot pan sizzles if you pour cold water on it). Hot water will make you feel better.
* Eat small meals. Each meal (liquid + solids) should be less than the size of a cup.
* No water before or after eating for 45 minutes. Water mixes with food and comes up as acidity. Even now, I don’t drink water for up to 2 hours after eating
* My typical lunch was grilled wild caught salmon with organic grilled veggies. Olive oil and salt for seasoning.
* For snack, I would have organic plain Greek yogurt mixed with pure Manuka honey (can find on Amazon, Manuka honey helps with digestive trac). I would also have this if I was feeling burning in my chest.

**In the night**

* Drink hot water with organic cow ghee (quarter tea spoon) as last item at night. This will protect your esophagus from acidity overnight. VERY important.
* Eat 2-3 hours before sleeping
* Sleep on an incline matters. Can buy a mattress incliner from Amazon - this is very helpful and ensures acid formed overnight stays in your stomach. I bought a 7 inch incliner from Amazon.
* My typical dinner was grilled seafood or freshly made vegetable soup (made myself) with toast and olive oil and fresh cheeses

**Things I ate** \- ate different combinations (cooked, raw, grilled) of the below. Did NOT deviate at all. All organic / wild caught. I was obviously not getting enough calories / lost muscle but this was a sacrifice I was willing to make.

* Seafood - Salmon, Shrimp, mussels, etc⁃ Eggs
* White rice
* Whole wheat bread
* Ginger
* Vegetables - I was generally ok with all veggies except ones that are acidic like onion garlic tomato
* Cheese
* Olive oil
* Avocado oil
* Salt
* Oregano
* Basil
* Parsley
* Fruits (found banana causes reflux but apple worked well)
* NO alcohol - I quit drinking

**Diet timeline**

* First 8 months, I strictly followed the above diet. Did not deviate at all (potentially once a month but wouldn’t feel great). Lost 15 pounds.
* After 8 months, I started deviating from the above diet once a week to reintroduce foods
* After 15 months, I am now eating everything, but limit coffee to once a week. I still sip hot water throughout the day and have cow ghee with water whenever I get acidity. Symptoms come once in a while if I overeat.
* I always wait 2.5 hours after eating before going to bed. I think this is one of the most important things to do.

**Exercises / meditation**

* Yoga as mentioned above
* Meditation. Focusing your energy on your esophagus / sphincter.
* I stopped lifting weights for the first 8 months as working out squeezes your stomach and acid comes up. I am now lifting and running again.

**Progression**

* First 5 months were tough. I was getting acid reflux after eating. I had a lot of hot water to manage this. Meditation helped a lot
* After 6 months, I started noticing improvements. Continued following diet.⁃ 9 months later, my doctor ordered an endoscopy. Came back completely normal.
* In month 10, my homeopath advised that I continue with homeopathy but gradually return to a more normal diet
* Now in month 15, I am eating everything but still no alcohol. I continue doing yoga exercises and keep up with the meditation. Overcoming GERD is possible. I am sure there are multiple ways to do it and I am describing one. Good luck and hope this helps.",2,1730137378.0,Ayurveda,0,1.0,False

But… slowly, I started feeling the other side of it. 🌫️ I wake up, sit in front of my computer, and stay there until evening. Some days, I realize I haven’t spoken to a single person outside of Zoom calls. Most of my notifications? Work-related. It’s like I’m missing out on real, everyday interactions that ground me.



It’s getting heavy. I feel almost like a “ghost” in my own social life. I’ll see people grabbing coffee together or chatting in a park, and it seems almost surreal, like something I barely remember doing myself.



**Has anyone else been through this? How do you keep some kind of balance?**



I’ve tried a few things—like working in cafes or checking out coworking spaces—but either I can’t focus, or I end up just as isolated, headphones on, lost in work. I love my job and I don’t really want to go back to an office full-time, but I’m wondering if I’m missing out on something really important here.



If you have any advice, hacks, or similar experiences to share, I’d really appreciate it. 🙏 Does this happen to you too, and how do you handle the isolation?",1,1730137357.0,remotework,8,0.57,False

1ge850f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Poems/comments/1ge850f/sir_apollo_and_lady_luna/,Sir Apollo and Lady Luna,"Do you know what my favorite time of day is? It's the time of Twilight. No not the twilight of the middle of the middle of the night. The twilight of the Morning Dawn and the Setting Dusk. Insight. 

We've worked every time shift under the sun and stars. We've worked in the smeltering heat putting up fences, removing trees, creating Hiking trails from our time in the C's. We've opened and closed with our coworkers in the stores and resteraunts we've worked just to continue to make money. 

But even though life gets difficult, especially in our own mind, one of the things we've always enjoyed is quite simply the Twilight. 

We like to refer to the Sun as Sir Apollo. His brightness shines on this earth allowing for everyone's day-to-day. Illuminating paths for everyone to take. And then there's the Moon, or as I like to call her Lady Luna. She shines beautifully when the world is hard to see. Much like a nightlight that needs to be charged once in a while. She watches the people of the night scamper and spree, but shows them the prettier things that are up there with her, making it worth while.

So why these 2 times in particular and what's the connection? You might like this one dear reader and maybe you'll understand the reflection.

During the times of Dawn and Dusk there's a moment you might find beautiful. Luna and Apollo get to see each other as their lights begin to shed on this world. Just as Apollo creeps over the horizon, groggy and needing his coffee, he gets up slowly over the horizon but still simply grovels happily, good morning. Lady Luna rarely gets to see him during the day, but she does get to see him during both ends of this frey.

Lady Luna has her phases to be sure, but this is why we say Darkness doesn't lie, it's just harder to see more. See, Luna's phases don't coincide simply intentionally, her brightness might fade but her energy stays the same. She goes from full, to half, to quarter, to none. But let's be real, much like Apollo, Luna's job is never done. She sometimes needs to rest, hence the phases in her light. But no matter what Apollo sees her always, no matter how bright.

Working night shifts I couldn't help but find beauty staring up at the moon, Luna shining down and watching over all as Apollo sleeps. Before going into work I'd watch Apollo begin to set and Luna rising above, her brightness very faint but still showing as she creeps-awake.

At the end of these shifts, this is where the best part is, I'd get to watch Apollo creep over the hillside and say, hello. True Bliss.

The colors that shine over everything during these times are truly beautiful to see. Dark blue, purple, red, orange, then yellow. And then the reverse the can be. (Bet you don't know why the sun sets red) Yeah...hehe, that's exactly something that echoes in my head.

My favorite times of day are always Twilight, and that's a beautiful sight, maybe take a look the next time you feel the same when your stuck in your mind. (Hehe right). Luna's pull is always around, and Apollos rays never truly dim. Seeing these moments in time always make us stim. Even when storm clouds cover both, they can't fully block out the rays ever ""fin."" 

So the next time you look up and get blinded by both, just say hi to them, they're only here to help.

When we were younger, we both did I share of drinking and drugging. I stopped years ago when OUR children were small because of the bad exposure and danger that comes along with drug use. He did not, we soon separated and has been for many years. He decided after decades to get clean. From all of the years of drug use he had no other person that would show up for him and support him through this tough time. Being his wife still, I stepped up to help him. I went to meetings and church services all the things he needed to get clean I was there for. Moving on to the dumping. When he got out of rehab, he spent the first week asleep on my sofa. No, we were not a couple at this time. He did nothing to get himself back on track, only eating all the kids snacks and sleeping he didn't even shower often. He also had a seizer at least once a week from the shock to his body from years of drug use. They were so bad he would go to the bathroom on himself. After a few months of this and my home starting to smell from his body funk and the strong smell of urine from the seizers. He began to scare the kids when he would seize.  By now I had enough of coming home from a 12-hour shift to find him asleep on my sofa. I had to stop the kids from coming over because he put them in danger, by leaving things out that the small kids could get into and hurt themselves. I asked him to leave when he left some laundry pods in a coffee cup with water on the computer table and my one-year-old grandson drank it and had to be rushed to the hospital.

The line was long with neighbors in need, people living on the streets and day laborers last Monday for a community meal at Fisherman’s Park hosted by Food Not Bombs Reno.  
  
With the weather turning, tea, coffee, and cocoa were served along with hot food and winter jackets. There was also a strawberries and cream dessert handed out.  
  
Pet food was available to feed the many furry friends and companions also showing up.   
  
It was this same group which was run down by David Turner driving a car at a second location they used to serve food at and hand out donations in April 2023, outside the Cares Campus.  One unhoused woman was killed, and two of their volunteers were seriously injured.  Turner has since been sentenced to life without parole.  
  
Griffin Peralta u/griffinspiration (in red shirt in photos), a teacher who has been volunteering for the organization for almost ten years, explains that more people come to the gathering as it gets later in the month. This is due to an “inverse relationship to food stamps and SNAP,” Peralta says.  
  
SNAP short for the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program provides food benefits to low-income families to supplement their grocery budget.  
  
“For us, we’re out here every week, doing this thing, having dinner with people, specifically to be in solidarity with folks that we feel the government is letting down,” Peralta said.  
  
He says this Reno chapter of Food Not Bombs sprung from the Occupy Wall Street movement which started in 2011.   
  
Peralta makes a clear distinction that, rather than a hierarchical top-down charity approach, Food Not Bombs pursues solidarity by “meeting people where they’re at.”

1ge7x8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1ge7x8z/is_he_interested_in_me_or_am_i_reading_too_much/,is he interested in me or am I reading too much into it?,"I feel like he's interested in me but with my low esteem, I can't get my brain to believe me and I would appreciate your lovely internet stranger opinions on it. 

I am interested in a shy and introverted guy with little to no dating experience. We're friends and I get the idea he's interested in me but I'm worried I'm reading too much into it. I also have no prior dating experience and am also shy and introverted with low self esteem. 

Here are a few things I've noticed: 

\-he gets nervous and stumbles over his words sometimes 

\-he tells me personal things about his family and childhood

\-he overshares when he's with me to the point of embarrassing himself 

\-he stares at me when he thinks I'm not looking

\-(I think) I've seen him checking me out 

\-when we have to say goodbye there is always an awkward moment with some staring like we're waiting for the other person to do something. 

\-he doesn't mind me getting in his personal space, like 30 cm or standing against each other

\-if he's eating something he'll offer me some and he'll help me make my coffee

\-he's adamant on remembering when my birthday is (he's bad with remembering dates) and freaked out the other day when he thought he forgot it

\-he tries to show off his strength/speed/skill/knowledge where applicable 

\-he'll make eye contact with me across the room for a bit then smile and look down/away or he'll jokingly quirk his eyebrows at me if we make eye contact. 

\-he points out our height difference and has affectionately called me 'travel size'

\-I think I've seen him express jealousy when I'm talking to other guys, I've seen him side eye them subtly and the other day, a guy I just met gave me a hug, so when I said goodbye to my crush he hugged me in the exact way the new guy hugged me and he's never initiated that before. it gives me the idea he felt pressured to do it because he saw the other guy hugging me. he also assumes all of my friends are female. 

\-he banters with me in a way that can be considered flirting 

\-he's told me that he feels uncomfortable talking to other people but feels comfortable talking to me. 

\-we'll stand very close to each other even when there's enough space to stand further apart 

\-he seems like an extrovert around me but an introvert around other people

\-he's conscious about my safety/wellbeing 

\-he's the only person I know that actually checks my social media updates 

BUT on the other hand...

\-he doesn't initiate conversations over text, but when I text first he responds within the same day and we'll have a decent conversation 

\-he's not very keen to share emotional stuff

\-he rarely initiates physical contact but he doesn't seem uncomfortable if I do it

\-he has trouble making friends and we would likely have never talked to each other if I didn't talk to him first

1ge7w5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/philmont/comments/1ge7w5y/july_trek_video/,July Trek Video,"Our troop had two crews go this summer (boys and girls) and I went along as one of the advisors with my son. I make a bunch of videos for my hikes and climbs in WA state so also made a video of our trip to share with our entire troop and thought you guys might enjoy it as well.

[Philmont Trek 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyqIi80NIu0)

Trip report for those interested in the details:  
  
The scouts picked a pretty aggressive trek (12-25), with 75 miles and a climb of Little Costilla. We had 7 scouts and 3 advisors. Several of our scouts were very experienced hikers, and we had a few that really hustled to get ready on our prep hikes. One of my concerns going into the trip was whether everyone would be able to carry their + group gear but that ended up not being a major issue as the more fit scouts competed on how much weight they could carry. We did end up with several scouts with pretty bad blisters on a couple of days.

The biggest challenge ended up being team cohesion and morale. There were several challenging evenings when it took us a long time to get everything done so we were going to bed late. A part of this was that we only had 3 prep hikes and never really had the whole group together, another big part was scouts finishing their part and then giving up instead of helping out and making sure everything was done.

Weather was also a bigger factor than expected. We had to go into lighting positions a few times. Once right when we got to camp (Pueblano) before we setup. Rangers ended up calling a bunch of us over to the porch where we waited out a lot of the storm, then ended up setting up our tents in a dry spot under a tree before moving them out. Second time was in the middle of our hike to Middle Ponil, didn't last long and the rest of the hike was dry. Then we got major hail right during dinner at Chase Cow, luckily everyone got under the dining fly (except the cook who used my umbrella). That ended in time for us to go play cowball. Finally, we got more rain and hail on our hike out.

We almost ended up losing gear to a major windstorm at Ring Place right as we got there and were trying to set up camp. It got bad enough that we abandoned the setup, put all the loose tents under a tree under our heavy packs and had to wait for the wind to die down before we could resume.

We brought our own tents: 2 REI Halfdome SL2+, and one SL3+ for the scouts. Adults had solo tents (Tarptent moment and 2x Big Agnes Copper Spurs) which worked out great. For our dining fly, I brought a Warbonnet Thunderfly, which was a little smaller than the dining fly that Philmont provides but significantly lighter, and it worked out great, we fit everyone under it a couple of times, raising up the corners with hiking poles really helped to increase the area under it. 

We did bring a water filter but never ended up using it. Most of the camps had water buffaloes and some had potable water. Our first dry camp was supposed to be Beatty Lakes but we camped right by a water wheel and it was windy so fresh pumped water. Second dry camp was Rabbit Ear, but that was just up the hill from Dan Beard so we carried extra water from there. One mistake we made was throwing away the used tablet pouches, keep those and then trade them in for fresh ones. Worst looking water was the creek at Middle Ponil: slightly green, and there were tons of cows around. Worst tasting was Indian Writings.

For coffee, I brought a Jetboil, a bunch of instant options (REI has Verve which has several good flavors, and Alpine Start), and some [pouches](https://anchorheadcoffee.com/collections/all/products/steeped-narwha) from a local coffee roaster for lazier mornings.

The food wasn't as bad as I expected and the whole cooking process ended up working out great. We got the Fozzils folding bowls, our scouts always ate all the food, scraped the pot really well and licked the bowls clean so cleanup was usually easy. A lot of the peanut and cheese options were traded in. The spam was pretty bad until we started cooking it in a Jetboil, then it was a hit.

The programs ended up being the best part. Chickens at Rich Cabins were a surprising hit. All the climbing flavors: bouldering, spar-pole climbing, and top roping, were a lot of fun. Mountain biking at Ring place got rained out right as we started in the evening so we did it in the morning. Railroading and blacksmithing at Metcalf station went too fast. The Petroglyph tour at Indian Writings was also great, not something I expected, but the rangers there were hilarious characters (taught our scouts to act like chimpanzees any time they saw the Ranch pickups and they did that for the rest of the trip). The 3 campfires on the trail were a definite highlight, my favorite was the porch program at Rich Cabins.

The hardest part of the hiking was our day hike up Little Costilla. We had a long hike the day before and it took us a while to find a good site at Middle Ponil: all the flat areas are pretty rough so we ended up going pretty high on the hillside where there's what looked like an old road-bed, but that meant that getting water required a steep hike back up from the creek. On our way in, we also chatted with another crew who had attempted Little Costilla that day (first day it was open) and had turned around because of the weather.  
  
We woke up early and started moving right at first light (5:15am) since we had a hard turn-around time of noon. Instead of going back down to the trail we went cross country up to a higher road which worked out great since we could stop at a campground for a bathroom break. We followed roads to the trailhead where we had breakfast at 7:20am, then followed the barbed wire (which is a real hazard in places, we had an advisor trip and get a nasty scratch) up. There are some really steep sections at the start, but then it levels out more. We hit the saddle around 10:30am, it was super windy here but we could see the summit (or what we thought was the summit). Staying lower down to the right kept us out of the worst of the wind. There are several false summits here so the last part felt like it took forever but we ended up all making it up just before the cutoff. Downhill from the summit there's a little rock wall where we had a snack (with hot coffee for the adults :D) and then headed down just as there were some scary clouds blowing in. This was a real achievement for several of our crew as they kept going despite their obvious exhaustion. Beef stroganoff around a campfire back at camp never tasted so good.

One big lowlight was the trails: a lot of the hiking, especially in the Valle, is on active or former roads which is not really exciting as it's not really wild. Also, lots of fences and cows to deal with, so feels like you're hiking in someone's backyard. There were some pretty views but not compared to WA. Some of our training trips a couple of hours from Seattle were much grander vistas, especially next to the Enchantments.

I brought a bunch of gear to document the trip and most of it did not survive. Since a lot of our trip was in the Valle Vidal (national forest), I brought a drone after emailing Philmont rangers and calling the Valle office. It was a DJI Mini 3 Pro so small, light, and not very loud once it's up in the air. It managed to barely handle the winds on top of Little Castilla so I got some cool footage there. On the hike back, one of our scouts raised his pole as I was doing a flyover and the drone crashed into that and broke a couple of the propeller blades. Then I crashed it into a bush doing a spin around a tree and busted the gimbal. The main video device was an Osmo Pocket 3, a small gimballed video camera. I managed to drop this at the start of the trip and bent the head a little but it kept working until I dropped it in a creek on the second to last day and didn't realize it until 10 mins later. The backup device was a GoPro 11 which I used during rainy weather and for the last couple of days. Ended up with 200 GBs of files. (The drone and Pocket 3 both had accident coverage through DJI so got replaced through that once I got home.) For batteries, I had the 3 drone batteries, then a 20 Ah and 10 Ah power banks. I charged using the drone batteries at the start (since I couldn't fly the drone on Philmont property and the batteries automatically discharge a small amount anyways), then the power banks at the end. Ended with 30% on my 20Ah bank. I left a bunch of gear under my tent fly and the hail on the last night at Chase Cow splashed up a ton of wet sand all over it so the 20Ah bank died several days later as well.",4,1730136548.0,philmont,0,1.0,False

1ge7ulm,https://www.reddit.com/r/legendaryjourneys/comments/1ge7ulm/journey/,Journey ,"Here are all my curious thoughts (not criticisms or nitpicks) for young Hercules throughout the series

Couldn't find a young Hercules SR:

Young Hercules movie 7:51 first time ares underestimates his brother won’t be the last

Wasn’t alcemene blonde

Ig recasts happen

13:22 on hercules alcemene always seemed like she liked Zeus and always told herc to give him a chance so it’s surprising she said for Hercules to let Zeus go

The accent is new

51:17 Yvenna? Oh i thought that was Lilith I wonder what happened to yvenna and why Hercules never mentions her in the future 

Would think the first loss of a friend would be mentioned more

1:16:35 nvm so that’s why dang that’s unfortunate 

I thought Jason first got the fleece with the argonauts 

Ian bohen does resemble Kevin more I get why he was recast I am surprised they didn’t keep the hair brown for gosling 
Maybe he dyed his hair or it just changed color overtime idk

S1e2: on the main hercules show isn’t it implied that they met when iolas was a thief at his young hercules age but on here he said they always knew each other idk

Ig knowing each other and being friends is different 

16:59 is that where xena got it from 😅

S1e5: I thought hercules first time meeting amazons was in the movie hercules and the amazons 

19:45 queen cyane like from the Siberian amazons 

S1e3: 9:33 when ares was on xena with Horace he acted like he never saw a dog before turns out he has

S1e8: Hercules show never specified his relationship to hades I always thought they were brothers ig now I know hades is his uncle

S1e9: most laid back amazons in this universe 

S1e17: 2:06 I thought hercules invented the Olympics as an adult

Wonder why hercules never mentions them again or why the other gods don’t pick on them like they do with Hercules maybe it’s cuz they don’t have powers idk

S1e15: 1:36 man ares’s laugh always gets me for some reason 😂

Does zeus’s other half mortal kids have that same protection order?

S1e16: 9:07 wasn’t coffee mentioned being invented in Hercules I think from falafel

17:16 clearly being with mortals didn’t teach Hephaestus much since he tried to kill xena’s baby

S1e19: why not change eurydice back

S1e18: 2:41 “I wish I was a prince”

Herc u are a prince 

Why does young Hercules get his own theme why not reuse adult Herc’s theme is it cuz he’s not that hero yet idk
 
S1e22: I thought Hercules said nemesis was his first love but seems like he’s had first loves before her with eurydice and yvenna

S1e24: 5:53 again I ask if Zeus has other mortal children why does hera and ares and the like only pick on Hercules 

Maybe it’s because alcemene is different than the other mortal women idk

Does Zeus’s special protection rule apply to his other half mortal children too

Is Lucius not allowed to kill Herc either 

Or is Hercules special 

S1e31: 15:12 ironic since he goes through the samething with his mom in like 20 years 

S1e33: he looks like ares ironically so does iphicles in the future but herc never mentions that 


S1e34: really hard to imagine hercules as a master of pranks but hey even the selfless and responsible hercules was a kid once

S1e36: 8:54 she didn’t do anything about Zeus going after hinds did she turn against them years later or something 

I thought Serena was the first hind he met that’s how it seemed

Guess not

Young Hercules is rated PG same as a lot of episodes as Hercules and xena but this is actually family friendly kinda weird how things work out

Would have been cool to see how Hercules and Aphrodite met but ig not

Kora seemed to be a big part of hercules’s life what happened to her and why doesn’t he ever mention her again

S1e39: adult Hercules would have thought Pythagoras was amazing for not believing in gods and dictating his own life

S1e40: wasn’t there an episode in Hercules or xena where someone was turned into a deer

10:36 good thing iolas gets smarter as an adult. 

15:00 one day as a human u will

Artemis willing to protect defenseless animals yet so quick to kill a toddler 

S1e42: this appearance of the chronos stone is closer to the one in the movie than the one in Hercules or xena 

S1e41: 6:49 we meet Helen on xena ig she could have been old enough in YH for it too happen she probably would be herc’s age

S1e49: 9:20 amazons are supposed to be a sisterhood with all tribes

Ig all this was before it was that simple

In Hercules the show he said nemesis was his first love but this show is implying it was cyane unless things happened offscreen ",1,1730136442.0,legendaryjourneys,0,1.0,False

I’m taking Step 2 in a couple of weeks, and while I’ve read tons of advice on prep strategy, I rarely see detailed posts about what actually happens during the exam — things like exam conditions, specific rules, and what’s allowed (or not allowed) in the testing room. I’d love to know exactly what to expect so I can go in as prepared as possible mentally and physically.

Some of the questions I’ve been wondering about:

	•	Are we allowed to keep water on our desk? If not, can we at least bring a water bottle to keep outside the room for breaks?
	•	Is it okay to bring necessary medications? For example, if someone needs an inhaler or other medication for medical reasons, what’s the process to ensure you can bring it in?
	•	Snacks during the exam? Can we have a quick snack mid-exam, or do snacks need to wait until the official break time?
	•	Highlighting tools – Does the software offer different highlighting colors like UWorld? That really helps me mark different points.
	•	Break room amenities – Does the break room have water or coffee? Any spots to actually sit and relax?
	•	One-hour break – Is it truly enough, or does it go by fast? How do you recommend making the most of it?
	•	Would you suggest shutting your eyes to recharge, or is moving around better to stay alert?
	•	Scratch paper – How much are we given? And is there a way to get more if needed?
	•	Noise in the testing center – Should I expect quiet, or would earplugs help with any possible noise?
	•	Temperature control – Is the testing room cold, hot, or unpredictable? Should I bring layers to stay comfortable?
	

I know a lot of you have taken Step 1 and Step 2, and I’d love to hear your advice on navigating the testing center rules and any tricks to stay calm and focused throughout the day. It’s my first Step exam, so I’d appreciate any tips to mentally and physically prepare.

Also, any other tips or advise for mental and psychological preparation for the upcoming 2 weeks before exam and for the exam day would be really appreciated. ",3,1730136247.0,Step2,1,1.0,False

The woman is on odsp, refuses to work, has not worked for almost a decade and has gotten around 200,000 from odsp in the past decade while refusing to even go to work for once a week for 4 hours. She posts on fb and other platforms begging for money. They also have a gofundme claiming all these health problems(take it with a grain of salt since they are scammers) I was experiencing so much malnutrition because I was starving and worked the entire time while unhoused. I’m now getting medical care but I felt like passing out regularly, I would nearly pass out everytime I was at work, feel like I was on fire from hot flashes. I was super unwell, I’m getting tested for a variety of health issues. I was an absolute perfect and generous guest these people were so scummy. They first said that I would not have to pay rent just help out with groceries and maybe a bill. They went back on their word 2 days within being there. I bought them weed these assholes smoked 20 grams of high quality weed in 2 days. I then sent them more money they bought 7 grams of milled flower that lasted a few hours. We were all starving but they had the audacity to fat shame me by saying I eat more than them when they wouldn’t have any food if I didn’t send them any money. The woman is absolutely nuts, she yells at doctors and mental health workers who only try to help her. The guy is a drug addict, they didn’t tell me he was on a drug for people to get off opiates, he would regularly call in his doctor claiming he throws up his medication to get more and would get her to back him up. They both do not work and both have not worked in a decade. They are entitled and lazy. They complain the government gives them no money despite them working the system and getting the max amount of odsp and the special diet and getting him to be her caretaker on forms. They verbally abused me the entire time, I heard the man verbally abuse and tell her she’s a piece of shit and complain to her that she cooked him tater tot’s which isn’t real food. I lived in there living room with no privacy, both of them made me cry myself to sleep many nights. I sent them 600 dollars and spent 40 in groceries and was only there less then 4 weeks. They kept forcing me to take their “home cooked meals” then claimed I was taking advantage of them. I could go on and on. They asked for 100 for May 8 days into April because despite getting 400 from me the previous week and 200 previously. When I said no because I was not comfortable there and did not plan on staying she got angry said “why didn’t you tell us you know we rely on your money” this was literally 2 days after she went on a psychotic text abuse for an hour or 2 where I cried and hung out with my friend at the park during. I had to go to my friends house for meals because his mom felt bad for me. These people knew I had been kicked out by my abusive ex, literally put my shit outside when he had no legal right to do so. So when I refused to be abused and send them more they kept trying to make bogus claims about me owing them money. They locked me out, the guy shouted “400 dolllars is nothing, 409 dollars is for holding your stuff” I come back with the police a couple of days later and low and behold these assholes stole some of my belongings. I want to know where I can spread the word about these people because I’m not the first or last person they will do this too. They told me some guy lived in their apartment before but he had their room(later learned it’s because he paid 80% of their rent and they still harassed him for money) they claimed he was terrible and punched the guy for no reason(the guy in the couple tried to punch him first) coincidentally my new coworker knew them!! I told her my experience and it sounded very familiar especially the band if the guy which is unusual. As soon as I said the name of the women she asked me where it was, I told her we kept confirming details and then I told her their Instagram she looked them up and confirmed that they are in fact the people her ex(the guy who was living with them) she said he was an awful scummy pos, but they were actually worse and kept asking him for money and drugs. I want to let people know because me, and tge guy who lived there previously aren’t even their only victims. 

They do this a lot, they abuse people who pay them money while they sit on their asses and take tax payers money. Everything she’s sent me in taxes are unhinged and a lot of it is either exaggerated or untrue. How do I go about earning others because they’ve had a lot of people live with them and it’s scary since they’ve graduated from abusing a man who can hold his own to abused unhoused sick POC women. 

These are only a few texts. These scummy people stole from an abused homeless women working her ass off. The guy complained about my area being messy, it wasn’t and I slept all day because I worked while sick while these POS claim they have all these health ailments like epilepsy. Their gofundme makes me sick because I suffered and they are still doing this with no remorse. You can delete if it’s not allowed but my experience has been horrible. They both claimed that universal income should be a thing and rent is not fair yet they do this predatory gross behaviour and it hasn’t only been with me!!",0,1730136173.0,SlumlordsCanada,6,0.15,False
1ge7ql2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DrSteve/comments/1ge7ql2/olfactory_sense_change/,Olfactory sense change,"Hi Dr Steve, I’ve been dealing with a mysterious symptom since late March, early April of this year. Long story short, around this same time two things happened - I started a new medication for migraines and I caught a mild cold from my preschooler. Soon after starting this medication and after recovering from this cold I had a drastic change in my sense of smell and taste, and I can’t stand things I used to love and have eaten my whole life. 

All of a sudden, the smell of cooking steak is horrible to me (smells like when the cautery is used in the OR), and tastes almost rancid. It’s not just meat that has this smell/taste, but butter, coffee, and peanut butter (though it’s not as strong with peanut butter as the others). Onions and beans have a bit of that same category of smell, but it’s not like it is with the meats and the others. Here’s the kicker - my urine and feces have this same new smell as the foods I can no longer stand. But that smell is different to me too. That might not make sense, but what I’m getting at is that, to me, my own waste has a different smell than it did before and has taken on that cautery like smell, and those food items all have that same cautery like smell also. 

At first I wasn’t sure what was going on, and I tried to see if other proteins had the same effect, and found that any and all types of beef, pork, lamb, and chicken (at least from one of the local fast food places my kids like - I honestly can’t remember if I’ve tried chicken at home, by that point I started trying to find vegan options). Duck, as it turns out, and all seafood and fish that I’ve tried so far, are all okay, and don’t seem to have that smell/taste to me. This has been ongoing for months and I have no clue why. To clarify, I haven’t been able to tolerate the smell or the change in taste enough to actually eat the things I listed that have that smell. The closest I get is putting a bite in my mouth, maybe chewing once or twice, and then having to spit it out due to the taste.

I stopped taking the medication 6 months ago, which made no difference. I’m a nurse, so I usually swab for Covid with anything respiratory and have had it twice. This was so mild (more like allergies flaring than an illness) I didn’t swab that time, so I can’t say for certain that it wasn’t, but it wasn’t anything like when I’ve had it either time before. It’s been going on for so long now that I’m essentially an involuntary pescatarian. 

Any ideas about what’s going on? Is there something chemically similar about beef, coffee, eggs, butter, garlic, and coriander?  Do they all have thiols like asparagus? Or benzene rings like bananas? I know just enough to know that I know nothing. Any input on why this happened, what it is, or how to fix it would be great! I used to have a bloodhound nose and now I feel like my sniffer has betrayed me (and my formerly favorite foods)!",1,1730136168.0,DrSteve,2,1.0,False

# 1. Notion Forms

Notion has been teasing this feature for a while, and now it's finally here! **Notion Forms** allows you to say goodbye to external survey tools and gather data directly into your Notion databases.

[Notion Forms](https://preview.redd.it/g467qbu14jxd1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dddf95a34acac96704ace0905d9cbbe6b23364c7)

This is perfect for setting up internal helpdesks, expense reports, or collecting feedback!

# 2. Database Layouts

Notion's new **Database Layout Builder** gives you more control over how your content is displayed, allowing you to create **custom page structures**.

[Notion Layouts](https://preview.redd.it/jlzczgw54jxd1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bddc6229c2765e96da95cc4bbccc5a54ab24df68)

[Notion Marketplace](https://preview.redd.it/hf1yktui4jxd1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=303f772c061ab01853b3e96be5bf9decc5ce94a7)

1ge7lp0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1ge7lp0/complications_of_having_an_fp_while_married/,Complications of having an FP while married,"Before I jump into it, I guess I should give some background about how it all started.

My FP (I will refer to him as N) and I work in the same store but in different departments.  I started working there before him but left and went back a month later since I couldn’t find another job, he was hired a month after my return.  I am 45 years old and married with two kids and this is my only job working part-time at night.  He is 20 and currently single and works different shifts all the time while being in college.  In the beginning, he was training with another young guy, B, who I would greet when I came in and he would just stand there saying nothing.  They were always together and I would comment about how cute it was to see them always together and seemingly having a good time.

Then one day the three of us were all in the same spot and N asked me about coffee, it was a quick conversation, and I was heading back to my department with not much time to talk.  Another time he ran after me with my mushrooms asking what to do with them but I had little to offer since I don’t eat them and told him as much. Quick encounters and conversations until he broke up with his girlfriend who cheated on him.  Now he was showing up in my department to talk about that and I was offering advice and an ear, but still, any interactions were short and infrequent.

Back in February I got sick and was gone for a week, when I came back I had just celebrated my birthday but I was stressed because bloodwork showed a problem with my liver (my mom passed from liver cancer at 46) so I was not in my right headspace.  I saw N  on my first day back and he was asking about Valentine’s Day if we celebrate and if my husband wrote me a love letter, and I was like, no we don’t celebrate Valentine’s Day.  Then he hit me with:

“I missed you”

That moment started a chain of events that would leave a path of destruction and my hope in sharing the process of this is that it will help someone else.  There is a lot to the whole story, too much for one post but today is day one without him and it is hard.

It’s hard because I always had mixed feelings about having a friendship with him and being married, it added a layer of stress to not only my life but my husband’s as well.  Still, this kid (he is a kid to me being only three years older than my oldest son) told me he didn’t have a good relationship with his family, in his words they are just “people who lived in the same house”.  So despite what I was going through, I tried to be someone he could talk to but as of last night we have cut off our friendship and I am feeling so badly about everything.  There was no cheating, just to make that clear but somewhere along the line, he became my FP and yeah, it’s been rough.

I feel just awful it’s a mix of missing him, feeling like I messed everything up and not knowing what was real.  I was obviously very important to him and now it’s all over.

If there is any bright spot, it’s my husband of nearly 19 years, I love him dearly and he has been fantastic throughout all of this, very supportive, reading about BPD to try and help me, he is my greatest blessing.  He did not deserve the pain I caused by having an opposite-sex friendship but despite my mistakes, he has chosen to forgive me and move forward.

I just ask if there is any comment or advice to please be kind, I had a psych evaluation at the hospital last week which was traumatizing.  I am truly trying to do my best to navigate this.

1ge7lm6,https://www.reddit.com/r/bestbeautybuys/comments/1ge7lm6/honest_i_tested_colgate_optic_white_is_it_the/,[HONEST] I Tested Colgate Optic White: Is It the Ultimate Stain Fighter?,"# 

Looking for a toothpaste that can fight stains and whiten your teeth? I've been using Colgate Optic White Stain Fighter, and it's become a go-to in my daily routine.

This toothpaste comes in a pack of four 4.2 oz tubes, making it a great value. I've found it does a good job at removing surface stains from my teeth. The clean mint flavor is fresh without being too strong. It leaves my mouth feeling clean after each brush.

https://preview.redd.it/woyrliwr5jxd1.jpg?width=425&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af76a99464deabfe5aed4af0ef20449483e07890

One thing I like is that it's safe for daily use. It's also vegan, gluten-free, and sugar-free. The fluoride helps fight cavities too. While I can't say my teeth are dramatically whiter, I do think they look brighter and cleaner since I started using it.

# Bottom Line

If you want a toothpaste that cleans well and helps fight stains, Colgate Optic White Stain Fighter is worth a try. It's a solid choice for everyday use.



# Overview of Colgate Optic White Stain Fighter Teeth Whitening Toothpaste

I've been using this toothpaste for a while now, and I'm impressed with its stain-fighting power. The clean mint flavor is fresh without being too strong. It leaves my mouth feeling clean and my breath smelling great.

One big plus is how well it tackles daily surface stains. After brushing twice a day for two weeks, I noticed my teeth looking brighter. The micro-polishing action really seems to work on coffee and tea marks.

This Colgate toothpaste is enamel-safe for daily use. It's also vegan, gluten-free, and sugar-free. That's a nice bonus for those with dietary concerns.

The four-pack is a good value. I like having extra tubes on hand so I don't run out. While it may not replace professional whitening, it's a solid choice for everyday care and stain prevention.

# Micro-Polishing Action for Superior Stain Removal

I've been really impressed with the micro-polishing action in this Optic White toothpaste. It's not just your average whitening product. The tiny particles work to buff away surface stains as I brush. I've noticed it tackles coffee and tea marks better than regular toothpaste. After two weeks of use, my teeth look noticeably brighter. The clean mint flavor is refreshing without being too strong. I like that it's enamel-safe for daily use, so I don't have to worry about damage. While it works well, very stubborn stains may need more time or professional treatment. Overall, I find this toothpaste effective for keeping my smile looking fresh and stain-free.

# Refreshing Clean Mint Flavor

The minty taste of this toothpaste is a standout feature. I find the Clean Mint flavor refreshing and not too overpowering. It leaves my mouth feeling cool and clean after brushing. The mint taste isn't too strong or artificial, which I appreciate. It's pleasant enough to make brushing enjoyable, but not so intense that it burns. The flavor lasts for a while after brushing, giving me fresh breath for some time. I like that it's not too sweet and doesn't have any odd aftertastes. For those who prefer a milder mint flavor in their toothpaste, this could be a good choice.

# Vegan, Sugar-Free, and Gluten-Free Ingredients

I was happy to find a toothpaste that meets my dietary needs. This Colgate Optic White toothpaste is vegan, which is great for those of us who avoid animal products. It's also sugar-free and gluten-free, so it works for people with various dietary restrictions. I appreciate that Colgate made this formula safe for daily use while still being effective at whitening. It's nice to have an option that aligns with my lifestyle choices. The clean mint flavor is refreshing without being overpowering. I feel good about using this toothpaste knowing it's free from ingredients I try to avoid in my diet.

# Ease of Daily Use

Brushing my teeth with this toothpaste is a breeze. The clean mint flavor feels fresh without being too strong. I like how it foams up nicely and spreads easily across my teeth and gums. The tube is easy to squeeze and control the amount I use. It rinses away cleanly, leaving my mouth feeling fresh. I've noticed it helps fight daily coffee stains, which is a big plus for me. The 4.2 oz size lasts a good while, even with twice-daily use. I appreciate that it's safe for daily use and doesn't irritate my gums. It fits seamlessly into my morning and evening routines without any extra steps or hassle.

# Pros and Cons

Let's take a closer look at what makes this toothpaste stand out and where it might fall short.

# Pros

* I noticed it really does help remove surface stains. After using it for a couple of weeks, my teeth looked noticeably brighter.
* The clean mint flavor is pleasant without being too strong. It left my breath feeling fresh after each use.
* I found it to be gentle on my teeth and gums. No irritation or sensitivity issues cropped up while I was using it.
* The value is great. Buying this 4-pack saves money compared to picking up single tubes at the store.
* It's nice that it's vegan and free from gluten and sugar. This makes it a good option for people with dietary restrictions.

# Cons

* While it does whiten, the results aren't as dramatic as some other whitening products I've tried. Don't expect miracles overnight.
* The mint flavor might be too mild for those who prefer a stronger taste in their toothpaste.
* I wish the tubes were a bit larger. At 4.2 ounces each, they run out faster than I'd like.
* The whitening effect seems to plateau after a few weeks of use. You might need to switch to a stronger product for more noticeable results.
* It's pricier than basic toothpaste options. If you're on a tight budget, this might not be the best choice.

# Analyzing Customer Reviews

I've been using this Colgate Optic White toothpaste for a while now, and I wanted to see what other customers thought. Many users seem happy with the product, giving it a high 4.7-star rating. People like how it leaves their teeth feeling clean and looking brighter. The mint flavor is well-liked, described as refreshing without being too strong. Some users noticed their teeth getting whiter over time. A few mentioned it helps fight coffee stains. The price is seen as a good value, especially when bought in multi-packs. Not everyone saw dramatic whitening results though. One person suggested trying a different brand for more noticeable effects. Overall, most reviewers found it effective for everyday use and stain prevention.

# Conclusion

I've been using this toothpaste for a while now, and it's become a staple in my bathroom. The clean mint flavor is pleasant without being overpowering. My teeth feel fresh and look brighter after regular use. While it may not work miracles overnight, it does a good job at fighting everyday stains from coffee and other foods. The value for money is great, especially when buying in bulk. Some users might prefer stronger whitening effects, but for most people, this toothpaste strikes a good balance between cleaning, whitening, and cavity protection. It's a solid choice for anyone looking to maintain a bright smile without breaking the bank.",1,1730135826.0,bestbeautybuys,0,1.0,False

My budget is up to €500, +/- €50. Philips, DeLonghi... whatever.   
  
What I'm looking for is to be able to make **coffee with warm milk**. So **I don't need 17 types** of cappuccino and latte macchiato, I want regular coffee, but with warm milk. Not with a full cup of thin foam, but with warm milk. There may be some foam, but it need to be thick and creamy..   
  
Another thing that would be desirable is that the machine also makes Ice Coffee, because in the summer I drink as many as 3-4 of them. This is not crucial, because as far as I know Ice Coffee can be made from ""ordinary"" espresso.  
  
Now, I researched and found that only Philips 4300 (pre-programmed drink) can make caffe latte.   
  
Do you have a suggestion for an automatic machine that is good and that I can make a nice, warm, creamy coffee with warm milk without foam..? Maybe DeLonghi Magnifica Evo? There is no pre-programmed caffe latte but maybe it can be programmed on ""My Latte"" mod?

- schroth therapy and physical therapy can absolutely reduce the severity of your scoliosis (to an extent, not saying it cures it) even if they relentlessly insist that it's only meant to help with maintenance/prevent progression

- interoral face pulling works but exclusively if done correctly, and only if you're also working on and/or maintaining good neck and back posture. you also eventually have to work on fixing any asymmetry prior to really going at it, or else that'll slow your progress

- peppermint tea will dry out your skin if you're prone to oil in your t-zone, also good for acne in moderation. but if you overdo it, you'll delay your period by several days (which can be a good thing if you're going to the beach or whatever)

- bulk dried herbs can be purchased on amazon for 10x cheaper than what you get in store, and they're nearly always fresher too

- lion's mane is legit, works fantastically for me but like all supplements, not for everyone. it got rid of my brain fog, increased my verbal fluency, increased focus, and has permitted me to create new healthy habits more easily. however, the dose makes the poison. everyone i talked to who swears it gave them anxiety attacks and even psychosis were all taking upwards of 2000mg a day for several consecutive months, with one person even taking 3000mg a day, and God knows what other supplements/meds in addition to that. i only take 500mg a day and even then, i take a week or two off, sometimes more, every few months whenever i start noticing my anxiety kicking up a bit. also, an additional disclaimer is that everyone reacts differently to stuff. antidepressants were terrible for me, but i know some work pretty well for people i know irl, for example.

- additional lion's mane theory: like with anything that promotes neuroplasticity, you should be actively trying to create healthier habits while taking this, not giving in to bad ones.

- i had seborrheic dermatitis on my nose (it's 90% gone now) and cooking with mct coconut oil helped get rid of it. mct oil does naturally have shit in it that works against malessezia overgrowth, but i have no idea why consuming it worked tbh - i'd apply it to my face, but i noticed a difference with eating it too. not all mct oil is created equal though.

- cutting out all added sugar (and a lot of natural sugar too) has given me so much more energy it's unreal. annoying for the first three days, but then you get used to it. if you don't want to cut out all sugar though, making a point of starting your day with a savory breakfast and/or no sugar in your coffee, either only with cream or taken black, will also make a big difference in terms of energy.",13,1730135385.0,rs_x,4,0.93,False

Sa Advice Ph ta to, pero basin makit-an kay wide ug scope didtoa. Share ko lang. Naa koy naka-chat (M, 25) since January, this year. Nagkaconnect mi sa usa ka online site unya nibalhin sa Telegram. Anonymous mi nagchat, walay real names ug uban pang important infos, except sa lugar asa nagpuyo ug siya nagwork. Hasta real faces, wala mi idea sa usa't-usa. Pero pirteng tabi rajud, slight getting to know. Share ug music ug opinions sa mga butang-butang. Until nashare niya iyang real reason mao naa siya ato na site kay h*rny siya. Ako, non-judgemental raman, igo rasad tubag pero ako siya giingnan random chats ra akong tuyo ato na time ug never ko nagparticipate mga in ana. Nafeel guro niya na uncomfortable ko, change topic siya. Pero naay days nagatabi mi about SPG topics: drugs, violence, ug iyang mga kabuang online, mga sexual things. Igo rako tigpaminaw, pero mafeel man nimo lahi na ang tabi padulong, dili nako moreply. Ug mochange topic nalang sunod adlaw, like memes na or political news, in ana na dagan sa conversation. Among convo kay dili kanang mag good morning/night/hows ur day. Layo kaayo sa ingon ana. Like, musulpot rag kalit unya magtabi sa topic, muhunong rasad kalit (pero everyday). Wala say update-update. Until nipadayon rajud among panagtabi. June month na, niana ko na ig start sa semester, idelete na nakong telegram. Bored rako ato tungod school break nako maong wala rako nagmind na anonynous mi in ana kay idelete raman nako. Long story short, nipadayon gihapon kog tabi niya kay daghan kaayo ko nakat-unan, naa man sya sa Tech field, unya small coffee shop owner, in ana. Daghan kaayo ko nakat-unan about business unya sige mig tabi about finances, politics ug legal topics. Legit, wala nako natuman akong plano na i-delete ang telegram😭

Ang nakabati pajud nako, nahibaw an niya akong real name, unya ako wala kahibalo sa iyaha. (Basta accident, nakashare kog link sa spotify). Dili man ko ang klase nga mamugos or basta interrogative, unya wala raman say kaso nako nga nakahibalo siya sakong ngalan tungod kabalo ko harmless ra siya. Naay time, manungog siya sa ganap sakong kinabuhi, ""updated daw sya about nako"" tungod sa thought nga weak ko mag-anonynous online, sungog ragud. Until naabot sa time nagasend siya idea unsa ako kwaon sa masters, nakuyawan ko kay interesado kaayo siya sa mga courses (para nako) unya nagpili jud sya sa mga gusto kaayo nako, nagrecommend mga school in ana. Until ni-graduate ko pag August (undergrad). Nangutana na syag naa ba daw nilandi nako in ana, nya naa na syay padungog dungog nga marupok jud daw syag kalit basta mga pang-nerd na na topic among tabian. Random muana siya, nakakita syas akong recent pic (myday/IG story), happy siya nga happy ko. So, ako siya giingnan, dili ko ganahan kay creepy kaayo siya paminawon kay wala man ko kaila niya. Pero akong sayop kay wala man ko nangutana. 

Two weeks man ata to nabusy ko (barangay org), unya siya kay wala say message message. Until nibalik ra syag kalit message pero political topics lang. Sugod ato, never na sya ni-random share ug experiences, wala nasay personal nga stories even katong mga spg topics. (I mean, kay kahibalo man sya maminaw rako ug non-judgemental ko ug musulti rako kung super ka inappropriate na). Never nasad siya nagbring up ug personal things about nako. AS IN WALA NA! Pero daghan gihapon ko nakat-unan niya. Among pirme tabian nalang kay politics😭
Not even mutubag about personal things kay hometown niya ang Naga City sa Camarines Sur, pero tipid ra kaayo siya moreply sa personal things about naunsa iya family sa recent bagyo. Sauna moshare siyag musics ug nganu ganahan siya ana, karun wala na. Again magtabi gihapon mi, pero mura mig workmate nga professional lang 🤣

Akong problema kay akong kaugalingon. Lately lang, bisag in ato ka stiff among conversation, naa siyay mga gesture nga: downloadan ko niyag mga random books nga ganahan nako, i-update ko niya sa mga latest politics things HAHAHHA, like mga time stamp sa videos, pangutan on ko niya sa akong thoughts sa mga butang butang, pang nerd kaayo, which is nikalit kog kaganahan niya🤯 
PERO kabalo ko nga shallow lang. Ako ginaremind akong kaugalingon stranger gihapon sya nako, since wala koy idea sa iyang pinakapersonal infos. At the same time, kalit lang ko gimingaw atong convos nga wala ra kaayoy pake kung personal ang mga tabian. Karun man gud, puro jud mga pang bright-bright. Naay mga topics sauna magtalk siya about sa iyang mama, papa, in ana na personal level. Karun kay wala na at the same time, naganahan ko niya kay maka-keep up siya sa mga topics of interest nako. 

Over all, naganahan ko niyag kalit, nga unsa ba.

**Summary:**Getting over Aziraphale is the hardest thing Crowley has ever done. When he Fell, it was hard, but he knew in an instant what he had lost. With Aziraphale, he never saw it coming. Up until now, he had always had *hope.*

*Excerpt:*The angel got in the lift and Crowley heard nothing from him for six months. Then, out of the blue, Aziraphale was calling, asking for his help.

“Just one last time, Crowley,” Aziraphale pleaded. “I *need* you.”
He sounded anxious and sad and truly desperate. It was a big ask, but Aziraphale was probably right. While he wasn’t absolutely sure, Crowley thought it just might take an ethereal being and an occult being, working together, to foil an apocalypse. Last time it took Aziraphale, himself, the not-really-the-Antichrist, and a whole lot of luck to pull it off.

He had been saying yes to Aziraphale for six thousand years. It was a hard habit to break. Of course he said yes. He’d only said no once, and while he wasn’t sorry, he had been miserable ever since.

1ge7be7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1ge7be7/20_years_later_what_it_takes_to_actually_be/,20 Years Later: What it takes to actually be friends with your Big Ex,"Hi, fam. I wanted to share some insights from being 20 years beyond “No Contact.” I cut ties with my ""Big Ex"" about 16 years ago, right after getting engaged to my now-husband. But over the years, Big Ex and I broke that no-contact boundary, attempting to be “friends.” Mostly, it caused a lot of heartache.

**Here's a warning: If you love someone and want them in your life, even just as a friend, breaking no contact risks spoiling the good memories you have of that person.** It also requires seriously being willing to change your role and relationship with them to repair the relationship.

I am lucky in that I have a good comparison point for Big Ex - both a happy, healthy marriage with my spouse (who is very tolerant of my past loves, and I am of his) and an ex with whom I am now friends (""Friend"" below). So, I'm sharing what I've learned in case it helps you avoid the same mistakes I've made.

**HOW TO BE FRIENDS WITH AN EX**

**1 -** [**Friendship is the basis of any long-lasting relationship**](https://psychcentral.com/relationships/the-importance-of-friendship-in-marriage#importance)**.**

This is true in marriage, romantic relationships, and platonic ones. You have to actually *like* the person and enjoy spending time with them. This is because we're human, and we're going to have awkward, weird, sad, strange, gross, unattractive moments, and you need someone who can see that you're a person behind your sexual and romantic being.

Friendship also helps when you need to make up after a big fight. Research has shown that you need roughly five positive interactions for every negative interaction[ to repair a relationship](https://www.extension.purdue.edu/extmedia/cfs/cfs-744-w.pdf). It is much easier to do the repair work with someone you're friends with. You get into an argument (negative), and then you can do things together (go for a walk, play a video game, etc.) to offset the argument. You can ""bank"" good memories to make your relationship more resilient against future negative interactions.

The person I became actual friends with after we dated (""Friend"") was a classmate, and we traveled with a school competition team. We had several interactions with other people and a chance to readjust to new roles after we broke up. We joked about having dated. He eventually dated a friend of mine, and we hung out as a group. He was the only ex of mine at my wedding, and he was happy and supportive of my marriage. He kept in touch over the years and invited me to his wedding. We keep in touch in a friendly, low-pressure way, like any other friends.

Big Ex and I weren't ever friends before or after we dated and had much fewer opportunities to connect organically in person. I was still in school, and he was already working full-time when we broke up. When we did meet up, he would regularly reference when we dated. He was not respectful of people I dated if we bumped into each other at parties. He started a rumor when I got engaged that I was only getting married because I must be pregnant (which was not true) - the final straw that prompted me to cut contact. Even after we reconnected, he'd still reference specific details or memories from dating. I could never be who I am now - I was always the memory of the 19-year-old girl he met.

**2 - Don't talk about your shared sexual history.**

And by ""sex,"" I mean any kind of contact that involves skin-to-skin and orgasm. You can't talk about it. You can think about it, remember it fondly, and fantasize about it. But you cannot talk about it.

With Friend, it is totally awkward to be somewhere and randomly remember that I've seen them naked before. I just ignore it and move on. We keep our interactions light and avoid situations where nostalgia might strike - meaning that we don't spend time alone, we don't text 1:1 except basic stuff (""What time is the thing?""), we don't keep secrets from our spouses. When people ask how we met, I say we were friends in college. I don't say, ""Well, I was his first, and we had great sex \*awkward chuckle\*.""

With Big Ex, references to sex - our history - came up a lot and got us in trouble. There is a bit of a high you get from talking to someone that you have great chemistry with and fantasizing together, and that's a speedy way to fuck up your life and theirs. Just don't go down that road.

**3 - Friends connect in person,  not just over text or calls.**

Texting and calls allow for fantasy because they lack the reality check of face-to-face interactions. You don’t see expressions or body language, which makes it easy to idealize the other person. You don't have to deal with messy human things. Your romantic partner can fart on the couch while you're on the phone, and you could never know, for example. You're not both being interrupted by the cat or dog or the front door. You don't even have to shower.

You also tend to ignore the fact that the experience you're having isn't the one they're having. I used to travel often for work and would talk to Big Ex while traveling. If I'm on the phone, walking down the beach in Southern California, I associate their voice, stories, and laughter with this romantic beach. But in reality, this person could be sitting in their pajamas in the middle of nowhere. It's artificial.

When I see my Friend in person, we're typically in group settings with my spouse or his (or both) present. I see him at trivia night or the movies, and we catch up in real conversation.

In contrast, Big Ex was always reticent to meet in person to do normal human things - like going for a walk, watching a movie, etc. He was down to text at midnight but not to have coffee at 10 AM. He could talk to me on the phone for hours when he was drunk, but god forbid I ask him to go to an in-real-life event with me.

At the end of all the drama, I felt very used - I was good fodder for fantasy but not for friendship. I could be cheap, late-night entertainment but not someone to have a real, human connection with.  I am still sad and angry about being put into the ""cheeky ex-girlfriend"" bucket, not the ""friend I would like in my life"" bucket. That anger and sadness have colored how I see the whole relationship and made it really difficult to move on.

**4 - It's nearly impossible to be friends with someone that you're in love with.**

This is the bad news that I had to accept about Big Ex. [Your profound first loves change your brain chemistry](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/17/why-first-loves-shape-our-lives-for-ever-relationships-memories). I've read a handful of research studies on this, and it happens repeatedly - there are some people you will love your whole life. That's just a fact of the human experience.

With Friend, we were never *in love*. I never imagined a serious, long-term relationship with him into my adulthood. I was sad when we broke up, but neither of us was devastated. I could see him with new partners and be happy for him. I could get over little stings to my ego. And now, I am thankful and happy that this person whom I care about is still in my life and I'm in his, even though our relationship looks a lot different than it did when we first got together.

On the other hand, my Big Ex was the first person I seriously considered as a life partner. I loved him but never told him because I was still so young and not ready yet to be partnered. I held off sleeping with him because I didn't want to get too attached. We had issues that we could have overcome if we had both had more life experience and emotional maturity. But at the time, I didn't want to work it out.

It took me several years and a fair amount of grieving to recognize how important Big Ex is to who I am today. And even longer to realize that we can't be friends because I still love him. I don't want to be his friend.

When I think about him, I ruminate, and I'm infatuated, just like I was as a teenager when I met him. In some ways, worse than when I met him. I think he's more physically attractive than when we dated twenty years ago. He's funny and has a very joyful laugh. We have a natural chemistry. I could listen to him talk for hours. He's a great conversationalist. We like similar things - politics, reading, music. He's opened my eyes to new ways of thinking about the world. He makes terrible puns. He works in the same industry as me and is actively interested in helping others. He's confident and self-assured. He's sexy. There are things I've let him say to me that I haven't let anyone else say to me, ever, and that I wouldn't bear repeating because I'm blushing just thinking about it. There are dynamics in our relationship that I've never had with anyone else and likely will never have again.

I miss him, and I am infinitely sad that there's no way he can be in my life and that he does not want me in his.

But ultimately, being in love isn't enough if you can never move on to other types of love and affection. You never had time and space to develop more charitable, friendly types of love, and you will not become friends if you don't have that time and space.

And if you try to be friends without that foundation, you will ignore the warning signs - because the lizard part of your brain that is in love with this person lights up and takes over. I**t doesn't matter how long it has been since you were in contact.** Your ability to make rational decisions that enable you to be a happy, healthy person will go out the window. You will do stupid things that hurt other people you love. You will embarrass yourself and alienate your Big Ex.

Breaking ""no contact"" changed me from a happy, fond memory in my Big Ex's mind (""Whatever happened to her?"") to a crazy, middle-aged ex-girlfriend from college, who is mooning and obsessing over someone who doesn't want her around. I wish I could undo the damage that happened after we broke no contact. I wish I could reset and take back some of the things I've said since then.

But you don't have to make the same mistakes I did!

You can leave your love with dignity, graciousness, and kindness so they think of you fondly. Don't continually light that fire until you burn down the house.

If you read the Lost Love Chronicles, you should read this one, too. It updates the research for an internet-age audience and cautions people against reconnecting with lost love, especially if they have a partner now.

**SIDEBAR ON MARRIAGE**

My partner is my best friend. We started dating because he was very kind, accepting, and nonjudgmental. I appreciated that he was kind even though he didn't know me very well then.

My feelings about Big Ex aren't due to any deficit in the marriage - and my partner and I have talked about how to manage exes as we both have a handful that reappears from time to time. We both accept that the people we love/d and who love/d us made us who we are today. We spent more time in our youth with our significant others than making friends, and as a result, we tend to be more tolerant of open communication with exes.

This approach would likely not work for everyone, and as with any marriage, my life with my partner hasn't always been perfect. But we talk about it. We joke about it. Sometimes, I say, ""I need your advice as a friend."" We've accepted that sometimes, in a long marriage, your spouse catches feelings for someone else. A good marriage with a strong basis in friendship can overcome it.

What helps me is to remember that sustainable love is both an action and a feeling. And often, infatuation misses the work that love does as a verb. My marriage works because we show our love to each other - when one is sick, the other takes care of them. We do things for each other even if we don't want to do that (like shopping or watching a movie in a new genre). We compromise. We put the well-being of the other person above our selfish interests. We apologize and are open to apologies. Love is an active work-in-progress - not a static state of being. Love is a living, breathing thing.

If your Ex could never express other types of love beyond the erotic - companion, supporter, caregiver, etc. - think about whether that's the kind of love that would sustain you throughout your life. You deserve a love that will flower and grow as you change and evolve and become the kind of person who loves in all its complexity and richness.",6,1730135141.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

This happened a few years ago now, but this honestly changed the type of relationship I have with my sister now.

So I (35F) got married to my best friend of all time (37M) around 2 years ago. I have never had the strongest relationship with my Sister as our parents would almost put us in competition against each other with regard to academics. Despite her being 12 years older than me, this seemed to affect her more than my other 2 siblings who kinda never cared of one of us was doing better in school.

6 years ago my now husband, lets call him Leo, proposed to me. It was the most beautiful yet awkward proposal which was just utterly perfect for us as a couple. My Sister (47F) who let's call Kim changed very quickly with how she reacted. She was happy for us but was asking questions about the wedding almost obsessively. We weren't living together yet due to us saving money to get our own place but Leo said he just couldn't wait one more minute to declare to me that he would never love anyone else. Which is so sweet and honestly, after 2 years of marriage and 7 years together, nothing has changed for us. 

For context, Kim is the eldest of the 4 children with me being the youngest. One of my brothers was married with a son and my other brother was engaged at this time. We initially said it was going to be a long engagement and we had no immediate plans for the wedding. Kim would make remarks about why get engaged if we weren't going to plan anything. I just ignored these and figured she was jealous. At this point in time she didn't have a man in her life and she was a single Mom to my nephew whose Dad wasn't involved at all. 

So a couple years go by and we have saved money and now rent a nice small little house perfect for us and our lives. We decided against buying a house because this would have taken another couple years and we just wanted to be living together. At this point we decided to start making some plans, but not book anything quite yet. We went and checked out a couple for venues with my Mom and Kim. Kim ended up coming along because she had moved back in with my parents while she saved for a bigger house as she intended to have another baby at some point (she was going to do this through the use of a sperms donor as she never wanted her child to be brought up as an only child). 

We ended up booking our wedding with the help of my Mom for 2 years time. Sidenote we had to day thisby another year due to covid. We were shocked as we never intended to book it but it just kinda fell into place. The anniversary of our first date ended up being the date Leo proposed and with this venue we could get married on the same date. Seemed perfect. 

When picking my bridesmaids I had some very close friends (3 ended up being cut but that's a story for a different day) and I knew I was going to ask my sister. I ended up deciding to make her my MOH because I just knew how much it would mean to her. Boy do I wish I hadn't. 

So my MoH was Kim, then I had my friends Libby and Hayley and my soon to be sister in law Diana. Diana and me had this really close relationship and we genuinely just loved spending time together and we just clicked. We always say she was destined to be my sister one way or another. 

Now, I'm a super simple gal. I didn't want a hugely expensive bachelorette and didn't wanna go out of state or the country. Just something super simple and easy for everyone to go to. I asked for 2 things. I wanted to do a cocktail making class with somewhere that also offered non alcohol cocktails as Libby doesn't drink and Kim....had become pregnant. She had used the donor and was pregnant, due to give birth around 3 months before my wedding. Second, I did not want to do crafts. I had been to a couple of events where we ended up doing pottery or pottery painting and honestly it was a vibe killer. 

After cocktails, I wanted to do a reasonably priced meal and then those who wanted to go to the clubs could and those who didn't could leave. Easy. Simple. Or so I thought. 

Now anyone who knows me, knows I love Harry Potter. I had incorporated small elements into my wedding like small cake decorations and using the gryffindor red as a color scheme. Although that wasn't the only reason for the color scheme. My favourite flowers are red roses and my husband used to buy them for me all the time and even had a bouquet of them on the table at the restaurant when he proposed. So my plan was for me to have red roses in my bouquet and for my bridesmaids to have white roses and the red dresses would make this look perfect. So Kim only knowing this fact about me, planned the entire thing around the fact that I love Harry Potter. I mean....Everything!

It was held at this little Harry Potter themed cafe that did sell cocktails but they have never had a bachelorette party before. You could go as an adult to drink there and they had a room they used for KIDS PARTIES! All the guests were ""sorted"" into houses and on the day I was told to wear something basic and then blindfolded and put in the car and then taken into the place. It was honestly humiliating cos I could hear there were other people not related to our event there. While blind folded someone put a hogwarts tie, sash that said from muggle to Mrs on (I found that out later) and a cloak. I then had some guy taunting me while I was just stood there. It was honestly super awkward and weird but I went with it cos I could see a lot of effort had been made. 

The blindfold was removed and boom I was stood in front of all my guests (around 12 of them) with a room full of strangers behind me. I smiled as again I saw that so much effort had gone into it. We then had the first drinks and one of the bartenders even brought out one of those smoke machine things that make smoke bubbles and let me have a go. My sister was sat next to me with all my other bridesmaids around me and the rest of the guests including my Mom sat down a long table. We played some games and had the weirdest cocktail making ever (not behind the bar just at the table. Felt like it was when in science class you did experiments and had to take turns in groups). 

We were all having fun, Kim had to go and sit in the corner every once in a while cos she was breastfeeding as my nephew was a few weeks old. 

Just a side note: around 2 months before this Kim decided that since my asks excluded her because it involved alcohol (even though I have another bridesmaid who doesn't drink for health reasons) and she was refusing to plan it. She also got annoyed cos she wanted to take me away with the kids and I was like I don't wanna go away and especially with kids that aren't mine). 

At one point, Kim had to go breastfeed while she was running a game and she ASKED my SIL Diana to take over. So she did. After that, Kim sat down at the bottom of the table. Libby, Hayley and Diana were planning to take me to some local drinking spots once everything at the planned event was done. Then came the CRAFTS! The one thing I didn't want to do. So I did it and made no complaints and smiled through it. After several hours (think this was around 4 hours or maybe 5) things started to die down. Everyone wanted photos with me so we took some group photos. After this my Mom and Kim wanted to give me a goody bag of stuff from them. They were waving me over and on my way I was accosted for several selfie with people who were leaving. I opened the gifts, loved then and thanked them both and gave kisses and hugs and said bye. Thought nothing of it. 

Went out with the other gals and was back at SILs house by around 1am after having a loads of fun.  

I was feeling good and we had breakfast and then I made my way to my Mom's house to pick up all my stuff from the day before. 

I walked in and said Hi to my Mom and asked if I could have a cup of coffee before I head home with my stuff. She was confused at why I was there and I said I told her I would be by to pick up my stuff. I sat down thinking we would have a chat and reminisce about the previous day. I asked where Kim and the kids were and I was told they were out and then out of nowhere my Mom ripped into me. 

She told me that I was ungrateful and that I only wanted to hang out with my other bridesmaids and that we singled Kim out by only talking about the plans we had for after. We brought this up once cos we weren't super interested int he food that was on offer and Diana said we go somewhere for food. This went on for about 20 minutes until I was left in tears. I grabbed my stuff and said that I'm sorry for being such a horrible person that I had fun at my own party. I grabbed my stuff and left. Libby lives near by and being in a bad state I made my way to hers and just sobbed on her couch. I called Leo told him what happened and called Diana. 

Just to say my friends and my SIL are the best ab knew just what to say. 

I honestly can't remember how I made up with my Mom, I think she told me she shouldn't have said anything and if I had a good time that's all that matters. But I know that all that came from Kim moaning about me to my Mom. 

My other bridesmaids ended up throwing me a secret 2nd bachelorette party just thr 4 of us which perfect. 

This wasn't the only drama we had surrounding the wedding. She made a fuss about the bridesmaid dresses because she wanted a silver belt so she could ""stand out"" and just gave her opinion on EVERYTHING. She got annoyed when Diana could come to a dress fitting that Kim wasn't able to and the dress shop showed both my Mom and Diana how to get me into my dress, which Diana videoed for Kim and my Mom to refer to on the day. My Mom made a point that it was only her and Kim who could get me into my dress, which was always the plan. I had to have an extra dress fitting because she wanted to be shown in person. 

On the day - she was over an hour late for getting ready. When she arrived she had the table plan in her car and she went up to Leo and thrust it at him without a word an walked away quickly. Like she thought the whole groom doesn't see the bride thing somehow extended to her which was weird. 

She was doing a reading during our ceremony (which she also caused drama about because she like the reading my brothers wife was doing better and I ended up having to let her add her own personalised part to it) and I didn't notice at the time but days later I was told by my bridesmaids that when she got up to read, she ignored the officiant who told her to walk around Leo and instead she walked across my dress and stood on my dress.

She made no attempt to use a breastfeeding cover all day. 

Anyway. Just thought I would share this story and see what you all think.

Me and Hubby are super happily married and as awkward, weird and besotted as we were 7 years ago when we met! ",3,1730135136.0,okstorytime,0,1.0,False

We said hello etc and had a chat and then I made him a coffee in the kitchen. I saw another guy I know who I’m good friends with and see him from time to time in work and we have an inside joke so I said hello to him and we were laughing etc. My crush was behind me and when the other guy left, my crush was asking me who that was etc and that was that. Then whilst we were sat there making conversation, my crush made a few comments. He mentioned this other guy again and that he thinks he’d met him before and I told my crush that this other guy has a nickname for me and told him the name and I was laughing.

I'm on an HSA plan and have certain annual preventative appointments covered with no cost. My company switched insurance this year and my current doctor was no longer in-network, so I had to find a new one. Nearly everyone is booked 6 months out, but I found a clinic that would at least have an RN as my primary care that could see me in 2 months for a new patient appointment, which is not great. I was very clear I wanted to come up for my new patient preventative covered by the ACA.

I had the appointment, about 50 minutes, during which the nurse took my blood pressure/height/usual and asked me a series of questions based on what I filled out in my family history, going into a little more detail about depression (all questions of which were included in the ACA depression screening guidelines). I did not mention any specific issues I had that weren't asked about first, therefore they couldn't change the code as me coming in for a specific problem. Did some heart and breath checks, all pretty standard preventative exam stuff I would expect.

So naturally I eventually get the bill and they bill it as a 99204, not a 99386, which is not fully covered and I was responsible for the full amount, which even in-network was $486.

When I called and asked why it wasn't billed as a 99386, they said that what I received was congruent with a 99204 and billing it as a 99386 ""would be fraud"".

A 99386 is defined as:  
""Initial comprehensive preventive medicine evaluation and management of an individual, including an age and gender-appropriate history, examination, counseling/anticipatory guidance/risk factor reduction interventions, and the ordering of appropriate immunization and laboratory tests. Document the comprehensive nature of the examination, details of counseling provided, and any interventions or tests ordered. (40-64 years of age)""

and my chart notes are all congruent with this. When I asked them specifically what disqualified it as not being a 99386, they just kept saying ""the care you received"" and couldn't give me a specific even when pressed. I told them unless it was coded properly as a 99204 then I wouldn't be paying it and it would have to go to collections and arbitration.

Am I being crazy? Is this part of the ACA worthless because you can't get a simple exam without getting fucked? Do I have any other options besides just wasting time with collections and arbitration? Or next time when I go in for a physical do I have to annoy the doctor asking to record the session and then that every time they ask me a question or want to take a step I have to ask ""Does the answer to this question or does this procedure influence what could change the coding of this visit from a 99386 to another code"" or some bullshit.

If I go to a Starbucks and order a coffee, and get a chai latte, and say ""this isn't what I ordered"", and they say ""well based on our analysis of you we decided you should get a chai"" I'm not paying that shit, why is this normal in this situation?",6,1730134708.0,HealthInsurance,19,0.88,False

1ge72ih,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrakashamParakkatte/comments/1ge72ih/interstellar/,interstellar ,"the sky was dark.

it was the kind of dark that might remind you of that black persian fur coat that you might have kept unworn inside your closets. it was the kind of dark, where sitting in front of the fireplace and reading a book or a paper, with a warm cup of coffee; without worrying about tomorrow - seemed heavenly. it was the kind of dark which makes you over-enthusiastic and fills you to your very brim with the urge to stay up late and watch the stars light up like the colour of blues in your palette. it was the kind of dark that felt nothing like dark; it was a dark that was lighter than any darkness inside the day. 

the sky was majestic in his silver spring that had guarded him. it was the beginning of winter, the leaves had fallen and crushed with utmost concern. the new york city, at it's very will, decorated it's streets with lamps and snow and people; and the sky, just above its head, was like a crown, furnished with a thousand stars lingering, blinking and existing.

And amongst every little wisp of the night, she knew she belonged there; among the cursed, among the most deadly celestial bodies; among the stars. among one of them. 

she knew her mother would probably get mad at her if she would barge into her room right at this moment. she knew she could get detention if she woke up late for school. she knew her bike would be tainted by the time lunch hour would end and she knew she couldn't do anything about it. despite everything, she slid through the upper corridor and opened the door. it was something worth every risk.

but it was not just ""a door"". it was the door with that it linked heaven. it was the door to the eternity which she craved from deep within. it was the door of calamity which could turn down all chaos with a fling of a finger. and, she slid through it, allowing the cold freezing wind to caress her. 

perhaps to anyone it would be something too trivial to romanticize word upon word to, but perhaps to her that's what she excelled in. blant, lewd, hopeless romanticism. and, somehow she was satisfied. 

she felt a nerve throb just above her eye as she pulled her thin knee length blanket before pulling her knees to her chest. she wondered if that was because of the amount of sleep she gets. perhaps it was but there was barely anything she could do about it for sleep was never somewhere around her. 

how could she sleep with all the noises around? how could she sleep with the noises inside her head, thoughts running wild? she needs time to think everything through. she needs to sort everything - every thought into cubes and place it into blocks on both sides. she needs to think about everyone and everything before she could close those dull eyes of hers. 

she has promised that if she ever sleeps, it would be the last and eternal sleep; one she could never wake up from. wouldn't that be just wonderful?

she pushed all her thoughts when she heard her phone buzz from her room. she sighed and felt a numbness drawing in. it could be her ex-boyfriend trying to play the fool and that mere thought of him trying to ""win"" her back makes her even more pathetic. 

she was no fool. everyone read the note he wrote to her anonymously: ""i don't love you anymore."" she was not dumb; at least not as much her ex-boyfriend thought her to be. so, when the class had to confess something, how could he have thought that she wouldn't recognise his handwriting? they were best friends at the very least. 

her eyes stung with tears but she sharply inhaled. she promised herself that she would not cry. she will never cry. not over a boy at least. crying is losing. she is not a loser. she is definitely not a loser. she was perfectly fine.

so, she tried to think of something else. 

she tried to think of autumn and the pumpkins she grew at the back of the garden. she tried to think of the blankets and cardigans she picked out for school. she tried to think of her grandma who used to weave for her and her brother. the last one she made were gloves but it got a hole from last year's christmas. she couldn't wear them anymore this year. 

she tried to think of her guitar which was possibly tossed at some corner of the house. she could bring it here and strum it, maybe. but wouldn't that wake her mother up? that could even wake her boyfriend up. she remembers the night when he snatched her guitar away and plucked all it's strings. she cried a lot that day. 

but it was just one night. the next day, it didn't even look like someone as good as her mother's boyfriend was allowed to exist. she remembers he even insisted on combing her hair that day. probably out of guilt. she doesn't know but it felt as if the person who was combing her hair was not her mother's boyfriend who plucked all her guitar's strings. it was a whole new person. it was as if the person from the other night never existed. 

sometimes it confuses her. she doesn't understand which version to believe in. sometimes when she asked her mother if her boyfriend supported her joining the music class, she would reply with an enthusiastic yes but their actions never really matched. (she still remembers the day when her mom started banging random doors and windows so that she couldn't practice for her recital.)

she sometimes thinks if it's her, the problem. they always financially supported her. it wasn't like they hated her. if they really had hated her, they would have probably left her to deal with her on her own. 

sometimes she feels that maybe it's just her being dramatic or toxic - just like her friends say. she just keeps on expecting more and more and more. it angers her. sometimes she thinks that her perspective of life is even real. she feels that everything is a lie. had she been more exposed to trauma, she would have had no doubt in her that she was in fact hurt. she just wasn't qualified enough to be this sad. 

she hugged her knees tighter before sighing. she can't focus on one thought. everything was chaotic. the only thing that she could focus on was her heartbeat which heightened with every passing second. she could feel the sky kneeling down on one knee and asking for her hand. a woo of isolation. she could feel a strange heaviness that dawned on her. 

her friends were right though. her ex-boyfriend, too, was right. she really thinks she should stop thinking about everything. she needs to stop spewing words over words and then slightly scratching them out and rewriting just to make it make sense. she really needs to stop looking for conclusions. but it was something like in her system. 

if something doesn't make sense, make it make sense. all the ends should be tied. open ends would mean confusion and disillusion and no one would like her if she is confused and disillusioned.

in a moment, it felt like a plague broke into her system. she wanted to reciprocate. she held out her hand to that horrifying feeling. she could feel it into her heart - her desire to combust into millions of stars and particles. she could feel her dire need to be pulled out of this hellhole she resides in. she wanted the desperate reciprocation. she wanted something that could suck every ounce of that weighing sadness that vacuumed inside her heart. and the night was built up with too much void.

she knew this was wrong. what the hell was she doing? she could topple down the roof and fall and perhaps break a limb or two? what will her mom think? that she tried to kill herself? was this even death? 

this can't be death, right? death cannot be this euphoric, right? she read in a book that life and death were interwoven in a cycle and it could only be broken by attaining ""moksha"". she knew she could never attain that. did that mean that she is stuck here forever in this inescapable maze?

that mere thought made her gloomy. she was just too young to be thinking about dying and too happy to appear sad. she hugged herself, cojoining her hands in a tight embrace. 

would it make her a sinner to ask for happiness when she is already happy? she doesn't think so. she already have it established that she always wanted more and more and more. maybe it is okay to be a sinner if that could fetch her some happiness or mould a smile on her lips. she is okay with being a sinner as long as the smile that would play on her lips was real. 

real smile. could you imagine? when people would ask why she was so happy, she would swirl in her dress on tiptoes and say that she was happy to be herself. she would say that she wanted to celebrate being the real her. 

she looked at the sky, a small smile, almost insignificant, formed on her lips. she just couldn't wait to be someone who she really was, minus all her stupid flaws. her flaws had no space to outshine in her reality. 

in her reality, her paranoid mind would be banished. in her reality, she could be an outstanding child with straight A's, a wonderful friend with no expectations whatsoever. in her reality, she could be a person who could always give and give and give and never feel guilty for giving more.

her nose tickled and like an ugly snizzle, she sneezed, a chill running down her spine. it was a bad idea to come up without proper clothing. a clampy weight of who-knows-what crowned her head and she felt chilly. she hugged the blanket closer, in hopes to produce some more warmth. 

she wished she could get up and get something warm on her but it was as if her feet were frozen and her head was nailed. so, she looked up at the palette of darkness above her; her only pacifier.

the new york city. the city that never sleeps. every nook and corner was lit up with street lights and city lights. could the city give one of those lamps to her? she could use it to light up her heart. she wonders if the light that stood out was even meant to distribute. 

all this light and the world still wants to sleep all night. all this darkness and people still want places to hide. she could never understand how the world works and it worried her more often than never. 

the throbbing near her brows kicked in again along with the dizziness in her eyes. she was cold - very very cold in fact. all she wanted was a warm blanket and some sleep. she couldn't sleep though. her mind was more active than anything now and if she forces it to sleep, it would be extremely self-destructive.

who knows? she could still have things to resolve. now that she thinks of it, she realised that thinking everything through can really put things out of the way. for instance, she could now try to expect less from people or try to stop reflecting on her reality. her reality was an illusion. she wonders if anything was real to begin with. 

perhaps her mother really cares for her. perhaps she really wants her to be a good person. perhaps it was her sick mind that often twists her thoughts. 

but it's okay. it was night and soon the daylight would kick in and she could head to school with all the wrongly packed books just to be made fun of by her friends. she loves them though, doesn't she? she must. they all do it for a reason. how could she learn if no one pointed out her flaws?

that's right. she needs to work on gratitude too. she let out a sigh before slowly wrapping her blanket closer, if that was even possible. she tried to imagine someone cuddling away those shivers. she tried to imagine comfort but the only thing she could imagine was a tomorrow without her. she wished she could just stop existing for a day and just fall into pits and shut everyone away. 

but she wasn't so clever. she knew she couldn't survive without everyone. she needs everyone to keep walking with her. she doesn't want anyone to leave so she must endure. she must endure until endurace will break her bones and chew out her ribs.

she decided that it would be morning soon. the sun will rise and the blue sky will surround. all the street lamps will go out and the city will be busy again. 

she knows she should stand up and get going; get into the same pattern and same old routine. she should get up and get under the layers of the comfortable blankets and call it a night. 

it wasn't such an exceptional night either. it was just one of those nights. 

she thought of waking up soon, cleaning her face and wearing her dress and about that real smile she thought she would wear. she thought about her bike and her mother. she thought about her grandmother's gloves and the tiny orange pumpkins that were waiting on the lawn for her. she thought about her warm bed and all those messages her ex-boyfriend might have sent her. and, she thought about sleep; a very deep slumber. 

the night wasn't different from any other. 

but, yes. it was dark. perhaps darker than any darkness inside a day.

the sky was, in fact, very, very dark.

I recently stayed at a hotel in Columbus, GA and had pretty much the worst experience i've ever had at IHG. We were visiting a military member due to graduating to become a US Army Ranger. We have not seen this family member if nearly a year. This was a very big milestone moment. 14 family members (parents, siblings and siblings' children) travelled 12 hours to this hotel to visit and celebrate with this family member.

I checked the reviews on IHG's website, and the hotel had pretty good reviews, but after the stay i checked google and realized that many people had similar complaints to what I was experiencing, frequently calling out the GM and front desk manager by name.

I'm not really able to get any sort of assistance from the hotel or from IHG directly. I really want to see if anyone has ever experienced something like this or has any idea on how to proceed. I've asked for monetary compensation, but the hotel and IHG refused and IHG offered 45,000 points which is equivalent to a one night stay at the hotel. I booked 4 rooms at 5 nights each, so to me, this isn't a satisfactory resolution. I spoke with an Operation Manager Assistant at IHG who said that was the final offer, and that there was no further escalation path.  Despite my request to speak with someone above him, he advised that he is the only person that will handle my complaints going forward. I also requested from IHG to speak with whoever was above the GM, but was told that it was the owner, and they didn't have any contact information for the owner. I've also emailed multiple executives at IHG over the weekend, so I'm hopeful that that will result in some sort of action. Below is a summary of my complaint:

**1. Delayed Room Availability:** When we arrived on October 16 after the designated check-in time, none of our rooms were ready. We were told that it would be several hours before rooms were ready. We had children and a disabled veteran that was in severe pain due to the trip.

**2. Unprofessional Conduct from Front Desk Staff:** On October 17, we raised a concern about undercooked bacon and overcooked biscuits at breakfast with the front desk manager. His response was dismissive and unprofessional, stating it was “not his problem” and that he was called in on his day off. His reaction escalated to the point where he threatened to suspend our reservation.

**3. Room Access and Security Concerns:** On October 17, our guests who arrived that day were sent to the wrong rooms. Additionally, the hotel experienced key card issues, leading to a prolonged delay in accessing our rooms. We were ultimately provided with an emergency master key card that could access multiple rooms, raising serious security concerns. This card was also issued with a warning of a $25 charge if misplaced.

**4. Breakfast Service Concerns:** Breakfast was chaotic each morning, with trash bins overflowing and the cook struggling to maintain sufficient food for guests. Coffee and creamer were frequently unavailable, and on multiple occasions, the cook misleadingly stated there was no coffee to prevent guests from entering a freshly mopped area. This disregard for guest experience falls far short of IHG’s standards. Additionally, there were multiple occasions where a sign was posted on the regular coffee that there was no more coffee for the day. On multiple occasions where there was no coffee creamer available, we were told that only the breakfast staff had access to the coffee creamer. Even after asking the breakfast staff to refill coffee creamer at the end of breakfast when there was none left, the staff ignored our request leaving no coffee creamer available for the entire day on multiple occasions. 

**5. Housekeeping and Cleanliness Issues:** Housekeeping was virtually non-existent throughout our stay. On the one occasion they serviced our room, they only made the beds, despite our request for a full cleaning. They did not change the sheets or bedding, nor did they take out the trash or sweep the floors. Additionally, our repeated requests for fresh towels were ignored repeatedly, leaving us without any towels on our last evening. I was advised by front desk staff that only housekeeping had access to towels, and that after housekeeping leaves for the day, there is no way to get fresh towels. At one point, we even offered to vacuum our own room but were met with no assistance. Furthermore, I observed staff members, including the front desk manager and housekeepers, frequently smoking outside, where one incident led to a fire due to improper disposal of cigarette butts. Such a lack of professionalism and service was especially concerning given the presence of elderly family members.

**6. Inappropriate Employment Solicitation:** During our stay, the general manager attempted to recruit our military family member for employment at the hotel, citing the hotel’s severe staffing shortage. This approach was both unprofessional and inappropriate, especially given the nature of our visit.

**7. Disturbances and Lack of Staff Response:** Our elderly and disabled parents were repeatedly harassed by groups of young softball players running through hallways, knocking on our doors, and gathering near our rooms late at night. This occurred over several evenings, despite our complaints. When we asked hotel staff, to address the matter, we were instead advised to approach the players’ parents directly—a dismissive and unprofessional response.

**8. General Manager’s Unprofessional Conduct On-Site:** During our stay, the general manager had a young child with her on the premises, believed to be her child or grandchild. This child was unsupervised at times, running through the halls, attempting to enter various guest rooms, and even climbing on one of our family members. This unprofessional situation added further disturbance and discomfort, detracting from our stay’s professionalism and safety.

**9. Post-Checkout Charges and Disregard from Management:** After checkout, two rooms were assessed an extra cleaning fee for alleged “food in the carpet.” This charge was unfounded, as we left our rooms in good condition. Additionally, one room had a noticeable red stain on the carpet at the time of check-in, which the hotel later cited as part of the cleaning fee. When I contacted the hotel to discuss these charges, the front desk manager misrepresented himself as the general manager, was dismissive, and even accused us of lying about our complaints. After learning he was not actually the general manager, I requested to speak with the GM directly, who was reportedly unavailable but would “call back in 2 days.” I waited, and when the two days passed, I called the hotel 10 times over four hours, only to be repeatedly told she was on a conference call. After finally reaching her, she refused to address the issues and even claimed I was lying when I mentioned the front desk manager had represented himself as the general manager, stating she was on the other line with him and he said he was the ""manager on duty"". This was a lie, and if she was on the other line and heard the conversation, she should have called me immediately versus waiting 2 and a half days. Ultimately, the GM advised disputing the charges with our bank rather than offering any form of resolution.

**10. Request for Incident Report and Photos:** During my conversation with the GM, I also requested the incident report, and any photos used to justify the extra cleaning fee. The GM took down my email address, promising to send the requested documentation, but I have yet to receive any report or photos to support these charges.

  
tldr; A family of 14 traveled to Columbus, GA, for a military graduation but faced multiple issues at their IHG hotel. Problems included delayed room availability, unprofessional staff, room security concerns, chaotic breakfast service, and inadequate housekeeping. Further issues included disturbances from unsupervised youth, inappropriate job solicitation for their military family member, and unjust post-checkout cleaning charges. When the family finally reached the general manager, she suggested disputing the charges with their bank instead of offering a resolution. A later call to IHG reached an Operations Manager Assistant, who confirmed that the points were IHG’s final offer and that no further escalation would be allowed, leaving the family without a satisfactory outcome. Despite attempts to address these with hotel management and IHG, only 45,000 points (equal to one night) were offered as compensation, for a 20-night booking (4 rooms at 5 nights per room).",0,1730134539.0,ihghotelsresorts,0,0.4,False

May nakita akong hot na guy and ofc blurred yung face or cropped like i forgot na and i was just focusing on his body, maputi, buff and hinde ma-abs and ma-chest, literal na type ko. So i messaged him saying “trade, i send first” so sinend ko album ko and ang tagal bago mag reply but not really long pero matagal. Then i was shock kasi kilala nyako, he said “(my full name)??” And i was like do you know me? Tas sabi nya yes and he told me his name and sinend nya album nya and OMFG. Ex sya ng ex friend ko. 

To give u a back story, i had this friend in a toxic relationship and puro cheating chuchubels. One day, yung bf ng ex friend ko ( lets call him vincent ) messaged me na galit kasi baket daw kami nag lalaro ng ML together ng friend ko something like that and cheater daw friend ko. And ako like hold up, labas ako sa relationship nyo and wala lang naman saken yung paglalaro namin ng ML so it’s not a big deal. Tapos ayon nag away kami and we blocked each other sa socials after namin magsagutan. 

Fast forward sa araw na nag grindr ako and nakamatch ko sya. We are laughing at hinde kami makapaniwala and we had the time to explain ourselves sa both side namin and he told me na the reason why he is really really angry at me kasi apparently my friend is using me as an cheating accessory, like to make him jealous. Eh ako very go with the flow lang naman ako lagi as long as for me it was innocent things and walang masama sa ginagawa. Then ayon he told me break na sila ng ex friend ko and ayon ang blinock ko naman ngayon is yung friend ko that’s why ex friend na sya plus like i told vincent kasi na “alam mo ba na chinat ako ng jowa mo na kung pwede saken sya matulog kasi wala syang matutulugan but i declined na kasi baka magalit ka nanaman saken tas maipit ako sa away nyo huhu” then nagulat sya hinde nya daw alam yan so ayun ginagamit talaga ako ng ex friend ko para magselos si Vincent. 

We agreed to meet up and have sone coffee sa nearby coffee shop sa school to make kwentuhan at to be friends at each other kasi guys, ang kwento ng friend ko about Vincent is like he’s always the bad guy but i always give the benefit of the doubt kasi di ko naman sya kilala at hinde ko pa naririnig side nya, and now na nagkita kami at nag usap, he was nice and ang sarap nya kausap at kasama like wala kang iisiping problem. 

So time pass by and we goods naman, minding our own business then all of a sudden, nagchat sya saken using business acc asking for help kasi maglalayas daw sya kasi nahuli sya ng mom na nagkita may kausap na lalake sa computer. So ako like i said very go with the flow ako and very walang masama, well may masama pero since sinaktan sya ng parenta nya, i do get his point naman and like i always said na im always here for my friends. So i told him na here na sya mag stay as long as he wants so he stayed here for a week, nag inom kami kasi it was his coping mechanism and to forget what happened. 

When he is staying here (mag isa lang naman ako sa house kaya free din talaga yung house ko), feel ko like mag live in partners kami and ayon may nangyare since drunk kami but, wala lang naman samen yon tas because of that, we agreed na maging friends with benefits kami. 

Nung umuwi na sya sa kanila, everything’s good na and hinde sya pinagalitan ng parents nya since mas  worried sila kaysa sa galit sila sa ginawa nya. So ayun mas naging close yung bond namin tas since FWB kami, everytime umiinom kami kahit sa bar, nagkikiss kami pero walang kami. 

Tas there was this one time nag away kami, basta ayon nag away kami and like he unfollowed me sa socials nya lahat ng socials and i was like WTF? I was being a good friend lang naman ganon tas like u-unfollow moko? So ayon i explained my side sa kanya then i blocked him. He apologized for his mistakes naman and our bond grew deeper and deeper. 

Until one time, there was this guy kasi na lagi kong pinupuntahan ko sa qc. He was my friend. We had this plan kasi na since wala kaming ka date, kami mag dedate sa isat isa like it was platonic date like we used to nung new year and Christmas. So ayun merong bulletin sa 7/11 na may sticky notes na heart tas linagay namin namin namin dun at stinory ko. Everything was good naman not until nagulat ako nagstory si vincent ng letter saying na lalayo na sya saken and naka custom lang yung story so if u can read it, it was for you. Yung kanta pa is Selos dun sa gaya sa pelikula na kanta.  So nagulat ako kasi hala bat sya nag seselos? 

Yun pala, he already liked me na pala not just as a friend or FWB but like crush na. I was shocked kasi ako confused kasi kasi i was contemplating if do i liked him ba or i just like the feeling na parang mag live in parters kami? So ayun nafifeel ko nga na lumalayo sya saken. Pag nagkikita kami with friends, hinde na ako yung una nyang binabati or hinde nya na ako maayado ina-awknowledge. 

Syempre nag tampo ako then one night i was drunk and messaged him na baket ganon nakakatampo kasi dati pag chinachat ko sya ang bilis nya mag reply ngayon hinde na, tapos lumalayo sya saken ganon. Tas ayon nagkausap kami ulit and sabi nya sama ako sa bday ng mommy sya sa quezon prov kasi mag swiswimming daw so to make up with me kasi nga diba nagtampo me sa kanya para daw hinde na me magtampo sa kanya. 

So pumunta me. Meron isang guy na nag jojokan sila about magjowa sila and what tas ako, im bothered and jealous ganon. So the entire trip going to quezon prov is badtrip ako. Umulan pa so basa kami sa likod ng pick up. Then mas napikon pako kasi im thinking na “ano ba tong bebe ni vincent di manlang ipahiram sa kanya yung cap nya para hinde mabasa ulo nya” so ako nalang nagpahiram ng cap at twalya sa kanya para hinde sya lamigin at magkasakit. So ayon nung pagka punta namin sa beach, sinuyo ako ni Vincent (HAHAHA kinikilig ako pag naaalala ko) tas ayon he said na friend lang pala nya yung guy and ganon daw talaga sila mag joke. So ako nagselos ako for nothing hahahaha lol. So ayon our trip went well naman and it was perfect and super saya kasi walwal until sunrise ganon na kami lang natirang umiinom kasi ansaya naming dalawa, played volleyball with him kahit masugatsugatan sya sa bato. Basta ang perfect ng araw na yon.

So ayun pauwi na kami, and idk bakit sobrang lungkot ko, nasa likod kami ng pick up. Hinde ako mapakali and super lumbay talaga ako. Para akong sine-sepanx. Then ayun pala i stared catching feelings with him din. I told him na hinde ako sinesepanx sa tao and pag sinepanx ako, alam kong mahal ko na yung tao. So i stared to court Vincent and we are dating and everything is so perfect. 

Now, im happy in our  relationship. Lagi syang andito sa house, but now, hinde na dahil naglayas sya. Dahil mag jowa na kami and ka-close nya na din mga tao dito sa compound here san ako nakatira and mga fam ko here sa compound hahahaha.

Ive been struggling with  ana 3 years ago
 which turned into mia for about 1.5 years . I eventually opened up to my bf (i was still struggling really bad) ab my mia and he would help me prevent a relapse and be very supportive. We also got on the topic on what NOT to say to disorderd people and made it clear many times that havinv one is something competitive ( ex ;me vs my sister) . 

He told me that he wanted to lose fat and build muscle (hes a bit chubby and quite muscular, but thats what i like) and i wasn't really excited ab that idea. He assured me he isnt gonna go too far/obsessive since he knows that i dont like abs on guys. Anyways nowthat he's started uni in the Netherlands and can cook for himself he makes nice warm meals, but when we'd call at the end of the day he would be like "" I only ate once today"" ""i dont like sweets anymore"" ""ive only been drinking water and coffee lately "" and everytime i would clearly show my disinterest everytime he starts that conversation he just keeps on going how little he eats and how he forgets and bla bla bla. Last time he did that i just started crying (he doesnt know) bc i was so angry since he started meal planning out loud and was worried ab his >!calorie intake!<. I didn't tell him anything bc I'd seem like im insensitive and a bitch but he knows ab my past and i still get urges to b/p (not as often anymore) and everytime i want to relapse i tell him and he assures me everything will be ok. So idk why hes doing it. He cant have forgotten. Maybe hes proud of his eating habits? Maybe he wants me to show concern? I cant bc ur a grown ass man already and it just pisses me off.  I just dont know what to do or how to twll him bc i know behind closed doors he still eats little and i still get competitive and try to eat less than him which i clearly don't want.

I thought ""I would like to do that"" so i promptly bought a 10-pack of ozonated olive oil/castor oil suppositories from pur03. 

I followed the directions to a T -- froze the suppositories and used a lube to insert one.  They say in the directions that you might feel an urge to defecate, but should try to retain the suppository for 15-20 minutes to maximize effectiveness.  

After 15 minutes i felt...nothing.  So i put another TWO up there, and waited another 15 minutes...and still nothing. 

I was worried that it had worked but my body hadn't been triggered to expel it, so i made a coffee enema and used that.  When I cleared that out, there was a little bit of white, including a small and clearly active clump about 1/8"" diameter, but overall I wasn't very impressed.  It was certainly not the ""cloud of white candida"" that i had been dreaming of.

For the record, i'm probably somewhere in the middle of my candida clearing.  My candida got turned up to 11 after a COVID infection and i've been fighting it ineffectively for about a year (i only recently added a good biofilm buster).  

My guess is that my candida is a little further up the colon than the suppository could reach?  Or maybe it's just not an effective therapy.  Whatever the case, i was disappointed.  ",1,1730133881.0,Candida,0,1.0,False

She was amazing. A few months before I met her I was stood up, cheated on and ghosted by my previous ex. I got a call from her in January and became insecure and acted like an asshole. I wasn't able to communicate with her for some reason or apologize because my ex told me I was weak.

Towards the end I really blew it where I know she wanted more emotional availability from me and I probably made it seem like I didn't care about her. First by not going with her during our talk after an argument when she said she had to go home and asked me to sleepover and second when she called to end things, she gave me the choice to just call it there or talk later and I asked if she wanted her stuff back and she called me an asshole.

She told me I needed to go to therapy, drank too much and that she didn't want to be a fixer. I spent the next 3 months sober and in therapy and then decided to reach out. She immediately agreed to meet but as friendly friends. I took my friends advice and met her for coffee anyways.

The friends comment got in my head and I was terrified going into it expecting to fail. She asked me how I’d changed immediately and I said I’d been going to therapy and wasn’t drinking. She told me she had been blacking out and only told me I needed to go to therapy because she was drunk. I told her that didn’t matter I needed to hear it. She asked one more time why I went to therapy and I said because I couldn’t communicate with her. 

She then brought up multiple times she couldn’t believe I didn’t bring my new dog. She made a comment about the types of people in my neighborhood and then goes well the guys aren’t that bad. Then I made a comment about my dog being cute and she says “I’m cute”. I couldn’t tell if she was flirting with me or patronizing me. In my mindset I shut down believed I was defeated, never flirted or mentioned trying again and walked away and never contacted her again. 

I stayed in therapy even after that disheartening comment. I understand I wasn't ready to meet with her when I did and it set back my healing process. I'm now at a point where I am ready to communicate and feel like I understand myself and can be emotionally available. But I keep thinking of her and I know she's single.

I’m not sure if it is worth reaching out since I really am a different person now than I was. She was the catalyst that got me to really overcome everything I was harboring from childhood and the past relationship. Logically I know I should leave her alone and the damage is done. But a part of me wants to do one last Hail Mary and I’ll be okay with the outcome either way at least knowing I actually said what I wanted to. Its been almost 6 months since I met with her and 10 since things ended.

In my free time, I enjoy working on coding projects, discovering local Italian cuisine, and having good conversations over coffee. I'm looking for someone who values open communication, has their own ambitions, and is open to the idea of having kids in the future.

While I'm based in Verona, I'm open to connecting with someone anywhere in Europe. I'm happy to host visits in Italy or travel to meet the right person. Distance isn't an issue if we click - we can start online and meet in person when comfortable.

I welcome all nationalities and backgrounds—what matters most is our connection and shared values. If you're looking for something real and this resonates with you, I'd love to hear from you!",1,1730133820.0,MeetPeople,0,1.0,False

We're good friends, I'm still clingy like a bf to him, since, he lets me do that. 

On the other hand, I have friends (7 sila na friends ko), we hang out madalas lately, nag iinom, gumagala out of town and would spend overnight on weekends, basta halos sila ang kasama ko weekly. Wala namang ganap. But sa barkada, may isa dyan na sini-ship kami.. but I dont take their teases seriously, since I am vocal na mahal ko pa rin ex ko, and that guy is straight (daw sabi nya, but hindi ako convinced), now, nagiging close na kami sa isat-isa, btw, he's a new friend, this year ko lang sya nakilala, our presence in socmed is very obvious particularly sa ig, na nagiging usap usapan na sa circle namin na parang may something na daw sa aming dalawa, but I know na wala.. di naman kami naglalandian in private, although I must admit na he's too sweet, but I never assume anything kase sinabi ng isang friend ko na ganyan talaga personality nya. Until napansin na sya ng ex ko sa socmed, na we're too sweet daw sa comsec ng mga posts ko at posts ng mga barkada namin, parang may something daw, it came to the point na nagiging rason na sya ng away namin ng ex ko. Bakit pa daw ako lumalandi sa kanya (ex-bf) na may bago na daw ako. Di naman totoo yon. 

But to be honest, I am sexually attracted to guy, but I am not confirming na may feelings ako ha, siguro dala nalang eto ng wala akong sex life for almost a year, my last sex was with my ex before we broke up. But I feel so much guilt kase mas palagi ko syang kasama, mas madalas communication namin, and na ho-horny ako sa kanya everytime I see him. There's this one time naka angkas sya sa motor ko while we are heading to a grocery store kase naka toka kami dalawa bumili ng mga pagkain namin for our outing kinabukasan.. may something na nakadikit sa likod ko, eventually I realized and I am sure that it was his d*ck, hindi niya inaalis, maluwang pa naman motor ko, and guess what, his thing down there was semi-erect na, and again, hindi nya inaalis on our way sa grocery store pati pabalik sa house ng barkada ko, I can feel his d*ck at naiisip ko ang shape at size na niya, I know it was semi-hard kase nong papalapit na kami sa bahay ng friend namin, dikit parin yung thing niya sa akin but that time, on flaccid state na, kase di ko na masyado maramdaman. Nang dahil dito, mas nalilibugan ako sa kanya. Pero wala talagang nangyari sa amin, kahit madalas magkatabi kami matulog, kahit may mga times na lasing o naka inom kami.

Pero pinag uusapan na kami even outside our circle of friends na nakakakilala sa amin, feeling ko naman na normal lang naman pakikitungo namin sa isat-isa o kulang lang ako ng self-awareness.

But I dont know if this is already a concerning matter, mahal ko ex ko at ayoko sya mawala pero wala na talagang assurance magkabalikan although I know he still loves me. Wala akong plano ipursue yun sa friend ko, nalilibugan lang talaga ako sa kanya. By the way, we have a lot of plans na out of town bonding at overnight, ayokong aabot kami sa point na may mangyari sa aming dalawa.",1,1730133754.0,phlgbt,0,1.0,False

In the month following my arrival, I had an extremely stressful financial aid situation with my home university where I didn't know if I was going to receive the aid they initially said I would get (after weeks of back and forth emails, I did get it). Then I injured myself while around the city, so I didn't want to leave my apartment much to let the injury heal.

I'm a little over halfway through the program, and it feels like it's never going to end. My classes are only once a week now, so I don't see people often. I'm naturally an introvert and have social anxiety, so I normally enjoy my alone time and exploring the city by myself, but the days are dragging on now, and I just want to be back home.

It's also my last semester of college, so I'm applying to a ton of jobs and interviewing for them with a large time zone difference. On top of my other anxieties, I'm also stressed that I'll be unemployed and broke when I return back to the US.

Does anyone have advice for how to make this time pass by more quickly? Or how to try to enjoy more than just a few hours a day?

I do have a spot in the city that I like to go to and sip coffee everyday, and some hobbies I practice that help, but most of the day, I feel like I'm waiting for the clock to run out. Thank you for any advice.

Editing to add: my weekdays where I don't have class, I have homework and essays that I can do remotely. So I end up just writing them at my apartment out of convenience, and since the numerous stairs of accessing the metro make my injury flair up, I avoid taking it to get places.",1,1730133653.0,studyAbroad,1,1.0,False

Moved here earlier this year and while I've definitely met people and made friends, my social life isn't that exciting yet, mainly because most people I've met here already have their own friend groups and social calendars. 

I know that back in LA if I met a random person wanting to grab a coffee platonically, I, too, would likely not prioritize them over my already established group of friends. So I thought the ideal situation is to make some gay friends who are also still kinda new to NYC! 

SO if you're one of those and have any of the following things in common with me, hit me up:
- are an artist (I'm an actor/writer) 
- into Housewives, Drag Race, House of Villains (yes I'm a cliche gay lol) 
- like going to the movies
- like having coffee/drinks/dinner in cute establishments (that aren't snobbish ""it"" spots and don't cost a whole month's rent to frequent) 
- like working/writing in cute cafes 
- like reading fiction
- into any kind of murder mysteries (TV, film, books)
- into RPGs and D&D 
- into board games
- into working out
- into exploring the city
- not into drugs or ""partying hard""

I'm open to any ages (depending on maturity) but I find I relate the most to friends in their 30s and 40s.

On mornings when I don't have work, I feel this weird mix of guilty, anxious and sad pretty much immediately after waking up. Like my brain is screaming at me that I'm wasting time, that I need to get to it, despite not having an 'it' to get to. 

I got this feeling a LOT during the pandemic, resulted in me going out on long walks and going thrifting pretty much daily. It seems like as long as I'm moving, being active, doing SOMETHING that counts as an 'it' to my brain that I'm getting to and I'm satisfied. Because walking is exercise, that's productive. Thrifting is looking for clothing to build my wardrobe, that's productive. 

Lately, if I can calm down long enough to take my medication and sit with a cup of coffee and some breakfast, the feeling of urgency dies down and I can relax a bit, get to you know. ACTUALLY being productive. 

For a while I figured it was left over issues I had from an ex friend I lived with who was super not cool about me wasting time (kinda did work exchange for her but she was SUPER toxic and very strict about waking up at a certain time, not taking naps or breaks etc) but I'm wondering if any of my other ADHD sisters, brothers and nonbinaries have this feeling?

I have just gotten back from work, I sat down on the couch, and turned on the TV, and this is the first thing I see? Seriously? Can't this shit go any further? I stood up, and went to make some coffee. I know, it's kind of weird making coffee in the middle of the night, but I have a lot of work to do. When I was in the kitchen, I grabbed my favorite mug and turned on the coffee machine. I was very tired at the time, with every second I felt like I was just going to fall over and fall asleep. I couldn't let that happen. As the coffee machine was doing it's thing, went to back to the living room to turn off the TV. As I was walking my eye caught something. A strange dark figure with a black hoodie, and some gloves, standing in the middle of the street, it's back facing me. I didn't think much of it and went to turn of the TV and to get my coffee.

I got my coffee and went up the stairs to my office. I turned the lights on, shut the door and sat down in my chair. I put the coffee on the desk and started doing my paperwork. As I was writing, I heard someone scream outside. That really knocked me out. I quickly stood up, and ran to the nearest window. There was nothing outside, only a car passing by. I pushed the door as fast as possible and ran downstairs, nothing. Silence. I felt something…odd. Like I wasn't alone, someone was watching me, I felt the dread seep over me.

I turned around. He was standing there…looking at me, now seeing him up close and personal was a terrifying experience. He Had a large smile on his face, with large eyes and dilating pupils. I looked away for one second and suddently, he just vanished. My first instinct was to run as fast as possible. I ran upstairs quickly, entered my office and shut the door and locked it. I hid under the table and called 911. My breathing was getting deeper and deeper. I felt dizzy and terrified. Felt like I could pass out any second.

A few minutes have passed, but the police still weren't here. I slowly get up from under the desk. I turn around and go to the office window. I saw him, standing there, in the middle of the street, his gaze piercing me. I unlocked the door and went downstairs, step by step. When I got down, I looked at him through the downstairs window. He was still there. I locked the back door and closed all the windows, hoping, that the police would arrive faster. But… I felt like something wasn't right. He was right infront of me…outside…but I still felt that something was wrong.

I was looking at him, and his smile got even bigger, with those blunt, little teeth. Suddently, I felt a sense of dread, and breathing on the back of my neck. There were two of them.",1,1730132632.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1ge69eo,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ge69eo/first_time_posting_looking_for_suggestions/,First Time Posting - Looking for Suggestions,"Like most here I have a severe problem with alcohol use. 

Most of my life I have never drank, even in college it just didn't appeal to me. 

Casual drinks led to weekend parties, which led to a shot in the coffee, and now it's gotten to the point my body will not function throughout the day without alcohol. 

The amount I consume daily is incredible. I've injured myself being a drunken fool, I've jeopardized my job, I've put an incredible strain and my partner and our relationship. 

I make sure to go to different liquor stores in different parents of town so that the cashiers don't judge me TOO hard. 

Multiple loved ones and people around me have confronted me with this problem, it's obvious. I see all of these awful things that I do and my life is spiraling.

Yet I. Still. Drink.

I guess the point of this post is to try and start putting myself around people who understand, who have been sick and shaking in the morning and still wanting a drink after. 

I have been thinking about a detox program/in patient center but I dont want to further jeopardize my job by taking time off or potentially having to explain what I'm going to do.

Any advice or words of encouragement are greatly appreciated. 

Alcohol will take everything from you and still make you think you need more.

I eventually determined that coffee had gotten between the top burr's ""crush ring"" (not sure the proper term for it) and grinder base and created a physical obstruction which prevented the top burr from tightening closer to the bottom burr.

I hit this issue again today and got to thinking about why it might be occurring and my guess is that I switch between drip and espresso settings but mostly leave the grinder configured for drip. This creates a bigger gap between the top burr and the base which over time allows coffee to work its way in. Then I switch to espresso which tightens the burr and moves it closer to the base, compresses the coffee, and prevents the burr from reaching closer to zero.

I couldn't find any information other folks hitting this online and couldn't figure out if other people aren't noticing, or if I'm one of the odd few using the grinder more from drip rather than espresso.",1,1730132553.0,DF64,0,1.0,False

years now, it’s been fine and was really exciting for a while because i was learning something new and i genuinely really enjoy food & bev & this was my first restaurant gig. i guess the hard part has become the social aspect of people wanting to get to know me more & “what do you like to do for fun” is a question that somehow can ruin my whole day bc i realize that i don’t have a damn clue. i know i don’t like being at work and count the seconds until my next day off but usually my days off consist of doing whatever cleaning/laundry is necessary & then ending up in what feels like a mental paralysis trying to figure out what to do that might be fulfilling, i like
making my coffee or going to get one, i enjoy thrifting and making new outfits (im not that creative but it brings a lot of joy), i’ve started reading more, i enjoy cooking & going to get a nice meal, i like listening to music & my favorite podcasts. sometimes i get into the gym for a couple weeks at a time and i do feel my best during those periods bc i can tell myself at least i’m doing THAT, but the littlest thing will make me fall off the wagon and it’s hard getting back to it. i guess my issue is that i don’t know how fulfilling these things are as much as they’re just feeding my ADHD riddled brain another dopamine snack, i don’t dive into any of these things enough to call them hobbies. i’m no coffee enthusiast, im not curating my closet, im reading to avoid scrolling through social media and absolutely frying my brain more, i listen to the same songs that made me feel something i felt once and am desperately clinging onto in hopes it might spark something again, the podcasts i listen to aren’t really informative as much as they are just chatter that my brain probably likes bc it feels like a social thing. i didn’t grow up with a lot of money so i think spending money is also something that presses the dopamine button that i’m really trying to avoid. i’m trying to grow a personality again, i want to have goals or some kind of ambition but i mostly just want to feel like i’m not wasting my life away, which is the prevalent feeling i end off most days with & i go to bed and wake up the next day ready to try again but eventually slipping into my downward spiral. i try to focus on the little things & i really am grateful for those little things but i fear it’s just not enough, maybe it’s the capitalist brain rot that makes me feel this way and that i need more, more, more. but i just want to feel & i want something to be passionate about. im open to trying new things. i just dont know what would suit me & maybe this is just what being twenty-something is, and i hope so bc i don’t want to feel like this forever ",1,1730132358.0,DecidingToBeBetter,3,1.0,False

All of the workers there were people of colour and of the same race, [i dont have a problem with working with any race btw Im just conflicted] and the owner said they'll talk to the other owner [co-owners] and see if they can take me in for an hour training session but it's been 5 days.

My parents say it's because it's racial even though it's illegal and ppl still do it. They are racists but they still well put that in my head so I am having thoughts like would they really not hire me because I'm not the same race? 

I just wanna make coffees 😭
