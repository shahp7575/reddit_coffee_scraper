Would love to make new long time friends and have people to talk with. I am happily taken and have no interest in anything more than having friends. I mostly use snapchat for chatting but discord could be okay too. Let's start the talking here though. 🔮

I love anything horror, gothic, pagan, dark and peculiar. HUUUGE coffee lover as it's sometimes the only thing keeping me from insanity in the cold here. I love spending time studying and gaming. Hiking and gym too. I do like to visit a shooting range few times a month too. Interested in cars and have one of my own too which i do spend time on. My ultimate all time fave game is skyrim but atm i spend my time playing mw3. Would love to find someone to game with!

I do get busy but i always anwser when i have the time. 

My music taste is a bit weird as my fave genres are country and deathcore. I do love the lord of the rings and have been crazy about pokemon too for a long time. Patiently waiting for terrifier 3 as it's one of my top faves. 

If ya feel like you'd like to get to know me better, send me a message. 🖤 Please tell me a bit about yourself. Age, sex, etc. There's a 90% chance i won't anwser to only a ""hey"". I would prefer people around 18-30 years old. Someone who likes to keep in touch and helps me keep the convo going would be nice. 

Hope i'll hear from you. 🦇

1fyul7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellington/comments/1fyul7b/how_to_recreate_the_workfromhome_experience_in/,How to Recreate the Work-from-Home Experience in the Office,"Step 1: Dress for the Gloom

  
First off, let's talk attire. Ditch the whole “business casual” façade. We’re going full “I just rolled out of bed, into the miserable Wellington drizzle, and waited 90 minutes for a bus that never arrived.” Show up to the office in your comfiest onesie. That pair of sweatpants with questionable stains? Perfect! If you really want to make a statement, rock a hoodie that smells faintly of last week’s takeout and stale Panhead. When someone inevitably asks why you look like a hot mess, just shrug and say, “I’m embracing the Wellington vibe—the hopelessness of Manners chic.”

Step 2: Create a Distraction Graveyard

  
No home office is complete without distractions, so set up a chaos corner at your desk. Stack some unfinished laundry—bonus points if it's a pile that’s been there since your last stint in the office. Toss in some half-eaten takeout containers from last week, and don’t forget the ancient mug that survived too many dreary Monday mornings. Bonus points if you have an old Fidels takeout cup (you can't afford that anymore). Every time you look at it, remind yourself of how bleak life is when you have to work surrounded by four walls and a string of endless meetings.

Step 3: Dinner Leftovers Are Your Best Friends

  
Ah, food—the only thing keeping you from plunging into the depths of office despair. Thanks to the rising cost of living, indulging in daily coffee runs and lunch at the café has become a thing of the past. So, channel your inner frugality and make the most of last night’s dinner. Pack up those leftovers—whether it was a sad stir-fry or an ambitious attempt at gourmet pasta—and bring them to the office. Reheated Goan fish curry is always a hit! When lunchtime rolls around, fire up that microwave and serve your delicious meal while pretending to be a top chef.

Step 4: Steal Supplies Like a Pro

  
While we’re on the topic of cutting costs, it’s time to embrace your inner kleptomaniac. Pens? Paperclips? Staplers? They’re all fair game! Why shell out your hard-earned cash when you can “borrow” supplies from the office? Just think of it as a small offset against your commute costs. Every time you pilfer a couple of Post-it notes or a ream of paper, remind yourself that you’re being resourceful. Besides, it’s practically a rite of passage for public servants in Wellington, and it gives you something to talk about during the inevitable small talk.

Step 5: Bring Back the Zoom Experience

  
What’s an office without a bit of the Zoom call experience? To truly embrace that vibe, bring in a lifeless cardboard cutout of your favorite celebrity or a stuffed animal to sit across from you. Talk to it during meetings and make it nod in agreement while you ramble on about deadlines and budget cuts. If anyone asks, just say it’s your emotional support plushie. Extra points for swigging from a bottle of cheap red wine while slurring, “Do you know who I am?” if anybody questions your nutritional choices.

Step 6: Master the Art of Work-Life Imbalance

  
One of the best parts of working from home was the blissful blur between work and life. Bring that energy to the office by habitually checking emails while scrolling through memes about Wellington’s persistent rain. If your boss walks by, laugh awkwardly and say you’re multitasking. After all, in a city where the sun is as rare as a parking space, who wouldn’t want to live dangerously? Randomly fall asleep at your desk. Just.. because.

Step 7: Decorate with Depressing Elegance

  
Transform your dull office space into a “home away from home” by plastering it with a collection of half-hearted motivational posters and your favorite sad quotes. Extra bonus for the largest “Live, Laugh, Love” poster you can find. Hang up photos of Wellington on particularly gloomy days—clouds, rain, and maybe a few seagulls looking lost and confused. If you can find a pot plant that’s clinging to life, name it “Dismal Dave” or “Eeyore the Fern.” If anyone questions your decor, just tell them it’s a statement on the state of public service.

Step 8: Embrace the Wellington Shuffle

  
Finally, adopt the Wellington shuffle when it comes to your office hours. Arrive late because, let’s face it, the weather is too grim to rush, and you definitely weren’t going to waste your last few dollars on overpriced coffee. Leave early for those “personal appointments” that really just involve searching for the nearest (not Cuba Street) cheap café—because if you can’t afford to eat out anymore, at least you can go to a café and pretend you’re treating yourself. When anyone asks how you maintain such flexible hours, shrug and say, “You know how it is—living the dream in a city where even the clouds look like they want to cry.”",5,1728374430.0,Wellington,1,0.78,False

1fyuinv,https://www.reddit.com/r/projectzomboid/comments/1fyuinv/something_is_wrong_losing_health_and_gaining/,Something Is Wrong: Losing Health and Gaining Fatigue RAPIDLY,"My character sometimes gets injured and rapidly gains fatigue and loses health. It's happened twice now and both times, I believe, when I've been heavily encumbered. I've been max overloaded before and never taken this amount of damage and fatigue. I mean, I rapidly lose health and fatigue. Like within 30-50 seconds I gain three stacks of fatigue and lose around 3/4 of my health. Again, I've been max encumbered before and while I may lose anywhere from 1/4 or maybe even 1/2 health, it never got this low or my fatigue so high so fast.

 The only thing I can think of is my game minimized to desktop, I think because of some app or notification, and I got bit. Because it wasn't my fault I was fine with using the cheat mod to heal myself. But this was quite some time ago, though I think I set my zombification timeframe quite long. Even so, I've never got any other symptoms of zombification. No sickness of any kind. No anxiety.

The most recent time this has happened, I did some testing with the cheat menu and healed myself, but my health and fatigue continued to be affected and rapidly changed. However, when I quite and went back in to the game it stopped. I really don't know what's going on and I verry much doubt it's just being encumbered that's the problem. Like I said, I have been before and have been after the first incident.

I guess I'll also add, though from what I understand it doesn't matter, but I'm on day 22 and I've never slept. I've just taken vitamins, coffee, and I have an energy drink mod. From what I understand this doesn't matter and if it did, I figure I would have had problems weeks ago.

I’m heading to Tokyo/Kyoto mid November. 

It’s my first time going to Japan (technically 2nd, but let’s just say that trip didn’t count). 

I am finding a lot of nice sushi and ramen and coffee shops online and adding them to my Google map. 

Can anyone recommend—in either city—sushi restaurants that are in the $100 per person range?  For some reason, it seems like I am only finding casual-sushi restaurants (fairly modest pricing but nice reviews) or high-tier restaurants for $250+ per person.   Is there a giant gap of medium-tier sushi restaurants in Tokyo/Kyoto?

Also, it looks like all the good beef places (I believe called wagyu or kobe) are $400 per person and reservations are not easy to get. Are there more modestly priced options for kobe or wagyu beef, or are they all like this?  By comparison, in the USA, you can get steak anywhere from $20 to $50 to $100 to $200. All price ranges have good options, of course with different levels of quality and experience. But I am not seeing that in Japan. There seems to only be a high-priced entry point for kobe/wagyu. Can anyone tell me if they recommend any places in the $100-$150 per person range, or does that not exist?

And thirdly, I am very much looking forward to ramen and udon. But I do not know if these dishes are typically always modestly-priced and not sophisticated (ie, like a hamburger in the USA, they’re all different but sorta in the same price tier;  you’re not gonna get a burger from a super high-end restaurant, even though they probably offer one on the menu for fairly cheap). While I am searching for good looking ramen/udon places, would you say that there definitely is a huge range of quality, or am I basically getting the same experience anywhere I go?   If so, maybe you can recommend some of these places too.

1fyueir,https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalScopists/comments/1fyueir/welcome_to_rdigitalscopists/,Welcome to r/DigitalScopists,"First of all, thank you for dropping by my new subreddit. I created this group for the benefit of self-employed or contracted scopists and transcriptionists, both legal and general. I happen to wear these three hats myself. We will concentrate on the role of the scopist, ideas on how and where to find clients, and to dispense encouragement, advice, and share interesting vignettes about our experiences in our career field. This introductory post does talk a lot about transcription as I believe that it is an essential skillset to be learned prior to becoming a scopist. But in this subreddit, r/DigitalScopists, we will be concentrating more on the scoping industry. If one is a court reporter or someone else in the legal field wanting to hire scopists, you are free to post your ads. Scopists looking for work are also free to post an advertisement for their services. I ask that we are all respectful of one another. As the moderator of this subreddit, I will warn and then suspend or ban those who don't want to abide by the rules. Absolutely no politics or political/social discourse is allowed here. There are plenty of subreddits for that sort of bs. 

I want to give you all some background about myself and my journey to becoming first a transcriptionist and then a scopist. I am a retired teacher who enjoyed a fulfilling 32-year career as an educator. I spent the majority of my career teaching fourth and fifth grades, but I started as a fifth/sixth combo teacher, and ironically, I ended my time as an educator teaching a fifth/sixth combo. In between, I taught fifth grade for 24 years, fourth for 4 years, seventh and eighth English for 1 year, and high school English for 1/3 of a year, after I retired. I agreed to do that as the regular teacher resigned after her maternity leave expired. 

My wife, also a retired teacher, battles MS, and by 2018, it was no longer safe or practical for her to be home by herself for long periods as she was susceptible to falls and would be unable to get out of the house by herself. While she still can drive when necessary, she cannot climb into the car unaided. So, in June of 2018 at the age of 58, I retired. I did some substituting for the next two years as my mom, though elderly, was in good health and a retired nurse, was able to help for a couple of days per month. Alas, in March of 2020, as you know, the pandemic shut schools -- and most everything else -- down. Substitutes were no longer needed.

As I had just reached 60 by this time, I found myself still needing an income. I wanted to work from home, so I came across and ad from TranscribeAnywhere. I took the free mini-course/workshop and I knew I had found my niche. Having taught language arts in school, it was a good fit. What drew me to TranscribeAnywhere for transcription training was that they do not fill up your ears with promises of easy wealth or get-rich-quick schemes. There are no spiels of golden parachutes or making an easy six-figured income by sending emails via some nebulous 'companies.' That is not reality. The only people making money on those schemes and frauds are the ones perpetuating those lies. Janet, the founder of TranscribeAnywhere, who owns her own transcription company, laid everything out about the industry in easy-to-grasp terms. She emphasized the fact that one must learn to earn, that there are no shortcuts to success, and in order to be successful in transcription, one needs to be willing to work, put in the time and effort, and exercise self-discipline. In other words, one must be based in reality and the real world. There is no substitute for work and learning.

Look, reality is what it is. You are probably not going to become fabulously wealthy being a transcriptionist or a scopist. However, as you get acclimated to the industry and gain experience and put in the time and work, you can make a good, comfortable living. Best of all, you get to work on your terms, on your schedule, and you have a short commute to work, depending how long the distance from your bedroom, down the hall, and to your home office is. LOL. No more traffic jams eating up valuable time, no particular dress codes, no office politics and bs, either. You can take your lunch when you want and for how long you want. You can run errands and come back to your work later if you choose. Did you know that your home office is a write-off on your federal taxes? You can write-off your coffee and one meal a day? Yes, you want to save receipts. Any software and hardware, office supplies, a portion of your utilities are all write-offs. The savings in gas will be substantial, car maintenance costs will drop. You will have to go through the health exchange, depending on your state, for health insurance, but that too, is a substantial write-off.

Anyway, to make a short story long, which I am doing, lol, get the proper training. Don't try training yourself by transcribing for what we transcriptionists and scopist call, the sweatshops of the industry: the big box transcription companies. TranscribeAnywhere is competely online and very cost effective. Being an educator with graduate work in curriculum and instruction, I can vouch for the fact that the courses through TranscribeAnywhere are pedagogically sound with the right amount of theory, practice, and application. It is rigorous without being overwhelming. The way that the practice files are stepped and structured will naturally increase your typing speed. Do not stress with grammar and punctuation issues, as this course will help correct any deficiencies or lack of confidence that you may have. When you are finished with either the general transcription course or the legal transcription course, you will be equipped to start your transcription career.

Through collaboration with The Court Reporting Academy (TCRA), I received my training as a certified digital scopist. A scopist will use an AI software platform, like in my case, Autoscript desktop, to create a rough transcript, and through the tools on the software, you are able to listen to the audio and format and proof that rough transcript. Though scoping can be used with general transcription, and TranscribeAnywhere will provide that training, scoping traditionally is associated with the legal field. Scopists often work with court reporters. They will take a transcript and the audio file, and the scopist, using CaseCatalayst, Eclipse, or Autoscript, will refine and format the transcript into a professional, legal-ready transcript to be certified by the court. It is a fascinating field.

Though the main purpose of this subreddit is not to sell you something, if you want to find out more about the free workshop offered by TranscribeAnywhere, I will make it easy for you. There is no cost for this workshop. If you are interested in purchasing a course from TranscribeAnywhere, it is essential to take the free on-line workshop to see that it is a fit for you and to learn about the industry first. I do not want people to lay out hard-earned money on something that they find out is not right for them or they lose interest in. There is no hard-sell techniques or gimmickry; there are no promises of easy wealth, nor is there any arm twisting. You watch and listen to the workshop, and either you are interested or you are not. Then, and only then, should you purchase one of the courses. And if you do, be prepared to work, learn, and to stick to the plan. I would suggest learning transcription and then become part of the TA family as your association, mentoring, and additional benefits don't end with graduating. You become a lifelong member or TA. with any new offerings being available to you as they come out. Then if you are interested in adding scoping, you can do that too. TA members will have an avenue available. Here is the link to the free workshop.

**Training**:

This was my B race, a tune up half before my first full marathon (NYC) in 4 weeks. A few friends were running it and I jumped in just for fun. Since the start of August I’ve been following Hansons/Luke Humphrey’s 16 week NYC specific plan, averaging 55-60mpw. It’s based on classic Hanson plan but substitutes some of the speed/strength workouts for hill workouts. I had added some extra easy miles but kept the long run to 16 miles and did not modify any of the quality SOS days except sometimes having to do a slightly longer cooldown to get home. 

Up to the tune up half I had done 3 60+ mile weeks, highest 62, with the other weeks 54-57, and ran 4 16 miler long runs. My week usually went Mon- speed/hills/strength, Tue- easy w hills, Wed- easy, Thu- MP tempos, Fri- easy, Sat- long run w hills, Sun- rest/swim. I never missed a day but failed to hit paces on 2 recent workouts - a 2x4 mile MP tempo and a 2x5 mile MP tempo, 2 weeks apart, that I attributed to a gel that just did not work for me (common factor in both days). Both days I could only do 3-4 miles at MP before I knew something was off (mile 2 effort felt like mile 7 last week etc) and gave up, but both days I felt better by the afternoon and ran a second run and got in the originally planned volume at both MP and total. Other than that I executed every workout. I was feeling a bit uneasy with the 2 failed MP workouts, but sandwiching both were 8 mile continuous MP tempos that I did hit and felt strong on.

I did yoga 3-4x a week, no other strength or cross training. No injuries or niggles, felt much better than the last cycle where I tried to fit in 2x strength on top. Weekly is usually 1 vinyasa class for strength/core, 1 hips/shoulders class, 1 stretch & splits, and 1 inversions class for fun. Foam rolling and massage ball when watching TV. 

Nutrition wise I practiced getting in 60g/h of carbs on every SOS day. Through trial and error I found out I need at least 1000mg in sodium (a lmnt or 4 nuuns) on runs >10 miles/90min in my home climate. 



**Goal / Paces:** 

I live/train in Singapore where it’s super hot and humid (84-90F, 85-90% humidity even at 5-6am), and all my workouts were ran to a 3:40 goal marathon pace. My 3:40 goal was set from a 5k (23min) parkrun in this weather. I knew I would be faster in cooler weather but did not have confidence in how much faster to target. My Garmin said 1:40 so I decided to go for 1:40. Before this I ran my first marathon in Dec 2022 in 2:02, had a baby, then ran my second in March this year in Japan (1:52, followed Hansons beginner half book plan) at 6mo post partum. I figured 1:40 was nice because it translates to a 3:30 full per the Hansons calculator and that was the old BQ standard for me. So I set a goal pace of 7:40/mile for the half (which I  miscalculated by failing to account for the 0.1 and the extra distance I will likely need to run, ran 13.36 total) and hoped for the best. I trained in Endorphin Speeds / Shifts and laced up the Endorphin Elites for the race. I did not do any HMP workouts and that made me a bit nervous. 



**Mini Taper:**

The week of the half I did my normal speed workout on Mon (a hill workout), then ran Tue easy, Wed 10 mile easy but hilly, Thu/Fri super easy, Sat off (did a 1 hour bike ride to explore Rottnest), then Sun was the race. I didn’t want to taper too much since my peak week for the marathon is actually the week after the half. So I still ran 55 miles the week of the half (including the half) and will ramp up after for 1 more week to 60 before the marathon taper. I felt pretty decent by Sun morning but it was obviously not a full taper. I had 2 glasses of wine on Fri for the pre race dinner with friends which was a mistake, because I didn’t sleep super well Fri or Sat and woke up with a migraine on Sat so had to take 4 Excedrins over the course of Sat. My Garmin Training Readiness read 87 on Sun morning. 



**Carb loading:**

I took this as an opportunity to practice carb loading, since I haven’t done it for any long runs yet aside from eating a pasta dinner the night before. I ate more bread on Thu, ate an extra Precision 90g gel on Fri/Sat (this is the one that did not work for me and what I took on the 2 failed MP runs, so I figured I use it to carb load instead), and ate pizza/pasta on Sat for lunch/dinner. I don’t count and ate intuitively but figured I probably get in 200-250g of carbs normally, and Featherstone recommends 400g for a 3 day carb load for the marathon, so an extra 80-90g can come from gel/carbs and the rest I will just pivot to more pasta/pizza/bread but stop when I feel full. Featherstone also talks about hyper hydrating so I drank a lmnt on Sat night to try. I felt uncomfortable but not super stuffed. My running shorts were normally a bit loose but felt tight on race morning. 



**Race Day:**

Race was at 8am. I got up at 6am and drank 1/2 of a Maurten 320 and a coffee. I took the other half and sipped on it as we left for the race, and kept 1/4 for just before. The weather was warmer than I hoped, 72-74F with humidity at 86%, but relative to the Singapore weather it was still much easier to run. With 10min to go I finally made it to the rest room, drank the last 1/4 of my Maurten, ditched my sweater, and got in with the wave 1 runners. 

The first mile was a bit crowded but it thinned out pretty fast. I took off and was running 7:30ish, felt pretty good, saw my HR was low in the 130s, and it felt pretty manageable. The was 118m (387ft) of total elevation gain and it was mostly in the first half. I slowed to 7:50-8:10 on the ups, and ran 6:50-7 on the downs, focusing on even effort. I find it easy to just let gravity do the work on the downhills, and folks would often pass me on the ups and I would pass them on the downs. 

The first half I ran 7:20-7:30s miles, and my HR was still reading 130s-140s, and somehow even trended down. At this point it dawned on me that the HR must be wrong because on my last half in Japan (which was much colder in the 40s-50s F) my HR was in the 150s-160s, and rose to 170s on the last few miles. I was running to the effort that I could recall from the Japan half as best as I can so it’s unlikely my HR was actually only 130-140s. By mile 6 or 7 when we got out of the tunnel the sun was out in full blast and it got quite a bit warmer. It started to feel hard by mile 9 to hold on to the pace but I knew it was relatively flat from there on out and figured I had banked a bit of time in the first half that if I just held on and ran the remaining miles at 7:40 I would hit my goal. With this being my B race I also didn’t want to risk overdoing it and decided I will just try to hit the 1:40.  I kept the pace even around 7:40 to the finish.

I felt like I could’ve dug a bit deeper but it was a hard 9/10 effort. In my last half I accelerated significantly in the last 3 miles and felt like I had left a lot in the tank, but this one felt like it was an even, properly paced effort. I didn’t double over at the finish, I felt pretty good after, and felt like I could’ve kept running (at a slower pace) if I had to. This was a 14 min PR from 6mon ago, it felt a bit surreal that my HM pace went down by about a minute per mile in just 6 months! The 5k park run I had ran in Singapore (in 90F weather) at the start of my marathon block to set a goal pace was 7:24 miles, and on Sun I held 7:33 for a half, only 9 sec/mile slower than my 5k PR. Since I don’t race in Singapore given the heat/humidity, I ended up setting my PRs for every single distance from 5k to the half marathon on Sun, without any HM specific training or a full taper. 

Nutrition wise I took 4 untapped gels, 1 caffeinated and 3 salted, and took them at 3, 6 (caffeinated), 8.5, 11.5 miles. The plan was to take them every 3 miles. The water stations were a bit sparse, only 5 total I think, and there was a long stretch of what felt like 4+ miles without any. I usually run with a hydration vest w a 1.5L bladder but since NY does not allow them I wanted to try running without the pack and only took a 350ml handheld bottle. I tried to drink from the cups for the first 2 water stations and failed, but figured out by the 3rd station it was easier to just pour 3-4 cups into my bottle as I ran through and it would be 75% full. I started my bottle with a half pack of lmnt (figuring it was cooler and I wouldn’t need as much sodium), and that was gone by mile 4. I also made the mistake of not looking at what I was grabbing (course was offering both water and gatorade) and took a half bottle of gatorade by accident, which exceeded the g/h of carbs I was used to practicing with and also didn’t sit very well in my stomach as I had never trained with it. I was feeling a bit of stomach cramps by mile 9 or 10 but it was manageable.



**Post Race:**

I drank a bottle of water, picked up my drop bag, changed, and mixed up my protein shake that I had prepared. I tried to drink some gatorade but that didn’t feel very good and I also really didn’t feel like eating either. Stretched and waited around a bit for my friends to finish, took photos, and took the train back to the hotel where I had some pastries, yogurt, fruit. We then took a lovely visit to Swan Valley for wine tasting and lunch/dinner. Unfortunately I realised as I was getting ready for bed that I had dropped my AirPods when I was changing earlier, and it was still somewhere in Optus Stadium. Since I was flying out the day after I figured if I had any hope of finding them I would need to go down that night, and after much pleading with the security guards found them in a locked container behind a restricted fence at 11pm (someone must have found them and gave it to the staff). The security guards couldn’t open it and told me I had to come back the next day, but it worked out in the end and I got them back the next morning. 

The day after I couldn’t waste the chance to run in the cooler weather one more time, so did an 8.5 mile recovery run and it actually felt really good. My HR was reading in the 120s the entire time at a 9:30-9:45ish pace - I had never seen my HR in the 120s! In Singapore I run 10.30-11 min miles as my recovery pace and my HR is still in the high 130s to mid 140s. 



**Marathon Goal:**

If I use the Hanson race equivalency calculator this half suggests I can finish a full between 3:26 (by strava time) and 3:29 (by official).  But Garmin only predicts 3:36. Since NY is a hard course I’m wondering how much I need to adjust that by to account for the hills. On the other hand I’ve done a lot of hill specific workouts and didn’t struggle with the 2 bridges on Sun, and I didn’t have the benefit of a full taper for this half. So should I target 3:30 or 3:40?",1,1728373103.0,Marathon_Training,0,1.0,False

**A little bit of a long story (sorry)**

Some background info: I (31F) have lived in a foreign country for five years. Recently, I have decided that this would be my final year, and I would leave in 2025 \[next summer\].   


I have been on and off the dating apps while living abroad and have met some wonderful people and also met some truly trash human beings. I once again downloaded Tinder for the millionth time while feeling particularly bored and lonely \[I live in a smaller rural area\]. While swiping, I matched with a dude who, for the sake of this story, we will call Jay.   


After talking for a little bit on Tinder, we moved to Instagram and almost immediately set up a date. On the first date, he came to my area, and we had coffee. Everything was clicking, the conversation flowed, and it was electric. I mentioned that I was planning on leaving the country next summer, and he was a little disappointed, but he decided he wanted to spend more time with me, and we scheduled a second date.   


The second date rolled around, and once again, everything was wonderful. He picked me up, even though I have my own vehicle and I live quite far from him. He insisted that he wanted to pick me up. We had planned to go watch a movie, but instead, we got lost in conversation at a cafe and had dinner together. It has been a while since I met someone with whom I have genuinely connected, and I was very excited at the prospect of what could be between us. But also knew in the back of my mind that whatever this was between had an expiration date as I would be leaving and heading back to my home country.   


After the second date, communication between us became limited, and it felt like he was slightly distancing himself from me, which made me slightly upset. I decided to have a girl's night in his neck of the woods, and while I was out drinking, he sent me a message and asked if he could come and see me. He even offered to drive me and my friend back home. By this time, it was almost three in the morning, and my friend and I live a good 40+ minutes away from the area where we were drinking. But this man insisted, came to see me, and drove me and my friend home.   


To say that at this point, I was smitten would be an understatement. It was one of the nicest, kindest, most considerate things anyone has done for me in a long time, and he made it seem like it was no big deal at all. We had not kissed at this point, but I felt tonight would be the night. I thanked him for driving me home, and he said it was his pleasure. We got out of the car, stood there, looked up at the stars, and hugged goodnight. He made his way back to his car, and I felt I couldn't let this moment go without kissing him, so I told him to wait, grabbed his arm and kissed his cheek, and then he kissed me. It was truly magical.   


I get into my house, and then my world falls apart. I get the dreaded ""we need to talk text"" from Jay. He is still outside of my house at this point, and I am freaking out. He tells me he has feelings for me, but we have no future because I am leaving the country, and he is scared if we continue to see each other. Of course, logically, I understand that nothing serious could happen between us, and I told him I would respect his decision if he wanted to end it.   


He asked me to come back outside, and I did. He grabbed me and kissed me passionately; again, I felt like I was in a movie kissing him under the stars at four in the morning. It was all perfect, but then he said we needed to stop seeing each other while holding my hands. I am upset and tearing up and don't want it to end, but I don't know what to say. I felt like I should have fought harder for him to not end it, but I was just so shaken that I could only stand there and tell him to take care of himself.   


We kiss again and he says if he ever visits my country he will reach out and walks back to his car. I am devestated and I am crying walking back to my door. I wish I would have turned around and said please don't do this. I wish I didn't just walk away, I wish I fought harder. But I just let him go and I now I am truly just so sad and upset and don't know how to move on. Maybe I got attached too quickly, after all we only had two dates and met three times. But honestly, he really felt like the right person at the wrong time.   


I don't know what I am looking for at this point, maybe some comfort... someone to tell me it's going to be okay, maybe some stories that can relate to mine. People say there is no such thing as the right person at the wrong time because it will never be the wrong time for the right person. But I feel so gutted right now, I know he cares for me, and I care for him, but we can't be together, and all I want is for him to change his mind.   


I just feel like we didn't even have a chance to see if this could have been anything. We didn't have a chance for it to fail, he bailed before it got too real which I respect but at the same time I just wish we could have continued and seen where it could have gone.

We drive to each other and stay with each other, so our travel costs to see each other are not much at all. 

I would say we have a great relationship, we've had our communication mishaps and issues like anyone else, but we are headed somewhere solid and continuing to build and grow together. I truly do love this man. 

When it comes to money, we both have well paying jobs, our fair share of bills, and we each do pay for things in the relationship, such as travel costs or vacations. However, he insists on paying for much of our dates although I always offer. But keep in mind because we're long distance it's not like we are doing dates once a week or anything like that, it's more so concentrated into our visits with each other. He also does gift me other experiences occasionally, like a fancier dinner date, a bottle of wine that we pick out together, concert tickets, or sent me food when I'm sick a few times, writes notes around the house for me.   I'm extremely grateful for all he does, and I truly do feel loved by him. So this is absolutely not a case of him being cheap or not a loving partner. 

However, I will admit that I miss more  physical gifts especially being long distance. He did buy me beautiful flowers on V day, and a small gift on my birthday in addition to a wonderful weekend away so the thoughtfulness is there, but other times, I miss getting a thoughtful physical gift, even if it was something that isn't very fancy. On Christmas, I paid careful attention to things he wanted and asked for, got one large item, and quite a few smaller items, and he loved it all; his gift to me was not good quality at all and was a few random items felt he put together in 5 mins. 2 of the items I couldn't use at all, as one didn't work (he did later exchange for a better one which was nice ) and the other was too bulky for its purpose. The ideas were okay, but the items themselves were flimsy and cheap, and I was honestly pretty disappointed as I would've rather he compiled that money to get one decent thing off the bat instead of a few flimsy things. He did get me a few things on one of his vacations once and it was pretty much the only time. 

I just sent him some small gifts 
As I know he has been stressed, and I was never a tit for tat person but couldn't help but think he would never do that for me... Occasions aside, I would really love to get flowers more than just once a year, like every 2 months would absolutely make me melt, and it could be some $12 flowers during our in person visits if delivery is too much. I would even be happy with a single rose. I've only gotten flowers on V day before. We do cook for each other a lot but I would happily take one less dinner date out here and there if it meant some flowers and gifts. 

One time, we discussed to buy me a cheap ""bedroom"" (NSFW) accessory and he offered probably 10 different times that he would buy it, and he never did. Although I can afford to get it, this kind of hurt me as it's something we both would enjoy and he still wouldn't get it. Also, for our anniversary I got him some gifts as well , we also went on a short trip together (he did pay for more of the date activities there but I contributed to the travel costs and I offered to pay for things as I usually wiuld) he said we could shop and get a gift for the anniversary together, and we never did. I wasn't expecting something because we did the trip, but looking back on how little actual physical gifts I've gotten, I'm a bit disappointed he didn't get anything. A box of chocolates, a book, a coffee mug, a handmade card saying what he likes about me, these would've all been wonderful gifts. And he does have money, but these are not expensive and I wasn't expecting something expensive. For his last birthday, I put so much thought and effort into his gift, I looked for weeks and stayed up late just to look. The gift he got for my birthday, in comparison, was a very practical thing for my living room, and I definitely appreciate it, but it wasn't really fun or special or particularly something he would've spent a long time thinking about. 

So now, I feel like occasions, I just won't get much if at all, and outside of that I can forget about anything at al... but being away from each other half the time, I'd be lying if I said gifts aren't important. However, it seems he likes gifting actual experiences, but gifts, he is not so good at.  How can I bring this up when he does pay for things but meaningful physical gifts are still something I value? I always told myself that because he does treat me, I shouldn't bring up gifts at all. But I like giving and receiving gifts too. ",0,1728372845.0,relationship_advice,2,0.5,False

I took like two pain killers and that was all, I drink Tilia tea with lemon for pain and inflammation.
I didn't do sitz baths. They told me the shower should be just fine and I shower with warm water and Dermobacter to keep the area clean. For the wound I use betadine, but it can burn the skin so be careful.
This is all at the moment. No sign of puss at the moment, just a normal red-white discharge which is specific for healing as far as I know.

1fytxlt,https://www.reddit.com/r/gout/comments/1fytxlt/my_gout_story/,My gout story,"Hello, im 31 yo, had issues for years and could not figure out what was wrong with me, for me it started around 5 years ago, I injured my ankle and since then I had problems walking almost every 2-3 weeks, was drinking a lot of beer etc. My pain in ankle was reapearing almost every 2-3 weeks, had to use crutches to walk sometimes, worst parts were every summer holiday I ended up in so much pain I couldnt walk, I have 2 little kids and it was very embarasing not being able to walk with them properly, I was blaming everything from my style of walking to the shoes I was wearing, changing everything without any success, still was in pain. Forward to this year february. I went for in depth search for the pain, all kind of doctors, everything was negative, eventually I was told to check my uric acid levels in blood, I was like man Im 31, this is something that people in their 50-60s deal with not poeple my age. Doctor told me not anymore, that they have patients from 20 on on regular now diagnosed with gout. So I went to my doctor for blood tests and behold, very high levels of uric acid. I was prescribed allopurinol 100 mg /day, when I was lying in the bed with pain I researched everything I could on gout. This is what worked for me:   
  
-0 alcohol, since march this year I had like 5-6 glasses of white vine on summer vacation (first time in years without any pain!)   
-start the day with 0,5 l of water mixed with apple vinegar and freshly squeezed lemon   
-lot of water, I mean lot, as much as you can get, first weeks I was in my usual routine of stress and coffee, drinking too little water and taking alopurinol, ended up in so much pain in my kidneys I couldn´t sleep, from that day I take care of water  
-supplements (I wont specify, im not doctor or nutrition specialist, I do what works for me)   
-researched what foods I can and can´t eat, and realized it is specific to each person, I for example have no problem with any kind of meat, seafood etc. What is really bad for me is chicken stock, I dont eat it anymore since it was the worst food I found out there is for my gout  
- first month I went into full uric acid crystall reduction, was painfull, but worth it.   


Long story short, from march I got one attack after getting on allopurinol, from that attack im completely fine, not a single attack, I can walk, I can do all the stuff I couldnt with my kids, I can take them to jungle park and jump with them, something that was unthinkable since I would end up limping next day allways. My life turned so much better, my familly is happier, my health is much better, no pain. This is my story so far.

I'm wondering what hours people choose to fast. I've been trying but I'm struggling. I'm a night owl so I tend to eat something at night (as you can see I'm still up & it's 3am). Some mornings I wake up at 630 & drink a sprite as a means to function to get my daughter to school. Sprite obviously breaks a fast. I could try to fast overnight ...say stopping at 6pm, but then I want a sprite when I wake up (I've switched to sprite zero, no sugar). I'm not sure what to do. I obviously need to be able to eat something during the day so I'm struggling to figure out what hours would be good to fast & how to go about it since I drink a sprite when I wake up (I quit coffee bc it stains your teeth). The days I don't wake up at 630, I'd be able to hold off later on the sprite since id obviously be sleeping ... but I'm just really struggling with how to approach this. I've gained 10lbs recently & can't lose it. I know fasting would help. I know fasting also has many other benefits. Any suggestions are appreciated!",1,1728371276.0,InsulinResistance,0,1.0,False

1fytupz,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_BRIGHT_NEXT_ACADEMY/comments/1fytupz/ai_and_language_learning_can_ai_help_us_become/,AI and Language Learning: Can AI Help Us Become Polyglots?,"Becoming a polyglot—someone who speaks multiple languages fluently—has traditionally been a challenging but rewarding endeavor. It often involves years of study, practice, immersion in different cultures, and a lot of patience. Polyglots are admired for their ability to navigate different linguistic systems and bridge cultural gaps, whether for work, travel, or personal growth. But what if AI could speed up the process? Could artificial intelligence help us all become polyglots faster and more effectively than ever before?

Today, AI is already powering language-learning apps like Duolingo and Babbel to create personalized lesson plans, track progress, and adapt to individual learning styles. But AI’s potential in this space could go much further. Imagine a future where AI immerses you in real-time conversations with native speakers, simulates language environments for you to practice in, or even provides instant corrections as you speak.

# The Future of AI in Language Learning

Language learning, especially when aiming to become a polyglot, typically requires a mix of memorization, repetition, cultural exposure, and speaking practice. This is where AI could truly shine. Imagine virtual reality (VR) platforms where you could walk through a market in Tokyo, negotiate prices in Japanese, or order coffee in Italian at a virtual café. AI could simulate realistic language environments, providing the next best thing to traveling abroad and offering opportunities to practice without the logistical challenges of immersion.

With advancements in natural language processing (NLP), AI systems are becoming more adept at understanding and generating human language. AI could simulate conversations with native speakers in multiple languages, allowing you to practice different accents, dialects, and linguistic structures. These simulations would provide real-time feedback on your pronunciation and fluency, helping you to correct mistakes immediately, which is essential for mastering any language.

# The Role of AI in Accelerating Language Learning

Traditional methods for becoming a polyglot involve books, classroom instruction, language immersion, and constant practice with native speakers. While effective, these methods require significant time and effort. AI, however, could compress that timeline. Personalized learning paths driven by AI can target your weak spots, ensuring you focus on the areas you need most. For example, if you're struggling with Spanish verb conjugation, AI can provide targeted drills and real-time corrections.

Additionally, AI can make learning more flexible. Instead of scheduled classes, AI-driven language tools offer 24/7 access. Whether you're commuting or relaxing at home, you can engage in language practice at your convenience. Moreover, AI doesn’t get tired or frustrated, making it an ideal language partner for practicing pronunciation or difficult sentence structures repeatedly.

# Polyglots and AI: Can It Replace Human Teachers?

Polyglots typically emphasize the importance of cultural immersion, context, and social interaction when learning a language—areas where human teachers excel. Teachers offer personalized insights, encouragement, and a deep understanding of the cultural nuances that come with language mastery. While AI can simulate aspects of this, such as conversation practice or grammar correction, it lacks the intuitive understanding of cultural subtleties that human teachers provide.

For now, AI can best serve as a complementary tool, enhancing your language-learning experience by providing additional practice outside of traditional lessons. It can accelerate the early stages of language acquisition, helping learners build a foundation before moving to more advanced, culturally nuanced interactions with human teachers or native speakers. However, it’s plausible that AI could take on a larger role as technology evolves, especially for polyglots who are adding additional languages after mastering a few.

# 



Do you think AI can help someone become fluent in multiple languages faster than traditional methods? Would you trust AI to teach you a language, or do you think human teachers are still essential? Could AI truly help us become polyglots, or will the human element always be necessary for language mastery? Let's discuss!

I just want to make a post to show that some guys do like smaller boobs! And, if you want, I'm happy to chat, too!

About me: 
- 28 years old
- 6 ft tall
- halfie 🇺🇸 🇵🇭 
- average-to-fit body type (SFW/wholesome pics on my profile!)
- big fan of good coffee shops, fantasy books, live music, and silly questions like this

Ok, a lot of women I know are self-conscious about their size. So I wanted to make a post like this because, in my opinion, small boobs are underrated!

It's funny to see so many posts assuring men that size doesn't matter, but so few posts offering that same kind of affirmation to women. Really, there are a lot of guys - including myself - who even prefer small boobs! 

Don't get me wrong, of course. Big ones are nice, too. But I honestly just like smaller ones more, and I'm sure I'm not alone. 

So, if you're a lady with itty-bitties, know that small chests are beautiful! And, if you want, feel free to message on here!

I keep a list of things people have mentioned when they say they like something so that when bdays/christmas/etc come around, I just consult my list and select from there. It reduces my anxiety around the whole gift-giving occasion by being sure I'm getting them something they'll like/enjoy.

My GF of about 11 months is big into coffee and had mentioned how she wanted a nice coffee maker, she mentioned the exact brand and model. It costs around $1k USD. So I wrote it down and months later when it came time for her bday in September I got it for her after much searching. She was extremely happy to get it. She is currently in the middle of moving so it has remained in its box since September.

Yesterday while researching how to use the machine I bought her, she found out that the company makes a fancier model priced at around $1900 USD. She asked how I would feel if she traded her unused model that I bought her for the new one, with her paying the difference.

On one hand I feel that once a gift is given, it's up to the recipient what they want to do with it. On the other hand, I put thought, money and time into getting her something that she wanted and was effectively a happy surprise so I'm a bit hurt that she's this callous about it.

1fyttj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NepalSocial/comments/1fyttj3/my_sister_is_suffering_from_domestic_voilence/,My sister is suffering from domestic voilence.,"My sister 30f, been married from last 4 years is being beaten my her husband. 
The thing is, it was an arrange marriage, idk how foolish  of her to agree to get married just because she didn’t wanted to disappoint dad and mom. Elder sister did love marriage and initially they were not thatt satisfied with her decision, pachi they were happy with it but initially they were not, so thats how i think my younger sister didn’t wanted to disappoint my parents and agreed for arrange marriage. 


Her in laws are a very good family, no doubts on that, they even love me so much, they are wealthy and respected family. And the exception is sasu, she is typical kokila behen, but since my sister is in abroad, she doesn’t have to bear her so its kinda okay. 


My bhinaju( i dont even wanna call him bhinaju at this moment) is 34 years old, very well financially with few business here in nepal, a very well knowned restaurant chain, and few hospitality business there at abroad too.
Everyone thinks he is such a good guy, even we thought my sister is so lucky to be with such a guy, humble respectful and stuff. He god wild good connections with people, he has reached heights in every other thing business and stuff in community yk. 
He used to spoil me since i am the only salo bhai. I used to think him as a very good personality and i used to respect him with all my heart and his outer personality is what i still look for. 


It was all good until my sister called me crying.she called me cause she felt safe sharing all these to me, not even parents but meand i don’t understand what am I supposed to do, i am afraid, i am full of anger and i can’t stop crying too. 


Bhinaju seems to have a very narcissistic behaviour, the success made him that way because the family he was brought up would never made him this way. He seems to be full of himself, how well he earns and stuff like that.  


Now i know when my sister shared all the incidents, how he failed as a husband and a father. Abuse was going on from long time tara my sister just ignored them . Buda budi ma ali ali jhagda ta parcha ni vanera. 
Tharkaune yeta uti bhairakhthyo rey, pachi fakaune ni ho rey, tara yo pali chai lagatar physically abuse garna suru bhayo rey. 

One of the incident was my sister asked him “why dont you go to gym or even a walk, you cant be this lazy, you even dont have a busy schedule, you dont have to work your ass off, there are people looking at your business, so its never that you cant manage few hour for fitness” 
That was it, my sister just wanted her husband to be fit and get a healthy lifestyle haina. 
That was enough for him to beat the shit out of my sister. I dont think she had any bad intention in that statement. Kehi vannai nahune rey. 

Ani aarko stupid reason my sister used to get yelled was . Bihana 7,8 bajey tira my sister asked him, coffee banaidim? K khaisincha, he denied, kei nakhane, then obviously didi lai bhok ta lagya cha, she made breakfast for herself and started eating, he was like, talai laj sharam chaina hai eklai khana, khana napaki and all. 
Tyo chai funny lagyo muji k pagal hola yar. 


Hijo chai mukh nai sunneko thiyo, rudai rudai call garsya thyo malai. Ani there’s alot of these type of incident. Aaba buda budi ko jhagda paral ko aago vanchan, tara physically nai kutna laye pachi i dont think it is going right. 


My sister especially my younger sister is so dearest to me, more like a bestfriend. We have huge age gap tara we share everything literally everything. 


I remember 1 year ago, when same thing happened, teti bela kutya chai hoina tara mukh chadera gali garya rey, ani i could not stand ani maile bhinaju lai text garya thiye aafai, didi le yesto yesto bhayo bhinaju, whats wrong, dont dare to make her cry like that vanera. 
Malai call garera “testo kehi hoina babu exaggerate garya ho” vanera fakaisyo, ani ma ni i was okay. 


Mukh chadne and all, tiktok banauda “tiktokey randi bhais ta” vanne rey, talking shits about us, tero bau le yesto garyo, usto garyo. And all of those shits. 


Mero didi ko kehi galti huna sakcha, tara mukh chadne, kutne is the solution?? Definitely not . 

He is mostly outside comes home rati 2,3 bajey, so morever my sister is lacking emotional support too, chora almost 3 barsa ko bhayo, she has to do everything. 

My dad respects him so much as jwai, samdhi samdhi ko ni bestie wala relation cha, they respect us alot. Even i get so high treatment tya jada . Tara chora ko asli rup ta no one else than my sister knows. 


I love my sister so much and i cant stand my sister crying like this and i am ready to do whatever for my sister. Muji nepal ma bhako bhaye esto kutthiye jasto ni huncha, tara k garnu. 

What am I supposed to do?? Yesto kura ajhai baddai gayo vaney ta its dangerous yar.

Afterwards we talked over the full labor day weekend and it was all day, Tuesday comes around and I see her talking to a friend of hers and she told me she will meet me in the coffee shop. I waited for around 40 minutes and she did not come by so I left, later on she posts on her insta of her and a group of people (the friend she was talking to was not there) that I would consider mostly bums and people I will not consider good and it rubbed me the wrong day. The next day I see her in the student lounge and apologizes because she missed track of time talking to her friend and I let it slide because I didn’t know her well enough to assert her personality. Fast forward I have known this girl for about a week and the same group of people invited us to go to the mall and very hypocritical of me I said yes to go but it was to see how she behaves and I was unpleasantly surprised that she was comically far from me and she was very dry and dismissive every time I tried talking to her, and I thought I got the sign definitely because in that weekend we talked every day we shared Spotify playlists (me being born in a hispanic country of course I have a lot of latino music in my playlist) that context was to say that she was talking about how she wanted to be put on with hispanic music and I told her to take a look into my playlist to learn some good shit and she said that her friend will help her out…. That definitely upset me because why did she tell me that and then dismiss my answer totally, basically I ended it with an “alright” and didn’t text again. Now come to find out she added me to her close friends on instagram and I am just confused bc we haven’t talked far more that we have talked and now she has me in her close friends and giggles every time I talk to her so reddit am I cooked????",0,1728370557.0,offmychest,1,0.33,False
1fytqul,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1fytqul/help_a_sudden_playfulinquisitive_aggression/,help! a sudden playful/inquisitive aggression," yesterday, i came home after being gone for a full day & pet Susie, my roommate’s cat, a TON. she got super excited, starting sniffing my armpits (i think she smelled my deodorant), then bit my armpit very softly. i stopped petting her & did a body weight workout. she tried to pounce at my shins as i was doing lunges (i think the repetitive motion peaked her interest).

i had to hold a blanket between her and i to prevent her from biting me. i’m pretty certain she would have bit me if i didn’t have something to keep the distance.

today, i pet her some, noticed her going for my armpits, then stopped petting so she wouldn’t get too excited. she lied down, continued purring, and relaxed alone. a few hours later, she tries sneaking up on (and attacking?) me when i walk into the living room. she hides under a blanket covering the coffee table and jumps out at me. she ends up sniffing the protective object, then meows & pretends to give up the chase, i walk way, and it repeats.

there are a few things that might be affecting her behavior:
a week ago, she got switched from being free fed (consistently full bowl of food) to an automatic feeder giving her portioned meals at scheduled times. she used to get pretty antsy & meow, asking for more food, but no longer does this. i’m assuming she is used to her new diet now.

my roommate also got a catnip-enfused seat which she’s been OBSESSED with. not sure if catnip can affect behavior but this wasn’t an issue before the catnip seat.

my roommate, her owner, has been gone for the last 4 days. she could be missing him?

help! she is usually super skittish & sprints away when she is gets excited/playful. this behavior is new and scary, frankly. if you know what might be making her act this way or ways to stop her from hunting me, it’d be much appreciated!",1,1728370528.0,CatAdvice,0,1.0,False

1fytp4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1fytp4c/i_tried_andrew_hubermans_famous_daily_routine_and/,I Tried Andrew Hubermans Famous Daily Routine and THIS HAPPENED!,"Hey everyone, I went through a bit of a personal rut where I was stuck in this loop of feeling unmotivated, burned out, and really frustrated. I fell into this cycle of poor sleep, constant brain fog, low energy, and zero focus. It all got to the point where I could barely get through the day, let alone be productive in my work or life.

But then something clicked—I decided to make a change. I needed to break out of this cycle, so I dove into a set of science-backed protocols, inspired by the work of Andrew Huberman. I gave myself 7 days to fully commit to this new routine and see if it could pull me out of my slump.

In this post, I’m sharing the protocols I followed, my experience with each, and the impact they had on my mental clarity, productivity, and overall well-being. You can also check out my full video on how it all went down here: [https://youtu.be/kcdFAOIja1k](https://youtu.be/kcdFAOIja1k)

Have you had any experience with any of these? And how did it go for you?

**Here’s what I practiced:**

**1. Waking Up and Recording the Time**

The very first step was a simple one—writing down the exact time I woke up each day. This small act of recording set the tone for the day, triggering a sense of productivity the moment I opened my eyes. No more grabbing my phone and mindlessly scrolling through social media.

**2. Morning Walk (Forward Ambulation)**

I started each day with a morning walk (what Huberman calls *forward ambulation*). The goal wasn’t about burning calories but generating optic flow, which reduces anxiety and helps you feel more focused. Just looking side-to-side as I walked helped ease my mind and set me up for a productive day.

**3. Getting Morning Sunlight**

One of the biggest game changers—getting 10-30 minutes of sunlight in my eyes during my morning walk. This helped regulate my circadian rhythm, boosting my mood and energy levels, and giving me the wake-up signal my brain needed. I honestly felt more alive after doing this for just a few days.

**4. Cold Exposure (Ice Baths)**

If there’s one protocol I’d recommend to everyone, it’s cold exposure. I started incorporating cold plunges, and while the first minute was brutal, pushing through that discomfort gave me a massive dopamine release that lasted for hours. It’s hands down the best thing I did to boost my focus and mental clarity.

**5. Hydration with a Twist**

I made sure to hydrate with water mixed with a pinch of sea salt in the morning. This simple addition helped replenish the minerals needed for optimal brain function (magnesium, potassium, sodium), and I felt sharper and more alert as a result.

**6. Caffeine Delay**

Instead of grabbing coffee immediately after waking up, I waited for 1-2 hours to let the natural adenosine (sleep pressure) clear. This prevented the dreaded afternoon crash and gave me sustained energy throughout the day.

**7. Deep Work in 90-Minute Cycles**

I followed Huberman’s advice to work in 90-minute deep work sessions, which align with our natural ultradian rhythms (periods of heightened and lowered alertness). By blocking all distractions and focusing on a single task, I was able to enter a flow state and get an impressive amount of work done.

**8. Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR/Yoga Nidra)**

In place of naps, I used Yoga Nidra or NSDR to recover during the day. This deep relaxation technique helps recharge the brain without needing to fully sleep. After 20 minutes, I felt like I had just woken up from a solid night’s rest.

**9. End of Day Sunlight**

Huberman also recommends viewing sunlight in the late afternoon or near sunset. This helps signal to the body that the day is winding down and prepares the brain for better sleep later on. I headed up to a local mountain to watch the sunset, and it worked wonders for my sleep quality.

**10. Optimizing Sleep**

Finally, improving my sleep was a major focus of this challenge. I incorporated a few key habits like lowering room temperature before bed, taking hot showers to cool the body, and practicing nose breathing for deeper, more restorative sleep.

After practicing these protocols for a week, I noticed dramatic changes in my energy levels, mental clarity, and focus. My productivity skyrocketed, my sleep improved, and my general well-being increased.",9,1728370294.0,Biohackers,3,0.77,False

I workout a lot and sometimes take caffeine supplements before the gym. Sometimes, when my overall caffeine intake crosses certain amount, I experience strong heart palpitations and have trouble sleeping but I am fine the next day

On Sunday I drank 5 coffees and then had a preworkout at like 6pm. I barely got any sleep and experienced strong palpitations  which was not at all surprising.

However, this time palpitations went through Monday, I had another 4-5 coffees with no preworkout this time. my sleep was a little better but still sucked

Now it is Tuesday 9am here and I still feel the palpitations.

Ok question for the group: how do i (is it possible to) unfuck this situation?

(Sorry for the long read)

Me, briefly: I'm 38. I had a child at 16 because I was taken advantage of. Tough? Check. Scary? Check, check. Did we all do it and make it work out? Triple fucking check. The kid is amazing, high achieving, and really off to the races in life.

When kid is young, I fell for a guy. We were both 23. We had an amazing 12 year relationship raising this kid and being a family. We had so much life during that time. Him business school. Me law school. Our kid... school. We both entered our careers. We succeeded. But life happensled and sadly my husband passed away about 2 years ago. Crushing. We are all still broken with loss. About six months ago, I asked our kid if I could start dating, what did they think, etc. 

The kid was ok with it but just asked that I don't date around their age. I was kinda surprised it was said - there was no reason to. Plus, I wasn't ready to date anyway. So I didn't. I didn't go on a single date. 

What Happened: About six months ago I learned about a Sertain hookup site from a coworker in passing. Had no interest until a week ago when I profiled and posted. Received an overwhelming response as a fit, hairy daddy. I mean there was a lot of interest. Frankly it was stupid. But maybe that is everyone on that site. Could be. 

Amazing Guy: I started talking to this mid20s guy ('Amazing Guy'). I'm aware of the age gap. So is he. There's chemistry but I refuse to connect because this is the type of thing where I could see myself starting something. So instead (this is where I get stupid) I have several casual encounters throughout the weekend. All in there 20s. Casual encounters. Not dating. Kinda reckless acting out type stuff that felt good in the moment but doesn't feel great now. Still, I can't get the Amazing Guy from interrupting my thoughts. Dude has brains, humor, personality, and... looks, too. Just ... this fucker is a tall, cold goddamn glass of water on a very fucking hot day. 

What Happened: So, I sit down with my kid. Ask them about 'remember that one time we talked about me dating around your age-ish...' and the response was 'Dad. Yes. I remember. I would rather you not.' Ok. It hurt because I wasn't getting what I want. But I understand it and will accept it. They've been through so much and they're my everything. 

I tell Amazing Guy I can't. The conversation becomes personal. I explain everything above. Everything. Amazing Guy is whip smart and I figure he can handle the entire drama behind why I can't meet him for a fucking cup of coffee, which is, because I would probably end up trying to marry Amazing Guy. There like 3 or 4 years between my kid and Amazing Guy. 

Anyway... Because it's a hookup site I kept it super anon. No face. Especially because of my kid - who just graduated college in the city they, me, and Amazing Guy all live in.

Amazing Guy is really insisting for a pic. I can't and won't. I previously sent some pretty forward photos and just didn't feel comfortable putting it all out there like that. So I refuse. And refuse. And refuse. The exchange ends over text on a lowpoint. I feel horrible on several levels. No contact since then - which was last night. 

I go back to my kid to provide context and have a 'real' discussion about this. I provide some details of Amazing Guy and my kid literally pulls up socials and is like I know this person who knows Amazing Guy. Happens a few times, the close connections thing. They went to the same undergrad, same college, a few years apart but there was I think a year or two of overlap. Kid looks at me. Dad please no. Basically, that's game for me, kid wins. And my kid will always win there, tbh. 

I mentioned my prior conversation with Amazing Guy was personal and complicated for me and for Amazing Guy. I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings but I do think it is best to let the moment (and hormones!) pass. I never thought I'd be in this spot because of someone I met on a cruising site. 

So, here's the question:

1. I should just let this situation rest where it is and move on, right? 

2. No need to trigger anyone by reaching back out, yes?

Sorry for the long one - all advice is appreciated! No 2 cents is unwelcome here!

Further, I was dealing with health issues of my own and was in and out of urgent care and clinic for months. In March, it was becoming too much for me and I did not want her to suffer so I decided that I needed a break (some time away from each other) to deal with my issues and also finals at the university.

2. **Glycemic Index**: Choose substitutes with a low glycemic index to help maintain stable blood sugar levels.

3. **Taste**: Different sweeteners can have varying flavors. It’s wise to try small amounts of a few options to find one that suits your palate.

4. **Cooking Compatibility**: If you enjoy baking or cooking, ensure the substitute you choose can withstand heat without losing its sweetness.

5. **Dietary Restrictions**: Consider any additional dietary needs such as vegan or gluten-free requirements when selecting a product.

By keeping these considerations in mind, you can confidently select a diabetic sugar substitute that not only satisfies your cravings but aligns with your health goals.

1fytezu,https://www.reddit.com/r/TemuGuideDK/comments/1fytezu/discount_card_000_by_david_k/,🎲 Discount Card 000 🎩 -by David K?,"Code: Discount Card 999	
Promotion: 50-100% off + 7 items ""50% off"". 

There isn't really much to this one. You get 50-100% off of the first item. Then it gives you a spinning wheel saying you can get 50% off an item. Which then becomes another spinning wheel which gives 50% off seven items.

This can actually be a good promotion. 

Pros
1. You can get an item around $10-20 100% off. 
2. Sometimes, only at the start, it will select things in your cart (you may want to prepare for this) and actually take some cost off. $1-2 or potentially more.
3. You can find cheap enough items to spend enough for the full cost getting other items with it. Which, to me, is half off. 

Cons
1. It doesn't select everything in the cart and is somewhat random.
2. A lot of the time, the cart items are also the same price outside of the promotion. 
3. The promotion's ""50%"" off includes things that are already supposedly 50% off. So if that deck of cards you always wanted is marked down from $50 to $3.49, it will still be $3.49.

I have actually gotten some decent deals and do enjoy looking for this promotion hoping it makes items cheaper.

Before I forget, I'm Jess (He/They) and I'll be your Game master in this lovely campaign. The game will start in a small town in Washington, 2005. As a bunch of young folks who know each other, you all were slightly weird. Some of you maybe heard a little too well or run too fast. Be it the study of the arcane, the awakening of the weird you, you more or less in the same day realized that all this feelings you've dealt with through your whole life were not actually normal. And to add the cherry on top, some weirdo in a robe told you all that you were old enough to be ""registered"". It is the start of a new life! Now, knowing of your magical background, you realize that if you stay here, you won't a chance to see what you can do with your abilities, so it's time to hit the road!

Old gods in coffee shops, the undead rest in theatres and a monster lays right below you catching the flick as its stealing whatever popcorn falls from your bucket, you are now aware of the fantastical world that was hiding its face on the old regular one and you have now to deal with new consequences and encounters, as magic reals in magic, weirdos attract weirdos... and danger attracts more danger. There's always the possibility of calling it quits, surrendering to what seems to be a magic society, but will you let them tell you when it is too much? Will you submit to the ones who watch for the order of this hidden world or will you do even earlier before you get the chance? There's a lot to see and do and maybe people that only you can save. So prepare ammo, some food and maybe buy that CD that you really wanted because if life's going to be hard from now on, at least jam while you're at it!

And that's more or less it without spoiling much more. The game will take place on Sundays at 5 pm GMT+2 and unfortunately as I don't want to make the group wait, the post will only be up for just a little while, so take your time as you write the answers in the [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13n-xS6glGIbFjeyU1Rx_HWGaZ-r4Zgo5QFHhwJDBZq8/edit) and don't worry. As a tip, just give me information, be yourself and let me know what's up. If I further need it, I'll contact you in Discord to maybe ask a few questions or if things are just that good, you'll be contacted there to join the server we'll play on.

This time - Its the [Shardor Electric Grinder](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B0BQR5CHHY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

[Image from the manufacturer. Not mine.](https://preview.redd.it/mdy0yhma6htd1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e7d353795d9f510f40dca3e4d1be474cf8701e2e)

A cheap little amazon grinder, that does what it says on the box, and then some.

I first came across this device on my search for a sub 5k electric grinder, looked at the options available in the market and decided to try this one out because, of the ones that were available at this price point, this was the one that had a small amount of discourse on the internet.

It had 4.1 stars and about 300 odd ratings, so things were looking no bad. So I decided to give it a shot (no pun intended), and ordered it from Amazon.

It was delivered pretty quickly, with no issue. The everything was as expected. No issues there.

Whats in the box ?

1. The grinder itself, with a hopper.

2. A lid that does a decent job of sealing the beans, its not exactly air tight, but it works.

3. A scoop - of about 4gms of coffee (odd that there's a scoop included in this kind of a grinder)

4. regular documents, and an optional extra year warranty registration paper - giving it 2 years warranty overall.

So, does it actually work ?

I wanted this thing mostly for Aeropress, but was curious if it could grind fine enough for espresso. So that's exactly what I did. Decided to try it with a medium roast third wave coffee. Loaded up about 15gm into it, set the timer for about 40 seconds, grind settings at almost the finest (3 clicks away from the finest), And let it grind.

Here's where I ran into the first issue. Because of the way hopper machines are designed, they are intended to be used with a reasonably full hopper. However, I prefer a single dose grinder, allows for more versatility. So, about 2gms of beans were just left ungrinded in the hopper. Stuck somewhere. A little bit of shaking and scooping sent everything into the grinder burrs, and still there was retention of about 0.5 gms in the machine. So I did get my 14.5 gms of 'fine' ground coffee out of it.

However, this definitely wasn't espresso level. So I measured the ground, and it was about 600 micro grams. I usually, prefer something along 200 micro grams for espresso, this was mostly good for an Aeropress.

The grind was decently consistent, a bit less consistent than my trusty manual, but the comfort of just hitting a single button and having fresh ground coffee in less than a minute was pretty nice. 

So I decided to just brew Aero with this, and it turned out fine. It was good coffee, and a decent brew technique, so it produced a good cup of coffee. 

Now I wanted to test out the finest it can do. So dialed it in, to the max, and repeated the process. I'm not sure what I was expecting. So 30 seconds later, I was looking at the grind, it wasn't as fine as I expected, but it felt decent enough, decided to pull a shot of espresso.

However, on thing I did notice was some of the inconsistencies in the grind when tamping, you could see the difference, it was minute, but you could see. A little more fines than with a good manual grinder like the C2.

How was the shot ? The shot too, was surprisingly decent. Especially, coming from a sub 5k electric grinder. 

So I decided to measure the grind - and it just barely made it into the 'fine' category. Most of the grind was around 400 micro grams, with some fines dipping down to 300. While I'm sure, one can get a better extraction, with a finer grinder, this was a very acceptable shot. Again, good coffee, good technique, so it wasn't completely surprising, but pleasant none the less.

So, it 'can' do espresso.

That said, a couple of things to note.

1. The grinder was surprisingly quiet, compared to the Baratza encore, this was much more quiet. 

2. The collecting chamber is fed from the side, and tends to have grind stuck to the cap and the side walls, the designers of the machine did address this issue, by giving you a small tab to tap the ground off the side walls, and dump them down to the bottom. 

3. I suspect there are ways to tweak the grind even further than the 25 steps, by manually adjusting or calibrating the burrs directly (Will probably look into it later on).

4. The burrs themselves are easily accessible, just removing the lid inside the hopper, reveals the burrs, a twist, and the burrs come out completely. They came a bit oiled from the factory, I did clean them out, just to be on the safer side. 

5. While the standard warranty is 1 year, there's an option to register the unit and get an additional year (Not sure how reliable the service is, or will be).

6. The machine is decently built, no exactly great, but not bad either, but the cost cutting does show, in the quality of the plastics. 

7. The burrs are metal, and seem to be well made, no issues there from early inspections. 

-------------------

So who is this for ?

If you, someone like me want a daily driver machine for preferably aeropress / mokapot / french press / pourover. This machine handles all of that pretty well. And removes the hassle of manually grinding.

It can handle the occasional espresso, but do not get it, if your workflow is predominantly espresso. Because while, it can pull a decent shot, I would rather manually grind, for when I want an espresso.

Competition ?

Instacuppa as a similar grinder, which I would presume is basically another chinese rebrand, except that is a single dose grinder, with a porta filter attachment. However, that doesn't make any sense to me because none of these machines are truly espresso grade. The cheapest electric option, for that is the Barattza Encore ESP. And there's no two ways about that. 

About the company :

Preliminary research show Shardor is a chinese appliance brand, that has its presence in a large number of companies. Think of it like Agaro, but they actually design and make their own stuff, unlike our homegrown brands. Personally I think, they offer better value, simply because its directly from the source, but obviously, things like after sales service can be sketchy, making it worth getting from an Indian label brand.

Instead of Stations, you have the different departments that make up Smosh, and the utilities have been swapped out for production costs. Jail is the crying bathroom, and free parking is a merch drop!

It’s my love letter to Smosh and all they create! So I figured I would share it in case anyone wanted to print it off and play (as you could Frankenstein it together with an existing game and make up more of your own error/challenge pit cards).

I’m on a nasal steroid (called Ryaltris) for a dust allergy, I’ve been on nexplanon (hormonal birth/bleed control) since July ‘23, and occasionally use a topical steroid for some weird psoriasis thing. I also do allergy shots for my dust allergy, and I’m allergic to cold (cold induced urticaria. Tons of fun. Yay.) 

Is it anything to be worried about? I’m pretty active day to day and I don’t drink coffee/energy drinks/alcohol or smoke/vape.
