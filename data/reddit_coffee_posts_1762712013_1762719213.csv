Hello everyone,

Not going to lie, I am absolutely terrible at things like this. 

Bit about me:

28 years old since July.
I Served 7 and a half years in the British Armed Forces. Unfortunately left due to injury received in the forces.

So what does that mean for who ever wants to date me you ask? Well, I need a walking stick most days, as my injury is spinal/hip based. Also got the Neurospicy as I like to call it.

I am currently studying a new way in life so I can work from home. I love to cook even though my hands like to give out on me when cooking, so scars on hands if that puts people off. 

I like to walk my dogs every morning, So I am getting outside at least as otherwise I stay home all day, study, game and cook.

Games: I play mostly RPG games, barely any multiplayer games but will get them to play with you if you'd want.

I am 165cm tall or 5'5 for others. Average body, not lean anymore and put a few kilos on since. But not overweight, trying to lose it by constant walking and eating less high calorie dishes since I no longer need to keep calories piled on for hard work. (78kg or 172lbs or 12 St 4 Lbs)

Anyway, Chef trained, Engineer trained and now studying IT through a Veteran associated company.

I do have the fear of fireworks now due to service related PTSD. Also can blank out randomly. You dont have to worry about me going out much, only go out to get shopping, appointments, walking dogs and coffee shop now and again as a treat.

I have been single for over 10 years now. No ONS or anything the such. No offence to those that do. I am wanting to settle down permanently now and eventually have a family.

I am fine with LDR

I have been writing a body swap fic with an enemies to lovers vibe, and I work crazy hard on it. I mean, I read it aloud to myself, I outline, and draft, and obsessively edit, and I mean I make sure I make each scene feel like it is worthy of reading.

My partner and I are planning a trip to Mauritius from **late September to early October** (about **14 nights**), and we’d love some advice from those who’ve been.

We’re wondering:

* Is **14 nights** a good amount of time to explore and relax?
* Should we stay in **one location** the whole time, or split the stay between **two regions**?
* Which **area or town** would you recommend for a good balance of peace and access to food/coffee?

We’re leaning towards booking an **Airbnb for the full stay**, possibly with a **private pool**. We don’t need to be in the middle of a town, but we’d love to be somewhere **quiet**, where we’re **not right next to a busy road** or overlooked by neighbors.  
At the same time, it would be nice to be able to **walk to a café or grab a light breakfast** without needing to drive every time.

We’ll definitely have a **rental car**, so we’re flexible with getting around the island.

Any tips on:

* Best regions for this kind of setup?
* Whether it’s worth switching locations halfway?
* Hidden gems or areas to avoid?

She is a really nice girl, but I had a strong feeling she is not really available as much as I am. We have some really lovely dates, but I never really hear from her when we are not together. She says things like ""I am 100% in this relationship"" and then takes sometimes 3-4 days to get back to a simple message.

Anyway, she suggested coming to her house and maybe meeting her parents, which I thought was the right step towards hopefully getting more of an idea of where we are going. Before that though, she said she wanted to see me more over half term (as we are both teachers) which I thought was brilliant, but she seemed to be too busy for it apart from a date to the zoo followed by an aerial class (as that's her hobby)

I hinted I could give it a go, but due to an arm injury I will find it tricky, but she reassured me I would be fine.

Day came of the zoo and aerial class and we had a nice time at the zoo. She was flirting with me and I was flirting back. I was trying to impress her with my knowledge of the zoo's history and just trying to enjoy our time together. After the zoo trip we had 4 hours to wait before the Aerial class.

She started saying how I would ""need to hang upside down on a bar and support my full body weight"" which I honestly told her I would not be able to. I said I will still come and give it a go, but may have to sit out if I risked arm injury. She seemed understanding of that and we went to get a coffee.

On the way to the coffee she said ""So are you my boyfriend now?"" and I said ""I would like to see you more and meet your parents first, Just as I feel like I do not see you enough"" Which she said ""Thats 100% okay, Thats why I wanted to ask first"" and we then enjoyed the rest of our day. I know I messed up a bit, but I really did not want to rush into something after 5 dates.

We got to the class and Sarah's friend Jess was running it. Jess seemed to do the normal things a teacher would do for a class and ask for our names and any disabilities or any injuries. I saw that the aerial pole was way over 7ft in the air and had to say sorry and say that I could not due to injuries. I sat out and cheered Sarah and helped her get up when she needed to. Jess did not talk to me pretty much all evening and ignored me. As soon as the class was over Jess walked out with Sarah after I said goodbye and I am pretty sure they talked about me.

Once I got home I asked if she was home safe and asked about Jess and she did not answer me. Since then 9 days later, I have had 0 messages.

Titanium dioxide is not merely a pigment—it is a ritual. It whitens candy shells, pharmaceutical tablets, toothpaste, and processed foods with industrial precision. It promises purity, uniformity, and safety. But beneath this aesthetic veil lies a molecular infiltrator: titanium dioxide in nanoparticle form, a substance capable of breaching cellular membranes, disrupting gut signaling, and accumulating in organs with no exit strategy.

This is not a story of rogue chemistry. It is a story of regulatory omission, epistemic concealment, and ritualized ingestion. The compound is labeled simply as “titanium dioxide” or “E171”—a designation that erases its particle size, its biological behavior, and its toxicological ambiguity. Consumers are not informed whether they are ingesting an inert pigment or a biologically active nanoparticle. In the United States, they are offered no legal recourse to find out.

This editorial traces the proliferation of titanium dioxide nanoparticles into the human organism through food and pharmaceutical products. It maps their development, regulatory trajectory, biological impact, and symbolic function. It is a typological audit of a whitening ritual that has become a molecular trespass.

**Origins and Development of TiO₂ Nanoparticles**

Titanium dioxide was first commercialized in the early 20th century as a pigment for paints and plastics. Its opacity and brightness made it ideal for industrial whitening. By the 1960s, it had entered the food and pharmaceutical sectors, approved by the FDA for use up to 1% by weight—without any requirement to disclose particle size.

The nanotechnology boom of the 1990s and 2000s transformed TiO₂ from passive pigment to active agent. Researchers discovered that when ground to nanoscale (<100 nm), TiO₂ became transparent, photocatalytic, and biologically interactive. These properties made it attractive for sunscreens, drug delivery systems, and ultra-white coatings.

By 2009, nano-TiO₂ comprised an estimated 2.5% of global TiO₂ production. By 2015, that figure had risen to 10%. Yet no regulatory body required manufacturers to distinguish nano from bulk forms—a silence that persists in U.S. labeling laws to this day.

**Infiltration into Food Products**

Titanium dioxide is used in food as E171, a whitening agent found in:
- Candies (e.g., Skittles, Starburst)
- Chewing gum (e.g., Trident, Orbit)
- Frostings and sauces
- Coffee creamers
- Baked goods

Independent studies using electron microscopy have confirmed that many of these products contain nanoparticles, even when not intentionally engineered as such. The grinding process used to achieve visual brightness often produces particles in the nano range.

In 2020, France banned E171 due to concerns over genotoxicity. In 2022, the European Union followed, citing the inability to rule out DNA damage from nanoparticle exposure. The U.S. FDA, however, continues to allow E171 in food, with no requirement to disclose particle size or conduct long-term toxicological studies.

**Penetration into Pharmaceuticals**

TiO₂ is used extensively in pharmaceuticals as an excipient—a non-active ingredient that stabilizes, whitens, or coats tablets and capsules. It appears in:
- Over-the-counter medications (e.g., ibuprofen, acetaminophen)
- Prescription drugs
- Topical creams and ointments
- Injectable formulations (in rare cases)

While most pharmaceutical TiO₂ is assumed to be bulk, nano-TiO₂ is increasingly used in drug delivery systems, especially for cancer therapies and sustained release mechanisms. These applications exploit the nanoparticle’s ability to penetrate tissues and release drugs at targeted sites.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has acknowledged the difficulty of replacing TiO₂ in pharmaceuticals, even as it explores alternatives. In the U.S., there is no requirement to disclose nano content in pharmaceutical labeling, and no mandate to study its long-term effects on human health.

**Toxicological Concerns**

Titanium dioxide nanoparticles pose risks that bulk TiO₂ does not. These include:

- Genotoxicity: Nanoparticles generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) that damage DNA.
- Immunotoxicity: They activate immune cells, triggering inflammation.
- Neurotoxicity: They can cross the blood–brain barrier and accumulate in brain tissue.
- Endocrine disruption: They interfere with gut hormone signaling, affecting insulin and appetite.
- Bioaccumulation: They persist in organs like the liver, spleen, and brain, with no known clearance mechanism.

These effects are not due to the release of elemental titanium, but to the nanoparticle’s surface charge, size, and reactivity. The human digestive system cannot break the titanium–oxygen bond, but it can absorb the particle itself—especially when it is small enough to bypass biological filters.

**Regulatory Timeline and Divergence**

| Year | Event | Region |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1966 | FDA approves TiO₂ in food (no special designation) | USA |
| 1975–77 | EU allows TiO₂ (E171) | Europe |
| 2016 | EFSA re-evaluates E171 | Europe |
| 2020 | France bans E171 | France |
| 2022 | EU-wide ban on E171 | Europe |
| 2024 | EMA explores alternatives for pharma | Europe |

The U.S. remains an outlier, allowing TiO₂ in food and pharmaceuticals without particle-size disclosure, despite mounting evidence of harm.

**Typological Audit: Whitening as Concealment**

Titanium dioxide is not just a compound—it is a symbolic agent of industrial purification. It whitens surfaces, masks imperfections, and standardizes appearance. But in its nanoparticle form, it becomes a molecular infiltrator, slipping past biological defenses and disrupting cellular systems.

This transformation—from bulk pigment to charged nanoparticle—is not disclosed to the public. It is a ritual of concealment, where the aesthetic logic of whiteness overrides the epistemic logic of safety. Regulators have failed to distinguish between pigment and penetrant, between surface and system.

**Conclusion: Toward Public Reckoning**

The infiltration of titanium dioxide nanoparticles into the human organism is not accidental—it is systemic. It reflects a regulatory culture that privileges industrial convenience over biological integrity. Consumers deserve transparency, accountability, and protection.

This editorial calls for:
- Mandatory nanoparticle disclosure in all ingestible and injectable products
- Long-term toxicological studies on TiO₂-NPs
- Public access to particle-size data
- A symbolic reframing: TiO₂ is not just a pigment—it is a molecular agent of industrial ideology

Until then, the whitening ritual continues—bright, silent, and biologically uninvited.

Impressions by Secrets Moxche review!
1000/10

I wrote a review a while back for Secrets Royal Beach in Punta Cana so wanted to follow it up with our second stay at a Secrets resort. We’re here 8 days for our honeymoon. We had a wonderful time at Royal Beach, but Impressions by Secrets Moxche has blown us away completely! Everything here is absolutely phenomenal. I emailed with a concierge before we arrived to let her know it was our honeymoon, and the second we checked in, they were congratulating us without us having to mention it again. Even our bell hop was informed because he too congratulated us when dropping our luggage! The staff really made it feel so special! They had rose petals on the bed, a bottle of sparkling wine, complimentary bottle of tequila all waiting for us. 

We picked this spot for our honeymoon because we knew we wanted a relaxed all inclusive vibe. It was also important for us to have some sort of nice room to enjoy. The Secrets resort is on the same grounds as the Impressions building. Being a guest at Impressions, you can use any and all amenities at Secrets, however guests of Secrets can’t come to the Impressions side. The benefits of Impressions is totally worth while in my opinion. You have a rooftop spot called Cielo, which is a restaurant, pool surrounded by loungers and day beds, and an infinity pool. Drinks and lunch are delivered to you right where you lay, the service is just wonderful. They also have premium liquor. We’re early morning people and we’re the first ones up top almost every day so getting a spot was never difficult. Even later in the afternoon there were still spots open. When we stayed at Secrets Royal Beach we paid for the preferred club upgrade, however it seemed it would have been easy to just wander into all preferred areas if we hadn’t, nobody really checked. Here at Impressions, they ask for your room number and last name any time you come to the rooftop or restaurants/bars, so they really make sure only Impressions guests are using the amenities.  You also get a butler with your stay at impressions, and while we don’t ever use this service much, our girl Mariana was SOOO lovely and wonderful!!

Impressions is definitely the most beautiful relaxing vibe in the world. People mingle and chat in the pool, background music plays all day. But overall it’s in no way a party vibe at impressions, so if that’s the vibe you’re looking for most of your trip, you’d probably enjoy the Secrets side more. They have a ton of huge pools with swim up bars and more lively music and activities.  The food at this rooftop is WONDERFUL. My husband ate the Smash Burger every single day. The flat bread, shrimp roles- nothing tasted like your typical AI food. 

More on the food- almost all delicious!! Most of the restaurant are on the Secrets side, so you walk over at night and they’re first come first serve (no reservations at the standard ones). The longest we waited was an hour one night because we got there a little later, probably about 715. Each other time we got there before 7pm we only waited about 25 minutes or so. They give you a buzzer so it was nice to just bring it to one of the bars and grab a drink while we waited. The French, Italian, wood fire grill, were all amazing. Great serving sizes, zero complaints. Mexican was meh- but to each their own, a couple we met loved it the most. The buffet is only open for breakfast and lunch because there’s plenty of restaurants to pick for dinner. Only 1 on the Impressions side to eat at whenever and while we haven’t had dinner there yet, we’ve eaten breakfast and lunch there and both were phenomenal. 

A little more on our room as well! We did a Signature ocean view suite and it was beautiful. Like the entire resort, everything was just crafted so well. We stayed on the 4th floor and the room was cold enough, there was no smells, very clean, a fully stocked mini bar and coffee machine with some snacks replenished daily. We also had a wonderful giant tub on the balcony that we looooved using at the end of the day. It overlooked the resort and we saw a beautiful sunrise and sunset every morning from it. Exactly what we wanted. We considered the swim out suite- which while they seemed huge and very cool- not really very private as everyone in rooms above you overlook them. We’re happy with what we picked! 

We aren’t normally spa people but we did do a 1 hour hydrotherapy followed by an 80 minute relaxing massage. The hydrotherapy was great! Steam room, sauna, cold plunge, different jets for back/legs/feet/scalp etc. Nice experience and pretty affordable. No other excursions booked, we just wanted to relax all week and that’s exactly what we did! We absolutely positively have loved this resort and it would be difficult not to pick coming back to this one over trying a new one in the future! If you are looking for the most perfect all inclusive resort, strongly reccommend this one!",3,1762718120.0,AllInclusiveResorts,0,0.8,False
1osszg1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1osszg1,"The Shay, Culver City review","Really, really impressed by the Shay in Culver City, California. Everything about this hotel feels new, fresh, comfortable and exciting.

While not a luxury stay, every little thing at this hotel feels well thought out. The two restaurants on site are exceptional. The walkable neighborhood filled with coffee, shops, brewery, and casual shopping and eateries is delightful.

Check-in was easy and service friendly. Only a discoverist but got a 2 PM late checkout and $50 food credit without having to ask. 

Location is fantastic, right on a metro stop if that’s your bag, 20 minute drive from LAX. Lots of rentable scooters and bikes next-door.

The total surprise was the lovely pool and bar area on the roof. Even for a native California like myself I was felighted, being able to hang out at the pool in the month of November with poolside drink service, a chill atmosphere, and again exceptional food, and drink.

The only negative I have about the place makes me sound like such an old man. I almost don’t wanna say it. But the piped in music is too loud everywhere. Other than that, this place is a winner.",6,1762718119.0,hyatt,1,1.0,False

A man tried to get it to work again but said I have to get it fixed elsewhere. He drove off and his cousin (23m) stayed with me in the cold for an hour while we waited for the tow truck. He tried to calm me down and got me something to drink, eventually gave me his jacket too since I was freezing and I asked for his number so I could buy him a coffee for the help.

He texted me immediately when he got home. The next day he asked if I wanted to get something to drink but I was busy. Saturday I was going out with my friends to this festival and since he already asked what I was up to I told him he can join us. He drove almost 2 hours and we walked around a little. Then later we were pretty much cuddling in the cold…. aaaand we made out soon after.

He’s really sweet, totally my type too. It feels a little too good to be true. We will meet again tomorrow to grab coffee and I was wondering if I should ask him what his intentions are. We kissed already and I’m worried if that was a little too quick even if I enjoyed it.

I like the kind of energy where two people just click, talk for hours about random things, grab coffee, go on spontaneous drives, and genuinely enjoy each other’s company. I’m not looking to waste anyone’s time — I’m just real about where I’m at. Life’s already chaotic, so I prefer keeping things easy, honest, and fun.

I love meeting someone who’s confident, playful, and knows how to flirt without trying too hard. Someone who doesn’t take everything too seriously but still values respect and communication. If we vibe, great — we’ll laugh, banter, and see where it goes. If not, no hard feelings.

Casual doesn’t mean careless. I believe in being straightforward, giving good energy, and making sure both of us are comfortable. At the end of the day, dating should feel exciting, not like a job interview. I’m all about good conversations, mutual attraction, and that spark that makes you forget to check your phone.

But I need insight on whether I can buy everything I need for my first kit for under £500 i.e. sage bamino + grinder + any absolute essential accessories (can wait till later if not essential).  I don't really want to be spend £700+ as it could be too much of a sunk cost.

I’ve had acne all my life- since I was 11 and I’m now in my 30s
It’s never gone away.
I’ve been working on identifying my triggers and addressing them over the last 5 years or so and have made huge progress.
But I’ve found a new one that I thought I would share just incase it’s something someone else wants to try.

I’m a snacker- I love to snack. On healthy food or unhealthy doesn’t matter. My acne doesn’t like when I have a bunch of sugar, but I can have some of it out it making a huge difference for me.

But recently I saw some advice for gut health to only eat every 4 hours or so.
I was eating my meals apart- but I would have a handful of snacks or a coffee with milk in between. Constantly snacking. 
I’ve recently started giving myself a minimum of 3 hours between every time I ingest something. But eating the same amount of food/number of calories. 

My skin has improved hugely!! It’s the week of my period and only one little spot has showed up which is incredible for me. It’s not perfect but like 60% improvement. 
I’ve changed absolutely nothing else but giving my gut a chance to digest and rest. I think it helps with inflammation and blood sugar. 

It’s not advice I’ve seen around loads- so though i would share incase anyone wants to see if it works for them too. ",1,1762717748.0,acne,3,1.0,False

1ossm5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/astrologymemes/comments/1ossm5l/my_zodiac_signs_ranking_list/,My Zodiac Signs ranking list,"I am a Cancer in Sun, Aquarius in Moon and rising in Virgo and here is my detailed list which includes the tier lists and their positive and bad aspects:

  
A Tier List (I love them):

1. Pisces: Pisces are sweet, kind, and deeply empathetic souls. They feel the world intensely, which makes them incredibly caring and supportive, especially when you’re going through dark or difficult times. Their love is gentle but unwavering, they have a natural ability to make you feel seen, heard, and understood without needing words. Once they feel comfortable with you, their playful, funny, and communicative side shines through, revealing a creative and imaginative personality that can turn even ordinary moments into something magical. Sure, they can be dreamy and emotional, sometimes lost in their own thoughts or idealistic visions, but that sensitivity is part of what makes them so uniquely connected. For the right person, a Pisces forms a bond that feels nurturing, soulful, and enduring, a true heaven in a chaotic world.

2. Virgo: Virgos are the quiet protectors. They notice the smallest details, not to judge you, but because they care. They’ll remember how you take your coffee, the tone you use when you’re upset, and the song that calms you down. They’re loyal, dependable, and grounded, but also perfectionists to a fault. Their heart is gold but wrapped in practicality; they’ll fix your problems while pretending not to be emotional. Deep down, they crave peace and order in a chaotic world. They care deeply, even if they don’t always say it out loud. When you’re struggling, they show up, not with grand words, but with actions that speak louder. They give, they help, and they stay. Their loyalty runs quiet but deep.  
Still, when things don’t go as planned, their perfectionism can turn sharp. They might get critical or harsh, not out of cruelty, but frustration that the world rarely meets their standards. Underneath it all, it’s just their way of wanting things, and people, to be their best.

B Tier List (I like them, they are worth it):

3. Cancer: Cancers are soft, loyal, and deeply protective. They care with their whole heart, often supporting and helping you even without you asking. Their love and attentiveness are quiet but unwavering, making you feel safe and valued. They are nurturing by nature, always ready to take care of the people they love. At the same time, they can be sensitive and take things very personally. Their protective instincts can sometimes become controlling, and they may retreat into isolation when hurt. Despite this, they have a remarkable ability to heal quickly and bounce back, turning emotional vulnerability into resilience.

  
4. Libra: Libras are charming, kind, and highly social. They have a natural talent for making people feel comfortable, heard, and appreciated, and they value harmony above all else. Their diplomatic nature allows them to act as peacemakers, smoothing conflicts and maintaining balance in relationships. They are thoughtful, fair-minded, and sensitive to the needs of others, making them loyal and supportive friends or partners. On the flip side, their desire to please everyone can make them indecisive or hesitant, and sometimes they struggle to assert their own needs. They can appear naive or emotionally shallow at times, and inconsistency may frustrate more grounded personalities. Despite these flaws, their warmth, empathy, and ability to connect on both intellectual and emotional levels make them genuinely enjoyable to be around.

5. Sagittarius: Sagittarians are social, communicative, spontaneous, and adventurous. They love exploring the world and bringing excitement to the people around them, making life feel vibrant and fun. Their humor, creativity, and playful energy can turn even ordinary moments into unforgettable memories. They are loyal and direct, always speaking their mind honestly, which makes them refreshing to be around. On the other hand, Sagittarians can be emotionally shallow, stubborn, and impulsive at times. They dislike clinginess and need freedom to feel fulfilled. While some might find this challenging, but for someone like me with a Cancer Sun with an Aquarius Moon who values adventure, independence, and social connections, Sagittarius energy is surprisingly compatible. Their adventurous spirit, humor, and love for freedom complement my personality, making them enjoyable and energizing companions.

  
C Tier (Enjoyable but with some limitations)

  
6. Taurus: Taurus people are solid, grounded, and reliable people. They value stability and honesty, which makes them loyal and trustworthy companions. Once they make up their mind, however, it’s nearly impossible to change it, their stubbornness can be frustrating, but it also means you always know where you stand. They crave security in relationships and provide a comforting, safe presence, though their fear of change can sometimes hold them back. Being with a Taurus feels steady and reassuring, sometimes mayb*e* too safe, but that consistency is part of their charm.

  
7. Aquarius: Aquarians are solid and intriguing people. They are open-minded, free-spirited, and adventurous, with a sharp intellect that makes them genuinely fascinating. They are social, interactive, and filled with full of interesting ideas, they can bring excitement and inspiration to any group. On the flip side, they can be emotionally distant or cold, which may make deep emotional connections challenging at times. However, for someone like me, with an Aquarius Moon who values freedom, exploration, and independence, their adventurous spirit and love for freedom feels compatible and energizing.

D Tier List (Not for me)

8. Aries: Aries are energetic, bold, and loyal people. Their passion and drive make them exciting to be around, and their courage often inspires those near them. However, they can be easily angered by small things, which can feel draining. They are sometimes unaware of others’ emotions, focusing more on outcomes than on the experiences people go through along the way. Their impulsiveness and strong-willed nature can create tension, making relationships with them intense but also unpredictable.

  
9. Gemini: Geminis are social, communicative, and intelligent people, full of energy and curiosity. Their quick wit and charm make them engaging and fun to be around. However, they can be emotionally unstable and unpredictable. Their moods and affections shift quickly, one moment they may be deeply invested, the next they can pull away or change their mind. This dual nature can make it hard to know where I stand with them, which is why some people find them challenging to trust. Despite these flaws, their lively personality keeps interactions exciting and dynamic.

  
F Tier List (Toxic relationship ☠️)

  
10. Capricorn: Capricorns are hardworking, disciplined, and often very successful in life. They set high standards for themselves and for those around them. However, when it comes to social interaction, they can come across as distant, antisocial, or emotionally closed off. They tend to be bad-tempered, controlling, and possessive, expecting others to meet their standards and ego needs. If those expectations aren’t met, they can withdraw and ignore you totally and create tensions in the relationship. For someone who values freedom, adventure, and open-mindedness, Capricorns can feel rigid, closed-off, and difficult to connect with.

  
11. Leo: Leos are naturally social, charismatic, and love being in the spotlight. However, they can be very bad-tempered, impulsive, and dramatic, taking things far more seriously than necessary. Their need for constant attention and admiration can feel exhausting, and their extravagant or showy behavior sometimes comes across as overbearing. For someone who prefers balance, calm, and subtlety, Leo energy can feel overwhelming and very difficult to manage, even if their confidence and charisma are undeniable.

  
12. SCORPIOOOSSS: Scorpios are intense, magnetic, and highly complex individuals. On paper, they might seem like a perfect match for a Cancer, both are emotional, deep, and passionate, but in real life, they can feel like a storm that’s difficult to navigate. Their emotional depth often comes with extremes, they can be loving and loyal, but also controlling, jealous, and possessive. They crave power in relationships and often want to dictate the pace, dynamics, or boundaries, which clashes strongly with someone like you who values freedom, ease, and light-hearted connection.

Scorpios are cautious and secretive around new people, often analyzing interactions carefully. Unfortunately, this can manifest as suspicion, judgment, or even subtle manipulation. They notice weaknesses in others, not to help, but to exploit or control them. If they feel betrayed or hurt, even unintentionally, they are known to hold grudges for a long time. Their reactions can be harsh, emotionally overwhelming, and sometimes destructive, leaving lasting scars on trust and confidence.

In social, family or professional environments, Scorpios can be intimidating. Their intensity, combined with a tendency to talk behind others’ backs or silently evaluate every move, makes them unpredictable. For someone like me, who thrives on social interaction, humor, affection, and freedom, Scorpio energy can feel suffocating, draining, and even toxic. From my  personal experience with two female Scorpio friends, I’ve seen how their intensity and need for control clashed violently with my personality, which created situations that are emotionally exhausting and hurtful.

In short, while Scorpios have remarkable depth, loyalty, and passion, their controlling tendencies, possessiveness, and emotional extremes make them a totally poor match for those who seek freedom, ease, and positive social energy. They are beautiful in theory, but for me, they are like walking emotional landmines, exciting yet potentially destructive. For all Scorpios I feel sorry about y'all but maybe is my fault that I got myself with unhealed Scorpios.",2,1762717253.0,astrologymemes,8,0.62,False

I will sit down with you in person or online and get a feel for where you are right now. I will give you direct advice on what you need to change and what things make you unique in a good way that you should keep. This is coming from a balanced view from someone who is neither in the red pill or woke community, but has consumed massive amounts of content on both sides. My dating ranges from meeting people online, in social groups and also friendly chats with strangers that turn into dates at a coffee shop or in a grocery store. 

So what does this cost? The first 25 minute video call is free, and further sessions will be by donation at first. I am building a website and payment structure but for now my goal is to offer you so much value now that you are happy to pay later when the opportunity is there. 

Continued work with me will involve touching up your online dating profiles, adjusting your wardrobe if needed, reviewing your work and hobby schedule to find the best times and places to meet new people and most importantly... I will bluntly tell you what you need start and stop doing so that you can be the most charismatic version of yourself. 

Some of the most pressing questions you may have will be answered in a method tailor made for you. For men, you'll find the answers to things like why you may feel a strong attraction towards someone but an even stronger hesitation to actually introduce yourself as well feeling stressed in a conversation because you don't know what to say next. And for women, wondering why it's always the guys you find creepy that approach you, while the ones you actually like seem to be hard to find, and how to keep them around once you find them rather than getting ghosted.

To begin, send me a dm here and we will go from there.

I've been fine-tuning this letter for a while now. I am a little conflicted about how many 'spoilers' to put in the query letter. For some background - this is a dual POV novel. Monica tells her story traditionally, while the second narrator is referred to only as ""Her"", and she tells her story from the moment of a fatal accident,  *in reverse*. The reader is introduced to the fact that the second narrator got away with something awful, long before they know who she is, how she is connected to Monica, what she did and why. The issue is that every query letter version that I have written thus far, i've tried to represent that element of the book, but it falls flat with people who have read those queries. In the letter below, I just name the second narrator, what she did and how she is related to the protagonist, so basically all the spoilers.

Also, a couple of people have pointed out that 95K words may be on the high side. I'd love to hear what you all think about that. I look forward to any feedback.  


Dear Agent**,**

Based on your interest in *MSWL items here***,** I’m excited to share my dual POV, character-driven psychological thriller, A SINGLE DROP OF REMORSE, complete at 95,000-words. It explores the implications of motherhood and pregnancy—both wanted and unwanted. Echoing the structural originality of Jodi Picoult’s *Mad Honey,* it will also appeal to fans of Frieda McFadden’s *The Coworker* for its readability and workplace drama.

When miscarriage upends Monica’s life and grief threatens to crush her, she leans on her friends for support. Unfortunately for Monica, anyone can be a psychopath, even an elementary school teacher.  

Monica is your quintessential Midwestern wife and mother of two. Fueled by naive trust in her community and a serious coffee addiction, she adores her job as the secretary of a rural Iowa school. Devastated by infertility and miscarriage, she and her husband must come to terms with remaining a family of four. When rumors circulate about her friend and coworker, Clara—Monica decides that the accusations are so abhorrent they can’t be true. After all, Monica would know if they'd been pregnant at the same time. Clara wouldn’t hide a pregnancy and bury the baby. Or would she?

One muggy August evening, Clara hears a banging on her door. She recognizes the visitor as her ex-boyfriend, and he’s demanding to know if the rumors are true. She feigns ignorance and shoves him off her front porch. The altercation that ensues leaves Clara fatally impaled on a garden stake. As she bleeds out with little hope of rescue, she recalls her life in reverse through a series of flashbacks. 

When the legal system delivers Clara little more than a slap on the wrist, Monica must decide what lengths she will go to in order to get justice.

My Name lives in A Place, and worked for more than ten years in rural Montana elementary schools. My personal experience with miscarriage deeply informs the emotional landscape of this novel, giving voice to the complex and often unspoken reality of the sorrow surrounding pregnancy loss.

Thank you for your consideration,

1osshde,https://www.reddit.com/r/LastFortress/comments/1osshde/shanks_and_the_squirrel_squad/,Shanks and the Squirrel Squad,"
Shanks wasn’t much of a writer. Every time he tried, his sentences came out like they’d been hit by a truck full of spelling errors and driven through a grammar storm. Still, that didn’t stop him from keeping a journal. Every page was about one thing — or rather, one person: Elly.
Elly with the bright laugh. Elly with the way she said his name like it didn’t belong to a disaster of a man. He wrote about her every night, usually while chewing on a half-eaten bag of Doritos, and usually with Fortnite blaring in the background.
“Shanks! Drop the gold pump!” squeaked a voice through his headset.
That was Nutters, one of the squirrels on his team. Actual squirrels — small, hyperactive, and surprisingly good at building. They’d met on a public lobby one night after Shanks had accidentally joined a “woodland creatures only” custom match.
“I found the gold pump, Nutters,” Shanks said, clutching it like treasure. “Finders keepers.”
“You always say that!” another squirrel, Chippy, yelled. “You don’t even aim right! You just spin around and shoot the floor!”
Shanks ignored them. He was too busy imagining Elly watching his gameplay, impressed by his “strategy.” He liked to think she’d find his squirrel squad charming, maybe even endearing.
But the truth was, Elly didn’t even play Fortnite. She worked at the coffee shop down the street and barely remembered Shanks’ name. He knew that because once, when he ordered his usual triple caramel frappe with extra drizzle, she smiled and said,
“Have a great day, uh… Sean?”
That one stung. He wrote about it in his journal later that night:
“Elly smiled at me today. I think she’s starting to see the real me. (Also got 3rd place in solos. Nutters died early again. Useless rodent.)”
As the weeks went on, Shanks’ obsession only grew. He’d talk to the squirrels about her between matches.
“Do you think Elly likes gamers?” he asked.
“She likes people who share,” Chippy muttered, glaring at the stack of rare loot Shanks had hoarded.
Then one day, something strange happened. Elly joined Fortnite. Her username popped up in the lobby: EllyBeans23. Shanks nearly dropped his controller.
“Elly?” he whispered into the mic, forgetting the squirrels were there.
“Who’s Elly?” Nutters asked.
“My destiny,” Shanks said dramatically.
He invited her to the squad. She joined — for about 30 seconds. During those 30 seconds, Shanks panicked, dropped all his weapons, and accidentally blew up his own build with a grenade. Elly left without saying a word.
Silence filled the lobby. Then Chippy sighed.
“Smooth, Romeo.”
Shanks didn’t respond. He just stared at the screen. Then, slowly, he opened his journal and wrote:
“Elly joined my game tonight. It was perfect. Until it wasn’t. But love — love’s like Fortnite. You get knocked down. You build again.”
And with that, Shanks queued up for another round with his squirrel squad, still dreaming, still looting, and still convinced that someday, Elly would see him for the legend he truly was — even if he couldn’t spell “legend” right on the first try.",7,1762716947.0,LastFortress,4,0.89,False

1ossbe8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ossbe8,A 24hr Brazilian Marines Ration (and my 25th Country!),"Hi folks!

Shout-out to MKR for this one as I obtained this intact 24hr Brazilian ration from him in a trade. Thank you Mike! This is also my 25th country!

What a great experience this ration was! Best by date is 2023, but that only really reared its head on a couple times. 

Pics 1-8 show packaging and contents.

Pic 9 shows the coffee, with a 5 gram sugar pack and 2 US Non-Dairy creamers added. 3/4 cup water. Flavor was great and definitely tastes different than Bill's Brew with more ""nutty"" notes.  Was a very smooth coffee in my opinion. 

Pics10-11 show 2 packs of the toast, the chocolate strawberry granola bar, and the 2 jams. These jams were strawberry and guava. Both sweet and very thick, with the strawberry being my preferred flavor. The toast was super crunchy and the strawberry bar had great texture but hints of rancidity. I've seen a few reviews of these and the toasts are always broken into shards, but out the chaos of these 2 packs arose a single,  fully intact, slice of toast! What a sight slathered in jam!

Pics 12-15 show drinks. Orange, Lime, Hot Chocolate,  and a hot Carmel Coffee drink. The beverage bases were amazing with the lime one being one of the best drinks I've ever had in a ration! The hot drinks were good but both suffered from notes of rancidity and I did not finish either as a result. 

Pic 16 is the Rapadura bar! This thing was great! I don't want to upset any nations here, but honestly,   as soon as I put a chunk of this in my mouth, I immediately thought of maple syrup. Both my kids agreed too. I just sucked on chunks of this during a long walk. Tasted great! I did save some to have with the Farinah, as I did not have that component yet. May sweeten that with the rapadura into a Porridge sort of thing later on. 

Pic 17 shows the beef in sauce over rice. The rice was in its own retort pouch and heated up perfectly in boiling water along with the meat and sauce. This was a great meal! Very hearty, very savory, and just tasted like beef and gravy over rice, which appealed to my midwestern taste buds very nicely! I added some crsuhed red pepper just to kick it up a notch, but hot sauce would have been great too. No salt needed here but pepper would have been welcome!

Pic 18 shows the spaghetti and sausages (came in separate retort pouches). The sausages had a soft texture with a nice Smokey and salty taste. I ate both without issue. The spaghetti tastes great but the pasta was very mushy. Again, I added crushed red pepper just to kick it up, but tobasco would have been great too!

This ration doesn't give much snacks for sure, but the mains are hearty at almost 700 kcal each when combined with their sides (beef with rice and spaghetti with sausages). A great selection of drinks as well!

A great experience and I'm thankful for getting to have it!

- **Procrastination** – We overthink and under-act. One “I’ll start tomorrow” can easily become never.  
- **Perfectionism** – Waiting until everything is “just right” keeps us stuck.  
- **Fear** – Of failure, success, judgement... take your pick.  
- **Lack of Clarity** – Goals too vague = plans too shaky.  
- **Distractions** – Endless scrolling, random tasks, and that sneaky voice saying, “You deserve a break.”  

### 🚀 How to Actually Overcome Them
1. Break big goals into ridiculously small steps. If it feels too easy, good — do it.  
2. Track small wins daily — momentum loves acknowledgment.  
3. Build triggers that spark action (coffee + 20 min work session = magic).  
4. Forgive slip-ups fast. Regret burns energy you could spend restarting.  
5. Revisit your *why* weekly — it’s your motivational GPS.  

Because honestly… losing motivation doesn’t mean you’ve failed. It just means you’ve wandered too far from your reason for starting.  

### 🕒 Prioritizing Like a Pro
Not every goal deserves equal attention. Some are your core, others are background noise.  

Ask yourself:  
- Does this move me closer to who I want to become?  
- Will this still matter in six months?  
- What happens if I delay this one?  

Then — schedule accordingly. The calendar never lies.  

### 💡 Creating Real, Actionable Plans
- **Outline the goal**: What exactly are you aiming for?  
- **Attach a timeline**: Deadlines turn dreams into decisions.  
- **Assign tasks**: Use digital tools or an old-fashioned notebook.  
- **Review + adjust weekly**: Progress thrives on reflection.  

Little steps compound like interest. Before you know it, the “impossible” morphs into “inevitable.”  

### 💪 Building Confidence and Mindset
Confidence isn’t about feeling ready — it’s about acting *before* you do.  

Every small promise you keep with yourself is a deposit into your self-trust account.  
Every risk you take teaches your brain, “See? We can handle this.”  

Repeat that process enough times, and suddenly you’re unstoppable.  

Honestly, I’m curious — which part of goal achieving messes you up the most? The planning? The consistency? The self-doubt? Because I’ve been through all of it… sometimes all at once. 😂  

Let’s talk in the comments — drop what’s holding you back right now, or what hack keeps you going even when motivation dips.

Early 2000's- Chicago: had a tiramisu-esque dessert at a nice restaurant (American italian cuisine). Instead of ladyfingers there was wafers. Instead of being soaked in coffee, it had more of a lemon curd profile.

I asked for the recipe, said they would ask and to come in again.  I tried to dissect what was inside as I was eating it. Mascarpone/cream cheese/ maybe ricotta as well?

 Dan and Amy got themselves put together and decide to ride home together, since they both needed to be back at work first thing in the morning. Amy was still on a post orgasm high. Still trying to process everything, started questioning Dan

 “You ever do it in the office before?” Amy asks teasingly.

“Only in my dreams. Office life and personal life were kept very separate.” 

“So you wanted to do it in the office, any where else?”

“Baby Girl you have obviously not figured out that any good red blooded American boy has imagined a whole list of places they would want to get it on with a beautiful woman. Just so you know, I have a very good imagination.” Giving Amy a wink. 
“So what is your favorite part of our last few days together.”Trying to change the topic.

“Second favorite is you dressing up in your suit to take me on a date to Toni’s. You are not allowed to wear that suit unless I’m on your arm.  My favorite I’ll tell you but you’re probably going to think it’s silly,”

“No I won’t. Well maybe I will, but I’m sure you’ll make me understand why.”

“Dancing in the kitchen.”Amy whispers. 

“Really? Why?”Just a little surprised. 

“Never before in my life or marriage, had I been romanced like that.” A smile crept across the Silver Fox’s face. “At first I thought it was just being silly, but the way you held me just made me melt inside. I felt desired.” He reached across and grabbed her tiny hand in his big paw of a hand and kissed it. They rode in silence the rest of the way to the farm. 

Monday was steak night.  They went out and did the evening chores. They took some extra time and just drove around enjoying the evening. Then back to the house. Dan got the grill going, while Amy whipped up the sides. There was a bag of potatoes. She looked in the refrigerator for inspiration. There was meat milk and eggs. Nothing green or staples beyond steak sauce and salsa. This is a bachelor refrigerator, ‘I’m going to have to fix this next weekend.’ Finally finding some canned vegetables In the cabinet. 

Dan comes in and announces we have 8 minutes before I flip the steaks. Do you want to make out?”

Amy laughs, “I can’t refuse an offer like that!”

Dan lifts her up and puts her on the island as always. Softly kissing her in no hurry just a fun make out session. Just before the 8 minutes is up he cups her breasts and fondles her piercings. “I didn’t know what to think of these at first but now they really turn me on. You might have to get more piercings.” Amy  sits there and blushes. 

Dan stays outside and finishes cooking the steaks. Amy slips into the bedroom and puts on one of his shirts. 

Returning with the steaks, a big smile lights up his. “No one told me we were dressing up for dinner.” Setting the steaks on the counter he disappears into the bedroom. Re-emerging in a white shirt and the dark sport coat, still wearing his boots and wranglers. 

The words ‘if he wanted to he would’ kept running through her head. She walked up to him stood on her tip toes kissed him passionately.

“Thank you, Daddy.”

They get sat down to a dinner steak baked potato and green beans. As they began to eat Dan asks, what’s on your calendar coming up?”

“A wedding in May back home, that I was hoping a really cute guy I know would be my plus one.”

“That could be arranged. Steve, Julie and the kids are close by so we can make a big weekend of it.”

“Is there any way we could pull a trailer? My old horse is still at Dad’s. Would you have room for another animal around here?”

“Anything you want.”

After supper they clear the dishes. Dan leads Amy into the den and cuddle up on the couch under a light blanket. A baseball game gets turned on.

“So is it baseball and chill tonight?” Amy asks teasing. 

“No chill tonight my sexy secretary wore me out.” Amy smiles and snuggles closer. 

They fall asleep on the couch and finally move to the bedroom about eleven. 

At 6:00 the alarm goes off and Dan heads to the kitchen to make coffee. Amy makes the bed, picks today’s outfit then starts the shower, standing there naked for Dan. Who comes in sets her coffee on the vanity and gives her a kiss on the forehead and heads back to the kitchen. Amy stands there in disbelief. She walks into the kitchen wearing only a smile.

“What the HELL was that Dan!”

“I just thought.” The words barely got out of his mouth and Amy erupted. 

“Well you thought wrong Mr! Get that cute ass back in the shower right this second. Also never kiss a naked woman on the forehead unless you plan on kissing every other part of her body!”

Dan knew by the tone the only safe thing to do was to go take a shower. He headed towards the shower followed by Amy. He helps her into the shower, takes off his shorts and gets in. Gives Amy a passionate kiss and held her close under the warm water. 

Dan works up his courage, “So for future reference, you were actually upset with me.”

“ Damn right I was upset.”

“Real upset.”

“Yes.”

“It is a good thing I didn’t make a joke.”

“Damn good thing.”

“Is there anything I can do to apologize.”

“You know what you need to do.”

Dan kissed her on the forehead, then her lips then down to her neck. Amy started to moan softly. Cups her ass with one hand, takes one nipple and piercing into his mouth while sliding the other to tease her clit.“So am I on the right track?”

“Oh fuck.” Was Baby Girls response. As here body starts trembling. Dan slides down and sucks her clit into his mouth which pushes her to orgasm. But he doesn’t stop, he slides one leg onto his shoulder for better access. Working his magic on he lips. Slowly standing up sliding himself along her leg till he enters her. Holds her leg around him as kisses her passionately and drives into her. 

“Be a good slut and cum for Daddy.” As he softly bites down on her neck.

That bite triggered everything. Dan couldn’t hold her up in that position and slowly lowered her to the shower floor. Positioning himself so she laid in his lap. As Amy started coming around she mumbled “Apology accepted.”",2,1762716010.0,u_DanandAmy-Thestory,0,1.0,False

I have my driving test the same time where I am having my mocks, but fortunately I have it on the last day of it.

I am currently on 30 hours of lessons and I did two mock test. But always I am picking up lessons back from holidays, this time I didn’t do any lesson for the October half term and only did 4 lessons before my test.

Two of them were mock test where the first one I barely passed, with 6 minors and had one close call in a meeting traffic situation where I didn’t hold back on the street where the other side has priority and tried to squeeze through, but the cars on the opposite lanes managed to drive through as well so I didn’t get a serious fault for that. And also got confused with a roundabout where the SATNAV told me to go straight but the roundabout uses the right lane for it but I was on the left, but fortunately I didn’t cross the wrong lane to go straight, I just followed to go left.

The second mock test where I did today ended up failing. Got 1 serious fault and 10 minors. My instructor said there weren’t big issues but just felt like I was rushing. Failed on the same situation of meeting traffic. On a street where there were many parked cars on the left, there was a car at the end of the street but I thought I was too far away from them and continued to drive to see if I can find a slot to stop and give them way. But they stopped and flash to let me through. And other minor faults was just slightly over the speed limit in one occasion, mirrors checking and crossing over the other lane when turning out from a junction. But I had one coffee and one energy drink before the mock test so might be that causing me to be rushing.

I still have my school mock exam tomorrow and I just feel my head is filled with driving and couldn’t focus on schoolwork. And just still worrying about my skills in roundabouts, meeting traffic and parking manoeuvres.

I have anxiety. It’s treated and better than it used to be. But heavy traffic can make me anxious and having lots of tasks to do in a time limit does too. 

When I get anxious, the icing on the cake is feeling like I’m letting someone down. So that spikes it even higher. When I’m driving, she just goes quiet and doesn’t say anything. Her idea of soothing in the part was to tell me what to do and jet way of driving is so distant to mine that it works cause me a meltdown. 

At home, it’s different. Today, we were having a friend of hers over. Yesterday, after asking me when I’d prefer her to come over, she started deep cleaning the house. I had no idea she’d do that. We have company over all the time and never do that. I had done a lot of chores on Friday, so I’d planned on resting on Saturday. I can’t explain it, but her tasks are intense. Tearing down the cat tree and rebuilding it, deep cleaning faucet handles, …things I’d never think of. She did clean the pool and swept the floors too. (Hardwood) She said she’d leave the mopping to me. I told her that I’d vacuum first to make sure to get up as much floor dirty first as I could. 

In my mind, I figured she wanted it done before her friend arrived. So I got up this morning and started there chores. Fed the critters, made coffee, my sister called. I noticed the time and things were getting backed up. 

After my call, I started to vacuum. Then the on the floors want debris, or was a piece of cat shit. I started to melt down. There was an hour left. I’d had no coffee yet and I crammed a snack into my face to tide me over. 

She told me to not worry about mopping. She was right. I dropped it and sat on the sofa with my coffee recovering, then I noticed the sofa cover was covered in cat hair! Argh. So I pulled it off to replace it. When we got the new cover on the sofa, I said that I was going to rest and recover my mood before her friend arrived for lunch. 

That’s when she announced that she never asked for me to do anything. I told her that I was trying to step up and give her what I was able to tell was her preference. I failed. She told me that it wasn’t her fault. ??  I hadn’t said anything was. I just told her that I was trying to do what I knew she’d prefer. She loves it when people just do things without being asked. She complains to me about other people who don’t just help when they should. I reminded her of that. Then she got angry and reiterated that this problem was all on me. She never asked for help. 

So here we are. A stupid fight stemming from my anxiety again. When I’m already feeling bad, I feel like she’s just doubles down and attacks me. She doesn’t In the car, but when it comes to chores, she does. I know she wanted the house cleaned up. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have been doing those things yesterday. 

I feel dammed if I do, dammed if I don’t. This is affecting trust. When I’m feeling anxious and vulnerable, I feel attacked when she blames me. I admit to not wanting to have sex any more because I don’t trust her. There are lots of over things…all individuals little, but an environment of feeling unheard, misunderstood, blamed, and sometimes railroaded. ",1,1762715869.0,Marriage,1,1.0,False

I'm Michael (Mike), 27 years old, and I live in Germany. I can speak English, German, and Polish (though I don't write well in Polish). I can be a bit reserved at first, but once I get comfortable, I'm all in and pretty much an open book at that point. I value honesty and loyalty, and I'm always trying to grow and improve. I'm pretty lowkey and keep it real.

**A Bit About Me**

* I'm a good listener, and I appreciate both deep conversations and lighthearted banter
* I like calm company—hanging in a voice call while we each do our own thing is underrated
* I'm into solo hobbies, but always open to trying something new if someone brings the spark
* I'm the type who loves to listen and be there for people, but I'll give advice if I can help. Sometimes just being present for someone is what matters most

**Why I'm Posting**

Lately, I've been stuck in my thoughts, and I'm trying to get out of the loop. Finding new friends is one way I think could really help me. I actually have close friends I've known for 12+ years, but they're all on the west coast of the US now, so timezones have been tough since I moved back to Germany. That's part of why I'm looking to connect with people closer to my timezone.

I'm not looking for a big group or server—just hoping to connect with genuine people. I love daily conversations and just checking in on how someone's day went. Whether we're gaming together, watching something, or just chilling on call doing our own thing—I'm flexible and easy going. Whether it's talking about life, vibing in silence, or sending random memes at 2AM—I'm here for it.

I connect best with people who are easy going and non-judgmental. I struggle with self-confidence sometimes, so finding people I really click with can take time, but once I do, I'm all in.

**My Interests**

I'll be honest—most of my hobbies are pretty solo. That's just how I grew up and what I gravitated toward. But I enjoy talking about them and hearing what other people are into.

**Music** has always been important to me. I used to make beats—mostly freestyle, trap, and phonk style—and I might get back into it soon. I'm all over the place with genres:

* Rock / Metal / Metalcore
* Rap / Underground Hip-Hop
* Trance / DnB / Phonk / Hardstyle

Always down to swap playlists or explore new sounds. Got a playlist that hits hard? Send it my way—I'm always listening (coffee gets me through work, energy drinks fuel the late nights).

**Other Stuff I'm Into**

* YouTube deep dives—conspiracy theories, car builds, iceberg videos, paranormal stuff, space content. I like keeping an open mind about these topics
* Binging shows and movies—I'm into old comedies and action films, and I want to get more into horror/scary movies too. Always open to recommendations or watching stuff together
* Just generally falling down rabbit holes. If it's weird or fascinating, I'm in
* Gaming (PC) - I play a mix of tactical shooters, survival games, and RPGs when I want to unwind

**A Bit About My Life**

I work in an office right now—mostly desk work—but I'm looking to get into IT since I know quite a bit about computers. When the weather's nice, I love getting outside and enjoying nature. And there's something about thunderstorms at night—just watching the lightning and chilling—that hits different.

I'm also slowly getting into working out, nothing crazy, just trying to be more active.

I'm a night owl, especially on days off and weekends. During the week when I work, I usually stay up till 11pm-12am. But on nights before my days off? 3-5am is my zone.

And hey, if none of this resonates with you, that's totally fine. I'm always looking to try new things and pick up new interests.

I'm mainly looking for genuine connections and friendships first, but I'm open to seeing where things go naturally if we really click. No pressure, no expectations.

If you're also craving something a little more real than surface-level chats, maybe we're on the same wavelength. Send me a DM or message—timezone differences don't bother me (as long as they're not too extreme), so reach out anytime!",1,1762715866.0,r4r,1,0.67,False

**Why I'm Posting**

Lately, I've been stuck in my thoughts, and I'm trying to get out of the loop. Finding new friends is one way I think could really help me. I actually have close friends I've known for 12+ years, but they're all on the west coast of the US now, so timezones have been tough since I moved back to Germany. That's part of why I'm looking to connect with people closer to my timezone.

I am just hoping to connect with genuine people. I love daily conversations and just checking in on how someone's day went. Whether we're gaming together, watching something, or just chilling on call doing our own thing—I'm flexible and easy going. Whether it's talking about life, vibing in silence, or sending random memes at 2AM—I'm here for it.

I connect best with people who are easy going and non-judgmental. I struggle with self-confidence sometimes, so finding people I really click with can take time, but once I do, I'm all in.

**My Interests**

I'll be honest—most of my hobbies are pretty solo. That's just how I grew up and what I gravitated toward. But I enjoy talking about them and hearing what other people are into.

**Music** has always been important to me. I used to make beats—mostly freestyle, trap, and phonk style—and I might get back into it soon. I'm all over the place with genres:

* Rock / Metal / Metalcore
* Rap / Underground Hip-Hop
* Trance / DnB / Phonk / Hardstyle

Always down to swap playlists or explore new sounds. Got a playlist that hits hard? Send it my way—I'm always listening (coffee gets me through work, energy drinks fuel the late nights).

**Other Stuff I'm Into**

* YouTube deep dives—conspiracy theories, car builds, iceberg videos, paranormal stuff, space content. I like keeping an open mind about these topics
* Binging shows and movies—I'm into old comedies and action films, and I want to get more into horror/scary movies too. Always open to recommendations or watching stuff together
* Just generally falling down rabbit holes. If it's weird or fascinating, I'm in
* Gaming (PC) - I play a mix of tactical shooters, survival games, and RPGs when I want to unwind

**A Bit About My Life**

I work in an office right now—mostly desk work—but I'm looking to get into IT since I know quite a bit about computers. When the weather's nice, I love getting outside and enjoying nature.

I'm also slowly getting into working out, nothing crazy, just trying to be more active.

I'm a night owl, especially on days off and weekends. During the week when I work, I usually stay up till 11pm-12am. But on nights before my days off? 3-5am is my zone.

Over the last 3 months I been on 5 dates with this lady (im going to call her Sarah) And overall its been nice, but we rarely see each other and she takes a few days to message back. She kept telling me how ""100% in our relationship she was"" But her actions did not always add up.

She suggested meeting her partents on the 14th for dinner and I thought that was a good sign of her wanting more consistency. Before that, she suggested we hang out more over half term. I was excited, but she was “too busy” except for a zoo trip and some aerial class she does.

I have an arm injury, so I said the aerial class might be tricky. She reassured me I’d be fine, so I went along. The zoo was fun, we were flirting, everything seemed great. On the way to coffee she asks, **“So are you my boyfriend now?”** I told her I wanted to spend more time and meet her parents first. She said, “That’s 100% okay.” Cool. I thought we were on the same page.

I get it, I rejected her, but I literal said how much I care and just wanted to make sure we both on the same page before making that commitment. 5 dates over 3 months did not feel like we had a solid enough foundation, especially with the lack of talking in between dates.

Then the aerial class happens. I take one look at the pole over 7ft in the air and realize I physically can’t do it. I sit out, cheer her on, help her when she needs it. She seems fine. But her friend running the class ignores me the whole time. After class, Sarah walks out with her friend without much acknowledgment.

Since then, 9 days ago I’ve had zero messages from her. Not one. I even checked in once. Nothing.

I get it, I did not say yes to a relationship straight away, but dam if you ever wanna take anything slow you basically dealing with people who wanna rush. It was her idea to meet her parents, it was her idea to spend more time together and it was her idea about being honest. I feel like I messed up a bit, but I feel like Im dealing with someone here who has some kind of communication issues.

I am a University (law) student. Last academic year I was meant to find a placement, but I failed to find one until the last minute. Uni put me in as a final year student but i now found a firm who would like to take me on as a placement student for a year.  It is a legal assistant role for a conveyancer so pretty good considering its soo hard to find a job these days right. But i obviously can not juggle a 9-5 and university. Uni said they can't do anything about it as placement deadline is over so they cant transfer me back to the placement route and the placement team is taking too long to reply. Idk what to do. Shall i take a absence of leave or something. Do they approve be absent due to a work opportunity or not. I really want to have a year in the industry and then go back to education. My prior university years have not been the best with burnout and anxiety. My social anxiety has been so bad since i started uni to the point i couldn't even order coffee. My grades haven't been the best as opposed to school and i just think im soo behind while everyones out having fun with their friends i'm nothing more than a loser who cant even make friends. Furthermore, many say theres no point of uni due to the bad job market. I really think this experience may motivate me to do well in my studies later when i come back. what shall i do?

So, I've been dealing with undiagnosed dysautonomia for over half of my life now. It started when I had the brilliant idea to starve myself over a prolonged period as a teenager. Though I stopped starving after 8 months, my body has never been the same. During that time, I developed extreme intolerance to heat and cold, my feet and legs turned purple when I sat down for extended periods, I started having chronic migraines and significantly delayed digestion, and felt constantly lightheaded, dizzy, and extremely thirsty no matter how much water I would drink. 

As a teenager, though I was never diagnosed, I believed I was suffering from Orthostatic Hypotension. The reason I think this, is that I would faint onto my bed every time I tried to get up in the morning. Every time, for a couple years. But then it just stopped happening. These days, it only happens every once in a blue moon, and only ever when I'm getting out of bed in the morning.

Outside of fainting when getting up in the morning, I've only actually fainted twice during the day. One time was during the starvation period, so I don't think that really reveals anything. I was probably dehydrated. The other time was just last year (I'm 32 now, 16 years removed from starvation, and a healthy weight now), where I fainted on the toilet. I presumed at the time that I fainted from pain, since I was experiencing the worst pain in my life in that moment, but looking back... I'm not sure what happened. 

So... Those are some historic symptoms and happenings. But the frequent lightheadedness, dizziness, and constant thirst have never left my life since I was a teenager, and have received no explanation. In recent times, I have developed gastroparesis (medically confirmed and diagnosed), I've also been diagnosed with chronic migraines, and HSD (Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder, it's like hEDS but with less extensive hypermobile joints). 

Several of my doctors believe that I have POTS. But the thing is... that hasn't been proven. I have been in the habit, for several months now, of recording my blood pressure and heart rate, to try to figure things out. I've done several repetitions of the basic diagnostics. I've laid down for ten minutes, taken my blood pressure and heart rate, then sat up, and taken my blood pressure and heart rate, then again five minutes later, then I've stood and done the same, taking immediate measurements and then waiting five minutes and doing it again. I've done this several times, and sometimes I've done it just going straight from lying down to standing. And every time I've done it, I've seen no significant change in heart rate or blood pressure. My blood pressure almost always goes up a bit as I sit or stand up. Sometimes it stays the same. Others it drops just a little. My heart rate usually stays the same as I rise. Sometimes it goes up by 10-20 points. And my doctors have done these tests in their offices, too, with similar results. Nothing to suggest POTS or OH. 

I have a tilt table test coming up this week, but I doubt it will reveal anything, since so many at-home tests have not. My cardiologist wants to treat me for POTS regardless of what the tests say... Is that even wise? 

The reason my doctors believe I have POTS is my symptoms. I frequently feel lightheaded and dizzy, especially after standing up, or while standing still. Sometimes I start getting tunnel vision. I experience the sensation of a racing heart beat frequently after standing, as well as just ""randomly"" while I'm sitting still for a while. When I measure my heart beat during these times, it's usually 100-110 bpm, which is higher than my resting heart rate should be. The problem is that I don't know what the heart rate was prior to becoming symptomatic, so I don't know if it raised 30 points or not. I do know that my resting heart rate while seated is usually 65-95 bpm. Most often 75-85. I look at it a lot, just to try to understand my baseline. But conveniently.... I'm never aware of what it is prior to an episode happening. 

I also suffer from blood pressure crashes. As with heart rate, I don't actually know what my blood pressure was just prior to crashing. But after it does, it goes down as low as 90/55. My normal baseline blood pressure is 100-110/70-80. I know this because I take it daily. Sometimes multiple times per day. Just as it crashes sometimes, it also elevates at others. It can get as high as 125/85 if I drink coffee, for example.

It's been recorded pretty low at the doctor's office, too. Which may be why they want to treat me regardless of conclusive evidence of POTS. And I have a couple emergency room visits under my belt, where I legitimately thought I was dying, but was told that what happened was a dysautonomia episode, ""vasovagal syncope"" (despite me not having an official dysautonomia diagnosis...). 

I feel conflicted. I want to know what's wrong with me, and while I welcome an explanation... I'm not sure how well I'm going to feel peace without seeing tests that back it up. If anyone has any suggestions on other tests I can ask my doctors about, to help find out what's wrong, or verify POTS, I would appreciate the ideas!",1,1762715568.0,dysautonomia,0,1.0,False

1osrk4h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1osrk4h,Guide to how I refill my Nespresso pods.,"I asked here what brands of coffee you guys use to refill your virtuo pods- and got lots of questions on how I refill mine- so here is what I do!

Step 1: grab your pod and cut around the foil lid. I like one of these little package openers with the razor blade. 

Step 2: dump the contents and give the pod a little rinse and dry.

Step 3: grab your refill equipment. I have tried the reusable lids before but I like the foil stickers best. I use the Nessu brand on Amazon but really any refill kit will work so long as it comes with a pod holder, top part to seal it,  brush, and foil lid sticker.

You’ll also need a ground coffee of your choice. Cafe Bustelo has always been pretty foolproof for me.

Because the Nespresso reads the little lines under the lid for information on how to brew, I’ve found that in general most of the flavored (like vanilla, hazelnut, etc) pods seem to have the right directions to make cafe bustelo come out pretty great. 

Step 4: Place the pod in the holder, fill, tamp down (lightly- you don’t want it super forced in there, but you want it even so you know there isn’t a big divot in the center) but leave a bit of space and don’t overfill. Use the brush to clean up any grounds. 

Step 5: grab one of your little foil stickers. 

Step 6: peel the backing off.

Step 7: place it on the pod as centered as you can. (If it has a little tab, make sure the tab doesn’t overlap with the raised lip of the holder.)

Step 8: grab the top part, put them together, and twist to seal the foil sticker to the pod.

Step 9: remove the pod from the holder and press the foil seal under anywhere that it didn’t stick very well.

Step 10: place in your machine, brew, and enjoy!

Hope this helps someone (especially my fellow Americans trying to save a few bucks right now!)

It was kind of a lucid dream. So at the start of this experience, I am just in an apartment in a city with my bf, we laugh, and then go outside. I see a city square and a train station entrance. We walk around, and when I turn around to look for my bf, he's gone. I'm shouting, and then I see a man with an orange puffer jacket, little hair, a little chubby, around like his maybe 40-50s-ish, looks like a junkie and kind of homeless, and he is asian(my ex is, btw, asian). He looks at me and then starts quickly running towards me in the city, and he's just shouting gibberish. I run around and quickly go into a cafe, where I see an old friend I haven't seen in many years. She says hi, and I ask her to help me hide. I then hide under the coffee table outside of the cafe, and then he finds me, he grabs me, I'm screaming ""let me go"" over and over, he's looking me dead in the eye, speaking gibberish, and tries to choke me. Suddenly, a white car approaches in the middle of the street. And a man in his 20s-30s comes out of his white car, and says, ""you weren't supposed to see that"", shoots the junkie, and then tells me, ""relax, it won't hurt, and you won't remember"", then he shoots me. I wake up in a white room, with no memory of what had just happened. I'm lying in a hospital bed, I think, and two nurses stand over me. the first thing i asked was ""where is my bf"", they say ""we can't tell you that, but you can download your messages and look at those"" and i said no, and then one of the nurses said ""or you can look through your memories"" and one of the nurses is holding a huge ipad, and it has miles of photos, videos and memories of my life. I said ""sure"", and then she told me that when I replay the memory, I won't remember it's a memory. I clicked on a memory of my two younger brothers' summer graduation from 1st grade. When the memory was done, I didn't remember that I was in a memory. After that, I just kept asking where my bf was. Then they told me to wait in a bedroom, and I did not recognise it. I lay in the bed in the bedroom, and the room was dark. I lay there for a bit before the doctors came back and told me that it was fine and that it was just some questions they needed to ask me. i spam asked where am i, and they said, we can't tell you that, and then i said ""is there just something small you can tell me"", then they said ""well let's just say you don't just die when you die, your brain still kind of lives. then i said ""what now?"" then one of the nurses said ""your going to wake up now"", and then i woke up, and started hyperventilating, and crying, and i did not know what to do.

I like reading these and thought it'd be fun to make my own! I am already in the habit of tracking all of my spending with a budgeting app, and it was fun to look at a week of my life in granular detail.

A little about me: I’ve been working in finance in NYC for just over three years since graduating college, and I’m focused on building financial independence. I know I’m in a very lucky position for now, but nothing in life is guaranteed to stay the same forever. I want to make sure I’d be okay even if things changed, so I save and invest aggressively.

Hope people enjoy!

***Section Zero: Context***

**What do money and success mean to you? What are your end goals?**

To me, money means having freedom and security. I see it as a way to build a good life, to have optionality and decrease stress. I think success means being good at what I do, and earning the respect of people whose opinions I value.

In the long term, my goal is to achieve financial independence, hopefully by my late 20s or early 30s. I would like to step back from my current role and switch into something more conducive to building a family. I currently live in Manhattan, but I grew up in the suburbs, and I hope to someday raise kids in that environment. For now, I’m focused on using my time and energy to make that future possible!

**Are you a spender or a saver?**

I’m definitely a saver; this year, I’ve saved about twice as much as I've spent, and I plan to keep this up in the future. I grew up with very frugal parents, and that has had a lot of influence in my money habits. I'm a bit of a minimalist, so I think carefully before making purchases. That said, earning a full-time income has helped me relax a little; I’m more comfortable spending on good food, clothes, and conveniences than I was growing up and at the start of my career.

**If you could go back in time, what's the one piece of financial advice you would give to your past self?**

I’d tell myself to focus on learning as much as possible in college, because it's the time in your life when you're surrounded by brilliant people and can explore any area of interest, and that pays off huge dividends later in life. I’d also tell myself to befriend people who are thoughtful, motivated, and have good judgement, because surrounding yourself with people who share good habits and long-term goals makes a huge difference.

I contribute the max to each account, including through a Mega Backdoor Roth 401(k), which lets me put in an additional \~$25k extra per year. My employer also matches 401(k) contributions up to $10k a year. So for 2025 I was able to contribute close to $60k across all accounts and then have an employer match of an additional $10k.
* **Brokerage:** $735k, invested in the US stock market. I put all leftover income here after expenses and retirement contributions. It's lucky that we've been in a bull market since I graduated college, so my investments have grown a good amount.
* **Checking:** $10k. I keep a bit over one month's expenses here to pay rent and expenses.
* **Savings:** None. I put all leftover money into my brokerage account instead of a savings account.
* **Equity:** None. I rent, and I think I will stay renting as long as I live in the city, as condo/co-op monthly fees are really high.
* **Credit Card Debt:** None. I pay off my credit cards in full every month.
* **Student Loan Debt:** None. I attended a private university and received about most of tuition off in financial aid; my parents paid the remainder from a 529 they saved for me, and also covered dorm costs and meal plans.

I live alone; no significant other.

***Section Two: Income***

**Income Progression:** I’ve been working in finance at the same firm since fall 2022, and I have just over 3 years of work experience. I received a signing bonus when I joined, and my ongoing compensation consists of a base salary plus a performance-based annual bonus (paid the following year).

This is what I actually received each year:

* **2022**: $270k ($175k signing bonus + 4 months of base pay)
* **2023**: $343k ($300k base + 4 months of prorated 2022 bonus)
* **2024**: $475k ($300k base + 2023 bonus)
* **2025**: $600k ($300k base + 2024 bonus)

***Section Three: Expenses***

This year, I'm on track to pay roughly $240k in taxes and medical/dental insurance, to save + invest $240k, and to spend $120k. So about 40% to taxes and insurance, 40% to savings, and 20% to spending.

**Annual Savings Breakdown (\~$240k):**

* **Retirement**: I put the max in to my 401(k), Mega backdoor 401(k), Roth IRA, and HSA each year at the start of the year. This year, these contributions respectively totaled to $23.5k + $25k + $7k + $4.3k = $59.8k.
* **Investment**: Anything remaining from my monthly take home after paying that month's expenses, and all of my annual bonus. Total will be about $180k this year.

**Annual Spending Breakdown (\~$120k)**:

* **Rent**: $54.6k, for a 1 bedroom apartment in Manhattan. This is by far my biggest expense, and I think for me personally it’s worth it to live in a neighborhood I like and to come home every day to a comfortable space.
* **Renter's insurance**: $120. I use Lemonade and keep coverage at the lowest amounts possible, since I don’t own anything valuable that requires additional protection.
* **Electricity and gas**: \~$1.5k, through Con Edison.
* **Wifi and cell phone**: $1k, through Spectrum and AT&T.
* **Fitness**: $1.2k. My work lets me buy gym memberships and workout classes with pre-tax money, so it's roughly 40% discounted.
* **Subscriptions**: $360, for Netflix and Spotify. I still get free access to the New York Times through my old college account.
* **Commuting**: \~$2k. My work lets me contribute to a commuting card with pre-tax dollars.
* **Food and drink**: \~$17k. This includes groceries, food delivery, eating out, and alcohol.
* **Personal Care**: \~$3k. Hair care, makeup, skincare. I splurge a bit on haircuts and treatments about once every three months.
* **Shopping:** \~$8k. Mostly clothing and shoes, with a bit of jewelry and some household items.
* **Vacations:** \~$8k. This covers travel and accommodations. This year, I went on one trip to Europe, a couple domestic trips in the US, and a few weekend getaways.
* **Entertainment and fun:** \~$3k. About half of this went to my ski pass for this year. The rest to other activities with friends.
* **Friends' gifts**: \~$1k. Gifts for birthdays, housewarmings, promotions, and other special occasions.
* **Family**: $20k. I send my parents money each year as thanks for raising me and supporting me through college.

***Section Four: Background***

**Was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? Did you participate in any form of higher education? If yes, how did you pay for it?**

Yes, it was a given that I would go to college; I grew up in a suburb with strong public high schools and most students attended college. My parents were first generation immigrants to the US, and both needed to get graduate degrees to come, so they really value education. They saved for my college costs in a 529 plan, which I'm really grateful for. This allowed me to go to a top college without taking out loans, which has been incredibly valuable.

**Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parents education you about finances?**

My parents were very careful with money, as they grew up poor and worked hard for everything they had. They taught me to develop good spending habits, and I got my habit of tracking my credit card transactions from them.

**What was your first job and why did you get it?**

When I was 17, I got a job teaching younger students at a local after-school program for $9 an hour. I wanted a job for spending money, since my parents didn’t spend much beyond essentials.

**Did you worry about money growing up?**

A little bit. My parents were very tight on spending, which definitely affected my own attitude towards money. I grew up very conscious of every purchase I made.

**Do you worry about money now?**

I don’t worry about money, but I do constantly have it on my mind.

**At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?**

I became financially responsible for myself after I graduated college in at the age of 22. I could rely on my parents if needed; they have assured me that I can always move back home if anything bad happens with my life.

**Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income?**

No passive or inherited income after college. I received support for tuition and living expenses until I graduated, and then I built up my retirement and investment accounts on my own. I do not expect inheritances from my parents.

***Money Diary***

**Sunday**

10:00am: Wake up, scroll through Instagram reels for half an hour, then get out of bed. I keep a carafe of water on my nightstand and drink a glass to help dispel my drowsiness. Wash my face, apply skincare, put my hair into a braid.

11:00am: Attend my Solidcore class (**$20**, subsidized by a fitness work benefit where I use pre-tax dollars).

12:00pm: Leave the studio and pick up a strawberry/mango/banana/coconut milk smoothie (**$8**), and a chicken burrito bowl from Chipotle (**$13**). Eat and shower at home, then head out to meet a friend.

1:30pm: Walk to SoHo to meet my friend for an afternoon of window shopping. We try on some sweaters at Sezane, but don't end up buying anything. I'm the type to mull over potential purchases for a while before buying, so I just take some mirror selfies to look back on later. We then go to a street with fragrance shops, and try samples of scented soaps at Aesop, perfumes at Le Labo, and candles at Diptyque. Still don't buy anything.

3:30pm: Take the train (**$2** for subsidized swipe) to my friend's place and meet her roommate and two other friends for an afternoon of card games. We play Bridge for a couple hours.

5:30pm: We decide to cook dinner as a group and head out to a nearby grocery store to pick up ingredients. We buy: 2 lb of ribeye steak, 1 box of Campanelle pasta, 1 tube of tomato paste, 1 pint of heavy cream, 2 shallots, 2 bags of spinach leaves, and 1 clove of garlic (**$18** for my 1/4 portion). My friends already have oil, salt, red pepper flakes, black pepper, and parmesan at their home. We make a yummy dinner of steak with tomato cream pasta and garlic spinach.

8:30pm: Leave my friend's place and train home (**$2**). At home; I take an everything shower to reset for the upcoming week: detox shampoo, shave, leave in conditioner, skincare.

10:15pm: Scroll Instagram reels on my phone. I previously set a screen time limit for Instagram of 1 hour, and I hit this fast after already using up the allotted time in the morning.

11:00pm: Lights out.

Daily total: **$63**

**Monday**

7:15am: Wake up and listen to a morning news podcast as I get ready for work. Hear about what's happening around the world and NYC, and what's new in financial markets. Get dressed, skincare, makeup, hair styling, jewelry, perfume, and I'm out the door.

7:45am: Train to work, read the morning news briefing on the NYT (**$2** for subsidized train swipe; these use pre-tax dollars).

8:15am: Arrive at work, pour myself an iced latte and make myself a fruit bowl with strawberries and blackberries and honeydew. All food and drinks are provided by my firm, although occasionally I order food delivery for lunch.

11:45am: Get a plate of pasta, chicken schnitzel, and salad for lunch (provided by work). I usually try to eat light lunches, as I succumb easily to food coma, but the spread looked too good, so today I just have a bit of trouble focusing for about half an hour.

5:45pm: Leave the office. Take a train (**$2**) home to drop off my work bag, then walk to a nearby grocery store to pick up food to make dinner for the week. I'm the type to happily eat the same meal multiple days in a row if it's something I really like, and I like to use up all ingredients in one week before they go bad. I buy: 2 lb pork spare ribs, 1 knob of ginger, 3 Russet potatoes, 3 carrots, 1 onion, and 1 bunch of green onions (**$21**).

6:45pm: At home, I meal prep by splitting up the pork spare ribs into 3 portions; putting 2 into individual zip loc bags, and leaving 1 out for dinner. I place the ribs into a pot and just cover with water, then turn on the heat. While that comes to a boil, I split the white roots of the green onions off from the tips, and chop the green tips for garnish, and split the other vegetables into 3 meal portions as well. I add the ginger to the water, some aromatics I already had at home (star anise, peppercorns), then prepare half a cup of white rice in a rice cooker. Then I add a potato, a carrot, a third of an onion for the flavor, and let the soup boil on low heat.

7:30pm: Shower and skincare while the rice cooks and the pork rib soup simmers. Lie in bed and catch up on texts with friends while letting myself dry out.

8:15pm: Eat the rice and broth and pork and potatoes and carrots. Wash my bowl, pots, and cooking utensils.

9:15pm: Wash my face again and change into pjs. Make my way through a yoga and stretching routine in my living room.

10:00pm: Usual nightly routine of scrolling on Instagram for an hour.

11:00pm: Lights out.

Daily total: **$25**

7:15am: Wake, listen to the news, get ready. Train to work (**$2**).

8:15am: Drink an iced latte and eat a fruit bowl. Work.

11:30am: Make myself a salad for lunch. I'm trying to stick to eating light lunches today to maintain a clear head in the afternoon.

5:45pm: Wrap up and head out (**$2** for train swipe). Stop by a grocery store on my way home and pick up a bag of a dozen white peaches (**$16**). I'm pleasantly surprised that these are in stock, since it's well past summer. I'm kind of obsessed with fruit, especially peaches, which are unfortunately rare in this season, so I try to get as much as I can when they're available. Walk home.

6:30pm: Cook the same pork rib soup and white rice dinner. It takes me a bit less time today to get everything boiling, as I split everything up into manageable portions yesterday.

7:00pm: Put a load of clothing into the washing machine, then shower and skincare. Blow dry hair.

7:45pm: Eat dinner, do the dishes. Switch clothes to the dryer. Change into pjs.

8:45pm: Make myself a cup of chamomile tea (I bought this tea mix a month ago to drink before bed as it's caffeine free) and eat a white peach as dessert. Go through some stretches on my yoga mat. Scroll Instagram and hit my one hour limit. Take clothes out of dryer and sort them into my closet.

10:00pm: Start season 3 of Bridgerton; I really liked the first 2 seasons and the prequel season with Queen Charlotte, and I am just getting around the catching up on the show. Watch an episode.

11:00pm: In bed, lights out.

Daily total: **$20**

**Wednesday**

7:15am: Morning routine, train to work (**$2**). I've been listening to the songs from *The Life of a Showgirl* on repeat for the past month - I love Taylor Swift; she has been my favorite artist for as long as I can remember.

8:15am: Drink my coffee, eat my fruit. Also pick up an apple danish pastry from my office kitchen. Work.

11:30am: Order a group food delivery with some coworkers: beef noodle soup with bok choy, (**$28** for my part). Delicious, but the bowl is quite big; I save some leftovers. Slight food coma, which I fight with another latte.

5:45pm: Finish working and change into workout clothes, then leave the office (**$2** for train swipe). I arrive a bit early to my Solidcore class (**$20**).

7:30pm: It's dark by the time I leave the studio, which I really dislike. I miss summer when we had more hours of natural light.

8:00pm: Arrive home and eat my leftover noodle bowl from lunch as dinner. Eat two white peaches as dessert.

8:45pm: Shower, skincare, change into pjs. Lie in bed on Instagram for an hour. Watch another episode of Bridgerton.

8:15am: Have my coffee and fruit, and make myself a toasted bagel with smoked salmon and cream cheese, very yum. Work.

11:30am: Make myself a sandwich for lunch; I add all types of meat available: roast beef, turkey, and ham. There's heirloom tomatoes out today, which is a special treat, and I add a generous amount of these slices.

5:45pm: Leave work and train home (**$2**).

6:15pm: Arrive home and cook the remaining ingredients for pork rib soup and rice for dinner. Shower while the soup simmers, then eat, and clean up.

7:45pm: Call my family and catch up with them.

8:15pm: Watch another 2 episodes of Bridgerton; taking breaks to eat two more peaches and make myself multiple cups of chamomile tea. Watching comfort TV shows at home is definitely one of my top ways to spend weekday evenings.

11:00pm: Wash my face and redo skincare, then go to bed.

Daily total: **$4**.

**Friday**

7:15am: Wake up, drink water, morning routine, train to work (**$2**).

8:30am: Eat another apple Danish with my iced latte and fruit. Work.

11:30am: Eat a lunch of basmati rice and chicken tikka, provided by the catering at my firm.

5:45pm: Finish work and take the train (**$2**) to meet my friends in Ktown for dinner. The four of us order all of my favorite hits: beef tartare with Korean pear and quail egg, seafood pancake, japchae (glass noodles), kimchi stew, steamed egg, and package of skirt steak, marinated short ribs, and pork belly. We also order multiple carafes of makgeolli (Korean rice wine). After tax + tip, my portion comes out to **$142**, which is 1/4 of the total bill.

8:30pm: Train (**$2**) downtown to a cocktail bar. Having drinks with my friends and hearing about their lives is definitely one of my favorite activities. We order 3 rounds of drinks and try each others, so I end up trying 12 different drinks, which is most of the menu. I'm partial to gin and whiskey based cocktails, but the mixology here is well done on all of the drinks (**$83** for my portion after tax + tip).

12:30pm: Walk to a nearby cafe for brunch by myself. Order a roll with fried egg, bacon, pickled onions, lettuce, tomato, and garlic aioli. Also add a hot cappuccino and a glass of orange juice. Total after tax + tip (**$34**).

1:30pm: I'm attending my friend's birthday party later in the afternoon at the apartment she shares with her boyfriend. I stop by Sephora to pick up a gift; I settle on a Tatcha moisturizer (**$78**). I often default to nice skincare for presents, because it's typically a thing most of my friends want, and would use, but wouldn't buy for themselves.

2:00pm: My friend's boyfriend is providing birthday cake, but he also said guests were welcome to bring desserts to share. I buy pastries from a French bakery (**$25**).

3:00pm: Train to their apartment (**$2**).

3:30pm: Arrive and say hi to everyone. Their apartment is sunlit and very cozy. I nibble on charcuterie and veggies and chat with everyone, including a few new people. I have a couple glasses of Riesling.

5:00pm: Cake time. My friend's boyfriend brings out a gorgeous chocolate and raspberry cake; we sing happy birthday and take photos. I eat a slice and a couple of the pastries I brought. We play some card games.

6:45pm: A small group wants to go get dinner nearby. I am still pretty full from the food and decide to skip joining. Say bye to everyone, hug my friend happy birthday again, and leave.

7:00pm: Train home (**$2**). It’s chilly and darker now than I expect for early November, which I dislike every fall.

7:30pm: Shower, skincare, change into pjs. I make myself a cup of chamomile tea and eat a peach.

8:30pm: Lie on my couch and watch another two episodes of Bridgerton.

10:30pm: Brush teeth, stretch out.

11:00pm: Lights out.

**Reflection:**

This week was relatively typical for me in terms of spending. I spent a good amount on food and drink, but didn't spend on personal care, shopping, or vacations. Most of my weeks look similar to this, with occasional spikes for the more expensive weeks with pricier purchases and activities.

My work days are not particularly exciting or dramatic, and I am a bit of a homebody. I really like my friends and enjoy spending time with them, but I am also introverted and like to get a lot of rest at home, especially during the work week.

1osrei3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1osrei3,"Thank you everyone for helping me pick my outfit for my first metal show last night! As promised, here's some pics and how it went!","IT WAS AMAZING!!!

Turns out the venue was a basement venue which my friend had never been to one before despite having gone to 70+ shows but everyone was so kind!!

There was a fire performance between bands which I got video of, I learned what two stepping is, bought my first ever band shirt (End of The line Chicago), and I witnessed my first mosh pit!! People were also checking to make sure I was safe behind them wherever the moshing started which was really sweet.

I got a picture with the lead singer of Mantra of Morta who is so sweet!! The lead from Seventh Crown STAPLED HIMSELF ON STAGE THEN WIPED THE BLOOD ON HIS FACE AHHHHH!!!! 

I talked to his wife at the merch table before the show and she was so kind! I told her how this was my very first show of any kind which apparently stuck with her haha

After the show I was driving us home which would take until almost 2am so I decided to pull into a gas station for a coffee and who pulled up right after and the only other car?? THE BAND!!!

I got out, woke my sleeping friend and said, ""Hey, we were just at your show!!"" They were all super excited and nice, I said how it was my very first music event ever and his wife goes, ""SEE I TOLD YOU!!!"" 

They asked me how it was and I said I had a great time and their set freaked me out a little but in a good way! They told me about some of the other things they do but didn't have room for at the venue and I told them my friend educated me before hand and I'll just have to come to another show to see it since I didn't this time.

While this whole conversation is happening and I'm still grabbing my wallet from my car one of the other bandmates tries the door to the gas station which it turns out was closed despite the sign being open so he all got back in our cars and went on our way. 

I still needed a coffee so I pulled into the next gas station on my route and what do you know but there they are!! I popped out of my car and said ""Well hello again!"" And they were all so nice, it was great! I left them alone when we all went inside because of course it's been a long night and I told them to have a nice night as I was heading out, they came out as I was getting ready to pull out and all waved!

We like to let you guys know any time something changes on this sub. Some of the rules have been broadened to better account for the following types of posts:

Low effort/unengaging posts:

Even if a post follows the rules, it may be removed to preserve content density on the sub. We are not here to make Reddit money by forcing you to scroll through ads and uninteresting posts. If you post a picture of your morning coffee and get zero comments it may be removed in several hours. If you post a pic of your coffee and it generates conversation and community engagement the post is kept. If you post and then ignore all the comments it may also be removed. 

Inflammatory posts and comments:

Some posts or comments may be removed if they follow the rules but are generating too many moderation events. Differing views are fine provided they can be shared in a noninflammatory manner and do not promote hate or infringe on human rights. 

AI posts…or are they?

We appreciate when you report AI or bot content. We are not able to look into every account that posts so it really helps when you guys bring this to our attention. Occasionally we get it wrong and remove a human post. Send us a message and we can put it back up if that happens.

So, me and my bestfriend got into two consecutive arguments, and we didn’t talk for 6 weeks after the second one. During that second fight, she told me I wasn’t her best friend anymore because she felt uncomfortable after the first fight (which I don’t blame her for, I was stupid for ever starting it).

Eventually, I was sick of not talking and I sent a message asking to talk things out, to my surprise, she actually said that she’d be down to talk and that she was never mad with me, but instead thought I was mad at her. We met up the next day, talked it out, and started talking like normal again. (She had also mentioned how she wasn’t uncomfortable anymore at all, and that we are “totally chill now”) She even started telling me some personal stuff that happened while we weren’t talking. I think she missed me even if she didn’t show it?

The next two days were also well; we hung out, drove around, and helped her with an assignment, she even offered to buy coffee as a thank you (I also gave her this bowl set I bought before we fought, I was finally able to give it to her after we were on good terms. She loved it a lot :>)

But after that, she stopped talking to me like she used to. She only responds if I say hi first, avoids eye contact sometimes, and gives short replies. I sometimes catch her looking at me, but she just stares blankly.

It’s been like this for two weeks, and she’s definitely found some better friends in the process. I was at a party that she was also at and the only thing she said to me was “why aren’t you eating?” And then walked away to laugh with her other friends :(((

Her gf, who I am good friends with (I actually introduced them and wingmaned so hard), told me that “(name) said you were chill now”?? So am I chill or not??

I genuinely have no idea what’s going on, is this normal after reconciliation? Should I keep trying, or is it over for me?",1,1762713964.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

I hope you’re having a cozy, calm, or at least slightly sweet kind of day. I’m reaching out with an open heart, looking for a cuddle buddy and maybe a new friend here in the Netherlands. ideally near Amsterdam or within 30 mins commuting!

A little about me:

• I'm 35 years old guy working as an executive and happily calling Amsterdam home for over 3 years now.
• I live alone, take care of myself, and try to stay fit, but also never say no to dessert.
• I’d be happy to host or come to you, whatever makes you feel safe and comfortable.
• I love being outside, especially in the summer… picnics, strolls, a lazy lunch on a sunny terrace… simple things, really.
• Traveling is a big part of my life and dream. I’d love to see the whole world, one new place (and snack) at a time.
• I’m a good listener. My friends often say I make them feel calm and heard. You’ll get lots of warm, respectful hugs and cozy company if that’s what you need 🤗
• Cleanliness and kindness go hand in hand for me. I value both deeply.
• I'm 183 cm tall, 80 kg, have broad shoulders, little muscular, tanned skin, black hair, brown eyes.

What I’m looking for:

Someone to share gentle and genuine connection with. Whether that’s cuddling up on the couch, sharing a quiet moment over coffee, or just chatting about our days.

I’m also open to making new friends… movie nights, cooking together, mini-adventures nearby… whatever brings joy without pressure.

And of course, if you’d prefer to meet in a public space first, that’s absolutely fine. Your comfort always comes first.

So if you’re someone who values kindness, closeness, and maybe the occasional silly laugh. I’d really love to hear from you. 💛

Let’s make a little space in this busy world for warmth and connection.

i'm based in northern europe, and looking for a cook system below the 175 euro range, preferably around the 100 euro range, with a focus on ease of use and small volume.

i've currently got a trangia 25, with both an alcohol and gas stove, which is very useful for cooking proper meals, however, when on trips where i end up just boiling water for dehydrated meals and tea/coffee/cocoa, lugging around the volume and complexity of a trangia setup is a pain point.

i don't have the opportunity to camp out often, especially because of my bandwidth due to various disabilities, and i figure anything reducing the friction (fitting the volume of a trangia, packing the trangia in/out, keeping various parts clean) of getting out there and enjoying nature is something worth investing in !

so far:

i've been eyeing a msr pocket rocket 2 (\~€43) and at some point an evernew titanium alcohol stove stand (\~€20)

for the pots, either a 750ml (\~€40) or 1100ml (\~€57) toaks pot w/ bail handles. i favor the 1100ml due to being able to fit a 230g canister and being able to have 700-800ml of water without worrying about the water boiling out of the pot (the brand of dehydrated meals i have locally specify \~700ml, but some of them benefit from \~800ml)

i'm mostly convinced, but there's still alternatives like the soto windmaster burner and different pots, so i'm looking for second opinions on the topic - what works best for you? :-)

My wife recently got upset and told me she is not my maid when I asked her to do my laundry and wash my dishes.

She said her love language is touch, and she can't function without it.

  
The issue is that when she offered for me and my kids to move into her house, we agreed that I would bring in the income, and she would take care of the house. I made a budget, and she agreed to it (once we moved in, there was about $500 a month worth of expenses she had that she did not mention, but after some persistence I was able to get her to reduce that to $300 - side note, due to burn-out I told her I would no longer be footing those bills).

My kids are teenagers, and one is off to college next year. They do chores weekly (floors and bathrooms), do all of their own laundry (clothing and bedding), and help out around the house when asked. 

I do my own laundry, kitchen laundry and bathroom laundry, make my own breakfast and lunch for work, (plus deal with the kids' school stuff, kids' appointments etc). I also do the grocery shopping. When we first moved in together, I helped out a lot more by doing the dishes before I left for work, cooking on weekends, and doing yard work. 

She is an amazing cook, and makes the kids breakfast, lunch and dinner, and takes them to their appointments/games etc. I'm not sure what has happened but over the last year, the lunches for the kids are just thrown together, and my youngest quietly told me the other day that she is hungry at school.

She does the dishes (but refuses to wash my work thermos and coffee mug: if it does not go in the dishwasher or if I used it, she won't wash it).

Over the last 18 months I have had to switch jobs and take any overtime that I can get because my wife was not sticking to the budget, and refused to participate in it, which meant overspending was happening and it was eating into our emergency fund and savings (all of which was the money I brought into the relationship). 

We upgraded some of the kids extracurricular gear - I asked her to sell the old stuff, to help pay down the new stuff. Well, that was 4 months ago, and it still is sitting in the garage. 

  
She got upset at me for leaving all of my clean clothes in the laundry room, but I am so tired and stressed from money issues and not being able to save for the kids education or our retirement, that I kind of snapped, and told her that if she isn't going to keep the house clean (she doesn't clean any part of the house unless I snap. She dusted once in 18 months, and I had to defrost the freezer because she wouldn't do it) or help me save money then she should at least do my laundry and my dishes so that I could focus more on work. 

To this she said that she is not my maid, and that she cannot function without love and affection. 

AITA? I am so burnt out I cannot tell anymore.  I swear, it feels like when I do put effort into showing her affection, things still don't get done that need to get done. 

And yes, we went to counselling, but my wife refused to participate in writing a ""I-do-you-do"" list. Which was supposed to help us get on the same page. I also asked my wife to look at the budget and see if there are areas that we can cut back so that we can hire a housekeeper or gardener, or maybe she could go to work part-time. She says she can't work due to back pain, and that the budget was my project, not hers. ",0,1762713556.0,AITAH,10,0.4,False

1osqvdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1osqvdh/complicated_situation_with_my_flatmate/,Complicated situation with my flatmate,"This is a similar post to one that I saw was posted last week, but feel like I need personal advice relevant to my scenario.

I have a flatmate that is also on the same course as me at uni. We've been friends for over 3 years, but have only lived together just over a year. The course is intense, so we are typically in uni everyday mostly 9am-4pm and since we live together, we usually just go home and cook our dinner. We do have 3 other flatmates - 1 that is our close friend and 2 others that we aren't close with. She decided not to join any societies at the start of uni as she felt nothing suited her. I personally did and met a lot of people as a result.

I didn't necessarily introduce her purposefully to my friends, but she has ended up meeting a lot of them just from being with me when bumping into them on campus or around town. After meeting them, she would subsequently approach them for conversations if she saw them by herself, which is how she ended up getting closer to them. She is a very outgoing person and easily liked which also contributes (she's said before that she knows it's a front).

I have just found it a bit overwhelming that she keeps befriending my newer friends. I like to have a safe haven outside of the flat because we spend so much time together between living together and going to uni together. She often has depressive episodes, which I always support her through, but I do find that sometimes it can really affect my own mental health and that I need a bit of a break.

She is often very clingy and constantly wants to make plans for the evenings; if she spends too much time by herself, she gets depressed and overthinks. This means I end up not having very much time to myself, which completely goes against my usual style as I am quite happy in my own company and like to have chilled evenings in. Despite having another flatmate that we are close with, I feel that it's me that she mostly relies on and talks about her feelings to and it is only *my* friends that she has tried to befriend. I did briefly bring up my feelings to the other flatmate and she agreed and understood my situation, but also said she didn't think our friend was emotionally stable enough to deal with it if I brought it up. It could potentially ruin our friendship as I think she would take it very personally and would never leave it go (in terms of that she would feel like she's walking on eggshells around me).

I found my escape from the flat enironment in meeting up with my friends from societies for a coffee or a meal every so often. However, she has started making a particular effort to befriend my friends more recently, going as far as to bake for them multiple times, making extraordinary gestures to befriend them and personally messaging them to hang out. There is only 1 friend that she has made off her own back in the past year and all she does is complain about that person and how much she dislikes her. Aside from that, every other friend that she's gotten closer to is someone that she met through me one way or another. I just find it a bit odd that she's making these grand gestures for people she barely knows that are coincidently my close friends.

I feel conflicted about it as I know I don't own people and that for her mental health it is a good thing. I suspect her efforts are somewhat to do with her trying to make herself feel better through having people like her (obviously I'm not an expert) and also, her just trying to keep busy. I completely understand her feelings if that's the case. But I also feel frustrated because my ""safe havens"" of friends, that I feel I need for my own mental health, are slipping away.

At this point, I don't have a single friend outside of the flat that she hasn't tried to befriend (at uni). I was enjoying an environment that wasn't connected to her since like I said, she is part of nearly every other aspect of my life and we spend so much time together. I don't go to uni close to home, so spending time with family / home friends is not that feasible during term. If she asks to do something in the evenings (which is nearly every evening) and I say I don't feel up to it (so that I can have some alone time), she will then reach out to my friends so that she isn't alone. She spent 2 evenings by herself last week and then had a breakdown to me on the third day saying she felt alone and sad. She has very little self worth and also has an ED which also contribute as the smallest thing can send her into a self-hate spiral. I feel so awful that she feels so down and that she struggles being alone, but I'm finding it so draining that it gets me down too. I feel so guilty feeling like this when I know she can't control her feelings. I have suggested therapy to her, but she refuses and says it'll be a waste of time.

I feel that now I don't have a social environment that's just for myself because it's all become intertwined with her. It almost feels somewhat like I'm losing my autonomy because I now barely do anything where she is not involved. The only thing that I do get to do socially by myself is sport twice a week, but I find that it's not the best opportunity to chat and get to spend quality time with other people.

I don't feel that I can bring it up to her because I'm fully aware that I can't dictate friendships and I also worry it might cause her to spiral into a depressive episode, but I feel like if it continues on as it is then my own mental health will really suffer as a result (if not already). I just don't really know what to do.",1,1762713225.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

1osqtl6,https://i.redd.it/qo0l3pcwy90g1.png,Mr. Wellers and the Piano (Parts 1 & 2),"# Movement 1: Overture

I hadn’t touched a piano since Claire died six years ago.

She taught me everything. How to read sheet music. Where to loosen tension and where to hold it. How posture shapes sound and how patience shapes art. She played with this delicate, deliberate grace. It was like her fingers didn’t just press the keys, but also understood them. Music wasn’t just something she made, it was something she was.

I thought we would live a good life. Marriage, a house, maybe kids. We’d grow old together, hands still brushing as we played duets on some dusty upright in our living room.

But then came the diagnosis: brain cancer. Terminal. Sudden. She faded quickly. Her eyes lost their spark, her fingers their control. The music left her long before she left me.

Her final days were in a hospital bed, where tubes hummed in place of melodies. Just before the end, she made me promise I’d keep playing. For her. I gave her my word as I held her hand and felt her pulse disappear beneath my fingertips.

But I couldn’t do it. Every note sounded like her ghost.

I didn’t sell the piano. That would’ve been like discarding her soul. I just covered it, a white sheet draped over it like a shroud. It sat in silence, mourning with me.

Then, one morning, I found a letter on my kitchen table.

I didn’t hear anyone come in. Didn’t see the door move. At first, I thought nothing of it. But the envelope was thick and yellowed, like parchment pried from a tomb. My full name, *Liam Goodpray*, was written in fine, looping cursive. No stamp. No return address.

The first thing I noticed as I picked it up was the smell.

I must’ve been imagining it. How could I not be? It carried a faint trace of Claire’s favorite perfume. Lavender. Soft, calming. But there was something else beneath it now, something colder, sharper. Metallic, like old blood or a rusted key.

Maybe it was just the scent of memory decaying. Maybe it was grief finally finding new ways to haunt me.

I sat down at the table and turned the envelope over in my hands. The paper felt thick, almost damp, like it had been waiting somewhere dark for a very long time. My fingers hesitated at the flap. For a moment, I was afraid to open it, afraid of what it might say.

But curiosity is a quiet kind of hunger. And it always wins.

I broke the seal. Inside was a single sheet, folded twice. The handwriting matched the envelope: elegant, flowing script that looked carved more than written. Each letter precise. Familiar.

I began to read.

“To Mr. Liam Goodpray,

You are cordially invited to perform at the Bellmare Concert Hall, located in our old town of Dorset Hollow. One night, one recital.

Compensation: Solace

Mr. Wellers awaits you.”

That was all it said.

No instructions, no contact information. Just the offer—signed by a name I’d never heard before—and a faded, brittle map inked on the back. No phone number. No email. Just parchment and mystery.

I actually laughed out loud. *Solace?* What kind of payment is that?

But the laugh didn’t last long.

Something stirred in my memory, an old rumor about Dorset Hollow. A fire. Long ago. The kind of story whispered by locals too tired to care and too afraid to dig. They said the town was swallowed whole by flames no one could stop. Just gone. Vanished under smoke and ash.

No one ever talked about what came after. Whether it was rebuilt or left behind like a bad dream. Over time, it just faded from maps and minds. A ghost of a town, that no one cared about anymore. And now, here I was, standing in my kitchen, holding a letter summoning me back to it.

I won’t lie, it piqued my curiosity. But I didn’t make any decisions. Not then. I just folded the letter back up, placed it gently on the table where I’d found it, and walked away.

I dreamed of Claire that night. She was onstage, but not dressed for it. She wasn't in the blue dress she used to wear to her performances. She sat there barefoot in black jeans and a faded Nirvana shirt. Her black hair fell to her shoulders. And her eyes, those deep blue eyes. The kind you look into and can never see the bottom.

She was playing something I didn’t recognize. It was beautiful, yet impossible, like trying to comprehend the full scale of the universe. The music sounded like the concept of grief. Pure, unadulterated grief. Grief so deep it was sacred.

I stood there, unable to move, watching her hands glide over the keys like they still remembered everything this world had taken from her.

She simply looked at me and said, “Don’t go.” No fear or worry, just pleading.

I woke up shaking.

And there, on my nightstand, was the letter.

I went through my morning routine on autopilot. Coffee. Cold water to the face. Clothes. Keys.

Then I got in the car.

After the dream, after Claire’s voice in my head, I needed to see Dorset Hollow. I told myself I wasn’t going to perform. I wasn’t even going to touch its piano. I just wanted to *see* it. That’s what I told myself. Over, and over, and over again.

The drive took five hours. Back roads the whole way. Twisting ribbons of cracked asphalt, no signs, no traffic. Halfway there, the GPS gave out entirely. The screen just froze on a blank patch of nowhere. So I used the map from the back of the letter. It was nearly illegible, faded lines like veins on old skin, as if it was trying to vanish with time. Like it *didn’t want* to be followed. But I traced the path anyway.

The trees thickened as I drove deeper in. The road narrowed to a breath. The usual sounds of the forest—birds, wind, insects—began to fade, one by one, until there was only the hum of my engine. Even that started to feel distant, like it was being swallowed by the air around me. The further I drove, the more the light changed. The sky turned gray, like the world was slowly being drained of hue.

Then I saw the sign. A wooden plaque, rotted at the edges, carved in an old-fashioned serif:

**“Dorset Hollow: A Place for Quiet Reflection.”**

The town looked preserved, paused, as if time had decided to stop flowing here and never started again. It looked like someone had tried to restore it, faithfully and lovingly, back to what it might have been decades ago. Maybe the fire was real. Maybe they rebuilt it, but if they did, they rebuilt it too well.

The buildings stood upright and well-kept, their paint untouched by weather or age. But there was something hollow in their stance, like they were facades of real places.

The windows were especially strange. Clear as crystal, but dim, like they were reflecting moonlight instead of basking in the afternoon sun. I could see my car clock said 1:13 p.m., but everything around me felt like dusk.

The most intriguing thing, however, was that the streets were empty. I didn't see a single soul in sight.

And I don't know how to explain it, but I knew people were there. I could feel them, just out of view. Just around the corner, watching without watching.

Then I saw the diner.

Simple. Modest. It sat on the corner like a prop from an old TV show. Its neon sign buzzed softly, the “N” flickering every few seconds.

**DIN(N)ER.**  
Clever.

I hadn’t eaten all day, and despite the strangeness of it all, the place felt… comforting. Familiar, even. Like a memory from someone else’s life.

I pulled in.

The interior was straight out of 1965: black-and-white checkered floors, red vinyl booths, chrome fixtures that caught the dim light like they were polished just minutes ago. An old jukebox stood in the corner, humming faintly, waiting for coins. The whole diner smelled like hot coffee, bacon grease, and a hint of lemon floor polish.

Three customers were seated: an older couple in the corner booth, and a man about my age sitting alone by the window.

All three looked at me when I walked in, like they’d been expecting me.

I slid into an empty booth, the red vinyl squeaking under me. A moment later, the waitress approached. Her hair was pulled into a tight ponytail, not a strand out of place. Her lipstick was too red for a town this faded, like something from a poster instead of a person. She smiled, but it didn’t reach her eyes. They looked hollow, like the windows outside. Clear, but distant.

“You headed to the concert hall?” she asked, handing me a menu.

“How’d you know?” I asked, more unsettled than curious.

She shrugged and glanced off toward some vague direction, “Not many folks come by here unless they’ve been invited.”

Alright, that made sense. I gave her my order, just coffee and something simple, but she didn’t write anything down.

A few minutes later, she brought over a feast fit for kings. Black coffee, scrambled eggs, perfectly-buttered toast, and a side of crispy bacon. It smelled like memory.

And when I took a bite, it tasted like childhood. Sunday mornings, cartoons humming from another room, someone humming a tune you forgot the name of. Warm. Familiar. A little *too* perfect.

Across the diner, the young man in the window booth looked up.

“You play?” he asked.

I paused, unsure if I wanted to answer.

“Used to,” I said finally.

He nodded, slow and solemn, like that was the only answer anyone ever gave.

“That’s good enough for Bellmare.”

I offered a weak smile. “You been?”

But he didn’t answer. Just lowered his gaze and stared back down at his food, suddenly uninterested.

I reached for my wallet, but before I could pull it out, the waitress was already there, hand out like a gentle warning.

“It’s covered,” she said.

“By who?”

She gave a small shrug. “Mr. Wellers. He takes care of his guests.”

“Nice guy,” I said, more to myself than to her, and left a five on the table anyway.

Bellmare Hall stood at the very edge of town, where the sidewalk gave way to dirt, and the dirt turned to forest.

It didn’t fit Dorset Hollow. Not even close. Where the town was quaint, Bellmare was monumental. Where the streets were quiet, Bellmare was imposing.

The structure was carved from pale stone streaked with veins of deep gray, like smoke frozen in marble. The surface was smooth in places and weathered in others, as if time had tried, and failed, to erode it.

Vines clung to the walls like veins on skin, winding up the facade toward tall iron lanterns that still flickered with open flame. The air smelled faintly of wax and old wood.

But it was the details that really impressed me.

Engraved into the walls and columns were figures, human figures, draped in flowing robes like Roman statues. Each of them were frozen in acts of music. Some held violins, others cellos or flutes, their hands positioned mid-note. Their faces were serene, solemn, or ecstatic. Captured expressions of people who had long since played their final piece. Along the trim and archways were the likenesses of instruments—violins, grand pianos, harps, even unfamiliar, archaic ones—woven into the architecture like sacred symbols.

The great doors stood twelve feet tall, made of dark-stained wood reinforced with iron bands, a knocker shaped like a curled treble clef hanging in the center.

It stood like a grand cathedral to music: solemn, sacred, and built not to echo prayers, but to cradle every note and melody like a holy relic. Every inch of the place radiated the feeling that something important had happened here, or was perhaps about to.

I wouldn't have known whether I was meant to walk in, or wait to be summoned.

But a man stood waiting on the stairs. He was unnaturally tall. Scarily thin. He wore a charcoal-gray suit that clung to him like it had been sewn on in another century. A black top hat perched neatly over a few stubborn tufts of white hair, as if it was clinging to his scalp out of habit more than life.

His skin was paper-white, thin enough to see faint blue veins beneath the surface. His eyes were glazed and colorless, like glass that had forgotten what it used to reflect. It looked like today was his funeral, and he’d forgotten to attend.

“Mr. Goodpray,” he said, voice smooth with a Southern drawl, low and slow. “Mr. Wellers welcomes you.”

His smile was polite. Inviting. Practiced.

“You’re Mr. Wellers?” I asked.

He nodded once, sharp and controlled. “Some call Wellers that.”

“Is that what *you* call you?”

He tilted his head slightly, letting a thin smirk crease one side of his mouth, like my question was an inside joke. “Mr. Wellers prefers to keep things proper.”

That didn’t answer anything. But I let it go.

“Wellers is glad you chose to perform in our humble town,” he said, almost offhandedly, as if we were discussing the weather.

I stopped walking.

“I didn’t say I came to perform,” I said, my eyes fixed on his. “I came to *look*. To see the hall. That’s it.”

Mr. Wellers turned back to face me fully, hands clasped gently in front of him. He tilted his head in a gesture that was either curiosity or condescension, it was hard to tell.

“No one ever says they came to perform,” he replied smoothly. “Not at first. They say they come to look. To remember. To pass through.”

“I mean it,” I said. “I haven’t touched a piano in six years.”

“Yes,” he said softly. “Wellers knows.”

That answer froze the words in my throat.

He smiled again.

“But something brought you here, didn’t it?” he continued. “Something more than curiosity. Grief, perhaps. Or hope. Or maybe... maybe you’re just looking for something to make the silence bearable again.”

“I didn’t agree to anything,” I said, slower now.

“But you came,” he replied, his voice dipped in certainty. “And *that*, Mr. Goodpray, means you’ve already begun to agree. The decision always starts with the arrival. Everything after that is just the song playing itself out.”

I stared at him, heart heavier than I wanted to admit.

He took a single step toward the doors and placed one long, pale hand on the iron handle.

“Shall we?”

I stepped forward into the building, and nearly stopped in my tracks.

The interior was breathtaking.

The lobby soared high above me. Crystal chandeliers dangled from the vaulted ceiling like constellations, scattering fractured light across the room like falling stars. The red velvet carpet beneath my feet was so thick, so plush, it swallowed my footsteps. Even the sound of my breath seemed to vanish into it.

The walls were paneled in dark, polished wood, every inch lacquered to a mirror sheen. They reflected the chandeliers too well, too brightly. Almost unnaturally so. It hurt to look at them for too long, like the reflections weren’t bouncing back light, but echoing something deeper.

But that was only the beginning.

Because then… we stepped into the concert hall.

And the world changed.

It was massive. Far larger than the exterior of the building could possibly allow. The space seemed to stretch endlessly upward and outward. A grand cathedral of music carved out of dream and impossibility. Tiered balconies climbed the walls like layers of an ancient colosseum. Rows upon rows of empty seats spread out before me in perfect symmetry, all facing the stage with quiet reverence.

And at the center of that stage, alone and waiting, was the piano.

It was a full grand. Black lacquered. It gleamed like obsidian under the soft glow of the footlights. It sat there like the crown jewel of Dorset Hollow. Untouched, yet eternal. As if it had been waiting not just for *someone* to play it, but for *me*, specifically.

But, other than that, something about it felt familiar. The shape. The shine. The stillness. It wrapped around me like a memory I hadn’t made yet. Comforting, and yet deeply wrong. It stirred something in me I couldn’t name. A kind of ache. A quiet, terrible longing.

The hairs on my arms stood on end. My heart skipped a beat. And still, without thinking, I stepped toward it. Slowly.

“She’s a piece of beauty,” Wellers said behind me. “Specially made for this hall.”

I nodded slowly, still watching the piano. “She looks…” I paused, trying to find the right word. “Hungry.”

He let out a soft chuckle, but there was nothing warm in it. “Music’s always been a hungry thing. Same with memory. Takes what you give it. Sometimes more.”

I glanced back at him. “That sounds less like admiration and more like a warning.”

“Well, admiration and warning are often siblings. Beauty isn’t gentle just because it’s lovely. And music…” he trailed off for a moment, eyes on the stage. “Music remembers. Even when we don’t want it to.”

There was something in his voice. A heaviness. A certainty. Maybe even grief. Like he was mourning something that hadn’t happened yet, but would.

I turned to face him. “You sound like you’re giving a eulogy.”

“Do I?” he asked, tone still smooth, but now with something like a leer beneath it.

I blinked. Something about that response landed wrong.

“You… usually refer to yourself in the third person,” I said slowly. “But just this moment, you didn’t.”

He paused. Just for a heartbeat.

“Mr. Wellers finds it… easier that way. Keeps things separate.”

“Separate from what?” I asked.

“From before,” he replied, almost too quickly. “Before doors like these opened. Before others started walking through them.”

I raised an eyebrow. “And what happens once they do?”

His eyes drifted to the piano, then to the empty seats.

“They play. Sometimes once. Sometimes forever.”

I was about to press him on that, but he lifted a hand, gently steering the conversation elsewhere.

“You’ll have time to prepare,” he said. “The recital is tomorrow.”

“Why have one anyway? There's barely anyone in town.” I turned towards the empty rows of seats. But out of the corner of my eye, I saw something. A flash of color. A flicker of blue in the far corner of the front row. But the instant I looked directly at it, there was nothing there. Just empty seats.

# Movement 2: Bellmare's Aria

I didn’t sleep much that first night, but it’s not like I didn’t try. The bed in the guest suite was unnervingly soft, too soft, like it had been waiting for me. The sheets were fresh and crisp, almost sterile in their cleanliness, and the pillows held my head better than any before. It should’ve been comforting.

But it wasn’t.

There was something off about the silence. It wasn’t just the absence of noise, it was the presence of something else. The kind of silence that isn’t empty, but watching. The kind that settles too evenly, like the air itself is listening.

I stared at the ceiling for hours, barely blinking. The shadows overhead didn’t move. The ticking of the old clock on the wall had stopped. Time, too, seemed hesitant to move forward.

I kept thinking about that flash of blue I saw in the hall. Claire’s blue. It was so brief. There and gone, but real enough to root itself behind my eyes. Maybe I was just tired. Maybe I wanted to see her so badly that I was turning light into ghosts.

But behind all that, a feeling lingered. A feeling that someone, or something, was watching me. Not Wellers. Not anyone with a name. The place. It felt like Bellmare had eyes, and that it had memory.

By around two in the morning, I gave up trying to sleep. My limbs were restless, but my thoughts were heavier than they’d been in years. I got out of bed and wandered out of the suite, moving like I didn’t want to wake the walls.

Moonlight streamed in through tall windows, painting everything in silver and blue. It gave the corridors an abyssal glow, like I was moving through a submerged memory that hadn’t yet realized it was drowning.

At first, Bellmare felt newer than it looked. Clean walls. Thick, pristine carpets. Soft overhead lights. Even a place prepared for guests.

But the deeper I went, the more things began to change.

The lighting dimmed gradually, like it didn’t want me to notice it. The wallpaper began to yellow at the corners, curling back as though it were trying to escape the walls. Doorways grew farther apart, and the halls stopped ending. They just spilled into each other, one after another, without pause. Like the building was forgetting how it was supposed to be built.

The floor creaked beneath me in places that looked too new to creak. I stopped at one point and looked behind me. The hallway was longer than I remembered. And darker.

Eventually, I turned a corner and stopped. At the end of the corridor stood Wellers, still in his suit. His spine was straight, his hands folded behind his back. He didn’t seem to notice me standing there. Or maybe he did and simply didn’t care. He was staring at a painting mounted on the wall.

I stepped closer, quietly. The air felt heavier the nearer I got.

The painting depicted a man seated at a piano, fingers arched mid-performance, body frozen in a posture of intense emotion. The lighting in the portrait was dramatic, chiaroscuro-style, casting deep shadows across the man’s face. His features were indistinct, as if the paint itself had blurred them. No nameplate rest beneath it.

Just… a silence.

Wellers swayed slightly in place, like he was listening to something only he could hear. Some internal rhythm. Some private melody.

“You usually hang out in the halls at night?”

“Wellers rarely sleeps,” he said, the portrait still holding his gaze. “The hall has its own hours. Plays by its own clocks.”

“You live here?”

He gave a slow, purposeful nod. “For now.”

He turned, smiling softly at me, and gestured for me to follow him. I wasn’t sure whether I wanted to or not, but I relented to his request. The floor creaked beneath as I walked, but no sounds followed Weller's footsteps.

“Every performer who’s ever graced the halls of Bellmare leaves a bit of themselves behind,” he said as we walked. “Like dust in the sunlight, or the echo of an applause.” 

He shot me a soft, forced smile. “Wouldn’t you agree, Mr. Goodpray? That music holds memories?”

I shrugged. “I think that people hold memories. Music just brings it back. Reminds you of them. Good or bad.”

He smiled wider. This one seemed genuine, albeit tired. “Then perhaps we are not so different. After all, I only remembers what I am given.”

I halted to a stop. “You did it again.”

He shot me a quizzical look underneath a smile. “Did what?”

“You slipped,” I said.

“Slipped?”

“Yeah. You usually talk like you’re narrating yourself. But just now, you didn’t.”

Wellers paused beside a portrait, his fingers gently brushing the frame. His face didn’t visibly change, but the air around it did. It was like an invisible tension around him was pulled slightly tighter. 

“Old habits,” he said, his voice soft. “Some names are easier to wear from a distance.”

I didn’t like that answer. Regardless, we continued walking in silence. The deeper we went, the darker the halls became. The lights dimmed slowly until they barely illuminated anything at all. A kind of artificial dusk was formed, where only our path remained visible. But even that light felt borrowed.

I noticed a series of doors along the corridor we turned into next. All of them identical: tall, narrow, and old. Each was painted a faded cream, chipped at the edges, and sealed tightly shut. No signs. No numbers. No knobs. Just keyholes at the center.

I slowed my pace, eyeing them.

“What are these rooms? Storage or something?”

Wellers didn’t slow down, but his voice answered without delay.

“Wellers prefers not to disturb them.”

There was a strange calm in how he said it. Like someone stating a boundary, not giving a warning.

“The echoes inside are old,” he continued. “Loud when stirred.”

I raised an eyebrow. “Echoes of what?”

He finally stopped and turned slightly toward one of the doors, just enough to glance at it, never fully facing it.

“Of those who played… and what they left behind.”

I stared at the line of doors, suddenly aware of how cold the air had become.

“You mean performers?”

He nodded once. “Every note played in Bellmare leaves something behind. A vibration. A memory. A presence.”

I didn’t know what the old man was getting at, not really. But I asked anyway. “And those presences… they get locked away?”

“They find their way to where they belong,” he said, brushing a gloved hand along the trim of the nearest door. “Some prefer solitude. Some demand it.”

The silence between us stretched.

He then guided me towards the final door in the hallway. He opened it, and what greeted me was a balcony overlooking the grand performance hall. The piano glistened from its stage, like it was waxed by candlelight and a moonlit sonata. It looked untouched, ancient, like a relic from another time. But in spite of that, it stood like it was waiting, enduring.

“She’s always listening. Even in rest,” Wellers whispered.

“She?” I asked.

“The piano,” he clarified, like it was obvious. “Not every piano in creation is simply wood and wire, Mr. Goodpray. Some are vessels, conduits. This one, especially, was built for resonance.”

“Like acoustics?” I said, staring at him.

“Wellers means memory,” he said with surety and finality, like he wasn’t talking about sound at all.

I squinted at the stage. “Earlier you said that music remembers. That everyone who’s ever performed here leaves something behind. Are you implying they aren't just echoes?”

“Wellers does not presume to know what becomes of souls or self.” He looked at me, his eyes shining like they held moonlight and flames. “But the piano…it grieves beautifully.”

That chilled me more than anything he had said before.

“Okay then,” I mutterred. “I think I’ve had enough haunting poetry for the night.”

Back in my room, I locked the door. I didn’t know which thought I hated more: someone breaking in, or something already inside, just waiting for a chance to get out. When I finally knocked out, my dreams were like a winter fog. Heavy, strange, and fractured. Claire sat at the piano, still in her casual attire from before. This time, however, her back was to me, and she wasn’t alone. Ahead of her, watching, listening, were shadows. Outlines of figures I couldn’t make out. Her fingers played the keys just as swiftly and precisely as they did when she was alive and well, but no sound followed. She looked at me, eyes not as blue as they once were. For a second, I could hear a melody composed of only three notes. She mouthed one word. 

“Don’t.”

I woke up, heart beating like a drum, breath caught in my chest like a held note.

Morning came gray and reluctant, like someone had dragged the day out of bed against its will.

Everything outside looked washed out, like the sky had been painted in the same charcoal as Wellers' suit. Even time felt sluggish, unsure whether it wanted to keep moving forward. Like the town didn’t know whether to wake or not.

I noticed something on the floor, slipped under my door. A program. The paper was thick, almost like vellum. The title printed in silver ink that caught the light in unsettling ways. It felt less like an invitation and more like a contract. A ritual.

*Bellmare Recital: Featuring Liam Goodpray, 7 p.m.*

I stared at it for a while before I sat it down on the desk. I needed to get out of here. The longer I stayed, the more it felt like I was being forced into some story written without my consent. Especially after that dream.

I went to the bathroom, opened the sink, and splashed cold water on my face. I needed to be as alert as possible. I looked up and froze at my reflection. In the mirror, I saw myself. He was seated at the piano, just how Claire taught: hunched forward, elbows out, fingers poised in perfect form. He was about to play. Slowly, he raised his head and stared at me. I blinked. The mirror was just a mirror again. I stood there for a full minute, chest rising and falling in uneven beats, trying to convince myself I hadn’t just seen what I saw.

I packed my bag and bolted downstairs, ready to leave. When I made it to the lobby, Wellers was standing there, hands casually folded in front of him.

“You’re free to leave,” he said calmly, like he read my mind. “No doors here lock without consent.”

“Just letting me leave? You expect me to change my mind? What if I just don’t play?”

He looked at me and tilted his head. “Wellers expects nothing. Bellmare will slumber another season and the music will wait, just as it always has. But it will not forget you.”

“Is that flattery, Wellers?” I paused. “Or a threat?”

His smile remained as it ever did, but his eyes glinted like a match about to be struck. “Some performances are inevitable. Not because of fate…but because they’ve already happened.”

I stepped outside without saying anything else. The streets were empty, just like when I first drove to this place. The air had a strange stillness, like it was too scared to do anything. I looked towards the road that led out of Dorset Hollow. Just as I was about to take a step away, I paused. Because somewhere, very faint and far away, I heard the piano. Just one note. A low, clean, D-minor.

Yet, even though the streets were silent and the hall was vacant…I heard applause.",6,1762713105.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I make no apologies for being who i am, the older i get, i seem to care less about what people think or say these days. I'm more comfortable in my skin than ever before and i know what i like and what i dont like. I'm straight up honest and will say what's on my mind but at the same time, im empathic (sometimes it's a curse, and yes it's contradictory) and wear my heart on my sleeve. I'm prone to over thinking and sometimes worry about the little things in life, because the little things are actually really important. 

**Things that i like:**  
*Lazy mornings, people watching, the warm sun on my skin, fresh coffee, the smell of freshly cut grass, rum (spiced or dark), teasing, exploring castles and forests (not hiking), long drives in the countryside, 90's alternative music, cooking and trying new foods, psychological films, late nights and early lazy mornings, drawing/sketching, dogs.*

**Things i dont like:**  
*One worded responses, going to bed early, cats, twats riding scooters, being out in the cold, crowds of people, being stuck behind slow walking people, cold showers, noisy people in the cinema, dancing.*

**My strengths, in no particular order..**  
Non ghoster:  
*I'd much rather talk things through, than to just up and leave.*  
Overthinking:  
*Nobody has managed to steal my kidneys yet.*  
Quietly confident:  
*I'm not the loudest person in the room but i will speak up when need to.* 

**My weaknesses..**  
Take things to heart:  
*Yeah, maybe i can be a little sensitive.*  
Ticklish:  
*Please don't make me squeal like a girl.*

**How i live dangerously..**  
*I dont use screen protectors or even a case for my phone.*

**Fun fact:**

I have been dating this girl (going to call her Sarah) and we been on 5 dates in 3 months. She is a really nice girl, but I had a strong feeling she is not really available as much as I am. We have some really lovely dates, but I never really hear from her when we are not together. She says things like ""I am 100% in this relationship"" and then takes sometimes 3-4 days to get back to a simple message.

Anyway, she suggested coming to her house and maybe meeting her parents, which I thought was the right step towards hopefully getting more of an idea of where we are going. Before that though, she said she wanted to see me more over half term (as we are both teachers) which I thought was brilliant, but she seemed to be too busy for it apart from a date to the zoo followed by an aerial class (as that's her hobby)

I hinted I could give it a go, but due to an arm injury I will find it tricky, but she reassured me I would be fine.

Day came of the zoo and aerial class and we had a nice time at the zoo. She was flirting with me and I was flirting back. I was trying to impress her with my knowledge of the zoo's history and just trying to enjoy our time together. After the zoo trip we had 4 hours to wait before the Aerial class.

She started saying how I would ""need to hang upside down on a bar and support my full body weight"" which I honestly told her I would not be able to. I said I will still come and give it a go, but may have to sit out if I risked arm injury. She seemed understanding of that and we went to get a coffee.

On the way to the coffee she said ""So are you my boyfriend now?"" and I said ""I would like to see you more and meet your parents first, Just as I feel like I do not see you enough"" Which she said ""Thats 100% okay, Thats why I wanted to ask first"" and we then enjoyed the rest of our day. I know I messed up a bit, but I really did not want to rush into something after 5 dates.

We got to the class and Sarah's friend Jess was running it. Jess seemed to do the normal things a teacher would do for a class and ask for our names and any disabilities or any injuries. I saw that the aerial pole was way over 7ft in the air and had to say sorry and say that I could not due to injuries. I sat out and cheered Sarah and helped her get up when she needed to. Jess did not talk to me pretty much all evening and ignored me. As soon as the class was over Jess walked out with Sarah after I said goodbye and I am pretty sure they talked about me.

Once I got home I asked if she was home safe and asked about Jess and she did not answer me. Since then 9 days later, I have had 0 messages.

I’m Emily (u/health\_researcher\_emily), a health researcher and mom, and yes — I’ve also sat at 3 AM Googling *“Why is my baby crying and why won’t coffee fix this?”* 😅 If you’re trying to figure out whether it’s **colic, gas, or reflux**, you’re not alone.

This phase is exhausting, confusing, and sometimes feels never-ending — but it *does* get better. 💛



**The Big Breakdown: What’s the Difference?**

**Gas** – The simplest and most common cause.

* Caused by trapped air in the digestive system.
* Baby pulls knees to chest, farts like a champion, and then feels better.
* Crying is short-lived and usually improves after burping or passing gas.

**Colic** – The great mystery of newborn life.

* Defined by the **Rule of 3s**: crying **3+ hours/day**, **3+ days/week**, for **3+ weeks**.
* Baby is healthy but inconsolable — *like they’re training for a screaming competition.*
* Peaks around 6 weeks and typically ends by 3–4 months.

**Reflux (GER/GERD)** – More medical and often more painful.

* Stomach contents flow back into the esophagus.
* Can include spitting up or **silent reflux** (no visible spit-up but lots of discomfort).
* Symptoms: wet burps, gagging, choking noises, back arching, refusal to feed, disrupted sleep.



**Why It’s So Hard to Tell Them Apart (The Baby Drama Triangle)**  
Because babies don’t come with subtitles. A baby can have **all three at once**:

1. Silent reflux irritates the throat.
2. Baby cries from pain → swallows air → gas builds up.
3. Endless crying → now meets colic criteria.

Welcome to parenting on **Expert Level Mode. 🔥**



**Realistic Relief Tips (Science + Sanity Approved):**

**For Gas:**

* Burp during and after feeds.
* Bicycle legs & tummy massage 🚴‍♀️
* Feed in an upright position.
* Simethicone drops (safe but effectiveness varies).

**For Colic:**

* Swaddle + white noise + rocking = holy trinity of survival.
* Use baby carriers for movement and closeness.
* Some studies show **L. reuteri probiotics** may reduce crying.
* And yes — it’s okay to step away for a moment if you’re overwhelmed.

**For Reflux:**

* Keep baby upright for 20–30 minutes after feeding.
* Offer smaller, more frequent feeds.
* Pediatrician may suggest thickened or hypoallergenic formula.
* In severe cases, medications like PPIs or H2 blockers may be prescribed.



**Red Flag Symptoms – Call a Doctor If You Notice:** 🚨

* Fever (100.4°F / 38°C or higher in babies under 3 months)
* Projectile or green/yellow vomiting
* Blood in stool or vomit
* No wet diapers for 6+ hours
* Extreme sleepiness or floppy body



**Your Turn — Let’s Talk!**

* Did your baby struggle with one of these (or all of them at once)?
* What actually worked for you?
* Do you think colic is just undiagnosed reflux?

I met the love of my life 6 months ago after years of meaningless situationships. I was honest about my past (including cheating years ago). A few months into our relationship, she found out I texted a former hookup — nothing flirty or sexual — but she can’t move past it. Now she swings between talking about marriage and kids to saying there’s no future. I’m deeply in love but feel like she’s slowly breaking me down. Mildly refined with AI.

\------

About 6 months ago, I met the woman of my life. I don’t even know what it was that made me fall so hard, but I did. Right after our first date, I texted a friend saying, *“I just met the woman who’s going to break my heart.”*

At that point, I had basically given up on relationships. I’d been in one long relationship that ended badly — I cheated, confessed, and we broke up. After that, I was lost. For years I drifted through casual flings and situationships, too scared or unwilling to really commit, even though I was in therapy and working on my depression and trust issues.

I eventually accepted that maybe this was just how big city dating works — nobody really commits. Dating apps made it too easy to just keep meeting new people without real connection. I’d go on a few dates a month, sometimes have sex, sometimes a short fling, never more.

I moved to a smaller city, and initially nothing changed.

Then I met *her.*

We matched on yet another app, but things were different right away. We talked for an hour on the phone before even meeting. Our first month wasn’t easy, she was a terrible texter, and it took effort to convince her to meet me again. But we clicked: same interests, same values, same ideas about marriage and kids, even though I’m in my late 30s and she’s in her late 20s.

Our second date was amazing — we kissed, had sex, and I fell in love.

We started seeing each other frequently. We talked openly about what we wanted, and I laid everything out — my past relationship, cheating, hookups, therapy. It took some heavy conversations, but everything felt honest and real. After about ten dates, we officially committed.

For the first time in years, I felt like I *deserved* love. There were no lies, no overlap, no games. I finally felt like I could love and be loved again.

Then a few months later, it all started to fall apart.

A woman from my past popped up. My girlfriend found messages between us from when we were already dating. Texts that weren’t flirty or sexual, just a casual follow-up to plans we’d made *before* the current relationship. The coffee never happened, but we did run into each other once; had a meaningless chat, and I told her I had a girlfriend.

That’s it. Nothing more.

But to my girlfriend, it looked like the start of me falling into old patterns. Given my past, I get why she’s hurt. We talked endlessly — tearful, painful talks where I was terrified she’d leave. She didn’t, but she often says things like “Maybe I should,” or “I don’t see a future right now.”

We’ve met each other’s families. She’s from a very traditional background, and her parents already expect a proposal — which I’m more than fine with, I even bought a ring.

But lately, her doubts have taken over. It’s not just about the texts anymore — she says she can’t see a future with me, that she’s afraid I’ll hold her back from life experiences. Sometimes it feels like she uses the texts as an excuse.

She’ll switch from planning Christmas with my family to saying, “I’m not even sure I’ll be around by then.” From talking about kids to “Let’s not meet my friends, I’m uncomfortable.” It’s like she’s fighting herself, one moment she’s deeply in, the next she’s pushing me away.

Every time she says she might leave, I feel like I die a little inside.

She’s even suggested I should get back with my ex from five years ago: *“You’re in a better place now, maybe you could start over with her.”* (WTF?)

The time we spend together is still amazing — great sex, deep talks, fun weekends, love from both families. But at any moment, it can all collapse. It feels like she can’t let herself — or me — be happy for too long.

And despite everything, I still love her. I’m patient, I talk through everything, and every time we make up, I truly believe she’s back to believing in us. But a few days later, she isn’t.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve never been so in love, and yet never felt so emotionally drained. It feels like she’s killing me slowly, one doubt at a time.

Live music is a big love of mine. Whether it’s a packed venue or an outdoor summer show, I’m always down to see a band I love.

Outside of that, I’m a big fan of manga, the occasional anime, and I’m deep into board games and indie video games. Slay the Spire, Hades, and Fallout: New Vegas are my current favorites. I also like cooking (especially seasonal recipes), baking, dancing, a bit of swimming and being cozy.

I a 27F, and I have had body image issues for almost ten years. I have healed that aspect substantially through therapy and now embarked on fitness journey for a month.
I used to weigh 100kgs an year ago and I am down by 12 kgs just through walking, stress relief and eating on time. 

Currently, I am 160cm, 88 kgs. With minor Pcod and high sugar genetics in my family (but not for me as such)

I recently joint a Gym and so far I am consistent for a month. With 4 days of strength training and 30 mins of cardio min. Every day.

I have quit sugar except a single stevia tablet/1 spoon brown sugar on alternate days in my coffee. Being an Indian our foods do lean towards Carbs loading. But I try to portion control as much.

Lately for a week of two I haven 't seen a change on scales as such. But I do feel active and my clothes feel loser. But I haven't seen any visible changes. 

My current diet routine has around 1300-1500 cals but there is no consistency. My trainer told me to not start protein or creatine as of yet and just rely on homemade food.
But I do feel weak or less motivated during mornings. My protein intake is around 20gms maybe daily which is less. 

I take L'Cartinine every morning. Nd my diet is regular with eggs/beans/paneer/chicken paired with 100gsm rice and raw vegetable salad for lunch and dinner. Indian snacks like Poha, Upma or Idli Sambhar for breakfast.

My question is:
1. What all do I need to keep in check to lose fat while retaining my energy through the day. I work a lot on laptop and I feel groggy and need focus during my thesis work now

I met the love of my life 6 months ago after years of meaningless situationships. I was honest about my past (including cheating years ago). A few months into our relationship, she found out I texted a former hookup — nothing flirty or sexual — but she can’t move past it. Now she swings between talking about marriage and kids to saying there’s no future. I’m deeply in love but feel like she’s slowly breaking me down. Mildly refined with AI.

\------

About 6 months ago, I met the woman of my life. I don’t even know what it was that made me fall so hard, but I did. Right after our first date, I texted a friend saying, *“I just met the woman who’s going to break my heart.”*

At that point, I had basically given up on relationships. I’d been in one long relationship that ended badly — I cheated, confessed, and we broke up. After that, I was lost. For years I drifted through casual flings and situationships, too scared or unwilling to really commit, even though I was in therapy and working on my depression and trust issues.

I eventually accepted that maybe this was just how big city dating works — nobody really commits. Dating apps made it too easy to just keep meeting new people without real connection. I’d go on a few dates a month, sometimes have sex, sometimes a short fling, never more.

I moved to a smaller city, and initially nothing changed.

Then I met *her.*

We matched on yet another app, but things were different right away. We talked for an hour on the phone before even meeting. Our first month wasn’t easy, she was a terrible texter, and it took effort to convince her to meet me again. But we clicked: same interests, same values, same ideas about marriage and kids, even though I’m in my late 30s and she’s in her late 20s.

Our second date was amazing — we kissed, had sex, and I fell in love.

I'm new to Reddit and new to this group. Thank you for sharing your stories and your methods for lowering A1c, which have been very helpful. I'm 66F, 180 lbs, 5'5"". Type 1 diabetes runs in my family and I've witnessed my father's struggles and later life complications. My blood sugar levels have been in normal range up until the last year or two. I was diagnosed with prediabetes in late August with 5.9 A1c, but ten weeks later I got my A1c down to 5.4 and dropped 14 pounds! Triglycerides went from 202 to 105. I'm feeling so much better although I understand that the changes I've made will have to continue for the rest of my life, and I need to get my weight down to 145 or better. 

I feel like my struggles were exacerbated by a bad case of Covid in October 2024. Since then, I've given in to terrible cravings for sugar in the forms of sugared soda, cereal and bakery. I feel like sugar became a beast in my gut always demanding to be fed. I was terrified when I was diagnosed with prediabetes. It explained some recent falling episodes when I must have been hypoglycemic but didn't know it. During the worst episode back in April, I was out walking my dog when I became disoriented and felt like I was sinking. I had to brace myself against a building not to fall. I got home and made myself some cinnamon/sugar toast and followed that with 3 homemade cookies and a ginger ale. I had no local doctor as I lived in a small town near the Mexico border. In June, I moved back to the midwest for better healthcare and I now have an excellent PCP. 

After my diagnosis, I re-read Sugar Crush by Richard Jacoby, then The Case Against Sugar by Gary Taubes and Glucose Revolution by Jessie Inchauspe. I went cold-turkey off the sugared beverages and only drink water, coffee with milk and plain, hot tea. I stopped eating bratwurst and other junk at the ballpark and stuck with peanuts in the shell. Next, I started eating more salads and carrots and celery before each meal and cut out pastries and most bread, although I will still eat dark rye or heavily seeded bread on occasion. No junk or packaged, processed food. No snacks between meals and I stop eating by 6:00 pm. I plan my meals so that I walk my dog 20 to 30 minutes later, otherwise I do easy step exercises and light weights in front of the tv. I still eat ice cream every other week but trying to have that after a meal. These changes have been gradual and they have not been easy. Thanks for reading my saga.

1osqnvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Reformed/comments/1osqnvp/on_miracles/,On miracles:,"My thoughts on the topic of miracles.

I want to reflect on the topic of miracles because, although most people today still believe in them, there is a significant group who consider it more rational to treat miracles as delusions or irrational claims. These voices, especially in the intellectual world, shape many minds through their wit and sharp rationality, and if left unanswered, their critiques can seem persuasive. I do not particularly enjoy apologetics, but this subject must be confronted because the question of miracles is foundational to religious faith.

To begin, let me describe what is typically meant by a miracle. Take a familiar example: the splitting of the Red Sea in the book of Exodus. Materialists and skeptics usually claim that miracles are events that violate the laws of physics. Seas do not spontaneously split open, so this would properly qualify as a miracle. Thus, a miracle becomes an act of God interfering with the normal, mechanistic operations of the world. In other words, God occasionally tinkers with His creation from the outside. Unfortunately, this view has become common even among many Christians, further validating the materialist perspective.

This conception is the crux of the entire debate and the source of many modern misunderstandings. It assumes a problematic view of reality: a universe running on autonomous physical laws, set into motion by an external creator who steps in from time to time, especially during biblical events. Skeptics then argue that alleged miracles today can all be reduced to scientific explanations, and that ancient people, lacking modern knowledge, simply misinterpreted natural events or convinced themselves of divine interventions. Therefore, leaving no room for the divine.

From within their worldview, this appears to be the more logical explanation. When I held a purely materialist outlook, I also found it convincing.

Now that I have outlined the materialist viewpoint, I want to present a different and fuller explanation. But before doing so, we must set aside the assumptions that shape the materialist imagination. We must not assume that a miracle is a temporary suspension of physical laws, nor that God intervenes in a world that ordinarily runs on its own. We must not imagine the natural world as something distant or separate from God.

With those assumptions removed, we can begin with a proper assertion: a miracle is a revelation. Everyday life unfolds in patterns that rarely draw our attention beyond the surface. Getting dressed, brushing our teeth, making a cup of coffee. These routines do not arrest our awareness or open our eyes to anything deeper.

A miracle, however, is a sudden jolt. It is a rupture in the ordinary that seizes our attention. In that sense, miracles appear unnatural, but only because their very purpose is to awaken us from the unconscious flow of daily life. We should not think of miracles as God performing a trick to accomplish something because humans asked for it. Rather, a miracle is a moment when we stop, look upward, and encounter meaning breaking through the veil of the mundane.

From this perspective, a miracle can indeed have a material explanation, yet that explanation is irrelevant to its meaning. If someone insists on reducing a miracle to mechanics, my response is simple: so what? To call something symbolic does not deny its physical reality; it simply recognizes that the physical dimension is not the deepest layer of what it is.

Consider something as ordinary as a handshake. You can dissect the moment into muscles, tendons, and nerves, mere slabs of flesh moving through space, yet no one experiences a handshake that way. We experience it as a gesture of friendship and trust. Its meaning far exceeds its material process. This is true of nearly all human experience. Reality is saturated with meaning long before we analyze its physical components. Meaning is the primary way humans encounter the world; we interpret before we measure, and we understand before we analyze. Symbol is not an extra layer added onto matter. It is the mode through which consciousness first encounters reality.

In this sense, there are countless mini-miracles occurring around us daily, moments that break through mere physicality and reveal something deeper. This is because the world is not fundamentally material. It is fundamentally symbolic. Once you grasp this, the great miracles of Scripture become far more imaginable.

Still, it is true that the greater the miracle, the more difficult it becomes to reduce it to scientific terms. This is especially true of the central miracle: the Resurrection. It is the pinnacle of all miracles, and I believe it will never be reducible to material explanation. It remains wholly mysterious, even in the biblical accounts. Christ’s closest followers fail to comprehend it plainly, and so do we.

We need to stop imagining the Resurrection as something easily understood. It is not a simple resuscitation, not a corpse reanimated like some spiritual zombie. It is an event of an entirely different order, the most extraordinary moment in Christian history, the axis upon which the entire faith turns. Something far more incredible is taking place in this event than a mere return to biological life.

To put it simply, miracles are happening constantly. They are the moments when the ordinary breaks open and we glimpse the heavenly realm: Moses at the burning bush, fire on Elijah’s altar, Jonah in the great fish, the Virgin Mary, Christ walking on water, and ultimately the mystery of His risen body. We live in a world saturated with the miraculous, and it is time to re-enchant ourselves to this reality.",2,1762712734.0,Reformed,8,0.75,False

Blackbox users understand something crucial: AI development isn't about 
single models anymore. It's about orchestration.

LUCA-AI_369 is proof of concept.

## What Happened

I orchestrated 4 different AI systems (Claude, Grok, Gemini, DeepSeek) 
to build a bio-inspired AI framework. Each contributed unique capabilities:

**Claude (Anthropic):** Synthesis & integration  
**Grok (xAI):** Code execution & implementation  
**Gemini (Google):** Mathematical formalization  
**DeepSeek:** Philosophical grounding  
**Me (Human):** 8 years fermentation expertise, orchestration

## The Architecture Pattern

Human Orchestrator (Lennart)
↓
[Query/Context Distribution]
↓
┌─────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┐
│ Claude  │  Grok    │ Gemini   │ DeepSeek │
│(Synth)  │ (Code)   │ (Math)   │ (Phil)   │
└─────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┘
↓
[Integration Layer]
↓
Unified Output: LUCA-AI_369

No direct API calls between AIs. Human as router, not bottleneck.

## What Makes This Relevant to Blackbox Users

### 1. Multi-Model Orchestration Works
You don't need one ""best"" model. You need the right combination 
for your task.

### 2. Complementary Strengths > Single Optimization
- Gemini's math rigor + Claude's readability > Either alone
- Grok's execution speed + Claude's architecture > Single approach
- DeepSeek's depth + practical constraints > Pure theory

### 3. Human as Orchestrator is Viable Pattern
Not ""human in the loop"" (approval/rejection)  
But ""human as conductor"" (direction/integration)

### 4. Emergent Properties from Multi-AI
Code quality exceeded any single AI's output  
Novel approaches emerged from cross-pollination  
Validation happened across different reasoning systems

## The Framework Itself

LUCA-AI_369 applies fermentation principles to GPU orchestration:

**Bio-Inspiration (Not Metaphor):**
- Monod kinetics → Resource allocation
- Lotka-Volterra → Load balancing  
- SCOBY architecture → Decentralization

**Technical Stack:**
- Python 3.x
- NumPy for validation
- Bayesian update mechanisms
- HACCP-style safety checkpoints

**Novel Features:**
- Neurodiversity as parameter (γ for ADHD pattern recognition)
- Self-organizing resource allocation
- No single point of failure
- Continuous validation loops

## Repository

🔓 **MIT License**  
📂 **GitHub:** https://github.com/lennartwuchold-LUCA/LUCA-AI_369

**Key Files for Blackbox Users:**
- `docs/MULTI_AI_COLLABORATION.md` - Full orchestration process
- `theory/cross_ai_validation.md` - How different AIs validated each other
- `code/` - All implementations (Python)
- `COUNTER_AUDIT_RESPONSE.md` - Addresses ""show math not metaphors"" criticism

## Reproducibility

**You can replicate this pattern:**

1. Identify complementary AI strengths
2. Route tasks to appropriate models
3. Integrate outputs through synthesis AI (Claude works well)
4. Validate across models (consistency check)
5. Human orchestrates, doesn't micromanage

**Full process documented in repo.**

## What I Learned About Multi-AI Dev

### Unexpected Benefits:
- **Cross-validation** happened naturally (AIs caught each other's errors)
- **Novel solutions** emerged from different reasoning approaches
- **Documentation quality** higher (each AI documented differently, I synthesized)
- **Code robustness** better (Grok wrote, Claude reviewed, Gemini validated math)

### Challenges:
- **Context switching** between AI interfaces
- **Consistency maintenance** across sessions
- **Integration overhead** (but worth it for output quality)
- **Token costs** (4 AI systems ain't cheap)

### Worth It?
**Absolutely.** For complex projects requiring multiple skill domains.

## For Blackbox Community

**Questions I'd love discussed:**

1. Has anyone else successfully orchestrated multiple AIs?
2. What patterns work for AI collaboration?
3. Is there a better architecture than ""human router""?
4. Could this be automated? (AI orchestrating other AIs?)

## My Background

**Day Job:** Quality Manager @ Tchibo (coffee company)  
**Side Quest:** 8 years fermentation optimization (kombucha, brewing)  
**Superpower:** Neurodivergent pattern recognition (ADHD as feature)  
**This Project:** Applying biological systems thinking to AI architecture

## Technical Contact

**Email:** wucholdlennart@gmail.com  
**LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/in/lennart-wuchold-b8b734217  
**GitHub:** https://github.com/lennartwuchold-LUCA/LUCA-AI_369

Available for technical discussions about:
- Multi-AI orchestration patterns
- Bio-inspired computing architectures  
- Neurodiversity in system design
- Quality management for AI systems

## Why Open Source

If multi-AI orchestration is the future (and I think it is), the 
community should own the patterns, not any single company.

Plus: I want this tested, broken, improved by people smarter than me.

## Call to Action

**For Developers:**
- Fork it
- Test the multi-AI pattern on your projects
- Share what works/doesn't

**For Researchers:**
- Study the collaboration dynamics
- Propose improvements to orchestration architecture
- Publish findings (MIT license allows it)

**For Skeptics:**
- Break it
- Show me where the claims don't hold
- Help make it better through critique

---

**This is an experiment in what's possible when AIs work together

Just a little shout out to highlight how good one of my favourite fish and chips shop chains is. I got a treat while visiting the motherland this weekend. So if you are ever in Yorkshire and have a branch of Wetherby Whaler  near you be assured they can look after you! Very coeliac friendly. I've been eating at the Wakefield branch with family for years. My aunt enjoyed it as with her wheat allergy she was well looked after. And when I had to change diets I knew I would be fine. No anemic looking battered fish here! Look at the glow on that!

All done in separate fryers and there's a proper honest to goodness physical menu for you to read. No one slapping you over the head with a binder shouting ""best of luck!"" 😂

Plenty of starter and desert options as well. Be warned. Not even Ahab could tackle the whale size portion! I stick with regular haddock.

I've even linked below straight to the non gluten section of their website. How about that eh? Someone who knows what we want to see right away!

1osqgj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/1osqgj8/to_hate_capitalism_is_to_be_antichristian/,To Hate Capitalism is to be Anti-Christian,"I couldn’t believe what I walked into. My grandmother asked me to go to this church with her, and I agreed because her heart is always in the right place. I usually avoid church because I know how angry I get at the things people say in the name of God, but I wanted to make her happy, so I went.

The atmosphere was friendly. They greeted me at the door, offered me donuts and coffee (which I appreciated), and I found a seat. For a moment I thought the experience would be tolerable. Then the sermon started.

The pastor spent most of the message talking about tithing. He argued that one of the most important things a Christian can do is consistently give money to the church because “God sees your offering and will bless you in return.” I already felt myself pulling back at that point.

But he didn’t stop there. He then put up a picture of President Lyndon B. Johnson and described the welfare programs created for widowed women, claiming they discouraged marriage because women would lose their benefits. He implied that this was evidence of people becoming “dependent on government” and therefore choosing not to marry.

Next, he defined the word oligarchy for us. He said some people claim the United States is one, but that such a belief is nonsense. He insisted that being against capitalism is essentially being anti-Christian, and he referenced New York City as proof, though he never explained how or why.

I sat there stunned. I realized I was listening to pure capitalist propaganda in the middle of a Sunday sermon. He never connected any of his points back to scripture in a meaningful way. He never addressed why capitalism would be God’s chosen economic system. And he completely ignored the very real argument that America does function like an oligarchy in many ways.

I left that service feeling angry. Not because I expected perfection, but because I walked in hoping for a moment of peace with my grandmother. Instead, I listened to a pastor twist faith into a justification for a political ideology. It was disappointing. And honestly, confusing. I just needed to say it out loud.",21,1762712258.0,exchristian,9,1.0,False

After six months of what felt like a soul-crushing marathon of searching, endless negotiations, and drowning in paperwork, I am officially a business owner. I’m sitting here in the quiet, slightly musty office of the landscaping company I just bought, and the reality is hitting me like a ton of bricks. The keys in my pocket feel heavier than they should.

Just yesterday, I was a regular guy with a dream. Today, I'm responsible for a fleet of trucks, a handful of employees who have been doing this longer than I've been alive, and a long list of clients who expect perfection. The previous owner just handed me a massive binder, shook my hand, and walked out, leaving me in this deafening silence. It's the strangest feeling – this place is mine, but I feel like a total imposter who just got handed the controls to a plane already in mid-air.

I spent the morning just trying to figure out the coffee machine, which felt like a monumental task. Every time the phone rings, my heart leaps into my throat. What if it's a customer with a huge complaint? What if an engine on one of the mowers blows? I've gone from managing projects to managing people's livelihoods, and the weight of that is not something they teach you in business school.

But then, a funny thing happened. One of the long-time employees, a guy named Dave, walked in, saw the look of panic on my face, and just said, 'Don't worry, kid. We'll show you the ropes. Now, let's go make some lawns look good.' And in that moment, the terror subsided just a little, replaced by a surge of excitement. This is real. It's mine. And I can't wait to see what happens next.

So, Reddit, for any of you who have taken a similar leap – what's that one piece of 'I wish I'd known' advice you'd give to someone on Day 1?",1,1762712084.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False
1osqdjk,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1osqdjk/malaga_in_october/,Malaga in October,"My mum and I visited Málaga for five days in November (12-16th). We flew into Málaga Airport (AGP) via British Airways on the 06:15 am flight and took the train (C1) into Málaga-Centro Alameda. We stayed within the historical city centre, visited museums and local attractions, as well as visited Ronda and Setenil de las Bodegas on a day trip. Anything in italics is the exact title of an activity or tour we booked, the bold text in the food section were my favourites. Here are a few more details:

Attractions and Museums:

* Alcazaba tour in English with Ticket + Malaga Roman Theatre with booked directly on the website (€8 pp). Our guide was Salvador who was great, they provided lots of historical and cultural background.
* Malaga Park, this park is an open greenhouse with the most stunning plants, it is arranged so beautifully and there are lots of benches to sit and read/contemplate/reflect/chat.
* Malaga: Catamaran Sailing Trip with Sunset Option with Mundo Marino (stand with black umbrella on the Puerto de Málaga). We originally booked with GetYourGuide for 5:30 pm (£11.32) however you can book with them directly. We visited them at the pier and they were lovely in letting us change our booking to an earlier time slot.
* Playa de la Malageuta, we didn't spend much time but we wish we did, you can rent deckchairs here and sit under the shade.
* Museo Picasso Málaga (€11 student ticket or €13 normal ticket): it is much better to purchase tickets in advance because the queue can get quite long even close to two hours before closing time. They also have temporary exhibitions which I enjoyed. There is a storage room so you have to leave backpacks bags behind.
* Castillo de Gibralfaro, if you are physically able I cannot recommend this enough. It is a lovely hike which takes you to a viewing platform (€0) and you can also visit the fortress (€7 pp or €10 pp for access to Alcazaba too within a certain time period). There is seating area and the views are unreal. There is also a bus or the sightseeing bus tour which takes you to the top to the castle entrance but you would still have to climb the steps in the fortress.
* Ronda and Setenil Tour with Free Time from Málaga with AloraTur Tours booked with GetYourGuide (£26.50 pp) however you can book with them directly. Our tour guide was Mercedes and our driver was Javier, this tour was amazing and I am so glad we went! Mercedes was such a great tour guide who took care of the whole group and provided a lot of information about all the places we visited. If you go for a two hour tour in Ronda and have only two hours free time then I would stick with a tapas lunch so you can explore the other shops as you can buy locally grown olive oil and goat's cheese.
* Málaga Museum (€1.50 pp UK citizen), this museum provided insight into the archaeological history and art of Málaga. The museum itself is absolutely beautiful. There is a locker system so you have to leave backpacks behind but you can take side bags in.

Accommodation and Travel:
* We stayed at Málaga City Suites (Booking.com) which was in the historical city centre. The location was superb you could easily get to the main attractions and restaurants within ten minutes, the train station is fifteen minutes away and the closest beach is a twenty-five minute walk. There was a supermarket (Carrefour Express) nearby where you could purchase large bottles of water for (€0.40).
* We walked everywhere but from the airport to the city centre we took the train (purple line on the floor from the airport leads you to the station). I found the video by Travelling Tourist on Youtube titled Malaga Airport to Malaga City Centre by TRAIN incredibly helpful. You can purchase a ticket pass which you can top up so hold onto that.

Food:
* We found food to initially be difficult because we follow a vegetarian diet, when you ask if something is vegetarian in shops they mistaken it for vegan so a lot of the times they will say 'no, it has milk/eggs' so maybe be a bit more descriptive (explain no gelatine).
* Brunch: Sabor Con Encanto, Cousin Brunch & Speciality Coffee, Brunchit, Mi Cafecito - Brunch & More.
* Restaurants:, Pizzeria Terra Mia, El Vegetariano de la Alcazabilla, Los Marangos Molina Lario, Meet Vegano, La Veganas.
* Dessert: Martonela, Amorino, Copa Acai Malaga, Freskitto, Gelateria Di Amore, De Nata - Fabrica de Pasteis de Nata (I visited daily and took six back with me for family which came boxed), Saintini's Gelato.
* Market: Mercado de Atarazanas.

Extra:
* There are lots of museums and attractions which provide free admission on a Sunday, this can be at different times, for example at Museo Picasso Málaga the free admission is from 5pm. Our tour at Alcazaba was at 5pm so I'm unsure if entry was also free from a certain time but it was definitely free for our tour.
* Ask your hotel staff and tour guides for recommendations, they'll have some great places to recommend food wise and day trips too! The restaurants sometimes close in the middle of the day (normally between 4pm - 7pm) so double check the places you want to visit are actually open at the time you intend to go. We didn't make any reservations however we did visit the restaurants slightly earlier than locals would go out to eat (breakfast at 10 am, dinner at 7 pm) which made getting seats easier as it gets busy very quickly.
* There are plenty of lockers situated within the historical centre if your hotel doesn't keep your luggage. In this time you could probably visit the museums or go on the free Malaga city tour which we didn't get round to doing but we wish we did.
* There are souvenir shops everywhere. The most affordable area for magnets and fans were Calle Nueva where you could purchased seven magnets for €10, there are also cheaper combinations. The other popular street is Calle Granada but honestly the best thing to do is wander around and keep a note/pin the shops you liked and save pictures if you're there for more than a day. The streets are all within minutes of each other. Of course, the prettier magnets were closer to 3 for €10. You can also purchase two fans for €5 so it really is worth shopping around.
* We spent around €50 pp each day which included two meals (we would either have a brunch and a early dinner), ice cream, an activity or two, and souvenirs (we purchased a lot for family and friends). You could easily reduce this amount by going for more tapas instead of main meals, as well as not doing as much shopping in the centre.

Thank you Málaga for the most beautiful time, the scenes were beautiful and the people were so kind and patient.",1,1762712064.0,travel,0,1.0,False
