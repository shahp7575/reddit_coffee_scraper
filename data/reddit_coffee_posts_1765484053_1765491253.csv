I think she knows about my foot fetish because I post foot fetish memes sometimes on my story. She joked to me about it once and I denied it. But I love finding a pair of her socks in her room or when she takes them off and puts them on her coffee table. I picked them up and inhale them before throwing them back. Also when we smoke, she likes to put her legs in my lap and relax a bit more. 

Sometimes I offer to massage her legs but only because I don't want to ask to massage her feet. I work my way down to her feet and she just sits there smoking the blunt. It makes me heart pound thinking about picking her foot up and kissing it. Her feet are so pretty and smooth, crazy how sweaty they get when she works all day. But then again she works in a factory and sometimes wears boots. ",1,1765491137.0,confessions,0,1.0,False

1pkaesp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1pkaesp/stubbornly_high_bp_despite_weight_loss_and_vastly/,Stubbornly high BP despite weight loss and vastly improved diet,"So my (41M) untreated blood pressure is fairly high. It will easily hit 150/100, but this is an improvement over my all time record of 220/185 which is what I was when I went to the ER in 2017 with a headache prior to being diagnosed with high BP.

At the time I had been in a comfortable relationship for a few years and let myself go, I was up to 220 and stayed around that mark. When I started being treated it eventually got up to 4 different bp meds: metoprolol succinate 25mg, Lisinopril 10mg, chlorthalidone 25mg, and clonadine 0.1mg as a prn when/if my BP would hit 150/100, one or the other didn't have to be both.

With all four it got back to a healthy BP, most of the time. I still needed the clonidine (which was extremely effective) around once a week, on average. 

Over the last year I have managed to lose a significant amount of weight, 54lb predominantly though diet change, I have been holding stay at around 165-170 for the last six months. I have since been taken off the lisinopril and chlorthalidone due to my BP crashing as low as 44/65 while still on the primary three after the weight loss. The metoprolol is enough to keep it in check, usually. 

That said, what could be causing the BP to even still be elevated at this point? I'm down to 166 as of today, my diet is solid, I went from eating nothing but ~$20/day in fast food from 2016 all throughout Covid (went my day for consumption increased even higher), to eating zero fast food today. I no longer eat anything anything premade or frozen (I was eating frozen tilapia filets for a while at the start of my diet change, but I have since stopped that), my sodium intake is as low as it can feasibly be, and I have stopped eating all meat and dairy.

The only sugar in my diet that I know of is in my morning coffee, 4-8g depending on if I have one cup or two. I measure it religiously.

I am following a one meal a day diet and have been for roughly the last three months. My daily diet consists of 1 cup brown or white rice, and 1/2 cup pinto beans or lentils. I add a tablespoon of canola oil for a source of omega-3s and a multivitamin for coverage. The only condiment I eat is Sriracha because I'm not willing to give it up and it doesn't appear to have any meaningful impact on my diet or BP.

I don't know how I could eat any healthier at this point in my life. I have no other known medical conditions and I never had high BP as a kid. I obviously can't know for certain, but I have a strong suspicion it didn't get bad until I hit a near 30 BMI and started there for awhile 

So am I just stuck taking BP meds for the rest of my life because I gave myself BP through poor diet and a lack of exercise? Once you have it, do you just have it forever? I was really hoping this could be reversed.",1,1765490593.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

What do I do now? 

I don’t want to train her for 3-6 months only for her to leave. We also have some other great candidates id rather join. 

Do I give her a call and tell her it’s best if she accepts the job she really wants, and to reject our offer so either side doesn’t waste their time?

Or do I trust that she accepts because she will want this job truly and stick it out?

1. The Lost Gnome. Just found this via a search of recent permit applications. The permit doesn't specify which unit they're going into, but my guess would be the former Motor Oil Coffee space, since the Real McCoy space would be pretty oversized for this use. They already have a website up at [https://www.thelostgnome.com/](https://www.thelostgnome.com/) . ""About us"" text reads: ""Welcome to our fantasy haven, where passion meets pastime! Here, we blend traditional game store favorites with delightful food and beverages, all crafted to bring the community together, to express themselves, whether fae or mortal. Explore, play, and let the fun unfold!""

2. Station Six. This is the cafe going in at 125 Jefferson. They only seem have an Instagram account, no website that I can find, but have been doing what looks like a pretty major renovation of the space and posted their latest cryptid ""coming soon"" reel a few days ago. From what I can gather they're going to be serving breakfast and lunch in addition to coffee.

3. The new Stacks at 90 State. Construction here has been going on for many months, with the most recent permit application going through in late October. This location is supposed to be kind of the fanciest of the four across Albany and Troy, with more of a focus on pastries and desserts.

4. Jaja Natural Wine Bar. This is an expansion of the Jacob Alejandro cafe on Madison, where the current overflow seating area for the cafe is. The plan is to maintain it as cafe seating during the day and turn it into a bar and restaurant at night. I checked, and their application for a liquor license is currently being processed.

1pka4g9,https://i.redd.it/44b2cy4wbn6g1.jpeg,How to Get SMS Verification Codes When Your Phone Plan Literally Doesn’t Do SMS,"Hey guys, it’s your mod from r/GetSMSCode (and yeah, I’m the one who built the [GetSMSCode](https://redirect.appmetrica.yandex.com/serve/316958281727788117?post_id=i1pka4g9) app too).  
I live on a data-only eSIM myself — SMS is disabled because who actually texts anymore? Except every single signup flow on the planet, of course. The second you try those free “enter the code we just texted you” screens, it’s rage-inducing.

You’ve already tried the classic free sites (receive-sms-free, temp-mail, etc.) and Google just laughs and says “nice try, bot.” Same here — those public numbers have been dead for Google accounts for years now.

So here are the options that actually work in late 2025, no fluff, no dead ends.

# The Three Paths (From Permanent to “I Just Need This One Code”)

# 1. Buy a cheap physical SIM (the bulletproof but annoying route)

$10–15 T-Mobile or Ultra Mobile prepaid SIM from eBay/Amazon/Walmart.  
Pop it in any old phone or your second slot just long enough to catch the code.

* Works every single time, even with Google, Chase, Venmo, whatever.
* Downside: you have to wait for shipping or go to a store, and then you own a SIM you’ll never use again.

# 2. Permanent virtual numbers (monthly hassle)

Google Voice, TextNow paid, Hushed, MySudo, etc.

* Some still slip through Google’s filters if you pay a few bucks a month and get lucky with a “mobile” line.
* Reality check: success rate is maybe 70 % on a good day. Not worth the gamble if you’re stuck right now.

# 3. Temporary non-VoIP numbers (the one 99 % of the subreddit actually uses)

Rent a fresh US number for 15 minutes, paste it, grab the code, done. No account, no personal info, no monthly bill.

* Works for literally everything: new Gmail, WhatsApp Business, TikTok, banking apps, you name it.
* Costs $0.15–$0.50 depending on how strict the service is.
* Number is private — nothing gets posted online.

This is the entire reason the sub and the app exist.

# Real Prices Right Now (December 2025)

|Type|Price per successful code|Google success rate|When to pick it|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|USA regular non-VoIP|$0.14 – $0.28|92–95 %|Most Gmail/YouTube signups|
|USA premium/dedicated|$0.35 – $0.65|98–99 %|When the cheap one gets blocked|

If the code doesn’t arrive in a minute, just hit “cancel” — you don’t get charged, grab the next one. Takes two tries tops.

# Pro Move: Ditch SMS Forever After You’re In

As soon as the account is verified:  
Security → Set up authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, 2FAS, whatever)  
Then remove the phone number completely from the account.

Now you’re truly SMS-free and your account is actually safer than it was with texts.

If you just want this over with in the next two minutes, open the [GetSMSCode](https://redirect.appmetrica.yandex.com/serve/316958281727788117?post_id=i1pka4g9) app (iOS), pick a US number, and you’re done before your coffee gets cold.

Last Pick: **Shai Gilgeous-Alexander O 42.5 PAR❌ (2-POTD LOSING STREAK❌❌)**

Today's Pick: **Kyle Pitts O 54.5 Receiving Yds**

**$DKNG**: **-113**

Wager Amount: 2.26U to WIN 2U

League: Atlanta Falcons vs Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7:15PM CST on Amazone Prime)

**Recap**: Yesterday I LOVED the SGA prop, loved the line, odds, the matchup, just didn't think this would be a massive blowout in a NBA Cup game. I thought Collin Gillispie was going to counter the Thunder offensive runs. It is what it is. Even your favorite or best bets loses, but I am not going to sit here and say that it wasn't a best bet, but most likely would have gone to hot key and handicap **Connor Bedard goalscorer**✅ (+165) or **Blackhawks ML**✅ (+125). The ASSOCIATION HATES ME!

**Matchup:** Again gotta go wit the demand because it's the only NFL game. I would go hot key, but gotta go wit the most popular game on for today despite how confident I am in on other plays. NFL has been a lot nicer than the association, so maybe I'll get back on track wit this bet today and it's Kyle Pitts O 54.5 Receiving Yds against the Bucs.

**This is a favorable matchup for Kyle Pitts because this Bucs defense give up ton of yds.** They may not give up a ton to TE, however, Kyle Pitts is the primary target receiver for this Falcons team. Falcons #1 receiver Drake London is still out, so Pitts will receive a ton of reps and targets. I do like Bijan Robinson receiving yds too, but I think there's enough playcall for both of 'em to go over their respectable lines. **The Bucs give up the 6th most passing yds** and at this rate, Pitts should receive plethora of targets and receptions. The line is low and IMO should be hovering around O/U 68.5 so I'm going to 2U once again because I love everything about this wager, the low line, odds, and the matchup.

**Pitts also have gone way over this line in his last two games (90 yds vs Seahawks and 82 yds vs Jets). Take advantage of this low line, if he is playing he is going over this line. If he is not then we will receive our money back, worth a gamble.**

**The Play & Prediction :** 2.26U on Kyle Pitts O 54.5 Receiving Yds. Also sprinkling 60+ Receiving Yds (+115), maybe even ladder up on both receptions and receiving yds! Kyle Pitts record 40 receiving yds in the 1st half and 50 additonal yds in the 2nd half.

The end is drawing near, but who knos what the future holds. I will never rule out a possibility of handicapping POTDs in 2026 and beyond.

Called in to get them to take my name down so I could get another next time I’m in the area. The guy tells me that while he is sorry it was watery, they don’t put whipped cream on the hot mochas. 

I told him, yes, they do. I worked at Tim’s and have a niece who does. It’s my favourite drink and never have I ever had a mocha come without any whipped cream ever… well, and chocolate shavings but it’s fine, I can live without that the important part is, isn’t whipped cream a requirement to make the chocolate and the coffee come together? 

I thought so at least but he kept telling me that Tims doesn’t do that.

I got off the phone, googled and even google told me that Tim’s puts whipped cream on a mocha (and I know this because I got one last week with whipped cream). I’m going to call the manager tomorrow because I’m not paying extra for whipped cream on a drink that is supposed to come with it.

**The Door**

Megan woke earlier than usual, her mind already locked on the decision she’d made in the small hours. She lay there for a moment, staring at the ceiling, feeling the weight of it settle over her.

This wasn’t about curiosity anymore. It wasn’t even about neighbourly introductions. She was tired of waking in the night to strangers framed perfectly in her window. She was tired of unanswered doors and empty houses that didn’t feel empty at all.

Today she would knock on Number Ten’s door and get an answer.

She dressed quickly, dragging on yesterday’s jeans and the least crumpled jumper from the wardrobe. Coffee could wait. The air in the hall felt cooler than the rest of the house, a faint draft snaking across her ankles as she passed the front door. She strode down the steps of her porch with determination in her stride, she turned and continued to her neighbours,

But then she stopped.

Number Ten’s door was open.

Not ajar, not just unlatched. Wide open, yawning into darkness.

She froze, her feet felt rooted to the ground below, staring at the rectangle of black beyond the pristine doorstep. Her first thought was that someone had left in a hurry. Her second was that they had never left at all.

Every instinct told her to turn around and go back inside. But she stepped forward instead, drawn towards it. The street was silent, not even the wind to break it. The open door looked wrong here, like a broken tooth in an otherwise perfect smile.

She reached the first step of number ten’s poach and peered in. The air spilling out from the house was cooler, faintly sweet with the scent of something chemical, like cleaning fluid. The hallway was spotless, walls freshly painted, carpet immaculate.

Her gaze flicked to the doormat. Nothing. No post, no shoes, no stray leaf blown in from the street.

She pulled back, unsettled from the eery dark passageway in front of her. She turned to leave, and moved with quick strides back to her own home. As she reached her own doorway, her eyes caught a glimmer of white.

Her letter lay discarded on her living room floor, several feet from the opening of the door. 

The exact one she’d written yesterday. The one she had pushed through Number Ten’s letterbox with her own hand.

Her pulse quickened. She stepped inside and snatched it up, flipping it open. The handwriting was hers, untouched. The only difference was the faint, greasy smear on one edge, as if someone had handled it with damp fingers.

She dropped it onto the side table, suddenly desperate to check on her phone. It wasn’t on the table in the hallway where she’d left it charging.

Her stomach clenched. She bent, checked the plug. The charger was still there, dangling from the socket.

Someone had been in her house.

The thought made her chest tighten, her breaths coming shallow. She backed away from the hallway, scanning the room as if expecting someone to be standing there, still, watching her.

Her car keys sat on the kitchen counter. She grabbed them and bolted her car, fumbling with the lock. The car didn’t even try to start, just gave a faint click.

She wasn’t staying here.

—-

The run into town felt longer than it had yesterday, each stretch of road stretching unnaturally ahead of her. By the time she pushed open the shop door, she was sweating despite the morning chill.

Sam looked up from behind the counter, his brow furrowing. “You alright?”

She didn’t bother with pleasantries. “Someone’s been in my house.”

That got his attention. “What?”

She told him everything in a rush, the open door, the letter back in her hall, the missing phone. He listened, arms folded, his usual easy grin gone.

“You’re sure you didn’t misplace it?” he asked, though his voice lacked conviction.

“No, Sam. I didn’t misplace it. I left it in the hallway. Charging. Now it’s gone.”

He nodded slowly, glancing out the shop window towards the road. “Alright. I’ll come round on my lunch break. We’ll check the place over.”

“I don’t want to wait until lunch.” She snapped.

“I can’t leave the shop yet.” He Explained

“You can’t be serious” Megan moaned, holding back so sign in her disappointment in Sam’s perfect good boy behaviour. 

After realising the ridiculousness of rejecting Megan in her dire situation he responded with “I’ll quickly take a look at your car now, see if we can get you moving. That way you’re not stuck if something happens again.”

The unsettling dread of her situation, only increased the more she dwelled on the situation. 

—-

Sam lifted the Yaris’s bonnet and leaned in, peering at the engine with a practised squint. “Well, nows probably a good time to mention I know nothing about cars”

She stared at him. “Then why the fuck did you come and take a look?”

He gave her a look. “I just wanted to help…. I’m sorry, I don’t drive myself but thought it would maybe be a simple solution like putting a puzzle together”

Something about a 30 year old man not having a driving licence made her pity Sam and his small town mind but now was not the time to focus on such trivial details.

Sam shut the bonnet with a soft clunk. “Well I know someone who should be able to fix it. But—” He glanced at the entrance to Number Ten. “The main reason I came down was because I didn’t want you going in there alone.”

In her typical stubbornness, she almost told him she was fine, that she didn’t need his help. But the image of that open door and her letter on the floor rose unbidden in her mind.

The Only word she could muster up was. “Okay”

Sam’s gaze lingered on her. “I’m going to to take a look inside, You wait out here.”

**Chapter 5** 

 **Inside Number Ten**

Sam didn’t hesitate. He stepped over the threshold of Number Ten like he’d been invited, shoulders squared, pace steady.

“Wait here,” he said, voice low but certain.

Megan stopped just shy of the step that led up to the short porch. The doorway yawned in front of her, a perfect black rectangle. From inside drifted that same faint chemical sweetness she’d smelled before — sharp enough to sting her sinuses, clinging at the back of her throat like something she’d inhaled by mistake.

She shifted her weight from foot to foot, feeling awkward and exposed standing there in plain sight. If she followed him in, she’d look like she couldn’t handle herself. If she stayed outside, she’d look like she was afraid. She told herself it was better to stay put, but her grip on the porch rail tightened all the same. She just prayed Sam actually knew what he was doing.

His footsteps moved further into the bungalow, muffled by the thick beige carpet that stretched across the hallway. Then they faded completely.

From where she stood, she could only catch fragments of the interior — a sliver of pristine white wall, the edge of a picture frame, the gleam of a spotless mirror reflecting nothing but the hallway behind it. No clutter. No personal touches. No sign of life.

A soft click came from deeper in the house. A door opening? Closing? She couldn’t tell.

The air felt heavier here. Stiller. She could hear her own pulse reverberating in her ears.

She glanced sideways at Number Twelve, sitting directly to her left. Even in daylight it looked worn-out and watchful, its flaking paint and crooked guttering like a scowl that never lifted. Every other bungalow along Marrow Drive stared back, perfectly trimmed gardens and symmetrical windows like the fixed eyes of dolls in a display case.

Time stretched unnaturally. Every second felt like minutes; every minute, an hour.

Somewhere deep in the house, there was a dull thud. It was the kind of sound you might hear if someone dropped a shoe or knocked a chair leg against a floor. Ordinary enough in theory, but here, in this untouched silence, it made the hairs on her arms lift. Then nothing. No footsteps. No voice.

She pressed her palm against the porch rail, resisting the urge to call his name.

Finally — footsteps.

Sam reappeared in the hallway, framed by the doorway as if nothing at all had happened. His face was calm, maybe even relieved.

“Looks empty,” he said. “Didn’t find anything. No one’s in there.”

“You checked every room?”

“Yeah,” he said. “Both bedrooms, bathroom, cupboards. All clear. It’s… weird. House is spotless. Like no one’s touched it in months.”

Megan frowned. “Then how did my letter get back in my house?”

He shrugged, the motion loose and easy, his expression still holding that simple, easy charm she’d begun to expect from him. “I don’t know what to tell you. Maybe the owner dropped by earlier and posted it back through your letterbox.”

The explanation was tidy enough, but it didn’t settle her unease. In fact, it only deepened the pull to step inside herself, to see with her own eyes what he had — or hadn’t — seen.

They walked back together along the short strip of path that separated the two bungalows. The silence between them wasn’t awkward exactly, but it felt deliberate.

At her porch, he stopped. “I don’t like you being here alone tonight,” he said. “Let me stay on the sofa, keep watch. If anyone’s creeping around, I’ll hear them.”

Her first instinct was to decline. She’d only known this man for two days, and she’d never been comfortable sharing her space. But the more she pictured the open door, the empty hallway, and her folded letter lying in her living room, the more the idea of being alone tonight felt unbearable.

“Alright,” she said.

He smiled faintly. “I’ll come by after I close the shop. We’ll keep things quiet.”

She nodded and stepped inside her house.

As she turned back to close the door, she caught sight of him walking away along the narrow gap between their two properties, his figure moving towards the street. Something about him looked… off.

It wasn’t obvious — just the way the back of his t-shirt bunched oddly at the collar, the tag poking out like the shirt was inside out. She could have sworn it hadn’t been like that before.

She told herself it didn’t matter. Her nerves were frayed, paranoia chewing at the edges of everything.

She closed the door and, despite herself, found she was already looking forward to Sam’s return. She hadn’t known him long, but in his company, she felt… safer.

**Chapter Six** 

**The Guest**

Evening settled over Marrow Drive in that strange way it always seemed to here — not gradual, but sudden. One moment the air was pale with the last of the day; the next, shadows had taken up residence in the hedges and under the eaves.

Megan made herself busy. She boiled pasta she didn’t want, ate a couple of mouthfuls standing at the kitchen counter, unable to finish, then rinsed the plate and slid it back into the cupboard. She lit a single candle on the coffee table, its faint vanilla scent doing little to mask the damp smell that still clung stubbornly to the house.

The idea of Sam staying over sat awkwardly in her chest. She’d invited him, yes, but it still felt strange. She wasn’t used to anyone else moving through her space. She wasn’t used to having anyone else in her space at all. But she also wasn’t used to feeling watched from every window, and that feeling hadn’t let up since she’d arrived.

By the time the knock came, she had almost convinced herself she’d imagined agreeing to it.

She opened the door.

Sam stood there, a rolled-up sleeping bag under one arm, a canvas tote slung over his shoulder. His smile was the same easy one she’d seen before, but in the dim light his teeth caught the glow strangely, too bright against the dusk.

“Evening,” he said. “Hope you don’t mind, I brought my own pillow. Can’t sleep without it.”

She stepped aside to let him in. “Better than using one of mine. God knows how long they’ve been sitting in here.”

He dropped the sleeping bag on the sofa, giving the living room a quick scan, his gaze pausing for a moment longer than necessary on the corners and doorways. “Cosy,” he said.

“Generous description.”

They spoke little after that. Megan made tea; Sam took his mug with both hands. They sat with the TV on low, letting the muted voices of the news anchor drift between them. The stories were all about faraway problems — fuel shortages, a political scandal in a country neither of them had visited — nothing that could reach Ashwick. The sound was more company than information.

By eleven, the quiet felt heavy. Megan stood, stretching until her shoulders cracked. “I’m going to shower, then bed. You know where everything is.”

Sam nodded, eyes fixed on the flickering TV. “Go on. I’ll keep watch.”

The bathroom felt smaller tonight, almost claustrophobic. Steam clung to the mirror in thick clouds, blurring her reflection until she could almost believe it was someone else staring back. She wiped the moisture away with her palm and winced at what she saw.

She looked… worn out. Dark hollows pooled under her eyes, her cheekbones sharp enough to cast shadows. Her lips were cracked. Her skin had that pale, papery look that came with too little food and too much worry.

Her fingers touched her face, tracing the outline of the stranger looking back at her. They dropped lower, over the jut of her ribcage, the knobby bones standing out starkly under her skin. Her thighs were thinner than she remembered.

“I look like a fucking yeti,” she murmured, but there was no humour in it.

She opened the mirrored cabinet and retrieved a plastic razor, weighing it in her hand. “What’s the point? Not like anyone’s going to be seeing these anytime soon.”

She left it on the sink, started the shower, and waited through the familiar cough and splutter before the water ran clear.

She stepped in and let the hot stream beat down on her shoulders, rolling tension out of her muscles. The sound of the water was loud enough to swallow the rest of the house.

Which was why she almost didn’t hear the faint, deliberate click of the bathroom door opening.

Her head snapped towards the sound.

Through the rippled glass of the shower door, a shadow loomed. Tall. Still. Watching.

“Sam?” Her voice cracked.

No answer.

Her stomach tightened. She twisted the tap, silencing the water. Droplets ran cold down her back. She reached for the towel — and froze.

The door was open, and Sam was inside.

He moved suddenly, closing the distance in two strides. His hand clamped around her throat, shoving her against the cold tiles. His face hovered inches from hers, his breath hot and damp. He inhaled deeply, almost reverently, before dragging his tongue slowly up her cheek, gathering the water beading on her skin.

“Get—” she started, but his grip crushed the words in her throat.

Her nails dug into his face, clawing at his eyes, but he didn’t react. If anything, his smile deepened.

Her vision flickered at the edges. Her hands flailed against the sink, searching blindly for the razor she’d left there. The seconds stretched. Each heartbeat was louder than her thoughts.

Finally, her fingers found it. With a burst of fading strength, she raked the blade across his cheek.

At first came blood — dark and sluggish — but then something thicker pushed through. Pale, rotted sludge oozed from the split, spilling down his jaw in slow ropes. As it poured out, his face began to sag on one side, the skin collapsing like a punctured balloon.

Sam — or whatever wore him — dropped her, clutching at the wound, shoving wads of toilet paper into the gash. Not in pain. In panic.

Megan ran.

Her wet feet slapped against the floorboards as she bolted for the front door, water streaming from her hair. But instinct dragged her sideways into the kitchen. Her hand closed around the handle of a knife.

She’d barely turned before something slammed into the side of her head. White light burst across her vision. The floor tilted and vanished.

A hand — too large, too strong — gripped her ankle and dragged her back. The world tilted again as she was hauled outside, cold air knifing over her skin.

Number Ten loomed beside her house, its open door yawning wider than seemed possible.

Inside. Across the spotless hall. Down.

A trapdoor creaked open, its hinges sighing like a tired breath.

Her skull struck each step on the way down.

The basement stank of meat and metal. The air was damp, almost humid, and the floor beneath her bare legs was slick.

Her head pounded. Every heartbeat made her vision roll and distort. The cold was everywhere — in her skin, her teeth, her bones.

Somewhere nearby, something shifted. Slow. Heavy. The sound vibrated inside her skull.

Her fingers twitched uselessly against the wet floor.

Then the darkness closed in, and she went under.

* A skincare line whose out-of-stock message is just “she’s with another customer right now, jealous?”

Please take it easy on me this is my first time posting here. I have a crush on my coworker. Ive felt this way for over 2 years and i think im finally ready to say something even if nothing comes from it.

For starters I am a female in my 30s. My coworker is a male and hes a bit older than me. He's around his mid 40s. Lets call him Damien. Damien and I work for the same company but in different offices. I used to work in the same office as him about a year ago but I accepted a promotion in 2024 at a different office location. 

Damien is kind of a ""higher-up"" so on occasion he will come to my office for meetings with HR. Every time he comes to my office he'll say hi and make small talk. So i dont work with him directly but we still work for the same company and see each other from time to time. 

I liked him from the moment he started working with the company. We were in the same office before my promotion and we spent about a year working directly with each other. Our lunch room chats would go on for slightly too long which I always enjoyed. I wanted our conversations to last longer but he was always late for some kind of meeting. We share many common interests. We both especially enjoyed coffee and would make coffee for one another at the office. Even though we dont work directly with each other anymore we still see each other.

I saw him last week when he came to my office for a meeting and we spoke for a short while. I realized that I still feel the same way I did when I was working with him. All of a sudden I have this strong urge to get these feelings off my chest. Whether he feels the same or not, I just want to tell him. Not knowing whether he'd entertain getting to know me is what keeps my mind wandering. 

Here is my plan. I will be visiting his office in the next few weeks for a meeting. I wanted to give him a gift for Christmas. This is pretty normal in my company. Everyone is giving out gifts at this time. I planned to gift him some coffee beans from my favorite coffee shop. I wanted to include a small note with my number on it. Im not sure if this is a good idea. Im not exactly sure what to write in the note. When we worked together he told me that he was unmarried and not seeing anyone. Im not even sure if that is still the case so I really dont know if I should do it. Im concerned he wont take me seriously because of our age difference. I dont want to get reported to HR and have this blow up in my face. Worst case scenario he's not interested and that's totally okay with me. Im not expecting anything in return. I just cant keep living with my feelings. Reddit what should I do?

I’m almost 20w and on Monday (4 days ago) from about 5pm-10pm baby was going crazy having a dance party it was wild, even husband got to feel it for the first time (not my first time though, I’ve felt baby since around 16w but very faintly). She went wild after I had a frozen coke, however I had another one on Wednesday and a few sips of coke yesterday :(

Anyways since then I haven’t felt her really. There’s been times I’ve been like “was that a roll-over or gas?” Like it was at like 16w haha. There hasn’t been a big defining moment o thought “oh baby is ok!”. 

Keep in mind I have an anterior placenta so this is very ‘normal’ but still like .. idk I can’t really think properly atm. I just need some nice words. 

Booking it to the ER seems dramatic as it’s not an emergency, I won’t get into my GP today but she only has a Doppler anyways, I could call the nurse hotline and see or go to the satellite hospital near me, or find someone to call from my midwife group whom I haven’t met yet. Ahhhh

The problem comes from using very fresh coffee. Very fresh coffee can produce a lot of crema, so much so that with this design flaw, espresso can overflow and come out at either one or both notches. This would obviously never happen with a bottomless portafilter. I believe it would also not happen in a portafilter without notches because there would be a better seal. I suppose one solution would be to grind so fine that it minimizes/chokes flow to a dribble, but that might cause other problems.

She was alone in my room the whole time and didn’t know what was going on. She texted me asking where I was and eventually (as I was riding in the ambulance) I vaguely let her know what was happening.

Once I was back home and feeling better I sent her a longer message explaining everything and apologizing. She agreed that it was “very weird” and said she’s “demoting me” to a coffee date only after that.

I was getting ready to go to work, and I was way behind (I’ve been late everyday). Today was even worse because the office party was yesterday, so I assumed everyone would be late and just slept in, but I went too far. I drove to work an hour late, and when I got there, I was just too embarrassed to go in. I took a sick day. Sat in the parking lot crying for a bit, then started driving away, and I couldn’t stop. I drove an hour and a half all the way to the apartment of this guy I was seeing. We were pretty close, but he called it off a few weeks ago because he’s afraid of relationships, and I’ve been heartbroken. I knew I was being ridiculous the whole drive there, and I kept trying to stop myself, but couldn’t stop driving. I got to his parking lot and finally stopped for a second, called my sister, and she helped me calm down and told me I should leave the parking lot and get some lunch. So then I drove 50 mins back home (shorter back home cuz I took the long way to drive there because I was kind of driving aimlessly, I didn’t know if I was actually going to go through with driving to his place). I started to feel better on the ride home. I listened to some nice music, I stopped at a drive through and ate my food and a coffee and watched a show. 

Now I came back home. I’m in bed. My muscles are so stiff and tired. But the worst part is that I feel so guilty. I took a day off work, and it wasn’t even to rest, it was just to have the most draining, awful day ever. I still don’t want to go back to work tomorrow. I keep trying to say it’s okay and I just was freaking out and I did the best I could, but it’s really difficult to feel good about myself or allow myself to be happy right now. I think I’m still freaking out a bit. And I just don’t know how to snap out of this or feel better. I was dissociating on the drive and now I’m drained and sad, and it’s just a lot. And I feel weak for even acting like this. 

And also confused, like what the hell just happened? I didn’t feel scared or like I was in fight or flight. I don’t even know what I was doing. I couldn’t make any decisions, but technically I was making decisions? And I felt like my wise self was the passenger just observing like why the fuck is child self in the driver’s seat right now? Literally!! But feeling powerless to stop it. It took all my will power just to follow the rules of the road and to drive safely— luckily I was still driving safely. Luckily even though this whole day sounds very impulsive, I was actually doing my best to be rational and not be impulsive which saved me a lot of trouble. Irrational me might have booked a flight away from here or just crashed the car, but luckily even in a crisis I know how to avoid that. But at the same time, me being able to handle crises is why nobody ever helps me. If I actually acted irrationally someone would put me in a hospital right away lol.

I’m very new to Voidpet Dungeon (like literally just started yesterday) and I could really use some help. I somehow pushed my way up to Floor 74, but I feel like I’m hitting a wall and don’t really know what I’m doing anymore.

**So here’s my current team:**

• Sad

• Anxious

• Abandonment

• Joy

• Conviction

I picked them using Amo’s latest tier list, and right now I mainly rely on Sad + Anxious for DPS while Abandonment + Joy handle tank/support roles. I’ve been ignoring the rest of my pets because the tier list said these were the strongest ones to focus on.

# Where I’m stuck: ITEMS

I leveled up Skinny Vanilla Latte and Iced Coffee, since they’re at the top of Amo’s item tier list and basically required for DPS and right now, both of them are on Sad.

But beyond that, I’m completely confused.

**I don’t know:**

• Which items I should level next

• Which pets should get which items

• What tanks and supports are supposed to build

• Whether I’m wasting resources leveling the wrong stuff

If anyone could point me in the right direction (like which items are worth leveling early and who should hold what) I’d really appreciate it.

# Also: any general beginner tips?

Since I’m still super new, I’d love advice on stuff like:

• What to spend diamonds on

• Best way to use dungeon keys

• How to approach leveling, ascending, and vivids

• Common mistakes new players make

• Anything the game doesn’t explain well but is important

Basically: how do I not ruin my account on day two? 😅

1pk9bez,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pk9bez,"New tea (nuo mi xiang from Bitterleaf) and new teaware, tried out together","I finally got a cha hai! And I decided to christen it with a gong fu session with a kind of puerh I'd never had before: a nuo mi xiang called Rice To Meet You from Bitterleaf, the same vendor I got the cha hai from. 

**The Cha Hai** 

I've been wanting a glass cha hai for a while. I have loved tea for a couple decades, but only got into gong fu brewing about a year ago. Since then, I've used mugs, measuring cups, and even a sake pitcher to decant my tea. I went to a bunch of different Asian and international markets (there are a lot in my area), looking for a cha hai with no luck. I found a lot of very tempting kettles and pots and even some plain white gaiwans, but no little glass pitcher. 

So I decided to order one. I looked at a bunch of options, but I wanted something simple and relatively cheap. This one fit the bill. As a math nerd, I love a good hexagon, especially a regular one. If the sides and angles are equal, then the side length is equivalent to the distance to the center from a vertex and so it can be cut into six equilateral triangles. It's  the most efficient way to tile the plain with a regular polygon, which is why bees store their honey in hexagonal cells. Not to say that bees know geometry, but that nature loves efficiency (sometimes). ~~Yes, I know I'm weird.~~ 

This pitcher was the perfect size for me. The glass being clear was important because I wanted to see my tea through it. The spout was fantastic and made for very few dribbles (unlike the mug I used to use). All in all, it was a good purchase! 

**The Tea** 

This is a 7 gram coin. Each infusion was about 100ml of water at 95°C. 

Infusion 1, 15s: This was my first nuo mi xiang and the smell of the sticky rice leaf was powerful on this wash. 

Infusion 2, 15s: The aroma was strong but the flavor was mild. A brighter flavor than the shou I've had in the past, but not unwelcome. I was honestly surprised that the herb that makes this flavor is unrelated to rice. It had a light, translucent brown color and there's very little sediment in the cup. 

Infusion 3, 15s: The color was darker and it was nearly opaque. It almost looked like coffee. The aroma was still present. The shou flavor was much stronger in this steep, balancing out the flavor of the nuo mi xiang. It had a nice body and another little bit of sediment, though really not a lot. 

Infusion 4, 15s: This was nearly as opaque as the previous steep but had the same balanced rice-and-tea flavor. It almost made me want to try cooking rice in some puerh to see how similar the flavor would be. There was still a bit of super fine sediment in the bottom of the pitcher. 

Infusion 5, 15s: This steep was much less opaque, but had no less aroma or flavor. 

Infusion 6, 20s: The color was about the same, but the flavor has begun to fade. 

Infusion 7, 30s: Definitely lighter, very translucent. About like steep 2. Same flavor as previous steep. 

Infusion 8, 45s: About the same as the previous steep in color, lighter in flavor. That sticky rice aroma was still present even after all those steeps. 

Infusion 9, 60s: Even lighter color, almost as light as the wash. I could have probably squeezed another couple steeps of decent tea, but I chose to stop here. 

While this wasn't my favorite kind of tea (give me that aged shou or aged white), I definitely enjoyed it and I'm happy to have four more coins of it! While I would have enjoyed a longer session, I'm not upset at getting almost a liter of tea.",4,1765487956.0,puer,1,1.0,False

Bam Margera Spotted in West Chester Filming New Stunts and Skits With CKY Alumni. Locals Say “Feels Like Something Big Is Coming”

WEST CHESTER, PA - West Chester residents were surprised this week when Bam Margera was spotted around town with several familiar CKY alumni, filming what appeared to be a series of new stunts, skits, and documentary-style segments.

Multiple eyewitnesses reported seeing small camera crews following Bam and the crew as they filmed in several recognizable spots, including downtown West Chester, local skate spots, and a few tucked-away backroads the group made famous years ago.

One resident, Tyler M., said:

“It definitely looked official. They had legit equipment and a planned-out shot list. Bam looked motivated like he was really excited to be working with the old crew again.”

Another passerby said they witnessed a short skit being filmed near a convenience store:

“They were joking around and setting up a scene. Nothing reckless just classic CKY humor. People stopped to watch, and everyone was super respectful.”

Possible Reunion-Style Project?

Rumors spread quickly after a bystander uploaded a short clip to social media showing Bam laughing with a longtime CKY collaborator while setting up a shot. Fans immediately began speculating about a potential reunion-style project  possibly involving:

new skits

updated stunts

behind-the-scenes stories

and a return to the roots of West Chester creativity

On Facebook, fans reacted with excitement:

“If Bam and CKY are teaming up again, this is the comeback we’ve been waiting for.”

West Chester Businesses Show Support

Several business owners said the crew was polite, professional, and even asked permission before filming near storefronts.

A local café employee shared:

“They came in, grabbed coffees, and were super chill. A couple people recognized Bam, and he took photos with them. You could tell he was in a good place.”

Police Presence Reportedly Minimal

A few residents noted seeing officers nearby, but simply observing. According to locals, there were no issues, and everything appeared coordinated and approved.

Bam’s Brief Comment to Fans

In one circulating clip, Bam can be heard saying:

“Just working on something fun with old friends. West Chester’s always been home.”

No official announcements have been made yet, but insiders and fans alike believe a major project could be underway.

Community Reaction: Hopeful & Excited

The overall tone around town has been overwhelmingly positive:

People described the atmosphere as uplifting

Fans say it feels like a “full-circle moment”

Locals are proud to see West Chester connected to fresh creative energy

Whether it’s a new CKY-style series, a documentary, or a comeback project, one thing seems clear:

Something is happening in West Chester and fans are ready for it.

A Quick Breakdown,"With everything going on in the market, TON has been quietly moving at its own pace, Since it’s tied directly into Telegram’s huge user base, the ecosystem keeps expanding even when the broader market feels slow.

Toncoin is sitting around $1.60–$1.67 USD today, It’s down a little in the last 24 hours but still slightly green for the week, The market cap is around $3.9 to 4B, putting it somewhere within the top 25 to 40 range, the Volume has been steady too, roughly $75M to $107M a day.

Ecosystem Highlights

• DeFi is active on TON, especially with [STON.fi](http://STON.fi) pulling in a lot of users. It added over 10,500 new active wallets this week alone, now sitting at 42,814, That’s roughly one new wallet every minute, which is solid considering the market mood.

• Telegram Mini Apps are still TON only, so anything Web3 that is inside Telegram must use TON Connect, This keeps adding new users into the ecosystem.

• Partnership updates include TONCO teaming up with Swap Coffee for better yield flows, along with new AI tools, privacy features, and creator focused projects rolling out.

• The chain’s low fees and setup keep drawing developers, and more activity is showing up in payments, storage tools, and games.

Even though the price hasn’t been exciting lately, the actual network activity looks healthy. TON seems to be aiming for steady, practical growth instead of hype cycles, especially with Telegram acting as its main distribution channel.",1,1765487748.0,TonDiscussion,0,1.0,False

1pk9303,https://www.reddit.com/r/DreamInterpretation/comments/1pk9303/meeting_lucifer_for_the_first_time/,Meeting Lucifer for the first time,"# Setting and Context:

The dream takes place across multiple locations and segments, beginning in Spain (my adolescent formative years) and transitioning through various scenarios involving friends, family, and ultimately a confrontation with a figure I recognized as Lucifer/the devil.  
It’s all one dream.

# Part 1: Luis's Death and the Escape

I was with childhood friends in Spain. We had permission from parents to set up a business venture - experiencing ""freedom for the first time."" The space connected to a theater with a show/presentation. Most of us watched the show, but my friend Luis went off separately and took drugs, getting extremely high and losing control.

I found him in the bathroom throwing up. I kept telling him to wait until 8 o'clock and everything would be fine, that ""they cannot find out"" because the consequences would be like imprisonment in Dubai - massive and severe. Despite my efforts to help him, Luis's heart accelerated too much and he died. I became responsible for managing the death and concealing what actually happened, deciding to tell a false story rather than reveal the drug use.

# Part 2: The Research and the Airport

After Luis's death, I realized something had gone wrong in a destroyed, chaotic office (similar to my first office). There was a dark spirit or necromancer-like presence upstairs on the second level of the office. I needed to escape, so I raced to the airport with one of my carry-on trolleys containing ""all the research information"" - crucial data that held the method to destroy the dark spirit.

I was trying to catch a 9 PM flight to Singapore. I initially got into one Uber, then changed to a different driver. This second driver was very specific in appearance: Spanish-looking, tall, well-dressed, possibly with a goatee, extremely calm demeanor - very similar to Benicio del Toro's character Alejandro in the film Sicario. He asked if he could ""put up protectors,(like airbags)"" and I said it was his call and I don’t mind.

# Part 3: The Transgressive Driver

The driver got me to the airport, but I was very late. Then something impossible happened - he drove the car inside the terminal, right to where the gates are. I immediately noticed this was wrong and thought, ""What's this? This dude doesn't seem correct. How do you drive inside the terminal? What gives you the right?"" This was my first recognition that something was off about this helper figure. I knew something was off with him/strange.

# Part 4: The Missed Flight and Lucifer's Offer

I ran around the airport looking for my gate, accidentally entered a ladies' bathroom, and kept forgetting my carry-on trolley with the crucial research, having to go back for it multiple times. The helpful driver kept appearing, offering assistance. We ended up sitting at a coffee shop table. I insisted I needed to leave to catch my flight. He calmly told me, ""You've already missed your flight.""

I looked out the window and saw he was right - the plane to Singapore was gone. I said I'd go handle the rebooking. He responded, ""Don't worry, I can help you out. I'll figure it out with you how to carry on with life.""

# Part 5: The Lucid Moment and Black Urine

At this point, I had a lucid moment within the dream - I became aware I was dreaming about the airport and Lucifer. My reaction was, ""Oh wow, this movie is amazing. I want to get back into it."" I consciously chose to re-enter the dream.

After deciding to go back in, I went to the bathroom and started urinating black. I found this weird but rationalized it, thinking it must be from vitamins or iodine I'd taken - something I'd consumed intentionally in the dream. I explained away this obvious warning sign, or negative energy leaving my body.

# Part 6: The Trap and Recognition

It jumps back to sitting and having coffee with the driver, when conversing, I realized that he was actually Lucifer – I remember smirking, thinking “Im not scared, im fine” - he noticed the smirk and asked“what up?” he asked, I replied “nothing”, fully knowing who he was and what he was doing. I did not feel scared but rather intrigued.  The dream ""split"" - suddenly I realized this had all been a trap. I was actually trying to capture him because ""he had some information."" My team appeared and confronted him whilst we were sitting, creating a circle around him, demanding the information. He refused. We tried to kill him and get police to arrest him, but they couldn't.

# Part 7: The Theft

Lucifer (the original calm driver) killed the cop who tried to stop him and told me ""let's go, let's run"" and to follow him - though he actually just disappeared without telling me where he was going. That's when I realized: he had taken my carry-on trolley - the one containing all my research, all the data I was trying to escape with.

Crucially, within that research was supposed to be ""the way to kill him, kill the negativity, or kill the devil."" The devil had stolen the very weapon that could destroy him.

# Part 8: The Blood Fusion

I panicked and ran to the garage. I saw the suitcase and think I knocked him out, though the sequence becomes unclear. Then one of my female classmates/teammates managed to get the bag and started taking it down an escalator, running away.

The devil regained consciousness and saw her escaping with the bag. Using his powers, he converted someone else into a form of himself to try to take the bag back. But my teammate recognized this impostor.

She did something extraordinary: she merged her blood with the devil's impostor form through tubes that went from her arm into its arm - like a handcuff fusion. She explained this meant ""wherever you go now I go, because I'll be able to follow you and understand everything and see."" The tubes went directly into the flesh, creating a permanent blood-level connection.

# Part 9: The Two Devils and The Forest Home

After the blood fusion, there were now two manifestations: the original Lucifer upstairs (the sophisticated calm driver) was ""very angry, very upset"" about losing control through the blood fusion.

But down below, the girl who created the fusion was ""very calm"" and started conversing with the form she was attached to. She said, ""This is my home in the forest and my husband is there fishing with friends."" She described a simple, grounded life - a forest home where her husband fishes - while remaining calmly connected to the devil's form through the blood fusion.

That's where the dream ended.

**Background Information**  
I'm a 40-year-old man going through what feels like a significant psychological transition. I've been recognizing patterns of operating from a sophisticated false self, being everyone's emotional container (Wounded Healer), and endless preparation without action (Puer Aeternus). I recently ended a complex relationship where I had projected my anima onto someone, and I'm now sitting in what feels like a void or nigredo phase.

This dream occurred in a single night and I can still recall it with great clarity till date. I am non-Christian, so the Lucifer symbolism feels psychological rather than religious. I'm particularly curious about the blood fusion the feminine figure creates and the 'forest home' ending",1,1765487392.0,DreamInterpretation,0,1.0,False
1pk92rf,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1pk92rf/filter_coffee_novice/,Filter coffee novice,"Hi!


I'm new to this and need some advice. (I'm from Spain)

I currently have a 1Zpresso Q Air grinder and several coffee makers: V60, Aeropress, and Switch.


I like coffees with fruity and floral flavors. I'd appreciate any recommendations for a Spanish brand I could subscribe to that offers good filter coffees with these flavors.

I was thinking about Harmony Coffee Roasters, which has specific subscriptions for filter coffee.


I also want to buy a new grinder this Christmas, which will probably be the 1Zpresso K-Ultra.


And well, right now I have a bag of Incapto Light Roast Ethiopia coffee, and I can't seem to get a recipe with enough flavor. My coffees are too weak. I'm using the V60 with the 4:6 recipe, five 60ml pours of 90°C water every 45 seconds, using the Q Air grinder at 57 clicks. If you could recommend a recipe for this type of coffee with this grinder, I'd appreciate it.

I want to share what went wrong because I would've killed for someone to tell me this stuff earlier. First mistake was building before I validated anything. I spent three weeks making this AI prompt pack that I thought was brilliant. Put it up for sale and got zero purchases. Not one. Should've tested if anyone actually wanted it before building the whole thing. Second mistake was trying to compete on price with Fiverr people. Terrible idea. There's always someone willing to do it cheaper. I only started getting clients when I competed on speed and communication instead. Business owners will pay more to work with someone who responds fast and doesn't make them explain things twice. Third was overcomplicating my offer. I had like six different packages with different deliverables and pricing tiers. It confused everyone including me. Now I have one offer at one price with a clear outcome and everything is simpler.Fourth mistake was ignoring local opportunities. I spent months trying to find clients through Twitter and cold email while completely ignoring businesses in my actual town. My best client came from a conversation at a coffee shop. Sometimes the opportunity is right in front of you. Fifth was expecting this to work fast. Every YouTube video made it sound like a weekend project. Reality is it took three months of consistent work before anything clicked. I almost quit in month two because I thought I was doing something wrong. Turns out I just needed more time. What finally worked was picking one service for one type of customer and doing nothing else for 90 days. The focus is what made the difference. What mistakes have other people made early on?

1pk9129,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1pk9129/still_running/,Still Running,"I don’t tell this story at meetings anymore.

When I tried, people thought it was metaphor…. a junkie parable about consequences and guilt. I let them. It’s easier than watching people decide I’m dramatic.

But sometimes, when I’m lying in bed and the house is still enough to hear itself breathe, I can hear water against concrete. I can taste algae like pennies. And I remember Hunter’s hand slipping out of mine.

Hunter was my friend before he was my lesson.

We met in the slow part of rehab … that stretch where you start pretending you’re stable and everyone plays along. He had the kind of humor that didn’t ask permission. He could turn shame into something you could carry without bleeding. When I relapsed the first time, he didn’t give me a speech. He showed up with gas station coffee and let me talk around it. He’d sit beside you like you were still worth the space you took up.

Jess used to say we were misunderstood artists. Really, we were broke kids with a cheap phone stand and no impulse control. We filmed everything — trespassing, dumb stunts, late-night “urban legend” hunts — anything that might get us views. The worse our habits got, the bolder our ideas became. We weren’t chasing fame so much as proof we existed.

Florida suburbs look harmless in daylight. Dry grass, cracked sidewalks, drainage canals pretending to be rivers. But if you stare long enough, the place starts to feel wrong. Like the air remembers things.

Jess was the one who found the culvert. “There’s a stream under that new development,” she said, voice tight with excitement. “People post about voices down there. We should do a night float.”

Hunter laughed and slapped my back, already imagining the chaos. Then he checked the forecast twice.

He brought three headlamps even though we only needed two. A first-aid kit. A calm face that made people think he was unbothered. He liked knowing where the exits were.

“Ten-minute content,” he said. “We get weird footage, we get out. No hero stuff.”

I said yes because I didn’t know how to say no to them back then.

The day we went, it was humid enough that the sky itself felt wet. We hauled the makeshift raft made of pallets nailed to blue barrels through tall weeds beside a chain-link fence. The culvert mouth was a black circle under the road, the kind of opening that makes you aware of your organs.

The water was stagnant and black. Mosquitoes swarmed our ankles. Jess started filming before we even got it in.

“Raft of the Damned,” Hunter joked for the camera. He leaned into the light, grin wide, sweat beading on his forehead. I remember thinking he looked younger than he really was, like everyone did back then.

I pushed us off, trying to keep my breath steady. The raft creaked but held. The canal swallowed our little wake, and the banks closed in with reeds and trash and failed attempts at landscaping. Jess narrated in bursts, half-whispering like silence was content. Hunter sprawled near the edge, pretending he wasn’t nervous.

I was the only one watching the water.

From a distance the canal looked shallow, a place where neighborhood runoff trickled after storms. But underneath us it was darker, heavier, moving slow and meaningless like it owned more history than a suburb should have. Every so often something bumped the barrels: bottles, branches, maybe fish.

It always felt purposeful.

The farther we drifted, the more the houses disappeared. The canal split behind a screen of cattails, swallowing any view of the road. The air changed too — cooler, metallic, less ordinary. The reeds muffled everything, even our voices, like sound had to fight to leave.

Hunter cleared his throat. “If I get West Nile, I’m suing both of you.”

Jess angled the camera toward him without saying anything. She liked catching real reactions more than acting. I respected that about her. The honesty, even when it was cruel.

The canal narrowed until the raft barely fit. Reeds arched over us like ribs, brushing our shoulders and dripping brown water. Every time my pole touched bottom, I felt silt slide away like breath.

Then the reeds on our right moved.

Not wind. Not a lazy sway. Something bigger had pushed through in a straight line. Jess lowered the phone. Hunter scooted back, legs inside the raft, eyes locked on the bend.

No splash. No rustling. Just an absence.

I held the pole against the bottom to stop us from drifting. I could hear my own pulse, sharp and wet.

Hunter whispered, “What was that?”

I didn’t answer. The water around us felt tighter, like the canal was narrowing its focus.

The reeds ahead shuddered again, louder this time. Like something cutting through them with intent.

Jess whispered, “Are you seeing this?” but her voice sounded far away.

Hunter leaned toward the bank. “It’s probably a dog,” he said, but even he didn’t believe it.

Then the reeds split open.

A man burst out — naked, pale, filthy, muscles rigid like tension wires — and he ran straight at us without slowing. His feet slapped mud, then water, then deeper water, but he didn’t break stride. He wasn’t shouting. He wasn’t laughing. He looked focused, like he had memorized where we would be.

Jess screamed and dropped the phone.

The raft tipped.

I stabbed the pole into the channel to pivot us away but it slid uselessly through muck. Hunter scrambled to stand, slipping on wet wood, trying to push with his hands.

“Push!” Jess yelled.

I shoved the pole deep and heaved. The raft lurched.

Hunter’s foot skidded.

He went over the side with a startled gasp.

The water swallowed him instantly.

“Hunter!” I dropped to my knees and reached for him, plunging both arms into the canal. I grabbed his shirt once — fabric slick and heavy — but he slid deeper, arms flailing under the surface.

Jess grabbed my shoulder, trying to steady me. I reached again and again, feeling nothing but cold current and weeds.

The runner hit the raft hard enough to rock it. His hands slapped the pallets, fingers clawing for a grip. Jess kicked at him, sobbing, half-blind with panic.

I braced against the barrels and shoved with the pole, forcing us down-canal. The runner lost footing and slipped under. He came up near the bank again, still moving with that blank momentum — running even while waist-deep, chest-deep, like water had no authority over him.

Hunter surfaced once.

Gasping. Eyes wide.

“Grab me!”

I lunged and caught his wrist. Cold bone and skin. He anchored himself to me like I was the last object left in the world.

For a second I thought we had him.

Then the raft drifted. The pole pushed us forward. His weight dragged my arm down toward the waterline.

Jess screamed, “Don’t go in!”

Hunter’s nails dug into my forearm. I pulled with everything I had. Something under the surface pulled the opposite way.

Our hands slid apart with a sickening smoothness.

His face went under without a splash.

The runner stopped at the edge of the brighter water as if there was a line he wouldn’t cross. He stood there, waist-deep, chest heaving, still facing us.

Then he turned and disappeared back into the reeds.

We drifted away in a straight line, pushed by a current I hadn’t noticed before, like the canal was done with us and impatient to let us go.

By the time we reached a road and flagged down a landscaping truck, Jess could barely speak. I said Hunter slipped, I tried to save him, we panicked. I didn’t mention the man in the reeds.

The cop taking my statement looked bored. He wrote “alcohol or drugs suspected” before I finished a sentence.

Search teams combed the canal for hours. They found Hunter the next afternoon, caught against a concrete spillway. No marks, no trauma, nothing that suggested anything strange. The water was blamed. It always is.

Jess replayed what little footage survived the panic, zooming in on shadows, trying to convince herself Hunter had been pulled rather than swept. I tried to stay sober. Fear does that for a while.

We stopped talking after that. Not immediately, but quickly. Every time my phone lit up with her name, something inside me tightened, like I’d woken up submerged again.

Jess never found quiet. She told me once she could hear heavy footsteps pacing her backyard at night, circling the house in perfect loops. I told her it was grief and insomnia. I didn’t fully believe myself.

A few months later, she relapsed hard.

I heard about her overdose from a mutual friend. Closed casket. Her mother asked if anyone from “those YouTube days” would speak at the memorial, but nobody did. I stood at the back of the funeral home with my hands in my pockets, wishing I could apologize to her for ever saying yes.

After the service, I sat alone in my car. I didn’t cry. Everything in me felt rinsed out.

My phone buzzed.

A message from Jess — one I had never seen. Sent weeks after Hunter drowned and months before she died.

I opened it without breathing.

None of them are girls I’m close to, and I’m not attracted to them in real life. The pattern is weird enough that I’m curious what it means.

**About me for context:**  
I’m not exactly good-looking, never had a girlfriend, and I barely talk to girls in real life. Social stuff isn’t my strong side. Maybe that’s relevant, I don't know.

Also: these dreams started happening after my friend’s 18th birthday party, where something happened with a former classmate (17F). I was drunk, so I only clearly remember us talking and hugging. Someone later claimed we kissed, but I don’t believe that at all.

**Dream 1:**  
I had to take off my shoes before entering a store and put them in a bag. When I came back, there was suddenly an extra pair inside. A random girl (not anyone I know irl) showed up, said something I don’t remember, I gave her the shoes, she thanked me, and we said goodbye. Then it turned out we were walking in the same direction. Suddenly the scene switched and we were playing CSGO together on Cache. (Valve please add Cache back)

**Dream 2:**  
I passed a goth girl in a doorway. We looked back at each other. Then I went up to her, kept stuttering badly, but somehow we still ended up getting coffee.

**Dream 3 (last night):**  
I was in a classroom with my friend talking about some fuel station guy who was accused of being a pedophile. (There *was* a local pedo story about two weeks ago, but I can’t go into details here.)  
Then a girl came up to me — someone I only know through mutual friends, and in real life we just say hi. I’m not attracted to her at all and honestly think she’s a bit weird.  
In the dream she told me I looked cute and asked me to go for a walk. I agreed, but we accidentally walked in different directions at first, so I went back to her. Then the dream jumped again: we were suddenly in a kitchen with my friend. I poured tea for everyone — exactly 7L left — and then me and my friend continued talking about the fuel station guy.

**TL;DR:**  
These dreams started after an 18th birthday party where something happened with a former classmate.  
Across the dreams there’s still a pattern: the girl shows interest in me (either directly or through the vibe), I get flustered or unsure how to act, and then the dream jumps to something random.

So I am living litterally in bed from october. I also wrote the fact that I had to go to the emergency hospital. 

No answer. Visualized. No answer. I try to say to my self: ok, thanks, maybe you are not a so kind friend. But in reality I feel guilty because I had not to say that I feel bad because I have no right to feel bad, because I am heavy, because people died in these days and he is surely thinkin that I am a victimistic person in front of people who stay worse than me etcetera. I am trying to analyzed all the causes of the silence, I would like to punish my self. 

Sometimes I think that the only way to feel not guilty it would be being dead. ",7,1765487206.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False
1pk901p,https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/1pk901p/handsome_senior_seeks_fullfigured_nutrients/,Handsome Senior Seeks Full-Figured Nutrients,"Hi gang. At 65, I have recently been dropping weight comfortably with carb reduction and light exercise. My difficulty is in getting enough of what my body seems to need. I'm always chilled and I run down daily at about 3pm when I have to take an hour's nap. Then I'm good to go until bed time around 10-10:30.

Breakfast is usually around 7:00. 2 tbsp of Metamucil (been doing this since my 40s) and about a half hour later, I have a spinach omelette (1 egg, 1 egg white), a container of Oikos Trip Zero w/some blueberries, and a toasted slice of Dave's Killer 21 grain thin-slice with a bit of butter, 8oz of coffee with Splenda.

Lunch... a ham and cheese lettuce wrap with mustard, 20 or so almonds and left-over salad w/balsamic from dinner the night before, another toasted slice of Dave's Killer and 8-12oz of water.

This is generally the early menu as I do not get bored eating the same thing each day. I actually prefer consistency here. Dinner is where I get my change-ups. Almost never have red meat. Six ounces of pork, chicken or fish, some kind of sauce, brown rice or beans, veggies, water. I am pretty good at the 1/2-1/4-1/4 portion and use a 10-inch plate.

Sorry for the book, but figured I'd get the facts out there for you to maybe reduce the questions. What should I have daily for those first two meals that is 30 to 40 carbs each and nutrient dense? Thanks for your thoughts.

I need help and support.,"2 years ago I was told I had an inguinal hernia. At that time it didn't need repair, but it would if it got worse. I had poor breathing technique while working out and did my best to change that. I also reduced the weight I was lifting and trained myself to subconsciously tighten my core at all times (this will later come back to bite me). Sadly, after 6 months, it got to the point that it needed a repair despite my efforts. Before the surgery they looked at my other side and realized that it had progressed and would also need repair very soon, so they just did them both. I had some moderate pain in repair site, and an ultra sound revealed that I now had an umbilical hernia. According to them, this was so small that I didn't need to do anything about it.

After 4 months of recovery and a lot of lost gains, I was back in the gym. Things felt great. Near daily I would think to myself how grateful I was to have a functioning body again that allowed me to go to the gym 3 to 4 days a week. I had about 8 months of feeling great.

Then I started to noticed this bulge in my throat. Felt like I was sick with a sore throat or like I was having an allergic reaction, but it didn't go away. Also nonstop burping. Started losing my voice and a globus sensation that began to trigger my gag reflex.

Did a endoscopy and discovered I have a small 2cm hiatal hernia which is likely the cause of this. I go online and see that most exercise and especially lifting is terrible for HH. If what I'm experiencing is the result of just a mild, 2cm HH, I really don't think I can handle it getting worse.

Just like that, I'm back to square one and falling into a huge depression. Working out was my mental health release, and now its directly hazardous to me. I've cut out coffee, limited myself to 2 cups of green tea a day, cut out chocolate, alcohol, and spicy food (I never smoked).

This might sound hyperbolic, but how does one expect to age in a healthy way if you cannot lift or exercise? Google AI says that if you have a HH, you just replace lifting and running with ""Gentle Yoga""... Are you fucking kidding me? That's a slow death sentence.

So yeah, I'm in a panic, I'm furious, I'm miserable. I don't know what to do and I feel like I'm getting mixed answers from every resource I find. I feel like I'm a generally healthy person, so why are my insides falling apart and totally failing me?

Any advice or support would be nice as I'm clearly a fucking mess right now. Thanks.",2,1765487036.0,HiatalHernia,2,1.0,False

This morning, I stopped on the way in and got an iced coffee, which was like $7 and a splurge for me, but I like to treat myself sometimes on 2 show days, which we have today.

I was about halfway through it when I arrived at work and needed to start doing my presets before the show, so I left it sitting on a table in the wardrobe room. When I went back to the room pre-show to grab it, it wasn’t sitting next to my water bottle anymore. I thought I had moved it and looked all over but didn’t see it. Someone else that was in the room at that moment helped me look for it and we found it in the trash. I was immediately livid and sad.

I went out to the wardrobe area backstage and asked around to figure out what happened. It turned out to be one of the other wardrobe people had thrown it away. When I confronted him to ask why, he said it wasn’t supposed to be on the table I left it on. This guy saw me leave it there and chose not to say anything and I didn’t know it wasn’t supposed to be there. Instead of moving it somewhere more appropriate, he took it upon himself to just throw it away??? Then when I confronted him, he argued with me and told me there was barely any left and he didn’t know where I was?? I said no it was half full still and that was incredibly rude and disrespectful and he could have just moved it. He continued trying to argue with me so I walked away because I was about to start yelling at him I was so upset.

I am about 1 day out from my period and have pretty bad PMDD and was very emotional, trying not to cry, etc. I felt stupid and embarrassed because it’s “just” a cup of coffee, but that felt like my little treat to get me through a 12 hour work day and then it was just gone. This asshole didn’t even apologize.

One of my other coworkers overheard and secretly went and bought me another coffee, which was so kind that I started crying again 😭

But I just can’t shake this anger towards the other dude and wondering wtf his problem is. There were about 10 other cups of coffee sitting around the room so it’s not like I was the only one doing something “wrong”. I don’t know what I’m hoping for from this post except just to vent a bit and wonder if I’m alone in being so upset about this still, hours later.

I know it might sound like some wild creative story, but trust me, this really happened to me 😭]]]

I’m 25, and for the last 2.5 years, I thought I was in a great relationship with Adam, who’s 31. It was the kinda relationship where you daydream about the future and like, write his last name after yours when you’re bored at work...

Now? Now, I’m living with his wife. Yeah, you read that right

We met on Hinge. His profile said “divorced, no kids” and “looking for something serious.” Our first date was, like, classic but cute. We went to a small bar with a pool table. He taught me how to shoot, even though I was already good at it. He put his hand on my waist. He walked me home, didn’t push for sex, and texted me to check if I got home safely, sending me pics of his cat. It was picture perfect.

He was consistent. Sent good morning texts, made goodnight calls. He remembered my coffee order, came to my graduation, and cried when I got my first real job. My friends were, like, “This guy is a green flag.” I was that annoying girl in the group chat saying, “OMG, he’s actually emotionally available!!!”

But... I overlooked two “yellow flags”:

I’d never been to his place. He always gave some excuse: “It’s too far, it’s messy, my roommate’s got someone over”. We mostly stayed at my place or traveled together

He was weird about photos. We took pics together, but he never wanted to post any. He was be like, “my ex is crazy, I don’t want any drama”

I was just in love, okay? Just... so blissfully naïve

Then boom, reality hit me like a truck.

A new woman started at my job. We went for drinks after work, added each other on Insta, and while I was half asleep that night, I scrolled through her page. I stopped when I saw a wedding photo..😶‍🌫️

The groom looked JUST like my boyfriend🫢

At first, I laughed, then I zoomed in, and no way. Same jawline, same dimple. My mind went noooo. But then I swiped through the rest of the photos...

Same tattoo on his wrist Same watch I got him for his birthday. SAME EXACT MAN 🤯

The profile read: “my forever” “three years with my best friend"" “couldn’t have picked a better father for my kids” Kids. Plural

In a pic he was holding a newborn in a tiny pink hat. I checked the date, it overlapped with a weekend he said he was on a someone's trip. I felt like ice cold. The tunnel vision, when everything goes silent. That was me.

I clicked on her profile. The nickname is Jemima, 29. Her bio says: Wife ,mom of two, true crime & iced coffee. Her page was basically a scrapbook of their entire relationship/engagement/wedding/pregnancies/first steps/dinners. While I was getting supermarket flowers from him on a random day, they were having family photoshoots in matching outfits...

Then, after that, I scrolled back to the day he first messaged me on Hinge. He started dating me before their second baby was even born. I was like WTF! 😳

I don’t even remember how long I sat on my bathroom floor just staring at my phone. I blocked him, then unblocked him, typed “how could you” and deleted it. I called my best friend but hung up before it rang. I felt sick. I cried. Then...?? something snapped inside me

If I was blindsided, she had to be too🤐

I stalked her page for 24 hours straight. No suspicious photos, no shady captions. Everything seemed like this boring, domestic happiness. He was living a double life like a freakin' pro. So I made a Google voice account and messaged her saying: jey, this sounds crazy but I promise I’m not trolling you. I think we... might be dating the same men”.

I sent her a few photos: a selfie of us at my graduation where he’s kissing my cheek, and, a screenshot of our Hinge chat where he says, “I’ve been divorced for a year, my ex is crazy”

Shockingly, she replied within a minute: Call me. Right now. I couldn’t stop shaking, but I hit that green button She picked up on the first ring, no ""hello"", and said: How long? I said to her: just 2.5 years

Then? An awful silence and she broke down sobbing/gasping. She said they were married for 4 years, together for 7, with 2 kids under 3. She used to think, he was just working late, going to gym more, having extra shifts.

All those “late-night gym selfies?” they were just him in parking lot of Planet Fitness near their house.

We spent 3 hours on the phone comparing dates/ restaurants/timelines. Then realized he literally copied everything. He took us to the same places, bought us the same cheap jewelery, and using same lines. She told me that she felt like her whole life was just a rental she had never signed up for.🥲

By the end of the call we weren’t crying anymore. We were both just… quiet. Numb. Angry in this very calm way. Then she asked, “Do you wanna blow up his life with me?”

I said yes

So we made a plan👁️

She invited him to a family dinner at her parents' house for her dad’s birthday. She told him to dress nice and not to be late. She texted me the address and time. I arrived 15 minutes early with a bottle of wine and printed screenshots of EVERYTHING. Her parents already knew what was going on. Her mom hugged me like I was family. Her dad looked like he wanted to commit murder.

When he pulled up, I was watching from the window. My heart was racing as if I were cheating-even though I was the one who was being cheated on. The liar just walked in, all charming, kissed his wife, greeted her parents.He did not notice me at first because I was sitting in the corner of the living room. Then Jemima said to him: “Adam, she is Jacqueline. You’ve been dating her for two and a half years”

He turned. Our eyes locked. I swear I saw his soul leave his body. He went pale. Then red. Then that weird color people get when they feel faint. He tried to laugh it off at first. “Babe, what is this? Some kind of joke?” He looked at me like I was supposed to play along.

I just placed the stack of papers on the coffee table. Screenshots/photos,bank statements,hiis Hinge profile

Her dad looked at him asking him to settle down first to which he denied. Then he threw some story about how we “were on a break” when he met me. “Just friends,” he said calling me a stalker in front of her family.

That’s when I snapped

I pulled out my phone and played a voice note where he told me, just two days ago, that he couldn’t wait to finally move in together and feeling stuck in a dead marriage with a roommate. Jemima just stared at him, not shouting, just... disappointed. It was like watching a stranger wearing her husband’s face

Her dad said, “Go get your things. My daughter will pack what she wants. You have ten minutes to leave my house”. He tried to plead, cry, and grab jemina. Her mom stepped between them.

I grabbed my keys and left because I was shaking so badly and I didn’t want to hear him say my name again. I thought that was the end of it. I went home. Blocked him on everything. Sat on my bed and stared at the wall and wondered how I was going to explain to my friends that my “green-flag-guy” was just a liar.

Then Jemima texted me: “I kicked him out. I’m filing tomorrow. I don’t want to be alone with two kids and a mortgage. Do you... want a roommate?”

She was dead serious

I said yes

So now I live in the spare room of the house he was paying for. I give her money for rent and groceries, help with the kids, and we’ve built this weird little alliance out of the ruins of his double life. People keep asking if I’m okay and I don’t know how to answer. Some days I feel like a homewrecker. Some days I feel like I accidentally rescued a stranger from a burning building I helped light.

Here’s the part I haven’t told anyone in my real life: I’m starting to have feelings for Jemima. Not in a “haha let’s trauma bond and joke about being wives” way ,but, in a very real/inconvenient way. We stay up late talking about everything. She falls asleep on the couch with her head on my shoulder. She texts me memes all day, steals my hoodies, makes my coffee exactly how I like it without asking. The first time I saw her in scrub pants and a messy bun, wrangling a toddler on her hip, I had this intrusive thought of “I’d marry you and never lie to you I don’t even know what my label is. I never questioned my sexuality before. I dated men. I loved him. Now I look at his wife and think, “You were the upgrade all along.” I’m not doing anything about it. She’s freshly separated, grieving the life she thought she had. I’m the other woman who wasn’t supposed to exist. The last thing she needs is me complicating it further.

So I’m just here. Living in the house my ex lied his way into, helping his wife rebuild a life that never should’ve been broken, learning how to make dinosaur-shaped pancakes for kids who call me “jacqueline” and think I’m just there mom’s friend. Sometimes we are just sitting on the couch, kids finally asleep, Netflix humming in the background, and she looks over and says, “Thank you for telling me. I’m glad it was you.”

I needed to put this somewhere because it feels too insane to be real and too heavy to keep in my head. No one in my real life knows the full story. To my friends, I just “found out he was cheating.” To her family, I’m “the girlfriend.” Only she and I know every ugly detail.

(my deepest gratitude if you have really honestly read this far!!! Hugs!!! (⁠个⁠_⁠个⁠))

TL;DR: Dated a guy for 2.5 years. Found out through Instagram that he’s married with two kids. His wife and I compared timelines and confronted him at a “family dinner.” We kicked him out and moved in together as roommates. Now he’s couch-surfing, and I’m slowly developing feelings for the woman he lied to us both about",2,1765486647.0,offmychest,8,0.53,False

Due to the introduction of the Chartopia API, I hadn't noticed that certain things couldn't/shouldn't be done in these types of environments, so I've made the required changes. In the past, it was possible to use features that implied a logged in user, but embeds should *never* allow that (try embedded a private YouTube video and you'll see what I mean).

I essentially had to re-implement the embed supported content with best practices in mind, which admittedly, the Notion app enforced.

Embeds can definitely be improved upon, for example, an easier way to select smaller form factors, but it's now at parity with what should have been there before.

An example url for an embedded chart, paste the following into you Notion App and set it to be 'embedded'

You can follow those links in any browser.

1pk8oer,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/1pk8oer/how_i_want_to_live_life/,How I want to live life,"I wanna live my life like a movie or rather more meaningfully. Our life, we can do whatever we want, we decide how it goes. But wait, life is unforgiving, maybe a breakup happens, maybe we get fired, maybe we get into an accident, break a bone, someone we know dies, we got a job we didn't want or maybe we become homeless. But even when we can't control what happens, we can control how we experience it. So I try living life like a movie, we don't change anything we do, but we just do with the intention and consciousness of doing it. Like drinking coffee in the morning. Get into the vibe, feel it. Living life “like a movie” isn’t about being dramatic or aesthetic, it’s about being conscious, present, and finding meaning in small moments like the morning coffee, the walk to class, the time with friends, the quiet night alone. Those become the scenes of our life.


Life isn't real without some challenges, maybe some people have it better, but why should we compare if everyone's life is different? Would we let a boring 9-5 office job stop us from having fun. I get it though, where would we find the energy to have fun when we spent all of it doing something like work, but even a boring or tiring life can be meaningful if we approach it with intention, adding small joys, noticing details, putting heart into what we’re already doing. We can’t always choose our circumstances, but we can choose our attitude, style, and energy. Get a different drink everyday, get some snacks, decorate your desk, get a comfier chair, take a break and make a good coffee, I dont know man, but I feel like all those little things can genuinely improve how we live.


We're all living life for the first time, so mistakes are inevitable, we may have trauma and a past we regret, futures we don't look forward to. That's why people say live in the present, but I think some people misunderstand it, cuz we're not supposed to just focus on the present and not care about the pass and future, we're supposed to live in the present to make our past and future better. You know what I mean? Cuz you're shaping them when you're living in the present, but when youre living in the present and not caring about them, youre legit doing nothing. So basically do what you can and want for a better future that you hoped for, and a past you regret less. 


People think life cant be fun unless they have money to have freedom to do what they want, but when you look at some billionaires and millionaires, they themselves say that they're not having fun, why? Because money only gives us more freedom to do what we want, but if you don't know what you want what's the point? Find things to do, make a bucket list, cuz we can't always remember what we want to do then only think about getting rich. For me, I have things I want to do, but I'm not doing them now, I wanna do them when I'm rich, cuz I can amplify what I want to do and make it a ""better experience"".


I just realised how bad I am at making a point, before this the whole thing had 1000 more words I had to rewrite most of the stuff I wrote lol. What I'm trying to say is that I don't want to autopilot life, and I want to live life with purpose and goals, there was a time where I felt like life was too long and it's pretty boring, but now that I found my goals I feel like it's too short, I'm not even 1% close to my goals, I wanna get good at video editing because I wanna put show my creative elements in reels and get praised, get rich, become a national level rock climber, make music, games and I wanna love someone. My dreams are big so they make me work harder, even if I don't achieve them, I can look back knowing I tried hard, I'll have a story to tell, rather than me looking back and regretting not dreaming bigger. Some people wish for a normal life, normal job, normal family, and die, I don't blame them, life made it that way, but I want to experience a ""better"" life. Obviously I have realistic goals too like a normal job, we don't sacrifice much from reality by having dreams, but we sacrifice a lot of life by not having dreams.


I wrote this cuz I wanted to organise my thoughts, my thoughts were everywhere so it was hard to follow. After writing this, I learned a lot, while I was writing I realised I said many unrealistic things, and had to change them, it gave me clarity. My English may not be the best even though it's my first language so sorry and I have more things I want to say, but I forgot them as I was writing, but. I want to live life like a movie, because we judge everything in the movie, not just the good parts. It's the same with life, it's not just our achievements, but our little small mundane moments, our regrets, our mistakes, and the way we chose to live through them.

1pk8od1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1pk8od1/first_dream_meeting_lucifer/,First dream meeting Lucifer,"# Setting and Context:

The dream takes place across multiple locations and segments, beginning in Spain (my adolescent formative years) and transitioning through various scenarios involving friends, family, and ultimately a confrontation with a figure I recognized as Lucifer/the devil.  
It’s all one dream.

# Part 1: Luis's Death and the Escape

I was with childhood friends in Spain. We had permission from parents to set up a business venture - experiencing ""freedom for the first time."" The space connected to a theater with a show/presentation. Most of us watched the show, but my friend Luis went off separately and took drugs, getting extremely high and losing control.

I found him in the bathroom throwing up. I kept telling him to wait until 8 o'clock and everything would be fine, that ""they cannot find out"" because the consequences would be like imprisonment in Dubai - massive and severe. Despite my efforts to help him, Luis's heart accelerated too much and he died. I became responsible for managing the death and concealing what actually happened, deciding to tell a false story rather than reveal the drug use.

# Part 2: The Research and the Airport

After Luis's death, I realized something had gone wrong in a destroyed, chaotic office (similar to my first office). There was a dark spirit or necromancer-like presence upstairs on the second level of the office. I needed to escape, so I raced to the airport with one of my carry-on trolleys containing ""all the research information"" - crucial data that held the method to destroy the dark spirit.

I was trying to catch a 9 PM flight to Singapore. I initially got into one Uber, then changed to a different driver. This second driver was very specific in appearance: Spanish-looking, tall, well-dressed, possibly with a goatee, extremely calm demeanor - very similar to Benicio del Toro's character Alejandro in the film Sicario. He asked if he could ""put up protectors,(like airbags)"" and I said it was his call and I don’t mind.

# Part 3: The Transgressive Driver

The driver got me to the airport, but I was very late. Then something impossible happened - he drove the car inside the terminal, right to where the gates are. I immediately noticed this was wrong and thought, ""What's this? This dude doesn't seem correct. How do you drive inside the terminal? What gives you the right?"" This was my first recognition that something was off about this helper figure. I knew something was off with him/strange.

# Part 4: The Missed Flight and Lucifer's Offer

I ran around the airport looking for my gate, accidentally entered a ladies' bathroom, and kept forgetting my carry-on trolley with the crucial research, having to go back for it multiple times. The helpful driver kept appearing, offering assistance. We ended up sitting at a coffee shop table. I insisted I needed to leave to catch my flight. He calmly told me, ""You've already missed your flight.""

I looked out the window and saw he was right - the plane to Singapore was gone. I said I'd go handle the rebooking. He responded, ""Don't worry, I can help you out. I'll figure it out with you how to carry on with life.""

# Part 5: The Lucid Moment and Black Urine

At this point, I had a lucid moment within the dream - I became aware I was dreaming about the airport and Lucifer. My reaction was, ""Oh wow, this movie is amazing. I want to get back into it."" I consciously chose to re-enter the dream.

After deciding to go back in, I went to the bathroom and started urinating black. I found this weird but rationalized it, thinking it must be from vitamins or iodine I'd taken - something I'd consumed intentionally in the dream. I explained away this obvious warning sign, or negative energy leaving my body.

# Part 6: The Trap and Recognition

It jumps back to sitting and having coffee with the driver, when conversing, I realized that he was actually Lucifer – I remember smirking, thinking “Im not scared, im fine” - he noticed the smirk and asked“what up?” he asked, I replied “nothing”, fully knowing who he was and what he was doing. I did not feel scared but rather intrigued.  The dream ""split"" - suddenly I realized this had all been a trap. I was actually trying to capture him because ""he had some information."" My team appeared and confronted him whilst we were sitting, creating a circle around him, demanding the information. He refused. We tried to kill him and get police to arrest him, but they couldn't.

# Part 7: The Theft

Lucifer (the original calm driver) killed the cop who tried to stop him and told me ""let's go, let's run"" and to follow him - though he actually just disappeared without telling me where he was going. That's when I realized: he had taken my carry-on trolley - the one containing all my research, all the data I was trying to escape with.

Crucially, within that research was supposed to be ""the way to kill him, kill the negativity, or kill the devil."" The devil had stolen the very weapon that could destroy him.

# Part 8: The Blood Fusion

I panicked and ran to the garage. I saw the suitcase and think I knocked him out, though the sequence becomes unclear. Then one of my female classmates/teammates managed to get the bag and started taking it down an escalator, running away.

The devil regained consciousness and saw her escaping with the bag. Using his powers, he converted someone else into a form of himself to try to take the bag back. But my teammate recognized this impostor.

She did something extraordinary: she merged her blood with the devil's impostor form through tubes that went from her arm into its arm - like a handcuff fusion. She explained this meant ""wherever you go now I go, because I'll be able to follow you and understand everything and see."" The tubes went directly into the flesh, creating a permanent blood-level connection.

# Part 9: The Two Devils and The Forest Home

After the blood fusion, there were now two manifestations: the original Lucifer upstairs (the sophisticated calm driver) was ""very angry, very upset"" about losing control through the blood fusion.

But down below, the girl who created the fusion was ""very calm"" and started conversing with the form she was attached to. She said, ""This is my home in the forest and my husband is there fishing with friends."" She described a simple, grounded life - a forest home where her husband fishes - while remaining calmly connected to the devil's form through the blood fusion.

That's where the dream ended.  
  
**Background Information**  
I'm a 40-year-old man going through what feels like a significant psychological transition. I've been recognizing patterns of operating from a sophisticated false self, being everyone's emotional container (Wounded Healer), and endless preparation without action (Puer Aeternus). I recently ended a complex relationship where I had projected my anima onto someone, and I'm now sitting in what feels like a void or nigredo phase.  
  
This dream occurred in a single night and I can still recall it with great clarity till date. I am non-Christian, so the Lucifer symbolism feels psychological rather than religious. I'm particularly curious about the blood fusion the feminine figure creates and the 'forest home' ending",1,1765486415.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False

**Part One - Two Grand Richer**

Richard Martin is a prevalent lawyer from Aldie, Virginia. I met him at the wedding of a former client, who invited me out of sincere gratitude for my services. We didn't talk much, he thought I was nothing more than a scam, even as the groom praised my work and thanked me endlessly for saving his life. I wasn't phased by the accusations, but ironically enough, that same man who called me a sham would eventually find himself tear-stricken on the other end of a phone call not a month later, pleading to me to save him from a demon in the woods.

It was 1pm on a Tuesday afternoon, even still the phone call startled me awake from the back of my 2013 Jetta, which had been converted into a makeshift bed. Sunlight pierced my eyes as they strained to adjust and my brain slowly comprehended the ringtone of my phone, which had slipped between the car seats. I managed to retrieve my phone just in time to answer the call, wincing in pain at my bandaged hand. Not recognizing the number, I gave your standard introductory script.  
""Hello, this is Konstantin Walker?"" -My father had high expectations for me since birth-  
""Hi-yes-hello? This is the exorcist guy, right?"" The voice on the other end I recognized to be Mr. Martin, sounding shaken.  
""'Exorcist Guy' is certainly...a word for it.""  
""This is Richard Martin, William's lawyer, remember?""  
""Yes, Mr. Martin, how can I help you?""  
""...Look, I still don't know if you're real or not, or if you played William for a fool, or if you actually are what you say, but I'm out of options that don't make me look less foolish. I am staying in a family cottage up in Pennsylvania, and I believe to be bewitched by something....supernatural.""

Mr. Martin begins to explain in loose detail the events of the last few nights, most of which I already knew. He and his ""friend"", a young model straight from a Vogue magazine, were staying at Martin's lake house in Pennsylvania, which had been built along the Susquehanna river and was heavily secluded from the prying eyes of the press. Martin was intending to take a break from a pretty nasty legal battle he was in with another client while his wife traveled down to visit family in Georgia.  
According to him, the first incident of abnormality was within the first few hours of arrival. He had finished unloading his van and was chatting up his ""friend"" on the balcony of his lake house when a racoon fell from a large tree whose branches draped over the house. It landed right on the railing in front of Martin, but it took him a moment to realize it was a racoon because the unfortunate creature appeared to have been completely skinned, its organs and entrails having dispersed on impact as the two obvious lovers were splattered in it's blood. The Model screamed and ran into the house to rid herself of the bile as Martin instinctively looked up to where the racoon had fallen, only spotting a second racoon, curiously staring at him with emerald eyes.  
The situation only continued to escalate, though not until the dead of night. They had decided to calm their nerves with a nice session of copulation, how a Vogue model found the entanglement with a 65 year-old man pleasurable in any way is beyond me. In the midst of their pleasure, Martin's heart sank to his stomach as he hears the irate voice of his wife outside, screaming accusations of infidelity as her voice approaches the bedroom window. Large thick curtains were drawn over the window, so the entangled duo hastily separated, the model disappearing into another room, as Martin stormed over to the window in anger and confusion. His furious questions as to how she was even here were cut short as he ripped open the curtains; through the window, silhouetted by the moonlight on the lake, was a 7-foot tall figure standing 30 feet away from the house. Darkness unnaturally concealed the figure's entire body, as if their form was shadow itself, but the figure looked masculine, completely nude, and there was an eerie sense that he was staring directly at Martin.  
Fear-stricken and silently awaiting for the man to move, Martin closed the blinds. It was only, but immediately after Martin's view of the man was entirely obscured that Martin heard the shattering of glass from a distant room in the house, followed shortly by the model's screams. Almost instinctively, Martin raced out of the bedroom, continuing to hear the screams as a series of 'thuds' are heard. When he finally finds the room she's in, he finds her completely unconscious, blood swelling from a small abrasion across her forehead. And yet, even with her limp, unconscious body in front of him, Martin continued to hear the model's screams, but it wasn't from the model. In the corner of the room, staring at Martin with anger in his emerald eyes, was a racoon, mimicking the screams of the model at Martin.  
Terrified, Martin raced the way he came, hearing the racoon scamper after him as he retreated into his room and slammed the door shut. He pinned himself against the door as he began to hear something bang furiously on the door; not the racoon, the impacts were high on the door and sounded as if a human was punching the door on the other side.  
""*Heeeeeelllp. Someone pleeease!""* \- the model's voice rasped from the other side of the door, followed by a menagerie of voices as the entity seemed to try different ways to convince Martin to open the door.

This lasted 3 hours.

After 3 grueling hours of holding off this fiend, the voices stopped, the banging stopped, the air was silent. Martin sat in this silence, penetrated only by his own breathing. Finally, Martin took a solemn moment to de-stress, slumping against the door. Even with the threat seemingly vanished, Martin could not help but feel watched. And as Martin anxiously scanned his surroundings, his eyes finally caught sight of an emerald eye peering from a crack in the curtains.  
As soon as Martin saw it, the window curtains lurched forward as glass shattered; the entity had punched through the glass. But as Martin flinched and anticipated his end with a shrill scream, nothing came. Martin looked back to the window, and the figure was gone.

I had set the phone off to the side on speaker, only half listening to Mr. Martin's perspective as I slowly dressed myself and prepared my equipment for the upcoming cleansing of the lake house. I hadn't realized he had finished until I heard a long pause before:  
""....Mr. Walker?"" he asked expectantly  
""Yes, sorry. I'm just... taking in the details. I'm so sorry this has happened. You said this was Sunday? Monday night?""  
""Sunday night. I was hoping it would be a one-night occurrence, but they returned the next night. This time the thing just started shouting in different voices from the woods and staring ominously at me from afar. I can't get the police involved and my friend has left for home, I might do the same-""  
""No. You are dealing with a standard Skinwalker Mr. Martin.""  
\-a pause of comprehension-""A what?""  
""A shaman of dark magic that can shapeshift into animals and even people by stealing their skin.""  
""You're mad, this is nonsense!""  
""If you truly thought so you wouldn't have called. Now, if you leave now, the shaman will follow. It means to steal your life and identity, and each day it remains nearby, it will slowly learn more and more about you until it steals your skin and becomes indistinguishable to you.""  
""So what do I do!?""  
""I'm currently in Scranton, I can be there in an hour. We'll need to cleanse the property so it can not enter and then cleanse you so the Skinwalker can no longer harm you.""  
""And given what I've heard of you, I assume you expect payment for this?""  
""We can discuss payment based on the severity of the situation. Send me your address and I will be on my way.""

I hop on the road over before he even sends me the address and I arrive by 4pm, the already-setting sun accentuating the bronze autumn leaves of the massive tree that towers over the 2-story lake house. Mr. Martin is standing at the door as I arrive, smoking a cigarette with a look of annoyed regret; he already thinks it was a bad idea to call. I walk up and shake his hand as I carry in my leather bag of equipment. He invites me in, offers me coffee which I graciously accept, and he sits at a large oval table in the kitchen as I place the bag on it and ruffle through the contents.  
""Let's cut to the chase, no sugar-coating it. How much are you asking for?"" He asks sternly.  
""Well, given the size of the property and from what you've told me about the Skinwalker, we'll start at 500 for the initial cleansing and another 2k if it's successful-""  
""Two thousand?!"" -He interrupted, frustratingly appalled  
""The 500 is for the resources I use to cleanse you and the area and the 2k is for if I successfully save your life from this shaman.""  
He takes a moment, no doubt contemplating everything he's gone through and weighing the costs. Understanding his frustration, I try to cut a deal.  
""Look, because you're a first-time client, I'll drop the initial payment. You only have to pay me if this works, how's that?""  
""You have returning customers?""  
""Sometimes the same person will encounter a multitude of these entities, it's pretty common.""  
Another pause of contemplation, before-""Fine, two thousand, but *only* if your voodoo works.""  
Rather than clarify the distinction between West-African voodoo and Navajo magic, I respond with an outstretched hand and we shake on the deal.

It only took a half hour to finish all the defenses. The bulk of the ward was made of incense, I placed fancy-looking agarbatti stands in each room, each with an incense stick that filled the area with a pungent odor, but one Mr. Martin would not be able to smell. Since the attack, Martin had covered the two broken windows with cardboard flats, so I took two dream catchers made of river birch and tacked them to each, and placed others at the different entrances around the house. I gave Martin his own ward, it was a weave of river birch emulating an expulsion ward made into a bracelet with silver beads along the strap, which I wrapped around his wrist. Last thing I did was burn some incense around the perimeter. I hate the smell, but I had to be thorough.  
When I finished, I gave him the rundown. The incense burned around the house set the perimeter; you won't be able to smell it, so best not go outside at all. The skinwalker will only be able to enter the area if it was in the area when the perimeter was set, so unless it's hiding somewhere close, you shouldn't have an issue. The dream catchers should ward your mind from the skinwalker, which won't allow it to use new voices from your past, but will still allow it to use the voices and memories it's already used. **Do not go outside** for any reason and **do not speak to it**, don't give it more to work with. If all else fails, the ward on your wrist should repel the skinwalker, whether it's the river birch or the silver. He agreed to everything and told me he'd call tomorrow morning. With that, I packed up my things and left, telling him the skinwalker won't attack if I'm there.

As I left, Martin decided to get some early sleep, wanting to make sure he was wide awake from when the creature inevitably returned. He went to sleep around 5pm, and when he woke up, it was almost 1am. He woke up with a start, frustrated he was out for so long, but soon realized he had woke to a sound. Outside, he heard a voice screaming and pleading for help nearby. My voice.  
""*Martin! Martin please! The thing's here, it's in the fucking incense!*""  
Martin scrambled out of bed, quickly grabbing the rifle as he tried to locate where I was. He eventually made his way to the front door, hearing my cries from the other side.  
""Walker? Is that you?"" He whispered.  
""*Yes please god open the door!*"" I cried out.  
""I thought you left"" His back was towards the door, ear pressed against it as he slowly stretched up to peer through a circular window in the door.  
""*Martin, open the door, now!*"" I started banging on the door  
As Martins eyes made it to the door window, I wasn't there. He kept stretching up, seeing if I was hunched over. Instead, Martin saw a wolf, shaggy ash-grey fur with dried blood caking it in splotches, it's front paws against the door as the wolf slammed it's head against it repeatedly, quickly, the head swinging as if loosely attached.  
""*It's just standing there, please!*"" My voice came from the wolf, but the mouth didn't move as it kept banging on the door. It suddenly stopped, staring at the door, before it's head cocked to the side, it's right eye, emerald green, staring directly up at Martin through the window.  
Horrified, Martin dropped to the floor, breathing heavily with terror with his back against the door, hugging the rifle.  
""*Is that you? I-I-Is that you-is that you? Is that you?*"" The skinwalker began mimicking Martin's voice, adjusting and shifting it's tone and pitch to better match. All the while continuing to banging on the door. Desperately, Martin decided to distance himself from the door, turn around kneeling, and aimed his rifle at the door.  
""\*Is that you? Is that you-is that-\****OPEN THE DOOR!***"" It continued before screaming in my voice.  
Finally, Martin shot the door, the bullet piercing the door and the sound silencing the air. Martin held his breath, waiting for a voice, a whisper, a sound.

""*Your wards are strong.*""

Finally, a voice-Martin's voice-gravelly whispered from the other side of the door.  
""*But time decays, age withers, sanity crumbles. Leave my ancestral home, take your things and run, or I will n e v e r stop. Time decays, age withers, but has no hold on the likes of I. This is your only warning.*""  
A slam, as if bucked by a horse, ripples the door and the footfalls of the wolf trail away. Martin, still poised in fear, drops to the floor with exhaustion and relief.

Martin would not sleep the rest of the night, he stayed awake before finally calling me at 6am with delight. He offered to pay me joyfully, even adding the original 500 to the payment. I listened intriguingly, always finding the other perspective humorous to listen to. But I already knew everything. Unbeknownst to Martin, the wolf ran for another half mile, stopping at the top of a hill looking down at the house. The wolf gagged, mouth agape as two hands-arms reached from inside the wolf, clasping the top and bottom jaw before spreading them open. The jaw tore further and further, skin and muscles tearing and blood splattering everywhere as the wolf was practically split in two. And as they did, I stepped out, blood soaking my underclothes and face. I took a calming breath as I closed my eyes and basked in the moonlight above. I then looked down at Martin's house before turning to leave with a smile, knowing full-well I am now two grand richer than the night before.

This Costa Rican natural is the only one I’ve opened so far of the 3 and I am really enjoying it. Definitely picking up the light grape flavor. I like that Queen City seems to find a great balance of what I call “classic coffee flavor” mixed well with the tasting notes. All while still being a relatively lighter roast.

Middle State is a favorite of mine as well. Kenya SL28 and SL34 is one of the first varietals of specialty coffee I ever experienced some 10 years ago, so I know I had to pick this bag up when I saw it.

Matched with a girl on hinge in October. Didn’t really think much of it because she was in a different state. A few weeks later she responded and asked for my instagram. A few weeks after that she messaged me referencing a story I posted. We ended up having a 4 hour long back and forth over text where I felt like we really hit it off. But we didn’t continue talking every day. Had a few similar chats over the course of November. 

In December she asked if I’d like to chat on the phone sometime and I agreed. Ended up chatting for two and half hours the next night and it went really well. We had a lot more in common than I expected.

Since then we’ve been chatting more. Almost every day but not like all day texts threads. I’ve been trying  to be careful about talking too much and creating false closeness. 

She floated the idea of going on a short international trip together as a first date. Said she normally won’t even go on a dinner date with someone as a first date and requests only coffee or park dates to get a read on the guy so she can bail if she’s uncomfortable. I offered just flying to her and doing a coffee/ park date so she didn’t have to over invest but after a week of considering she doubled down and we ended up booking the trip.

I’m sitting here in my room, door shut and locked, soaked to the bone from my run home since I left my jacket in the car. The RCA clock radio on my nightstand just struck midnight, so now it’s November 22nd, 1963.                                                       

I first saw her at Damien’s Car Emporium on Wilson Avenue in August. I’d saved up my money from the past two summers and I needed wheels. The Schwinn 3 speed I’d been pedaling around since Christmas of ‘57 had been solid, but it was time to move up in the world. My sneakers crunched the gravel of the lot as I walked past the row of shiny new Corvettes, a row of rainbow colored spaceships gleaming in the summer sun. I made my way to the used lot at the back, not really sure what I was looking for but knowing that I didn’t have dough for anything too flashy. I walked past tailfin after tailfin, Fairlane 300s, an old Mercury Eight that someone had chopped when Ike was still president, a fierce looking Plymouth fury in a custom red over white. I stopped to admire it, but there was no way I could afford it so I moved on, that’s when I saw her. At the back of the lot, under the shade of an old maple tree, sat a 1958 Pontiac Star Chief four door. Her body, which had probably been metallic rio red from the factory, was now closer to a faded salmon, but to me she was the most beautiful thing I’d ever seen.       

Thirty minutes later I was cruising down Wilson Avenue behind the wheel of my own machine, with three hundred bucks still in my pocket. I switched on the radio as I was turning onto my home street and got Ritchie Valens singing “We Belong Together”. Gosh it still tears me up that he went out like that.  
The next few months were a bittersweet blur of homework, late night cruises, getting grounded, sneaking out, and getting into and out of the normal trouble that I guess every senior expects from their last year in high school. Eva was at the center of it all, and I understood why I’d gotten her so cheap. I spent so much time under that car my folks thought I was married to her. I don’t know why I picked the name. It just felt right, like it belonged to her.

  
As much as I adored my Eva, she would behave in ways I wasn’t expecting. It was never anything big, and she never left me stranded, but you get problems when you buy a used car I suppose. I was cruising around a few weeks after bringing her home looking for something to do when the emerald lights on the dash started flickering. It was almost like they were winking at me through the glass. A moment later it was like nothing had happened, the soft gleam showed my speedometer hovering right above 35 and the odometer rolling past 66,000 miles. The next day I replaced the bulbs and looked over the wiring for any frayed connections and when I couldn't find anything I moved on. It was normal for a while, but her winking never really went away.           

 By November my hard work had paid off, and Eva was as healthy as she’d been in the GM factory. I was amazed nobody had advertised the Tri-Power she had under the hood, but I was certainly grateful that they hadn’t because she purred beautifully through those dual Cherry Bombs. I had myself a bona-fide street beast and she was my pride and joy. She was the envy of my pals too, and I was more than happy to spend extra time behind the wheel driving them all over town to the movies, drive-ins, diners, anywhere we pleased. After all you can get pretty far when gas is a quarter and coffee’s a dime.

  
Still, there were times when she’d get uppity, those three carbs were a pain to get tuned right, and there would be times where she’d bog down and stall for no reason, then fire right up again almost before I’d even turn the key. Her radio was finicky too, sometimes I couldn’t catch anything on the dial, and sometimes I’d get weird stuff that I’d never heard before. Some band called The Beatles? I’d never heard anything like it and I figured it must have been some college DJ messing around on the airwaves during the slow hours. I found Eddie Cochran singing about his “Rock n’ Roll Blues” and kept cruising.    

 Tonight, or last night I guess, one of my friends telephoned the house to ask if I could come out that night to a party happening at Jackie’s house. It was a school night so my folks didn’t want me to go, but I begged and pleaded until they let me go. It started raining hard almost as soon as I got off my street and started making my way across town. I don’t remember much of the actual drive, almost like I was sleepwalking. Before I knew it I was parked at the bank overlooking the drive-in at the outskirts of town. The radio clicked on, and The Platters honey tones started filtering through the static, singing “Only You, and You Alone”. The car felt warm, inviting, and seductive. I felt myself drifting off before something snapped me out of my trance. There was an arm wrapped around my shoulder, soft and warm under an angora sweater. The hairs on my neck stood up in fear as I slowly looked towards the passenger seat with a trembling glance. A glance that met the tender, longing gaze of a pair of soft, emerald eyes.                                                                                                                                                                         I don’t think Eva wanted me to go to that party. I think she wanted me all for herself.",1,1765485799.0,creepcast,1,0.67,False

I don't think I can change it but if your having fun do what you want to do! Grind, fish train whatever. This an informative post geared towards new players. I am not discouraging playing the game as the post actually explains. The title is meant to be catchy. 


So I realized a lot of people are in disbelief about earning potentials with horse training. So I'm going to do a simple break down for you. This is not an in depth min max guide. I'm simply going to show you the pond exists. It's up to you to walk to it and drink. The resources already exist on YouTube and Reddit but I encourage you to come to your own conclusions on the best way to do this process. 

We're going to use BlueSquadrons sheet which is a pretty good representation of earning potentials through grinding based on your AP. You can access the sheet through his video here: https://youtu.be/AQ1UxgzD7RY?si=34svbaxN1IWPa_ub

Until you reach around 1265 AP your earning potential through grinding is south of 1.2 bil an hour and some of that varies with drops. i.e. some hours are 1.5 bil others are 0.9 and so on and that is already having a pretty significant investment into your combat gear. 

The absolute minimum you can earn in liquid silver per hour doing active horse training is 1.2 billion silver. That is the MINIMUM. Raw silver in your pocket. No market involvement. Ill briefly explain. 

With horse training you can attach 4 horses to a wagon followed by a 5th horse. The minimum value you can obtain for a horse selling it to the vendor is 20 million silver. That means you make 100 million silver for one batch or horses and it takes you less than 5 minutes. Your limiting factor here is actually server swapping. 

Extrapolate that to an hour and you can complete 12 batches of horses at 100 million per batch that's 1.2 bil for a VERY LOW apm grind. I'm talking watching anime WITH subtitles. Drinking your coffee while it's still hot instead of making it, sitting down to grind, and forgetting its there to take a cold sip an hour later. 

And that's just active income. You think AFK fishing is good? Horse training AFK earns double if not triple the return given a 24 hour period. 

Average afk fishing over 24 hours yield about 2.2 billion silver. Depending on your mastery and what horses you train you can make 12 T8s in 24 hours which have a minimum return of 4.8 billion. Minimum. Not included coursers or imperial steeds or seals I'm talking raw silver. 

This isn't a trade secret. A lot of people are doing it. And this post might make some people mad because any good thing that becomes public becomes ruined but there's two factors here as to why I'm doing it. 

1. Majority of this income is from the vendor directly. So if no one ever bought a horse again I would still make 1.2 bil an hour minimum while active and a worst case scenario of 2.4 billion for afk if I vendored my T8s. 

2. It's extremely new player friendly. You don't need gear at all to make 1.2 bil an hour. All you need is a wagon. And if you want to splurge buy the peridot wagon for 2 bil from the market and you're good to go. 

TL:DR Active horse training makes 1.2 billion liquid silver per hour minimum. Afk horse training is 4.8 billion for 24 hours. This is not a guide but they exist. I've told you the pond exists. Go figure out how to drink. Super new player friendly no gear requirement!",0,1765485633.0,blackdesertonline,39,0.1,False

She told me she would love to see me again and agreed to meet with me this coming weekend.

The next day, we confirmed the place and time and told me that worked. We sent a few messages, she sent me some funny gifs/memes, and I eventually asked her how her day was going so far. Then it was crickets and I didn't get a response back. A few days ago, I just sent a simple ""Hey, I just wanted to let you know that I hope your day is going great so far and work isn't too busy"" and still nothing.

Our confirmed date is coming up, and I don't know if it is still going to happen. I know she said she has some sort of test coming up and she was studying and on top of that I know she is busy at work. But a simple response like ""thanks hope yours is going well too"" or just some acknowledgment would have been nice.

1pk8aso,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1pk8aso/i_should_have_never_looked_in_the_mirror_in_my/,I Should Have Never Looked in the Mirror in My Apartment!,"Look in a mirror right now.  
Now imagine that for just one second… the person staring back isn’t you anymore.

I didn’t think that was possible either, until the mirrors in my apartment stopped behaving like one.  
I’m hoping someone here has seen anything like this before, because I really don’t want to be the only person going through it.  
I need someone who actually understands what’s happening.  
Something in my apartment’s mirrors isn’t acting the way it should.

Before you think I’m joking or sleep deprived, let me explain how this started.  
And to do that, I need to tell you a little bit more about me and where I live.

My name is Seth Morrow. I live in a small rental apartment on the edge of Asheville, North Carolina, an old brick building that creaks when the temperature changes and smells faintly of pine from the forest behind it. It’s a small one bedroom, living room in the front, a narrow kitchen off to the side, and a short hallway that leads to the bathroom and the bedroom at the end. I moved in two months ago to be closer to work. The place isn’t perfect, but it’s quiet, and quiet felt good.

Or it did.

I didn’t pick Asheville because it was peaceful. I picked it because it was practical. My old commute was killing my evenings, and when a colleague mentioned an open unit on the edge of town, close to work, next to a trail network, I took it. I’ve never been picky about where I live. Four walls, hot water, somewhere to put my keys. That’s usually enough.

Those first few weeks felt normal in the best possible way. Wake up, coffee, shower, work. Come home, heat something from the freezer, watch a bit of TV, try to sleep.

On weekends, I’d sometimes take a short walk on the forest path behind the building. The air smelled cleaner there. Sharper. A little resinous. Pine, probably. Sometimes I’d take the car out instead and drive down to Hendersonville to see my family for a few hours. It was only a short trip, an easy excuse to get out of the apartment. And on quieter nights, the breeze coming off the trees would drift right through my open windows. It reminded me that life doesn’t need much to feel calm.

I had no warning that anything was wrong.

Just small things at first, nothing dramatic, nothing anyone would think twice about. A creak in the pipes, the fridge humming unevenly, the soft scrape of my upstairs neighbor dragging a chair. The sort of sounds old buildings make to remind you they’re alive.

I settled into a routine. At work I handled inventory for a small outdoor gear shop downtown, a job that requires quiet focus but not much conversation. Still, I got along with most people there. Especially Evan.

He was new too. Started a week after I moved. Friendly in a low key way. He’d laugh at the same dumb things I laughed at during stocking shifts. We’d sometimes grab a sandwich from the café across the street before heading home.

Nothing deep. Just a decent coworker becoming a decent friend.  
The point is, life was boring in a comfortable way. Normal, predictable.

Then the mirror incidents began.

The first incident was small enough. I was brushing my teeth before work, half awake, leaning toward the bathroom mirror. As I spat into the sink, I saw my reflection blink. Nothing strange about that, except I hadn’t blinked. Not yet. Mine followed half a second later.

I stared at myself. Maybe I misread it. Maybe I blinked without noticing. Morning fog in the brain, nothing dramatic. I finished getting ready and left it alone.

At work that day, the incident kept creeping in my brain. Not obsessively, just the kind of thought that returns every few hours like an itch. I tried describing it to myself in plain terms. Maybe you twitched. Maybe it was your peripheral vision. Maybe you’re tired.

But the rhythm of it kept replaying in my head. A blink is such a simple action. You don’t forget the timing of it.  
I didn’t tell anyone. Didn’t want to sound ridiculous obviously.

That weekend, I tried to forget about it. I slept in, made coffee, tried to treat it like any other slow morning. But when I walked past the bathroom door, something made me glance at the mirror again. Not to check, just a passing look.

My reflection wasn’t doing anything strange. No blinking, no delay. But its posture caught my attention. I was mid step, turning slightly toward the kitchen. In the mirror, I looked like I’d already finished the turn. A fraction ahead of me.

The difference was tiny. The kind of thing you could blame on angle or motion blur. But it didn’t feel like that. It felt deliberate. Like it adjusted before I did.

I stood there for a few seconds, testing small movements, tilting my head, shifting my shoulders. Everything lined up perfectly again, as if it had corrected itself the moment I paused.

I told myself it was nothing. Just weekend grogginess. But the oddness followed me the rest of the day, sitting at the back of my mind like a misplaced word I couldn’t stop searching for.

A couple days later, it happened again while I was combing my hair before work. I leaned closer to the mirror to fix the back and caught the movement in the corner of my eye. My reflection straightened a fraction earlier than I did. It was subtle, but unmistakable.

I blamed the warped mirror. The building is old, the glass probably bowed or uneven. Refraction does odd things sometimes. I even took the mirror off the wall to check the backing. A metal plate, solid, undamaged. I wiped it down, remounted it, and tried not to think about it again.

It stuck with me this time. At work I felt off balance all day. I kept glancing at the small mirror mounted behind the register, checking it every time I passed. Nothing strange happened, which only made me feel more self conscious.

Eventually, during lunch, I mentioned it to Evan. Not in a dramatic way, more like a random complaint.  
“Hey, weird question,” I said. “Do mirrors ever lag?”

He looked up from his sandwich. “Lag?”  
I replied in a thoughtful manner, “You know… you move, and the reflection looks a little off?”  
He snorted. “Sounds like your apartment’s haunted!”  
I rolled my eyes. “Yeah. Okay!”

He softened and said, “Seriously though, old glass does that. Especially the really old stuff. Before they used float glass manufacturing, the sheets were never perfectly flat. You’d get these tiny waves in the surface that made reflections look stretched or slightly delayed. My grandmother’s house had a couple of those antique mirrors. If you moved even a little, the reflection sort of bent. Nothing lined up right.”

I raised an eyebrow. “When did you become an expert on glass?”  
He smiled. “I’m not. I just grew up in a house full of old, uneven things.”

It made sense. Enough sense that I let myself lean on that explanation.  
For a day or two.

But once you notice a pattern, your mind refuses to let it stay quiet.

The next morning I tested it deliberately. I raised my hand slowly toward the mirror. My reflection moved with me, until, just before my hand reached the glass, the reflected hand paused, as if unsure how close it should be. Only for an instant. But the pause was real. It felt like someone trying to match timing and missing by a fraction.

I told myself I needed more sleep.

That day at work I didn’t bring it up again. But Evan noticed I was quieter.  
“You good?” he asked while restocking headlamps.  
“Just tired,” I said.

He nodded, not prying. One reason we got along, he kept things simple.

But as the day went on, I kept replaying the mirror’s hesitation. The tiny pause. The strange uncertainty in my own reflection. It wasn’t dramatic. It was too controlled for that.  
That was what bothered me most. It felt intentional.

For the next week I avoided the bathroom mirror as much as I could. In fact I covered it with a bath towel so I wouldn’t have to look at it even by mistake. I shaved using touch, splashing water by guesswork, anything to keep my eyes off the glass. It made me feel ridiculous, but something about facing my reflection directly made my throat tighten, even if nothing dramatic happened. It wasn’t fear. It was the sense that I was being watched back.

During that week, little things shifted.  
I started leaving earlier for work just to avoid looking in the mirror. I started brushing my teeth leaning away from the sink. I’d bump into corners, misplace objects.  
And I felt stupid. Completely stupid.

That’s what pushed me to act.

On Monday, my first real chance after a weekend of fussing, I asked Evan after closing if he could swing by the apartment. “Just to check something,” I said, trying not to sound embarrassed.  
He raised a brow. “Something wrong?”  
“I just want another pair of eyes.”  
He agreed.

We drove over together after grabbing dinner. Asheville nightlife hummed faintly in the distance, but the forested edge of my building was quiet. My place smelled like dust and faint pine.

I walked him to the bathroom, peeled off the towel I’d draped over the mirror earlier, and waited.

“Okay,” he said. “What am I looking for?”  
“I don’t know,” I said honestly.

He stared at our reflections for a good minute. Made faces. Raised eyebrows. Tilted his head left and right.

“Well,” he said finally. “It’s a mirror.”  
“No lag? No weird movement?” I asked.  
“Looks normal to me.”

He patted my shoulder. “You probably scared yourself the first time. Happens.”

I tried to believe him. I wanted to.

He stayed for a beer, joked about how I owed him for “ghost inspection duty,” and left around nine. As he pulled out of the parking lot, he stuck his head out the window and yelled,  
“If the mirror eats you, I get your camping gear!”

I laughed. A real laugh, not forced.

When his taillights disappeared around the corner, the apartment felt different again. The silence wasn’t peaceful this time. It sat in the rooms like something waiting for me to acknowledge it. Even the familiar creaks of the building seemed muted, as if the place were holding its breath.

I tried to shake it off. Made a cup of tea. Put on a show I’d seen a dozen times. Anything to let the normal rhythm of the night settle back in. For a little while, it helped. I even started convincing myself that Evan was right, that I’d just worked myself into a corner over nothing.

But the reassurance didn’t last. Every time I moved past the bathroom doorway, the mirror caught my attention in a way I couldn’t explain. A quiet pull in the back of my mind, like the room was waiting for me to look again.

Eventually I couldn’t ignore it anymore.

I went back into the bathroom and stood in front of the mirror, relaxed my shoulders, and simply breathed. Slow in, slow out. My reflection did the same. Perfectly synchronized.

Good.  
I felt silly for worrying.

Then I exhaled sharply, just once.  
To my utter shock, the reflection, however, exhaled twice.

I stepped back so fast I hit the counter behind me. The reflection stepped back at the same moment, not mirroring my movement, but copying the speed, like a partner in a dance who had finally learned the routine. There was no expression on its face beyond my own. Just… how do I explain this? Timing. Timing that didn’t belong to me.

For the first time, I understood what was happening. It wasn’t imitating me. It was learning me.

I covered the bathroom mirror immediately. This time with printer paper and packing tape, a crude barrier, but it felt like doing something. It rustled faintly as the adhesive settled, but after that the apartment grew quiet again.

The rest of the night blurred into a mess of pacing between the bathroom and the kitchen, trying to make sense of anything. My mind kept telling me what Evan told me, old glass, weird angles, sleep deprivation. But the moment of the double exhale replayed in my head over and over, clear as if it were still happening. There had been no mistake. No optical illusion. It had responded. Twice.

Eventually the exhaustion caught up with me. I lay down without meaning to, still fully dressed, telling myself I’d just rest my eyes for a minute. I don’t think I was asleep for more than five minutes when I woke to a soft sound.

A dry crinkle. Paper shifting. Not peeling, just moving, as if something brushed lightly against the surface from behind.

I held my breath and listened. Another sound. A subtle push from the backside of the taped mirror. Then stillness.

I didn’t sleep again after that. I sat on the edge of the bed and waited for morning like a kid waiting for thunder to stop. My thoughts kept stuttering in short, uncomfortable loops, never settling on anything for more than a second. I kept reaching for my phone, thinking I should call Evan, just to hear somebody awake on the other end. But what was I supposed to tell him? That my bathroom mirror was practicing how to push? Even imagining the words made me put the phone back down.

And I didn’t dare go into the bathroom.

The doorway was right there, only a few feet from the bed, a darker rectangle in the dim room. Even without seeing the mirror itself, the idea of that taped paper shifting again made my stomach twist. I kept my eyes on the doorway, afraid that if I looked away, something else might happen in the space I wasn’t watching.

I gave myself another safe and tired suggestion. It was the building settling, the paper reacting to humidity. I stayed in bed until morning light crept through the blinds. Only then did I get up and approach the bathroom. The paper covering the mirror bulged outward slightly in one rounded spot, no bigger than the heel of a hand. When I pressed it gently, it flattened like normal paper. Nothing behind it. No hole. No intruder.

By now, nothing felt normal to me. I went to work in a daze. Evan noticed.  
“You look awful,” he said.  
“Didn’t sleep.”

He hesitated. “Is this about the mirror?”  
I nodded.

He looked at me carefully. “What happened after I left?”

I tried to answer, but the words stuck for a second. “It… did something weird,” I said finally.  
“Weird how?”

I rubbed the back of my neck, feeling stupid even before I spoke. “I went to check it again later. And when I breathed out, it…” I stopped, searching for the right phrasing. “It breathed twice.”

Evan blinked slowly. He wasn’t laughing, but he wasn’t sure he’d heard me right either.  
“Twice?”  
“Yeah.” I exhaled once, showing him. “I did that. And the reflection did it twice. Not at the same time. Not synced. Just…” I shrugged helplessly. “Wrong.”

He studied my face, trying to read whether I was joking or exhausted past sense. “And you’re sure you weren’t imagining it?”  
“I know what I saw,” I said quietly. “I covered the mirror right after.”

Evan nodded, polite and cautious, the kind of nod people give when they want to be supportive but not quite sold on the story. “Okay. Well… you probably overwhelmed yourself yesterday. It happens.”

I didn’t argue. I just nodded back.

He sighed. “You need to get someone qualified to check that place out. Maintenance, landlord, someone.”  
“I don’t think this is a maintenance thing,” I said, a little sharper than I meant to.

Evan’s expression shifted, not annoyed, just concerned. “You’re scaring yourself, man.”  
He wasn’t wrong. But he wasn’t right, either.

That day after I returned from work, I covered every mirror in the apartment, the hallway mirror, the mirrored closet door, even the small utility mirror I kept in a kitchen drawer. I taped them until each one was nothing but a blank white surface. If the entity needed a reflective surface to appear, then I’d give it nothing to use.

For the next couple of days, the apartment stayed silent.

The silence didn’t comfort me. It just made me hyper aware of every small shift in the apartment.  
The hum of the fridge.  
The tick of the baseboard heater.  
Wind moving through the trees outside.

I checked the taped mirrors multiple times a day.  
The paper stayed unmoved.  
I almost convinced myself I’d imagined everything.  
Almost.

At work just two days after the breathing incident, while stocking gear, I walked past the small mirror mounted near the fitting area. For a second my reflection looked normal, tired, but normal. But when I bent down to pick up a box, the reflection straightened a split second before I did. Just a fraction too early. Just enough to make me flinch.

I pretended I didn’t see it.  
I finished my shift with my eyes anywhere but mirrors.

Later, in the car, I caught myself in the rearview mirror. Not staring, just a glance, a normal glance. But the reflection held my eyes a split second longer than I held its. I jerked the mirror upward so it pointed at the ceiling and drove the rest of the way home with my throat tightening every time headlights passed behind me.

By the time I pulled into my parking spot, I was shaking.

I kept telling myself I was tired.  
Stressed.  
Losing my grip.  
Anything but the truth I didn’t want to name.

That night, the sounds began again.

First the bathroom.  
A gentle flex of taped paper.  
Then the hallway mirror.  
A second soft push.  
Then the bedroom closet.  
A third, slightly longer.

Each one independent.  
Each one slow.  
Each one deliberate.

Not tapping. Not knocking.  
Just the quiet movement of something learning how to push, not with force, but with control.

I stood in the dark hallway, listening to the shifting paper. None of the mirrors showed anything through the tape, but the sound alone told me enough. Whatever lived in the reflections hadn’t stopped when I covered the mirrors. It had simply continued practicing out of sight.

As I write this now, the apartment is silent again. But I keep thinking about the first mirror I covered, the bathroom one. That was the earliest surface the entity had access to. The place where it first learned to blink out of sync, then breathe out of sync, then move out of sync.

If it started in that mirror, then that’s where it’s strongest.

And that mirror is only six feet from where I’m sitting, close enough that I can hear every small shift whether I want to or not.

I’m afraid to take the tape down.  
I’m also afraid to leave it on.

I recently picked up a Vevor cockpit. Very pleasantly surprised, it's super sturdy and rigid especially for the price, handles the T818 without any issues — but one problem. No monitor mount. 

It shows a monitor mount configuration in the product image (below), so I thought at the very least, I'd be able to purchase it separately at a later date, but... nope!

Dug through the Vevor site and couldn't find anything like it. They have other rigs with monitor mounts, but they're tube metal and a totally different design altogether. 

I tried mounting my monitor (Samsung 34” Odyssey G5 1000R Ultrawide) using a gas shock arm directly to the wheel base mount, and that did not work for shit (as I expected). It was actually fine until you crashed, but then the 10nm of torque was enough to send that fucking thing flopping around, and with the power button on the bottom, it even turned itself off on more than one occasion 😂

  
Anyway, now I've got that same single gas shock arm attached to a spare coffee table next to the rig. It's functional, but it looks like ass and obviously kills the vibe.

So now, my options are:

* Buy some kind of universal monitor mount and try to adapt it to the rig
* Buy a free-standing monitor mount

I have my measurements and found a few universal mounts that might *kinda* fit... but I'm wondering if free-standing would just be less of a headache. 

There are types that somewhat attach to the base of the rig, and other ones that are wheeled.

Full transparency that I'm pretty low on budget at this point and trying to get this solved for under a hundred bucks. Found a couple options on eBay with wheels.

Anyone have experience trying either one of these routes? Pros/cons of each? 

Thanks everyone. Loving sim racing so far and the community has been pretty great.

1pk829x,https://www.reddit.com/r/bakingrecipes/comments/1pk829x/guiness_gingerbread_cookis_no_molasses/,Guiness Gingerbread Cookis: No molasses,"Guinness Gingerbread Cookies

These cookies are slightly chewy, warmly spiced, and deeply flavored, all without using molasses.

Every family has that one cookie that feels like Christmas, and for my mother, it was gingerbread. One year, she asked if I would bake some for the holidays. The only problem was that I have never liked molasses, so gingerbread simply was not something I made. Still, when your mother asks for something at Christmas, you find a way. 

So I began experimenting.

I already loved cooking and baking with Guinness, and reducing it reveals a deep, warm, caramel-like richness that echoes molasses without the sharp bitterness. It turned out to be the perfect foundation for a gingerbread cookie I could actually enjoy.

These cookies hold their shape well and have a perfect ginger kick. And even though I never liked traditional gingerbread, this version became a favorite. Best of all, my mother loved them.

Ingredients

Cookies

1 bottle Guinness stout, 11.2 ounces (330 ml)

2 and 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (300 g)

1 teaspoon baking soda

1 tablespoon ground ginger

1 teaspoon cinnamon

1/2 teaspoon cloves

1/2 teaspoon salt

1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened (113 g)

1/2 cup granulated sugar (100 g)

1/2 cup light brown sugar, packed (110 g)

1 large egg

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

2 teaspoons freshly grated ginger (4 g)

2 tablespoons crystallized (candied) ginger (20 g)

Optional Irish Cream Icing

1 cup powdered sugar (120 g)

1-2 tablespoons Irish cream
 

Method

Reduce the Guinness

Pour the full 11.2-ounce bottle of Guinness into a small saucepan.

Simmer gently until you have 2 ounces, which equals 4 tablespoons (60 ml). This usually takes about 15–20 minutes, depending on your stove and pan.

Keep an eye on it while it simmers so it does not reduce too far or burn. You do not need to stir it.

If you are unsure whether it has reduced enough, carefully pour it into a heatproof measuring cup, such as Pyrex, to check the volume.

If you have more than 2 ounces, return it to the saucepan and continue reducing.

If it over-reduces and becomes thick or sticky, stir in 1-2 teaspoons of hot water until it becomes a smooth, pourable syrup again. A small amount of water will not weaken the flavor.

The reduction will thicken slightly as it cools; measure by volume rather than appearance.

Let the reduction cool completely before using.

Make the dough
  
Very finely mince the crystallized (candied) ginger and set aside.  
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, ground ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and salt.  
In a large bowl, cream the softened butter with the granulated sugar and light brown sugar until light and fluffy.  
Beat in the egg and vanilla.  
Add the cooled Guinness reduction, the freshly grated ginger, and the crystallized (candied) ginger. Mix just until combined.  
Add the dry ingredients in two portions, and mix just until the dough comes together.

Chill

Gather the dough into a disk, wrap it well, and refrigerate. Chilling the dough overnight gives the best flavor and easiest rolling. If you are baking the same day, chill for at least 2 hours.

Longer chilling improves flavor, firms the dough, and helps the cookies keep their shape during cutting and baking.

Roll and Cut

Preheat the oven to 350°F (175 °C).

Lightly flour your surface and rolling pin, then roll the dough to about ¼-inch thickness. This is roughly the height of two stacked quarters.

Re-flour lightly as needed if the dough starts to stick. Avoid using too much flour, as it can change the cookie’s texture.

Cut into shapes or rounds. An inverted glass works well for rounds.

Transfer the cutouts to a parchment-lined baking sheet and chill them for about 10 minutes before baking. This helps prevent spreading while keeping the edges clean and sharp.

Bake 

Bake 8-10 minutes for slightly chewy cookies. The edges should look set, and the centers may still look slightly soft.

For crisp or structural cookies, bake 2-3 minutes longer. Do not exceed this, or the cookies may overbrown and become bitter.

Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 2 minutes, then transfer them to a rack to cool completely before icing.

The cookies will feel soft when they come out of the oven, but will firm up as they cool.


Irish Cream Icing

The cookies are delicious on their own, but the Irish cream icing is a nice optional addition for a holiday touch. 

Sift the powdered sugar into a small bowl so the icing is smooth and free of lumps.  
Whisk the sifted powdered sugar with 1-2 tablespoons of Irish cream until smooth.

Add more Irish cream for a thinner icing that drizzles easily, or add a little extra powdered sugar for a thicker consistency that holds its shape for piping.

Any leftover icing is great in coffee. It’s also wonderful drizzled on pancakes or French toast.

Ice the cookies only when they are completely cooled, or the icing will melt off.
 

Storage

 Store the cookies in an airtight container for up to one week.  
Baked cookies can be frozen, with or without icing, for 3-4 months.  
The dough can also be frozen for 3-4 months. Wrap it well, and thaw it in the refrigerator before rolling.

Note

Why three gingers
  
Using ground, fresh, and crystallized ginger gives these cookies layers of flavor. The ground ginger adds warmth, the fresh ginger adds brightness, and the crystallized ginger adds tiny, chewy pops of sweetness. I first learned about using ginger in multiple forms from chef Lorraine Pascale on one of the holiday baking shows, and it completely changed the way I approach ginger cookies. It creates a balanced and deeper ginger flavor without overwhelming the cookie.",1,1765484947.0,bakingrecipes,0,1.0,False

Then I realized our core product team is spread across California, Germany, India and me stuck in the middle-ish in Eastern Europe. On paper it looked ""global and exciting"". In reality, my calendar started to look like someone lost a game of Tetris. My mornings would start with 7 am standups so the folks in India didnt have to stay up past midnight, then a gap, then afternoon meetings to catch the European folks, and sometimes a 9 or 10 pm ""quick sync"" because it was the only slot that worked for the US. For the first few months I just said yes to everything, because I was the new hire and didnt want to be the Difficult Person. I was drinking way too much coffee, answering Slack in bed at 11:30, and my partner kept asking why I was always ""half at work"" even on weekends. The worst part was that nobody actualy forced this schedule on me - it just evolved because no one stopped to ask if it made sense. 

What weirdly helped was one random 1:1 with my manager where I showed my calendar and joked ""I think my time zone is a part time job on top of my real job."" He stared at it for a second and said ""Ok yeah, this is insane, why are you in half of these meetings."" That turned into a little experiment. We set two simple rules: 1) I block 11 pm to 7 am as ""hard no"" in the calendar, no matter what, and 2) each team gets one ""pain slot"" per week where the time is bad for them but good for everyone else, and we rotate who takes the hit. So one week the US folks stay later for the big planning call, the next week Europe gets the awkward time, the next week India does. On top of that I started using a super boring text template when people tried to book me at stupid hours: ""Hey, that time lands at 6 am for me and I wont be online yet, could we try between X and Y instead."" At first I felt guilty every time I sent it, like I was being lazy or uncooperative. But nobody snapped at me, alot of people just replied ""oh wow, I didnt realize, thanks for flagging."" I also stopped joining meetings where I was just a silent spectator and asked for a recording or notes instead. My sleep is still not perfect and there are still weeks where something urgent blows up and I am on a late call, but most of the time I now finish by 7 or 8 pm and I can actually eat dinner like a semi normal human. If anyone else is stuck in time zone limbo, highly recommend literally drawing your ""no work"" hours on the calendar and making other people see it - apparently they cant read your mind through Zoom.",5,1765484933.0,remotework,1,1.0,False

Skin issues can show up in many different ways, from mild dryness to intense itching, bites, rashes or even changes in color. Here are the most common problems Vetster vets see and what they usually mean.

**1.** [Dry flaky skin in dogs: ](https://vetster.com/en/wellness/how-to-prevent-dry-flaky-skin-in-dogs?utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=listicle&utm_content=rvetster)Dry flaky skin often looks like white flakes on the coat or scaly patches. It can come from low humidity, over washing, environmental irritation or early skin disease. You might see mild itching or dull coat.  
  
**2.** [Dog dandruff and dry skin:](https://vetster.com/en/wellness/what-to-do-if-your-dog-has-dandruff-or-dry-skin?utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=listicle&utm_content=rvetster) Dandruff causes larger, more noticeable flakes and may come with itching, redness or hair loss. It’s often linked to allergies or underlying skin irritation rather than dryness alone.

**3.**[ Dog allergies and itchy skin: ](https://vetster.com/en/wellness/spring-pollen-and-seasonal-allergies-in-dogs?utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=listicle&utm_content=rvetster)Allergies are one of the most common reasons dogs itch. Signs include constant scratching, chewing paws, red skin, watery eyes or repeated ear infections. Triggers may include pollen, dust, food or flea bites.

**4.**[ Skin color changes in dogs: ](https://vetster.com/en/wellness/what-causes-skin-color-changes-in-dogs?utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=listicle&utm_content=rvetster)Darkened or reddened skin usually happens after long term itching or inflammation. It’s a sign that something has been irritating the skin for a while, often allergies, infections or chronic licking.  
  
**5.** [Flea bites in dogs:](https://vetster.com/en/wellness/what-to-do-if-my-dog-keeps-getting-fleas-even-after-treatment?utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=listicle&utm_content=rvetster) Dogs can react strongly to flea saliva, leading to intense itching, red bumps and hair loss near the tail or back legs. Fleas may be hard to spot even if your dog is reacting to them.  
  
**6.** [Mange in dogs: ](https://vetster.com/en/wellness/what-to-do-if-your-dog-has-mange?utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=listicle&utm_content=rvetster)Mange is caused by microscopic mites that lead to hair loss, scabs, redness and severe itching. Some types spread easily to other pets. Diagnosis requires a vet, usually through skin scrapings.

**7.** [Ear mites in dogs: ](https://vetster.com/en/wellness/how-do-i-know-if-my-dog-has-ear-mites-and-what-can-i-do-about-it?utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=listicle&utm_content=rvetster)Ear mites cause dark debris that looks like coffee grounds, along with itching and head shaking. They are contagious and require vet prescribed parasite treatment.

If your dog is itching nonstop or you’re noticing new flakes, red spots or skin changes, taking photos and tracking symptoms for a few days can help your vet figure out what is going on.

1pk7vxd,https://apps.apple.com/no/app/sudoku-daily-brain-workout/id6748236600,I created a Sudoku app without knowing how to play Sudoku (iOS),"Hey everyone!

So I recently launched my Sudoku app:
Sudoku: Daily Brain Workout.

The funny thing is, when I started creating this project, I had basically never solved a Sudoku puzzle before. I've tried maybe two or three times, but gave up really fast. I didn't create this because I am some kind of Sudoku expert, but for myself to learn.

Building it helped me to understand how Sudoku really works, and why certain techniques actually matter, and how people can solve tougher puzzles. And along the way, I went from “I have no idea what I’m doing” to “okay wow… this is actually really fun”.

So after hundreds of coffee cups, months and months of coding, tweaking, breaking things, fixing things, the app is finally live:

📱 iOS App Store:https://apps.apple.com/no/app/sudoku-daily-brain-workout/id6748236600

A short description of the app:
* Daily Sudoku puzzles, a new board every day - with leaderboard for all who beat the daily puzzle.
* Multiple modes: Classic, Zen, and Hardcore.
* Three different difficulty levels.
* Explainable technique hints that actually tells you why a specific technique works (Naked Single, Hidden Single, Naked Pair, Hidden Pair, Pointing Pairs, Box-Line Reductions, X-Wing, etc.)
* Note mode, auto-cleaning notes, mistake tracking, undo/redo
* Stats, streaks, and a modern, clean UI

There are still things I am going to add, more solving techniques and different modes. But I’m really excited (and honestly very nervous) to finally share it with actual real Sudoku players, instead of just my own debugging brain.
If anybody here downloads and tries the app, I would love all type of feedback, both good and bad.

Thank you all for reading.

I tried to mix and match some itineraries I found here to fit my needs, but I already spent too much time with it and haven’t even started with Seoul one. 

This trip is happening last minute, so don’t judge please :)

Day 1:
* Arrive in Busan around 13:40, leave luggage at the station.
* Bus to Gamcheon Village — stroll, coffee, maybe snacks (recommendations welcome!).
* Nampo — late lunch/dinner, BIFF, Gukje Market, short walk around Jagalchi Market (tourist trap vibes).
* Optional: Yongdusan Park.
* Back to Busan Station, pick up luggage, head to hotel in Seomyeon.

Day 2:
* Early morning: go to Mipo Station to try buying Sky Capsule tickets (sold out online).
* If tickets are for 12:00–13:00, visit Haedong Yonggungsa Temple first.
* Sky Capsule ride, then take train or bus back to Mipo or Haeundae Beach.
* Dinner and evening walk.
* Back to Seomyeon for drinks/walk.

Day 3:
* Leave luggage at Busan Station.
* Visit Oryukdo Skywalk.
* Gwangalli Beach — walk, lunch, coffee.
* Afternoon: back to Busan Station and take KTX to Seoul.",2,1765484481.0,koreatravel,0,1.0,False

I cannot stop myself until it feels 'clean', I don't know how to say it other than that. If there are any 'pickable' pieces remaining I literally cannot relax until I got them off, to the point where my hands are shaking and bleeding, but it feels good like when you chew your lip or have a loose tooth that you dig into your gums. 

I'm in the middle of trying to study for finals but I've done a fourth of what I've wanted to accomplish in the last 3 hours because I've spent the majority of it picking at my hands. I'm so frustrated because I set aside this time to study and yet every time I try to focus I start picking at my hands again because it feels good and I know there's more to get. I'm at a coffee shop and I'm seriously thinking about walking all the way back home just to put band aids on my fingers so I'll be forced to stop and not see them, but I'm also able to focus less well at home than in a space without distractions not in my house. Even typing this, I've paused for several long minutes to pick at my hands. I feel like everyone is looking at me do it, I feel so weird but I just can't stop.

It happens too whenever I see my face in the mirror or look at my chest before I shower, picking at blemishes or scabs or pimples or anything for over an hour straight at times. But my hands are the worst because I'm always able to see those. They look so scarred and gross. I've done this and been embarassed about it for as long as I can remember, especially embarassed about it and unable to explain it as a kid.

1pk7s4j,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pk7s4j,How does this 5-day itinerary for Costa Rica look?,"Well, well Reddit, I’m putting together this itinerary and I’d love to hear what you think. Does this make sense for 5 days in Costa Rica?

Drive or take a tour to Arenal Volcano.

Walk the trails in Arenal Volcano National Park and admire the lava fields.

Relax in the natural hot springs nearby.

Optional: Zipline through the rainforest or take a hanging bridges tour.

Day 3: Monteverde Cloud Forest:

Visit the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve for wildlife spotting and scenic walks.

Explore local shops and cafés in Santa Elena town.

Optional: Night tour to see nocturnal animals.

Enjoy swimming, sunbathing, or surfing depending on your choice.

Watch the sunset and relax at a beachside restaurant before heading back.

But what do you think? Is this itinerary realistic for 5 days? Would you add or skip anything?",2,1765484238.0,BeautifulTravelPlaces,0,1.0,False

I really need support as I know it’s a day by day decision.

The innocent love I once had with us is gone and i wish so desperately I could get that innocent love back with him, that happiness and giggling feeling, the special feeling, the only girl feeling, the being ‘his’ girl that he’d hurt other girls to protect me feeling, I don’t think It will ever be the same. I know we can rebuild us I believe in us.  We’re doing really good right now in R but it’s not gonna be the same as it used to be, and I know this it’s obvious but it still hurts as I grieve the girl with that fairytale ending with him, I grieve that confident only girl in his eyes feeling, that I’m enough and I grieve that relationship we could’ve been.

I used to feel so special, so special that I trusted he’d protect me and I was enough for him to the point he didn’t want another, or he couldn’t even look at another girl because I was so special to him. That He’d protect me over another girl if she ever pushed herself onto him because he respects and sees me more beautiful and special than her, that no other girl could compare to his woman.

I keep trying to imagine myself in my WW shoes to be understanding for Him and to feed my brain that it was just a bad decision turned into one he deeply regrets and is remorseful, he’s doing everything in his power and checking all the green boxes in R. He really is trying and making effort he even called and talked to my mom she’s my everything and that meant a lot to me he knew this.

Im trying so hard but then once I try and imagine myself by looking at another guy and imagine doing the same things to him that he did to me, it breaks me down even more knowing all the multiple little choices he made that let it grow and get to the point he did to sleep with her, unprotected too. He couldn’t even value us enough to use a condom.

There were so many little choices day after day, that he knew it was wrong from the very beginning, he didn’t care enough about me to stop it, that’s what hurts is even I can acknowledge that, I know he knew it would hurt me, but him knowing that it would cause me pain didn’t bother him enough to stop, he kept letting it grow with her. He let it get this far. He knew the outcome and risk but he was more scared of communication than risking me over sex with another which is honestly crazy to me.

But he did respect me enough to tell me on his own the very next morning, I didn’t catch it I had a little suspicion cause he was acting distant and softly mean, and that’s what really scares me the fact he went super over the lines over miscommunication on his own feelings. He couldn’t handle facing his own feelings with me he just lashed out in a numb decision for lust. I trust him but I’m also scared as I still have that slight fear that if there’s a worse situation with him and his feelings instead of communicating with me to see where we stand he will just take the risk anyway. I’m scared he sees himself as such a horrible person so badly that he will justify doing more bad stuff because he believes he already messed up. cause that’s how he kinda felt before he slept with her.

He did this over (stagnancy, feeling we weren’t getting anywhere in our relationship, stuck in a gray area. We were rebuilding trust.) I understand his feelings but I didn’t know he felt this way as the day before he got me coffee, flowers, and breakfast. I wish he had communicated this and gave me a chance instead of his fear of rejection with me and just made the decision himself. I wish he trusted more in me enough to be able to communicate through things showing we choose each other through everything.

Our story is super complicated, I believe no one is an angel as I made mistakes too I just never let it get that far I stopped. if you wanna know more about our story I did post it on here. I’m just in a bad wave right now.

He is texting me with tons of reassurance right now. He really is trying and fighting for me to trust him, But I’m trying not to text him every time I hit this sadness which is why I’m posting here, because I can tell my emotions get overwhelming for him to pull me out on his own every single time.

UPDATE: (I don’t work today) he took an hour lunch today and came to me with food got me food too cause he knows I can’t eat in waves and laid in bed with me eating and helping me and gave me reassurance while holding me and letting me cry it out.",1,1765484224.0,AsOneAfterInfidelity,4,1.0,False

I’m really lost right now and I would love some advice or similar experiences.

Before developing POTS, I had a completely normal student life:
	•	I went out on weekends,
	•	I drank alcohol only on weekends,
	•	I smoked weed only during parties,
	•	but I used a lot of snus (nicotine) regularly.

Everything changed after a trip with my friends. I spent two days with almost no sleep, drank a lot of alcohol, consumed a lot of nicotine, and then took a 5 AM flight right after leaving a party.

On the plane, I felt like I was about to pass out. I drank a coffee, and it calmed down for a moment.
But the moment I landed, I felt a strange pressure rising from my feet to my head, and then my heart started beating extremely fast.

I went to the ER several times. My symptoms kept getting worse:
	•	I couldn’t stand up,
	•	shortness of breath,
	•	palpitations,
	•	chest pressure,
	•	and a lot of fear because I didn’t understand what was happening.

I want to add that I had experienced this exact feeling once after smoking weed, but it went away quickly that time.

Eventually, I was diagnosed with POTS.
I was given beta blockers, an antidepressant, and some other medication. Lately I’m doing a bit better — I even managed to walk for 1 hour recently, which was impossible before.

Since then, I’ve quit everything: alcohol, nicotine, weed, parties, everything.
But I still have the desire to get my old life back. I had to take a gap year because of this, I’m a student, I’m only 21… I really hope to fully recover one day, especially since I used to be healthy, athletic, and ate well.

Recently I heard that to truly recover, you need to understand the exact cause that disrupted your nervous system.
But I feel completely lost. I also stress a lot, and I got sick during the trip… so I don’t know what triggered it.

👉 Do you think my POTS could come from:
	•	exhaustion + lack of sleep + alcohol + nicotine overload?
	•	a stress-induced autonomic shutdown/dysautonomia?
	•	catching a virus during the trip?
	•	a panic attack that messed up my autonomic nervous system?
	•	or something else?

If any of you had a similar trigger, or know how to identify the root cause, I would really appreciate your help.

Thank you so much.",2,1765484151.0,dysautonomia,8,0.75,False

My girlfriend is coming to visit me in 2 weeks (she will be here 24-29th of December).

Can you please suggest some events or things/places to visit in that period? We like art, music, gastronomy. It would also be a good starting point for me to explore the city as I build up my confidence.
