1nsh0d2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1nsh0d2/friends_arent_around_much_after_giving_birth/,Friends aren’t around much after giving birth?,"FTM with a 3 month old. 
When my friends found out I was pregnant majority where excited and always checking in and after I gave birth were coming to visit and such but initially gave me space after the first few weeks of me being home, which is understandable because I needed to settle in being at home with a little one of course! 

Now as time has gone on, I’ve come to realize they sort of just have dropped off significantly. I understand everyone is busy, life is life and I thought it wouldn’t bother me, as I’ve seen my friends and even family go through the period where no one calls or comes around after having children.

I’m more so a person now I don’t mind staying at home with my little family but I always make time for friends and did before pregnancy and even during but I’ve really had to step back and see it does bother me / upset me that my friends aren’t there as much anymore, they generally don’t ask how things are going or how I’m travelling and I’m often the one reaching out nowadays. I do unfortunately, have PPA and PPD and am trying my best not to project this onto anyone and deal with it myself, by keeping what I’m feeling to myself as I don’t want to be a burden to anyone. 

Instead I try reach out often to say hey let’s catch up, me and Bub can travel out to you or even let’s meet up for a walk or some lunch, but nothing really is solid or it’s often postponed. 
I guess I just feel a bit alone in the sense sometimes you just need a friend (for me it’s not to talk about the negative things or be down in the dumps it’s more to be able to have a laugh and socialise) 
I feel on one hand I could just be reading into it to much, and that people are just genuinely busy with life as like I said life happens, but on the other hand I feel like I’m not interesting enough now that I have my baby. (I wouldn’t trade him for the world!) 

I don’t necessarily miss my life before pregnancy because it often felt like I was trying to fill a void, always out, couldn’t stay in one place for too long and always had to be doing something. 

This weekend particularly but I’m feeling a bit down as having social media I’ve seen posts from my friends that they are all out overnight having a great time by the looks of it. While I don’t particularly miss going out and drinking, I miss the aspect of being able to catch up with friends and have a laugh, I miss being invited or thought of to hang out with. 

While I have supportive families both sides who we visit often, it would be nice to see a friend even if it was just for a coffee.. 

I don’t know if I’m looking for advice or if I’m just letting out some feelings so I don’t spiral and sit here telling myself negative things which would feed further into my PPD.. ",1,1759040137.0,Mommit,0,1.0,False

“War? Are you crazy?” Ginny said, staring at him.

“Did you see the whole meeting?” Adam replied as he looked at a report. The damn Pirate fleet had been a thorn in his butt for so long now, and he was not interested in an argument.

“No. I just saw the news. We are at war with Earth.” She replied, and Adam sighed. 

“Let me guess it’s on GNC? Right,” Adam replied as he glanced at the hologram, and she looked guilty.

“Mother-in-law sent me a link. They are all talking about it on the groups.”

“Yeah, see the whole meeting, they declared war on us because I didn’t want to give them full control of the new region. Come on Ginny. The Freedom Union has been infiltrating GNC for a long time. Kun Nar’s are behind that political faction. You might as well listen to his podcasts, what's the name again? The anti-Burimo talk?”

“Yeah, but it's still war! They are afraid the fleets have to fight you.”

“Tell your mother-in-law to talk to her husband. I closed the gates to Earth. The nearest fleet under their control is four months away.  Let me work on it.”

“Tell me you have a plan!” Ginny said, clearly frustrated

“When do I not?” He replied. “Now go watch the whole thing.”

Ginny nodded, said goodbye, and he went back to his work when a cup of coffee almost magically appeared on his desk.

“Mom’s just as worried, Dad is calmer,” Evelyn said as she leaned on the desk, looking at him.

“Well, I wish it wouldn’t go that way.”

“You should send Roks through that gate on a raid, just to show force.”

“No, I don’t want to be escalated. Besides, he has a job to do. He has to deal with Xanadu and it’s ilk.”

“Why not send the Marines?”

“Because I want to show Earth that our military can easily take over a colony if we want. He has five to take over on the same day.  Having the human fleet stand by and watch is a test of loyalty for both sides.”

Are you expecting any of them to break rank?” She asked, and Adam shook his head.

“No, but Earth does. We have about four months to prevent this from becoming a blood bath.  Sig-san and his team have already left. Sarah has been rounding up human spies and saboteurs. Sly-San has been of immense help with that.”

“good where is the Chris? He didn’t come home from school.”

“In his office.” Adam winked. “Knock before you enter.”

She looked at him, then smirked a little. “Well, at least he is more discreet than Wei. I’ll call him up and get him home before dinner.”

“Archie suggested a higher security detail on them. He has already sent out extra angels.” Adam replied, and she looked at him, then at Archie sitting in the corner, logged into security feeds or what else he might be watching, and back to Adam.

“He is still a droid.”

“Yes, but the logic is sound. He even suggested biological bodyguards to avoid them being hacked.”

“That makes sense.” She turned to Archie. “Good job, I agree.”

“Thank you, my lady.”  He replied, and she smiled.

“God damnit, I like that. My lady. Yeah, you can call me that. Okay, don’t work too long, dinner is ready in two hours.” Then she left, and Adam looked after her, his eyes lingering on her beautiful behind. She still was the most beautiful woman he had met, and she knew it.

Then he went back to work. He had been working for an hour when a secure message came through.

\- Saw your vacation video of your new vacation home, loved it, and sent it to friends. They loved it too.  A few people asked if there were still free spots, including Dad and Mum.-

He looked at the message and replied.

\- Many new homes are available there; tell your parents they are more than welcome.  I will instruct the salesman to contact you regarding the various homes. –

 He sent the message and looked at it. Then he contacted Arus.

“Hi there. Am I disturbing?”

“Nope, she is still going over the files Hyd-Drin provided as well as the survey teams. I’m free for at least two more weeks.”

“Good, I need you to head to the southern union and give a speech at their federation. Bring the evidence, and there is one more thing we are working on.”

“The Southern Federation? Didn’t you close the gate?”

“Yes, that's why you have to take the long route, to the Nalos kingdom. You have to convince them to let you speak in the federation.  You can use Admiral Toberius Gi Iven ship. He will be an asset there.  I need this speech delivered. If they stand down and do not get involved, then I will offer them a direct gate between their senate Hub and Dirt as well as a Gate program between their nations.”

“I can do that. I only need to get them to stand down? What about joining you?”

Adam laughed. “You do that, and  well, what do you want in return?”

“Chris. I want Chris to become my student. I want him to spend two years traveling the galaxy with me and some mentors and learn, and Sam to go on an apprenticeship with Monori.”

Adam looked at him. “I can support it, but I need Evelyn's approval. As for Sam, I think that can be arranged.”

“Good, I will contact the admiral and leave tomorrow.”

“Take care now and tell Monori to take a break, or I will personally come and drag her out of the library.” When Arus logged off, there was a knock on the door, and he looked up to see Vorts there.

“Hey! Come in, what dragged you all the way here?”

“Vorts looked a little distressed as he sat down. “Coffee?”

“Something stronger, please.”

Adam looked at him and got up, then poured two glasses of whiskey. Then, he offered him as Vorts took out a memory crystal and plugged it in. Adam leaned on the desk.

“So what is this about? Why are you so spooked?”

He took the glass, sipped it, and looked at Adam seriously. “Remember the old Dunshin transport?”

“Adam nodded, Yes, the one with the nasty nano-virus,” he replied.

“The Hisgian virus, or as you humans would call it, the zombie virus,” Vorts said, and Adam put down his glass, looking at him and then at the report that appeared. Something was highlighted, and he read it.

“Are you sure about this?”  He said as he sat down. “Have Jork seen this?”

“Yes and Yes, as you can see, the shutdown code is the DNA sequence of the original host, and Kun-Nar sent out somebody with samples of the virus. There are more carens out there.  We only know she was going to an area outside known federations.”

“No way to hack it?” Adam asked as he felt shivers running down his spine.

“Oh, we can hack it, but it will take time, and you have to inject them with our own nano-vaccine. It will be able to shut down the infected, but if they are already dead, then you end up with a corpse.”

Then he changed the files, and Adam saw a group of large animals with Exoskeletons.  And the pirates have been working on this. Turns out the Carens love using biological weapons. They released hordes of these on a pre-space civilization under the Hunkor region. I request a team to deal with the pest. They don’t even know they are under attack from aliens.

“What technological level are we talking about?”

“Early industry, gunpowder, early cartridge, and they have zeppelins and might discover oil and phones within the next decades. That is, if they survive.” Vorts said.

“How did you find out about that, and how will they react to us?” Adam asked.

“A captured pirate vessel with one dead caren researcher onboard. As for us. Muskin would be able to hide us. They are humanoids. I think you humans would call them walking lemurs. Yeah, that’s what they told me to use—even got a big tail, about two meters tall as well. The Hunkor named them Dynip. They have been monitoring them. They were the ones who informed us about the pirate activities. I was nearby since I’m working on their botany problem.”

“Okay, We need to deal with that first. I will inform the federation and offer aid.”

I have already spoken with the Hunork as this falls under their jurisdiction. The king and queen were more than willing to let you intervene in the matter. They were quite welcoming once I mentioned you. Said something about you giving them the best days of their life. What did you do?”

Adam chuckled. “I gave them both jobs on the same trash hauler when they ran away from their arranged marriage. They met and fell in love, unaware of who the other truly was. It was quite fun to arrange. Anyway. I still have to inform the federation, but I will send some teams to deal with the problem. Anything else?”

“Naw,  well yes.. Rohan, I know he is young, but he is quite intelligent. “

“He is Four Vorts!” Adam interrupts.

“Yes, a 4-year-old who has played the biological trait games at the primary five levels. I have never seen it before.

“So, what are you suggesting?” Adam asked.

“Just some simple biology lessons. Just in case he is truly blessed in the field. If so, then I would like to take him as an apprentice when he grows up.”

“Sure, nothing wrong with some extra education.” He replied.

“Good, anyway, I will deal with this problem with the Dynip.  And have Saig-San keep an eye out for that virus. I have had Jork add a patch to all medical scanners looking for the Hisgian virus.” Then he finished his drink, as five girls tumbled into the room giggling.

“Sarah got a boyfriend!” May said, and her little sister lunged at her.

“Take that back.”

Vorts' oldest daughter got in the way, giggling, and faced the angry girl, and May ran out. Adam and Vorts looked at the girls as they ran out, only Sarah was left.

“It’s not true, Daddy. I only said Jonry looked cute with his blue mohawk.” She said, holding back tears

They both looked at her and smiled. “I agree he looks cute in it, but don’t say cute, say cool. Boys like that better.” Vorts said, and she nodded.

“Cool, I got it. Dad? Where did you hide my gun?”

Adam looked at her, then at Vorts, who grinned, and Adam opened his drawer, took out the toy shock gun, and tossed it to her.

“Four against one, it's only fair you can defend yourself. Just be careful and don’t shoot your mum or the triplets.” 

She nodded, cocked the gun, and called out with the sweetest voice she could muster. “Oh May.. guess what I got back!”

 Then she ran out.

 The two men laughed, and about ten seconds later, they heard two women shouting “ADAM!”

\-three days later over Xanadu –

Roks looked down on the planet; it was a heavily industrialized world. With only a few green spots left, above it hung a medium-sized space station.

He opened a channel and waited patiently for the reply. Instead of a reply, they launched an attack. He chuckled and waited for the missiles and rail guns to empty their magazines. This ship could take the impact from the rail gun, and they fired the missiles too early, so all missiles were hacked and detonated at a safe distance.

“Have you hacked the security feed?” He looked at his security officer, who needed, and put the administrator's office up on the screen. He saw Adams' donors and a few others standing around a holographic display of the battlefield. He had all of them in his file except one.

“That Advisor, the Murgot. Who is he? He looks military.”

“scanning and searching now.  Hmm, he is logged in as Lars Kung. Military advisor and leader of the Junibu Mercenaries. And they are a front for the lost fleet. Yeah, he is on the list; we just didn’t have a facial of him. He has a stealth dreadnaught at his disposal.”

“Well, scan for it, he is planning an ambush,” Jork replied, and then he smiled. “Gunner, I want one laser shot at the center of that holographic war table. Can you do it?”

“Yes, sir. Let me do the calculations.” As the gunner replied, the ship rocked as something hit it.

“We are getting boarded, sir.  By some sort of giant spiders and lizards?”

“Oh fuck, for crying out loud. Just flood the sections with cryo gas and tell the crew to get away.” Roks said and turned his head back to the gunner. “When you're ready.”

“Firing now, sir!” He replied, and a focused, intense beam was visible for ten seconds. Roks looked at the screen as the holographic war table had a nice hole in the middle of it, and it short-circuited.

“Boarding animals contained, Sir.” Came from behind, then another alarm went off. “Saboteurs on board, looks like the animals were a distraction. Enemy located and taken out. Do we counter board?”

“Yes, they might have intel, send in angles and mechs, they might try to self-destruct.”

Then he turned towards the screen, “Contact them again.”

The communication officers sent a request. He watched as they looked at the incoming call, listening to the CCTV feeds.

“Who the hell does that dog think he is! Where are the Marines?” Maria Lee shouted.

“They are ignoring our calls. Admiral Hicks simply told us he doesn’t protect criminals.” And aid said.

“fuck him, I want that skinned alive, where are the men you promised us?” She continued as she turned to the Murgot captain, who seemed calm.”

“My men are setting the ambush as we speak, he won't know what hit him.” He replied, and Maria's husband, David, looked at the destroyed table.

“It doesn’t look like you are on top of everything. And can somebody block that damn line?  It's not like we are going to speak to that dog. Launch another missile attack and all our fighters, and prep the self-destruction.”

“That will take five minutes, sir!” An aid replied.

“Good start then, and set it for thirty minutes. It will give us time to escape this rock.” Maria replied, and her husband grinned.

“Great minds think alike.”

.

.

“ Hack their communication lines, I’m want to speak with them.” Roks said.

“Hacking….. give me a second…. And there. You're one!”

“Hello again, Adam is sending his regards. Now Adam is in a good mood and is willing to let you pack your stuff and leave.”

He watched as they looked around, first confused, then panicked, and finally they calmed down as if they had won.

“Your problem is that I’m not Adam, I’m the freaking god of war.”  He turned to the gunner. “Remove that building!”

It took the gunner ten seconds to fulfill Rok's request in a satisfactory manner. Roks smirked slightly. Then turned to his CO, You have the list of people Adam wants removed. Make the arrangements.

Then he went to his communication room and called up his fleet officers to obtain their reports. The same story repeated itself; they were attacked when entering the system. A few mercenary groups were all the defense they mustered. He reviewed the report and sent it to Adam, then called him.

“You absolutely had to kill them?” Adam asked.

“They opened fire first, refused to talk, and had my ship boarded. It's war Adam. I cut the head of the snake. In matters of war, I have full command, remember. You can yell at me later over a few beers.”

Adam looked at him and smiled slightly. “Well, they declared war on me, and you did try to contact them first, right?”

“Of course. I started the battle as a true gentleman and let them fire first. Even tried to contact them again. They left me no choice once they were taken off the planet, it surrounded very quickly. Oh, and they had a advisor who is connected to the Lost Fleet as well.”

“Good, I will send some diplomats and administrators to take over the planets. Now hurry back, we've got BBQ tonight.”

My Nickelodeon alarm barks at me like a drill sergeant. It's six thirty am. Anxiety and dread slowly seep into my 12-year-old mind. Today is the first day back from summer break. The smell of beef top ramen quells the annoying emotions for a moment. Mom is making my favorite breakfast. 

I put on a pair of pants I had laid out the night before and threw on my favorite Toy Machine hoodie. I stare at the wall for a moment then I hear our mom yell ""Boyyyysss breakfast!"" I slide into the kitchen with my socks, like a rockstar. We ate a lot of Top Ramen growing up, money was tight. Maybe that's why I never grew much bigger.

My mom is in her robe and she smells like cigarettes and coffee. I love my mom.  The Pokémon theme song starts and my brother slides into the kitchen. We start singing together smiling ""Ohhh you're my best friend in a world we must defend POKEMON!!!!!"" I can still sing it word for word. We sit at the table and blow and slurp on our noodles like in an anime. Warm and partially fed, I run to my room my big dorky brown trombone case. It's almost as big as me.

The fog is thick like whipped cream as we open the front door. We trot down the old rickety wooden porch steps and try not to slip. We pretend to smoke cigarettes with the steam from our warm breaths as we walk through the frosted dirt field.   I can hear the clack of the hacky sack and the laughter of my friends up ahead at the bus stop. Suddenly they appeared as we made way through the thick creamy fog. 

They make room for us in the circle and I watch the sac pounce from foot to foot. Everyone is smiling and laughing without a care for what life will eventually become. The loud rumbling of the school bus beckons in the distance like an avalanche getting closer. It's telling us to get ready. I hit the sack one more time and catch it mid-air. So cool. I grab my dorky trombone case and put it in the storage below the seats. I'm always last on the bus.  Slim Shady is playing on the radio as I get on the bus. I see my friends in the back seat and wave.

Oftentimes, my mother - in good faith - would not let me use my inhaler, because she noticed that it would clear up on it's own, and she was more comfortable with the idea of my body naturally clearing things out.

For a while, I was given the brown steroidal inhalers, but I was only on it for a few months, and didn't fully understand why I was on them, and my mother took me off because she wasn't comfortable with the idea of ""steroids"".

My asthma was, perhaps what I'd describe as moderate-severe? Somewhere in between. Using the blue Salbutamol inhalers many times a day, and feeling a permanent low-grade wheeziness even between Asthma attacks.

Now I'm 30, I use my blue Salbutamol inhaler maybe once every 3 weeks. But I do high intensity workouts every day, and I'm significantly wheezy during them, which I've never minded, because I just figured that was normal for an Asthmatic, and I just let the wheeziness clear up within 15-30 minutes.

I feel silly, but I only JUST learned tonight that you apparently can cause permanent scarring if you don't ""manage"" it. I always thought ""Manage? I don't care about it. I feel fine. I get wheezy and then it goes away in a few minutes."".

I feel fine in general. I have an ever so slight wheeze that never goes away, but again... thought that was normal for an Asthmatic. When I use my blue inhaler, I love how well I can breathe, but I always assumed that was elevating me above normal baseline, just like when we drink coffee and we feel more energized than our normal baseline.

Oh, and since I was like 10, I CONSTANTLY clear my throat. This is a normal part of my life, and anyone who knows me, knows that I clear my throat literally hundreds of times per day. If I don't, mucus builds up within seconds.

Is it possible that the permanent, slight wheeze I have and the throat-clearing are signs of permanent damage?

I feel so naive, because I'm passionate about medicine and the body, but Asthma has been such a constant, normal part of my life, I've never even inquired, and it doesn't occupy space in my brain.",1,1759040011.0,Asthma,0,1.0,False

I have been diagnosed with: fibromyalgia 8 years ago, endometriosis (had hysterectomy and excision about 3 years ago), sleep apnea, allergies, GERD, lipedema, plantar fasciitis, childhood asthma/bronchitis/pneumonia, lots of sinus and ear infections, autism, ADHD, OCD, GAD, cPTSD. LARGE benign kidney cyst (excised in March). I am obese, BMI about 36 and need to get under 35 for lipedema surgery. Have lost about 10 lbs since May with compounded tirzepatide. I’ve had one bout of covid that was asymptomatic and one bad one Sept 2024.


History of TTP, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Labs are currently perfect for that, ADAMTS13 is 100%+. Had three bouts 2013, 2015, 2019 treated with rituximab, Cablivi and PLEX. Had lowered ADAMTS13 and one rituximab infusion in Jan 2024 which brought it right back up. 

I may have—POTS (no tilt table test but they just gave me propranolol when my HR started skyrocketing last summer, pre covid infection). Celiac—runs in family and after trialing being off it exposure gives me anything from canker sores to extremely painful gastritis. Hypermobility—sometimes a large joint just goes off kilter and then snaps back in after a while, often the hips and the shoulders, and I have a lot of pain in my hands and feet. 

Symptoms: tiredness, malaise, joint pain all over but especially lower back, hips, outside of feet. Cramping in feet and hands with activity (e.g. writing). Legs and feet sometimes swollen, this could be the lipedema. Mild Reynaud’s phenomenon at times since childhood. Occasional nerve pain when it’s warm/hot but this has slowed. I intermittently have allergic reactions, especially to scents, usually ending up with a scratchy throat and feeling very under the weather. 

Lifestyle: I am single. I lift weights 3x weekly (since July) and have a slightly active job, although currently I’m working 40% and on a mental health leave. I sing in a choir. I eat gluten and dairy free and try to get the five a day veg. I do eat sugar but not a wild amount I think. I drink coffee (1-2 cups daily). No drugs or alcohol. Sleep is so so. Work stress is on the high side lately, ergo the mental health leave.

Relevant family history: father had some kind of acute lupus in his 20s or that’s what they thought it was in the 70s. Mom has many of the same weird autoimmune things as me. Low on details (estrangement). 

My TPO levels are up but thyroid levels are still normal. New PCP didn’t run TPO this time. Otherwise he did a ton of autoimmune tests.

Normal: CRP, CH50, IGG, Sed rate, sjogren’s, antischleroderma-70, antichromatin, antiribosomal p, etc. everything UNDER the ANA. HLAB27, parvovirus b19, RF, T4, TSH, and some others. 

Abnormal: the ANA is 1:80, dense fine speckled (says it suggests DFS70 antibody).

Creatinine kinase slightly low at 46. I didn’t take creatine before the lab this day. 

Some of the antiphospholipid labs: 
PT high: 12.2
drVVT high: 49.1
drVVT confirm high: 1.

Leukocyte esterase urine: 1+ (but I didn’t try hard for a clean catch because I wasn’t told to).

Last TPO high at 66.

TSH has gone steadily down over the last couple of years, from 2.04 uIU/mL in 7/2023 to 0.594 last test.

T4 has gone steadily up from 1.22 to 1.54 ng/dL.


Phew. Okay. Given all of that—what are my possibilities? Myositis, lupus, just the hashimoto’s setting in and maybe needing treatment even though it’s subclinical? (Edit: maybe this trend is more indicative of grave’s disease, my bad). Mixed connective tissue disease? Antiphospholipid syndrome? Please, a hematologist or rheumatologist hop in and tell me what it could be and also what some of the treatments might be!

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

Then they start going into materials, like thermal retention and plastic leeching? I admit I don't guzzle 20 coffees a day, so I do wonder if people aren't overdoing it a bit with the anti plastic rhetoric.

Could not get past 2 rolls. No one.

Got to my local spot. Harrah’s Nor Cal, seeing if we can repeat last nights good session. The regular guys had even asked last night if I was coming out for multiplier days which I usually skip at night because it’s so packed. And it was, and I should have avoided.

1 and a half tables open. Both $5 min and both packed to the gills. I already don’t like shooting at a packed table unless I can get an end spot cuddled up to a dealer.

Grab a hook spot on the half table that’s open.
$200 buy in. I even wait until it’s one person before me to start betting and hop in to roll. Bankroll management if you will.

PSO, I hit 2 numbers then 7 out.

PSO , hits 1 number, PSO, PSO, hits 1 and red. Back to me. I even have a funky “natural” on the card layout. Any 7 is a 7.

Point is 6 I go all in. I go across. Heavy on the 8 and even get my hard ways early. 
Fucking PSO.
I’m dead, I’m outta here. BREAK TIME. I’ve only been at the table for 25 mins. The damn drive was longer.

Put a 20 in a slot to cool off and the picture is the result. Couldn’t even get 1 line hit.
.07 cash out.
That’s my sign right there. I have another $200 for a rebuy and i usually go off vibes whether im rebuying or not.

Im a fool. For the first time in my life, I have zero plan. No savings, no roadmap, no hope just me, my brain, and a mountain of ideas.

A year ago I was different.
I biked 560 km from Oshawa to Montreal 5 days, pink single‑speed, sleeping rough, heat, rain, gravel, tent. One day I forgot to refill my water and two strangers came out of nowhere and saved me all the while scaring the shit out of me, giving me just enough water to make it through the day (about a bottles worth). That ride was supposed to be my redemption arc. It wasn’t.

Before that I self‑admitted to the hospital after spiralling on Zoloft. I’d been prescribed it for depression after a year of microdosing mushrooms (which sent me on a rollercoaster aswell), mixed with occasional edibles, felt like a destined success story, stacked cash, extended my reach with BNPL. Even signed up for online courses to potentially branch into mechanical engineering. Quit. Chased art instead pastels, charcoal, murals, TikToks. Everything “started”, nothing stuck.

Then came the storm.
Edibles every day.
Caffeine like a drug. I should’ve been doing coke…
Two hours of sleep between warehouse shifts and midnight bike rides.
Garbage bags over the windows.
Discord & Social Media bans.
The internet telling me to admit myself.
Ten days in the open unit. Med switches. Nice people I literally cant remember the names of. Came out sober. Trained harder. Rode to Montreal. Planned to cross Canada next fuelled with change. Didn’t.

Now weed sparks my creativity but keeps me on a leash, coffee fuels it, then the crash kills me. Delusions. Dread. Meds off and on. Quality of life gone. Finances gone. Thousands in debt. Gear without a plan. 3D Printer, decent PC, Parts, Ideas without a future… Im currently on medical leave from my part time job and cant see myself returning to work if im being honest. My job is over an hour bus ride away and returning will push me to my end if I don’t reach the point before I return.

Zero money. Zero way out.
But the delusional side of me still believes I could make it out, that’s what hurts the most.

So here’s what I’m going to try to do if I don’t go missing in the process. I’m going to start documenting. The real stuff. The ideas, the failures, the weed, the debt, the little wins, build vlogs, tech or whatever. I’m going to post here on Reddit, YouTube when I work up the confidence, starting from literally zero dollars. If I can turn this into anything, a business, a job offer, a community, a reason to keep going then at least my mess wasn’t for nothing.

If you’ve been here and made it out, tell me how.
If you’ve got advice, a job lead, a mentorship, a way to collaborate, DM me.
If you just want to watch a 21‑year‑old try to claw his way out of his own hole, follow along.

I don’t want pity. I want to build. I want to climb. I want to show that someone can go from zero to something, even with bipolar and a trail of self‑inflicted chaos.

This is either the beginning of my downfall or the start of my climb.

I guess we’ll find out together.

I'm a high school student who has been given an incredible opportunity to travel to Spain with my school. As someone who has been studying Spanish, this trip means so much more than just a vacation—it's a chance to immerse myself in the culture, practice the language I've been learning, and gain experiences that will help me grow academically and personally.
The challenge is that the program costs more than my family and I can cover on our own. That's why I've set up this fundraiser.

-Rayal Lounge (Bedstuy). Welcoming vibes, DJ spinning 00’s hits and dance hall. I had the Rasta Pasta with chicken and a Spicy Hibiscus Mistress cocktail. Quite happy with the whole experience. FYI: karaoke on Wed, Jazz on Sun. Dj Thu-Sat.

-Cocktail Bedstuy. Packed! Great drinks. Got the Fake Spring.

-Cafe Bossa (Bedstuy). Decent coffee. Nice outdoor seating area for working. Got at oatmilk latte.

-Macosa Trattoria (Bedstuy). Oxtail ragu w/pappardelle. Delicious! 

-Arepas, Empanadas, and Latin Food (Bedstuy). The mais empanadas are exactly what’s missing in my end of the world. By noon they’re picked over but was able to get the cheese and the beef. Both were delicious. Sancocho looked soo comforting but didn’t make it back to try it. 

-Finback Brooklyn (Park Slope). Decent food and  drinks. Sadly, no opinion on the beer (can’t drink it), but great place to post up and do some work if you don’t mind crowd buzz. 

-Four and Twenty Blackbirds (Park Slope). Five stars! Sour cherry pie baby! 

-Italian Festival (Little Italy). Philly cheesesteak and chicken parmesan eggrolls. Worth it! 

-Izakaya Fuku (Jackson Heights). Great vibes. Mixed sashimi salad and salmon onigiri. Great fish quality. Cash only. 
-Saurkraut Fish (East Village). Chonqing chicken lunch special! Delicious. 

-Oasis Cafe (East Village). Coffee was meh but there was space to sit with a laptop. Outlets included. 

-NBetween (Chelsea). Total dark bar Tokyo vibes. Great whiskey drinks. Full-wall vinyl collection! Also snacks but I didn’t try them. 

-Sky Pavillion (Hell’s Kitchen). Dan Dan noodles were ok, was expecting more accoutrements. Soup dumplings were great! 

-Arlo Midtown. Good happy hour. Plenty of room at bar to work. 

-Sake Bar Decibel (East Village). Great fish quality. Wow. Yuzu sake drink on happy hour was very refreshing. Dive bar vibes. 

-NY Botanic Gardens farmers market (Bronx). Got some great cold brew and fresh orange cherry tomatoes. Blueberries looked amazing. Lots of other treats to eat! FYI Wed gets residents free entry to the gardens.

-Xi’an Famous Foods (DT Brooklyn). Got the sweet and sour pork noodles and some pork and cabbage dumplings. Excellent food! 

-Ler Lers (Bedstuy). Excellent papaya salad, fresh with the perfect amount of fish sauce. Also got the Tom yum, strong balanced flavor. Have a great lunch special as well! 

-Rockaway Deli 3 (Bedstuy). Shout out to the seasoned fries! Crispy and flavorful, just like Jack in the Box but better price.

Here are 3 simple strategies that have been game-changers:

1. Automate Repetitive Tasks - Tools like Zapier or QuickBooks handle customer emails and invoicing automatically. It’s like having a 24/7 virtual assistant without the hefty price tag

2. Delegate with Clear Systems - I created SOPs in ClickUp for tasks like customer support and inventory management. My team follows them, and I rarely need to step in. Pro tip: invest time upfront to train your team to avoid micromanaging later.

3. Streamline with Subscription Models - I switched to offering subscription-based services (like a monthly maintenance plan) using tools like Stripe. It creates predictable revenue and automates billing, so I’m not chasing payments. Low-effort, high-impact!

Michael Tatum), and Dunk Shuttlecock (Alejandro Saab)

I thought I’d share some of the answers they gave during the Q&A! This is mostly from memory so don’t quote me on anything.

“What DND Class would your characters be?” Jean Loo would not be a bard (too predictable) but rather a necromancer or warlock or something. Ray: Wallace would be a barbarian and Lyric would be the DM because he likes writing his own stories! J. Michael: Mitchell Linn wouldn’t have a class, he would just own a tavern. “Mitchell certified npc!” Alejandro: Dunk would be a monk, and show up to the first session with a paper that just says “Dunk the Monk” on it and nothing else.

“Which character would you want to realize?” Ray: Dishy, because he canonically makes the world better and more efficient Robbie: “Sofia the Safe for my own personal reasons” Sarah: Lux, Lucinda or Jean Loo Alejandro: Maggie Max: Vaugn Trapp (Ray claims Trapp is canonically the best lover)

“Favorite voiceline, either from your character or someone else?” Ray: Tony mispronouncing “Date Everything” in the intro, and Mitchell Linn saying “You are rude, crude and have a poor attitude, and frankly you smell of low quality beef” Bobbie: Vaughn Trapp saying “I can’t wait to love you or whatever the fuck!” Max: Mikey Transaction doing an extended offscreen monologue in various voices Alejandro: “Oh, sex! Yeah, you meant sex!”

“If you could turn any object in your house into a dateable what would it be?” J. Michael: Has a cool coffee table made out of airplane parts that he “wished he could date even before Date Everything” Robbie: The safe, again

“If you could add another dateable to the game what would it be?” They discussed the concept of having a second bed or coffee maker so there could be a rivalry.

Bonus answers: 
-J. Michael Tatum also got to contribute to the soundtrack, they needed a concierto for Keyes and he “just happened to have one written already” 
-Ray Chase said they made a huge effort to get a diverse group of voice actors, even making sure that Mac’s voice actor was a wheelchair user irl 
-Vaughn Trapp’s voice actor apparently “improvised 50% of his lines” and they had a lot of trouble picking which ones they would keep because they were all gold

	•	Good food spots – from must-try local places to hidden gems (I’m open to street food or proper restaurants).
	•	Offbeat or lesser-known places worth exploring (beyond Rock Garden/Sukhna Lake).
	•	One good clubbing spot for a fun night out.

Basically, I want to soak in Chandigarh’s vibe in the most local and authentic way possible. Any tips, suggestions, or hidden gems would mean a lot! 🙌

Thanks in advance! 💛",1,1759037941.0,Chandigarh,1,1.0,False

Life’s unpredictable — and honestly, why drag things out when we could already be laughing over who’s worse at cooking, arguing whether chai beats coffee, or daring each other to share our most embarrassing playlist?

I’m the kind who enjoys late-night drives with good music, experimenting in the kitchen (disaster meals included), and binge-watching crime thrillers when I should probably be sleeping. I try to keep active, but my real strength? I’m genuinely easy to vibe with — people tell me I’m warm, witty, and someone who can make conversations feel effortless.

What I’m looking for: a woman (25+) who enjoys playful banter, meaningful chats, and maybe a spark that goes beyond the screen. If we click, meeting up in real life is definitely on the cards. Doesn’t matter if you’re shy or bold — bring your energy, and I’ll always match it.

One heads-up: I’ll eventually ask for a light verification (nothing personal or revealing, just a safety thing).

So tell me — if today was all we had, what’s the *one crazy or fun thing* you’d want to do?

DM me and let’s see if we can make today a little more interesting.

* Working in IT for the last few years, though I have two degrees which I didn't use (one science and engineering)
* I consider myself to be empathetic, caring, down to earth, warm, honest, and emotionally available.
* I drink tea before coffee first thing in the morning. My tea is black with milk and sugar, but my 830am coffee is always a flat white.
* Recently getting back into the gym, I go 3-4x a week, working on cutting my 5km time down, and a two plate bench within the next 12 months.
* I take care of my health, eat right, lots of fruit and veg, get enough sunshine, sleep, and water... I hope you do too =)
* I have a solid relationship with my family, I consider them to be the rock in my life.
* Love my house music, all edm, all music in general tbh, and photography, I shoot film, got into it during COVID. Hit me up with your last.fm ! 
* I guess this isn't so relevant, but never been in a proper relationship ever at all before, but it is what it is. 
* I play guitar (though I don't practice nearly often as I should), and the book I am currently reading is 'Siddhartha' by Herman Hesse.
* I am a pretty damn good cook if I do say so myself. I am an expert at making a meal out of random stuff that's in the fridge, because I haven't gone shopping in the last week.

You are:

* In that 25 - 35 age bracket, please.
* A happy, carefree, authentic, down to earth person. Enjoys living life, rolling with the punches, sees the bright side in all situations, and has an appreciation for art/science/music/technology.
* It'd be nice if you were from Australia
* Doesn't sweat the small stuff.
* Vibes with what I've written so far, willing to wake up to a good morning text each and every day, doesn't mind my incessant talking.

First time posting here 
The tooth (1st molar on upper left side) started hurting beginning of the year but I ignored it due to moving houses and everything being so expensive
Early September the pain came back, this time stronger 
I went to visit a dentist 2 weeks and said it needs a root canal but we've only booked you a short appointment so I can't do it now, she showed me the xray (I don't understand anything) and said the tooth next to it needs a filling and should would be able to do it then and there. I didnt like the vibe of the practice and everyone was rude to me.
Last week I went to another dentist and explained the situation and she said no you need to extract the tooth because its only a shell and if i do a root canal, it might break as it doesnt have any support 
I have attached the xray.
While discussing this with my partner he suggested to go to a third dentist and get it checked without revealing what the last 2 dentists said and do what majority say 😅
I dont want to extract it becuase I don't want to walk around with a missing tooth especially since it would be visible.

A bit about me: Im 27 years old, I live in Australia, I brush, floss (recently only) and use mouthwash daily and I dont smoke or drink. I have about 2 coffees a day.
TIA

Crematorium rules did not allow relatives of the dead to watch them being cremated.

Stella paid the staff here, so she was allowed into the incineration room holding onto the cold, metal-framed bed.

She felt the burning heat, and dust was floating in the sunlight.

Maybe it was ashes.

Soon, her baby girl would be burned to ashes as well.

Stella wore a small-sized, long black dress, but it couldn't hide her scrawny figure.

Her eyes, red and swollen from crying, were unusually calm at the moment.

She reached out and touched her daughter's pale, stiff little hand outside the white cloth and put two pink origami stars in it.

""Annie, wait for Mommy.""

Time was up.

A staff member stepped forward to pull Stella away and then pulled back the white cloth, revealing Annie's face and body.

Annie was eight years old, but still skinny and short, with the hollowed belly and the jutting ribs.

As Stella stared at the hollowed belly, her eyes filled again with tears.

She had failed to protect Annie!

The staff member whispered to her soothingly, ""I'm sorry for your loss. At least your daughter's kidney saved a kid after she died, and that kid will live happily for your daughter.""

A cold glint flickered across Stella's eyes, and she smiled mockingly.

""Yes, that child is my husband's illegitimate son, and the three of them are having a big birthday party for that child, but you know what? Today is also my daughter's birthday.""

The staff member was stunned and had absolutely no idea how to comfort this desperate woman.

Stella looked at Annie and managed to force a smile, her face pale.  ""Let the cremation begin. Don't delay the auspicious time. I hope my daughter will be reborn into a good family in her next life.""

The staff sighed slightly and shook his head as they took the body to the incinerator.

Perhaps out of sympathy for her, he shielded the process from her.

Stella, however, wasn't scared at all because Annie was finally free.

She didn't have to be hated by her dad anymore.

""Mommy, why doesn't Daddy like me?""

""Mommy, why does Daddy like Ms. Stewart's son?""

""Mommy, does Daddy dislike you because of me? I'm sorry, Mommy.""

She had such a sweet daughter.

But Caspian got her killed!

He said he would take Annie to the biggest amusement park on the eve of her birthday to fulfill her dreamy birthday wish of being alone with her dad.

Instead, he wheeled Annie into the operating room and made her donate a kidney to his son.

And then he left her alone in a hospital bed to die of an infection.

And Stella was actually the last to know about it!

She still couldn't get over the fact that when she rushed into the ward, all she saw was Annie's stiff body.

And the blood-stained children's watch at the bedside was ridiculously dialing her dad's number.

He picked up the phone call and said, ""Don't be crazy like your mom.""

Beep, beep, beep...

Listening to the repetitive busy signal, Stella held back her tears and hugged Annie, fearing that she would scare her baby girl if she cried out.

In fact, from the time Abigail returned to the country with her son and accused Stella of seriously hurting them, she had been forced by Caspian to become an infamously crazy woman.

Especially when Caspian heard Abigail crying about living a vagrant life abroad and giving birth to a premature baby with kidney problems, he looked at Stella and Annie with mean, fierce eyes, despite his elegance and grace.

Ignoring her explanation, he continued to curse, ""Stella, you hurt Abigail and my son, and I'll make you pay double the price.""

Caspian did what he said. And it was time to finish all this.

Stella snapped out of her memories with a pink urn in her hand.

Annie loved the color pink.

She hugged the urn tightly. ""Annie, we're going home.""

The blowing wind lifted the hem of her skirt, and she looked so lonely and sad in the sunlight.

Stella went back to her and Caspian's wedding room, packed up Annie's things, and sat with the urn until evening.

There was the sound of a car pulling up outside the door.

Then a figure in black walked in at a steady pace.

It was Caspian.

Eight years had passed, and he was still as dashing, dangerous, and abstinent as when she first saw him.

He was still oblivious to her presence.

Without looking at her, Caspian walked past her and went upstairs.

He came back down a few minutes later after changing into a suit he had kept for years.

Abigail had designed the suit for him when he and Abigail had gotten engaged.

Caspian still didn't look at Stella.

He had been giving her the silent treatment for eight years.

When he wanted to torture her, he pinned her to the bed and had rough sex. Then he left without even looking back when his sexual appetite was satisfied.

As for Annie...

He even forbade Annie to call him dad.

Perhaps because Stella was strangely quiet today, Caspian stopped in his tracks but didn't look back at her.

""I won't be back tonight. Tell Annie not to call me at any time.""

""Uh-huh.""

Stella touched Annie's urn in her arms as if it was still warm.

If he had looked at her for even a second, he might have noticed the urn.

Caspian put on cufflinks and said indifferently, ""Think about what you want for the divorce, and we'll get the paperwork done in a couple of days. Besides, I don't want custody of Annie.""

""Uh-huh.""

Stella remained calm.

Fortunately, Annie would be hers alone from now on.

Caspian's hand, however, paused, but he still didn't give a look to Stella.

""Since Annie saved Lucas's life, I'll fully cover her medical and nutritional expenses, but I don't want to see you guys again. This is considered your final atonement.""

""Hmm.""

Stella thought to herself that he would soon never see them again indeed.

Feeling inexplicably annoyed, Caspian was about to turn around when he got a call from Abigail.

As soon as he picked up the phone, a kid's cheers on the other end of the line rang out in the quiet room.

""Daddy! Come quickly! Mommy and I are waiting for you.""

""I'll be there soon.""

Caspian's voice went up, and he unconsciously quickened his pace.

He was completely unaware of Stella clutching something in her arms behind him. Her body stiffened little by little.

The moonlight seeped in.

Stella took the cake out of the refrigerator that she had ordered for Annie some time ago.

Then she lit the birthday candles.

""Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you...""

She sang as she spilled gasoline all over the place, including every corner from upstairs to downstairs.

Because she just wasn't going to live on her own.

If only she had taken a stronger stance and refused to marry Caspian back then, then none of this would have happened.

After everything was done, she sat back down at the table hugging the urn.

""Annie, happy birthday and wait for Mommy.""

Stella threw the birthday candles at the curtains.

At the party.

Caspian made a high-profile entrance with Abigail and their son.

People were drinking and raising a toast at the party. Everyone complimented them on being a happy family of three, and many of them even disparaged Stella.

But a doctor, one of Caspian's friends, frowned and walked quickly over to Caspian.

""Mr. Gonzalez, I'm sorry for your loss.""

""What do you mean?""

""Your daughter died of a post-op infection. Mrs. Gonzalez took her to the funeral parlor today.""

""How much did Stella pay you?"" Caspian raised a toast and sipped his wine with an expressionless face.

""Didn't I send you the death certificate? And you messaged me back.""

As soon as the doctor finished, Abigail guiltily tightened her grip on Lucas's hand.

At that moment, Caspian's phone rang.

""Mr. Gonzalez, the villa is on fire.""

When Caspian heard this, the glass of wine in his hand dropped to the ground, and then he turned to leave.

He slammed on the gas and drove to the villa. When he arrived, he saw the villa burst into flames and felt as if something pierced into his heart.

The curtains fell, revealing Stella sitting in front of a birthday cake and the urn in her arms.

She smiled at him as if she had met him for the first time.

""Goodbye. I hate you. If I could do it all over again...""

Before she could finish, the whole villa collapsed.

Maybe it was a delusion before she died, Stella thought she saw Caspian fall to his knees.

She just let it go.

Annie was coming to get her.

""Mommy. Mommy.""

In the afternoon, the sun blazed overhead.

The atmosphere in the hall of the Gonzalez's mansion was tense.

The teacup slammed to the ground, and the pain of the shards cutting through her skin immediately brought Stella back to her senses.

She knelt in the center of the hall and looked blankly at the people around her.

What was going on?

Chapter 2 She Was Reborn

She was reborn!

She was actually reborn!

Stella pinched herself hard despite the astonished expressions of the crowd.

Pain swept through her entire body, and her eyes were instantly filled with tears!

""What are you crying for? Did the Gonzalez family wrong you?""

The man sitting at the head of the table said in a majestic voice.

Stella looked up and met Brynjar's displeased eyes.

She immediately bowed her head, looking as humble as ever, but her body couldn't stop trembling with excitement.

People snickered and whispered incessantly.

""You're so young but you've got such a poor character. You even had the guts to drug Caspian and climb into his bed. It's a huge scandal. You want to force Caspian to marry you, right? But now you are afraid to admit it. Weren't you taught any manners?""

""She isn't genetically related to us. The Gonzalez family would have never raised someone as shameless as her. Her diaries are circulating on the internet, saying that she has a crush on Caspian. She has no shame. The Gonzalez family paid for her to go to college, but she actually learned how to be a vixen.""

""I told you before not to let her move in, but you just let the vixen into our home. And she forces Caspian to marry her now. I don't know who she learned these disgusting tricks from, or if she got them from her mother.""

Then a few people gave a sidelong glance to Stella's mother, Madelyn Flores, who was standing at the end of the line.

Madelyn looked extremely embarrassed, glanced at Stella, and then lowered her head. She bit her lip tightly but didn't dare to retort.

It was because Stella's status was too special.

Stella moved into the Gonzalez's mansion because her mom remarried Caspian's brother.

So she should call Caspian uncle based on seniority.

But she never did.

Because she wasn't qualified.

In her previous life, Stella apologized in fear amidst the accusations of these people and indirectly acquiesced to drugging Caspian and crawling into his bed.

Then she got pregnant and forced Caspian to marry her. Not only did Caspian hate her, but the whole city also loathed her.

People thought she went to any length in order to marry into a rich family.

In this life, she wanted to rewrite her destiny and wouldn't let the tragedy happen again!

Stella looked around at all the Gonzalez family who were sitting upright, not as timid as she used to be in her previous life.

She was about to speak when the sound of a man's steady footsteps came from behind her. Everyone except Brynjar became respectful.

His tall, upright figure passed over Stella and stepped forward.

The butler took the coat from his arm, nodded, and said, ""Mr. Gonzalez.""

""Hmm.""

Caspian responded blandly, nodded to Brynjar who sat at the head of the table, and eased into his seat.

Never once did he look at Stella.

It was as if she meant nothing to him.

But Stella was staring at him without blinking.

He did not look at her with downcast eyes until he realized that she was staring at him.

With the memories of her past life, Stella instinctively trembled all over with fear at once and tasted the blood in her mouth. She closed her hands as if she was holding Annie's hand.

She could never forget that face.

He had a chiseled face and defined features, and his deep-set eyes were unfathomable. The red jade ring on his left thumb was glistening with a touch of blood red.

This ring showed the personality of its owner. He was seemingly aloof, yet dangerous and bloodthirsty.

Caspian noticed Stella's eyes on him, and his hand turning the ring paused abruptly.

He resumed his indifference until a pair of pale-skinned, tender hands rested on his shoulders.

It was Abigail.

Her eyes were red from crying, and she had a pitiful expression on her delicate, soft face.

Everyone was finally here!

When Brynjar saw that Caspian had also arrived, he picked up the coffee in front of him, stirred it with a spoon, and looked at Stella seemingly inadvertently.

His eyes were cold and intimidating.

""Enough. Everybody shut up. Are you not ashamed enough?""

""Stella, you and your mom have lived in the Gonzalez's mansion for so many years, and the Gonzalez family has treated you well. Since you did something wrong, you should admit your wrongdoing.""

That was how he described it!

He was close to directly threatening them both.

Brynjar didn't like Madelyn.

When he made an indirect threat, Madelyn, a timid coward, became even more anxious.

She quickly stepped forward and tugged on Stella's arm, crying and persuading, ""Stella, quickly apologize to Grandpa. Just apologize, and you'll be fine. Don't make a big deal out of it!""

Apologize?

Humph.

Madelyn didn't know that Brynjar had no intention of letting her off the hook. He was waiting for her to swallow her pride, admit her mistake, and take the abuse for the Gonzalez family from the netizens.

Stella no longer bowed her head, but straightened her back, and scanned the crowd before looking at Caspian.

They locked eyes. His eyes were cold, and he remained silent.

He seemed to have predicted her end.

But this time, he probably was not going to get his way.

Stella braced herself on her numb knees and stood up as Caspian watched. Then she let out a soft laugh.

""Why should I apologize?""

""What did you say?"" Brynjar's face was livid with anger, and his coffee spilled.

Stella said word for word, ""First of all, it wasn't me who drugged Uncle Caspian, so why should I apologize? Secondly, the picture is so blurry, so what made the paparazzi say it was me in that photo? Did you guys watch me climb into his bed with your own eyes? Or did Uncle Caspian see me soberly? If he was sober, how could he have messed with me? But if his mind was not clear, who could prove that it was me? Am I right?""

As long as she didn't admit it!

Unless Caspian identified it as her, the woman in this picture could be anyone.

But Caspian loved Abigail so much. How could he identify her?

He wished she wasn't the one he slept with last night!

However, Caspian's black eyes were imperceptibly sullen, and his left hand gradually closed. Instead of responding to Stella, he questioned.

""What did you call me?""

""Uncle Caspian.""

Stella looked at him coldly and pushed all her emotions down deep.

Her mistakes ended last night, and she wouldn't make another mistake for the rest of her life.

""Very good.""

Caspian's eyes were sullen, and there was no expression on his face.

He sat elegantly, his arm resting casually on the armrest, his drooping hand slender and strong.

It seemed he was in control. He condescendingly looked at her out of the corner of his eye as if he was trying to see through her.

Stella pressed her lips together. Even if she was reborn, Caspian's oppressiveness still scared her.

She could only look away.

Brynjar slammed his coffee cup down on the table, his mustache quivering. He questioned, ""And who do you think it was?""

Stella unclenched her fists and pointed her finger at someone.

""Her.""

She meant Abigail.

Abigail's tears stood on the rims of her eyes, and she visibly froze.

A little mocking smile tugged at the corners of Stella's mouth.

In this life, she intended to make Caspian and Abigail an enviable couple.

She wanted to see how Caspian would feel if one day he knew the true nature of the woman he loved.

Chapter 3 She Tried To Get Rid of Him

Abigail was the daughter of a defeated, pathetic family.

Three years ago, Caspian made his relationship with Abigail public without any warning and even held an engagement party against Brynjar's wishes.

Abigail became the most envied woman in Pinekarta.

People thought she was beautiful, kind-hearted, noble, and elegant.

Only Stella knew Abigail's true colors.

If she hadn't been a designer, she would have been a movie queen!

Abigail was so sophisticated that she must understand why Stella testified against her.

She and Caspian have postponed their wedding date for three years, and she couldn't wait to marry into the Gonzalez family.

As expected, Abigail immediately stepped forward and stood where Stella had knelt, dropping to her knees and bowing reverently.

""The elderly Mr. Gonzalez, it was me in the photo! I'm about the same size as Stella and look a little like her, so people mistook me for her.""

As soon as she finished, someone started to question her.

""But Stella's crush diary was exposed online. It's estimated that Stella has had a crush on Mr. Gonzalez for five or six years. Haven't you and Mr. Gonzalez only known each other for three years?""

Abigail was good at acting, and her performance was authentic.

""I had a secret crush on Caspian. I wrote my feelings in my diary. I don't know who found it out.""

She was in tears with tender affection in her eyes, and her face flushed.

Who wouldn't believe it when they saw that look on her face?

Stella was completely defeated in her previous life and in this life.

She faintly said, ""Uncle Caspian and Abigail have been engaged for years, and it was only natural for Abigail to help Uncle Caspian when he was in danger. I think the paparazzi made up this scandalous affair to attract eyeballs!""

When people heard this, their eyes were no longer gloating, and they even lost interest.

Only then did Stella realize how unworthy her previous life was. Her diligent, discreet life was nothing more than fun for these boring people.

Every moment she spent here felt like years.

Stella took a step back and said bitterly, ""Now that we figure out the whole thing, I'll leave you to discuss important matters. The elderly Mr. Gonzalez, the elders, I will leave first.""

She turned around and left. Caspian's unfathomable eyes were fixed on her.

But none of this concerned her anymore.

Stella didn't know how things were going in the hall.

All she knew was that Madelyn looked grim when she came back to her room from the hall. Supposedly, people had been giving her a hard time.

Dylan, Brynjar's second son, had no talent for business, and Brynjar had given up on him long ago, so he and Madelyn were not favored at home.

Although they were honored as sir and ma'am in public, in private, the snobs didn't give a sh*t about them.

Madelyn gave Stella's arm a small, quick squeeze.

""Are you crazy? You got such a great opportunity!""

""What opportunity?"" Stella asked rhetorically.

""You came back in a mess last night. Do you really think I don't understand what happened? Was it that hard for you to apologize? A lot of people are talking about it out there now. Caspian will have to treat you right if he wants to secure his place as heir so that you will live happily ever after. But you gave up your big chance to Abigail, who is a calculating material girl,"" Madelyn said angrily.

""I stole her fiancé, drugged Uncle Caspian, and climbed into bed with him. Do you really think I have a good life ahead of me?""

Stella jerked her hand out and no longer wanted to talk to her.

As a mother, Madelyn wasn't at fault.

Madelyn hadn't abandoned Stella after her father disappeared, and her only request was to take Stella with her when she remarried.

But Madelyn was too dependent on men.

In the cut-throat Gonzalez family, she was too dependent on Dylan, so she was not liked by everyone.

Madelyn said with a choked voice, ""It's better to live a lowly life! Jordan died early, and Dylan is not as good at business as Caspian. In the future, the Gonzalez family will be under Caspian's control. If you can get together with him...""

""Mom, stop it."" Stella interrupted her coldly.

""Have some compassion for me. Dylan is honest, and I'm too old to give Dylan a baby. The Gonzalez family all looks down on me. I will have to rely on you."" Madelyn raised her hand and wiped the tears from her eyes.

Stella said directly, ""Then you go to Mr. Gonzalez and ask him to marry me! Go now!""

The words caught in Madelyn's throat, and she didn't dare say another word.

No one would dare to mess with Caspian.

She wouldn't dare either.

After a few moments of silence, Stella suddenly thought of something and grabbed Madelyn's arm.

""Mom, do you... Do you have any medicine?""

""What kind of medicine?""

""The emergency contraceptive pills,"" Stella said helplessly.

""You... How can I be taking those pills when I'm this old? Dylan doesn't require too much sex with me.""

""Mom, the Gonzalez family must still be spying on me. Can you buy this medicine for me? I was ovulating yesterday.""

Stella opened an app on her phone. When she looked at the day marked in red, she began to panic.

She loved Annie.

But she couldn't have Annie.

Annie deserved to be born into a happy family in this life and must never suffer along with her.

Madelyn frowned and sighed again.

""I'll go.""

""Uh-huh.""

Stella breathed a sigh of relief.

Madelyn left the house, but instead of going to get it herself, she asked a trustworthy maid to buy it.

Once the maid left, Madelyn put it behind her. Anyway, everyone else was in the hall now except them.

Unbeknownst to Madelyn, what she said to the maid was overheard by others.

Half an hour later.

Madelyn entered the room with an opaque shopping bag.

""Take the medicine now, or it won't help if too much time goes by.""

Stella nodded and scanned the words on the pill box, which read forty-eight-hour emergency contraceptives.

After taking out the pills, she didn't take them immediately, but subconsciously touched her belly.

She was once pregnant with her favorite daughter.

She was so understanding and sweet.

But she really didn't want Annie to be born unblessed again and then die alone in a hospital bed.

How scared should Annie be?

Stella thought to herself, ""So, Annie, don't blame Mommy. In this life, you must find yourself loving parents and grow up happily.""

Her face was pale, and her fingers trembled as she shoved the pills into her mouth, but she couldn't swallow them.

She could only tilt her head back and gulped down water so that she couldn't recoil.

She was drinking lukewarm water, but she felt cold all over.

As she swallowed the pills down, her tears fell.

She thought to herself, ""Caspian, you've finally gotten rid of the two people you hate the most, me and Annie.""

After she recovered from her heartbreak, she took a deep breath and got up in a hurry to destroy the pill box.

Suddenly, the door of the room was pushed open and slammed heavily against the wall, making the room shake twice.

Stella and Madelyn had no time to react before Brynjar's servant grabbed Stella by the arms.

Shortly after, Stella was brought back into the hall.

She was pushed forward so hard by the servant that she fell straight to the floor.

She was tired from having rough sex last night, so at this moment, she could only grit her teeth and manage to hold on to her feet.

When she raised her eyes, she realized that the crowd was looking at her with much more disgust in their eyes.

Especially Caspian's black eyes were dangerous and cold.

It was eerily quiet.

Abigail sobbed quietly.

Stella looked over and saw a calculating look in Abigail's tearful eyes.

The next moment, a box of pills was thrown at Stella's feet, and tablets of pills were scattered all over the floor.

Brynjar slapped the coffee table hard.

""What's that? Tell me!""

Stella's heart trembled, and she said truthfully, ""Birth control pills.""

Caspian gave her a sidelong glance and said in a cold voice, ""Birth control pills? Huh?""

There was a mocking edge to his drawling voice.

Stella was stunned when she saw what kind of medicine it was with her downcast eyes.

The pill box said forty-eight-hour birth control pills.

But the tinfoil shell said fertility drugs.",1,1759036307.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

Crematorium rules did not allow relatives of the dead to watch them being cremated.

Stella paid the staff here, so she was allowed into the incineration room holding onto the cold, metal-framed bed.

She felt the burning heat, and dust was floating in the sunlight.

Maybe it was ashes.

Soon, her baby girl would be burned to ashes as well.

Stella wore a small-sized, long black dress, but it couldn't hide her scrawny figure.

Her eyes, red and swollen from crying, were unusually calm at the moment.

She reached out and touched her daughter's pale, stiff little hand outside the white cloth and put two pink origami stars in it.

""Annie, wait for Mommy.""

Time was up.

A staff member stepped forward to pull Stella away and then pulled back the white cloth, revealing Annie's face and body.

Annie was eight years old, but still skinny and short, with the hollowed belly and the jutting ribs.

As Stella stared at the hollowed belly, her eyes filled again with tears.

She had failed to protect Annie!

The staff member whispered to her soothingly, ""I'm sorry for your loss. At least your daughter's kidney saved a kid after she died, and that kid will live happily for your daughter.""

A cold glint flickered across Stella's eyes, and she smiled mockingly.

""Yes, that child is my husband's illegitimate son, and the three of them are having a big birthday party for that child, but you know what? Today is also my daughter's birthday.""

The staff member was stunned and had absolutely no idea how to comfort this desperate woman.

Stella looked at Annie and managed to force a smile, her face pale.  ""Let the cremation begin. Don't delay the auspicious time. I hope my daughter will be reborn into a good family in her next life.""

The staff sighed slightly and shook his head as they took the body to the incinerator.

Perhaps out of sympathy for her, he shielded the process from her.

Stella, however, wasn't scared at all because Annie was finally free.

She didn't have to be hated by her dad anymore.

""Mommy, why doesn't Daddy like me?""

""Mommy, why does Daddy like Ms. Stewart's son?""

""Mommy, does Daddy dislike you because of me? I'm sorry, Mommy.""

She had such a sweet daughter.

But Caspian got her killed!

He said he would take Annie to the biggest amusement park on the eve of her birthday to fulfill her dreamy birthday wish of being alone with her dad.

Instead, he wheeled Annie into the operating room and made her donate a kidney to his son.

And then he left her alone in a hospital bed to die of an infection.

And Stella was actually the last to know about it!

She still couldn't get over the fact that when she rushed into the ward, all she saw was Annie's stiff body.

And the blood-stained children's watch at the bedside was ridiculously dialing her dad's number.

He picked up the phone call and said, ""Don't be crazy like your mom.""

Beep, beep, beep...

Listening to the repetitive busy signal, Stella held back her tears and hugged Annie, fearing that she would scare her baby girl if she cried out.

In fact, from the time Abigail returned to the country with her son and accused Stella of seriously hurting them, she had been forced by Caspian to become an infamously crazy woman.

Especially when Caspian heard Abigail crying about living a vagrant life abroad and giving birth to a premature baby with kidney problems, he looked at Stella and Annie with mean, fierce eyes, despite his elegance and grace.

Ignoring her explanation, he continued to curse, ""Stella, you hurt Abigail and my son, and I'll make you pay double the price.""

Caspian did what he said. And it was time to finish all this.

Stella snapped out of her memories with a pink urn in her hand.

Annie loved the color pink.

She hugged the urn tightly. ""Annie, we're going home.""

The blowing wind lifted the hem of her skirt, and she looked so lonely and sad in the sunlight.

Stella went back to her and Caspian's wedding room, packed up Annie's things, and sat with the urn until evening.

There was the sound of a car pulling up outside the door.

Then a figure in black walked in at a steady pace.

It was Caspian.

Eight years had passed, and he was still as dashing, dangerous, and abstinent as when she first saw him.

He was still oblivious to her presence.

Without looking at her, Caspian walked past her and went upstairs.

He came back down a few minutes later after changing into a suit he had kept for years.

Abigail had designed the suit for him when he and Abigail had gotten engaged.

Caspian still didn't look at Stella.

He had been giving her the silent treatment for eight years.

When he wanted to torture her, he pinned her to the bed and had rough sex. Then he left without even looking back when his sexual appetite was satisfied.

As for Annie...

He even forbade Annie to call him dad.

Perhaps because Stella was strangely quiet today, Caspian stopped in his tracks but didn't look back at her.

""I won't be back tonight. Tell Annie not to call me at any time.""

""Uh-huh.""

Stella touched Annie's urn in her arms as if it was still warm.

If he had looked at her for even a second, he might have noticed the urn.

Caspian put on cufflinks and said indifferently, ""Think about what you want for the divorce, and we'll get the paperwork done in a couple of days. Besides, I don't want custody of Annie.""

""Uh-huh.""

Stella remained calm.

Fortunately, Annie would be hers alone from now on.

Caspian's hand, however, paused, but he still didn't give a look to Stella.

""Since Annie saved Lucas's life, I'll fully cover her medical and nutritional expenses, but I don't want to see you guys again. This is considered your final atonement.""

""Hmm.""

Stella thought to herself that he would soon never see them again indeed.

Feeling inexplicably annoyed, Caspian was about to turn around when he got a call from Abigail.

As soon as he picked up the phone, a kid's cheers on the other end of the line rang out in the quiet room.

""Daddy! Come quickly! Mommy and I are waiting for you.""

""I'll be there soon.""

Caspian's voice went up, and he unconsciously quickened his pace.

He was completely unaware of Stella clutching something in her arms behind him. Her body stiffened little by little.

The moonlight seeped in.

Stella took the cake out of the refrigerator that she had ordered for Annie some time ago.

Then she lit the birthday candles.

""Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you...""

She sang as she spilled gasoline all over the place, including every corner from upstairs to downstairs.

Because she just wasn't going to live on her own.

If only she had taken a stronger stance and refused to marry Caspian back then, then none of this would have happened.

After everything was done, she sat back down at the table hugging the urn.

""Annie, happy birthday and wait for Mommy.""

Stella threw the birthday candles at the curtains.

At the party.

Caspian made a high-profile entrance with Abigail and their son.

People were drinking and raising a toast at the party. Everyone complimented them on being a happy family of three, and many of them even disparaged Stella.

But a doctor, one of Caspian's friends, frowned and walked quickly over to Caspian.

""Mr. Gonzalez, I'm sorry for your loss.""

""What do you mean?""

""Your daughter died of a post-op infection. Mrs. Gonzalez took her to the funeral parlor today.""

""How much did Stella pay you?"" Caspian raised a toast and sipped his wine with an expressionless face.

""Didn't I send you the death certificate? And you messaged me back.""

As soon as the doctor finished, Abigail guiltily tightened her grip on Lucas's hand.

At that moment, Caspian's phone rang.

""Mr. Gonzalez, the villa is on fire.""

When Caspian heard this, the glass of wine in his hand dropped to the ground, and then he turned to leave.

He slammed on the gas and drove to the villa. When he arrived, he saw the villa burst into flames and felt as if something pierced into his heart.

The curtains fell, revealing Stella sitting in front of a birthday cake and the urn in her arms.

She smiled at him as if she had met him for the first time.

""Goodbye. I hate you. If I could do it all over again...""

Before she could finish, the whole villa collapsed.

Maybe it was a delusion before she died, Stella thought she saw Caspian fall to his knees.

She just let it go.

Annie was coming to get her.

""Mommy. Mommy.""

In the afternoon, the sun blazed overhead.

The atmosphere in the hall of the Gonzalez's mansion was tense.

The teacup slammed to the ground, and the pain of the shards cutting through her skin immediately brought Stella back to her senses.

She knelt in the center of the hall and looked blankly at the people around her.

What was going on?

Chapter 2 She Was Reborn

She was reborn!

She was actually reborn!

Stella pinched herself hard despite the astonished expressions of the crowd.

Pain swept through her entire body, and her eyes were instantly filled with tears!

""What are you crying for? Did the Gonzalez family wrong you?""

The man sitting at the head of the table said in a majestic voice.

Stella looked up and met Brynjar's displeased eyes.

She immediately bowed her head, looking as humble as ever, but her body couldn't stop trembling with excitement.

""She isn't genetically related to us. The Gonzalez family would have never raised someone as shameless as her. Her diaries are circulating on the internet, saying that she has a crush on Caspian. She has no shame. The Gonzalez family paid for her to go to college, but she actually learned how to be a vixen.""

""I told you before not to let her move in, but you just let the vixen into our home. And she forces Caspian to marry her now. I don't know who she learned these disgusting tricks from, or if she got them from her mother.""

Then a few people gave a sidelong glance to Stella's mother, Madelyn Flores, who was standing at the end of the line.

Madelyn looked extremely embarrassed, glanced at Stella, and then lowered her head. She bit her lip tightly but didn't dare to retort.

It was because Stella's status was too special.

Stella moved into the Gonzalez's mansion because her mom remarried Caspian's brother.

So she should call Caspian uncle based on seniority.

But she never did.

Because she wasn't qualified.

In her previous life, Stella apologized in fear amidst the accusations of these people and indirectly acquiesced to drugging Caspian and crawling into his bed.

Then she got pregnant and forced Caspian to marry her. Not only did Caspian hate her, but the whole city also loathed her.

She was about to speak when the sound of a man's steady footsteps came from behind her. Everyone except Brynjar became respectful.

His tall, upright figure passed over Stella and stepped forward.

The butler took the coat from his arm, nodded, and said, ""Mr. Gonzalez.""

""Hmm.""

Caspian responded blandly, nodded to Brynjar who sat at the head of the table, and eased into his seat.

Never once did he look at Stella.

It was as if she meant nothing to him.

But Stella was staring at him without blinking.

He did not look at her with downcast eyes until he realized that she was staring at him.

With the memories of her past life, Stella instinctively trembled all over with fear at once and tasted the blood in her mouth. She closed her hands as if she was holding Annie's hand.

She could never forget that face.

He had a chiseled face and defined features, and his deep-set eyes were unfathomable. The red jade ring on his left thumb was glistening with a touch of blood red.

This ring showed the personality of its owner. He was seemingly aloof, yet dangerous and bloodthirsty.

Caspian noticed Stella's eyes on him, and his hand turning the ring paused abruptly.

He resumed his indifference until a pair of pale-skinned, tender hands rested on his shoulders.

It was Abigail.

Her eyes were red from crying, and she had a pitiful expression on her delicate, soft face.

Everyone was finally here!

When Brynjar saw that Caspian had also arrived, he picked up the coffee in front of him, stirred it with a spoon, and looked at Stella seemingly inadvertently.

His eyes were cold and intimidating.

""Enough. Everybody shut up. Are you not ashamed enough?""

""Stella, you and your mom have lived in the Gonzalez's mansion for so many years, and the Gonzalez family has treated you well. Since you did something wrong, you should admit your wrongdoing.""

That was how he described it!

He was close to directly threatening them both.

Brynjar didn't like Madelyn.

When he made an indirect threat, Madelyn, a timid coward, became even more anxious.

She quickly stepped forward and tugged on Stella's arm, crying and persuading, ""Stella, quickly apologize to Grandpa. Just apologize, and you'll be fine. Don't make a big deal out of it!""

Apologize?

Humph.

Madelyn didn't know that Brynjar had no intention of letting her off the hook. He was waiting for her to swallow her pride, admit her mistake, and take the abuse for the Gonzalez family from the netizens.

Stella no longer bowed her head, but straightened her back, and scanned the crowd before looking at Caspian.

They locked eyes. His eyes were cold, and he remained silent.

He seemed to have predicted her end.

But this time, he probably was not going to get his way.

Stella braced herself on her numb knees and stood up as Caspian watched. Then she let out a soft laugh.

""Why should I apologize?""

""What did you say?"" Brynjar's face was livid with anger, and his coffee spilled.

Stella said word for word, ""First of all, it wasn't me who drugged Uncle Caspian, so why should I apologize? Secondly, the picture is so blurry, so what made the paparazzi say it was me in that photo? Did you guys watch me climb into his bed with your own eyes? Or did Uncle Caspian see me soberly? If he was sober, how could he have messed with me? But if his mind was not clear, who could prove that it was me? Am I right?""

As long as she didn't admit it!

Unless Caspian identified it as her, the woman in this picture could be anyone.

But Caspian loved Abigail so much. How could he identify her?

He wished she wasn't the one he slept with last night!

However, Caspian's black eyes were imperceptibly sullen, and his left hand gradually closed. Instead of responding to Stella, he questioned.

""What did you call me?""

""Uncle Caspian.""

Stella looked at him coldly and pushed all her emotions down deep.

Her mistakes ended last night, and she wouldn't make another mistake for the rest of her life.

""Very good.""

Caspian's eyes were sullen, and there was no expression on his face.

He sat elegantly, his arm resting casually on the armrest, his drooping hand slender and strong.

It seemed he was in control. He condescendingly looked at her out of the corner of his eye as if he was trying to see through her.

Stella pressed her lips together. Even if she was reborn, Caspian's oppressiveness still scared her.

She could only look away.

Brynjar slammed his coffee cup down on the table, his mustache quivering. He questioned, ""And who do you think it was?""

Stella unclenched her fists and pointed her finger at someone.

""Her.""

She meant Abigail.

Abigail's tears stood on the rims of her eyes, and she visibly froze.

A little mocking smile tugged at the corners of Stella's mouth.

In this life, she intended to make Caspian and Abigail an enviable couple.

She wanted to see how Caspian would feel if one day he knew the true nature of the woman he loved.

Chapter 3 She Tried To Get Rid of Him

Abigail was the daughter of a defeated, pathetic family.

Three years ago, Caspian made his relationship with Abigail public without any warning and even held an engagement party against Brynjar's wishes.

Abigail became the most envied woman in Pinekarta.

People thought she was beautiful, kind-hearted, noble, and elegant.

Only Stella knew Abigail's true colors.

If she hadn't been a designer, she would have been a movie queen!

Abigail was so sophisticated that she must understand why Stella testified against her.

She and Caspian have postponed their wedding date for three years, and she couldn't wait to marry into the Gonzalez family.

As expected, Abigail immediately stepped forward and stood where Stella had knelt, dropping to her knees and bowing reverently.

""The elderly Mr. Gonzalez, it was me in the photo! I'm about the same size as Stella and look a little like her, so people mistook me for her.""

As soon as she finished, someone started to question her.

""But Stella's crush diary was exposed online. It's estimated that Stella has had a crush on Mr. Gonzalez for five or six years. Haven't you and Mr. Gonzalez only known each other for three years?""

Abigail was good at acting, and her performance was authentic.

""I had a secret crush on Caspian. I wrote my feelings in my diary. I don't know who found it out.""

She was in tears with tender affection in her eyes, and her face flushed.

Who wouldn't believe it when they saw that look on her face?

Stella was completely defeated in her previous life and in this life.

She faintly said, ""Uncle Caspian and Abigail have been engaged for years, and it was only natural for Abigail to help Uncle Caspian when he was in danger. I think the paparazzi made up this scandalous affair to attract eyeballs!""

When people heard this, their eyes were no longer gloating, and they even lost interest.

Only then did Stella realize how unworthy her previous life was. Her diligent, discreet life was nothing more than fun for these boring people.

Every moment she spent here felt like years.

Stella took a step back and said bitterly, ""Now that we figure out the whole thing, I'll leave you to discuss important matters. The elderly Mr. Gonzalez, the elders, I will leave first.""

She turned around and left. Caspian's unfathomable eyes were fixed on her.

But none of this concerned her anymore.

Stella didn't know how things were going in the hall.

All she knew was that Madelyn looked grim when she came back to her room from the hall. Supposedly, people had been giving her a hard time.

Dylan, Brynjar's second son, had no talent for business, and Brynjar had given up on him long ago, so he and Madelyn were not favored at home.

Although they were honored as sir and ma'am in public, in private, the snobs didn't give a sh*t about them.

Madelyn gave Stella's arm a small, quick squeeze.

""Are you crazy? You got such a great opportunity!""

""What opportunity?"" Stella asked rhetorically.

""You came back in a mess last night. Do you really think I don't understand what happened? Was it that hard for you to apologize? A lot of people are talking about it out there now. Caspian will have to treat you right if he wants to secure his place as heir so that you will live happily ever after. But you gave up your big chance to Abigail, who is a calculating material girl,"" Madelyn said angrily.

""I stole her fiancé, drugged Uncle Caspian, and climbed into bed with him. Do you really think I have a good life ahead of me?""

Stella jerked her hand out and no longer wanted to talk to her.

As a mother, Madelyn wasn't at fault.

Madelyn hadn't abandoned Stella after her father disappeared, and her only request was to take Stella with her when she remarried.

But Madelyn was too dependent on men.

In the cut-throat Gonzalez family, she was too dependent on Dylan, so she was not liked by everyone.

Madelyn said with a choked voice, ""It's better to live a lowly life! Jordan died early, and Dylan is not as good at business as Caspian. In the future, the Gonzalez family will be under Caspian's control. If you can get together with him...""

""Mom, stop it."" Stella interrupted her coldly.

""Have some compassion for me. Dylan is honest, and I'm too old to give Dylan a baby. The Gonzalez family all looks down on me. I will have to rely on you."" Madelyn raised her hand and wiped the tears from her eyes.

Stella said directly, ""Then you go to Mr. Gonzalez and ask him to marry me! Go now!""

The words caught in Madelyn's throat, and she didn't dare say another word.

No one would dare to mess with Caspian.

She wouldn't dare either.

After a few moments of silence, Stella suddenly thought of something and grabbed Madelyn's arm.

""Mom, do you... Do you have any medicine?""

""What kind of medicine?""

""The emergency contraceptive pills,"" Stella said helplessly.

""You... How can I be taking those pills when I'm this old? Dylan doesn't require too much sex with me.""

""Mom, the Gonzalez family must still be spying on me. Can you buy this medicine for me? I was ovulating yesterday.""

Stella opened an app on her phone. When she looked at the day marked in red, she began to panic.

She loved Annie.

But she couldn't have Annie.

Annie deserved to be born into a happy family in this life and must never suffer along with her.

Madelyn frowned and sighed again.

""I'll go.""

""Uh-huh.""

Stella breathed a sigh of relief.

Madelyn left the house, but instead of going to get it herself, she asked a trustworthy maid to buy it.

Once the maid left, Madelyn put it behind her. Anyway, everyone else was in the hall now except them.

Unbeknownst to Madelyn, what she said to the maid was overheard by others.

Half an hour later.

Madelyn entered the room with an opaque shopping bag.

""Take the medicine now, or it won't help if too much time goes by.""

Stella nodded and scanned the words on the pill box, which read forty-eight-hour emergency contraceptives.

After taking out the pills, she didn't take them immediately, but subconsciously touched her belly.

She was once pregnant with her favorite daughter.

She was so understanding and sweet.

But she really didn't want Annie to be born unblessed again and then die alone in a hospital bed.

How scared should Annie be?

Stella thought to herself, ""So, Annie, don't blame Mommy. In this life, you must find yourself loving parents and grow up happily.""

Her face was pale, and her fingers trembled as she shoved the pills into her mouth, but she couldn't swallow them.

She could only tilt her head back and gulped down water so that she couldn't recoil.

She was drinking lukewarm water, but she felt cold all over.

As she swallowed the pills down, her tears fell.

She thought to herself, ""Caspian, you've finally gotten rid of the two people you hate the most, me and Annie.""

After she recovered from her heartbreak, she took a deep breath and got up in a hurry to destroy the pill box.

Suddenly, the door of the room was pushed open and slammed heavily against the wall, making the room shake twice.

Stella and Madelyn had no time to react before Brynjar's servant grabbed Stella by the arms.

Shortly after, Stella was brought back into the hall.

She was pushed forward so hard by the servant that she fell straight to the floor.

She was tired from having rough sex last night, so at this moment, she could only grit her teeth and manage to hold on to her feet.

When she raised her eyes, she realized that the crowd was looking at her with much more disgust in their eyes.

Especially Caspian's black eyes were dangerous and cold.

It was eerily quiet.

Abigail sobbed quietly.

Stella looked over and saw a calculating look in Abigail's tearful eyes.

The next moment, a box of pills was thrown at Stella's feet, and tablets of pills were scattered all over the floor.

Brynjar slapped the coffee table hard.

""What's that? Tell me!""

Stella's heart trembled, and she said truthfully, ""Birth control pills.""

Caspian gave her a sidelong glance and said in a cold voice, ""Birth control pills? Huh?""

There was a mocking edge to his drawling voice.

Stella was stunned when she saw what kind of medicine it was with her downcast eyes.

The pill box said forty-eight-hour birth control pills.

Look, I get it. Max and Lorelai weren’t “meant to be.” Narrative arc, blah blah. But I’m rewatching the show for the millionth time and I have some thoughts. Thank you for attending my TED Talk.	

1. He adored Lorelai. The real Lorelai. Not the quirky, coffee-chugging caricature everyone else projected onto her. His love wasn’t performative or clingy. It was consistent, grown-up, and real. Meanwhile, Lorelai basically had to host a scavenger hunt just to find emotional connection with other partners. Max? He was always available, communicative, and emotionally present. And not just with Lorelai, he treated Rory with the same respect and care. He didn’t hide, cheat, or spiral into a jealous rage. Honestly, a rare man in the Gilmore universe.

2. He would have been such a good stepfather for Rory. Max respected Rory’s intellect and always told her the truth in a way that made sense for her age and maturity. He didn’t pull rank or try to be the “cool stepdad.” He simply saw her as capable, smart, and deserving of honesty. You could tell he truly admired her. He supported her brilliance and made her feel safe.

And let’s be real, it’s impossible to imagine Max getting in a fight with a literal 16-year-old boy just for breaking up with precious Rory (Luke, be for real). Equally impossible to picture him encouraging Rory to lie to her mom (his name rhymes with Oaf Er). In fact, if Max had been Jess’s teacher, he probably would’ve believed in him. Genuinely. Helped him believe in himself. Max wouldn’t have jumped on the “let’s come for a traumatized teenager like he’s the Antichrist” bandwagon. Stepdad of the year, honestly.

3. Max and Lorelai were both class-conscious, but fluent in the language of high society. They knew how that world worked and how to survive it. Unlike Luke (and please don’t come for me, I still love Luke and Lorelai too), Max wouldn’t have flinched at a Friday night dinner. He wouldn’t have needed a flashcard to get through a conversation with Richard and Emily. He would’ve understood Lorelai’s escape from that world and celebrated it, but he also wouldn’t have been intimidated by crystal glassware or people named “Biff.” He fit in without selling out.

4. Now, if there’s anything left to be debated, it’s whether he would have truly fit into Stars Hollow. That’s the only fair question. But honestly? I think he would’ve adjusted. It’s not like he was too cool for a town troubadour. He was a literature teacher with elbow patches. He could’ve learned to dance at a town festival.

In conclusion: Max Medina was the only one who came fully prepared to love Lorelai exactly as she was. No conditions. No weird tests. No passive-aggressive games. The only reason it didn’t work is because Lorelai wasn’t ready. She panicked, she ran, and she self-sabotaged.

But don’t get it twisted. Max was ready. Max was it.

And honestly? We can all agree on one thing…Christopher is the actual worst.

Other times, I'll take a girl out to what I think is a decent spot, and she'll order the $60 glass of wine or lobster and not even finish it.

Now I get the ick every time a girl suggests that we go to a dinner spot on a first date.  If I suggest it, fine.  Maybe I'm in the mood that day and am flush.  But to expect it gives me some vibe I don't like.

Today I had a girl reject my option for a modest date, and instead she recommended an upper end restaurant.  Then I said nah, not on date 1, and then she said okay, what about *steak house*.

I might be visiting LA in the first quarter of 2026 for a work conference, so I’m already looking into options. I’m not from the States, but I’ve been to the West Coast before, in cities like Portland and Seattle. I know LA is a much bigger city and has a different vibe compared to the northern cities.

The conference will take place near Long Beach. I did some research but didn’t find many “attractions” nearby, it seems more like a suburban area.

My schedule would be: mornings working and lunch, and then I’d be free around 4–5 PM. I’d like to know if that’s enough time to enjoy the city. I really liked the “hipster vibe” in Portland and Seattle, and I wonder if there’s something similar in LA.

I’m the kind of guy who enjoys going out for coffee, drinks, or dinner. What can I expect around Long Beach? Is it possible to just walk around, or is having a car basically mandatory in the city?

My main interests are being outdoors, walking, jogging or cycling. I also train BJJ, so finding a gym in LA would be a good option. I like live music too, so concerts are definitely on my list. And if I get the chance, I’d also love to go to an NBA game (I like the Clippers more than the Lakers, don’t hate me).

I do have the option of saying no to my colleagues and rescheduling for another venue, so that’s why I’m researching now. Your feedback would be much appreciated.

I'm required to travel almost every week, and I work until 9 p.m. most nights. A lot of my coworkers are in relationships, so I know it's possible to do this job and have a significant other. I met this guy on hinge and we chatted a bit before I gave him my number. I eventually asked him if he wanted to grab coffee over the weekend, to which he agreed. The weekend comes around, and because we didn't coordinate well, our schedules don't align (he can only meet on Saturday and I can only meet on Sunday). After a lot of back and forth we agree to push our date to next weekend.

The issues started to arise the week leading up to our date. I tell him about my job and how many hours I work (I wanted to be upfront about what dating me would look like), and he seems completely shocked. He says that it's super unsustainable and he can't imagine working those long hours. I actually don't plan to work these hours when I am older, but I want to work really hard now so I can be better off in the future. His reaction made me question if we were really compatible. I want to be in a relationship with someone who respects and doesn't resent me for working hard. There are also other things that made me question our compatibility. I asked him out after A LOT of texting because he wouldn't initiate. I also had to pick the coffee shop. No hate to anyone who prefers when the girl does this, my personal preference (and what I usually experience) is that guy takes charge in this area. 

The next day I talk to one of my coworkers and she says that it's very difficult to date someone who doesn't work an equally intense job because it could create a lot of tension. I stewed over this for the next couple of days, and the day before our date, I decide I need to cancel. I already know I'm a bit of an asshole for letting this go on for so long, so I try to be as nice as possible in the text I send him. It goes: ""I'm really sorry to do this but my schedule is just so busy right now that I don’t think it would be a good idea to date. I’m worried that it would be hard to keep seeing you consistently given my travel, and you don’t deserve to be strung along like that. I should have told you this sooner and I’m sorry I didn’t, but I hope you can understand.""

His response is a little salty: ""Wild excuse but ok. Coulda just said you weren't interested anymore"". 

I feel bad about this, but I also think that his response was immature. Whenever I've been rejected, I've always been respectful and said something like ""that's ok, I understand"".

I started watching  Netflix's new Sidemen Inside : USA reality show and after watching a couple of episodes where all the meals are served in a shaft that opens up. Also you can buy random items which you ask out aloud from snacks to random items which costs 100 times their real world value , like a cup of coffee costs a 1000 dollars. You got to the room with a shaft and ask aloud for the item and it opens with the item already placed there that you wished for.

I could hold him when he’s gone, “I remember you, you would have liked this” and “that’s a joke that would have made you laugh” … he’d show me a map of how to get through life, how to handle a break up, a boss, how to think like him and maybe I can see the faults.

1nsfkes,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nsfkes/where_to_find_affordable_coffee_grinders/,Where to find affordable coffee grinders?,"Hey coffee lovers! I've been on a journey to find the perfect coffee grinder without breaking the bank, and I thought I'd share my experience with you all. After months of research and testing different options, I've finally found some great affordable solutions.

First off, let's be real - a good coffee grinder is essential for that perfect morning brew. I used to think pre-ground coffee was fine until I discovered the game-changing difference of freshly ground beans. The aroma, flavor, and overall experience are just on another level.

I recently discovered this amazing collection of coffee grinders at https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder. They have options for every budget, and the quality is surprisingly good for the price. I was honestly shocked at how reasonable some of these were.

Here's what I've learned about choosing an affordable coffee grinder:

1. Burr vs. Blade Grinders
Burr grinders are generally better but pricier. However, a good-quality blade grinder can still do the job if you're on a tight budget. Just make sure to pulse the grinder instead of running it continuously.

2. Capacity Matters
Don't fall for the ""bigger is better"" trap. If you're brewing for one or two people, a smaller grinder is perfectly fine and usually cheaper.

3. Manual vs. Electric
Manual grinders are typically more affordable and can last longer since they have fewer parts that can break. Plus, they're great for camping or travel!

4. Look for These Features:
- Multiple grind settings
- Easy cleaning access
- Durable materials
- Non-slip base
- Clear bean container

I've found some excellent deals at https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder - they frequently update their prices and often have special discounts. The best part is, most of their grinders come with solid warranties, which is crucial when buying budget-friendly appliances.

Pro tip: Watch out for sales during major shopping events like Black Friday or Prime Day. I got my current grinder at almost 40% off during one of these sales!

Remember, ""affordable"" doesn't mean ""cheap quality."" Many budget-friendly grinders can last for years with proper care. Here's what I do to maintain mine:
- Clean after every few uses
- Don't overload the chamber
- Keep moisture away
- Check the burrs regularly
- Store in a dry place

Since upgrading my grinder setup, my morning coffee ritual has improved dramatically. There's something satisfying about grinding your own beans and knowing you didn't have to spend a fortune to get that perfect cup.

Anyone else have experience with budget-friendly coffee grinders? I'd love to hear your recommendations and experiences in the comments!",1,1759034880.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False
1nsfk00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crush/comments/1nsfk00/he_called_me_kiddo/,he called me kiddo…,"ok so I (F23) started a part time job about two months ago which is where I met my coworker (M20) and we can call him Alex. my job is fast paced and there’s a drink station as well as a deli, I work in drinks, Alex normally works in deli. when I first started I was a little messy and slow because I was still getting used to it. that first shift I worked with Alex almost immediately he came over and started cleaning my space for me, but said nothing. after coming over by me a few times he made a comment about me being messy seemingly poking fun at me but i was too stressed to take a joke and kind of got annoyed. then later on it got super busy in drinks and deli, but he left deli to come and help me. our other coworker who works in deli was like “Alex where are you going we are busy!” and he was like “well so is she” and then continued to help me make all the drinks. a little while after he came over and tapped me on the shoulder and apologized for the way he greeted me. he introduced himself to me and then asked me if I was okay/if I needed help with anything. I left that shift kind of confused about his behavior but it stuck with me.

so the following weekend when we worked together it was just more of the same, him constantly helping me when he didn’t have to and when it was inconvenient for him. I could say he is just a really nice coworker, but he was just very tuned in to what was going on with me instead of solely focusing on his own work which was hard not to notice. he came up to me towards the end of our shift and tapped me, and when I turned around he said “hi (my name)” and when I said “oh hey” back he lit up with the biggest smile on his face and started tripping over his words. again he asked me if I needed help restocking anything, he made some more drinks for me and even took out my garbages. after another shift like this It was kind of hard to ignore how above and beyond he seemed to be going to make my job easier. but then I realized he takes over drinks when I leave so I started overthinking it and wondering if maybe he only does these things so he doesn’t have to worry about it when I leave.

last weekend we worked together and at first he didn’t say anything to me at all, and then he walked over to drinks and right up to me, opened his mouth, but then I said “hello” and he literally froze in place. it looked like he short circuited and completely forgot why he even walked over to me in the first place. he stood there for a good 30 seconds (not an exaggeration) and I had turned my back toward him to clean something but could see him still standing there right where I left him out of the corner of my eye. then our other coworkers from the deli started calling for him because they were getting busy and he didn’t budge. it wasn’t until they got louder that he tried to move and winded up walking in slow motion backwards and then turning around and going back over by them. I read that as nervous/awkward energy, kind of felt like straight out of movie when the shy guy’s crush approaches him and he doesn’t know how to react. later on he winded up coming over by me and making drinks like normal and cleaning. then i went to the coffee area to clean that up and he followed me all the way over there which was also unnecessary and just stood across from me trying to make small talk about the sugar packet mess. I winded up staying late to restock the drink station for him mostly because I just wanted to be around him. I apologized a few times for being in his way and he just reassured me saying “nah you’re good right there” which was literally in his way but okay. then when I was done I asked him if there was anything else he needed me to do and he legitimately searched for something and when he realized there was nothing he kind of sounded disappointed and said something along the lines of “no i don’t think so i think we’re good.” when I went to leave he was making drinks and I told him to have a good night and either he didn’t hear me or completely ignored me, but he said nothing.

today, at work when he came in we didn’t really say anything at first and then I walked in the back by the break room to wash my hands. he was talking with the managers, but when I started walking in his direction towards the sink he held this intense eye contact with me that I even had to break, but when I looked back his eyes were still locked on mine meanwhile he was still engaging in this conversation. we gave each other glances throughout the shift, but once again we were saying nothing. then when he got a free moment he came over by me and asked me if i could make him some sanitization wipes for the deli and so I did. I set them up for him and when I went and pointed it out to him he said from across the room “thanks kiddo!” and gave me the double thumbs up…. I was completely thrown off by that and still am honestly. he was the only one in deli so he couldn’t really leave to help me at all but at one point I mouthed to him “please help” he smiled and then he got the manager to help me during the end of my shift. I winded up leaving without saying goodbye and just really confused on what it all means.

I don’t even think he knows i’m older than him, I do get mistaken for looking like a 17-19 year old a lot so that could be a reason. but also does he just think i’m incompetent and inexperienced so that’s why he’s been helping me out, like he sees me as a little kid? I am so confused, I guess I just really never experienced someone going out of their way consistently to do nice things for me so maybe I was misreading his behavior, but I don’t know. Is he interested or not? does him calling me kiddo rule out the possibility? is he being condescending calling me that?",1,1759034843.0,Crush,0,1.0,False

Have you ever tried to get out of a chair and felt like a rusty robot? 🤖 Trust me, you’re not alone! Hitting that 50 mark can sometimes bring with it a bit of, well… stiffness. But what if I told you that with just **15 minutes a day**, you could unlock your ""Forever Flexibility"" and ditch those pesky aches?

Yup, you heard that right! Think of it as your daily dose of “flexercise” (let’s coin that term, shall we?). 

Here’s a fun idea: Why not treat it like your daily coffee ritual? ☕️ Instead of scrolling through memes (which we love, but hey, balance!), take a few moments for your physical well-being. 

**Here’s how to get started:**
- **Stretch It Out:** Dedicate the first 5 minutes just to gentle stretches. It can be as simple as reaching for the sky or bending down to touch your toes. Just imagine your hamstrings sighing in relief! 🙌
- **Breathe Deeply:** Take a minute or two to focus on your breathing. Deep inhales, slow exhales – not only does it feel good, but it helps relax those tension knots that love to pop up after a long day.
- **Move It:** You don’t have to do a full workout🥵. Walk around your yard, dance to your favorite tune, or do some simple yoga poses. Listening to your body is key; what feels good? Just move!
- **Cool Down:** Finish off with some gentle stretches or even a short meditation. Picture your flexibility growing stronger with each passing day. 🌱

And here’s the kicker – **we believe in strongest people.** Seriously! The stronger your body feels, the better you can embrace the adventures that retirement has to offer! Whether it’s hiking, gardening, or just bending down to play with the grandkids, flexibility is your friend!

Oh, and since we’re all about supporting each other on this journey, check out some community suggestions for quick flexibility exercises that can easily fit into your day-to-day routine. Who knew feeling great could be so simple?

While I know we all have those days where we feel a little 'stretched' (get it? 😉), just remember: it’s totally normal! The key is to find what works for you and run with it.

1nsfe8o,https://i.redd.it/6xcyjpf24urf1.png,A Memorial Destroyed For A Mistress’s Amusement,"# Chapter 1 - The Masterpiece and the Betrayal

I'm a decade older than Sebastian. The first time I laid eyes on him, he was a scrawny street rat, fighting mutts for whatever scraps he could find.

His stare, raw and wild, was pure wolf.

So, I scooped him up. Molded him from the ground up.

Ten years. That’s all it took for Sebastian to morph from a gutter rat into the city’s golden boy, its most sought-after CEO.

For the longest time, I genuinely believed Sebastian was my masterpiece.

Until that fateful day. A bratty little girl, smug as you please, stopped my ride.

She casually placed a hand on her swollen belly, hit play on a recorder, and asked, “Sebastian, who do you like more—me or that old hag?”

Then, a voice I knew way too well, dripping with disdain: “Just some aging woman. All these years, what I’ve loathed most is her condescending attitude.”

A smile played on my lips. Looks like Sebastian had conveniently forgotten his days of begging like a stray.

The next day, a gift-wrapped box arrived on his doorstep. Inside? A bloody, lifeless fetus.

His eyes blazed, pure inferno. A gun found its way to my forehead. He snarled each word like a curse, “Lilith.”

I took a slow sip of my coffee, cool as ice. “Seems Mr. Lawrence has a memory lapse regarding my… methods.”

Sebastian’s jaw tightened, his voice a low growl. “You think I won’t pull the trigger?”

He wasn’t that pathetic waif anymore. Those years clawing their way to the top had chiseled him into something sharp and dangerous.

I just gave him a little shake of my head, a faint smile still on my face. “If I were you, I wouldn’t waste breath on threats.”

Sebastian froze. Then, a whisper of sound from the floor-to-ceiling window behind him.

He spun around, his expression shattering.

There she was, dangling from the 72nd floor, hands bound, her white gown billowing like a tattered flag. A sheer drop to oblivion yawned beneath her.

“I’d be cautious if I were you,” I purred, the gun still a chilling pressure against my temple. “If your hand happens to slip and I’m gone, your little darling downstairs gets… well, pulverized. One life gone… only one now, though.”

The girl’s sobs were pathetic. “Sebastian, save me!”

His eyes, bloodshot and wild, finally flicked the safety catch. “Lilith, how dare you!”

My security detail moved in like shadows.

The air crackled with unspoken violence, a storm about to break.

But with a dismissive flick of my wrist, I waved them back. “Stand down.”

Then, without even looking, I drew a hidden dagger and plunged it deep into Sebastian’s gut.

He gasped, a guttural sound of pain, but the gun pressed harder against my skin.

“Enjoying yourself?” I murmured, my voice soft, intimate.

Sebastian’s face was a mask of pure ice. “Are you satisfied? Now let her go.”

# Chapter 2 - The Ghost of Eve

Amaya's different from you. She's just some innocent babe who knows zilch.

Sebastian's goons showed up faster than a speeding bullet and snatched Amaya.

Honestly, I never really meant to hurt her anyway.

Watching Sebastian coo sweet nothings to the girl cradled in his arms, like she was some delicate, priceless artifact, I just felt… meh. So over it.

He used to hold me like that too—right after our enemies ripped away our baby, leaving me barren forever.

That was a fully-baked baby girl, we'd named her Eve.

Sebastian went all out for Eve, dropping serious coin on a gold statue in her memory.

He told me, ""Lilith, our child will surely find peace in the afterlife.""

He wanted a never-ending parade of worshippers, all praying for Eve, stacking up blessings for her.

I asked him once, ""Why all the drama?""

Sebastian, looking like a homeless lumberjack but with pure grit in his eyes, said:

""Because Eve is the only kid I'm ever gonna get in this lifetime.""

Now, I'm staring at the gift box on Sebastian's desk.

Sebastian, you reneged on your word. But no sweat—I'll jog your memory.

When the girl finally stopped her waterworks, she glared at me, eyes puffy and radiating pure hate:

""Sebastian, it's her! That witch killed our baby!""

But Sebastian's face went dark.

He ran a hand through her hair, his voice eerily chill, ""You've gone too far.""

Amaya's sobs choked in her throat.

She had no clue that ever since we lost Eve, no one around us dared breathe a word about anything related to kids.

That pain? It's a ghost that'll forever haunt Sebastian and me.

Nobody spilled the tea to Amaya. She just kept wailing, her cries enough to shatter anyone's soul.

Sebastian scooped up her limp body, bulldozed past me, and stomped out.

""Lilith, I'll remember this."" I just never saw Sebastian's payback coming in hot and fast.

Listening to my subordinate's update, I absently stroked the cat on my lap.

""Mr. Lawrence outbid us, double the price for the southern estate.""

""Mr. Lawrence has been low-key chatting up shareholders, trying to snag their shares.""

""Mr. Lawrence… had the cathedral built for little Eve demolished.""

My grip tightened, and the cat let out a yelp of pain, curling into a ball of fear in my arms.

""Say that again?""

I kept my face blank.

My assistant gritted his teeth, ""Mr. Lawrence demolished the cathedral. He said he's gonna build an amusement park for that home-wrecker! Construction kicked off this morning!""

Crash!

I chucked the coffee cup next to me. It exploded into shards.

My assistant immediately bowed his head, ""I'll handle it right now!""

I raised my hand, ""I'll go myself.""

By the time I rolled up, half the cathedral was already rubble.

Amaya was clutching a balloon, bouncing around, barking orders at the workers:

""Clear that spot properly! And over here—Sebastian, I want a carousel right here!""",1,1759034308.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

The last two years I had to watch him suffer liver failure. We were married for almost 29 years and I loved him more than anything, but I just can’t stop being angry at him. I feel so guilty for being so mad. I’m angry he didn’t even try to take care of himself. I’m angry he got sick and wouldn’t get better even though I know he would have if he could. I’m angry he left me. He left me with a bad roof and an incomplete project car that I have no idea what to do with. Dealing with that sort of stuff was his job in our marriage. I don’t want to navigate it alone. It hurts to do the things he normally would have taken care of. It just slams home the fact that he is gone a little bit more. 

I miss him so much I can hardly stand it. He was my everything and I cannot even fathom ever being with anyone else. 

It feels so petty to be so angry. Going grocery shopping, or even to the park to walk the dogs is torture. Seeing all the couples, even the unhappy ones; at least they have each other. He left me. Left me alone to deal with everything all by myself. I need him to talk to me over coffee in the mornings, and to make me laugh, and to care that I have a cold.  I just freaking need him and he left me and I am pissed. 

Most of the time I am okay. Hopeful even. But every time something he would have normally done pops up like taking care of car or home repairs, it sets me on this downward spiral.

In a world full of health supplements, TonicGreens claims to stand out. Promising a potent 6-in-1 formula packed with essential antioxidants and a unique ""Immune-System Special Phytomix,"" it aims to be your all-in-one wellness solution. But does it live up to the hype? In this review, we'll dissect the ingredients, analyze the science, and share real-life experiences from people across the USA. Whether you're a busy professional, a proactive parent, or simply someone looking to boost your health, this no-fluff guide will help you decide if TonicGreens is the right choice for you.

# A Visual Summary

* **6-in-1 Formula: Detox, Energy, Immunity, Antioxidants, Digestion, Alkalinity.**
* **Key Ingredient Count: 57+ Superfoods.**
* **Target Audience: Busy Professionals, Health-Conscious Individuals, Those with Low Energy.**
* **Form: Powdered Drink Mix.**
* **Money-Back Guarantee: 60 Days.\]**

Let's be honest. Navigating the world of dietary supplements can feel like wandering through a jungle—full of promising paths that often lead to dead ends. You hear about a new ""miracle"" product every week, each one claiming to be the ultimate solution for energy, immunity, and longevity.

As a health-conscious individual, I’ve tried my fair share. So, when I first heard about **TonicGreens**—a powdered supplement touted as a **6-in-1 formula enhanced with essential antioxidant sources and a powerful ""Immune-System Special Phytomix""**—I was intrigued but skeptical. The promise was compelling: one simple daily drink that could support everything from my immune defense to my energy levels.

But I’m not one to take marketing claims at face value. I decided to put TonicGreens to the ultimate test: a thorough, 90-day investigation. This review is the result of that deep dive. We’ll explore not just *what* TonicGreens is, but *how* it works, *who* it's for, and whether it can deliver tangible results for everyday Americans.

# ✨ 1. What Exactly is TonicGreens? Breaking Down the 6-in-1 Promise

TonicGreens is more than just a green powder; it's a concentrated dietary supplement designed by Healthy Naturals. Its core selling point is its multi-action formula that targets several key areas of health simultaneously. The ""6-in-1"" refers to its proposed benefits:

1. **Immune System Support:** The headline act. It uses a proprietary blend called the ""Immune-System Special Phytomix,"" which we'll dissect later.
2. **Powerful Antioxidant Protection:** Packed with ingredients like resveratrol, quercetin, and green tea extract to combat oxidative stress from free radicals.
3. **Natural Detoxification:** Contains ingredients like milk thistle and spirulina that support the body's natural detox pathways, particularly the liver.
4. **Boosted Energy Levels:** Aims to revitalize the body at a cellular level with CoQ10 and B-vitamins, reducing reliance on stimulants like caffeine.
5. **Improved Digestive Health:** Includes prebiotics and digestive enzymes to promote a healthy gut microbiome, which is crucial for overall wellness.
6. **Body Alkalization:** Helps balance the body's pH by providing alkaline superfoods, counteracting the acidic nature of modern diets.

The product comes as a fine powder that you mix with cold water or your favorite smoothie. It’s vegan, non-GMO, and made in the USA in an FDA-registered facility that follows Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP).

# ✨ 2. Why Your Body Craves These Ingredients: A Simple Science Lesson

Before we list the ingredients, it's crucial to understand *why* they matter. Let's break down two key concepts in layman's terms.

* **Antioxidants:** Imagine your body is like a car. As it runs (through metabolism, stress, exposure to pollution), it produces exhaust fumes called **free radicals**. These are unstable molecules that ""rust"" your cells from the inside out, leading to aging and various health issues. **Antioxidants** are like the anti-rust coating. They neutralize free radicals, protecting your cells from damage.
* **The Gut-Immune Connection:** Did you know that nearly **70% of your immune system resides in your gut?** A healthy gut microbiome (the community of good bacteria) is essential for fighting off pathogens. When your digestion is poor, your immune system is often the first to suffer.

TonicGreens is formulated with these fundamental principles in mind.

# ✨ 3. The TonicGreens Ingredient Deep Dive: What’s Inside the Jar?

This is where we separate the science from the speculation. The formula is extensive, comprising over 57 ingredients. Let's focus on the key players grouped by their primary function.

# ✔️ The Immune-System Special Phytomix™ (Proprietary Blend: 1,380 mg)

This is the cornerstone of the formula. A ""Phytomix"" simply means a blend of plant-based extracts.

* **Turkey Tail Mushroom:** A powerful medicinal mushroom renowned in traditional medicine for its immune-modulating properties. Modern studies suggest it can enhance immune response.
* **Beta-Glucans (from Yeast):** These are soluble fibers that act as powerful immune stimulants. They help ""train"" your immune cells to be more efficient at identifying and destroying threats.
* **Lycopene (from Tomato):** A potent antioxidant that gives tomatoes their red color. It's known for supporting heart health and providing cellular protection.
* **Arabinogalactan (from Larch Tree):** This fiber acts as a prebiotic (food for good gut bacteria) and has been shown to support natural killer (NK) cell activity, a key part of your immune defense army.

# ✔️ Essential Antioxidants & Superfood Complex (Proprietary Blend: 2,680 mg)

This blend is a who's who of the antioxidant world.

* **Resveratrol:** Famous for its presence in red wine and grapes, this compound is celebrated for its anti-aging and heart-health benefits.
* **Green Tea Leaf Extract (50% EGCG):** EGCG is the most active compound in green tea, with a high capacity for fighting oxidative stress and supporting metabolism.
* **Spirulina & Chlorella:** These are nutrient-dense blue-green algae. They are fantastic sources of protein, vitamins, and chlorophyll, which aids in detoxification and energy.
* **Acerola Cherry, Beetroot, and Citrus Bioflavonoids:** These provide a broad spectrum of vitamins (especially Vitamin C) and antioxidants to cover all bases.

# ✔️ Probiotic & Digestive Enzyme Blend (4.5 Billion CFU)

A healthy gut is a healthy you. This blend ensures the nutrients are absorbed properly.

* **Lactobacillus Acidophilus & Other Strains:** These are beneficial bacteria that repopulate your gut, improving digestion and nutrient absorption.
* **Amylase, Protease, Lipase:** These enzymes help break down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, respectively, reducing bloating and gas after meals.

# ✨ 4. Real Life, Real Results: Stories from the USA

Marketing is one thing, but what happens in real life? Here are a few relatable stories from Americans who have tried TonicGreens.

**The Story of Julli, a Teacher from a Small Town in Ohio:**  
""Before TonicGreens, my energy levels were in the gutter. As a middle school teacher, my days are long and emotionally draining. By 3 PM, I was completely spent, relying on coffee to get through grading papers. I also seemed to catch every cold that went through my classroom. A friend recommended TonicGreens. I was skeptical, but after about three weeks of adding it to my morning routine, I noticed a significant change. The 3 PM slump disappeared. I had steady, natural energy throughout the day. But the biggest win? I made it through the entire winter semester without getting sick—a first in over a decade! For me, TonicGreens has been a game-changer for maintaining the energy and health I need to be present for my students and my own family.""

**The Story of Mark, a Busy Software Developer from Austin, Texas:**  
""My diet was a disaster—fast food, energy drinks, you name it. I knew I needed to get healthier, but I didn't have the time or patience to prepare perfect meals. TonicGreens became my nutritional safety net. It’s not a magic pill, but it kickstarted my health journey. It helped curb my junk food cravings, and I feel like my digestion has improved dramatically. It’s the easiest healthy habit I’ve ever adopted.""

# ✨ 5. My 90-Day Personal Experience: The Good, The Bad, The Verdict

Here’s a transparent look at my journey with TonicGreens.

* **Weeks 1-2: The Adjustment Period.** The taste is… grassy. It’s not unpleasant, but it’s distinctly ""green."" I mixed it with cold water and a squeeze of lemon, which made it palatable. I didn't feel dramatic changes immediately, but I did notice slightly better digestion and less bloating.
* **Weeks 3-8: The Benefits Kick In.** This is when the magic started. My energy levels became noticeably more stable. I woke up feeling more refreshed and didn't experience the post-lunch crash. I also felt a greater sense of mental clarity.
* **Weeks 9-12: The New Normal.** TonicGreens became a seamless part of my routine. The consistent energy and feeling of overall vitality were the standout benefits. I can't definitively say I'm ""sicker less often"" because I wasn't sick to begin with, but I feel robust and well-supported.

**The Good:**

* **Sustained Energy:** The most significant benefit for me.
* **Convenience:** An easy way to get a dense nutrient profile.
* **Digestive Comfort:** No more bloating after meals.
* **Quality Assurance:** Made in a certified US facility.

**The Bad (Considerations):**

* **The Taste:** It’s an acquired taste. Mixing it in a smoothie with fruit is the best way to mask it.
* **The Price:** It’s an investment. However, when you break down the cost per serving and consider the breadth of ingredients, it can be more cost-effective than buying multiple separate supplements.
* **Not an Instant Fix:** This is a wellness supplement, not a medication. Results take time and consistency.

# ✨ 6. TonicGreens vs. The Competition: How Does It Stack Up?

How does TonicGreens compare to other popular green powders like Athletic Greens (AG1) or Amazing Grass?

* **TonicGreens vs. Athletic Greens (AG1):** AG1 is the market leader but comes at a significantly higher price point. While both offer comprehensive formulas, TonicGreens provides a comparable ingredient profile at a more accessible price. TonicGreens also has a longer money-back guarantee (60 days vs. AG1's 30 days).
* **TonicGreens vs. Amazing Grass:** Amazing Grass is often more affordable but typically contains fewer active ingredients and lacks the specific, research-backed immune blends and probiotics that TonicGreens includes. TonicGreens offers a more potent, targeted formula.

# ✨ 7. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**Q: How do I take TonicGreens?**  
A: Mix one scoop with 8-12 oz of cold water or your favorite beverage (smoothie, juice) once daily.

**Q: Are there any side effects?**  
A: TonicGreens is made from natural ingredients and is generally well-tolerated. Some people might experience mild digestive adjustments as their gut microbiome changes. It's always best to consult your doctor before starting any new supplement, especially if you have pre-existing conditions or are on medication.

**Q: When will I see results?**  
A: This varies by individual. Some notice improved digestion and energy within a few weeks. For more profound immune and antioxidant benefits, consistent use for 2-3 months is recommended.

**Q: Is it worth the cost?**  
A: If you are currently buying separate supplements for immunity, antioxidants, digestion, and energy, TonicGreens can actually save you money. View it as a consolidated investment in your daily health foundation.

# 🏁 Conclusion: The Final Verdict

After 90 days of rigorous use and research, my verdict on TonicGreens is largely positive. It is not a magical cure-all, but it is a **high-quality, well-formulated, and effective nutritional supplement** that delivers on its core promises for most users.

**Who is TonicGreens for?**

* Busy individuals who struggle to eat enough fruits and vegetables.
* Anyone looking for a natural energy boost without caffeine jitters.
* People who want to proactively support their immune system.
* Those seeking better digestive health.

**Who might want to skip it?**

* Individuals who are extremely sensitive to ""green"" tastes and aren't willing to mix it into a smoothie.
* Anyone on a very tight budget who already consumes a pristine, whole-foods-rich diet.

The combination of its robust scientific backing, quality manufacturing standards, and the sheer breadth of health-supporting ingredients makes TonicGreens a standout option in the crowded greens powder market. The relatable success stories from people like Julli underscore its potential to make a real difference in everyday lives.

Our first meeting was not all rainbows and sunshine. I literally spilled hot coffee on him because i was in hurry and got late for my class.

This guy didn't even look at his shirt. He dropped his books and just snapped. He started shouting. And I don't mean annoyed shouting, I mean full, red-faced, veins-popping shouting. he even yelled on me.was completely taken aback. I kept trying to apologize and offer to buy him a new shirt and a coffee, but he just kept escalating, calling me ""careless"" and ""selfish"" and saying I should ""learn how to walk."" It was a total public scene. I felt like I was going to cry.

after that incident like 2 weeks ago i met someone on grindr. He went to my college, which made it feel so safe. We talked about campus life, professors we had, and shared secrets. It was emotional, intense, and felt like I was actually starting to fall for him. We had this whole beautiful, complicated online relationship going. 2 weeks later we decided to meet. I havent seen his face because he said he will show me when we meet as he's really shy. he just showed me couple of shirtless pics and he was really hot indeed. he had abs and a a very masculine personality which is my type

yesterday we decided to meet at the park in my campus cuz it was really late at night then I saw someone walking in who looked incredibly familiar. He walked over to me , his face getting closer, and my blood ran cold.

It was him the same angry guy i spilled coffee on. I got really scared and tried ran away from him but he grabbed my hand and he said that ""i know you u have this bad guy image of me in your mind but trust me im not the person you met that day"" he apologised for what he did and he said really likes me and he decided to approach me when he saw me on grindr

Then he was like ever since he met me he cant stopp thinking about me and he had seen me a lot of times on campus and he found me really cute and tiny and im exactly his type. He said he never had feelings for a guy expect me. Those were his words.

I told him i cant do this because im kinda scared of him after what he did to me that he humiliated me infront of whole college. Then he promised he will make it up to me. He kept apologising for that coffee incident

Later he got really close to me and then he asked if he could kiss me idk why i said yes. (Maybe he is really hot and tall) He leaned down to kiss me and then i realized what i have done. I pushed him away. Then i ran away ,went straight to my dorm. 

Now he's messaging me saying sorry for what happened. He is apologising. Should i forgive him and give him a chance. Idk im confused",5,1759033643.0,askgaybros,2,0.78,False

Originally, I started seeing German roaches sporadically in my apartment. Certainly enough to cause alarm. About 6 or so months ago, I followed the pinned note on here and they were eradicated quite quickly with zero sightings…..until last week. 

I realize that without my neighbor’s unit also being treated, it’s next to impossible to be completely roach free. However I’ve been seeing them in weird spots and they have been 99% nymphs. The one and only adult was on my bedroom wall…blegh, which I smooshed. I quickly pulled out my alpine WSG and sprayed all over the place, with emphasis on my kitchen and bathroom. Since then, I’ve seen a nymph climbing up my kitchen backsplash the other day, and just now found 3 more nymphs- one in my living room on my coffee table, one in the hall between my living and bathroom crawling up the wall in a doorway crevice, and then the third on the floor right at the edge of where my bed frame meets the floor. Just did another round of WSG and hoping for the best. Will pull apart my fridge tomorrow since it’s late.

So if you still want me based on those pictures, just simply DM me.

Don't worry, I will NOT be asking you for nude photos or videos and please don't ask me for those as well. I personally think ""Spark"" is important in any relationships and it's better if we're both attracted to each other physically FIRST before anything else, then we can go from there. Also, do not worry, I will NOT ghost you or abandon you out of nowhere. A real man MUST ALWAYS be honest and upfront, so expect me to be honest with you rather than leaving you hanging and I expect you to do the same. This is to filter out scammers and frauds out there. I want you and me to be safe and I want us both to enjoy this experience. So safety first!

Maybe paint the intersections and commission some murals, too. Pour some love on our peaceful protesters with some good food and coffee. Spin up a little economic activity around the fabricated media circus. 

Would be great to show the news outlets and the rest of the world what kind of community we really are. AND overtly celebrate our cool thoughtfulness. Them trying to broadcast a riot scene and getting a farmers’ market instead will make for some brilliant press. Maybe a handmade bike parade, too. 

Please help make this real.

I’m looking to pass time at work tomorrow some how. With that being said, I’m leaving it up to you all.

Things I’m looking for- good banter, innocent flirting, commitment free conversation, strictly online, I don’t want to meet up for coffee next week. By good banter, you can hurt my feelings and I’ll spit it right back. I was raised by world class shit talkers.

Animals. I’m an animal lover through and through. NOT a vegan or a PETA supporter. I love a good steak and I enjoy things like fishing and hunting because I do believe in conservation efforts. Population control is extremely important for ecosystem balance. I do eat what I kill though. I don’t kill or injure for fun, that’s barbaric.

I’m a little y’all ternative   I dress like a down south country boy but dark, spooky, macabre and gloomy are my comforts in life. I listen to anything that can fall under the “Metal” umbrella a long with some indie, and pop punk.

Horror. I like almost every subgenre of horror. The more painful looking the kill, the more my skin crawls, and the more I enjoy the movie. So if you have any suggestions that’s not Bone Tomahawk, I Spit on your grave, or terrifier, I’d love to talk about.

Europeans, don’t be scared to comment. I’ve been to 3 countries in Europe and I loved every single one of them for different reasons. Germans and Austrians, you have great beer. Italians, your food is delicious and your history is fascinating.

I have an Nvidia GPU which I'm using for Nix, and Intel integrated graphics which I'm trying to passthrough to a Windows VM. I connected my motherboard HDMI to my monitor and it shows up as a 2nd monitor for Nix. I tried adding the Intel graphics as a PCIE device in the VM but it then nothing shows up from the HDMI port on my monitor.

Any ideas for what to do? Would could I blacklist the Intel graphics from Nix? Is the Intel graphics supposed to be called ""Display Controller"" and not ""VGA Compatible controller?

Mine is love marriage from different religions and me and my husband are good with understanding and respect our religion and follow both sides. My mom never loved me since my birth as I’m a girl and my dad opposed my interest in education of my favorite and forced me to study which is not my interest field. Since childhood I faced many problems and finally I married the love of my life which my parents opposed earlier but later they accepted but every action they show are against me and my husband.

They just scroll phone and from morning coffee to night dinner I should give them to the sofa. I’m a tired and exhausted mom who doesn’t have any rest.

I have done my research and capital wise it would be better to start small since equipments used for roasting, grinding etc are very expensive. The other big costs are related to importing of the raw coffee, cacao/cocoa or tea. General administrative costs such as rent, utilities, salaries etc are taken into account. 

Ideally on paper the business looks decent provided everything goes well but there is little information on how these kinds of business goes in UAE.
