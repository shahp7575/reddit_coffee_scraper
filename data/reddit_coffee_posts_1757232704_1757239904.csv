1naphrw,https://www.reddit.com/r/PERU/comments/1naphrw/what_could_a_bangladeshi_company_offer_in_perus/,What could a Bangladeshi company offer in Peru‚Äôs agriculture space?,"Been reading about Peru‚Äôs agriculture sector, crops like quinoa, coffee, and avocados are a big part of their economy, and there‚Äôs been growing interest in contract farming models and agri-tech to support small and medium farmers.



Bangladesh has some experience here too, from farmer cooperatives to contract farming in tea and vegetable sectors, plus the rise of agri-tech startups focusing on irrigation, soil testing, and market access.



It made me wonder, is there anything a Bangladeshi company could realistically offer in a market like Peru? Not just tech exports, but maybe collaboration, shared models, or low-cost tools adapted for smallholder farmers?



Would love to hear if anyone has insights on Peru‚Äôs agri ecosystem or similar cross-regional partnerships. Could there be an opportunity for knowledge-sharing or even business?",1,1757239806.0,PERU,0,1.0,False

My idea is simple: we meet at a public cafe, enjoy a cup of coffee (my treat, of course), and just talk about whatever comes naturally, life, hobbies, random thoughts, or anything at all.

This is meant to be a one-time, no-strings-attached meetup. No need to exchange personal contacts or social media .Just a friendly chat over coffee and then we will walk our separate ways.

I think it could be a refreshing way to meet someone new without any pressure. Female company is preferred, but overall I‚Äôm just hoping to connect with someone who enjoys casual conversation in a relaxed setting.

1napgnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1napgnz/aitah_for_not_telling_my_parents_everything/,AITAH for not telling my parents everything?,"Last year I moved from my hometown (where I loved with my parents & brother) to go to collage on a different city, my parents were in charge of paying for the place where I stayed (students residence)+ for the food I ate, they didn't pay for the actual collage since I got a scholarship due to my grades. 
While being away I have had my life and usually went out and hung out with friends without telling anybody since I lived alone. When i went on trips I told my parents but (and this is what might make me the ahole) maybe Iike a week prior I would tell them ye I'm going to x. 
This summer I came back home and I had planned a trip with some friends, I told my parents but aparentally did not (probably did but they just didn't listen).

Now, this year I have moved to an apartment my parents own so they ain't paying the residence, (have in mind last year the residence only covered place to stay not food so they gave me money to buy groceries)

Yesterday I went out with some friends (to drink coffee and catch up) and my dad seemed pissed of that I didn't tell him. Today i've woken up and they told me they're just gonna pay me groceries if I send them the ticket which is super fair (I have my own savings i use for hangouts) but they did not tell me this was gonna happen, they acted as if they did tell me. 

I know I did tell them about that trip but I haven't told them about a concert I have on a different city (which i'll be back home at 22:00) nor that a friend is going to visit me and stay in their apartment (but they did tell me that I could invite people).

I have tried telling them several times, I even have a note on my phone on how to do it but it's difficult knowing they might not listen and they'll act as if I never told them, as it happened with the trip. I don't go out much, but sometimes I do and not gonna lie idk if I'm supposed to tell my parents every single thing I do or plan on doing. When I lived with them i told them when i was going out because they were there but now i'm away and just calling them every time I plan on doing sth seems pointless to me but idk if I might be behaving like an asshole. 

There's probably shit i forgot to say but that's basically it, AITAH?

I investigated and found the brew unit stuck. Managed to get it out eventually but noticed the brew unit drive was in an intermediate position, it was stuck. 

I replaced the whole drive assembly with new, along with a new brew unit.

Now the machine seems to think it is operating normally however it does not push water through the brew unit, the whole portion of clean water comes out of the rubber boot and straight into the drip tray and no coffee is made - the coffee in the waste tub is just dry ground coffee that‚Äôs been through the brew unit but with no water added, hence its a dry powder and not a puck.

Hot water spout works as normal.
When I start a rinse cycle water comes from the coffee nozzles.

No error codes.



Any help is appreciated! Very close to chucking it out and buying a Sage but as I‚Äôve spend a few hundred on parts, I‚Äôd really like to fix it.

My eldest is coming to your city for uni and I have a plan to visit for a few days at the end of October with their younger sibling. 

I've never been to Sheffield before so it's a bit of an adventure; they were buzzing at how nice the city was when they came back from a visit so I'm excited to have an explore. Eldest obviously has no idea what their timetable will be like and even if they're not timetabled I wouldn't expect to see them before 12pm anyway üôÉ.

Please may I have your recommendations for things to do and see? Me and a ten year old, happy with walking around a lot, love a bit of history, museums, art, music. Bonus points if there's nice cup of coffee involved.

It's probably close to 7 years in use now. I have a problem, where after drinking a couple of cups I'm starting to feel rather bad in the stomach. I've thought it was just coffee in general, but I've just spent a summer  drinking instant coffee, where I could drink multiple cups and feel just fine, and now I'm and feeling sick again. I've tested it and can confirm it's the coffee from the machine.
I've recently run the descaling program, using the guide from phillips. And also cleaned the brew unit as well as I can, but it didn't help. 

Is it just the coffee that's just a lot stronger then instant, or might there be mold inside that isn't cleaned by descaling or washing the brew unit?

Hey there fellow traveller!

Let‚Äôs dive into some of the basics just to get them out of the way:

**About Me:**
- 28 years old from NSW, Australia.
- 174cm / 5'8 tall with an average build which is trying to find motivation to tone up a bit.
- Blue eyes and brown hair, currently in the process of growing it out and bit after waking up and having my 1/3 life crisis.
- I‚Äôm as pale as they come‚Äîso much so that I might blind you in sunlight or turn into a tomato if exposed for too long.
- I work in tech/finance, but don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm not a c.r.y p t.o bro.

**Personality:**
- I‚Äôm pretty shy and anxious around new people, but once I warm up, I‚Äôm talkative and engaging.
- Introvert at heart, but I do enjoy going out with friends.
- I‚Äôm not religious and while I respect all beliefs, it might be tricky to connect with someone who is deeply religious.

**Hobbies:**
- Gaming is a big part of my life‚Äîmostly chill games, whether solo or with friends on Discord.
- Occasionally embarrass myself with a round of golf.
- Metalcore fan here! If you‚Äôre into Polaris / Thornhill / Sleep Token / etc let‚Äôs chat!
- I‚Äôll stay up late ruining my joke of a sleep schedule to watch Piastri get closer and closer to the Aussie WDC dream.

I‚Äôve tried various dating apps without much luck and would prefer to connect with someone in Australia. I‚Äôm looking for someone to make daily activities, like grabbing coffee or running errands, more enjoyable. Even better if we can just hang out at home and enjoy each other‚Äôs company.

But at the same time going out and travelling with someone would be amazing. I've travelled with family in the past, but I just feel like travelling with a significant other would hit different you know.

1naowkc,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeTested/comments/1naowkc/find_out_if_the_best_espresso_machine_by_breville/,Find Out if the Best Espresso Machine by Breville Lives Up to Hype,"Breville Barista Touch BES880BSS has been my morning ritual companion for the past few weeks, and it feels like I‚Äôve got my personal little coffeehouse at home. With its brushed stainless-steel finish and modern design, it complements my kitchen aesthetics effortlessly. The compact dimensions (12.7""D x 15.5""W x 16""H) make it a sleek fit even on narrower counters, despite packing so many features. Every time I looked at it, the machine practically begged me to brew a fresh shot of espresso.  

**Ease of Use and Touchscreen Operation**  
The simplicity of its touchscreen interface hooked me right away. It felt like personalizing a caf√©-style menu on a smartphone. Setting preferences for coffee strength, milk texture, and temperature is intuitive, and I can save up to eight personal coffee recipes. I tried saving variations for me, my partner, and even a curious friend who popped over one weekend. No other espresso machine I‚Äôve ever tried made customizing and replicating drinks so effortless.  

[Check Breville BES880BSS price on Amazon.](https://heatad.com/t/b078wmlxxg/)  

**Dose Control and Consistency**  
What truly surprised me was the integrated conical burr grinder. It‚Äôs precise, consistent, and remarkably easy to manage. With just a touch, the grinder delivers the right amount of coffee on demand, ensuring maximum flavor. Those burr grinders I had tried in stand-alone versions now seem clunky in comparison. Each shot brewed tasted balanced, rich, and aromatic‚Äîa consistency I wasn‚Äôt always getting even from my favorite coffee shops.  

**Faster Heat Up and Optimal Pressure**  
The innovative ThermoJet heating system gets this beast ready to go in just three seconds, which is a game changer on rushed mornings. Pairing this with its pre-infusion and controlled pressure system gave me an even extraction every single time. I‚Äôm no barista, but the coffee this machine extracts suggests otherwise.  

**Automatic Milk Texturing ‚Äì Almost Perfect**  
While I‚Äôm a fan of espresso shots, a creamy latte or frothy cappuccino is my guilty pleasure. The automatic steam wand takes customization to another level with adjustable milk texture and temperature settings. I was even inspired to attempt some basic latte art‚Äîemphasis on attempt. That said, advanced milk texturing enthusiasts might find the wand‚Äôs automation limits them slightly compared to a fully manual option.  

**Advantages**  
- Modern, compact, and professional-grade design.  
- Quick start-up with just three seconds using ThermoJet technology.  
- User-friendly touch screen simplifies customization and operations.  
- Impressive integrated grinder for consistent on-demand dosing.  

**Negatives to Consider**  
- The steam wand may fall short for those who prefer manual frothing precision.  
- It‚Äôs a bit heavier (weighing 21.8 pounds) than many espresso machines I‚Äôve used, which makes repositioning it a task.  

**Product Rivals**  
Compared to machines like the De‚ÄôLonghi La Specialista Prestigio or the Rancilio Silvia Pro X, this product seems more user-centric. The Breville Barista Touch excels in automation and customization, which is perfect for beginners or casual coffee enthusiasts. However, pros or those seeking primarily manual elements might appreciate the more hands-on features of the Silvia Pro X. That said, De‚ÄôLonghi's machines have slightly better pricing in a similar range of capabilities but don‚Äôt quite match the ThermoJet system for heating speed.  

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
This machine isn‚Äôt the cheapest option out there, but considering the features like its built-in grinder, streamlined touchscreen interface, and overall performance, I believe the investment aligns well with the quality delivered. While alternatives might cost less initially, the value added by this level of technological integration and customization is hard to ignore, especially for daily coffee lovers like me.

Disasters [have a long tail](https://phys.org/news/2025-09-key-facts-term-impacts-extreme.html), according to academics. In the aftermath of strong tropical cyclones, two decades are needed before economic activity returns to pre-cyclone levels; **suicide rates remain elevated** years after a serious heat wave; personal finances are affected long after a flood or earthquake; and mortality rates after hurricanes and other storms stay high for years after the waters recede. Scientists looked at the strong El Ni√±o heat wave in 2023, and found that [the event produced an ‚Äú**unexpected decline in the ocean carbon sink**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-025-02380-4)....driven primarily by **elevated SSTs reducing the solubility of CO2**.‚Äù To be more specific, the ocean‚Äôs carbon sink potential decreased by about 10% during the heat wave. This is significant because **the ocean absorbs about 90% of atmospheric heat**, and we can expect our next El Ni√±o event to begin late next year, perhaps peaking in summer 2027.

**A23a**, the world‚Äôs largest iceberg, [has split](https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/03/climate/worlds-biggest-iceberg-a23a-broken-scli-intl). The largest chunk has been reduced to less than half its August 2025 size, and is now equivalent to roughly the size of Greater London, or the Greek island of Lesbos. Despite calving into several icebergs, A23a is still the largest floating iceberg on the planet. Meanwhile, a *PNAS* [study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2425248122) used lasers to calculate the sea level rise over the past 30 years: about **9 centimeters** (3.54 inches). Melting ice was the #1 factor in sea level rise, but scientists also pointed to thermal expansion as a contributing factor. 

**Upwelling** is the process wherein colder, more nutrient-dense seawater rises to the surface of ocean water, feeding fish and regulating ocean temperatures. A [study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2512056122) examined why upwelling‚Äîwhich has been fairly consistent in January-April in the Gulf of Panama for decades‚Äîfailed to occur in early 2025. ‚ÄúData suggest that the cause was a reduction in Panama wind-jet frequency, duration, and strength, possibly related to the [**Intertropical Convergence Zone**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertropical_Convergence_Zone) (ITCZ) position during the 2024‚Äì2025 La Ni√±a, though the mechanisms remain unclear.‚Äù The study authors warn that ‚Äúthe consequences are likely significant, including **decreases in fisheries productivity and exacerbated thermal stress** on corals.‚Äù

A [study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adt6231) in *Science Advances* examined the end of the last ice age (which ended some 11,700 years ago), during which CO2 ppm dropped to about 180 ppm at the Peak Ice Age in 19,000 BC, determined that the deglaciation may have resulted in large-scale permafrost melt. CO2 ppm rose to about 270 by 13,000 BC‚Äîand then, over the past 170 years, from about 280 to 425 ppm. [**Ongoing permafrost melt**](https://www.corporateknights.com/category-finance/canadas-chief-risk-assessor-is-underestimating-climate-impacts-say-advocates/) is one of many underestimated tipping points which experts say may cause [**runaway consequences**](https://www.space.com/science/climate-change/glacial-lake-flood-hits-juneau-alaska-reflecting-a-growing-global-risk-as-mountain-glaciers-melt).

A *Nature* [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09371-7) examining **sinkholes, ravines, and ‚Äúurban gullies‚Äù** in the DRC found an increase of about 100% over the course of 14 years, mostly due to erosion and ‚Äúhuman activities.‚Äù Overdeveloped surface areas force strong rains into unprotected surfaces, where it can rush in quickly and tear up the ground, taking down buildings into sudden valleys, and displacing/killing people. 

A [study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adv2906) in *Science* concluded that, over the next 25 years, ‚Äúcumulative impacts {to marine ecosystems from humans} are projected to increase 2.2 to 2.6 times globally, with coastal habitats facing higher impacts but offshore regions facing faster increases.‚Äù Impacts examined include **large-scale fishing, chemical runoff, impacts from shipping, temperature rise and increasing acidity, oil/gas/mineral extraction**, and new coastal infrastructure development.

A [new study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09423-y) reassesses earlier estimates on the amount of global warming that could be averted or undone by large-scale underground/underwater carbon storage, and concluded that the temperature offset is actually about 10% as much as previous estimates. This is because [the map](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09423-y/figures/1) of **safe areas to sequester loads of carbon** is actually much smaller than previously thought, when accounting for human settlements, the potential to accidentally contaminate freshwater sources, the risks of triggering an earthquake during sequestration, potential leakage during the process, and the impact on local biodiversity. According to the study authors, ‚ÄúThis study should be a game-changer for carbon storage. **It can no longer be considered an unlimited solution to bring our climate back to a safe level**.‚Äù

A different [study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adj6841) 
suggests that the potential for carbon sequestration in reforestation projects ‚Äúis much lower than previous estimates‚Ä¶..halting forest loss and protecting and managing existing forests are just as important as, if not more important than, creating new forests‚Ä¶.‚Äù [Another study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63383-5) published last week emphasizes that ‚Äú**there is no foreseeable slowdown in the momentum of global methane emissions growth**.‚Äù Instead, the average annual growth in CH4 emissions is about 1.2%, below the CO2 annual growth rate of 1.8%.

1naovhg,https://i.redd.it/4w21w520ppnf1.jpeg,The Rise of Matcha Caf√©s in Seattle: A Deep Dive into ‚ÄúCeremonial Grade‚Äù Claims and the Need for Transparency,"Seattle‚Äôs vibrant caf√© scene has recently witnessed a surge in establishments specializing in matcha beverages. From traditional tea to innovative blends, these caf√©s are attracting a diverse clientele eager to indulge in the rich flavors of matcha. However, amidst this growth, a pressing question arises: Are these caf√©s truly offering ‚Äúceremonial grade‚Äù matcha, and are they transparent about their sourcing practices?

The Matcha Boom in Seattle

The matcha trend in Seattle is undeniable. New caf√©s are emerging across neighborhoods like Capitol Hill, Belltown, and Fremont, each boasting unique matcha offerings. For instance, Taz Matcha & Bar in Belltown offers customizable matcha and hojicha drinks, while Atulea Matcha & Coffee in Capitol Hill and Phinney Ridge is known for its matcha with ube and strawberry puree . Similarly, Ph√™ on Capitol Hill blends Vietnamese coffee with matcha, creating a fusion of flavors that resonates with the local community  .

The ‚ÄúCeremonial Grade‚Äù Claim

Many of these establishments proudly label their matcha as ‚Äúceremonial grade.‚Äù Traditionally, ceremonial grade matcha refers to the highest quality matcha, typically sourced from Japan‚Äôs first harvest and used in Japanese tea ceremonies. This grade is characterized by its vibrant green color, fine texture, and delicate flavor profile.

However, the term ‚Äúceremonial grade‚Äù lacks a standardized definition in the U.S. market. Without regulatory oversight, caf√©s have the flexibility to use this term without substantiating their claims. This ambiguity can lead to confusion among consumers who may associate the label with authenticity and quality.

The Transparency Gap

While some caf√©s provide detailed information about their matcha sourcing, many do not. For example, URL Coffee in First Hill explicitly states on their Instagram that their matcha is sourced from Nishio, Aichi, Japan, and is from the first harvest . In contrast, Taz Matcha & Bar describes their matcha as ‚Äúpremium, stone-ground matcha sourced from Japan‚Äù but does not specify the region or harvest details on their website  .

This lack of transparency raises concerns. If a caf√© claims to use ‚Äúceremonial grade‚Äù matcha but cannot provide information about its origin, harvest, or processing, it becomes challenging for consumers to assess the authenticity of the claim.

How High-Grade Matcha Is Traditionally Enjoyed

In Japan, high-grade matcha is best appreciated in its simplest form: whisked with hot water and consumed as tea. This method allows drinkers to fully experience its nuanced umami, sweetness, and smooth texture. Blending ceremonial-grade matcha with milk, cream, or fruit can mask those subtle qualities, making it difficult to distinguish from lower grades. While matcha lattes and creative drinks are enjoyable, using ceremonial-grade matcha for such beverages can be seen as a waste of its unique character.

Conclusion

As the matcha trend continues to flourish in Seattle, it‚Äôs crucial for both consumers and caf√©s to prioritize transparency. For consumers, understanding the nuances of matcha grades and sourcing practices ensures a more authentic and satisfying experience. For caf√©s, providing clear and accurate information about their products fosters trust and loyalty among customers.

We‚Äôve been working with him for 2 years on his reactivity, he had an implant to see if that helped it did so we got him snipped and he calmed down with people. We‚Äôve worked with a wonderful trainer and there have been definite improvements. 

I have 2 dogs so usually I won‚Äôt take them places on my own BUT when my husband/a friend is there I can take him to our local town centre/coffee shops which was a distant dream before. 

BUT when I take him out on my own sometimes he‚Äôs a nightmare and even though I do everything we‚Äôve done in training that usually works sometimes he‚Äôs still a little sh*t. 

I know he hates being on a lead, and if it‚Äôs empty I‚Äôll let him off and as soon as I even sense another person/animal I put him back on. Once though he saw a little girl and got so excited (he was raised with kids before us) he bounded over, dodging me as I tried to grab him, stopped in front of her and started barking. I got him held him and apologised and the Dad got mad that he wasn‚Äôt on a lead. I apologised again and walked away but just felt like a failure and a bad owner.


I know I‚Äôm probably harder on him because he‚Äôs mine and I don‚Äôt want to be ‚Äòthat woman with the reactive dog‚Äô my friends and family say there‚Äôs such a huge difference in him and how much happier he is, which is true but there are still days when I come home from a walk and burst into tears. 

He is such a sweet and loving dog, within 10 minutes of someone being in the house (and a bit of barking) he‚Äôs bringing them toys and trying to snuggle.

Please tell me there‚Äôs others out there because I feel like a total failure.

What was left unsaid was exactly *why* this erstwhile legislator was the 1% of elected officials currently without a permanent, government-sanctioned, life companion ([at least since 2018](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain)) .

It was about a figure in Australian television history who is especially important to me, analysing his life and work from a queer perspective (he was a gay man, and so am I).

I spent nine months researching, writing, rewriting and learning video editing from the ground up.

But that's not the actually important part.

People have been commenting! There's been a few homophobes but mostly they've been really beautiful and really appreciative. So many people have shared that they felt the same way about this television figure and he helped them come to terms with their sexuality. 

I've been told I can peruse items related to him at our country's queer archives (I meet them tomorrow to discuss it). AND a television history archivist contacted me on Twitter and has since been sharing rare articles and interviews with this man that he's scanned from his collection.

1naone6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1naone6,Try to guess my type,"**Explanation:**

Dress style: Aesthetically, I like ceremonial military uniforms the most, but walking around in one of those would be a bit ridiculous, so I have to settle on a 3 piece suit, Akubra style hat, sunglasses and boots. I don't actually wear this everyday but it's my preferred aesthetic.

Purpose: To make my mark on history and be remember for it. That currently involves a revolution to serve my country and change the world for the better in the megalomaniac sense, and engineering great infrastructure and buildings in the normal sense.

Anime: I am not some massive anime fan, and don't look at it as any different than western media. Girls und Panzer was cool.

Study: While I love researching and learning about random topics on my own, I don't particularly enjoy school even though I'm good at it, so my favourite subject would be break time. The things I'm most interested in are history, philosophy and politics, but I actually only do STEM subjects school because I hate how the humanities are taught and they are useless for a career.

Sport: I enjoy outdoor, ""natural"" sports such as hiking, running, biking and occasionally swimming.

Book: Rumini is a Hungarian children's book I haven't read in a while, but I don't recall ever liking a book as much as I liked this series.

Zodiac: I don't believe that the position of the planets or whatever have any effect on you personality whatsoever, but I guess I'm Pisces, whatever that means.

Season: I actually love all seasons, with summer being my least favourite, and winter probably just edges out spring because of how beautiful and moody it is.

Food: Rakott krumpli, a traditional Hungarian food, is my favourite dish, but I will take anything Hungarian.

Game: Hearts of Iron IV is my favourite game and the one I have the most hours in by far.

Place: I love foggy mountain villages with old architecture in the middle of a lush forest, and I don't mind a bit of industrial grittiness to them either.

Hobby: I have way too many hobbies and don't even have time to do most of them, but the main one is thinking/philosophizing.

Song: I actually have trouble answering when someone asks what my ""favourite"" thing is in a category. I think it's very limiting to declare something your favourite and prevents further exploration, so in most of these I just put an example of something I like in that category.

Cartoon: Hungarian Folk Tales, a classic, way better than western slop.

Manwha: No idea what that is.

Drink: I drink water, like a normal human being. Maybe occasionally some tea, coffee or fruit juice.

Colour: Navy blue is beautiful, but I also like dark orangish yellow, deep green and blood red.

Animal: I always liked the Armadillo. Not sure why, it's such an interesting animal.

Eye colour: Not my picture, but it's extremely close. Grey/blue with a yellow streak in the middle.

Car: I much prefer socialist cars to western cars, they have exactly what's needed and nothing more, making them much cheaper and reliable than western cars. The GAZ Volga M21 is the best looking Soviet car.

Movie: Ludas Matyi, another Hungarian classic, I'm not really a movie guy.

Plant: My favourite flower is probably the red rose, because of it's colour, unique thorns, and symbolism.

Career: currently studying to be a civil engineer. Aiming to rise the rank and eventually be a high level government minister. Also interested in urban planning, military, justice and train driving.

Hair: very basic short side part with a soft fade. According to a girl I know, I have had the exact same haircut since she first met me, which was about 5 years ago.

My mom, to be completely honest, couldn‚Äôt keep her opinions to herself; like right now, as she went on and on about his drunken ways. Sometimes I wondered if she was a masochist. I was used to the argument dragging out for at least an hour before Jeff‚Äôs inner-loser took over and he got physical. Some might say she deserved it (my stepbrother said that once‚ÄîAlex blacked his eye too), but no woman deserves to be hit.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you back off,‚Äù Jeff said with a slur in his voice. ‚ÄúCrazy, nagging bi‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNag?‚Äù My mom sounded shocked. I could picture her mouth open in total disbelief, her hands propped upon her bony hips. The more vulgar name he had started to call her she was so used to hearing. But ‚Äònag‚Äô, no way she was going to let him get away with that.  
  
¬† The rest of what she was saying, I ignored. It was always the same kind of argument with usually the same kind of outcome: drawn-out fighting, which ended in lengthy make-up sex that always forced me out of the house faster than the actual fight.  
  
¬† I hoisted my favorite canvas backpack on after tucking my book away inside it and then raised my bedroom window and slipped out into the humidity. It felt nicer than inside where the heat of the day grew and lingered. We lived in a tiny white house on twelve acres of land just outside of Athens, Georgia. From the road, the house looked like a dirty speck in an endless yellowing pasture. Not a single tree hovered nearby to help shade it from the blistering southern summers. I hated that house. It was Jeff‚Äôs house.  
  
¬† Our neighbors were spaced out here and there. Jack and Janice Bentley lived across the street‚ÄîJanice had a cat-hoarding problem. Old Man Chester lived just around the curve past the proud and famous, Jacquelyn Morose, who had the pinkest house in Northeast Georgia. Though, the house didn‚Äôt make her famous; she was in a laundry detergent commercial like two hundred years ago and people still talk about it. Anyway, Old Man Chester was older than dirt too, and always wore the same coveralls. And then there was Mrs. Willis who lived next door. Unfortunately, she lived directly next door, as in about fifty feet away on the same acreage. We also shared the same mailbox post and driveway with her and our business was her business, too. One of those. There‚Äôs one in every neighborhood, isn‚Äôt there?  
  
¬† Like a vulture, Mrs. Willis watched me walk down the dirt-covered driveway and away from the rusted wire fence overrun by weeds. As if I couldn‚Äôt see her troll-like figure hovering at the kitchen window. Sometimes I felt like giving her the finger, but I was capable of restraint.  
  
¬† I did, however, super glue her mailbox shut when I was eleven. On the day she was supposed to get her Social Security check, at that. I could say that looking back on it now, I‚Äôm not proud of the childish deed. But then that would be a lie.  
  
¬† Neither my sister nor I were disrespectful girls. Despite Alex‚Äôs black eye record, she was the most caring and nonviolent person I knew. I learned a lot from her as we grew up (mom had too many unresolved issues to be much of a model herself). Alex taught me how to do a cartwheel, how to cook and even to drive a stick shift (the only thing that huge field around the house was good for). Admittedly, I wasn‚Äôt very good at any of them, but that‚Äôs beside the point.  
  
¬† An antique Ford drove past me, stirring up dust along the road. A gnarly hand poked out the window, waving at me as he went by. Old Man Chester. He waved at everybody; it was kind of customary in these parts. I waved back and kept on walking, slipping past a dozen eroded mailboxes and eventually over the creek bridge, which led to the park. The sun would be gone soon; the sky laced by thin, dark pink clouds just on the horizon. I could count four streaks of perfectly straight contrails left by planes, crisscrossing above me.  
  
¬† I sat in the park for an hour under an enormous tree; the one near the outskirts of the forest away from the playground and close to the public fishing pond. I loved it here. But I think a lot of people did. Hard to resist one of those mammoth trees with giant limbs that dip so low you can sleep on them. It was my thinking spot and where Alex could always find me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAdria,‚Äù she said walking toward me alongside the water, ‚ÄúJeff went out, so let‚Äôs go home.‚Äù  
  
¬† She wore her trademark hip-hugger jeans, tank top and worn out black flip-flops.  
  
¬† I closed my copy of Neverwhere and left my index finger in-between its crumpled pages. The lamppost wasn‚Äôt putting off enough light anymore to read and the erratic cloud of bugs swarming around it was beginning to thicken.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIs mom home?‚Äù I asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe was when I left to find you,‚Äù Alex said, sitting down next to me on the rain-deprived grass, ‚Äúbut was on her way out, too.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThought you were playing pool tonight?‚Äù  
  
¬† Alex shook her head. ‚ÄúI was, but I thought you could use some company.‚Äù  
  
¬† She always thought of me first, always put me before just about anything. She was no eighteen-year-old saint; left me on my birthday last week to hang out with Zach Anthony, but she was the best sister anyone could ever have.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSurprised you didn‚Äôt bring  
your friend along,‚Äù I said, smirking.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat friend?‚Äù She paused. ‚ÄúOh, you mean Brent‚Äîcome on, Dria, he‚Äôs perfect for you. His dad owns a Honda dealership and his mom‚Äôs a doctor.‚Äù  
  
¬† I really had been referring to Zach Anthony‚ÄîI admit; I was still a little bitter.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care about that stuff.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI know, I know,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúbut he‚Äôs adorable‚ÄîI swear he looks like Ian Somerhalder.‚Äù  
  
¬† I looked over at her with a roll of my eyes. ‚ÄúOh please,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWhy are you really trying to fix me up with this guy? Be honest.‚Äù  
  
¬† Alex grew quiet and frustrated all of a sudden. ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt want you to make bad decisions,‚Äù she said simply.  
  
¬† Yeah, Alex always had that motherly way about her and sometimes she sounded like our actual mother should have. We grew up quicker than anyone we hung out with; honestly, sometimes we were more adult than some adults we knew. Mostly mom‚Äôs friends. No surprise there, really.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou mean like the bad decisions mom makes?‚Äù I said. I had a feeling it was about something like this. She had always been more negatively affected by mom‚Äôs screw-ups than I was.  
  
¬† I regarded my sister. ‚ÄúI have to live and make my own choices, my own mistakes. You have to let me be me, even if I suck at it sometimes.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI know, you‚Äôre right,‚Äù she said, gazing out at the park.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI love you for being you, though.‚Äù I smiled and she did too, just before she frogged me on the leg with her knuckle.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOuch!‚Äù I rubbed the spot hard with my palm.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo cheesy love talk,‚Äù she laughed. ‚ÄúYou know I hate it!‚Äù  
  
¬† She eased into a more serious mood then, impeccably.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI need to tell you something,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been holding it in for weeks.‚Äù  
  
¬† Immediately, I had a bad feeling. I set the book on the grass next to me and turned to face her. I couldn‚Äôt actually say, ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù as the words were stuck in my throat.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm going to move out soon...‚Äù  
  
¬† I felt my heart sink. She just kept talking, but I could barely hear any word she said. Absently, I saw the way her dark hair flowed down around her oval-shaped face and how she kept the corners of her eyes soft as she tried to explain her reasoning.  
  
¬† ‚Äú...Liz and Brandon said I could stay with them if I want. I‚Äôll have to get a job and help keep the place clean, but I‚Äôm all for it...‚Äù  
  
¬† I didn‚Äôt want to hear this.  
  
¬† ‚Äú...I‚Äôll have my own space since they have the extra room above the garage. And you can come visit anytime you want. Once I get settled in you can come live with me too.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I said, staring at her in mute.  
  
¬† Alex breathed deeply and let her head fall sympathetically to one side. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt stay with mom forever; you know that.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre just going to leave?‚Äù I stopped her before she answered. ‚ÄúMom needs us here.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAdria,‚Äù she said, gazing at me with that just-listen-to-me-for-once look, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know about you, but I‚Äôm tired of being our mother‚Äôs mother. She won‚Äôt leave him. Isn‚Äôt that obvious already?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter, Alex! That‚Äôs not the point....‚Äù  
  
¬† Silence filled the night air in an instant. Alex leaned against the base of the massive tree next to me. I could feel her hand on my leg, patting it in surrender.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt know how much more of this I can take. And it‚Äôs not just Jeff; it‚Äôs everything. There‚Äôs nothing for me in Athens.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, Lexington really isn‚Äôt that much different,‚Äù I said begrudgingly. ‚ÄúI mean, I doubt you‚Äôre going to ‚Äòfind yourself‚Äô in a place less than twenty miles away.‚Äù  
  
¬† I didn‚Äôt mean for it to sound so sarcastic‚Ä¶.but then again maybe I did.  
  
¬† A drunken bug fluttered down and batted its wings against the side of my face. I slapped furiously at the air until I knew I had scared it away.  
  
¬† Alex stared more at the ground than me. She began twirling blades of grass around her fingers; her chin rested upon the knuckles of her other hand. I thought about how much she had done for me and I couldn‚Äôt bear the thought of being on my own and without her. And I knew it was because of me that she hadn‚Äôt moved out a month ago. She was eighteen now, after all.  
  
¬† Maybe I was being selfish.  
  
¬† I glanced over at her; the darkness shadowed her face.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAlex,‚Äù I began, ‚Äúif you want to move in with Liz, I‚Äôm really okay with it. And I‚Äôm not trying to guilt-trip you, either.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she said softly, her gaze still lingering, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt go anywhere if you won‚Äôt go with me. Probably a bad idea anyway.‚Äù She added, finally looking up, ‚ÄúI think Brandon likes me, so that‚Äôs a disaster waiting to happen.‚Äù  
  
¬† My chin drew back in surprise. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lying!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI wish I was,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI mean, I could just be delusional, but he‚Äôs way too nice to me.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúListen to your gut,‚Äù I warned.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLiz is so gullible,‚Äù said Alex, her face downcast, ‚Äúand it makes me feel like crap.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not your fault.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI know, but that doesn‚Äôt make it any easier.‚Äù  
  
¬† My suspicions went into blame-mode suddenly. ‚Äú...Ummm, why did you even consider moving in with them if you thought he liked you?‚Äù I never knew my sister to be a home-wrecker, but I couldn‚Äôt help but ask and get it out of the way.  
  
¬† She swung her head around to see me beside her. ‚ÄúNo, Dria,‚Äù she snapped. ‚ÄúI just saw it as a way out of Jeff‚Äôs. Nothing like that.‚Äù I think she mumbled something like: ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt believe you said that,‚Äù but I couldn‚Äôt be sure. I felt guilty for thinking that way at all.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI want out of Jeff‚Äôs as much as you do, but....‚Äù I had no idea where I was going with it.  
  
¬† If what I said was true, about wanting out, then why was I not sharing her ideas? Yes, I did want out, but I wanted our mom with us. Maybe I was being delusional. Somehow, part of me knew that Alex was right about mom. She would never leave Jeff. God, how could any woman be so blind and stay with a man like him? I knew I would never be like her in that sense.  
  
¬† So, I guess I did learn something from my mother after all.  
  
¬† We sat quietly for several moments longer, Alex still twirling the delicate grass and me absently watching her. I loved the summer night air, the sound of summer insects and the smell of summer wind. Nothing could beat it. My most memorable moments were of summertime with my sister and even though this particular moment wasn‚Äôt exactly a joyful one, somehow I knew just sitting like this with Alex underneath the giant oak, would etch itself deeply into my memory. I would never forget the pond and the trees and the smell of honeysuckle and pine. And I would always remember that stupid left flip-flop that Alex had worn down so much that she often stubbed her big toe when she walked. I tried to get her to toss them, but she refused. They were her favorite.  
  
¬† I glanced over at her, down at her feet and just shook my head smiling.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù she said as she noticed.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou better tell me, Dria, I‚Äôm not playin‚Äô.‚Äù  
  
¬† I just laughed and she punched me on the shoulder.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDamn it, Alex!‚Äù I laughed harder.  
  
¬† A moving shadow pulled me out of my thoughts then. Alex stood up, letting the torn grass blades fall softly from her fingertips.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs that?‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† She looked down at me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Brent‚ÄîI swear I didn‚Äôt plan this,‚Äù she whispered harshly.  
  
¬† I knew she was telling the truth. When her eyes bugged out like that, she was always telling the truth.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHey Brent,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up? What are you doing here?‚Äù I could tell that Alex was mortified about this extremely coincidental turn of events, and worried that I didn‚Äôt believe her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHeard you mention at Solids & Stripes you were coming here and I just live two streets over,‚Äù he said, pointing. ‚ÄúWant me to leave?‚Äù I admit he was attractive. He wore a tight-fitting navy tee that co  
nformed perfectly to every chest and arm muscle. Dark hair. Hard cheekbones.  
  
¬† He smiled at Alex and his bright eyes seemed to glisten.  
  
¬† Uh oh, I thought. I gave it a minute more before confirming my suspicions about him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Alex, ‚ÄúI just didn‚Äôt expect to see you.‚Äù She turned to look at me then. ‚ÄúThis is my sister, Adria.‚Äù  
  
¬† Brent politely acknowledged me and turned his attention back on her. ‚ÄúHeadin‚Äô home, or are you up to swimming in the Fork? Adria can come too, if she wants.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI, uh...‚Äù she paused, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure about tonight.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo prob,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMaybe tomorrow after practice then?‚Äù  
  
¬† Yep, uh oh was right on. Alex‚Äôs plan had backfired and I think she knew it too; her posture tightened awkwardly as if something just bit her. Brent was interested in her, not me. At first, it was a relief. I looked forward to messing with Alex about it later, until I realized how insulted I felt. Alex and I looked a lot alike, being sisters and all, but guys were always more into her than me. What is it? I said to myself. Did I get more of the plain or ugly genes than she did? Is it that Alex is more outgoing, more likable? Is it because she‚Äôs the older sister? Wait a second, why do I even care? I‚Äôm not the slightest bit attracted to this guy, even though he does look like Ian Somerhalder....  
  
¬† Alex interrupted my thoughts suddenly.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right, you play football,‚Äù she said to Brent. ‚ÄúAdria loves football.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo I don‚Äôt!‚Äù I didn‚Äôt mean to shout, but I hated football. I hated sports in general, at least the competitive version of them. Alex was so desperate to turn the tables back on me that she had resorted to blatant lies.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI mean, I‚Äôm not into sports,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cool,‚Äù said Brent. ‚ÄúMost girls I know aren‚Äôt into sports, unless you‚Äôre one of my sisters.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs nice,‚Äù I said, trying to hide the smirk, but I know Alex saw it, at least.  
  
¬† I don‚Äôt think Brent meant to offend me. He just gave me a weird feeling, putting me in the ‚Äòmost girls‚Äô category. I liked to think I was my own person. And like competitiveness, I hated categories.  
¬†I stood and slung my backpack over my shoulder. ‚ÄúOne sec,‚Äù I said, putting up my finger. I reached into the bag and pulled out a cell phone. It was a Pay-As-You-Go; I had been out of minutes for two weeks and the battery was dead, but I still carried it around. I pretended to be checking a text message. ‚ÄúMom needs us to pick up some Advil on our way home.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh...,‚Äù Alex caught on quickly, ‚Äúok, well we better go. I guess I‚Äôll see you later then?‚Äù  
  
¬† Brent smiled and walked away with his hands in his pockets.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood save,‚Äù she said to me.  
  
¬† We waited until he was out of earshot before leaving my special tree and heading in the opposite direction. She walked with a slight limp on that left foot, but I didn‚Äôt say anything.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou did it again,‚Äù Alex said accusingly.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDid what?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAlways looking for a reason‚Äîyou know what I mean.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo I don‚Äôt.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes you do,‚Äù Alex argued. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll look for a reason to not like a guy until you find one. He can be perfect, but you‚Äôll find one.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not into girls are you?‚Äù she added warily.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù I laughed. ‚ÄúAnd no one‚Äôs perfect; besides he‚Äôs a jock, Alex. You know I‚Äôm least attracted to jocks.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd preps,‚Äù she said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd conceited jerks,‚Äù I added.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI know,‚Äù Alex laughed, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt like anyone!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not true,‚Äù I said as we slipped into the forest down the asphalt bicycle path. ‚ÄúI like Taylor Kitsch and that guy in Supernatural.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt think of his name. ‚ÄúJared Padalecki!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou only like him as Sam Winchester, so it doesn‚Äôt count.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah, so.‚Äù  
  
¬† Alex shook her head. ‚ÄúAdria, you‚Äôre hopeless!‚Äù  
  
¬† Massive trees towered over us, blocking most of the moonlight from the clear dark sky. The bicycle path through the park was a short cut to our house, only by a few minutes. We always took this route after 8:00p.m. because the other way was right past Jeff‚Äôs mother‚Äôs house. She was more of a troll than our nosey neighbor, Mrs. Willis, was.  
  
¬† During the day the park was full of joggers and bicyclists. At night it was desolate and eerie. Even with the sound of the freeway in the distance, I still felt like I was far away from home, lost in the wilderness somewhere; after all, we weren't so far from the mountains. But tonight was different. I wasn‚Äôt alone.  
  
¬† And you always let down your guard when you‚Äôve got company.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBrent must‚Äôve overheard me talking to Liz,‚Äù said Alex. ‚ÄúYou believe me, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah, I believe you,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúbut you have to admit, it was a little weird.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt believe me!‚Äù  
  
¬† I laughed. ‚ÄúNo, really I do. It‚Äôs hilarious though.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs so funny about it?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat he likes you.‚Äù  
  
¬† Alex shook her head. ‚ÄúI never saw that coming.‚Äù She almost tripped over a branch lying across the darkly obscured path. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm definitely not into him.‚Äù  
  
¬† My mouth fell open and I stopped abruptly. ‚ÄúThen what makes you think I‚Äôd be? Seriously!‚Äù  
  
¬† She shrugged. ‚ÄúI dunno,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a jock, but not like Jasen Mills and his group of jock dickheads. Brent keeps to himself.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo why would that make me like him exactly?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUmmm, because that‚Äôs how you are?‚Äù she said, as if I should already know the answer to my own question.  
  
¬† Alex did have a point; I wasn‚Äôt one for hanging out with hugely noticeable crowds. But that still wasn‚Äôt a basis for trying to hook me up.  
  
¬† The truth was that none of this mattered anyway. I was annoyed by her trying to hook me up at all.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt do it anymore,‚Äù she said, as though reading my mind. ‚ÄúI promise.‚Äù  
  
¬† I frogged her as hard as I could on the arm.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCrap, Dria! That hurt!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPaybacks.‚Äù I grinned.  
  
¬† For a moment, when Alex didn‚Äôt smile back at me I thought she was mad.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúDid you hear that?‚Äù She stood there gripping her arm, but it was obvious something else was on her mind other than the inevitable bruise. She stared through the trees behind me.  
  
¬† So much for letting down my guard with company. The hair stood up on the back of my neck.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, I didn‚Äôt hear‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† Then suddenly I did hear something. It sounded like growling...sort of. I couldn‚Äôt tell. But what scared me was the strangeness of it, the foreign degree of danger in the ripple it left in the air. When you hear a dog growling you usually know right away that it‚Äôs a dog.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSounded like a bear,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† We began walking faster. I could see one lone streetlight glowing far off in the distance.  
  
¬† Alex stopped and grabbed my arm, smiling. ‚ÄúThis reminds me of the time we saw Texas Chainsaw Massacre over at Liz‚Äôs; remember?‚Äù  
  
¬† I guess her sudden relaxed attitude helped calm my nerves because I wasn‚Äôt as edgy anymore. ‚ÄúYeah, I remember.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLike freaked out little girls,‚Äù Alex added.  
  
¬† We cupped our hands over our mouths to muffle the laughter, but then the wild flapping of wings sucked the calm right out of us again. Birds, hundreds of them it seemed like, burst out of the trees.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAlex,‚Äù I whispered harshly, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go.‚Äù I took her by the arm.  
  
¬† As we hurried down the path, squirrels bounced from tree to tree, all moving in the same direction. There were so many of them I couldn‚Äôt help but notice.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù Alex said.  
  
¬† The growl now sounded more like a roar. It filled the space all around us, making me doubt which way if any, that we could run away from it. Whatever it was. Instinctively, Alex and I stood back to back, moving distractedly in a circle to keep each other safe.  
  
¬† A figure crashed through the bushes then.  
  
¬† My lungs hardened like cement as a naked man stumbled out and fell onto the path ahead. Alex shrieked and gripped my forearm so tight that it hurt. I was too...everything, to scream. I think I forgot how.  
  
¬† The man reached out a hand toward us. I could hear the disturbing sound of his flesh scraping against the asphalt as he dragged his body forward with his arms. Alex and I started backing away, both of us trying to gauge the situation before making any stupid sudden movements. We should have just run for it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOmigod,‚Äù Alex gasped. ‚ÄúOmigod!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPlease...‚Äù the man said in a raspy, growling voice, ‚Äú...run away from here! Go! Now!‚Äù  
  
¬† I had to shake my thoughts sensible, literally. The sound of his voice held an echoing, demonic undertone and it stunned me. Alex grabbed my arm tighter and jerked me toward her. Her fingernails seared my skin. A perplexing force, like hot wind, blindsided me and I felt my face crush into the side of a tree. Furious white spots dotted my vision, shattering my focus. Blood came up in my mouth. I couldn‚Äôt tell if I was still standing, or if that tree pressed against my face was really the ground. There was some kind of struggle, but the demonic undertone stood out over everything.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAlex? Alex!‚Äù I had to know where she was, if she was all right.  
  
¬† I looked up and realized then that I was on the ground. My vision was blurred. A canopy of limbs and leaves and stars spun around in my gaze, making me feel drunk. I wondered if I was losing my mind...I couldn‚Äôt really be seeing what I thought I was seeing. An enormous beast, bluish-black in the moonlit darkness, stood on two legs several feet away. Its head was like a wolf...no, it wasn‚Äôt like any wolf I had ever seen. It was a monster. Towering at least seven feet, its almost human-like legs and arms were covered in mangy, black fur. Its fingers were long with thick razor-sharp nails on the ends.  
  
¬† The beast lunged at the naked man, burying its massive teeth in his shoulder. An agonizing scream pierced the air and then became a menacing, guttural growl.  
  
¬† I backed my way to wherever I could, gripping the ground with my hands, feeling the tips of my fingers pi  
ck up grains of rock and shove them underneath the bed of my nails. My body jerked forward and I fell face down on the asphalt. Blood pooled behind my lips; the warm, disgusting thickness coating my teeth and slipping down into the back of my throat. Something was pulling me backward, fingers digging into my ankle so aggressively. I struggled to kick my way free, but it dragged me slowly off the pathway and onto the dirt. Tiny pieces of rock and grit stung my elbows and ribs.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShhh!‚Äù demanded Alex. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me!‚Äù  
  
¬† Relief washed over me, but we were far from being safe. We crawled further away and crouched low behind a tree, paralyzed and out of breath. Blood smeared in Alex‚Äôs hairline, I noticed momentarily.  
  
¬† I watched wide-eyed, my heart banging violently against my chest. My legs quivered uncontrollably; I thought I would faint at any moment.  
  
¬† The naked man stood from the ground, pushing the beast off him and sent it crashing through the forest; tree limbs whipped violently around its body. And then the man began to change. His skin began to ripple grotesquely as though something seethed beneath it. He craned his head and pulled back his arms, his fists balled tightly behind him, his stance battle-ready and terrifying. His face began to protrude; a snout with terrifying fangs jutted out; the cracking and crushing of bone sent what was left of my nerves completely over the edge. His human skin changed color and long, black hair grew within seconds covering most of his massive body.  
  
¬† I think I did finally faint at that moment.  
  
¬† I couldn‚Äôt recall what happened immediately afterwards. I couldn‚Äôt guess how I did finally get to my feet and begin running through the woods. I couldn‚Äôt say how Alex and I made it to the freeway, or how the cars swerved to miss us, or even if maybe we had been hit because when I did ultimately ‚Äòwake up‚Äô, I was in a litter-filled ditch with Alex on top of me. A crumpled soda can and an empty plastic water bottle jabbed me in the small of my back. Cars buzzed by on the freeway above, the booming echo of wheels going over a nearby exit bridge. Clu-clump! Clu-clump! Clu-clump! I welcomed the repetitive nuisance. It was strangely comforting, as if it helped me believe that the nightmare in which made the frightening sounds before it was somehow not real.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAlex?‚Äù I said, squeezing myself out from under her carefully. ‚ÄúAre you alright? Alex!‚Äù  
  
¬† She didn‚Äôt respond and I panicked, putting her bloodied face in my hands, feeling for her pulse and listening for the sound of her breath. More blood. The collar of her shirt had soaked it up like a sponge, the ends of her hair clumped together in a sticky mess. Finally, I saw her breathe as bubbles of red formed in her nostrils‚Äîher nose had been busted‚Äîand I noticed a gash on the side of her head as she began to stir, groaning.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAlex!‚Äù I hugged her close to me.  
  
¬† She opened her eyes in a jolt. ‚ÄúWhere is it?‚Äù she screamed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to kill us!‚Äù She had never looked so distraught. The whites of her eyes seemed whiter; the skin stretched over her forehead tight like plastic. She dug her nails deeply into my shoulders and would‚Äôve broken the skin had they not been protected by the fabric of my shirt.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, no, calm down!‚Äù I tried to get her to relax and finally held her still.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gone, Alex.‚Äù I hugged her tighter. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay; we‚Äôre going to be okay.‚Äù  
  
¬† A part of me felt like I was lying to her‚Ä¶.  
  
¬† Getting home that night proved mentally and physically exhausting. Alex and I hardly spoke; too traumatized to talk about what happened.  
  
¬† I cleaned up; taking the longest shower I think I‚Äôd ever taken in my life, watching fragments of dirt and rock and blood disappear hauntingly down into the drain. Lifting my gaze to the mirror, at first I was relieved that a thick layer of moisture prevented my reflection. Tiny bubbles of liquid gray covered the glass in a sheet of delicate humidity, threatening to evaporate at any moment and reveal the devastating truth. The truth I had already begun trying to twist into something it wasn‚Äôt. My hands were propped solidly against the edge of the counter. My whole body throbbed, stung, ached. I had to see. And so I swallowed hard and wiped away the veil with the palm of my hand. A girl with a busted lip and a heavily bruised face stared back at me. I didn‚Äôt look like I‚Äôd been punched in the eye; I looked like...well, like my face had been bashed against a tree.  
  
¬† I was so tired, but too afraid to sleep. I laid in bed for hours, taking greater notice to every little sound around me, every movement. Mrs. Willis‚Äô headlights shining directly on my Supernatural poster above my desk as she pulled back into the drive. The every-other-night Bentley Family cat fights underneath our house. The summer song of crickets and frogs. The remote control hitting the floor in the living room after Jeff had passed out on the couch.  
  
¬† I knew all of these sights and sounds intimately, yet they still managed to put me on edge as though completely new. But this was nothing like the night we saw the horror movie; this time the horror was real.  
  
¬† I know what I saw.  
  
¬† I know what attacked us, but to say it aloud was like verifying it, sealing the deal, confirming that I believed in something so insane. I wasn‚Äôt ready yet to admit it to myself. There had to be an explanation. There‚Äôs always an explanation, right? I just didn‚Äôt know which I wanted more: to find it, or forget about it all completely.  
  
¬† Two days came and went and we didn‚Äôt go to school. Alex never went further than the restroom or her bedroom. She still wasn‚Äôt speaking, at least not about what happened. She hardly said two random sentences to me, like how the heat was too much for her (our air conditioner was broken) and something about a fly in her room that was driving her ‚Äòbat shit'. But as far as I know, she never made any effort to plug the fan back behind her dresser, or get the fly swatter and smack the insect into oblivion.  
  
¬† On Wednesday, there was an unfamiliar knock at the door, which made me alert in my room just down the hall. I knew it was someone I‚Äôd never met before, someone important, or maybe a delivery driver.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre both in their rooms,‚Äù my mother said. ‚ÄúThey haven‚Äôt been feeling well.‚Äù  
  
¬† My mom was never the type to invade our privacy. We could get away with playing the sick card.  
  
¬† I couldn‚Äôt let her see my face.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes ma‚Äôam, I called the school yesterday and told them my daughters were sick.‚Äù I could easily detect the offense in her voice, the same way she sounded when our neighbor, Mrs. Willis, would show up at our door after a Jeff and Rhonda Bradley fight.  
  
¬† I heard a woman‚Äôs voice say, ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt mind, we‚Äôd like to speak with your daughters. It will only take a minute and if everything is fine we‚Äôll be on our way.‚Äù  
  
¬† I knew exactly where this was heading....  
  
¬† Child Protective Services took me away that day. I protested futilely‚Äîshockingly, Alex said and did nothing. I even made up an elaborate story about how Alex and I were attacked by a group of girls in the park. Useless. They didn‚Äôt believe that our bruises were not the work of Jeff Bradley.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWould you like to file a police report?‚Äù the social worker said to Alex as she sat impassively with her back pressed against the wall of the Child Protective Services building.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Alex said simply.  
  
¬† I couldn‚Äôt put my finger on it, but something in her eyes haunted me. Her face held no emotion. A single strand of hair lay stretched across her nose in a way that even made me want to move it out of the way and scratch the area it had been. She did nothing.  
  
¬† She was eighteen and free to go if she wanted, but not me. I was officially a ward of the State of Georgia.  
  
¬† I overheard them talking in the sterile-white hall of the building, something about a witness and a written statement. I knew then that Mrs. Willis probably had everything to do with it. She was who called the police many times before. I was sure she told the police that Jeff beat us.  
  
¬† I spent six days in the care of the State and on the seventh day, I was sent to live with my Uncle Carl and his new wife, Beverlee, in Hallowell, Maine.  
  
¬† Thankfully, Alex left with me. I guess she got her wish to be out of Jeff‚Äôs house after  
all.  
  
¬† I HATED EVERYTHING ABOUT moving a thousand miles away from home in Georgia, except for the weather. Of course I loved my southern summers, but September in Maine was like heaven. The rest of it, I quietly kept to myself, I wanted no part of. I loved my Uncle Carl, but really, the last time I saw my dad‚Äôs brother was when I was twelve. It wasn‚Äôt as if he sent Christmas cards every year. Now, with the new wife and all, I wasn‚Äôt sure how well this would go over.  
  
¬† I have to admit, Uncle Carl‚Äôs place was nice. He lived in an isolated two-story Victorian-style house mostly surrounded by woods. It wasn‚Äôt a rich place by any means; the outside could‚Äôve used a new coat of paint and by the looks of the yard, Beverlee wasn‚Äôt much the gardening type. The plants hanging in pots on the porch were mostly dead and what might have been a little garden on the east side next to the shed, was nothing more than a square patch of dirt overrun by weeds.  
  
¬† Most of the time, I spent outside on the enormous dusty porch in a particular wooden chair furthest from the front door. But when Beverlee started thinking of excuses to join me, I found the solitude of my upstairs bedroom more comfortable. I was careful not to say or do anything to hurt her feelings‚Äîit turned out that she was actually nice and seemed genuinely concerned, but I still wasn‚Äôt ready for all the bonding stuff.  
  
¬† Alex and I both had our own rooms, and just like at home ever since ‚Äòthe incident‚Äô she said little and did less. In her room, on the other side of the locked door was where she stayed. And unlike me, Alex was not so careful with Beverlee‚Äôs feelings. The onetime Beverlee knocked on Alex‚Äôs door to offer breakfast, Alex responded: ‚ÄúIf I was hungry, I‚Äôd go downstairs and make something.‚Äù  
  
¬† I didn‚Äôt know whether to be mad at her for being so hateful, or to worry if she‚Äôd ever pull out of it. I think it was a little bit of both.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe needs more time,‚Äù Beverlee said sitting on the chair on the porch next to me later that afternoon. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôll come around. What you two have gone through is a lot to deal with.‚Äù

You receive a PDF from a client, and it looks harmless. Until you try to copy the data. Suddenly, the text is broken into random lines, the tables look like modern art, and you‚Äôre thinking:¬†*‚ÄúThis can‚Äôt be happening in 2025.‚Äù*

Clients don‚Äôt want excuses. They want clean Excel sheets or structured databases. And you? You‚Äôre left staring at a PDF that seems harder to crack than the Da Vinci Code.

Luckily, the Python community has created¬†**free Python PDF libraries**¬†that can do everything: extract text, capture tables, process images, and even apply OCR for scanned files.

A client once sent me a 200-page scanned contract. They expected all the financial tables in Excel by the next morning. Manual work? Impossible. So I pulled out my toolbox of Python PDF libraries‚Ä¶ and by sunrise, the Excel sheet was sitting in their inbox. (Coffee was my only witness.)

# 1. pypdf

See¬†[repository¬†](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf)on GitHub

**What it‚Äôs good for:**¬†splitting, merging, rotating pages, extracting text and metadata.

* Tip: Great for automation workflows where you don‚Äôt need perfect formatting, just raw text or document restructuring.

**Client story:**¬†A law firm I worked with had to merge thousands of PDF contracts into one document before archiving them. With¬†`pypdf`, the process went from hours to minutes

    from pypdf import PdfReader, PdfWriter
    
    reader = PdfReader(""contract.pdf"")
    writer = PdfWriter()
    for page in reader.pages:
        writer.add_page(page)
    
    with open(""merged.pdf"", ""wb"") as f:
        writer.write(f)

# 2. pdfplumber

See¬†[repository¬†](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber)on GitHub

**Why people love it:**¬†It extracts text¬†**with structure**¬†‚Äî paragraphs, bounding boxes, tables.

* Pro tip: Use¬†`extract_table()`¬†when you want quick CSV-like results.
* Use case: A marketing team used pdfplumber to extract pricing tables from competitor brochures ‚Äî something copy-paste would never get right.

&#8203;

    import pdfplumber
    with pdfplumber.open(""brochure.pdf"") as pdf:
        first_page = pdf.pages[0]
        print(first_page.extract_table())

# 3. PDFMiner.six

[See repository on GitHub](https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six)

**What makes it unique:**¬†Access to low-level layout details ‚Äî fonts, positions, character mapping.

* **Example scenario:**¬†An academic researcher needed to preserve footnote references and exact formatting when analyzing historical documents.¬†`PDFMiner.six`¬†was the only library that kept the structure intact.

&#8203;

    from pdfminer.high_level import extract_text
    print(extract_text(""research_paper.pdf""))

# 4. PyMuPDF (fitz)

[See repository on GitHub](https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF)

**Why it stands out:**¬†Lightning-fast and versatile. It handles text, images, annotations, and gives you precise coordinates.

* Tip: Use¬†`""blocks""`¬†mode to extract content by sections (paragraphs, images, tables).
* Client scenario: A publishing company needed to extract all embedded images from e-books for reuse. With PyMuPDF, they built a pipeline that pulled images in seconds.

&#8203;

    import fitz
    doc = fitz.open(""ebook.pdf"")
    page = doc[0]
    print(page.get_text(""blocks""))

# 5. Camelot

[See repository on GitHub](https://github.com/camelot-dev/camelot)

**What it‚Äôs built for:**¬†Extracting¬†**tables**¬†with surgical precision.

* Modes:¬†`lattice`¬†(PDFs with visible lines) and¬†`stream`¬†(no visible grid).
* Real use: An accounting team automated expense reports, saving dozens of hours each quarter.

&#8203;

    import camelot
    tables = camelot.read_pdf(""expenses.pdf"", flavor=""lattice"")
    tables[0].to_csv(""expenses.csv"")

# 6. tabula-py

[See repository on GitHub](https://github.com/chezou/tabula-py)

**Why it‚Äôs popular:**¬†A Python wrapper around¬†**Tabula (Java)**¬†that sends tables straight into pandas DataFrames.

* **Tip for analysts:**¬†If your workflow is already in pandas,¬†`tabula-py`¬†is the fastest way to integrate PDF data.
* **Example:**¬†A data team at a logistics company parsed invoices and immediately used pandas for KPI dashboards.

&#8203;

    import tabula
    df_list = tabula.read_pdf(""invoices.pdf"", pages=""all"")
    print(df_list[0].head())

# 7. OCR with pytesseract + pdf2image

[Tesseract OCR | pdf2image](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)

**When you need it:**¬†For scanned PDFs with no embedded text.

* Pro tip: Always preprocess images (resize, grayscale, sharpen) before sending them to Tesseract.
* Real scenario: A medical clinic digitized old patient records. OCR turned piles of scans into searchable text databases.

&#8203;

    from pdf2image import convert_from_path
    import pytesseract
    
    pages = convert_from_path(""scanned.pdf"", dpi=300)
    text = ""\n"".join(pytesseract.image_to_string(p) for p in pages)
    print(text)

# Bonus: Docling (AI-Powered)

[See repository on GitHub](https://github.com/DS4SD/docling)

**Why it‚Äôs trending:**¬†Over 10k ‚≠ê in weeks. It uses AI to handle complex layouts, formulas, diagrams, and integrates with modern frameworks like LangChain.

* Example: Researchers use it to process scientific PDFs with math equations, something classic libraries often fail at.

# Final Thoughts

Extracting data from PDFs no longer has to feel like breaking into a vault. With these¬†**free Python PDF libraries**, you can choose the right tool depending on whether you need raw text, structured tables, or OCR for scanned documents.",0,1757235923.0,Python,3,0.37,False

Choosing the right foods can make weight loss easier by keeping you full, energized, and on track to hit your goals. It‚Äôs not about restrictive diets but about nutrient-dense, satisfying meals that support a calorie deficit. Let‚Äôs explore science-backed food choices, practical tips, debunk myths, and inspire you to start your weight loss journey with confidence.

# Why Food Choices Matter for Weight Loss

To lose weight, you need to consume fewer calories than you burn, but the quality of those calories matters. The question **what to eat to lose weight** is about picking foods that are filling, nutrient-rich, and low in empty calories to make a calorie deficit sustainable. The right foods also support metabolism and reduce cravings. Ready to build your plate? Here‚Äôs how.

# What to Eat to Lose Weight: Top Food Choices

Here are the best foods to focus on for **what to eat to lose weight**, along with why they work:

* **Vegetables (low-calorie, high-fiber)**: Leafy greens (spinach, kale), broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini, and peppers are low in calories (20-50 per cup) and high in fiber, keeping you full. Aim for half your plate to be veggies.
* **Lean proteins**: Chicken breast, turkey, fish (salmon, cod), tofu, eggs, and legumes (lentils, chickpeas) boost metabolism and preserve muscle. Aim for 20-30 grams per meal (e.g., 4 oz chicken or 2 eggs).
* **Whole grains**: Quinoa, brown rice, oats, and whole-grain pasta provide steady energy and fiber. Keep portions small (1/2 cup cooked) to manage calories.
* **Healthy fats**: Avocado, nuts (almonds, walnuts), olive oil, and seeds add flavor and satiety but are calorie-dense, so stick to small portions (e.g., 1/4 avocado or 1 tbsp oil).
* **Low-sugar fruits**: Berries, apples, and pears are high in fiber and low in sugar, curbing sweet cravings without spiking blood sugar. Aim for 1-2 servings daily.
* **Water and unsweetened drinks**: Water (8-10 cups daily), herbal tea, or black coffee reduce bloating and replace high-calorie drinks like soda or juice.

These foods are the foundation of **what to eat to lose weight** because they‚Äôre nutrient-dense, filling, and support a calorie deficit.

# Practical Tips for Eating to Lose Weight

Here‚Äôs how to put **what to eat to lose weight** into action:

* **Plan your meals**: Prep meals or snacks ahead to avoid impulsive eating. Try batch-cooking veggies and proteins for quick assembly.
* **Fill up on veggies first**: Start meals with a large salad or steamed veggies to reduce hunger before higher-calorie foods.
* **Control portions**: Use smaller plates or measure portions (e.g., 1/2 cup grains, 3-4 oz protein) to stay within your calorie goal (typically 1,200-1,800 for weight loss).
* **Limit processed foods**: Cut back on chips, cookies, and fast food, which are high in calories and low in nutrients, triggering overeating.
* **Eat slowly**: Take 20 minutes per meal to feel full on less food, helping you stick to your calorie target.
* **Track your intake**: Use an app or journal for a week to learn portion sizes and ensure you‚Äôre in a 500-750 calorie deficit daily.

These habits make **what to eat to lose weight** sustainable and effective.

# Busting Myths About Weight Loss Foods

There‚Äôs a lot of confusion around **what to eat to lose weight**. Let‚Äôs debunk some myths:

* **Myth: You must avoid carbs.** Whole grains like quinoa or oats provide energy and fiber. It‚Äôs refined carbs (white bread, pastries) to limit.

* **Myth: You need specialty diet foods.** Prepackaged ‚Äúdiet‚Äù foods are often expensive and less filling than whole foods like veggies and proteins.
* **Myth: Supplements are essential.** Products like Mitolyn may claim to boost metabolism, but they lack FDA approval and aren‚Äôt a substitute for real food.
* **Myth: You can‚Äôt eat after 7 PM.** Timing matters less than total calories. Eating late is fine if it fits your calorie budget.

1naofkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditonwiki/comments/1naofkl/aita_for_reporting_my_manager_and_quitting/,AITA for reporting my manager and quitting because she was shut taking me,"Hello! I really love the show and have been listing for a few years, and I just wanted some advice and I‚Äôm open to criticism. I (18f) have been working at a coffee shop for about two months. This isn‚Äôt first job. I‚Äôve had multiple other jobs that I‚Äôve worked for long periods of time since I was 15. my other job (that I still currently work at) that I‚Äôve been at for a year. I‚Äôm in college and my parents are helping me pay, but I also want to pitch in, so that‚Äôs why I picked up this other job. (It‚Äôs kinda important to know at the time I was working 3 jobs and working 40 hrs a week a While being s full time biomed student) I want to be more financially Responsible now. When I first got to this job, I low-key just got a very passive aggressive vibes from my manager (20 something f), for example it was my first day and she asked if I wanted to go on bar. I didn‚Äôt know if she was talking to me or not cause she didn‚Äôt say my name or anything to indicate she was talking to me, so I just asked ‚ÄúOh, are you talking to me?‚Äù and she responded with ‚Äúwho else would I be talking to.‚Äù Besides that I understand everybody can just have a bad day, so I just want to give her the benefit of the doubt. 

After that we had a really great conversation. I connected my phone to the speaker, and a BTS song came up. She was singing along, were just chatting about it being army and whatnot, and my I started like her a lot more because I just genuinely thought she was just having a bad day that day. After that. She gave me her BTS albums and I thought we were all good after that, though as things proceeded, I just felt like she was just talking to me less and less, which is OK. We don‚Äôt have to be friends, but it just got to like where she was straight up, ignoring me.

 For example, I would say hi. She wouldn‚Äôt respond. I just thought maybe she can‚Äôt hear me. I would complement her hair and her outfit. She would again ignore me. Or be like thanksüòë She genuinely like did not talk to me at all during our shifts. It has probably like I‚Äôve been a month since the last time I‚Äôve talked to her. (There was also a lot of other issues like food freshness that I brought up to her which is a whole other thing)

Then I just been getting an weird feeling, and I honestly was starting to really hate working there. I really live talking to people and making drinks, but It was getting very lonely. I get that I was the youngest one there I started working there. I was 17 but recently turned 18 but like people just wouldn‚Äôt really talk to me Unless I talk to them. It lowkey made me feel like shit, but at the end of the day it‚Äôs just a job. I started getting closer to one of my coworkers, besides that it was just extremely lonely to be there for eight hours and nobody talking to me much. 

One day I was just having a pretty bad day. I was just I just had a bad vibe because my manager, again, didn‚Äôt acknowledge me at all, but she‚Äôs chatting with my other coworker. I remember I heard a phone ding, and I thought my boyfriend had texted me back because he was at school. I looked down. I saw my coworkers phone and her and the manager were making fun of me because I had made a drink wrong (mind you I didn‚Äôt make the drink wrong I just put it in the wrong cup)with that, you can probably assume they‚Äôve been making fun of me for a while. I undecided you‚Äôre critiquing me but making fun of me doesn‚Äôt help

Immediately I Just started applying for a new job, and since I had a pretty good amount of experience, I got hired pretty quickly for retail. I told the one coworker I was close with that I was going to be quitting soon. And after that, that‚Äôs when I kind of just realize all the shit That was going down. I was honestly kind of hurt she knew but never told me, but then she was just telling me all the shit that my manager was saying about me. For example, once I had a shift and my thighs were killing me cause I just started going back to the gym. I took my 10 minutes and went to my car to work on some homework. my manager asked my coworker where I was going. She responded that I went to the gym the other day, because my legs hurt. I was just gonna take my break and sit down Do some homework (mind you she knows how much I work while being in school and paying for school and that I get pretty exhausted). for whatever reason she was getting mad that I was leaving while it was slow( which is 
Like, do you want me to leave while we‚Äôre in a rush‚Ä¶) and was just complaining that I didn‚Äôt need to take a brea, why was I taking a break, I‚Äôve only worked for this many hours, and just complaining so much. 
She had also been saying how slow I am how my schedules to specific (which like don‚Äôt hire a college student then or be upfront about how my schedule won‚Äôt work) just saying a bunch of unnecessary rude and nasty shit. If that‚Äôs how she‚Äôs going to talk about me. That‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôm just going to remove myself from the siruarion

I don‚Äôt know after that That‚Äôs what I was really done. It was pretty disrespectful and rude. And truthfully I don‚Äôt need to work there. I still wanted to be courteous though, and just put in my two weeks. And did it that night because honestly, I was just over it. I sent it to my manager. I was very respectful even though at this point I honestly didn‚Äôt really like her. Because it seems like for whatever reason she has his one side of beef against me.
I woke up to look at her response and the next thing I know all of our messages are Gone. I just assumed she deleted all our messages for whatever reason or blocked me.

at this point I‚Äôm just really frustrated but I wanna give her the benefit of the doubt. I understand Shit happens, so I try to give it a few days. Five days have passed at this point, and I‚Äôm like this is fucking ridiculous. I‚Äôm just gonna quit at this point. I still want to be respectful and work my shifts that I aheb for the week anyways and then quit. I check to see that she actually just didn‚Äôt put me on the schedule at all. Like I got zero hours and zero minutes. 

After that, I was just really pissed pff and annoyed. I honestly wasn‚Äôt even gonna say anything at first and just try to keep it classic and cute, but I just got so upset and this may be where I‚Äôm the asshole. 

The person above her would technically be the building owner(for this specific franchise), so I texted her and honestly, I just kind of went off. which, looking back wasn‚Äôt the most mature thing. whenever I left a job in the past. Even if I had a issue with someone, I‚Äôve just left it as professional. I just explained the situation, how our interactions have gone, and my reason for quitting the way I am.

I don‚Äôt want her to get in trouble or anything, But I think she‚Äôs just to needs to be more aware of how she treats people, because a lot of people share my opinion. 

After that I finally messaged her was , and again tried to be very professional I tried to be very respectful about it.I said something along the lines of, hey, I don‚Äôt really know why you delete the messages or some thing when I put in my two weeks originally. This is pretty rude. I also don‚Äôt really j
Understand why you took me off the schedule. I‚Äôm just gonna go ahead and quit, and I just told her wish her the best.

 She message back immediately. I texted her pretty early in the morning. Like two in the morning, because I was finishing up some schoolwork and She immediately saw it and to be honest She kind of had like a rude response, which I can kind of understand because I did text her at a really odd time. She was like ‚Äú I don‚Äôt really know why you‚Äôre texting me this early in the morning, but OK,‚Äù which I was like. I mean, you didn‚Äôt have to respond, but I can understand where she‚Äôs coming from. And she was just explaining like the system crash, like all of our chats deleted all of the stuff; which, to a certain extent, I get that, but if you saw that I sent you something why wouldn‚Äôt you just ask me to send it again‚Ä¶ Or talk to me in person about it. 

She then said she felt like she had never been rude to me.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve been little stressed lately, so I might‚Äôve been quiet.‚Äù I just responded and I was just kind of done.  I‚Äôve already quit at this point and I responded.‚Äù I‚Äôm sorry that you‚Äôre feeling stressed. I hope you guys can get lots of new people in to take some stuff off your shoulders,‚Äù and I clarified. I was like ‚ÄúI think we did have some good conversations at first, but I do feel like you were dismissed to me after a while and you do not acknowledge me at all. I‚Äôm sorry if I did anything to that made me seem like I was being passive agressive toward you or anything, best wishes‚Äù, (obviously revised)we would have to be like that towards me. (Despite all of that I can understand some things but it lowkey still feels like BS. Why did you or schedule me at all??? If you didn‚Äôt see my notice than what other reason would you not give a single second of work?

 now I just feel kind of guilty. I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm kind of a doormat and I have a lot of trouble standing up for myself, so this was really difficult for me to do. I personally feel like I‚Äôm not in the wrong, becausei know my feelings are valid, and my drive to work should include me crying because I stressed about how no one‚Äôs going to talk to me and how they‚Äôre making fun of me behind my back. I don‚Äôt know. I feel bad. I would hate that she loses her job or anything like that. But I just want her to know that she‚Äôs treating people badly. Even if she‚Äôs stressed out, it‚Äôs not an excuse to take it out On other people and be an asshole.

 I don‚Äôt know. I would really love some feedback. I‚Äôm really young. I‚Äôm willing to learn about how I can be better and grow. Looking back, I should‚Äôve just quit and moved on but yeah, am i the asshole (sorry it‚Äôs 5 am and I just have very bad anxiety so sorry if this is poorly written)

I have some issues with being around friends atm though and I am getting resentful.
We'll catch up for walks and sometimes stop by a cafe at the beach.
I never really feel like anything but my friend will always want a coffee or something.
They know I'm trying to lose weight and get on top of my eating habits.
They always buy something and insist that I share with them.
Recently they bought cake with their coffee and insisted I share it with them.
Today we went for a walk and stopped again.
I got a small juice and they got fish and chips and kept telling me to eat it when I already told them I had already had lunch.
I've gotten to the point where I don't want to eat around them or anything.
I don't really know what to do or say? Like I tell them no more then once and they won't let it go.

I hope this finds the right audience.

Roughly a year ago I found out that the multiple migraine attacks i get per week are mostly related to the amounts of coffee (and caffeine) I drink. While at the point I have never heard of a relation between those two, since then I found 2 other people who have the same problem. I switched to either decaf or no drinking coffee at all and since then the quantity and strength of the attacks are alot lower. This is probably all not too new to this r/.

I want to expand this idea a little more and want to hear your personal experiences and opinions on this.
1.	‚Å†Do you or a person around you, have found a correlation between migraine and Caffeine consumption?
2.	‚Å†If yes, Is every Caffeine the Same? I have the feeling that Caffeine drinks from Nature (Tea, Coffee, meaning Theine e.g.) have chamical compounds that are similar to caffeine but have a worse effect on my health than an artifical ""pure"" Coffeine drink, that is not an energy drink (Coke for example). This idea is also supported by the fact that nicotine products have caused migraine in the past. While not a chemist, I heard that nicotine and caffeine are part of the same chemical group. I don`t know if that is true.
3.	‚Å†Have you found a solution to this? Magnesium Pills can offset the strenght of the attack for me if I take them daily.

Thank you for your help.

Stone Free Read online,"I heard the footsteps of a couple of boys in the hallway before they managed to open the door to my bedroom. I could sense it was another hot Saturday for late September through the glare of sunlight assaulting me from the window. For me, who had grown up in Illinois, I was unused to the warmth of southern summer so late in the year. The boys kept telling me I could expect summer days on through November. It seemed impossible but I‚Äôd believe it when I felt it.  
  
¬† The footsteps quieted by my door. The handle was twisted, the door had been unlocked. I was under the sheet and thin blanket on my bed, the one Victor bought for me. I could still smell him in the sheets since he‚Äôd spent the night with me. He didn‚Äôt need to, none of the boys did, but they did it anyway often enough. Marie and I were alone, but we were never really truly alone when the Academy was always watching.  
  
¬† I‚Äôd slept in. Seven a.m. was late to sleep in for boys who were usually up and working at dawn. However, Victor kept me up late watching a movie, and I was feeling lazy.  
  
¬† My skin electrified. The boys in my room were being sneaky. I had no clue what they were up to. My fingers clutched the blanket, ready to hold tight to it or push it back and jump up and catch them at whatever they were doing.  
  
¬† The edge of my blanket was collected at the foot of my bed in someone else‚Äôs grasp.  
  
¬† Silence. Either side was waiting for the other to strike first.  
  
¬† My blanket was yanked from my grasp. I  
raced to pop up and go after whoever it was.  
  
¬† A spray of ice water smacked me in the face. The edge of a shrill cry caught in my throat but I held it in. Screaming was pointless.  
  
¬† There was a rush for the door. I caught Nathan and Gabriel dashing out, large Super Soaker guns in their hands. Nathan was shirtless. His muscular, tanned body left me breathless. He wore red sport shorts, and was barefoot. His reddish brown hair was wet, sticking up.  
  
¬† Gabriel‚Äôs leaner frame was also shirtless. He wore camouflage shorts. Two locks of blond hair stuck wet to his cheeks and the rest of his russet brown hair was raked back, hanging behind his ears. White crystal studs hung from each lobe, and three black rings were pierced into his right ear toward the top crest.  
  
¬† Their running, like a roll of thunder, rumbled through the house as the they raced down the front stairs. They threw open the front door and ran outside.  
  
¬† My wakeup call had been delivered.  
  
¬† More footsteps rushed up the backstairs. I jumped up on the bed, moving to the wall next to my door, pressing my back to the frame. I‚Äôd gotten hit in the face once and I didn‚Äôt have a weapon. I was outmatched for speed and power by all of the guys so it didn‚Äôt matter who it was. I hoped I could garner sympathy from my new assailant.  
  
¬† The footsteps padded closer, slowed, and stopped behind the wall.  
  
¬† I peeked out into the hallway.  
  
¬† Luke peeked back in at me.  
  
¬† His shirt was gone, too. His khaki shorts hung low on his hips. His tapered shoulders were starting to get a little pink from sun. His longish blond hair was sloshed behind his head, tied back with a clip he‚Äôd probably borrowed from me. He grinned down at me, his brown eyes brightening.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAbout time you got up,‚Äù he said. He stepped back, holding out a second Super Soaker gun. Pink. ‚ÄúLook what the Kota fairy got for us.‚Äù  
  
¬† I grinned. Kota bought us new toys. I took the pink gun from Luke, holding it in my hands and feeling the weight.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to run out the front door,‚Äù Luke said. ‚ÄúHead out the back and around the house. I‚Äôll try to get their attention. You do that super silent thing you do and sneak up on them.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know what he was talking about. What super quiet thing? Tiptoeing?  
  
¬† I raced back to my bookshelf, snatching up a hair clip to twist back my hair quickly to keep it out of my eyes. I checked my clothes, soft gray shorts and a light pink bra cami tank top. I was decent enough for water guns.  
  
¬† I ran down the back steps, listening as Luke did the same on the front steps and headed out the front door. I would have to hurry.  
  
¬† I ran past the side door, flew through the family room and unlocked the back door out onto the screened in back porch.  
  
¬† The morning greeted me with a wave of thick heat. A basketball was bouncing in the driveway and there was the echo of shuffling tennis shoes meeting the beige concrete. I closed the door behind me, jumping down the brick steps to land on the blue utility carpet.  
  
¬† Silas‚Äôs tall, strong frame flew into view, nearly hovering as he stood on his toes over North in the driveway. North might have been a few inches shorter, but with the fierceness in his almost-scary face from his intense eyes and strong, two days unshaven jaw, you‚Äôd never know it.  
  
¬† North clutched the basketball in his hand, avoiding Silas. Kota ran in, his black rimmed glasses sliding down his nose, sweat making the hunter green T-shirt he wore stick to his back. North tossed him the ball. Derrick, a boy from up the road, raced after Kota, trying to block him as Kota aimed for the basket and tried to get off a shot. Derrick was probably the same size as Kota, wearing only a pair of cut off jean shorts that hung low off of his hips, revealing a trace outline of dark boxers underneath. Derrick was deeply tanned from long days spent outdoors all summer. He was a new face, though, as he hadn‚Äôt been there all week, when the other boys had. Word must have gotten out that the house was no longer a place to stay away from.  
  
¬† I was surprised, too, to find Micah and Tom, a couple of twelve-year-old boys, in the backyard, bouncing on top of a large trampoline. The trampoline had been something like a consolation prize from my father before he last left. He never even finished building it but North fixed it up. I hadn‚Äôt been on it yet, mostly because I didn‚Äôt want to enjoy it. I didn‚Äôt like the meaning of it. I didn‚Äôt mind the others using it. In fact, I was glad. At least someone liked it.  
  
¬† My stepmom would have had a fit seeing all these boys running around the yard, through the house, and playing with me.  
  
¬† I ran for the screen door in the porch that led out into the yard. I flung open the door, stepping out into the grass, feeling the heat heavy around me, the water swishing in the gun in my hands.  
  
¬† North stopped in mid-step, glancing over at me and temporarily distracted from his basketball game. He smiled after me, his black hair hanging in his eyes. I gave him a small wave and a wink before dashing off in the opposite direction, heading around the back of the house toward the side yard, taking the longer way around to the front.  
  
¬† I crouched by the bushes surrounding the front porch, glancing over them for Nathan and Gabriel.  
  
¬† Luke was dashing around the front yard. Nathan was on his heels and after him. They aimed their water guns at each other, spraying the other one down with a fresh blast every few seconds. The front yard was large and bare, with plenty of space for running around. I didn‚Äôt have much to block me if I just ran out there. And where was ...  
  
¬† A spritz of cold water caught me in the back. I squealed and without thinking, started to run. I found out where Gabriel was. So much for the surprise attack.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOy, Trouble,‚Äù Gabriel called after me, laughing.  
  
¬† I flew across the yard. My cover was blown. Time for rushing in head first.  
  
¬† I pumped my water gun and aimed for Nathan as he dashed after Luke. I caught him in the back with the spray of my gun. He turned, spotted me and started running.  
  
¬† I cut across the yard, Gabriel was after me, too, taking a different angle. I ran as hard as I could toward the porch but there wasn‚Äôt much point. Both of them were much faster than I was.  
  
¬† Gabriel managed to cut me off before I made it to the steps. I aimed my gun at him as he started to squirt at my chest and stomach. I caught him in the face as I turned again, intending to run back around the house.  
  
¬† No use. Nathan caught up with me, scooping me up by hooking his arm around my waist and dropped me into a soft tackle to the ground. I landed on my back. He sat square on my hips. I aimed my pink gun at his face as he aimed his orange one at mine.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSay ‚Äòmercy‚Äô,‚Äù he warned, his eyebrows shifting above his blue eyes, a wide grin splashed on his face. Droplets of water sashayed down the ripples of his abs.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I called out. I pulled the trigger to squirt water at him.  
  
¬† Only I‚Äôd forgotten to pump my gun and I got the last of a trickle before the pressure ended.  
  
¬† Nathan made an evil-sounding cackle. ‚ÄúBrave words from a dead girl who forgot to load her gun.‚Äù  
  
¬† He fired. Ice liquid shot at my face. I dropped the gun to hold both hands up at the end of his, blocking the spray. The water still caught me against the neck and around the top of my shirt.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I squealed, laughing. ‚ÄúStop.‚Äù  
  
¬† Gabriel came over, standing over my head, his camo shorts dripping on my face. He aimed his gun at me. ‚ÄúYou should know better than to put your gun down.‚Äù He squirted me in the face with a short shot.  
  
¬† I blocked my head with my arms. The water bit into my skin with a sharp chill. ‚ÄúHoly crow, how is the water so cold?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe put ice in it,‚Äù Gabriel said, pumping his gun.  
  
¬† Luke flew over me, jumping over my body and aiming his gun at Gabriel and catching him in the side of his head. Gabriel shot off after him. Luke flew over the rail of the front porch, using it as a bunker as he aimed over it at Gabriel and fired. Gabriel crept around the bushes, crouching up the steps. They both shot streams of water at each other before Luke flew back over the rail, landing in the yard to fly across the grass towa  
rd the side of the house. Gabriel went after him.  
  
¬† Nathan laughed, aiming the gun back at my face. ‚ÄúCome on, say mercy and I‚Äôll let you up.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I squealed, giggling and pushing his gun away, reaching for mine.  
  
¬† Nathan let go of his gun, holding it in one hand while with his free hand, he snatched up my gun and chucked it a few feet away and out of my reach. ‚ÄúSay it,‚Äù he grumbled at me, a playful growl emanating from him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I wailed again, now trying to twist my body around, gripping at the ground to claw my way out from under him. He sank his full weight onto my body, pinning me to the ground. A free hand found my face, and he squeezed my cheeks until I made a fish face.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSang,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúyou‚Äôve got to learn how to admit when you‚Äôre outgunned. Now say it.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù My squeaking mumbled through fish lips. I pushed his gun away, poking him in the ribs, trying to tickle my way out.  
  
¬† He laughed, patting my hands away as if he were swatting away flies. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt work on me, sweetheart.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLuke!‚Äù I cried out.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúKinda busy,‚Äù Luke called back, running past my head. Gabriel jumped over me on his heels. Luke was out in the open, crossing the large front yard and made a U-turn back around, running for a tree in the far corner almost in the neighbor‚Äôs yard, to hide behind.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSay mercy and I‚Äôll let you up,‚Äù Nathan said to me. He hooked fingers onto the hem of my shirt, lifting slightly to expose my belly. He aimed the end of the gun there. ‚ÄúDo it.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare,‚Äù I called out. I had one more plan left, and it was dirty. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt or I‚Äôll do it.‚Äù  
  
¬† Nathan‚Äôs eyebrows shot up in surprise. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLet me go or I‚Äôll do it.‚Äù  
  
¬† Nathan smirked at me, curiosity in his eyes. He pulled the trigger. A stream of ice water caught me square in the stomach.  
  
¬† I wriggled under him, trying to block the spray against my bare skin.. ‚ÄúYou asked for it,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúSilas!‚Äù I squealed out through my laughing. Part of my shout cut off midway and trailed off and I blamed it on my giddiness, but it was enough to draw the attention of who I wanted.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou did not,‚Äù Nathan said, his hand shot out to cover my mouth, his head jerking up to scan the perimeter.  
  
¬† It was too late. Silas was on the warpath, barreling down after us, aiming right for Nathan. Nathan scrambled to get off of me, aiming his gun at Silas‚Äôs broad chest and firing. It didn‚Äôt deter him as Silas caught Nathan in a full frontal tackle. Nathan was on his back on the ground. Silas sat on his hips, capturing his wrists and pinning those to the ground with his knees.  
¬† I scrambled to get my gun, stepping up behind Silas, my stomach to his back, as I aimed over his shoulder at Nathan‚Äôs face.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFucking shit,‚Äù Nathan said breathlessly. ‚ÄúShe even cheats at water guns.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYup,‚Äù Silas called out proudly. ‚ÄúGet him, aggele mou.‚Äù  
  
¬† I pumped my gun and sprayed down Nathan with a long stream, starting from his stomach and ending at his face.  
  
¬† Nathan laughed, stretching to try to pull his arms out from under Silas.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThank you, Silas,‚Äù I said to him, touching lightly at the back of his neck.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOy, Trouble!‚Äù  
  
¬† It was the only warning I got before Gabriel shot across the yard, aiming his water gun at me. Luke was running behind him, firing, but his gun was out of water.  
  
¬† I laughed, running away from Silas as he was letting Nathan up off the ground.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMeanie!‚Äù I called after Gabriel as I dashed across the yard, heading toward the driveway, thinking I might be able to cut through the basketball game. Maybe I could use Kota as a shield. Gabriel wouldn‚Äôt dare shoot Kota.  
  
¬† I turned around as a gray BMW pulled into the driveway, parking in the middle of it to give room to those playing basketball. A thrill swept over me. Victor had left early to go to do some work for the Academy. I‚Äôd thought he was going to be gone all day but was glad that he was back early.  
  
¬† His car also gave me perfect cover.  
  
¬† I ran right for the car, the plan formulating in my mind. Gabriel hollered after me, but I was flying ahead of him. I had a clean head start.  
  
¬† Prompted by a deep instinct telling me that I could, I ran for the front of the car. I jumped, pushing my body up to vault myself over the front. My butt heated against the hood as I slid across. I landed like a cat on my feet on the other side. I crouched, pressing my back against the wheel as I pumped the pink water gun.  
  
¬† The Terminator couldn‚Äôt have done it any better.  
  
¬† The car door opened, followed by footsteps coming around the car. I waited only a moment. Not that I would squirt Victor too much. Just a small spritz to welcome him back.  
  
¬† I caught the shadow coming around the edge of the car, I turned, propping myself up a little as I aimed at a red tie and fired.  
  
¬† And I fell back on my butt, when my gaze met with cool, steel-gray eyes.  
  
¬† I dropped my gun to catch myself with my hands before I fell back too far. The gun clattered to the ground.  
  
¬† Mr. Blackbourne finished stepping around the corner of the car, a brown eyebrow shooting up over the rim of his glasses. The dark suit coat he wore was open, revealing the white shirt, probably Armani or Gucci. A wet splotch of water spread across his chest, center mass. ‚ÄúYou should know who you‚Äôre aiming at before you fire, Miss Sorenson,‚Äù he said, as calmly as if he were explaining a math problem to me.  
  
¬† My heart raced. I just iced down the only person I knew who, with just a look, could send me to my knees.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúS‚Äìs-sorry,‚Äù I said, not feeling so confident now.  
  
¬† Mr. Blackbourne stretched out a hand to me, which surprised me enough to make me hesitate. He‚Äôd never done that before. I lifted mine, dropping it in his. His smooth, perfect fingers wrapped around mine as he assisted me to a standing position. When I was on my feet, I was inches away from him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúRemind me to have you trained in gunmanship,‚Äù he said. The tight corners of his mouth moving up a millimeter.  
  
¬† I released the breath I felt I‚Äôd been holding that whole time. I didn‚Äôt think I wanted to make him angry.  
  
¬† From behind him, the other members of the Academy collected: Silas, Luke, North, Nathan, Kota and Gabriel. North held the basketball to his hip. The others stood by, waiting. Derrick had fallen back, standing under the goal, his arms crossed over his chest.  
  
¬† Mr. Blackbourne‚Äôs eyes remained on me as he spoke. ‚ÄúI came over because I tried to reach certain members of my team by phone. Apparently, they‚Äôre all ... distracted.‚Äù The millimeter smile disappeared as he turned toward the guys. ‚ÄúAnd I can see why.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù Kota said. He flicked the sweat from his brow. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt realize.‚Äù  
  
¬† The others murmured similar apologizes.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have time for that,‚Äù Mr. Blackbourne said, turning toward his car. ‚ÄúKota, Luke, Nathan, in the car with me. North, Silas, Gabriel, follow. We‚Äôve got work to do.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat about Sang?‚Äù Gabriel asked, dropping his water gun to the ground. Playtime was over.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt work for me. Let‚Äôs go,‚Äù Mr. Blackbourne moved around the car again, heading toward the driver‚Äôs seat. Was this Mr. Blackbourne‚Äôs car that looked identical to Victor‚Äôs? Or was he driving Victor‚Äôs car? Where was Victor? And why were they all leaving now?  
  
¬† I bit back the questions. I knew better. Academy business was secret. I wasn‚Äôt a part of it.  
  
¬† Kota, Luke and Nathan found their shoes and shirts quickly and raced toward the car. Mr. Blackbourne pulled the car out of the drive as soon as the doors closed and was down the road again.  
  
¬† I collected the dropped water guns and headed toward the garage. Silas and Gabriel were collecting their phones they had left on the ground. North was shuffling a shirt the right way to drop it over his head. ‚ÄúDerrick, do me a favor?‚Äù  
  
¬† Derrick had collected the basketball and was taking random shots alone at the goal. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStay with Sang? Until one of us can get back?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine,‚Äù I said. I thought I was. My mother wasn‚Äôt there with any more crazy punishments for me. My father wasn‚Äôt there. There was no one left to do any harm.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHumor me, Sang Baby.‚Äù North eyeballed Derrick. ‚ÄúPlease?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI guess so. Whatever,‚Äù Derrick said, shrugging and looking at me.  
  
¬† North frowned but nodded. He waved to me as he stalked off, following Gabriel and Silas to North‚Äôs black Jeep that he had parked at Kota‚Äôs house. They rushed over to it, getting in. The Jeep started up and disappeared down the road, too.  
  
¬† THE OTHER FRIENDS  
  
¬† And that was it. They were gone. I stared down the road where I last saw the Jeep disappear around the bend. It was like I was waiting for one for one of them to come back. Just kidding, Sang. Of course, I can stay with you and not leave you alone. One of them. Any of them.  
  
¬† But no. They were really gone. Academy business.  
  
¬† Derrick bounced the ball around himself, taking a shot at the basket. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre always so weird.‚Äù  
  
¬† I turned on him, my mouth opened and ready to fly to their defense. My tongue stilled as I got caught up watching as Derrick chased the ball and brought it back, lifting it over his head backward as he ran out of the garage and it swished into the basket overhead.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow long have you known them?‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt a challenge, but genuine curiosity. Derrick lived on this street before me, and he‚Äôd known Kota and Nathan at least for a few years. He didn‚Äôt flinch when Mr. Blackbourne showed up.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Derrick said. ‚ÄúI went to elementary school with half of them until they started going to that private school.‚Äù He pushed some of the lower locks of his bowl haircut away from his forehead, stopping the sweat from dripping into his eyes.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre pretty nice,‚Äù I said  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUh huh. Nice. Too nice. That‚Äôs how they get you. They want you to hang out. They ask you to come over and help with a small favor. The next thing you know it‚Äôs a big favor.‚Äù  
  
¬† Kota had told me once they‚Äôd tried to bring in another member into the team. ‚ÄúDid they try to ... to ...?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTo recruit me?‚Äù Derrick smirked, holding the ball at his hip. ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd you didn‚Äôt want to join,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to work that hard. That‚Äôs all they do. You‚Äôve just seen it. It‚Äôs an early Saturday morning. They‚Äôre off to do something. They‚Äôre always working. It‚Äôs been like that since we were little. Maybe it‚Äôs swiping Gabriel‚Äôs dad‚Äôs booze so he wouldn‚Äôt drink that night. Or taking the grade book from the teacher‚Äôs desk to change up the numbers when a teacher was unforgiving  
to some poor kid who was out sick the week before. Maybe it‚Äôs stealing apples from the school cafeteria for the diabetic twins who were starving. They were always doing something then, and they‚Äôre always up to something now.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThey did that? They stole?‚Äù I stepped a little closer to him. I wanted to make sure I caught every word.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLuke did,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLuke could steal the pencil from your closed hand and be out the door before you knew it was gone. The others helped him. They started that in kindergarten. Only back then, Victor gave them the plan, and Kota was the lookout. Gabriel distracted the teachers while Luke swooped in and stole. Nathan covered their tracks.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat was before they went to the private school?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe Academy? Yeah. That was before. Just the five of them. Then that Mr. Blackbourne caught them breaking into the principal‚Äôs office one day and that was it. The next week they were all out of public school.‚Äù He dropped the basketball, letting it roll toward the garage. ‚ÄúWant to go jump on the trampoline?‚Äù  
  
¬† I didn‚Äôt really. I wanted to ask more about the boys. Could they be thieves? Is that what they were now? Mr. Blackbourne, who couldn‚Äôt have been much older than them at the time, swooped in and took them out of school. The Academy got kids to steal for them? It didn‚Äôt seem likely but Derrick appeared to be convinced.  
  
¬† Prodding him for more information felt rude. I nodded slowly, following him around the corner of the back of the house, beyond the screened in porch. Micah and Tom sat together on the trampoline talking to themselves.  
  
¬† Micah turned his head to us, his blond hair cut evenly around his head at his shoulders. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat do you mean what?‚Äù Derrick said. ‚ÄúWe want a turn.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired. I don‚Äôt want to move,‚Äù Micah complained, laying back on the black mat of the trampoline.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThen get off and let us go.‚Äù Derrick climbed up on the metal bar frame, hoisting himself up until he stumbled out onto the mat. He tested the springs, bouncing low and moving across to where Micah laid. He curled up, protecting himself by covering his head with his arms as Derrick jumped, bouncing hard next to him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStop,‚Äù Micah grumbled.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou getting on?‚Äù Tom asked me. His thin, deeply tanned body shone with sweat. Short, curly locks of hair stuck against his head. He was small for his age, like Micah. I could have mistaken them for being eight or nine instead of twelve if I didn‚Äôt know better.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI guess so,‚Äù I said, eyeballing the metal. I was wondering if it was hot to touch.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù Derrick said. He bounce-walked back in my direction, holding a hand out. I reached out to him. Derrick used both hands to grip mine. I put a foot on the bar and he hoisted me up.  
  
¬† I hovered on the black mat, warmed by the morning sun. I walked unstable toward the middle, keeping my distance from the others so I wouldn‚Äôt hurt them.  
  
¬† Tom got up, launching his body into the air and slamming down against the mat. It was a chain reaction. I started bouncing, slowly and unstable enough that I thought I would fall. I thought the only way to stay upright was to keep bouncing on my feet. Derrick started bouncing harder.  
  
¬† Micah groaned, picking himself up. Soon we were moving in a circle, facing off. Bouncing around.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBack up for a minute,‚Äù Derrick said, holding his hand up toward me but talking to all of us. ‚ÄúI want to try something.‚Äù  
  
¬† I moved to the edge of the mat, falling to my knees, putting my hands down to hold myself up. Tom fell next to me, grinning and his breath heavy. I smiled. I liked Tom.  
  
¬† Micah jumped in the way a few times until Derrick barked at him to stop. He fell on his butt on the other side. ‚ÄúHurry up,‚Äù he said.  
  
¬† Derrick bounced hard in the middle a few times, getting higher. I wondered if he was just trying to test out how high he could bounce. I gripped the edge of the mat to not roll into the middle.  
  
¬† Derrick dropped down hard onto the trampoline, launched himself in the air and did a full frontal flip, landing on his knees.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù I called out and my voice squeaked a little. I was fully impressed and somewhat jealous.  
  
¬† Tom put fingers in his mouth to whistle, and scrambled to his feet, bounding. ‚ÄúLet me do it.‚Äù  
  
¬† Derrick backed off to another side of the trampoline and Tom bounced, though he couldn‚Äôt get as high up as Derrick. Tom launched himself, started to twist but stopped halfway, landing on his side.  
  
¬† We all giggled at him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou have to keep going,‚Äù Derrick said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt going to make it,‚Äù Tom said, getting back up on his feet. ‚ÄúI was going to land on my neck.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI want to try,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt do it,‚Äù Micah said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll break something.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWill you shut up and let her try?‚Äù Derrick asked. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs her trampoline.‚Äù  
  
¬† Micah made a face, and grumbled something I couldn‚Äôt hear.  
  
¬† I stepped up, unsure of how to proceed. ‚ÄúHow did you do it?‚Äù I asked Derrick.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúJust bounce really hard and do a tumble roll or something.‚Äù  
  
¬† I sucked in some bravery from the air, thinking of the time Silas and North and the others took turns flipping me in Nathan‚Äôs pool. It was much easier to flip when Silas was pushing on my feet to get me started.  
  
¬† I moved to the middle of the mat, my knees shaking thanks to the unstableness. I started bouncing, putting my weight into it to try to get higher. I wasn‚Äôt sure how high I had to be to try to flip.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJust try to get around until you can get back on your knees,‚Äù Derrick suggested. ‚ÄúIf you get scared, try to land on your butt.‚Äù  
  
¬† I bounced higher, sucked in a breath, squealed and pushed my front forward on an upward jump, curling into a ball. I broke out when I felt myself going down. I landed on my knees, skidding on the left one a little. It was a messy front flip. I bounced sideways, in a ricochet, ending up on my back.  
  
¬† Derrick and Tom laughed. Micah rolled his eyes.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs hard,‚Äù I said, sprawled out on my back.  
  
¬† Micah did, too, looking up at the sky.  
  
¬† Derrick and Tom started bouncing softer around us.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat do we do now?‚Äù Tom asked.  
  
¬† Tom was making me nervous as he was jumping too close to the edge where the springs were. ‚ÄúTom,‚Äù I called to him. ‚ÄúBe careful.‚Äù  
  
¬† He grunted, jumping harder as if to show me he could handle it, but a colliding ripple sent him flying backward into Derrick. Derrick crashed hard against the rim of the trampoline, and spilled over the edge, landing on the ground.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCrap,‚Äù Tom called out, turning around and leaning over the edge. ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù  
  
¬† I scrambled to the edge of the trampoline. Derrick was sprawled on his back on the ground, with his hand on his forehead, his eyes squinted shut, and he laughing.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDerrick?‚Äù I asked in a quiet voice. ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI think I broke my head.‚Äù He moved his hand to reveal a cut close to his hairline. It didn‚Äôt look deep but his blood dripped against his forehead.  
  
¬† I leapt off of the trampoline, kneeling next to him. My heart raced in panic. What was I supposed to do? ‚ÄúDid you hit it hard?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know what to ask. Should I call for help? I wondered if I could call Dr. Green.  
  
¬† Derrick laughed, sitting up. ‚ÄúNo. I just grazed it.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go inside. We can bandage it up.‚Äù I stood, backing away. I thought about offering him a hand to stand up but my body wasn‚Äôt willing to do this. With the guys, I was only starting to get used to touching. Other people were still off limits to me.  
  
¬† I was shocked that Derrick was hurt and it felt like partially my fault. I owned the trampoline so I was responsible.  
  
¬† Derrick followed me to the house, with Tom and Micah trailing behind. I led the way through the back door and into the family room. My stomach twisted when I realized I was inviting more guys into the house. I felt myself blushing, gazing at the red-orange sofa, the single small television on top of a coffee table, and a desk and  
computer in the corner. Spartan was how the Sorenson house functioned.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúRedecorating?‚Äù Micah asked.  
  
¬† I raised an eyebrow at him, confused. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShut up, Micah,‚Äù Derrick said. He turned to me. ‚ÄúCan we sit on the couch?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah, of course,‚Äù I said. Hardly anyone did. I couldn‚Äôt remember the last time I vacuumed the thing and was hoping it wasn‚Äôt too stale.  
  
¬† I flicked the switch to start up the ceiling fans and disappeared into the kitchen.  
  
¬† Marie, my sister, looked groggy still from just waking up. Her brown hair was tied back into a messy bun and the shorts and t-shirt she wore were a little wrinkled. She‚Äôd been sleeping in until well into the afternoon lately and I was surprised to see her up.  
  
¬† She looked longingly into the pantry. ‚ÄúWe need more food,‚Äù she said. She closed the door and turned to me. ‚ÄúYou should call him.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHis number‚Äôs over there,‚Äù I motioned to the house phone. There was an index card with phone numbers jotted down sitting next to it. ‚ÄúJust call.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou call,‚Äù she said.  
  
¬† I rolled my eyes. Maybe this was why our father wanted me to stay. Marie would rather starve than talk to him right now. I really couldn‚Äôt blame her. I‚Äôd been reluctant to call, too. I didn‚Äôt want to hear his voice. I was still too angry.  
  
¬† And I was afraid to hear any news about my stepmother. I was afraid to learn if she‚Äôd come home soon.  
  
¬† I found the medical kit and tucked it under my arm. I opened the fridge to collect bottles of water and carried them with me back to the family room. Derrick was on his back on the floor. Tom was on the couch next to Micah. Tom found the remote and surfed through channels. I handed off bottles of water to them.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have an Xbox?‚Äù Tom asked, and opened the water.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGirls don‚Äôt play Xbox,‚Äù Micah said.

1) A daytime perfume that smells refreshing and a bit cozy at the same time. Like walking in a rainy garden while you're sipping a slightly sweetened coffee. Colors I think of are green, tan, pink, blue.
2) A sophisticated, slightly sweeter, and (maybe) a little spicy scent that can still work for daytime, but also translates well into date night. Nothing too heavy, but distinctly feminine, a bit sensual. You're burning some candles, listening to records, spending time with your loved one on a Friday evening having a little wine and pasta and lots of laughs. (My husband and I have a baby, so we aren't doing many going out date nights, but something for a stay at home date would be lovely!) Red, gold, mahogany, cream, and purple.

Notes I love: coffee, rose, peony, vanilla, sandalwood, cedarwood, patchouli, Tonka bean, aquatic notes, bergamot, orange blossom, marshmallow, plum. Bonus points for ""clean"", paraben free, etc. ideas.

Thank you!:).

Building a successful Amazon FBA business requires more than just listing products and hoping for the best. The marketplace has become highly competitive, with millions of sellers vying for customer attention. Smart entrepreneurs understand that building a recognizable brand stands as the key differentiator between those who struggle and those who thrive.

Your brand represents your promise to customers. It communicates quality, reliability, and value. When done right, branding transforms your Amazon FBA business from a commodity seller into a trusted name that customers actively seek out. This transformation drives higher profit margins, customer loyalty, and long-term business sustainability.

The tactics outlined in this guide have been tested by successful FBA sellers across various product categories. Each strategy builds upon the others, creating a comprehensive approach to brand development that works specifically within Amazon's ecosystem.

# Understanding Amazon's Brand Registry Program

Amazon Brand Registry serves as the foundation for serious brand building on the platform. This program provides sellers with enhanced tools and protections that non-registered brands cannot access. Registration requires a registered trademark for your brand name, which creates the first barrier to entry for potential copycats.

Brand Registry unlocks access to A+ Content, which allows you to create rich product descriptions with images, comparison charts, and detailed feature explanations. This enhanced content capability can increase conversion rates by up to 20% compared to basic product listings. The visual storytelling opportunities help differentiate your products from generic alternatives.

The program also provides enhanced brand protection tools. You can report trademark violations directly through Amazon, leading to faster removal of counterfeit products. This protection becomes crucial as your brand gains recognition and attracts imitators seeking to profit from your success.

Brand Analytics, another Registry benefit, provides detailed insights into customer search behavior and market trends. You can see which search terms drive traffic to your competitors and identify gaps in the market where your brand could capture additional sales.

# Steps to Brand Registry Success

Getting approved for Brand Registry requires careful preparation. Start by filing for a trademark through your country's trademark office. The process typically takes several months, so begin this step early in your brand development journey.

Create consistent brand assets before applying. Your logo, packaging, and product imagery should all reflect a cohesive visual identity. Amazon reviews these materials during the approval process, and consistency demonstrates the legitimacy of your brand.

Document your brand story and unique value proposition. Amazon wants to see that your brand offers something distinct to customers. Generic brands that simply private label existing products without adding value face rejection.

# Product Research and Brand Positioning

Successful brand building starts with choosing the right products to sell. Your product selection should align with your brand identity and target customer base. Random product choices create confused brand messaging that fails to resonate with any specific audience.

Research your target market thoroughly before making product decisions. Understanding customer pain points, preferences, and buying behavior helps you select products that naturally fit together under your brand umbrella. This cohesion makes it easier to cross-sell additional products to existing customers.

Analyze competitor brands within your chosen niche. Identify gaps in their offerings or areas where they fall short of customer expectations. These gaps represent opportunities for your brand to differentiate itself and capture market share.

Consider the lifecycle potential of your chosen products. Brands built around trending items that quickly become obsolete struggle to maintain momentum. Choose products with staying power or ensure you can continuously innovate to stay relevant.

# Creating Your Brand Story

Every successful brand has a compelling story that connects with customers on an emotional level. Your story should explain why your brand exists and what problems it solves for customers. Generic stories about ""providing quality products"" fail to create meaningful connections.

Develop a clear mission statement that guides all your business decisions. This mission should reflect your values and the benefits you provide to customers. When faced with difficult choices, your mission statement helps maintain brand consistency.

Identify your ideal customer avatar. Create detailed profiles of the people most likely to buy your products. Understanding their demographics, interests, challenges, and goals helps you craft messaging that resonates with them specifically.

Your brand story should differentiate you from competitors while remaining authentic and believable. Avoid exaggerated claims that you cannot support with evidence. Customers quickly detect and reject inauthentic brand messaging.

# Optimizing Product Listings for Brand Building

Your product listings serve as the primary touchpoint between your brand and potential customers. Every element of your listing should reinforce your brand identity while providing the practical details customers need to make purchase decisions.

Product titles should include your brand name prominently while remaining keyword-rich and descriptive. The placement of your brand name affects how customers perceive your products. Leading with your brand name works well for established brands, while newer brands might benefit from keyword-first titles.

High-quality product photography distinguishes professional brands from amateur sellers. Invest in professional photography that showcases your products in use and highlights key features. Lifestyle images help customers envision themselves using your products, creating emotional connections that drive sales.

Product descriptions should tell a story rather than simply listing features. Explain how each feature benefits the customer and improves their life. Use language that matches your target audience's communication style and technical knowledge level.

# A+ Content Strategies

A+ Content transforms basic product descriptions into rich, engaging brand experiences. Use this space to tell your brand story, explain your unique value proposition, and showcase your products in context. The additional real estate allows for more detailed explanations of complex products.

Include comparison charts that highlight how your products outperform competitors. Focus on the features that matter most to your target customers rather than technical specifications that confuse rather than clarify. Visual comparisons communicate value more effectively than text alone.

Create lifestyle scenes that show your products being used by your target customers. These images should reflect the aspirations and values of your audience. A fitness brand might show active people using products in beautiful outdoor settings, while a tech brand might focus on productivity and efficiency.

Address common customer objections within your A+ Content. If customers frequently worry about product durability, include sections that explain your quality testing procedures. Proactively addressing concerns reduces hesitation and increases conversion rates.

# Building Customer Reviews and Social Proof

Customer reviews serve as the primary form of social proof on Amazon. Potential customers rely heavily on reviews when making purchase decisions, especially for brands they don't recognize. Building a strong review profile requires a systematic approach that encourages satisfied customers to share their experiences.

Focus on product quality first. The best review-building strategy starts with products that genuinely satisfy customer needs. No marketing tactic can overcome consistently poor product quality or customer experience. Invest in product development and quality control before implementing review-building tactics.

Create follow-up email sequences that thank customers for their purchase and gently request reviews. Time these emails to arrive after customers have had enough time to use and evaluate your products. The timing varies by product type but typically ranges from one week to one month after delivery.

Respond to all customer reviews, both positive and negative. Thank customers for positive reviews and address concerns raised in negative reviews professionally. Your responses demonstrate that your brand cares about customer satisfaction and takes feedback seriously.

# Managing Negative Reviews

Negative reviews present opportunities to demonstrate your brand's commitment to customer service. How you handle criticism often influences potential customers more than the original complaint. Professional, helpful responses to negative reviews can actually increase customer confidence in your brand.

Contact customers who leave negative reviews privately before responding publicly. Sometimes you can resolve their issues and they may be willing to update their reviews. Even when they don't change their reviews, the private outreach often leads to more positive public responses from you.

Use negative feedback to identify product improvement opportunities. Patterns in complaints reveal areas where your products or service could be enhanced. Addressing these issues proactively prevents future negative reviews and demonstrates continuous improvement to customers.

Never argue with customers in review responses. Maintain a professional tone even when customers are unreasonable or factually incorrect. Other potential customers judge your brand based on how you handle difficult situations.

# Amazon PPC and Brand Visibility

Amazon's advertising platform provides powerful tools for increasing brand visibility and driving sales. Different campaign types serve different purposes in your overall brand-building strategy. Understanding when and how to use each type maximizes your advertising return on investment.

Sponsored Products campaigns work best for individual product promotion and keyword discovery. These ads appear in search results and on product detail pages, capturing customers who are actively searching for products like yours. Start with automatic campaigns to discover which keywords drive the most relevant traffic to your products.

Sponsored Brands campaigns showcase your brand logo, custom headline, and multiple products in a single ad unit. These campaigns work particularly well for driving traffic to your brand store and increasing overall brand awareness. The visual prominence helps establish brand recognition among potential customers.

Sponsored Display campaigns retarget customers who have viewed your products but didn't purchase. These ads can appear on Amazon and on external websites, keeping your brand visible throughout the customer's decision-making process.

# Advanced PPC Strategies for Brand Building

Brand defense campaigns protect your brand name from competitor advertising. Bid on your own brand name keywords to ensure your products appear at the top of search results when customers specifically look for your brand. This prevents competitors from intercepting customers who already know about your brand.

Video ads provide rich storytelling opportunities that static images cannot match. Use video to demonstrate product features, show products in use, and communicate your brand personality. Video ads typically have higher engagement rates and can communicate complex value propositions more effectively.

Dayparting allows you to adjust your bids based on when your target customers are most likely to search and purchase. Analyze your sales data to identify peak shopping times for your products and increase bids during these periods to maximize visibility.

Negative keyword lists prevent your ads from appearing for irrelevant searches. Regular review and optimization of negative keywords improves campaign efficiency by reducing wasted ad spend on clicks that won't convert to sales.

# Creating a Compelling Amazon Brand Store

Your Amazon Brand Store functions as your brand's home base on the platform. This free tool allows Brand Registry participants to create multi-page shopping experiences that showcase their complete product catalog. A well-designed store increases customer engagement and encourages multiple product purchases.

Design your store with a clear navigation structure that makes it easy for customers to find what they're looking for. Group related products together in logical categories. Use descriptive category names that customers would naturally search for rather than internal product codes or technical specifications.

Include brand storytelling elements throughout your store. The homepage should immediately communicate who you are, what you stand for, and why customers should choose your brand over alternatives. Use high-quality images and concise copy that reinforces your brand identity.

Create dedicated pages for different product lines or customer segments. This organization helps customers find relevant products quickly while allowing you to tailor messaging for different audiences. A fitness brand might have separate pages for yoga, running, and strength training products.

# Store Traffic and Engagement Tactics

Use your product listings to drive traffic to your brand store. Include calls-to-action in your A+ Content that encourage customers to explore your full product range. Customers who visit your store are more likely to make additional purchases and become repeat buyers.

Create seasonal or promotional landing pages within your store. These pages can highlight new products, special offers, or seasonal collections. Regular updates keep your store fresh and give returning customers new content to explore.

Analyze your store's performance using Amazon's analytics tools. Track which pages receive the most visits, where customers drop off, and which products generate the most interest. Use this data to optimize your store layout and content for better engagement and sales.

Cross-promote complementary products throughout your store. If you sell coffee makers, promote matching accessories, maintenance products, or coffee beans. This strategy increases average order value and helps customers discover products they might not have found otherwise.

# Inventory Management and Brand Consistency

Maintaining consistent product availability is crucial for brand credibility. Frequent stockouts frustrate customers and can damage your search rankings on Amazon. Develop inventory management systems that prevent stockouts while avoiding excess inventory that ties up your capital.

Use Amazon's inventory performance metrics to identify trends and plan future orders. The Inventory Performance Index (IPI) affects your storage limits and fees. Maintaining a healthy IPI requires balancing sales velocity with inventory levels across your entire product catalog.

Plan for seasonal demand fluctuations in your inventory management. Many products experience predictable seasonal patterns that affect both sales volume and required inventory levels. Historical data from previous years helps predict future demand patterns.

Consider the lead times for your products when planning inventory replenishment. International suppliers often require 30-60 days lead time, while domestic suppliers might need only 1-2 weeks. Factor in potential delays due to holidays, weather, or supply chain disruptions.

# Quality Control and Brand Protection

Implement quality control procedures for all incoming inventory. Random product inspections help identify defects before they reach customers. Catching quality issues early prevents negative reviews and protects your brand reputation.

Monitor your listings regularly for unauthorized changes or hijackers attempting to sell counterfeit versions of your products. Set up alerts for listing modifications and investigate any unauthorized sellers quickly. Brand Registry provides tools to report and remove counterfeit products efficiently.

Create standard operating procedures for handling customer complaints about product quality. Quick resolution of quality issues often turns dissatisfied customers into brand advocates. Document common issues and solutions to train customer service representatives effectively.

Develop relationships with backup suppliers for your key products. Supply chain disruptions can affect any supplier, and having alternatives ensures business continuity. Test backup suppliers with small orders to verify quality and reliability before you need them urgently.

# External Traffic and Brand Building

While Amazon provides significant organic traffic, driving external traffic to your listings can accelerate brand growth and reduce dependence on Amazon's algorithm. External traffic also tends to convert at higher rates because visitors arrive with more specific intent.

Social media platforms offer cost-effective ways to build brand awareness and drive traffic to your Amazon listings. Choose platforms where your target customers spend time rather than trying to maintain a presence everywhere. Focus on creating valuable content that educates and entertains your audience.

Email marketing remains one of the highest ROI channels for e-commerce businesses. Build email lists through lead magnets, contests, and customer follow-up sequences. Use email to announce new products, share valuable content, and drive repeat purchases.

Content marketing helps establish your brand as an authority in your niche while improving search engine visibility. Create blog posts, videos, and guides that address customer questions and problems. This content attracts potential customers who may not have found your products through Amazon search alone.

# Influencer Partnerships and PR

Identify micro-influencers in your niche who have engaged audiences that match your target customers. Micro-influencers often have higher engagement rates and more authentic connections with their followers compared to mega-influencers. Their recommendations carry more weight with potential customers.

Develop long-term relationships with influencers rather than one-off promotional posts. Ongoing partnerships allow influencers to become genuine advocates for your brand. Their continued endorsement builds trust with their audience over time.

Create an affiliate program that rewards influencers and content creators for driving sales to your Amazon listings. Use Amazon's Attribution program to track traffic and conversions from external sources. This data helps you identify which partnerships provide the best return on investment.

Pitch your brand story to relevant media outlets and podcasts in your industry. Earned media coverage provides third-party validation that advertising cannot match. Prepare press releases, product samples, and expert commentary to make it easy for journalists to cover your brand.

# Scaling Your Amazon FBA Brand

Once you've established a solid foundation with your initial products, scaling requires systematic expansion that maintains brand consistency while capturing new market opportunities. Successful scaling balances growth ambitions with operational capabilities and brand integrity.

Analyze your best-selling products to identify expansion opportunities. Look for complementary products that serve the same customer base or address related needs. This approach leverages your existing brand recognition and customer relationships to drive sales of new products.

Consider vertical expansion by offering products at different price points within your existing categories. Premium versions of your popular products can increase profit margins while budget options capture price-sensitive customers. This strategy maximizes market coverage within your niche.

Horizontal expansion into related categories requires careful consideration of brand fit. New categories should make logical sense to your existing customers. A kitchen brand might expand from cookware to small appliances, while a fitness brand could move from equipment to supplements.

# International Expansion Strategies

Amazon's global marketplaces provide opportunities to expand your brand internationally. Start with English-speaking markets like Canada, UK, and Australia where language barriers are minimal. These markets often have similar customer preferences to the US market.

Research cultural differences and local regulations before entering new international markets. Product certifications, labeling requirements, and customer preferences can vary significantly between countries. What works in one market may require modifications for another.

Consider local competition and pricing dynamics in international markets. Your products may face different competitive landscapes and pricing pressures in each country. Adjust your strategies based on local market conditions rather than simply copying your US approach.

Use Amazon's Global Selling tools to manage inventory and fulfillment across multiple countries. The European Fulfillment Network allows you to store inventory in one country and fulfill orders across Europe. This reduces complexity while providing fast delivery to customers.

# Advanced Analytics and Performance Tracking

Data-driven decision making separates successful brands from those that struggle to grow profitably. Amazon provides extensive analytics tools, but successful sellers go beyond basic metrics to understand the deeper patterns that drive business performance.

Track customer lifetime value across your product catalog to identify your most valuable customers and products. This metric helps prioritize marketing spend and product development efforts. Products that attract high-value customers deserve more investment even if their initial conversion rates are lower.

Analyze customer purchase patterns to identify cross-selling and upselling opportunities. Customers who buy certain products together represent opportunities to create bundles or develop complementary products. This analysis also reveals which products serve as effective entry points to your brand.

Monitor your brand's search visibility for key terms using third-party tools that track keyword rankings over time. Understanding your organic search performance helps identify areas where additional optimization or advertising might improve visibility and sales.

# Competitive Intelligence and Market Monitoring

Set up monitoring systems to track competitor pricing, inventory levels, and new product launches. This intelligence helps you respond quickly to market changes and identify opportunities to capture market share. Automated tools can alert you to significant competitor actions.

Analyze competitor reviews to understand their strengths and weaknesses from the customer perspective. Pay attention to common complaints that your products could address better. Positive feedback about competitor features might inspire improvements to your own products.

Track market trends and seasonal patterns that affect your entire category. Understanding broader market dynamics helps you make better inventory and marketing decisions. Some trends affect all brands in a category, while others create opportunities for prepared brands to capture additional market share.

Use Amazon's Brand Analytics to understand how customers discover your products versus competitors. The Search Terms report shows which keywords drive the most sales for your category. This data informs both organic optimization and paid advertising strategies.

# Long-term Brand Sustainability

Building a sustainable Amazon FBA brand requires thinking beyond short-term sales metrics to create lasting competitive advantages. The most successful brands develop multiple moats that protect their market position and enable continued growth.

Customer relationships represent the most valuable asset for long-term sustainability. Brands that create genuine connections with customers can weather algorithm changes, increased competition, and market disruptions better than those that rely solely on tactical advantages.

Continuous product innovation keeps your brand relevant as customer needs evolve and competitors emerge. Establish processes for gathering customer feedback, monitoring market trends, and developing new products that address emerging opportunities. Innovation doesn't always mean completely new products; improvements to existing products can be equally valuable.

Build operational excellence that becomes difficult for competitors to replicate. This might include exclusive supplier relationships, proprietary manufacturing processes, or superior customer service capabilities. Operational advantages often prove more sustainable than marketing tactics.

The Amazon FBA landscape will continue evolving as the platform grows and matures. Successful brands adapt to changes while maintaining their core identity and customer promise. Flexibility in tactics combined with consistency in brand values creates the foundation for long-term success.

Building a strong brand on Amazon FBA requires patience, persistence, and strategic thinking. The tactics outlined in this guide provide a roadmap, but success depends on consistent execution and adaptation to your specific market conditions. Start with the fundamentals, measure your progress, and scale what works while discarding what doesn't.

Your brand is your most valuable business asset. Protect it, nurture it, and let it guide every decision you make. Customers will reward authentic brands that consistently deliver value with loyalty, positive reviews, and word-of-mouth recommendations that no advertising budget can buy.

There's periods where I do it everyday day. I just hope it is not one of those. I really want to stop like I did a while ago. 

During the day I exercised a bit by walking and running. I took myself for a coffee date. Then I ran errands and did laundry. I was still feeling terrible about myself but I keep busy to not do it.

 Finally, the night came and obviously I can't go out because of safety issues. I journaled for a while but I just keep feeling so overwhelmed and useless. I can't do nothing right. So I gave in, nights are the toughest because I'm stuck with my thoughts and myself. I can't physically go anywhere.

1nao2e3,https://www.reddit.com/r/MadTheories/comments/1nao2e3/how_many_calories_should_i_eat_to_lose_weight_a/,How Many Calories Should I Eat to Lose Weight: A Personalized Guide,"Wondering **how many calories should I eat to lose weight**? Finding the right calorie intake is key to shedding pounds safely and sustainably. It‚Äôs not about starving yourself but creating a balanced calorie deficit that works for your body. Let‚Äôs explore how to calculate your calorie needs, share practical tips, debunk myths, and inspire you to start your weight loss journey with confidence.

# Why Calories Matter for Weight Loss

Calories are the energy your body uses for daily functions like breathing, moving, and thinking. To lose weight, you need a calorie deficit‚Äîconsuming fewer calories than you burn. The question **how many calories should I eat to lose weight** depends on your unique factors like age, weight, height, activity level, and goals. Let‚Äôs break it down to find your sweet spot.

# How to Calculate Your Calorie Needs

To answer **how many calories should I eat to lose weight**, follow these steps:

* **Estimate your maintenance calories**: Use the Mifflin-St Jeor equation or an online calculator to find your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), the calories you burn at rest. For example, a 35-year-old, 5‚Äô6‚Äù, 160-pound woman might have a BMR of about 1,400 calories. Multiply by an activity factor (1.2 for sedentary, up to 1.9 for very active) to get your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE), say 1,800-2,200 calories.
* **Create a calorie deficit**: For safe weight loss (1-2 pounds per week), cut 500-750 calories daily from your TDEE. This might mean eating 1,200-1,700 calories daily, depending on your starting point.
* **Personalize it**: Women generally need at least 1,200 calories and men 1,500 to avoid nutrient deficiencies. If you‚Äôre very active or have a higher starting weight, you may need more.
* **Adjust as needed**: Track your weight weekly. If you‚Äôre not losing 1-2 pounds per week, reduce calories slightly (100-200 less) or increase activity.

Not sure where to start? Check out this [helpful resource](http://26.jessicakid.com/) for tools to calculate your calorie needs accurately.

# Practical Tips for Managing Calorie Intake

Once you know **how many calories should I eat to lose weight**, use these strategies to hit your target:

* **Focus on nutrient-dense foods**: Choose vegetables, lean proteins (like chicken or lentils), whole grains, and healthy fats (like avocado). These keep you full on fewer calories.
* **Track your meals**: Use an app or journal to log food for a week to understand portion sizes and stay mindful.
* **Eat smaller, frequent meals**: Spread calories across 3-4 meals or snacks to stabilize hunger and energy levels.
* **Cut liquid calories**: Skip sugary drinks like soda or juice. Opt for water, unsweetened tea, or black coffee to save calories.
* **Plan ahead**: Prep meals or snacks to avoid impulsive eating. Planning helps you stay within your calorie goal.
* **Add movement**: Boost your calorie burn with 30 minutes of daily activity, like walking, cycling, or strength training.

These habits make sticking to your calorie target easier and sustainable for **how many calories should I eat to lose weight**.

# Busting Calorie Myths

There‚Äôs a lot of confusion around **how many calories should I eat to lose weight**. Let‚Äôs debunk some myths:

* **Myth: You need to eat very few calories.** Dropping below 1,200 (women) or 1,500 (men) calories can slow metabolism and cause fatigue. A moderate deficit is safer.
* **Myth: All calories are equal.** A calorie from whole foods (like broccoli) is more filling and nutritious than one from processed snacks (like chips).
* **Myth: You need to count calories forever.** Tracking is a tool to learn portion sizes. Over time, you may estimate intuitively.
* **Myth: Exercise burns enough to ignore diet.** Diet drives weight loss more than exercise. You can‚Äôt outrun a poor diet.
* **Myth: Everyone needs the same calories.** Your needs depend on age, weight, activity, and metabolism. Personalization is key.

Clearing up these myths helps you focus on what works for **how many calories should I eat to lose weight**.

# The Role of Metabolism

Your metabolism is a big factor in **how many calories should I eat to lose weight**. It determines how efficiently you burn calories, and eating protein, staying active, and getting 7-8 hours of sleep can keep it humming. Some explore natural ways to support metabolism, like nutrient-rich foods or checking out a [helpful resource](http://26.jessicakid.com/) for more ideas. Consistency is what drives lasting results.

# Staying Motivated

Answering **how many calories should I eat to lose weight** is as much about mindset as math. Celebrate non-scale victories, like more energy or better-fitting clothes. Connect with friends or an online group for support‚Äîthey‚Äôll cheer you on. Keep your ‚Äúwhy‚Äù in focus: you‚Äôre building a healthier, happier you.

# Your Next Steps

Ready to tackle **how many calories should I eat to lose weight**? Calculate your TDEE, aim for a 500-750 calorie deficit, and try one or two tips‚Äîlike tracking meals or cutting sugary drinks‚Äîfor a week.

Due to the number of DM‚Äôs received and my lack of presence on reddit, I would like to post some helpful information here for those looking to travel there. Hopefully this helps answer some of your travel-related questions! 

What I did: A one day visit to ≈ûanliurfa (known to locals as Urfa)

How I got there: I flew round-trip from Istanbul

Where I stayed: Hotel El-Ruha - chosen for its location. 

My guide‚Äôs Instagram: gobeklitepe_guide_ 
His name is Ibrahim. He is a certified guide and very knowledgeable archaeolgy student. I highly recommend him. 

What I did: 
- Arrived late at night by air to Urfa and caught a taxi to my hotel 
- Early the next morning I visited Balƒ±klƒ±g√∂l (the fish lake) and the mosque where Abraham is said to have been born. Both a short walk from my hotel 
- I visited the ≈ûanliurfa Archeaology and Mosiac museums- both located directly across from my hotel
- In the late morning my guide picked me up and drove me to G√∂bekli Tepe and then Karahan Tepe for a guided visit of each site. I was keen to try some local cuisine so in the evening he took me to a few local places in ≈ûanliura for some specialities before dropping me at the airport for my late flight back to Istanbul. 

A few things to note:
- I visited in March 2024 and the bus from the museum to G√∂bekli Tepe was not operating. This was a blessing in disguise because it led me to finding my guide.
- I do highly recommend having a guide when you visit these places as I learned so much that I would not have known going on my own. I don‚Äôt remember what I paid but it was very reasonable. 
- Karahan Tepe is located another hour by road from G√∂bekli Tepe so unless you hire a car, you will need a guide to take you there. 
- In hindsight I wish I had more time to explore Urfa as it was very rushed and some more time for other historical sites in the area like Mt. Nemrut. I recommend 3 nights, 2 full days minimum. However, if you‚Äôre rushed like me, one full day is possible. 
- As a solo female traveller I felt perfectly safe walking around alone in the area of Urfa where I stayed, and certainly felt very comfortable with my guide. I was approached by one of the very young hotel staff who asked to kiss me while I drank my morning coffee, however he seemed harmless. 
- Small group tour companies like G Adventures have now added G√∂bekli Tepe to their itineraries. If you‚Äôre planning a longer trip around T√ºrkiye, I‚Äôve travelled with this company previously and can highly recommend them also. 

Lastly, if you‚Äôre thinking about it- just do it! G√∂bekli Tepe and Karahan Tepe are amazing and you won‚Äôt regret adding these sites to your visit to T√ºrkiye üáπüá∑

Why Childfree

Don't like children in general. Dn't want to bring a human in this world. Prefer a peaceful, free lifestyle with the right partner instead, in case no partner, solitude is sweeter than having to share space with a kid.
Non drinker, non smoker, vegetarian.


What I'm Looking For- someone who's sweeter than my solitude. Strictly child free. I'm not pro-marriage but that can be discussed in details once we're past the initial introduction. I don't do one night stands, I'm open to long term as well as short term things. Not a fan of LDR, would be willing to give it a try if there's an undeniable connection that warrants exploration.

Yesterday I was visiting my brother and sister-in-law and I felt so incredibly manic the whole time. Like my brain was on fire, thought racing and I couldn't keep up. Everyone felt so SLOW. I couldn't sit still, I felt compelled to move around and dance and spin and rock in my chair. I felt like I had so much energy and nothing to do with it. I was talking so fast the others were struggling to understand. This has been happening on and off the past few days, and it's worse when I'm alone. I don't feel tired even though I don't sleep much. I want to draw, and sing, and scream, and write, and buy all the pretty dresses!!! I have no money though because I've already spent it all on things I don't need, mostly alcohol. 

I didn't drink last night, hadn't had coffee since lunchtime, don't do drugs (yet...). I felt so happy yet so horrible at the same time; I didn't want to be annoying but I couldn't stop myself. Tbh I think I've answered my own question, but I'd still appreciate your thoughts.

Okay, I have to get this off my chest.  
What just happened? Was I literally dreaming?  
Because I just made $100... using only my phone... by TESTING APPS.  

Let me set the scene:  
Yesterday morning, I was doomscrolling as usual, feeling SUPER broke and SUPER skeptical about these ‚Äúquick cash‚Äù stories.

But then I saw someone casually leave a link: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**

I almost scrolled past it. NO WAY it‚Äôd actually work, right?  
But, honestly, desperation hit. I clicked anyway.  

Here‚Äôs the play-by-play on how it went down:

- Signed up using **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (just email & password, super normal)
- Got a dashboard listing a handful of new apps to test
- Downloaded the first one ‚Äî a productivity thing ‚Äî used it for 10 minutes, filled in a little feedback form  
- Moved on to the next: budget tracker (more user-friendly than my bank‚Äôs app, lol)
- Kept going, sharing my thoughts as I went
- By mid-afternoon, my account balance read $87.50 üôâ

Wait, what?!  
WHERE was this money coming from?  
IS THIS REAL?  
Tested one last entertainment app, gave my honest (maybe too honest) review, and refreshed...  


üí° BOOM! $102.70. In. My. Account.  
Never have I felt so‚Ä¶ ‚Äúwhat is life‚Äù in my online hustle career.  

**I got the payout via PayPal the next morning.**  
I almost choked on my coffee.

Some things I realized (and honestly, I‚Äôm still lowkey freaked out):

- The apps were ACTUALLY new, not the usual spammy ones  
- The payout? Real. Tangible. Not ‚Äúcredit‚Äù but COLD CASH  
- Heaps of different app types ‚Äì games, finance, photo editing  
- All just there, waiting, via **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**  

Literally just:

- Sign up (**https://goodnovel.org/testapp**)
- Choose apps that interest you (I picked ones I'd probably use anyway)
- Use it for 5‚Äì10 mins, answer a few questions about your experience
- Rinse, repeat‚Äîwatch the balance actually go up  
- Withdraw with a button click!  

Seriously, I still can‚Äôt believe it.  
My friends thought I was being scammed until I took them through the process (shout out to my homie who is now $50 richer, lol).

Look, I‚Äôve tried A LOT of ‚Äúmake money on your phone‚Äù stuff, and more than half of it was sketch.

But this? **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**?  
On-point.

So, WHY is nobody talking about this already?!  
Why did I have to stumble onto it by pure luck?

Maybe it‚Äôs just new. Maybe people want to gatekeep.  
Either way, I‚Äôm spilling the tea.

If you‚Äôre bored this weekend, want some new apps, and, honestly, don‚Äôt mind a little extra cash, check out **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**

# Q-8: If I leave the company after working for one month, will I get salary?

1nanujr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ItEndsWithLawsuits/comments/1nanujr/blake_lively_is_shy_like_june_hayward_is_shy/,Blake Lively is ‚Äúshy‚Äù like June Hayward is shy,"I spit out my coffee when I read that ostentatiously bedazzled blabbermouth Blake Lively considers herself shy. For cultural context, I asked AI ‚Äúwho is the loudest, most crass, attention seeking female character in literature?‚Äù. It gave me the following gem with eerie similarities to Lively in both character and plotline. Now I simply must read Yellowface‚Äîsomething Lively never bothered to do with It Ends With Us.

Per AI:

Determining the ""loudest, most crass, attention-seeking female character"" in literature is subjective and open to interpretation, but many readers would point to June Hayward from R.F. Kuang's Yellowface. Her relentless narcissism, calculated villainy, and deep insecurity drive her to commit heinous acts, making her an exceptionally unlikable character. 

Characteristics that make June Hayward a candidate:

Craves fame at all costs: After her successful friend Athena Liu dies, June steals her unfinished manuscript and publishes it under a racially ambiguous name, Athena's last name. Her pursuit of fame and recognition is so overwhelming that she is willing to deceive, plagiarize, and lie to everyone around her.

Crass and calculated: The book is narrated from June's internal perspective, revealing her crass thoughts and self-justifications. She constantly rationalizes her terrible behavior, making her unlikable but compelling.

Attention-seeking and destructive: June's desperation for the spotlight leads her down a destructive path. She is willing to sacrifice friendships and her integrity for literary success, and her inability to accept failure makes her an intensely frustrating character.

A modern twist on villainy: In a novel about the publishing industry, June's loud and messy brand of villainy is made particularly compelling through her online presence, where she constantly seeks validation and attention. Her need for public approval drives her actions as much as professional success. ",8,1757233435.0,ItEndsWithLawsuits,7,0.9,False

Ever build something awesome but nobody cares? I made a SaaS‚Äîa goal tracker for fitness buffs‚Äîand thought it‚Äôd sell itself. I was spamming X with ‚Äúcrush your goals!‚Äù posts, burning $900 on Facebook ads, and getting zilch. Just me, chugging stale coffee, staring at an empty signup page at 4 AM, feeling like I‚Äôd blown it. Then, one free trick woke my app up.  
  
  
  
**The Boring Pitch Pitfall**    
My app had neat features‚Äîprogress charts, workout logs‚Äîbut my marketing was dull as dishwater. I was yelling about ‚Äúgoal tracking‚Äù without showing why it mattered. No users, just a sinking feeling I‚Äôd wasted months. Honestly, I was ready to ghost my own project.  
  
  
**The Wake-Up Call**    
In a fitness Reddit thread, I asked, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs stopping your gym progress?‚Äù People griped about apps that felt like homework. My pitch wasn‚Äôt connecting to their grind. The trick? Position your app in ***their*** reality‚Äîwhat it is, why it‚Äôs different, why it fits their life.  
  
  
  
**The Game-Changer**    
I rewrote my pitch: ‚ÄúA goal tracker for fitness buffs to log workouts fast and stay motivated.‚Äù Shared it in r/fitness, hitting their pain‚Äîtime-wasting apps. Got 49 signups in days. Takeaways:    
\- ***Feel their pain.*** Use forums to dig into struggles‚ÄîReddit was my goldmine.    
\- ***Position clearly.*** Say what (goal tracker), why special (fast, motivating), why it matters (fits your grind).    
\- ***Stay organized***. Notion saved my feedback chaos.    
  
  
  
 **Why Applisot‚Äôs Here** 

   
This taught me how tough it is to stand out. So, I built [applisot.com](http://applisot.com), an app promotion store to get your mobile apps, web apps, AI agents, and AI apps discovered by the right crowd, driving sales. What‚Äôs your ‚Äúboring pitch‚Äù fail? Spill it below!

Chapter 1

Before committing suicide while holding her daughter's body, Beatrice Lindsey did three things.

First, she sent the autopsy report of her daughter, who died from an infection after kidney donation, to Caden Baldwin. He was at a birthday party for the son of his first love at that time.

Second, Beatrice calmly arranged all the funeral affairs for her daughter. Then, she held her daughter's ashes and slept in the cemetery for a whole night.

Third, Beatrice softly sang ""Happy Birthday"" and threw the ignited divorce agreement in her hand towards the curtain.

At the same time, in the magnificent hall, Caden Baldwin's phone rang.

""Third Master, the villa is on fire.""

The wine glass Caden was holding fell to the ground with a crash, and he turned and left.

He didn't know how he stepped on the gas pedal and rushed to the villa.

Looking at the house engulfed in fierce flames, it felt as if something had pierced his heart.

The curtain fell, revealing Beatrice Lindsey sitting in front of the birthday cake and the urn of her daughter's ashes in her arms.

She smiled at him as if they were meeting for the first time.

""Goodbye. I hate you. If everything could start over...""

In a drunken stupor, Beatrice Lindsey had a wild night with Caden Baldwin, her step‚Äîuncle.

Then, she deliberately switched her morning‚Äîafter pill with folic acid, trying to get pregnant and marry Caden.

He ranted at her for being shameless and using dirty tricks to climb the social ladder.

After they tied the knot, he began to retaliate against her like crazy, not even showing mercy on their daughter.

When Beatrice opened her eyes again, she found herself reborn to the day after their one‚Äînight stand happened.

The first thing she did was burn the 100 love letters she had written for Caden.

Next, she told him that the woman he slept with was Madelynn Bradford, his fianc√©e.

Finally, she took lots of morning‚Äîafter pills, making sure she wouldn't carry his baby.

In the previous life, Beatrice greedily admitted that they had slept, which resulted in eight years of loveless marriage.

Caden had been waiting for Madelynn and hadn't slept with any woman before that, so he hated Beatrice's guts and mistreated her.

But Beatrice just wouldn't give up on this marriage no matter what.

Eight years later, their daughter Stella died on the operating table.

Meanwhile, Caden was celebrating the successful transplant of Stella's kidney to Madelynn's son.

After Stella was cremated, Beatrice set herself on fire with Stella's urn in her arms.

Before she died, she finally realized that she shouldn't hold on to what didn't belong to her.

If there could be a chance to start over again, Beatrice wouldn't want anything to do with Caden.

Under the scorching afternoon sun, the coffee cup fell to the ground, and the shards cut through Beatrice's skin, making her sober right away.

Beatrice opened her eyes, only to find herself kneeling in the center of the hall.

She looked around with confusion, finally realizing that she had been reborn!

Ignoring the astonished gazes of the crowd, she pinched herself in the arm.

Pain swept through her body, and tears instantly welled up in her eyes.

""Why are you crying? You're the one who crossed the line!""

A solemn voice came from the main seat.

Beatrice snapped back to reality and met the displeased gaze of Xander Baldwin.

She immediately lowered her head, appearing as humble as ever, but her body couldn't stop trembling with excitement.

There were light sneers and constant whispers from the crowd.

""So young but so scheming! How dare she drugged Caden and slept with him! Now everyone knows about it. Apparently, she wanted to force Caden to marry her, but now she doesn't dare to admit it. How shameless!""

""She's so brazen. We Baldwins wouldn't stoop so low. Her love diary about her secret crush on Caden is all over the Internet now! Our family paid her university tuition, but look at what she has learned!""

""I told you not to bring just anyone home. This is clearly inviting trouble. I don't know if it's learned or ... inherited.""

With that, a few people cast a sideway glance at Beatrice's mother Monica Garrett, who stood at the end.

Monica paled at their sarcasm. After glancing at Beatrice, she immediately lowered her head. Although she felt humiliated, she dared not talk back.

It was because Beatrice's identity was too special.

Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm 22 and my boyfriend is 21. We‚Äôve been together for over a year now and just celebrated our one year anniversary two months ago. We were about to move in together next week, we even planned to see our new apartment in just two days. We‚Äôve been through a lot together, always there for each other, and I truly love him.

Yesterday, while we were at a coffee shop planning to go see a movie, we were scrolling through my gallery looking at some selfies I hadn‚Äôt sent him. By accident, we came across a screenshot of another guy‚Äôs Instagram profile.

I immediately swore to him that it was a mistake and that I had no intentions of looking at other guys. For context: my Instagram is very private, I don‚Äôt follow guys, models, or anything like that. What actually happened is that I saw this random guy on my Explore page, and for some reason, I screenshotted his profile. Honestly, I don‚Äôt even remember why, I had no plan to revisit it, and I‚Äôd completely forgotten it was there.

But when my boyfriend saw it, he immediately assumed I was cheating. He got up and left the coffee shop, and since then I‚Äôve been trying to explain and reassure him over the phone, but he doesn‚Äôt believe me. On top of that, he‚Äôs now going through every moment we had together and trying to pick out the negative parts, like saying I don‚Äôt find him hot, or asking why I didn‚Äôt compliment his body enough the last time we went to the beach.

For more context: I did break up with him once before, about a year ago, when we had only been together for three months. I was going through a very difficult time and didn‚Äôt want to drag him down with me. But I came back to him in December, explained everything, and since then we‚Äôve been solid.

Now I feel like everything we‚Äôve built is about to collapse because of this one misunderstanding. I love him and I don‚Äôt want to lose him over something that truly wasn‚Äôt what it looked like.

What should I do next? How do I prove my honesty and rebuild his trust?

**TLDR** Boyfriend and I (together 1+ year, about to move in) found a random screenshot of another guy‚Äôs Instagram on my phone. I had no bad intentions, but he thinks I‚Äôm cheating. Now he‚Äôs rethinking our whole relationship and pointing out negatives like me not complimenting him enough. I want advice on how to fix this and rebuild trust.
