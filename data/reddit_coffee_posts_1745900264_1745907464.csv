I walked into school and touched the door handle. Then my teacher gave me some fruit snacks in class and I ate them with my bare hands.

1kagyzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1kagyzs/tifu_by_stealing_kills_from_my_sil_resulting_on/,TIFU By stealing kills from my SIL resulting on ending the relationship with her and my Brother,"So, I‚Äôve talked about this a year ago on AITA. Truth is when I posted that a year had already passed by and it has somehow gotten worse 

For a bit of context, I (M22) and my brother (M24) weren‚Äôt always the closest or nicest brothers to each other, we used to fight all the time and get on each others nerves. But after our parents divorce we eventually matured and actually got really close. We used to use the excuse of ‚Äúdrinking coffee together‚Äù to talk about our day, every night and we both enjoyed and supported each other on everything.

We grew even closer when our father died, we started living together in our own and had to figure out how to live and maintain a house too big for just the both of us, taking care of whatever dad left unfinished, selling the car none of us knew how to drive, arrange new payments and manage the money which relatives sent each month so we could continue studying. It was us against everything but we were together and we managed. I even came out to him first as a trans man and he defended me from everyone who dared making me feel uncomfortable. 

You get the idea, we were dirt and nail pretty much.

By the time our father passed away my brother was dating this girl, let‚Äôs call her Lily(F25) and I absolutely adored her, she was there to support us while we were running around looking for medicine for our dad and she was there to support my brother during his grieving. After a while seeing her in the house was the new normal, she lived with us and helped around too, the ‚Äúcoffee nights‚Äù grew from 2 to 3. We shared our deepest traumas and whatnot, I was sure she was a close friend of mine too. 2 years after dad passed away they got married, I was the ring bearer and even if I thought my brother was maybe a little bit too young to get married I supported their relationship.

They moved out after a while and I went back to my mom‚Äôs. Life happens, I knew it was gonna happen someday although I felt really sad they decided to moved out when I was away on a trip and came back to an empty house I couldn‚Äôt afford alone. But whatever, life goes on.

Now here comes the TIFU. The 3 of us became a bit addicted to league of legends, we played every night over discord with other friends or just the 3 of us and like any other group of gamer idiots we stole kills of each other, just harmless fun I thought. Initially Lily did not play and was off limits of stealing from since she was learning but once she began playing and stealing too I thought she was on and fair to ‚Äúprank‚Äù too. Months went by with no issue I thought we were all having fun since no one complained either.

Then, out of nowhere one night we were playing, after I stole 1 kill from Lily she left the game. I asked if everything was okay and my brother hit me with a ‚Äúlisten dude, I gotta tell you now. YOU are the problem‚Äù I was shocked. He said that Lily felt that I stole kills from her on porpoise, that I had never liked her and that playing with me has become unbearable. I immediately apologise for making her feel like that, that it has never been my intention and that I thought we were all having fun. My brother kinda dismissed me and we played one more round but I felt really worried about everything and left after that.

I cried that night, called my boyfriend because I didn‚Äôt know how to fix it or how could she even get the idea that I didn‚Äôt like her. She was one of my closest friends and I was afraid of being an asshole without noticing. My boyfriend helped me get to a solution, the next day I texted her and told her ‚Äúhey we should chat about yesterday I would like to get things straight so we could understand each other, do you have time?‚Äù. Only to be immediately stunned with a ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even want to see you, if I see your face I‚Äòlo just tell you to fuck off‚Äù and then be bombarded with a bunch of stuff she fund annoying of me, that I didn‚Äôt do the dishes when they invited me over, that I always leave the doors open in their apartment, that I‚Äôm always asking them for money and eating their food without bringing in more. 

Which to be fair, some were true like the door and dishes thing to which I apologised for. While the rest felt like an overreaction since I ASKED if I should bring in something and my brother always told me not to. And the ‚Äúasking for money‚Äù was just a joke between my brother and I in which we said that once the other had a job they should invite the other some burgers or whatever. It was never meant to be serious. 

I told her so and added a ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt you tell me this bothered you? I would‚Äôve stopped‚Äù  and she exploited , absolute crash out. Telling me I‚Äôm so hard to talk too, that I‚Äôm a piece of jealous shit, how I‚Äôm such a leech and they never said anything because they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt like to fight‚Äù. By that point I was mad, how am I supposed to know how they feel about stuff they never ever even hinted of having a problem with?

At some point my brother joined and of course took her side, being defensive and telling me I‚Äôm in the wrong. Which I didn‚Äôt disagree with I was just mad they didn‚Äôt even try to tell me, didn‚Äôt even attempt to have a conversation about and just came and bombarded me with a ton of the pettiest of shit. 

They said stuff, I said stuff, everything went to hell and we ended saying we needed a break from each other. 

I felt horrible about it all, I was so mad of being treated like an animal to whom no one could even talk too. That day I told myself I would now cave and go apologising AGAIN, much less for stuff I didn‚Äôt even know was wrong, stuff I already apologised for. I thought that if my brother loved me as much as I did he would realise and talk to me at some point. 

A year passed and I started doubting if I was in the wrong so I made the post, talked to my friends, talked to strangers, to my therapist and everyone told me ‚Äúhow could you‚Äôve known ? You even apologised immediately‚Äù. And was hurt for so long before realising what a piece of shit of a brother I had. 

It has always been me who HAD to apologise, always me who had to be the bigger person even if I was the youngest. Always me who forgave everything. Them moving out with such a short notice leaving me to figure out what the hell would I do, forgiving him for being unfair with dad‚Äôs inheritance and leaving me with useless furniture while he took the refrigerator, laundry machine and kitchen. I forgave him for all that but they couldn‚Äôt even talk to me about whatever was bothering them.

Now it‚Äôs been almost 3 years and we haven‚Äôt talked to each other since. We only tolerate each other while on family events. 

TL;DR: TIFU by stealing kills from SIL, SIL crashed out about that and a ton of petty shit she never bother to address with me, brother took her side even after I apologised. Stop talking to each other for 3 years and realised what a piece of shit brother I always had.

My wife came to me one afternoon and said I got a call from the dealer, and that the thing she ""order"" was in stock and we needed to go pick it up. I was a little upset, because I didn't need or want anything at the time. When we got to the store I found out it was a Rolex boutique. 

First mistake- I turn down that whole sit down experience. The lady sat us down and asked if we wanted any champagne or coffee. I told her I'm just fine with water. Trying to rush things through. 

Second mistake- After we tried on the watch, I kept telling her, ""I really don't want the watch"" in front of the AD. It was a bi-metal Sub. So the price was $17K. I was pretty shocked/mad. 

Third mistake- After we wrapped everything up, I ended up asking the AD if its one of those self winding automatics watch. I was under the impression that some Rolex are battery powered. 

Again I knew nothing about watches at the time, or how ""special"" it is to get the ""call"". God I bet that AD probably put me on the black list by now. Since then, I've done a lot of research on Rolex and many other watches. ",0,1745906612.0,rolex,2,0.5,False

# Breville Dosing Funnel 2025: Best Option for [Espresso Machine Model] & Is It worth it?

Are you tired of messy coffee grounds scattering across your countertop every time you make espresso with your Breville machine? Do you dream of perfectly consistent espresso shots, free from channeling and uneven extraction? If so, the Breville dosing funnel might just be the solution you've been searching for. In this extensive guide, we'll delve into the world of Breville dosing funnels, exploring their benefits, compatibility with various Breville espresso machines, and helping you decide if this seemingly simple accessory is a worthwhile investment for your home barista setup.

Whether you're a seasoned espresso enthusiast or a beginner just starting your coffee journey with a Breville Barista Express, Barista Pro, or even a Dual Boiler, understanding the role of proper dosing is crucial. A consistent and precise dose of coffee grounds is a foundational pillar for achieving that rich, flavorful espresso you crave. And that's where a breville dosing funnel comes into play.

[[Explore Top Rated breville dosing funnel on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/chefs-knife/?kw=breville dosing funnel)
## why Use a Dosing Funnel with Your Breville? The Benefits Unveiled

Before we dive into the specifics of the Breville dosing funnel and it's compatibility with different models, let's first understand the core advantages of using any dosing funnel in your espresso workflow.*   **Reduced Mess and Waste:** this is perhaps the most promptly noticeable benefit. A dosing funnel acts as a collar that sits atop your portafilter basket, preventing coffee grounds from spilling over the edges during grinding and distribution. No more wasted coffee, less cleanup, and a tidier espresso station! this is especially helpful for users who employ a standalone grinder, instead of a Breville integrated grinder as commonly installed on the Barista Express.

*   **Improved Dose Consistency:** By containing the coffee grounds within the portafilter basket, the Breville coffee dosing funnel helps to create a more uniform and consistent dose. This leads to more repeatable espresso shots.

*   **Easier Tamping:** Even distribution of coffee grounds is essential for proper tamping. The funnel helps to guide the tamping tool, ensuring a level and consistent tamp across the entire puck. This is especially significant if you have a smaller basket on your Breville.

*   **Enhanced Extraction:** Consistent tamping and even distribution improve the overall extraction process, resulting in a more balanced and flavorful espresso shot.Channelling is heavily reduced and extraction is evened out.*   **Streamlined Workflow:** Many find that using a portafilter dosing funnel breville makes the entire espresso-making process more efficient and enjoyable. It's one simple accessory that makes a big difference.

## Breville Dosing Funnel Compatibility: Finding the Right Fit

One of the most critical questions for any Breville owner is: ""Will this dosing funnel fit my machine?"" The good news is that Breville (and third-party manufacturers) offer dosing funnels designed to perfectly fit the specific portafilter sizes used in their various espresso machines.

*   **54mm Dosing Funnels for Breville Machines:** The 54mm portafilter is commonly found on popular Breville models like the Barista Express, Barista Pro, Barista Touch, Bambino, Bambino Plus, Infuser, and Duo-Temp pro. If you own any of these machines, you'll need a dosing funnel specifically designed for a 54mm portafilter. Be sure to check carefully that the funnel has the correct width or if it's magnetic.

*   **58mm Dosing Funnels for breville Machines:** Breville's higher-end machines, such as the Dual Boiler (BES920XL and BES900XL) and the Oracle Touch (BES990BSS1BCA1), typically use a 58mm portafilter. A 58mm dosing funnel will be required to accommodate this larger size.

*   **Global Dosing Funnels:** While less common, some universal dosing funnels may be adjustable to fit both 54mm and 58mm portafilters (with included adapters). These can be a good option if you own multiple Breville machines with different portafilter sizes or anticipate upgrading in the future.

When searching for a breville dosing funnel compatible with your machine, be sure to double-check the product specifications and customer reviews to ensure a proper fit.

## The Official Breville Dosing Funnel vs. 3rd Party Options: A Comparison

Breville offers its own branded dosing funnel, but there are also numerous third-party options available. Let's compare the two.

**Breville Dosing Funnel:**

*   **Pros:**
    *   Guaranteed compatibility with Breville machines.
    *   Often features a magnetic base for secure attachment.
    *   May be available as part of a Breville accessories dosing package.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Can be more expensive than third-party alternatives.
    *   May not offer the same variety of materials or features as some third-party options.

**3rd Party Breville Dosing Funnel:**

*   **Pros:**
    *   Wider range of materials and designs (stainless steel dosing funnel breville being a common one).*   Often more affordable than the official Breville funnel.
    *   Some may offer unique features like adjustable height or anti-static coatings.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Compatibility may not be guaranteed (always check reviews).
    *   Quality can vary considerably between brands.

When choosing between the official Breville funnel and a third-party option, consider your budget, desired features, and the importance of guaranteed compatibility. Reading breville dosing funnel reviews is crucial before making a decision.

## Dosing Funnel Materials: Stainless Steel vs. Other options

Dosing funnels are typically made from stainless steel or plastic. Here's a quick look at the pros and cons of each:

**Stainless Steel:**

*   **Pros:**
    *   Durable and long-lasting
    *   Easy to clean
    *   Food-safe and resistant to odors
    *   Aesthetically pleasing
*   **Cons:**
    *   Can be more expensive than plastic
    *   May conduct heat (depending on the ambient temperature)

**Plastic:**

*   **Pros:**
    *   More affordable
    *   Lightweight
    *   Available in a variety of colors
*   **Cons:**
    *   Less durable than stainless steel
    *   May stain or absorb odors over time
    *   Not always food-safe (ensure it's BPA-free)

Stainless steel dosing funnels are generally considered the premium option, but a high-quality, food-grade plastic funnel can also be a good choice, especially if you're on a budget.

## Dosing funnel Features to Consider

Beyond material, there are a few other features to consider when selecting a breville portafilter dosing funnel:

*   **Magnetic Base:** A magnetic dosing funnel breville can securely attach to your portafilter, preventing it from accidentally falling off during the dosing process. While this is a helpful addition, some users express concern that it can be a ""bit loose"" when locked in.

*   **height:** the height of the funnel will determine how much clearance you have between the top of the funnel and your grinder. Choose a height that allows for easy grinding without the funnel getting in the way.

*   **Anti-Static Coating:** Some funnels feature an anti-static coating that helps to prevent coffee grounds from clinging to the sides. This can be a valuable feature for minimizing mess.*   **Internal lip:** An internal lip or ridge can help to prevent coffee grounds from falling out of the funnel during tamping.

## Where to Buy a Breville Dosing funnel (Online & Offline)

Ready to purchase a breville dosing funnel? Here are some of the most common places to buy one:

*   **Breville Official Website:** The official Breville website is a reliable source for the Breville-branded dosing funnel. However, be sure to compare pricing vs. other re-sellers.

*   **Amazon:** Amazon offers a wide selection of both Breville and third-party dosing funnels, often at competitive prices. Take the time to analyze all the available options: CAFE HOME SHOP 54mm Dosing Funnel often receives great review.

## Alternatives to the Breville Dosing Funnel

while the Breville dosing funnel is a popular option, there are alternatives to consider:

*   **DIY Dosing Funnel:** If you're feeling crafty, you can create your own dosing funnel using simple materials like cardboard or plastic.

*   **Using a Cup or Small Container:** Carefully grind your coffee into a small cup or container and then transfer it to your portafilter.

While these alternatives may be less convenient than using a dedicated dosing funnel, they can be viable options if you're on a tight budget.

## Is a breville Dosing Funnel Worth It? The Final Verdict

So, is a breville dosing funnel worth the investment? For most Breville owners who are serious about improving their espresso workflow and shot consistency, the answer is a resounding yes.

The benefits of reduced mess, improved dose consistency, and easier tamping far outweigh the relatively low cost of the accessory. whether you choose the official Breville dosing funnel or a high-quality third-party option, you'll likely find that it's a valuable addition to your espresso toolkit.

However, the value proposition changes between user types. Are you a beginner espresso drinker trying a breville machine for the first time? A dosing funnel might feel like an unnecessary step and could cause further confusion untill technique improves more broadly. Are you rather,an accessory shopper,actively looking for marginal improvements across different machine facets? A breville precision dosing funnel will likely be exactly what is needed to improve extraction.

Ultimately, the decision is yours. But if you're looking for a simple and effective way to elevate your espresso game with your Breville machine,a dosing funnel is certainly worth considering. Invest in the right breville portafilter accessories, and you will not be disappointed!

ANIMAL:  
I know Morris canonically is represented by the mole, which is super funny and cute, but I do personally associate him with caterpillars...Or worms, or larvae, or slugs, or centipedes...\[I would now say orange cats are on there too\]  
SEASON:  
I know it doesn't snow in his chapter/game, but hey. It gets the point across. Early/mid winter is Morris' season!  
FOOD:  
Ham n cheese sandwich, duh. He orders it constantly at the cafe.  
MOVIE:  
When I first played Morris' game, I remember going ""Oh! He's like a werewolf, or a wereworm?"" So Morris forever is associated with lycanthropy. The MCs plight of turning into a creature and having to accept it while ensuring no one else is hurt fits Morris‚Ä™...Plus, the ending is...Depressing as fuck.  
PLANT:  
Now Morris' flower. Forget Me Not! Here's my summary posted on another blog. NOT countin' specific colors. ""Many meanings and lots of symbolism in lit n art. Generally they represent true love, devotion, memory, and promises. Resilience for how they bloom despite harsh conditions. New beginnings.""‚Ä™ \[Snowdrops are also the other flower I associate with him\]  
COLOR:  
The color palette is one I found on a color palette specific blog I follow on tumblr that I liked so I tossed it in there.‚Ä™  
CAREER:  
Of course, he works as an entry level automechanic...‚Ä™ \[Poet/writer would also count.\]  
PLACE:  
Then finally, his ""place"" which I decided to go with the cafe since I already depicted the park kind of with the bench. SO, yeah, just a cozy cafe with coffee and seasonal menu items. Familiar faces, different decorations in anticipation for the holidays...‚Ä™I could have had it be an open road, too. His ideal ""place"" being the journey ahead of him that he so desperately wants.

--------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to modern living, the barndominium style stands out for its unique combination of rustic charm and contemporary design. Among various color schemes, the white and black palette has become a favorite, offering a striking look that feels both fresh and timeless. Here are some stylish white and black barndominium designs you can consider for your home.

### Striking Exterior Features

The exterior of a barndominium sets the tone for the entire space. A classic white and black facade can highlight architectural elements while providing a clean, modern aesthetic. Here are a few ideas to enhance your exterior:

- **Contrasting Roof:** A black metal roof against white walls makes for a bold statement. This sharp contrast not only draws the eye but also has practical benefits, reflecting sunlight and keeping your home cooler.
- **Large Windows:** Incorporate oversized windows framed in black. They create a sleek look while allowing ample natural light to flood your living space.
- **Textured Siding:** Use a mix of materials, like wood and metal, painted in black and white to add depth. Shiplap siding can look especially stunning when paired with a flat black or white finish.

### Stunning Interior Designs

Inside your barndominium, the white and black theme can continue to create a cohesive flow that‚Äôs visually appealing and stylish.

#### Open Floor Plan

An open floor plan is a hallmark of modern design, and it works beautifully in a barndominium. White walls create an airy feeling and can make spaces feel larger. Here are some ideas to consider:

- **White Walls:** Fresh, white walls serve as a blank canvas. They can enhance the brightness of your home and allow other design elements to stand out.
- **Black Accent Walls:** Add drama with a black accent wall in the living room or bedroom. This adds depth while keeping the overall vibe chic.
- **Minimalist Furniture:** Choose furniture in simple lines and neutral colors. Black leather sofas or white linen chairs can complement your palette beautifully.

#### Stylish Kitchen Ideas

The kitchen is often seen as the heart of a home. Making it stylish yet functional is essential. Here are some sleek design tips:

- **Black Cabinets:** Consider choosing black cabinetry against white walls to create a sophisticated contrast. Matte finishes can offer a modern touch.
- **White Backsplash:** A glossy white subway tile backsplash can brighten up the space. Its reflective surface can enhance light without overwhelming the color scheme.
- **Unique Lighting:** Pendant lights in black or a rustic style can add character. Look for designs that evoke a barn feel, such as metal shades or Edison bulbs.

### Effective Use of Decor

Your decor choices can help tie the white and black barndominium theme together. Below are some tips for chic decor:

- **Artwork:** Black and white photography or abstract art can create stunning focal points. Consider investing in large pieces that resonate with the open space.
- **Textiles:** Soft furnishings in varying textures, like black throw pillows or white blankets, add comfort while maintaining your theme.
- **Plants:** greenery can warm the stark contrast of black and white. Use decorative pots in black or white to keep the aesthetic intact.

### Outdoor Spaces

Don't forget about your outdoor areas! An inviting exterior can enhance your overall living experience. Here are a few considerations:

- **Patio Furniture:** Furniture in black metal or wood can match your home‚Äôs color scheme. Complement it with white cushions for added comfort.
- **Landscaping:** Use a mix of plants and hardscapes that reflect your palette, such as white gravel pathways with black planters.

White and black barndominium designs can seamlessly combine contemporary style with rustic charm, making them a popular choice for modern living. By focusing on contrast and complementary features, you can create a home that resonates with elegance and functionality.

Incorporating High Contrast Elements in Barndominium Interiors
--------------------------------------------------------------

Transforming your barndominium interior with high contrast elements can create a visually striking and stylish living space. With the right mix of black and white, you can achieve a look that feels both modern and timeless. Below are some effective ways to incorporate these high contrast elements into your barndominium.

### Color Palette

Start with a strong color palette. White walls can serve as the perfect backdrop for bold black accents, creating a clean and airy feel. Consider the following:

- **Paint:** Use a crisp white for the main walls, and pair it with black trim or feature walls.
- **Furniture:** Opt for black furniture pieces‚Äîthink sofas, coffee tables, or dining sets‚Äîto pop against the lighter backdrop.
- **Decor:** Add decorative items like throw pillows, rugs, or wall art in various shades of black.

### Lighting Fixtures

Lighting plays a key role in enhancing high contrast elements. Unique lighting fixtures can serve both functional and decorative purposes. Here are a few ideas:

- **Chandeliers:** Choose a bold black chandelier to make a statement above a dining table or entryway.
- **Wall Sconces:** Black wall sconces can highlight artwork or architectural features while adding drama to the space.
- **Table Lamps:** Use table lamps with black bases and white shades to provide balanced lighting and style.

### Textures and Patterns

Adding various textures and patterns can elevate the sophisticated vibe in your barndominium:

- **Fabrics:** Incorporate velvet, linen, or leather in black shades for furniture upholstery or drapery. These materials create depth and warmth.
- **Rugs:** Consider a large area rug with a black and white geometric pattern to anchor the room and add a focal point.
- **Accent Walls:** Try using shiplap, stone, or black wallpaper on an accent wall. This creates a chance to play with materials.

### Kitchen &amp; Bathroom Ideas

In the heart of your home, kitchens and bathrooms can also showcase high contrast features:

- **Counters and Cabinets:** White cabinets paired with black countertops provide an elegant look. Quartz or granite can add durability.
- **Backsplashes:** A black tile backsplash can create a stunning visual effect against your kitchen or bathroom setup.
- **Fixtures:** Choose matte black faucets, light fixtures, and handles for a unified appearance in both spaces.

### Art and Accessories

Art can serve as a key element to tie the high contrast theme together. Here‚Äôs how to use art and accessories:

- **Wall Art:** Select black and white photographs or abstract paintings to add depth and intrigue to your space.
- **Sculptural Elements:** Incorporate sculptures or decorative pieces in black or white to elevate simple surfaces.
- **Plants:** Use white planter pots for green plants to create a lively contrast against the darker elements.

### Flooring Choices

Consider your flooring options carefully. Black and white flooring designs can make a bold statement:

- **Tiles:** Use black and white tiles in checkerboard patterns for a classic vintage feel.
- **Wood:** Stained black wooden floors maintain warmth while adding elegance.
- **Area Rugs:** Layering a large area rug in a contrasting color can help define separate spaces within an open layout.

High contrast elements in your barndominium interior can create a unique and sophisticated environment. From color palettes and lighting to textures and flooring, each aspect has the potential to elevate your living space with thoughtful design. By using these ideas, you can seamlessly blend style and practicality, resulting in a beautiful barndominium that reflects your personal taste and lifestyle.

### Conclusion

A white and black barndominium offers a unique blend of style and functionality that perfectly suits modern living. These designs not only present a visually striking exterior but also create a welcoming interior that emphasizes spaciousness and warmth. By mixing high contrast elements, you can elevate the overall ambiance of your barndominium, making it both chic and comfortable.

High contrast features into your interiors can breathe life into the space. For example, pairing dark wood accents with sleek white appliances creates a stunning focal point in the kitchen. Similarly, contrasting textures‚Äîlike plush fabrics against smooth surfaces‚Äîadd depth and interest to your living spaces.

Moreover, the use of strategic lighting can enhance these contrasts, drawing attention to the beauty of your decor. From statement lighting fixtures to clever use of natural light, the right illumination helps highlight the design elements that make your barndominium uniquely yours.

Regardless of your personal style or preferences, white and black barndominium ideas encourage creativity. Embracing this color scheme enables you to play with different textures, materials, and layout designs, resulting in a space that reflects your personality.

Ultimately, whether you are building your dream home or transforming an existing structure, the high contrast of a white and black barndominium can bring together elegance and functionality. Celebrate the simplicity and sophistication these designs offer, and enjoy crafting a space that feels both modern and timeless.",1,1745905356.0,BarndosAndCabins,0,1.0,False

I was trying to get out of the lazy slump of sleeplessness by actually waking up early to go to the gym. I drank a small cup of coffee with a small boost of caffeine.

I'm regretting it. I have taken two magnesium gummies, one 5mg melatonin gummy, and half of a Xanax (my last resort) and my brain still wont shut off. I could literally feel all of the above working and making me extremely drowsy. But I just could not stop thinking. Everything was too loud, the lights outside the window were too bright, I can't get comfortable. Every song I listened to at the gym today is endlessly repeating in my head. 

I can't even block the lights or stop the noises. I'm in a temporary living arrangement that has been sending my insomnia into overdrive. I'm sharing a small mattress with family.

I have an app installed that locks my phone for a set time to prevent use. I set it for 3 hours hoping it would help me fall asleep. It never came. My phone is in greyscale, eye protection filters active, notifications turned off.

that's very little time lewis knows murphy.

then later on when murphy comes back as robocop she sees robocop at the gun range testing out his auto pistol.  robocop does the gun twirl before holstering.  lewis looks intrigued.

help me understand the logic, folks who don‚Äôt tip their baristas. I am absolutely positive that you guys tip your bartenders when you go out to bars, but how is coffee any different?

think about it; you go to the coffee shop and you order the simplest thing, a drip coffee/cold brew. the barista walks over to the machine/jug, and pours you a coffee. you may think, oh all they did was pour some liquid in a cup, I don‚Äôt need to tip. but when it‚Äôs a bartender pouring you a beer or shot, you throw down a dollar or two.

let‚Äôs say you get something more complicated, let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs a hot large latte with almond milk and vanilla. the barista pulls you a properly dosed and dialed shot of specialty espresso, and then steams to perfection your milk of choice, and on top of that draws a literal picture with that milk that makes you literally say out loud: ‚Äúwow that is beautiful‚Äù; you could argue there is more that goes into that drink than the rum and coke your bartender pours you that you tip on.

so help me understand- when the tip screen is in front of you, why do you press no tip so confidently when if it was your bartender you‚Äôd would be? genuinely asking

Tomorow i will have my brand new Oracle Jet, i come from Bambino Plus (associate to the Commandante C40 manual grinder) and i feel that now it's time to upgrade with things that fill better my needs.

  
I'm used to store my beans in a vaccuum container and i drink 5 to 8 espresso a week. I like to open a bag and dont change it till it's finished (i prefer that in order to continu on the same dial in recipe (same parameter)). I use a double shoot basket with 20gr of coffee, meaning 100 to 160gr of beans a week.

  
Now I've seen some good things on the OJet like a seal on the hopper and also a smoke plastic. Both help to keep beans with less air contact and less light contact wich is good.

  
But now I mind if i can store a 250gr bag for 2 weeks in the Ojet hopper without any (or big) downgrade of my beans ? If Two weeks seem two much is one week manageble ?

  
Is someone allready try ?

So me (24F) and my boyfriend (23M) are moving in together but we have completely different tastes in how to decorate the apartment.

We‚Äôre trying to buy mostly all new decor because our tastes are so different but we can‚Äôt agree on anything. My current apartment is very very girly and everything is pink. Even my kitchen things are pink. 

His room doesn‚Äôt really have a theme and is basically just a lot of boy stuff. We really want the apartment to feel homey to both of us so we talked about what is important to us for decor and found things that are in common. Basically, I want it to be bright and lighter colors, but he wants more neutral tones so we decided to go with light green, tan, and cream colors. A lot of earthy tones, but like they are still light colors and don‚Äôt make the room look dark. 

The issue is that there are a few things that we both want to bring that we are disagreeing on. I want to bring my kitchen things, because I don‚Äôt want to spend extra money on coffee makers, pots and pans, etc when mine are only a year old and in great condition. He is against it because he said he doesn‚Äôt want a ‚Äúgirly cute apartment‚Äù. I understand his point, but I dont think it makes sense to buy extra things that we don‚Äôt really need. 

Since I am bringing my kitchen things, he wants to put these huge tapestries up in the living room, which will take up ALL of the wall space in the living room. They‚Äôre both very frat house looking tapestries and they don‚Äôt match any of the theming that we decided on. Most of the pink kitchen things I have are going to be in a cabinet until we need to use it, so I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs comparable at all. 

He‚Äôs already bringing a lot of his stuff to display in the living room, like legos and funko pops that I don‚Äôt necessarily want in the living room, but I agreed to it bc I want him to be happy and feel at home too. I am bringing basically nothing because I know my things are too ‚Äúgirly‚Äù and he wouldn‚Äôt like it. 

It‚Äôs turning into a huge fight because we just cannot get past the tapestries and kitchen things.",1,1745903584.0,HomeDecorating,2,1.0,False

We met August 2023 and quickly started dating ‚Äî I even happened to meet his parents on our first date. It‚Äôs kind of cute and funny. It was the best first date ever: waterfall swimming, coffee, adventure, followed by an evening at his home sauna with ice cream. The date lasted about eight hours. He showed interest in being serious. He was very respectful ‚Äî so much so that I even thought maybe he was gay at first because he barely made any physical moves until I took initiative.

By Thanksgiving ‚Äî which I hosted for my friends ‚Äî he helped organize it, and we said our ""I love yous."" The relationship seemed perfect. I opened up about everything from my past, and so did he.

The only hiccup was when he said he was going out with friends, invited me, and on the car ride told me we were actually meeting his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend, along with another guy. It was his first ever girlfriend from when they were both 16 ‚Äî first everything, including intimacy. Let‚Äôs call her Gabriella.

I was not okay with it. Even though they were just friends, I thought it was weird, especially since I didn‚Äôt get a heads-up. Gabriella‚Äôs boyfriend also seemed uncomfortable. I had a huge issue with it ‚Äî trust felt broken. I thought about ending it. We talked it through, and I decided to stay.

We started talking about marriage ‚Äî **he** brought it up ‚Äî and about having kids and timelines. He didn‚Äôt want to wait.

Then he went to see his grandmother in Europe for over a month ‚Äî all through Christmas and New Year's. I stayed home but went on a mini trip with friends closer to home. It was tough being alone. I missed him.

When he came back, his tone had changed. He didn‚Äôt seem to want to rush into marriage anymore. I came to the same conclusion, but it still felt hurtful hearing it from him. He seemed cold. I also didn‚Äôt like that he made the decision without even talking to me. But over time, things seemed to get better.

In February, we went to an event where we ran into another one of his exes. She was very uncomfortably friendly ‚Äî trying to dance with me, complimenting us a lot. Weirdly, it helped a bit, but it also sparked more problems for me regarding his exes.

We were planning to travel that summer. I wanted to go to Europe, and he initially agreed but then backed out, saying he needed to spend time with his grandmother. He insisted he couldn‚Äôt spend less than three weeks helping her in his village. He also HAD to be there for his friend‚Äôs birthday (which later turned out to not even be the correct date ‚Äî he had mixed it up).

Basically, he was set on HIS trip and wouldn‚Äôt budge. I planned everything to try and make it work, but still, no. Eventually, we decided to go to his homeland for the entire month. He promised that next time, we would go to Europe. It worked out because my brother ended up getting married there too.

(For the record: I paid for my own tickets and everything else.)

The compromise was to go to another city (pretty far from his village) for a bit ‚Äî but every day was a fight and struggle just to get that to happen. We went, and it was so much fun! But we also fought quite a bit.

During the trip, I found out he was messaging basically all his exes or still had contact with many of them ‚Äî Gabriella, and another girl he had casually hooked up with back home. He followed all his exes on social media, and they would like/comment on each other's posts.

I hated it. It put me in a bad mood. He was also very moody about anything I wanted. Basically, he counted down the days until he could be with his grandmother. It was hard. Whenever he was tired, he‚Äôd get angry, pissy, and treat me like everything was my fault.

He was going to propose during the trip, but it never worked out. There were good moments ‚Äî I tried to keep the mood good ‚Äî but I got tired too.

When we came back, his parents suggested we go camping across the country. We booked it.

We got into a big fight because I was done with his messaging other girls. Also, he wouldn‚Äôt text me first, wouldn‚Äôt ask me on dates, wouldn't come see me ‚Äî I‚Äôd see him once a week or less, and he didn‚Äôt seem to care. But he had no problem going to play video games with his buddy.

I told him to come back and talk with me ‚Äî he said it wasn‚Äôt urgent and he'd see me tomorrow. That night, I told him I was breaking up with him.

The next day, he showed up apologizing, not accepting the breakup. He talked me into going on the trip.

The drive was two days ‚Äî absolute hell. He complained about driving constantly. It was horrible ‚Äî constant fighting.

We finally got there. I wanted to end things. I was done. The trip felt ruined ‚Äî another one wasted.

He ended up taking me out on a date during the trip ‚Äî showing me around ‚Äî and then, on the beach, he asked me to marry him.

I don't know why I said yes.

We had bad times ‚Äî really bad ones ‚Äî but also really good ones. We drove home the next day. The mood was off, but I tried my best to act excited and happy.

He still complained about driving ‚Äî just not as much. He didn‚Äôt even want to tell his parents we were engaged at first, saying they'd get ‚Äútoo excited.‚Äù I insisted we call them.

I started telling my family and friends. His family was kind to me. Everyone seemed happy.

For the next two months, things were pretty good ‚Äî no fighting.

Then, his parents started getting heavily involved. His mom found a venue and started pushing hard for it. I didn‚Äôt like it, but we went to see it anyway. It was cheap but needed a LOT of work ‚Äî which would have cost just as much as another nicer venue. He didn‚Äôt agree. We fought about it.

From the beginning, all I ever wanted was to elope. He said it was about making his parents happy ‚Äî that‚Äôs what the wedding was for.

My parents were chill about it.

His mom pushed hard against my plan for a two-year engagement. She even got my parents on board with rushing the wedding. Every day started to feel like hell, and eventually, I gave in.

We agreed on a June wedding. (They wanted winter or May, but that was too fast.)

I did ALL the research, found a venue that fit his outdoorsy vibe and budget. It was slightly over budget but still dirt cheap compared to the wedding market.

Then started the fight over guest counts.

We had another fight about the exes ‚Äî he helped Gabriella‚Äôs parents again, more secret contact without telling me. I was so done. He promised there would be no more.

He didn‚Äôt seem to understand why it was a big deal. He even joked that if it weren‚Äôt for me, Gabriella would have been his ""groomsgirl.""

We made up.

Then, he decided that his parents would have free range over the guest list ‚Äî like, literally not even giving me names or telling me who the people were. No limit.

I pleaded for 50 people total ‚Äî to keep costs down and because I don‚Äôt like strangers. He refused. He wanted a big wedding.

We agreed on 70 total guests ‚Äî even split. Then he went back on that agreement, letting his mother invite 60 people from their side alone.

Slowly, every time, the guest list grew.

He didn‚Äôt care what I wanted. I was always the bad guy. No compromise. I was planning everything.

His mother started stepping over boundaries ‚Äî agreeing with a baker for our cake without letting us know, buying me shoes and dresses she liked (they were hideous).

Once, I sent her pictures of wedding dresses I tried on, and she told me I looked like a ‚Äúmiddle-aged divorc√©e‚Äù and should look for cheap dresses on Shein or AliExpress.

I cried.

He talked to her, but it wasn‚Äôt particularly helpful.

(For context: I was paying for my dress.)

The only cost concerns they had were about things **I** wanted.

The guest count HAD to include everyone they wanted.

It was little things every other day ‚Äî traditions forced onto us. Whenever I disagreed, I was the bad guy.

I asked him to stand up to her ‚Äî but his stance was that the wedding is ‚Äúfor the parents.‚Äù

Meanwhile, I was still in university, planning the entire wedding, paying for half (if not more), and getting zero help ‚Äî just criticism.

Months of this.

Every now and then, we fought about how he was ignoring me, not knowing anything about the wedding, and accusing me of ""demanding expensive stuff"" ‚Äî even though I was doing DIY and keeping everything cheap.

Then we fought again about when to have kids. He wanted kids one year after the wedding.

I wanted to finish university (5th year), get a year of work experience, and have financial stability ‚Äî not be living in his parents' house.

He said he‚Äôs ‚Äúthe man‚Äù and I am ‚Äúnot his equal‚Äù ‚Äî so he gets to make decisions and I have to respect them.

He doesn‚Äôt make much money because he's self-employed and hates office jobs.

I want stability. I want to feel secure.

We had a huge fight. His parents got involved.

I got drunk and told them everything ‚Äî about how I was planning everything, paying for half, getting no support, while he went to play video games.

I said he didn‚Äôt love me ‚Äî and that‚Äôs okay ‚Äî we could part ways.

The next day, he was first mad that I said bad things about him (I‚Äôm not proud of that, but they were facts ‚Äî not insults), then he apologized and promised to change.

For three weeks, he was an amazing boyfriend.

He didn‚Äôt block me out when I cried. He cared about the wedding. He let me know when he‚Äôd be late. He showed affection I had never seen before.

But I felt emotionally dead.

It hurt seeing him finally do the things I had begged for, for months.

Even now, he thinks nothing changed ‚Äî that he‚Äôs ‚Äúalways been like this.‚Äù

But I'm again begging for basic things.

I ask about when he‚Äôs going to start building the house extension (so we could have space), and I‚Äôm met with groans ‚Äî like I‚Äôm a warden, not a partner.

He still complains.

It‚Äôs a month before the wedding.

I have cried every day for the past month. I feel miserable.

I don‚Äôt think I love him anymore.

Even in the good moments, I feel numb. I resent him.

Now, even when he does nice things, I can‚Äôt appreciate them.

I don‚Äôt know what to do.

So many people are invited. It‚Äôs so embarrassing to walk away now.

I tried talking to him ‚Äî about how I don‚Äôt like living with his parents, about how negative and pissy they are, how I don‚Äôt even have space for my stuff in his room ‚Äî but nothing changes.

He‚Äôs only nice when he sees I might actually leave.

I'm scared. I'm lost. Help me understand this situation, please. ",1,1745903472.0,relationship_advice,4,0.99,False

1kafydk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gifted/comments/1kafydk/friend_said_i_was_autistic/,Friend said I was autistic,"I have been friends with my college roommate for 19 years. We don't live in the same state, but we catch up when I'm in town or over the phone.

She's a therapist. Sometimes I'll talk to her more openly about childhood experiences or parent stuff, since that is the sort of stuff she is interested in. I don't use her as a therapist. We both use each other to vent sometimes.

I've been open about the fact that I had a hard time socializing as a kid. I didn't like kids en masse. I always had too much going on in my head. I was really curious and creative in my own little world.

My mom decided to homeschool me after kindergarten so that I could just do my thing instead of getting squashed. So I kinda grew up in the woods alone with a brother and a handful of friends I rarely saw (my mom made no effort to help me socialize).

So college was a lot. I was pretty shut down the whole time. It was loud. There were too many people. I started out in a tiny dorm room with three roommates (including the friend in question).

I was a 3.988 GPA student with a music scholarship, a theater scholarship, a spot in the honors program, and never fewer than two on-campus jobs. I didn't have mental space for anyone, so I didn't have any friends.

After college, I realized I could circle back to people I thought were interesting in college and be friends with them now--in a one-on-one setting, away from the insanity of a busy campus. I realized I actually liked other people once I figured out I could just take them to coffee and then go home where it's quiet. 

So I started building relationships, and that's why I am still friends with my college roommate. I found people I liked, and I invested in those relationships.

In my 20s, I sometimes said blunt things because I grew up really alone and missed out on high school interactions. I essentially missed the practice rounds. I don't really do that anymore.

I have a good bunch of friends where I live now, and I have never had an issue reading people. It's kind of the opposite--I am way, way too good at figuring out what is going on in people's heads. I am an editor, and I've been told that I read minds. I get the writing of the worst writers at my company, and I can very easily deduce what they meant to say and rewrite it.

Anyway, I called my friend to vent last week because work sent me to a leadership training, and I wasn't doing well. I was trying to pick up how to do ""management speak"" for the first time, and it felt super unnatural and overwhelming.

And this was the moment that she decided to tell me she thought I was autistic. The fact that I was struggling with the super fake, forced dialogue exercises at the training apparently gave her an opening to drop that on me.

We've been friends for a long time, but I don't know that I will get past this.

For one, I didn't tell her about stuff from my past so that she could give me an armchair diagnosis. 

For two, she's not my therapist, and I have always asked her permission before venturing into any territory that might cross a line with her (meaning I have made sure to never treat her as a therapist instead of a friend). 

For three, she's just wrong. I had no developmental issues. It's very obvious to me that I experienced problems that are common to highly intelligent kids. Being uncommonly perceptive and good with language did not help me socialize with other 12 year olds, but it did mean I could read Paradise Lost when I was 12.

So, I am disappointed that I have been misunderstood and categorized by someone I trusted. I think this friendship might be over. I wouldn't be comfortable continuing to engage with someone who pathologized me to my face. 

Would appreciate advice on how to proceed.

Pretty much have always been super lazy and a couple weeks ago I had enough. Now pretty much what helped me become more productive was a schedule/planner. Now I‚Äôve tried planners before but only through apps and that would only lead me to getting distracted. So I resorted to printing myself an actual schedule in 30 minute time increments. 

Now I know what tasks I want to get done during the day. Things like: 
- Go for a walk/run 
- Study 
- Go to sleep early/wake up early 
- Read a book
Etc. 

My intention for the most part was to do things that would get me to spend less time on my phone because of how distracting it is. And what helped me is making the tasks you want to actually get done during the day as convenient as possible. Since I‚Äôm not a morning person, I make sure to do my runs/walks right after sunset as its about an hour before my bedtime and it would make me feel tired which in turn would make me fall asleep faster. Usually people read before time but I read as soon as I wake up because personally thats more convenient for me. 

Also another thing I want to mention which I think is really important is having your schedule as packed as possible. Of course there‚Äôs nothing wrong with having a break but personally I try to never make my breaks longer than 15 minutes because that will only lead me to getting distracted from the things I should be doing. Also don‚Äôt make your schedule packed with a bunch of unnecessary tasks. Focus on a couple tasks you really want to persistent in. The more tasks you have the more discouraging it will feel and the more stressed it will become for you. The biggest game changer for me lately has really all come down to fixing my sleep schedule and what has helped me achieve that is charging my phone outside my room and adopting this new rule of ‚ÄúNo phones allowed in the bedroom‚Äù. Also putting my phone on grayscale mode has helped me tons. Last thing I want to mention is your diet also plays a role in your productivity. Make sure you don‚Äôt eat a lot (portions matter) and make sure that what you eat is healthy as it does have an effect on the way you feel throughout the day. I personally suggest to cut out late night meals. I also cut out breakfast some days depending on my energy and mood. Some days I do better without eating breakfast and some days I don‚Äôt. Also tea > coffee any day. If there‚Äôs any tips that‚Äôs worked for you, lemme know. I‚Äôm more than happy to hear what has worked for you. ",1,1745902351.0,productivity,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôll start from the beginning, I (24 f) live alone. I‚Äôve never been in a relationship before, but I think I might be in one‚Ä¶ without even knowing it. Last Saturday, I was scrolling through Reddit, specifically the AITAH subreddit, and I came across a post. The title seemed innocent enough, so I figured I‚Äôd read it and maybe give my two cents. That was until I actually read it, because I genuinely think the post is about me. I know that sounds presumptive since it could be about anyone, but the details are eerily specific, and they describe me exactly.

The post was from a guy asking if he would be the AH for throwing out his girlfriend‚Äôs clothes because he couldn‚Äôt stand her messiness anymore. But here‚Äôs where it gets unsettling he mentions a bunch of habits she has that bother him, habits that didn‚Äôt used to, but now do. These habits included leaving half drunk coffee mugs around the house in the morning, singing loudly while cooking lunch, and watching old cartoons in the evening while eating cereal straight from the box. Those are exactly the things I do, at those exact times of day. Then, he says she loves to listen to a band called Reider Days and her favourite song is ‚Äúactive directions‚Äùand guess what? I also love that same band, and active directions is literally my favorite song.

At first, I thought maybe it was just a creepy coincidence. But then I got to this part ‚ÄúShe acts like such a slob, it makes it hard for me to share her things like her toothbrush.‚ÄùI didn‚Äôt even give it a second thought at first until someone in the comments responded, ‚ÄúWait, you use her toothbrush? Why not buy your own?‚Äù And he replied, ‚ÄúI have my own, but sometimes I forget to bring it when I go over.

I feel like this is a safe space for a story like this since I am not comfortable talking about it sa mga friends ko. So I‚Äôve been single for 2 years and I don‚Äôt want to enter a serious relationship kaya nag hanap ako ng taong casual dating lang din ang hanap. So I installed bumble and I met a guy that is just 4km away from me. He said he was just looking for a fun and casual dating and ganon din ako so we both agreed to do this casual dating kahit ako zero idea ako about sa kung ano ba ang casual dating. So I researched about it and basically it was just a landian without commitment. 2 days pa lang kami magkausap we both agreed to have dinner and coffee since magkalapit lang naman kami. Nung nasa coffee shop na kami that‚Äôs when we talk about our past relationships, his work and my studies, everything na pwede namin mashare sa isa‚Äôt isa. He‚Äôs a good listener which a plus plus points for me. After coffee, we f*cked. And that was the best s*x I ever had, even my ex couldn‚Äôt make me moan as load as this guy did.

After that night nasundan pa yon ng nasundan since it‚Äôs very convenient for us to meet kasi magkalapit lang. Hatid sundo ako gamit car niya and may mga time pa na tumatakas ako just so I could meet him. We were not just f*ucking, we also share deep secrets, we sing together with his favorite taylor song, and giving me theories about universe. He‚Äôs smart, sweet, kind, and he‚Äôs the type of guy that I would probably date. Sobrang okay namin and masasabi kong perfect match. To the point na pag sinabi nyang take na namin to in another level papayag ako. That lasted for almost a month lang kasi nag bakasyon kami sa baguio while siya naman is nagkaron ng work sa pangasinan for 1 week. So we both got busy and hindi na nagkausap. Hanggang makabalik na siya ng city namin wala na ko narinig from him. Until one day nakita kong he unfollowed me on both of my socials. I got very sad and it‚Äôs been a few months since nung huli ko siyang nakausap. I thought pag tumagal makakalimutan ko din siya and mas makakapag focus ako sa sarili ko. But I was wrong. I‚Äôm missing him even more and minsan umaasa akong may marinig pa from him. Tinatry kong kumalimot sa pamamagitan ng pag bubumble again hoping that another guy will help me forget him but I know it‚Äôs a bad idea.

I wore trousers and a nice shirt out to a coffee shop that I go regularly (it‚Äôs very hot in there no air con only fans that the owner turns off to save money on electricity). Owner is almost always there and she takes up the best seat where I used to love to sit but it‚Äôs ok  I will sit elsewhere now. Anyways she comes up and says  ‚Äùoh that‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve seen you wear pants‚Ä¶‚Äù it just made me feel take aback I didn‚Äôt know what to say so I said ‚Äúoh yes I just went out to eat at a nice restaurant and had to come here after to my fave coffee shop!‚Äù That seemed to go down ok‚Ä¶ But maybe I should have not said ‚Äúcoffee‚Äù as it‚Äôs more than a coffee shop really‚Ä¶
And I never order coffee I just didn‚Äôt know how else to describe it (maybe cafe or restaurant).

I usually wear nice shorts but they are kinda short I guess but I like them and it‚Äôs very hot so makes sense‚Ä¶ but the way she said it made me feel like she didn‚Äôt approve of my normal outfit choice‚Ä¶

After I said that she went to the computer and printed something out then stuck it in a jar‚Ä¶Then I noticed she added a new tip jar with a note stuck across it saying‚Äù ‚Äúmake sure you tip those who prepare YOUR coffee‚Äù. This was 15mins before closing and I was the only one there before the owner then left‚Ä¶

The whole thing made me feel uneasy to be honest as the prices are extremely expensive at this coffee shop I was the only one in the coffee shop actually‚Ä¶. Being from the Uk and this not being in America I think tipping is ok for really good service but the service here is not the best I go as it‚Äôs quiet usually‚Ä¶. For instance today I asked for tea as my drink and it arrived only one quarter full literally I had to ask please can you fill the cup. I also asked for a glass of water which they forgot to bring to me again. And then I ordered the main thing which was VERY overpriced. anyhoo it just made me feel kinda like I didn‚Äôt I just go in wearing headphones so I could avoid feeling uncomfortable‚Ä¶. Ahhhh first my outfit was kinda mentioned awkwardly as I was trying to walk in without talking and enjoy some peace then the feeling like me not tipping enough was also made very obvious by the use of the word coffee again when maybe I should not have described it as only a coffee shop as it does lots of other things too - I was trying to be nice by saying it‚Äôs my fave coffee shop. But her saying coffee in the tip jar when I don‚Äôt actually ever drink coffee ahhhhh so she also wants me to tip more and dress differently it just made me not feel welcome‚Ä¶.

Being person can be so political like saying the right things and tipping to not cause offense but I would rather say how I feel and tip according to good service and I think it‚Äôs the owners responsibility to ensure staff are paid enough‚Ä¶ also I wonder if she was implying I should come to the coffee shop dressed up more (if so maybe she could turn on the fans or have AC?)

I was very private even before this, and we share an office with people I don‚Äôt work with or am close with. My direct coworkers who know me well know not to ask me that unless, in deep morbid humor, only they are allowed to because, in our own way, it is comforting to me if that makes any strange sense. 

The other office knows what happened and plans on attending my son‚Äôs memorial. Most of them, but one can read the room and take my nonverbal head nod as the sign to leave me alone. But my gosh, one, who, of course, is the proud church-going type but speaks nothing but negativity and thinks casual insulting words are fine and anyone upset is part of a weakening society.  She is also a single, only-child mother, and our kids are or were the same age. She seems to think she can push my boundaries since we have that in common.  After very visibly not wanting to chit-chat, she just kept on asking about my weekend and would not or chose not to read my social cues. I finally said, ‚ÄúListen, it is not personal, but I don‚Äôt want to talk. it takes all my strength to be here, and I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù I got the cliche; I understand.

With every ounce of mental strength, I uploaded ‚Äúfamily pictures‚Äù of those who my son and I had little contact with and didn‚Äôt help us when I was screaming from the mountain tops, ‚ÄúHelp, I can‚Äôt do this alone, where is our village ‚Äù as he fell deeper into depression and addiction.

I  cried, I‚Äôm afraid to go for a walk because the neighborhood is still talking about his suicide online, I hear. I was told all the discussion boards were removed. 

But my gosh, my point is, why is there only for me, ‚Äúthat one person‚Äù who can‚Äôt read social cues and pushes my boundaries as I try to put creamer in my coffee? The sad truth is I know it could be much worse, and it might end up being so.

Here are my thoughts...," The only fully functioning vegan restaurant (not just vegetarian) in Trivandrum district as of late April/early May 2025 is Lumuma, located in Varkala. The other vegan restaurants in the district‚ÄîSoul Bistro‚Äîclosed around two weeks ago, and Cyra Caf√© hasn‚Äôt been open on any of the days I visited.

Here are my thoughts:

Lumuma is part of a resort and is situated in the northern cliff area (Thiruvambadi Lane) in Varkala. It‚Äôs definitely on the pricier side, primarily targeting foreign tourists. However, the menu was surprisingly extensive. It includes a wide variety of plant-based dishes, such as vegan ice creams, cakes, mock meat, and different types of plant-based coffees and teas. I had dinner there on a Saturday.

I ordered the Lumuma special pizza, and it was really good: a 12-inch ragi-based pizza priced at around ‚Çπ400+tax, topped with vegan cheese and a variety of ingredients. For reference, it tasted better than pizzas from typical chains like Domino‚Äôs or Pizza Hut, though not quite at the level of premium restaurants. I also tried the Tempeh sticks as a starter, which were decent, but the accompanying dips were superb.

Up to that point, the experience was just okay, but I was completely blown away by their plant-based vanilla ice cream. This was unlike anything I‚Äôve tasted before. The same goes for their masala chai.

That brings me to a broader question: Why aren't vegan restaurants more popular in Trivandrum, or even in Kerala? Right now, there are only two fully vegan restaurants in the entire state, the other being in Fort Kochi. Even if not fully vegan, why don‚Äôt more restaurants offer plant-based options? I‚Äôve never seen a place here serve vegan cheese, yogurt, or ice cream in any dish. Heck, people don't even understand what I mean when I ask if plant based alternatives exist or if vegan options exist (most people confuse between vegan and vegetarian and sometimes even assume butter is vegan, here in Kerala)

Having traveled to places like Singapore and across Europe, I‚Äôve seen how even budget restaurants offer plant-based alternatives for nearly everything. Considering the environmental impact, chances of spreading pandemics, antibiotic resistance and huge ethical concerns surrounding animal products, I believe it‚Äôs high time that restaurants in Kerala start offering more options, not just for vegans, but for everyone, including those who may not even know these alternatives exist.

Hello po doctors!! I‚Äôm currently a GP moonlighting po. Passed last 2024, ilang buwan na rin nagmmoonlight. First gen MD (I have a few distant cousins na doctors pero ako yung first talaga sa immediate family).

Wala binabayaran other than usual bills sa bahay, tho I‚Äôm saving up for a secondhand car sana para yung mga mas malalayo na high paying gigs matake ko. Hirap kasi mag commute ng malayo eh. Hehe. Recently kasi, may significant life event na nangyari and medyo naderail yung life plans ko, so I‚Äôm currently back to square one in my life plans. Hoping people can give me advice kasi medyo lost ako ulit. Soo anyway here are my options:

Option A: Australia. I‚Äôm intimidated lang kasi I heard na the exams are notoriously hard to pass, and with the recent events sobrang naghihigpit daw ang Immigration apparently. I also have a sibling working there na. Di pa siya PR but matagal na siya rin dun and fairly stable naman ang job niya. I don‚Äôt expect na magwwork ako sa area niya but atleast someone can help me a bit pag nagland ako dun. My family has plans din to settle sa Aus in the future, esp yung mom ko when she retires and my other siblings pa. Wala lang ako kakilalang MD na nag Aus so medyo uncharted territory pa to sakin. 

Option B: residency here sa Pinas. Non-cutting yung gusto ko (emed or fm), then I was planning to establish a practice nalang rito sa Pinas. I‚Äôm fairly familiar with the respective routes naman. Problem lang kasi is currently, di ko pa alam bet the two specialties ittake ko if ever magtuloy nga ko rito. Both of them have their pros and cons for me, pero if ever mag resi nga ko I‚Äôm giving myself until the end of the year para mag decide. Then pre res na.

1kafft1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kafft1,Living room styling help,"Looking at this apartment, but having an issue with visualizing how to style this long, 12 ft wide living room adjacent to the bedroom. This is not my furniture, but I do have a 104‚Äô couch (no chaise), 60‚Äô rectangular coffee table, side tables, and a tv. Is there a way to fit this into the space without impeding the bedroom entryway/having the tv stick out like a sore thumb??

1kafe9r,https://i.redd.it/hhgxyxklapxe1.jpeg,Yellow yellow room,"I am struggling with this room because of how yellow it skews in person. The flooring has yellow undertones, the couch skews yellow, and I‚Äôm trying desperately to get the room to cool down. I‚Äôm not huge on color. I like neutrals and textures and materials more than color. The curtains on the right are probably the ones I‚Äôd go with over the ones on the left, which also looks yellow. I was considering buying the rug you see in an 8x10 but put it here for reference. I painted the walls white and put bright daylight bulbs in the recessed lighting and the fan. The couch and coffee table must stay, but everything else is replaceable (the tv stand is old and we were already planning on changing it and I just put the end table with the plant there for now to fill the space). 

Any and all suggestions welcome, especially with mockups. I am a highly visual person so it really helps!",1,1745900514.0,interiordecorating,3,1.0,False

NELSON DEVEREAUX:  
Minneapolis resident Nelson Devereaux is a saxophone and multi-wind instrument player who weaves old into new with exciting indie/instrumental pop sensibilities and dazzling technical abilities on multiple instruments. His latest record, ‚ÄúInfinity‚Äù released in November 2024 on the Brooklyn-based Youngbloods label.‚Äù He recently completed a US duo tour with Craig Finn in April.

J HOARD  
J. Hoard is an NYC artist with gospel roots that inspired his tremendous love of all genres. His eclecticism yielded songwriting collaborations on Black Coffee‚Äôs Grammy-winning ""Subconsciously"" album and Chance the Rapper‚Äôs multiple Grammy-winning ‚ÄúColoring Book‚Äù album. J. Hoard‚Äôs musical versatility is demonstrated on albums by Brasstracks, Kassa Overall, Meshell Ndegeocello, Cultura Profetica, Jos√© James and Endea Owens. From hip hop to Hammerstein, onstage is where J. Hoard shines best. In one performance his jazz harmony informed, gospel raised, rock influenced, classically instructed - sincerely one of a kind- voice makes clear J.‚Äôs intent to connect to the audience and ensure whatever story is sung sounds tailor made.‚ÄúJ. Hoard, an exuberantly gifted young vocalist and songwriter who treats affirmation as an art form, has lately been leaving bread crumbs all over the New York City scene, collaborating with artists in jazz, rock, soul and electronic music.‚Äù Giovanni Russonello New York Times
