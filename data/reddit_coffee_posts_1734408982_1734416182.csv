It‚Äôs well-known among contractors that your tape measure is never safe on a job site.  They have a way of disappearing and never coming back.  So this time, Kevin decided to take precautions - nobody could walk off with his tape accidentally or otherwise.  He took his pocketknife and scratched his name into the casing of his FatMax tape measure and filled the lettering in with a black Sharpie.

Nobody would pick up his measuring tape now, right?

Wrong.  His tape disappeared again, just had all the previous ones.  Oh well. Never gonna see that tool again right?

Wrong.

Kevin lives in Houston, Texas.  Apparently, years after its initial disappearance, an instagram influencer in Atlanta, Georgia found Kevin‚Äôs tape measure and had a good idea.

Why not try to find Kevin and return his tool?  That‚Äôd probably get some clicks, right?

The marketing department at Stanley Tools caught wind of this and they thought it was a great idea too, so they got on board and started an online promo campaign:‚Äú

Stanley Tools: The Hunt for Kevin‚Äù.

One day, my nephew Kevin was enjoying his morning cup of coffee and scrolling thru Instagram, when lo and behold, a photo of his long-lost tape measure in his feed!He did a double-take.  Then a triple-take.‚Äú

Hey WAIT A MINUTE‚Ä¶..that‚Äôs MY tape measure - why is it on my Instagram feed anyway?‚Äù

So Kevin kinda pieced the story together and he contacted Stanley Tools to claim his tape measure.  After a vetting process, they determined that they had found the real Kevin.  They sent a film crew to Texas to return the tape and filmed the whole thing.And Kevin finally got his tape measure back.

Question
I am currently just over 24 hours on my only water and coffee fast (with 0 kcal sugar) and lately everytime I fast my body takes it so hard.

I am used to feeling bad while fasting but at this point I am not even above the 24 hour point and I feel my head wanting to go right to the floor.My heart keeps beating so hard and I get pangs of coldness. My bones and back are aching. My joints and especialy my knees are stiff and burning My heart keeps banging for hours now. I am tired but my body is in too much discomfort, it feels very tense. I had a massage but it still felt too tense to get my body to sleep. I get headaxhes very easily and almost daily for months now.

I could fasting above 24 hours easily and still mentaly. I am not new to this but my body feels so weak and doing simple tasks is hard for me. I have trouble hitting my exercise goals. I am so ashamed of myself as I see people here going on longer fasts then me. I try to push myself everytime to the point of feeling so weak that getting out of bed is very hard. But the time between fasts is getting shorter.

I have done a lot of things to make fasting easier, like: ‚Ä¢ distracting myself with various things ‚Ä¢ watching relaxing videos ‚Ä¢ lowering my calories over time ‚Ä¢ doing a liquid diet (is very easy for me so it feels like I am cheating) ‚Ä¢ Upping the amount of hours of fasts slowly ‚Ä¢ drinking water with salt (never works for me, I don't know why) ‚Ä¢ taking breaks of fasting ‚Ä¢ changing my mentality to positive as possible ‚Ä¢ take walks (I keep getting dizzier to the point I kept almost getting overrun, so I switched to the treadmill but my body felt like it was going to collapse ‚Ä¢ stretching ‚Ä¢ drink teas ‚Ä¢ take valerian root and other natural sleeping medication (I get everytime nightmares)

I want to continue with my fast but I am trying to sleep now for hours but my body is so very tense. I don't want to stop this fast AGAIN for the so many time, but I just can't fall asleep and I have things to do tomorow.",2,1734415569.0,fasting,1,1.0,False

I originally had the goal of being a doctor, in reality I wanted to help families as my life goal and didn‚Äôt really have true career aspersions as much as character goals. I know it sounds cliche, but I was willing to choke down a 17/hour salary for the last 1.5 years. As time went on I kind of started to hate myself. I always have wanted to focus on character rather then career especially being I lived under a household where one of my parents worked a job they hated and for the most part took that out on anyone he could. Here I am 3 months out of work, chasing anything close to a career path. I see this absolute long shot of a job posting with really good benefits and I kinda just went ‚Äúwelp, what they gonna do? Say no like everyone else?‚Äù I go one for the first round of interviews for a job I didn‚Äôt think I even remotely deserve and I make it. They eagerly set me an interview date and all of a sudden it‚Äôs like I feel the light peaking through. I go in for the second interview and I‚Äôll be honest not my best. Luckily it went well enough to move on to the final round. As part of the final round I was asked to complete about a 2-3 hour assignment and at this point I went from ‚Äúkeep dreaming bud‚Äù to ‚Äútry the best you can this is earning part of yourself back‚Äù. I go on to spend about 12 hours on my assignment and was really proud of what I did. On the train ride to the job, someone spills coffee ALL over my folder of copies and I nearly lose it. I show up to the interview with a minute to spare as I frantically tried to find a spot to print out a copy. I get there and while they were very nice about it, it boiled down to ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt have it or can‚Äôt walk us through it, it will affect you‚Äù. At this point I‚Äôm ready to break down, for the first time in years I felt passionate and motivated and here I was, about to lose a opportunity cause someone couldn‚Äôt hold their ESCOOTER on the LIRR and hit someone else who was drinking out of a topless coffee cup‚Ä¶. I had a ‚Äúfuck it moment‚Äù as I didn‚Äôt have access to WiFi and by the time I‚Äôm in an office the branch manager is already there and ready. I explain the situation and he‚Äôs like ‚Äúwell, tell me what you came up with then.‚Äù I really don‚Äôt know what came over me, but I just went for it and writhing 20 minutes I have probably the best 20 minutes of my life. I went in an order I could remember and just laid it all out there. It was a business model proposal (a thing I had 1 year of ‚Äúbaby‚Äù experience in) and I was confident in the work I did but I always shortchange myself. At the end of the proposal I felt good, he gave some good feedback but being how collected and calm he was, I really thought I was in for a ‚Äúgood job, we will let you know your not a good fit via email within the day.‚Äù He goes on to say ‚Äúnot only did I present my self really well, he could tell I sacrificed a large portion of my weekend and really gave my all to it and fell in love with it‚Äù. At this point the only thing going through my mind is ‚Äúholy shit maybe it will be a good call‚Äù.

1hg46vp,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_robustmadagascar/comments/1hg46vp/what_is_the_origin_of_bourbon_vanilla/,What is the Origin of Bourbon Vanilla?,"[Bourbon Vanilla](https://preview.redd.it/34vc9sjpmc7e1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=756ee6f01c51e8cc50ec6d5970c1384cf99ce181)

Bourbon vanilla is one of the most prized and widely used vanillas in the world. Its rich, creamy, and aromatic flavor makes it a favorite for baking, cooking, and even in the fragrance industry. But where did this extraordinary vanilla come from? To understand its origin and journey, we must explore its history, cultivation, and its association with Madagascar, which today produces the majority of the world‚Äôs [bourbon vanilla](https://robustmadagascar.com/products/vanilla/bourbon-vanilla/). Let‚Äôs delve deeper into its roots and understand why it is so special. Robust Madagascar, a leading name in the spice industry, plays a significant role in offering high-quality vanilla.

**The History of Vanilla and Bourbon Vanilla**

The story of vanilla begins long before it became popular worldwide. Vanilla originally comes from the tropical forests of Mexico, where the Totonac people were the first to cultivate and use it. The Totonacs believed vanilla to be a sacred gift from the gods. Later, when the Aztecs conquered the Totonacs, they adopted vanilla as part of their culinary culture, combining it with cacao to create a drink for royalty.

It wasn‚Äôt until the 16th century that Spanish explorers brought vanilla to Europe. Vanilla quickly gained popularity for its unique flavor and was highly sought after. However, the vanilla plant could only grow in specific climates, making it a rare and valuable commodity.

The true turning point for the spread of vanilla cultivation came when it reached the Indian Ocean islands. In the early 19th century, French colonists brought vanilla plants to R√©union, then called √éle Bourbon. This is where the name ""bourbon vanilla"" originates. The island provided the perfect conditions for growing vanilla, but there was still one challenge‚Äîthe vanilla orchid required hand pollination to produce pods.

**Madagascar‚Äôs Role in Bourbon Vanilla**

Madagascar became the heart of bourbon vanilla production thanks to its ideal growing environment and agricultural innovation. In the mid-19th century, a young slave named Edmond Albius in R√©union discovered how to hand-pollinate the vanilla orchid, a technique that revolutionized vanilla cultivation.

From there, vanilla production spread to neighboring Madagascar, where the climate and soil were perfectly suited for growing high-quality vanilla beans. Today, Madagascar is the largest producer of bourbon vanilla in the world, accounting for nearly 80% of global production.

Companies like Robust Madagascar have contributed to preserving the tradition of bourbon vanilla cultivation while ensuring quality and sustainability. Their dedication to working with local farmers has made Madagascar a leading name in the global vanilla market.

**What Makes Bourbon Vanilla Unique?**

Bourbon vanilla stands out because of its superior flavor and aroma. Unlike other varieties of vanilla, such as Tahitian or Mexican vanilla, bourbon vanilla has a creamy, sweet, and mellow flavor with rich notes of caramel. This makes it perfect for a variety of uses in the culinary world, including desserts, beverages, and savory dishes.

The key to its unique flavor lies in the curing process. The vanilla beans go through a meticulous process of blanching, sweating, drying, and conditioning. This process, perfected over generations, brings out the signature characteristics of bourbon vanilla.

Robust Madagascar ensures that the vanilla they source is carefully cultivated and cured to meet global standards. This attention to detail guarantees that every pod of bourbon vanilla maintains its premium quality.

**The Cultivation of Bourbon Vanilla in Madagascar**

The cultivation of bourbon vanilla is a labor-intensive process that requires precision, skill, and patience. It begins with the planting of the vanilla orchid, which grows as a vine and needs support to climb. The orchid takes about three years to mature and bloom.

When the vanilla flowers bloom, they must be pollinated within a short window of just a few hours. Since natural pollinators are not present outside Mexico, each flower is hand-pollinated. This delicate process ensures that the vanilla pods will develop.

Once the pods are harvested, they undergo the traditional curing process, which can take several months. This curing is what gives bourbon vanilla its distinct aroma and flavor. Farmers in Madagascar follow these age-old techniques to produce high-quality vanilla that is loved worldwide. Robust Madagascar partners with these farmers to bring the best vanilla to markets while supporting local communities.

**The Importance of Sustainable Vanilla Production**

With the rising demand for bourbon vanilla, sustainable practices are more important than ever. Vanilla production faces challenges like price volatility, environmental changes, and fair compensation for farmers. Companies like Robust Madagascar are at the forefront of promoting sustainable vanilla production.

By working closely with local farmers, Robust Madagascar ensures fair wages and proper training in cultivation and curing techniques. Their efforts also focus on protecting the environment and encouraging ethical practices. This not only improves the quality of bourbon vanilla but also supports the livelihoods of farming communities in Madagascar.

**Uses of Bourbon Vanilla**

Bourbon vanilla is highly versatile and is used in various industries around the world. In the food industry, it is a key ingredient in cakes, cookies, ice creams, and pastries. Its rich flavor enhances beverages like coffee, milkshakes, and cocktails. Many chefs and bakers prefer bourbon vanilla for its ability to elevate the taste of their recipes.

Beyond the culinary world, bourbon vanilla is also used in perfumes, candles, and other aromatic products. Its sweet and soothing fragrance is widely loved, making it a popular choice in the fragrance industry.

Robust Madagascar supplies premium-grade bourbon vanilla to meet the needs of diverse industries. Their high standards ensure that customers get the finest quality vanilla for their creations.

**Why Madagascar‚Äôs Bourbon Vanilla is the Best**

Madagascar has earned its reputation as the global leader in bourbon vanilla production for a reason. The country‚Äôs perfect climate, fertile soil, and generations of expertise in vanilla cultivation all contribute to producing the best vanilla in the world.

The dedication of Malagasy farmers, combined with the efforts of companies like Robust Madagascar, ensures that every vanilla pod meets the highest standards. Whether it‚Äôs for baking, cooking, or creating fragrances, Madagascar‚Äôs bourbon vanilla continues to be the preferred choice.

**Conclusion**

The origin of [bourbon vanilla](https://robustmadagascar.com/products/vanilla/bourbon-vanilla/) is a fascinating journey that spans centuries and continents. From the ancient forests of Mexico to the shores of Madagascar, vanilla has become a symbol of quality and flavor. Madagascar‚Äôs bourbon vanilla stands out for its exceptional taste, aroma, and versatility, making it the most sought-after vanilla variety in the world.

Robust Madagascar plays a key role in preserving the legacy of bourbon vanilla by supporting sustainable farming practices and delivering top-quality vanilla to global markets.

Turns out that my SIL (33) was at a bar and saw Liam there with Lucy and some other random girl. Apparently Liam was being touchy with both of them and my SIL told me how they all left together. I try to not be nosy or invade privacy, but I had to look at his laptop. I looked at his email and Facebook and eventually found a group on messenger with Lucy and another girl named Lily all talking about how much fun they‚Äôve all been having. I was already pissed and then I saw a text about how they should have another threesome. Like WTF?? 

This all happened 2 days ago and I told my boyfriend I was going to visit my mom and dad (both 62) for the weekend because I wanted one last visit before the baby. I knew I had to leave the house or else I‚Äôd probably burn down all his stuff and lose my mind. I‚Äôm pregnant, hormonal, tired, and now depressed. I was considering breaking up with him on the spot, but with the baby coming moving out and finding my own place will be really stressful. I also don‚Äôt know what to do with Lucy. Right now all I care about is making sure that I don‚Äôt get too stressed and hurt the baby. What should I do with both of them that makes sure I‚Äôm safe along with my baby?",5,1734414852.0,Advice,1,0.86,False

Everywhere you turn online, there‚Äôs a new ‚Äúmiracle product‚Äù promising effortless fat loss, energy boosts, and a metabolism so fast it‚Äôll melt fat like butter on a hot skillet. It all starts to sound like a bad infomercial, right? That was my mindset when I first stumbled upon **Tea Burn**.

But if you‚Äôre here searching for a *real* **Tea Burn review**, you‚Äôre in the right place. I‚Äôm about to share my raw, no-fluff experience with this supplement, the good *and* the bad, and how it‚Äôs quietly turned my life around.

If you‚Äôre skeptical‚Äîgood. So was I.

# Where It All Started: My Struggle

A few months ago, I was stuck in what I like to call ‚ÄúThe Cycle.‚Äù

* Wake up feeling drained.
* Chug coffee to survive the morning.
* Drag myself through work and hit a 3 PM energy crash.
* Crave carbs, eat junk, feel guilty, repeat.

Oh, and my jeans? Let‚Äôs just say they were holding on for dear life.

I‚Äôd tried everything: restrictive diets, crazy workout plans, and supplements that made big promises but delivered absolutely *nothing*. I was tired. Tired of wasting time, money, and energy on stuff that didn‚Äôt work.

That‚Äôs when I came across **Tea Burn**. I almost scrolled past it, but something caught my eye‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt claiming to be magic. Instead, it offered a simple idea:

>Add it to your tea, support your metabolism, and watch what happens.

I drink tea every morning anyway, so I thought, *Why not?*

# What Exactly Is Tea Burn? (And Why I Tried It)

For anyone wondering, **Tea Burn** is a tasteless powder you stir into your tea (or coffee, if that‚Äôs your thing). It‚Äôs made with natural, metabolism-boosting ingredients that work to:

* Supercharge your metabolism
* Enhance energy levels without jitters
* Reduce cravings and help burn fat more efficiently

The fact that it‚Äôs tasteless and dissolves instantly sold me. I hate choking down weird shakes or popping a million pills.

# My 30-Day Tea Burn Experience: The Honest Truth

I‚Äôll be real with you‚Äî**Tea Burn** didn‚Äôt *instantly* turn me into a supermodel. No product will. But here‚Äôs what did happen:

# Week 1: Subtle Changes

The first thing I noticed? I wasn‚Äôt reaching for a second (or third) cup of coffee. My energy felt *clean*. No jitters, no crashing. I could power through my morning without the usual fog.

Also, I didn‚Äôt feel as snacky. Normally, by 10 AM, I‚Äôd be raiding the pantry. With Tea Burn in my morning tea, the cravings just weren‚Äôt there.

# Week 2: Energy + Focus Levels

By week two, I was in a groove. My afternoon energy slump? Gone. I could focus on work, hit the gym after, and still have energy to enjoy my evenings. My clothes were fitting a *tiny* bit better, too.

# Week 4: Visible Results

By the end of the month, I had dropped 7 pounds. But the number on the scale wasn‚Äôt what shocked me most‚Äîit was how I *felt*. Energized. Lighter. Happier.

My metabolism felt like it had finally woken up. Tea Burn didn‚Äôt just help me lose weight; it helped me regain control of my body.

# What‚Äôs Inside Tea Burn? (Why It Works)

I‚Äôm a stickler for ingredients, so I looked into Tea Burn‚Äôs formula before taking the plunge. It‚Äôs packed with clean, natural ingredients that *actually* have science backing them:

* **Green Tea Extract** ‚Äì Boosts metabolism and helps burn fat naturally.
* **L-Carnitine** ‚Äì Transforms stored fat into energy.
* **Chromium** ‚Äì Balances blood sugar to control cravings.
* **L-Theanine** ‚Äì Enhances focus and keeps energy steady.

No weird fillers, no artificial junk‚Äîjust stuff that works.

# Does Tea Burn Really Work? My Final Thoughts

If you‚Äôre still on the fence, let me say this: Tea Burn isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúmiracle.‚Äù You‚Äôre not going to wake up with six-pack abs overnight.

But if you‚Äôre someone who‚Äôs been fighting stubborn weight gain, low energy, and cravings, **Tea Burn** could be exactly what you need to break through.

It‚Äôs not about doing *more*. It‚Äôs about doing something *smarter*.

By simply adding it to my morning tea, I unlocked energy I hadn‚Äôt felt in years. I watched my cravings disappear, my mood improve, and my body start to *finally* work the way it should.

# Is Tea Burn Worth It? Absolutely.

Here‚Äôs the truth: Tea Burn didn‚Äôt just help me lose weight‚Äîit gave me *control* back. Control over my cravings, my energy, and how I show up every day.

If you‚Äôre tired of feeling stuck and ready to try something that *actually* works, Tea Burn might just be the missing piece of the puzzle.

So go ahead, pour yourself a cup of tea, add that little scoop, and see for yourself. You‚Äôll be glad you did.

Trust me‚ÄîI was.

1hg3wq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1hg3wq9/igpu_mistake_on_first_diy_nas/,iGPU mistake on first DIY NAS,"So I think I messed up a bit.  I wanted

* ECC RAM
* Low power as it'll be on 24x7x365 and I live in California where electricity is expensive
* Good hardware support for plex or emby

So after quite a bit of research, I decided to go with a cheap used i3-9100, planning to skip a dedicated GPU.

The problem was then that there aren't that many inexpensive micro-ATX MoBo that would support the ECC.  I jumped on an open box [Supermicro X11SCL-F](https://www.supermicro.com/en/products/motherboard/x11scl-f) for $160, but failed to realize while it would ""support"" the CPU, the C242 chipset apparently doesn't support the iGPU

* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_Intel\_chipsets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_chipsets) ""C232 and C242 chipsets do not support CPU integrated GPUs""
* Only the onboard ASPEED shows up in lspci and TRUENAS
* No ""Graphics Controller"" option in the bios
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee\_Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_Lake) says ""Legacy support for iGPU"" but I guess it's not talking about C242

So I guess there's no hope to use the iGPU and quicksync with this board?  Do I have any options with it besides adding a dedicated GPU or living without one (under the impression the ASPEED is pretty useless besides basic display)?

Should I look for a decent priced C246 and try to sell the X11SCL-F on ebay (main problem there is that I have no seller rep and these boards might be fairly niche, return period has passed)?

Otherwise the system works well and the power draw is pretty great even before tuning.

1hg3tf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewDaily/comments/1hg3tf2/nagano_tonic_review_my_6week_transformation_story/,Nagano Tonic Review: My 6-Week Transformation Story (Does It Really Work?),"I‚Äôm going to be brutally honest: I had completely *given up*.

For years, I tried every diet, every workout program, and every ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù supplement that promised the world and delivered nothing but frustration. My energy was shot, my metabolism felt like it had hit rock bottom, and the extra weight around my midsection? Let‚Äôs just say I avoided mirrors like the plague.

But then something happened‚Ä¶

I stumbled across a tiny, hidden gem of a health tonic‚Äîsomething inspired by a centuries-old Japanese remedy from Nagano, a place where living past 100 *isn‚Äôt* the exception. I was skeptical at first (because who isn‚Äôt?), but after a few weeks of testing it out, I can confidently say:

This was the **breakthrough I never saw coming**.

# The Turning Point: From Sluggish to Supercharged

Before I get into the details, let me paint you a picture of where I was.

* Waking up every morning felt like a chore. Even with 8 hours of sleep, I was dragging myself out of bed.
* I‚Äôd get energy crashes by 2 p.m., surviving on coffee just to function.
* My metabolism was so slow, I felt like looking at carbs would add 5 pounds overnight.

Sound familiar? If you‚Äôre reading this, I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôve been there too. That hopeless feeling of spinning your wheels without any results.

I‚Äôd nearly resigned myself to the ‚Äúthis is just my life now‚Äù mindset.

That‚Äôs when I found out about the Nagano-inspired **natural tonic** that changes how your body processes energy, sheds stubborn fat, and revitalizes you from the inside out.

And let me tell you something: **it works**.

# What Makes This Tonic So Powerful? (The Science That Sold Me)

I‚Äôll admit‚ÄîI‚Äôm the world‚Äôs biggest skeptic. So when I saw claims about this supplement‚Äôs natural ingredients boosting metabolism, burning fat, and increasing energy, I thought, ‚ÄúYeah, right. Another scam.‚Äù

But when I dug into the science behind it, I was floored.

This isn‚Äôt some generic, slapped-together diet pill. It‚Äôs based on **natural superfoods** that have been used for centuries in Japan:

1. **Camu Camu** ‚Äì A powerhouse antioxidant that fights inflammation and supports natural weight loss.
2. **EGCG (Green Tea Extract)** ‚Äì Proven to turbocharge metabolism and melt away stubborn belly fat.
3. **Panax Ginseng** ‚Äì Boosts energy and stamina without the jittery side effects of caffeine.
4. **Ashwagandha** ‚Äì Lowers stress hormones that cause emotional eating and fat storage.

It‚Äôs no wonder people in Nagano are so *naturally healthy*. This combination helps your body reset its metabolism, fight fatigue, and shed extra weight‚Äî**without starving yourself or overtraining**.

# My 6-Week Experience: What REALLY Happened

Let me get this out of the way first: this isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúpop a pill and sit on the couch‚Äù solution. I made simple changes‚Äîlike drinking the tonic every morning and cleaning up my diet *just a little*‚Äîbut the results?

**Week 1**: My energy levels skyrocketed. I wasn‚Äôt crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. It felt like my body had been *rebooted*.

**Week 2**: I noticed my clothes started to fit better. My waistline wasn‚Äôt as tight, and my face looked less puffy. People started asking, ‚ÄúAre you doing something new?‚Äù

**Week 4**: The number on the scale dropped by 12 pounds. But here‚Äôs the kicker‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt starving myself or obsessing over calories. My cravings for junk food? Gone.

**Week 6**: I looked in the mirror, and for the first time in years, I was *proud* of what I saw. My energy was through the roof, my body felt lighter, and my confidence came back in ways I can‚Äôt even describe.

# Why This Tonic Stands Out (And Who It‚Äôs For)

There are a million supplements out there, so why does this one work when so many others fail?

Here‚Äôs the truth: most weight-loss products target **the symptoms**, not the root cause.

This tonic works differently. It resets your metabolism, lowers stress hormones, and helps your body process fat as fuel. No crazy workouts. No dangerous pills. Just a simple, natural blend you drink each day.

**If you‚Äôre someone who‚Ä¶**

* Struggles with stubborn belly fat
* Feels like their energy levels are at an all-time low
* Wants a natural, healthy solution without side effects

‚Ä¶then this is exactly what you need.

# The Results Speak for Themselves

I‚Äôm not a fitness guru, and I don‚Äôt have a magic metabolism. I‚Äôm just a normal person who was tired of feeling stuck in my own body.

Six weeks later, I‚Äôve lost over 20 pounds of fat. My energy feels like it did in my 20s. I wake up excited to take on the day instead of dreading it.

And here‚Äôs the best part: I know this isn‚Äôt temporary. This tonic has given me a *new foundation*‚Äîone that doesn‚Äôt rely on yo-yo diets, insane exercise routines, or feeling deprived.

# Your Next Step: Try It for Yourself

Look, I‚Äôm not here to convince you to buy something. I‚Äôm just sharing what‚Äôs worked for me when *nothing else did*. If you‚Äôre sick of feeling sluggish, unhappy with your body, and tired of empty promises, then you owe it to yourself to try this out.

Imagine what your life could look like 6 weeks from now‚Ä¶

* Waking up with natural energy that lasts all day
* Watching your body transform without stress or frustration
* Feeling confident and proud every time you look in the mirror

It‚Äôs possible. I‚Äôm living proof.

The question is: Are you ready to give yourself that chance?

**Final Thoughts**

This Japanese-inspired tonic turned out to be the game-changer I needed. It‚Äôs natural, it‚Äôs simple, and most importantly, it works.

Don‚Äôt let doubt or hesitation hold you back. If you‚Äôre ready to reset your energy, metabolism, and confidence, now‚Äôs the time to act.

Trust me‚Äîyou‚Äôll be glad you did.

Doctors have tested me for every possible condition‚ÄîCushing‚Äôs syndrome, hypothyroidism, ascites, insulin resistance, and a laundry list of rare disorders. They ran metabolic panels, hormone tests, and even MRIs to rule out anything that could explain this transformation. Everything came back normal. After countless appointments with endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, and dietitians, the consensus is unanimous: this is the most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome they‚Äôve ever seen. My body has gone into a hyper-sympathetic state, mimicking my wife‚Äôs pregnancy so intensely that I now look more pregnant than she does.

Here‚Äôs the wildest part: my belly has grown to an unbelievable 67+ inches in circumference. It‚Äôs perfectly round, heavy, and tight‚Äîso much so that doctors have compared it to an overdue pregnancy with triplets or even quadruplets. I‚Äôve been experiencing cravings, hormonal changes, and even bizarre moments of arousal that have made this entire experience surreal and difficult to process.

The public‚Äôs stares reactions to me have been nothing short of overwhelming. Everywhere I go, people treat me like a walking sideshow attraction. Strangers constantly stop me on the street to ask, ‚ÄúWhen are you due?‚Äù or ‚ÄúAre you having twins‚Äîor is it triplets?‚Äù Sometimes, people assume I‚Äôm joking when I say I‚Äôm not pregnant or assure them that my belly is real, even, and not a costume. One particularly embarrassing encounter happened when a man followed me in his car, yelling ‚ÄúHey, heifer! How‚Äôd you get so huge, fatass!‚Äù and filming me as I struggled to walk. He kept shouting out the window, ‚ÄúWhen are the babies due?‚Äù and even taunted me to run, laughing as I awkwardly waddled down the street. 

Another time, a homeless man trailed me for blocks, loudly asking, ‚ÄúAre you sick? What happened to you? You can still fix this. You look like you‚Äôre about to pop!‚Äù His comments drew stares from others, and the whole experience left me humiliated. Once, at a grocery store, I reached for something on a high shelf, and the movement caused my shirt to ride up, exposing my belly. A woman nearby loudly gasped and asked if I was okay, or pregnant, and when I assured her I wasn‚Äôt pregnant, she looked me up and down in disbelief before walking away, shaking her head.  Thankfully, some guys are entertained or supportive, and say things like ‚ÄúDamn, bro, that‚Äôs the most impressive belly I‚Äôve ever seen. Take care of yourself. That‚Äôs crazy.‚Äù

Our small town caught wind of what was happening to me and even ran a story in the local paper. They did a photo shoot with me and my wife, documenting what they called ‚Äúthe most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome on record.‚Äù The article focused on the medical mystery and included photos of me standing next to my wife, both of us cradling our bellies. At one point, they measured my stomach circumference on camera, which was mortifying. The reporter joked that I looked more overdue than my wife, and the whole experience left me red-faced, especially when people in town started recognizing me from the article and stopping me to ask questions.

Family and friends have been equally baffled. My wife‚Äôs parents were initially concerned and suggested I get immediate medical attention, while my own family didn‚Äôt believe it at first and thought I was exaggerating. Now, it‚Äôs become a mix of humor and genuine concern. Even at work, my coworkers started a playful due date countdown for me, marking it on the office calendar alongside my wife‚Äôs.

Despite the jokes, I feel terrible that my transformation has overshadowed my wife‚Äôs pregnancy. What should have been a time focused on her and the excitement of our twins has turned into a community spectacle about my bizarre condition. She‚Äôs been incredibly supportive and laughs it off, joking that I‚Äôm taking some of the heat off her by becoming the bigger attraction. But I can‚Äôt help feeling guilty‚Äîthis was supposed to be her moment, and instead, I‚Äôm the one everyone‚Äôs talking about.

Meanwhile, I‚Äôve struggled to maintain a sense of normalcy. My shirts don‚Äôt fit anymore, riding up over my belly and exposing the lower half every time I move. I‚Äôve tried buying larger sizes, but even those don‚Äôt last long before I outgrow them. Just the other day, I bent down to tie my shoe at work, and the strain caused a button to pop off my shirt, shooting across the office like a missile. Everyone heard it, and I had to awkwardly laugh it off while turning red. Another time, I stretched to grab something at a 711, and the seam of my shirt tore open right down the side, leaving me scrambling to cover myself. My pants aren‚Äôt any better‚Äîthey‚Äôre so tight under the curve of my gut that I‚Äôve split the seams more times than I care to admit.

At work, I‚Äôm required to wear a uniform‚Äîa button-up shirt, no less‚Äîand squeezing into it has become a nightmare. The buttons pull so tight that I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll pop, and they often do‚Äîsometimes in front of coworkers or even clients, which is humiliating. I‚Äôve started bringing safety pins to hold my shirts together in emergencies, but even those can barely contain the strain. Each week, I‚Äôm outgrowing something else, to the point where I‚Äôm running out of options entirely.

Getting dressed in the morning has become a daily battle. Pulling my pants up under the massive curve of my belly feels like trying to fit into a sausage casing. The waistband digs into me so tightly that it makes my gut stick out even more, exaggerating its size and making me look even more absurdly pregnant. My belt creaks and groans whenever I sit down, and I constantly worry it‚Äôs going to snap. Even sitting in a chair has become a spectacle; I have to ease myself down slowly to avoid bursting buttons or causing the furniture to creak under my weight.

Movement is an entirely different challenge. I can barely bend over to tie my shoes without my belly pressing hard against my thighs, forcing me to hold my breath just to reach the laces. I‚Äôve started wearing slip-ons to avoid the embarrassment. Getting in and out of my car is another ordeal‚Äîit feels like I‚Äôm wedging myself into a tight space, my belly brushing against the steering wheel no matter how far back I push the seat. Walking down the street, my belly bounces and jiggles with every step, drawing stares from passersby. Sometimes, I even catch people filming me.

Everyday tasks that used to be simple now feel monumental, and I‚Äôve stopped pretending I can blend in. Despite my best efforts to maintain normalcy, my transformation has made me impossible to ignore.

Doctors have been fascinated by my condition, describing me as a medical anomaly. They‚Äôve even suggested publishing my case in a medical journal, as they‚Äôve never seen anything like it. While I understand their excitement from a scientific perspective, it‚Äôs hard not to feel like a sideshow. I‚Äôve been poked, prodded, and measured so many times that I‚Äôve lost count.

As for other symptoms/side effects, there‚Äôs a lot more to this experience than just the abdominal growth. Early on, we thought it was kind of adorable how in sync my wife and I were during her pregnancy. I‚Äôd wake up nauseous when she did, I‚Äôd have random cravings, and we joked about how empathetic I was being when I‚Äôd have morning sickness. But as things progressed, it became clear this wasn‚Äôt just harmless sympathy symptoms. My body‚Äôs hormonal changes went into overdrive. Alongside the weight gain, I‚Äôve dealt with intense mood swings, exhaustion, and an unsettling sensitivity to smells. Even little things, like the scent of strong coffee, can send me running for fresh air.  The exhaustion hasn‚Äôt helped with me also not being very active during this time. 

Unlike my wife, I‚Äôm not growing two babies, so everything I eat is turning directly into fat, and unfortunately, it‚Äôs all going straight to my belly. The uncontrollable cravings have been a big part of this. I naturally eat more than her as it is, but the hormonal changes I‚Äôve been experiencing‚Äîlike elevated prolactin and cortisol levels‚Äîhave completely derailed any sense of self-control. It‚Äôs as if my body is craving the transformation itself. There have been times I‚Äôve gone on insane binges, eating until I physically couldn‚Äôt anymore‚Ä¶ Even when I wanted to stop, it felt impossible, I was still hungry, like my body was demanding more fuel to keep growing.

Doctors think my body is in a kind of ‚Äúhyper-storage mode,‚Äù where every calorie is being stored as fat, specifically in my abdomen, almost as if it‚Äôs mimicking a pregnancy. Some specialists believe my fat cells in this area might have become overly sensitive to insulin, leading to the rapid, disproportionate fat accumulation. Others suggest that elevated prolactin levels, typically associated with lactation and maternal behaviors, might be affecting how my body stores fat and retains fluid. Combined with some fluid retention in my belly, it‚Äôs created this bizarre, ballooning effect that feels completely out of my control. It‚Äôs crazy to outgrow a shirt in a matter of a couple weeks. 

One of the more difficult‚Äîand frankly embarrassing‚Äîsymptoms has been this bizarre hormonal arousal.  Sorry if it is TMI to share all of this, but it‚Äôs such a large part of the psychological side effects I‚Äôve been dealing with that it would be hard not to include it. My doctors have explained that the surges of prolactin, cortisol, and other pregnancy-related hormones in my system seem to be ‚Äúconfusing‚Äù my body, tricking it into thinking this transformation is something I‚Äôm meant to desire or enjoy. It‚Äôs almost as though my body is trying to gaslight me into embracing the changes so it can continue expanding. They‚Äôve told me that this is likely part of a feedback loop‚Äîmy body experiences embarrassment or awkwardness from how big I‚Äôve gotten and the trouble I have maneuvering or drawing attention, and that stress triggers a hormonal response that leads to an unexpected surge of arousal. That sensation then clouds my judgment, making me crave situations where I feel even more self-conscious, which leads to choices‚Äîlike overeating or not avoiding tight clothes‚Äîthat exacerbate the growth.

This feedback loop is one of the hardest aspects to navigate. It‚Äôs created a cycle where I feel like I‚Äôm feeding into my own situation, literally and figuratively. The arousal itself feels like my body‚Äôs way of pushing me to keep going, even though I logically don‚Äôt want to get bigger or draw more attention. And yet, I‚Äôve found myself leaning into these situations, almost unconsciously seeking out moments that leave me even more embarrassed or humiliated. It‚Äôs such a strange and difficult headspace to be in because I know it‚Äôs my hormones playing tricks on me, but in the moment, it‚Äôs hard to fight against. The doctors are optimistic that these reactions should subside once my wife gives birth and my hormones stabilize, but until then, I‚Äôm doing my best to stay mindful and not let this cycle get even more out of control.

At the end of the day, I‚Äôm still at a loss. My body feels alien to me, and every day brings new challenges. I‚Äôve started wondering if this condition will reverse after my wife gives birth‚Äîor if this is something I‚Äôll be living with for the rest of my life.

1hg3sck,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokunoheroFanfiction/comments/1hg3sck/barista_izuku_is_adopted_by_everybody_but_all_on/,Barista Izuku Is Adopted by Everybody- but all on the same day,"Izuku, fed up with being hounded by Bakugo and his minions whenever he tries to train, instead begins to work on his public speaking and personality by getting a part-time job. After being rejected thirty-odd times for being quirkless and a stuttering mess, a cafe owner in a quiet nook of Musutafu decides to give him a chance, so long as he doesn‚Äôt spill the beans on his status to any customers. Taking it for what it‚Äôs worth, Izuku accepts and makes a disguise for the odd chance one of his classmates happens to swing by the cafe.

Not two weeks into the job, shenanigans ensue. A kid hiding his identity at a part time job in a semi-popular hero cafe is caught by Eraserhead, who spots the colored contacts and disguise he uses. He is not the first, as around 50% of the people there are noting the boy before brushing him off as emo. Not one to pry, Aizawa instead makes a habit of coming to check up on the kid- definitely not because he‚Äôs unnaturally good at mixing coffee roasts and he wants to understand how he makes a dark roast unnaturally darker. Cue the slow escalation of Aizawa noticing new burn scars and cuts on his rolled up sleeves, mistakenly believing Izuku is dealing in the shady side of the law. He decides to investigate the issue that night, tailing him as he heads home. 

At the same time period but three hours earlier every day, Toshinori slowly gets his ‚Äòfellow‚Äô quirkless out of his shell over cups of chamomile tea, the kid having slipped up on one of his first visits and mentioning it. As time goes on and he notes the signs of abuse, Toshinori begins to suspect something is going on at home. Izuku is very cagey about his school life, and is hesitant to speak about his mom outside of absolute positives (because she doesn‚Äôt support his dream). He, like Aizawa, decides to investigate that night, using his pro hero skills to attach a tracker to an All Might pin he gifted the kid. 

The issue? Nezu, pre-murder spree Stain, and Ryukyu (for the heck of it, and because a good ‚ÄòWu Loong‚Äô tea fits her theme) are also doing their own investigations, all with varying levels of tailing or hacking. Cue shenanigans!",1,1734413636.0,BokunoheroFanfiction,0,1.0,False

_Outside the Mekhane‚Ä¶_

Friday claps her hands together with a grin.

‚ÄúI officially call this Gay Breakfast to order!‚Äù

It‚Äôs only the two of them at the little table outside the Mekhane, but sometimes it's the announcement that makes an event feel like an _event_. This is apparently not an opinion that Kit shares, because he suddenly wants to keep his head down like he‚Äôs trying not to get caught. Which is silly, because there‚Äôs no shame in Gay Breakfast.

Kit sighs, looking a little too tired for his usual theatrics. He rests his head on his hand and his elbow on the table and generally looks in dire need of the coffee that is slowly cooling in front of him.

‚ÄúDo you not think that if you say things like this loud enough, you may single-handedly restart certain rumours about me?‚Äù He asks, tilting his face even further to the side as he stares into Friday's soul.

She responds with a theatrical sigh, shaking her head.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre overreacting,‚Äù Friday insists, ‚Äú_And_ you‚Äôre distracting me from today‚Äôs topic. Also ‚ÄòQueer Breakfast‚Äô isn‚Äôt as fun to say. If you wanted to be pedantic about it you could be my plus-one or something, but, the ‚ÄòA‚Äô is there for a reason, y‚Äôknow?‚Äù

‚ÄúI am aware.‚Äù

Kit gives his cup a wry smile. ‚ÄúYou said that you had a topic of discussion, yes?‚Äù

‚ÄúYup!‚Äù Friday ends the word with a ‚Äòpop‚Äô, leaning across the table with mischievous intensity. ‚ÄúI wanna know why you‚Äôve been avoiding me. Avoiding everyone, maybe?‚Äù

Kit shakes his head, looking morose (a word Friday learned from him, actually) as he attempts to shrug off her question with a dismissive wave.

‚ÄúHardly,‚Äù he lies.

Probably.

Friday takes a long slurp of her strawberry iced matcha latte (so good!) while she waits very pointedly for the rest of his explanation. Thankfully, it doesn't take him too long to concede. It _was_ an annoying slurp.

‚ÄúFriday,"" Kit protests, ""I can hardly see how _I_ am to blame when a number of excitable teenagers scatter to the four winds in the excitement of getting lost in the details of your city.""

He pauses, before continuing with an awkward (and somewhat defeated) shrug.

""But for what it‚Äôs worth? Look‚Ä¶ To be entirely honest with you, I don‚Äôt think the weather agrees with me. Despite doing my best to anticipate the midsummer climate, I‚Ä¶ haven‚Äôt been feeling well.‚Äù

_'It's a start,'_ Friday thinks.

The weather isn‚Äôt going to suddenly change his mind and 'agree with him', especially if he keeps wanting to cover up with that many layers, but Friday is too nice to immediately say the obvious part out loud.

It‚Äôs easy to believe that he isn‚Äôt well, though. She doesn‚Äôt need to use her powers to see that he looks like he hasn‚Äôt slept in a couple days, and it doesn't take a medic to see that something's wrong. But Friday‚Äôs not here to be a medic, and she _definitely_ wouldn‚Äôt want to use her powers without asking, especially with the way Kit gets about skin contact.

The thing is, being unwell doesn‚Äôt actually explain how he is even weirder and harder to find than usual. Friday‚Äôs just lucky that she managed to sneak up on him and that he didn't put up a fight when she redirected him from whatever Kit business he was up to and over to the cafe, considering she did _that_ by looping her arm through his and taking him on a walk.

She is trying to think of a different way to phrase her question when Kit interrupts her with a sly smile and a gay little wave.

‚ÄúI did bring some gossip to breakfast, as is tradition,‚Äù he reports, leaning in like he‚Äôs about to share a secret. Suddenly he looks way too clever and not as sick, which is never a good sign.

‚Äú_I_ heard that a certain Friday Karalis is on the loose, stealing first kisses from innocent young ladies."" Kit leans back in his chair, cupping his tea in both hands. ""What do you make of that one?‚Äù

Friday vehemently shakes her head, her hair turning into blue waves of denial as she crosses her arms. ‚ÄúNope! Not fair! You have to hear me out on this one, okay?‚Äù

He gestures for her to take the metaphorical floor, and Friday pleads her case.

Really, it‚Äôs not at all her fault that she didn‚Äôt pick up on something that was literally not said to her. So _maybe_ she had a bunch of fun at the party with one of her new friends. _Maybe_ they hung out on their own for a little while. And _maybe_ the other girl asked if she wanted to‚Ä¶ Well, yeah. That‚Äôs all perfectly normal!

The awkward part is that apparently Friday was supposed to realise that this means the two had to start dating. Like _'dating'_ dating, like _'stop talking like that to other people'_ dating. Like _'let's do everything together all the time'_ dating_._ Friday wasn‚Äôt interested in any of that, and when she worked it out‚Ä¶ Well, the other girl didn‚Äôt take it very well. But! telling people that Friday _stole_ something from her? Harsh. That kiss was perfectly consensual, thank you very much.

Friday rolls her eyes. ‚ÄúOkay, but how am I supposed to know that people want, like, a romantic thing, if they don‚Äôt _tell me_ anything?‚Äù She protests, biting down on a pastry for a flaky crunch of emphasis.

Her counsel is too distracted to reply for a second, with a surprisingly friendly wave to someone walking past her table ‚Äî [a blonde in a camp shirt](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/178rccg/isobel_has_a_crush_or_chthonic_research_chronicles/) (one of the Athena kids, right?) wandering arm in arm with someone that is probably her sister.

Kit turns back to their conversation with an exasperated sigh.

""_Friday._ Is it not patently obvious by now that I am quite possibly the _worst_ person to pose this question to?‚Äù

Friday senses a story, and she's ready to strike.

Kit, to his credit, takes it like a champ. She slowly annoys the tale out of him over breakfast, learning about Isobel (ugh, poor girl!) and jumping from topic to topic and having so much fun catching up with her friend that she completely forgets the original question she wanted to ask.

_NYC, in the long nights of the previous winter‚Ä¶_

In the time it took to make a decent cup of tea, Alyssa had already decided to regret letting the kid into her house in the first place.

She always tried to avoid all this soul-searching bullshit, but each question she had to answer is just time she didn't have to spend thinking about her own future, so it‚Äôs whatever.

The two of them ended up by the window at her kitchen table, and she was even nice enough to sit through most of his questions. Pretty fucking benevolent, and all that.

He wanted to know whether she figured that there‚Äôs something about being connected to the underworld that makes you a freak (yeah), whether there‚Äôs some kind of rivalry with the olympic kids (not really but some of the kids are little shits about it anyway), what she thought of the gods (nothing they'd like to hear), and whether ‚Äòthe others‚Äô ended up feeling like they belong more to the underworld than to the surface world (depends on whether the kid was already feeling like a weirdo loner before all the god stuff happened. emo kids love a reason to feel like the loner) and a shitload of other things.

Upside: the kid got easier to read as he spun his little stories and worked through his questions ‚Äî obviously he's not used to showing that kind of vulnerability. He spent his time fidgeting with coins and cheap tricks, trying to pry information out of her between asks. She never made it easy for him.

Her tea was cold before she could finish it.

*...*

‚ÄúWhy tell me all that?‚Äù Alyssa asked, once the questions taper off. ‚ÄúDo you want me to care? ‚ÄòCause I have bad news.‚Äù

Kit watched the coin running over his fingers instead of matching her stare. ‚ÄúMuch the opposite, actually. I tell you these things because I know for a fact that you _don‚Äôt_ care. Your indifference is a great help to me, and I appreciate the insight.‚Äù

He shrugged. ‚ÄúAfter all, if I _am_ supposed to belong to this world, I would like to know what I am in for.‚Äù

She tried not to roll her eyes. Failed. This kid loves his dramatics, that‚Äôs for sure.

‚Äú_Belong_ to it?‚Äù Alyssa shook her head. ""Are you trying to find something to chain yourself to?""

She reached out with the quiet darkness in the room to take his coin, watched his face change from surprised to amused as the coin vanished into the void just for her to hold it up between two fingers.

Alyssa placed the coin on the table between them. ""I don‚Äôt think a guy like you 'belongs' to anything.‚Äù

She meant it as a compliment. Even if she _did_ emphasise her words with a sarcastic gesture. Either way, from the way she could read his shadow and sense the weight coming off of his shoulders, it looked like he took it as one.

_Back to the Mekhane‚Ä¶_

Kit excused himself from the brunch table with an apologetic smile.

His mask had begun to slip as Friday wound her train of thought along another (admittedly fascinating) detour, and it was only when she looked to him with a note of concern that Kit realised how far his presentation had drifted from the usual practised perfection and measured distance. Setting his cup back down, he had made a comment about visiting the restroom.

""Hey, wait a sec‚Äî"" Friday had reached out, gently placed her hand over his own. He resisted the urge to flinch away. It was both easier and harder, now.

""No disappearing acts, okay?"" She asked, eyes wide and shining with borrowed gold. ""I'm not stupid, and I'm going to be _really_ annoyed if you disappear through the ground and leave me with the bill.""

He sighed, even as a smile tugged at the corner of his lips.

Kit gently retrieved his hand. ""You have nothing to worry about, my friend. I'll be back in a moment.""

""‚Ä¶Promise?""

Friday had asked her question with such an uncharacteristic intensity, as if she was searching for something. She may approach life with characteristic ease, but her gaze feels like a searchlight, leaving him harshly illuminated and uncomfortably exposed ‚Äî one would likely feel more comfortable down the sights of a rifle than a look of that magnitude.

Kit entreats the metaphorical darkness to veil the cracks of his expression into an affable nod, with a practiced smile and a look of playful exasperation.

""Of course. Now, if I may‚Ä¶""

*...*

The Mekhane's restroom was clearly signposted and easy to find, which made for rather fortuitous timing as Kit's legs gave out as soon as he locked the door.

With a complete and uncharacteristic lack of grace, Kit only barely managed to catch the edge of the sink with both hands as he recovered from the sudden bout of weakness. Using the sink for support, he quickly shed his summer coat and tried not to wince at how much sweat showed through the interior layers.

Almost immediately, they too were intolerable. Running the tap just to fill the silence, soon his shirt, undershirt, and even his gloves were gone. His myriad scars were pitifully exposed to the air, as if doing so could wick sweat that Kit knew damn well was not solely caused by the Georgia heat.

Drawing his gaze up to the meet his reflection, Kit shouldn't have been so surprised at how the gaunt young man in the mirror stares back.

_how he stared ba‚Äî_

stares back at‚Äî

**_stared_**_‚Äî_

""_Fuck._""

Kit mutters under his breath, freeing a hand for a moment to get the hair out of his face before once again holding the sink for support.

His reflection does the same, the movement accompanied with a painfully blatant expression of discomfort. It's not that he is a stranger to his own face, watching the circles under his eyes get darker with each fitful attempt at rest. It's that it feels _invasive_, now, to see this many raw details. He watches a pitch-dark bead of blood runs down the side of his face ‚Äî it must be from where his mask was torn away ‚Äî only to notice as the bead vanishes that there was never actually a wound to bleed.

He watches his selves. There's the self in the mirror, the one reflecting that piercing, plaintive gaze. And then there's the Kit standing at the sink, arms shaking as he tries not to feel like he's watching his own life from a blurred distance. Tries to convince himself that the Kit at the sink is _real_, that there is not some secret stranger-self watching his every move.

Not for the first time, Kit struggles to make sense of the feeling. This is not that cruel vertigo, the fear of that prelude to torment that once dominated every waking moment. There is almost a sickening familiarity to one particularly debilitating headache, but still the comparison is not quite correct. This is something horrid in its difference, a sensation that stirs at uncomfortable memories and each day in New Argos only twists the knife as it waits for him to get the point.

If only he could run from it, as he had run from so many things before.

He had, of course, attempted to leave the mountain city. It took two attempts before he conceded to the now-familiar sense that for whatever reason, he had to stay. He _needed_ to be here, and until he could figure out why, his intuition would only ever lead him back into the heart of the storm. Whether that intuition also necessitated some sort of supernatural illness, though, is something Kit is less certain of.

What he _is_ certain of, is that this illness is beginning to erode his ability to hide how it affects him. Even with a walking _panacea_ awaiting him at the brunch table and with everything the daughter of Persephone had done for him and her proven ability to keep his secrets, he cannot bring himself to tell her.

_How could I? She already knows so much._

Again, Kit finds himself mired in the familiar urges: to lie, to hide, to _run_.

_But I, fool that I am, promised to return._

Meriwether had shown him the importance of honoring such a thing.

How amidst the inevitable evil of _leaving_, a [note](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/y2z867/locations/kjgy87l/) from a liar is about as valuable as no goodbye at all. She illustrated this new kind of distrust with the tense distance between them that sprung into being even before he returned. There were many times in which Kit would meander through his lonely thoughts and wonder if he could have tried to stop being someone his sister could have become attached to, if he could have simply kept to old habits and a measured distance. If he had done so, could they have avoided these twinned pains of absence?

And yet‚Ä¶ Like embers on the brink of a cold and silent death, there is still that unreasonable flicker of optimism ‚Äî the idea that perhaps even it was just to one person, for one moment, he had become someone _real_.

_I still let her down. Maybe if she knew‚Äî_

Something inside him twists, and his scars ache with familiar warning.

_Earlier in the summer, in the city of New Argos‚Ä¶_  
_(brought to you by /u/burning-pyres)_

Ramona was walking down Temple Hill toward the secluded Temple of Hades, holding a basket of fruit in her arm. Why fruit you ask? Well, for offerings of course! She had considered offering her dad bones instead but when she really thought about it, he probably had waaayyyyy more bones than he needed, and he certainly did not need Ramona to add more to that pile. Besides, all things considered any bones that Ramona had were technically his property that she had appropriated for herself so it wouldn't be much of an offering anyway as much as a returning of stolen goods- Or, well, not really stolen. She _was_ her father's daughter after all and so naturally even she had some right over the things that fell under his domain, which included bones. So, yes. In her arms was a basket full of pomegranates and blood oranges which she felt was a fitting offering to her father. If nothing else, maybe her step-mother would enjoy some? She knew that the fruits of the mortal world could not compare to those of the underworld but still, maybe she missed the taste of her home above ground in the winter.

On her way though, she spotted something so strange it made her pause. It was Kit- which by itself wouldn't be that strange a sight if it weren't for the fact that he was simply‚Ä¶ walking. Not doing any of his usual shenanigans where he just appeared out of and disappeared in to thin air. On top of that, he didn't look particularly well either, the dark circles under his eyes seeming even more pronounced today than usual. Maybe it was just because of the apparent sickness, but Ramona could swear he looked like he wasn't even paying attention to where he was going- which knowing him felt downright absurd, but the way he was walking towards her‚Ä¶

Nah. Surely this was just a joke. He'd swerve out of her way last second and crack that smile that told her that he knew something she didn't again.

Or so she thought, until the boy bumped into her, knocking a few of the fruits out her basket. She yelped, trying fruitlessly to catch them before they hit the ground but Kit just mumbled an apology and hurried past. She couldn't quite catch what he said, something about an errand? She wasn't sure, she mostly just felt concerned for him. She'd have gone after him but something told her that he'd be better left alone at that moment.

With a white-knuckle grip on the stone sink, Kit's shoulders slump in tense defeat as he vomits into the basin.

It's far from the first time this episode in New Argos has driven him to this, and in his misery it is unlikely that this will be the last. With naught in his stomach but two cups of tea, it is an unfortunately quick affair that results in miserable retching. His eyes water, and he pointedly avoids looking at his own reflection as a single tear traces a dark line down the slopes of his face.

He reaches out for the switch to shut the lights off in a silent plea for the cover of darkness, only for his fumbling reach to miss the switch entirely as he realises that he never switched it on in the first place. As he coughs and attempts to regain control over his body, green eyes pressed shut as though they can keep the world out and whatever is happening _in_, he feels something reach deep into the core of his wretched body and _pull_.

As if reflex itself is begging for something, _anything_ more, from a husk that simply has nothing left to give_._

And yet to Kit's growing terror, it appears that he is entirely able to provide.

The darkness in the room intensifies as Kit convulses, doubling over the sink. His scars ache and his jaw aches and his eyes are wide as a torrent of black ichor spills over his teeth. An inhuman amount of darkness erupts from somewhere deep within, pooling miserably in the sink while Kit loses his balance and has to plant a dark hand-print on the mirror to catch himself before he falls forward.

It becomes everything, the darkness, rushing into the sink and flowing from his eyes and splitting open his old scars and tainting his hands. It feels wrong. It makes sense. It feels like being torn apart, and somehow it feels like _relief_. It feels like a moment unending, and somehow still only just a single moment.

Kit finds the light switch, whether he meant to or not.

Artificial light fills the room with fluorescent clarity, and the darkness vanishes so completely that one might wonder if it was ever truly there. Suddenly, the room is what it always has been, as if he had simply wished away both the ichor and the pain.

It may not be a complete recovery, but ‚Äî like the headache, the vertigo, the hallucinations-turned-hauntings ‚Äî whatever it has that had a hold on him seems to have passed for now, leaving something new in its place. A gift. Though he is still yet to understand just what he has been given, or what trials remain, he can admit that just the information itself is a welcome reprieve.

And as Kit catches his breath, refreshed and unharmed, it seems as though he has finally returned to himself.

*...*

Kit dressed quickly.

He only seemed to notice the shadow cast by the overhead light as he reached out to finally shut off the tap, how it sharpened and looked as though it might lift free of the wall if he so much as flexed his fingers. Dark eyes flashed with what might be recognition as he slowly moved his hand back and forth, though his mask of practiced neutrality would refuse to share any detailed revelations. He simply moved with an odd sense of control, looking to the untrained eye a perfect picture of his old self as he fixed his gloves with characteristic satisfaction in his movements.

Kit traded a knowing smirk with his reflection before stepping out of the restroom, splaying his hand in a casual wave. The movement seems instinctual, automatic, and somehow also entirely experimental. For a moment it seemed as though nothing else would happen, even as his shadow of his hand began to shift and chance all on it's own. He shrugged his shoulders in temporary defeat, before regaining his composure and stepping back out into the Mekhane proper.

He did not see the way that the restroom door seemed to move on its own, how it cast an unusually long shadow before gently closing itself and turning out the lights.",3,1734413621.0,CampHalfBloodRP,0,1.0,False

Rancher Micheal Johnson- personal perspective 


As I lay here in the slush and ice of the farm yard my chest being layered in my warm blood. My mind runs back over my life like an old recording running in fast forward until it reaches this evening. Oblivious to the gunfire, and explosions erupting around me, I watched as my life for all its good and bad culminated with this one last evening.


I walked in the front door and softly closed it as Becky and our now extended Yaire family left for the New Year‚Äôs Eve rodeo in town. 

‚ÄúLord, please watch over this of children. Please keep them safe from their youthful selves. Amen.‚Äù I said aloud. 

This had to be the first time in months that the house was all but empty. A few of the Yaire were in the bunk house but the main house, my house, was silent. I walked past the living room where no English was being practiced with the aid of old Westerns. I could see the door to the Beckie‚Äôs room was opened but no sound of laughter or talking of young woman crossed its threshold.

Slowly I walked through the lonesome rooms and over to the kitchen. I told myself softly at first then shouted internally to ‚Äúonly pour a new cup of coffee.‚Äù Knowing that I was going to reach for the bottle of old crow that I had hidden behind the pots and pans. It was as if I was watching two halves of myself wrestle for control one bagging to show restraint and the other, didn‚Äôt give a damn. Sadly the wrong person won.

Pouring two fingers of the amber liquid into a glass I hammered the bitting liquid down. With a moment of facial contortions, it was gone and I poured myself another. I drank the  measure of the whiskey and then another. 

It took a few moments for the alcohol to start taking effect. With a warm and newfound attitude, I sauntered to the row of pictures lining the wall.
  
I gazed at the young family that seemed so happy. I hovered over the pictures of high school ball games and moments frozen in time of my children trailing cattle off the hill. Finally I stopped and stared at the newest portrait. 

Beth had gave it to me for Christmas, it was a family reunion-style photo that included everyone, human and Yaire alike. My family is from here and literal worlds away I thought.

‚ÄúMicheal, do you have a minute?‚Äù A voice asked from behind me. 

I turned to see Less sticking his head in the door. ‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm sorry if you‚Äôre busy, I‚Äôll bug you later.‚Äù He said apologetically.

‚ÄúCome on in,‚Äù I waved. With that simple invitation, he walked in. He was dressed in some of Joshes handy-down blue jeans and a thrift store checkered jacket. That combined with his natural purple hue made for the very embodiment of a space cowboy.

Walking back to the kitchen I reached in the cupboard and retrieved a new glass. Setting it down on the kitchen counter that separates us with a fumbled clink. I recovered my rapidly draining bottle and poured a couple of shots into the glass.

‚ÄúUm, both Beth and Josh asked us to make sure you didn‚Äôt drink that stuff,‚Äù Less said sheepishly as he looked down at the counter in embarrassment.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry this one‚Äôs for you, there‚Äôs ice in the freezer if you want some,‚Äù I replied, as I refilled my glass.

Reaching for the glass he said, with a small tinge of embarrassment. ‚ÄúThanks, I guess, I‚Äôm not a big fan of the stuff but I‚Äôll  give it another try.‚Äù 

Raising it to his mouth he gave it the smallest of sips. With a muffled cough, he placed his hand up to his mouth. His eyes widened as gasoline-level fumes hit the back of his throat.

With an exhaustion of vapor that could peel paint, he set his glass down. ‚ÄúYep, I still don‚Äôt like it.‚Äù


‚ÄúI‚Äôm guessing you don‚Äôt have anything like it where you guys are from?‚Äù I asked setting my now half-finished glass down to mirror his.  

‚ÄúWe do, but it‚Äôs more like wine. I don‚Äôt like it much either.‚Äù He said while looking down at the glass.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs on your mind son?‚Äù I asked 

Taking a deep breath he took a moment to think on his word before he began. ‚ÄúWe all have hope of rescue but if I‚Äôm being honest, no one will come looking. Our people would believe us all to be dead. Our enemy doesn‚Äôt have much of a reputation for leaving survivors.‚Äù Less said still looking down at the glass, hiding the small tear that‚Äôs started to form on the side of his eye.

I looked for the right thing to say, but I couldn‚Äôt think of anything so I remained silent. I watched this troubled kid, not knowing how to give comfort, or how to ease the pain that troubled his mind. 

As I searched for the word, out of the corner of my eye a small red light blinked into existence just off the horizon. In a moment it grew brighter and larger until it stopped directly over the barn.

‚ÄúWhat is that?‚Äù I asked in surprise at the brightness. Turning to less, I saw he lost all experience and his eyes reflected pure fear. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs them.‚Äù He mumbled.

Grabbing him by his shoulders and giving him a firm squeeze, I shouted ‚ÄúLESS what the hell is that?‚Äù Pointing to the light, all he could muster in response was. ‚ÄúThey, they found us, oh god they found us.‚Äù His voice trembled the feeling of dread was palpable. 

Still holding on to his shoulder I all but shook him to bring him back to reality. ‚ÄúLess go to my bedroom, DAMN IT, LOOK AT ME!‚Äù I shouted. He changed his gaze to look me straight in the eye. ‚ÄúGet the A.R. from under my bed, Josh showed you how to use it right?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYes that's right,‚Äù he managed to blurt out as the fear faded from his face.

‚ÄúGood get it and load it. I want you to stay in the house. If everything goes wrong I need you to get everyone out of here. Get them to town or neighbors, just somewhere away from here. Do you understand?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù His military training came back to him as his instructions were being laid out.

Relaxing my grip, ‚ÄúGood, I‚Äôll go outside and see about taking this over. Less looked at me as if I had three heads. I left him standing dumbfounded in the kitchen. As I reached for the door I turned back to see less run for the waiting rifle. ‚ÄúOk, let‚Äôs see who‚Äôs here,‚Äù I said to myself as I left the still safety of the house and entered the wider chaotic world of noise and unknown danger.

I walked down the steps to the frozen yard. Each footstep was a slowly detonating bomb of anxiety. I had only reached the final steps when the red light turned to bright blinding white and descended to the farmyard in front of me. The light pulsed with a loud metallic hum that sounded like a giant fan blade inside of an old oil drum. That combined with the horses in the coral that were screaming with every noise they could make. The whining and snorts of fear coupled with the frantic hammering of hooves pounded a horrific rhythm that helped to paint a terrible picture.

As my feet touched the ground at the bottom of the stairwell everything was silent, no noises from the horses or machine all sound was gone. I looked straight ahead and watched as a silhouette came to stand in the center of the blinding light. 

‚ÄúAre you the Yaire‚Äôs caretaker?‚Äù A mechanical voice rang from the blackened figure.

‚ÄúThat depends, who the hell are you?‚Äù I said calmly even though I was a bundle of nerves.

That cruel bastard just stood there and laughed. 

‚ÄúSo I take it you‚Äôre not a fed! I shouted back at the fantom. 

‚ÄúThey belong to us.‚Äù The alien announced in its sinister tone. 

‚ÄúNot on earth they don‚Äôt!‚Äù All traces of stoicism were gone as my final button was pushed.

Then he fell, a faint mist emitted from its head. Less had killed the menace then all the sounds of the world came streaming in so suddenly that I had to cover my ears. 

The light turned off and the outline of a craft came into view. It  looked like a Chinook helicopter minus the rotors instead it hade a small set of swept wings. I don‚Äôt know if the wings help it float but the craft turned to face the hose.

It hadn‚Äôt yet finished its turn when a series of load booms came from the bar. This preceded an explosion of one of the wings. 
  
I must have been too close as a piece of metal hit me square in the chest.
 
Lying in the cold I prayed, ‚ÄúPlease lord watch over these kids and please help them to be the type of people they need to be. Amen.‚Äù

Here‚Äôs what happened:

We met through a mutual friend, and we decided to grab coffee at this cute little caf√©. Everything was going fine, casual stuff‚Äîtalking about work, movies, and all that. Honestly, I was just trying to play it cool and not overthink things. I‚Äôm usually pretty chill on first dates, but then it happened.

Jake says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll grab us some coffee, what do you want?‚Äù I tell him my usual order (latte with almond milk) and then just kind of zone out for a second. When he came back with our drinks, he handed me mine and we both started sipping. But then‚Äîand I‚Äôm not sure why this got to me‚Äîhe casually took a sip of my latte.

Like, no warning. Just grabbed it and took a swig. It wasn‚Äôt like a ‚ÄúHey, wanna try mine?‚Äù It was like, ‚ÄúThis is fine, I‚Äôm just going to drink from yours.‚Äù

Now, I know it‚Äôs just a drink, but for some reason, I felt this spark when he did that. I don‚Äôt even know what to call it‚Äîmaybe it was a mix of surprise, irritation, and a weird feeling of something being‚Ä¶ right? So, instead of reacting normally, I kind of froze. My brain was like, ‚ÄúWait, did he just do that? Am I supposed to be mad? Am I overreacting? But also, why do I feel this spark?‚Äù

Anyway, I tried to brush it off, but then it kept bugging me. Like, I kept thinking, ‚ÄúTell me when you start to feel the spark,‚Äù and I couldn‚Äôt tell if that was a good thing or if I should have said something sooner. So, I just kinda laughed awkwardly and pretended everything was fine.

Afterwards, I texted my best friend about the whole thing, and she‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúWait, you‚Äôre mad he took a sip of your coffee?‚Äù And I was like, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just that, it‚Äôs the spark I felt!‚Äù

Now I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm just being ridiculous. AITA for thinking that the fact he drank my coffee means something more, or is it just a normal thing to do on a first date?

Understanding their results through a ""before and after"" analysis can help you make an informed decision.

### At-Home Teeth Whitening

At-home teeth whitening kits have gained popularity due to their convenience and affordability. These products usually come in forms like strips, gels, or trays. They are designed to be used over a period of time, often ranging from a few days to a couple of weeks, depending on the product.

When comparing before and after results from at-home whitening, you typically notice a difference of 1-2 shades brighter. While this can provide satisfactory results, it might not match the effectiveness seen with professional treatments. Additionally, users must be mindful of the recommended application times to avoid tooth sensitivity or gum irritation.

### Professional Teeth Whitening

On the other hand, professional teeth whitening is performed in a dental office and often yields more noticeable results in a shorter period. Dentists use stronger whitening agents and can tailor the treatment specifically for your teeth.

- **Quick Results:** You can expect to achieve several shades of whiteness within a single visit, usually lasting about an hour.
- **Professional Expertise:** Dentists assess your oral health and determine the best treatment for you, minimizing risks.
- **Longer-Lasting Effects:** Professional whitening tends to provide lasting results, especially when combined with good oral care.

The before and after analysis of professional whitening typically shows significant color improvement, often 3-8 shades lighter immediately after the session. Patients leave the office with visibly brighter teeth, which adds to their confidence and self-esteem.

### Side Effects and Maintenance

Both methods can cause some side effects, mainly tooth sensitivity and gum irritation. However, these reactions can vary based on the individual and the products used.

- **At-Home Treatments:** Sensitivity usually diminishes over time, but it‚Äôs essential to follow instructions carefully to avoid overusing the product.
- **Professional Treatments:** Dentists often provide protective measures to minimize discomfort, but some sensitivity can still occur.

To maintain bright teeth after whitening, regardless of the method you choose, good oral hygiene is crucial. Regular brushing, flossing, and dental check-ups can prolong the effects of whitening treatments.

### Final Thoughts

The choice between at-home and professional teeth whitening largely depends on your goals, budget, and availability. If you're looking for immediate and noticeable results, visiting a dentist may be the best option. However, if convenience and lower costs are your priorities, at-home treatments can still provide satisfactory results.

Whether you go for at-home or professional teeth whitening, a careful assessment of your needs and expectations will help you achieve the dazzling smile you desire. Remember, after seeing those before and after images, it‚Äôs clear that both methods have their unique benefits. With the right approach, achieving a brighter smile is within your reach!

### Conclusion

A radiant smile can transform not just your appearance but also your confidence levels. The ""before and after"" phenomenon associated with teeth whitening illustrates just how impactful a brighter smile can be. Many people find themselves smiling more, feeling more approachable, and experiencing an overall boost in self-esteem after a whitening treatment. The visual contrast between the dull, discolored teeth and the vibrant, white smile captures the essence of these transformations.

When exploring the options for teeth whitening, understanding the difference between at-home products and professional treatments is vital. At-home kits may offer convenience and affordability, but they often yield results that cannot match the brilliance achieved through professional treatments. The detailed ""before and after"" comparisons reveal that professionals use stronger whitening agents and advanced techniques, leading to more significant and quicker results.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Selecting the right whitening method for you depends on your goals, budget, and personal preferences. Whichever option you choose, the positive effects on your smile and confidence can be life-changing. You may find that those initial before photos serve as motivation for maintaining your results. The journey to a brighter smile is one of self-care and personal enhancement, and the aftermath is worth celebrating.

With greater awareness of what teeth whitening can offer, you‚Äôre now equipped to make informed decisions regarding your smile. Whether you opt for professional treatment or a DIY method, the potential for a stunning transformation is in your hands. Embrace the change, and let your newfound confidence shine through.

We‚Äôre just three weeks into a new opportunity to renovate and open a caf√© on the corner of 4th and Townsend ‚Äî the former location of The Creamery Caf√©. This property was originally slated for demolition to make way for new offices around the time of the pandemic, but those plans have been delayed indefinitely. Our small, two-person coffee company was given the chance to breathe new life into the space, and while it‚Äôs a bigger project than anything we‚Äôve ever taken on, we decided to go for it.

Things were moving forward until this week when everything changed. Yesterday, our back gate was smashed down, and police discovered two people inside the unoccupied condo at the rear of the property using heroin. I agreed to press charges, thinking there‚Äôd be some accountability, but to my complete shock, the police just let them go. No arrest, no holding them. I‚Äôm struggling to understand how people can destroy property, break in, and still be back on the street in an hour.

The whole experience left me rattled. I barely slept that night, knowing our space had been violated. But I tried to shake it off and get back to work the next morning, only to discover that we‚Äôd been robbed. All our brand-new gear ‚Äî gone. I had barricaded the back gate as best I could, but it clearly wasn‚Äôt enough. What‚Äôs wild is that the theft was so specific and targeted to a storage area in the back. The only people who knew we had anything stored there were the same two people who were let go just hours earlier. I can‚Äôt prove it was them, but it‚Äôs hard not to connect the dots.

I‚Äôm in my mid-40s, and I‚Äôm not ashamed to admit I almost broke down crying today. It‚Äôs been an exhausting, expensive, and deeply demoralizing 24 hours. This project was already a leap of faith for us, and now it feels like we‚Äôre being tested in ways I didn‚Äôt expect. I know the ‚ÄúWelcome to SF, this is just how it is‚Äù attitude is real, but I‚Äôm not ready to accept that. I don‚Äôt want to become cynical.

To their credit, the developer of the property has stepped up. They hired 24/7 security on the spot and are now installing a full security system. I also met a few neighbors today, and they‚Äôve been incredibly supportive. We‚Äôre all asking the same question: What can we actually do about this? I want to believe there‚Äôs a way forward.

If you‚Äôve been in a similar position, I‚Äôd love to hear from you. How do you protect a space like this in San Francisco? How do you keep going when it feels like everything is working against you? I still believe in this opportunity, but I‚Äôd be lying if I said I wasn‚Äôt shaken.

Any advice, encouragement, or ideas would be genuinely appreciated.

1hg3fqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Discussion/comments/1hg3fqe/the_main_cause_of_america_loneliness_epidemic/,The Main Cause Of America Loneliness Epidemic.,"The loneliness epidemic in America is often blamed on cell phones and social media, but I believe the main culprit is the way our cities and suburbs are designed. In Europe, even outside the city centers, suburbs are far more walkable and connected. Public transportation is widely available, and while homes and backyards may be smaller and more compact, this trade-off creates communities where people can easily walk to shops, schools, and parks. In contrast, American suburbs prioritize larger houses and bigger backyards, but everything is far more spread out and isolated. Walkable neighborhoods are rare, especially outside major cities, because zoning laws in the U.S. don‚Äôt allow mixed-use spaces where residential, commercial, and recreational areas coexist.

This car-centric design creates significant barriers to social interaction. In Europe, a 16-year-old can bike to a friend‚Äôs house or take public transportation to the movies independently. This encourages young people to socialize, develop independence, and explore their communities. In America, teenagers often rely on their parents to drive them everywhere because biking or walking is not a safe or realistic option. Whether you‚Äôre driving five minutes to the grocery store or 40 minutes across town, you‚Äôre stuck using a car because there are no alternatives like sidewalks, bike lanes, or reliable public transportation. This not only creates congestion but also isolates individuals, especially those who don‚Äôt drive or simply can't afford a car.

Even neighborhoods that appear to be pedestrian-friendly with walking trails often feel empty and isolated. The problem is there‚Äôs nowhere meaningful to walk to that is within walking distance‚Äîno local stores, public spaces, or ""third places"" like caf√©s or community centers where people naturally gather and build relationships. When you walk around American suburbs, you rarely see neighbors interacting. This is partly because the environment isn‚Äôt designed to encourage it. For example, when I lived in the U.S., there was a movie theater and a trampoline park less than half a mile away, but my parents still had to drive us there because there were no sidewalks, and the roads were unsafe to cross on foot. Similarly, I‚Äôve seen neighborhoods where schools, houses, and parks sit close to each other on the same street, yet there are no sidewalks, forcing people to walk in the road, which is dangerous. In apartment complexes, restaurants or stores might be across the street, but high-speed traffic and poorly designed intersections make even a short walk feel unsafe and inaccessible.

In countries like Switzerland, kids bike to school and move around freely, learning independence and socializing with ease because the infrastructure supports it. In America, however, the reliance on cars limits opportunities for young people and adults alike to spontaneously interact or explore their communities. Walkable neighborhoods allow people to leave their homes more often and connect with others naturally. If you live in a walkable place where you can get to a coffee shop, park, or store on foot, you‚Äôre far more likely to go out and engage and natrually meet people from your local area   instead of spending the day indoors.

Ultimately, America‚Äôs car-centric urban design plays a major role in the loneliness epidemic. To address this, we need to rethink how we build our neighborhoods. Investing in sidewalks, safe bike lanes, and public transportation is essential to make communities more connected. Zoning laws should encourage mixed-use development, integrating homes with shops, parks, and public spaces to foster vibrant, walkable environments. By designing neighborhoods that prioritize people over cars, we can create healthier, more social communities where people naturally connect and feel less isolated.

EDITED 

Hi all‚Ä¶. 
So recently my fiance (26 M) kicked me (21 f) out of his truck while we were having an argument in the parking lot and won‚Äôt apologize to me for kicking me out of his truck. 
Am I in the wrong for wanting an apology on kicking me out?
Here‚Äôs the situation‚Ä¶.. I was hitting him playfully and he had asked me to stop but I did it one last time because I was just messing with him and didn‚Äôt think he would get upset‚Ä¶  he then got upset with me and we started arguing about it. 
My mom started calling me in the middle of the argument and I had to take the call because I still live with my parents and if I don‚Äôt take the call I would get seriously punished for it (long story) and if you are someone who understands Hispanic cultures and how parents are in the Hispanic community then you know what I‚Äôm talking about. 
so here I am talking on the phone with my mom on where she will be picking me up and he kept talking to me about the situation that just went down.
I was trying to focus on the phone conversation (important) and Since I can‚Äôt manage two conversations at once out of frustration I told him ‚Äúshut the fuck up‚Äù‚Ä¶ I hung up the phone since the conversation ended and then he looked at me angrily and kicked me out of the truck by just telling me ‚Äúget out of the truck‚Äù. 
It was pouring and I just looked outside and looked at him but he was very angry with me so I just grabbed my things and went inside the coffee shop that was lucky for me right in front of the car.

I‚Äôve been telling him to apologize for kicking me out of the truck and he refuses and doesn‚Äôt understand why he should apologize and says he won‚Äôt apologize because he isn‚Äôt in the wrong. 
I get it he isn‚Äôt wrong for getting upset with me on what I said and did to him but I think he went too far than needed by kicking me out of the truck‚Ä¶
I did apologize for hitting him and telling him what I did 

Do yall think he is in the right to not apologize to me or do I have a point in him apologizing for kicking me out?

Okay, so here‚Äôs the deal, I got my motorcycle license which encouraged my brother to get one too, then I bought an R7 as my starter bike which is around the top end of beginner motorcycles in terms of power while not reaching a 1000cc‚Äôs, my brother surprised me by also getting an R7. Now note I‚Äôve ridden bikes before and I do have an understanding of how they operate, I‚Äôve gotten my license and never failed due to my knowledge and I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm the best rider but I would say I‚Äôm above the average beginner slightly. My brother however is a complete beginner, he never rode. Him getting the bike was literally last week and I‚Äôve gotten my R7 about a month ago. 

Last night we went out riding with another friend and as we pulled up to a spot to have some coffee and relax he handed me his phone showing me he bought a S1000RR. 

My main reason for getting an R7 is because I know if I get a 1000cc bike right now I would probably kill myself because our roads here are almost perfect with 140km/h speed limit and long straight lines. So you get the idea of what I‚Äôll probably be doing And until I fully adjust to riding properly and managing to react to idiots on the road I‚Äôd rather be able to control what I‚Äôm riding. 

Now I‚Äôm very worried that my brother is going to start doing crazy shit with his new bike. I‚Äôm 100% he‚Äôll start speeding as he currently does with the R7 with no regard to actually being able to react and turn around cars if anyone cuts him off, I see him struggling to react when a car pulls in front of him, I see him struggle turning at 120km/h, I see him struggling at round abouts. 

I know I can‚Äôt convince him anymore because he already got the bike and I really really just wish and hope he drives safe. ",1,1734411772.0,motorcycles,11,1.0,False

I'm on mobile, so sorry for any formatting errors.
So here's some context I, 35 female, and my partner, 35 male, have been together for 12 years, married for four. 
I am disabled. I have two genetic mutations that cause me to continuously contract new and weird chronic illnesses. Currently, I'm at 8 and counting. I am also legally blind. I am currently a student because my health made it so I was unable to continue working as a barista (where I'm from coffee is a religion). So, going back to school and getting a degree that will allow me to find a job I can physically do is why I'm a student at 35. Unfortunately, after getting into my dream school, I have to take a medical leave of absence. In 2 months, I'm going to have a very intensive surgery with a recovery timeline of 6 months. In addition to that, I will have two other procedures happening within that time as well. All of this is why I am hesitant to leave my cheating douche canoe of a husband. 
I found out he was cheating on my birthday a week ago. So picture it, I'm making dinner on my birthday, well he is napping. We are both waiting for his friend to come by and visit so since he was asleep I grabbed his phone as I was running around and getting things ready I went to text his friend to go ahead and just give us a call as soon as he's here and that's when it happened. Me and my giant excuse of a thumb accidentally went and hit the chat thread below the one I was trying to, and that's when it hits me. Walls of texts about what's already happened, what they've been doing together on the on the phone, and what they're planning for the next time they can see each other. It was very specific and very graphic. 
So I do what any modern-day person does, I take screenshots from my phone of the chat on his phone. And then I go and try and figure out how am I going to pretend everything is normal when he wakes up from HIS nap on MY birthday so I decide I'm not going to react at all. I have a week of finals, and then it'll be Christmas, and there's just too much, so I kept quiet. But on Friday, I told him that I knew, and I asked him to leave for a week to give me time to figure out how we move forward. 
More than anything, I am upset that he not only lied to me and put me in medical risk but also that he's lied about himself for our whole relationship. 
Now I'm bisexual. My sister is bisexual. My nibblings are trans and non binary, which is why I'm confused and hurt that he cheated with a guy while telling me that he was straight. I don't know. It just has me questioning everything. I don't know if he is in the closet or  what.
 But 4 days ago I confronted him, he started to trickle-truth me. Initially, it was I was just flirting to try and get some money, then it was we just made out once, to I let him give me a blowjob then it was yes we did all of that. Then I asked him if he still even wanted this relationship, and he said he did and was willing to do anything.

Throwaway in case people involved are in Reddit

Me, (F23), got married to my husband about a year ago. It was wonderful and probably the happiest day of my life.

My family was involved with everything and I was delighted by it. Including my stepfather, who at first I had a somewhat rocky relationship with but I grew to appreciate him. His daughter (F26) is an entire different story. We can't get along. I've tried and I'm sure she also has, but it's not about being different, it's because she has always had very similar taste as me. We used to fight about our clothes, our toys and so on.

She has a relationship with a man whom I've got to know maybe 3 or 4 times. She announced her relationship with him during my wedding (which annoyed me at first, but I let it go since it was only a 20 second PSA), and became engaged just 4 months after that. Now, she has been planning her wedding and I've tried to help as much as I can since I already had most contacts fresh. She plans to marry a day after Christmas, so I thought everything was set and ready to go.

On Saturday, she calls me crying, saying that her wedding dress wouldn't arrive on time since she had some changes done. For some context, no one knows how this dress looks because she wanted to 'keep it a surprise for everyone', per her own words. I tried to comfort her and I told her I knew some cute boutiques who had nice wedding dresses ready for her date. She cries harder, telling me she didn't want any 'cheap' dress. I tried to calm her down once more before telling her I would call my stepdad to see what we could do. Before I could finish that sentence, she says out of the blue, 'Can I wear your dress?'

I didn't respond, because I didn't know how to. She goes on, explaining that it would make things less troubling, how she's the same size as me and how much she loved it the second she saw it on me. I don't know what possessed me to simply say 'No.' and hang up the phone. I've received multiple calls from her, her fiancee and my stepdad, who I did respond to. He pleaded to me to let her 'borrow' my wedding dress, 'just like when we were kids'. I tried to explain to him that my wedding dress was very special to me, and I wouldn't feel comfortable letting anyone else in it, unless it was my decision. He got super angry with me and hung up. My messages have been exploding with my stepsister, her soon-to-be husband and my stepdad telling me how horrible I am for being so selfish.

I know how my stepsister is. I know how dramatic and over the top she can be when she doesn't get her way. But there's a part of me that feels awful for not letting her wear it since it's just a dress and it would make her so happy. But there's that other part of me that remembers how my husband, my mom and I struggled to save for it because it was my dream dress, and I don't want to share something so personal with her. Should I just let her have it just so things don't escalate?

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: NTA, I‚Äôm calling shenanigans on your stepsister‚Äôs part. She probably had her eye on your dress since day one, probably commissioned a similar dress (if she even did) hence the surprise, and planned to use your dress as a backup if hers didn‚Äôt show up in time.

>**OOP:** i never wanted to assume things, but this is where i‚Äôm at too. i‚Äôll talk to her tomorrow and try figure things out.

***OOP is voted NTA***

UPDATE: I‚Äôll go see her now. I‚Äôll update when I get home.

**Update (Same Post): December 10, 2024 (Next Day)**

UPDATE 2: Well. That happened. I arrived at said coffee shop just in time. She took half an hour to get there.

I talked as gently as I could with her, explaining how I didn‚Äôt want her to wear my wedding dress and why, since it was so emotionally attached to me. She went absolutely nuts. She called me a selfish cow, telling me how I‚Äôm the most horrible human ever.

I tried to calm things down until I just couldn‚Äôt do it anymore. I knew this was a possibility, so as soon as she started crying, I pulled out her wedding invitation and gave it back to her. I told her I wouldn‚Äôt be attending the wedding, but I hoped it all went perfectly. Her voice couldn‚Äôt get louder at this point. She threatened to come to my house and take it from me.

I simply left the coffee shop without saying another word, and now I‚Äôm home.",134,1734411661.0,BestofRedditorUpdates,21,0.98,False

\-Build Quality  
The XM5 are fully made of plastic, and seem to be more fragile than the other 3, while the XM4 are mostly plastic they do have their details on the headband adjustment, while the QC Ultra have aluminum in their low headband part that attaches to the earcups, while the Momentum 4 have a fabric headband and a metal logo, for me the Sennheiser takes the win here, tho none of the 4 headphones are build quality focused like Airpods Max or B&W Px8

Winner : Sennheiser Momentum 4

\-Comfort  
Both the Sony and Bose headphones weight about 250g, while the Sennheiser weights about 290g, so they are heavier indeed, but their earpads feel SOOO COMFY, they have by far the comfiest earpads for me atleast, while also having a good spacious earcups, I feel the XM4 and XM5 quite the same, with more narrow space and comfy earpads, but the Bose do have the more spacious earcups + a good comfy earpads, so I feel better with the QC Ultra in long periods, while in the XM5 after some time get a little uncomfortable due their narrow headband and the Sennheiser feeling a little bit heavy.

Winner : Bose QC Ultra (Subjective)

\-Microphone  
The XM4 have by far the worst mic of this list, they are decent in silent places, tho they are not as good as you would expect for this type of headphones, but in loud and crowded places they just flop, they are just bad, the Momentum 4 are a little better both in quiet places and crowded places, and while the QC Ultra and XM5 perform pretty good, the QC Ultra are better in quiet conditions, but the XM5 arent bad at all, and the XM5 are better on crowded places and noisy conditions, while the QC Ultra are still good, but not that good.

Winner : Sony WH-1000XM5

\-App and features  
I would say that Bose have the worst app here, while not being bad at all, they do fall behind comparing them to these 3, with a 3 band eq and their basic features like head sensor, immersive audio and personalized modes, the Sennheiser app do have a 5 band eq + bass boost and podcast mode, with more features, like ""sound zones"" where you cand adjust anc and the eq depnding on where you are, auto off when returning them to the case and auto on when getting them out of the case and ""comfort call"" with a more natural feeling when making a call, but Sony clears here, 5 band eq + clear bass, ""speak to chat"", the charts of how much time you have used their headphones, auto play, adaptative sound control, adjusting the anc and transparency depending if you are walking, sitting or in a vehicle, they just win by far here.

Winner : Sony WH-1000XM5 / Sony WH-1000XM4

\-Battery life  
Sennheiser claims to have a 60h battery when anc on, Sony claims that both have 30h battery with anc on and 38h-40h when anc off and Bose claims to have 18h when immersive audio on and 24h when immersive audio off, with my testings, at high volume, ANC at max (85% at the Momentum 4) and AAC on all of them except on the XM5 (LDAC) and heres what I got...  
XM5 (LDAC) : 16h-20h  
XM5 (AAC) : 20h-24h  
QC Ultra (AAC) : 18h-22h  
XM4 (AAC) : 20h-24h  
XM4 (LDAC) : 14h-18h  
Momentum 4 (AAC) : 30h-35h  
The Sennheiser were far better, while the rest of them at my type of settings got all really close.

Winner : Sennheiser Momentum 4

\-Sound Quality  
All of them are bass heavy headphones (at their own way) so you will find a public focused sound and not an audiophile and full balanced focused sound tuning, for me, the Sennheiser Momentum 4 take the lead here, whithout touching eq they have something like xm5 bass, a little less maybe, less than xm4 and more than qc ultra, but right away you can say they are clearer than Sony headphones and with a better and more spacious and clean soundstage, now, with the bass boost on the app their bass hits even harder than the xm4 without loosing that much the mids and highs presence, they just sound top class, the XM4 and XM5 are pretty similar, with both heavy bass tuning (the XM4 have a little more bass) they have a decent soundstage and spaciousness, tho if you take their bass up you might find them to get muddy, the XM5 have a little better clarity due their little less bass, and the QC Ultra have a more flat sound among these 4, though not flat at all, their bass is more tight and not that present, their mids and highs are top, tho I bring their mids a little down in the eq, but their soundstage and separation is too good, above Sony I would say, overall I enjoy Sennheiser when listening most of the music, but while hearing spanish rock I like it more in the QC Ultra, but in hip-hop I take the XM4 and M4, and with 80s pop I take XM5 and M4, so it depends on your preferences and what you like to hear.

Winner : Sennheiser Momentum 4 (Subjective)

\-ANC  
I didnt test the Sennheiser that much A/B because they do fall behind, but they arent bad at ANC, they are decent, just nowhere near Sony and Bose level, now, with the xm4, xm5 and qc ultra I made some tests in real life and while reproducing different scenarios in my TV and this is what I got...

\-Test 1 (Airplane cabin simulation)  
When reproducing this sound on my TV, on the QC Ultra after waiting some seconds and getting that adaptive NC magic I couldnt hear the plane engine at all, while in the XM5 and XM4 I could still hear it, but like a 10%-15%, tho I didnt feel a difference between both of them, so thats a tie for Sony and a clear win for Bose

\-Test 2 (Coffee shop simulation)  
Things got closer here, tho the QC Ultra still outperforms Sony, it does by a very slight difference, here I could tell the XM5 were better than the XM4, cancelling more of those high frecuency noises, so the Bose was better, slightly above of the XM5, and finally the XM4 by a small difference.

\-Test 3 (Mall simulation)  
Here, the QC Ultra and XM5 was almost the same, the QC Ultra being a little better, the XM5 was almost the same, while the XM4 was also there, it was half of a step behind the Bose and XM5, QC Ultra and XM5 were pretty much the same level

\-Test 4 (Office simulation)  
Bose QC Ultra were quietter than both of the Sony headphones, while the XM5 was by a small difference worst they are pretty awesome, followed by the XM4 by also a small difference, Bose wins here again.

\-Test 5 (Mall in real life)  
Here is where Bose shines, I only could understand my dad voice that was in front of me, while all the background noise was cancelled by a 95% and that kids screaming and dogs barking cancelled by a 85%, it was trully impressive, followed by the XM5 making a incredible performance too! just probably worst than Bose by a 5%-10% difference, I cant tell about the XM4 due I havent tried them irl situations, Bose wins.  
  
\-Test 6 (Inside a car in real life)  
I couldnt say if the XM5 were better than the QC Ultra or all the way aroung, they both cancelled the music that the car was reproducing so good (maybe QC Ultra slightly better) and both cancelled the engine noise too good (maybe the XM5 a little better), but its a tie I would say here

Take in mind that Bose have a very slight white noise while ANC on, so that could make you feel they cancell better than the XM5, because the XM5 are dead silent without any white noise, but irl feeling talking, I felt the Bose were better than Sony tbh. (The XM4 also have a small white noise)

Winner : Bose QC Ultra

Transparency / Aware Mode  
The XM4 are the worst here, just like their Mic quality, they do lack and fall behind in this aspect, followed by M4 / XM5, both are pretty good tbh, I maybe would take XM5, and finally the QC Ultra, their aware mode is pretty damn good, I wouldnt say at APM level, but it isnt pretty far.

Winner : Bose QC Ultra

\-Case  
The best case are for the XM4, being the second smallest, having a small place inside for charging cables, airplane adapter and that 3.5mm cable with a hard surface that protects your headphones 100% and a pocket outside the case to put some papers (something that Bose dont have), followed by the QC Ultra with almost the smallest size case, a pocket for their cables, and a hard case too, followed by the Sennheiser Momentum 4, that are quite bigger (not that much), because they dont fold, but I like how they have a small pocket, and a specific place for their charging cable, airplane adapter and 3.5mm cable, if it wasnt for the size, they would be top 1, finally the XM5, similar size of Sennheiser (a little bigger), a magnetic part for that charging cable and the 3.5m cable, and a hard case that compacts when the headphones are out of their case, so it reduces depth mostly.

Winner : Sony WH-1000XM4

I love all my 3 headphones and also like the XM4, though they all have their strenghts and weaknesses, and every headphone its unic in their own way, I would say I like my Sennheiser most, due their sound, battery, looks and build and case, followed by the XM5 and followed by QC Ultra, I cant tell about the XM4 because they arent mine, but I like them pretty much too!  
Sennheiser Momentum 4 : Sound Quality (Better Overall), Battery Life, Design, Case, Build Quality  
Bose QC Ultra : Sound Quality (Cleaner and less bassy), Transparency, Mic Quality, ANC, Case, Build Quality  
Sony XM5 : Sound Quality (Bassy but with good clarity), Design, Transparency, Mic Quality, ANC, Features  
Sony XM4 : Sound Quality (Bassier with decent clarity), Case, ANC, Features

Thats it boys! hope I could help with this review! If you have any of these 4 you already have a Top ANC quality headphone, maybe with their strenghts and weaknesses, just like every other pair!

Cya and happy holidays yall ! :)

I needed some coffee and I did a google search of coffee shops nearby and I saw a place called roasted by mom on google. I thought they just roasted the coffee cause it is in industrial complex, apparently they do serve coffee based upon the reviews.

I walked in and was greeted by a woman who said she was the mom and the roaster. I got a latte and she was featuring her Holiday geisha as espresso. Anyway, we chatted a bit, got to know the history about her company and it was really awesome experience. I got an americano and it was really smooth. They do have two other coffee companies that roast in the same space which was neat. They have all their coffees beans for sale too. I'm surprised they don't have more business, i mean, they are hidden and not easy to find.

I wish i would have held off on buying coffee at new seasons, next coffee purchase i will pick up a bag of their geisha ( if they still have it) or the morning mayhem light roast.",13,1734411619.0,hillsboro,4,1.0,False

Every month we receive a document detailing profits and losses. There‚Äôs controllable expenses and non controllable expenses. 

We‚Äôre constantly pushed to ‚Äúmake labor‚Äù and cut hours when we‚Äôre going to be over labor. But we‚Äôre consistently understaffed when we follow the labor forecasts, because we may earn labor based on transactions, transaction types, etc. but we don‚Äôt earn labor to actually clean, etc. 

If we‚Äôre focused so desperately on labor, and we‚Äôre sending upwards of 60k in profits back to corporate each month, we‚Äôre considered successful.

Yet those profits will never return to us, the laborers. The fruit of our labor lines the pockets of the CEOs and higher ups. 

How do you explain to people that profits are actually worthless for us working class people? That you‚Äôre only ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù as a business because you‚Äôre sending money back to corporate. Because‚Ä¶ we could increase wages, we could increase hours worked, laborers on the floor, and we would STILL send huge profits each month to the company. 


Also‚Ä¶ even though I‚Äôm getting paid ‚Äúmore‚Äù for this position as a manager, it‚Äôs making me sicker and sicker of capitalism. Because it has made me realize that all we are is a tool to bring in more profits. And managing has made me become the bad guy I so hate‚Äîbecause everything I do goes against my values.

1hg353n,https://www.reddit.com/r/bose/comments/1hg353n/qc_ultra_vs_wh1000xm5_vs_wh1000xm4_vs_momentum_4/,QC Ultra vs WH-1000XM5 vs WH-1000XM4 vs Momentum 4,"Hi there, I have owned my XM5 since Saturday and already got the chance to try them deeply in every of their aspects, I do also own the Bose QC Ultra and Sennheiser Momentum 4, plus my dad have the XM4 so he let me do some comparisons too, and this is what I got when comparing them!

\-Build Quality  
The XM5 are fully made of plastic, and seem to be more fragile than the other 3, while the XM4 are mostly plastic they do have their details on the headband adjustment, while the QC Ultra have aluminum in their low headband part that attaches to the earcups, while the Momentum 4 have a fabric headband and a metal logo, for me the Sennheiser takes the win here, tho none of the 4 headphones are build quality focused like Airpods Max or B&W Px8

Winner : Sennheiser Momentum 4

\-Comfort  
Both the Sony and Bose headphones weight about 250g, while the Sennheiser weights about 290g, so they are heavier indeed, but their earpads feel SOOO COMFY, they have by far the comfiest earpads for me atleast, while also having a good spacious earcups, I feel the XM4 and XM5 quite the same, with more narrow space and comfy earpads, but the Bose do have the more spacious earcups + a good comfy earpads, so I feel better with the QC Ultra in long periods, while in the XM5 after some time get a little uncomfortable due their narrow headband and the Sennheiser feeling a little bit heavy.

Winner : Bose QC Ultra (Subjective)

\-Microphone  
The XM4 have by far the worst mic of this list, they are decent in silent places, tho they are not as good as you would expect for this type of headphones, but in loud and crowded places they just flop, they are just bad, the Momentum 4 are a little better both in quiet places and crowded places, and while the QC Ultra and XM5 perform pretty good, the QC Ultra are better in quiet conditions, but the XM5 arent bad at all, and the XM5 are better on crowded places and noisy conditions, while the QC Ultra are still good, but not that good.

Winner : Sony WH-1000XM5

\-App and features  
I would say that Bose have the worst app here, while not being bad at all, they do fall behind comparing them to these 3, with a 3 band eq and their basic features like head sensor, immersive audio and personalized modes, the Sennheiser app do have a 5 band eq + bass boost and podcast mode, with more features, like ""sound zones"" where you cand adjust anc and the eq depnding on where you are, auto off when returning them to the case and auto on when getting them out of the case and ""comfort call"" with a more natural feeling when making a call, but Sony clears here, 5 band eq + clear bass, ""speak to chat"", the charts of how much time you have used their headphones, auto play, adaptative sound control, adjusting the anc and transparency depending if you are walking, sitting or in a vehicle, they just win by far here.

Winner : Sony WH-1000XM5 / Sony WH-1000XM4

\-Battery life  
Sennheiser claims to have a 60h battery when anc on, Sony claims that both have 30h battery with anc on and 38h-40h when anc off and Bose claims to have 18h when immersive audio on and 24h when immersive audio off, with my testings, at high volume, ANC at max (85% at the Momentum 4) and AAC on all of them except on the XM5 (LDAC) and heres what I got...  
XM5 (LDAC) : 16h-20h  
XM5 (AAC) : 20h-24h  
QC Ultra (AAC) : 18h-22h  
XM4 (AAC) : 20h-24h  
XM4 (LDAC) : 14h-18h  
Momentum 4 (AAC) : 30h-35h  
The Sennheiser were far better, while the rest of them at my type of settings got all really close.

Winner : Sennheiser Momentum 4

\-Sound Quality  
All of them are bass heavy headphones (at their own way) so you will find a public focused sound and not an audiophile and full balanced focused sound tuning, for me, the Sennheiser Momentum 4 take the lead here, whithout touching eq they have something like xm5 bass, a little less maybe, less than xm4 and more than qc ultra, but right away you can say they are clearer than Sony headphones and with a better and more spacious and clean soundstage, now, with the bass boost on the app their bass hits even harder than the xm4 without loosing that much the mids and highs presence, they just sound top class, the XM4 and XM5 are pretty similar, with both heavy bass tuning (the XM4 have a little more bass) they have a decent soundstage and spaciousness, tho if you take their bass up you might find them to get muddy, the XM5 have a little better clarity due their little less bass, and the QC Ultra have a more flat sound among these 4, though not flat at all, their bass is more tight and not that present, their mids and highs are top, tho I bring their mids a little down in the eq, but their soundstage and separation is too good, above Sony I would say, overall I enjoy Sennheiser when listening most of the music, but while hearing spanish rock I like it more in the QC Ultra, but in hip-hop I take the XM4 and M4, and with 80s pop I take XM5 and M4, so it depends on your preferences and what you like to hear.

Winner : Sennheiser Momentum 4 (Subjective)

\-ANC  
I didnt test the Sennheiser that much A/B because they do fall behind, but they arent bad at ANC, they are decent, just nowhere near Sony and Bose level, now, with the xm4, xm5 and qc ultra I made some tests in real life and while reproducing different scenarios in my TV and this is what I got...

\-Test 1 (Airplane cabin simulation)  
When reproducing this sound on my TV, on the QC Ultra after waiting some seconds and getting that adaptive NC magic I couldnt hear the plane engine at all, while in the XM5 and XM4 I could still hear it, but like a 10%-15%, tho I didnt feel a difference between both of them, so thats a tie for Sony and a clear win for Bose

\-Test 2 (Coffee shop simulation)  
Things got closer here, tho the QC Ultra still outperforms Sony, it does by a very slight difference, here I could tell the XM5 were better than the XM4, cancelling more of those high frecuency noises, so the Bose was better, slightly above of the XM5, and finally the XM4 by a small difference.

\-Test 3 (Mall simulation)  
Here, the QC Ultra and XM5 was almost the same, the QC Ultra being a little better, the XM5 was almost the same, while the XM4 was also there, it was half of a step behind the Bose and XM5, QC Ultra and XM5 were pretty much the same level

\-Test 4 (Office simulation)  
Bose QC Ultra were quietter than both of the Sony headphones, while the XM5 was by a small difference worst they are pretty awesome, followed by the XM4 by also a small difference, Bose wins here again.

\-Test 5 (Mall in real life)  
Here is where Bose shines, I only could understand my dad voice that was in front of me, while all the background noise was cancelled by a 95% and that kids screaming and dogs barking cancelled by a 85%, it was trully impressive, followed by the XM5 making a incredible performance too! just probably worst than Bose by a 5%-10% difference, I cant tell about the XM4 due I havent tried them irl situations, Bose wins.  
  
\-Test 6 (Inside a car in real life)  
I couldnt say if the XM5 were better than the QC Ultra or all the way aroung, they both cancelled the music that the car was reproducing so good (maybe QC Ultra slightly better) and both cancelled the engine noise too good (maybe the XM5 a little better), but its a tie I would say here

Take in mind that Bose have a very slight white noise while ANC on, so that could make you feel they cancell better than the XM5, because the XM5 are dead silent without any white noise, but irl feeling talking, I felt the Bose were better than Sony tbh. (The XM4 also have a small white noise)

Winner : Bose QC Ultra

Transparency / Aware Mode  
The XM4 are the worst here, just like their Mic quality, they do lack and fall behind in this aspect, followed by M4 / XM5, both are pretty good tbh, I maybe would take XM5, and finally the QC Ultra, their aware mode is pretty damn good, I wouldnt say at APM level, but it isnt pretty far.

Winner : Bose QC Ultra

\-Case  
The best case are for the XM4, being the second smallest, having a small place inside for charging cables, airplane adapter and that 3.5mm cable with a hard surface that protects your headphones 100% and a pocket outside the case to put some papers (something that Bose dont have), followed by the QC Ultra with almost the smallest size case, a pocket for their cables, and a hard case too, followed by the Sennheiser Momentum 4, that are quite bigger (not that much), because they dont fold, but I like how they have a small pocket, and a specific place for their charging cable, airplane adapter and 3.5mm cable, if it wasnt for the size, they would be top 1, finally the XM5, similar size of Sennheiser (a little bigger), a magnetic part for that charging cable and the 3.5m cable, and a hard case that compacts when the headphones are out of their case, so it reduces depth mostly.

Winner : Sony WH-1000XM4

I love all my 3 headphones and also like the XM4, though they all have their strenghts and weaknesses, and every headphone its unic in their own way, I would say I like my Sennheiser most, due their sound, battery, looks and build and case, followed by the XM5 and followed by QC Ultra, I cant tell about the XM4 because they arent mine, but I like them pretty much too!  
Sennheiser Momentum 4 : Sound Quality (Better Overall), Battery Life, Design, Case, Build Quality  
Bose QC Ultra : Sound Quality (Cleaner and less bassy), Transparency, Mic Quality, ANC, Case, Build Quality  
Sony XM5 : Sound Quality (Bassy but with good clarity), Design, Transparency, Mic Quality, ANC, Features  
Sony XM4 : Sound Quality (Bassier with decent clarity), Case, ANC, Features

Thats it boys! hope I could help with this review! If you have any of these 4 you already have a Top ANC quality headphone, maybe with their strenghts and weaknesses, just like every other pair!

I'm on mobile, so sorry for any formatting errors.
So here's some context I, 35 female, and my partner, 35 male, have been together for 12 years, married for four. 
I am disabled. I have two genetic mutations that cause me to continuously contract new and weird chronic illnesses. Currently, I'm at 8 and counting. I am also legally blind. I am currently a student because my health made it so I was unable to continue working as a barista (where I'm from coffee is a religion). So, going back to school and getting a degree that will allow me to find a job I can physically do is why I'm a student at 35. Unfortunately, after getting into my dream school, I have to take a medical leave of absence. In 2 months, I'm going to have a very intensive surgery with a recovery timeline of 6 months. In addition to that, I will have two other procedures happening within that time as well. All of this is why I am hesitant to leave my cheating douche canoe of a husband. 
I found out he was cheating on my birthday a week ago. So picture it, I'm making dinner on my birthday, well he is napping. We are both waiting for his friend to come by and visit so since he was asleep I grabbed his phone as I was running around and getting things ready I went to text his friend to go ahead and just give us a call as soon as he's here and that's when it happened. Me and my giant excuse of a thumb accidentally went and hit the chat thread below the one I was trying to, and that's when it hits me. Walls of texts about what's already happened, what they've been doing together on the on the phone, and what they're planning for the next time they can see each other. It was very specific and very graphic. 
So I do what any modern-day person does, I take screenshots from my phone of the chat on his phone. And then I go and try and figure out how am I going to pretend everything is normal when he wakes up from HIS nap on MY birthday so I decide I'm not going to react at all. I have a week of finals, and then it'll be Christmas, and there's just too much, so I kept quiet. But on Friday, I told him that I knew, and I asked him to leave for a week to give me time to figure out how we move forward. 
More than anything, I am upset that he not only lied to me and put me in medical risk but also that he's lied about himself for our whole relationship. 
Now I'm bisexual. My sister is bisexual. My nibblings are trans and non binary, which is why I'm confused and hurt that he cheated with a guy while telling me that he was straight. I don't know. It just has me questioning everything. I don't know if he is in the closet or  what.
 But 4 days ago I confronted him, he started to trickle-truth me. Initially, it was I was just flirting to try and get some money, then it was we just made out once, to I let him give me a blowjob then it was yes we did all of that. Then I asked him if he still even wanted this relationship, and he said he did and was willing to do anything. 
But I know myself, and I know that I can't forgive this. Here's where I might be the asshole with my surgeries and procedures coming up none of my family will be not able to be with me constantly as I recover and having him here will help immeasurably. Right now, my plan is to act like we're working on the relationship while planning an exit strategy. Does this make me as bad as him for lying about this?",1,1734411133.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

I met her three months ago. And we got along very well from the start, we know each other from school and reconnected after years of haven't seen eachother.

She expressed interest in me and wanted to drink a coffee together and I agreed. I didn't think much of it at the time. Before we met she expressed feeling nervous meeting me.

Some time passed and I started to see her in a romantic way and we expressed liking eachother. That was when she told me about her bpd and said I should inform myself if I want to get to know her better. And she said she doesn't want me to think she isn't interested in me when she acts different.

Then a few weeks ago she got into rehab, I knew this is a very stressful time for her because she didn't text me alot. Then we texted a bit and during this time I expressed my feelings for her and she rejected me.

I just so confused because she already said she likes me, I just ask myself if it is bad timing because of her rehab. I really do love her and it seemed she did too but now she just said that she doesn't have any feelings for me.

\-Destroying and rebuilding the government of Japan at the age of one day.

\-Performing a successful brain surgery on Sawaragi with his right hand while at the same time successfully performing a brain surgery on himself with his left hand after being shot in the head, all while also making coffee for his friends using his feet.

\-Deceiving an omniscient AI by resetting his memory every picosecond and rewriting his own consciousness from nothing 10^(120) times.

\-Perceiving and processing every single aspect of physical phenomena like atmospheric noise, thermal noise, and cosmic background radiation to accurately predict the numbers generated by the random number generator in the Weak-willed Friendship Game arc. Since the random number generator used natural entropy to generate random values, Yuuichi was able to calculate its behavior to win the game.

\-Conditioning a total stranger into perfectly acting as his double in just thirty minutes in the All-Stars Show qualifier round. Yuuichi managed to create a perfect actor out of a person he has never met and then used them to influence the votes of other contestants.

Leading up to the diagnosis, I suffered a lot of pelvic pain. I went to several doctors & gynecologists for 5 years trying to pin down what was causing the pain. Also wound up in the ER a handful of times with severe pelvic pain that I couldn‚Äôt even breathe. Left the ER every time with no answers. I had to change doctors due to insurance changes. During the initial physical where I was feeling very well; the doctor pressed down on my pelvis region and I yelped, and the pain knocked the wind out of me where I was tearing up & crying. The doctor said, ‚Äúsomething‚Äôs not right‚Äù and sent me to a gynecologist who specializes in treating urology. He did the exam, and I had the same reaction. Did an internal ultrasound, found a large fibroid. He set me up for surgery to have it removed. It was just before my surgery, he asked me more questions‚Ä¶ where he said ‚ÄúI have a hunch, if you‚Äôll let me add in a cystoscopy with this surgery‚Äù‚Ä¶ I said ‚Äúwhatever it takes to find answers, please‚Äù üôè He found that I have IC. I‚Äôd never in my life heard of it before. 

The first couple months were challenging with the required dietary changes. No coffee, tea, chocolate, tomatoes, lemons, soy‚Ä¶. y‚Äôall know the list of foods we can‚Äôt have. Coffee & tea was the most difficult for me to give up. I‚Äôm a Southern Belle and I wasn‚Äôt gonna lose my ‚ÄúSouthern Card‚Äù saying I don‚Äôt drink sweet tea, right? 

I also was prescribed Elmiron, which insurance doesn‚Äôt cover‚Ä¶ and was $400/mo!! However, after taking it for 5 months, I couldn‚Äôt bear the side effects of losing my hair & the chronic headaches‚Ä¶ as well as going broke with a medication that cost more than my car payments. 

Dietary changes, through elimination & reintroduction, over time became a nutrition lifestyle. I learned my biggest triggers were tomatoes, lemons, soy, stress, tea, soda and aspartame (or any fake sugar). I have one cup of coffee every morning with creamer to cut the acidity. I eat a lot healthier now, a lot less processed foods because we know soy preservatives are usually in processed & frozen foods. 

It‚Äôs been almost 10 years now and i hardly have any pain flare ups as long as I avoid those no-no foods & drinks. I drink a lot of water. 

I‚Äôm writing in because many newly diagnosed IC‚Äôers feel hopeless, having no cure for IC. I‚Äôm saying you CAN decrease pain & flare ups by dietary changes. I know some IC‚Äôers never successfully reduce the pain below 3-4 on the pain scale‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just saying that the HOPE is there. It IS POSSIBLE to live comfortably having IC. My heart goes out to all of my fellow IC people. ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè",8,1734410571.0,Interstitialcystitis,0,1.0,False

Amanda & I started to talk about are problems & why we""re here she told about how she lost  custody of her kids to Kim, then I told her about my expierience with Kim & his cronies. We both had shared cabins & started our friendship from there. The next day Leo's wife Anna served me & Amanda with a nice delicious breakfast, I opened up Leo & Anna about my issues with Amanda's ex husband. I told them what that pig did to me & how he ruiend my life. Luckly I recorded every   phone call & threatning messages. Leo then spoke "" You know I have delt corruption before, I might help you out. It'll take time"" ""Take as much time as you need"" I said. Anna then spoke & said ""You poor man why would anyone do that, & what about your wife Zoe?"" I then say, I don't know, she made it clear that wants nothing to do with me?"" ""Well, think you're luck because I think there's some one here that will be a good match for you"" Anna said glancing at Amanda. She the blushes

As weeks go by Amanda & I were getting closer & closer, I don't know If I'm falling in love but Amanda was showing signs of her feeling the same but she's been my comfort buddy. As we were laying in bed in our cabin I couldn't sleep thinking of my kids & distroyed marriage & life I began to cry. Amanda noticed, ""Chris, are you ok?"" Amanda said. I spilled everything she already knew while breaking down but Amanda comforted me. ""It's ok Chris, I know it hurts but you'll be ok, you'll get through this I'm here for you Amanda said. Suddenly we started kissing Amanda then spoke ""OMG Chris I'm so sorry I don't know what came over me I...."" I then kiss her back ""It's ok"" I replyed we then made love. 
The next morning we both wake up, while Amanda does her morning routine I thouggt of we she said I should take control. 

While we eat breakfast Leo introduced me to his lawyer who help out with his divorce from his ex wife & others that helped him & Anna out. One of the lawyers spoke ""hello, my is Frank!"" Nice to meet you"" I said ""I here we have a case of a corrupt cop, correct?"" Frank said ""Yes!"" I replyed. ""And it's a Officer Kim, correct?"" Frank said ""Yes"" I replyed. ""Well, Officer Kim has a pattern of corruption, he has the chief of the LAPD in his pocket."" Frank proceeds. ""He's blackmailing the chief of police with some unspeakable things"" Frank then shows me what Kim is blackmailing the the cheif with brought by his P.I. ""Jesus"" I said He then moves on to Ananda, she layed everthing out & showed Frank long saved evidence that was dismissed by a judge that was on Kim's payroll. God, this officer Kim needs to be stopped with everything shown we all came up with a plan. 

I call my parents back in Aspen CO & told them about were I am & to come visit The phone call was untraceable so Kim doesn't track me. They're then welcomed by Leo. I did say they lost there jobs in internal affairs well not exaclly, It was to get Kim away from my parrents. They still in internal affairs & have saved evidence that will work they were just laying low. Frank has a good judge that is not in Kims pocket. We discuss our plans to get justice for me & for Amanda. Me & Amanda were already a couple While we were making love I say ""Listen Amanda,, Kim will problbly arrest when we arrive in L.A. but we'll both get justice for us. ""Baby, I'm scared what he'll do, I don't wanna lose you"" Amanda says. ""Don't worry gorgeous everything is going to be alright"" I then kiss her forhead assuring her till she falls asleep.
 This pig ruined my marriage, my life,took away my childrean & threatend the life of my parents, no mare this pig will pay. 

Now let's see Amanda's perspective.

Three weeks later Me, Chris & his parents depart from the lodge saying good bye to Anna & Leo. Chris's plan had me worried with him wearing that orange jumpsuit but he assures me that it's going to be alright, it's all part of the plan. It turns out Kim has my babies Jake & Bridgette hostage to hurt me & with what he did to Chris, I swear, Kim is such a A Hole he ruined so many lives but all that will be settled in court. As we land, Kim looks at us with that stupid smug smirk as if he's not punchable enough. Chris is then loaded into Kim's cruiser taken to the station. We're also taken to the station. That's when everthing goes to plan. 
""Officer Kim!"" A server says. ""Yes!"" He says. ""You've been served"" Kim then flips & his cronies are also served. Kim then says ""You all think you can do this to me, you can't distroy me, I'm the LAPD, I'm this department, I AM THE LAW"" God litsen to him he's such an arragont prick. 

We then sit in the courtroom. Kims lawyer spins the story saying the charges on Chris are justifieble & that Chris is a menece to society & that Kim was protecting Zoe. Then Zoe spills her BS story of him being abusive. But the evidence was damning all the manipulation, threats, wrongfull arrests & the shooting of Chris's parents house. I then testify against Kim. I explain that he also kept me away from my childrean & that he threatened to have arrested or killed. Chris's parents now back in internal affairs uncover years of Kim's abuse of power & athority, racketering, extortion, drug traficking, attempted murder & wrongfull arrest more witnesses come up with more stories of there ordeal with Kim. Chris's ex wife admits in court that she was force into this but Chris doesn't believe a word of it. She also claimed that Kim made her set up the restraining order threatning to leave if she doesn't accept. The judge throws the book at Kim, ""Officer Kim, your actions against the plaintiff is unacceptable for the police department you have shown this that your nothing but an abbusive deplorable police officer & that you don't deserve that badge as if right now I strip you from your badge & sentence you to life in prison in without the possibility of parole & that goes to the rest of your 2 men!"" And as for you miss Zoe Jensen I sentence you to 30 years in the state prison for your involvememt in this crime against the palntiff. This court is ajurned!"" The judge says as he slams the gavel hard and it was all over. Kim tries to beg us for mercy but it was just pathetic. Chris then chages his identity for a clean record because society is such b**ch when it comes to having arrest record, god I hate society sometimes he also gets his custody of his kds back with the restraing order lifted & I also got my babies back. His kids get along so well with mine & all became best friends

After all of that Chris & I start our lives over in Aspen. Chris & I were working on our horses in his farm when he get's down on one knee & says, ""Amanda from the moment I met I never thought we'd have a common enemy & how both of us were hurt by an abusive athoritative figure that ruined our lives, you are my rock that kept balenced give me a reason to keep pushing when things get, you comfort me when I need you the most, & you're the most beautiful women I've ever met, so Amanda James Parker, will you be wife?""
With tears in my eyes I screech saying, ""YES, YES A THOUSAND TIMES YES"" I tackle to the ground kissing him all over. 

Chris & I get married with a small intimate wedding with just his parents & his ex wifes parents since my dad passed away when I was 15 & my mom that caused his death is god knows were which a story for another time. They up to Chris for forgiveness with what happend with daughter & what she did, Chris didn't at first but he came around. We then say our vows & I start to speak. ""Chris James Parker I just want to say you're the best thing that's ever happend to me I've been through so much in my life, but you were there to give me comfort & you make me feel so loved & desired & you also give me the most wonderful gift in the world, you're the man for me, I love you Chris!"" and so we live our together 

Years later I hear a knock at the door. Randy now 14 is shocked to see his mom. ""Mom"" Randy says  ""Hey sweaty, how are you"" Zoe says I welcome her in & offer her tea or coffee. ""Coffee will be nice, thank you"" she replies Just then Chris walks in & says to Zoe. ""Zoe, what are you doing here"" ""I've done so many bad things to you so I need closure"" I then bring her coffee & we started speaking ""What happend to you Zoe, all i ever did love you, & you go along with thr distruction of my life. He said. Zoe over the phone said, ""He made me do it, I just really needed it I couldn't help myself. ""NO YOU MADE YOUR CHOICE, you could've come up to me & told me what was going on, but you divorce me & kept me away from Randy & Annie"" Chris said. ""Im sorry Chris I just I don't why I did what I did, but..but she stuttered. ""Gosh Zoe, I really loved you, now I might never understand why you did what you did. I'm not going to keep you away from Randy, but I'll never forgive you"" Chris said. ""I know & I'm sorry"" Zoe said. A few minutes later Zoe makes an exit. Just know I never ment for any of this to happen & I'm sorry Chris. Good bye Randy, be good for dad now I love you & you to Chris"" She said. Chris & Randy both srart to cry but I comfort them both. ""Randy sweaty your mother will always love even though she is not here but I'll be here for you & always refer to as my son"" I said to Randy. ""Thanks mom"" I kiss his forhead, then I go to Chris. ""Honey, I'll never ever going leave, all always be here not going nowhere handsome I love you"". I then hug them both then his sister & my kids Jake & Bridgette follow suit & we live happy for the rest of the years come.

1hg2tr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1hg2tr9/how_do_i_get_over_this/,how do i get over this?,"i dated the most amazing, sweet, sensitive guy for just under a year and a half. i loved him more than life. i thought he loved me the same way.

close to a year into our relationship we started arguing frequently. my mental health had never been something i was well equipped to dealing with, i struggled with eating, regulating my emotions, expressing my emotions, etc., and as i was going through a rough time the only thing in the entire world i wanted to do was spend time with my boyfriend. we saw each other all the but when we didn‚Äôt i freaked out. i was so insecure and the only way i felt like he loved me was when he was actively with me, this mindset wasn‚Äôt helped when i saw texts between him and his best friend saying horrible things about me. i cried and cried and my boyfriend cried too, telling me how sorry he was, and we moved on with our lives, but i could never really forget it. i was constantly struggling with this voice in the back of my head worried everyone he would talk to secretly hated me, and it made me act out in horrible ways when we were together. i was selfish and demanding and constantly breaking down and i had no idea how to fix it. i just loved him and i wanted to be with him, he made me feel okay. he made me feel like my life wasn‚Äôt falling apart. 

our arguments kept getting worse. it felt like nothing i said mattered to him, he made me feel like my feelings were an inconvenience and it just made me freak out even more. i cried to him so many times ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt you just love me, i‚Äôm trying so hard to get you to love me and nothing i do matters‚Äù. and he would console me and the cycle would repeat. 

eventually it reached the end. after he attempted to break up with me over text hundreds of miles away, and i protested and cried, he conceded and unbeknownst just moved the date of his plan forward for when he would be coming back. he gave me just about a hundred rules i had to follow if i wanted to stay with him, and i listened and i promised i was getting the help i needed, which i was. and still he called me over to his house a few days after he landed. everything i had ever given him was in a pile on his bed. my stomach instantly dropped, i tried to play it off, tried to tidy it up saying i understood it might be hard to look at right now and we could just move slowly, that was okay with me. shortly into our visit i was so nervous i started throwing up in his bathroom. in between breaths and tears i told him i was so sorry, that i tried to look pretty for him that day. he rubbed my back the whole time and told me i was still the prettiest girl in the entire world to him. he wouldn‚Äôt let me kiss him. he played games with me to calm my nerves, he cuddled with me and fed me fresh fruit because he knows its the only thing i can stomach, and we watched dexter because he wanted to introduce me to it. then he said it, it was over and he couldn‚Äôt do it anymore, and obviously i started throwing up again. he was the only one crying. i tried to reason with him, i told him i understand how wrong i was and that i was sorry i let my mental health hurt him so bad. it didn‚Äôt matter.

and then he had sex with me. we laid skin to skin for hours, i was searching for any type of connection i could keep with him. i felt so nauseous but all i wanted was to keep him there with me. he still sent me home with everything i had ever bought him. 

he saw me crying with our friends and ignored me for an hour, but as soon as he left he gained awareness i suppose and texted me asking if i was okay. obviously i was not. he maintained contact with me, getting colder and colder. i asked if i was annoying him and he said ‚Äúthe more you ask me that the more true it becomes‚Äù, and that cut deep. i dropped off all the stuff i had at his house a little over a month after, and he texted me the security footage of me dropping it off and the pictures of everything i‚Äôd given him, saying he cried. he needed to remember that there were good times between us too. he was so grateful i reminded him of those memories. i couldn‚Äôt eat anything for a month after we broke up. 

i tried to talk to him more than once about the end of our relationship and he cut me out every time. he would be my friend one day, calling me for hours at night, and then act like i didn‚Äôt exist the next day. he wore the necklace i bought him every day. he wore the beaded bracelets we made, the ones i bought him for our one year anniversary, and still he treated me like all he wanted to do was forget me.

months after we broke up i left a voicemail, i admit in bad taste, sobbing to him, telling him i don‚Äôt know why i still love him when he treats me like garbage every day. he acted like i was crazy for suggesting we go out for coffee after he had invited me over to his house for effing peanut butter the day before.

he no contacted me after that. i was okay for a while, coping in a healthy manner for probably the first time in my life. i feel okay now, i‚Äôm not stressed out all the time anymore, im not scared of being alone anymore, i‚Äôm okay without him.

but i‚Äôm finding myself missing us in the middle of the night. 

i miss laying in your bed. i miss how well our bodies fit together, it was like we were made for each other. i miss when you used to ask me to lay on top of you, you liked the weight and i liked burying my face into your neck. i miss sitting in your dining room watching house m.d. while your parents watched friends in the next room. i miss your moms cooking. i‚Äôm sorry i asked all those times if we could just eat in your room, because i honestly miss being a part of your family more. I‚Äôm sorry i pulled away from being a more active part of your life. i got so nervous when we were in the vicinity of your parents and i was just so stressed out i felt like i could only deal with what was familiar to me. i wish i had tried a little harder. i miss playing games with you. i remember the first time our parents let us skip school together, it was because we just wanted to play mario 3d world. we were obsessed for weeks, i was so bad at the game, but i was so in love with you. i miss when you used to cry at the thought of losing me. i miss the very first time i bought you something, a bunch of stupid pajama clothes and sweatpants because all of the ones you owned were dated, and you cried when we got inside. i held you while you thanked me over and over, telling me no one had ever done that for you before. i tried so hard to give you so many gifts after that. i wrote you letters every month, i only painted you about a dozen times. i studied your face so i‚Äôd remember the layout of your freckles. your eyelashes were always so much prettier than mine. i miss the way you used to hold me when i cried, back before you gave up on us. my nose always got so runny with my tears, and you laughed at me when i wiped my face on your shirt. i miss putting christmas lights up on your tree, and i even miss going to church with your family on christmas eve, even though the entire thing was in spanish and i don‚Äôt speak a word of it, but i tried so hard to learn for you. i just loved you, i thought we were going to be forever, i would‚Äôve given you the world if you had asked me for it. i know you won‚Äôt ever miss me the way i miss you, and it‚Äôs my fault. i don‚Äôt want you to remember me as the person i was in my worst moments. i don‚Äôt remember you that way, even though it would be easier if i did. i wish i was someone worth missing to you. i wish you still loved me. i don‚Äôt know if i still love you, but i do love what we used to have, and i love the person you used to be. i‚Äôm so scared i ruined you, infected you with the poison that was in my head. maybe that‚Äôs why you started acting so cruel towards me, because the boy i asked out wouldn‚Äôt have treated me the way you did. and i miss you anyway.

First time travelling internationally, first time alone. I went to London to visit an online friend. In the months leading up to the trip I was so excited and people in my life were excited for me. Every time they asked me ""so what are you going to do there?"" I wouldn't really have an answer, I just felt like going. I only really thought of a few big places like Buckingham Palace and stuff to go to but I really had no interest in doing it, it was more like chores, like this is something people want you to do.
3 days in it dawns on me that I have no idea what I'm doing, I am homesick beyond belief, I am depressed with everything, I can't sleep even if I stay up for 24 hours straight pure adrenaline and overthinking will keep me up until 8am and then I crash when the sun comes up.
2 weeks in and I've lost all my money. I helped with friends rent and made some other dumb oversights and now I will be returning home broke. I had no fun, a lot of social anxiety, no decent food, some good coffees. Last night I was feeling depressed and some dude in my hostel was being really aggressive trying to get me to do coke with him and I lied about meeting a friend and then sat in Mcdonalds for 3 hours spiraling about how much of an infantile piece of garbage I am. I kept thinking maybe that was the door of life opening and I closed it. But nah I dont want to have that guilt or that lack of self control. I did everything wrong for my first trip. Country I had no real interest in, booked too long, non changeable ticket, didnt bring melatonin, didnt bring noise cancelling headphones, lost my ID, lost my sim card thats connected to my bank account, didnt leave my friends flat or hostel for days at a time because I was anxious or tired, didnt go on a train anywhere outside the city like I wanted to. I was the same person at home. Tired deadbeat unable to see joy in anything but also skiddish, I run from people and their social interactions because I cause nothing but sadness and worry. I want to go home. I love home. And I should be medicated. This has been nothing but a 1000 dollar reminder of those things. Im worried about what I'll do after failing this miserably and this drastically. I'm worried about how long I can lie about having a nice time before I yell at somebody. 
I might be the stupidest person on earth. So many horrible oversights. I was so cheerful booking the trip, I had a vision of myself just going off and doing stuff but not specific stuff, it was just a vague image of myself being happy.

I just got back from an incredible Grand Canyon South Rim bus tour from Las Vegas, and I need to share this experience with you all. If you're planning a Vegas trip, this is absolutely worth adding to your itinerary.

I researched a ton of tours before picking this one, and honestly, it turned out to be the perfect choice. For $80, you get a full 14-hour adventure that takes care of everything - transportation, meals, and an awesome guide who actually knows their stuff.

The morning started with a hotel pickup (super convenient), and we headed out in this comfy bus with AC and a bathroom (trust me, you'll appreciate this on a long trip). Our first break was in Kingman, Arizona, where I grabbed some coffee and snacks.

The real magic happened when we reached the South Rim. Guys, photos don't do this place justice. We stopped at several viewpoints, including Mather Point and Bright Angel Point. Each spot offers a completely different perspective of the canyon - it's mind-blowing how the colors and shadows change throughout the day.

Pro tip: If you've got some extra cash, definitely consider the upgrades. I splurged on the helicopter ride (25 minutes), and holy cow... seeing the canyon from above is a whole different ballgame. There's also a Hummer tour option and an IMAX movie screening if that's more your speed.

We also checked out the National Geographic Visitor Center, which was surprisingly interesting. The exhibits give you a great background on the canyon's formation and history.

What I really loved about this tour was how stress-free it was. No worrying about driving, parking, or figuring out where to go. The guide handled everything, and they actually made the history and geology stuff fascinating instead of boring.

If you're interested in booking this tour (which I highly recommend), I found the best deals here: https://athometouch.com/SouthRim

A few quick tips:
- Bring a jacket (it can get chilly)
- Don't forget your camera
- Wear comfortable shoes
- Bring water (even though they provide some)
- Book in advance, especially during peak season

Bottom line: For $80, this tour is an absolute steal. You get to see one of the world's most incredible natural wonders without any of the hassle of planning it yourself. Plus, the optional upgrades let you customize the experience to your taste.

[AC2](https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/s/RmqU2TWd8T)

This time, I‚Äôll be looking at Ascendance, Brotherhood (game), Brotherhood (book), and Renaissance.

# Brotherhood seq. 1/prologue + ch. 1-12

The book explains away the poison from the end of Renaissance. Ezio leaves Rodrigo supposedly dying slowly from poison. Ezio can‚Äôt find it in himself to mercy kill Rodrigo. Before leaving with Mario, Ezio goes back to the Sistine Chapel to confirm Rodrigo‚Äôs death and finds that he‚Äôs gone missing. He looks inside the vault for him, too. To not contradict Brotherhood, it‚Äôs implied that Rodrigo only pretended to poison himself.

I don‚Äôt like this alternate interpretation of Ezio here. At the end of AC2, he chose not to kill Rodrigo because he knew vengeance would not change the past. According to the books, Ezio believed Rodrigo was dying a slow, painful death and he left him there to die because he didn‚Äôt feel like showing mercy. In my opinion, that‚Äôs antithetical to letting go of the desire for revenge. Maybe someone can argue the opposing view, but I think that Ezio at the end of AC2/beginning of Brotherhood would‚Äôve given Rodrigo a quick death, said ‚ÄúRequiescat in pace,‚Äù and then left if he appeared to be slowly dying on the ground.

Claudia‚Äôs husband is revealed to have died in a throwaway line from Mario. Backpedaling on more stuff from Renaissance that doesn‚Äôt fit Brotherhood.

Ezio helping out and going about casual business around Monteriggioni is expanded on in the book. There are more townspeople to help around. Oddly, two random villagers share names with people who were or will be important to Ezio. The stablemaster‚Äôs name is revealed to be Federico and a child Ezio encounters is named Sofia (too young to be that Sofia, don‚Äôt worry).

Ezio and Caterina‚Äôs previous relationship from Renaissance is acknowledged in the book.

The assassin meeting is pretty much the same, but small details are added or changed. Machiavelli confirms Rodrigo‚Äôs survival and informs about Cesare. They also mention the incest. It‚Äôs highly likely that it was an untrue rumor, but it‚Äôs now the primary way that media depicting the Borgias portrays Cesare and Lucrezia‚Äôs relationship.

The siege of Monterrigioni is more fleshed out in the book. The woman who Ezio carried the flowers for ends up getting her head stuck on a pike. Ezio directly confronts Cesare when he enters the villa. Cesare introduces all of his close allies to Ezio. And mentions that Leonardo is working for him now.

Cesare fatally shoots Mario and another man. Ezio lunges for Cesare and is wounded by a gunshot. I guess Cesare didn‚Äôt get a chance to confirm Ezio‚Äôs death before getting pushed back again. It‚Äôs one thing in the game where Ezio gets shot while he‚Äôs far from the gate, but in the book, it seems like he is right there. Some of the memories of Ezio that appear when Desmond and Lucy go through the sewers are added to the escape in the book. Before Ezio and the others complete their escape, Cesare taunts him across an abyss with Mario‚Äôs decapitated head.

# Brotherhood seq. 2/ch. 13-14

Ezio thinks way more about Caterina in the book than the game would seem to show. And he is conflicted about whether she or the Brotherhood is more important to him. Once I get through all the books, maybe I‚Äôll rank protagonists by simp level. Ezio and Alta√Ør have already proven themselves to be way bigger simps than the games seem to show (well, at least Ezio didn't simp for an enemy and Alta√Ør's simping worked out for him).

The sequence is simplified a bit. The man Ezio helps before meeting Machiavelli is removed, as is some of the more tutorial-ish stuff. In the book, the woman who tended to Ezio‚Äôs wounds says that Machiavelli had her take care of him. In the game, though this is revealed to be true later, Machiavelli feigns surprise that Ezio survived the attack on Monteriggioni.

They also go and watch Cesare bullfighting while Machiavelli gives exposition, including that Leonardo is being forced into working for the Borgias. Historically, this was probably voluntary work for which he was paid. Some of Machiavelli‚Äôs observations on Cesare come across as admiration. Machiavelli and Ezio free a district from Borgia control and rally the people to resist and stand up for themselves. Ezio notices Machiavelli writing some of his words to the people. Ezio‚Äôs suspicions about Machiavelli‚Äôs loyalty are brought up multiple times in these chapters.

The end of the sequence goes about almost the same in the book. Ezio chases down the thief who pickpocketed him, catches the courier with the letter (one difference: Ezio takes a page from Alta√Ør‚Äôs book and kills the messenger so that he cannot warn his superiors), and discovers the followers of Romulus, who call themselves ‚Äúthe Secta Luporum‚Äù (Latin for sect of wolves) in the book.

# Brotherhood seq. 3/ch. 15-21

Ezio allies with the thieves, mercs, and courtesans in that order. It takes at months to get all of them situated, which is sort of shown with the building montages in the game. Some interesting differences, Bartolomeo employs Michelangelo to plan out improvements for the barracks and Ezio has to haggle with a lender to get the ransom money for the courtesans because he doesn‚Äôt have the time to stop at a bank. Story and gameplay separation. He doesn‚Äôt really carry hundreds of thousands of gold on the regular. The Auditore home in Florence is confirmed to be destroyed and it seems like in the book, Maria and Claudia did go there first before heading to Rome.

Since Claudia and Maria were put in a convent for much of the duration of Renaissance, Claudia saying that she ran Mario‚Äôs estate is a less convincing argument for why she can run the Rosa in Fiore. It‚Äôs possible she did manage the estate after they moved out of the convent, but that would be starting 11 years later than she was implied to have started in AC2.

Sometimes the book conflicts with optional objectives, like with the merc mission. Ezio kills more than just a captain in the book, but optional objectives are supposed to be the canon way. For minor details, it‚Äôs not a big deal. For important stuff, that‚Äôs a different story.

Going a bit darker here, it is implied that the slavers sexually assaulted the courtesan before Ezio got there. Unfortunately, that‚Äôs more realistic than how the game portrayed it, with them only holding her captive.

# Brotherhood seq. 4/ch. 22-29

Infiltrating Castel Sant‚ÄôAngelo goes about the same as the game. Cesare leaves before Ezio can get a chance at him and Ezio rescues Caterina.

When Lucrezia calls Ezio a hypocrite for allying with the Medici family because they punished all the Pazzi, not just the conspirators, Ezio thinks about how Caterina had every single one of her citizens who were involved in a rebellion against her tortured and/or killed (the book doesn‚Äôt include this bit, but also their relatives, and not just the men, but the women and the children, too). I‚Äôm surprised that Lucrezia didn‚Äôt bring this up herself, as proof that both Caterina and Ezio are no better than the Borgia.

Not a big difference, but Ezio and Caterina gag and tie Lucrezia, rather than knocking her out.

When Caterina lets Ezio know that their relationship was political for her, Ezio takes it harder than it seems in the game. He feels as though his heart is falling in ‚Äúa bottomless mineshaft.‚Äù In the game, I‚Äôd say that my interpretation was that they were attracted to each other and while Ezio was more invested than Caterina, I still didn‚Äôt think it was that deep for him. Especially since one of Ezio‚Äôs Revelations letters to Claudia implies that he became jaded about love after the death of Cristina and didn‚Äôt mention Caterina. A few chapters later, their parting seems to show that Caterina's not being serious about pursuing a relationship pushed him further away from trying to find meaningful romance until Revelations. Ezio tries to both confess his love and leave Rome to be with her, but she rejects both advances. As she rides off, Ezio is described as ‚Äúa lonely middle-aged man who had been given a last chance at love and missed it.‚Äù¬†

Ezio starts recruiting citizens, which in the book does not go into much detail and for good reason. Ezio meets back up with Leonardo. Ezio is initially wary, but back to being bros within the next page. Ezio needs a new hidden gun in the book, still had it in the game though. Ezio plans to have some of the recruits keep an eye on Leonardo to keep him safe. The war machine mission is cut from the book.

Snake‚Äôs cardboard box is not mentioned in the book. I wouldn‚Äôt expect it to be, but that is a definite difference. It isn‚Äôt necessary to try to rationalize easter eggs, but if I can, I guess I will. Considering the Raiden outfit is also in the game, tied to completion of the Animus Virtual Training Program, Rebecca probably likes Metal Gear and was also trolling Desmond.

# Brotherhood seq. 5/ch. 30-34

Ezio and Claudia are more confrontational with each other in the book. Egidio needs 10,000 ducats in the book, but the mission only calls for 3,000. In the book, the guards seem dismissive upon hearing that the actual captain, Luigi, has been found dead in the Pantheon. In the game, it seems more like they believe it and correctly think they let an impostor in.

The orgy is a bit more descriptive in the book. There‚Äôs a bunch of dildos and whips around and Ezio watches Juan Borgia have sex with a courtesan before assassinating him. Claudia and some of her courtesans come to the party entrance to retrieve the money. The end of the sequence goes about the same, Claudia and the courtesans defeat the guards and she and Ezio reconcile.

# Brotherhood seq. 6/ch. 35, 39-40

Ezio helps the thieves first and the mercenaries second in the book. It is the opposite way in the game. Leonardo shows Ezio the replacement weapons. He also provides the crossbow, instead of it being purchased from any blacksmith. He mentions Sala√¨ in passing. Ezio arranges for Leonardo to bring the weapons to the Rosa in Fiore. Ezio goes to pick up the weapons before he deals with Micheletto.

The French bust at least one of the gates in the book with help from a battering ram. The fighting spaces gets so tight that weapons stop being used in favor of fists. Stealing the uniforms and getting to the Baron‚Äôs location are similar in the book. The Montr√©al joke is left in.

The baron and Ezio speak about Cesare a bit and the baron tries to bargain for his life. Ezio walks up and takes the gun from the baron, who accepts his death by sword with dignity. In the game, this would cause Pantasilea‚Äôs death and a desynchronization.

# Ascendance

This is a short animation set sometime before and/or during Brotherhood. It is about Cesare‚Äôs rise. It starts with the baron threatening Pantasilea and getting assassinated by Ezio. It seems to be possibly a different location and Ezio is in his robes, not a French disguise. Ezio meets up with Leonardo and they discuss Cesare‚Äôs rise to power. I am not sure if this is supposed to be before or after the baron‚Äôs assassination or how long before or after it is.

Cesare had his older brother Giovanni murdered to gain Rodrigo‚Äôs favor. Giovanni was Rodrigo‚Äôs favorite son and nothing short of Giovanni‚Äôs death, could put Cesare into higher favor with Rodrigo. Historically, Giovanni‚Äôs murder is unsolved and Cesare is one of the many possible suspects. Cesare seized power by force, acted cruelly to common people, and betrayed and backstabbed his own men.

Ezio vows to kill Cesare and then gives Leonardo a scroll, which Leonardo goes and gives to Cesare at Castel Sant‚ÄôAngelo. Ezio watches from a viewpoint, monologues about how the brotherhood will liberate Rome and that ‚Äòlike his father before him, he is an assassin.‚Äô He leaps from the viewpoint and the short ends.

# Brotherhood seq. 7/ch. 35-38, 41

In the book, La Volpe knows that Pietro is playing Jesus in the play. In the game, Ezio doesn‚Äôt seem to know which of the three men he is. Ezio and the recruits poison and replace Micheletto‚Äôs men right behind him and he apparently cares so little about them that he doesn‚Äôt realize that the men with him aren‚Äôt the same ones as before. Micheletto is ambushed offstage in the book. The actors get scared and run when Pietro starts vomiting from the poison and the Borgia and Ezio‚Äôs allies begin fighting.

Ezio chases down the traitorous thief and stops La Volpe from attacking Machiavelli. The thief commits suicide with his own dagger and not Ezio‚Äôs hidden blade, though.¬†

Before Ezio stops La Volpe, he returns to the Rosa in Fiore and talks with Maria. She tells him that some courtesans are secretly traitors. This comes up more in optional missions. She also tells him that the Spanish king and the Holy Roman Emperor are coming to Rome to possibly ally with Cesare. Ezio has Claudia and the recruits investigate.

The letter that the traitor carried has information about the assassins‚Äô plans to deal with the Baron de Valois. They decide to plant false information in a new letter to give to the Borgia. Useful in the book because that‚Äôs the next chapter, but that was the previous sequence in the game.

La Volpe and Ezio then discuss the Cento Occhi. Ezio leaves some recruits to help the thieves take down the rival gang.

After a little while, Ezio and the other leaders meet up at Tiber Island. Claudia and the recruits found information to confirm that Spain and the HRE, are no longer considering allying to Cesare. The thieves and recruits have defeated the Cento Occhi. Claudia is initiated into the Brotherhood and Ezio is made mentor.

In the book, Machiavelli mentions that he was planning on writing a book on Cesare and now considering contrasting his methods with Ezio‚Äôs. In the game, it‚Äôs not stated that it would be about Cesare too. In The Prince, Cesare is used as an example of how ruling through cruelty and fear can keep people in line. Caterina is also mentioned in The Prince about how her fortress could not keep her safe after her people grew to hate her.

# Brotherhood seq. 8/ch. 42-48

Ezio enters Castel Sant‚ÄôAngelo, wearing the French uniform. He takes the time to change clothes before going to find Cesare and Rodrigo.

Rodrigo‚Äôs death goes about the same. He and Cesare argue before Lucrezia runs in and reveals the poison, which Cesare uses to kill Rodrigo. Historically, they both became ill at the same time. Cesare recovered and Rodrigo did not. It could‚Äôve been poison, but it could‚Äôve also just been that they both fell sick and as would be expected, an older man is less likely to recover from an illness than his son.

Lucrezia gets her rude awakening that Cesare‚Äôs one true love is power, not her and she points Ezio in the right direction. Ezio runs across the passetto di Borgo from Castel Sant‚ÄôAngelo to Saint Peter‚Äôs Basilica. Historically, two popes have used it to save themselves from invaders. One was Rodrigo in 1494 and the other was Clement VII during the 1527 Sack of Rome.

Ezio uses weapons to neutralize the Borgia men coming after him in the basilica, but it‚Äôs either use the Apple and fail full synchronization or run in the game. Ezio uses the Apple to give him a route to sneak out of the Vatican. Ezio meets up with his allies to plan their next steps.

Ezio uses weapons while dealing with Cesare‚Äôs forces, rather than being Apple-locked. He does use the Apple on the guards. One of them shouts, ‚ÄúWhat sorcery is this?‚Äù It‚Äôs more justified to say when seeing Isu tech for the first time than Alta√Ør acting surprised when he had already figured out that he was fighting a woman or Vieri upon being sneak attacked. After the guards die, Ezio realizes how truly powerful the Apple is and what the wrong hands could do with it.

The game does not show this because it‚Äôs really not necessary to know about the guy who was Pope for a month between Rodrigo and Julius II, but Pius III ordered the arrest of Cesare. The order still stands after Pius dies and Julius is elected. Cesare‚Äôs army does show up, but they scatter when Cesare gets arrested.

Ezio and Leonardo talk a bit more. They say some things that allude to work that Leonardo and Michelangelo would later create. The Apple shows Ezio Cesare‚Äôs escape as it happens. When he reaches Castel Sant‚ÄôAngelo, the guards tell him Cesare escaped a half hour ago, which was when he was using the Apple with Leonardo. Ezio uses the Apple again to find where Cesare escaped to. He hears a woman‚Äôs voice telling him where to go. It‚Äôs implied that this is probably Minerva. Ezio and two thieves take a boat and catch up to Cesare‚Äôs ship. They take over the ship. Cesare is conveniently still in the crate he was smuggled in.

# Brotherhood seq. 9/ch. 49-66

There is a lot added that isn‚Äôt in the game.

Ezio goes and talks with Pope Julius about the fate of the Borgia. Cesare has been put in a Spanish prison. His escape from there is when Ezio goes to find him in sequence 9. Lucrezia is married off to some noble and will go on to live a relatively quiet life until her death. Just as Ezio is shown to have come up with the idea of milk and cream in coffee in AC2, Ezio suggests simply naming the pope‚Äôs personal regiment of Swiss men, the Swiss Guard. The pope also mentions that he has hired Michelangelo to paint on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and that he is planning on not using the extravagant Borgia apartments (present day: these apartments are used as part of the Vatican art gallery). Ezio tells the Pope about his plans to kill Cesare once and for all.

Ezio struggles with the desire to keep the Apple or hide it away throughout these chapters. The Apple lets him know that Micheletto still lives and will likely try to free Cesare.

Ezio goes to discuss his plans with his allies. He mentions Caterina‚Äôs army in Forl√¨ and also thinks about how he‚Äôs not over her. Machiavelli and Ezio go to speak with Cesare and Lucrezia‚Äôs mother. She doesn‚Äôt know about Cesare‚Äôs location. Ezio notes that she is very unhappy.

Next, they go to see Rodrigo‚Äôs last mistress and plan to visit¬†Cesare‚Äôs wife after her. Guilia Farnese (Rodrigo‚Äôs mistress) doesn‚Äôt know anything either but is a better hostess than Vannozza (Cesare and Lucrezia‚Äôs mother). Guilia mentions that Lucrezia has a kinder side and had she not been influenced and used by Rodrigo and Cesare, she might‚Äôve had a better time in life. Historically, Lucrezia was likely not the scheming, incestuous femme fatale that media depictions often make her.

Cesare‚Äôs wife is quite hostile to them but she isn‚Äôt too fond of Cesare either. She also doesn‚Äôt know where Cesare is.

One of Machiavelli‚Äôs men finds them to tell them Claudia has been kidnapped. A Borgia loyalist has been torturing her with a knife. He threatens her life to try to coerce Ezio into leaving Rome. He mentions that Claudia is old and childless, which conflicts with Renaissance. She had at least one child according to that book. Ezio and Machiavelli save Claudia and kill all the Borgia loyalists there.

The assassins find and capture Micheletto. They bring him to Florence to imprison him. Machiavelli remains in Florence after this. Caterina breaks Ezio‚Äôs heart again with a letter that she has a new lover. Ezio sends her a bunch of letters, which she replies to none of them.

Maria passes away and Claudia steps back from running the Rosa in Fiore. Rosa from Venice is brought in to be the new madame. I suppose it didn‚Äôt hurt that her name matched the establishment. I‚Äôm glad that Rosa‚Äôs character is still getting small nods here and there in nonverbal media (she‚Äôs also depicted on one of the Magic cards in the AC set: ‚ÄúDistract the Guards‚Äù).

Julius and Ezio discuss the Apple. The pope gives Ezio the idea to hide the Apple and leave a clue that only a worthy successor would be able to find. He says that maybe it‚Äôd even be a descendant of Ezio who would find it.

Ezio and Leonardo go and find Cesare‚Äôs former doctor. All they get is a lesson about syphilis and learn that Rodrigo and Cesare both caught it. Machiavelli returns with news that Micheletto escaped Florence. They use the Apple to confirm he is going to Spain. Ezio, Machiavelli, and Leonardo use the Apple again to try to get more specifics. A voice that I think is Minerva again tells Ezio, but not the others where to go. They also bribe a courtesan for information about Micheletto. All information points to him fleeing to Valencia in Spain. They follow Micheletto to Spain. He evades them, but they are able to get information from his men.

The books are typically third person limited, centered on the protagonist, but chapter 60 has the perspective characters be Micheletto and Cesare.

Ezio and Machiavelli destroy Cesare‚Äôs forces with bombs made by Leonardo. They find Cesare at what I think is a bar or something. He kills Micheletto for failing him. Machiavelli also gets shot in the shoulder, so he stays with a doctor, while Ezio pursues Cesare.

Ezio finds Cesare in Navarre. He says, ‚ÄúMy thirst to avenge Mario Auditore led me to you.‚Äù In the game the line is ‚Äú(the Apple you stole from) Mario Auditore led me here.‚Äù That line is weird in the game both times it‚Äôs said and the book didn‚Äôt do that much better in my opinion. Cesare retreats and Ezio gets caught up in the fighting. When he catches up to Cesare, they have a sword fight that ends with Cesare flying off the wall to his death.

In the final chapter, Ezio, Leonardo, and Machiavelli meet up for Ezio‚Äôs 48th birthday before heading off to Rome, Milan, and Florence, respectively. Leonardo declines an invitation to join the brotherhood and Machiavelli says that the book he‚Äôs going to write will be called The Prince.

# The Da Vinci Disappearance & The Copernico Conspiracy

Neither is in the book, but Sala√¨ is mentioned in passing a few times.

# Cristina memory 1/Renaissance ch. 1

The only difference I could find between the book and the game is that Federico distracts Cristina‚Äôs chaperone.

# Cristina memory 2/Renaissance ch. 4

Cristina is the one to tell Ezio where to find the bodies, instead of him beating a guard for info. Ezio and Cristina part ways and he gives her that necklace before he buries his family.

# Cristina memory 3/Renaissance ch. 8

A few minor differences. Manfredo tries to buy Ezio a drink in the book as thanks for his rescue. Ezio and Cristina do not have a kiss goodbye in the book. Ezio only gives a small wave and leaves.

# Cristina memory 4/Renaissance ch. 18

Like the other memories, similar with minor differences. Ezio leaves the note for Cristina at the residence of the person housing her and her husband. Despite the previous memory not including the kiss goodbye, the dialogue stays mostly the same.

# Cristina memory 5/Renaissance ch. 26

This memory is not novelized. I think this can be taken two ways. One, Ezio didn‚Äôt see Cristina before she died and the memory is him wishing he got the chance to say goodbye. Or Ezio did see Cristina and she died in his arms, but he didn‚Äôt bother to correct Machiavelli about already knowing she passed away.",1,1734409349.0,assassinscreed,0,1.0,False

1hg2jgj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenOver30/comments/1hg2jgj/any_other_guys_feel_like_their_dating_life_is/,Any other guys feel like their dating life is cursed? ,"I don't want to throw a pity party but I seem to suffer from the George Costanza curse - if I'm into them they're not into me, if they're into me I'm not into them.

And there has been almost zero overlap between women I find physically and women I find emotionally attractive.

I'm a 6'5 good looking guy so I've been asked out maybe 10-15 times across my life ( asked out to coffee or something to that effect) however not once was I physically very attracted to any of them, so I politely declined. I have no interest in dating someone I don't find sexy.

Whenever I've tried to connect with a woman I do find sexy there's been some roadblock... either it turns out they're taken.... they're dumb as a doorknob, rude, boring, drug addicted, ultra religious, crazed femcel, or they just aren't into me.

The plot thickens because I'm not going exclusively for super models and barbie dolls - in fact I'm not actually attracted to women like that and never have been, I'm attracted to slightly chubby women... like mum bods and skinny fat women who by conventional logic should have a slightly lower bar with men. It sounds pretty repugnant to say that but you know what I mean - a blonde gym bunny can probably afford to be a bit of a bitch and overlook 99% of men who show her interest, it's a bit more jarring when you keep running into women who don't quite fit the conventional beauty paradigm but act like they're gods gift to mankind.

I once dated someone (who I was really attracted to) who seemed cool for a few months then turned into a possessive psycho overnight so I had to cut and run.

Anyway it almost feels like a curse.

When I joined a social work class a few years ago it was 80% women. By the end of the course, three of them expressed clear interest in seeing me - I was not even remotely attracted to any of them (they were pretty I just wasn't into them). The only girl in the entire class who I was extremely attracted to was ultra religious. She ended up failing because her mind had been rotted by her rancid faith such that she couldn't bring herself to fully accept homosexuality and transsexuality and you obviously can't have someone like that in a social work role. But come on what the fuck are the chances?

When I go out and meet a group of women the one I'm physically attracted to will without fail be taken or have the most repulsive personality of the group, or just have zero interest in me while her friend who I have no attraction to will be flirting hardcore.

This has been the story of my life so far.

Can anyone else relate with this shit?

It's why I've taken to just approaching women I find attractive point blank at the mall or wherever we cross paths because the I guess it's a numbers game and eventually I will surely meet someone who's both physically and emotionally appealing. (Joining clubs and groups is such a time consuming roundabout approach that got me nowhere slowly).",3,1734409166.0,AskMenOver30,49,0.53,False
1hg2ira,https://www.reddit.com/r/Discipline/comments/1hg2ira/unable_to_live_i_just_dont_know_how_or_what_to_do/,Unable to live. I just don't know how or what to do.,"I got some help in another sub last month for self improvement. But I'm having a really hard time. I tried sticking to a schedule. Like getting up earlier to do a bit of exercising. Working on cleaning up my life. Then ended up falling a bit ill one day. And stopped exercising for awhile.. Not not trying to get back into it  Which isn't much anyway. 

But overall I'm doing a bit better. I lost some weight. Yet still feel fat. I guess because I still have a long way to go.

I rent a 1 bedroom apartment. It's a huge mess with stuff everywhere. I would like to clean everything up. Not not just that. I also would like to be fully organized in all aspects of my life. Like personal finance, scheduling, etc.

I just don't know how to go about keeping track of so many things. It feels too overwhelming. 

Right now I'm in the process of multiple things aside from organizing my apartment. 

One is selling my car and buying a better one. I'm looking at a used car about $15K

Next is moving out of state for school. My last month in this apartment is February. So my plan was to just try to relocate to the state. There was a school I thought was in Arkansas that might be good. But turned out a bad idea. I have options between Chicago and DC. But not sure which to go for. Or if either are really worth it. 

I decided to renew my lease here for another year. Therefore, work on moving in 2026. So I have all year to get my rear in gear.

I work under 20hrs per week, but my expenses are fairly low. Which means I have lots of free time. But I often spend the day with pretty low energy. So I get nearly nothing accomplished. 

Of course, I am doing a basic exercise routine in the morning. But with really like to get in shape and improve my flexibility. As well as loose weight. And improve the way I eat by planning out meals I can afford.

Then there's my caf√© business that I'd like to open when I move. I just have no experience with coffee making. I know it's possible to even just have a cart for a coffee stand. I was planning to work on this after I move out of state. But I'm open to setting it up locally if there's an opportunity. I know a spot with hundreds of customers. 

The issue is whether I can handle business and school at the same time.

My apartment is quite huge. I have my bed and desk. But I don't like furniture so there would be some unused space if it was small. So there's lots of unused space. So maybe there is some business I can run from home. 

I just need to be able to be consistent and getting stuff done. I could be making billions of dollars. If I actually had the energy and capability to get stuff done. 

Any advice would be helpful. Thanks!",2,1734409098.0,Discipline,0,1.0,False
