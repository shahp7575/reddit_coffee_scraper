1kijdbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1kijdbt/should_you_buy_the_ninja_slushi_fs301_frozen/,Should You Buy the Ninja SLUSHi FS301 Frozen Drink Machine Review Before Summer?,"The **SharkNinja SLUSHi FS301** caught my eye because I‚Äôm a sucker for a good frozen drink, whether it‚Äôs a frothy frapp√© or the perfect margarita. Testing it turned out to be a refreshing experience‚Äîliterally. It felt like stepping into a cheat code for hosting summer BBQs or even just making an ordinary Tuesday feel fancy with a glass of icy coffee. This machine boasts some intriguing features that justify its popularity, as well as a few quirks you might want to keep in mind before clicking that ""Add to Cart"" button.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed about this slushie maker was its sleek black design with premium accents‚Äîclean and modern without trying too hard. It‚Äôs not just pretty; it feels solid, albeit a bit bulky. If counter space is sparse in your kitchen, this might be a tight fit, as it measures 20.25 x 20.25 x 10.1 inches and weighs 28.6 pounds. Carrying it up to my kitchen counter gave me my workout for the day, but once it was set up, it had an undeniable presence. The 88 oz. capacity is a significant plus for entertaining, making this machine a true party-starter.

**A Superior Frozen Drink Experience**  
What really sold me is the versatility of this product. One evening, my coworkers came over, and we decided to test its limits. It effortlessly transformed soda, wine, and even chocolate milk into delicious slushy drinks. No blending or ice was required, thanks to the game-changing RapidChill Technology. This system uses a cooling cylinder and auger to evenly freeze your chosen liquid, delivering smooth, icy results instead of chunky or watered-down drinks. It honestly felt like a mini science experiment in my kitchen.  

[Grab SharkNinja SLUSHi FS301 at the best price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0d2lzyq2m/)

**Ease of Use and Preset Programs**  
Setting it up felt intuitive. With five preset programs, you can tailor the freezing experience based on what you‚Äôre making‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a margarita that requires a slightly firmer texture or a frapp√© that demands a silkier finish. The one-touch functionality is straightforward enough that my teenage cousin could operate it without needing a manual. However, there is a bit of a learning curve with sugar content. Drinks without added sugar or sugar substitutes don‚Äôt freeze properly, which could frustrate folks who lean towards healthier options.

**Merits**  
- RapidChill Technology evenly freezes liquids without ice.  
- An impressive 88 oz. capacity, perfect for parties.  
- Five preset settings cover popular drink styles effortlessly.  
- Easy to clean, with dishwasher-safe parts like the detachable lid and drip tray.  

**Hurdles**  
- The weight and size make it less than ideal for small kitchens.  
- Drinks must include sugar or a substitute, which limits sugar-free recipes.  

**Cleaning and Maintenance**  
No one loves cleanup duty, and this frozen drink maker takes that into account. Its detachable parts, including the lid and drip tray, are dishwasher-safe, which saved me loads of time after a day of experimenting. However, I did notice the auger needs a bit of extra attention to avoid any leftover residue. The removable vessel design also makes it easy to top off liquids or clean out leftover slush between batches, which came in handy during a lively game night that demanded lots of refills.

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this to other frozen drink machines on the market, the Ninja SLUSHi FS301 stands out primarily in its capacity and technology. Brands like Margaritaville offer decent machines, but few, if any, match the smooth texture achieved by RapidChill Technology. That said, the Margaritaville models are often lighter and easier to store, which might appeal to those with limited kitchen space. Some competitors are more forgiving with sugar-free recipes, potentially adding versatility. Here, this machine excels in presentation and efficiency for classic recipes but does falter for those wishing to craft completely diet-conscious beverages.

**Value Proposition**  
While the price varies, this isn‚Äôt the cheapest gadget on the block. However, the feature set‚Äîlike temperature and texture controls, automated presets, and the ability to keep drinks frozen for up to 12 hours‚Äîjustifies the cost if you‚Äôre someone who entertains often or finds joy in crafting unique drinks. It‚Äôs an investment, sure, but one that pulls its weight, whether used occasionally for celebrations or as a frequent kitchen assistant.

I had the cold brew at Soma yesterday and it blew me away what a rich and pleasant flavor it had.  I want to brew coffee similar to this at home; I know they sell the exact beans/grounds, but I'd like to reduce my price whiplash as I transition from paying maybe $3-4 a pound for the stuff I have been drinking to the $22 a pound the Soma beans/grounds cost.  When I can afford it, I'll buy it, but right now at that price it can't be an every-week/every-month coffee for me.

Coffee enjoyers:  can anyone point me to coffee beans/grounds that might be similar to the Soma cold brew blend but more modestly priced and easily found around town?  Are there any big brands that you've had that offer something similar?  The Soma website describes the blend as ""A blend of Latin American coffees with notes of caramel, chocolate and hazelnut with a light citrus acidity"" and I was told it was a blend from (I think) Mexico, Peru, and Guatemala.

She had given up getting her morning dose of hard caffeine, much to Alice‚Äôs chagrin. HQ had been set abuzz like a cluster of hornets zipping about their kicked over hive after the news of the watcher shooting‚ÄîEagles, they called it. But the name felt foreign amongst its alternate name. *Who the Hell shot the damn thing?* From the fragments of data Nori had received, there was nobody in the vicinity the scanner had picked up, and thusly nobody to shoot it. *But it* ***was*** *shot,* she argued with herself. *there had to be someone.* The functional regions of her mind at once took up their work. *Accomplice? Sniper support?* The two meant the exact same damn thing. *Perp couldn‚Äôt have shot from the crowd, half of Seattle would‚Äôve noticed whoever did this pull a gun, much less shoot it. If they did pull the trigger, everyone‚Äôd run for the mountains. Suppressed snipers aren‚Äôt even that quiet, either. To top it off, they‚Äôre too quick to be shot down‚Äîwait a damn minute.* She stopped herself. The gears turned, she fucked up. *Fuck,* the word had almost transferred itself into her vocal chords. It was a fight to keep her expression from changing; one Nori was actively losing. *Intervals.*  ¬† Any way one sliced it, the reveal had come‚Äîmost of the metropolitan area of Seattle had received the news of law enforcement involvement, no thanks to the media. The Director could deny any presence of Bureau officers if he so wished, but there was no way to hide the corpse every outlet in the State of Washington had a picture of‚Äîadorned with flies, splattered rat shit, food scraps, and combined fluids from dampened trashbags that slickened the surface down to the gaping sinkhole in its center to the touch. Any FBI officer would willingly bet their whole career in the Bureau that the serpents had been waiting for a moment like that‚Äîan FBI ‚ÄúWatcher,‚Äù the nickname given to the Eagles even Nori had taken up‚Äîfound with a bullet straight through the lens in a dumpster. But for what the FBI were here for, even the SPD had no idea. The anonymity was maintained for the present time. ¬†

¬† The near-constant jabbering of her co-workers served to ensure that sleep never lulled her away. Some were seething, brimming with cusses about not seeing the vaunted Centurion prototype in action. Without the Eagles, the hulking, high-tech steel behemoths were completely unable to function.¬† Only one Eagle was given‚Äîmanufactured, for that matter. The same could be said for the Centurion, both were the first of their kinds‚Äînow seemingly, the last as well. The maiden voyage of these experimental units had bore a quite unsatisfactory result. Yet her analytical mind continued to pester her with possibilities. *The data. It was still functional for some time before it shut off. Maybe if we could‚Ä¶* The idea passed her by. Another was quick to present itself. *It could‚Äôve been hidden for days there. I only saw it from the sparks. If it was shifted a bit more to the left, I would‚Äôve paid no attention.* Maybe the Director would still be well off with the American public, and Nathaniel Cain would be able to provide a shield to the wave of gunsmoke and thew washed upon Seattle.¬† ¬† ¬†

A long sigh drew itself from her lips. Nori rubbed where her temples would be, had she been a human. Her teeth pressed against each other, creating a barely-felt pressure in her jaw. *What‚Äôs new?* ¬†If the rain had just kept coming down, she wouldn‚Äôt have seen it‚Äîthe dim, foggy haze the hammering rain produced would‚Äôve veiled any of the flying sparks. Even without the rain, she had barely caught a glimmer of the streaks that flew from the cover of the dumpsters and trashbags.¬†

She leaned back in her chair, her neon purple optics slowly scanning her surroundings. Again. Again, just to make sure. Sure enough, it had quieted down. Maybe it was just her. There was a faint scent of nicotine that wafted and melded into the aftermath of stench left behind by the previous night's rainshower‚Äîthe rain caught in the gutters still pitter-pattered and streamed down the windows in small spider-web like veins that varied in its thickness. She had involuntarily learned how to pick up the smell from her friend‚Äôs constant smoking. The line had moved, something Nori hadn‚Äôt thought she‚Äôd be conscious enough to behold, even though it was a minute shuffling forward like fettered slaves in line, awaiting slabs of raw meat. *Workplace professionalism.* The two words echoed within her mind. *Professionals chasing shadows.* They had not even the slightest idea of *who* they were hunting‚Äîonly that they were *there,* and they needed to be caught‚Äîyet here they were, sitting on their asses like deers blasted with concentrated light. The *R.I.C.O.* Act cut off the head of a serpent for a time, but the American Cosa Nostra had simply grown a new one, and it had adapted‚Äîand was as unrecognizable as it could be in these times. ¬†   
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre chasin‚Äô fuckin‚Äô shadows here!‚Äù A voice bellowed. *Took the words right outta‚Äô my mouth,* her retort was spoken mentally rather than aloud. Heads snapped to the source of the noise. It was about time someone started shouting. Despite that, her brow raised, and her optics widened a twinge. Nori smothered the expression‚Äîone mental plastic bag draped right over its head like a clear curtain cut short and sewn specifically for the purpose of asphyxiation. Her optics flickered down to her gun that sat at the very left corner of her desk. It felt alien not feeling the .9 on her hip‚Äîmore precisely, it felt as if she had been amputated‚Äîbut having it holstered rendered her unable to shift into a relatively comfortable position on her chair without feeling the gun poke at her thigh like a dulled blade. The morning had only brought more titles, typed out by the thousands and at once transmitted to millions of waiting screens:

***FBI FLYING OBJECT FOUND SHOT IN SEATTLE DUMP***

***UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT IDENTIFIED AS FBI PROTOTYPE CODENAMED ‚ÄúEAGLE‚Äù: SHOULD WE BE CONCERNED?***

***WHAT IS NOW KNOWN AS AN ‚ÄúEAGLE‚Äù FOUND IN A DUMPSTER NEAR SEATTLE CENTRAL LIBRARY***¬†

***SPD DENIES ALL KNOWLEDGE OF FBI PRESENCE IN SEATTLE, POLICE CHIEF MAKES SPEECH***

***WHAT ARE EAGLES?***

***PRO-DRONE ACTIVIST AURELIO ROSSI MAKES STRING OF SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS AFTER SPD CHIEF SEES THROUGH THE SCRAPPERS***

¬†¬†¬†Nori winced at the simple memory of the media furor, and sucked in a breath that slid in like ice water through her teeth, a cruel breeze that never quite grew nor stayed. For all of their bravado, the media sure did know how to uncover Federal secrets at blinding speeds. At least there were some people willing enough to fight for those like her, if only coming from groups equally marginalized such as the Italian. The drone itself had been swiftly collected and tagged as evidence. The memories of the titles were as clear as a black and white signature blotted on paper, the shit-stained pictures even more so‚Äîevery brownish-black smudged pixel had ingrained themselves into her brain‚Äôs memory storage, and had lacked any intent on disembarking from her. Her stomach expressed its dogged discontent at the image‚Äîthat and the fact that she had at once began to smell it ever so faintly. The voice roared on, muffled by glass that even still burst through. ‚ÄúWe don't know who the fuck shot down our bird, the murderer of Oliver Mackenzie is *still out there*‚ÄîGod only knows where he is‚Äîand the media is up all of our asses!‚Äù *Tell us something we* ***don't*** *know.* A quick, albeit empty second thought that blurred through both poles of her mind and vanished once it had finished the split-second race held her lips pressed together in a tight, thin strip‚Äîthough it did not prevent Nori from finally relaxing her spine within the somewhat burning comfort of her chair, though there was a pervasive feeling of certain lousiness that came with it. Even throughout all of this, there *was* some sort of plausible deniability. Or perhaps that was just gut feeling. What that plausible deniability was, Nori herself had no knowledge of.

After all, it wasn‚Äôt within the Bureau‚Äôs abilities to simply orchestrate a mass killing of reporters and sweep it under the rug‚Äîthat would be an utter impossibility, especially in light of such scandalous affair as this. The voice was coarse, as if it had been made of sandpaper, but not of the stereotypical rugged type; it still had some youth and smoothness to it to accompany its masculine roughness.¬†

¬†¬†¬†This was Nathaniel Cain. He was no short, bulbous man‚Äîfar from the idea, though his sitting position made it seem so. Some of his grayish-dark stubble peeked out from the draped window‚Äîcrowds of small hairs standing on end as if small cactus pricks had grown off his body. His almost pale blue‚Äîas pale and ghastly as thin sheets of ice finely cut round into small circles within a man‚Äôs eyes‚Äîeyes jittered and dilated. Through the slits of light that squeezed through the slits of the faded and somewhat crusted drapes hung semi-closed, she could just about see him sat hunched at his undoubtedly vintage deep gray wickerwork desk, jabbing his finger at a thick stack of pearl white paper grown to chin-level that almost faded out in color along the edges, almost like a fat house-pet bedecked with glimmering white fur curled upon his austere desk‚Äîor perhaps that was the case from only an angle. His mouth moved and twisted and curled, but no words came out, save for occasional syllables that made no sense to anyone that had not eased into seats within the confines of his office. Behind him was a singular window, fogged a lightish gray hue. It was splotched an almost ghastly pale color with the remnants of the rain, yet still not thick enough to hide the deeper still darkened paper skyline sprawling with billowing clouds that looked as if they were made of curls of pitch black smoke‚Äîthough they had all but thoroughly expunged their deposits of rain‚Äînow glowing a tint of dark gray-red, almost duskish-pink that translated itself into a myriad of shades‚Äîlike two great oceans and their puppets clashing against one another in a mad brawl for superiority within the blooming clouds.¬†

¬†¬†¬†The flickering lights of Seattle that always stayed on, cut in halves or small ribbons by the lowered blinds along with the tips of the skyscrapers they were fastened upon, cast faint, nearly circular static hazes about themselves and aided the sun in dictating the flight of the darkness of the early day. Poor guy had practically pissed his pants, just like ninety percent of the rest of the people Nori had the complete displeasure of overhearing. Barely-stifled musings, the groan of chair legs made of faint shining metal scraping against whatever flooring they had used, and the clinking of almost sprayed white-looking ceramic mugs; at least the smell of freshly-brewed coffee was a welcome one; if not a slightly envious aroma‚Äîthe very oil within her veins still thrummed with the need for the blackish-brown hued liquid that cast such dull glimmers as if it was a colored sea confined in a small cup.  ¬† She never quite thought of the possibility of returning to Seattle, once again returning to the smell of dampened leaves stuck to concrete as if they had been lathered with glue, from the few trees that grew around the area that indeed were not evergreens‚Äîodd ones out, they were. She had never quite thought she‚Äôd return to the hammering fat droplets of rain, the iconic Seattle coffee, and the criss-crossing glimmering beams of the Seattle Central Library Nori spent hours ogling before at last pushing open the creaky double-doors.

Once again the memory of the establishment had established in itself a certain fuzziness, a short-lived sensation in itself. A memory flashed itself within her mind: An open book, garishly decorated and dense with pages, yet they bore no words. Any letters present were distorted beyond any possible legibility. One of the Library‚Äôs miniature lava lamps made for the ‚Äúaiding of the scrapper‚Äù‚Äîas it was said by the mayor at the time of her middleyouth‚Äîcast a faint blueish hue over the desolate, crusted pages, as if someone had turned the book on its side and shaken its contents out. Yet there, she did not belong either. Where? Her mind had wiped the location from which she was originally out, as if she had never truly left Seattle at all. It should have plagued every corner of Nori; it should have, yet it did not‚Äîinstead, it espoused a strange satisfaction in her place of birth and upbringing.¬†

¬†¬†¬†Her thoughts turned to Alice‚Äîthe resident country girl must‚Äôve enjoyed the rank smell of fish to have been out there for this long without stumbling back inside. How long had it been? Time had swept her off of her feet, as it always seemed to do. Was the fish market too far away, or was it too close? There was only the faintest hint of saltwater dragged inland by wheezing winds and filtered by the putrid stench of bird shit, nothing more. The men who had fallen subject to Cain‚Äôs browbeating shuffled out his door, carefully closing the finely smithed hardwood behind them‚Äîthe door made not a creak, as if it itself was wary of Cain‚Äôs ire reigniting like the constitution of lightning. They said nothing to each other, or to the bewildered men and women whose eyes had become trained on the two, and simply filed back to whence they came, the rhythmic clicking of their shoes against flooring barely audible amongst the louder clacking of keys. Yet there was a tincture of bitterness somewhat veiled in the way that they strode toward wherever they were going. They vanished around the corner, their smudged and silhouetted figures moving and melting into the long shadows. She only caught a shred of a coattail, like one from an old trenchcoat from those ancient detective noir movies.

¬†¬†¬†*Maybe she's in the car.* There was that part of her again, cutting through the silence. If she could reach over and strangle herself‚Äîor the part of her that didn't know the meaning of ‚Äúshut the fuck up,‚Äù‚Äîshe most definitely would've. Her thoughts flickered, her thoughts fluttered. One thought passed her by; two floated over her. Snow hadn't even fallen yet‚Äîif Nori‚Äôs memory served her well, when she was but a child the first flurries of powder danced from the paper of smoke gray by late October‚Äîeven still she felt pricks of cold run across her arm and cluster at her feet as if she was standing upon a lake of ice barefooted. It wasn‚Äôt even Thanksgiving yet, and the radio bastards were already spewing Christmas carols. Nori twitched, and shifted‚Äînonexistent flames crawled up her thigh from pressing against the chair for far too long. Her optics flitted to the line‚Äîor thankful lack thereof. The drone shuffled from her seat, trying‚Äîtrying as she might‚Äîto ignore and filter away the eyes that had begun to fixate upon her as if she was the only *pseudo-human* present within the flash flood of flesh and bone that looked more like a 2000s-era office space to her rather than an FBI operation headquarters.¬†

¬†¬†¬†When she rose at once the flames that slithered and spread throughout her thigh ceased, leaving an aching that dug as deep as her veins lay and pulsed within them like a heartbeat of its own. Nori shuffled from her desk, sparing one last glance at the sleek black pistol. She stuffed a hand in the small pocket of her jeans that barely engulfed her knuckles, and shimmied in between the just-enough to fit gap between her chair and her desk. Her mind roiled every which way‚Äîsomething caramel, something‚Ä¶ gone. A certain hollowness that rippled throughout her being like a small pebble cast in a lake‚Äînever rippling, simply swallowed; simply engulfed. The air grew colder, and slid into the gaps of her sleeves, licking stripes along her forearms like parasites gliding atop skin, yet never quite digging in. Or was that just her? It felt strange, nearly liberating; nearly freeing‚Äîyet suffocating, as if something had clasped a tight hand upon her mouth and wrapped an arm around her throat. But no reaction came of it. She stopped short for a second, and allowed a puff of air to die on her lips. Then Nori carried on. Her shoe slid against the flooring, producing a sharp *squeak*. At once all of Nori seized for a moment‚Äôs worth as if she had been stricken catatonic‚Äîher very fiber had stilled as if a millstone hung about her neck had allowed her to go no further. Two breaths fell short, two breaths inhaled. She felt a chill dart up and down her spine, a chill that ran cold as arctic winds, dissipated swiftly and forced her to move once more. Her legs wobbled and twitched from the sudden transition from sitting to movement. Somewhere along her thigh pulsed with something barely felt. They were queer little tremblings that vibrated ever so slightly along both legs, as if her very flesh underneath her clothes were bubbling; yet not. She resumed her steps, walking with a sort of agitation;‚Äîagainst what, Nori knew not. The train that ran laps across her stringed mind incessantly had finally, momentarily, ceased itself at a most inopportune time. Or perhaps it was for the better.

When I turn the machine on, it sometimes runs the pump continuously and won‚Äôt allow me to select any mode. Other times, when I try to make a coffee, it grinds the beans, but then the pump just keeps running without dispensing anything. I end up having to unplug the machine to stop it.

Occasionally, after sitting overnight, it might work once or twice before going back to the same issue. I‚Äôve noticed that running hot water can help temporarily, but the hot water stream sputters and is inconsistent (air?). After doing this, I might get one or two cups of coffee before it reverts to the problem.

I tried applying some grease to the two orange O-rings, but that didn‚Äôt seem to help. I‚Äôve also run a full descaling cycle with no improvement.

Jesus said ‚Äú I am the way the truth and the life.

Can we trust 400 eyewitness is that where Jesus said was true? If we can trust those eye witnesses and believe in our heart, then we are correct! -but if we can‚Äôt trust those eye witnesses, and if we don‚Äôt have faith, then all of this was for nothing.

Trust is the weight that‚Äôs hardest to lift ‚Äî because you can‚Äôt lift it with muscle. You earn it through daily reps:
‚Äì Say what you mean, every time.
‚Äì Keep your word, especially when it‚Äôs inconvenient.
‚Äì Show consistency when no one‚Äôs clapping.

Own a mistake without excuse.
You build trust one clean rep at a time. Drop a comment if you‚Äôre in.""

Mood Spoiler: Satisfying, positive resolution","I‚Äôm 25F and work in a small office. Recently, I noticed people acting weird around me‚Äîavoiding eye contact, whispering when I walked by. I found out from a work friend that my coworker ‚ÄúSarah‚Äù (30F) was spreading rumors that I was slacking off and bad-mouthing our boss to get ahead. None of this is true; I‚Äôve always been professional and keep to myself. I‚Äôm not sure why Sarah would do this‚Äîmaybe jealousy since I got a small promotion recently? I‚Äôm planning to confront her privately, but I‚Äôm nervous about making things worse. Should I talk to her or go straight to HR? Any advice on handling this?  
TL;DR: Coworker is spreading false rumors about me at work, and I‚Äôm unsure whether to confront her or escalate to HR.Update (posted 2 days ago, 10 days after original):  
Hi everyone, thanks for the advice on my original post! I read through all the comments and decided to confront Sarah directly but calmly, as many of you suggested, while keeping HR as a backup plan. I asked Sarah to grab coffee during our break, keeping it neutral so she wouldn‚Äôt feel attacked. I said, ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôve heard some rumors going around about me, and your name came up. Can we clear this up?‚Äù She looked shocked and denied it at first, but when I mentioned specific things I‚Äôd heard (without naming my friend), she admitted to ‚Äúventing‚Äù to a few coworkers. She said she was stressed about her own performance review and felt I was getting favoritism after my promotion.I stayed calm and told her that spreading rumors wasn‚Äôt okay and hurt my reputation. She apologized and seemed genuinely embarrassed. I asked her to set the record straight with the coworkers she‚Äôd talked to, and she agreed. Over the next few days, I noticed people acting normal around me again, and my work friend confirmed Sarah had told others she‚Äôd made a mistake. I also had a quick chat with my boss to give her a heads-up, framing it as a misunderstanding that was resolved, so it‚Äôs documented in case this happens again.I feel so relieved this didn‚Äôt escalate further, and I‚Äôm glad I handled it directly. Thanks to everyone who encouraged me to stay professional and avoid drama! I‚Äôm keeping an eye on Sarah, but for now, things are back to normal.

We moved here because of my studies and job, and hers too. We live in a rented apartment, and while the rent is paid by our family, managing everything else has become harder over time.

Initially, things were smooth. We contributed equally to household expenses‚Äîshe paid for milk, the help, and dry cleaning; I paid for water, groceries, and WiFi. Both of us receive ‚Çπ15,000 ($150 USD) per month from our family, and the idea was to use it for our shared living costs.

However, around 4 months ago, she randomly started living back in our hometown. Her job continued, but she just decided to stay there while leaving all her things and her room untouched here. Despite being away, she still receives her allowance.

I noticed that whenever she would leave town, the milk subscription would stop. At first, I ignored it, but it kept happening. When I asked her about it, she told me that since I‚Äôm the one living here, I should handle it. That was the beginning‚Äîshe gradually stopped paying for anything.

For the past 4 months, I‚Äôve been paying for everything on my own‚Äîmilk, water, WiFi, dry cleaning, the help, and groceries‚Äîall within the same ‚Çπ15,000 allowance I used to manage half with. She still visits occasionally, but even then I‚Äôm the one paying for everything.

Whenever I bring this up to my mom, she tells me I need to manage better and learn to respect money. But the truth is, I have nothing left for myself after covering the basics. We don‚Äôt have a vehicle, so a big part of what‚Äôs left goes into rickshaw fares. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I can‚Äôt even afford hygiene products and have to use old, half-used items my sister left behind.

Groceries are another struggle. Veggies often spoil because I can‚Äôt finish them alone, so I mostly rely on packaged food. Lately, I‚Äôve been sticking to one meal a day and surviving on liquids the rest of the time.

Meanwhile, my sister has ended up saving a lot, simply because she doesn‚Äôt live here anymore. And what frustrates me the most is that whenever she returns, she expects the house to be stocked. She wants groceries in place, her coffee ready, and even expects me to do her laundry when she leaves again.

She also orders very expensive food when she‚Äôs here and expects us to split it, which doesn‚Äôt make sense considering we‚Äôre meant to use our allowance for shared essentials. When I ask why she orders like this, she says she doesn‚Äôt like ‚Äúcheap food.‚Äù

My family doesn‚Äôt acknowledge how hard it‚Äôs been for me. They just tell me to ‚Äúmanage better,‚Äù when in reality, I‚Äôm doing the best I possibly can. I‚Äôm struggling, and it feels like no one sees it.

‚∏ª

TL;DR
I (19F) live with my sister (26F) in a different town for work and study. Our family pays rent and gives us both ‚Çπ15,000/month to manage other expenses equally. But for the past 4 months, my sister has mostly lived in our hometown while still receiving her allowance‚Äîand I‚Äôve had to cover everything alone: milk, help, groceries, water, etc. I‚Äôm barely managing and skipping meals, but my family keeps telling me to ‚Äúmanage better.‚Äù Meanwhile, my sister saves money, returns expecting things ready, and even orders expensive food expecting me to split the cost. No one seems to acknowledge that I‚Äôm actually struggling.

1kij7vr,https://www.reddit.com/r/IVF/comments/1kij7vr/ivf_in_north_cyprus_my_experience_prices_proscons/,"IVF in North Cyprus: my experience, prices, pros&cons","# My situation

I'm 26, single with a known donor. I wanted to freeze embryos in order to become a SMBC in a couple of years.

I had never tried to conceive before, was never pregnant and never took the pill. So going into this I didn't know anything about fertility issues or how any of this worked frankly.

My AMH is 8.6. I was told that this is normal for women under 25. Ultrasounds also revealed that I have multifollicular ovaries. I was told that this is the typical ovary structure for women under 25. Prior to this I'd never heard about PCOS and it was never brought up to me during the process either. My periods are regular and I don't have any PCOS symptoms. However, I couldn't find any information about multifollicular ovaries either. So I guess it is what it is. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

# Why North Cyprus?

I'm from a country where IVF is only legal for married couples, so I knew that I was going to have to do this overseas either way. My research wasn't very sophisticated. A celebrity I follow did IVF in Cyprus and I had also heard about egg donation in Spain, so I googled around these two countries.

Spain was more expensive and it was also mandatory for a known donor to be your partner. So I didn't investigate further.

For Cyprus, I googled ""embryo freezing Cyprus"" and contacted the first two clinics that came up: EuroIVF and Cyprus IVF Hospital.

I took some time to decide between the two and ended up picking the latter.

I was also quite ignorant about the political situation in North Cyprus. I knew that there was some kind of conflict, but had no idea it was literally divided. It was only when I called the Cypriot embassy to ask if I need a visa that I realised bc the person on the phone was like ""we don't give any information about the occupation"" and I was like oh god it's more serious than I thought.

But all this to say, I went to North Cyprus because it was the cheapest option and also because legally it was the place with the least constraints.

# The process

I was assigned a patient coordinator who I was in contact with throughout the process (email and WhatsApp).

Before starting, I did a basic checkup at my obgyn and a blood test. I sent these results to my coordinator who drafted a protocol for me and sent a prescription for all the meds. I then showed the prescription to my obgyn who translated it for me.

Since the meds are very expensive, I went to France to buy them. Everything cost about 1000 EUR.

Then, on the second day of my period I did a detailed ultrasound and sent the results to my coordinator who gave me the definitive 5 day protocol with Gonal-F injections (225) and folic acid.

Then I did the second scan on day 7 and received the rest of the protocol, this time with Cetrotide.

For the third scan I flew to Cyprus. Crossing the border with the meds was super easy, no one noticed or asked about anything which was a relief. The clinic got us a ride from the airport and booked a hotel for us. And all transport to and from the clinic was also included.

After the final scan I was told I was ready and I took 2x Decapeptyl and we scheduled the ER 2 days later (so my 13th day).

# Egg retrieval

Before the procedure they measured my pulse and blood pressure like a 100 times and gave me an antibiotic (intravenous). I had a private room with a bathroom and the operation room was on the same floor. My assigned nurse was very lovely and kept calling me darling which I found adorable.

Sedation was a blast! It was my first time so I was super nervous. But wow, it was amazing. I don't remember it, but the nurse told me that when I woke up I said ""this was the best nap of my entire life"" lmaooo and yeah, I felt great.

After the procedure I didn't have any pain or discomfort, everything was super smooth. However I did feel really tired and slept the whole day, but I think it was just the anaesthesia wearing off. The next day I was back to normal.

I got 50 eggs, 46 mature, 38 fertilised on day 1 (I'm writing this two days post ER, so will update!)

For my donor, we did ICSI. And I also asked for PGD testing.

My last protocol includes 4 more days of Cetrotide and 5 days of Tarlusal, which is a medroxyprogesterone pill.

# Costs

IVF - 2250 EUR

PGD testing (it's an add-on) - 2000 EUR

First year of freezing - 500 EUR

Hotel - from 55 to 140 EUR per night, depending on the number of people and if you want breakfast/additional services

Plane tickets - 250 EUR

Medication - 1000 EUR

(It was also possible to buy medication in Cyprus for 1000 EUR too and get it shipped to you. Transport would've cost 60 EUR for taxi + 100 EUR for DHL fees.)

(FET would've cost an additional 1000 EUR)

# Pros

\- Great price, very transparent. I was a bit scared that at the end I was going to get additional bills for the room at the clinic or the ultrasound or whatever else. But I was just billed for the IVF procedure as a whole as indented + the addons I myself had asked for. So no surprises.

\- Very fast process, no waiting around. I was afraid that it would be hard to manage everything between two countries, but I had no issues at all. The patient coordinator was always available.

\- No judgement or intrusive questions about why who when. Before going on this journey, I had an awful experience with a fertility specialist in my country who lectured me about how a child is supposed to have a mother and father and how I'm going to ruin my future child's life, etc. He even gave me a prescription to go see a pedopsychiatrist. Whereas in Cyprus I could do things on my own terms.

\- Cyprus is beautiful üòç As I said before, I didn't know anything about the region and honestly would've probably never visited Cyprus otherwise. But now I want to go back already!

# Cons

Maybe this is a bit controversial, but it's important to be aware of cultural differences. This isn't a con in itself and maybe from your point of view my country is weird. But medical protocols/rules are quite different, so it did throw me off a little bit, even if it's not super important.

For example, in my country it's standard practice to meet the whole medical team before getting any surgery/procedure done. You shake the surgeon's hand, they show you the box of the medication they're using for sedation for example. You have a detailed discussion of what's going to be done to you and who is doing what. Whereas in Cyprus they just rolled me into the operating room and I don't even know who retrieved my eggs lol. There were about 5 people in the room and I didn't know who was the nurse, who was the doctor, etc. But then again, it's a small cultural detail that doesn't really matter in the end.

Another small thing, which is a funny detail, is that we had to put these like plastic bags on our shoes at the clinic. And everyone takes their shoes off in the operating room. Again, a small cultural difference, but just something I noticed bc that's not how things are done in my country.

For antibiotics as well, in my country you're always given yeast for your gut if you're given antibiotics, whereas here they didn't know what that was. Again, not a ""con"", just an observation.

Another funny thing is that in my country after sedation they immediately give you tea/coffee and biscuits and tell you to leave. Whereas here I was told not to eat and rest for 2+ hours! I mean hey, who doesn't want doctor's orders to tell you to chill and do nothing. I took a nap and made the best of it. But yeah 2 hours of just chilling was unexpected but I'm in no way complaining!

Overall, I'm satisfied with the experience so far. I visited both North and South Cyprus during my stay and that was great. Excited to be back for the embryo transfer, fingers crossed it will be soon! üôè",1,1746799252.0,IVF,0,1.0,False

1kij71n,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1kij71n/favorite_protein_coffee/,Favorite Protein Coffee,"Hi everyone! I have been searching for the best protein coffee and saw a few threads on reddit that have kind of touched on this - from chike, javvy, and others! But I want to tell you my best find so far.

Base: Vanilla Fairlife Core Protein premade shake (170cals)

Additions: 

- 1 shot (or 2) of espresso 
- Chai powder (Blue Lotus) - I really wanted to find chai that had no sugar and 0 calories

For quick context, I'm a college graduate who graduated with a B.S in Computer Science, who is struggling to find a job at the moment. Not only is the market bad, but I wasn't sure if my resume was hindering me or not (which it was).

Things I took into consideration (thank you all for taking the time to review my resume)

* Use the standard format (I used an engineering resume format that I found in a book)
* Get rid of red text, keep it black and white
* Remove GPA
* You don't need a street address for colleges, just city and state
* Do not mention the map you worked on unless it's related to game dev
* Include things applicable to the job and things that you are very confident in (I'm not sure if you meant software in general)
* Look up how to write bullet points for your job. See the STAR/XYZ/CAR methods
* Your projects should have bullet points if it were another job, and remain in a professional tone
* Don't list every class (I listed none)
* Drop references from your resume.
* No colors, graphics, or images
* Focus on keywords that hiring managers are searching for, like Python or JavaScript.
* Use the reverse format
* Include percentage numbers and verbs inside the work experience

Let me know what you all think.

I put 100g of coarse ground beans in my cafetiere with 500ml water and left it, covered, in a cupboard for around 20 hours. I then plunged half way and poured 50g over ice, with 50g of semi-skimmed milk and half a teaspoon of sugar - and it tastes a bit like cough syrup. Still coffee-like, and still drinkable but definitely mediciney. I've had the ""brown sugar iced oat shaken espresso"" drinks from Starbucks taste like this before occasionally, so I'd be interested to find out what exactly is causing this, since that is espresso and mine was cold brew.

I don‚Äôt know... She don't wanna talk and i she has every right not to.
I'm 25M and she‚Äôs 26F.

I lied about things in our relationship, and I wasn‚Äôt a good man. I started changing and rebuilt myself from scratch, and at last, I confessed every lie and mistake I made to seek forgiveness and redemption. I hate myself for being a liar and maybe a cheater. She‚Äôs everything to me, and she influenced me to become a better man. I quite smoking, drinking, ended all of my friendships (almost all of them were not good friends) and started working.

Mistakes like these happen little by little over time, and I wasn‚Äôt even aware of the mistakes I was making. I was blind and a neglectful person, and although I knew I was the luckiest person in the world to have her, I wasn‚Äôt aware of the cost of the things I was doing to protect our relationship. I hope there‚Äôs forgiveness for me. And if not, I hope she makes peace with her life and forgives me for the damage I‚Äôve done and is able to trust others (and maybe me) someday and find happiness.
I might never forgive myself for causing so much pain to the most important person in my life.

I'm going to tell the lies I‚Äôve said over the years so that it might help someone learn from my experience.
I wish I knew the importance of honesty and loyalty before I hurt the love of my life and myself.
The first four happened in the early months of our relationship, and the fifth happened during years 1 to 4 without i realise what was really happening :

1. I went to a party with a girl because she invited me and said she was going with her boyfriend, but she didn‚Äôt know his friends and was afraid. I accepted because I had a fight with my girlfriend and thought it might help me to take some time to myself. But from the moment I went there, I started blaming myself for doing it. What hurts me most is that my girlfriend texted me and said it was our monthiversary when i was there.


2. I went out of town with my cousin, and we got drunk. His friend offered me marijuana, and I smoked some for the first time in my life and fainted. I was afraid to tell my girlfriend because I thought she might leave me and think I‚Äôm an addict.


3. I was a smoker in the first year of our relationship, but I quit for myself and because my girlfriend had issues with it. Anyway...
We had a fight, and she wanted to break up with me in the 4th or maybe 5th month of our relationship.
I was really messed up and sad, so my coworker offered me to go the rooftop of the tower we worked in to smoke and unfortunately i accepted. She quit her job that night because it was her first day at work and she didn‚Äôt like the job I guess and we never met again.


4. At the first month of my relationship I invited my cousin and his girlfriend to my mother‚Äôs house, and they stayed the night. The next day, they told their friends to come there for lunch and then they left. I didn‚Äôt tell my girlfriend about their friends because I didn‚Äôt want them to come and I didn‚Äôt invite them either. I was ashamed but didn‚Äôt have the courage to ask them to leave. 


5. I worked in a company for 4 years. The people there were very friendly, and it was kind of my first serious job. Everything there was new to me, and since the people in that company were also my university friends, everyone was so friendly, and I didn‚Äôt know anything about professional behavior and boundaries at work. My girlfriend also came there a lot; sometimes we were spending hours together there every day.
A female coworker applied there after a few months, and we became friends. My girlfriend knew her, and they were kind of friends too. This coworker used to ask how I was doing and check my work, as she did with everyone else, because she was the manager. She got into a relationship with another coworker. After they separated, she once came to my room crying and complaining, so unfortunately, I offered her a hug. I felt like I was getting aroused all of a sudden without any bad thoughts or intention, so I immediately pulled myself away and went back to work. I forgot about it, and it never came to my mind again. Years passed, and I was always serious at work, always hated the guys who flirts with girls and wanted to be a gentleman for my girlfriend but I joked here and there. I also went to nearby supermarkets and restaurants with both female and male coworkers to take a break from work (our company was in a basement with no sunlight), and I wasn‚Äôt aware that it was a bad thing to go for a walk with a coworker during work hours. I was a bit open-minded and didn‚Äôt care if a coworker was male or female.
She once slept on the couch in the lounge where we were all sitting together to eat lunch at work and she put her head on my leg, and I didn‚Äôt care. I didn‚Äôt tell my girlfriend about any of this cause i didn't think it would matter.
A few months later, my girlfriend and I decided to apply to universities abroad, so I quit my job so we could study IELTS together. A year passed, and I think that female coworker also quit.
One time, she called and asked me to go to her house to fix her laptop. I declined and told her maybe we could meet at a coffee shop with my girlfriend some other time, and I could fix her laptop then. I told my girlfriend about this, and she got mad and changed her mind about that coworker.
Anyway‚Ä¶ we applied to universities but couldn‚Äôt go due to financial problems‚Äîalthough I have to admit, my girlfriend got accepted and I got rejected, but she stayed, mostly because of me and because of financial issues.
After a while, I got a call from the company I worked for, and they offered me a higher salary and said they were bringing the old team back. So that female coworker came back too.
Months passed, and once again, she came to my room crying about her ex-boyfriend. I put my hand on her shoulder, and suddenly, without thinking, I kissed her head. I do that a lot as a default gesture with my mom, grandmother, and sister... and I immediately regretted it.
I told my girlfriend I put my hand on her shoulder but didn‚Äôt tell her about the kiss on the head because it was really unintentional and out of pity and i was scared that she assumes i was trying to cheat.
Months passed, and one day, when everyone was at work, she and another coworker asked me to fix the end of her eyeliner because I‚Äôm good at drawing. And I stupidly said yes. I have no idea why I didn‚Äôt think it through. I did it, and that night, I told my girlfriend. She went silent and went home.
I cried, I begged, I did everything I could, but she brought back every gift I had given her and said she wanted to break up. I apologized, cried, asked for another chance, and after several weeks we got back together and moved on‚Äîthough she lost her trust.
During the weeks when she wanted to break up with me, I started listening to therapy podcasts and self-improvement and relationship advice videos. I came to understand how important it is in a relationship to be fully honest, and to be a better man and to be open about everything in a relationship and how cheating happens.


(Another thing is that I was a porn addict. My girlfriend knew and was okay with it, but the problem was that I checked that coworker‚Äôs Instagram and some other girls‚Äô accounts a couple of times. It was a perverted thing to do, and I hate myself for it. One time when that co-worker's external hard drive was on my desk this thought came to me to check her hard drive and find her personal pictures but evil thoughts like these come to my mind sometimes about everything else and i try to ignore them. i didn't do it in the end but it hurts me when i think about it.)

Btw I didn‚Äôt even look at or talk to that coworker after my girlfriend got upset over the eyeliner thing, i was gonna quite but she quit the company a few days later so i stayed at the company.
Since that incident, I wake up every day scared of myself, thinking if I‚Äôve cheated or if I‚Äôm an awful person or if I‚Äôve manipulated my girlfriend.
I confessed every single thing I mentioned to my girlfriend and asked for forgiveness. I hurt her so much. She told me she hates me and that I liked that coworker and that she was a third wheel between me and my girlfriend. It‚Äôs not true at all, i didn't like this girl and everything happened because of my foolishness. and it hurts so much to see her thinking like that and to see her suffering.
I love my girlfriend so much‚Äîmore than anything in my life‚Äîand wanted to marry her, but I couldn‚Äôt get through it without coming clean and confessing everything.
It would have been manipulative to ask her to marry me without letting her know the whole truth about me. I understand if she never want to see me again because I‚Äôve done these terrible things.
I always hated cheating because my father was a liar and a cheater, but I found myself in the same position, and I can‚Äôt be comfortable in my own skin anymore. The self-hatred is filling my body and my mind is against me. I wake up in the middle of the night and in the morning with my heart pounding, and the self-hatred hits so hard.
I know I deserve this, but I‚Äôve also learned some valuable lessons. I've changed my behaviour and boundaries with my co-workers since 8 months ago.
I just wish I knew better before hurting my precious girlfriend. She‚Äôs the best thing that ever happened to me.

Also please help me if you think there's any hope to regain her trust, although im trying not to put pressure on her any further but i let her know I'm here for her and i won't make the same mistake ever again and I've changed all these months.

Thank you for reading.

Before he left but during a time where they weren‚Äôt having much contact when they were sharing space, he started going into dating apps (we didn‚Äôt find this out until much later). 

He met a woman named Lola (43F) who taught as a music teacher at the middle school my little brother Zack (13M) goes to. My older brother and I at this point were starting lives of our own while Zack and my younger sister Ella (17F) were still within the ages at that point where a custody agreement was written into the divorce. During the times Zack and Ella would visit my Dad at his apartment during the year following his separation from my mom, their only interactions with Lola happened when my Dad said he had to ‚Äúpetsit‚Äù her dog (which they had secretly adopted together). 

At the end of this full year, my Dad invited my older brother and I to his apartment for dinner. Now, I should mention that my Dad had at this point turned into a ‚Äúthe phone works both ways‚Äù type of Dad. He wouldn‚Äôt text, call, or reach out to my brother and I in any way. When we would message him, we got one or two words in response. We would ask him if he could check in and that we missed him, and it was always met with apathy. Well, this dinner comes up, and we come in and Lola is there. I had guessed at this point that Lola was his girlfriend because of how much she came up in conversation with Zack and Ella, but I had never met her. Come to find out, this dinner was my Dad‚Äôs way of announcing that he 1. Was engaged to Lola 2. Was going to buy a house with Lola 3. That Ella and Zack would be getting their own rooms in this new house, as well as Lola‚Äôs son Aiden (12M). Great, cool, we congratulate them and I tell my Dad I‚Äôm happy he‚Äôs found a good relationship. He says right then and there what his wedding date is and that he wants us all there. Great. I leave. The communication on his part stopped completely. 

Fast forward about six months and it‚Äôs Father‚Äôs Day, my dad texts my brother and I that he‚Äôs just moved into his house and he‚Äôd like us to come over for dinner. We both show up and it‚Äôs immediately off. It‚Äôs a very nice house, very well adorned with a taste that‚Äôs wealthier than anything I‚Äôve experienced. We have to keep our shoes on in the house and the dog isn‚Äôt allowed in the common rooms. Also, and this is where it got heavy, there are three bedrooms. In the middle of the two smaller bedrooms is an open area with a couch, a coffee table, and a tv with a bunch of gaming consoles where the two younger boys are currently playing. And squeezed in next to the couch is all of Ella‚Äôs belongings. I find her in the garage making Father‚Äôs Day decorations and trying not to cry. Apparently, the bedroom she was promised at her Dad‚Äôs house is a game room for the boys that she is required to make no presence in. I should mention her entire passion in life is art and painting, and that at our mom‚Äôs house, almost every wall is adorned in Ella‚Äôs gorgeous creations. She‚Äôs been told she is not allowed to paint in this house, she gets two square feet of space for her stuff, she sleeps on a stiff couch, and the boys are allowed to use her ‚Äúroom‚Äù as much as they want. 

After dinner, I put Ella in my car with her stuff and took her back to her mom‚Äôs even though she technically had one more day with my Dad. My older brother and I game with my boyfriend‚Äôs family every Sunday, and I arranged to have Ella start joining us so she could have positive family experiences on the weekend. 

She had been going to therapy at the time so my she and my mom arranged to have my Dad start coming in to the sessions so they could talk through how Ella felt about everything. First session, my Dad showed up with Lola. Ella expressed she thought she was getting a room, Lola said Ella was ungrateful and banned her from the house. Right off the bat, my little sister is banned from visiting my Dad. Lola got banned from the therapy sessions. My Dad only showed up a few more times after that, and he did cancel a lot. At the last session, Ella told him he had one week to send her a text. He had to check in on her at one point during the week to ask her anything about her life or she would break contact. So, he cut her off. 

Fast forward a few more months, I‚Äôm ready to go back to college and I had reached out to my dad about possibly consigning a student loan. He asked me to meet him in person with a written out plan so he could review it. I did that, he looked at it, he agreed and told me to give him a week to sort his finances. That same night as I‚Äôm driving home, Lola messages me she wants a picture of the paper. Fine, I do it. Ten minutes later I‚Äôm getting a phone call from my dad that a bill he and my mom shared went to collections and dropped his credit a hundred points so he wouldn‚Äôt be able to co-sign. When I told my mom about this, she went through her own finances and couldn‚Äôt find any confirmation of this or see which bill was unpaid. 

Fast forward another few months, the date of my dad‚Äôs wedding is three weeks away and none of my siblings or I have received an invitation. I message my dad, and he says that him telling us the date a year ago was our invitation. At this point, I have had contact with my dad four times since his engagement announcement, my older brother has had two, my sister is cut off, and Zack is still with him half the time. Day of the wedding, Zack and I are the only two of his kids filling seats. A week later, I see that Lola has cut me out of the family pictures on her Facebook. 


Back to the present. I‚Äôve started considering who I‚Äôll be inviting to my own wedding coming up. My siblings are a must, and even though my mom has issues I know it wouldn‚Äôt be right without her there. The thing is, I feel the same about my Dad. I have little to no contact with him now, but I don‚Äôt want my wedding day to be a sad or vengeful event and it doesn‚Äôt seem right without my Dad being there, especially since I still showed up to his with a smile after everything. But, I do not under any circumstances want Lola there. She‚Äôs been horrible to Ella, and I‚Äôm almost completely certain she‚Äôs been influencing my dad to cut off my older brother and I. I don‚Äôt want that energy at my wedding, and I especially don‚Äôt want her presence starting fights. However, I‚Äôm worried that action would make my dad feel inclined to cut me off, and I‚Äôm worried it would upset the rest of my family. Zack actually likes Lola, especially since she‚Äôs one of his teachers now as well. None of my relatives on my dad‚Äôs side know the truth about what‚Äôs going on since my dad told my mom on THEIR wedding day that she‚Äôs not allowed to contact them without his permission and she‚Äôs always respected that. So, would I be the asshole for ostracizing my dad‚Äôs wife and not inviting her to my wedding?",2,1746798613.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

We are about to have our third child, and I stay home with our other two kids. My husband thinks I'm ridiculous because I want to be able to buy things when we need them. He gets angry if I buy almost anything. He doesn't even let me do the grocery shopping because if I were to buy one thing he didn't want it would turn into an argument. 

I want a little financial independence. He doesn't want me to even have a part time job. He has even told me that if I go back to work for the sake of having my own income, that I'm a bad mother for abandoning my children to daycare. 

I'm writing this because he wants me to look a certain way, but won't even let me get my hair done. I haven't had my hair cut/colored for over a year. I'm getting made fun of for having gray hairs popping out, and I've seen the models he looks at longingly, but I can't even try to look good for him because I have no income. Any income I've had he asks me to spend on bills or things for the house. For mother's day I asked for a new diaper bag, because mine was falling apart. He told me no. He said he would take me to dinner (we never go out to eat. If we do, it's where he wants to go. I haven't been able to choose a place to go out to eat in a really, really long time. I don't even want to eat anywhere expensive, just a reasonable place with food i crave.) Then he told me he wasn't going to take me out to eat for Mother's day because he decided to let me get my hair cut. 

I know i sound like a complete brat. But I have no income. He makes a good living. He buys whatever, whenever. I can't buy a gas station coffee if I want to. Out of the couple of gifts I get in a year, they always go toward things I genuinely need. I feel like I'm completely trapped and i have to ask for money like he's my parent for basic necessities.

I‚Äôve been reflecting on my journey with sobriety, and I‚Äôve come to realize something important: it‚Äôs not just about making a decision or relying on willpower. At first, I thought my sobriety was all about consciously choosing to not drink and forcing myself to stick with it. But as time has passed, I‚Äôve started to understand it in a different way.

Sobriety is not just a constant battle of ""I should"" or ""I must resist."" Instead, it‚Äôs more about **a process of transformation**, a shift in the way my body and mind interact with the world. It‚Äôs not about me controlling myself; it‚Äôs about my body changing, naturally letting go of old habits. It‚Äôs like the flow of a river that **changes course naturally** without anyone forcing it.

Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôve come to see it through a few examples:

---

### **1. Waking up without a hangover**

* **Traditional View:** I‚Äôd think, ‚ÄúI made the decision to stop drinking, so today I wake up feeling good because I chose not to drink last night.‚Äù It felt like my mind made the choice, and my body followed suit because I had made the effort.

* **Deleuzian View:** Now, I realize the change wasn‚Äôt just a mental decision; it‚Äôs a natural shift. My body no longer craves the hangover‚Äîit‚Äôs not about willpower but about **how my body has adjusted** and reorganized itself. I wake up feeling better because my body **has become** someone who no longer needs alcohol to feel okay.

---

### **2. Refusing an invitation to have ‚Äújust one drink‚Äù**

* **Traditional View:** I‚Äôd think, ‚ÄúI have to use willpower to say no. I have to resist the temptation to drink even just one.‚Äù It felt like I was struggling against a strong urge.

* **Deleuzian View:** Now, saying no feels natural. It‚Äôs not about resisting; it‚Äôs about **how my body no longer desires that drink**. I don‚Äôt have to consciously fight the urge. My body has shifted, and it simply feels right to say no, like it‚Äôs part of my new flow.

---

### **3. Feeling nauseous at the thought of drinking again**

* **Traditional View:** I might think, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve convinced myself not to want to drink anymore, so when I think about it, I feel sick.‚Äù It felt like my mind was controlling my body‚Äôs reaction.

* **Deleuzian View:** Now, I see it differently. The nausea is not just my mind controlling my body; it‚Äôs **my body rejecting the idea of drinking** because it‚Äôs no longer in harmony with my current state. It‚Äôs a visceral, natural response to something that no longer belongs in my life.

---

### **4. Realizing my energy has changed, without any effort**

* **Traditional View:** I‚Äôd think, ‚ÄúI worked hard to get sober, and now I feel energized.‚Äù It felt like all my effort was paying off and this new energy was a reward for my struggle.

* **Deleuzian View:** I‚Äôve come to realize that the energy I feel now is not the result of effort; it‚Äôs the **natural result of a transformation** within me. My body has aligned with a new way of being, and now I feel more alive and vibrant, without forcing myself to feel this way.

---

### **5. Rediscovering simple pleasures, like a walk or a morning coffee**

* **Traditional View:** I would think, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to enjoy these simple pleasures because they‚Äôre healthier than drinking. It‚Äôs part of my recovery.‚Äù I was actively trying to replace the old pleasures with new ones.

* **Deleuzian View:** Now, I realize these small pleasures come naturally. It‚Äôs not about trying to replace anything. I‚Äôm just experiencing a **new way of being**. A walk or a morning coffee feels **authentic and satisfying**, because it comes from a place of true enjoyment, not as a substitute for something I‚Äôve given up.

---

### **The Key Difference**

The biggest change in how I see sobriety is that it‚Äôs no longer a **constant fight or struggle**. I thought I had to **use willpower to resist** temptation, but what I‚Äôve learned is that **sobriety is a process of becoming**. My body and mind have simply transformed into a new way of being. Sobriety has emerged from this natural shift, rather than from a constant battle.

Sobriety is now part of the **flow of my life**‚Äînot something I have to fight against, but something that has happened **spontaneously** as a result of the changes within me.

Has anyone else experienced a shift like this in their journey? It feels so much lighter and more natural now, and I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts!

Early last year I got a bog standard Silvia, and since have modded it to have a dimmer, pressure gauge and more recently an adjustable PID. The coffee I pull now is SUBSTANTIALLY better than the original machine, to the point that I regret all the flavours I missed out on with the old machine.

Dimmer is helpful for preinfusing light roasts as well as fixing bad grinds by slowing the shot, but the PID is the star of the show. I thought I had a handle on temperature surfing but evidently I was clearly missing the mark. The PID especially with the ability to dial a temperature has a huge impact on either astringency or getting more flavor out of the coffee. More importantly I feel like between these two mods I can reliably make a repeatable shot that's extremely close in taste to the last. I had no idea what I was missing.

- I drink juices instead to get my dose of ""sugar"", but I'm addicted to it to the point where if one day goes by with no juice/sugar, I get a headache and can't work properly 
- I am not yet well informed on healthy meals that give you energy that I could replace my sugar addiction with.

So somehow, it has been a challenge for me to go a day without 1 soda can. (I only consume 1-1.5 soda cans total a day, but still feel I have a sugar addiction). 

What did you guys do? 
Did you quit sugar cold turkey, survive the headaches and lived on water the rest of your time?

Hey folks! üåü Are you ready to take control of your retirement? Whether you‚Äôre just starting to think about it or you're already knee-deep in planning, there‚Äôs always something new to learn. Let‚Äôs dive into some essential tips to ensure you have everything covered for a comfortable and fulfilling retirement.

#### Cut Expenses & Save Unexpected Money

Imagine this: you're sipping coffee in your cozy living room and suddenly realize you haven't used half the memberships and subscriptions you signed up for last year. Boom! That‚Äôs unexpected money right there. Trim those unnecessary expenses and save every extra dollar. It might seem small at first, but over time, these little savings can add up significantly.

#### Max Out Catch-Up Contributions

Remember those ‚Äúcatch-up‚Äù provisions in your retirement accounts? These are designed for people over 50 to help you put away even more money. If you‚Äôre nearing retirement age, make full use of these options. Contributing aggressively now can set you up for a much better financial cushion later on.

#### Diversify Your Savings 

Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket ‚Äì this is the golden rule when it comes to saving for retirement. Max out your 401(k) if you can, and consider adding an IRA to the mix too. This way, you spread your risk and have more flexibility in your investment choices.

#### Discuss Inheritance Expectations

Have you ever had ""the talk"" with your family about inheritances? It‚Äôs not always easy, but communicating with your loved ones can help prevent future misunderstandings. Openly discussing these expectations ensures everyone knows what to expect, which can be a huge relief and a stress-buster.

#### Pay Off Debts

Before you retire, aim to clear any outstanding debts. Nothing dampens retirement joy faster than the burden of debt repayments. Think of being debt-free as a final gift to yourself for all the hard work you‚Äôve done.

#### Communicate Financial Plans with Your Partner

Retirement planning isn‚Äôt just a solo task; it‚Äôs a team effort. Make sure you and your spouse are on the same page. Sit down together to discuss your goals, fears, and dreams. This open communication can help prevent surprises and conflicts.

#### Create a Detailed Retirement Budget

Ever heard of the phrase ‚Äúplan your work and work your plan‚Äù? Apply that mindset to your retirement. Project your future expenses and adjust your current spending patterns accordingly. Having a detailed budget can provide peace of mind and help you prioritize your needs.

#### Plan for Healthcare Costs

Healthcare costs are a critical component of retirement planning, especially in the early years before Medicare kicks in. Factor these into your budget and consider options like HSA accounts for additional healthcare funding.

#### Adjust Asset Allocation

Your investments should evolve as you get closer to retirement. As a general rule, shift your portfolio towards more conservative investments. Balancing risk and return is key to maintaining your wealth without undue stress.

#### Prioritize Your Needs First

It‚Äôs tempting to want to support everyone around you, but remember: securing your own retirement should be top priority. Once you‚Äôve nailed your financial plan, helping others can be more rewarding and sustainable.

#### Define Your Post-Retirement Activities

What will keep you busy and fulfilled when you hang up your boots? Maybe it‚Äôs volunteering, traveling, or picking up a new hobby. Planning ahead allows you to transition smoothly and avoid the pitfalls of boredom.

#### Choose the Right Location

Where do you see yourself spending your golden years? Some retirees prefer the serenity of a small town, while others thrive in bustling urban centers. Consider the cost of living, climate, and social opportunities when making this decision.

#### Set a Retirement Date & Celebrate

Pick a date, mark it on your calendar, and celebrate your achievement! Setting a specific retirement date gives you something to look forward to and provides clarity on your journey.

#### Stay Present & Happy Now

While it‚Äôs important to plan for the future, don‚Äôt forget to enjoy the present. Life is happening *right now*, so savor each moment. After all, the goal of all this hard work is to ensure you get to enjoy those moments without worries.

#### Plan Tax Strategies

Tax-efficient investing can save you a bundle in the long run. Things like asset location and Roth conversions can help optimize your finances. Do your research or consult a pro to maximize your savings.

#### Seek Additional Support

Sometimes, seeking outside help can be incredibly beneficial. Whether it‚Äôs a financial advisor or joining a retirement-focused group, getting expert advice can guide you through complex decisions.

#### Proactively Plan Your Retirement

Retirement planning is a marathon, not a sprint. Stay proactive, review your plans regularly, and make adjustments as needed. The key is not leaving anything to chance; take charge of your financial security today.

Alex leaned back on the tiny wooden stool with both hands rubbing his full belly. His stomach pressed against his shirt and he looked like someone who had stared into the Abyss and found it full of meat sauce and moz. He had eaten two full corner pieces. No, he didn‚Äôt regret it in the slightest. The second piece didn‚Äôt give another stacking consumable buff, but the gains? Oh, they were telling. His breath was 80% garlic and he was a lump of bloat and joy.

Then the thunder ripped outside. Looked like tonight‚Äôs deliveries came with added rain.

**\[You have ingested a Rare Grade Buff!\]**

**\[Nina‚Äôs Lasagna Buff - TIME REMAINING - 7:47:29\]**

**Nina‚Äôs Lasagna Buff**

**This is a Unique Rare Grade Buff. It has been baked in an ancient glass dish from the homeland and accented with runic salt protection pulled from a coastal spirit named Rosa that pissed Nina off one time.**

**Nina‚Äôs Lasagna is dense, cheesy, and judgemental. Consuming it has filled you exactly what you need to survive a spooky-ass full moon stormy shift.**

**For the remaining time, you receive:**

**\[Layered Protection: +50% resistance to all elemental damage, including clowns, lightning, ghouls, and other filthy creatures who hate carbs.\]**

**\[Garlic Aura: Undead beings within 5 ft suffer a disadvantage to \[Bite\] Attempts.\]**

**\[Carbed Up: Your glycogen levels are overflowing, allowing your Core to passively regenerate +20% for the duration of the Buff.\]**

**You also permanently receive:**

**\[+4% Distributable Permanent Skill Upgrade\]**

**\[+5% Max Satiety Meter\]**

**You can now eat even more before hitting your limit. Nina‚Äôs influence within you has grown.**

**Note:**

**Ingestible Food Buff only works once every 24 hour period. Lasagna Buffs do not stack. Remember that three slices is too much. Perhaps enjoy some dessert or a palate cleanser.**

‚ÄúUghhhhhhhhh,‚Äù Alex groaned while rubbing his belly in slow circles. ‚ÄúNina. That was amazing. Like life changing. Where did you learn to cook like that?‚Äù He groaned. Nino laughed from where he leaned on the table with crossed arms while looking lovingly at his wife. Nina smiled devilishly and wrung her hands like an evil cooking witch. She pointed at Alex‚Äôs licked clean plate and it zapped out of his hands and into the waiting dish tub.

‚ÄúMy mother recipe. She was best cook in her village. She was also prettiest.‚Äù She turned to shoot Nino a look. Nino coughed and nodded and agreed quick enough to placate Nina. Then she turned and asked, ‚ÄúYou like? Is good?‚Äù

‚ÄúLife changing,‚Äù he repeated. ‚ÄúBut seriously, I feel like I‚Äôm going to roll to all my deliveries. How am I going to run feeling like this?‚Äù

Nina smiled, revealing perfect teeth that were definitely dentures. She floated to the fridge and rummaged between reused margarine containers. Nino gave a massive meaty thumbs up. ‚ÄúDigestivo,‚Äù he winked. ‚ÄúThis my favourite.‚Äù

In Nina‚Äôs hands was a square of tiramisu. The cocoa sprinkling shimmered. The thick layer of mascarpone jiggled slightly like the naughty cheese it was. The lady fingers held the whole thing up, poking out even though they were expertly soaked through with just the right amount of espresso. And what was that smell? Was that Marsala wine he smelled?

Alex suddenly had room again. ‚ÄúWait, but don‚Äôt consumables not stack?‚Äù

‚ÄúEat,‚Äù Nina snapped sweetly. ‚ÄúNo complain. No ask. So many questions. Mangia, o la lasci stare!‚Äù¬†*Eat, damnit*. She shoved the dessert into his hands and Alex hesitated for exactly one second before indulging in a spoonful. The cookies were firm, espresso rich without being bitter. The mascarpone was creamy and custardy. The cocoa was smooth. The little taste of wine for extra zing? He once again moaned in front of the elderly couple, swallowed, and then‚Ä¶

Another Buff hit.

**\[You have ingested a Rare Grade Potion!\]**

**\[Nina‚Äôs Espresso Buff ‚Äì TIME REMAINING ‚Äì 3:59:59\]**

**Nina‚Äôs Espresso Buff**

**This is a Rare Grade Potion disguised as a dessert. Surprise! Brewed with a mocha pot older than your Country and spiked with God knows what, this is the smoothest brew possible.**

**For the remaining time, you receive:**

**\[Caffeine Surge: Immune to Sleep and Drowsy conditions. Including your own dialogue. +25% to Movement speed and Movement Skill Range.\]**

**You also permanently receive:**

**\[+1 Stamina:¬†Your inner Stamina has been increased. Welcome to the big leagues, sweet cakes. Better get moving.\]**

**Note: Dessert Potion Buffs are counted as Potions. Yes, it‚Äôs weird. No, they do not stack. Nina will find you and yell at you if you drink too much coffee and have too much dessert. It makes you fat.**

Alex was full, but not sleepy full. He felt like he could run a marathon, punch a tree in half, deliver pizza to the damn dragon that protected Niagara Falls, and still have some energy left over. Nino vanished the tiramisu dish into the dish bin with a little plop.

‚ÄúYou are divine, Nina. I am ready to go.‚Äù He leapt to his feet.

He was bloated with power, with lasagna streaming through his veins and caffeine rocking his brain. With Snu‚Äôs little gift to boot, stuffed away in his pocket. It granted him passive Charisma against Dungeon Bosses and lust based monster immunity. The moment he thought of her, the¬†little balled up fabric warmed. A little wavering heat. He did feel the unconscious urge to sniff it.

*Don‚Äôt be weird, dude*.

‚ÄúWait,‚Äù Nina responded. ‚ÄúOne more thing.‚Äù

He shook off his invasive thoughts and came back to reality. Nino was laughing and walking to the back of the kitchen. The old man opened the one door that Alex hadn‚Äôt yet seen behind and carefully closed it after. Alex heard the creak and clomping of footsteps up a flight of stairs. Then down. Nino swore and something heavy hit the floor.

‚ÄúNina, what was‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúYou stink. You need fresh shirt. He get fresh shirt.‚Äù She smiled sweetly at him as if to say. ‚ÄúMind your business.‚Äù Nino reappeared and held something perfectly folded and crisp. It was a pristine red polo shirt. He presented it to Alex like a medal.

‚ÄúBecause you make through first day,‚Äù Nino said, smiling with pride. ‚ÄúAlmost none do. We give shirt.‚Äù It was just a shirt. Red and cotton, but it was definitely nice. Embroidered on the sleeve was the little white wording that was clearly done by hand. Nino‚Äôs Pizza.

‚ÄúI think Snu will like this‚Ä¶‚Äù he said without thinking just as the underwear in his pocket gave a purring warmth.

*Still weird.*

He shrugged and slipped off his sauce and sweat soaked shirt infront of the couple. He didn‚Äôt mind changing in front of them. They were a Lich couple and a hundred years old, probably. It wasn‚Äôt that kind of place. As his shirt came off, his Core automatically \[Inspected\] the item. Of course the shirt was a Relic too.

**\[Delivery Boy Shirt - Upgradable\]**

His eyebrows shot up as he slipped it on. It fit his twiggy body perfectly. His shoulders looked bigger and the sleeves made his spaghetti arms look almost toned. Alex didn‚Äôt know anything about crafting, that was more Mary or Jemin‚Äôs thing. How the hell did you upgrade clothes anyways? Monster Cores? Blood sacrifice? The Core of a Garden Gnome? A city pigeon? He‚Äôd ask them when he survived his Saturday night fever shift. He also looked like a real delivery boy now.

Nina clapped her hands and whistled so loudly it hurt his ears. ‚ÄúMolto bene! Now you handsome. The girl will like.‚Äù

Alex flushed. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you call her something the other day? What was that, by the way?‚Äù

Nina shrugged. ‚ÄúI no remember nothing. She like my food,‚Äù Nina said as she floated back toward the counter. ‚ÄúVery polite over phone. Wish me happy weekend. She not so bad.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlex,‚Äù Nino interrupted and wagged a finger in the air. ‚ÄúYou must be very careful tonight. Full moon,‚Äù the man said as he threw a strange hand sign pointed at the floor. Two fingers up, pinky and index, with the rest curled tight. It looked a bit like a rock and roll sign but more serious. Nina floated beside him and copied the gesture with her tiny hands.

‚ÄúLa corna,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúOld protection sign. You use if you see something bad. If someone give evil eye. You use fast.‚Äù

‚ÄúOver nuts, if you can.‚Äù Nino did the sign again gesturing downwards and did the sign while tapping himself‚Ä¶there.

‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶‚Äù Alex slotted that tidbit away for later. ‚ÄúHow bad are we talking here?‚Äù The thunder outside cracked again as if answering him. He knew the full moon meant Magic would be more violent than normal, but the couple‚Äôs warning had him on edge.

‚ÄúTonight bad,‚Äù Nino said grimly. ‚ÄúStorm, full moon, monster bolder. Bosses very awake. People change.‚Äù

‚ÄúEspecially when moon full and stomach empty. That why you deliver. In part.‚Äù Nina added.

‚ÄúGot it,‚Äù Alex swallowed, and prepped himself to get going. ‚ÄúDeliver pizza. Avoid curses. No pressure.‚Äù

‚ÄúReady?‚Äù Nino asked with raised eyebrows. Alex nodded at them. He had his new shirt, a full belly, a date, caffeine to burn off, and loot to acquire.

Nino stomped over to the bolted down espresso machine and yanked on a cord that hung from its side. It sputtered and hissed. The milk steamer shot out hot air and a green button blinked three times. Then it slammed itself into running with a whoomph. The Kitchen Portal ripped open directly in front of Alex. It started as a little black tear in space then expanded outward in a swirling nebula. Tiny sounds reached out. Alex couldn‚Äôt wait to jump through again and start delivering some fresh pies. There sounded like there was an amateur rock band playing in there, wherever 'there' was.

‚ÄúHit me with the first order.‚Äù Alex said as he stood in front of the portal. Nino clapped him on the back and then the job notification hit.

**\[A New Job has been assigned by your Employer - Nino‚Äôs Pizza\]**

**\[Deliver the Pizza to the Customer - Time Remaining - 32:41\]**

**\[50 Credit Reward for Completion, along any and all tips from Customers\]**

**\[Customer: Don Badger of the Gardiner - Cute Little Furball\]**

Nino summoned the order, a steaming pizza box, and handed it to Alex. He took it, adjusted his grip, and leapt through the Portal for his first delivery.

So I just wanted to share my experience with MuscleBlaze Pre Workout 200 ‚Äì Berry Bolt flavour. Maybe it helps someone make an informed decision. This was honestly one of the worst supplement experiences I‚Äôve had.

I took the pre workout around 15‚Äì20 minutes before hitting the gym, thinking it would be a good energy booster. I'm not sensitive to caffeine at all‚ÄîI drink tea and coffee regularly. In fact, before I started using this pre workout, I was easily downing 2‚Äì3 pouches of Nescaf√© a day without any issues.

But this was different.

After taking it, my heart rate shot up, and I started feeling really uneasy‚Äîghabrahat type feeling. Even the music in the gym, which normally pumps me up, started to feel too loud and irritating. My workout went downhill fast.

On my first exercise, I actually did well‚Äîflat chest dumbbell press, 30 kg each side, 8 clean reps. Thought it‚Äôs working fine.

But the moment I moved to my second exercise, everything crashed. I couldn‚Äôt even lift 15 kg dumbbells. My body just gave up. I was feeling lightheaded, anxious, and like I had zero control over my energy.

And that was just the beginning.

The entire day was a nightmare. I had:

Anxiety

Ghabrahat

Acidity

Full body discomfort

Upset stomach

Insomnia


I couldn‚Äôt even eat properly. I don‚Äôt know what went wrong‚Äîmaybe a specific ingredient hit me wrong‚Äîbut this was absolutely not normal, especially for someone used to caffeine.

Mujhe laga ke shayad first time MuscleBlaze ka pre workout use kiya isliye body adapt na kari ho, so I gave it another shot the next day. But same thing happened again.
Exact same crash, same anxiety, same discomfort. That confirmed for me that this product just doesn't suit my body.

And just to clarify‚ÄîI‚Äôve used pre workouts from other brands too (won‚Äôt name them because I don‚Äôt want it to seem like I‚Äôm promoting them), but those were way smoother, with a clean energy boost and no crash.

But with MuscleBlaze Pre Workout 200‚Äîone exercise in, and I was finished for the day. Spent the rest of it just lying in bed.

Sorry to say, but this pre workout didn‚Äôt work for me at all. I‚Äôm not here to bash the brand‚Äîmaybe it works for others‚Äîbut I personally won‚Äôt recommend it to anyone. Of course, your money, your choice.

Just thought I‚Äôd share an honest customer review.

I‚Äôm coming to you because every woman I talk to immediately hates him. They just don‚Äôt understand.

It sounds so weird. I‚Äôm not usually the one to ruminate on past relationships. And especially not ones that didn‚Äôt last too long. 

But end of ‚Äò23 I had gotten out of a very abusive relationship. All I had known was abuse. From family and friends. 

And then I met him. I didn‚Äôt think I liked him as much as I did at first. Wasn‚Äôt that attracted to him physically. After our first date, I didn‚Äôt think we‚Äôd see each other again because I just wasn‚Äôt that interested and he was so quiet, I didn‚Äôt think he liked me.

But we planned the second date. And just kept seeing each other. And he was so so nice. He was quiet, but when he‚Äôd throw his arms out for me to hug him when we‚Äôd see each other, I just knew he loved me.

I could tell he‚Äôs had trauma from a past relationship where he was cheated on (he was out of state for work for a while). We didn‚Äôt discuss it much. I didn‚Äôt pry. Our relationship was a slow burn. I hadn‚Äôt felt like this for anyone before. 

After three months, I asked him if he‚Äôd like to have kids someday and he got scared and broke things off. I didn‚Äôt fully understand why. Later, he dropped off the key I gave him (I had trusted him enough at that point), and a note citing he wanted to keep in touch, maybe talk things out in the future, try again, and he was sorry but he had pregnancy trauma. He opened up to me so much in that note in a way he hadn‚Äôt before.

He was always so stoic with his words. But what really set him apart was when he said he was going to do something for me, he did it always. Unlike past relationships. 

Before he left the note, I was sure he was just a cold person for dropping me. But after reading it it gave me a better understanding of his stoicism. It opened my eyes and all I wanted was to be there for him. Somehow.

We stayed in touch throughout the year. Seeing other people. But the whole time I was looking for someone to make me feel like he did. Whenever I thought I‚Äôd find it, I‚Äôd just get dropped. And I‚Äôd be sad, because it just made me miss him more.

I had wished for a long time that I‚Äôd never asked for the key back. Eventually, despite not seeing each other for months, he got the key back because he was the only person I trusted to housesit for me.

He‚Äôll still housesit if I ask. Won‚Äôt take a dime in return. He‚Äôll love on my animals and water my plants. My home is always in perfect condition when I return from trips. 

He still has the key. I don‚Äôt want it back. 

He‚Äôs moving a couple hours away in a month for work. Not sure when he‚Äôll be back. He agreed to meet for coffee next week.

It‚Äôll be the first time I‚Äôve seen him in over a year. I know it‚Äôs so stupid, dad. But even after a year, despite only dating three months, I still love him. And everyone that‚Äôs come after him has only made me miss him more.

He has a big heart. He‚Äôs obviously got his flaws and avoidances, but he has a big heart. That was really important to me after only getting the worst out of love my whole life. 

I just wanted to tell someone. And maybe not feel so crazy for still feeling this way. That kind of connection is rare these days and I‚Äôm sick of waiting for the ‚Äúnext best thing‚Äù when all I want is to make him coffee again. ",1,1746797423.0,DadForAMinute,4,1.0,False

1kiii3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/1kiii3e/request_for_advice_and_assistance_london/,Request for advice and assistance (London),"Good afternoon all.

I'm wondering if there are any professional photographers here who would be happy to have a conversation with me. (DM's, coffee, beer) on me.

Background here... I am 42 and in a heavy corporate job, as is my wife and we are discussing how we continue with the two of us in the types of jobs we are. It has been floated that perhaps I could quit and pull back a bit and maybe take up photography as a bit more of a serious thing.

I enjoy photography a lot, and although I have considered making it something more, I have always been heavily involved in work and not really had time to dedicate to it. This could potentially change.

I'm not looking at weddings, or pictures of peoples pets, but looking at ways of perhaps commissions, projects, expanding ways of getting my pictures noticed, or building to the level where they could be.

I'm not looking for a discussion on whether the work is good enough here. I understand that with anything like this, there is alot of work involved, and it is always a journey. But what I am reaching out to the community for is whether there is anyone willing to have a chat with me who has done anything like this, or has found success in this field who would let me pick their brains and hear about what they've done.

In my industry mentorship etc is really common, however i've found it quit difficult to find that sort of thing in this field in what I am looking for here.

Happy to pay for beers, and even if it turns out to be more than talking about a shared passion topic I would be really appreciative.

Thanks

I've recently acquired a pretty decent, in my opinion, setup for a home-barista. I got Delonghi EC.230BK (the one with regular, non pressurized 51mm portafilter) + Baratza Encore ESP + scale with a timer. Tamper and all that stuff too.  
If I make an Espresso from a local roastery (70/30 blend) it tastes fantastic. I set the grinder to 18 on espresso scale, pull about 40g of espresso out of 16g of beans (the standard portafilter won't fit more beans). Now it's all good but the price of that coffee is ridiculous :D

So I ordered Lavazza Espresso Italiano xD which is 100% Arabica, medium-dark roast. 2x cheaper than the local coffee. But no matter what I do it tastes sour. I cannot grind finer, because at grind level 15, the Delonghi struggles to push water through and there's channelling. At level 17 I get 32g (out of 16g beans) espresso within 25-30s, however it still tastes bitter.

Should I just pull larger shot? What are my options if I can't grind finer?",1,1746797238.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

Flight from St Lucia to Charlotte, NC got caught in a weather incident.... initially stacked for an hour before diverted to Charleston. Got refueled and took off for Charlotte again.... hot stacked again and got diverted to Columbia NC..... had to refuel again and change crew before finally making it to Charlotte.... so a 4hr flight ended up being 14hrs.

During this time we were just provided 2 biscuit packs, and 4 soft drinks or coffee.

When we got to Charlotte it took an hour to get bags. Many of us had connecting flights so had to go to the baggage assistance line where they had 2 agents.

During this time passengers that had rescheduled flights missed them due to the baggage and agent delay

I know weather incidents can happen but the mismanagement of the flight diversions, baggage and assistance was in their control. 

Add to that I had issues retrieving booking online.... only way to solve was to join their frequent flyer program. Usually I would use my BA OneWorld account but was unable to add and the check in agent was of no help in adding it as a Primary.

1kiig64,https://www.reddit.com/r/indianfitness/comments/1kiig64/hacks_to_increase_your_protein_intake_in_your/,"Hacks to increase your protein intake in your average Indian pure vegetarian diet without adding whey or anything fancy like oats, chia seeds, pumpkin seeds, quinoa etc. M[26]","It is a misconception that Indian food lacks protein. Indian food has enough protein options. It's just that you are not making the correct choices. Obviously, a diet of dal, rajma etc is not going to be as protein rich as a diet full of fish, chicken, meat and eggs, but you can easily get 100 grams of protein per day with your average Indian food items just by following these simple hacks:

#1. Eat better carb sources

Most vegetarian protein sources have a lot of carbs. So replace your main carb sources with protein rich carb sources. For example, if you are eating 3 rotis and 1 bowl of dal, eat 2 rotis and 2 bowls of dal. If you eat more rice than rajma/chhole whenever your mom prepares rajma/chhole-chawal, start consuming more rajma/chhole than rice.

You can almost double your protein intake in a meal by following this step.

#2. Eat mix dal instead of only 1 dal.

Each and every variety of dal has different macro and micro profile. Also since we know that most vegetarian protein sources are incomplete protein sources (they don't have all 9 essential amino acids), mixing 2-3 types of dal can fix this issue. 

Also you can have a different mixture everyday.

Make sure to have atleast 1 serving of mix dal per day. Dinner time is the best time to have it imo. 

#3. Make besan cheela a staple breakfast.

Besan cheela is a very quick and easy to make recipe which is very customisable too. Grate some paneer on top for extra protein. Have it with one 250 gram serving of curd.

3 besan cheelas with 250 grams of curd and a handful of nuts like almonds, cashews, walnuts etc is enough to give you 30+ grams of protein with a lot of healthy fats.

For variety, you can have moong dal cheela and besan cheela on alternate days. 

#4. Consume atleast 500 ml of milk and 500 g curd per day.

Dairy is one of the only complete sources of protein for vegetarians. So try to include as much as you can. Most Indians are not lactose intolerant. If you are, go for lactose free dairy.

500 ml of milk will give you roughly 15 grams of protein and 500 gram of curd will give you roughly 20 grams of protein. That is 35 grams of high quality protein without doing anything at all. 

You can  break it down into multiple servings. For example, I have 250 grams of curd in breakfast and 250 grams in lunch. 

You can break down 500 ml of milk into 2 servings of 250 ml. First serving of 250 ml can be further broken down into multiple servings of tea and coffee that we usually have and then one glass of 250 ml turmeric latte (haldi wala doodh) before you sleep along with a handful of nuts like almonds, walnuts etc to finish your day.

You can have low fat or skimmed dairy if you are cautious about calories and saturated fat content.

#5. Swith to mutigrain atta

You can either purchase multigrain atta from the market or you can purchase whole grains in the ratio you prefer and get the atta made by your local atta mill.

I add an equal mixture of kala chana, bajra, raagi, soya chunks and maize flour (2 kg each so a total of 10 kg) with 15 kg of wheat to make a total of 25 kg multigrain atta. This hack alone will add roughly 5-10 grams of protein per day depending on how many rotis you consume without any extra effort at all.

#6. Better snacks

Snack on roasted chana, kala chana chaat, boiled chickpea chaat, sprouts, peanuts etc.

#Ending notes

By following these hacks you can easily reach 100 grams of protein per day. Yes it's not as good as eating chicken or eggs but not everyone can eat such foods due to various reasons. 

30 gram high protein breakfast, 35 grams protein from dairy, 10 grams protein from snacks, roughly 25 grams of protein from 2 servings of dal/rajma/chhole along with multi grain roti is enough to give you 90 grams of protein per day.

You can add 100 grams of paneer randomly here and there per day to take this number to 100+.

Also don't get me wrong. I have nothing against oats or the fancy stuff like chia seeds, pumpkin seeds etc. I myself consume things like oats, muesli, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, chia seeds etc. This post was just an attempt to show that it is possible to have a high protein diet by just eating staple indian foods.",2,1746797173.0,indianfitness,0,1.0,False

I wanted to share a super simple 7-day mindfulness ritual I‚Äôve been using every morning and evening to reset my energy, get clear-headed, and stop spiraling into stress mode. It‚Äôs low-effort but surprisingly powerful. No apps, no fancy gear, just presence.

The 7-Day Ritual (Morning + Evening Bookends)

Each day has a theme. The idea is to give your mind one thing to focus on, morning and night. I do 5‚Äì10 minutes each time. Optional: journal 1‚Äì2 sentences after.

‚∏ª

Day 1: Breathe & Notice
Morning: 10 deep belly breaths. Count slowly to 4 on the inhale, 6 on the exhale.
Evening: Sit in silence for 5 minutes. Don‚Äôt change anything just notice.
Mantra: ‚ÄúI am here.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Day 2: Gratitude Scan
Morning: Think of 3 tiny things you‚Äôre grateful for (warm blanket, morning light, coffee smell).
Evening: Replay your day and find 1 thing you appreciated, no matter how small.
Mantra: ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Day 3: Ground Your Body
Morning: Stand barefoot (inside is fine), breathe, and feel your feet on the ground.
Evening: Gentle stretch nothing intense, just loosening up the neck, shoulders, and hips.
Mantra: ‚ÄúI am grounded.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Day 4: Intentional Pause
Morning: Before your phone, take 3 deep breaths and ask: ‚ÄúWhat do I want from today?‚Äù
Evening: Sit and reflect: ‚ÄúWhat did I give today? What did I keep?‚Äù
Mantra: ‚ÄúI choose.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Day 5: Kindness Check-In
Morning: Send one kind thought to someone (even if they pissed you off).
Evening: Forgive someone. Say it mentally: ‚ÄúI let this go.‚Äù
Mantra: ‚ÄúPeace in, peace out.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Day 6: Stillness Practice
Morning: Set a timer for 5 minutes. Sit with no agenda. Just be.
Evening: Same thing. Let the day dissolve in quiet. No fixing, no thinking.
Mantra: ‚ÄúThis moment is enough.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Day 7: Self-Honoring
Morning: Ask: ‚ÄúWhat do I need today?‚Äù Honor that as best you can.
Evening: Celebrate 1 win, no matter how small. You showed up.
Mantra: ‚ÄúI honor myself.‚Äù


What changed for me:
I used to wake up with racing thoughts, scroll mindlessly, and crash into bed exhausted. This ritual created a little container around each day. It gives me presence and direction, and it‚Äôs become one of the few habits I actually miss when I skip it.

Capitalism commodifies ethics, turning systemic change into consumer choices that often reinforce the very system they claim to oppose.  The vegan burger is the Starbucks coffee in this analogy, a way to sell absolution while maintaining the status quo.

A vegan/vegetarian who claims he ""doesn't do evil""? That‚Äôs the delusion of ideology. Every choice under capitalism is tainted, your phone has cobalt mined by child slaves, your clothes are stitched in sweatshops, your vegan quinoa displaces Bolivian farmers. You don‚Äôt get to opt out of exploitation; you just get to pick which kind you participate in. The moment you believe your hands are clean, you‚Äôve lost the plot, you're completely lost in your delusion.

Calling ""strawman"" is just a way to deflect. The real strawman is pretending ethical consumption exists in the first place. You want to believe your choices matter in a vacuum, but they don‚Äôt. The system ensures that no matter what you buy, someone suffers for it. The question isn‚Äôt ""Am I evil?"",it‚Äôs ""How do I fight the system that makes evil inevitable?""

Vegans who think they‚Äôve escaped complicity are like pacifists who pay taxes for bombs. You can‚Äôt just ""opt out"" of exploitation by changing your diet. The only real ethical stance is to admit you‚Äôre complicit, and then work to destroy the machine, not just rearrange your shopping list",5,1746796785.0,vegancirclejerk,2,0.86,False

And he mentioned if anybody breaks the rules, they get 2 warnings before their terminated.

Before I said anything, he told me im terminated, he had security escort me to my locked to clean my stuff out then I got escorted out of the building.

My stomach is confused.


Cheat days! Are cheat days allowed? I feel like I'm driving myself a little insane and maybe going a little too hard. Let's say I gave myself a cheat day every Saturday. I allow myself maybe 50 carbs. Would that be okay?

Also, would you still technically be following the diet if all of your carbs came in 1 meal? I've kind of been following the OMAD diet unintentionally the last few years of my life. Sometimes I continue to do this while doing low carb. If I'm only eating one meal, am I allowed to eat all of my carbs in one meal? Let's say I want one of those big sugary, carby, sweet coffees. Could I allow myself to have it as long a I limit to 0 the rest of the day?


Maybe notable:

I am doing low carb more for microbiome/gastrointestinal benefits than weight loss. I took a probiotic supplement a few months ago and my entire body has been screwed up since. My doctors are at a loss. I've been reading low carb can help though, so I'm giving it a shot. Although I certainly wouldn't mind losing weight as well!",1,1746796519.0,lowcarb,2,1.0,False

1kii60i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness_India/comments/1kii60i/hacks_to_increase_your_protein_intake_in_your/,"Hacks to increase your protein intake in your average Indian diet pure vegetarian without adding whey or anything fancy like oats, chia seeds, quinoa etc.","It is a misconception that Indian food lacks protein. Indian food has enough protein options. It's just that you are not making the correct choices. Obviously, a diet of dal, rajma etc is not going to be as protein rich as a diet full of fish, chicken, meat and eggs, but you can easily get 100 grams of protein per day with your average Indian food items just by following these simple hacks:

#1. Eat better carb sources

Most vegetarian protein sources have a lot of carbs. So replace your main carb sources with protein rich carb sources. For example, if you are eating 3 rotis and 1 bowl of dal, eat 2 rotis and 2 bowls of dal. If you eat more rice than rajma/chhole whenever your mom prepares rajma/chhole-chawal, start consuming more rajma/chhole than rice.

You can almost double your protein intake in a meal by following this step.

#2. Eat mix dal instead of only 1 dal.

Each and every variety of dal has different macro and micro profile. Also since we know that most vegetarian protein sources are incomplete protein sources (they don't have all 9 essential amino acids), mixing 2-3 types of dal can fix this issue. 

Also you can have a different mixture everyday.

Make sure to have atleast 1 serving of mix dal per day. Dinner time is the best time to have it imo. 

#3. Make besan cheela a staple breakfast.

Besan cheela is a very quick and easy to make recipe which is very customisable too. Grate some paneer on top for extra protein. Have it with one 250 gram serving of curd.

3 besan cheelas with 250 grams of curd and a handful of nuts like almonds, cashews, walnuts etc is enough to give you 30+ grams of protein with a lot of healthy fats.

For variety, you can have moong dal cheela and besan cheela on alternate days. 

#4. Consume atleast 500 ml of milk and 500 g curd per day.

Dairy is one of the only complete sources of protein for vegetarians. So try to include as much as you can. Most Indians are not lactose intolerant. If you are, go for lactose free dairy.

500 ml of milk will give you roughly 15 grams of protein and 500 gram of curd will give you roughly 20 grams of protein. That is 35 grams of high quality protein without doing anything at all. 

You can  break it down into multiple servings. For example, I have 250 grams of curd in breakfast and 250 grams in lunch. 

You can break down 500 ml of milk into 2 servings of 250 ml. First serving of 250 ml can be further broken down into multiple servings of tea and coffee that we usually have and then one glass of 250 ml turmeric latte (haldi wala doodh) before you sleep along with a handful of nuts like almonds, walnuts etc to finish your day.

You can have low fat or skimmed dairy if you are cautious about calories and saturated fat content.

#5. Swith to mutigrain atta

You can either purchase multigrain atta from the market or you can purchase whole grains in the ratio you prefer and get the atta made by your local atta mill.

I add an equal mixture of kala chana, bajra, raagi, soya chunks and maize flour (2 kg each so a total of 10 kg) with 15 kg of wheat to make a total of 25 kg multigrain atta. This hack alone will add roughly 5-10 grams of protein per day depending on how many rotis you consume without any extra effort at all.

#6. Better snacks

Snack on roasted chana, kala chana chaat, boiled chickpea chaat, sprouts, peanuts etc.

#Ending notes

By following these hacks you can easily reach 100 grams of protein per day. Yes it's not as good as eating chicken or eggs but not everyone can eat such foods due to various reasons. 

30 gram high protein breakfast, 35 grams protein from dairy, 10 grams protein from snacks, roughly 25 grams of protein from 2 servings of dal/rajma/chhole along with multi grain roti is enough to give you 90 grams of protein per day.

You can add 100 grams of paneer randomly here and there per day to take this number to 100+.

Also don't get me wrong. I have nothing against oats or the fancy stuff like chia seeds, pumpkin seeds etc. I myself consume things like oats, muesli, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, chia seeds etc. This post was just an attempt to show that it is possible to have a high protein diet by just eating staple indian foods.",15,1746796372.0,Fitness_India,4,0.86,False

The cardboard packaging they came in states ""16 servings, serving size 1 tbsp"". This means each stick can be divided into 8 pieces, each 1 tbsp. This is useful because I use exactly 2 tablespoons of butter in my morning coffee (don't gag, it's really good). The keen eyed among you will notice that is an additional line, to wit:

1. Cut off the two ends to account for misalignment (at #1 and #9). This is block 1.
2. There are 7 cuts left (#2 - #8), totalling 8 blocks
3. That equals 9 blocks.

So either:

1. I'm getting more value for money (18 tbsps per container instead of 16, yay!), or 
2. Each piece is fractionally less than 1 tbsp. This is the preferred answer.

This used to not be the case. They used to have the correct number of lines with the letters ""tbsp"" between them.

I'm infuriated by this for so many reasons. Why bother putting the lines on the paper if they mean nothing? Why don't they put the correct number of lines on there? It would be just as easy as putting the wrong number of lines on there. Why did they change it?

It's so annoying when I'm dividing the butter into 2 tbsp because I have to move the knife left or right of the lines a certain amount and the mental gymnastics in the morning is just extremely infuriating, especially as I haven't had coffee yet.

I'm here because when I emailed this to the Kerrigold support email, they gaslit me. I'm thinking they're playing psychological games with me. If my brain sees more lines, I think to myself ""Wow, Kerrigold are so generous, they provide more butter than the other brands"". They know I'm on to them.

We had been looking forward to a weekend getaway ‚Äî something small, just time together as a family. But earlier today, he came home from work and told me his boss asked him to work over the weekend. No overtime, just another obligation ‚Äî and just like that, our plans were gone. I lost my temper. I told him how frustrated I was that he earns so little ‚Äî barely enough for the three of us ‚Äî and still can‚Äôt prioritize family time. He works in the government, so there‚Äôs no additional pay for the extra hours, and it feels like he can never say no, even when it costs us.

I brought up something I‚Äôve been holding in for a while ‚Äî that he should consider switching to the private sector, where the pay would be better. I‚Äôm also working in the private sector, earning about the same as he does, but with less responsibility. And yet, I still manage the house, the chores, and our toddler, on top of my job. It doesn‚Äôt feel fair. I feel overwhelmed, unsupported, and honestly, exhausted. I‚Äôve started questioning my decision to be with someone who seems unwilling ‚Äî or maybe unable ‚Äî to stand up for himself, or for us.

Later today, I asked for a couple of hours to myself. I left our daughter with him, made it clear she needed to be fed, and stepped out just to get a coffee and breathe. When I came back, she was still glued to the iPad, unfed, and he was on his phone. That moment pushed me over the edge. I felt completely invisible ‚Äî like all my effort, all my stress, didn‚Äôt matter. I lost control. I started throwing things around the house. I was furious, overwhelmed, and scared ‚Äî mostly of myself.

This isn‚Äôt how I want to live. I‚Äôm afraid of the anger building up inside me, of what it could turn into if I don‚Äôt find a way to let it out safely and constructively.

1kii0eg,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1kii0eg/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

I am a bot clueless and lost as I have never been in this kind of situation; so I would like to ask for your insight. 
Sorry for the long intro; I am trying to be as detailed as possible.

Background:

-Previous to this; I have never called in sick and I have been performing my tasks to the satisfaction of my employer.
However; this year I called in sick twice for 1-1week in March and April and now I have been on a sick leave for the past 2 weeks due to a pretty serious and complex issue that is way beyond my powers to solve. It took me a really long time to accept this but I could not push myself further without damage.

I have been in contact with my house doctor who was kind enough to forward me to a ""mental health nurse""; who after hearing me out helped me secure an appointment with a psychiatrist to start the bettering of my situation.

I am employed on a temporary contract that will end the 30th of June. This is my 2nd 1 year contract and they should either give me a permanent one or finish our cooperation - I have no illusions as to which one is more realistic.


Fast forward today; my supervisor called me to invite me for a ""coffee"" and talk about my future within the company. I told them I am unable to attend and I would like to talk to the company doctor. They insisted on talking to me and after I repeated the same respond 3x they offered to do it via videocall. **They also said that they dont want me to talk about my illness; just about work.**
I accepted their offer just to make them go away.
Before hanging up the boss told me that they are available to me if I need anything - I feel this was done in a manipulative way; to make me trust them and be open to talk.

This upset me a bit as not thinking about my employment helped me to calm down and relax; and finally start taking care about myself.

It goes without saying that my time at the company is playing a big role in my situation and at the same time I am fearing for my future as I will probably be made redundant for not being able to do my work.
I am also pretty sour; since I gave my (over)time to the company whenever they asked and now that feels a bit pointless.

However; what is the most important to me is being okay and I cant have this thing playing with my head as it does now.

My questions are:
- can they force me to talk to them since I am on a sick leave
- or should rather I keep on asking for the company doctor?
- since I am dead sure that my contract will not be renewed what is the best course of action with the company? total ignorance? or coming to an agreement?

Thank you very much for taking your time to read my post and share your thoughts.

3). I do intermittent fasting....not every day, but days I do cardio only or I don't work out I won't eat breakfast and then will eat lunch/dinner/snack in between noon-6:00pm (give or take).

4). 3 days a week I cardio right when I wake up, have a few sips of black coffee and then go.   Fasted cardio.  Usually an exercise bike.

5). 2 days a week I do interval training, mixed with a little cardio.  I have some light weight dumbbells (25/30) and I do 4 rounds of (pushups/overhead press/curls/rows) mostly to exhaustion.

6). I never ever eat after dinner.

7)  On special occasions (birthday/christmas/thanksgiving/etc) I will enjoy that piece of cake/pie/cookies.

8). I go to the movies maybe once every couple of months...I get that box of milk duds and enjoy the movie and the candy.

During the 5 months of no-contact that followed I got into therapy, started going to the gym, switched schools and made new friends. I didn't think we would get back together, but I realised I really needed to work on myself and decided to wait 2 months before attempting to date/go out with other people again. Around January 2025 I had my first and only one-night stand and went home crying because sleeping with someone else made me realise how much I missed my ex. I waited another month and finally decided to break no-contact. My ex answered instantly and we agreed to meet and catch up. The coffee date we had planned turned into a sleepover and we soon decided to give our relationship a second chance. After a couple of weeks of perfect dates, long conversations, beautiful days spent together, we had the difficult ""did you see other people while we were broken up"" conversation. My (now) partner admitted she had downloaded a dating app the day after our breakup and started going out with this one girl 2 weeks later. They dated for 4 months but never made it official because they were too incompatible. The girl she dated had unreciprocated feelings for my partner.

When I learned this I spent a whole night crying. I felt so replaceable and unworthy of love. Knowing my (then) ex was able to move on (even if not fully) THAT fast while I honoured what we had and actually put in the work to become a better human made me feel SO lost. I talked to her about it and she reminded me single people can act as they please, and also said that she desperately needed a confidence boost after being turned down for months while we were together in 2024.

I was able to put this behind me because I was reassured by my partner about the importance I hold in her life now. She is incredibly sweet, caring, generous and kind to me. Fast forward two months, I am beginning to feel like I lacked self-respect by getting back together with her. Though she is an AMAZING partner, I am ridden by insecurities and fears. I get triggered by songs, movie-plots, videos online etc... I often wonder if a person who actually respects themselves would ever get back with someone who moved on so fast after a breakup. I don't know how to go about these thoughts I have. I am plagued by the image of my partner going out with another person while I was crying in thearapy, or the knowledge that while I was carefully picking myself back up, she was already in another person's bed.

I know this sounds incredibly insecure, I realise I'm falling in a loophole. Has anyone gone through something similar? What can I do to stop feeling like I'm dumb for going back?

TLDR: my partner is great to me now but knowing she dated someone else 2 weeks after our split is making me feel resentful towards her",2,1746795418.0,relationships,24,0.56,False
1kihtm1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kihtm1,1 month solo trip review,"Just came back from an incredible one-month solo trip in China ‚Äì didn‚Äôt speak a word of Chinese, and I was honestly blown away by how easy, organized and welcoming the experience was.I expected confusion and chaos. Instead, I found bullet trains everywhere, taxis and Didi rides even in remote areas, and super efficient transport systems.
Alipay was a lifesaver. I used it to pay for everything, rent bikes, book travel cards, and even buy snacks. Not many people speak English, but everyone was polite and eager to help. With gestures, smiles, and Google Translate, I never felt stuck.

I assumed Chinese food would be heavy and salty ‚Äì not at all. Most of the dishes I tried were light, fresh, and easy to digest.
Street food was consistently good, and even simple restaurants served amazing meals.

Shanghai sleek and dynamic. Loved the French Concession, coolest area in the city. Also Nu gardens, Trade tower. 

Suzhou honestly, didn‚Äôt love it. Aside from a couple of bridges over canals, it felt a bit flat and overly touristic.

Hangzhou One of the biggest surprises! The West Lake walk, the gardens, and especially the sunset from Leifeng Pagoda ‚Äì breathtaking. Very green and peaceful city. Xixi Wetland Park was also very chill.

Changsha great vibe, lots of young people, cool neighborhoods with tiny bars and local eateries. Totally underrated.

Zhangjiajie A must-see. But be warned ‚Äì it‚Äôs packed with loud tour groups. If you go expecting serenity and birdsong‚Ä¶ nope. You need at least 2 full days to see the Avatar mountains. Tianmen Mountain is a one-day thing, with a set path ‚Äì not much room for wandering.

Fenghuang County Super relaxing. A night boat ride under the lights is a great way to take it all in.

Guilin ‚Äì Yangshuo Did the river cruise and the scenery was stunning. Yangshuo was one of my favorites: rent a scooter, explore villages, drink coffee, eat noodles in random corners. I stumbled into an open-air light show on a lake, directed by the guy who did the Olympic opening ceremony ‚Äì literal chills.

Zhaoxing Dong Village hidden gem. Standing above the rice terraces was an amazing moment.

Guiyang A bit wild. Didn‚Äôt see a single other foreigner in 3 days. Locals stared a bit more (not in a bad way ‚Äì just curiosity). Qianlingshan Park with monkeys was cool. Tianhetan was another nice escape. But overall, not a ‚Äúmust‚Äù for me.

Chengdu (1st May = chaos)Arrived on a national holiday... big mistake. So many people. Yulin District was great though ‚Äì relaxed, cool cafes, fewer tourists. People‚Äôs Park is worth a visit. I had my ears professionally cleaned and they pulled out a massive chunk of wax‚Ä¶ I literally hear better now. As for the pandas‚Ä¶ honestly overhyped. Full of gift shops and crowds. Saw 4 pandas total, left after 2 hours. Food was great, but so spicy ‚Äì didn‚Äôt matter what I ordered, it was always drenched in chili.

Chongqing Very cinematic! Sunsets by the river were beautiful. The urban layout is interesting ‚Äì stacked levels, tunnels, overlapping highways‚Ä¶But some areas get zero sunlight and that‚Äôs wild to see. Chongqing is impressive, but I personally preferred Chengdu for food, bars, and overall vibe. Maybe a bit overhyped on socials but still cool to visit! During the skywalk there was a thick haze in the sky and I could stare at the sun with no sunglasses, really cool atmosphere and experience!! 


Final Thoughts and Small Details

The country is insanely well organized. Trains on time, clean public spaces, and smooth travel overall.
Tons of public toilets, and most were clean ‚Äì huge win.
Loved using bikes to explore cities ‚Äì always available, easy to rent via Alipay.
People dress naturally, with little makeup or flashy fashion. There‚Äôs a feeling of collective harmony rather than individuality.

The Less Fun Stuff

Horns everywhere. Cars, scooters‚Ä¶ even on sidewalks.
Random high-cc motorcycles on sidewalks.
Loudspeaker sellers looping the same sentence all day.
Nobody waits for people to get off the metro before pushing in.
Still not sure why no restaurants had soy sauce on the table.

If you think solo travel in China is hard: it‚Äôs really not.
I didn‚Äôt speak the language and still had an unforgettable, smooth, exciting trip thanks to the tech, people, and infrastructure.
Highly recommend ‚Äì just go with curiosity and patience.

I'm writing here for the first time, but I have a question that I think needs to be asked by those more familiar with the language than I am.

I recently watched a Danish series on Netflix and noticed that most of the dialogues related to, for example: ordering coffee or asking for things were like : ‚ÄúKaffe/Noget, tak‚Äù. Even deepL translator suggest such translation. It sounds a bit like an order (‚ÄúCoffee, thanks‚Äù), but there's a good chance I misunderstood it.

Is this a legitimate form of asking for something without sounding rude or was it a manner of speech of the characters in the series ? If it's the second, how can I do it correctly to sound right (according to certain manners/culture in Denmark) ?

I took some and wasn't sure what to do with the extra time. I signed up for a promo and did 100 deliveries to find out what its like. Overall it's interesting, you go to places you might not normally. You see restaurants that a popular and might like to visit some time later. But its a bit of a grind to make money. I have a company car, no labels and no cost, employer lets me take it on holidays so why not. So I had that as a bonus as in no real costs. But still the average was $25-30 p/h even if sometimes I was doing doing chores and not too bothered by doing all the right things. Like cancelling bad orders. Not going to certain places. Wait times can be a killer. In the four weeks I had no complaints. Very few tips. I rejected a few orders, etc. Think there was a note saying if I reject 'exclusive' orders then I put customers wait times up. But then they put those exclusive orders on the back of orders already picked up, then you get to the second one to wait another 10 minutes. So they both end up with old cold food. The bonus 'quest' nights are OK if you haul ass, with $40-50 was possible, but you're working friday/sunday night, drunks on the road, and when it's dark it can be difficult to find places. Overall if you looking for something SUPER casual and interested to see what is popular in your area it's worth a try. There are some areas where you can get decent jobs, light industrial you might run a box 50km for some coin and they often tip $10 or more. Places I didn't enjoy were certain restaurants for their wait times. Those ice cream places because the stuff can be annoying to drive with. Those 'bonus' orders next door to a pickup for $5 i mostly rejected, as they piggy back on big orders. Pet Barm didn't seem to pay much but seemed the easiest in that it was always ready and in a box. Not some wonky four coffee bag or soups. Sometimes I'd accept an 'bonus $5 extra'  order then see there was 2 cases of 24 water and ice cream and reject it. It's not worth the effort. But over all wasn't too bad. Made a bit of coin for a decent holiday and might pick it up again if there is nothing else to do. Overall I think you should tip the drivers. The costs are huge. The grind is real.

1kihs1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lifeguards/comments/1kihs1e/some_guidance_needed/,Some guidance needed.,"None of the flairs really match, but I feel that the people here will best understand what's going on. Part of the reason for making this post is just so I have a place where this is documented.

Context/backstory.

We're calling the man in this story, Bob. Bob is my head lifeguard, instructor, and possible future employer. He works both at my pool and at the college pool. He's 60 years old and incredibly fit and strong. I first started feeling uncomfortable around Bob when I was a patron at this pool. It seemed that Bob spent a lot of time talking to tables that had women sitting at them and that he was very physically close with the female lifeguards, with most being teenagers, this irked me. I was 17 myself. At the end of the summer, Bob came and sat at my table and said he's been watching me swim all summer and I seemed like a strong swimmer, he asked me to consider lifeguarding next year. Next year rolled around, and I was actually super into the idea, so I contacted the pool owner who redirected me to Bob, and I signed up for his class. 

""Incidents""

Money.
I paid $300 dollars for this class. I went out of the classroom during a break in victim recognition to go pee. When I came back, Bob was in the hall waiting for me. He looked up and down the hallway as if he was making sure no one was watching before handing me back $200 dollars. I told my mom about this because it made me feel anxious and like i owed him something, and she was actually pretty worried about it. So I actually asked in this sub about it and was told to ""drop the class and leave this nice man alone"" and several other comments like that one. So I suddenly felt very guilty for being uncomfortable in the situation. I decided it wasn't a big deal and continued the class. Once I started lifeguarding, he bought me a nice waterproof watch. A shark leash. He still, to this day, has not let me pay him back anything. It makes me uncomfortable to be in debt to him, but I feel guilty for being uncomfortable at the same time.

Boundaries.
At this point, I've been lifeguarding for a while, and Bob is having a very hard time respecting my boundaries. He will not stop touching my hair. The first time it happened, I and another coworker my age were leaning on the snack counter, waiting for patrons to arrive.  Conveniently, both pool owners (my bosses) were busy elsewhere this day, and Bob was in charge. He walked over and picked up Coworkers iced coffee and held it against her butt asking, ""Oh, is that cold?"" when she physically recoiled. Then he walked over to me and sort of flapped my braids like people do with those ropes in the gym. I sort of pulled away, and he looked very offended. Oh well, that's the end of that. But it wasn't. Later, he pulls me aside and asks if it ""offended"" me that he touched my hair. I told him offended isn't the right word, but yes, I'd prefer that he didn't touch my hair without asking me. He went on for a little bit about how we were all just so close to each other as lifeguards (part of why I'm posting this here so someone can tell me if this is normal or not). Oh, well. I communicated not to do it. That's the end of it, right? No. Next time it happens, he ruffles my hair, and I tell him not to do that. He says he forgot. Summer ends, and I don't want to stop swimming, Bob gives me the offer of coming to the local college pool and swimming, I accept. I come to the pool, and this time, he tugs on my braids rather than sort of flipping them. I tell him not to do that. He says he forgot. Later that same day, he pulls me aside again to ask me if that offended me again. I tell him, yet again, that offended isn't the right word, but that I'd like him to respect my wishes and not do that. He says, ""I'm sorry, i just really like long hair. When I was a baby, I'd twist my mama's hair around my finger at the nape of her neck, and when she was gone, I'd do that with the babysitter. It soothed me. I just really like long hair. I just didn't want you to think that me tugging on your braids meant i wanted you and me in the back office room. "" WOAH. My brain didn't go there. Why did your brain go there? My thoughts were, ""Someone is touching me without consent, and I don't like it."" Why did your brain go to something sexual??? Also. The hair thing? (I have 2¬Ω feet of hair) Why are you telling me this??? I was so uncomfortable. 

Weirdly personal shit.
He tells me things that are very, very personal. One day, when I was swimming at the college pool, he told me that him and his girlfriend hadn't been sexually active in months. Unprovoked. Like. Okay?? Why are you telling me this???

Escalation. 
After a while of swimming at the college pool, he asked me if I wanted to sit in on lifeguarding classes and learn how to teach. I accepted. I regret this decision heavily, to be honest. The more he saw me, the more comfortable he got and the less comfortable I got. He started demanding that I hug him when I saw him, and if I forgot to, he'd say, ""What you don't love me anymore?"". One time, he asked for his hug, and I gave him this super awkward side hug. He said, ""Oh, hug me like you mean it,"" and grabbed my arm to wrap it around him. Then he wrapped his arms back around me in a very tight hug and then. Once I couldn't move. He kissed me on the head. I just kinda stood there frozen. I opened my mouth to say something, and nothing came out. It was at this point that I broke down to my mom crying, saying I didn't wanna do the class anymore. I didn't wanna be around him anymore. I didn't know what to do.

You can't tell this man ""no.""
While I was ""helping"" him teach, it snowed. (Very rare where I live) I told him I wouldn't be at class that day because I wasn't driving in it, and neither was my mom. He said he'd pick me up. I said okay. Couple days later there's still snow on the ground but this is after he kissed me, so I didn't say anything about the roads, I actually didn't give a reason at all, I just told him I wouldn't be at class today. My message said, ""I'm not coming to class today, I'll see you Friday at 5."" He said, ""I'll be there to pick you up in 30min"" from then on out any time I told him I wouldn't be there, he told me he was just gonna give me a ride.

I can't think of anything else at the moment and I've been writing this for some time, but I may edit and add other things that have happened because, as I said, part of the reason for this is documentation. But please give me insight if you have any, and if you can think of a better place for me to post this to get better insight, please let me know. My bosses have been working with him for like 20years and I have a feeling if I bring it to them they'll just say ""oh that's just how he is"" type stuff, but also let me know if this is something i should tell my bosses. 

Tldr: my 60yr old instructor is making me uncomfortable, and he's doing a decent job of making me doubt myself and think it's normal when deep down I'm pretty sure it's not. ",1,1746795284.0,Lifeguards,2,1.0,False

Hey fellow food enthusiasts! Chef here with my hands-on experience using the Potane Precision Vacuum Machine (VS5736). If you're debating whether this vacuum sealer is worth the investment, I'm here to share my professional insights after putting it through extensive testing.

## Design & Build Quality

The Potane strikes an impressive balance between form and function. With its sleek stainless steel finish and black accents, it has that professional kitchen vibe without screaming for attention. At 11""L x 6.5""W x 5""H and weighing 6.5 pounds, it's substantial without hogging precious counter space.

What truly sets this machine apart is the thoughtful design touches:
- **Built-in bag storage and cutter** - Create custom-sized bags without hunting for scissors
- **One-handed operation** - Lock the lid with one hand while holding your food with the other
- **C-type half-wrapped chamber** - Keeps vital components protected from kitchen splatter

## Performance Highlights

This baby has some serious chops when it comes to performance:
- **Dual food modes** - Specialized settings for both dry and moist foods
- **8mm sealing element** - Creates wider, more reliable seals than many competitors
- **Impressive stamina** - Can handle up to 100 consecutive seals without breaking a sweat
- **Manual and automatic options** - Perfect for both beginners and control freaks (like me!)

I tested it with everything from coffee beans to marinated chicken for sous vide cooking. For moist foods, the dedicated setting prevents liquid from being sucked into the sealing mechanism - a common issue with lesser machines.

## Tech Specs at a Glance

| Feature | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| Dimensions | 11""L x 6.5""W x 5""H |
| Weight | 6.5 Pounds |
| Power | 110 Watts, 120V |
| Sealing Width | 8mm element (3mm seal) |
| Included Accessories | 2 Bag Rolls (11""x16' and 8""x16'), Extra Foam Gasket |
| Warranty | 5-Year |

## Pros & Cons

### What I Love
* Incredibly intuitive design and operation
* Built-in storage and cutter are game-changers
* Creates consistently strong, reliable seals
* Handles both dry and moist foods with ease
* Solid build quality with impressive 5-year warranty
* Perfect for bulk meal prep sessions

### Room for Improvement
* Not whisper-quiet (though the noise isn't offensive)
* Like all vacuum sealers, requires technique for very wet foods
* Some third-party jumbo bag rolls might be a tight fit

## Who Should Buy This?

This machine hits a sweet spot for various users:

* **Beginners**: Clear controls and one-touch operation make this very approachable
* **Regular home cooks**: If you meal prep, buy in bulk, or sous vide, this is your new best friend
* **Serious food enthusiasts**: Robust enough for heavy use, though not quite commercial-grade

## Alternative Options

If you're still comparison shopping, consider:

1. **Nesco VS-12 Deluxe**: Notable for its double heat seal feature
2. **FoodSaver V4400**: Offers automatic bag detection and handheld sealer attachment
3. **Anova Culinary Precision**: Popular with the sous vide crowd

## Final Verdict

After extensive testing, the Potane VS5736 has genuinely impressed me. At around $150, it delivers professional-grade performance with thoughtful design features that make it a joy to use. The built-in storage, reliable sealing, and versatile food modes make this a standout option.

Whether you're looking to extend food freshness, save money by buying in bulk, or dive deeper into sous vide cooking, this machine delivers exceptional value. The 5-year warranty is just icing on the cake.

‚∏ª

1. San Salvador ‚Äì The capital: where traffic is eternal, everyone‚Äôs a wannabe influencer, and you can‚Äôt walk five meters without tripping over a pupuser√≠a or someone yelling about Bitcoin.

2. La Libertad ‚Äì Great beaches, but good luck enjoying them when the weekend traffic from San Salvador turns the whole highway into a parking lot. Surf City? More like Smog City.

3. Santa Ana ‚Äì Known for coffee and the volcano‚Äîbecause there‚Äôs nothing like bragging about your volcano while ignoring your crumbling roads. Also, can someone explain why the buses always blast reggaet√≥n at 120 decibels?

4. San Miguel ‚Äì So hot, it should be classified as a sauna. People from here brag like it‚Äôs Miami, but it‚Äôs mostly just sweat and loud motorcycles. Also, stop pretending Carnaval is an excuse for every sin imaginable.

5. La Uni√≥n ‚Äì Everyone talks about the port that was supposed to bring riches. Instead, it brought‚Ä¶ well, nothing. It‚Äôs the department of ‚Äúalmost.‚Äù

6. Chalatenango ‚Äì Cold, remote, and full of cows. Feels like the Switzerland of El Salvador‚Äîif Switzerland had potholes and spotty cell service.

7. Usulut√°n ‚Äì Famous for Jiquilisco Bay‚Ä¶ and mosquitoes that could be classified as military-grade. Also, where dreams go to get stuck in rural traffic.

8. Ahuachap√°n ‚Äì Hot springs, cool vibe‚Äîbut also the birthplace of ‚Äúwhat if we just never fixed anything?‚Äù Still, shoutout to people trying to make tourism a thing here.

9. Cuscatl√°n ‚Äì It‚Äôs like the middle child of departments: nobody talks about it, nobody visits, but it somehow survives. Ilobasco‚Äôs ceramics are the only reason people remember it exists.

10. Caba√±as ‚Äì A mix of beautiful nature and ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt ask what we do here.‚Äù It‚Äôs the quiet introvert of departments. Shoutout to Sensuntepeque for trying to stay relevant.

11. San Vicente ‚Äì Has a cool volcano and‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs it. Even locals get bored and end up in San Salvador by age 25. No offense, but your tourism campaign needs CPR.

12. Sonsonate ‚Äì Known for Izalco and a ‚Äúcoastal attitude‚Äù that‚Äôs really just an excuse for being late to everything. Still, great tamales. We‚Äôll give you that.

13. Moraz√°n ‚Äì Guerrilla history, amazing views‚Ä¶ and yet it still feels stuck in the 1980s. They say it‚Äôs peaceful now, but even the Wi-Fi is hiding in the mountains.

14. La Paz ‚Äì The name says ‚Äúpeace,‚Äù but try saying that while sweating in Zacatecoluca traffic. Half beach, half swamp, and somehow still has more political drama than a telenovela. The airport‚Äôs technically here, but no one gives La Paz credit‚Äîit‚Äôs the background character of El Salvador.",6,1746794363.0,ElSalvador,1,0.8,False

Who are you...
Youve made your expirience, you know who you are, you know what you like and what you need. You crave good communication and its your first step in trying to solve something. You aint a Party person because it doesnt appeal to you, the loud noice, your friends with who youd like to talk to but your voice aint able to scream over the music. The unwanted touches while moving to the beat.

You are able to enjoy the little things more then the biggest suprises. The ready cup of coffee, the Look at you while he things you wouldnt notice. The Grass on your toes. Being able to sit in silence engaged in your own Hobby but still trying to move even an inch closer to each other, finding each other across the room without needing a Word to know that you are enough.

I want us both to be honest, blund maybe, i want to know you, see you, for that i also want you to know me and see me. I want US to carry each other through sunshine and heavy storms.

Who am I ?

This happened to me recently. A girl I met in class kept trying to make conversation, but I just wasn't vibing with her at all. Whenever we talked, it was just painfully awkward smalltalk (or that's how I saw it). So I never initiated anything, it was always her trying to talk to me. The next semester, she DM'd me, asking if I wanted to get a cup of coffee. And I ghosted her, because I really didn't want to go, but it felt weird to write out why and I feared that telling her the truth would hurt more than ghosting. I think it would hurt me more.

Today, I realized she might have been trying to ask me out. I'm biromantic myself, but I've never been with a girl, so I might be kind of oblivious to these things. But maybe I'm overthinking it and she just wanted to be my friend.

Either way, I don't really feel bad about it, it's not like I ghosted a friend or someone I was messaging/dating. But whenever we bump into one another, it makes things really awkward. I'm curious about other people's opinions. Has something like this ever happened to you? And AITA for ghosting this girl?

1kihdcm,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kihdcm/explore_nespresso_vertuoplus_coffee_maker_by/,Explore Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee Maker by Breville Review Is It Worth It?,"Testing out the Nespresso BNV420BLK1BUC1 VertuoPlus Deluxe Coffee and Espresso Maker has been a delightful experience for a caffeine enthusiast like me. As someone who starts their day with a strong espresso and occasionally enjoys a chilled iced coffee on a lazy weekend, I was eager to dive into all the features of this product. It‚Äôs a single-serve coffee machine that claims precision brewing while offering versatility with various cup sizes. Trust me, using this machine on a daily basis made me realize just how nitty-gritty I‚Äôve become about my coffee rituals.

**Design That Impresses and Fits Anywhere**  
The machine‚Äôs sleek black exterior immediately caught my eye. It doesn‚Äôt just look modern but feels thoughtfully designed. At 6""D x 17""W x 13""H, it doesn't occupy much counter space, making it ideal for smaller kitchens or apartments. The adjustable water reservoir was a game-changer for me. I could configure it to fit the layout of my kitchen like a custom feature, and its 60 oz capacity meant fewer trips to the sink. The pod container for used capsules is also surprisingly spacious, holding up to 17 pods. Even though it weighs a little over 10 pounds, it feels sturdy enough to last but isn‚Äôt a nightmare to move when cleaning the counter beneath it.

**Convenience and Fully Automated Operation**  
One of the reasons I‚Äôve been hooked on this machine is its simplicity. The fully automatic operation means I don‚Äôt have to fuss over measurements or brewing settings. The Centrifusion‚Ñ¢ technology uses a barcode system to tailor the brewing parameters for each capsule. I found this particularly fascinating, as every cup came out with consistent flavor and no room for human error. During rushed mornings, the 15‚Äì20 second heat-up time was a lifesaver! Who doesn‚Äôt love a quick caffeine fix without waiting forever?

[View Nespresso BNV420BLK1BUC1 sale info on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b01n5s8tv1/)

**Brewing Versatility: Options Galore**  
This coffee and espresso maker doesn‚Äôt box you into one option. I experimented with different cup sizes ‚Äì a quick espresso shot at 1.35 oz, a smoother double espresso at 2.7 oz, and even a larger coffee at 7.7 oz. For the in-between days, the 5 oz Gran Lungo was perfect. You can even use the machine to brew coffee over ice for iced coffee, which became my absolute summer favorite. I dare say, this versatility caters to everyone, from strong espresso lovers to those who prefer mellow cups of coffee.

**Advantages**  
There are several aspects of this coffee maker that I absolutely loved, including:  
- Effortless brewing with programmable settings using Centrifusion‚Ñ¢ technology.  
- Generous 60 oz water tank and 17-pod capacity for less frequent refills.  
- Energy-saving automatic shutoff after 9 minutes for eco-friendliness.  
- Compatibility with a range of Nespresso Vertuo capsules, offering diverse flavor profiles.  

**Potential Shortcomings**  
Of course, nothing‚Äôs perfect, and there were a couple of details that bugged me slightly:  
- Exclusive use of Vertuo pods limits experimenting with other pod brands.  
- While consistent, the coffee temperature could have been slightly hotter.  
- The machine is quiet but not completely silent; the brewing process creates some audible noise.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this Nespresso coffee maker to others in its class highlights where it shines and where it could improve. The Keurig K-Cafe, for instance, allows users to brew both regular coffee and specialty beverages like cappuccinos and lattes with its milk frother. However, it lacks the barcode technology that ensures consistent brewing. On the flip side, the De'Longhi Dedica Style offers a more manual espresso experience with a steam wand, satisfying users who enjoy hands-on brewing, though it sacrifices the VertuoPlus‚Äôs automation ease. The Nespresso machine certainly wins in convenience and versatility, but manual machines like De'Longhi might suit those seeking richer customization.

**Money‚Äôs Worth**  
Looking at what this product offers for the price, it stands out for anyone who insists on consistent quality and convenience. The reusable filter, adjustable settings, and robust design make it a worthwhile investment. Other machines might be cheaper upfront, but they often lack the meticulous brewing consistency or accompanying capsule range. For someone who values fuss-free coffee with a variety of brewing options, this coffee maker offers much in return for its cost.

Starting Weight: 256lbs   
Current Weight: 226lbs   
Goal Weight: 155 - 170lbs 

Since January 1st, I've been working hard on losing weight.  I've adjusted my caloric intake to 1850 calories a day and go to the gym 4 days a week for about an hour and 20 minutes doing a mix of Cardio, Calisthenics, and weight lifting. I generally get 7-8 hours of sleep a night as well.  Since following this plan, I've been dropping weight at a decent speed...until about mid April where everything seems to have come to a grinding halt. 

No matter what I seem to do (lower calories or  increase training intensity) my body just refuses to go any lower.  I've lowered my Caloric intake from 1850 to 1800, I've increased my steps on days that I don't go to the gym, I've increased the cardio intensity and weights as I do weight lifting (I'm in the 170-205 range for a lot of the machines, and about 30lbs for dumbbells). I'm pretty much only drinking water or black coffee as well, and have increased my protein and fiber intake as well. However, for the past 4 weeks, I have just stayed at a solid 226 with almost 0 fluctuation on the scale... what am I doing wrong?!

My clothes are getting looser in how they fit, and I'm having to tighten my belt further almost every week now, but I don't understand why I'm stuck at this weight...

any advice would be appreciated.

We actually had a nice conversation about miscellaneous stuff that continued even after our drinks were served. I went to ask her if she wanted to hang out later and do something. It was then I learned that she is, in fact, a middle-aged lesbian with a gf and that she thought that would be awkward. I apologized for hitting on her and she said that it‚Äôs fine and no big deal.

1kih96d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kih96d,Remember our little Tugboat üíô,"Hello everyone. My name is Jeremy and I would like to introduce you all and the world to my son, Jordan Khalik, or as my wife and I called him while he was in her womb, Tugboat. Tuggy was given to us and taken away at 6:30a on May 6. My wife was 33 weeks pregnant. Our son was growing so well. Last measuring in the 88th percentile. My wife and I always joked that he was going to rip her a new one. That he was ""going to kill her on the way out"" she always said jokingly. Little did we know how true that almost was. It all started that morning around 3:30a for me anyway. My wife was up since 2:30a. She originally woke up to having to pee. She thought she waited too long and her bladder felt sore from holding it too long. The feeling of pee turned to feeling like a bowel movement so she gave that a try as well. Eventually lying in bed, her cramping became really uncomfortable and her pelvis and lower back was beginning to hurt. She informed me that this was the moment she decided to wake me up. We just had our daughter 9 months earlier who was born preemie at 34 weeks so we thought this was going to be another case. So when she woke me up at 3:00a, neither one of us moved with the sense of urgency that the situation actually needed. I asked her if it was ok for me to make coffee as I got our daughter up and dressed. Through gritted teeth she said yes, and within 30 minutes we were on the road to the hospital a few miles away.
   Upon hitting the OBED, everything went downhill. On the elevator up, my wife told myself and the nurse that she felt like her water broke. Upon entering the rest room in her room, she mentioned feeling that same sensation again but as she said, streams of blood started running down her legs. My wife and I are both medical, her an OR Nurse and myself a OR Scrub Tech. So we knew what was happening. My wife began to cry while sitting on the toilet, while I comfort her with words while I rocked our sleeping baby. The nurse trying to get her bloody clothes off the floor. But there was a problem. The blood wouldn't stop coming. The nurse helped my wife to the bed and instantly my wife began to pale and shiver. She told me of having the sense of impending doom. Her blood pressure spiked then plummeted. The nurse called out for help. The hospitalist showed up with an ultrasound and began to sound. She rested upon his heart and there was no movement. My wife ""just be straight with me, is it fetal demise?"" The doctored nodded and said ""it seems so"". My wife began to crash again. She yelled out that she felt very cold and drowsy. She asked ""when are yall going to call for a rapid response?! I don't want to die!"" The room filled with activity as the rushed her up into a delivery room. But she lost too much blood. Her pressure were too low and it took so many attempts to get IVs and fluids started. Our OBGYN ordered blood to be given. As soon as the first unit was in she was pulled away for an emergency c-section. Her placenta had torn away from her uterus. Over 50% was detached. The uterus was filled with blood and clots. There wasn't anything anyone could have done to prevent this and by the time she began to feel discomfort, our little Tugboat have left port and was sailing into the sunset. Our son as still as he was beautiful. We both lost a piece before it even had a chance to fit in the puzzle of our life. I almost lost 2.
   We are just asking Reddit for a little bit of the care and compassion I have seen over so many posts. I know you guys are absolutely amazing and I hope, rather I know that life comes through and we will get through this. I'm sure there are situations up here that are worse than ours. But this is our story and I just want the world to know that my little boy was here, that he lived, that he is loved, and that he will be remembered. We love you little Jordan ""Tugboat"" Jones.

When I remove the hopper, I always find partially ground beans within the grinder itself - it seems like these aren't falling through to the portafilter, and getting stuck at the grinder.

1kih74v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Celiac/comments/1kih74v/stomach_gurgling_questions_and_celiac/,Stomach gurgling questions and celiac?,"if you mixed HCI and bread, how much bubbling of any kind would be produced?

That's an interesting thought experiment! If you mixed hydrochloric acid (HCI) and bread, you would definitely see some bubbling. Here's why:

Bread contains carbohydrates, primarily starch, and often includes baking soda or baking powder as a leavening agent.^(1)

* **Reaction with Baking Soda/Powder:** If the bread contains baking soda (sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO3‚Äã) or baking powder (which contains sodium bicarbonate and an acidic component), the hydrochloric acid would react with the bicarbonate.^(2) This reaction produces carbon dioxide gas (CO2‚Äã), which would manifest as bubbling. The chemical equation for the reaction with sodium bicarbonate is:

HCl(aq)+NaHCO3‚Äã(s)‚ü∂NaCl(aq)+H2‚ÄãO(l)+CO2‚Äã(g)^(3)

* **Breakdown of Carbohydrates:** Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid and can start to break down the complex carbohydrates (starch) in the bread through hydrolysis.^(4) While this process doesn't directly produce a large amount of gas quickly, it could contribute to some minor bubbling or fizzing over time as other breakdown products might form.

**How much bubbling?**

The amount of bubbling would depend on several factors:

* **The amount of baking soda/powder in the bread:** Bread recipes vary, so the more leavening agent present, the more carbon dioxide gas would be produced.
* **The concentration of the hydrochloric acid:** A more concentrated acid would react more vigorously.^(5)
* **The amount of bread used:** More bread means more potential reactants.
* **The surface area of the bread:** If the bread is finely divided, the reaction would occur more quickly, leading to more rapid bubbling.

**In summary, you would definitely observe bubbling due to the reaction between the hydrochloric acid and any bicarbonate present in the bread. You might also see some slower, less dramatic bubbling as the acid starts to break down the carbohydrates.**

It's important to remember that mixing strong acids with organic materials can produce heat and potentially other hazardous byproducts, so this is not something to try without proper safety precautions and understanding of the chemical reactions involved.

(i think basically the ""loud stomach gurgles after eating, or specifically after eating bread"" debate actually might just be a misunderstanding and worry about the noise and feel the stomach should be making just from mixing HCI with anything- some bubbling is produced- a long time later it comes out in a fart along with methane produced later- anyway i wonder about this as one of the celiac symptoms or not? understand that the intestine is going to function like a musical instrument in a certain regard- it's a tight skin that your passing these pressurized bubbles through- as it happens, it makes loud sounds because it's similar to a drum or something basically. it's like a strange musical instrument youve made. my stomach gurgles a lot, loudly, for oh 10-30 minutes after eating sourdough toast with butter and coffee/cream/sugar, but, i attribute it entirely to this above; i dont think i have an indigestion problem for example? just thought id post this somewhere to add to the debate. obviously for any kind of food you could ask what should happen when you mix that with HCI; if it produces any bubbling your intestine should probably gurgle for a little while until the reaction from the HCI has mostly completed.)?",0,1746793528.0,Celiac,1,0.5,False

1kih6oc,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Fragrant-Garbage1147/comments/1kih6oc/the_benefits_of_coffee/,The Benefits of Coffee,"

Coffee is more than just a morning ritual‚Äîit‚Äôs a global phenomenon and a beloved beverage that fuels productivity, sparks conversation, and delivers a host of health perks. Whether it‚Äôs a piping hot cup brewed at sunrise or a cold brew sipped in the afternoon, coffee continues to captivate hearts and minds across cultures. But beyond its bold flavor and energizing jolt, the benefits of coffee go much deeper than many realize. With its complex blend of antioxidants, nutrients, and natural caffeine, coffee has earned its place not only as a pick-me-up, but also as a wellness ally.

One of the most well-known benefits of coffee is its ability to enhance alertness and mental performance. The caffeine in coffee is a natural stimulant that blocks adenosine, a neurotransmitter that causes drowsiness. As a result, coffee helps improve focus, concentration, and cognitive function. For many people, a single cup is enough to boost productivity and mental clarity, especially during the early hours of the day or during long work sessions. Students, professionals, and creatives alike turn to coffee to help them stay sharp and mentally engaged.

But coffee‚Äôs benefits go far beyond the brain. One of the lesser-known facts is that coffee is a major source of antioxidants in the average diet. These antioxidants help fight inflammation and neutralize free radicals‚Äîunstable molecules that can contribute to aging and disease. In fact, some studies suggest that coffee contains more antioxidants than certain fruits and vegetables. These compounds include chlorogenic acid and polyphenols, both of which have been linked to reduced oxidative stress and a lower risk of chronic diseases.

Heart health is another area where the benefits of coffee come into play. Moderate coffee consumption has been associated with a lower risk of stroke and heart failure. Some research suggests that the anti-inflammatory properties of coffee‚Äôs antioxidants, combined with its potential to improve endothelial function (the health of blood vessels), may contribute to these positive effects. However, balance is key‚Äîexcessive caffeine can raise blood pressure in some individuals, so it‚Äôs important to consume coffee mindfully.

For those looking to support their metabolism, coffee can be a helpful tool. Caffeine is known to increase metabolic rate and promote fat burning by stimulating the central nervous system. It may also improve physical performance by increasing adrenaline levels, making coffee a popular pre-workout drink for athletes and fitness enthusiasts. These metabolic benefits of coffee may contribute to improved endurance, better energy use, and support for weight management goals when paired with healthy eating and exercise habits.

Another surprising benefit of coffee is its potential role in reducing the risk of certain neurological disorders. Some studies have found that regular coffee drinkers have a lower risk of developing conditions such as Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and Parkinson‚Äôs disease. The exact mechanisms are still being researched, but it‚Äôs believed that caffeine and the antioxidants in coffee help protect brain cells from damage. This neuroprotective effect positions coffee as more than just a mental booster‚Äîit may also be a long-term supporter of brain health.

The liver, one of the body‚Äôs most vital organs, also benefits from regular coffee consumption. Research has shown that coffee drinkers have a lower risk of liver diseases, including liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and even liver cancer. It may help reduce harmful liver enzymes and limit the buildup of fat in the liver, especially in those who consume alcohol or are at risk of fatty liver disease. These protective benefits of coffee make it an important addition to the diets of those focused on organ health.

Coffee may even contribute to longer life expectancy. Some large-scale observational studies have found a correlation between coffee consumption and reduced risk of premature death from various causes. While correlation does not equal causation, the consistent pattern across different populations suggests that the overall health benefits of coffee‚Äîespecially when consumed without excessive sugar or additives‚Äîcan support long-term wellness.

Mood enhancement is another benefit of coffee that many people experience. The caffeine can trigger the release of neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin, which play key roles in mood regulation. This may help explain why coffee drinkers often report feeling happier or more motivated after a cup. Some studies have even suggested that coffee drinkers have a lower risk of depression, though more research is needed to fully understand the connection.

For individuals with type 2 diabetes or those at risk, coffee might offer protective effects. Some research indicates that regular coffee consumption is linked to improved insulin sensitivity and a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds in coffee may help regulate blood sugar levels and support metabolic health over time. While black coffee is generally best in this case, even those who prefer light milk or plant-based creamers can still enjoy many of the benefits of coffee.

In the world of digestion, coffee plays a stimulating role as well. It can promote regular bowel movements by stimulating the muscles in the digestive tract. Many people find that their morning cup helps kickstart their digestive system and establish routine gut health. However, individuals with sensitive stomachs may need to monitor their intake, as excessive coffee can sometimes lead to acid reflux or stomach irritation.

The benefits of coffee are not limited to internal health. Coffee grounds have become popular in DIY skincare treatments due to their exfoliating properties. They can help slough off dead skin cells and promote a brighter complexion. Some people use coffee scrubs to reduce the appearance of cellulite, thanks to the caffeine‚Äôs ability to temporarily tighten the skin and improve circulation. Though the effects are usually short-term, these cosmetic benefits of coffee add to its overall versatility.

Even the aroma of coffee has been found to offer benefits. The scent alone can reduce stress and increase feelings of comfort. Aromatherapy researchers have found that simply smelling freshly brewed coffee can have calming and alertness-boosting effects. This may be one of the reasons coffee shops often feel so inviting and why the morning coffee routine is such a treasured part of many people‚Äôs days.

In conclusion, the benefits of coffee are broad and far-reaching, touching on nearly every area of health and well-being. From cognitive function and physical performance to liver health and mood support, coffee offers much more than just a wake-up call. Its powerful blend of antioxidants, natural stimulants, and essential nutrients make it a true super-beverage when consumed in moderation. Whether you're sipping it for focus, fitness, or flavor, coffee continues to prove that it's more than just a drink‚Äîit's a lifestyle enhancer.

Chapter 1 Betrayal on the Night of the Proposal

Inside the private room at the hotel, beneath the glittering glow of a towering ten-tier champagne pyramid, Benson Gray stood with his newly hired assistant, Sophie Scott.

The two of them were cutting a birthday cake together, their fingers interlocked.

When Sierra Shaw entered the room, Benson didn't flinch or even look guilty. Instead, he spoke as casually as if they were discussing the weather.

""Sophie has the same birthday as you. She's here all alone, far from home, with no friends. So, I decided to move your birthday party to hers for now. I'll make it up to you in a couple of days.""

Sierra's smile faltered, freezing in place as her grip on her purse slowly tightened.

Today was her 25th birthday. Benson had promised he would propose to her on this special day.

She'd worn the elegant white dress he had gifted her, spent hours perfecting her hair and makeup, and arrived at the hotel excitedly.

But the sight before her felt like a bucket of ice-cold water cascading over her head.

The engagement ring she had dreamed of‚Äîthe three-carat pink diamond she had spent years imagining on her finger‚Äîwas now sparkling brightly on Sophie's hand as Benson held her hand.

A sting of pain blurred her vision. Still, she forced her feet to move. Approaching Benson, she took a deep breath and pointed directly at Sophie's hand. ""What about that ring?""

Benson shrugged with infuriating nonchalance. ""It all happened so suddenly, I didn't have time to prepare a gift. Sophie liked it, so I gave it to her.""

But that was her ring, the one she had spent three years choosing meticulously, imagining every detail.

She could almost hear the sound of her heart shattering. Her eyes reddened as her voice broke. ""And me, Benson? What about me? What do you take me for?""

Benson clicked his tongue in annoyance. ""Why are you acting so childish? Haven't I celebrated enough of your birthdays over the years? Can't you let Sophie have this one for once?""

Let it go? Why was it always her who had to back down? Benson had sabotaged the deal she was about to close to boost Sophie's standing in the company. He had stood idly by as Sophie spilled coffee on her, dismissing it as Sierra being overly dramatic.

And every time Sophie made mistakes, it was Sierra Benson that was expected to clean up the mess, hiding behind the excuse of, ""those who are capable should do more"".

All these years, what exactly had Benson taken her for? Did everyone else always matter more than she did?

Tears blurred Sierra's vision. She clenched her fists, desperate to preserve the last shred of dignity she had left. Without another word, she turned and hurried toward the restroom.

Behind her, a murmur of disapproval rippled through the small crowd of friends.

""Benson, you've gone too far this time.""

""You know how much Sierra cares about this proposal, but you brought Sophie here just to get under her skin?""

Benson, utterly unbothered, continued slicing the cake. He placed one piece on a plate and handed it to Sophie.

Sophie's eyes flickered with triumph, though she quickly masked it with a nervous, apologetic expression.

""Mr. Gray, it's my fault. I shouldn't have come and upset Ms. Shaw. I'll apologize to her later, okay?""

Benson gave Sophie's shoulder a reassuring pat, his voice calm and condescending. ""It's not your fault. She's just being overly sensitive. I've been meaning to break her of this habit of throwing tantrums for no reason.""

""Benson, aren't you worried Sierra might get mad and refuse your proposal?""

Benson exhaled a ring of smoke, a mocking laugh escaping his lips as though he'd just heard the most ridiculous joke in the world.

""She's been dying to marry me since she was a kid, desperate to slap the name Mrs. Gray on herself. How could she possibly say no? If she wasn't obedient enough, she wouldn't even have the right to stay by my side.""

The crowd around him erupted into cheers and laughter.

""That's our Benson! Even the campus queen of Oceanea University couldn't resist his charm!""

""Benson, teach us your ways when you've got time!""

""Pfft! Step one, find yourself a woman who's head over heels for you!""

Everyone in Vellmont City knew Sierra was practically Benson's shadow. The two of them were three years apart, childhood sweethearts. Sierra had followed Benson to Oceanea City for college, giving up her plans to stay by his side.

To support him during the early days of his business, Sierra abandoned her dream of studying piano.

She took on the role of his assistant, pulling all-nighters for a month straight just to help him close a single deal. She drank so much at business dinners that she developed stomach ulcers.

Their mutual friends often said Sierra loved Benson so much that she'd lost herself completely.

But Benson? He was so convinced Sierra would never leave him that he treated her cruelly without a second thought.

In the restroom, Sierra stood frozen, her hands covering her ears. She stared at her reflection in the mirror‚Äîa woman with red-rimmed eyes and pale skin.

Slowly, she forced her lips into a smile, one that looked more painful than tears.

""Sierra, it's been ten years. Can you stop being so pathetic already?""

Chapter 2 Breaking Up

Sierra wiped away her tears, retouched her makeup, and pushed open the restroom door. When she stepped out, the first thing she saw was Benson and Sophie, arms linked, clinking glasses in a toast.

""Ha ha. Benson, if you're gonna put on a show, go all the way! Why not head to the honeymoon suite after this?""

""Man, Benson's got it all‚Äîa classy, elegant wife and a cute, flirty little assistant!""

Sierra's heart twisted painfully as her gaze fell on their intertwined arms. This was the man she had loved for ten years‚Ä¶

Someone caught sight of Sierra returning and nudged Benson, their voice dropping to a whisper. ""Benson, that's enough. Sierra's back.""

""Sierra, they're just joking around and trying to lighten the mood. Don't‚Äî""

But Benson didn't even let them finish before cutting in sharply. ""I'm not putting up with her tantrums!""

Then he turned to face Sierra fully, raising an eyebrow as though daring her to react. ""If you don't like what you're seeing, then leave. Stop standing there ruining my mood.""

Sierra forced herself to breathe past the stinging ache building in her nose, her eyes locking onto Benson's. ""Benson, we're breaking up.""

Her words hung in the air, slicing through the room like a blade. The chatter ceased instantly.

Did they hear her right? Sierra had just broken up with Benson?

Benson froze. Then, with an incredulous laugh, he flicked away his cigarette butt. ""You're serious? Don't come crying to me later when you change your mind and want me back.""

""Sierra, I'm so sorry. Mr. Gray was only keeping me company for my birthday because I didn't have any friends. Please don't let this affect your relationship with him.",1,1746793087.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False
