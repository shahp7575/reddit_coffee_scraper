Extreme chest discomfort, GI clear, Cardio clear, suicidal.

Basically this whole issue started in May 2025. I was having a coffee at work and started to get chest pains and tachycardia (pretty normal). I went home, tried to lie down and the chest pains worsened. Went to hospital and they were like yeah you're fine just brush is off.  

Fast forward a couple months, the chest pain was constantly there and especially bad when I lie down and try to sleep. This is my primary issue. 

I also started to get light headed and felt like I was gonna pass out grocery shopping multiple times. 

I had a few random weeks where I felt it completely dissipated.

The other issue I had was when eating (particularly a large meal) my chest discomfort would flare up & it would be hard focus. 

Sometimes I would randomly feel hot and get sweats from the stress. 

Weird symptom but I get impatient and irritable at traffic lights.

Then the culmination was that in December the chest discomfort got REALLY bad, I could focus & this was really demoralising because I had a gastro and colonoscopy that was clear. Barium swallow that was clear.  

I felt like I constantly had to keep moving otherwise I'm in constant discomfort. 

And now I've had to come off work for 2 weeks cancel Christmas plans, barely had an appetite, ive lost 8kg. 

The only thing that helps ease my symptoms is alcohol & I know that's not healthy. 

My primary suspicion is that it's a mild form of Akathisia from taking 25mg of quetiapine for about 5 years. Which I bumped up to 50mg in November (could explain why symptoms got worse. 

My GI specialist basically wrote me off saying it's something functional there's nothing wrong, which sent me over the edge.  

I definitely think there's some sort of ANS dysfunction, like im stuck in fight or flight mode. 

I have been suicidal over this for a little while now, as doctors have not been any help & I just need another opinion. 

I am off the quetiapine for about 2 weeks now.

Maybe no-one will see this post, but whatever, I just wanted to share it and maybe receive some advice or something.

Last year I (F16) have met a guy (M17) on one app where you find friends, seriously, cuz I'm not old enough to have a dating app, I just wanted friends.
So like he messaged me and he was all sweet then we found out we live really close to eachother so we started dating that day (yes, really sudden I know, he asked and I thought he was joking so I said yes, he wasn't joking ANYWAY) we went out and it was honestly so fine, like we chatted the whole time, it was a bit awkward from time to time since we're both a bit awkward.
Fast forward to like one week later, I broke up with him because he was texting me nonstop and it was overwhelming (I was dumb and didn't told him that I was just overwhelmed, because I didn't want to hurt his feelings)
I was his first girl so he was really really sad about us breaking up.
We stopped talking for like half a year and then he wished me happy birthday (he was a week early, on accident) since that day we started chatting again, like many times a day.
Now? Three months later since we started chatting. He's gone dry, he isn't texting me anymore, he was really sweet and kind when we started talking.
I asked him two times what we are, or if we ever get back together, when I first asked it was the start so he said yes, that we'll be together and we talked it out on a call.
Last time I asked him he told me that he doesn't know if he's even good enough for me since I left him last year.
I know I fucked up, he's really sweet and all, but I have avoidant issues. I'm trying to get better for him, but I don't know if it's even worth trying since he's so dry.
He's been really sweet when we started talking. I told him one time about liking coffee flavoured candy and the next week when we were calling or something he told me that he's trying to find them somewhere, which made me really happy, like it was so sweet of him.
He's fine with not talking to me, I asked if I should keep trying, if I'll ever get him back, but he didn't give me a straight answer.

We went out like a month ago like three times, we kissed and the hangout was awesome, we both had a really good time and now he's acting like this.
I know that he's scared to get hurt again, but he might be acting like that because it's winter and he has hard time being alive ykwim.

I don't know what to do.
I know that I've fucked up.
I know I don't deserve him and he should find someone better.
I apologised to him many times, he told me that it's alright, that we're more mature now and that we'll sort it out together.
I know that I can move on easily, because of my avoidance, but I can't, since I have still a bit of hope that maybe he'll come back to me someday.

PS: I'm now 17 and he's 18. I didn't know in what way I should've put our ages in here...
I don't know how this app works.
Truly hope he won't see this post, like if he does I'll be so embarrassed, because I doubt he wouldn't recognise me. ",2,1766978943.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False

I was still doing 12in12 in my own time because it was just a great way for me to get to games that I actually want to play in my backlog. So here was my list for 2025 along with my current feeling and rating of each game. The list is ordered chronically based on when I played them from earliest to latest.

**The Rise of the Golden Idol** \- 2024 - PC - Puzzle

* Love the first game, The Case of the Golden Idol. The sequel is more of that but in a different time period (1970s) and theme. I think the 70s time period is more interesting and the characters are more memorable. And it really helps that each case does not have to revolve around a death. 
* 5/5 stars

**UFO 50** \- 2024 - PC - Misc

* I love the idea of creating 50 games to make up the history of a non-existence console. Playing this game feels like finding a box of games at a yard sale and slowly trying a taste of them before committing to a game. I did not finish but I so want to finish all 50 games. Party House is my favorite.
* 5/5 stars 

**The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom** \- 2024 - Switch - Adventure

* I tried this game for a few hours but I didn’t get hooked. And that is disappointing because I love the idea of Zelda as the protagonist and solving problems using her wisdom. Maybe I will try again later; maybe I wasn’t in the mood. 
* Unfinished

**Yellow Taxi Goes Vroom** \- 2024 - PC - Platformer

* I love Nintendo 64 collectathon platformers which this game takes a lot of inspiration from. The game nails the retro graphic and goofy humor. But it also has its own oft-kilter vibe that I like. Most importantly, the movement is amazing. All good platformers such as Nintendo games, A Hat in Time, Demon Turf, etc have amazing traversal ability.
* 5/5 stars

**Ghost of Tsushima** \- PS5 - 2020 - Action

* Someone described this to me as Assassin’s Creed in Japan (was told this before Ubisoft actually made Assassin’s Creed Shadows) and yeah, that description fits. I love running across the world and doing a bunch of goals and moments. Tsushima is such a cinematic-looking landscape. Both combat and stealth feels good. Between the two, I am a fan of silently taking enemies out from the shadows. The story about using dishonorable guerilla tactics before ninjutsu became a thing and that is an interesting time period and dilemma.
* 5/5 stars

**Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales** \- PS5 - 2020 - Action

* I love the first Marvel’s Spider-Man; it is just fun to swing around and combat feels good. This is just more of that. Even the story feels like a retread of that which is disappointing to me that they didn’t make it more narratively unique. I do like the characters such as Miles, sidekick Ganke, and the main villain, The Tinkerer.
* 4/5 stars 

**Marvel's Midnight Suns** \- PC - 2022 - Strategy

* I tried for an hour and I just wasn’t able to commit to this game. I love superheroes and I love strategy games. However, strategy games required a huge commitment to learn and to figure out to excel at the mechanic. I was just pulled into the other games and thus, sending this game back into my backlog.
* Unfinished

**Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door** \- 2024 - Switch - RPG

* I love the original even though I didn’t beat it so the remake was like a second chance to fulfill my goal. I enjoy it even though I did not become obsessed like I did with the original. I really love the companions and the world. It makes me wish there was more content about them. 
* 4/5 stars

**Pikmin 4** \- 2023 - Switch - Strategy

* Love Oatchi, good dog. He is a cute companion and so useful for strategizing and fighting. Also been a big Pikmin fan, just love exploring the world as this tiny explorer gathering treasure. Pikmin 4 helped me narrow in on the strategy aspect of Pikmin, which the game named Dandori. It does feel good to develop a plan for time management and to execute it successfully.
* 5/5 stars

**Hi-Fi Rush** \- PC - 2023 - Action

* I remember the first time that I saw a video of this game and was amazed at how much the graphic looks like a saturday morning cartoon. Finally got around to playing it and I was happy it played as good as it looks. It feels so good to play and it feels like I’m playing to the rhythm even though my in-game ratings say otherwise.
* 4/5 stars

**Shadows Over Loathing** \- Switch - 2022 - RPG

* Big fan of West of Loathing. I think West is a better experience (I think I prefer the wild west setting over the 20s prohibition setting) but Shadows still holds its own with its writing. The game is funny and the side quests are so memorable. I just want to continue exploring the world and finding quests.
* 5/5 stars

**God of War** \- PS5 - 2018 - Action

* A friend recommended this to me but I just could not find the time for it. I just didn’t prioritize it over the other action games on this list 
* Untouched



I also want to do a quick review of my gaming life in 2025. Here are my top 10 games that I played in 2025. About the labels, “12in12” are games from my 12in12 list. “Not backlog” are games that I played once I acquired them. “Backlog” are games that I didn’t touch for a long period after getting them. 

|Rank|Title||
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|UFO 50|12in12|
|2|Blue Prince|Not Backlog|
|3|Donkey Kong Bananza|Not Backlog|
|4|Pikmin 4|12in12|
|5|Ghost of Tsushima|12in12|
|6|Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown|Not Backlog|
|7|Night in the Woods |Backlog|
|8|Civilization VII|Not Backlog|
|9|Yellow Taxi Goes Vroom|12in12|
|10|Coffee Talk|Backlog|

Total games played: 57

This shows how 12in12 is important to me because it gets me to play games that I know I will greatly enjoy but I keep putting off for whatever reasons. ",1,1766978914.0,12in12,0,1.0,False

Asgtia, Republic of Antares

2:30 AM Asgtia Mean Time

CDR Ashkanai Oras'nai, ARS Arethasak (F103), Convoy OA-348\*

""CAPTAIN!"" Arethasak calls out from the radar room, her systems relaying data to both the main bridge, combat information center, and the rest of the convoy's escorts - four Halsey-class and two Huron-class destroyer leaders of the UN Navy, in addition to multiple frigates. ""S-BOATS, ASTERN! 500 KILOMETERS OUT! INCOMING TORPEDOES!""

Stealth Boats, or S-boats. Small T'Chak ships equipped with rudimentary stealth fields masking subspace signatures, much like the submarines of the past. All equipped with shielded torpedoes that most CIWS falter in the face of. 

""Fifteen-torpedo spread, incoming!"" a transmission broadcasts across the bridge. it's Captain Ingham alongside Gato - one of the frigates picketing at the rear of the convoy with her gravitic sensors reports. ""Performing evasive manuevers!""

Just like the submarines from hundreds of years ago - when the final frontier was but a dream. Silent hunter-killers, almost impossible to detect via subspace radar - their subspace wakes are muffled completely - should they not fire and move slowly. 

A nightmare for any un-escorted merchant convoy, and potentially a major nuisance for even the most heavily armed destroyer - a single T9c torpedo hit can end a destroyer's naval career in an instant.

""Gravitic sensors are detecting two cloaked S-boats.""

Unfortunately, one ship - SAF Gratia, carrying coffee to Antares, is torpedoed, causing a massive explosion that tears the ship apart in an instant.

""Attacks incoming from astern! Make sure they have nowhere to hide!"" one of the human destroyer leaders - Haida, broadcasts across the convoy, causing all the human destroyers to open fire, their railguns firing shells augmented with gravitic sensors into the convoy's rear, before sailing towards the S-boat ""wolfpack"".

""ARN ships, stay close to the convoy. We'll handle the rest."" Haida's commander orders. ""Just in case they decloak in the middle of the convoy.""

While they may be threatening...

""S-boat damaged by auxiliary-caliber gunfire, continuing pursuit!"" Gleaves - one of the UN destroyers escorting, reports to the rest of the convoy.

""S-boat destroyed by main-caliber gunfire!"" Huron - the second destroyer leader, reports in. 

...they are not invincible.

And in the end...

When anyone hunts humans, they will almost always become the hunted.

And humans, being natural persistence predators, are not very keen on stopping.

We were having issues but I thought it was stuff we would get through, and he continued talking about the future like getting married and booking another Europe trip together. We had just adopted a kitten 5 months before.

I’m very conflicted. He was numb when he after he broke up, he told me he’d always love me but he was very cold about everything. I did make mistakes id gone off an SSRI that made me very irritable and stressed. I snapped at him twice and acted very immaturely. I apologized and told him I needed to go back on meds but he urged me to try and be okay without them.

I was always very honest about where I wanted him to pick up in household chores but he told me it felt like I was criticizing everything he did. He was at work like 60 hours a week by choice because he had 2 jobs he liked. I just wanted to feel more connected and spend more time with him which I think is why I always asked him to do more. And I always was planning activities and he seemed to enjoy it too but now he seems to resent me for it.

About 10 days after one of our argument he invited his parents over for dinner. We had a great evening and played games and then after they left he told me he’d was unsure of us. I was in so much shock. I went to stay with my mom for the weekend because I was so distraught and wanted to give him space. 48 hours later texting me he wished he felt different but he wasn’t sad that I was gone and he felt relieved about his decision. This broke me.

I moved my stuff out two weeks later. I asked if I could stay and we could talk and he said “it wasn’t a good idea”. He also said it felt like I was just on vacation since my stuff was still there. He claims he never made me leave but he made me feel so unwelcome so how could I stay there.

I started having very dark thoughts and it was scary. It felt like my life was over. I opened up to a friend and found a therapist so I’m okay now. I also in a vulnerable state I dumped on my ex how terrible I was doing and I regret this so much. I made sure he knew I was okay and went no contact again.

Two weeks later he messages me profusely apologizing of how sudden the breakup was and how he acted numb. He admitted he actually still does feel things for me and he was emotionally overwhelmed before and shouldn’t have trusted that. He said he’d be open to going to therapy and seeing a couples counsellor later on. He asked to meet for coffee whenever I feel ready.

I’m so conflicted. I loved him so much and begged him after the breakup to see a couples counsellor with me and he denied. But I wanted him to say these things for weeks and he didn’t and just pushed me away. And I was so traumatized by the breakup and got so depressed I was scared. I can’t forget what a dark place I was in and I know he didn’t necessarily cause this but it still happened. I’m worried if I don’t meet him for coffee now and talk about things then I’ll never be ready and I’ll wait too long. But I’m worried that seeing him now would send me into a spiral. It’s been 2 months since the breakup but I’m still traumatized with how low my mental health got.

my problem is that when brewing a shot the pressure gauge will not go past the pre infusion mark, and the shots taste terrible. i have tried so many different grind sizes and doses and this does not change. i have tested on both the dual wall and single wall baskets with the same results. i have also noticed that when a shot choked, the pressure still stayed within that range which i think is an important detail. you’d think that choking it would raise it to max pressure. but when i tried back flushing with the rubber disk the pressure actually raised to max which is confusing. 

i am using a kingrinder k2 so i know the grinder is not a problem. i have already replaced the worn gasket and have cleaned the group head and descaled. i am currently waiting on a scale to be delivered, and this seems to be the last factor that could make this user error since i was dosing by eye before (approximately a few mm below the basket rim after tamping). but i thought that the dual wall should be a lot more forgiving with grind size and dosing issues, but again i was still getting the same results with that. i have just done so many test runs (one and a half bags of coffee to be exact) that you’d think id get it right at least once.

Context: Maglalabas lang ako ng thoughts at nararamdaman ko kase wala akong masabihan..
Magkwento lang ako sa inyo. Okay lang ba?

So Im F,28 in a relationship with M, 30 for about 7 years na. 
Nagpropose na din naman sya sakin last year ata? Pero ayun wala naman ganap til now. I dunno kung anong purpose ng proposal na yan? 
Anyways, punta tayo sa gusto kong ishare.
May ka workmate tong bf ko na specific na babae na nacaught na ng attention ko way back 2023 pa. 
Una kong napansin is yung group photos nila sa office eh lagi silang magkatabi.
Basta every group pic magkatabi sila kaya sinita ko sya about dun. Sabi ko na baka pwede sa lalaki sya kumaibigan at di sa opposite sex.
Ako kase yung tipo na walang filter at maririnig mo talaga lahat ng nararamdaman ko pag may concern ako.
So ayun wala naman masyadong issue kase yun lang naman napansin ko halos. Casual na pang work lang naman ang usap nila sa viber so wala naman ng ibang suspish kumbaga so parang nawala nalang yung issue.

Konting backstory, etong bf ko okay naman kaso laging kapos in terms of financial.
Technically, nakatira sya sa bahay namin. Ambag nya lang is 3k a month.
As in unli use ng internet, water, electricity, shelter, at food. 3k lang ambag nya. 
Pero madalas pag lalabas kami ako lagi gagastos. Kase laging kapos.

So going back, 2024 nakita kong active na kachat nya na naman sa viber etong certain girl co worker na ito. Medyo may konting asaran sa chat.
So ngayon tinanong ko sya na ganon pala sya kaclose sa mga babae sa office nila na talagang casual nalang magasaran.
Tas syempre, as usual paramg binalewala nya lang yung concern ko hanggang sa napapansin ko nagbubura na sya ng convo sa viber.
Edi nagconfront ulit ako. Bakit sya nagbubura. Sabi nya kase nga lahat nalang daw ginagawa kong issue. 
Nabalewala na naman concern ko.
Hanggang sa hinayaan ko na.

Then recently ealier this year, napansin ko yung sudden change ng style nya sa damit. Nageeffort talaga sya bumili ng damit para okay yung outfit nya. Tas andaming skincare at naging active sa gym.


Di kase ako pala check ng socials. Nakadepende lang sa mood ko kung ichecheck ko.
Anyways, random na nagcheck ako kagabi and to my surprise nag followan sila sa IG. 
It makes sense now.
Kaya pala ang active nya na magayos sa sarili at active mag myday ng ganap nya like picture sa coffee shop na pinuntahan namin or mirror selfie nya  na di naman nya ginagawa before. Basta mga random updates sa buhay nya na para bang may iniinform sya sa kung sino man magviview ng myday nya.
I dont know if may something na ba sa kanila or what pero ayun sobrang nasaktan ako kase matagal ko ng issue yung babaeng yun at nung 2023 palang sinabihan ko na sya na ayus ayusin nya pinaggagagawa nya sa office nya. At kung pwede eh wag syang masyadong nagiging close sa babae. Dami naman pwede kaibiganin na lalaki. Bat sya pa? 

Di ako galit sa babae, kase di ko alam if yung bf ko ba yung nagpapapansin sa kanya or what diba? 
Pero sure ako na interested yung bf ko sa babaemg yun. Obvious at instinct ko.
Kaya siguro nya ako pinagtyatyagaan kase may napapala sya sakin at kapos pa sya sa pera atm.
Overthink kung overthink pero nakakabastos na kase sakin kahit small cheating pa yan. Pinapantasya nya mga bikini photos ng babaeng yun. While di nya kase makukuha sakin yun kase Im fat but  im pretty naman  (eme)
Kapal ng mukha lang talaga nya kung tutuusin  at sana umalis na lang sya if ayaw na nya sakin diba? 
May napundar na din kase kami together at hinuhulugang condo.
Ang hirap basta basta magdecide pero ayun halatadong nakikisama nalang sya sakin kase wala syang choice atm.
Kung may pera pera lang siguro to matagal na kaming hiwalay.

Previoua Attemprs: Kinausap ko na sya about this but sorry lang sinasabi nya atfou ayaw nyang umalis sa bahay namin. Ayoko sana mageskandalo at kasama ko buong pamilya ko dito. 
But ayaw nya talagang lumayas!!!

They tore down the corridor, Maren half-dragging Samuel as the sound of claws scraped the floor behind them. The flickering red lights turned the walls into a strobing nightmare.

A sign ahead flickered:
SUBLEVEL ACCESS – AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.

The door beneath it was rusted and warped, a heavy security latch half-broken from months of neglect. Samuel slammed his shoulder into it.
Bang!
Bang!
The third hit broke it open, and they stumbled through into a narrow stairwell that spiraled into darkness.

Maren is panting now. “He’s not stopping!..”

“Then we keep moving!”

Above them, something struck the wall  hard. Plaster rained down as the vent along the stairwell ceiling buckled inward. The creature was in the ducts again, crawling parallel to them, tracking every step.
They descended fast, their footsteps echoing like gunfire. The lower they went, the thicker the air became.
At the bottom of the stairs, they found a reinforced door marked GENERATOR CONTROL. Samuel tried the handle. Locked.

He raised his gun, and shot the latch. The echo roared through the stairwell.
The door swung open to reveal a cavernous basement humming faintly with failing machinery. Rusted generators lined the walls, cables snaking across the floor. The red emergency lights barely reached the far end of the room.

Samuel shut the door behind them, dragging a heavy pipe across the handle to wedge it closed. Maren collapsed against the wall, trembling.

“Ohh my God, we are gonna fucking die here! This is it!"" 

Samuel grabs her shoulders ""No we will get out of this! Think really hard, what could we use against him?""

From the other side of the door came a loud  bang. Then another. The metal creaked.

Samuel stepped back, his gun raised as Maren rushed over to the generator.

“He’s gonna break through.”

Maren responds. “Let him..”

The detective frowned. Then his eyes darted upward.
The vents. A faint hiss, air shifting.
The grate above them twisted, and a long, clawed arm slid through the opening.

Samuel looks at Silv in a panic. ""Maren.. whatever you got planning.. could you maybe speed it up?!""

The lights dimmed further as one of the generators sparked out. For a moment, total darkness. Then, in a faint red dim emergency light, Silv dropped from the ceiling, landing in front of the exit.
His movements were fluid now, animalistic.

Silv straightened slowly, tilting his head, breathing deep as if tasting their fear. The sound of the generators pulsed behind him like a heartbeat.

He took a step forward.
Then another.

Samuel fired again. click.
Empty. The creature let out a wet chuckle and lunged. Samuel barely managed to shove Maren out of the way as the creature’s claws shredded through some metal pipes, sending sparks into the air. The impact rang through the generator room.

He raised a broken pipe, swinging wildly. The strike landed across Silv’s shoulder making him turn, the creature's lips peeled back into a snarl that exposed a jaw full of serrated, uneven teeth. Maren scrambled to her knees, eyes darting across the generator panels, her fingers trembled as she followed the cables to a half-scorched control box.

The hum of the machines around them was weak, dying but had just enough energy for a final push.

Maren shouts. “If I can reroute the current, the backup floodlights might still work!""

She tore open the control box with a wrench. Wires hissed and crackled. Her hands moved fast, crossing cables, ignoring the horrors behind her as heat seared her fingers.

Silv snapped his teeth into the metal pipe, pushing Samuel further into the ground. “Whatever you’re doing, do it now!”

Silv let out a roar, releasing the pipe before holding himself up to rip apart the detective, his claws outstretched.

Maren slammed the switch. The room exploded in white light. Every overhead lamp burst to life at once, flooding the sublevel with searing brightness. The sudden glare reflected off the steel walls, pure and merciless.

Silv screamed.
It wasn’t human. It was rage and agony fused into one shriek. He stumbled backward, thrashing. His tail smashed into the generators.

For the first time, Samuel saw him clearly — the jagged stitching of the grey worn out suit he wore, the unnatural blending of muscle and sinew, his foggy eyes shot in pain as he covered his eyes shut.

Samuel shouts in surprise. “The lights! He can’t handle direct exposure!”

Silv let out one last guttural hiss before he retreated, scrambling back up the wall like a reptile, tail whipping as he climbed. He slipped into the vent shaft, disappearing into the dark with a metallic screech.

The room fell silent except for the whir of the generators. Maren collapsed beside the console, breathing hard, her burned fingers trembling. Samuel dropped his weapon, staring up at the torn vent.

“You saved us.”

“No… just bought us time.”

Samuel then turned to Maren.
She sat slumped against the wall, clutching her burned hand.

“You gonna tell me what the hell that was back there?”

“I turned the lights on?.”

“Don’t play dumb with me.” He took a step closer. “You knew what would happen. You knew the lights would scare him. How come you never mentioned it?!”

She didn’t answer.

“You also knew he’d hesitate around you. He’s torn this place apart, but he didn’t lay a finger on you. He only focused on me!”

Her shoulders tensed. The faint hum of the generators filled the silence between them.

His voice grows low with suspicion. “Why? Why does he hesitate when he sees you? You claim that his traces of humanity are gone. But I see how he pauses when looking at you.”

Maren’s eyes flicked to the vent, the last place Silv’s pale eyes had glared down at her. Her voice came out as a whisper.

“Because I..”

He shouts. “Because what?!”

She slowly reached into her satchel and pulled out something small, a folded, worn piece of cloth. The faded pattern was barely visible, but even in the dim light, it was unmistakably a child’s blanket.

“This was his mother’s..”

Samuel's jaw tightened. “Where did you get that?”

“I found it years ago… when I was assigned here as his handler. His father kept it, hid it in his office. When Silv first transformed, it was the only thing that calmed him. I thought if he ever came back…”
Her voice broke off. She looked down, pressing the blanket to her chest.
“I thought maybe it could keep me alive.”

Samuel’s eyes narrowed, circling her words like a predator himself.
“You’re saying you planned this?”

“No!.” Her voice rose, trembling. “I was trying to help him. But once his father started the experiments, there was no stopping it. He said he could heal people, that Silv was a miracle..!”

Samuel interrupted. “Then why keep it for yourself! I could have been killed and you had the fucking antidote this whole time?!”

She froze, staring at him.
“I... I'm sorry..”
Maren spoke quietly, almost ashamed.

“If I hold this.. He doesn’t see me. He sees her. I don't want to die..”

The detective exhaled slowly, disgust and pity crossing his face.

“You’re using his grief as a shield.”

“You don’t understand,” she whispered. “He’s not just a monster. There’s still something of him left. Somewhere in that thing, the boy who lost his mother is still crying for her.”

His expression hardened. “And what happens when he stops remembering?”

The question hung in the air. Neither spoke.

A distant sound cuts through the silence, a clang, far above, in the vents.

The detective raised his knife again, eyes scanning the ceiling.

“We’re out of time.” He looked at Maren, his tone low and cold now.
“You’re going to show me everything you know about him, the files, the tests, the father’s research. No more secrets.”

Maren clutched the blanket tighter, her expression hollow.
“They’re in the observation wing… but if we go there, he’ll follow us.”

“Good.” He chambers a round.
“Then we’ll end this where it began.”

The emergency lights flickered in a rhythm like a heartbeat as Samuel and Maren made their way through the lower hall. The generator’s hum faded behind them, replaced by the faint creak of the asylum’s metal doors, pipes groaning, vents hissing. Every sound felt alive.

Maren rushed ahead, her burned hand pressed to the blanket tucked against her chest. Samuel kept his knife trained down the corridor.

“How far is this observation wing?”

“Just past the surgical floor. The offices should still be sealed.”

The hallway split in two. The sign above them was rusted, but still legible: Observation / Genetic Archive.

They moved toward the archive door, thick glass streaked with years of grime. The detective pushed it open with what other strength he had left. 

Inside, the air was cold and stale. Rows of metal filing cabinets stood like gravestones, their drawers warped and bent. The walls were lined with cracked screens and shelves full of tapes, labeled in the same red ink: PROJECT NIGHTCRAWLER – PHASE 1–12.

Samuel set the flashlight down and began digging through the drawers. Old reports, photos, X-rays, each one more grotesque than the last. Notes in the doctor’s scrawled handwriting covered the margins: “Metabolic collapse. Subject unresponsive.” … “Add canine sensory genome.” … “Mother’s interference continues to impede progress.”

He paused.
That last line was underlined twice.

He flipped the page. There was a transcript,  a phone log.
At the top, written in neat handwriting: “Dr. V. Halvorsen / M. Vale – private.”

He scanned the text, his brow furrowing.

Maren spoke softly. “What did you find?”

Samuel started reading the file. “Your name.”

She froze. “What?”

He turned the page around.
The words were plain as day:

“M. Vale will ensure removal of the subject’s mother during transport. Custody transfer must appear natural. The patient will adapt better without maternal interference.”

Maren’s lips parted, but no words came out.

Harlan stepped closer, his voice low and dangerous. “You killed her?”

“No… I—”

“You helped him kill her. You were the nurse on duty the night his mother died!.”

Maren shook her head violently, tears forming. “It wasn’t supposed to happen like that! He said it would be clean, that she’d just go to sleep. He told me it was mercy, that she was sick and!..”

Samuel slammed his hand against the filing cabinet, making her flinch.

“You murdered his mother so that monster could have a test subject!”

She backed away, trembling.
“I thought!. I thought if I stayed close, I could protect the boy… that I could stop him before it got too far…”

The detective's eyes burned with disgust.
“You don’t protect someone by destroying their life!.”

For a long moment, neither spoke. The hum of the asylum filled the silence again, the low, electric vibration that never stopped.

Then the lights flickered.
Once. Twice.
A vent above them rattled. The dust sifted down like ash. The overhead light burst, plunging them into darkness.

From the far end of the archive room came a slow, deliberate sound, claws dragging against metal.

Both the nurse and detective pressed forward through the maze of steel doors, the scent of mold and ash clinging to the air. Behind them, the sound of claws scraping against ductwork drew closer.

Maren calls out. “We need to keep moving,  he’ll know if we stay here.”

“You seem to know exactly what he’ll do, and don't say we. He doesn't smell YOU, he smells me!”

She didn’t answer. Her eyes darted toward the emergency stairwell, then back at the vent grating overhead that trembled slightly.

Samuel’s grip tightened on his weapon.
“You’re not telling me something. Where the fuck is the exit?!”

Maren snaps at him. “You don’t understand! I’ve been trying to keep him calm, to keep you safe!”

He cut her off. “You’ve been lying since we got here!”

They reached a cell door. Maren shoved it open, but instead of going through, she stopped and turned. Her hand slipped behind her back, fingers curling around a tranquilizer syringe hidden under her coat.

Samuel realizes. “What are you!-”

The needle sank into his neck before he could finish. He stumbled backward, the world swaying and blurring. The knife clattered to the floor, rolling in a dizzy circle. 

Maren spoke out almost tearful. “I’m sorry, Detective. But he only hunts the ones who don’t belong here.”

She shoved him through the doorway, into the padded isolation room. The same metal door she’d shown him earlier. It slammed shut behind him with a hollow clang.
He pounded on it weakly, voice slurred from the sedative.

“You’re out of your damn mind, Maren!”

Through the reinforced window, he could see her, breathing fast, her face pale and trembling.

“He won’t hurt me. He remembers my scent. His mother’s scent.”
Then the vents above him groaned. The air shifted.

Samuel’s eyes widened as something massive crawled down from the shadows, his pale skin glistening, breath rattling like a growl trapped in its throat.

The monster dropped into the room, crouched low, the tattered remains of what was once his father's grey suit from the photos clung loosely to him. 
Maren stood outside the window, clutching the blanket to her chest, watching with a trembling smile.

But then Samuel moved.
With a surge of adrenaline, he snatched the blanket from her through the narrow gap when she peeked through the viewing glass. 

Maren screams out, reaching for the blanket. “No! Give that back!”

He stumbled backward, clutching it like a lifeline. Then he dragged the filthy blanket through, throwing grime and ash onto Maren until the perfume’s soft floral trace was replaced by decay. He finally gave-way to the tranquilizer and collapsed against the wall, sliding back down. 

The creature froze mid-step. Its nostrils flared. The scent was now solely on Samuel. Slowly, its gaze turned toward the window where Maren stood, now unshielded.

Her face fell. “Silv… it’s me. It’s..it’s Maren!”

The creature’s head tilted, the muscles in its jaw twitching as if trying to remember the name. Then it screeched, a sound like metal splitting in half, and launched itself at the door.

“No— NO!”

The reinforced door broke through before the creature dragged her through the hallway thrashing her around in his jaws. Her screams echoing down the corridor before they were abruptly cut off.

Silence followed.
“Guess you finally found your justice.” he muttered under his breath before finally embarrassing the darkness. 

FBI vans idled in the overgrown driveway, emergency lights flashing across the broken windows. Samuel sat in the ambulance truck beside his supervisor Raines, both watching as teams in hazmat suits combed through the ruins of Ironwood Asylum.

Raines speaks out. “Nothing. No bodies, no signs of the nurse, no tracks. Just claw marks… and blood.”

Samuel's jaw tightened.
He didn’t answer. His eyes lingered on the shattered open gates. 

“You’re lucky to be alive, Detective. Whatever happened down there, it’s done. You hear me?”

He nodded slightly, though his gaze didn’t waver.

“Yeah. Done.”

But as the words left his mouth, a cold breeze slipped through the asylum’s entrance, whispering against the walls like a breath, making Samuel shiver. 

 Samuel's Apartment (Weeks Later)

The city’s hum outside was almost too normal. On his coffee table sat a sealed evidence box marked PROJECT NIGHTCRAWLER — returned to him after debriefing. He hadn’t opened it.

His supervisor’s voice still echoed in his head. “You’re off duty for a month. Take it. You need it.”

The apartment lights flickered once, then steadied.
Samuel sat back on his couch, staring at the reflection of the TV screen black and blank.

Last year I used 4 steel wool pads per 1 gallon of 6% vinegar as a base for my ebonizing solution. It sat for 3 months while we waited for the ground to thaw, the steel was totally dissolved at that point.

  
Because I was applying it to pine, I read that I needed to increase the tannins. I added coffee and tea directly to the vinegar for about a week and then strained & stained. The wood turned out deep brown almost black. The color has stayed true in our intense Colorado sun and I'm super happy with it.

  
I am gearing up for another project but now I'm seeing that people apply the tannins, let it dry, then the iron acetate.

  
My question is this: Did I basically make a 1 shot stain by mixing them together or did I just get really lucky with my results? Has anyone else done it like this?

1pyazoj,https://www.reddit.com/r/amiwrong/comments/1pyazoj/am_i_wrong_for_treating_a_news_station_tour/,Am I wrong for treating a news station tour disclaimer like a software license agreement?,"Yes, because that's exactly how I treated it.  Burner account because I don't want this tied to my main.  I took video of all that happened, but I was advised to keep it to myself for now in case any legal funny business happens.

I (43M) recently won a contest a local news station put on for a gift card by a major credit card company.  They asked me if they can mail it to me or pick it up at the news station.  I asked them if I pick it up in person, can I take a tour of the studio.  They say sure why not.  I then ask if I can do the tour while Lisa (Fake name, 30F) is there.  Lisa is one of their weather forecasters and since she was hired, the station's ratings went up.  It's easy to guess why: She is rather busty with the body of an SI swimsuit model, beautiful face and a personality that is perfect for TV.  She also revealed via her socials recently that she is single (Which I'm sure a lot of people were shocked to hear).

So anyway, I go to the station and they have me sign a disclaimer before I do the tour.  I don't read it, I just sign it (Otherwise, they wouldn't have let me do the tour).  So then I see Lisa.  We greet each other and get to talking.  Turns out, me and her have a lot in common.  I figured ""screw it"" and asked her out, basically ""I am not familiar with that type of cuisine, maybe I could take you out to one of your favorite places so I can get familiar and also get to the know the woman behind the news personality?""  She said, ""Are you asking me out on a date?""  ""I guess I am,"" I tell her with a wink.  ""Wait here,"" she tells me before walking away and disappearing.  I had a bad feeling so that's when I started recording with my phone and put it back on my holster....

....A couple of minutes later two burly looking dudes dressed in polo shirts and khakis came up to me and demanded to know if I asked Lisa out on a date.  I said yes, because like a certain basketball player once said, you miss 100 percent of the shots you don't take.  That's when one of them said ""There are some shots you should know better not to take and you have 1 minute to leave the premises otherwise we will call the police and have you arrested for trespassing.""  I asked them if I can ask one question before they start the countdown.  They sigh and say sure.....

I am not a conventionally attractive person.  But even non conventionally attractive people have the right to swing for the fences.  So I asked the guards, ""would any of this be happening if I looked like Chris Hemsworth or Ryan Reynolds?""  That's when one of the guards yells ""Alright that's it!"" before grabbing my arm and forcefully trying to lead me to the door.  I practically shout ""Get off of me!  Let me go!"" as loud as I can.  That's when Lisa came around and shouted at them to let me go.  She apologized to me, and asked the guard why he decided to go all WWE on me.  That's when he said ""he violated the disclaimer.""  She looked confused, as did me.

That's when the station manager, the guy who initially gave it to me, came over to us and told me ""Clearly you didn't read it.  It said, towards the bottom that you will not make any advances, romantic or otherwise towards the on-air talent.  I specifically told our security staff that I found it very odd that you asked to do the tour when Lisa is here and I told them that if you so much as ask her out for coffee to remove you from the building.  Your appearance has nothing to do with it.""  Yeah BS, because if it really didn't that one guard would not have reacted that way, but I choose not to say anything in response to that.

But anyway, I told the manager, ""Come on man no one reads those things before they sign it if they know refusing would get them denied the tour, it's like a software license agreement, everyone just hastily scrolls down and clicks next.  Same thing here, they just sign it.""  As for Lisa?  She actually was not offended at all and thought it was very flattering.  In fact, she said yes and we're going out to one of her favorite ethnic restaurants.  So I guess, good on me?

Of course, some people are saying that if they put the blurb of ""you can't hit on or ask out our staff"" there must have been a reason for it (Past experience, maybe?) and that I should have read it first.  Some are saying I was lucky she said yes to the date because if she \*was\* offended I could have been ""the guy"" that caused them to cancel out any future tours.  I am really wrong here?  I didn't bother reading the disclaimer because who realistically does, I shot my shot and have a date out of it!",0,1766977977.0,amiwrong,10,0.26,False

I'm 47, divorced for quite a while now, and have been single for the last three years. I have a daughter who’s currently studying at the University of Chicago. The past several years have been mostly about work and navigating some big life changes, but lately I’ve been feeling like it’s time to reach out again and build some meaningful friendships with women who are in a similar chapter.I’ve settled into a pretty low-key lifestyle these days 

My ideal weekend would be to do some relaxing morning yoga; take a walk to clear my head; drink coffee on the porch and read a good book; try some new recipes in the kitchen; or dream about my next solo trip to some quiet and beautiful place. I’m long past the late nights out, and now I’m much more drawn to calm, deep conversations and friendships that grow slowly and naturally.I’d love to find a few steady female friends to stay in touch with every now and then — sharing what we’re reading or listening to, talking about the funny or tough parts of midlife, celebrating little wins, or just being there for each other when one of us needs a kind ear. I'm especially interested in connecting with women who are also going through an empty nest phase, or who are simply enjoying this quieter, more independent phase of their lives. Online friendships work very well for me (time difference is not a problem for me at all—sometimes receiving a short message before bed is the best moment of my day)

If you happen to live near Los Angeles, that would be even better. If you’re looking for the same kind of easygoing, supportive connection, feel free to reply here or send me a message. Tell me a little about yourself — maybe something small that made you smile this week, or a book that’s grabbed you lately. I truly believe good friendships take time and care, and I’m happy to let them develop at whatever pace feels right.Looking forward to hearing from you—Toivon, että nautit joka päivästä täysin siemauksin#Finnish

 I want to start being upfront and not like wasting time. I'm not going to sit aroundwondering where I stand. My plan for Tuesday is to finish the workout, ask her to grab coffee immediately after, and then be 100% straight with her.
​I’m planning to tell her: ""Look, you’re beautiful and I’m really into you. I’m not looking for a 'gym buddy' or to be in the friend zone."" My friend says women her age respect that kind of directness and ""leader"" energy. If she’s down, I’m moving the conversation toward getting a hotel/private spot since she lives with her mom and sisters. If she’s not, at least I didn't waste another week being her ""unpaid trainer.""

​Reddit, I need your take:
​Is my friend right that the ""coworker"" is a red flag, or is her making Tuesday a 1-on-1 a green light?
​Is being that blunt (""I don't want to be in the friend zone"") the right move for a 45-year-old woman, or is it too much too fast?
​How do I handle it if she says the coworker was a guy?",0,1766977910.0,AskMenAdvice,35,0.38,False

my problem is that when brewing a shot the pressure gauge will not go past the pre infusion mark, and the shots taste terrible. i have tried so many different grind sizes and doses and this does not change. i have tested on both the dual wall and single wall baskets with the same results. i have also noticed that when a shot choked, the pressure still stayed within that range which i think is an important detail. you’d think that choking it would raise it to max pressure. but when i tried back flushing with the rubber disk the pressure actually raised to max which is confusing. 

i am using a kingrinder k2 so i know the grinder is not a problem. i have already replaced the worn gasket and have cleaned the group head and descaled. i am currently waiting on a scale to be delivered, and this seems to be the last factor that could make this user error since i was dosing by eye before (approximately a few mm below the basket rim after tamping). but i thought that the dual wall should be a lot more forgiving with grind size and dosing issues, but again i was still getting the same results with that. i have just done so many test runs (one and a half bags of coffee to be exact) that you’d think id get it right at least once.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

Also, since there's no wall behind the beam, I think I will need to exchange it for one with tab tension.  

As for a projector would it be best to hang it from the ceiling by the bed or can it sit on the coffee table in front of the couch?

I am open to spending up to $2K for both the projector screen and the projector. The projector screen would also need to be manual (no electrical source).  TIA for any suggestions!

Before my fantasy football playoff game this week, I made a small altar and did a few simple offerings.

I burned some tarwood first to cleanse the space, then wrote my fantasy lineup on a piece of paper and burned that too.. kind of as a way of letting go of control and trusting whatever was going to happen.

After that I made a few offerings:

Black coffee for Odin (clarity and wisdom), a bowl of fruit for Freya (abundance and good fortune), and a small obsidian weapon for Thor (strength and protection). I said a short prayer/invocation and included a few personal spiritual items that matter to me.

Nothing big or dramatic. Just intentional and respectful.

 I didn’t just win….. I ended up having the highest scoring week of any team for the entire season. Stuff went my way in a way that honestly surprised me.

I’m not saying the gods are out here managing fantasy lineups 😄 but I do think there’s something powerful about pausing, setting intention, and acknowledging forces bigger than yourself.

So whether it was coincidence, mindset, alignment, or something else… I’m grateful.

\- One Ecoflow Delta 2 max : gets charged by main power line through a voltage regulator (coz power flactuates like crazy) when power is on, it can charge really fast , but i set it to charge around 1kw, this unit powers the pcs, wife's sewing machine, lights, coffee machine, washing machine when cycle is light, i do not use it to power the fridge and the freezer we will get to those later

\- Power banks: cheap , simple, they charge your usb devices, like phones tablets etc.. i got a few to use with boost converters to power on the routers, routers can run days on decent power banks (the boost converters can be bought for cheap on aliexpress etc..)  


\-Flash lights : got a lot of them , with backup flashlights and backups for those backups.. they are cheap , so you can have a ton, and can never have enough, a good flashlight pointed at the ceiling can light up a whole room, most my flashlights run on 18650/21700 batteries , i also got some with small solar panels, but they are pretty useless during the winter, almost forgot to mention head mounted flashlights, they are very useful when you need both hands to do something and need to light up workspace, path etc..

\- Generator : at first i didn't think would need one coz i always could charge the ecoflow off main power line, but sometimes battery runs out and power doesn't come back for hours or days, that's why i got a generator, my first generator was a traditional 4stroke generator, 2000 watts, could handle the frighe freezer, lights etc.. but the ecoflow refused to get charged from it, because of hight harmonic distortion, so i got an inverter generator, which the ecoflow happily charges from and compared to the older generator it consumes much less fuel and produces much less noise, for the generator i always have 35 liters of fuel, incase local gas pump gets bombed or something, and every few months i just pour it into the car and stack up on fresh fuel

so to sum it up, ecoflow for everything except fridge freezer and boiler, when power outage is too long and battery is out, i power on the genny, boiler on to heat water, fridges on, and battery is charging, all runs on generator for couple of hours while the ecoflow charges, and then i shut off the genny and run the ecoflow.

WE EXPLORED MORE THAN WE PLANNED : we explored Connaught Place, Janpath, Palika Bazaar & the nearby areas, all while having our hands over each other's shoulders- laughing & giggling (and clicking photos till we run outta storage) 🥹💪🏼

And there comes my favourite part: the street food!! i tasted some of the foods I didn't even knew the name of and that was so yumm, it tasted brtter with friends - a shared cold drink is better than an individual starbucks coffee 🙂‍↕️🫶🏼

I thrifted so many goods (infact, we went to the market place twice, lol) and it feels so wholesome ❤️😋

My dad has a room there and will come over sometimes which makes me feel uneasy and my grandparents need more help so I feel like I'm working when Im home too by helping them but I suppose thats my way of paying rent but at the same time I feel like I can't get much space or relax!

I have a bachelor's in economics and spanish and I've applied to quite a few jobs here in LA(teaching, accounting/finance, and marketing) but haven't heard anything so I'm thinking I might be better off applying out of state but am I better off moving first or finding a job first?  The three places i want to move to are more affordable and it seems like maybe less competition?  The only work experience I have rn is being a tutor, administrative assistant and a behavioral health technician at a Rehab center(current job but it's not for me, only making $21 an hour in LA).

I’ll wake up in the morning and have energy. I’ll feel wide awake before my coffee. As soon as I sit down and enjoy my cup, I feel tired as soon as I’m done drinking it.

This one is even more weird. If I have an afternoon cup of coffee (3-4pm), I’ll go to bed with no issues (10pm). If I skip my afternoon coffee, I can’t sleep and end up going to bed around 1am. 

TLDR: When I drink coffee, I am tired. When I don’t, I am awake.

WE EXPLORED MORE THAN WE PLANNED : we explored Connaught Place, Janpath, Palika Bazaar & the nearby areas, all while having our hands over each other's shoulders- laughing & giggling (and clicking photos till we run outta storage) 🥹💪🏼

And there comes my favourite part: the street food!! i tasted some of the foods I didn't even knew the name of and that was so yumm, it tasted brtter with friends - a shared cold drink is better than an individual starbucks coffee 🙂‍↕️🫶🏼

I thrifted so many goods (infact, we went to the market place twice, lol) and it feels so wholesome ❤️😋

meet the crew:

My 6yo cat is a big scratcher. Scratches a bunch to bury his litter, scratches the floor to “bury” any food he doesn’t eat, scratches our couch and all the scratch mats we got. I understand this is normal cat behavior, cool. Recently, we got a new coffee table and ever since we set it up he’ll hop on, and even when it’s completely empty, he’ll start pawing at the table top like he’s pushing litter or burying food.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

A friend of mums just swung by, caught us unprepared with little leftovers in the house due to us throwing everything from christmas out this morning before he rocked up. 
Dad was pissed off that we'd wasted the food. 

Said friend said he was on his way for another round of chemo but thought he'd pop in and say his goodbyes now as the doc reckons he only has a few weeks to live.
Mum and dad laughed and mum ""oh I have a strange thing that happened on my arm, look at the bruise, the dr said I only had a few weeks to heal it. So yeah. Mine's weirder."" 
This friend of hers said ""oh im sorry to hear that. Its sad youre going through a rough time. My wife just died so youll have to forgive me if im not super talkative today. I'm a little down as i miss her but im not ready to join her, gotta say my goodbyes anyway.""
They laughed again and my dad looked him up and down and said ""well f&%*ing get over it! Boo hoo your wife is died.""
The friend sat down and said he'd like some water. Dad demanded he have a coffee instead so made him one but then gave him some water after. Dad asked what the friend got him for Christmas. 
The guy shook his head, so my mum asked for something else from him - a nice picture she saw on his wall once that she wanted.
The guy looked like he was about to faint and it was only then did my dad realise how frail the friend was. Dad pushed me out of the room stating to me: ""You're making this guy feel awful. Look at him, hes so skinny, cant even stand up! Get out!"" I explained the poor bloke is battling cancer and dad screams ""why does no one tell me anything?! What are you stupid?! How dare you not tell me."" 

I've walked away but i wanna get the so-called friend outta there now. They've said enough. Sometimes they can be so dense and uncaring. 
Sometimes i want to walk out the door and never stop walking, never come back. I'm only here because they need someone to help them and I cant afford to rent anywhere rn. It's within every fibre of me to not scream ""get me outta here!!""

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1py9yzk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1py9yzk,"[MANGA CH106 Spoilers] My thoughts and theories, again (+2 cute Emilyko panels)","I'm here to continue where i left off. I'm about to read more but i want to write off my current thoughts before i move on to the next chapter, right now i've finished CH97, so let me begin. Also as i go through the story, i'm gonna casually collect Emilyko manga panels that i think are exceptionally cute (Yes, all Emilyko is cute, but i wanna get the best panels)

First of all i'm quite impressed by the last chapters. Starbearers almost brainwashed the ""living dolls"" by using Benjamin's soot powers, but Emilyko ""reminded them it was bitter and everyone came back to their senses. It's somewhat silly. I thought Emilyko was about to get another kick (Screw you Barbie i FELT that <:( ) but it thankfully wasn't the case because everyone agreed with her after all. It was also, even disregarding morals a correct move for Barbie to not kick Emilyko because if she did it'd cause uproar because they'd see it all without being brainwashed and that may cause them to defend Emilyko, or atleast have even more doubts 

Something i think is important i've noticed at the party is that Mia's and Douglas's reactions were quite confused. Why those two? Well, they already drank the coffee when Edward ""Recruited them"" as his spies, i think just a little bit before?? Probably a day ago? And they had no reaction. The picture with everyone being in the hall about to get the coffee had things drawn far too small for me to recognize Mia and Douglas, however, in page 15 of CH96 we see both of them walking away together with Mia having a ""..."" as a bubble. Clear sign of confusion to me - She was just brainwashed, but since that was a day ago, while the effect is too strong it isn't strong enough for her to perceive the fake coffee as ""awesome"" and instantly blurt out Shadows House propaganda. The way i was led to that conclusion is when i thought Mia might potentially switch sides and tell Emilyko about Sara and Douglas's spying on her - but i forgot they drank the coffee back then. That's when i remembered it - leading me to carefully go through the drinking party again because their reaction to it felt important for some reason

But anyway, since Edward's coffee prevents Mia from thinking for herself and aiding Emilyko for now, that is unfortunately not possible for quite some time. 

Now, the whole last chapter (97) was extremely well done tbh. it showed Ricky having thoughts and becoming paranoid - even of Kate and others aside from Patrick (Although at first, even Patrick). He recalled his name being the shadows name in the past aswell - which cleared some of my confusion towards the Shaun scene. I initially thought Shaun figured it out through deduction after not being brainwashed for quite a bit, but Ricky's just seemed like a memory-flashback. Kind of like Emilyko's train flashback thingy. And after that, it leads to such an interesting dynamic. Kate wants to hold another debutant class meeting, which would be the 3rd in the manga (4th if we count the anime-only stuff), but due to Ricky's state of confusion and paranoia of her Patrick postpones that. However, that may actually be great because Sara and i think Douglas were spying on them. To make it even worse and extremely more tense, only Ricky realised he was being spied on and since Sara is in Kate's group, that makes it way worse for him as he can't deduct those 2 are on completely opposite sides, so he's bound to keep that information to himself. 

That being said - I think that thinking is too far-fetched but the fact that Mia & Douglas got to hear about debutant class reunion in the first place, especially that it is usually held in Patrick's room makes me doubt the fact that i was right about Kate seeing through Sara's lies. I initially thought it might've been Kate's trap, but if you think about it, let's say you allow them to spy on you, tell them about debutant meeting (When she has intentions to hold a real one anyway), setup a fake date, capture them.. not only that seems too violent for Kate and Emilyko and too risky, but also why would you give them information in the first place? If you're about to host a real meeting, why set up a fake date and let them know 2 crucial pieces of information - a possible debutant class meeting, and that it's most likely gonna be held in patrick's room, or was before just to lead them into a trap? I feel like if she was about to set up a trap for them, it would've been done a different way

I doubt it can be a possibility to frame them aswell. Let's say her plan was to give them information, then prove herself being at a different spot at that time (For example, hanging out with a star bearer, or a large group of people). Since Sara and Douglas won't report to Starbearers due to Edward suspecting them aswell - it feels kinda useless, how can she be framed to the star bearers if they won't report information Kate will set up to be fake anyway? 

And as for Edward, it feels too useless to do that so they provide misinformation to Edward himself. In the first place, how can they be sure Edward will pay them a visit strictly after the meeting date was set, but before the fake meeting, so that their info would be innaccurate. Secondly, i feel like Edward would figure out what's going on and take ""what they did see"" for granted rather than doubting his own pawns, so ngl, right now i'm gambling more on the fact that Kate didn't figure their betrayal out. It could be that she did, but so far, even with current info, i can't justify Kate's actions assuming she did know of it other than it being simply a mistake (her not knowing they'd be here spying on her at this current time), although that is possible because Kate makes mistakes aswell, i'm not just gonna rely on that

However there's a really good thing. The star bearers haven't caught on to coffee being ""replaced"" at all, which led them to blame EDWARD for giving them the fake coffee instead of suspecting someone from the children's building. Since there's no brainwashing for this week either, Edward is bound to clash with them and aside from Sara and Douglas's spying info and Kate's lie about being tired it's most likely that Kate and Emilyko won't get dragged into the whole coffee thing.   
  
On a side note, Anthony realising Sara and Douglas spied on Kate is also quite interesting - but he isn't telling them yet. Perhaps, testing them again??? Thought the whole Robe-sama arc was enough, the fact that he isn't acting as their ally right now makes me think he has another reason for that, which leads me to believe he most likely has clashing objectives with Kate and Emilyko and is not fully their ally, although he may still help them somewhen

And Ram surviving everything is also pretty cool. It feels like just the right moment to throw her in the story - a good time passed, but it wasn't too much either. I like that alot! I was initially confused on the whole ""fake clinger"" thing, but then i realised that Shirley's little morph-y thing was not the clinger that saved her from Suzanna - it was the ""rattle rattle sound"" that helped her discover the secret room. That means that fake clinger was Kate, and the doll that opened the door was Ram (Or potentially Shirley using her soot power to morph into things?) 

Anyway, it feels nice that Ram figured it all out with Shirley and is practically caught up to all information (Or mostly all) that Kate and Emilyko currently have. It feels as if she came back from the dead. If Kate does host the meeting in the near future that succeeds, i'm going to assume Ram and Shirley are gonna be there and they'll give them the sootman thingy they made for them which is gonna be cute :)

Lastly, i'm unsure for that but AFAIK since Edward predicted Ram's defeat, Shirley didn't die in a regular way, i think that is what allowed her to survive as a morph and awaken her soot powers, aswell as stay sneaky by Ram's side and save her from brainwash

That's it for now, i had a lot of time to think over things and i feel like that's enough. I'm gonna read more manga now (Probably one more volume) and then lay out more of my thoughts

CH99 update : 

Okay, well, i was wrong lol. First of all, i didn't realise that Sara / Douglas didn't actually hear their convo at the greenhouse because of being too far away. However, she told them that anyway, i wonder why?? Probably to get them in trouble w/ star bearers

Maybe i was wrong about the Belles sincerity aswell, mainly because they also came to the possible debutant class reunion location, but they aren't allied with Sara based on their reaction, so that's something. Also, it took me quite a while to realise that the Kate and Emilyko met elsewhere, mainly because of the lantern transition being convincing, the belles didn't really show it that well, too. I'm glad Ricky told Kate about the whole spying thing because that made them prevent it really well, since i thought he would be paranoid, so thankfully that didn't happen. I was able to perceive Ram's appearance, but well that kinda obvious lmao. Tbh, if Ricky remained paranoid, it could've been crazier, but i'm happy with this anyway

CH106 update : 

JEEZ that was awesome, i got exactly what i wanted. Such an awesome volume, i don't even know where to start.. Well, one scene in particular stood out to me the most -  Kate's ""i want to save everyone"", followed by Patrick's ""Eh, isn't that too idealistic""

OH MY GOD THAT'S SUCH A HUGE INSTANT TPN FLASHBACK!! I love that show so much and Emma is one of my fav characters tbh!! I'm not gonna say much spoilers, i'm pretty sure it'll be limited to ep2-3 of the promised neverland anime, although i did watch the show, but anyway, Kate basically reminded me of Emma, how surprising is it that it wasn't Emilyko saying that LOL, since she's the one who gave me more emma vibes in general. Besides that, i want to mention how it wasn't said which side did Kate take from Emilyko, which i think is definetely her intelligence. Since Emilyko is quite smart aswell! But what amused me the most, is that. compared to TPN, Emilyko is much more compared to Emma based on her intelligence. She is smart, but that trait doesn't really stand out much because of Kate being smarter. Basically, just like Emma's intelligence doesn't stand out as much because of Ray and Norman even though she's hella smart aswell. She's literally Emma! The similarities between their characters is insane. Their first 2 letters of the name are the same aswell, EMilyko = EMma. 

But then, we got Kate ""playing Emma"" by saying she wants to save everyone, and not Emilyko, but i think that makes it even better because it gives another tie to TPN, since Norman likes Emma, he can be compared to John (that likes Kate), because of that, since Ray was the more careful one calling out Emma's idealistic wishes in TPN, he can be compared to Patrick, since he was the one who said that that's too idealistic of a wish for Kate. Now the funny thing is that Patrick loves Emilyko, i guess that's the only thing that doesn't quite make sense in the TPN-relation, but i guess that's because Ray still loves Emma platonically, and maybe that is expressed by him falling love with Emilyko, rather than Kate?? Eh, this specific part i'm prob reading too much in

Another awesome part of this whole thing is that Kate reminded me of that what happened so far isn't just a string of coincidences. Although i already perceived everything that happened at the debut a result of Emilyko's kindness and friendliness, i didn't quite catch on that Shirley and Ram helping her isn't a coincidence, i guess because i didn't think much into it. I usually don't like stories being carried by strings of coincidence, but it definetely isn't the case for Shadows house even if we consider that event a coincidence, because everything else 100% isn't and after all that was very beautifully put and made sense with the plot of the show

Anyway, onto the backstory. That stuff was insane, it might be my favorite backstory tbh. Probably after Rena's backstory from higurashi WTC, maybe even above it. 

It was so cool to see everyone remember things one by one that slowly pieced into a story. It was pretty devastating to see Emilyko not be here with them at first, but in the end, it all worked out because they ""adopted her"" :P

That Emilyko treatment in the circus was so cruel. I guess i'm bound to hate everything and anything that treats Emilyko like a piece of crap, i guess that's fair enough lol. (Belles, Barbie, now that circus guy, couldn't bother remembering his name or what he was called)

Everything that happened in school made so much sense. Four of them hanging around like that, Shaun having a nice family (And later Emilyko's hairstyle potentially being inspired by his sister?) 

Emilyko's name being Kate didn't make sense at first, but then it all made sense. Since she's an orphan, i assumed she couldn't write, so i wondered if it could come down to her shouting for communication with the other 4 waiting outside the school building. 

Kate meeting with her outside the Mansion was quite the surprise - Especially that she said she wants to save everyone. I didn't think her being a special morph would turn into something way bigger especially with how calm and kind she is to Emilyko - she didn't even mind it ending here at the debut arc, although thankfully Emilyko came in clutch with her brainpower :D

Their encounter at the circus was pretty cool too, it mainly revealed that unlike everyone else Emilyko was the one that stole the name from her Shadow - since it's the other way around for other 4 shadows. It also would've been very complicated for Emilyko to write down a fake invintation name in the journal if it wasn't for Kate, since she couldn't write and she only memorized a few characters which she knew meant Kate because Kate told her. That also means communication wouldn't actually have resolved much as i assumed earlier - since she doesn't know how to write, it'll be very difficult to explain it to her with words, which would probably lead to someone else needing to climb in here, which would take too much time, and maybe they'd get caught or be late

All the time i wondered if it was actually Kate although it really should've been obvious it was with how cunning she is and that she's a special morph. It's interesting that apparently she's Kate Mirror and the manor was probably also called Mirror before, until it was taken over by Shadows

Anyway, i'd also like to mention that they all took in Emilyko promising to teach her things while in reality it was mostly her that interacted with them which made their relations grow, she just happened to be with Kate aswell - I guess Kate was looking for someone cool to morph into and she saw something in Emilyko 

Also one thing that unexpectedly hit me real well emotionally was Shaun's ""We dragged you in this hell of a manor, didn't we"" (Or something along those lines). That's the first time SH made me tear up a bit and probably not the last time given how well this story is going. I'll up the stakes - most definetely not the last time. 

But now that i think about it, i'm not sure why that phrase out of all things made me tear up. In the end, Emilyko was an orphan - what the hell would she do if those 4 didn't take her in? And isn't it a miracle anyway, she's able to spend time with all of them that she loved. Unsurprisingly, Emilyko thought so aswell. But i guess that scene was emotional enough to break me anyway, not as that is a bad thing

And i guess my last analysis in the previous post of differences and similarities between shadows and living dolls was somewhat a good call - Since Kate thinks it's a single trait that they copy

Well, idk if this chapter leaves as much room for theorizing as everything else, but it was for sure awesome. I don't know if i'll call it my favs because of how much of a masterpiece the debut arc and battle with Maryrose were, but this was for sure EXACTLY what i was looking for when i searched up for stuff similar to TPN. This is exactly what i needed in my life and i feel like it'll even be better than TPN, and if not, for sure more consistent than TPN. The TPN vibes from this volume alone were INSANE, and now that i think about it, i feel like it'll all end soon despite the fact that there's over half left. I mean, if i keep up my extremely fast pace of 1 volume per day, it'll be just around twelve days, no? Well, i guess that's still plenty, but i feel like time will fly by insanely fast because of how good ts is. Watch me cry myself to death 2 weeks later after this ends LMAO

It's 3 am now so ima prob call it quits for today, but damn, this was amazing.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1py9qhe,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1py9qhe,Review: Amandayan,"**Location: 10/10**

Situated on top of Lion Hill, Amandayan arguably has the best location in all of Lijiang, offering a panoramic view over the Lijiang Old Town, a UNESCO World Heritage site. While I'm not a big fan of the Old Town, as it's very commercialised with tacky shops selling mostly the same things, it's still worth checking out and is just a short descent downhill. The hotel offers a highly recommended free morning tour to Zhongyi Market, an open-air food market in the Old Town frequented by locals.

**Room: 6/10**

This is my biggest gripe with the hotel. Amandayan is built in the style of a Nakhi village, the indigenous people of the region, and the 35 guest rooms are clustered into courtyards consisting of around 4 rooms. The base room is on the ground floor with direct courtyard access, while the Deluxe Suite is on the 2nd floor with views on both sides instead of one. Both room types have the exact same layout.

We were upgraded to the Deluxe Suite, but unfortunately did not get one with the mountain view. The room was spacious (72m2) and gorgeously designed. But there were some major problems with the room, which was honestly very unfortunate and severely impacted our stay:

* The wooden floor was extremely slippery, especially with the hotel slippers. I would literally glide on it.
* For some reason, all the toiletries you would get were off-brand crap that were usually seen in 3-star hotels.
* There were no universal sockets anywhere in the room, and the adapter the hotel gave me was also bad in quality. Charging was a pain throughout my stay.
* No master switch by the bed: turndown service switched on all four lamps, which I then had to turn off manually, one by one.
* Last but not least, a lot of guests reported that the music from bars in the Old Town could be heard late into the night. It was so loud that I could still hear it with earplugs on, although to be fair, it wasn't loud enough to make me stay awake. It would stop at around 12:15am.

I also, in general, did not have a single night of good sleep there due to the high altitude (\~2400m). I'd wake up multiple times throughout the night. The climate there was also very dry despite the humidifier placed in our room by the hotel. I woke up one night at 5:30am with a blocked nose that turned into a horrible nosebleed. This was not the hotel's fault of course, and when I said I didn't sleep well they were horrified and gave me another humidifier, but it's an important point that future guests should consider. 

**Breakfast: 9/10**

A good combination of Western classics and a ton of local dishes. The local dishes were intentionally toned down in terms of flavours and salt level to cater to a broader clientele, as per the hotel staff, which I'm not sure if I enjoyed. I'd typically love to try local dishes for breakfast whenever I travel, but I found myself gravitating towards pancakes and waffles for breakfast at Amandayan, which were outstanding. It's not that the Chinese dishes themselves were bad - we tried a rice noodle place recommended by the airport transfer chauffeur, and it was phenomenal. One of the best rice noodles I've had anywhere. The hotel's version was just too plain. The coffee there was really good though.

**Service: 10/10**

The biggest criticism of Amandayan online was that the service is not up to the usual Aman standards. This is my first Aman stay, so I can't benchmark the service level against other Amans. I found the service to be excellent but lacked personalisation. For example, the staff would not remember our names and preferences despite staying there for 4 nights (they did, in general, recognise us). Nevertheless, we were not difficult guests, and these things in general do not concern us. If the hotel can do it then it would be a nice surprise, no biggies if they can't. 

We were upgraded and checked into the room by 10:30am despite a more or less full house, which was nice. The hotel also had 24/7 butler service on WeChat/WhatsApp - I'm not sure if all Amans have this, but compared to other luxury properties from other brands, this is definitely a plus whenever a hotel has it, especially for introverts like us.

Maybe our bars are too low, but if I drop the undue expectations that it's an Aman property and just benchmark the service against other luxury properties I've stayed in the past, the service deserves a 10/10. I also liked the fact that the hotel employed a lot of minorities who were local to Lijiang.

**Value: 9.5/10**

This is subjective, but for one of the cheapest Amans in their portfolio, the value was through the roof. FHR had a 4 for 3 promotion, and we paid about $700 USD per night. Granted that Amandayan is significantly more expensive than other local brands, I like the structured service that you can expect from international brands. Chinese brands can be a hit or miss in terms of the hard product and service level.

**Closing**

Apart from Yangyun, the other 3 Chinese Amans have been getting some flak in recent years, and Amandayan is no exception. It's perhaps the least well-known/popular property in Aman's portfolio, judging by the number of followers they have on Instagram.

I'm hesitant to give a final score, as these categories carry different weights to different people. We place a high emphasis on service and value, while F&B (apart from breakfast) and hotel facilities generally take a backseat. Also, it's hard to put a score on the intangibles, such as the emotions and feelings that you get when you stay in a hotel. All in all, I've very much enjoyed my 4-night stay at Amandayan, and would consider it a solid property despite its age and one of the top hotels in the whole of West/Southwest China.",9,1766974507.0,chubbytravel,0,1.0,False
1py9qer,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1py9qer/why_do_guys_only_ever_almost_make_a_move_on_me/,Why do guys only ever 'almost' make a move on me?,"Very occasionally I think someone likes me, sometimes its something many people pick up on too not just me. But it always ends up in a gray area where its clear as day yet not spoken into words or not really clear at all. It always lives in a place where its so convincingly obvious, people would bet on this person liking me, yet they dont rlly ever tell me they do. 

I know I could say something first, I have told a guy who was like this with me how I liked him in the past thinking that it would bring us closer to clarity. He said he was shocked and always believed I hated him, but that was it. He still reached out and acted like there was something...but never revealed a thing. 

Sometimes Its like theyre beating around the bush. Like a guy will kinda ask me out, ask me for coffee or something and on the day something happens where its like he got nervous or doubted it. I do get asked out frequently by people I don't know, but I'm talking about on the context of people I knew from my college or university who are my age and I've known for a year or more.

Its always almost something. Another guy always mentioned travelling together and hed want to have study sessions with me and ...he treated me very differently from everyone else going out of his way for me. He'd even go places just because he knew I was going and would tell me that himself, and he has flirted in bold ways that proved it wasnt just friendly. But he never actually told me directly how he felt, or asked me out on a date, or followed through with going out together. 

Its always this way, especially with the guys who almost seem deeply into me, as if it grew over the years. Like the one I mentioned before, who I admitted to liking, I knew him from highschool and its been 8years since then and he still frequently keeps in touch with me..flirts too. I know he doesnt generally do this to my other friends from highschool, and he told me he doesnt talk to his bestfriend from then either. 

The whole time during HS it was like clear he was into me but I wasnt allowed to date so I rejected his hang out invitations, nothing ever happened, but until now he has never said ""i like u"" hes only ever flirted, or back then asked me to hang out to do something very strange like go to the shops or gym or something (he was an awkward teen so i get it) but even once when he asked me to get a drink together and I agreed, he never actually followed through. I got nervous and didnt reach out either, nothing happened..but it was just that, 'almost' something.

If you saw us together back in HS, even our teacher knew something was going on between us because we were inseperable regardless of where she moved him. Even if he wasnt near me, his eyes would be on me the whole time and the teacher would ask if im rlly that distracting to him. 

So it doesnt make sense to my why it never becomes anything, why guys seem so clearly into me yet they never say that they are..even if I try to reveal my cards, they dont.

Random guys make moves on me pretty frequently, it seems easy for them. I'm always left feeling like I am making everything up in my mind....",1,1766974502.0,dating_advice,19,1.0,False
1py9q6n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1py9q6n,Saturday Morning Cartoons,"Been workshopping a batched cocktail to bring to our NYE celebration this year. What better way to ring in a new year, than embracing the good memories and happy vibes of waking up early on Saturdays to watch Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon while enjoying a bowl or 3 of cereal!


So I  decided to make a clarified milk punch inspired by my favorite cereal, one I’ve eaten far too much, yet not enough, over the course of my life; Fruity Pebbles.

This is the recipe I came up with, and I’ll present it in a single serving, which can be scaled up as much as you like. I used an entire 750ml bottle.


—————————————————————————————

SATURDAY MORNING CARTOONS

* 2oz Citrus forward Gin - infused with raspberries and strawberries.
* 0.5oz Campari
* 0.66oz Lemon Juice
* 0.33oz Lime Juice
* 0.5oz Grenadine
* 1.5oz Milk - HEAVILY infused with Fruity Pebbles


Add all ingredients to a mixing vessel, except for the milk, and mix thoroughly

To a separate vessel, add the milk.

Slowly pour in cocktail ingredients to the milk.

Stir slightly and let rest, ideally overnight

Filter through cheesecloth/nut milk bag, then through coffee filter, until desired clarity achieved.

Pour 4oz of cocktail into a mixing glass and add ice.

Stir until chilled and diluted.

Strain into a coupe glass 
—————————————————————————————

I think this turned out fantastic. It’s tart and bright. The lemon in the gin is boosted by the lemon and lime juice. The strawberries and raspberries add so much brightness and fruitiness. The Campari adds bitterness to tame everything, and the incredible fruity pebbles flavor that the milk clarification imparts is phenomenal. 


It feels like drinking a bowl of adult fruity pebbles. It really brings me back to waking up early as a kid and watching new episodes on Toonami every Saturday. 


If you get a chance to make this, I highly recommend it. Happy new year to everyone, and I hope the coming year is filled with joy and excitement!",18,1766974484.0,cocktails,2,0.92,False

Food drama.,"Ugh, I'm still new to this, not officially diagnosed with Gastroparesis but I was in the hospital for 2 weeks and doctors highly suspect it so I need to see a GI mobility specialist, hopefully getting a referral this week.


Tonight I had 1 little microwaved Castle slider and it was really good but way too much. Maybe too much bread? But it wasn't really that much. I tried not to eat it too fast. Idk. Stomach hurts, fullness,  bloating, belching, acid reflux and nausea immediately after eating it even though I took Zofran that normally helps.


Hospital doctors didn't give me any diet ideas or food restrictions, just prescribed Protonix and ODT Zofran and said to eat 6 spaced out, small meals a day. 6??? That's honestly laughable.


So far it's been a month since I was in the hospital and, when I can eat, all I can manage is 1 Breakfast Essentials in the morning or at lunch and 1 basically snack or very small ""meal"" for dinner. Anymore than that and I'm in excruciating pain and I'm throwing everything up at night. I've tried a few different foods with the same results if I try to eat more than that. I've been trying to stay hydrated but even liquids, especially plain water, makes me want to throw up, I have to drink little amounts at a time very slowly throughout the day, so even taking my multiple daily medications has been a struggle as well. I may have a bit of coffee when I get a migraine, but can never finish a cup, which has lead to caffeine withdrawal headaches because I used to be a chronic coffee drinker. Yes my PCP has been made aware of all of this and hopefully I'll see him this week to discuss it all, get referrals, etc.


I don't want to sound like a broken record because I have mentioned this before, but new readers won't know. I had to go back to the ER (thank you Reddit for telling me to go) because my legs aren't working properly now, sometimes I can't stand or walk at all, making even trips to the bathroom an adventure. When I can stand and walk I have to use my walker and it's very small, slow steps, with severe pain, weakness and fatigue, that radiates to my arms, shoulders, and neck, which remains for a long time after back to rest. If my boyfriend helps me, which he does if he's home and I'm unable to walk or stand at all on my own, I lean on him and just kinda scoot my feet on the floor instead of taking steps, I still get fatigue and pain in my hips, but the radiating symptoms don't happen, so now I have suspected malnutrition and suspected muscle atrophy, the ER said my PCP needs to order more tests to confirm.


I'm going off track. The main reason I wanted to post is to ask if I should not try to eat the microwaved Castle slider again, even though they are soo good. Is bread possibly too much? So far I've had luck with just a little bit of mac n cheese, cottage cheese, a yogurt, or a string cheese. But that's about it, and I have to choose wisely because I can only eat one of the choices a day. For example, if I want something sweet that night I'll have a yogurt, or if I'm feeling a little more hungry and not very nauseous I'll have a little bit of mac n cheese. Do you have issues with food quantity and choices? Is there a food that might be better to try, specifically if I can only eat one basically snack or very small ""meal"" a day?

1py9n3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/decadeologycirclejerk/comments/1py9n3k/the_21st_century_has_mommy_issues/,The 21st Century has Mommy Issues,"While it might be an odd thing to say, the 21st century embodies ""the mom era"". This is a pattern I have been seeing everywhere as of late. The “mommification” of everything. 

But before I get into how everything is mommified, perhaps I'll contrast it with the times that were not. The 21st century seems to be the exact opposite of the 17th century. The 17th century very much had a “dad theme”. From the 17th century worship of monarchs, especially kings, to artwork about grown men smoking and drinking coffee and hanging out while wearing black and hats with buckles on top. It was a time of ambition, conflict, experimentation, and risk-taking. A century full of testosterone and volatility with its Scientific Revolution, endless wars (30 Years War, civil wars, colonial wars), new ideas breaking out violently, lots of energy but mature rigid political systems by the end of it. Like a dad, the people of the 17th century based their mindset on authority, rigidity, tradition, and wisdom mixed with stubbornness. The worldview was conservative and hierarchical, but also youthful and flexible. 

Even the 17th century Puritanism felt like rules a father would set up for his kids so they can behave and become more responsible. Puritanism is one of the strongest cultural expressions of paternal authority in all of Western history. 

The infamous Puritan prohibitions (no makeup, no dancing, no theater, no drinking, no swearing, no premarital sex, no frivolity, no worldly distractions) all read like the rulebook of a stern father trying to keep kids on the “right path.” These are exactly the kinds of boundaries a father sets from a place of discipline, order, structure, responsibility, fear of children going down “the wrong path”.  The 17th century didn't just value rules, it valued “dad” rules. Pleasure was suspicious and duty was sacred. This is peak dad energy. Puritan writings consistently describe dancing, idle gossip, flirting, theater, drinking as childish, reckless, and irresponsible. So they banned them, exactly what a stern father does to prevent “immaturity.”

If the 17th century was the father, the 18th century was the son. A teenage boy to be specific. The culture and society had this edginess with satire, snark, political agitation, big dreams. Lots of manifestos, arguments, and bold theories. It really does have “teen rebel energy.”

By the 19th century, the child era was in full effect. National identities formed (like a child learning who they are), romanticism began (childlike wonder), industrialization took place (learning how to do things), lots of optimism and fun storytelling, but also naivete and clumsy mistakes. The 19th century was earnest, imaginative, and often self delighted, very childlike. In fact the 19th century was the first century where people viewed children as their own age groups and not just “mini adults” with the first public schools, children's literature, and other early content to cater to children. You can even look at the style and aesthetics of the 19th century like the logos and headlines on newspapers and how they had a very “childhood innocence” to it. 

The 19th century was an inherently childish era, for better and for worse. And I think it's why there was so much childhood nostalgia associated with this century. The 17th century was very different. If you look at children in the 17th century, the kids were drinking and smoking and expected to work on the farm early. They cannot be bothered to act childlike, even though they are literally children. The people of the 17th and 18th centuries were infamously forced into independence early on and were acting adult-like even as kids and essentially grew up to be perpetual teenagers. Whereas in the 20th century, adults act nostalgic about their youth in the 19th century, the adults from that century feel free to play games and buy consumer goods from the catalog. So when I say the 19th century was the child era, I mean this for all generations simultaneously. In the 17th century, kids were trying to be like dad by smoking and swearing and working the same village job as him. And in the 19th century, adults were trying to live out the childhoods they may have missed out on when they were actually kids. 

The following century, the 20th century, was then the daughter. The era of the teenage girl, the next shift in culture. The teenage angst from the 18th century was back, but in a more feminine fashion. It fits this century is like a teenage girl, as the century has radical cultural swings (flappers to Depression to hippies to punk to cyber age), constant reinvention of fashion, identity, politics, high drama, a century of self consciousness and image, explosions of pop culture and expressive subcultures. No century has ever had mood swings like the 20th.

Which brings us to the 21st century, the mother era. Losing some of the edgy bitterness of the daughter era, the femininity has matured a bit, creating something new. Unlike the daughter, the mother can't just focus on self-reliance and doing things herself as she is more outward focused since she has to look after others. She must look outside of herself out of necessity. The once stable culture of the 17th century dad era that was our foundation in many respects has over time completely crumbled down and broken apart. And now mom is cleaning up the mess. Much like how everyone was like dad in the 17th century, and everyone was a kid in the 19th century, in the 21st century, everyone wants to be mom. Whether they want to be or not, whether they are prepared for it or not, we are all Karens here.  

In addition to this ""mamaification"", there is also babyfication as well. So, to really keep an eye on this mother theme, I'm going to list a few movies and shows I've seen advertisements for recently and tell me if you spot a pattern here. Fantastic 4: First Steps, Jurassic Park: Rebirth, Playdate, The Family Plan, Kinda Pregnant, Plan B, Unplanned, Unpregnant. And keep in mind, these are just the ones that happen to present themselves to me on ads or scrolling on streaming services, and also ones that are apparent in their theme from the title alone.  I'm sure there are plenty more, but no doubt there is a lot of mom and baby themed media at the moment, even with franchises that have nothing to do with this theme, such as Jurassic Park. 

So, there's definitely something weird going on here. In fact, there's a controversy about a Disney short film called Versa, which is about pregnancy. It's been accused of being heteronormative propaganda and things like that. And while it may be instinctual for many people to roll their eyes and scoff at something like that as just being some sort of “woke nonsense”, when everything from superhero films to Jurassic Park has a baby theme to it, I think it could be argued in earnest our entertainment is in fact being used towards some sort of pro-natalist end at this time. 

As weird as that may sound to some, this century is a lot different than it was a century ago. Back in, say, 1975, people had been accustomed to post-apocalypse stories and dystopian media, a vision of the world that was very unwelcoming to future generations, and a general zeitgeist that seemed to discourage having children. And even those that did have children had this very “cold” neglectful treatment towards them, almost like they feel they shouldn’t need or want to have children or make a better world for them like past generations did and that it doesn’t matter what happens in the future as it’s “their problem”. They’re expected to have kids, “raise” them, and then kick them out at 18 to fend for themselves. I mean, who feels good about bringing life into this world when seeing the worst of humanity during World War II or witnessing possible nuclear war and the end of life as we know it? The zeitgeist of the 20th century was a bleak one. It was an insightful and valuable perspective, but it was nevertheless just one perspective. One much like the teenage girl I associate with the century. The girl who has left the innocent naivete of childhood behind and sees the world for how it really is. But also a girl who lacks the wisdom and life experience to cope with this new harsh reality. And again, there is great value in the perspective of this era. I don't use the term “teenage girl” in a derogatory way here. There is great introspection from this daughter era. There are profound life lessons in this self-reflection. But it can be a bit myopic and nihilistic to live in this perspective forever. Despite being dismissive of the century before, I have grown to truly appreciate the 20th century for what it was. 

That said, the time has come for a new perspective, one that's less strictly negative, one with much more nuance. This new view is that yes, life is horrible, but it's also wonderful. It's fun, but also boring, painful, but also pleasurable, depressing, but also uplifting. “Everything everywhere, all at once”. A multiverse of possibilities. This is a worldview more welcoming to the idea of wanting a potential future for upcoming generations. An era more open to the idea of wanting to have children. The birth of a new foundation like the father era before it. But my waxing poetic about all of this aside, let's list some more examples of this mom era that we all live in: 

\* Wanda Vision, a show about both motherhood and the multiverse. 

\* Uptown Girls, a film about the daughter of a deceased rockstar that becomes a nanny to a 9 year old, becoming more of a mom than her actual mom. 

\* The Last Man On Earth, a sitcom literally about (briefly) the last two living people on Earth who have to repopulate the Earth. 

\* The Kill Bill movies, a woman gets revenge on a man who massacred her wedding and took her pregnant child. 

\* Juno, a movie about a surrogate (teen) mom. 

\* Baby Mama, another movie about a surrogate mom

\* No Hard Feelings, a romantic comedy about a woman in her 30s dating a much younger guy. This is a good place to mention the so-called “hagmaxing” phenomenon where men are increasingly opting to date older women, something that has become more and more common over the last decade. 

\* Speaking of mommies, we also have Lady Dimitrescu from Resident Evil Village that everyone was simping over. 

\* There’s the “Other Mother” from Coraline, who people say has given them nightmares.  

\* Then there's also Rinala from Elden Ring cradling her weird egg. 

\* Then there's a horror movie called Barbarian, which I kid you not, is about a feral mother living underground who kidnaps people so she can bottlefeed them. 

\* And of course, wrapping up with Star Wars, we have Baby Yoda as well as the witch mothers from the Acolyte.

I'd also like to contrast our current moment with the vulgarity of the child era of the 19th century. Early 19th century children's stories didn't shy away from things like violence and dark themes and didn’t always have happy endings. It was a time where people could do and say almost whatever they wanted. And it was often pretty vulgar. Something like Han Christian Anderson’s fairy tales comes to mind. But today, the culture, especially the Internet, is much more sanitized. You may have stumbled across some strange censorship recently. You’ve seen memes where they censor words like man or dead. Words that have no business being censored. You may have also seen the soft censorship in Zoomer/Gen Alpha slang. The word ass becomes ah. The word bitch becomes bih. The world dick becomes dih. Not only does this also sound like baby talk, but this lingo comes off like we must now speak in self-censored ways almost out of necessity. I'm not the biggest fan of this self-censorship trend myself, but countering it with excessive swearing feels a bit cringe and outdated. Funny enough, even Han Christian Anderson’s fairytales have been whitewashed, with the violence and adult themes removed. So even he, of all people, has somewhat succumbed to this trend despite his whole shtick being dark and gritty but realistic. 

It feels like society has become a helicopter mom ensuring that we are all on our best behavior. It's a far cry from the carefree playground that was the child era of the 19th century. Nobody really seems to be having fun anymore. If I had to sum up the 21st century in one image, it would be that smiling/crying woman meme from the movie Pearl. The 21st century is a really trying time that seems to be testing us. This is the lowest point. This may seem at odds with what I said earlier about the 21st century being more uplifting than the 20th century was, but keep in mind that a big portion of enjoyment in life is having something to look forward to. The 20th century was looking forward to a bleak future. We are now in that bleak future. From rock bottom, the only way is up. It is all uphill from here, we finally have something to look forward to. Dopamine comes from anticipation. 

When we have something to be excited about, we can be happy even if our current circumstances are quite abysmal. And the uphill before us may be a struggle like Sisyphus pushing the boulder higher and higher. But one must imagine Sisyphus happy. The myth of Sisyphus has also been immortalized in song in the common nursery rhyme sung by many mothers. “The itsy-bitsy spider climbed up the water spout. Down came the rain and washed the spider out. Out came the sun and dried up all the rain. And the itsy-bitsy spider climbed up the spout again.”",7,1766974249.0,decadeologycirclejerk,4,0.82,False

I truly hate this.,"Ugh, I'm still new to this, not officially diagnosed with Gastroparesis but I was in the hospital for 2 weeks and doctors highly suspect it so I need to see a GI mobility specialist, hopefully getting a referral this week.


Tonight I had 1 little microwaved Castle slider and it was really good but way too much. Maybe too much bread? But it wasn't really that much. I tried not to eat it too fast. Idk. Stomach hurts, fullness,  bloating, belching, acid reflux and nausea immediately after eating it even though I took Zofran that normally helps.


Hospital doctors didn't give me any diet ideas or food restrictions, just prescribed Protonix and ODT Zofran and said to eat 6 spaced out, small meals a day. 6??? That's honestly laughable.


So far it's been a month since I was in the hospital and, when I can eat, all I can manage is 1 Breakfast Essentials in the morning or at lunch and 1 basically snack or very small ""meal"" for dinner. Anymore than that and I'm in excruciating pain and I'm throwing everything up at night. I've tried a few different foods with the same results if I try to eat more than that. I've been trying to stay hydrated but even liquids, especially plain water, makes me want to throw up, I have to drink little amounts at a time very slowly throughout the day, so even taking my multiple daily medications has been a struggle as well. I may have a bit of coffee when I get a migraine, but can never finish a cup, which has lead to caffeine withdrawal headaches because I used to be a chronic coffee drinker. Yes my PCP has been made aware of all of this and hopefully I'll see him this week to discuss it all, get referrals, etc.


I don't want to sound like a broken record because I have mentioned this before, but new readers won't know. I had to go back to the ER (thank you Reddit for telling me to go) because my legs aren't working properly now, sometimes I can't stand or walk at all, making even trips to the bathroom an adventure. When I can stand and walk I have to use my walker and it's very small, slow steps, with severe pain, weakness and fatigue, that radiates to my arms, shoulders, and neck, which remains for a long time after back to rest. If my boyfriend helps me, which he does if he's home and I'm unable to walk or stand at all on my own, I lean on him and just kinda scoot my feet on the floor instead of taking steps, I still get fatigue and pain in my hips, but the radiating symptoms don't happen, so now I have suspected malnutrition and suspected muscle atrophy, the ER said my PCP needs to order more tests to confirm.


I'm going off track. The main reason I wanted to post is to ask if I should not try to eat the microwaved Castle slider again, even though they are soo good. Is bread possibly too much? So far I've had luck with just a little bit of mac n cheese, cottage cheese, a yogurt, or a string cheese. But that's about it, and I have to choose wisely because I can only eat one of the choices a day. For example, if I want something sweet that night I'll have a yogurt, or if I'm feeling a little more hungry and not very nauseous I'll have a little bit of mac n cheese. Do you have issues with food quantity and choices? Is there a food that might be better to try, specifically if I can only eat one basically snack or very small ""meal"" a day?

I recently bought a few cans of oxyshred when they were half price at Woolies and loved them. The taste was there and I did a few workouts with them and felt great. I never have coffee or sodas, so my caffeine tolerance is pretty much on the floor, which explains why I was buzzed off them for like 6hrs lol. 
They are marketed as fat burners, but as far as I know that's not really true, it's just really the caffeine in it that gives you an energy boost right? Doesn't really 'shred fat'. There is a small amount of l-carnitine in it that could be considered a fat burner I guess? 
Just wanting to hear people's experiences on oxyshred, did you lose weight and gain muscle? Is it really worth it? 
Also I consider myself not really an anxious person but I've heard of people developing anxiety on this stuff? Do we think with longterm use, it could damage CNS? I only take creatine and protein supps, so I'm really new to the pre workout/ oxyshred game.

I just graduated this past August with a degree in SCM. I recently started a role at a biotech company making around $80k–$85k. I know the pay is decent and I’m lucky to have it, but I’m looking for some advice on my actual career trajectory.

My background: I did three SCM internships: two in big pharma/biotech and one in tech. Most of my experience is in demand planning, forecasting, and analytics. I really enjoyed the ""high-level"" side of supply chain and thought that’s where I was headed.

The current situation: I’m on my second day of my first job out of college, but I’ve realized our Logistics team is completely separate from the SCM department. We manage a ""service""for the product—building routes, managing cases, and real-time coordination with air/ground crews. It seems it's more operational rather than the analytical planning I was trained for. I work a few cubes down from the ""real"" supply chain department.

The company is growing like crazy (new FDA approvals coming), so the energy is high, but I’m worried I’m starting my career in a ""dead end"" for the specific path I want.

My plan:
Internal pivot: Work hard here for 6 months, then start setting up coffee chats with the SCM/Planning team to try for an internal move.

Certification: I’m looking into starting my APICS CPIM to keep my planning/inventory skills sharp and show the SCM team I’m serious about the technical side.

Few questions:
Am I getting ahead of myself since it’s only first month, or is it right to worry about being pigeonholed in logistics ops early on?

Is a CPIM worth the investment right now to help bridge the gap from a logistics role into a Planning or Analyst role?

Operational experience actually help you as a planner later on?

I don't want to sound like a brat because the pay is good, but I’m more focused on where I'll be in 5 years than my paycheck today. 

Any advice is appreciated.

Some examples:

• On 2 separate group trips, she consistently refused to take photos with me. She took individual pictures with everyone else, but when I asked to join she’d say, “I’m done with pictures, but you can take some with them”—once referring to her friends I barely knew, on a trip for her 30th birthday.

• On that same trip, during a boat tour, another friend joined late and didn’t have a ticket. When they realized there was no space, she looked up at me and said, “you sure you want to come? I know you get seasick.” I already felt unwanted, and that comment felt like a final push to exclude me.

• Relationship questions — am I crazy or are these weird? (Context is she has a bf she’d been w for 9 months before I met mine. By 3 months into my relationship, she asked if we’d move in together. She’d  repeatedly asked every time I saw her whether I’d met his parents. I eventually explained why I hadn’t: his brother is severely depressed and suicidal and can’t handle strangers in the house, which makes it hard for his parents to host or travel. Even after that, she kept asking. Once I finally did meet them, she immediately asked, “What are they like? I’m so curious.” It felt weird. Like I’d never care what my friends partners parents are like?!

Bc of this, I quietly pulled back—fewer group events, no more 1:1 time. But I stayed polite and friendly when we did see each other. I stopped sharing my location with her bc I had a gut feeling she was checking it. Later, she said she noticed I’d been at my boyfriend’s house the night before, and other friends said, “Why are you looking at her location?” That confirmed my intuition.

Eventually she asked to talk. Over coffee she asked if she’d done anything to upset me. I brought up the photos and the boat situation. She apologized and said she was insecure about her body at the time and didn’t want to take pictures with me because I’m smaller. I appreciated her honesty and forgave her—but I never fully expressed how hurt and excluded I felt, or how uncomfortable the invasive relationship questions were.

Now she’s genuinely trying and being kind, but I still feel uneasy around her. Part of me thinks that’s unfair to her bc she did apologize, but also I haven’t fully spoken my truth. Another part worries I’m overanalyzing.

For context, I was insecure growing up and a late bloomer, but even in my lowest, most insecure moments, I couldn’t fathom treating a friend this way or making them feel excluded or less than. She also had no problem taking photos w our very slim, gorgeous blonde friends, and since we’re both Asian (she’s half), I wonder if there’s a comparison dynamic. 

I haven’t cut her off because:
	1.	She’s central to 2 of my friend groups
	2.	Nothing she’s done is blatantly abusive
	3.	She’s shown remorse and effort
	4.	I don’t think she’s a bad person

So my questions:
	1.	Does this pattern seem off, or am I overreacting? I felt bc she admitted to the photos, that the relationship stuff was also valid? 
	2.	Is it reasonable to have another conversation to fully clear the air, or would that just make me seem overly sensitive?",3,1766973753.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

* **Contagion:** These are contagious—others catch these viruses from me—but while they recover in 2 days, I am wiped out for 7–10 days.

**Extensive Medical Workup (The ""Normal"" Results):** I have seen 2 Immunologists, an ENT, a Hematologist, and Sleep Specialists.

* **Immune System:** Immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgA, IgM, etc) are **normal**. I had a pneumonia vaccine challenge (titer response) and repeat bloodwork was **normal**—my body produces antibodies correctly.
* **Iron:** I have had **4 iron infusions** and my levels are now confirmed normal the past few months. The crashes have persisted despite this.
* **Infections/Sleep:** EBV, Mono, and Lyme are all negative. An in-lab sleep study showed ""textbook"" sleep quality and efficiency.

**Key Clue: Extreme Stimulant Sensitivity** I have an unusual sensitivity to stimulants; one cup of coffee in the morning affects me for 18+ hours. It feels like my Autonomic Nervous System is hyper-reactive or unable to ""down-regulate.""

**My Questions for the Community:**

1. Has anyone else experienced **bleeding gums/lips and high fevers** specifically triggered by minor sleep loss? Does this point toward a specific inflammatory pathway (like Mast Cell Activation or a cytokine storm)?
2. Given the stimulant sensitivity and the ""system collapse,"" could this be a form of **Dysautonomia** or an underlying autonomic issue that isn't showing up on standard bloodwork?
3. Are there specific functional or genetic tests I should push for next?

I feel like I'm living on a knife's edge where a 1-hour deviation in sleep triggers a serious medical event. It’s making normal life (work, social, travel) impossible. Any insights or similar experiences would be life-changing.",3,1766973725.0,chronicfatigue,0,1.0,False

My love of low carb cookies is no secret, and these Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystacks are right up there with the best of them! Primarily because they are no-bake, and therefore ready to eat in as little as five minutes! Also, they are intensely chocolatey, chewy and creamy at the same time, and they fall into the fat bomb category, so you can eat them anytime and not even feel bad about it! #allthewinning ? This Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystacks recipe was born of my desperate desire for something sweet and chocolatey RIGHT NOW, coupled with my being too lazy and impatient to want to actually bake something - or wait for said something to be ready to eat.  This pretty much describes my low carb life  you can relate, then this is your low carb cookie recipe my friends.  #lazyketochocolateloversunite The shredded coconut in these Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystacks makes them chewy and cookie-like, and the nuts add a pleasant crunch and earthy flavor.  If you are allergic to nuts then you can certainly omit them, or if you have a specific nut preference, you can sub in your nut of  you're a fan of fruit and nut bars, you can throw in a couple of dried cranberries or cherries (or ewww, raisins) into these keto cookies, but be mindful of the extra carbs if you do.  Mr. Hungry and I have been grabbing one of these no bake keto fudge haystack cookies for breakfast along with our coffee on busy mornings, and I've found that it easily keeps me satisfied until lunchtime! They make a great after dinner treat too - or pretty much whenever you want a blissful few bites of creamy chocolate goodness!

My handy dandy cookie dough scooper is in storage in New Jersey right now, so I just used two spoons to form my keto haystack cookies.  It's much easier and faster if you do have a scoop though, so I'll be bringing one back on my next trip to the States! These Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystack Cookies are everything you want in a low carb chocolate cookie fix! Quick, easy, delicious, creamy AND crunchy, and they've got that sweet / salty thing going on if you like that sort of thing! Which I do.

**RootPulse** is a web app (PWA) that acts as a pocket botanist. You snap a photo of a sick plant, and our fine-tuned Vision AI identifies the specific pathogen, pest, or nutrient deficiency. It then generates a medical-grade treatment protocol (chemical & organic options).

**The Market:**  
Houseplant market is huge ($26B), but current solutions suck.

* **Google Lens:** Gives generic IDs (""This is a Monstera""), doesn't diagnose the disease.
* **PictureThis:** Forces a $30/year subscription just to scan one leaf.
* **Reddit:** Takes 48 hours to get a reply (if you're lucky).

**The Competition Analysis:**  
My edge is **Speed + Specificity + Price**.

* Competitors focus on ""Identification"" (What is this?).
* I focus on ""Pathology"" (Why is it dying?).
* I use Gemini 2.5 Flash, which is surprisingly better at spotting nuanced fungal patterns than older models.

**Stage:**  
Bootstrap / MVP. Live on Web. $0 funding.

**Customer Conversion Strategy:**  
**Freemium Utility.**

1. Diagnosis is 100% Free (Builds trust).
2. The ""Cure"" (Step-by-step treatment plan) is locked behind a **$2.99 one-time payment**.

* Hypothesis: People will pay the price of a coffee to save a $50 plant, but they hate subscriptions.

**Why Me?**  
I'm a Senior Cloud Architect (AWS Pro) doing a ""12 Startups in 12 Months"" challenge. I built this in 48 hours using a AWS Serverless stack (CloudFront/S3/Lambda/DynamoDB) that costs $0 to run idle. I can scale to 1M users without going broke.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Me(21NB) and my roomie(24F), let’s call her Z, have lived together for about 2 years now. I’m aroace and she’s known this since she met me. She’s bisexual and brings over a new partner almost twice every week. I don’t mind but coming out of the bathroom to see a stranger half naked in my kitchen two to three times a week can be startling.

This morning I went into the bathroom to take a shower and was startled to see multiple ‘toys’ on the counter after being washed. I got grossed out and immediately exited the room to knock on Z’s door. After a few seconds she came out with an annoyed look and asked what was wrong. I explained that her things were on the counter and I wasn’t comfortable taking a shower while they were there. I told her i was perfectly fine with her having them i just didn’t want to have to see them/ deal with them. She said “Oh they’re just a few toys. Don’t you have some-? Don’t be a big baby about it.” I then had to tell her that NO… i indeed did NOT have any such things. She then called me immature and that i’m an adult and need to live like one… i do live like one. I have a stable job at a small coffee shop as well as i sell my artwork online(i have a sort of popular page with 11k followers on insta). She started acting all offended and kept trying to make me the bad guy. By this point i was getting worked up so i snapped at her and said “Well at least im not like you! If anyone needs to grow up it’s certainly not me, i’m focused on work. Not sex.” She then got emotional and slammed the door in my face.

I still haven’t gotten my shower… i might go to my mom’s house though because i don’t want to see Z again. At least not for now. I understand my reaction could have been immature but am i valid to be upset?

1py9ayk,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1py9ayk/bambino_plus_to_ecm_classika_3000/,Bambino Plus to ECM Classika? [$3000],"I currently have a Bambino Plus and the Breville grinder. I make 2 drinks a day. Usually 1 milk based and one espresso. Workflow and speed is somewhat important to me as coffee isn't much of a hobby for me so I value being in and out of the kitchen quickly. I'm fairly happy with the Breville setup but know things can be stepped up quite a bit.

After some research, I settled on a Eureka Mignon Libra and Lelit Mara X. Seemed to offer great quality and consistency and work well for doing just 1 milk based drink at a time. Compact and E61 are important for me. That combo is as much as I'm willing to spend (I'm not going for a Bianca). I can use a smart plug so 20 minute heat up isn't a problem.

Now with boxing day sales, I came across the ECM Classika. Seems like it could be a good alternative (and much cheaper than the Lelit). My worry is that the workflow for milk based is very slow. I haven't found many videos about it so I'm not entirely sure. Does anyone know how that would compare to the workflow on the Bambino? The Bambino seems very efficient.

Alternatively I also saw the Mechanika VI Slim. Without the PID it's also cheaper than the Mara X. Should I consider that one instead? If I could brew and steam at the same time that seems like it would be very efficient. It seems like the Classika is better for pure espresso but I doubt I'd notice the difference between them so would go with the Classika mostly because it's a better deal if the workflow isn't too bad.

My other question is, once or twice a year I'll have an event with 10 or so people and may need to make coffee for all of them in a somewhat efficient manner (over the course of 20 minutes?). Probably a combination of espresso and milk based. Does that rule out any of these machines? Would the Classika handle it OK. I don't want to spend a fortune for something just for this rare occasion but I also want something that wouldn't be terrible. The workflow with the Bambino Plus would probably be OK so I don't think simultaneously brewing and steaming is necessary.

If I'm not mistaken, with the Classika I could do a batch of espressos and then do a batch of milk instead of constantly switching but I don't know the limits of that.",1,1766973343.0,espresso,6,1.0,False

     Why? Water actually helps prep your stomach for the digestive process. It makes your mouth wet which acativates enzymes that are dry in your mouth. It encourages your saliva glands to produce saliva with fresh enzymes to help break down the food. And, it will reduce your gut and stomach's hunger call to the brain. You will feel fuller, faster, reducing the amount of food your stomach feels it needs to feel a feeling of ""fullness"". 

2. Take small bites and chew really, really well. 
     Why? Your teeth, and saliva are the start of the digestive process. 
     Teeth mechanically break down food. Enzymes in the saliva begin the chemical breakdown process. By chewing your food very well, you require the stomach to do less work to break the food into parts the body can use. Food swallowed whole (or mostly unchewed) that goes into the stomach leaves the stomach at the same rate as food chewed really well. The small bacteria just can't absorb anything from food that isn't masticated well and doesn't get well digested once it goes in the intestine. 

3. Swallow food with more plain water. Avoid coffee, tea, and especially soda when eating food that needs to be digested. 
     Why?  Water has no reactivity with stomach acids other than to lower the PH and actaully relieve symptoms of acid burn and has zero calories no matter how much you drink. If you need flavor make noncafinated coffee, tea, or add flavor packets to your water. 
                 Coffee and tea contain caffiene. This is a bowel stimulant. 
                 Soda /pop or carbonated drinks are high in sugar which along with the added useless carbs you then have to try to burn can cause bowel upset, bloating and other discomfort
                 Beer and Hops: Contain carbs and hopps or other fermentables that can react with the food/acids in the gut to cause bloating as well as have carbs you have to burn later. 

4. Eat slowly. 
    Why? Because the longer you chew masticate) your food, the more enzymes have a chance to pre-process the food  you are eating, the faster stomach acids can turn it to liquid from which the nutrients can be absorbed. 
               Also, your gut should have a timer that says ""Ok, the eating has started...."" and ""Ok, we're done here."" For most people 20 mintues of slow, mindful eating is long enough for your brain and gut to be like, ok, enough eating. Let's get the digestion started. This means you eat less food, over a longer period of time, which is better processed when it gets to the processing plant. 

5. Eat less.  
    Why: Many people who start GLP1's still eat the same volume of food... until thier bodies revolt. 
             Part of how GLP1's work is by slowing down the processing once it gets to the stomach. 
             Food sits in the process longer. The medicine slows the flow of matter you consume through the pipes so to speak. 
             If you put more food in than your body can move out, you're going to get vomiting, sulphur burps, and the burns. 
             I use a 4"" wide plate or a cerial bowl. I don't eat more than that at one sitting unless I don't plan to eat for the entire day. 

6. Eat more frequently 
     Why: If you find yourself hungry, eat a handfull of food every 3-4 hours instead of a large plate 3 x a day. Less food to digest, over longer intake time gives your body time to move what is in the stomach down into the intestine. 

7. Foods that are hard to digest require more time : 
    Why? Because the body requires more work to break complex foods like fatty foods and red meat down. 
               Fatty foods also turn into disgusting greasy poops, BTW. As your body starts burning fat storage, beware, you may have some greasy, oily stools.

8. Learn your body's signals. If your tummy is not growling, you're probably not hungry. 
     If you think  you are hungry-- drink a glass of water and wait 5 minutes. 

9. Pooping is important. If nothing's coming out the other end, don't put more in the mouth hole. 
    If you go for more than 24 hours without a significant poop... call your dr. and get a laxitive or get some liquid mirilax. You have to not get stopped up... getting stopped up is really really common with these drugs. 

10. Get up and move. Movement stimulates the intestines to move processed foods through and out of the system. 
       Important note: I have personally suffered from hylpoglycemic episodes and gotten sunstroke multiple times OUT OF NOWHERE. These are 100% side effects of GLP1's. 

11. Significantly reduce Soda, Pop, Beer, and Wine out of your diet when you're on a GLP1. 

12. Whenever possible eat whole foods (fruits/ veggies/ nuts) and if you like bread--learn how to bake your own bread and pasta. 
      Why: Even though we call them ""whole"" foods-- raw food is actually easier for your body to digest than processed foods and complex carbs from breads, pasta, and most meats. 
               Mandarin oragnes, grapes, prunes, and other fruit are my go-to snacks. I can eat as much of those as I want and have zero side effects. 

13. Pre-process your food or switch to a softer, more liquid-type diet until you figure out your particular body's new digestive rhythm Smoothies and shakes are super easy for your stomach. Very little to no processing required. You can add protein and vitamins to shakes to make sure you're not becoming malnourished as well. 
  
---------------

~ As a GLP1 user for more than 12 months as of 12.28.25, and as one who suffered from severe digestive issues from GLP1 use I wanted to share my top 20 tips for not being as miserable as I was and to share happiness and joy and successful wishes for you as you begin your GLP1 journey (or continue it.)   

Until I realized that I was the #1 factor in the digestive issues I was having, and until/ unless I made significant changes to my diet and eating habits I was going to continue to have them.  I had SEVERE digestive issues including dry mouth, bloating, projectile vomiting, explosive poops (sometimes at the same time), constipation, and severe pain in the lower intestine.  It was miserable and nearly made me quit the medicine.

For me the digestive issues were (not the drug). They were 100% my poor choices regarding 
     (A) The kind of food (Meat, Cheese, Pasta, Bread, high in sugar etc. high in fiber  high in fat / greasy
     (B) How it was prepared (Raw, processed, fast food, home made etc.) 
     (C) Food and eating habits (Eating fast, eating a lot at one time, and eating a diet high in fat low in vitamins/minerals, lots of pasta, pizza, bread etc.)

When I learned more about the ""Graves Disease Diet"" (or Diabetic Diet, or Hashimotos Diet, or whatever diet is recommended for your primary condition...)  and combined that with changing the type of foods, the amount of foods, and the quality of pre-peration used to begin the digestive process, my experience significantly improved. 

Since starting my journey I have lost 80 lbs and managed to keep 60 lbs off since entering maintenance mode. 

So I share these tips to make the world a better place for someone, I hope.

I’ve been working on a small but very focused product and finally decided to put it out there.

It’s essentially a Linktree-style single page, but designed specifically for churches and faith communities.

The problem I kept seeing:

Church websites are often heavy, outdated, or hard to maintain

Social links point to cluttered pages where the important stuff is buried

People just want to know when to come, where to go, how to give (Stripe integrated), and how to connect

So I built a single, calm “digital front door”:

one link

clear actions (service times, watch, give, directions, groups)

mobile-first

no templates that scream “church website”

no tech skills required to keep it updated

I focused a lot on:

restraint in design

clarity over features

making it feel modern without being trendy or gimmicky

It’s live here:
👉 https://churchcard.co/

I’m not trying to boil the ocean with this — just seeing if this solves a real problem well.

I’d genuinely love feedback on:

the positioning (is it clear what this is?)

the design restraint (too minimal vs just right?)

what feels missing vs what feels unnecessary

Happy to answer any questions about the build, design decisions, or niche choice.

This is what I'd expect for a visit in a Irish pub.  
It's toasted bread and with a HINT of the lingering notes of toffee, coffee and espresso (barely) that's to my pallet.  
I'm spoiled with some of my local reds that I've had that end in stonefruit and even pear tastes.  
This is really more what I'd expect in a wood and stone lined atmosphere with bunch of guys wearing a lot of wool. This is basically a liquid meal in the sense that drinking this is good and a way to traditionally get clean water in your system as well as calories and nutrition. But for us ..it's nice drinking.

The atmosphere here helps support that and the people are nice as welll

1py92gr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1py92gr,Hypothetical new roles: Toxicologist and Forensic,"**Toxicologist role**

A new imposter role who can create spiked cocktails (or coffee) that would silently kill anyone who drinks it.

**Serving poison**

They are able to create cocktails that contain a deadly poison, this is done by using the cocktail bar and a green pill with a black skeleton onto their mixture, then they would give this cocktail to their target and leave them to their slow demise to go do other things like doing conventional kills with other Impostors.

Then, after the meeting of that round has ended, the poisoned victim would receive a kill animation of them suddenly holding their stomach in pain and then dying on the ground, with their dead body appearing as a whole-body crewmate facing down head-first onto the floor and is located in the last place the poisoned victim was at when the meeting started.

The cooldown for making the next spiked cocktail is after they had both given their spiked cocktail and the meeting of that round has ended, and  the amount of spiked cocktails a toxicologist can serve in the entire game is limited to only 1-5 cocktails, represented by them running out of poison pills to use in their cocktail.

**Silent trace**

While the detective are able to interrogate the crew about the intoxicated crewmate like all other kills, the interrogation information they get only tells them the last location of everyone exactly as the meeting started, since the intoxicated crewmate died when that meeting had ended, which means that they very likely cannot deduce who the toxicologist is.

This gives the Impostor team a unique way to assassinate any high-valued and dangerous crewmates silently without even getting close to them, and also allow for more a bit more kills each round, which can helps in 2 Impostor with 15 people games.

**Friendly fire**

An optional setting that causes other Impostors who had taken the Toxicologist's spiked cocktail to be poisoned, which can happen when either the Toxicologist accidentally giving their cocktail to their partner, or when their intended target serve the cocktail to their partners instead.

Drama and comedy ensues when this happens.

**Forensic role**

A new crewmate role that specifically counters the Toxicologist, as the only one who can actually investigate the poisoned crewmate's toxic assassin.

**Forensic investigation**

The Forensic is able to do autopsy on any reported dead crewmates and figure out the exact combination of the last cocktail they consumed, and then interrogate the crew to find out the person who gave that exact cocktail combination.

The Forensic's notes are split in two, with the left-hand side detailing the dead crewmate's cocktail combination, while the right-hand side details the interrogation notes of 2-4 crewmates and the combination of the last cocktail they had served at the round that crewmate died.

This basically makes them a detective but specialised against the toxicologist instead of Impostors in general.

**Toxic cure**

When they discover the toxicologist, they can give an antidote to a living poisoned crewmate to cure them, with the interface being a new cyan square button with a simplistic drawing of a pill next to the green checkmark button for voting.

Giving the antidote ensures the living poisoned crewmate continue living after the meeting has ended, though they have to be careful because they are limited to just 1-3 antidotes each game and there are no visual indicators to help them see who is poisoned.

**Tip from MIRA HQ**

Don't drink random things that people give you, even if it is in a pristine cocktail glass.
