Old crush, still my current crush. 
Lingering in my subconscious. 
Always.

I don’t think we’ve ever even touched. 
We admitted to our crushes when he was living 2,000 miles away. Short lived time with snaps and calls and texts. 

He could tell I was getting attached and kindly let me go. And it was fine, focusing on school and sports, same for me on mine. 
I understood and I didn’t want something long distance either. 

We’ve talked randomly over the years. 
Friendly. 
Sometimes a bit flirty, but nothing like it was that summer. 

He’s there in my head. 
In my fantasies. 
From before then, even more so during then, and ever since. 

He moved back here a few years back, during lockdown I think. Maybe if it hadn’t been during Covid. Maybe if I had asked sooner. 
Maybe if he had asked sooner. 
Maybe if he actually wanted to. 
Maybe if I weren’t a mess. 
Maybe. 

Earlier this year, I got bold. 
I asked if he’d want to get coffee or lunch. 
Or whatever. 
Maybe I was too eager. 
Maybe he’s in something else right now. 
I respect that. 
Maybe he just doesn’t want me like that. 
Maybe I’m not stuck in his head the way he’s stuck in mine. 
He would have agreed if he wanted me. 
He doesn’t want me. 

I was bold. 
I should move on. I should forget. 
I don’t even think I’m good enough for him. 
I feel like I could be good enough, maybe. 
Maybe in another life it would’ve been magic, but all I have is this one. 

He deserves the best. 
I need to be better, but for me.
I won’t ever be the best, for him.

I was bold. 
Shot my shot. 
I should forget my fantasy. 
I should forget that there ever was maybe a chance. 

An inkling of hope that I’ve hung onto for over a decade. It was boosted by our revelation about 6 years ago, I think. 
And he’s just there. Living rent free. 
For no reason. 

Sometimes I think if I could just have one night, 
get him out of my system. 
I would see we aren’t right. 
See he’s not my person. 
Then I could move on. 

But that’s not a healthy view either. 
I know it. 
So, why won’t it stop. 
Just stop. 

I was bold. 
I feel like I need to feel you just once to know it’s not right. 
So I can move on. 
You won’t give me the chance. 
Any reason you have for that, is valid. 
I will try to forget the need that I feel for you. 

I was bold, and I’ll try to be bolder. 
I’ll try to forget you. 
You deserve the best and I know you’ll find it. 
You’re simply not trying to find me. 

I’ll be bold. 
I’ll forget the vision I have of you being with me. 
I’ll forget your kindness. 
I’ll forget how goddamn sexy you are. 
I’ll forget the chills. 
I’ll try. 
I’ll forget.

So, been in conversation with a colleague who works in a  different unit in the same company and eventually develop feelings for her.

I 28M her 25F were on a small talk basis when I occasionally used to sit besides her at work. We started to chat and there on I started to like simple things about her. To say the least she's really dedicated towards work, kind and nice to people. 

She started showing much more interest than before as initially I used to strike a conversation but recently I noticed, she smiles with a happy face when I come in at work and we've often caught staring each other, she even complemented my new hair cut and remembers tiny details from where we left off our previous conversation and even initiates conversations when no one is around. Now I've really been nervous around her so I didn't complemented her as much cause i just suck. However, I thought to ask her out only to hear from a mutual colleague that she's planning on leaving. Tbh, it didn't surprise me that she didn't tell me cause one of my best mates told me the day before anyone else that he's leaving only his manager knew by then. 

I texted her on company's Skype asking I've heard a very sad news to which she said it's true. I asked her when her last day is and it's few weeks from now. I said let's catch up before you go and she said yeah there's plenty of time. In general I've realized she doesn't like to talk about work and is a bad texter for work related topics. 

I gathered the courage to ask her for coffee last week and contary to what I thought she happily agreed. We went to a nearby coffee shop and it was closed and I asked her details and she just said that she's really unhappy with her job on the way back. Tbh I was really depressed after the fact that she's leaving and couldn't make the conversation exciting but tried my best to not let it dull. After about 20 mins when we were out of topics she said she better go after finishing her coffee. I wanted to ask her out but there were people everywhere so I casually asked her if she'd like to go for lunch over the weekend. She had mentioned it to me before in the conversation that she's out for the next 2 weekends which I completely forgot. Now, we were standing in the middle of the doorway and people were passing by and after a momentarily pause she said don't worry we'll plan something. 

Now main concern is I don't want to creep her out and want to make the best with the time I have

I'm thinking to ask her for lunch and I'll prepare something special as she said she hates cooking sometime next week, I don't wanna be creepy here so please advice. 

Next, I'll follow up about the lunch over the weekend plan and maybe exchange numbers if she agrees?

 Or should I just forget about it altogether? 

She has been really shy and nervous around me and it took me a while to get her out of her shell for the last 2 months.

me and my sister have always been best friends and talked about our hopes and dreams for the future and one of my sisters dreams was to fall in love, at 19 she met the love of her life and I was so happy for her.

I got to know bil like he was a brother and I really liked him, even though there were some things we didn’t agree on, he was really nice and he treats my sister like a queen so I was happy. Heather was especially good with my sisters health as she can struggle with it.

when they met my sister was an artsy hipster type who loved to hang at coffee shops and art galleries she also adored old cinema. She would talk to me about her dreams of being a jetsetter, traveling the world and doing all sorts.

When I say things we didn’t agree on I mean some racial stuff and political stuff. I brought it up to my sister at the time but she would always end up falling out with me so i stopped bringing it up.

They got married after 3 years and had a beautiful wedding, things were good and they went traveling around the country we’re from  for their honeymoon because this happened at the end of Covid. And also bil has traveled loads of places and likes our country’s culture like a lot.

Anyway catching up to the present and why I’m writing this post is because I’m really resentful and worried about things my sister tells me or bil does and idk what to do. I’ll give a list of examples that I just feel furious over.

1. She has no financial freedom, she is a stay at home mum and his pay stays in his account, if she wants to buy anything she needs to ask, they don’t have a joint account. She says to me he can be irresponsible with their money and it can leave them really short. But she wants him to feel like he has freedom . Note my sister is fantastic with money, she was the best in my entire family with it including my parents.


2. Her in-laws treat her like shit and he continues to see them and doesn’t stand up for her with them, he’ll only get annoyed and upset about what happened when it’s just my sister and him. He continues to see them and would rather keep seeing them and keep the peace than defend her and disturb the water.


3. He refuses to use contraception or get the snip, even though my sister has given him children and birth control doesn’t agree with her. Also her  childbirth nearly killed her.


4. He’s teaching his toddler homophobia, maybe people will call me woke but not letting your baby play with a rainbow toy or turning off the tv so that he can’t see a man wearing makeup seems ridiculous. He doesn’t let him wear anything he thinks is too “girly” and will rip rainbow toys away from him. It’s just bizarre to me and I think it really teaches intolerant behaviour.

5. Travel, they have travelled once abroad, everywhere else has been in our country. My bil has always had pride of our country and wanted to travel it. My sister likes the country bur always talked about going places. It just feels like he has done his traveling already so didn’t feel the need to go anywhere he didn’t want to. So now my sister doesn’t get to either. 

6. Kids, my sister wanted a family and I believe she loves her kids to bits like 1000% but sometime I feel like she sacrificed a bit of herself for my bil like he really wanted kids, he was a bit older than my sister and had done all these achievements and was ready to settle down. I just feel like she didn’t have as much opportunity. For instance with travel or really pushing her businesses or trying again at her studying. Another factor is her health since she was a teen her doctors have advised her that because of her condition having kids will be a lot harder and more painful.

I know this is really personal but I feel like in the last 6 years my sister is so different, where once I could talk to her about anything now I feel I need to filter myself. 
Where once her style was arty and cool it’s now muted.
She used to talk all about her great passions, now she only talks about her kids and her in-laws.
She used to be so open minded and now she’s far more closed.


My heart breaks when she’s holding her baby telling me to keep studying because she didn’t stick at it and now she’s not got anything or when I’m talking about my expats and she’s telling me all about the places she’s always wanted to go.

I want to make it clear, she never complains about bil, she is happy and loves her kids, bil and house.  I just can’t help but feel furious when I come off the phone or visit her and hear about these things or see them in person. I’m good at masking my emotions but for some reason it’s killing me, I think it’s to do with every phone call contains one of the red flags above . It so confusing because bil is still so nice like I can have sound conversations and it be good.

Please be kind in the comments, I know some of my worries may be unfounded but for some reason it’s tearing me apart.

TL;DR  I feel super resentful towards my brother in law and idk what to do about it

1gdpp9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/StLouis/comments/1gdpp9r/stl_metro_east_brewery_rankings_by_grade/,STL & Metro East Brewery Rankings by Grade,"Here are my grades for the breweries in the STL & Metro East area. Since I reside in the Metro East, many breweries out by St. Charles are not included in this list because I've not visited them or had their beer enough to make a judgement. 

When grading, it is all about the beer. While cool locations and having food (especially good food) are wonderful amenities, they are just bonus for this list.  

The grading system: 

* A 
   * This a spot you will make a destination to get to. They have multiple beers that you will go buy and return for and their beers they produce are things you look forward to. 
* B 
   * Solid beers that are a step down, they may not produce enough returnable beers as the A club, but you will make a visit. 
* C
   * Breweries that are solid, but likely not a destination for you. If you're in the area, you'd be willing to check it out. Or, if they have multiple locations you know you are not going to get a bad beer. But, most of their beer is solid enough. 
* D 
   * A place you tried but they didn't have much going for it.  
* F
   * Consistently bad beer

My list is not in ranked order. 

  
A breweries:

* Perennial Artisan Ales - With solid beers like Abraxas, Sump Coffee Stout, Saison de Lis it is hard to go wrong here. Consistently making great beer. 
* Narrow Gauge - OJ Run, DDH beers, is there a bad hazy at Narrow Gauge? They've just opened up their own location and if you haven't been you won't be disappointed. 
* Heavy Riff - Velvet Underbrown, Prison Bound, Love Gun are among the noticeable. Heavy Riff makes solid beers that you want to return for, but also served in enough locations you can pick up at the store. 
* Side Project - Well known for their sours, but have expanded beyond those styles. 
* Bluewood -  Newer to the game but making some awful imperial stouts. Their sours are very drinkable, have dabbled with mead releases, and a solid location to get a beer. 
* Millpond - Illinois - Another brewery that produces great sours but they also consistently make great hazy IPAs. Taps usually rotate frequently with one of the most drinkable and best Oktoberfest beers. Worth the trip if you've not been. 
* 2nd Shift - Solid IPAs can be found at 2nd Shift but also a location that knocks out BA stouts. You will find good beer all around at 2nd Shift. 

B breweries:

* Stubborn German - Illinois - Known for some great Stouts and Black Beer Friday around the corner. Yet, they've been known to make a good Brown, Helles, and Amber ales that will keep you returning. 
* Modern - Known well for Citrapolis IPA, but you can also find special release stouts and hazy IPAs that are well expected. 
* Blue Jay - Newer to the game but the OKAY! hefeweizen is one of the best you will have. Solid lagers and pilsners that I've come to enjoy more and more. 
* Four Hands - One of the big boys in the area with hits like Madagascar, Absence of Light, and solid stouts. You can get your hands on Four Hands pretty where anywhere it is hard to go wrong with it. 
* Main and Mill - A place that would have been an A for me not too long ago but I've felt in previous years some of their quality went down a notch or too. Fat Elvis is a beer you will enjoy.

  
C breweries: 

* Schalfly - Another big boy in the area. I don't think anything will wow you at this location, but I don't think you necessarily get a bad beer here. Pumpkin Ale, TIPA, and Coffee Stout are well known. 
* Civil Life - Another fun spot that is well known and cool place for a beer. American Brown and The Angel & Sword being some of the most popular beers. 
* Urban Chestnut - Well known for Zwickel, Schnickelfritz, and STL IPA. 
* Rockwell - A fun location but the beer did not stand out. Though what I was was solid. 
* Steampunk - Items that stood out to me were St. Draconius, and Das Festbier. However, they have highly rated traditional beers and some IPAs. Admittedly, this could be looking at a higher grade but was tough to get into. 
* Wellspent - Another location when I went some of their best rated beers were not on tap. What I had was OK. I need to get this location another shot in the winter. 

  
D breweries: 

* Square One - Nothing I had stood out. 
* Old Herald IL - A fantastic location but not much in the way of beer stands out. Printers Ink is solid, but not much rotation, and not much standing out. 
* Alpha - A fantastic Nutcracker Stout, but then nothing else stood out. 
* Old Bakery - IL - Well known for their Porter, but everything else is OK. 
* Crafty Chameleon - The best thing I found at this location was they had a good selection from other breweries. A solid Pecan Winston's English Brown, but not here. 
* Arch Nemesis - Some of items stood out as bad. It was a haul for me, maybe not for you but I couldn't find myself wanting to come back. 
* No Name - Stopped here to try it, but no items stood out. Perhaps their best items weren't available? 
* Hopskeller - IL - Right next to Stubborn German so if you make an IL trip you could easily hit this place up. ZERO is an OK Hazy, but they don't rotate and what they have doesn't stand out. 
* Shoehorn - IL - now and again you get a solid beer but nothing standing out most of the time. They've been doing more Mead at the location. Several rotating taps. 

F:

* Earthbound - Their Amber style might be the most noticeable of the bunch. While I know it is closing down, I felt the location was cool. But it would be tough for me to get there for the beer. 
* Peel (IL and MO locations) - Peel beer is downright bad on a consistent basis. The food is solid, and many of their locations are enjoyable. But, rarely does anything standout. 

Other places that I felt were too far out would be Lieferbrau in Red Bud, White Rooster in Sparta, and Scratch in Ava. With White Rooster being an absolute gem, and Scratch well-known, they are just too far out for this area. Friendship is another location that is fun but far out. 

I plan to get to some of those locations out by and around the St. Peter's area but being in IL, isn't the easiest. 

  
Some locations, I admittedly need to give another shot and try more. I welcome any criticisms, as well as suggestions for beer to get at any locations.

Been on GLP since February.   Have lost about 65 pounds. It’s a slow but somewhat steady but often plateauing process.    About 3 months ago I started getting tongue sores, mouth sores and chewing on the inside of my cheeks.  And I have crazy cotton mouth.  

Nothing else is new in my life has changed and I can see that’s it’s worse on the evenings of my injections.    

I feel like I’ve stuck my tongue on the burner.   I have found some relief with xylimelts and a non-something or other toothpaste that was recommended, and I found some sugar free jolly ranchers at Walmart (and honestly, although they sound bad, they actually taste better than the real ones).    Someone on another post said they had found luck taking vitamin B, Zinc, and lysine (which I’ve been taking now for about a month but have found no relief). 

I realize I’m dehydrated, but I drink A LOT of water, probably 200 ounces a day minimum.  I have to have it on hand when speaking or opening my mouth as I’ll get pretty bad cotton mouth.  I don’t drink alcohol, coffee or smoke or vape.    I lead a pretty somewhat healthy lifestyle.  

Posting this today bc I’m really in a fair amount of pain.  Hoping someone has found a solution.  I still have not met my goal of 180.  I started out at 250 and I get generic semaglutide thru RO.  I’m 5’11” but my BMI was a bit too high and I’ve had 8 back surgeries, so the lighter weight seems to help w back pain.   I could quit this stuff, but I know I’ll just balloon right back up. I’ve sort of come to the conclusion that I’ll be on it the rest of my life or until it kills me. 

My doc will and has prescribed it, but insurance won’t pay for it and I’m not diabetic.   RO is out of pocket but seems to be the most cost effective.  I WAS paying $1,000/month for Wegovy but then found RO, that, at the time was 400/month plus a 145 doctor fee.  They have since dropped the med to 299 but the Dr Fee remains the same. 

Help.  Please?   I’m not hoping that someone else is experiencing the same side effects but if you have, and have found a solution- please comment.  Thank You! ",2,1730075734.0,GLP1_Ozempic_Weygovy,2,1.0,False

*Date \[standardized human time\]: 1124 January 17, 2137*

Those Federation BASTARDS! How many of my fellow Venlil had been sacrificed on their alter of perfection? How many more people would die because of their arrogant hubris?

The mess hall was practically buzzing with the news, and I had almost dropped my hummus pita when I heard it. To my right, Chief Engineer Ehricke scanned the room with a concerned look, his hand on his coffee cup. ""Calm yourzelf, Ensign"" he said as my hands trembled. ""You vare your heart on your sleeve.""

""Sorry Chief, I'm just... how do you stay calm at news like this?""

The chief engineer picked up his coffee cup and took a sip. ""Mein Frechdachs, you vould be mistaken to zink I am calm. I am actually quite enraged by these... Evolutionsbremse. But ve cannot let zem continue to control us. Zat includes our emotions.""

""So what are we supposed to do. Nothing?""

The chief pointed his mug at another table, where the marines sat. I still shivered to see the Arxur warrior sitting with them, his claws scratching slowly at the other predator, K-9 Moro, who in turn had her head on her handler's leg. Honestly the two predators terrified me, but I had been assured that they were harmless, at least to us. Across from them was Sargeant Flavia, idly chewing on a piece of earth fruit as if there was nothing more natural then dining with predators. ""Look zer. Ze federation would zee terror. Three predators, und one venlil vit PD. But... Nein. I zee unity. Und zat ist vat we do. Ve make friends vit others who have been wronged. Ve stand together. Und ve NEVER step backwards, Ja?""

""Yes, sir.""

""Good! Now, hand me ze coffee. Caffeine ist a require...""

""...ment for perfection."" We both laughed.

**Memory transcription subject: Shadow Captain Xantos, Aafa**

*Date \[standardized human time\]: 0843 January 19, 2137*

I waited patiently outside Admiral Nosumi's office, trying not to listen as he argued with his daughter once again.

""And I'm telling you, FATHER, there is no way we can win a war against TWO predators, especially now that the Federation had begun collapsing.""

""Nonsense!"" The admiral's deep voice resonated through the door. ""We have held the Arxur off for hundreds of cycles, and these upstart Humans will be no different.""

""Then how did they capture Talsk?""

""Where did you hear about that?""

""Tarva and the Venlil have been broadcasting it to the whole galaxy.""

""And you believe their propaganda?"" I could hear the anger in the admiral's voice.

""I believe them more than I believe you, father. Now if I'm dismissed, I'll be with my squadron!""

The door swung open next to me, and I had to move quickly to not let it hit me as it crashed into the wall. Shadow Captain Saia stormed past me, not even acknowledging my presence.

""Xantos, get in here.""

I shuddered, knowing I would have to walk carefully, lest I incur the wrath that should have been directed at my classmate. Heading into the office, I closed the door behind me and came to attention in front of the admiral. 

""Captain Xantos... You had orders to join the garrison at Talsk. What are you doing here?""

""Sir... I'm sorry to say that Talsk has indeed fallen. The Humans are in complete control of the orbitals, and the Farsul leaders have surrendered.""

""And the Archives?""

""Compromised, sir.""

The admiral snapped his writing implement in half throwing the pieces to the ground with a curse. Slowly he stood and faced the window, and I braced myself for the anger I knew was coming. Surprisingly though, the Admiral remained silent. He stood that way for several minutes before he finally turned back to me.

""How did it happen?""

""The humans brought ships larger than any we had seen before. They wiped out whole squadrons, and even knocked one of Talsk's moons out of orbit. We fought back as best we could, but their firepower was overwhelming. They then landed several units capable of fighting underwater. Sir, it's like they knew exactly where to go.""

The admiral sighed, looking over a holographic star chart. Various units were displayed, with Arxur holdings in red, ours in blue, and the humans with their allies now in green. It was easy to see the federation was fighting a multi-front war, and we were losing.

""We have to keep bleeding these predators. Take your squadron to Mileau."" The Dossur home world flashed, huge stacks of icons swirling around it. ""You know the predator tactics better than anyone. Report to Admiral Kefka as his advisor.""

""Understood, Admiral.""

""And Xantos... ""

""Yes, Admiral?""

""I know you were outside while my ungrateful daughter was being so insubordinate. You didn't hear anything.""

""Hear what, sir?""

The admiral nodded. ""Dismissed.""

Or Ron, or whatever my name might be for the month! My OG nick is really embarassing and i will probably never tell you. But, on to the actual post! I'm a kinda weird person who lives in sweden (in a tiny apartment) that is full of a bunch of records, computers, and coffee mugs all over. I'm into a lot of nerdy stuff,  and i'm very much a homebody so i would appreciate more folks i can hang out with online, since all my IRL friends are old and married and have a bunch of kids and almost zero percent of free time outside of family.

*What would we be doing if we hang out?*

Well, we would watch a ton of movies, that's for sure. I love movies, and i'm very much into horror so i hope you are to? The shittier the better! I love shitty b-horror from the 70s up to the early 2000s, everything later got way to much CGI for my taste, i want those practical effects baby! And if you're up for it we could hang out together with atleast one other person that i know, so it would be awesome if you're up for atleast a three person hang out sometimes!

*What about games?*

Glad you asked! Right now i'm playing a bunch of wow! and would love having more people i can play with, since i hate doing pugs and the people i play most with are very busy with family, etc. So we could def run some mythics, even if we have to pug some, it's way better then doing full pug runs! Other games i frequently play is

* Apex Legends
* Fortnite
* Project Zomboid (not in a while though)
* Stardew Valley (have never played co-op and would love to)
* Minecraft (modded or vanilla, i like both)

i have a bunch of more games, and we can use parsec and emulate pretty much anything so we even can play old co-op games! i also wouldn't mind just hanging out watching  you play something, or you watching me play something. It's way more fun to play a singleplayer game with company i think.

*Is that it?*

I think so! Like every other human i'm into a TON of stuff, so listing and mentioning everything would take a whole day. (like music, tv-shows, staring into the wall etc) and yeah, you're timezone doesn't matter a bit to me! I have a ton of time, and my sleep scheduele is erratic to say the least!

Our stack is 3 floors with only 4 units/floor, all one-bedroom apartments. Everyone keeps themselves, it’s quiet, most are older residents (50+) rarely is there drama, generally everyone is friendly in passing. 
Cue in new guy: late 20s, tallish, skinny in the way that it doesn’t look healthy and like he might faint at any moment. Definitely not a gym goer. I have a strange encounter with him Monday night (21st) relating to giving him the door code after he locks himself out and is let back in by the MOD. But like whatever, I’m just trying to be a nice neighbor, not his friend. We have Bluetooth locks, so if you dont have your phone or the door codes memorized, you’re SOL. He made a comment that his phone and I’d were gone (possibly stolen).
Wednesday afternoon (23rd) I get a text from my nice neighbor who I’m friends with and sometime in the early hours of that morning (1 or 2am) he bashed out one of his living room windows for no reason. And like that’s no easy feat especially for a waif thin guy like this dude. He wouldn’t let the MOD or Maintenance Manager in or tell them why he did it. 
Last night (Saturday the 26th) I’m out for drinks with friends and there’s more drama. He scaling the side of the building (brick) and then he’s on the awning below his bashed out 2nd floor window and making a scene and he peed outside next to the building. Cops are called. He says he was “locked out” again (mind you, he’s come and gone a few times since being locked out on the 21st.) won’t open the door to the cops, doesn’t have ID, says he’s fine, go away. Eventually he gives them his name and DOB, they confirm he’s the resident and the cops leave, nothing they can do. 
This morning he’s knocking on my door asking if i have any extra coffee. I don’t answer. He also approached my neighbor this afternoon saying she should watch her back bc there’s lots of feds (federal agents) and fake people out there.

So I'm looking to enhance me daily face routine.
I want to focus on eye area (dark circles) and toner as I find my skin is so blah. 

I only use a daily cleanser and moisturiser with the occasional foam hyuolornic deep skin cleanser.

I went into sephora today and was intrigued by biossance but thought I didn't want to get sucked into marketing etc. These stores make me so anxious! 

So my sisters, as you make your way into your thirties and approach your forties what skin products have worked for you? Have you changed? Added? Deleted any?

1gdp3nd,https://www.reddit.com/r/DreamInterpretation/comments/1gdp3nd/red_ropes_a_man_in_a_mask/,Red Ropes & a Man in a Mask ,"Hello Reddit, 

This is my first post ever! I want to preface with 3 things before I get into it: 

* I’m new to this subreddit, so I apologize if I do not know any common acronyms or social norms that are normal here. I’m sure I’ll catch on quickly! 
* This post may be **long**. Apologies for the novel. 
* I am open to any feedback. I don’t have a preference of interpretation as I don’t have much knowledge in it. Any guidance or insight is welcome! 



Now! To get into it: 

I had this dream probably 5 or 6 years ago. I still think about it from time to time only because I felt a bit haunted by it. It wasn’t a nightmare, I didn’t feel afraid, but maybe a bit unsettled might be the best word to describe the sensation. When I woke up in the morning after having this dream I felt energized. I felt like I'd had 13 cups of coffee after sleeping for a week straight and like I could go fight God. I was excited, awake, and my brain was spinning with information overload – and yet I had no idea what I’d been presented with. For context I am a white American AFAB (NB) and I would have been in my mid-twenties when this happened.

The dream itself was in first person POV. The setting happened to be a shopping mall. It wasn’t one I was familiar with but in its essence had the feeling of a combination of multiple I had grown up visiting over time. It was well lit, not falling apart, there were other people around but none I recognized. General NPC’s just on their routes through the mall. It was all very green and beige, daytime, light coming through the windows. Pleasant start, very normal. 

I was at a coffee shop, bakery café of sorts, I had placed an order for a normal coffee drink I usually take and was waiting near the counter for it. In general just looking around and waiting and when my name was called both myself and another woman approached the counter. She was smaller than me, quite petite, probably of Hispanic origin of some kind. She had long dark hair, quite curly, and large dark eyes. We both looked at the drink and there was a realization that we had both ordered the same thing and had the same name. I let her have the first drink and she smiled at me, said thank you, and walked away. 

I did not wait for another drink, not sure why, but instead I started wandering out of the store and through the walkways of the mall. I looked at the stores, though I don’t recall any of their names now. It was at this point that a feeling of being followed started to settle upon me. Looking over my shoulder I saw a man in a black cloak and a large mask. 

This mask is pretty unique, it’s *almost* like an old plague-doctor mask, but not quite. Instead of having the flat part at the brow and then a beak – it was just a big curve from top to tip. It was a crescent shape quite large, it started from the face and at the tip of it ended right near his chest. It was a white mask, with red stripes from the eyes down the side of the curve of the ‘beak’ of the crescent. I tried to find a photo reference but I couldn’t find anything quite the same. 

This masked-figure was standing there in the middle of the walkway staring me down, and it was unsettling, but I didn’t quite feel afraid? I didn’t feel like prey. It was just more strange than anything. 

I kept walking through the mall, turning a curve and I saw a novelty shop and wandered inside. There was no one else inside, and there was no music playing, the only thing I could hear was the slight bubbling of water. This store had a strange collection of a lot of things, from televisions showing nature scenes, to little desktop waterfalls that you can plug in, to figurines. I distinctly remember stopping to look at a metal tiger. It was a dark chrome, it looked like it was prowling, maybe a little larger than a loaf of bread and I wanted it badly. I wandered through the shop a bit more and I started seeing the masked man in reflections of things, but not physically anywhere around me. 

When I got to the front of the store to inquire about the tiger, a woman poked her head out from a back room and waved me towards her. I ended up in the back room of this shop. It was dimly lit, mainly with candles, it smelled very earthy, maybe like incense but not quite like any of the kinds that I’ve smelled before. There was a mirror on the side of the wall and when I looked at it I saw myself and a masked figure behind me, but still I did not feel afraid, he was simply there, a shadow, and was with me as I approached this woman. 

The woman was elderly, a little bit round, small, and Asian. She was wearing a dress covered in gold flowers and it was a combination of red and blues. Her dark/gray hair was tied up in a tight bun and she seemed to be a bit hunched over. She smiled at me and waved me towards her closer and did not speak a word to me at all. Simply beckoned for my hands, which I gave, and she took these red braided ropes she had next to her on a wooden side table. With these ropes, which were… maybe two? Feet long, she began to gently drape them over my hands and tie them around them. Not too tightly, not enough to hurt or be uncomfortable, they were just bound nicely. 

Once a few ropes had been wrapped around, I remember her saying something quietly, but I cannot remember the words. Unfortunately I did not write them down. I don’t believe the words were for me. She patted my hands, I looked up and saw the masked figure in the reflection of a mirror, and that’s where my memory ends. 



It doesn’t feel like a lot happened, more like I encountered some very interesting characters. I’m not sure why it sticks with me the way it does. I’m happy to attempt to give more context if things are needed! Being that this was so long ago, some of the details may be lost, but I will try my best. 

Again, sorry for the novel, but I’m looking forward to hearing what reddit may have for me! 

Have a great week everyone! Sweet dreams ♥

It's Day 28 of Summer, Year 5. I've become well established now and after many years of him saving my life from the mines, Harvey and I connected over our mutual love for holistic medicine and wine. Being that I'm in the ancient fruit wine business. 
Now, he's out of the house this morning at the clinic and we've just reached 10 hearts so I thought it would be cute to have a fall baby just in time for Spirit's Eve. So I head over to Robin's for a consult about a new pig barn I want to build for truffle season but also under this guise want to stealthily build a crib in my house. Get the ball rollin' ya know. 

This lady says she can't build the crib because there's a lamp in the way, UGH fine. I go home and move the lamp. Ride allllllll the way back to Robin's and she's like mmmm nope sorry still can't build it there's a picture frame there too that's also a problem. LAWD okay, go alllll the way back and take the picture off the wall, ride back. NOPE now it's the rug. I CANNOT..

Absolutely no hate on Robin,  I get that's how it works but I wish she had a feature where she could just put the furniture in my inventory from there. 

Okay, so Pam def saw me riding back and forth on the ridge 6 times, nobody is going to the desert today and risk missing the jellyfish tonight. All I can hope is she doesn't go gossiping to everyone or asking Harvey about it before he has a chance to even consider asking me.

I wish I had more research on my resume, but I've got two theses and an RA position in the oven so I'm not too worried. I stretched myself thin these past two years, experienced some loss and health scares, and I'm just generally burned out. Rejections have just rolled in for some large graduate school scholarships. Those deadlines for programs are quickly approaching and I haven't even asked for recommendation letters, the idea of a ""gap year"" is looking sexier by the minute. I'm not really sure what I want to do. I love writing fiction, there's one particular *highly* competitive MFA program I've essentially tailored my CV for. But, I'm skeptical as to whether an MFA program will make me the writer I want to be. I love about half the books that come from that program and the other half are milquetoast coffee table decor. Plus, I fucking love English and feel that its reading that's helped me the most as a writer (and person). My best friend tells me I should get a PhD. I would love to teach adult students, but everyone who is actually a PhD/professor in Early Modern/Renaissance studies (my favorite area) tells me that it's impossible to find a stable position. I'm aware of the few MA/MFA programs in existence, my heart is open to these too.

I come to you all, people in graduate school, not necessarily to help me find a solution between my two loves. Instead I would like to ask, do you think gap years are generally good (for yourself, your work, your possibility of acceptance)? For those who did do a gap year, what did you do during that time? How did you figure out what you wanted to pursue? For those who didn't, do you regret it?

","Metabolism basically means the count of calories you burn per day. Repeatedly you have might read from the articles about accelerating the rate of metabolism. The most common reasons are consuming highly nutritious food and performing workouts. If your metabolism rate is slower, it shows you are burning less of calories. In order to increase the rate, you must follow the below tips:



1) Do not observe fasting because you burn too many calories at once, which is really harmful to your body. In this process your muscles turn weak and you face dehydration rather than minimizing the fat content.



2) Dine about 6-8 times a day by consuming nutritious items such as fruits and vegetables.



3) A heavy breakfast is a key factor in increasing the rate of metabolism. Since you are awake for the whole day, the rate of metabolism is fast.



4) There are many kinds of healthy fats available such as nuts, fish, olive oil, and flax oil. They can be the substitutes for processed carbs.



5) Consume less of sugar so that the insulin production is regulated and you will thus burn calories easily.



6) Eat about 1 gm of protein per pound because the excessive fat content will be drained away.



7) Remember that alcohol is uprightly harmful for the people planning to loose weight. It prevents fat burning and contains almost 100s of calories.



8) Green tea and water are the best forms of beverages that do not affect the metabolism process. So use them instead of tea, coffee and alcohol.



9) Night shifts are normally not advisable, but if you think they are unavoidable then follow the above-mentioned tips carefully.



10) In order to make your metabolism process effective use the Turbulence Training manual that provide you right instruction to perform workouts.



If your metabolism rate is slower, it shows you are burning less of calories. Remember the above points for a healthy life.

1gdospo,https://i.redd.it/x6i7bv5mzdxd1.jpeg,Part 3 - My old EFCA Pastor and Me,"So seven months ago, I had lunch with the head pastor at the church I grew up attending. He's been leading a campaign for his congregation to make at least one of the people in their lives into a project for conversion and I didn't like that, but I did like that he invited actual agnostics/Skeptics to have a Q&A panel one Sunday for his congregation to meet. 

So I reached out to him as an atheist who would like to work with christians to help our fellow community members. When we met, he interviewed me for info, then made it clear that his goal was to use apologetics & testimony to gauge how receptive I was to conversion and he told me to read Tim Keller when I said I was not interested.

I was surprised to find a text from him last night inviting me to the morning service because they were doing a similar panel to the one I told him I liked prior. Though I was nervous about being in an EFCA church again, I was appreciative of the invitation and was grateful he was inviting more non-christians to better understand their beliefs. I also wanted to show support for the non-christians on stage, as I'm sure it takes courage (and I planned on clapping if they expressed good critique).

So instead, I was met with the standard 15 minutes of acoustic guy worship music, then the pastor came out to introduce the bit and went into it. He dressed up as a 25 year old college grad who met his friend for coffee. Then, two more people ambush him to witness with testimony, dogma, shaming, & loose logic for 30 minutes.

My doctor says all is good and my bloodwork is normal, but I can’t get myself out of bed sometimes. 
I’m the primary caregiver for my mother and my siblings, and I either take care of them or get work done. I don’t have the energy for both things and sometimes I don’t even have the energy for one of them. My vision gets wobbly (?) and very blurry even with my glasses on. 


Coffee wakes me up for half an hour max, then I’m going downhill again. I recently started taking Vitamin D and Magnesium at night. I’m trying to cut gluten and dairy off. I feel so hopeless and scared to pursue a romantic relationship when I can’t even commit to my day to day tasks.

1. Fenyk Coffee: not too sweet, offered whip, dusted with some delicious pumpkin dust. I would go back just for this dust. No notes 10/10

2. Congress coffee: marketed as a pumpkin pie latte. not too sweet, well balanced, offered whip, got a stay cup and was insanely large. Great bang for your buck. 9.5/10 

3. Starbucks: It's a classic. A bit too sweet. 6.5/10

4. Rosso: started great not too sweet. Offered whip. Giving it a lower rating because all the flavor was at the bottom in a too sweet slurry. Very sad. Rosso is a favorite coffee spot of mine. 5/10

5. Brouhaha: offered whip. Way too sweet. 4/10

6. YYC Patisserie: watched the barista steam my milk for probably more than three minutes. Did not purge the wand. Gross. Used regular old monin pumpkin spice syrup and it was kind of bitter. 1/10

Looking to figure out how to get rid of a lot of stuff. SO and I have moved out of each sets of parents house. When my parents brought up my stuff my SO stood silent when he looked inside the Uhaul trailer my parents brought that was my stuff. We overcame it, gave a lot of clothes to his siblings, I have no siblings. Been doing trips to goodwill it doesn’t feel like its enough though, I still have some stuff in my parents house that we don’t have room for because we don’t have a garage to hold a fake christmas tree. 

I don’t want to become a hoarder, I like seeing my kitchen counters cleaned up, empty, just minimal items like coffee maker, mixer, currently have a dish rack with clean dishes & reusable ziplock, trying to figure out where to put them. 

Basically, am I being excessive with decluttering? I don’t want to keep too much around, I don’t want to live like a slob, I want organization, I want neatness. We’re slowly getting there with getting containers to put our boxes of noodles in and such. 

Backstory: my grandma was a hoarder, we cleaned her house when she went into assisted living. 4 years and 16 dumpsters. My parents collect stuff, their kitchen has junk everywhere and every time I see it, it will get on my nerves. 

Any advice is welcome! 


I’m always up to donating to Goodwill, the less stuff we have the better I feel.

1gdoq5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1gdoq5p/issues_with_new_delonghi_magnifica_evo/,Issues with new delonghi magnifica evo ,"Hello! I just purchased my first super automatic machine, a delonghi magnifica evo, and I’m having issues with it that I’m trying to figure out. We received it early last week and started using it a couple days after it arrived. The machine worked well the first few days, but it started having issues this morning. I’m not sure if it’s user error or something else. My husband was making coffee this morning and got an error message(the triangle with the exclamation mark in it). We cleaned the infuser and also changed the grind in an attempt to make it work, but the machine keeps trying to make a cup of coffee without actually producing much. There’s barely any coffee coming out, and the pucks were basically just wet grounds immersed in a pool of water. I tried the pre ground option, and that worked fine, so I’m thinking it’s an issue with the grinder. 

We did switch to new coffee beans this morning, but it seems odd that the machine is so finicky that switching to new beans would cause such an issue. I changed grind settings but nothing has helped. I will mention that we prefer dark roast coffee, so that’s the kind of beans we’re using. I just read some posts that said not to use dark roast beans because they’re too oily, but nothing in the delonghi manual said not to use dark roast beans or oily beans. The beans we used the first couple of days were also dark roast. Is it possible that the beans would have rendered the machine inoperable within three days of use? If that’s the case, maybe a super automatic machine isn’t the right option for us. I can’t imagine having a machine this finicky as my every day coffee maker. I chose this coffee maker to make my morning coffee routine LESS involved, not more involved.

I sent a support request to delonghi and plan to follow up tomorrow. In the meantime, I would love to hear from other magnifica evo owners about your experiences with the machine. Is it really this finicky? Am I doing something wrong? Do you use dark roast beans with your machine? Any general suggestions? I have been wanting one of these machines for so long and I’ll be disappointed if it’s not going to work for us, but I also don’t want to keep a machine I spent $550 on if it’s not going to work for our needs, and that includes the ability to use dark roast beans.

When Covid happened I realized that I was the planner of every friend group I have as well as both sides of my family and I started to feel bad about the extreme lack of effort anyone close to me put into planning things. When everything started opening back up a year or so into Covid, my partner and I would plan things just the two of us and if I posted a picture on social media, I would get a ton of messages either sarcastically saying “hey thanks for the invite!” Or “that looks fun, invite us next time!”

 I had a lot of conversations with both friends and family members about how I felt hurt that they literally never planned things with me but they always expected an invite, and the overwhelming response was that they don’t have the time/energy to plan things but are always happy to get an invite and will always make the effort to attend whatever I invite them too. But that really bothers me! I’m not asking for them to plan elaborate things for us to do together; I truly would appreciate a “want to meet for coffee this weekend?” text. Consistently planning and coordinating events can be a huge mental load and my partner and I have gotten in the habit of just planning things for the two of us and not inviting people, but I’m torn between enjoying the ease of it but ultimately wishing that I had the kind of friends that would plan things they want to do with us.

1gdoi7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gdoi7p/how_likely_are_vague_urinary_symptoms_to_be/,How likely are vague urinary symptoms to be anxiety-related?,"*Note: I already have an appointment with my PCP, but it's two weeks out, and I'm trying to get in a better headspace ahead of time.*

Age: 40 year old male

Smoke? No

Drink? Yes, \~10 drinks per week, but no recent changes in habit.

Medications: None

Primary complaint: About two weeks ago I had a 5-day stretch filled with lots of masturbation and sex (all with my wife). After ejaculating about 6 times in 4 days (more than normal for me, although not a personal record), I noticed that I'd have frequent urination, and especially an ""awareness"" of my urethra and some tingling sensations that almost felt like ""hot"" urine stuck in the tip. I have experienced this before on sporadic occasions after ejaculation so didn't think much of it. Historically it usually cleared up within the hour. However, it never subsided this time - I would find myself constantly focusing on whether I had to pee, and I'd often find some type of sensation as quickly as 10-20 minutes after peeing before. If I tried to pee, I could often get some leftovers out, but it usually wasn't much. When having a bowel movement, if I strained, I would often shoot out a quick burst or two or urine along with it. This is not unusual for me, although it did burn, which *is* unusual for me. Normal urination did not burn, only this.

After a week of dealing with this, I went to urgent care and they gave me antibiotics for a UTI, although both the lab test and urine culture came back negative for a UTI. A prostate exam also found nothing abnormal. I got sent on my way and told to follow up w/ PCP if problems persisted. My A1C is normal. No other changes in my behavior or symptoms outside of this. No STIs.

I decided to stop any kind of ejaculation for 4ish days, and I did notice things getting better. I had 1 or 2 days where I barely thought about whether I had any urethral sensations of needing to urinate. I noticed myself starting to fear the idea of ejaculation and decided to masturbate as a bit of a science experiment, and shortly thereafter, I found myself dealing with urethral sensations again. What I can't pin down is whether that's just my anxiety messing with me.

Some important background: I struggle with health anxiety. I mostly got it under control a few years ago after health anxiety caused me to chronically hyperventilate for about 3 weeks, but I definitely have a history of getting carried away in my head to the point of physical symptoms. At this point I'm terrified that it's turning into a long-term issue, and that fear feels like it could be feeding back into prolonging these symptoms.

I made the mistake of reading the sub-reddits for pelvic floor dysfunction and interstitial cystitis, and I'm now terrified that this sensation is going to bother me for the rest of my life. At the same time, the rational part of my brain is having a hard time believing this would just happen out of nowhere - I have had zero issues previously masturbating every day since I was a teenager and I have no pain in my pelvic region and no pain or issues with sex. That's why I'm asking here and not there.

So my question is: For docs who have experience with this type of case, how often *do* people just suddenly end up with pelvic floor injuries or interstitial cystitis vs. how often do these issues just go away after awhile?

Edit for other pertinent info: I'm not convinced I'm actually peeing significantly more often, it's just the sensations between peeing that are bothering me. For the past week, I've peed between 6 and 10 times every day, which is not unusual for me as I do drink a fair amount of water and coffee (and always have). Typically 1-5 hours between peeing, although during some episodes I would occasionally go 2-3 times in an hour, although on those circumstances it was always very small after the first one (which is definitely unusual for me).",0,1730072272.0,AskDocs,1,0.5,False

Have had long term problems with feeling cherished since the very beginning of our dating, which, after a breakup in 2017 and 2020 and dozens of multi-day fights later, I felt were starting to get ironed out especially as he grew up. But his self-centered nature and jerkiness still rears its ugly head here and there. Last Thursday I woke up early to clean the house because my mom and her husband were coming on Friday and I worried I would run out of time Thursday night to clean. My husband has two full time software engineering jobs that he does remotely, and he rarely has time to help around the house. Him not having much time to help has long been a source of contention for us but since our wedding 5 months ago I have really leaned into somewhat of a traditional wife role and taken on about 90% of cleaning, cooking, and shopping duties, and he pays for a good chunk of rent and other bills. Keep in mind I also work full time as a scientist but make 10x less salary than him as I only have 1 full time job and I’m in academia which doesn’t pay much.

Over the last 5-8 months I have been inspired to clean up for him and after him more and have started justifying it because he does bring in 10x more $ than me and I have been trying to “honor my husband” which sounds old-fashioned but I really wasn’t minding it because I just want peace and calm, and things are more stressful when I rely on him to do chores because I often have to remind, followup, instruct, or otherwise wait for him to have time follow through on his promises to clean up. I have stopped my nagging and focused on my gratitude for his hard work at his two jobs! I have been working so hard before and after my own full time job work and on weekends to make our home warm, inviting, clean, organized, decorated, all of it. His mother stayed with us recently and was gushing over how nice and inviting the place was so I would say I am succeeding.

I think he couldn’t care less though?

So his desk for remote work used to be in our living room, and has lots of clutter on it for months, which he cleaned for a recent party by moving his desk clutter to the guest bedroom desk out of sight. Then after the party he started using his actual desk downstairs in the basement which was cleared off. This weekend my mom was coming to visit so I wanted to clean the guest room, wipe things down, declutter, etc. Thursday morning I had woken up early to get some cleaning done before heading into work. As I was finishing up around 9am I moved his things on the guest bedroom desk to his basement desk, where he had already begun his work. I brought the items to him since they were his desk items (a couple chargers and a light). I had also just brought him his coffee and his daily vitamins as I usually do and he thanked me. I started bringing down some of his chargers and other random desk items to set them somewhere on his basement deak. I was trying to help, not bother him, didn’t say a word to him, just came to drop off his things at his desk and he says to me “don’t clutter my desk I want to keep it clean” and I’m like “oh okay but I’m trying to clean the guest room now before my mom comes and these things were on it” he says “I don’t want clutter on my desk, it is 9am which is work time for me, don’t come down here anymore and distract me. I will move my stuff later.” I was simply trying to help and clean and get stuff done in the little bit of free time I had before going to work myself. He often says he will do things later, then gets busy and forgets or does it at the last minute. So I simply wanted to just take care of it. His work is not that confidential in that I can’t see it over his shoulder, and he was not on a call or anything when I came down, just didn’t want to be distracted by my presence bringing him his few belongings.

I felt really hurt by him dismissing my efforts so much and trying to control the progress I was making on cleaning our guest bedroom. I told him I was upset and why and tried to get him to admit he was an ass to me in that moment as I was just trying to get things done in preparation for my mom to come. He says “you need to get it through your head that me working uninterrupted is more important than any cleaning schedule you may have” it was such a slap in the face and demeaning and so icky. I’m confused too because he happily accepts the water, coffee, breakfast/lunch, or goodbye kiss I give him before I leave for work, so this seemed more about a power trip than anything. He won’t admit he was an ass, he thinks he is entitled to snapping at me for “cluttering his desk” and I’m self centered for wanting to clean the house on my own schedule. 

After all my efforts to be a sweet, kind, helpful wife with a clean and organized home, he has the nerve to accuse my efforts of cleaning up HIS belongings as “distracting” and to yell at me to not come back downstairs again, to the point where I felt anxious and on edge about entering a room in my own house. It feels like my sheer presence gets on his nerves. This is my reward for being so intentional about my wifely duties. I feel like a moron. This isn’t the only example of him being an unappreciative dick too just the most recent one.

 I wanted to have kids soon but I feel with such a self centered man on his high horse about how “work that is so much more important than my cleaning schedule” that I supposedly can’t even walk behind him to bring him his belongings that were cluttering another space without him snapping at me. I feel lower than a coworker he doesn’t like, as he would have at least been polite enough to say thank you to them.

This is just clear evidence that we not a team. The only explanation I can think of is that I am annoying to him. All I can do right now is cry and wish for a partner who loves me, doesn’t mind my presence, treats me with kindness and patience and shows THANKS for small actions like bringing him his belongings as I am cleaning up. I feel I need to cut my losses now before I bring children into the picture which I wanted very soon.

Some other details are he left 90% of the wedding planning to me, I had a miserable time with that too. He never gives me romantic thoughtful gifts - only flowers on special occasions with reminders. Only in the last few years has he started getting me Christmas gifts and stuff, like he got me a charging station for my Apple watch and Air pods. 

For our recent Halloween party I got so little help from him I had my coworkers come to help in the days prior and he was OK with my male coworker friend putting witch hats up near his desk while he sat there with his head phones on and worked (around 8pm after his work hours). I mean whatever OK if he is working so hard to pay for our lives and doesn’t have time to help as much that’s fine but he also wouldn’t stop complaining about how much money I was spending on it. Hosting is my pride and joy- it ended up being about $3k which included new decorations (that we can reuse in future years), new outdoor furniture, new sound systems, new party serve ware we can us, and disposable things. Also about $500 for food and drinks. But he makes over $500k and we have no kids and also he didn’t help with anything ahead of time except setting the sound system up and some day-of cleaning!! I’m just really frustrated I feel like his work and salary are everything to him and I can’t even reap the benefits of his hard work- at least not peacefully.

Sometimes I feel ungrateful and I should just keep my mouth shut because he pays for a lot of our living expenses and most of our wedding. But he is also a self centered dick fairly frequently whose work is apparently more important than my efforts to have a clean house before guests come over, so it is hard to balance! 

How can I balance his financial contribution towards our marriage with his lack of emotional support, appreciation, and kindness towards me?

I finally have a long awaited apt tomorrow with the gastroenterologist and I don’t know why i’m so nervous but if you wouldn’t mind taking some time to read my symptoms and maybe helping me know what to expect. Thank you in advance. I have had left sided abdominal pressure on and off for almost a year now. Sometimes its lower, by my pelvis and sometimes its like a gas bubble is stuck and rises all the way under my rib. Burping and farting do tend to help. I kinda thought it was gynecology related. Ruled out some things with them and got a ct scan done at the er to rule out some worries. Ct scan says “Bowel: Submucosal fatty deposits suggestive of prior episode of colitis. No definitive acute colitis found.” They suggested seeing a gastro so here I am as of tomorrow. I have researched alot. I do not have constipation, I do not have constant diarrhea. I do not have bowel urgency. I only poop maybe twice a day. Which has always been normal for me. If i do have diarrhea there is a reason for it, as in i know i ate like eggs or coffee or had some alcohol adventures the night before. These have all been nothing but normal my whole life. It doesnt hurt when i poop, i do not have blood in my stool atleast that i can see. My poop is a little more yellowish than normal, but other than that i have no symptoms common with ulcerative colitis or crohns disease. What should i be expecting? what should i ask the doc? I am at a loss. I dont want it brushed off as me being crazy or even just saying i have ibs because my symptoms dont match up with ibs either. Please weigh in. let me know what you think.

It has always gotten in the way of me truly connecting with people and forming stable relationships. I had never had a real relationship. About two months ago I had decided to download tinder again and felt I was ready to put myself out there and find someone. I matched with some people that I thought I had a connection with but soon got unmatched. My self esteem was at an all time low and I began to get very cynical. I decided I would treat this app as a joke and not put any effort into showing people my true self or my  desire for a real relationship. Completely changed my bio and treated every girl I matched with as an opportunity to have a joke at their expense.

Not long after that, I matched with her. We joked and had the same sense of humour and she almost instantly cracked the facade I had put up to avoid being hurt. But I was not expecting anything to come of it. Then she suggested a date. I thought to myself that I have nothing to Lose, so why not try? I actually drove all the way to a different city to meet her. 
I was terrified but she put me at ease, assuring me that while she was also nervous, it's natural for the first meeting to be like this. We went and got coffee and walked along the marina in her city and talked for 2 and a half hours. When I was going to leave I offered her a lift to the bus stop and that was that. I liked her but never expected to hear from her again.

 It's been a month now and we recently had our first ""sleep over"". We only get to see each other on weekends but we have a million things planned for months in advance. 

I never thought I could have something like this. This girl is kind,supportive, understanding of my issues with anxiety, and she  makes great efforts to help make me feel seen and comfortable in all social situations. She is also super into communicating her needs/desires and pushes me to express my own. It's all going really extremely well and I just wanted to share because I am proud of myself for finally pushing through that wall that has held me back from being happy for so many years.

Earlier this year, I purchased my first 1/3 doll, a 60cm tall aolingshi LYNN. I've had him for a couple months now, and I'm struggling with him. What I have learned is that 1/3s are too big for me and the way I like to collect, and I'm glad to know this about myself now.

I do however, really like my LYNN, but I'm kind of at a loss of what to do with him. My main issue is that I have many characters that he could be, but because all the characters exist in the same universe, he can't really be any of them, because everyone else would be so much smaller than him. This might be a trivial problem for some, but it really bothers me personally that he would make a 1/4 who is meant to be an adult look like a child next to him. And because I won't be collecting any more of his size, at least not anytime soon, he will be a loner.

I generally would like some thoughts and ideas about what I could do with him. I really don't want to sell him, I like him a lot, and making clothes for him was quite fun! But I'm not sure how to fit him into my collection in a way where he would be well loved. I could just make him a brand new character, but the problem with that is that I would make him a backstory and then I would want him to have friends, a partner, or family, yada yada.... So that would just start the whole mess over again haha.

Has anyone else ever felt this way? Did you find any solutions? Any ideas are welcome. I don't want him to sit unloved on my coffee table, and I would rather not sell him",1,1730071044.0,BJD,5,0.6,False

A lot of my girlfriends are tired of telling me to distance myself from him so I don't mention him anymore. And if my girlfriends told me about a guy they know who’s like him, I’d tell them to ignore him. 

My family has known his for decades and we live close to each other, but he works out of town so the only time when he's back in the area is on weekends.

He's been romantically interested in me ever since we were kids, but I've never liked him in that way. He has always been persistent and stalker-like, especially back in high school. Over time we did become friends and my parents pushed me to be kind to him because we were pretty much the only minorities in our neighborhood.

Over the years, he's worked hard and done better for himself than I frankly expected. But I find myself tolerating him less and less because as he's started to make his own money (i.e., getting his own Brooklyn apartment) he's also become condescending and rude (now saying things to me such as he's attractive when I personally find him to be ugly as well as interrupting me - he used to never do this before).

Two months ago, he said a friend of his + his wife bought a townhouse downtown (it's not far - just a 10 mile drive) and wanted me to attend the housewarming with him. He even went so far as to have his mother mention it to mine. I was reluctant to RSVP because I'm still dealing with a chronic foot injury and 1) don't want to take public transit, and 2) he dislikes driving which is why he was so adamant about moving to NYC.
Even so, he said he's OK with driving so I eventually agreed to attend it with him even though I have never met these friends of his.The two days before the housewarming, he texted me many times to ask me 1) what time I was available to be picked up, 2) if I was OK with there being cats/dogs and if not, that I should wear a mask (I have a minor dander allergy), and 3) if I wanted to grab food beforehand at the Starbucks near our parents' houses.
I responded that I'd prefer we go out to eat downtown since we'd already be there? 
The morning of the housewarming, he texted me and said, ""On second thought, I'm just going to go to this housewarming alone. We can still meet at Starbucks for brunch if you want.""^I was FLABBERGASTED by this. I'd allocated 3-4 hours for this outing and then he switched up on me the morning of and just wants to grab a coffee?Later in the day, he sent me a photo of the ""housewarming"", which turned out to be him, his friend + his friend's wife, and a mystery woman. I was led to believe there would be way more guests than just 2? I'm not going to automatically assume that this mystery woman turned out to be my replacement because she could just be their friend, but I have a feeling that he decided to disinvite me because he didn't want to drive downtown (to accommodate my foot injury) or be seen with a cripple.

1gdnvk7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gdnvk7,Don’t know if this helps anyone! Also forgot not to look over the top. But here are mine. ,"Bubbles: These are generally a good sign. Many small bubbles mean the limpia was successful and you had spiritual assistance from positive entities. Bigger bubbles represent gossip and individuals keeping an eye on you — not necessarily doing evil eye, but they are invested in you for whatever reason.

Strings: Yolk strings hang from the top of the surface of the water down. They can connect directly back to the yolk and egg whites or stop midway. These are karmic chords with people that need to be cut. They also represent things or subjects you are worried about.

Cloudiness: If there is cloudiness over the yolk, sort of like a gray color, this is important. This is connected to physical symptoms if you have any. It can represent mental fog, confusion, fatigue, headaches, and physical ailments. These all need your focus, and you can expect these symptoms to get better. You must also look into these things on your end to alleviate further.

Spikes: These will spike up directly from the yolk. They can be short or tall and reach halfway up. Remember, these will not connect directly to the surface of the water, as those are strings. They represent gossip and blockages that need to be removed.

Cages: These are around the yolk on the side. They're big in size and usually oval shaped. These represent entrapment and feeling stuck or trapped by things and people. You're consumed by others or a particular situation. Free yourself.

An Eye: Seeing the shape of an eye directly in the center of your yolk is a big red flag. This is a huge concern and should be taken seriously. This could represent a literal evil eye and be a clear sign that someone has put the mal de ojo on you. If this is the case, you'll want to connect with a brujx or curanderx to help you with the situation further.

Figures: Look for figures or symbols in the egg yolk. These can also tell you about people who are energetically bullying you. Think of it like using coffee grounds or tea leaves to read, or like candle-wax readings. This is another way to use your third eye to better read the results and see what is spiritually coming through.

^I was FLABBERGASTED. I'd allocated 3-4 hours for this outing and then he switched up on me the morning of and just wants to grab a coffee?
Later in the day, he sent me a photo of the ""housewarming"", which turned out to be him, his friend & his wife, and a mystery woman at a restaurant. I don’t want to jump to conclusions, but it feels like a double date? I also feel like he decided to disinvite me because he didn't want to drive downtown (to accommodate my foot injury) or be seen with a cripple.

Tldr; AITA for giving the guy the silent treatment after he disinvited me from a housewarming? My parents think that I'm being harsh and that him disinviting me was probably not done out of malice. I think that it's a sign that he doesn’t respect me.",13,1730070408.0,AmItheAsshole,36,0.84,False

1gdntg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/1gdntg8/looking_for_room_in_brooklyn_ready_to_move_asap/,"Looking for room in brooklyn, ready to move ASAP","Hi all. 39M, gay, professional RN. I'm looking for a room in brooklyn, mostly willaiamsburg/bedstuy/Bushwick. I'm also open to other neighborhoods but I'd like to stick near these areas. I have a max budget $1800 before utilities. I have a couch, large screen TV, and coffee table for shared living space but I could sell or give it away if we don't need or can't fit in apartment. 

I usually work 3shifts 12 hrs long, usually night shift. So often times I might be awake at 3am and sleeping at 1pm. I have a very irregular sleep schedule. I'm pretty friendly and quiet, though a little shy and introverted. I'm trying to work on it so I'll be looking to make new friends and going to bars atleast weekly. Im very respectful and considerate so I don't usually bring the party home. My hobbies are reading scifi/fantasy books, anime, and video games. Im pretty neat, I wash as I cook, don't leave plates on the table, or leave leftovers out. 

Well behaved pets are OK. I would prefer a roommate(s) who are also sociable and willing to eat out, get drinks, or explore the city on occasion. I do require that the roommate be LGBT friendly, or at the very least not homophobic. Preferably no couples. Former smoker and it doesn't bother me either way if you smoke but no indoor smokers please. 420 friendly. I don't like to smoke cuz it burns, but I enjoy an edible to help me sleep. 

I'm ready to move ASAP, preferably before Nov 11 (when my current lease ends). Though I can wait for a few weeks more.

If you think we might be a good match send me a DM or write a message here. ",2,1730070285.0,NYCapartments,0,0.75,False

Hello y'all! 

finally have time off from work, thus here I am looking to meet new people! I'm from Texas but am ethnically Indian! 

I absolutely love to cook and find food from different cultures! Loves to try new coffee places! Currently works in the hospitality sector, catching stray angry people everyday lmao! 

Most of my day apart from work goes into working out, gardening and playing video games! Currently playing Spiderman and val! I absolutely love cats and have memes saved for every situation hahaha! My music taste is so random, it varies from Korean music to jazz at night! 

Guilty pleasures include eating a tub of hazelnut ice cream and watching kdramas on cheat days! I am patient and a very good listener, so if ya wanna rant, ears are always open! 

All I ask for you to be is kind and communicative! If you feel like we can vibe, hmu!  ",1,1730069880.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

1gdnllg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gdnllg,Portfolio projects ,"Hey all. 

I graduated over the summer with a bachelor of fine arts with a specialization in graphic design and am currently working at my schools university relations team that was a part of my required internship to graduate. However, I am trying to apply for actual full time work since I am only contracted to work until December. I am really interested in more publishing and editorial work. 

There is a job I plan on applying to this week for specific “book cover” work. My portfolio has a broad set of projects due to just being out of school. 

My question is; would an employer be interested or care to see smaller personal projects that might be more concept-oriented than finished work? Because if so, I figure I can take a day or so to do a few small designs. For instance, I made a small coffee table book concept with my friends photography the other day to practice some skills, shared here, would that maybe be a good thing to put into a section in my portfolio?
