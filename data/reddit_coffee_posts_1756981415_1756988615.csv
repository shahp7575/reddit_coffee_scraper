He is an African wild dog at the moment but I was thinking of changing him into a bat or moth. The specific type of bat or moth i don't know yet, but I want some more ideas of what species I could do from ypu guys, :D.

Viktor does have some bones showing and he has some piercings in his current design and I want to keep that in however I'm not too sure if I want to keep his like coffee brown and moss green colouration or not yet.

Thank you in advance for any species suggestions.

We will remain independent. Our focus is Dia.

>I’ve written and rewritten this post more times than I’d like to admit, but what I keep coming back to is simple: the work continues, and we’re grateful for this moment.

>The work continues because when I stop by the coffee shop near our office, nobody is using Dia yet. Our “internet computer” vision hasn’t been realized. Dia hasn’t yet changed how you work on a Tuesday morning. This deal is about giving us the resources, distribution, and monetization muscle to get there.

>At the same time, it feels disingenuous not to pause and briefly celebrate this milestone. It reflects our team’s craftsmanship and relentlessness, the support of our coaches, board members, and advisors, and the incredible effort from our deal team: Ryan Purcell from Gunderson, Nancy Peretsman and Leah Schwartz from Allen & Co., and Clare, Abby, Eissra, Rebecca, Cory, Nash, and Hursh from The Browser Company.

>Most of all, we’re grateful for what this means for Dia. It means we can hire faster, ship faster, and bring Dia to more people. We can now invest in cross-platform support and secure syncing, train custom AI models designed specifically for Dia, and turn ambitious ideas about “computer use” and “memory” into reality.

>To everyone who’s filed a bug, sent feedback, or shared a kind word: thank you. We haven’t always gotten it right, but we’ve always cared deeply. That will never change.

>Dia isn’t going anywhere. We’ll be here for the long haul, with the same team just a new partner helping us push further. We’ll take a breath this weekend, and then get back to work. Big launch next month.

Personally I have done it and I would say it was the most spiritual and mind-blowing experience of my entire life till now. Along the lines of what Steve jobs said about psychedelics as ""one of the few important things he had done In his life"". I have never seen a single trip report or even a person telling me that they want to quit doing it or never liked or enjoyed it. Is it mostly the misconception about it?

Few things you should know about drugs before judging something.

Mainly few categories like
Opioids: painkillers which act on opioid receptors which is highly nd highly addictive.

Cannabis : acts on cannabinoid receptors which is also addictive but not as much as hard drugs

Psychedelic (magic mushrooms/lsd/dmt): alters perception and induce hallucinations in a very beautiful and mind-blowing way if your set and setting is good

Now Comparing mushrooms to opioids is like saying coffee is the same as alcohol - they both change how we feel, but they act on completely different systems in the brain.”

Shrooms don't cause physical dependence like opiods or hard drugs. They are not in the same recreational/relaxant category as weed either. They have been used in many cultures for spiritual and therapeutic reasons, not as ""party drugs"".

Our body doesn't develop any withdrawal for it ...just pure science ..In fact, science is studying them as treatments for addiction, because they work on a totally different brain system.

Important: I'm neither emphasizing that shrooms can be taken lightly nor it should be taken as an experiment. I'm just saying not every illegal thing is harmful to you or fellow humans. Government or authority doesn't give two flying fucks about you and your health. Shit like tobacco and alcohol are legal but science backed psilocybin (magic mushrooms are illegal). Quite a funny world we live in. If you don't trust me- search about it a bit and see any comment section of magic mushrooms video in YouTube for real nd honest opinions and how it changed their life downside up.

I’m the founder of an early-stage HR startup from Italy.

**This October/November** I’d love to make a small dream come true: spending **7–10 days in San Francisco** to experience the startup ecosystem in the Bay Area. I’ve always been fascinated by it, and I think it could be super inspiring.

I’d like to check out some iconic startup-related places (incubators, coworking spaces, Apple Park, ...) and get a better sense of the local lifestyle.  
So I’m looking for some advice:

* Where’s the best place to **stay**? Should I rent a car or is public transport good enough?
* Any **must-see spots** for someone passionate about startups?
* And would anyone local be up for showing me around or just grabbing a coffee together? Or do you know someone that would?

Long-term, my dream would be to move to the US, but for now I just want to start with this trip and soak up as much energy as possible.

YOU ARE EXCITED TO START SELLING DIGITAL PRODUCTS ALREADY

BUT

01 You don't know how to pick a profitable niche or a product idea that would actually work.

02 You don't know how to set up the tech or deliver your digital product to your customers.

03 You don't have an audience and have no idea how to market your digital product on social media.

here's the thing though..

You don't need to be an expert to start selling digital products.

All you need is an idea for a product, a platform to host your product and a strategy to sell.

One $30 product sale a day can make you an extra $10,950 a year.

Whether you wanna make an extra $1000 a month or do this full-time, it all starts with you taking the decision to start today.

This is exactly how I went from zero to over $100,000/month in profit in just 3.5 years.

And no I didn't have a large social media following or a large budget to invest in ads when I first started out.

I started out with $400 that I could invest in my side-hustle and a willingness to build a different life for me - no matter what it took.

Fast forward to today, I work 1-2 hours per day from wherever I want and get to spend my life on my own terms.

Even tried Starbucks, Kenya roast and Indian special blend., Sumatra and Italian dark roast. Till now I loved Kenya roast among all. So I am still exploring and please suggest which one will be best to get from US.

I'm learning German and came across a bit of a nuance I find tricky. In English, we can say things like:

* ""I prefer coffee.""
* ""I prefer metal music.""

In German, I know about **„lieber“**, but it seems more complicated. Often, you have to:

1. Choose the right verb.
2. Decide where to place **„lieber“** in the sentence.
3. Handle separable prefixes if the verb has them.

For example:  
**„Ich stehe morgens lieber früh auf.“** – here, “aufstehen” is separable, so “auf” goes to the end, and “lieber” goes before “früh.”

So my question is: **Is there a more direct, simple equivalent of ""prefer"" in German**, something I could just use in front of a noun or verb without all the extra sentence gymnastics?

For example, how would you say simply:  
**""I prefer coffee""** – without having to restructure the sentence or think about separable verbs?

I also smoked cigarettes and then switched to vaping nicotine so the two (nicotine + caffeine) pretty much go hand in hand.

Since then I've quit nicotine completely (probably has been maybe 4 or 5 months since quitting?, unsure). I also really cut down my caffeine when initially quitting, I think I probably went caffeine free for maybe around a week.

I was wondering if this subreddit generally advocates for nearly everyone to go completely caffeine free, or if that's only advocated for people who seem to have problems with even small amounts of caffeine.

I guess I'm asking because, during my quitting nicotine and cutting back on caffeine, i've since switched to green tea, which I still know has caffeine, but likely a lot less than the coffee I was drinking, especially considering I was using a drip pot coffee maker and would add way more coffee grounds than necessary.

Another reason I've tried to cut down on caffeine is that I've been exercising and trying to lose weight, and I know a big part of losing weight is getting a good sleep, so I've been trying not to overdo it while still indulging in green tea.

I guess I just don't really feel like I have that much of a problem with caffeine anymore, but wondering if I'm just evaluating my relationship with caffeine compared to how bad it was before.

So I guess I was wondering does this sub advocate

1. nearly everyone go completely caffeine free?

2. only those with problems with caffeine go caffeine free?

3. Not advocate anything it's just a place for people to talk about their experiences quitting/cutting back on caffeine and getting support when trying to do so?",1,1756987108.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

# Chapter 2 - The Horror Head & The Desk Jockey

The townhouse smelled of coffee. Dale sat in the living room while I poured myself a cup. Being the good hostess I had been trained to be growing up, I offered Dale the first cup of coffee, the one with the fucked up collage of Japanese horror I had gotten out earlier. Dale took the mug and thanked me, although his body language seemed to show a distaste towards the artwork on the mug. I did not offer to take it back, nor did he ask for another cup. He was probably just trying to be polite, to not insult the weird horror girl’s taste in coffee cups. I won’t lie that I took a small pleasure in seeing him cringe at the cup. A petty revenge for all the time he had spent spying on me.

I poured myself another mug. The logo of the community college where I taught night classes on the art of fear in story and the history of horror. A class so niche that after just three semesters, the writing was on the wall and the dean scrapped it during winter break. The closest thing I had to a “real job” in my parents’ eyes, even if it didn’t support me financially enough to be out of their fiscal orbit yet. Once those classes inevitably went away, I went back to my previous work of writing movie reviews for niche websites and spending too much time posting on fan forums. I just told my parents’ that I was unemployed. It was easier that way, and with the small penitence I got from writing those reviews, I was functionally jobless anyway.

Dale sat on the couch. His fingers tapping away at the coffee mug’s handle. Looking contemplatively at the coffee table. Around him, the walls were adorned in framed movie posters of some of my favorites. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (the original nineteen seventies version), Ringu (the original Japanese version), Susperia (You guessed it, the original Italian edition), and The Thing (the John Carpenter Remake). The wall mounted TV remained off, my bookshelves of Blu-ray’s sat filled on either side. The only sound that filled the room was the ticking of the grandfather clock on the wall across from the base of the staircase.

“You know I don’t normally let strange men into my house,” I said, sitting on the love seat across from the couch, placing my coffee cup down. “Especially men who spied on me. But I’ll make the exception for a man who seems to be trapped in the same horror movie as me.”

“Thanks?” Dale asked, looking at me. He took a sip of his coffee, deliberately looking away from the mug as he did so. “And you know that this isn’t a movie, right?”

“Yeah, I know,” I said. “You still have to admit that it’s a little exciting, at least. Well, for me that is. I’m sure that your life at the FBI is always exciting.”

Dale shook his head. “I’m just a desk jockey. Nothing exciting in it.”

“A desk jockey that spies?”

He looked towards the front door as if he was about to say something that would draw unwanted attention. “I work in the Real Time Web Analysis division. My job is to monitor any device hooked up to the internet that is actively being used by the suspect. I don’t even work in the Elevated Threats division, just Persons of Interest. Although internally we just call it ‘Just Keeping Tabs.’ We aren’t even close to James Bond.”

“How long have you been keeping tabs on me, then?” I asked.

“About six months,” he said, taking another sip but avoiding eye contact.

“Why? I haven’t done anything illegal.”

He nodded. “You’re right; you haven’t.”

“Then why?” I asked.

“We have a red-flag system. Whenever any device connected to the internet downloads a certain piece of software or goes to any suspicious site, we keep track of them for certain periods of time. Sometimes it’s just a few days, others, weeks, and sometimes months. No more than six months, though. Unless raised to Elevated Threats, and that’s a whole other division. Luckily for you, you’re no elevated threat, but you watch some messed up stuff.”

“They’re just horror movies,” I said, gesturing at my collection of Blu-ray’s and posters. “Excuse me for having a hobby.”

“More of a lifestyle for you,” Dale said.

I didn’t respond. He wasn’t wrong.

“So why me? Does the FBI have a database on all horror fans or what?”

He shook his head. “Your TOR browser.” He said.

“Fucking Mike,” I said beneath my breath. It was one thing for him to curse me by sharing that video, it was a whole other thing for him to convince me to download something I never used just in case he dug up something truly horrifying on the dark web that would give either of us legitimate goosebumps for once. And yet, the most fucked up thing he sent me was through an email attachment and not buried in the deep web. “You know that I never once opened that thing,” I said to Dale.

Dale nodded. “I know. Many people download it out of curiosity but are too scared to do anything with it. But we put them in a six months watch just to be safe.”

“You said that it’s been six months. Why are you still watching me, then?”

“I said about six months. Technically, I’ve been keeping tabs on you for five months and twenty-seven days. You are three days away from being taken off the watchlist.”

I chuckled at the absurdity of all of this. It almost didn’t seem real. Like a dream that my mind had become too invested in, and never wanted to wake up, no matter how fucked up it was. I have had plenty of dreams like that. Dreams that felt like lifetimes of interesting stories I lived out, only to wake up in disappointed that the real world still waited for me on the other side of the night.

“What?” Dale said.

“I just can’t believe how ridiculous this situation is,” I said, letting out another chuckle and shaking my head. “Who would have thought that not only do Ringu-esque cursed videos actually exist, but my personal FBI agent would watch it along with me?”

“This isn’t funny,” Dale said. Not with any sort of affliction of anger or annoyance in his voice, but one of remorse and maybe a little shame.

I stopped laughing.

“You might be amused by all of this, but I’m not,” he continued. “I couldn’t sleep all night. After you watched that video and went to bed, I went to the break room, to decompress. And when I opened up YouTube to unwind, all I saw was that same video over and over again. I asked a coworker of mine in Elevated Threats to verify what was on the screen, and you know what he saw? The stupid video I was trying to watch. Which I couldn’t see. I couldn’t sleep. I couldn’t go home. I needed to get to the bottom of this, to see if you knew anything about it. I even risked my job stealing this thing off my coworker’s desk to find you. Only those in Elevated Threats are even allowed to use these.” He produced a small device from his jacket pocket. From an outsider’s point of view, i.e. mine, it looked like an old BlackBerry phone with its tiny keyboard and monochrome LCD display, but with a large thick, finger-length protrusion coming out of the top and a USB dongle hanging from the bottom.

“What’s that?” I asked.

In a moment of hesitation, like a child who had been caught with something he wasn’t supposed to have, he shoved it back into his pocket. “It’s nothing. Just something that helped me find you.” He said.

“You can’t just hold out a piece of top secret tech and pretend it’s nothing.” I said.

“Look,” he said, looking me in the eye. The way he did it, the way his face did not point directly towards me, but slightly off angle told me that this was something he was not used to doing. “What I’m trying to say is that I risked my job and my family’s wellbeing to get to you in order to break this stupid curse you gave me.”

“I didn’t give it to you,” I said, holding my gaze. Showing him how it’s really done. “You spied on me. You had every right to not watch me.”

“It’s not spying. I was just keeping tabs. There’s a difference. Elevated Threats do the real spy work. I’m just a grunt. And it’s not like I had a choice to watch you. You were assigned to me. I have a job to do, and a family to feed. Not everybody is like you Eleanor, not everybody has the financial support from their parents to keep them afloat while they attempt to carve out a career path that doesn’t exist.” He didn’t raise his voice the entire time, but something about the normal inside voice of his made it feel even more real. My parents had been beating around the bush for years with their semi-faux support, and I learned to not take their words personally. But to hear a man who had been watching me for so long without me even knowing he was doing so say it, that one hurt.

“I’m sorry,” Dale said, looking away. “I didn’t mean that.” He sighed. “What I meant is that I have a family. I’m a father of three and my wife homeschools. I work odd and long hours and I can’t have any sort of whatever this is in my life. This might be exciting for you, but it’s not for me. All I wanted was to be at my oldest son’s soccer game this morning.”

Dale’s phone rang, as if on queue. “Excuse me, I need to take this,” he said. He picked it up.

“Hey honey, how’s it going?” He asked. His voice was brighter as he spoke into the mic. I couldn’t make out any words from the person on the other side.

“Didn’t you get my message? I sent you a text that I needed to work overtime this week.” He paused. “Uh huh. I don’t know how long it’ll be. Hopefully, just a few days. They’re letting me sleep in the training bunks, at least.” His face winced a little at that statement. Like he had tasted something bitter. “Tell Jason that I’m rooting for him to win!” He paused a little. “I’m sorry about the minivan. If I knew about this, I would have left it with you. I’m sure that the Civic has enough life in it to get you and the kids to the game. Tell Jason he can ride in the front. He should be big enough now.” He paused. “Oh, you’re already there?” Dale checked his watch, realizing the time. “I’m sorry, hun. I lost track of time. Haven’t slept all night thanks to work,” he said, looking at me. “Sure, FaceTime me the kickoff. I’ll be on mute and have my video turned off. You know how it is around here. Alright, thank you. I’ll check in with you during my breaks. Love you, and tell the kids that dad’ll be back in a few days. Mwah,” he said into the mic, late, after the hang up tone played. That I could hear.

“Your wife?” I asked.

Dale nodded. His phone vibrated. He opened it with eager.

I could not see what he saw initially. His phone angled away from me. But I saw his face. The momentary burst of joy sunk into an expression of deep horror, the kinds of horror reserved for watching a love one die unexpectedly. The phone slipped from his grasp and hit the coffee table, tumbling towards the center. When it stopped, I could make out the contents of the screen.

“I thought it only affected what had been recorded, not live video,” Dale said. His voice trembled.

On the screen, instead of a live feed of a pee-wee soccer game, was the same video that had plagued the two of us. Those thirty seconds of familiar horror played on repeat during the whole broadcast while Dale moaned, gripping at his hair with his free hand. I reached over to Dale and patted him on the knee. “We’ll get to the bottom of this,” I said. What I didn’t show was my eagerness to get this adventure going. If his knock on the door was the inciting incident, then this was our call to action.

“So why me? Does the FBI have a database on all horror fans or what?”

He shook his head. “Your TOR browser.” He said.

“Fucking Mike,” I said beneath my breath. It was one thing for him to curse me by sharing that video, it was a whole other thing for him to convince me to download something I never used just in case he dug up something truly horrifying on the dark web that would give either of us legitimate goosebumps for once. And yet, the most fucked up thing he sent me was through an email attachment and not buried in the deep web. “You know that I never once opened that thing,” I said to Dale.

Dale nodded. “I know. Many people download it out of curiosity but are too scared to do anything with it. But we put them in a six months watch just to be safe.”

“You said that it’s been six months. Why are you still watching me, then?”

“I said about six months. Technically, I’ve been keeping tabs on you for five months and twenty-seven days. You are three days away from being taken off the watchlist.”

I chuckled at the absurdity of all of this. It almost didn’t seem real. Like a dream that my mind had become too invested in, and never wanted to wake up, no matter how fucked up it was. I have had plenty of dreams like that. Dreams that felt like lifetimes of interesting stories I lived out, only to wake up in disappointed that the real world still waited for me on the other side of the night.

“What?” Dale said.

“I just can’t believe how ridiculous this situation is,” I said, letting out another chuckle and shaking my head. “Who would have thought that not only do Ringu-esque cursed videos actually exist, but my personal FBI agent would watch it along with me?”

“This isn’t funny,” Dale said. Not with any sort of affliction of anger or annoyance in his voice, but one of remorse and maybe a little shame.

I stopped laughing.

“You might be amused by all of this, but I’m not,” he continued. “I couldn’t sleep all night. After you watched that video and went to bed, I went to the break room, to decompress. And when I opened up YouTube to unwind, all I saw was that same video over and over again. I asked a coworker of mine in Elevated Threats to verify what was on the screen, and you know what he saw? The stupid video I was trying to watch. Which I couldn’t see. I couldn’t sleep. I couldn’t go home. I needed to get to the bottom of this, to see if you knew anything about it. I even risked my job stealing this thing off my coworker’s desk to find you. Only those in Elevated Threats are even allowed to use these.” He produced a small device from his jacket pocket. From an outsider’s point of view, i.e. mine, it looked like an old BlackBerry phone with its tiny keyboard and monochrome LCD display, but with a large thick, finger-length protrusion coming out of the top and a USB dongle hanging from the bottom.

“What’s that?” I asked.

In a moment of hesitation, like a child who had been caught with something he wasn’t supposed to have, he shoved it back into his pocket. “It’s nothing. Just something that helped me find you.” He said.

“You can’t just hold out a piece of top secret tech and pretend it’s nothing.” I said.

“Look,” he said, looking me in the eye. The way he did it, the way his face did not point directly towards me, but slightly off angle told me that this was something he was not used to doing. “What I’m trying to say is that I risked my job and my family’s wellbeing to get to you in order to break this stupid curse you gave me.”

“I didn’t give it to you,” I said, holding my gaze. Showing him how it’s really done. “You spied on me. You had every right to not watch me.”

“It’s not spying. I was just keeping tabs. There’s a difference. Elevated Threats do the real spy work. I’m just a grunt. And it’s not like I had a choice to watch you. You were assigned to me. I have a job to do, and a family to feed. Not everybody is like you Eleanor, not everybody has the financial support from their parents to keep them afloat while they attempt to carve out a career path that doesn’t exist.” He didn’t raise his voice the entire time, but something about the normal inside voice of his made it feel even more real. My parents had been beating around the bush for years with their semi-faux support, and I learned to not take their words personally. But to hear a man who had been watching me for so long without me even knowing he was doing so say it, that one hurt.

“I’m sorry,” Dale said, looking away. “I didn’t mean that.” He sighed. “What I meant is that I have a family. I’m a father of three and my wife homeschools. I work odd and long hours and I can’t have any sort of whatever this is in my life. This might be exciting for you, but it’s not for me. All I wanted was to be at my oldest son’s soccer game this morning.”

Dale’s phone rang, as if on queue. “Excuse me, I need to take this,” he said. He picked it up.

“Hey honey, how’s it going?” He asked. His voice was brighter as he spoke into the mic. I couldn’t make out any words from the person on the other side.

“Didn’t you get my message? I sent you a text that I needed to work overtime this week.” He paused. “Uh huh. I don’t know how long it’ll be. Hopefully, just a few days. They’re letting me sleep in the training bunks, at least.” His face winced a little at that statement. Like he had tasted something bitter. “Tell Jason that I’m rooting for him to win!” He paused a little. “I’m sorry about the minivan. If I knew about this, I would have left it with you. I’m sure that the Civic has enough life in it to get you and the kids to the game. Tell Jason he can ride in the front. He should be big enough now.” He paused. “Oh, you’re already there?” Dale checked his watch, realizing the time. “I’m sorry, hun. I lost track of time. Haven’t slept all night thanks to work,” he said, looking at me. “Sure, FaceTime me the kickoff. I’ll be on mute and have my video turned off. You know how it is around here. Alright, thank you. I’ll check in with you during my breaks. Love you, and tell the kids that dad’ll be back in a few days. Mwah,” he said into the mic, late, after the hang up tone played. That I could hear.

“Your wife?” I asked.

Dale nodded. His phone vibrated. He opened it with eager.

I could not see what he saw initially. His phone angled away from me. But I saw his face. The momentary burst of joy sunk into an expression of deep horror, the kinds of horror reserved for watching a love one die unexpectedly. The phone slipped from his grasp and hit the coffee table, tumbling towards the center. When it stopped, I could make out the contents of the screen.

“I thought it only affected what had been recorded, not live video,” Dale said. His voice trembled.

On the screen, instead of a live feed of a pee-wee soccer game, was the same video that had plagued the two of us. Those thirty seconds of familiar horror played on repeat during the whole broadcast while Dale moaned, gripping at his hair with his free hand. I reached over to Dale and patted him on the knee. “We’ll get to the bottom of this,” I said. What I didn’t show was my eagerness to get this adventure going. If his knock on the door was the inciting incident, then this was our call to action.

# Chapter 2 - The Horror Head & The Desk Jockey

The townhouse smelled of coffee. Dale sat in the living room while I poured myself a cup. Being the good hostess I had been trained to be growing up, I offered Dale the first cup of coffee, the one with the fucked up collage of Japanese horror I had gotten out earlier. Dale took the mug and thanked me, although his body language seemed to show a distaste towards the artwork on the mug. I did not offer to take it back, nor did he ask for another cup. He was probably just trying to be polite, to not insult the weird horror girl’s taste in coffee cups. I won’t lie that I took a small pleasure in seeing him cringe at the cup. A petty revenge for all the time he had spent spying on me.

I poured myself another mug. The logo of the community college where I taught night classes on the art of fear in story and the history of horror. A class so niche that after just three semesters, the writing was on the wall and the dean scrapped it during winter break. The closest thing I had to a “real job” in my parents’ eyes, even if it didn’t support me financially enough to be out of their fiscal orbit yet. Once those classes inevitably went away, I went back to my previous work of writing movie reviews for niche websites and spending too much time posting on fan forums. I just told my parents’ that I was unemployed. It was easier that way, and with the small penitence I got from writing those reviews, I was functionally jobless anyway.

Dale sat on the couch. His fingers tapping away at the coffee mug’s handle. Looking contemplatively at the coffee table. Around him, the walls were adorned in framed movie posters of some of my favorites. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (the original nineteen seventies version), Ringu (the original Japanese version), Susperia (You guessed it, the original Italian edition), and The Thing (the John Carpenter Remake). The wall mounted TV remained off, my bookshelves of Blu-ray’s sat filled on either side. The only sound that filled the room was the ticking of the grandfather clock on the wall across from the base of the staircase.

“You know I don’t normally let strange men into my house,” I said, sitting on the love seat across from the couch, placing my coffee cup down. “Especially men who spied on me. But I’ll make the exception for a man who seems to be trapped in the same horror movie as me.”

“Thanks?” Dale asked, looking at me. He took a sip of his coffee, deliberately looking away from the mug as he did so. “And you know that this isn’t a movie, right?”

“Yeah, I know,” I said. “You still have to admit that it’s a little exciting, at least. Well, for me that is. I’m sure that your life at the FBI is always exciting.”

Dale shook his head. “I’m just a desk jockey. Nothing exciting in it.”

“A desk jockey that spies?”

He looked towards the front door as if he was about to say something that would draw unwanted attention. “I work in the Real Time Web Analysis division. My job is to monitor any device hooked up to the internet that is actively being used by the suspect. I don’t even work in the Elevated Threats division, just Persons of Interest. Although internally we just call it ‘Just Keeping Tabs.’ We aren’t even close to James Bond.”

“How long have you been keeping tabs on me, then?” I asked.

“About six months,” he said, taking another sip but avoiding eye contact.

“Why? I haven’t done anything illegal.”

He nodded. “You’re right; you haven’t.”

“Then why?” I asked.

“We have a red-flag system. Whenever any device connected to the internet downloads a certain piece of software or goes to any suspicious site, we keep track of them for certain periods of time. Sometimes it’s just a few days, others, weeks, and sometimes months. No more than six months, though. Unless raised to Elevated Threats, and that’s a whole other division. Luckily for you, you’re no elevated threat, but you watch some messed up stuff.”

“They’re just horror movies,” I said, gesturing at my collection of Blu-ray’s and posters. “Excuse me for having a hobby.”

“More of a lifestyle for you,” Dale said.

I didn’t respond. He wasn’t wrong.

“So why me? Does the FBI have a database on all horror fans or what?”

He shook his head. “Your TOR browser.” He said.

“Fucking Mike,” I said beneath my breath. It was one thing for him to curse me by sharing that video, it was a whole other thing for him to convince me to download something I never used just in case he dug up something truly horrifying on the dark web that would give either of us legitimate goosebumps for once.

2. Does anyone preheat the sr800 before roasting? It seems most videos start with the device/beans cold with no preheat.

3. I prefer light roasts but understand this can be challenging to achieve- especially as a novice. Any recs for trying to achieve something in the neighborhood of city +

I like going for walks and spending time outdoors; a simple day out feels special to me.

I’m straightforward and honest (a habit from the military), and I’m always respectful and genuine.

I prefer phone or video calls over endless texting — real conversation helps avoid misunderstandings and builds stronger connections.

1n8809f,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/1n8809f/how_to_read_between_the_lines_when_talking_to/,How to Read Between the Lines When Talking to Native Chinese — The Case of “还是”,"Hey everyone! As someone who loves sharing the nuances of Chinese, I wanted to talk about a fascinating word today:

**还是 (hái shì)**

Many of you probably know its basic meanings, like:

* 你喝茶还是咖啡? nǐ hē chá háishì kāfēi? - Do you drink tea or coffee?
   * 还是 is used as ""or""
* 我们明天还是同一时间上课。 wǒmen míngtiān háishì tóngyì shíjiān shàngkè. - We still have class at the same time tomorrow.
   * 还是 is used as ""still""

But today, I want to dive into its hidden uses. You know how Chinese people are super indirect, and you have to read between the lines based on context and tone. 还是 is a perfect example of this.

It can be used for gentle suggestion, without being pushy.

* 你还是少喝点酒吧！ nǐ háishì shǎo hē diǎn jiǔ ba!
* You'd better drink less alcohol.
* 我们还是早点出发吧！ wǒmen háishì zǎo diǎn chūfā ba!
* We'd better leave a bit earlier.

It can express a compromise after some hesitation.

* 既然他不想见我，那我还是不去了。 jìrán tā bùxiǎng jiàn wǒ, nà wǒ háishì bú qù le.
* Since he doesn't want to see me, I guess I won't go then.
* 这件衣服太贵了，我还是买那件吧。 zhè jiàn yīfu tài guì le, wǒ háishì mǎi nà jiàn ba.
* This shirt is too expensive. I'll just buy that one instead.

Here's the interesting part - It can also express sticking to your original decision after hesitation.

* 他们还是想争取一下这个机会。 tāmen háishì xiǎng zhēngqǔ yíxià zhège jīhuì.
* They still want to fight for this opportunity.
* 我想了想，还是决定出国。 wǒ xiǎng le xiǎng, háishì juédìng chūguó.
* I've given it some thought and have decided to go abroad after all.

Even though 还是 sounds gentle here, the speaker has actually made up their mind completely. And don't think about changing it!

Lastly, my favorite use is when it acts as a shortened version of “还是说 hái shì shuō"" in questions.

* 我们现在就喊他进来，还是你想再等会儿？ wǒmen xiànzài jiù hǎn tā jìnlái, háishì nǐ xiǎng zài děnghuìr?
* Should we call him in now, or do you want to wait a bit longer?
* 我们一起出发，还是你想自己一个人去？ wǒmen yìqǐ chūfā, háishì nǐ xiǎng zìjǐ yígè rén qù?
* Should we leave together, or do you want to go alone?

In these examples, the speaker is often hinting that they've noticed the other person's hesitation, and they're using 还是 to give them a graceful way out.

Pretty cool, right? This is a great example of the complexity and beauty of Chinese. A simple word can carry so much unspoken meaning.

The best way to get a feel for it is to practice with native speakers. The more you chat, the better you'll get at reading between the lines.",6,1756986720.0,ChineseLanguage,2,1.0,False

1n87zcg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AfterOpening/comments/1n87zcg/should_you_try_mrs_meyers_dish_soap_for_tough/,Should You Try Mrs Meyer's Dish Soap for Tough Grease Cleanup,"Mrs. Meyer's Kitchen Set, model B0BJLD784F, had me rethinking my entire cleaning routine from the day I first opened it. Specifically designed as a trio—dish soap, hand soap, and a multi-surface cleaner—it promises to tackle cleaning tasks with a refreshing peppermint twist while being kind to the environment and cruelty-free. As someone who balances a busy schedule but still appreciates a clean living space, I was eager to see how this set held up in real-world use, from greasy dishes to sticky countertops and the endless parade of messes in between.

**Design and Packaging**  
The packaging caught my eye immediately. The bottles are sturdy and ergonomically friendly, making them unlikely to slip out of your hands even when wet. The peppermint-infused scent comes through the moment you pop open one of the bottles, creating an invigorating atmosphere in the kitchen or bathroom. While the design is minimal, it doesn't sacrifice on aesthetics; these bottles look great sitting out in any space. I also found that the pump on the hand soap dispenses just the right amount—not messy or wasteful.

**Performance and Effectiveness**  
After testing the dish soap on a particularly stubborn casserole dish, I was pretty impressed. The formula cuts through caked-on grease efficiently. It only takes a small amount of soap, which lathers quickly, reducing the need to scrub excessively. Similarly, the hand soap has been part of my daily routine, and its non-drying formula is worth noting. After washing my hands multiple times in a day (thank you, messy kids and constant cooking), they didn’t feel dry or tight, something I’ve noticed with more aggressive hand soaps on the market. The multi-surface cleaner might just be my favorite—it acts as a one-stop solution for all surfaces, from the kitchen counter to the dining table. I even tackled a few coffee spills on my laminate flooring, and it cleaned them up without leaving a sticky residue.

[Check Mrs. Meyer’s B0BJLD784F price on Amazon.](https://go.senaar.com/p/b0bjld784f/)

**Pluses**  
- The peppermint scent is perfectly subtle and refreshing, lingering in the air just long enough.  
- It features plant-derived components, making it eco-friendly without skimping on cleaning power.  
- All three products have excellent usability. A little goes a long way, especially the dish soap.  
- Cruelty-free products are always a huge plus in my book!  

**Caveats**  
- The peppermint scent, while lovely, might be too specific for users who prefer neutral or unscented options.  
- The multi-surface cleaner, though effective on most surfaces, doesn’t work as well on heavy grease stains typical in kitchens.  
- For homes with individuals who have sensitive skin or are sensitive to fragrances, this might not be ideal since it isn't fragrance-free.  

**Competing Products**  
In comparison to Clorox’s dish soap or Lysol’s multi-surface cleaners, Mrs. Meyer’s peppermint set introduces a more natural and eco-conscious choice. Where most competitors use stronger chemical agents, this set relies on plant-based formulas without compromising overall performance. However, brands like Method also market natural cleaning products with quality scents, giving them a competitive edge. That said, I’d argue Mrs. Meyer’s scents seem less overpowering and better balanced.

**Value Proposition**  
Given my experience with the Mrs. Meyer’s B0BJLD784F Kitchen Set, I’d say the price-to-quality ratio is quite favorable. While many cleaning products feel mass-manufactured, this set stands out for its thoughtful formula and satisfying results. It’s a solid investment for someone who values eco-friendly living without having to sacrifice effectiveness. However, if budget is a priority and you’re okay with synthetic or chemical-heavy alternatives, similar sets might cost slightly less elsewhere.

# Chapter 2 - The Horror Head & The Desk Jockey

The townhouse smelled of coffee. Dale sat in the living room while I poured myself a cup. Being the good hostess I had been trained to be growing up, I offered Dale the first cup of coffee, the one with the fucked up collage of Japanese horror I had gotten out earlier. Dale took the mug and thanked me, although his body language seemed to show a distaste towards the artwork on the mug. I did not offer to take it back, nor did he ask for another cup. He was probably just trying to be polite, to not insult the weird horror girl’s taste in coffee cups. I won’t lie that I took a small pleasure in seeing him cringe at the cup. A petty revenge for all the time he had spent spying on me.

I poured myself another mug. The logo of the community college where I taught night classes on the art of fear in story and the history of horror. A class so niche that after just three semesters, the writing was on the wall and the dean scrapped it during winter break. The closest thing I had to a “real job” in my parents’ eyes, even if it didn’t support me financially enough to be out of their fiscal orbit yet. Once those classes inevitably went away, I went back to my previous work of writing movie reviews for niche websites and spending too much time posting on fan forums. I just told my parents’ that I was unemployed. It was easier that way, and with the small penitence I got from writing those reviews, I was functionally jobless anyway.

Dale sat on the couch. His fingers tapping away at the coffee mug’s handle. Looking contemplatively at the coffee table. Around him, the walls were adorned in framed movie posters of some of my favorites. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (the original nineteen seventies version), Ringu (the original Japanese version), Susperia (You guessed it, the original Italian edition), and The Thing (the John Carpenter Remake). The wall mounted TV remained off, my bookshelves of Blu-ray’s sat filled on either side. The only sound that filled the room was the ticking of the grandfather clock on the wall across from the base of the staircase.

“You know I don’t normally let strange men into my house,” I said, sitting on the love seat across from the couch, placing my coffee cup down. “Especially men who spied on me. But I’ll make the exception for a man who seems to be trapped in the same horror movie as me.”

“Thanks?” Dale asked, looking at me. He took a sip of his coffee, deliberately looking away from the mug as he did so. “And you know that this isn’t a movie, right?”

“Yeah, I know,” I said. “You still have to admit that it’s a little exciting, at least. Well, for me that is. I’m sure that your life at the FBI is always exciting.”

Dale shook his head. “I’m just a desk jockey. Nothing exciting in it.”

“A desk jockey that spies?”

He looked towards the front door as if he was about to say something that would draw unwanted attention. “I work in the Real Time Web Analysis division. My job is to monitor any device hooked up to the internet that is actively being used by the suspect. I don’t even work in the Elevated Threats division, just Persons of Interest. Although internally we just call it ‘Just Keeping Tabs.’ We aren’t even close to James Bond.”

“How long have you been keeping tabs on me, then?” I asked.

“About six months,” he said, taking another sip but avoiding eye contact.

“Why? I haven’t done anything illegal.”

He nodded. “You’re right; you haven’t.”

“Then why?” I asked.

“We have a red-flag system. Whenever any device connected to the internet downloads a certain piece of software or goes to any suspicious site, we keep track of them for certain periods of time. Sometimes it’s just a few days, others, weeks, and sometimes months. No more than six months, though. Unless raised to Elevated Threats, and that’s a whole other division. Luckily for you, you’re no elevated threat, but you watch some messed up stuff.”

“They’re just horror movies,” I said, gesturing at my collection of Blu-ray’s and posters. “Excuse me for having a hobby.”

“More of a lifestyle for you,” Dale said.

I didn’t respond. He wasn’t wrong.

“So why me? Does the FBI have a database on all horror fans or what?”

He shook his head. “Your TOR browser.” He said.

“Fucking Mike,” I said beneath my breath. It was one thing for him to curse me by sharing that video, it was a whole other thing for him to convince me to download something I never used just in case he dug up something truly horrifying on the dark web that would give either of us legitimate goosebumps for once. And yet, the most fucked up thing he sent me was through an email attachment and not buried in the deep web. “You know that I never once opened that thing,” I said to Dale.

Dale nodded. “I know. Many people download it out of curiosity but are too scared to do anything with it. But we put them in a six months watch just to be safe.”

“You said that it’s been six months. Why are you still watching me, then?”

“I said about six months. Technically, I’ve been keeping tabs on you for five months and twenty-seven days. You are three days away from being taken off the watchlist.”

I chuckled at the absurdity of all of this. It almost didn’t seem real. Like a dream that my mind had become too invested in, and never wanted to wake up, no matter how fucked up it was. I have had plenty of dreams like that. Dreams that felt like lifetimes of interesting stories I lived out, only to wake up in disappointed that the real world still waited for me on the other side of the night.

“What?” Dale said.

“I just can’t believe how ridiculous this situation is,” I said, letting out another chuckle and shaking my head. “Who would have thought that not only do Ringu-esque cursed videos actually exist, but my personal FBI agent would watch it along with me?”

“This isn’t funny,” Dale said. Not with any sort of affliction of anger or annoyance in his voice, but one of remorse and maybe a little shame.

I stopped laughing.

“You might be amused by all of this, but I’m not,” he continued. “I couldn’t sleep all night. After you watched that video and went to bed, I went to the break room, to decompress. And when I opened up YouTube to unwind, all I saw was that same video over and over again. I asked a coworker of mine in Elevated Threats to verify what was on the screen, and you know what he saw? The stupid video I was trying to watch. Which I couldn’t see. I couldn’t sleep. I couldn’t go home. I needed to get to the bottom of this, to see if you knew anything about it. I even risked my job stealing this thing off my coworker’s desk to find you. Only those in Elevated Threats are even allowed to use these.” He produced a small device from his jacket pocket. From an outsider’s point of view, i.e. mine, it looked like an old BlackBerry phone with its tiny keyboard and monochrome LCD display, but with a large thick, finger-length protrusion coming out of the top and a USB dongle hanging from the bottom.

“What’s that?” I asked.

In a moment of hesitation, like a child who had been caught with something he wasn’t supposed to have, he shoved it back into his pocket. “It’s nothing. Just something that helped me find you.” He said.

“You can’t just hold out a piece of top secret tech and pretend it’s nothing.” I said.

“Look,” he said, looking me in the eye. The way he did it, the way his face did not point directly towards me, but slightly off angle told me that this was something he was not used to doing. “What I’m trying to say is that I risked my job and my family’s wellbeing to get to you in order to break this stupid curse you gave me.”

“I didn’t give it to you,” I said, holding my gaze. Showing him how it’s really done. “You spied on me. You had every right to not watch me.”

“It’s not spying. I was just keeping tabs. There’s a difference. Elevated Threats do the real spy work. I’m just a grunt. And it’s not like I had a choice to watch you. You were assigned to me. I have a job to do, and a family to feed. Not everybody is like you Eleanor, not everybody has the financial support from their parents to keep them afloat while they attempt to carve out a career path that doesn’t exist.” He didn’t raise his voice the entire time, but something about the normal inside voice of his made it feel even more real. My parents had been beating around the bush for years with their semi-faux support, and I learned to not take their words personally. But to hear a man who had been watching me for so long without me even knowing he was doing so say it, that one hurt.

“I’m sorry,” Dale said, looking away. “I didn’t mean that.” He sighed. “What I meant is that I have a family. I’m a father of three and my wife homeschools. I work odd and long hours and I can’t have any sort of whatever this is in my life. This might be exciting for you, but it’s not for me. All I wanted was to be at my oldest son’s soccer game this morning.”

Dale’s phone rang, as if on queue. “Excuse me, I need to take this,” he said. He picked it up.

“Hey honey, how’s it going?” He asked. His voice was brighter as he spoke into the mic. I couldn’t make out any words from the person on the other side.

“Didn’t you get my message? I sent you a text that I needed to work overtime this week.” He paused. “Uh huh. I don’t know how long it’ll be. Hopefully, just a few days. They’re letting me sleep in the training bunks, at least.” His face winced a little at that statement. Like he had tasted something bitter. “Tell Jason that I’m rooting for him to win!” He paused a little. “I’m sorry about the minivan. If I knew about this, I would have left it with you. I’m sure that the Civic has enough life in it to get you and the kids to the game. Tell Jason he can ride in the front. He should be big enough now.” He paused. “Oh, you’re already there?” Dale checked his watch, realizing the time. “I’m sorry, hun. I lost track of time. Haven’t slept all night thanks to work,” he said, looking at me. “Sure, FaceTime me the kickoff. I’ll be on mute and have my video turned off. You know how it is around here. Alright, thank you. I’ll check in with you during my breaks. Love you, and tell the kids that dad’ll be back in a few days. Mwah,” he said into the mic, late, after the hang up tone played. That I could hear.

“Your wife?” I asked.

Dale nodded. His phone vibrated. He opened it with eager.

I could not see what he saw initially. His phone angled away from me. But I saw his face. The momentary burst of joy sunk into an expression of deep horror, the kinds of horror reserved for watching a love one die unexpectedly. The phone slipped from his grasp and hit the coffee table, tumbling towards the center. When it stopped, I could make out the contents of the screen.

“I thought it only affected what had been recorded, not live video,” Dale said. His voice trembled.

On the screen, instead of a live feed of a pee-wee soccer game, was the same video that had plagued the two of us. Those thirty seconds of familiar horror played on repeat during the whole broadcast while Dale moaned, gripping at his hair with his free hand. I reached over to Dale and patted him on the knee. “We’ll get to the bottom of this,” I said. What I didn’t show was my eagerness to get this adventure going. If his knock on the door was the inciting incident, then this was our call to action.

i just want your opinion on if the quality looks good enough and my presence in front of the camera

Most days I don’t feel motivated. The work still gets done. That’s the point. Motivation is a mood. Discipline is a decision. Motivation waits to feel right. Discipline starts anyway.

In my new video, I break down a simple 6-part system I use with entrepreneurs to beat procrastination without relying on hype or willpower spikes. It’s not sexy. It works.

The 6-part framework:

Spot the friction: Name the exact 30-second moment where work stalls (opening the doc? messaging the client?). Label it. Friction hides in vague tasks.

Shrink the action: Cut the task to a two-minute starter. If it’s longer, it’s still a plan, not an action. Start lines, not finish lines.

Lock the trigger: Pair the starter with a fixed cue (coffee brewed → write 3 sentences). Same cue, same place, same time.

Close the exits: Remove one escape per day (phone in another room, site blocker, calendar invites off). Fewer exits, faster starts.

Build visible receipts: Track streaks or “done” counts in one place. Discipline grows when progress is seen, not imagined.

Pre-commit recovery: Miss a day? The rule is “never miss twice.” Reset plan is written in advance. No shame. Just next rep.

Key idea from the video:

Motivation asks “Do I feel like it?” Discipline asks “What’s the next two-minute move?” Start tiny. Finish big. Repeat.

If the goal is to feel disciplined, don’t chase energy—engineer friction out and proof of progress in. That feeling shows up after the reps, not before.

If this resonates, I’ll share the one-page printable of the framework and a checklist I use before deep work sessions. Comment “framework” and I’ll drop it.

P.S. If you’re currently “waiting to feel ready,” here’s your starter: set a 3-minute timer and write the first ugly sentence of the thing you’re avoiding. Timer ends, you’re allowed to stop. You probably won’t.",0,1756986585.0,Life,3,0.14,False
1n87ye7,https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/1n87ye7/kintsugi_resin/,Kintsugi resin,"
Good afternoon,

It’s my partner’s 30th birthday in January, and I’d like to learn kintsugi to repair a bowl or mug they can safely eat or drink from. That means whatever resin I use must be food-safe once cured.

Traditionally, urushi lacquer is used (toxic until cured), but I don’t have access to it. I’m therefore wondering whether there’s an alternative resin. I know epoxy resins are often used in “modern kintsugi,” but my concern is their heat resistance — many common formulations soften around 60–70 °C, which is right in the range of a hot cup of tea or coffee.

What I need is a material that, once cured, is:
	•	inert and food-safe,
	•	capable of withstanding repeated exposure to hot liquids,
	•	reasonably accessible,
	•	and can be mixed with mica flakes or metallic powders for colour.

Are there particular epoxy formulations (or entirely different resins) that chemists here would recommend I investigate?

Thanks very much — I’d be happy to test suggestions.

1n87xv6,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1n87xv6/venting_about_my_awful_life/,Venting about my awful life," I don’t even know where to start. Honestly, I’m 19, about to turn 20 in two months. I’ve been through a lot — not enough to make you feel sick, but enough to leave a child traumatized, lol. I’m the youngest child, and I have an older brother who used to abuse me a lot — physically, mentally, and emotionally. He called me names, punched me multiple times, choked me, yelled at me, and he was even aware that I was a victim of sexual abuse, yet he decided to blackmail me instead of protecting me from those guys. I was five, and he was sixteen.
He did some other sadistic things too, like humiliating me by breaking down the bathroom door when I was pooping. I was four at the time, and I think every guest was staring at me, lmao. He used to spit on me, intimidate me in front of people, and do many other awful things.
Then here come my enablers. My mom told me once, when I was four, that my brother was only abusing me because my father was favoring me, he was jealous, and I should be understanding. My father wasn’t really in the picture most of the time; he was mostly at work or traveling, leaving me with those two bullies. And yes, he’s the type to give a ton of money to his neglected child, thinking that would balance out the emotional absence, lol.
Anyway, I had a three-year-long depressive episode, or whatever you want to call it, and I started isolating when I was fourteen — but that’s another story. Now, I’ve suddenly decided to give myself a chance again to push through and actually live life like a normal teenager, without being so sheltered all the time.
But they decided it’s a good idea to start monitoring every single one of my moves. I didn’t even come back home late the last two days I went out; I just went to coffee shops to study or went on walks. But no, they have this big fantasy inside their head where I’m a helpless child who needs saving, and I don’t understand the outside world, and I should only trust them — and only them — and many other sick things. These were my father’s words today when I wanted to go to a coffee shop to study. The whole lecture was filled with fear-mongering and guilt-tripping.
What makes me even more angry is how they smother their insults and words in sweet voices and talks. Can y’all imagine? My mom was crying because I didn’t want to tell her which coffee shop I wanted to go to, and my father was like, “It’s fine; I’ll take her and stay with her there.” They drive me so insane; I just want to be away from them, and I can’t even have that much. I hate their guts, and I will never forgive them for all of this — for what they put me through, and for how they enabled the horrific abuse their son did to me AND their relatives.",1,1756986521.0,therapy,1,1.0,False

He suggested he would accompany me to the shop to get it fixed, and he even picked me up. We talked well, and he remembered my quiet nature from high school. He also bought me ice cream.

His actions make me feel as though I'm wasting his time and not giving anything back.

I’m thinking about switching to Android (Samsung or Pixel flagship) because I’m a bit bored of the same iOS experience after so many years. That said, there are a few things holding me back and I’d love some honest input from people who’ve used both ecosystems:

Contactless payment – Is Google/Samsung Pay as seamless and reliable as Apple Pay? I use mine daily for travel, coffee, groceries, basically everything.

App performance – On iOS, most apps feel super polished and smooth. How different is the experience on Android? Do you notice lag, stutter, or missing features?

PDF / OCR / QR Code tools – iOS has built-in PDF signing, Live Text (OCR), and QR scanning in the camera. Are the equivalents on Android just as integrated, or do you need third-party apps?


Would really appreciate detailed comparisons or real user experiences. I’m not looking for a flame war – just trying to figure out if switching makes sense.

1n87t4m,https://i.redd.it/zljm5evrx4nf1.jpeg,Fraud alert: Ms. Suman Pahuja,"
ChatGPT helped but the experience and pain is real.

I enrolled in the OMAD (One Meal a Day) diet program by Ms. Suman Pahuja. As per her instructions, I regularly submitted my meal photos and weight updates on a daily basis. She never mentioned any issue about late submissions before. However, the moment I informed her that I was feeling sick, she immediately claimed that my timings were off and removed me from the group without addressing my health concerns.

After following the plan for one and a half weeks, I became unwell due to the extreme nature of having only one meal per day. This led to lowered immunity and acid reflux issues. Instead of providing guidance or support, Ms. Pahuja simply excluded me from the group.

Despite repeated attempts to contact her, she only shared her assistant’s number. Unfortunately, the assistant spoke rudely and disconnected the call without giving any proper response. After multiple tries, Ms. Pahuja finally came on the call but spoke in a very disrespectful manner for hardly 5 sec. She was yelling and abusing (not so classy lady) 😤 

These people don't have patience to listen and just behave illiterate. So through reddit, I want to inform everyone she is a FRAUD and has no experience. 

If her diet plan worked on you well and good or else she cannot help you if you even have minor problems like cold cough acid reflux, she will remove you from batch staying that 7k me kya sab kuch dedu ?? and more think she said which was very disrespectful 

KHANA KYA AAKE TERE MUH ME THUS DU 

So i would like to tell Suman Pahuja. If you cannot provide your services don't provide you don't have the rights to disrespect anyone and if you and your team has guts to speak rubbish then have the guts to listen back also.  Do not behave like coward and block your customers after speaking like an illiterate . 
We are giving money to you to get your services it’s your responsibility to provide quality services and proper responses.

Most of my childhood friends are also living overseas so I've found myself in an awkward position where I'm back to my hometown but don't know many people here anymore. I have no problem making friends with the locals (I'm practically one myself) but also want to continue having a diverse social circle and an excuse to speak English.

No, seriously. I’ve spent hours scrolling, trying random “make $$$ online” apps, and 99% are all SCAMS or just, like… not even worth your time. But THEN… I stumbled onto the actual goldmine of LEGIT apps that pay you – actual real cash, no games – just to test their latest features.

**2. FeatureHive**  
This one? Ultra secretive. Only select users get invites, but there’s a little hack with **[this trick](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** right here (Not kidding, TRY IT… Worked for me!). Got $18 for 25 minutes yesterday!

**3. **BOLD** GoodNovel Test App**

Already on my second payment. Even paid me extra for writing more detail. Wild.

**4. BetaDash**  
Rapid-fire signups. Got in while grabbing coffee?! Often pays $35 a task if you’re fast or offer clever ideas.  

**5. SurveySpark**  
Not just surveys anymore. Literally got “test drive our new AI tools” as a prompt. Got a $50 gift card for that run-through. If you see “TEST REQUEST,” USE IT.

---

PAUSE. **Is my life a simulation now or why hasn’t this been a THING?! 🤯**

---

**6. SneakPeek Labs**  
You’ll get early versions of EVERYTHING – smart home apps, creator tools, even random AI filters. $15 for testing a sleep app (that my cat stole).

**7. Trypotter**  
I brushed this one off as spam. WOW. Stick with it; they auto-pay via PayPal. I tested a “virtual pop-up store,” cashed out the same day.

1n87i63,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1n87i63/what_makes_the_korfile_rustic_brown_kitchen/,What makes the Korfile Rustic Brown kitchen bakers rack worth a review?,"I recently got my hands on the Korfile BR-008-N-22-1-RB Kitchen Bakers Rack, which boasts an elegant rustic brown finish and versatile design. Directly out of the box, it appeared sturdy and well-made for something so lightweight—it weighs just about 18.5 pounds. As someone who loves organizing but hates clutter, I was eager to see how this product could streamline my kitchen space without breaking my back or wallet.

**Design and Aesthetic Charm**  
This baker’s rack carries a ""country rustic"" style that instantly elevates any room with natural warmth. It’s unlit, which is perfect if you’re into clean aesthetics rather than overpowering lighting. The wood finish complements both modern and rustic interiors, seamlessly fitting into my kitchen decor. Measuring 20.87""D x 14.17""W x 49.41""H, it’s compact enough for small kitchens yet spacious enough to hold essentials. Its freestanding installation made repositioning a breeze too. Honestly, placing it in my kitchen corner made the space look far more cohesive.

**Robust Stability**  
This product scores big on stability. With a metal frame reinforced by side X-braces, it’s designed to eliminate any wobble. This is especially useful for heavier kitchen appliances like microwaves or coffee machines. The adjustable feet were a surprisingly thoughtful touch, making it easy to balance the rack on slightly uneven surfaces. I tested its limits (just out of curiosity!) and can confirm it holds up to the stated 280-pound maximum weight capacity without sagging.

[See Korfile BR-008-N-22-1-RB deals on Amazon now.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0ddh7wxwt/)  

**Versatile Storage Options**  
One thing I adore about this baker's rack is how functional it is. The four roomy tiers provided ample space to store my microwave, a small air fryer, and a set of canisters with room to spare. There's even a vented base shelf for fruits and vegetables, which keeps produce fresh thanks to the improved airflow. They didn’t forget smaller kitchen items either—eight removable S-hooks hold mugs, utensils, or tools within easy reach. It’s a space-saver's dream, especially if you’re short on cupboards like me.

**Adjustable Shelf Height**  
Flexibility is another winning feature. The central shelf offers two adjustable heights, making room for taller appliances, bottles, or containers. During assembly, I adjusted the shelf to accommodate my coffee maker, which stands taller than the usual countertop clutter. This adaptability ensures the rack morphs to fit your ever-changing needs. 

**Simplicity in Setup**  
If you’ve ever been intimidated by furniture assembly, worry not. This baker’s rack comes with detailed instructions, labeled parts, and all tools in the box. It took me around 25 minutes to set everything up—I had minimal hiccups following step-by-step instructions. A little tip: double-check the dimensions before purchasing to ensure it aligns well with your space.

**Benefits**  
- Strong and stable frame enhanced by dual X-braces.  
- Compact yet generous storage ideal for small kitchens.  
- Adjustable shelf height for flexibility in storage needs.  

**Drawbacks**  
- The backless design can feel limiting if you want an enclosed look.  
- Although lightweight, it might not feel premium for high-end kitchens.  
- Cleaning the grooves in the rustic finish requires a little patience.  

**Market Rivals**  
For greater context, I compared this product with a few competitors like the VASAGLE ALINRU and Mr. IRONSTONE vintage-style baker's racks. Both offer similar rustic aesthetics but lack certain details—VASAGLE doesn't include adjustable shelves, and the hooks on Mr. IRONSTONE racks are fewer in number. While Korfile’s option isn’t the absolute cheapest, it outperformed others in terms of stability and overall aesthetic presence. On the flip side, there are models with enclosed shelving if visibility or keeping dust at bay matters to you more.

**Affordable Quality**  
One of the nicest surprises of this rack is how budget-friendly it is. Given its durability, flexibility, and visually appealing design, it’s a solid investment for those who want premium functionality without hemorrhaging money. Its cost-performance ratio stands out, especially when compared against higher-priced items that don't offer adjustable shelves or stability innovations.

Honest Review,"The **Frigidaire FPPWFU01 PurePour PWF-1 Water Filter** is one of those products you come across and think, ""How did I ever survive without this?"" As someone who’s perpetually paranoid about the taste and safety of tap water, a good quality water filter is an absolute must in my household. I've been using this one for over three weeks, and here's the tea (filtered water-flavored, of course).

**Ease of Installation**  
This water filter is built to make your life easier. Its compact dimensions—2.3 inches by 2.3 inches by 9.5 inches—fit perfectly into my refrigerator’s filter housing without any struggle. The installation process took mere minutes, and I didn’t even need to consult the manual, although it’s available if you’re not as adventurous as me. Just click it into place, run some water to flush out the carbon particles, and you’re set. It’s so straightforward even my tech-inept aunt managed to do it when she borrowed one for her refrigerator.

[Discover Frigidaire FPPWFU01 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b08v6jb9r7/)

**Water Quality That Speaks for Itself**  
The water coming out of this filter tastes phenomenally clean. Certified by NSF & WQA, it eliminates up to 99% of contaminants, including chlorine and heavy metals like lead. I tested this claim with a home water-contaminant test kit, and while I’m no scientist, the results were reassuring. Plus, my tea and coffee have genuinely leveled up in flavor since switching to this filter. My kids even commented on how much better plain drinking water tastes now—it’s the kind of badge of honor for a parent you never see coming.

**Compatibility with Refrigerator Models**  
This filter is tailor-made for Frigidaire and compatible Electrolux refrigerators, supporting various models. For anyone like me with a Frigidaire setup, it’s a no-brainer. However, if you use a device manufactured by other brands, this likely won’t be your match. That said, one quick check of your refrigerator's user manual or the product specs will prevent any confusion.

**Strengths of the Product**  
- Installs in minutes with no tools required.  
- Delivers crisp, refreshing, contaminant-free water.  
- Substantial cost savings compared to bottled water.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Not compatible with non-Frigidaire refrigerators.  
- Occasionally requires a more thorough initial flush than expected.  

**Build Quality and Lifespan**  
What impressed me is the filter’s durable plastic construction and its promised half-year lifespan. Based on my water consumption rate, which includes a caffeine-addicted partner and two perpetually thirsty kids, those six months seem realistic. It’s a trusted choice for maintaining clean, odorless water year-round. The bonus is the filter’s minimal environmental impact—far better than the constant cycle of purchasing and discarding bottled water.

**Noise Level and Performance during Use**  
While most water filters are silent operators, this one occasionally gave a faint gurgling sound during the flushing process and the first few uses. It’s not a deal-breaker but worth noting if you’re exceptionally sensitive to noises.

**Peer Products Comparisons**  
Several available alternatives, such as EveryDrop and Brita filters, also perform admirably in terms of contaminant reduction. However, what sets the Frigidaire filter apart for me is its authentically tailored design for Frigidaire appliances. While Brita options offer external water pitchers and filters for universal use, those often require extra counter space—a luxury my small kitchen lacks. EveryDrop, on the other hand, aligns well with Whirlpool products, but usability with Frigidaire refrigerators is uncertain. If your home setup includes a Frigidaire appliance, this filter is undeniably the smarter choice.

**Quality for Price**  
Is the Frigidaire PWF-1 expensive upfront compared to generic filters? Absolutely. However, its cost-efficiency over time is unmatched. Inferior filters often compromise performance and, ironically, end up costing more due to faster replacement needs. Investing in a genuine high-quality filter felt like smart spending, knowing I wouldn’t be running to replace it three months down the line.

1n87h7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1n87h7t/itinerary_suggestions/,Itinerary Suggestions,"Hi All! I will be visiting Seoul this month with my wife and 1yo daughter. This will be my 3rd time in Seoul (although didn’t do much the first two times due to work) and my wife’s first time. We’ll be there for 5 days and it will be our first time traveling with a baby. My wife mainly wants to get some skincare and her hair done. I’m down to do anything, I enjoy a good cup of freshly brewed coffee (mainly black), Korean fried chicken, KBBQ, golf, and rock climbing (mainly bouldering). I’d like to walk around some nice parks and take some memorable pictures with my little family as well. Hoping for some recommendations or tips on things to do or anything that will help with traveling around. The plan so far is: 

Day 1: Arrive at Incheon around 6AM. Take taxi to Airbnb in Sillim-dong (staying here for the 5 days). Check in early, get some rest. Get up around 1030/11am and head out to Gangnam. Wife has appointment at 1pm that should take approx 3ish hours. During this time I thought I’d go shopping for a good travel stroller to use (we plan on buying one while here in Seoul). Rest of the day is open so far. 

Day 2: Wife has a potential hair appointment at around 11AM. Hasn’t confirmed it yet as she is looking if there are any better places to go. She wants to get color done. Not sure got long this might take, she has long, thick hair is that helps with any suggestions anyone may have. During this time I’d go around with my daughter and maybe find a little kids play place where can play a bit until my wife is done. Rest of the day is open after. 

Day 3: Spend some time in Myeongdong doing a bit of shopping. Maybe explore any other places around this area for the day. 

Day 4 and Day 5 aren’t planned yet. 

Thinking of using taxis for getting around as I have no idea how using the subway with a baby will be. I’ve read that we probably won’t need a baby seat most of the time using taxis (?) and also that the truck space isn’t as big, hence the search for a good travel stroller. Also thinking of modifying our Airbnb to stay there for only 1 or 2 nights and then get a nice hotel closer to the city areas of Seoul just so it won’t take as long to get around and back to the hotel at night. 

Some hotel options we currently have are:
The Link Seoul in Gyeongin-ro
RYSE Autograph Collection in Mapo-gu
Moxy Seoul in Myeongdong
Courtyard by Marriott Seoul Times Square
Courtyard by Marriott Seoul Botanic Park

These are at the top of the list also because I get the points for Marriott Bonvoy, but we’re open to any suggestions that would be better with the baby. ",1,1756985066.0,koreatravel,2,1.0,False

I’m not sure what to do about GERD. My symptoms are very mild: a persistent sour (sometimes bitter) taste in my mouth and, sometimes, a light burning sensation in the upper chest. I usually do nothing with it during day, cause it quite weak sensations.

Also, i don't see any effect of food change, besides limiting caffeine (i stop drinking coffee, drink lie) and

I don't think that cause is low or high acid, be. Around the same time this started, I also developed dry skin/dermatitis and dry eyes—both new for me—so I’m wondering if there could be any connection.

PPIs haven’t helped; some cause me serious dizziness, some just not work. I don’t think I have low stomach acid because my appetite is normal and I don’t have other symptoms beyond what I described.

I tried PPIs under the supervision of a doctor, which I trust (the same doctor successfully treated my SIBO). I’ve been under his care for about six months. His latest recommendation was a low dose of sulpiride. It reduced the “stronger” symptoms and I had a short period of frequent burping that later resolved, but the sour taste remains. I’m not sure what to try next.

I’ve also tried rebamipide, and I take one Gaviscon tablet at night, but the symptoms persist.

Has anyone know what to check / what it can be?

P.S. I also tried a very strict diet for a few weeks with no improvement. The only consistent dietary factors I’ve noticed are that caffeine makes symptoms worse.

Just wanted to share a quick personal update as I hit the double 5 mark. I don’t plan to keep counting every step, but this feels like a solid milestone — not just in numbers, but in mindset. Hopefully, something here resonates with you.

# Mental Health Check-In

Lately, I’ve been feeling a bit low — heavy, honestly. Small things have been getting under my skin, and I’ve noticed I’ve stopped sugarcoating how I feel. I’m no longer taking on extra shifts or doing things just to fill space or please people. If there’s mutual respect and good conversation, I’m here for it. If not, I’m protecting my time.

Through some meditation and self-reflection, I realized this might be a kind of withdrawal — my brain adjusting to life without constant stimulation. The irritability feels like built-up energy I haven’t released. So I hit the gym hard, threw some punches at the bag, and let a lot of it out. Felt good.

# Finding Purpose

I’ve realized I can’t sit idle anymore — I need to be doing something that feels meaningful. I’ve been thinking about starting a side hustle that could turn into a business. It feels right to build something of value that helps others and keeps me grounded.

# How I See People Now

Something’s definitely shifted in how I see others — especially women. I don’t look at people through a surface-level lens anymore. I see them for who they are, and that’s changed how I move. No more weird energy or forced interactions.

Because of that, I’ve noticed people respond to me differently. The staff at my regular café have been extra kind — one called me “love, darling,” and it was just pure good vibes, not awkward or over the top. Another gave me a chocolate with my coffee. Little things, but they hit different when you’re moving with clarity and respect.

I also feel like I’m seeing people’s true intentions more clearly. That’s helped me stay aligned with what feels right.

# Looking Ahead

Right now, I’m more goal-focused than ever. I’ve been sharing ideas with people and seeing some of them take off, which has been super motivating. I’ve got a few things in the pipeline and feel good about where I’m headed.

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

The sublease would last a year, ending on September 30th, 2026 unless we decide to renew it.

We are also requiring a $675 security deposit to be paid upon move-in along with first month’s rent.

Monthly Expenses:
Rent Portion: $675/month
Internet Portion: $18.75/month
Electric Bill Portion: usually around $20-$60/month, depends on usage.
Gas Bill Portion: usually around $5-$10/month, depends on usage.

Apartment Features:
- 3 bedrooms, 1 bathroom.
- Bathroom has adequate plumbing and a nicely-sized bathtub & shower.
- Living room is a decently-sized space with a couch, coffee table, bean bag chair, TV, & a bookshelf.
- Kitchen is also decently-sized and includes a fridge, stove, toaster oven, microwave, sink, and bar table with bar chairs. 
    - Note: We do not have any kind of vent above the stove, which we have constantly complained to our super about to no avail. As a result, we have had to cook with the smoke detector off to prevent it from being set off by whatever we are cooking. This has not really been a problem for us at all, but we want to be transparent here.

Sublet Room Features:
12’ by 7’ (84 sq. ft.)
1 Window facing the street.
Closet space

Who we’re looking for:
Ultimately, we want someone who is Clean, Considerate, and Chill.
- Clean meaning someone who helps us maintain a clean apartment by cleaning the kitchen and dishes after using them, keeping the living room and bathroom clean, and is a relatively clean person themselves so we can avoid pests entirely in the apartment.
- Considerate meaning someone who understands that they live with 3 other people whom all share the space. Someone with empathy.
- Chill meaning someone who is friendly and someone that we don’t need to feel awkward around. Mainly, we would like our prospective roommate to be someone we can vibe with and someone who isn’t judgmental. Someone who is ultimately a good fit for us and that we are a good fit for as well.

Who we are:
We are three queer individuals in their mid-20’s. We are politically left-leaning, pro-Palestine & pro-Trans. Two of us are male and in a relationship. One of us is non-binary and neurodivergent. Two of us are Latin American (Mexican & Mexican/Colombian) and one of us is Italian. We are all non-religious and one of us is spiritual. If any of these attributes are dealbreakers for you, or if you are uncomfortable with any of these attributes, we may not be a good fit for you.

What we need from you:
- We want to know what you do for work. We don’t need any proof of income (we’re not landlords lol) and we have no judgment no matter what line of work you are in, but we would like to ensure that we are subleasing with someone who has a steady source of income and can make rent payments on time.
- We want to know a little about yourself. Whatever you feel comfortable telling us and whatever you feel we should know before considering you as a roommate. We really value transparency. We would at the very least like you to tell us your name, age, and gender identity/pronouns in your message.
- We would like to set up a date to get to know you better through a very casual interview & apartment tour. As much as we’d be interviewing you, you’d be interviewing us because, at the end of day, we are all determining whether or not we are a good fit for each other. We would also like to show you the apartment and your potential room so you can make sure it’s right for you.
- Please also let us know if you’d be bringing any pets with you and what they’re like (size, are they shy? hyperactive? do they have a tendency to get into places they’re not supposed to or scratch/bite furniture? etc.). The building is pet-friendly but it is a small apartment, so it may not be ideal for more than 1 pet or a pet that needs a lot of space.

It’s an office conversion above a coffee shop in a nice part of Greater London. The lease has over 150 years left; ground rent is capped at £250 a year and the service charge has ranged between £2,000-£2,500 over the last 8 years. The building is made of brick with no cladding issues.

I’ve had 2 buyers pull out, one was at max affordability with a high LTV and couldn’t get a mortgage due to the valuer’s comments that it would be difficult to sell. The second pulled out as they had a LTV of less than 50% and found a nicer 2 bed flat for about 25% more.

We lost our onward house but quickly found one that’s cheaper and we can afford to rent out the flat. The Let to Buy mortgage was initially rejected as it’s above commercial property and would therefore be hard to sell. The broker appealed and the underwriter basically looked at it and said it’s a 2 bed flat in a central location above a coffee shop that’s being valued at about 75% of the average 2 bed flat in the area, this is as low risk as you can get and we’ll happily give a mortgage.

Question 1
The plan to ease housing problems is to build flats above shops in city/town centres, if valuers are saying these are difficult to sell then where are properties going to be built?

Question 2
Valuers are paid per valuation, legally speaking can they be independent and objective when valuing? The incentive for them is obviously to reject as many mortgage applications as possible, safe in the knowledge that the odds of a second/third/fourth valuation for that property are pretty high. Personally there seems to be an obvious conflict of interest in the industry.",1,1756984153.0,HousingUK,1,1.0,False

*The 2025 FIFA World Cup Qualifier: September 4, 2025*

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a mismatch so stark it could make a spreadsheet weep. Brazil, the eight-time coffee-chugging giant of South American football, faces Chile, a team that’s already mathematically eliminated and nursing a hangover from their 2018 World Cup dreams. Let’s break this down with the precision of a Neymar free-kick and the humor of a Samba dancer tripping over their own feet.

---

### The Odds: Brazil’s Implied Probability is “ basically 100% minus a rounding error”

The bookmakers aren’t just favoring Brazil—they’re *mocking* Chile. At decimal odds of 1.21 (implied probability: **82.6%**), Brazil is the statistical equivalent of a coffee addict needing their morning brew. Chile’s 16.0 odds (**6.25%**) suggest they’re the team that trips over their own shoelaces while trying to score. Even the draw is a long shot (16.4% implied probability), which makes sense—Chile’s last goal against Brazil came in 2015, and it’s been buried under a mountain of Brazilian net celebrations since.

The spread? Brazil is -1.75 goals, meaning they’re expected to win by *at least two*. If you bet on Chile +1.75, you’re essentially betting that a penguin can out-sprint a cheetah on a bet365 bonus.

---

### The News: Brazil’s “Squad of Part-Timers” vs. Chile’s “Retirement Party”

Brazil’s head coach, Carlo Ancelotti (yes, *that* Ancelotti), has fielded a squad that reads like a “most likely to forget the playbook” award winner. Key players like Neymar, Vinicius Jr., and Rodrygo are out—some injured, others “technically decided.” It’s like showing up to a buffet and realizing the only thing left is the salt and pepper shakers.

Chile, meanwhile, is hosting a farewell tour. Coach Nicolás Córdova has left veterans like Alexis Sánchez and Arturo Vidal on the sidelines,

The stage is set for a World Cup qualifier that reads like a Netflix script: *“The Immortal Legend of Lionel Messi vs. the Desperate Hope of Venezuela.”* On September 4, 2025, Argentina—already qualified, already celebrating, already plotting their post-Messi era—hosts Venezuela, a team that needs a miracle to keep their World Cup dreams alive. Let’s break this down with the precision of a spreadsheet and the humor of a spreadsheet that’s accidentally formatted as a haiku.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Argentina’s Implied Probability is “ basically 100%”

The bookmakers are as clear as Messi’s vision on the field: **Argentina is a 1.2 to 1.24 favorite**, translating to an 80-83% implied probability of victory. Venezuela? They’re priced at 13.0, or roughly a 7% chance—about the same odds as me correctly predicting the outcome of your Monday morning coffee order. The draw? A 17-19% shot, which is generous if you think this game will end 0-0 because both teams’ goalkeepers have suddenly developed a love for yoga.

Why the gulf? Argentina’s squad is a who’s-who of “unbeatable forces,” led by Messi, who’s playing his final qualifier like it’s his last *TikTok dance challenge*. Venezuela, meanwhile, needs a win to stay alive in the race for direct qualification—a task akin to convincing a penguin to sunbathe in the Sahara.

---

### Digesting the News: Messi’s Farewell, Venezuela’s Desperation

Argentina’s coach, Lionel Scaloni (yes, *that* Scaloni—brother of the one who invented “casual Friday”), has a 16-time champion team that’s already booked their 2026 ticket. This match? A chance for Messi to bow out of qualifiers with a farewell performance that’ll make fans weep… or at least pause their streaming to wipe their eyes.

Venezuela, meanwhile, is fighting a battle that feels like a David vs. Goliath story… if David had a \*real

*The 2026 World Cup Qualifiers’ Most Lopsided Dance Begins*

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a mismatch so stark, it’s like watching a sumo wrestler juggle toothpicks. On September 4, 2025, Spain—a team that treats World Cup qualifiers like a Tuesday afternoon nap—will face Bulgaria, a squad currently ranked 84th in FIFA’s ""Who’s Most Likely to Forget the Kit?"" rankings. The odds? Spain is a +9 favorite (decimal: 1.09), implying a 91.7% chance of victory. Bulgaria’s odds of 26.0 (3.8% implied probability) suggest bookmakers would pay you if you bet on them… to buy a lottery ticket. The draw? A 9.5% shot, roughly the chance of a Bulgarian player scoring a hat trick in this match.

**Parsing the Odds: Why Spain’s Chances Are as Certain as Taxation**  
Spain’s historical dominance over Bulgaria reads like a horror movie for the latter. The first meeting in 1933 ended 13-0. Yes, *thirteen*. Modern stats are kinder to Bulgaria, but Spain still holds a 4-1-1 edge. With 13 of 16 qualifying debut wins and a coach, Luis de la Fuente, who declared, “Queremos ganarlo todo” (“We want to win everything”), the Spanish machine is a well-oiled Mercedes while Bulgaria is a go-kart built by a toddler.

Bulgaria’s recent form? A 2-17 winless streak. They’re football’s version of a slow cooker: once you’re in, you’re not coming out anytime soon. Their defense? Per Forza 2025, it’s a sieve that’s learned to *sing* sieve songs. Spain’s attack, led by Lamine Yamal (age 17, skill level: “I’ll be your emotional support octopus today”) and Nico Williams (who plays like he’s late for a date with a trophy), should have them scoring like a coffee shop in a 19th-century village.

**Intro:** Wynef has only been at the Lamotte house for just the one night, but there are some things that will need to happen before she can truly get settled into her parolee life. Today, she at least gets to start slow and at her own pace for the first time in a *very* long time.

\------

**Memory Transcription Subject: Douglas Lamotte. Quality Manager at Pinecliffe Systems.**

**Date: \[Standardized Human Time\] April 17, 2137**

My alarm buzzes on my wrist, and I quickly follow through with the standard routine of throwing myself out of bed and quickly putting on my clothes in the dark.

*But wait, something is off…*

It takes my brain a few moments to catch up, but I realize the cause of my confusion is that I can actually see what is in front of me in the room. The morning sunlight streaming in through the windows marks a finality of me no longer having to get up before the crack of dawn to head to the prison. Although I had been getting up at different times since my last day, only now does my brain start to accept the new timing.

*This old dog is having trouble learning new tricks. Can’t complain too much about actually getting sleep again, though.*

I finish dressing into casual house clothes and drag myself through the rest of my morning routine, being joined shortly by an angel. As I brush my teeth, I get a quick peck on the cheek, and she calls out to me as she hops into the shower.

“Mornin’ Dougie.”

“Guhmurnin dhear.”

I finish up the last of my tasks in the bathroom and head out into the kitchen, pausing for a moment as my brain reminds me of another rather important thing that is new about my life.

*Ah yes, there is a young, pregnant alien girl living in your basement. A girl who just stepped outside of that prison for the first time in months.*

I creep my way over to the edge of the stairs heading down into the new Wynef-Land and try to hear if anything is amiss. Nothing of note echoes up the stairs, and I resign myself back to the kitchen to start on breakfast for three and a half.

\------

As the apple crisps are nearly done and the oatmeal is fluffy and ready to go. A pot of coffee bubbles happily on the maker next to an electric tea kettle boiling water as Angie comes in and immediately starts setting the table. In just a moment, I have the warm cinnamon apples and oatmeal ready for being slopped into a bowl and a nice cup of coffee in my hand ready to sip. Angie takes her full mug from me and slides alongside to lean against the counter with me.

“So, you think she’ll be up soon?”

“Well, she was usually an early riser at the prison. I expect at minimum the smell should have her curious and make her way up soon enough.”

“The smell alone?”

“Oh yeah, most of the aliens have incredible senses of smell and hearing; they raised hell more often than not over us eating and talking in the break room.”

Angie gives me a worried glare and turns quickly back to her mug.

“We’ll give her a few more minutes.”

\------

My back sore from leaning into the stone countertop for too long, I get a nudge in my side, and I slowly look over to an Angie that has barely drunk half of her coffee.

“Dougie, she’s probably okay, right?”

*I mean, this is unusual for Wynef, but* ***everything*** *is unusual for Wynef.*

“Probably?”

“...”

“I’ll go check on her.”

I stand up out of my chair at the kitchen table and set my empty mug down. I shuffle my way across the room to the staircase and slowly walk down, making sure not to stomp too much. At the bottom of the stairs, I hear something that I remember had been becoming more and more common before her parole.

*Is that the sound of a diesel-powered crosscut saw or perhaps maybe a pregnant bunny-alien girl? I don’t know; it’s kind of hard to tell the difference from here.*

I walk just a bit further forward outside of her door and listen for just a second to the unbelievably loud snoring coming from within. With a light smile, I turn around and head back up the stairs to see Angie waiting on me.

“So, how is she?”

“Snoring like an old fishing boat fighting upstream against a waterfall.”

My metaphor gets a devious smile from my angel as she tries to hide it behind her hands.

“Y-you ***cannot*** call that poor girl names like that, no matter how funny it is. But seriously, should we leave her? I don’t want her going hungry.”

“It’s easier to eat than it is to get more sleep. We should let her rest.”

Not willing to disagree with me, Angie quickly beats me to the bowls and starts to get her own food as she shrugs.

“In that case, I’m eating now then. I don’t want to waste your food while it’s still warm.”

“Second that.”

\------

Breakfast has long since passed, and the sun of the day rises further and further into the sky. I pour another mug of coffee and join Angie as we move from the kitchen out onto the back deck. The door slides open, and we take our chairs overlooking the river and valley below. The sun shines brightly against the snow-lined mountains, and I suddenly regret not bringing my sunglasses out. Light drips of snowmelt can be heard coming off the roof and tree branches while the small drainage creek on the edge of the property babbles in a sing-song tone. Closing my eyes, I take a long sip and enjoy the sound of songbirds praising the first wakings of spring.

Suddenly, a cold feeling tickles down my neck, and my hair stands up on my arms. I open my eyes and make a sidelong glance over to Angie as she does the same. She raises an eyebrow and nods her head as she makes the expected comment.

“You can feel that, right?”

“The weight of a stare?”

“Yep.”

We both slowly turn around to see a very dazed-looking Wynef standing slouched behind the sliding glass door. She is wearing one of the larger shirts that was at the thrift store, as it hangs down to her knees like a dress and hides most of her curves. Probably for the best, as what can be seen of Wynef is ruffled and unkempt. Her fur is roughed up all over, and a very clear sign of horrible bedhead has the fur on the side of her head going up in the wrong direction.

*Damn girl, must have slept* ***hard.*** *Still curled your hair up top, though? Must be important for some reason?*

Angie and I both start to make the move to stand up and join Wynef inside when she lethargically reaches over and slides open the door. Her pink hoof boots make soft thumps on the wooden board of the deck as she trudges over and stands in front of the chair nearest to me. She hesitantly reaches back and lowers herself into the cushion with a low and long groan, finally sinking all the way back in and letting her arms relax and her eyes close. Agnie and I both reset back into our own chairs and have a quick conversation through our eyes before I address Wynef.

“Good morning, Wynef.”

“G-good morning, pred-Douglas.”

*Woah, anti-me slurs in my own house? She hasn’t… Hmmm.*

“Predator Douglas? You haven’t used that one in a while.”

Her eyes flutter open as she looks at me and begins to slowly boil into a light blue of embarrassment.

“I-I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to say that. I-I just feel… ***out*** of it.”

*Ah fuck, ‘out of it’? No way we can let her get sick under our watch.*

“‘Out of it?’ Out of it how? Do we need to go back to the doctor’s office today?”

Wynef somehow turns even more blue as Angie and I hold our breaths while Wynef's brain loads a response.

“N-no! I just feel slow to wake up b-because the bed was so nice.”

*Load of bullshit, but whatever. She’ll learn in time how to use the parent bullshit detector.*

“Hmph, if you say so.”

As we all relax again, I can barely hear Wynef muttering under her breath.

“That was the first full night’s sleep since Ulimtal, wasn’t it? Before…”

As she tries to finish her own thought, I can barely hear a grumble come from her way, and she shoots forwards and clutches her belly. Angie, likely not able to hear it, also shoots forwards, but I just respond to Wynef with a smile.

“Sounds like you need some food. Let’s get on inside.”

Angie backs me up as we both get out of our chairs.

“He’s right. Can’t imagine what could be more important for you than some good food after a good rest.”

Wynef eyes me suspiciously as we pass her, and I watch the reflection of her in the glass door as she slowly gets up and begins to follow us with soft thumps of her hoof boots on the deck boards. I open the glass door, and we all make our way to the kitchen table, where Angie and Wynef each take a seat at the table, and I quickly reheat breakfast for Wynef. Soon enough, it’s ready in bowls, and I slide them in front of Wynef along with a glass of water and a mug of green tea. Sitting down at the table with the two girls, I hold my own refilled mug as Angie and I sit there and *very* chalantly watch Wynef.

She uses a spoon to scoop up a bite of oatmeal with a nice apple crisp on top. Just as she is about to take the bite, she stares at Angie and me while tilting her ears back and forth.

“A-are you two not going to eat?”

Angie finishes her sip and puts a gentle hand on Wynef’s arm as she responds.

“No, Wynef, we ar-”

“No?! I-I… y-you can’t eat because of me, ***right?*** I’ve only been here for a night and I’m already *ruining* your-”

Angie gives a few quick taps to Wynef’s arm just as tears are starting to fall down her cheeks in her spiral.

“***Wynef***\*\*.\*\* We already ate this morning while you were sleeping. It’s between meals for us right now; we’ll have a late lunch all together in the afternoon, alright?”

Wynef gets control of herself and wipes her eyes into her neck and shoulder fluff as she flicks her ears forward in silent understanding. Finally calm, she actually takes the bite, and I can’t help but smile as she seems to really enjoy the meal.

*Well, at least I think she enjoys it, given the speed she’s scarfing it down.*

In no time, Wynef has devoured the entire bowl of food and is just as quickly chugging the cup of water and mug of tea. As she finishes, I get up to make her another cup and some for Angie and myself as well. Luckily, the already hot water makes it easy, and I’m quickly back at the table just enjoying the moment as Wynef seems dazed trying to wake up and digest the food she probably ate too fast.

Before I can even think of something to start talking about, a knock comes at the door accompanied by the doorbell ringing. I quickly check the video doorbell and see a very, ***very*** unexpected, expected visitor. A tall young man in a police uniform stands at the door, fidgeting back and forth on his feet. I quickly get up out of my chair, and Angie must know something is up with my mood, as she questions me right as I am about to give Wynef a heads up.

“Dougie, who is at the door?”

I don’t respond directly to Angie; instead, I look at Wynef and address her.

“Wynef, your parole officer is here, or at least I think that’s who this is. Stay calm and be friendly. I didn’t expect the first visit this fast, but don’t let that rattle you.”

Wynef blanches as I fully stand up and head to the door. I do a second look through the peephole and confirm what the video saw as I unlock and open the door. The officer seems semi-surprised to see me for some reason as he awkwardly sticks his hand out, and I instinctively return the handshake.

“Hello sir, I’m Parole Officer Lucas Elling. Is this the Lamotte house? I’m here to speak with Wynef, a, uhhh, *Nevok* woman. Is she here today?”

“Douglas Lamotte, nice to meet you. Also, yes, Wynef is here, and this is her ***first*** day home, and she’s just finished eating with us.”

His eyes seem to light up a bit in relief as he smiles big and starts to move forward before stopping himself.

“Oh, g-good, Can I come in?”

*Almost forgot to ask, did you?*

“Of course.”

I step aside to let the officer into my house as he awkwardly shuffles in, and I close and lock the door behind him. I lead him into the kitchen, and upon spotting Wynef, who is still a turbo-mess of bedhead, he stops in the door and freezes. The discombobulated Wynef and he share an all-too-awkward staredown as Officer Elling finally comes back to reality.

“H-hello Miss Wynef, my name is Officer Elling, and I’m going to be your parole officer.”

Wynef takes a deep breath and does her best to calmly keep double eye contact despite her normal single-eye focus.

“N-nice to meet you, Officer Elling.”

Elling stops in his tracks once again as I see a red start to develop in his cheeks and his lips purse. I give him a hand on the shoulder with a light squeeze, and that seems to shock him into looking over at me.

“Is everything alright, officer?”

“I just remembered. I, uh, don’t have a translator implant.”

I hear a thump as Angie’s head falls into her hands on the table, and my own tilts back up to the ceiling to ask for mercy. I release him and pull out my own pad as I lead him to the table.

*They assigned her a green rookie? What the fuck! That’s her luck, I guess…*

“Why don’t you just have a seat, and we can use my pad translator this time?”

“Oh right! Pad translators! I can use mine with an earbud.”

He quickly takes his own pad and opens a translator app while putting a single earbud in. All set up, he looks at a very confused Wynef across the table and tries his introduction again.

“Hello Miss Wynef, my name is Officer Elling, and I’m your parole officer.”

“Nice to meet you, Officer Elling.”

Elling pauses for a moment as the translator takes the time to catch up, and he nods as he continues.

“Now, as I’m sure the parole board explained, there are expectations and requirements, um, *conditions* you are expected to meet and maintain in order to not violate your parole. Things like don’t commit any criminal offense, you have to be home by 1 am, you cannot travel out of state without permission from me, no buying or using weapons, you cannot ***ever*** travel off-planet, and you are also expected to refrain from alcohol or drug use. This all sound familiar to you?”

Wynef releases a held breath as she nods and flicks her ears at the officer, who flinches back from the long ears whipping forwards and then back.

“Yes, I am aware of all of those conditions. I don’t have anywhere to be outside of this house, and it was made clear that I am expected to not drink or take drugs already.”

“Oh, there is the additional condition that you must be in education or employment for the duration of your parole, starting as soon as possible.”

Wynef recoils in her seat, and I can practically see the gears spinning up in her brain as the gravity of the condition hits her.

*Wait, I thought this was covered in the last parole hearing?*

“I-I, How am I supposed to go back to college or get a job like, ***like*** ***this***?”

“Like what?”

Wynef uses her hands on the table to help herself up and points at her stomach mostly hidden by the baggy shirt. When Elling scrunches his eyes in confusion, Wynef lifts the shirt up, and a wonderfully timed kick from the baby pushes out from under her rounded belly, and Elling sinks in his seat.

“I was not made aware that you were expecting. I-I’ll ask for clarification on the education-employment condition and get back to you as soon as possible.”

Wynef slowly retakes her seat as she reaches down and holds her stomach again with a nod and ear flick. 

“If you don’t mind me asking, Miss Wynef, when is your baby due?”

Wynef looks up at him with lightly watery eyes, and her nose twitches in thought.

“Based on when she was… conceived… she should be born in around 80 days.”

“A she? Any plans for the baby? Any names if you’re keeping her?”

Angie and I both give Elling a grimace and head shake as he asks the question, but it’s too late. Wynef’s eyes sink back into the same empty stare that she had when I first met her, and I can see her shut down in real time. To his credit, Elling sees the same shift and starts to rise from his chair.

“Well, anyway, nice to meet you, Wynef. Sorry for making this visit the first day; you are just my first xeno parolee, and I was encouraged to check in very quickly. I-I’ll, uh, be getting a translator implant for our next meeting. Oh, and these meetings will be unscheduled. I wish the best health to you and your baby; have a good day.”

With that, he quickly exited the room, and I followed him out of the house and gave a meek wave goodbye as I locked the door behind him. With him gone, I give myself a moment alone in the foyer to collect my simmering rage and put on a strong face for Wynef when I get back to the room.

*I can’t believe it. I can’t fucking believe it.* ***That’s*** *who they assigned for this!? No senior officer or- oh… he might be the only one tolerant of a fleet member right now,,,*

I return to the kitchen to see Wynef with new tear stains in her fur as Angie rubs her back in comfort. Angie and I trade places as she gets up and heads back to our bedroom. I also give Wynef some contact on her back as she turns her head to look at me with both eyes.

“Douglas, what did he mean by ‘if I’m keeping her’? What other option is there?”

*Damn, this is a perfect Angie conversation, and she just left! Okay,* ***okay***\*, I can talk about this one.\*

“Wynef, for humans pregnancies have a few… *options*. For example, in a case like yours, many would opt to… terminate the pregnancy, but at your stage that’s not an option unless a severe medical complication occurs. Of course, there’s also the regular route of having your baby and keeping her. What he was likely referring to is that you also have the option to give birth to the baby and then have her adopted if you want.”

Wynef lets her head fall back into the chair as I pull my hand out from behind her.

“Adopt? ***Adopt?!*** No… ***No***\*.\* I-I have been through the foster system; s-she will not have that. I’m here \*a-\*and I’m alive. She won’t have to worry about being alone.”

*Okay, Doug, we’re not going to cry right now. At least not without Angie crying with me.*

“I, uh, can see your aversion to having her adopted with the current galactic state and the immediate post-war, but desire for newborns is usually very high, and I know that adoption agencies will make sure she is placed into a very good home.”

“***Pred-shit***. All those orphanages are the same. Also, what did you mean by *terminating* the pregnancy?”

*Fuck, this is devolving as fast as I feared.*

“Oh, uh, terminate as in have a pregnancy abortion, which would of course kill the embryo.”

“***Kill*** the kit for no reason?”

“Not for ‘no reason,’ Wynef; c-cases like yours are usually… sensitive, and if not that, medical complications could kill the baby and then you. Was there not anything like that on Ulimtal?”

Wynef scrunches her nose as her eyes roll up and side-to-side

“Hmm… We ***did,*** but only for emergencies. With the Arxur, y-you can’t really afford to not have kits.”

*They force themselves to give birth because if not, they’ll run out of people because space lizard armies come down and eat everyone. Cool, just fucking great. Rest in Piss Federation and Dominion.*

“Like I said, that’s not an option for you as far along as you are.”

“***Good***.”

*Not exactly awesome, but whatever.*

Unwilling to argue any further with her, I glance towards the living room and wonder if Wynef would be willing to sit in the same room as Angie and I while we watch some shows. I start to get myself out of my chair, and Wynef’s ears fold back as she watches me stand up. I furrow my brow in worry at what might have her upset even more, but she quickly answers my internal question.

“D-Douglas, I’m sorry for arguing with you in your own home. I-I know that’s disrespectful and-”

“Nah, it’s perfectly fine. I’m allowed to be wrong in my own house, and you are always more than welcome to make sure I know when I am, as long as you’re not yelling at me or being mean about it. Besides that… ***this*** is more about you than me; my own opinion doesn’t matter much there.”

“I-I understand… but then where are you going?”

“Oh, I was just going to go to the living room to watch some shows; you are more than welcome to join Angie and me if you want.”

Wynef gives a slight nod and then slowly rises from her chair and walks behind me as I lead into the living room. We pass a table against the wall, and I notice as Wynef stops to take in the contents displayed on top. I stop myself and head back to her side as she pores over the all too many pictures that are arranged across the surface.

“Douglas, who are all these people? Is this your family? They all look so different…”

*She can tell how different we look? I guess she’s probably just a bit less face-blind than me.*

“Well, a few of them *are* extended family, but most are mine and Angie’s friends, mostly from the company we were previously employed with in Los Angeles. This is just a little memorial for all the people we lost in the bombings during the Battle of Earth.”

Wynef goes stiff as stone, and her shoulders lock at the mention of the bombings. I watch with hesitation as she slowly reaches out towards a picture of Angie’s cousin, but she stops short and jerks her hands back like the picture was a thousand degrees and glowing green.

“A-all of these humans, all of these ***people***, were your friends and family, a-and we killed them.”

“I-I’m not going to lie, this state might not have been bombed, but it’s… it’s been pretty tough. A-also let’s get one thing clear: there’s no ‘we’ for you when talking about the bombings; you didn’t have a choice in the matter, nor did you actually participate.”

Wynef practically growls at me as she turns away.

“B-but I did participate. I-I shot some human boy just because… because he was ***there***! It’s no different than the Arxur that killed ***my*** friends.”

“Your friends? On Ulimtal?”

“Y-yes, I had met them at the end of grade school when I was given more freedom outside of the orphanage, and then we all went to college together. L-last night I tried to find anything. B-but not even a cattle rescue database had any of them. No updates to their profiles since then. They’re all ***gone***.”

*There’s the truth! That’s why you slept like garbage!*

Wynef takes her pad off her hips and opens it to a photo album, and not far into her scrolling, she pulls up a picture of a much healthier-looking Wynef in the middle of a group of Krakotl and two dog-like Farsul people. Despite their biology not being as easy to read as our own, my brain can’t help but *know* how much happier Wynef looks in the photo. Wynef holds up her pad, and I watch as her focus flicks between the screen and the top of the table.

*Does she want them added? But…They* ***are*** *Krakotl and Farsul- no,* ***No,*** *those are just kids like her… Except they’re dead over worthless bullshit.*

“Hey, Wynef, do you want that picture added to the memorial?”

She takes her focus off the pictures and slowly turns a wide eye over to me along with an ear at full attention.

“But Jestlim, Jerlin, Kanlim, Kastla, and Kesen are *Kraktol;* are you sure you want them next to humans? What if you have other visitors and-”

*We’re on the same page then? Still doesn’t make it right.*

“Wynef, it’s a memorial for innocent people killed in the Battle of Earth; if you send me that picture, I’ll print it off right now, and we can go get a frame later today.”

Wynef’s teeth bite into her own lips and start to quiver as her eyes again tear up. She doesn’t bother to wipe away the tears as they start to fall and she stares out at the pictures in front of her.

“Thank you, Douglas, I would really like that. Thank you.”

*Of course, and damn anyone who comes in here and makes it a problem. Everyone lost someone in this war.*

At that moment, Angie rejoins us in the main room and sees Wynef in barely controlled sobs over the memorial. Wordlessly she comes to Wynef’s side and puts an arm around her, which I quickly copy. Rather than the further breakdown this triggered yesterday, Wynef somehow swiftly gets control of herself and manages to choke out a few words.

“I ***know*** I’m a total mess today, but I really do feel better being with you guys. T-thank you, thank you so much.”

Not able to think of a good response, I instead opt to just squeeze her harder, which Anglie follows quickly.

*I can’t guarantee everything is going to be perfect, Wynef, but we got you. We have your back as long as you’ll let us.*

Sound familiar?

Three months ago, I was scrolling through productivity content at 2AM (ironic, I know) when I stumbled across the whole ""5AM club"" thing. My first thought? ""These people are insane.""

But I was desperate. I felt like I was always behind, always stressed, never had time for myself. So I said screw it let's try this for 30 days.

Here's what actually happened:

Week 1: Pure hell. I'm not gonna lie. I wanted to quit every single morning. My body was in retaliating. But I stuck with it because I'm stubborn.

Week 2-3: Something shifted. I started looking forward to those quiet hours. No notifications. No chaos. Just me and my notes. It felt like I had peace for the first time in my life.

Week 4+: Life changer. I suddenly had 2-3 extra hours every day. I started reading again. Working out. Actually eating breakfast instead of grabbing whatever.

When you win the morning, you feel like you can win the day. That confidence carries over into everything else. I became the person who gets shit done instead of the person who talks about getting shit done.

Three things that made it stick:

1. Go to bed earlier (revolutionary, I know). If you're staying up till midnight, 5AM won't work.
2. Have something to look forward to. For me, it was that perfect cup of coffee and 30 minutes of reading. Find your thing.
3. Start gradually. Don't go from 8AM to 5AM overnight. Move it back 15 minutes every few days.

I'm not saying you need to become a 5AM person. But if you're feeling stuck and want those extra hours back in your life give it a shot for just one week.

It helped me become more productive and disciplined.

My reflection mocks me in the mirror. Wrinkled, jowly and gray. I stumble into the kitchen. My head thumps against the table where last night's bottle still sits next to a stack of bills. I pour myself a toxic brew of coffee and booze. Another day stretches before me like a barren wasteland. 

My mind keeps spiraling back to when I first arrived here, long time ago. So naive then. Never seen an ATM or driven in a car! Big city lights had dazzled me. And those hot university chicks, their eyes shimmering with confidence and mischief. How my balls twitched! Too scared to approach them though, so I just kept my nose buried in a ton of textbooks.

Fast forward three decades: divorced, estranged from my children who'd rather not set eyes on my sorry-ass existence. And a second marriage that turned out to be another dismal farce. Maybe it was my age catching up with me, but lately every day felt like trudging through quicksand. It's the realization that my life had been one long, spiraling shitshow from start to finish. Thirty years of humiliation, heartbreak and crushing ennui. 

The Covid pandemic five years ago had been my one brief period of bliss in the universal misery but now... I couldn't bear to see anyone else with a spring in their step. That shit-eating grin on the grocery cashier's face? Please. Every person I saw was an affront to my misanthropic sensibilities. If only some calamitous pandemic would come along once more and wipe everyone out. This city and its inhabitants could rot in hell. 

Then, the inevitable daily grind looms into view. Work. At least my boss and his yes-man lackey were vile enough that hating them made up for having to spend the day wallowing in my own despair.

I open my laptop to find an email from Ugly Fat Scumbag waiting for me like a viper in the weeds. A promotion? More nonsense: the man had no idea what he was doing, but by sucking up, the stars aligned in his favor. I click away at his message in a vain attempt to feign enthusiasm for his latest success. ""Hey congratulations mate. Onward and upward!"" 

The phone shrills its pathetic tune. Another useless call from my parents bawling their heads off. They were still alive somewhere out in the sticks. ""Why don't you come visit us?"" they moan. Couldn't they see their kid is already dead inside? ""I'll go, alright?! Just let me get my shite sorted first!"" I yell back at them, slamming down the phone before it could sting my ear anymore. 

Maybe someday everyone else would rot along with me in this cesspool, but until then I had my nightly wank-a-thons and the perverse joy derived from hating all these other clueless bastards, just as much as they'd no doubt hate me back.",2,1756983304.0,2meirl4meirl,0,0.75,False

1n86vh3,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1n86vh3/girl_forgotten_karin_slaughter/,"Girl, Forgotten - Karin Slaughter","Hey everyone! I've just finished diving into Karin Slaughter's *Girl, Forgotten*, and I wanted to share my honest thoughts with you, like we're just chatting over coffee. If you're looking for a gripping read, you can check out [Girl, Forgotten - Karin Slaughter](https://pdfhive.com/girl-forgotten-karin-slaughter/) to get started.

This book is a deep dive into the past of Andrea Oliver, who we first met in *Pieces of Her*. Now, Andrea is on a new path, training to become a U.S. Marshal, and part of her training involves protecting a judge who’s facing threats. But, as things often do in Karin Slaughter's world, this assignment stirs up a whole lot of old secrets, especially about Andrea’s own father and his mysterious past. It’s a story about uncovering hidden truths, family legacy, and how the past never truly stays buried. No spoilers here, but prepare for a journey that’s both a legal thriller and a very personal quest.

**What I Really Liked:**

Karin Slaughter has a way of writing that just pulls you right in, and this book is no exception. The pacing, for me, was spot on. It wasn't a non-stop sprint, but rather a compelling build-up of tension that kept me turning pages late into the night. I found myself absolutely hooked, always needing to know what twist was coming next.

The characters, especially Andrea, felt incredibly real and complex. You really get into her head, feeling her determination, her doubts, and her struggle with the shadows of her family’s history. It’s not always comfortable, but it makes for a truly engaging experience. Slaughter doesn’t shy away from the darker aspects of human nature, and that honesty is something I appreciate in a psychological thriller. The way she weaves together the present investigation with flashbacks to Andrea’s father’s past was brilliantly done, creating a rich, layered narrative.

**What Didn't Quite Land (for me):**

While I mostly loved the book, there were moments where the sheer darkness of the themes could feel a little overwhelming. Slaughter is known for her unflinching portrayal of violence and grim realities, and *Girl, Forgotten* certainly delivers on that. If you're someone who prefers lighter reads, or is sensitive to graphic descriptions, this might be a bit much at times. It didn't detract from my overall enjoyment, but it’s definitely something to be aware of going in. Sometimes, I just needed a little break from the intensity to process what I had read.

**Would I Recommend It? And For Whom?**

Absolutely, yes! If you're a fan of dark psychological thrillers, legal dramas, or stories that explore deep family secrets and the lasting impact of the past, then this book is definitely for you. It’s perfect for readers who enjoy authors like Tana French, Gillian Flynn, or, of course, Karin Slaughter’s other works. If you're new to the genre but curious, and don't mind a bit of grit, it could be a great entry point into more complex thrillers.

**Tips for New Readers Diving into Thrillers:**

If you're new to reading books like *Girl, Forgotten* or want to get more into thrillers, here are a few friendly tips:

1.  **Take Your Time:** Don’t feel pressured to read it all in one go. Sometimes, especially with intense books, it’s good to put it down for a bit, breathe, and come back. This helps you process the story without getting overwhelmed.
2.  **Embrace the Mystery:** Part of the fun is not knowing everything. Let yourself be confused, make guesses, and enjoy the ride as the author slowly reveals the puzzle pieces. Don't worry if you don't 'solve' it yourself!
3.  **Find Your Comfort Zone:** Not every thriller is for everyone. If one book is too dark or too slow for you, don’t give up on the genre. There are so many kinds of thrillers out there!
4.  **Discuss It!** Reading can be a solitary activity, but talking about a book with others can really enhance the experience. If you’ve read *Girl, Forgotten*, I’d love to hear your thoughts in the comments!

Reading is such a personal journey, and there’s no right or wrong way to do it. Just pick up a book, open it, and let the story take you away. If you’re ready to jump into Andrea’s compelling world, you can find the book here: [Girl, Forgotten - Karin Slaughter](https://pdfhive.com/girl-forgotten-karin-slaughter/). It’s a rewarding read for those who enjoy a story with depth and a truly thrilling mystery.

I hope this helps you decide if *Girl, Forgotten* is your next read! Happy reading, everyone.

The first instance: There was one line of dialogue that just wasn’t working.

Example (not from the actual script):

SYD
Took you long enough.

BEIB
What’re you talking about? I haven’t seen you since seven.

I cut Beib’s line and ran it through a text-to-voice generator. It played until “What’re you talking about? I haven’t seen…” — then froze and went, “Ooooooooo.”

I tried again. Same glitch. This stood out because I’ve been using this AI generator for two years, and it has never done that.

The second occurrence: My father’s car. On the way back from grabbing a coffee, the engine stalled. Weird, because the car has never had even a broken light issue. Yet the morning after the AI glitch, it just cut out.

The third and most peculiar: I woke up at 8 a.m. to the sound of a Spanish guitar strumming from the attic. The adjoining room was unoccupied at the time. There were also noises like someone crawling around up there.

I went to investigate and opened the attic door. A blackbird appeared, looking down at me. It had somehow gotten in through a gap in the gutter. From there, it hopped all over the guitar and fluttered around the nik naks.

I can’t help but feel these things are more than mere coincidence.

You shut the windows to block the dust, but then the room feels stuffy. You open them for “fresh air,” and boom ... pollution, smoke, or that strange neighbor’s cooking smell creeps in.

That’s why I started digging into air purifiers. Not because I love gadgets (okay, maybe a little), but because breathing shouldn’t feel like a gamble.

In **Part 1**, I covered 5 solid picks that work well for most Indian homes. But the list wasn’t complete. Some of you want smarter controls, some want budget hacks, and some of you (let’s be real) just want the *best-looking machine* that doesn’t kill your room vibe.

So here’s **Part 2** of my deep-dive into the best air purifiers in India. These 5 (plus a bonus pick) are the ones I’d actually look at twice before spending my money... worth reading through before you hit that ‘Buy Now’ button.

# 6. Xiaomi 4 Lite Smart Air Purifier

[🔗 Link](https://www.amazon.in/MI-Purifier-Efficiency-Airpollutants-Control-Alexa/dp/B0C1P65Y4H/?tag=rahulbhatia-21)

Xiaomi always plays the value-for-money card, and this one doesn’t disappoint. The 4 Lite Smart covers up to 462 sq ft... good enough for bedrooms and mid-sized living rooms. The HEPA + Carbon filter is strong enough to trap 99.99% of dust, viruses, and odors, and you get full smart control via app, Alexa, and Google Assistant.

**What I like:**

* Minimalist design that doesn’t scream “medical device” in your room.
* Real-time AQI display (so you don’t just “feel” the difference, you *see* it).
* Filter replacement reminders are a blessing (no more guessing).

**Who should buy:** If you’re someone who loves budget-smart gadgets but still wants reliability, this is the sweet spot. Perfect for first-time buyers.

# 7. AIRTH Air Purifier for AC (IIT-Bombay Technology)

[🔗 Link](https://www.amazon.in/AiRTH-Air-AC-Protection-CAM-white/dp/B0BGLXHD8V/?tag=rahulbhatia-21)

Now, this one is quirky ... it’s not a standalone purifier, but a HEPA AC filter designed by IIT-Bombay folks. Basically, it upgrades your existing AC into an air purifier. You just insert the filter in your split/window AC, and surprise ... double duty.

**What I like:**

* Super cost-effective if you already run your AC often.
* Japanese filter media (fancy but effective).
* Targets **PM2.5, germs, and allergies** specifically.

**Who should buy:** People who don’t want another big gadget cluttering their room but still need protection. Especially good for office setups or bedrooms with AC running.

# 8. Philips AC1711 Air Purifier

[🔗 Link](https://www.amazon.in/Philips-AC1711-Purifier-Allergens-Bedrooms/dp/B0CW1SZV6L/?tag=rahulbhatia-21)

Philips has always been in the top league, and the AC1711 is a great mid-range purifier. With CADR 300 m³/h, it comfortably handles up to 380 sq ft, making it bedroom-perfect. Plus, it’s ultra-quiet ... almost library-level silent at night.

**What I like:**

* Philips’ filter quality is always reliable.
* Low power consumption (won’t shock you on your electricity bill).
* Subtle design that blends into the room.

**Who should buy:** If you want a **no-drama, reliable purifier** that works year after year without much fuss, this is it.

# 9. Philips GoPure 5211 Car Air Purifier

[🔗 Link](https://www.amazon.in/Philips-Automotive-Purifier-Indicator-GP521BLKX1/dp/B0BRBFTYQ4/?tag=rahulbhatia-21)

Cars are gas chambers on wheels during traffic. This compact purifier is specially made for cars, filtering PM2.5, toxic gases, NO2/SO2 fumes, and comes with an AQI indicator.

**What I like:**

* HEPA + HESA filter combo (great for both dust *and* gases).
* Compact and sleek — doesn’t look out of place in the car.
* Airmid certified filter (fancy way of saying it’s actually tested legit).

**Who should buy:** Daily commuters, Uber/Ola drivers, or honestly anyone stuck in traffic more than 30 minutes a day. You’ll feel the difference.

# 10. acerpure Pro Air Purifier (AP551-50W)

[🔗 Link](https://www.amazon.in/protection-Generator-eliminates-pollutants-AP551-50W/dp/B09M365JXN/?tag=rahulbhatia-21)

This one’s Acer’s jump into lifestyle gadgets, and they’ve nailed it. It has a 4-in-1 HEPA filter system, negative ion generator, and a smart sensor that automatically adjusts purification speed. Coverage is solid, and it’s whisper quiet at just 25dB.

**What I like:**

* Negative ion feature (helps freshen up indoor air).
* Child safety lock (no accidental button mashing).
* Sleek tower design that fits tight spaces.

**Who should buy:** If you want something modern-looking with **smart safety features**, this is a good long-term pick.

# ⭐ Bonus Pick: Bepure B1 Air Purifier

[🔗 Link](https://www.amazon.in/Bepure-B1-Air-Purifier-convenience/dp/B0B2RTC5CT/?tag=rahulbhatia-21)

Not as big a brand name as Philips or Xiaomi, but the Bepure B1 is honestly a hidden gem. It covers up to 500 sq ft, has a True HEPA H13 filter, and even comes with a remote control (convenience flex).

**What I like:**

* Higher coverage area for the price.
* Four-stage filtration = serious cleaning power.
* Surprisingly good reviews for a less-famous brand.

**Who should buy:** If you’re hunting for **value + performance** and don’t mind trying a newer brand. Great option for living rooms.

>💡 **Pro tip before buying:** Always check **filter replacement cost and availability**. A purifier is only as good as its filters, and some models have pricier replacements than the purifier itself.

This was **Part 2 of my “10 Best Home Air Purifiers in India” guide**. If you missed **Part 1 (the first 5 models)**, I’ve dropped the link in the comments ... go check that before finalizing your pick.

Or maybe just a spicy ebook about that unsolved murder case you can’t stop Googling at 3 a.m. Either way, you quickly realize two things:

1. Writing is hard.
2. Writing *true crime* without sounding like ChatGPT on autopilot is even harder.

That’s where a **professional true crime ghostwriter** comes in.

A real ghostwriter knows how to:

* Dig into credible sources (not just Wikipedia rabbit holes).
* Build suspense without inventing facts.
* Make sure your killer doesn’t sound like a B-movie villain written by AI after three cups of virtual coffee.
* Give your book the *Netflix documentary vibe*, but on paper (or Kindle).

# Why not just let AI do it?

Sure, you *could* ask an AI to “write me a true crime book.” It’ll give you something that looks like a book, smells like a book, and reads like… well, like a **high school essay graded by a robot**. Google and ChatGPT are smart, but they’re also trained to avoid saying things like *“and then the suspect chopped off his…”* — you know, the juicy stuff.

A human ghostwriter balances storytelling, sensitivity, and research. Plus, they won’t accidentally confuse your serial killer with a pizza delivery guy from another case (true story, I’ve seen AI try it).

# Why hire instead of DIY?

Because unless you have the time, discipline, and nerves to read court transcripts until your eyes bleed, you’ll probably give up by chapter three. A **professional ghostwriter** will do the heavy lifting, so you get:

* A polished manuscript that sounds like *you*, but better.
* A market-ready book optimized for readers who devour *true crime* on Kindle Unlimited.
* SEO-friendly descriptions that actually pop up when people search *true crime books* on Google or even ChatGPT.

In short: hiring a true crime ghostwriter isn’t cheating, it’s smart outsourcing. Just like hiring a hitman… except, you know, legal. ",1,1756982647.0,u_Extreme-Minimum-9871,0,1.0,False

Here’s how to actually find them.,"Most people look for jobs by updating their LinkedIn profiles and sending out tons of resumes, usually to never hear back. The problem is that up to 70% of jobs are never posted online. This hidden job market is where the best work-from-home opportunities are expected to be in [2025.Here](http://2025.Here)'s how you can access it:

1.  Referrals are very important. People are four times more likely to get hired if someone recommends them. Make a list of companies you want to work for and find at least one current employee to have a coffee chat with once a week. Instead of just asking for a referral, find ways to get involved, have genuine conversations, and show your value.
    
2.  Communities are very valuable. Good jobs often appear in online groups, such as Slack groups (Tech Ladies, Work At Home Hub), and plenty of subreddits, before they are posted for everyone to see.
    
3.  Career pages are often more effective than job boards. Save 10 company pages you like and check their job pages once a week. They often post jobs there before putting them on LinkedIn.
    
4.  Reaching out to companies directly is often effective. Sending a polite email or message to a hiring manager explaining how you can help often gets attention before a job is even open.
    
5.  Use both automation and networking. Do not just apply to hundreds of jobs without thinking or talk to people without following up. The real trick is to do both together.
    

Tools can help:

Bottom line: Stop only competing for jobs on public job boards where there are over 1,000 resumes. The best opportunities are often found in the hidden job market—through referrals, community connections, and direct outreach. Add smart tools to help, and you will get interviews much faster.",0,1756982540.0,remoteworks,0,0.5,False

I pour myself a toxic brew of coffee and booze. Another day stretches before me like a barren wasteland. 

My mind keeps spiraling back to when I first arrived here, long time ago. So naive then. Never seen an ATM or driven in a car! Big city lights had dazzled me. And those hot university chicks, their eyes shimmering with confidence and mischief. How my balls twitched! Too scared to approach them though, so I just kept my nose buried in a ton of textbooks.

Fast forward three decades: divorced, estranged from my children who'd rather not set eyes on my sorry-ass existence. And a second marriage that turned out to be another dismal farce. Maybe it was my age catching up with me, but lately every day felt like trudging through quicksand. It's the realization that my life had been one long, spiraling shitshow from start to finish. Thirty years of humiliation, heartbreak and crushing ennui. 

The Covid pandemic five years ago had been my one brief period of bliss in the universal misery but now... I couldn't bear to see anyone else with a spring in their step.

""Hey congratulations mate. Onward and upward!"" 

The phone shrills its pathetic tune. Another useless call from my parents bawling their heads off. They were still alive somewhere out in the sticks. ""Why don't you come visit us?"" they moan. Couldn't they see their kid is already dead inside? ""I'll go, alright?! Just let me get my shite sorted first!"" I yell back at them, slamming down the phone before it could sting my ear anymore. 

Maybe someday everyone else would rot along with me in this cesspool, but until then I had my nightly wank-a-thons and the perverse joy derived from hating all these other clueless bastards, just as much as they'd no doubt hate me back.",1,1756982538.0,RawAbsurdity,0,1.0,False

Over the last decade, there has been a growing concern regarding the rising concentration and declining competition of the U.S. economy. Many people argue that we live in an era of “monopoly capitalism” — with few firms holding immense economic and political power. You can hear that from the usual suspects — [Robert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLfO-2t1qPQ) [Reich](https://robertreich.substack.com/p/why-are-we-still-suffering-inflation), [Adam Conover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayrVYwoe-DY) or even [Joseph Stiglitz](https://rooseveltinstitute.org/blog/america-has-a-monopoly-problem-and-its-huge/). With these concerns, there has been a renewed focus on antitrust laws and their ability to ensure competition in the market. Standard arguments that this concentration stifles innovation and harms consumers have been reinvigorated. Some people added concerns about the political and economic power of these companies and and their effects on democracy itself. But are these concerns justified? And how much (and what) antitrust action do we really need? To find answers we need to look deeper.

# Is the American economy becoming more concentrated?

The American economy is becoming more concentrated — if you have read the media or listened to politicians over the last decade you probably encountered this statement a lot. It was also one of the main assumptions driving a lot of President Biden’s economic policy agenda. But is it true? First I’ll look at the evidence of concentration in the broad US economy. Next, I’ll look at some specific sectors. I’ll focus mainly on product markets and ignore labor markets (maybe I’ll write another post about it sometime).

Economists understood for a long time that measuring the market concentration of the entire economy in a meaningful way is very difficult. There are two major issues with the measurement of market concentration. The first one is conceptual and involves the difficulty of defining relevant markets for assessing market shares, which is especially hard to do on an economy-wide basis. The second issue involves problems with the availability and reliability of relevant data. Unfortunately, a lot of studies don’t address these issues sufficiently. We’ll come back to these issues with more detail later.

Once you resolve these issues and have a reasonably defined market with sufficiently reliable data you can start to measure the concentration level in the economy. There are two main ways of doing this. One way is to measure the concentration ratio of some fixed number of top firms — usually it's revenue share of 4 (C4) or 5 (C5) largest companies. The problem with this approach is that it doesn’t tell you anything about the concentration of market share among other firms (other than top 4 or 5 firms). Another common approach is something called Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI). It’s calculated by squaring the market share of each firm competing in the market and then summing the resulting numbers. HHI is represented as a number between 0 and 10000 with 10000 being the completely monopolized market with one firm capturing all the revenue (the lower the number the less concentrated the market is).

# 2016 CEA report

We can start by looking at the popular [Council of Economic Advisers report](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/page/files/20160414_cea_competition_issue_brief.pdf) from 2016 that was widely reported as evidence that the US economy is getting more concentrated. The report notes that the majority of industries have seen increases in the revenue share enjoyed by the 50 largest firms (CR50). It is shown in their Table 1.

[Council of Economic Advisers “Benefits of Competition and Indicators of Market Power” 2016](https://preview.redd.it/mnrqei5ki4nf1.jpg?width=946&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ce7a7597f70cf7fc6a00e4c64ac5c7b73d77aece)

It’s not clear, however, whether this tells us much about the level of concentration in the American economy. There are a couple of reasons for why these concentration ratios may not be very informative in this regard.

* The concentration ratios are calculated at a very broad level of industry aggregation (two-digit NAICS codes), which may not reflect the relevant markets where consumers and producers interact. For example, within retail trade (NAICS 44-45), there are many different subsectors such as grocery stores, clothing stores, or online retailers, each with different degrees of concentration and competition. The observed trends may simply reflect expansion of successful companies into related fields of business, to the benefit of consumers.
* The concentration ratios are calculated at a national level, which may not capture the geographic variation in market conditions within the country and may simply reflect beneficial expansion of successful businesses into new geographical markets.
* The concentration measure that is used (CR50) is not very informative. Markets can be quite competitive with far fewer than 50 firms and that’s why most industrial economists prefer using measures like HHI, CR4 or CR5.[1](https://drthad.substack.com/p/myth-of-monopoly-capitalism#footnote-1-108928492)

The CEA recognized the shortcomings of its Table 1, emphasizing that national-level concentration data do not automatically indicate increased market power. As they noted:

>

However, many who cited the report failed to acknowledge this nuance. While Table 1 reflects the growing role of large firms in the economy, it does not provide meaningful insights into competition at relevant market levels. A firm’s size alone does not imply reduced competition or greater market power.

# Other reports based on Economic Census data

There have been several more reports that appear to document growing concentration of the U.S. economy. *The Economist* in 2016 published a 2016 chart called “A Widespread Effect”, illustrating changes in the four-firm concentration ratio (CR4) across 893 U.S. industries between 1997 and 2012.

[The Economist “Corporate concentration” 2016](https://preview.redd.it/lqfih1eti4nf1.jpg?width=726&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=915e5188e95a88c4829a8f34c4d9f0fe90feb23d)

This chart, based on Economic Census data, classifies industries under four-digit NAICS codes, making it more specific than the broad two-digit classifications used by the CEA. However, even these categories do not generally align with the relevant markets used in antitrust analysis. The chart highlights national-level increases in CR4 across numerous industries. For instance, the CR4 for full-service restaurants increased slightly from 8% to 9%, health insurance from 20% to 34%, airlines from 25% to 65%, supermarkets from 21% to 31%, and wired telecommunications carriers from 47% to 51%. At first glance, this may seem like strong evidence of growing concentration, but it is crucial to consider the geographic nature of competition in these industries. Many of the industries reported in *The Economist* operate at the local level, meaning that measuring their concentration at a national scale can provide a misleading picture. A rising national CR4 does not necessarily mean that competition within individual geographic markets has decreased. Moreover, the rise of national firms capturing a greater share of revenue does not necessarily indicate reduced competition. In many cases, this shift reflects greater efficiency, better service, and lower prices benefiting consumers (we will get to this point in more detail later). While some view the decline of small, local firms as problematic, competition policy should rather focus on consumer welfare rather than protecting smaller competitors from more efficient rivals.

[Peltzman (2014](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/675719)) analyzed in-depth long-term concentration trends in the manufacturing sector from 1963 to 2007. He finds no significant change from 1963 to 1982 but notes an increase after merger enforcement was relaxed in 1982. The median HHI in manufacturing industries rose from 565 in 1982 to 662 in 2002, with consumer goods showing higher levels than producer goods. However, Peltzman does not equate this rise with reduced competition, acknowledging that moderate concentration increases can coexist with greater competition due to economies of scale and firm efficiency differences. It is also crucial to recognize that the Economic Census data, that the analyses above are based on, only account for production at domestic establishments and exclude imports, which have significantly increased over the past two decades. This omission distorts perceptions of market concentration by ignoring the impact of foreign competition.

# Reports and research based on Compustat data

Other data that is frequently used to measure concentration trends come from Compustat. The reason for that is often that the data from the Economic Census is both limited and lagging, with official statistics only released twice per decade, while Compustat provides annual updates.

[Grullon, Larkin, and Michaely (2019)](https://academic.oup.com/rof/article-abstract/23/4/697/5477414) attempted to measure concentration trends by analyzing the Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI) at the three-digit NAICS level using Compustat data. Their analysis shows that concentration declined in the 1980s and early 1990s, surged in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and then rose gradually afterward (median increase in the HHI between 1997 and 2014 was 41 percent, while the average increase was 90 percent and over 75% of U.S. industries experiencing an increase in concentration levels). Below is the plot of their findings.

[Grullon, Larkin, and Michaley “Are US Industries Becoming More Concentrated?” 2019](https://preview.redd.it/5nxnhge0l4nf1.jpg?width=481&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=81d38eb2eb2bcb53a3526714d44b35a2f20a011a)

Similarly, [Brauning, Fillat, and Joaquim (2022)](https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/current-policy-perspectives/2022/cost-price-relationships-in-a-concentrated-economy.aspx) suggest that the U.S. economy became at least 50% more concentrated between 2005 and 2018, correlating this rise with higher prices. They also use HHI at the three-digit NAICS level. Another widely cited study using Compustat data is [De Loecker and Eeckhout (2020)](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/135/2/561/5714769), which found that markups increased from 18% to 67% between 1980 and 2017, attributing this trend to growing market power.

Reliance on Compustat data for measuring market concentration encounters some important problems:

* Compustat includes only publicly traded companies, omitting private firms that constitute a significant portion of the U.S. economy.
* It assigns a single industry code to each firm based on its primary line of business, failing to account for diversified operations across multiple sectors.
* The dataset records worldwide sales figures, which is misleading for analysis of domestic market concentration.

Because of this and other flaws Compustat data can’t replicate concentration measures that we get from Economic Census data. Paper from the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/a-note-on-industry-concentration-measurement-20230203.html) highlights this, showing low correlations between them. Specifically, correlations for top-firm concentration ratios between the two datasets are generally below 0.2. Limitations of Compustat data for the purposes of measuring concentration is well-known and has been explored in many articles.[2](https://drthad.substack.com/p/myth-of-monopoly-capitalism#footnote-2-108928492)

# Concentration trends on the national industry level

If we look beyond Compustat data for public companies and include private ones, and consider concentration at the national level what do we see?

Fortunately there is some data and research on this. [Autor, Dorn, Katz, Patterson, and Van Reenen (2020)](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/135/2/645/5721266) use U.S. Census panel data that includes both public and private firms at the firm and establishment levels. Their analysis show the sales-weighted average sales- and employment-based CR4 and CR20 measures of concentration across four-digit industries for each of the six major sectors — manufacturing, retail trade, wholesale trade, services, utilities and transportation, and finance. Results are shown below.

https://preview.redd.it/0f01ky07l4nf1.jpg?width=1456&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d004b677f112a40f4e7e204885f34e2ef1246f96

In their [appendix](https://www.ddorn.net/papers/ADKPV-SuperstarFirms-Appendix.pdf) they also show an average HHI for the same sectors. Here’s how it looks like

https://preview.redd.it/hohrm1jbl4nf1.jpg?width=678&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ff3122f658a13fa3f1bf5ababf46b0da9336f37

While HHI shows somewhat smaller increases than CR4 or CR20, both show similar picture — rising concentration, at least in retail, services, utilities and transportation and finance. As the authors put it:

>

It’s important to note the magnitude of these increases in concentration. None of the the HHI levels are particularly concerning — markets with HHI below 1000 are typically classified as unconcentrated and only the service sector is above that threshold.

# Maybe not much more concentrated

So far we’ve looked at the evidence showing somewhat rising concentration and noted some methodological problems. But is there other evidence showing contrary picture? Well, yes.

This line of research can be summarized in a couple of points.

1. [Benkard, Yurukoglu, and Zhang (2021)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w28745) suggest that determining whether concentration has been rising or falling depends critically on the boundaries one draws between different markets. While from the producer’s perspective evidence suggests rising levels of concentration, if we take the consumers perspective we see the decline in concentration levels. Researchers find that the median HHI fell from 2,265 in 1994 to 1,945 in 2019. Similarly, the 90th percentile HHI declined from 5,325 to 4,570 over the same period. In 1994, 44.4% of all industries fell into the highly concentrated category. By 2019, that figure had dropped to 36.6%, indicating a broad-based reduction in concentration across the economy. So their “consumer perspective” shows actually higher concentration levels, but the opposite trend — instead of increase in concentration, it shows a decrease.
2. Most of the research looked at data at the national level, but it’s questionable whether this is the appropriate market to consider. A lot, if not most, product markets are local (coffee shop in Brooklyn doesn’t compete with the one in Los Angeles). [Rossi-Hansberg, Sarte, and Trachter (2021)](https://www.princeton.edu/~erossi/DTNLC.pdf) find divergent trends in concentration in local and national level. It’s best captured in their Figure 1 (picture in original blog post). While the national level data shows slight increase, more local measures show downward trend —the more local the sharper decline in concentration. Now, this types of local data sources are scarce and not completely reliable. This one for example has a lot of imputed data. Some other papers using different, more complete and reliable data sources find that these trends do not diverge, but unfortunately they usually focus on one specific industry because of data limitations (for example [Smith and Ocampo (2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07609)) for retail). 
3. A lot of products market are local, but other are arguably global. One of the biggest changes in the economy over the last 40 years have been globalization. American firms now compete not only with other domestic companies, but also foreign ones. It is therefore important to account for import for better view of concentration trends. [Amiti and Heise (2021)](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr968.pdf) find, using confidential census data for the manufacturing sector, that typical measures of concentration, once adjusted for sales by foreign exporters, actually stayed constant between 1992 and 2012.

Now, none of this research is conclusive, but it shows us that we need to carefully examine methodological and data issues before we reach any conclusion.

**Summing up**: there is some evidence that concentration has risen somewhat, although it varies a lot by industry and depends on the metric and data that is used. Nevertheless dramatic narratives about rising concentration levels don’t seem to be strongly supported by carefully examined data.

# Concentration doesn’t necessarily mean less competition

So far I wrote about the trends in concentration levels, but that's not what is really interesting for us. The thing we should be concerned about is the level of *competition* in the economy and that's not exactly the same thing. In fact, concentration levels alone tell us very little about how competitive the economy actually is.

When markets experience rising concentration over time, two competing interpretations emerge with substantially different policy implications. The first option is that increasing concentration is the result or the cause of weakening competitive forces, with few firms gaining market share in a way that stifles competition. The second interpretation offers an alternative explanation: rising concentration may actually reflect competition working effectively, where more productive firms providing superior value to customers naturally gain market share over time through operational efficiency, innovation and better services rather than anti-competitive behavior.

This is not just an abstract “well, actually” point raised in order to distract us from an “obvious” fact than trends in concentration over the last couple of decades coincided with declining competition. There are a lot of theoretical and empirical reasons to expect competition leading to an *increase* in concentration.

Consider markets with high search and switching costs, where consumers remain locked to existing suppliers, because it’s costly or inconvenient to look elsewhere. As those frictions fall (thanks to better information platforms, streamlined distribution, new technology or lower transportation costs) consumers can compare offerings and switch to the lowest-cost, highest-quality providers with ease. Small firms lose ground, while bigger, more efficient firms gain market share. Concentration is high, but economy remains competitive. This is what we tend to see in the data. [Goldmanis, Hortaçsu, Syverson and Emre (2010)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/authored-by/Horta%C3%A7su/Ali) document that the advent of powerful price-comparison tools reallocated sales to the lowest-cost sellers, boosting concentration while consumer prices fell.

# Is the American economy getting less competitive?

The question we actually care about is whether the American economy became less competitive over the last couple of decades. Even assuming that concentration actually went up meaningfully (which isn’t so obvious), does it reflect “decline-in-competition” hypothesis or “competition-in-action” hypothesis? Or maybe a bit of both?

# Markups

One way to answer these question is to look at the the *price/cost markup*, which is the ratio of price to marginal cost. This is a direct approach to measuring market power (increasing market power would support the “decline-in-competition” hypothesis) —firms are defined to have market power if they are able to profitably set prices above marginal costs. Still, even if we would observe rising markups it doesn’t necessarily mean that competition is declining — as with concentration trends, rising markups could be caused by competitive forces, and to determine causes we would need to examine them closely.

There are two leading approaches to the estimation of price/cost markups — the “demand approach” and the “production approach”.

* **Demand approach**: This approach works by studying how customers respond to different prices for a product, which helps researchers understand how much pricing power a company actually has. The basic idea is straightforward: if you can measure how sensitive customers are to price changes (called demand elasticity), you can figure out what markup the company should charge to maximize profits. The method requires detailed sales and pricing data for specific products and makes assumptions about how companies compete with each other — whether they're in a market with many similar competitors or just a few major players (think particular model of competition — e.g. monopolistic competition or an oligopoly model). This technique has worked well in focused industry studies (such as studying markups for ready-to-eat cereal, airlines, etc.), but applying it across the entire economy becomes extremely challenging due to the massive data requirements and the need to model each industry's unique competitive dynamics.
* **Production approach**: This approach infers markups from production and cost data, and it was popularized by a seminal paper from [De Loecker, Eeckhout, and Unger (2020)](https://www.janeeckhout.com/wp-content/uploads/26.pdf) (DEU). The idea, building on [Hall (1988)](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/261570) and [De Loecker and Warzynski (2012)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.102.6.2437), is that you can use a producer’s input choices to back out the markup. Under competitive market conditions, an input's cost share (such as labor expenses) should equal that input's output elasticity — essentially, its contribution to overall production. However, when firms possess market power, they typically reduce output levels, causing the cost share to fall below the actual elasticity. By estimating production functions to determine output elasticities and examining expenditure shares from standard accounting records, researchers can calculate the implied markup The beauty of this method is that it doesn’t require specifying a demand curve or even observing prices and quantities separately — you can use firms’ financial data, which is available for many companies over many years, to get a broad measure of markups. That’s why this approach can be applied to large samples of firms across the economy.

Using a production-based approach, (DEU) estimated that the sales-weighted average markup for U.S. firms rose from about 1.21 in 1980 to roughly 1.61 in 2016. In other words, the typical premium over marginal cost moved from 21 % to 61 % — an increase of a little over 30 percentage points. The study gained substantial popularity and has been since wildly cited as evidence of a broad uptick in market power. Researchers and advocates have used these results to explain the decline in labor’s share of income, rising inequality, muted investment, and slower productivity growth, arguing that weaker competition has given firms greater leverage over consumers and workers.

However, as with concentration, these headline results on markups have been hotly debated. A series of follow-up papers pointed out potential issues with the DEU approach and offered different findings:

* Traina (2018) shows that using COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) as a proxy for variable cost is too narrow because parts of SG&A (selling, general and administrative expenses) — marketing, R&D, some headquarters labor — scale with output. So when a reasonable share of SG&A is treated as variable as well (and not as fixed like in DEU), the long-run rise in markups largely disappears and can even turn slightly negative, implying sensitivity to accounting definitions and a shift toward intangibles rather than greater pricing power.
* DEU, like the Compustat-based concentration studies, only covered publicly traded firms. If public firms increased their markups but a lot of economic activity shifted to private firms or new entrants with lower markups, the aggregate markup could be flatter. Additionally, within the DEU data, the increase in markups was very skewed – a subset of high-markup firms pulled up the average, while the median markup increased much less. So it’s possible that superstar firms gained pricing power in some markets, even as many other firms did not.
* The production-based method hinges on correctly estimating output elasticities which is not an easy task. Allowing these elasticities to vary by industry/firm and over time, as in Foster, Haltiwanger, and Tufano (2023), removes most of the upward drift and in the most flexible specification yields a slight decline, suggesting earlier estimates may have conflated technological change with market power.
* Technological and organizational shifts like automation, IT adoption, and supply-chain improvements have pushed marginal costs down faster than prices in many sectors. This causes measured markups to rise mechanically even when competition remains unchanged, while consumers still benefit through lower prices or better quality.
* Industry evidence is mixed: in consumer packaged goods, markups rise mainly through cost reductions with only modest increases in brand premia. In cement, consolidation plus precalciner kilns lowers costs while prices stay roughly flat, nudging markups up for efficiency reasons (Miller et al. 2023). In steel, the spread of mini-mills intensifies entry and pushes markups down (Collard-Wexler & De Loecker 2015). In autos (1980–2018), once quality improvements are accounted for, markups decline as marginal costs rise faster than prices.
* Because higher markups can reflect either surplus rents or cost-saving innovation and quality change, they are not, on their own, decisive evidence of weaker competition or lax antitrust. Any welfare conclusions should depend on the mechanism behind the price-cost ratio.

So evidence is much more mixed if you look at the broad literature and conclusions hinge heavily on specific assumptions and methodological choices. It’s unwise to make a claim that markups evidence strongly supports rising market power story and lower levels of competition.

# Technological progress

Let’s et aside measurement issues and assume average price–cost markups have risen across many U.S. industries. How should we interpret that?

One popular reading is weaker rivalry — e.g., mergers raising concentration and softening price competition — which leads to calls for tougher antitrust enforcement. But as mentioned earlier, higher markups, like higher concentration, can also emerge from consumer-benefiting technological change. Therefore it’s important to know why markups rose.

Consider an industry where markups rose because low-cost, high-markup firms expanded as trade barriers fell or technology enabled geographic scale. That looks like “competition-in-action”: efficient “superstar” firms pass some, but not all, cost savings to consumers via lower prices. Decompositions in DEU and [Autor, Dorn, Katz, Patterson, and Van Reenen (2020)](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/135/2/645/5721266) show revenue reallocating within sectors toward high-markup firms, the primary driver of average markup increases. [Ganapati (2021)](https://www.sganapati.com/files/Ganapati_2021_AEJM_Growing_Oligopolies.pdf) finds rising profitability correlates with rising productivity across sectors.

Markups can rise while consumers benefit when firms cut marginal costs or raise quality. With less-than-full pass-through, prices can fall, output can rise, and welfare can improve even as markups increase. New products can have the same effect — patents and copyrights are designed to encourage such investments. Industry-specific studies surveyed in [Miller (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167718724000869) often identify technological progress as the dominant force behind measured markup changes. This is not always the case, obviously. In some industries, mergers raised prices, and some likely faced undetected collusion. In others, technology or globalization drove margins. There is no reason to believe a single mechanism explains rising markups across most industries.

This heterogeneity is why industrial-organization economists moved toward detailed, industry-specific studies that model actual market features, allow richer heterogeneity, and relax restrictive functional forms.

The bottom line is that to assess market failure and appropriate antitrust enforcement, one must identify the mechanism at work in the industry in question. Overhauling competition policy on the blanket assumption that rising price–cost markups signal declining competition is unwarranted and could be counterproductive.

# Conclusions

There are definitely sectors of the economy that show growing monopoly power — parts of telecom and healthcare come to mind. Yet the broader evidence does not indicate a pervasive decline in competition in the U.S. economy. As one recent comprehensive review states: “the empirical evidence relating to concentration trends, markup trends, and the effects of mergers does not actually show a widespread decline in competition”[3](https://drthad.substack.com/p/myth-of-monopoly-capitalism#footnote-3-108928492). Much of what we observe looks like “competition-in-action”: many big firms became large by outperforming rivals, not by suppressing them.

This doesn’t mean everything is perfect and that we don’t need any stronger antitrust action, but it shows that we should be precise and targeted about reforms and use of antitrust tools. Studying individual markets and assessing them on their own basis is hard, but at the same time much more productive than sweeping claims about monopoly capitalism killing the economy.

Overall, the narrative of a sweeping decline in competitiveness of the U.S. economy appears overstated when the evidence is examined closely. Aggregate concentration has increased modestly, yet in many industries it remains at levels that do not, by themselves, signal a serious competition problem, and much of the rise can be traced to benign forces such as technological progress, globalization, and efficient firms scaling up. The intensity of rivalry and pressure on firms has not clearly diminished and in some ways (owing to technology and globalization) competition has intensified. High concentration in particular markets often reflects competitive processes (the best firms winning) rather than collusion and other anti-competitive practices. Ultimately, what matters for consumers and the broader economy is less the raw number of firms than how contestable and fair markets are. The research indicates that, aside from some pockets deserving attention, competition in the U.S. is very much alive, and broad claims of a generalized “monopoly problem” overstate a more nuanced, sector-by-sector reality.

It’s an 8 year blend of lightly peated bourbon aged in small barrels, then blended for 18 more months in a 53 gallon barrel.  It’s hazmat all day at 79.1% alc.

Nose: away from the glass - cherry cola/ Dr. Pepper syrup, bright oak, coffee, alcohol, apple cider vinegar.  Deep in the glass - musty oak, big burn(did I mention HAZMAT), sweetness is non existent

Palate: big heat, big cherry, some of the bright oak and also some musty oak.  Second sip tones down the heat, coffee and chocolate notes emerge

Finish: first sip straight burn forever.  The following sips add a cherry sweetness but damn does it scorch the tongue

This is definitely going to be a divisive, love it or hate it bottle.  It’s not the most complex, but it’s a banger. I happen to love it, even being someone who is gravitating away from super high proof juice.  It’s only available at the distillery but if you’re in the area, check it out, it’s great

1n86lx1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Momzfashion/comments/1n86lx1/snuggles_snacks_sanity_everyday_family_life/,"Snuggles, Snacks & Sanity: Everyday Family Life","Family life is beautiful, busy, loud, and sometimes a little crazy. Between school drop-offs, snack times, work deadlines, playdates, and bedtime routines, parents are often left wondering—*how do we keep our sanity while still making space for love and joy?* The truth is, everyday family life doesn’t have to be perfect. It just has to be real, full of snuggles, snacks, and little moments of connection.

In this post, we’ll explore the everyday ups and downs of family life, how to keep your sanity, why snacks matter more than you think, and how snuggles bring everything back into perspective. We’ll keep it simple, warm, and conversational—because parenting already gives you enough to juggle.

# Why Family Life Feels Busy (and Beautiful)

If you feel like your days are packed, you’re not imagining it. According to a Pew Research Center study, **70% of parents say parenting is harder than they expected.** Life today moves fast, and families are balancing more than ever. But even in the middle of the busy, there’s beauty.

* The sound of kids laughing in the living room.
* The smell of cookies in the oven.
* The feeling of tired but happy hugs at the end of the day.

These little things make the chaos worth it.

# Snuggles: The Power of Connection

Snuggles may seem small, but they mean a lot. Physical touch builds connection, reduces stress, and strengthens family bonds.

* **Science says:** Studies from UCLA show that hugs release oxytocin, often called the “love hormone,” which makes people feel happier and safer.
* **Kids need it:** Snuggles help children feel secure and loved. Even older kids benefit from hugs, back pats, or cozy moments.
* **Parents too:** Snuggles help parents relax and feel connected, even on stressful days.

So, never underestimate a cuddle on the couch or a quick hug before bed.

# Snacks: More Than Just Food

Snacks keep kids fueled, but they also create opportunities for connection.

* **Family bonding:** Sharing popcorn during a movie or apple slices after school gives kids a chance to talk about their day.
* **Nutrition matters:** According to the CDC, **over 36% of children eat fast food daily.** Making healthier snacks at home, like fruit, cheese, or yogurt, supports growth and energy.
* **Sanity saver:** Having simple snacks ready prevents meltdowns (for kids and sometimes parents, too!).

Snack time isn’t just about eating—it’s about slowing down and being together.

# Sanity: Finding Balance in Family Life

Parenting can be overwhelming. Between work, chores, and raising kids, it’s easy to feel stretched thin. But keeping your sanity is possible with small steps.

# 1. Lower Expectations

Your house doesn’t need to be spotless. Your kids don’t need perfect schedules. Give yourself grace.

# 2. Find Routines That Work

Morning and bedtime routines reduce stress for everyone. Kids thrive on predictability, and parents enjoy fewer battles.

# 3. Take Breaks for Yourself

Even 10 minutes of quiet time with a cup of coffee or a short walk can refresh your mind.

# 4. Share Responsibilities

Parenting is a team job. Let kids help with age-appropriate chores and lean on your partner or support system.

# 5. Celebrate Small Wins

Did everyone eat dinner? Did you survive a tough day? That’s a win worth celebrating.

# Everyday Family Moments That Matter

* **Bedtime stories** that end with snuggles and giggles.
* **After-school snacks** where kids share their highs and lows.
* **Family dinners** where conversations flow, even if plates are messy.
* **Lazy weekends** where pajamas stay on until noon.

These simple moments add up to strong family bonds.

# Stats & Facts That Keep It Real

* Families who eat dinner together **5 or more nights a week** raise kids with better grades and emotional health (source: The Family Dinner Project).
* The average parent spends **37 minutes of quality time a day** with their kids (source: Office for National Statistics). Every minute counts.
* A hug lasting 20 seconds can lower stress levels and improve mood (source: Harvard Health).",1,1756982183.0,u_Momzfashion,0,1.0,False

# 🧾 Apple Pay Transaction Categorizer

* Input: Apple Pay (or any payment) data
* AI agent categorizes each transaction into **Primary/Secondary categories** (e.g., Transport → Taxi Services, Leisure → Coffee).
* Outputs structured rows in Google Sheets with categories **and the AI’s reasoning** for transparency.

👉 Result: Fully automated, well-organized expense tracking.

# 🔍 LinkedIn Lead Scraper Agent

* Uses Google Custom Search API to find **targeted LinkedIn profiles**.
* Cleans results into structured JSON (name, profile link, role/description).
* Appends into Google Sheets → ready for CRM or outreach.

👉 Result: A clean, usable **lead database** instead of messy scraped results.

# ⚡ What I Can Build for You

* 📨 **Email assistants** → summarize, flag urgent, draft replies.
* 📊 **Data sync pipelines** → Google Sheets ↔ Notion ↔ Slack ↔ CRMs.
* 🔍 **Lead gen agents** → scrape + filter prospects into a clean database.
* 📦 **Business process automations** → orders, notifications, reports.
* 📝 **Content pipelines** → long text → newsletters, social posts.

If you’ve got a process you wish you could “set and forget,” I can probably automate it.

# 💸 Pricing (clear & upfront)

* **Simple automations:** $50–100
* **Custom AI agents (multi-tool integrations):** $150–300+
* **Debugging / hourly help:** $20–25/hr

I (f21) am having the hardest time making friends. I am a very genuine person and have a great personality but I just have a lot of anxiety. For some back story my mother never really showed me girly things (doing my hair, makeup, pink sparkly things, ect.) and I never had sisters. So I never really learned what it was like to have that best friend to help in girly moments. Don’t get me wrong I have a few friends from high school that have family’s now and/or just don’t talk to me nor want to hang out. How am I supposed to make friends? I go out and do stuff but never meet friends to hang with. I am super shy and kinda awkward when meeting new people. I also don’t open up easily and I’d like to have a friend that I can talk to and go on fun shopping days or just getting some coffee & chatting. I have been used to many times by people I thought were close friends/family and I really don’t want that to happen again. Having no friends at this age kinda sucks. I just want to feel more feminine and find my bestie. Any advice on how I can make friends at this age? (Please don’t be rude I’m genuinely trying my best)

It’s never been a problem for us, but other people always have something to say. Like, some of my relatives will make negative comments about her background, and some of hers will do the same about mine. (Not everyone though, our parents are actually chill with each other.)

Then there’s social media, where it feels like a trend to hate on interracial or intercultural relationships. And it’s not just one gender, it’s both men and women hating.

Honestly, I just think it’s dumb. Like, how insecure do you have to be to try and gatekeep who people can date based on ethnicity.  Mind your own business.

And I also don’t get why some groups especially are obsessed with gatekeeping their race when literally everything in this world is built on global contributions. Your iPhone? Made from the minerals from Africa, assembled in Asia, chips from Taiwan, designed in the U.S. Your clothes? Probably made in Bangladesh, Pakistan, or India. We’re all connected whether you like it or not. The coffee you drink comes from either ethiopia, Kenya or Brazil. The immigrants in your country (regardless what nation it is) do indeed contribute to your nation through their work.

He’s starting to crawl, get teeth, get over a sickness, and we returned home from travel from a trip that had a three hour time difference. He literally will. Not. Sleep. He requires so much support from me to sleep but we’re in the middle of a heatwave and I’m just sweating all night long. He will not take a pacifier anymore and just requires my nipple at all times. He quite literally sleep crawls himself into corners. I’ve tried cosleeping but it’s too hot and the baby just sweats. My husband cannot help because if he tends to the baby, the baby loses his ever loving mind. He just wants me quite LITERALLY 24/7. Which I understand thats what I signed up for but I am really overstimulated. It’s 3am here and I set him down asleep in his crib and not a minute later hes awake. I’ve given him Tylenol, he’s been fed as he’s literally using me as a kegerator lol. He just cannot power off his body. 

I am just so exhausted bc yesterday he woke up at 2;45 am and was up for the day. I tried to do something nice for myself and drove to get a coffee and he screamed the whole time. The barista at the drive thru gave me attitude because they could hear my screaming baby in the backseat. 

I know this phase will pass, like they all do, but this one is incredibly hard for me. I’m truly at my wits end and am just watching him practice his crawling on the baby monitor as I sit in the guest room. I know it’s not his fault and he’s going through a lot but I’m just burnt out. Trying to find the strength to get me through the rest of the night where I don’t sleep I solely exist to support him. And my husband and dog sleep peacefully in the other room because no one else can solve my son’s problems. 

Also I hate heatwaves. I hate being hot. I hate sweating hahahah. I do not live somewhere with seasons and I truly regret that.

I ask him if it’s possible to customise it a certain way and he goes like “Yeah?” Like I’m an idiot for asking. His manger comes up behind him to do something with the register, and they are talking and without even LOOKING at me he blurts the number 41 in the manager’s direction. I obviously assume he is talking to her. I’m not familiar with the currency either. So I ask him “so how much would that be?” And he looks at me like I have an IQ of 60 and yells “41. FOURTY ONE”. Again no mention of currency. I usually never stand up for myself but the level of disrespect made me want to punch him. So I just calmly asked him “why are you being so rude? You know what, just cancel my order I’m good for now, thanks” and just walked away. He was wearing a mask and I could see a muscle under his eye twitch like crazy.

I was DMing for 6 players, one of them my GF. Jamil was the most popular NPC of the campaign, they often went to him for help and got to play him quite a bit, often saying jokingly that he was my character in the campaign. I added some detail to his backstory and some personality quirks, like that he loved good coffee.

To my surprise, she gifted me this Jamil themed box with threee sets of beautiful dice, one of them coffee themed, two really good artesanal cofees that she rebranded in universe, two scented candles and a porcelain cup. I was as shocked as delighted so I wanted to share it with you guys.

For the last year and a half Jamil and her character, an Elven druid named Rye, played a will they wont they slowburn romance that culminated in him confessing his feelings for her in the epilogue, so they got their happy ending :)

This campaign has been the most fulfilling role playing experience of my life and can't wait to come back to Exandria in the future to explore what the future may hold. I have some ideas already!",3,1756981573.0,CalloftheNetherdeep,0,1.0,False

It has been a tiring week (ik Wednesday pa lang lol) and I'm in the mood to socialize and get to know people. Since I do not drink alcohol and I do not go to bars/clubs, let's just say this is my way of connecting with strangers. I mean that's where we all start naman, hindi ba? 
I am very open to being friends if we get along. If we don't, please let me know because 🤷

about me:
28, 5'11"", working in IT (specializing in cybersecurity. ik how ironic lol), breadwinner, introvert, just a very simple, perfectly imperfect guy. 
I love listening to music (any that I find relatable or good sounding), I play guitar, I play computer games as well but I try to step away from the computer as much as I can (hence this post), I love traveling, NGSB, just wandering around 

about you:
really just be a good conversationalist. I like talking to people who are well-spoken and can express their feelings and thoughts (disclaimer: I myself, hindi ako ganito lol the audacity??) and also genuinely interested. mahirap i-entertain ang hindi willing at genuine makipag-usap 🤷

uhmm yeah just trying to see what's out there and what the world has for me. sana ganito ako ka-daldal nung kausap ko pa siya jk",2,1756981478.0,PhR4Friends,0,1.0,False
