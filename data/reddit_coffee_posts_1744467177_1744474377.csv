I met her at her home (outside) and drove to the nice place for a walk. So we were walking together at the beginning speaking about things and all of that, it was enjoyable and not boring conversation. And after about 15 mins I see that she’s starting to freeze but the weather was okay. I asked “is it freezing?” She said yes , I leaned her to me and we went to my car. She was holding me, than put her hand to my hand in my pocket. 
In car we started to talk about other things, just to get to know each other more. Then we looked at each other longer than usual and she leaned to me and kissed me. (Our first kiss, i wanted to do it at the end of our date lol) It was for about 15 seconds I guess. After that I was the initiator and kissed her couple of times more. I said let’s grab a coffee but she refused. 
Than i drove her to her place. I said that we can chat for a bit and I’ll go (she lives with her mom for now) she said yes let’s stay together some more.  she started to be changing in the mood. I felt that something is off. She literally was sitting with her hand clenched into a fist on the knees and process something. I said that something like “why a u sitting like that?” And she’s like “you don’t like this thing about me, u don’t like that thing and etc” and said that she thinks that it’s better for me to find another women , in my thoughts I was like “wtf?” , but I answered to her the same “and I think it’s better for you to find another man”

And she went out of the car and that’s it. 

My thoughts. 
 When we were talking about our “negatives” she said that she’s fast changing in her mood and jealous. 
All our 3 meetings I had a feeling that she wants to make me her puppet. She wants me to look at her like she’s the “queen”. But she’s failing. And I thing this attitude at the end her lost hope. 
For example when im texting her and saying hello and telling or asking smth she can reply without hello. 
When we texting she can ask a question with a “?” sign and another time without it (more times without)  
Idk but somehow I feel disdainful attitude when we chatting. 
She asks a lot of questions about my work. 
Before 3rd date she asked what we are gonna do and I said that we’ll go for a walk and grab a coffee and who who now’s how it’ll ends ( hint with flirtation). Her response was “are we already at that level?” I said “are you gonna play “levels” with me?” And she said that she can’t say anything and she’ll  be serious at the date (I understand ofc that it wasn’t serous response and it was more about “testing me”
When we were chatting about our 2nd date she asked “what we we’ll do and I replied that we’ll go for a walk and I’ll grab a thermos with a tea if we’ll get cold. (I was just messing around) but her response was really interesting - she said “I’m a a type of a girl that drinks “tea” in a car? And I was like “wtf?” But I was like “😂😂 “that’s all. 


I think when she said “you better find another woman” she wanted me to “test” and  I think she was manipulative. She wanted that I said like “i dont want to loose you, you are the one etc” but why she even said that in the first place? I would defenetly will not win the balance in relationship when I reply like that.  
I think that she don’t sure that we are on the same “level”. Coz she’s very attractive (so do I) but a definitely don’t want a woman where I’m not feeling that I’m the man.  

Can someone say what was it all about?
After one day - complete silence. 
I’ll wait max for a week - if she’s not gonna text me nothing - I’ll text  her smth like  this: “to be honest I’m not completely sure what this was all about. Be sincere with me and we’ll work it through.  

Why I’ll text her this? Maybe because it’s not a problem with “me” and she’s just insecure person (not in offended way)",1,1744474130.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1jxki97,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1jxki97/concept_for_the_next_game/,Concept for the Next Game,"There have been various issues that both I've heard many have had with New Horizons over time, as well I've also had issues. But instead of just sitting around talking about what I don't like, I thought I'd be constructive with my criticism instead.

For the main issues I have and have heard about, I'll make a short list before I start:

My issues:

\-Problems with the general vibe: I'm someone who's from the Midwest and I'm not nearly as comfortable on an island as I am in some little country town.

\-More restrictions needed: I think the cohesion of the series was lost with how open New Horizons is. There are plenty of ways to keep that free feeling without killing the more realistic things in the game.

Things I've heard:

\-Durability is terrible for the series

\-Villagers are boring

\-Loss of unpredictability

\-Villagers should be more rude

\-The player is the psudo-god of the town

\-Nothing to play or do with friends in multiplayer

  
Story Concept starts here:

The game begins in a return to form for the series, waking up on a train and running into someone else who's going to the same place you are. You do the same things here you'd normally do but this time removing the ability to pick the layout of the town. I'm not removing terraforming so this shouldn't be a long term issue. 

Upon reaching your destination, you see a town that is horribly run down. Houses with paint peeling, Roofs with missing shingles, Shuttered stores, etc. Even the train station itself is slightly ruined. Beyond that though, this town is massive. It's the biggest a town has been up until this point. Sure there's tree's that cover a third of it, and it's severely overgrown, but it's seriously impressive how large your operating area is.

Exploring around and entering what seems to be the last remaining store, you run into a very disheveled Tom Nook with his two kids. He's very surprised to meet you, informing you that, besides yourself, there are only two other people still living here. Even these three live in a nearby town instead and have to take the train each day to run the store. He mentions that he can help out if you need help getting a house there, but doesn't get another word in before the Mayor herself walks through the door.

This is Shelby, the daughter of Tortimer and current stressed out Mayor of this town. She shares Tom Nooks surprise in your arrival, and offers you a job as the towns new ""Urban Revitalization Specialist."" After discussing everything with her, Tom Nook rushes in with the news that your new house is settled and good to go. He even says that his two boys have moved in all of your luggage already. The Mayor is overjoyed and is obviously ready for you to leave, rushing you out to go see your house before you even know what's going on. 

Tom Nook walks you through town, talking up your new lodging the whole way. After walking almost completely out of town, you see it. The beautiful, little piece of heaven he'd been talking you into is little more than a shack. It looks like it's barely standing up and your halfway sure it's mostly made of sheet metal. He turns to you ""That'll be 100,000 bells.""

  
From here the main game starts proper.

  
Town Concept starts here:

The main point of this game is to slowly transform this broken town into a beautiful tourist destination. You replace housing, clear out wooded areas for new activities, and decorate to your hearts content. One big difference here though is that you aren't allowed to just place things willy nilly. Well, I mean, you could, but after a while I'm sure someone will have an issue with it. Placing things too close to shops can lead to angering their owners, potentially causing them to raise prices for you specifically. Placing things too close to town hotspots can lead to fines. And Placing things to close to Villagers can lead to them not liking you very much and potentially moving away because of it.

The area's your free to place things, and even encouraged to by the game, are the space around your house, empty areas you've cleared out and little patches of space outside of a certain radius of any in-use buildings. Though, with permission from the proper people, you are still able to build in these other areas but you'd need to build repour with them first.

A first for the series, taking some features from Happy Home Paradise, there are new unlockable areas outside of town that need to be completely remade before any of your villagers would want to use them. These areas include a broken down soccer field (an area that has a fully featured minigame to play with friends on), An old library (eventually run by Isabelle and Brewster, this is where any collected Gyroids are put, along with parody-versions of many real life books that can be bought from a new vendor. As well, the library also features a built-in coffee shop), and a completely ruined Museum (Of course, run by Blathers). 

The building's insides cannot be altered, the soccer field being an exception, but all three have a wide amount of space outside them for you to decorate to perfection. Along with that, there are also 3 unlockable fields that are nearly empty and can be built on.

  
Gameplay Concept starts here:

I'm not outright removing durability. I think it adds quite a bit to gameplay. But I'm adding a new durability bar to each tool for quality of life, increasing their base durability quite a lot, and adding in the ability for Tom Nook to fix them for a small fee. After first buying said tools from him. DIY is gone, but not completely. Most of it is completely ripped out, but with certain decorations, you can purchase their recipes from a new vendor and craft them with gathered resources in the same shop.

  
The mentioned Vendor from before, with the parody books, and the one mentioned in the previous paragraph, are one and the same. Cyrus and Reese now run a Crafts and Pawn shop that can be built with in the town. It features a small rotation of furniture and clothing that appears after appearing in either Timmy and Tommy's and the Able sisters shop at any point. This is the only way to get these things after they appear, they'll never appear in those two shops again, but they have a chance of appearing here forever.

The shop also sells the aforementioned books, as well as a large list of crafts designed by the lovely couple. I hadn't mentioned it before , every other shop from the rest of the series can be built within this much larger town. It's large enough to even allow up to 20 different villagers to also live in town.

I’ve put in some applications around town and one of the places, a coffee shop, called me back and asked me to come in for an interview. We scheduled a time and date, I went in dressed nicely, and the interview was pretty normal until the owner asked me what church I attend.

My understanding is that this kind of question during an interview is completely illegal. I replied “can I ask how this is important to the job?” and he told me that going to church shows him a candidate is well-rounded and reliable. He also said that his business represents and ties to his faith (I realized on the way out how many quotes on the wall + some of the decor was actually biblical/christian in nature, I think I was so nervous on my way in that I missed it), and that all of his employees are hard working church-goers.

I told him “I’m sorry, but my religion is private and I won’t be answering questions about it.” He said that, in that case, this wasn’t going to work out and that the interview was over. He then opened his desk drawer, slid me a pamphlet from what I’m assuming is his church, and said I’m welcome to join them for a service if I change my mind, and to have a blessed day. I took the pamphlet so that I wouldn’t seem rude, thanked him for his time, and left. Even though I’m pretty sure his line of questioning was illegal and frankly uncalled for, I take the idea of not burning professional bridges very seriously and I don’t enjoy confrontation.

1jxkg83,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1jxkg83/navitus_and_le_labo_discovery_set_reviews/,Navitus and Le Labo Discovery Set Reviews,"I (23F) have been dipping my toes into the dupe world for the past two years. After experimenting with a few discovery sets, I’ve decided to try original scents in the luxury world. I’m currently working on gourmands, something I’ve never been too interested in. These are all on card, I may update after trying them on skin.

Navitus Discovery Set (Around $65 with US shipping)

Lost in a Dream: You’ll first notice the cinnamon, I honestly get dulce de leche vibes. Very sweet. I don’t have the most sophisticated nose yet, but I’m not picking up on hardly any lactonic notes, maybe that’s simply the smoothness of the fragrance. 

I can also smell the citrus. As for the coffee, and floral scents, they are fairly lost on me. Good fragrance. Completely feminine on card.

The Embrace: Definitely a blend of citrus, woodsy, vetiver, and honey. You’ll notice the honey as soon as you spray it. I find it leaning vetiver heavy, but in a good way. Sophisticated and mature, not terribly sexy but attractive. If that’s the note I’m getting (as I don’t have much experience) I believe a trained note would get the vetiver note first.  As for the other notes, I can’t really identify them.

For my taste, I don’t particularly enjoy this one. It leans fairly feminine but more unisex than LIAD. 

Venom of Love: Almost an exact match to TF’s Lost Cherry, of which I was not a huge fan. I’ve been wanting to find a purely juicy cherry scent, this isn’t that. Absolutely wonderful if you like Lost Cherry, which I found feminine.

Baklava Royale: Very Sweet, similarly to LIAD. I can identify the listed notes - honey, orange blossom, bergamot, vanilla, tonka, maybe amberwood. The almond and pistachio are lost on me. Similar to VOF if it didn’t have the cherry note. 

Miel Extase: Fresh, slightly fruity, sweet, maybe a little bit boozy. I’d say the sexiest one of the lot. Definitely getting the tonka, vanilla, toffee, rum notes after dry down. More unisex than the previous ones, but leans feminine. This kit is really for the girlies, but there is one cologne coming up…

Vivamor: Very close to Layton by PDM, which is funny because the fragrance profile isn’t very similar. If you really concentrate, you may get the pineapple. I can smell the patchouli, leather, peppercorn, and lemon. Other notes are, you guessed it, not noticeable for me. Very masculine, as it’s almost a match for Layton. 

Ambrosia Imperiale: On first impression, tutti frutti, fruity pebble like. Sweet. It’s a no from me dawg. Definitely getting the banana note, but slightly artificial banana. I can notice the cinnamon, vanilla and whipped cream notes. This is a very fun, youthful, and lively fragrance. Very feminine. 

Melon Kiss: Slightly more sophisticated than Ambrosia Imperiale, but still fun and playful. Definitely a melon and coconut mixture. I can pick up on the honey vanilla combo. The bergamot is the first thing most will probably notice, it’s punchy similarly to how Vivamore and Layton are. Very feminine 

Chocolate Queen: I immediately notice a fruity/citrusy note which is nowhere in the fragrance profile, maybe it’s the bitter almond, or the dark chocolate. Not too sweet. This one will be interesting on the skin I think. Feminine but may wear to be a bit masculine. 

Amour feminine: Most floral out of the bunch. Fruity and floral. Sweet. I smell the red fruits, pomegranate and maybe some citrusy/tropical notes from the pineapple. I think the white chocolate, vanilla, and honeysuckle add most of the sweetness. Very feminine. 

I will try to wear all of these and see how they perform, however some may wind up being scrubbers. On card, I may not be as into gourmands as I hoped I would be, but I’m not giving up yet. I can certainly appreciate all of these scents and their profiles.

 If you’re a fan of sweet gourmands, you NEED to try this discovery set. This kit was worth every penny due to the range of fragrances and accuracy to their listed fragrance profile. This set would be a wonderful gift to the women or gourmand lovers in your life. 

Le Labo Discovery Set (Around $40 US Shipping)

Spoiler - I wasn’t fond of many of these

Santal 33: I do enjoy this one. It’s nice. HOWEVER I did get a JHAG Discovery set and Sunny Side Up takes the cake. It’s smoother and perhaps creamier. The performance may not match up, as I haven’t worn either on the skin yet, but on card and other reviews I’ve read, this is accurate. S33 has some punchiness and pepperiness to it, far too much for me. We all know how unique and interesting Le Labo scent profiles are, which makes it uniquely enjoyable on it’s own. I do know it’s a very common fragrance and overused where some of you live. Not in my area, I’d never smelled it before. Oil Perfumery has an exact 10/10 spot on dupe. I love a good sandalwood and this is that. Leans masculine. 

Another 13: A tiny touch of sweetness and florals makes this one far more feminine than S33, yet still unisex. I notice the sandalwood, ylang ylang, bergamot, and rosewater.   

The Matcha 26: To me it is essentially S33 without any of the pepper. I prefer it over S33. I’d argue that this is perfectly unisex.

The Noir 29: I’d say the listed scent profile is completely accurate. The bay leaf, bergamot, cedar, vetiver, musk and hay. I don’t notice much tobacco. Masculine of course. 

Rose 31: I’m not sure I’ll ever find a rose I enjoy but this is a classic rose scent with the Le Labo base. Fresh after dry down, not as heavy. Nuclear on initial spray, and I’m glad I sprayed it on the card outside.

This discovery set gave me a wonderful intro of Le Labo fragrances, they all have a similar hay like smoothness, fresh, musky, bergamot base.  

I think this set would be a great and unique intro to cologne for any man, and you’d have a little rose decant to give to a woman, unless you yourself enjoy it of course. Also would be a perfect gift for holidays or anniversaries. 

JHAG review may be coming up soon… Miami Shake was a nuclear scrubber that I could not go nose blind to.

We both are same age 17. Let's name them ""Triangle"". I recently changed school's and I met Triangle there. At first they seemed like a nice person and I thought maybe changing shool won't be as bad. But recently Triangle started acting wiered. At first we got along great but just two months in Triangle started having feelings for me. So Triangle wrote me a love letter and that's the point where everything started going downhill. At first I didn't even understand it was a confession. I only did when Triangle started acting shy and all and at first I didn't know how I felt so I took few days to think about it. I already was overwhelmed with two other classmates crushing on me and that stressed me out. And I realised I don't like Triangle like that. That day was an evening we hanged out at my apparent and I said I'm sorry and Triangle esxused themselves to the bathroom and once they got back started acting wierd. Lost in thought, silent, not responding to me. Started asking questions about exsistance and purpose of life. Then Triangle acted impulsively so I stopped them from harm. I thought to myself I can't leave Triangle to go home alone. So I leaded Triangle home and they attempted 3 sewerslides. I was calm all the way to Triangles home then I called they're close friend in the middle of the night to help me calm down after that event. Few weeks pass by and I ask Triangle why do that to me I was angry I was going to call the cops but I didn't Triangle is lucky to not go to the hospital. I basically saved they're life and all they said is that it wasn't because I rejected them. Triangle said it's the stress from moving from hometown away from parents and new shool new living space and everything new and unknown I personally believe that so I forgave Triangle, but his friend that I called that day let's call them ""Circle"" dosent believe Triangle because it wasn't first time Triangle threatened to beybey themselves with theyre crush. The problem is I don't feel like I'd want to be friends with Triangle not fully because of beybey themselves but also because Triangle acts strange towards my friend I intoduced Triangle to. Triangle AGAIN started having feeling but got rejected but since last two tome beybey method didn't work Triangle started getting my friend expensive gifts (as a teenager 30 dollars is pretty big money). Triangle never did that to me or they're best friend only to the friend that started to have feelings for. We also have a group chat and I asked Triangle to not befriend my other friend because I wanted to have friends not associated to Triangle. Bo was greedy and still did make friendship and I am jealous but also hurt because I haven't been talking to that friend but the friend is dear to my heart (platonicly) and Triangle is basically stealing my friend because since I'm currently not talking to my friend might as well keep them busy as if Triangle was me. I also noticed that I get tired from Triangle so I did tell Triangle that they're energy can be draining and I get socials tired from them and Triangle was understanding and respectful. I always try to be nice and kind so I don't think Triangle feels that we have tention but I don't have many good memories with Triangle these past 6 months even though I tried to push the bad vibe away and try hanging out walking around town or going for coffee to try fix my opinion of Triangle. But I see some flaws and Circle told me that Triangle changed because Circle knew Triangle for 2 years and recently Triangle started acting off and Circle started talking to Triangle less I wish I could do that but me and Triangle are classmates we sit together do everything together and I dont have many friends besides Triangle in school wich I'd like to have but I also don't want to have awkward sorry we can't be friends situation.... MY QUESTION IS should I be friends? Try to fix my opinion? Or say thank you for being my friend? And how to make it less painfull?",0,1744473314.0,AITAH,0,0.25,False
1jxkfw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/FemFragLab/comments/1jxkfw8/navitus_and_le_labo_discovery_set_reviews/,Navitus and Le Labo Discovery Set Reviews,"I (23F) have been dipping my toes into the dupe world for the past two years. After experimenting with a few discovery sets, I’ve decided to try original scents in the luxury world. I’m currently working on gourmands, something I’ve never been too interested in. These are all on card, I may update after trying them on skin.

Navitus Discovery Set (Around $65 with US shipping)

Lost in a Dream: You’ll first notice the cinnamon, I honestly get dulce de leche vibes. Very sweet. I don’t have the most sophisticated nose yet, but I’m not picking up on hardly any lactonic notes, maybe that’s simply the smoothness of the fragrance. 

I can also smell the citrus. As for the coffee, and floral scents, they are fairly lost on me. Good fragrance. Completely feminine on card.

The Embrace: Definitely a blend of citrus, woodsy, vetiver, and honey. You’ll notice the honey as soon as you spray it. I find it leaning vetiver heavy, but in a good way. Sophisticated and mature, not terribly sexy but attractive. If that’s the note I’m getting (as I don’t have much experience) I believe a trained note would get the vetiver note first.  As for the other notes, I can’t really identify them.

For my taste, I don’t particularly enjoy this one. It leans fairly feminine but more unisex than LIAD. 

Venom of Love: Almost an exact match to TF’s Lost Cherry, of which I was not a huge fan. I’ve been wanting to find a purely juicy cherry scent, this isn’t that. Absolutely wonderful if you like Lost Cherry, which I found feminine.

Baklava Royale: Very Sweet, similarly to LIAD. I can identify the listed notes - honey, orange blossom, bergamot, vanilla, tonka, maybe amberwood. The almond and pistachio are lost on me. Similar to VOF if it didn’t have the cherry note. 

Miel Extase: Fresh, slightly fruity, sweet, maybe a little bit boozy. I’d say the sexiest one of the lot. Definitely getting the tonka, vanilla, toffee, rum notes after dry down. More unisex than the previous ones, but leans feminine. This kit is really for the girlies, but there is one cologne coming up…

Vivamor: Very close to Layton by PDM, which is funny because the fragrance profile isn’t very similar. If you really concentrate, you may get the pineapple. I can smell the patchouli, leather, peppercorn, and lemon. Other notes are, you guessed it, not noticeable for me. Very masculine, as it’s almost a match for Layton. 

Ambrosia Imperiale: On first impression, tutti frutti, fruity pebble like. Sweet. It’s a no from me dawg. Definitely getting the banana note, but slightly artificial banana. I can notice the cinnamon, vanilla and whipped cream notes. This is a very fun, youthful, and lively fragrance. Very feminine. 

Melon Kiss: Slightly more sophisticated than Ambrosia Imperiale, but still fun and playful. Definitely a melon and coconut mixture. I can pick up on the honey vanilla combo. The bergamot is the first thing most will probably notice, it’s punchy similarly to how Vivamore and Layton are. Very feminine 

Chocolate Queen: I immediately notice a fruity/citrusy note which is nowhere in the fragrance profile, maybe it’s the bitter almond, or the dark chocolate. Not too sweet. This one will be interesting on the skin I think. Feminine but may wear to be a bit masculine. 

Amour feminine: Most floral out of the bunch. Fruity and floral. Sweet. I smell the red fruits, pomegranate and maybe some citrusy/tropical notes from the pineapple. I think the white chocolate, vanilla, and honeysuckle add most of the sweetness. Very feminine. 

I will try to wear all of these and see how they perform, however some may wind up being scrubbers. On card, I may not be as into gourmands as I hoped I would be, but I’m not giving up yet. I can certainly appreciate all of these scents and their profiles.

Second week. Way more clarity in my mind. No longer feeling tired waking up. More energy. No brain fog or feeling jittery. Wow it was Great.

Finally cracked about 4 weeks in and fancied a morning coffee. Honestly I felt terrible. Irritable. Everything was getting on my nerves. Wanted to leave the misses. Was this really coffee?? Help me understand.",1,1744473277.0,CaffeineFreeLife,0,1.0,False

We definitely want the washer and dryer in the mud room and we need open floor space for dog stuff, which currently takes up about 2’x5’ of space on our mud room floor. I’m open to moving the door, just haven’t found a better placement myself. Got ideas?

Also, please don’t reply just to be rude. I tried posting for feedback before and deleted after I got a totally unhinged response about sinks in islands being gross because of potato peels being everywhere (?!) and the linen closet being too small to fit anything other than a shampoo bottle (it’s 2’x2’; you can fit a ton of stuff).

1jxkd2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernWarzone/comments/1jxkd2a/a_warzone_story/,A Warzone Story,"

It’s been three days since I woke up in the no man’s land. The only thing i knew, i was ordering the store inventory, since my boss wanted to finish as early as possible. Next thing I felt a hard cold steel - like substance entering from my neck. Then I woke up inside a metallic container, cold as hell. with some sort of metallic box in front of me. a 32 inch screen above it. Screen was displaying some information. 



	Map: Verdanks, Kastovia

	Alive: 150 

	Status: No Gas incoming.



I opened the box, it contained some kind of helmet, an assault rifle with instructions on how to use and store and a handgun. At the very end of it there was a note with handwriting: “Kill and survive soldier, see you at the end”.

I looked back at the screen where some big map was also displayed. It showed what it seems some city, then i gazed at the YOU ARE HERE 	signal. Apparently I woke up at some football stadium west of the map. The room around me has a mixture of moist and old smell, as if maintenance haven't done their job for some months or weeks. The paper on the walls is also hanging. I want to get up but I'm still dizzy. I was just finishing the inventories my boss ordered me to do in the backroom of the pharmacy. “get well soon” a little shit pharmacy in a god forsaken corner in a god forsaken neighborhood. The last thing I remember is feeling a little but sharp pain in the back of my neck as a syringe, then I fell asleep. and woke up here. My wife was supposed to give me a ride home and go on vacation after that night. Jesus, how many times have I been asleep? I managed to get up, the room was about 4 x 4 meters with the box, guns and lots of maintenance tools scattered around. managed to find some protein bars inside the box and ventured outside the room. a very bright light hit my face as i opened the door as some big ass windows were in front of me with a very hard sun. I was standing on what seemed to be some 4th floor above the ground. windows covered from the floor all the way to the ceiling and beyond, rest of the map. I could see structures, buildings, stores, pharmacies as any local town or small city would. i decided to take a walk around.everything is in a state of decay, corrosion is all over the metallic benches and even some windows are broken. plafond ceilings are damaged by rainwater. It took me some half an hour to make a complete turn around the stadium just to be back where I started. I was getting a little nervous as I saw no way down, anyway there is no incentive to move from here until I know what the hell is going on or where I am.I took a protein bar. Read the label 800KCal and more than 100g of protein, tasted all artificial but i would say is enough for the day. The sun is falling down on the horizon, no news of anyone explaining to me what is going on or where I am. found another similar box as the one in my room anyway, containing only bullets and even a blanket for the cold of the night. I need to get ready to sleep. As I was getting ready to sleep, the helmet I found in the box beeped. beeping did not stop so i put it on and on the screen i could see updated info the day.



Map: Verdanks, Kastovia

	Alive: 146 

	Status: No Gas incoming.



Does that mean there are other people like me scattered across the map killing each other? ¿as a killing spree? What happens at the end? Will I get to see my wife again? The next few days passed by. I think I'm getting crazy. The number dropped from 146 all the way to 86. I need to do something. I heard some gunshots getting close and I even overheard some footsteps down below. Someone is with me inside this stadium. helmet beeped urgently, put it on again and through the coms i could hear: “There is gas incoming, safe zones updated” in the screen i could see a simulation for the next 10 hours on then, some poisonous gas would devour a big chunk of the map including the stadium i was right now. I need to move, not urgently, but smartly, but get out of here if I want to keep myself alive. need to find a way down of this stadium, all doors were closed, finally i used a rope to slide myself down, the only problem is i was outside on the open and smart ass of myself forgot to bring the guns with me, only the protein bars and the blanket i found. It was night time and I headed east. I plan on getting inside one of the apartment buildings I can see in the distance. It is freaking cold, I do not know where I am but it has some desert live weather, hot in the day and cold in the nights. managed to move slowly. As I walked I stepped on something sticky to find out it was blood. someone bled here no more than an hour ago. But as I raised my view I could see him. There was some guy on the floor staring at me holding his stomach with his right hand and pointing a gun at me with the other. I stared completely still.

“Do you have any food?” he asked

“Have some bars,” I answered.

“drop one next to me and sit down over there” he said, meaning a bench no more than 5 meters away from me. 

Full moon was in the sky, a cold night and moonlight could hit the big stadium behind us and all of the city I managed to see.

I sat down as he instructed.

“What is your name?” he asked me while he opening the protein bar with one hand while keeping his gun at my head.

“I do not remember” i said

“Me neither,” he said. “i do not know what kind of technology they use on us but only primary instincts prevail”

“i remember i used to work at a pharmacy” i said

“well no more, what is your plan? Have you killed anyone?” he asked

“I have been for what I guess is 4 days in some little closed room up there,” I said pointing at the top floor of the stadium.

“So you haven't used any guns yet?” he asked

Silence involved the scene around us.

“Listen my friend,” he said, “I am going to die. The guy that shot me is dead behind you but before I shot him dead in the head, he managed to hurt me.”

I took a look back and the body was lying there.

“You are going to be eaten alive my friend, take his gun and his body armor, he also has some tactical grenades on him, I'm still a little deaf from his stupid flashbang.”

I managed to get the gear he said.

“apparently the majority of us are ex military except for some of you who clearly never have used a gun before or have never needed to survive otherwise you would not be walking around as if this is a fun park walk”

I took a little handgun, a big rifle, two grenades, one of those flashbangs my new protector said and put on his body armor.

“There is a hospital a mile away from here, we are going there for a few reasons. First of all, let’s see if there is something to save my life, second, a hospital has many rooms to be safe for some days until the safe zones update and third, in a few hours this place is going to be filled with hazardous gas. forget about not being able to breathe, it burns your skin.”

“how do you know?” i asked “the gas have not even got so close it is still outside the map”

“I won the last game,” he said. “Now help me get up.”

I helped my new friend get up but it was hard to carry him along with all the gear. We left his guns behind, in the way he gave me a very detailed but simple explanation on how to use the rifles and guns and grenades. 

“even a little kid could use them, do you understand?” he asked

I did understand him, using a gun seemed simple enough but I know I need to practice my aim in order to use it correctly.

more headshots were heard in the distance and i could swear even a motor truck was running some miles away. We stopped for some hours in the apartment buildings before getting into said hospital for him to rest. 

I managed to find some wood outside and get some gasoline from an old truck, bring them inside and put them next to the window but I needed some fire for it as the cold was getting strong as midnight passed. I could indeed see the gas devouring the stadium I was before.

“What the fuck are you doing?” my new friend asked.

“It is getting cold, we need to make some fire or else…”

“Are you insane?” he asked angrily “you want us to get killed? if i were some guy trying to survive i would be looking to eliminate all the other possible player as fast i can that is how i won the last game and a fucking fire is more than an invitation for those kind of experimented people to come here, study the are for some minutes before deciding a killing approach, so drop that idea and use your stupid blanket”

Some metallic sound could be heard in the next room as if someone was hearing us talk and dropped something by mistake.

My new friend whispered me urgently waving his hands: “LOAD YOUR FUCKING HANDGUN!!” I managed to load it following what he teached me hours earlier.

“ALRIGHT, WE KNOW YOU ARE THERE, SO JUST SHOW UP THROUGH THE DOOR” he said commanding the stranger to show himself.

Silence.

Bullets started flying from the wall penetrating and going through. I only dropped onto the floor covering my face. When it stopped, smoke covered all of the room. The wall had a thousand bullet holes from where I could see our attacker. I took a shot through the wall as he peeked inside. Took the shot and killed him. 

Attacker and my new protector were killed in the act. I stayed in my position for about an hour making sure there was no one else nearby.  Paying attention to everything but i got up, closed my friend’s eyes.

I looted my attacker, he had a similar gun as mine but with some kick ass holographic sight so I exchanged weapons, took his bullets but he had something else on him. a little tablet device around 15 x 15 cm that said “Reckon UAV”.

“What the hell is this?” i pressed the activate button and suddenly  the map where we were showed up following some expanding circle from my position as some green dots were revealed in the area. i had to get the fuck away from here is i deducted two things from this: one, this is obviously some kind of personal radar that would last only 5 minutes as the screen countdown could only mean that and two, as dots where revealed kilometers int he distance that meant no harm, 7 dots where revealed close to me and closing in and two of them even less than 30 meters away from me. I do not know if those guys are camping or if they are on the move and I do not want to find out. Next expanding circle revealed one of those dots was moving close to me. i needed to think fast, three dots were revealed in the hospital but right now seemed as the best option as the gas was getting close. So let's get out of here. As I headed to the hospital I left behind the apartments to find a big water canal with no water whatsoever and some 10 dead bodies scattered around. I took a look at the radar. two minutes left and two of the circles were closing in, one of them so close … 

The attacker showed from behind with a knife which I managed to evade as I started running into the canal. I could hear his footsteps behind me. He knocked me down, punched me several times in the face. This guy was a psycho.

 he could have easily killed me but he chose to hurt and punch me instead, enjoying my suffering. but in the distance i could hear some kind of faded shooting as his face blew up in pieces and i was covered in blood. someone had killed him. I looked around looking for a second attacker and from one of the buildings in the east, there was something reflecting the moonlight. I stared at it. Then a second flash happened from the reflection. I heard the same distant bang sound and I could hear a bullet grazing the floor a few cm away from me. Time to run again. The problem was, I had not even crossed the canal yet and it was a very open space. I had to completely trust God on this one. as i ran more bullets hit the floor next to me. I remembered my wife, her warmth and voice. That kept me going on. I ran and ran until I reached the very same building where my attacker was. I entered the building hitting the door hard and loading the rifle pointing at the stairs as that was the only way he could come for me. I could hear busy footsteps on the top floors. I climbed the stairs very slowly with my eye on the holosight of my rifle. I was very careful as soon as I spotted him I would pull the trigger. The stairs were snakes stories which made 180 degree turns so every corner was a new challenge. On the second floor I hesitated, I deviated and opened an unlocked door of one of the apartments and locked the door from the inside. I was tired of this game and I needed time to process everything that happened. My brief friend, dead. I killed a soldier defending myself. A sniper guy, who is some floors above me, is still hunting me and killed my attacker. The gas has for sure now settled and I needed some rest. I ate another protein bar, opened another box to find water, medicine and some kind of syringe with the label “STIM” on it. I have no idea what it is so I put it in my backpack. Gunshots can be heard outside, before taking off my helmet I read the new info.

Whatever this is, right now I do not care. I unfolded the bed and slept on it like a baby. I must have been asleep for around 12 hours. footsteps rushing outside the door, in the stairs, woke me up. must have been two people. One coming after the other. 

“NO, WAIT!” I heard a gunshot. Sound was more complex and loud, yet simple, must’ve been a shotgun. Happened just outside my door. I readied my handgun in case the killer came in. but another shot was heard outside in no time, and, what i supposed was the killer, was dead. I could hear his body being dragged upstairs for what must be the sniper guy that was after me. Maybe he forgot about me or doesn’t care. Maybe he wins. Next morning I opened the hot tub and water came in. I filled the tub very carefully so as to not make any sound for my friend upstairs and I took a shower for the first time since I woke up in this god forsaken place. lighted up a cigarette i found in the latest box i opened and had a well deserved free time. I must have fallen asleep or daydreamed with my wife back home. her hair over me, calling my name. going on vacation. but water woke me up. my head was completely submerged in the water. funny. fell asleep and almost drowned. alright. I spent nearly 5 hours in the tub, got out and prepared coffee from the kitchen. The next few days were very slow. occasionally i could hear small footsteps upstairs but he is also very careful. but suddenly some engine caught my attention. I had spent lots of hours next to the window admiring the stadium and all the surroundings and even spotted one or another survivor running there and there but this was different. a big airplane in the sky dropped a large box and parachuted right across the street. my helmet beeped loudly “SUPPLY AIRDROP INCOMING!” 

Fuck, it was too loud, not loud enough to be heard upstairs where our friend is but loud enough to be heard in the stairway outside. doesn’t matter. hours passed and by night, I was smoking a cigarette in the window and spotted some guy in a white shirt coming close to the supply box. behind him, another guy. They teamed up. they opened the box and started taking out all sorts of new guns, and gadgets which i have no idea what the fuck they where. but a sudden loud shot was heard. coming from upstairs which completely smoked one of the guys. headless, fell to the floor. The other guy ran for his life and entered the apartment complex in front of us by breaking a window. Two more sniper rifle detonations were heard upstairs but no success from [them.it](http://them.it) was time to do something about this psycho guy above me. I grabbed only my hand gun, it's gonna be enough. came outside into the stairway and very carefully i started climbing. It was very hard to keep the noise down, wooden stairs make everything very loud, even the smallest crack would be heard upstairs, since the night was very calm. As I reached the top floor, I saw what was unmistakable where our friend was hiding. Two bodies were in the door and a warning sign that read “I AM AN EXPERT ARM SHOOTER, GO AWAY!” 

I approached silently, tossed the bodies apart and peeked through the door. There was our guy watching through the window with some binoculars, sniper rifle in the side. and in the rest of the room, all sorts of explosives.

“If you come anything closer we both are gonna die” He said, to which i freaked out.

“how do you know i am behind you?” i asked

“do not be silly and go away, i let you live or otherwise i would have come for you in the floors below”

i kept coming in closer without stopping pointing my gun at him

“Why should I listen to you? How do I know you won’t come after me?” i asked

“First of all , I placed a field mine less than a meter away from your feet. Next, you are so easy, somebody's gonna put you down. I take no pride in hunting inexperienced players,” he said.

I looked down and I could barely see a round shaped metallic mine on the floor.

“That shit goes off, my flat jacket would save me, but you, not so much, those two guys looking through the airdrop were experienced killers which i saw days ago killing cold heartedly other players, they deserve it, and even more, they do not deserve to win and go back into the world.”

“You mean if we win we go back home?” i asked.

“That's what I wish to think,” he said, turning his face towards me. He had white beard and a patch in his right eye.

But at that moment I could see a green laser hitting our way from the apartment the other guy managed to escape into.

“What does that laser mean?” i asked

Sniper guy turned around and in no time he screamed.

“WE NEED TO GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE!”

rapidly in my helmet comms the alarm raised:

“AIRSTRIKE INCOMING IN YOUR POSITION!”

“Airstrike?” I asked “What the fuck does that mean?”

Sniper guy deactivated his field mine. 

“We have around one minute to get out of here or we are dead!”

We were outside the building in less than a minute and kept running in the opposite direction when some fighter jets approached fast. They passed three times and smoked the place we were with their mini guns. The roof was down, the walls shattered. we would have been dead for sure.

I could see our attacker going inside the building looking for our dead bodies. I turned around looking for the sniper guy but he was gone. nowhere to be found. He let me live, I could never forget that.



In the shadows, under the moonlight, hiding from spot to spot. My trip to the hospital lasted around an hour. not so far away. 50 survivors said the info screen with the new gas update. The next circle to be completed by tomorrow at noon, would leave the hospital as a safe zone. but as i arrived, everyone had the same idea it seemed as if it was a bloodbath, lots of players were fighting for a safe place before the gas came in. I managed to sneak quietly but quick luminous flashes from the gunshots could be seen from the outside from all corners. I climbed through a window into a quiet and closed room. After an hour everything was quiet. I found a box which contained more bullets, which I discarded, but didn't fire anything. Another radar UAV, protein bars, water, soap, a teddy bunny, god knows why and more blankets for the cold.

I activated the 5 minute UAV and as i suspected, 8 more players were inside the hospital with me. all of us scattered in different rooms across the three story complex. Next morning the gas was no more than 500 meters away from the window. But as soon as I was getting ready for another three or four days waiting, lots of engines could be heard outside the hospital and as I looked through the window I managed to see no less than 5 trucks with people inside surrounding the hospital. one of the leaders ordered to open fire on all of us hiding inside. bullets hit all the facade but naturally, nothing happened as the walls are thick enough to make a nice cover. The leader which had a skeleton mask, grabbed a megaphone and talked to us.

“Alright  people we are the Verdanks Coalition, my radar says there are eight of you hiding inside the hospital, three in the right wind, three in the center and two in the left wing, i know all of you can hear me right now” He said

“We have in our power 6 Airstrike which we can use to bring down the building or we can do this the easy way and you all come out with your hands up, you have 5 minutes or we are calling all of the airstrikes on you”

As they spoke I spotted my sniper friend position himself on the roof behind all of them. needed to get out. As I opened the door I was suddenly in front of another guy who was just passing by, he stood still staring at me, sniper rifle in his hand. 

“Give me your rifle,” I asked. I had a better idea.

He handed it over, went back inside again. gonna take as many as i can before they call in the attack.

As a perfect synchronicity, just as I aimed at one of the soldiers, my sniper friend blew no less than two heads of the coalition group and I managed to at least scare them away with my unperfect shooting. I think I blew a tire. the massacre began as the fire upon my sniper friend's direction. The shooting was so useless as no more of their group was killed nor me and I bet neither my sniper friend. but as expected my helmet warned about three airstrikes incoming. Last night’s attack was about a minute before jets arrived, this did not give me enough time to run into the hospital which i do not know inside and maybe i do not find a way out and the mini guns for sure would bring the roof down. The other guy ran inside but I jumped out the window from where I came in.

All exposed, of course incoming fire rained under me. I ran and ran to take shelter into some forgotten train station less than a mile away before the jets arrived and smoked the hospital completely, even killing the coalition soldiers who were too close to their own attack.

The train station was completely closed and based on my experience the next circle was going to protect something very important  as the game forces the players to visit big and important places as the new safe zones. First the stadium, next and still, the hospital. I have no experience in surviving or fighting, so if i want to live i need to take shelter as long as possible, so my best bet is travel to the airport, where the final showdown would take place.

According to the map I had to cross a place called a superstore and some storage deposit to make it into the airport and according to previous days, I had around three days to make it before the  gas circle settles in. I would rest in the days and move through the nights as a shadow.

I took another protein bar and settled inside a security cabin where maybe months or years ago a security guard happily worked watching people going in and out of the trains. I took a closer look at the teddy bunny I managed to get from one of the boxes. It was blue, and had an X instead of the left eye. not intended for kids i supposed. Night fell under me and the stars were visible, no moonlight this time, so it is going to be harder to travel but I have no choice.

As I walked carefully in the night, in the distance several fires could be seen miles away and even light coming from a few windows in distant buildings. I needed to be careful, just before leaving the stadium while checking one of the boxes, I found some big rifle with a thermal night vision to see in the night, so it is dark but still not safe. 

Some hours later I reached the superstore. but i did not know if I should continue my way or rest inside, as it looks safe and quiet but i bet my ass there is someone or someones hiding inside having a little cold war as me and my sniper friend had for a brief day, where both players know they are near each other but not exactly where. I approached the main door and took a peek inside, everything was as the rest of this fucking map, as if it has seen better days and to my surprise there is a guy who made a fucking fire inside and seating down next to it. Idiot. I took my rifle, not the sniper one, but the automatic that my first friend gave me from his kill, and aimed. I am not a cold killer but I will do this guy a favor so I took a big breath and fired all the magazine in bursts of three or four bullets into the fire and next to it, being careful not to hit the idiot. I finished my mag and the guy ran away. better me than a psycho guy who can kill this innocent soul. As I reloaded and placed the rifle back into my shoulder someone approached from behind and pointed a gun at me. I turned around. there was a black guy so skinny as he had not eaten in days.

“I am sorry he said” sweating “i need to win this, there is my wife waiting for me after this”

i thought that was it but a sudden blast could be heard inside the store. I realized my mistake trying to save this guy. He ran in the dark and probably stepped into a field mine left by someone else. But it was enough as my attacker took his look away from me so in the fastest move I could make I took my handgun and shot him in the forehead. Dropped dead instantly. Don’t feel bad, survival of the fittest. But all the loudness could be heard miles away so I moved fast into the storage town. Just in time as the sun was barely visible and not yet had risen, I arrived. Storage town was a waste, all of the container buildings were closed with some doors opened into offices. I must go inside and take shelter in one of them. I peeked into Many of them, I did not like any of them since the windows were too big and I could not sleep comfortably and needed one. Until I reached an office, which would be the main office manager of the second floor storage, I climbed some stairs fast as sunlight was already hitting big. Office was 5 x 5 meters tops, closed the windows and locked the door, ready to sleep and shelter as long as it takes before the airport.

Took a look at my helmet screen:

There was a cold murder no more than 50 meters away, the guy pledged for his life but a gunshot silenced him. Guess we are 31 now. 

Checked my gear: Sniper rifle, 32 bullets; Assault rifle 139 bullets; handgun, 45 bullets. That is firepower, now the rest: 5 protein bars, enough for until the game ends; 1 adrenaline stimulant, two blankets and a teddy bunny.

There was another box inside with me which contained another UAV Radar, and finally an airstrike for me, which seems very cruel for me to use. Also a new flat jacket for stopping bullets and explosives, and a smoke grenade. Aside, I still have a flashbang and two fragmentation grenades. Alright, let’s sleep.

Next morning came with an important update: the final circle will consume everything except the airport, as I predicted and half of some dam to the north which I have no intention of visiting. What happens after the final circle? Is everything covered in poisonous gas? We had 24 hours until the circle was complete. so tonight i need to move again as for right now, i rest. This day was especially hot, the roof above me does not have enough heat protection. Need to change places or I will suffocate. Readied everything in my backpack and took only the assault rifle in my hands. I was tainted by using the radar but I have the feeling I would need it at the airport. Now, as I walked looking for a fresher shelter, there was nothing , only the other rooms I saw the day before. As I kept looking, someone missed a shot that landed close to my feet. Someone attacked me by surprise and I need to take shelter fast because I do not know where this guy is. I ran as fast as I could and took a turn left into a tiny open space that led into the open storage area. There was no cover there; it was only a square with one side open but I took my rifle and was ready to face him. Behind me was one of the boxes, opened it hoping for something useful and found three metallic plates made out of kevlar that, according to their label, help to preserve life from bullet attacks. I placed them inside my shirt, grabbed my smoke grenade and threw it in the open field. I was ready. Smoke immediately covered all the area, I ran towards it ready to die if necessary. Crazy guy fired lots of bullets hoping one of them would hit me and thank god, one of them hit the kevlar protection, it saved me but it hurts a lot. I ran in the opposite direction and once I was out of the smoke I looked back fast and mangade to see my attacker which was on the roof of the very place I was sleeping the night before. Was he there all the time? A gun fight started in which he shot. I took cover, I shot back and missed and so on. Until he stopped reloading, he did not even manage to take cover anymore, reloading his gun up there in the roof as an easy target, so I took my chance and shot him dead. I managed all my way into his body. Nothing special on him, only bullets and protein bars, and another teddy bunny and a smoke grenade to replace the one i used. I managed to wait until the night in the storage town under different shadows, day sleeping at any chance not caring if i get killed, i am tired.

When the night came in I continued my way into the airport already visible by some [lights.as](http://lights.as) i approached I could see a distant truck driving over there. Of course some of us will have a fight there.

i got there in less than an hour, some bodies could be found at the entrance.

I could see the gas approaching from where I had been before. I cannot believe I managed to stay alive until right now. Where is my sniper friend? Is he alive? I needed to find shelter again. I activated the UAV Radar to find out 8 of the 12 players were indeed with me in the airport. All of them weren’t moving, the other four were in the dam and only one of them was in motion. all of us, rest.

I saw another guy taking shelter in one of the rooms. I could easily throw a grenade from his window and take him out but I decided to rest. Bet other players did the same.

I placed myself inside another maintenance room just as the one I woke up some days ago. There was an orange box there, different from the other ones. I opened it, bullets, protein bars, water and something called cluster strike, bet it is something similar to the airstrikes. That night i could not sleep, tomorrow i might be dead, what are the chances of me winning? I did not know how to use a gun properly nor did I have any military training like most guys here. Where is my sniper friend? maybe he got killed, maybe he is still out there. He is smart and knows how to survive, that’s for sure. All of that night I thought about my wife. Where is she? What has her name? Does she misses me?

As soon as the sun made its first appearance, helmet beeps with new warning

10 minutes? The map was updated. Those guys in the dam are fried for good. They need literally to sprint all the way down here or they will be killed, and all of us inside the airport need to get out on the open runway to fight. Cruel decisions whoever decides where the gas is going. I need to move. As I opened the maintenance door, gunshots and fighting had already started. No one wants to be the one who goes into the open runway. As I saw the airport by day I could see more details. The airport is also in a ruinous state. Roof is brought down, decay in the walls and floors. metallic benches starting to show corrosion, etc.

There is one armored car on the runway already which has a mounted machine gun in the top. The guy driving it started shooting like crazy in our direction, getting some of the guys trying to escape the gas. Gas was already inside the building, some meters behind me. Armored car would never let me advance. I took out the laser attacks, and called in an airstrike and a cluster strike on it. The car was useless after that. silence. gas moves slowly and as it advances forces all of us to show ourselves into the open, we shoot, we take cover behind cars and concrete divisions. some fall, some endure. At the end I made a final run into the armored car I previously destroyed. As I approached, the guy inside, still alive, shot me in my stomach. It hurts. He was about to kill me. I was on the floor ready to die. but my sniper friend showed up from behind, killing him in the act by a shot in the back of the head. The poor guy didn’t know what hit him. Sniper friend fell to the floor and revealed a deep wound in the chest and before taking its last breath he took off a gas mask he was wearing and handed it to me. I read the label on it: “5 minute breathable mask” I put it on. Now gas has completely consumed the area.

The gas was indeed hazardous, started burning my skin so I needed to find the other player fast and eliminate them.

I finally saw them, one of them was on the floor ready to die as the other one, standing in front of him, shot him dead in the head in a merciless act. He stared at me then, turned around to shoot me. As fast as I could I used the smoke grenade to divert his attention, I used the adrenaline stimulant in my arm to counter the pain in my stomach, and blindly threw my flashbang and my two fragmentation grenades in his direction. first bang, the flashbang, followed by two loud explosions. In my helmet the words “WARZONE VICTORY” Were displayed. I had won.

Less than 30 seconds later, a helicopter descended followed by two soldiers who instructed me to get into the helicopter. seconds later we were above the gas and air was breathable again.

“Can I go home?” I asked one of them.

No answer.

As we flew away, I remembered my sniper friend who saved me and a winning chart was displayed in my helmet.



Winners from Verdansk competitions, will have a fight in Ashika Island

Winners from Al Mazrah competitions, will have a fight in Caldera

Winners from Ursikztan competitions, will have a fight in Area 99



Final winners will have the final showdown at Rebirth Island.

So here's the idea:

I'm planning to open a fresh forex account, fund it with an amount I'm completely okay with losing (think of it as entertainment money), and wait for one of those classic Trump bombshell moments. When it hits, I’ll place a trade with high leverage, no take profit, and just a trailing stop to manage the chaos.

A month ago I had a pretty bad episode where I thought I was going to die. It came out of nowhere. One minute I was fine and the next my heart was beating right out of its chest, my entire body was tingling head to toe, I was lightheaded, dizzy, rapid heartbeat, chest pain and shortness of breath. It felt like I was going to faint. This was during Ramadan and I had been fasting. I had just opened my fast with a latte and sandwich and was on my way home from work to eat more food. I had been opening my fast with coffee and a sandwich for weeks and wasn’t waking up to eat. 

I ended up buying myself coconut water, calming myself down and going home. I thought it was dehydration and an electrolyte balance. Didn’t think much of it cause it was Ramadan. 

I thought I was going to get better after Ramadan. 

Since that day I’ve been dealing with lingering symptoms that are persistent and I’m getting pretty worried. I have a mini hyperventilation attack where my body tingles almost every day with shortness of breath. Always in the morning. I’m having a pinching right sided chest pain, shortness of breath, body tingles, random finger numbness and persistent lightheadedness and dizziness. 

The dizziness and vertigo has gotten bad. I went to the doctor and she did an EKG and said everything was normal. I ended up getting a chest x ray done, blood tests, another EKG, d dimer, electrolytes and troponin checked at the ER. The only thing that was low was my Eosonophil and my CO2. They said that it was a panic attack. 

I’m getting very very worried. This has never happened to me before and I’m scared. The dizziness and balance is crazy. I did go back to the gym and when I’m doing intense cardio is the only time I get relief from these symptoms. 

I am going to follow up with my pcp as well.

TW: Language

I knew the day would come!

8 Months ago myself and my Partner were made homeless and left in debt by my Father after he backed out of an agreement to let us live on his land while saving for our own house early, because his wife deemed me to be an issue for their marriage.  They made me feel like absolute dogshit! 

I was homeless for the second time because of these people, you can't blame a teenager when it happens to them, but when it happened as an Adult because we placed trust in someone and took a risk, it made me feel so fucking stupid!

I fought as best I could at the time to get him to let us to stay, threatened legal action etc. but in the end, I had some health issues I was in the process of having investigated, and the stress just wasn't worth the strain it was putting on my relationship or our mental health.

I told one person in my Family what happened as I believed I could trust them, and coincidentally, anything my Father came out with, also came out of their mouth so that stopped fairly lively and I isolated myself away from a lot of my Family. 

The second we left their property, despite having no where to live, and all our belongings and the dog in the car, health concerns and all, it was as though we never really lived there at all because it was never home to us and we were always walking on eggshells. 

I'd been getting increasing contact recently as there are some weddings coming up for people I was close to growing up, and I had to turn down 1 as I've had a procedure done recently which seemed to draw other people out of the woodwork, but when I say my nervous system knew something was brewing, I can't even begin to explain how accurate that was. 

During the week I noticed that my Father had changed his profile picture from him and his wife to just him and that all the posts she had previously tagged him in were removed from his social media page. I knew something had happened between them, but didn't question it as I am keeping to myself and trying my best to keep distance. 

I received a phone call the other day from my Grandmother to tell me that he had some stuff going on and could I 'Be kind' to him. I was taken back by this and asked if she knew that we were kicked out 8 months ago and treated very badly by both my Father and his wife (because he has a kick for blaming everything on the wife so that he won't look bad, but is every bit just as twisted). She told me that she had only found out the day before, apologised, and was reaching out to me as a peace keeper. 

Now, I wasn't going to argue with this woman who is almost in her 90's, after all this is her Son, but I did voice the fact that I was going to protect myself and keep my distance, however, I would give him a call. She was understanding with that fact, sounded remorseful about the whole situation, told me that I have done well for myself and wished me well.  

This was 2 days ago and I still haven't given him a call. I don't really want to. 

Our lives have improved so so much for the better since we distanced ourselves from the negative energy - My health issue that was being investigated (for almost 4 years! lead to a resolution and I had major surgery a couple of weeks ago for it, and it's looking like it's finally over. We have never been in a better place mentally or in our relationship, financially, pretty much set a date for our wedding, we are recovering well although still peeved about a loan left over from it all and so so much other positives that I can't go into too much detail here. 

There are two minds to me at the moment: 

1 - Why should I give him a call? I haven't been un-kind to him. I did voice my frustration on the phone with him 2 weeks after we left when he called trying to meet for coffee, never offered an apology and was acting as if nothing was wrong and we should still be best friends. 

2 - I don't want to have any regrets. it's hard to go no contact with your parents, it's hard to tell them exactly what they did to you, what the effects it had and how it made you feel. I don't want to either regret loading off all of this on him, and equally, if I do, I don't want to regret that either. 

I know his situation now is that his wife and kids are sitting in the comfy house that he worked himself into the ground to provide and she paid nothing towards, while he has had to go back to my Grandparents home (again). He has no friends around him to lean on because he alienated almost everybody that wasn't family for this toxic woman he married, and the expectation is for me to walk in and pick him up off the floor emotionally yet again. 

To be honest, 3 weeks after a major surgery, I don't really want to, and I don't think I'd want to even if I was in a better position to support it, I had to dig myself out of a hole he put me in for the second time in my life......

Fool me once shame on you, 

Fool me twice, shame on me.

I run a dev outsourcing company, and I can't tell you how many times I've heard: ""Outsourcing slows down your SaaS development.""

This drives me NUTS because it's literally the opposite of what we see every day.

Actually, outsourcing speeds it up. By a lot.

I didn't believe it myself until I dug into the data. There's this survey from Toptal that found SaaS companies outsourcing just 30% of their development work cut their development cycles by 45%. That's almost HALF the time to ship features.

Last month, I was grabbing coffee with a client who nearly hugged me (awkward, but kinda nice lol). His exact words: ""I was drowning before we started working together. Now I actually see my kids before bedtime.""

This dude went from being a sleep-deprived code monkey to actually running his business again. His team shipped more in 8 weeks with us than the previous 6 months on their own.

Here's what I've learned from 5+ years in this business: founders who outsource don't just get code written faster. They get their LIVES back. They can focus on the stuff that truly matters talking to customers, refining the product vision, or (shocking idea) maybe even taking a weekend off.

So if you're reading this at 2 AM, energy drink in hand, wondering how the hell you're gonna build all those features your customers are screaming for... maybe consider that doing it all yourself isn't actually the fastest way.

Anyone else been on either side of the outsourcing fence? What's been your experience? I'm genuinely curious because this industry is full of horror stories, but also some pretty incredible wins.",0,1744472798.0,SaaS,0,0.5,False

Love it, the short range is ideal for getting our 3 little kids to school/daycare daily and the size is manageable for getting around traffic, parking, etc. 2 days a week when I’ve got to go to the office, I either pick up all the kids or take my own car. My commute is short, only 14 miles, all stop and go LA streets in heavy traffic. I sometimes get to use one of the highly coveted EV chargers at work.

My own car is an e39 M5. It’s super fun and fits 3 full sized car seats but shall we say isn’t ideal heavy traffic commute car? If plans change and my wife has to drive it, she especially hates the part of getting kids in seats. I fire up that NA v8 and let it warm up a minute, me and the kids are greeted stinky exhaust, after which I get 8-10 mpg revving the stick shift thru traffic. As a second car, our gas costs are not that bad given short commute, but it’s not really the family car that fits our purpose.

The system truly breaks down when in laws come to town. Go to a coffee shop? Take two cars. Yes it works but a more spacious car is the solution. It really has to have 6 seats, 7 would be a lot better.

At first I wanted a suburban / Yukon XL sized. We rented one for a family road trip (we do these once a year) and loved it. I wonder though if it’s too much for me to get around the city thru heavy traffic. A bit smaller and it’s a Toyota Sequoia which does a bit better in gas. The reality though of a pure gas car is whenever I think I need to get around, I’ll probably borrow my wife’s car so I can use that electric range, then if plans change she’ll need to drive that monster.

Large electric SUVs, or even plug in hybrids don’t exist. I love this Wagoneer Ramcharger in theory but it’s not available yet and I think the price will be ridiculous.

Yes a pure electric would probably be ideal for my needs getting around the city. But since really large cars do not exist I’ll need to settle for something smaller. A Tesla X or Mercedes EQS SUV would be great but maybe I can find something a bit bigger. I do love that used electric cars have gotten so cheap!


I’ve been turned off by the Volvo XC90 and stuff by Kia etc because they seem too minivan. Maybe I gotta get over it, you tell me.

That leaves the two real options, a Rivian R1s and a Lincoln Aviator Grand Touring. The Rivian seems big enough but wow the prices have really not come down like every other electric car. Maybe these great lease deals I’m seeing will work out for me.

The worry is reports that handling at highway speeds seems sketchy, though it’s really a city car for me.

So the aviator plug in. What’s that really like to drive around the city? Seems to check all the boxes, especially used car prices. I really don’t see many of these driven around here, so I have no point of reference. Is it really a big lumbering car in stop and go traffic? I’d try to get an extended warranty to avoid what might be bad reliability issues.

I'll build a picture of where I'm at, however, if you dont want to read the full story, a TLDR is at the bottom, you'll get the jist.

First time post. Thinking of doing an extended fast for the first time. To clarify my ""somewhat beginner"" part of the title, I've never voluntarily fasted for long periods before (though when having break ups with exes, my emotional response is to lose all appetite and switch to a mainly coffee/cigarette diet for 2 weeks with forced small amounts of food every couple days). Over the last 6 months, I've been on a diet and exercise regime, and my diet has been mostly intermittent fasting with OMAD alternating between solids one day, and a home made smoothie the next. My average calorie intake has been 935 on the smoothie day and about 1,050 on the solids day. I called that the ""strip"" phase, doing that for 4 weeks, followed by a week period of increased protein intake averaging about 1,600 calorie a day, followed by another 4 week ""strip"" then a month of maintaining and less restrictive to give my body a chance to catch up.

I started at 14 stone 3lbs (199 pounds/90kgs) and the weight flew off me over a 2 month period and lost 2 stone 4lbs (32 pounds/14.5kg). I took a break around Christmas and new year and picked back up in February, but it's been a slog since, and I've barely lost another stone (14lbs/6.35kg) in the past 2 months. The past month has been a real slog with just 3.5lbs (1.6kg) dropped. I'm currently 10 stone 13.5 lbs (157.5lbs/69.6kg). Sounds good, and I'm very happy with the progress because I haven't been this low since high-school. I set 4 targets on my journey, 11.5 stone (minimum), 11 stone (ideal), 10.5 (push) and <10 (challenge). So I've beaten 2. There's still more to go, my BMI is 24.7, so right at the high end of the ""normal"" range. There's still a pouch oh my belly when sat down, too.

YouTube recommended a video of a guy doing a 7 day water fast, and that got me curious. Some research done, some reading on here done. Initially, I was going to just go for it and do 7 days from Monday evening, the idea is to lose that last stone I want to shift, but I was also wanting to hit autophagy. The more I think of it now, though, the more I think a straight 7 days off the bat is a bit extreme and maybe just go for a 24, 48 or 72 hour fast instead. I don't need to rush it off for any reason, I'd just like to be slim for the first time during the summer, which, with me being in the UK, is likely to be on a Tuesday in July. So there's no immediate rush to push it off and perhaps shorter periods but frequent is the way to go, with maybe a 7 day period once I've hit, or just before I hit the <10 stone target to finish it off.

As i say, weight loss is the target, but id also like to hit autophagy. However, I think with being a smoker, I'd get greater benefits from autophagy once I quit (next on my improvement list). So I'm more concerned about pushing myself over the edge of my last targets and being able to say ""I actually did it"", which, in fairness, I've already been able to say being under 11 stone for the first time in adult life.

Anyway, I've built the back story and set my targets.

I usually take supplements each morning, out of habit really. Usually multi vits and minerals, Omega 3,6,9 and iron. If I do fast for, say, 72 hours or just go for the 7, should I keep taking them or just stop them for the period? The video I watched, the guy added table salt to his coffee or water (wasn't clear which), is that something worth doing? From my understanding, refeeder syndrome is only an issue above 5 days, so if i did a 3 day I shouldn't have much issue eating again, correct?

So what are your tips and advice? Start slow with 24/48/72 hour ones? Or stop getting in my own head and just go for a 7 day? Multi vits? 

**TLDR**

Been doing OMAD on and off for about 6 months. Lost 3 stone 4lbs. Got another stone to go. Target is by UK summer, so a couple months to play with. Never voluntarily done extended fasts. Should I do short fasts of 24/48/72 hours weekly/couple times a week? Or just go for the 7 day? And should I continue taking my multi vits and minerals for the period or stop them?

Etsy, my friend, is that perfect garden. It's not just about the soil, or in this case, the platform; it's about nurturing your creativity and letting it reach those who will truly appreciate its beauty.

First off, picture Etsy as a bustling marketplace, like a grand bazaar where each stall holds a treasure trove of unique and handcrafted items. With over 90 million active buyers as of late 2023, Etsy offers you a vast and diverse audience that's already searching for something special. It's like setting up your art show in a venue where everyone walks in with an open mind and a keen eye for the extraordinary.

Now, let’s talk about the community. Etsy isn’t just a platform; it’s a vibrant ecosystem, a supportive network of like-minded artisans and enthusiasts. Imagine being part of a club where everyone speaks your language, understands the nuances of creation, and encourages you to grow. Through forums and teams, you can connect, collaborate, and learn from fellow sellers, sparking ideas like a match ignites a flame.

Here's another juicy fact: Etsy is committed to sustainability, which is as refreshing as a cool breeze on a hot day. In a world increasingly concerned with ethical consumption, this commitment resonates with buyers looking to support eco-friendly practices. Selling here aligns your art with these values, enhancing its appeal to conscientious consumers.

And then there's the ease of use. Setting up shop on Etsy is as simple and satisfying as brewing a perfect cup of coffee. The platform is intuitive, guiding you through the process of listing your creations, managing sales, and communicating with customers. It’s like having a personal assistant who’s always ready to lend a hand, so you can focus more on what you love—creating.

Lastly, Etsy's marketing tools are like a well-stocked toolbox, offering everything from promotional features to analytics that help you understand your audience better. Imagine having a map that guides you through the bustling streets of this marketplace, showing you where your art is most appreciated and helping you reach even further.

So, what do you think? Could Etsy be the garden where your art not only survives but truly thrives? Visualize the possibilities, and maybe, just maybe, take that leap. Your art deserves to be seen, appreciated, and cherished by the world. Why not start here?",1,1744472389.0,EtsyArt,0,1.0,False

I have been livid all night because I genuinely may be married to the dumbest person to ever live. I am going to keep our fight short because I got such a sweet email this week and I've been wanting to make sure that I give that person their due attention. 

But I can't help it, I can't believe my husband (well maybe I can, that's the problem). As we were going to bed last night he hits me with ""hey sorry I forgot to tell you, I'm going to take my dad and the kids flying tomorrow."" It didn't really process through my brain so first I said that he didn't have a reserve weekend and I didn't understand. He said that no, he had arranged to rent one of those tiny little airplanes and they were go to go explore the area from the air.

I was like no dude you are not. I'm potentially hours away from giving birth, you've been working insane hours, I hate flying and the last thing I need is to fucking be scared shitless that my husband and two kids are in a flying little death trap. I put up with the military stuff because he loves and gets paid but this was too far. I could go on about the fight for hours but suffice to say, we both dug our heels in. I didn't sleep a wink thinking through all the scenarios that could potentially happen. My in-laws showed up early so they could head to an airport that in itself is too far away for Bubs to be when I'm so close to going into labor. How do I know that I'm right in this one? Even my mother in law is taking my side and told Bubs and my father in law how dumb this was and how disappointed she's going to be in both of them if she ends up being the one to drive me to the hospital. Bubs wouldn't listen to her either and when the kids heard the news they were thrilled so as typical Bubs put me in the position to be the grumpy bitch of a mom who never lets anyone have any fun while he's the chill surfer dude who lets the kids figuratively play with fire (and probably literally, I can't monitor his stupid ass all the time). So I am inside of a week of my due date, things are moving along and my husband is taking my kids up in what looks to me like a little metal coffin. He promised me since they are leaving early they'll be back by 1pm. I don't know if I've ever hated a person as much as I hate him right now. I could go on and on about this one but I'm forcing myself to stop. 

To keep my mind busy and not obsess over findmyfriends, I'm going to respond to a very sweet email I got this week from one of you guys. I know a few people have rediscovered me over the past few weeks so what I assume is happening is that the YouTube algorithm is pushing that one guys (ridiculous) take on our story or maybe some other subreddit is discussing us again. My blog views are way up this week so  I have no idea but thankfully everyone who has come back into the fold has been super sweet. 

Here's the email (and as always if you would like to email me, its danniynnad@gmail.com, I've also been pretty active on reddit lately and my name over there is u/DecentData5441): 

*I first came across your story last summer when everything was unfolding online—I first saw your story on YouTube which led me to Reddit and was genuinely upset when it seemed like you had just disappeared. I recently stumbled across your blog and was so relieved to see you hadn’t stopped writing after all.*

*I know your story is deeply personal, but I think it struck a chord with so many of us navigating unexpected life shifts in our mid to late 30s. If I’m remembering correctly, your Reddit posts—and even some of your early blog entries—had a heavy, almost manic energy mixed with a lot of pain. (I hope that’s not offensive—I just mean to say it felt very raw and real.) Your recent posts, though, feel so much lighter and more grounded, and I just wanted to say how inspiring that’s been to witness.*

*I’ve been going through a tough stretch myself lately—some personal things that have left me feeling pretty low and stuck. Seeing the growth in your writing makes me wonder: what helped you the most? Was it therapy, lifestyle changes, something else entirely?*


*If you’re open to sharing any insight, I’d be really grateful. Either way, thank you for being so honest with your journey—it’s made a bigger impact than you probably realize.*

This email made me sob openly it was so sweet. There are a few other details more personal to this person that I left out but they did say it was ok if I blogged about it. So I guess  have to say that I am in no way a medical professional so please don't take this as like the end all be all of advice. There are people who will absolutely disagree with me (my Aunt Lotti hasn't spoken to me or my mom since August, I'll get more into why in a minute). I think I also need to fully recognize that either through the lords eternal blessing or just dumb luck, I am very fortunate to have such an amazing family and support system that some people may not have access to. But they emailer is correct, I am much happier than I was and I've even been pregnant--and while I have had my moments (as in Bubs getting his balls cut off the second he gets home today), I think the combination of everything I'm about to talk about has helped me through the pregnancy as well. 

I've documented our journey with my and our therapists pretty extensively but I would be remiss if I didn't re-acknowledge how much of a role they played. But maybe even more important is that we got very lucky in that the ones that worked were almost brutally honest and said things that were hard to hear but they didn't pull punches. The reddit blow up was probably the culmination of about a year of Bubs and I being very distant from each other and through that whole time I was seeing an individual therapist. I liked her but looking back she never challenged me, she never told me that something was right or wrong, I feel like I paid a lot of money just to complain to someone. When Bubs and I started seeing the marriage counselor she would say things like ""Dani, your behavior is causing him to resent you."" Her advice was direct, it didn't waste a lot of time and got to the nuts and bolts of our issues really quickly. The same can be said for the therapist I was seeing remotely who specializes in Sexual Assault recovery. I think for obvious reasons, she's a lot more delicate but she's amazing at helping me talk it out and get to a place of insight. One thing I really liked about her is that even though I was a victim (a word I hate), she's very big into finding areas where I need to take responsibility for my choices that led up to what happened. I can see how that might really upset a lot of victims and that may not be for everyone but for me, it was exactly what I needed to hear.  

So if I talk about the good therapists, I have to address the bad. Our marriage counselor referred me to a psychiatrist who is part of a group that tries to treat mental illness as a whole body and life disorder as opposed quick 15 minute sessions and a prescription. The psychiatrist her self was amazing but part of treatment plan was to have me meet with an individual counselor. I had two appointments with him and we didn't click at all. I'm sure he's competent and professional but nothing he said resonated with me and I felt like was almost playing a ""therapist on TV."" My point being don't be afraid to move on. I should have followed that advice with the lady I saw in the year leading up to me and Bubs blow up but I wasn't making the same mistake twice. It took a few months to find the lady who specializes in SA recovery but I'm so glad I didn't waste any time with the counselor the psychiatrist recommended. 

Like I mentioned the psychiatrist  had a team of people that she had me see. One of the was a dietician. For many years, I ate like crap. I would rush around the in morning like a crazy person and not have anything but 3 cups of coffee before I would eat a few pieces of candy at lunch and then rush home to try to figure out what to feed the kids and then would eat very quick meals, usually standing up over the counter while I rushed around to finish up the nightly chores. The dietician basically said that had to stop. He is a huge advocate for meats, fruits and vegetables in order to hit a daily protein goal while limiting sugar. I think more than anything, including the therapy, making the changes to my diet has made me a much happier and healthy person. I think it is essentially a whole life reordering that affects everything from how I slept to how much energy I had in the mornings to how alert I was when the kids got home from school. I mean it's kind of like a self supporting eco-system, I felt better in the afternoons because I would eat a good lunch, I didn't blow up at the kids over minor things and they were happier and wouldn't be at each other's throats (as much). Bubs would emerge from his office to find us all going over the days events instead of me refereeing a physical fight. He would be calmer and more involved. The kids went to bed with much less anxiety, so did Bubs and I which led to us rediscovering our intimate life instead of the infrequent mechanical sex we'd grown so accustomed to. Those nights led to better mornings which led to better days and repeat. While all of my therapists have advised me to avoid thinking in terms of ""silver bullets,"" me changing my diet has been as close to one as I've ever seen. My mental health is one thing, but I also can't believe the changes to my skin and hair and this will sound crazy but my boobs seem to sit a little higher and I've lost a little of the sag in my tummy and butt. Some of this can be attributed to pregnancy but I know my sisters (who always ate better than me anyways) got inspired and we would prepare meals together--and my sister Jenn's DDD bust started to look like she was in her 20s again and she's had 3 kids. Again I hope I'm not too off topic and I can't vouch that diet will have the same effect for everyone but for me, it's been truly life changing. 

So having said that, I was also pregnant so I needed to get more calories than I would normally so I was not a restrictive as I probably will go back to being when the time is right. So I would still treat myself but the advice from the dietician was no ""empty"" calories. For example if I wanted something sweet, it also had to have some ""good"" parts to it as well so I exchanged all the candy, cookies and cakes I ate for things like ice cream which were much more filling and could help me hit my protein goals. We've also had the amazing Genevieve staying with us who grew up with her Hispanic grandmother who taught her everything she knew about cooking traditional New Mexican food which sometimes is very carb heavy. Those meals are delicious but I can really feel the sluggishness after I eat something with a lot of carbs. Since Brian and Bubs have been on a mostly carnivore diet to help support their long distance running, Evie has done a really good job of adapting her traditional foods into a really decent middle ground which will allow me to keep going with my diet goals. 

I can't stress enough that this is what has worked for me and I am not giving outright advice. My mom's sister Lotti got so upset with me when I was talking about how much better I felt that she accused me of giving irresponsible medical advice and will not speak to me and told me mom that as long as I'm ""promoting dangerous theories"" she doesn't want to have anything to do with us. Lotti tried to convince me that the only method for treating ""our family's depression"" is to go on anti-depressants and plan on staying on them for the rest of my life and my diet talk was crap. I don't want to get too deep into this but I went to a psychiatrist and we talked about medications and she would have been willing to prescribe them but wanted to exercise caution while I was pregnant. I do have some opinions about medications based on my experience in the classroom and I know what I would chose for my own kids. But everyone is entitled to their own opinions and I would never tell an adult to not chose medications if that's what their doctor prescribed--but I've always been so confused by Aunt Lotti's reaction and I don't see how getting better fuel to run the engine was something that is worth not speaking to me over. As a total aside, Lotti is the aunt who raised my cousins so they were never allowed to fight or disagree and now they don't even know each other--my sisters and I were mean and nasty to each other on daily basis and we are the best of friends as adults. So I think Lotti's issues may be more about control--and I also think she might be happier if she had fostered the same sort of family atmosphere that my mom did. 

I know this turned into a long winded, self indulgent post but again I'm trying to keep my mind busy. I can see that they made it to the airport and I assume Bubs will have to turn his phone off so I am going to lose my findmyfriends connection with him shortly. Thank god Evie is here and I can hear her starting to get up and moving and just got off the phone with my brother. So she can fill me in on how Brian is doing in Argentina...he has a meeting with the new president's staff and maybe the president himself. Which my dad is falling all over himself because my dad is Ron Swanson incarnate, including the hard core Libertarianism and the new president is making my dad consider moving he and my mom out of Texas to a foreign country. OK, I'm really rambling now. But Evie is pissed at Bubs too so she's telling me that if he can go flying while I'm about to pop, she can take me to Target to waddle around and spend his money. God I love her--it's a date. It's such a big event for me to leave the house to do something fun, I'm going to put on makeup and say that the Target trip is my light walk for the day--a very, very expensive light walk.

I find it really hard to feed myself and I’m cold most nights. I found myself in this situation due to an injury I had at work years ago. I sadly couldn’t work and my rent built up and I was evicted. The government won’t house me because they claim to not have a “duty of care” towards me. I’m sick of being poor and hungry and I’ve just had enough. I go to the church once a week to be fed but they won’t allow me to sleep inside the church. My family can’t help because they’ve said I’m a grown man and need to create my own life. I would happily work myself out of this situation but with my injury it causes me to limp and I’m in constant pain. I live in the forest just outside of the town centre and it’s hard enough without the constant pain shooting through my legs. Being homeless has shown me how cruel humans can be. I’ve had my tent slashed, my bike destroyed and people making comments. I believe I’m a strong individual but there’s only so much one person can take. My campsite was put on the local Facebook page. Not for being dirty but just someone claiming I'm ""a danger to dogs and children."" Yeah? Your children are the ones that knifed my tent and destroyed my bike which is the only thing that gave my legs a rest.

Second parlay is more of a long shot I think Marco Tulio Silva gets a finish. I just don’t think Tresean is a high level fighter. Marco Tulio also apart of Chute Box, hopefully he channels his inner Wanderlei Silva like he usually does and puts Tresean to bed early today 💤 😴 

A lot more action on this card like I said DM to get the full breakdown. Too much to type out on here.

1jxjtjy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jxjtjy,Trying something new! Weekly calories as opposed to daily.,"I get frustrated by the daily tracking and quickly slip up, so I'm trying something new this time. Tracking WEEKLY calories! I'm on week 3 of this and it's been going smashingly, so I wanted to share.

I used an online calculator to determine the number of calories per day I should consume to loose 1 lb per week given my current height/weight and activity level. 1850 or 1900 calories was the ballpark number i was given. My weekly goal is about 13,000 to 13,300 cal.

I plan my three major meals for the whole week, and include other calories I know I'm going to consume (daily coffee, beer at happy hour). Say my 21 meals and extras puts me at 11,500 calories for the week, this gives me 1500 to 1800 cals to consume on anything I want through the week. If HH is canceled and i dont drink beer, I get those calories back to play with.

For planning/tracking, I first plan my week in my journal. I then add all my food to one single day on my tracking app (I use MFP) to get my total weekly calories. As I snack throughout the week, I add my snacks to the same day as all my other food for the week. I like to pick at things, so I portion snack into containers, add to MFP, then I just snack without thinking about it over a couple days. If I refill the container, I add another portion to MFP.

I keep track of the meals I eat by highlighting them in my journal. If I got busy and forgot to eat lunch one day (unfortunately it happens), I delete that meal from MFP to see how many calories I have left/actually consumed that week.

I'll report back in a couple months, but im excited because this method is much less daunting! ",5,1744471640.0,CICO,2,0.86,False
1jxjthd,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1jxjthd/the_auditors/,The Auditors,"The K’tharr Ascendancy didn’t conquer, they absorbed. Systems blinked out of galactic communication grids, resources were seamlessly integrated, populations indexed, and consciousnesses, if deemed compatible, were uploaded to the Great Chorus. Resistance was illogical, inefficient, and ultimately, futile against their fleets of silent, obsidian ships that moved with the cold precision of mathematics.

When the first K’tharr Assimilator vessel, *Inevitability’s Embrace*, translated into Sol’s gravity well, its arrival was less invasion, more… scheduled event. Scans confirmed a Class-G star, a suitable high-gravity terrestrial world teeming with chaotic biologicals, designated “Humans.” Primitive fusion tech, fledgling interplanetary travel, noisy electromagnetic spectrum – a standard Stage 3 Uplift candidate ripe for absorption.

The High Executor aboard *Inevitability’s Embrace*, a crystalline entity designated K’lakt-7, prepared the standard assimilation protocols. Hail the dominant planetary authority. Offer integration. If refused, dismantle defensive capabilities (projected duration: 17 Earth hours). Begin resource indexing. Simple. Efficient.

The hailing signal was sent. The response, when it came, was… unexpected. Not defiance, not pleas, not even frantic military codes. It was a meticulously formatted data packet.

*ATTN: Unidentified Vessel K'THARR ASCENDANCY INEVITABILITY'S EMBRACE*  
*REF: UNAUTHORIZED ENTRY INTO TERRAN SOVEREIGN SPACE (SOL SECTOR, GRID 7-ALPHA)*  
*SUBJECT: NOTICE OF VIOLATION AND PENDING COMPLIANCE AUDIT*

*Dear K'lakt-7 (or designated representative),*

*Please be advised that your vessel has entered Terran Sovereign Space without prior clearance, submitted flight plans, or necessary customs declarations (ref: Sol Treaty Art. 14, Sub. B; Terran Space Navigation Act Sec. 401a). This constitutes multiple procedural violations.*

*Furthermore, your vessel exceeds standard tonnage limits for unauthorized entry and possesses capabilities designated ""Potentially Disruptive"" (ref: Planetary Security Mandate 77-Gamma).*

*Pursuant to Interstellar Commerce & Sovereignty Protocol 9B, a Terran Unified Compliance Directorate (TUCD) Audit Team will be dispatched to your vessel within one (1) standard Terran rotation (24 hours) to assess compliance status, calculate applicable tariffs, fees, and penalties, and determine appropriate regulatory remediation.*

*Failure to comply with the audit process will result in escalating sanctions, including but not limited to vessel impoundment, resource liens, and potential classification as a Hostile Entity (HE) under directive Crimson-Talon-4.*

*Please prepare all relevant documentation for inspection: ship's manifest, crew roster (with biological certifications), energy core specifications, waste disposal logs for the past 5 cycles, intended resource utilization plans, and proof of non-contamination protocols.*

*We trust this clarifies the immediate requirements. Your cooperation is mandated.*

*Sincerely,*  
*Agnes Periwinkle*  
*Chief Compliance Auditor, TUCD Outer Rim Division*  
*Terran Unified Government*

K’lakt-7 ran the translation through its logic cores seven times. It accessed the K’tharr historical archives for precedents. There were none. Conquest protocols didn't involve… *tariffs*. Or *waste disposal logs*.

Confused, K’lakt-7 signaled the fleet. *Hold position. Analyzing anomalous communication.*

Twenty-four hours later, a small, decidedly unimpressive shuttlecraft detached itself from Earth’s orbital clutter and sedately approached *Inevitability’s Embrace*. It ignored the K’tharr vessel's defensive energy fields (which hummed harmlessly around its basic shielding) and requested docking permission, citing Regulation 11-Delta regarding auditor access.

K’lakt-7, against every strategic instinct, granted permission. Perhaps direct interaction would resolve this… absurdity.

Three humans emerged. They wore drab grey uniforms, carried bulky dataslates, and possessed an air of weary determination. The leader, Agnes Periwinkle, was a short, middle-aged woman with severe spectacles perched on her nose.

“K’lakt-7, I presume?” she stated, not asked, consulting her slate. “Agnes Periwinkle, TUCD. These are my associates, Mr. Henderson (Logistics & Manifests) and Ms. Choi (Environmental & Biohazard Compliance). We require a secure workspace with standard atmospheric pressure, adequate lighting, and access to your vessel’s primary operational database. And coffee, if available. Black.”

K’lakt-7 attempted to interject, to explain the nature of the K’tharr Ascendancy, the futility of resistance, the offer of integration.

Agnes held up a hand. “Please reserve existential discourse until after the preliminary compliance check, Executor. Mr. Henderson requires your full cargo manifest and drive emission logs for the past operational cycle. Ms. Choi needs access to your bio-filter maintenance records and invasive species quarantine procedures. Standard procedure.”

For the next three standard Terran days, the K’tharr command deck, designed for the elegant execution of galactic conquest, became a nightmarish landscape of procedural inquiries.

“Executor K’lakt-7, I see here you jettisoned processed stellar particulate matter in Sector 6-Gamma. Did you file Form 8812/P for controlled particulate discharge?” Henderson droned, tapping his slate.

“Your internal atmospheric scrubbers appear to lack certification under the Draco Accords for filtration of Class-4 airborne microbes. We’ll need a full diagnostic and potentially a retrofit order,” Ms. Choi noted, peering at a console readout.

“Regarding Article 17, Subsection C, concerning ‘Undeclared Intentions within a Sovereign Zone’,” Agnes Periwinkle stated, adjusting her glasses. “Your stated objective of ‘assimilation’ lacks the required Terran Ethical Review Board pre-approval (Form ERB-101A) and fails to adequately outline proposed resource compensation schedules. The preliminary penalty calculations for this alone are… significant.”

The K’tharr logic cores, designed to process stellar dynamics and fleet logistics, began dedicating increasing cycles to understanding Terran regulatory frameworks. They attempted cross-referencing, optimization, finding loopholes. There were none. The regulations were a fractal labyrinth of bylaws, amendments, precedents, and sub-clauses, seemingly designed with a maddening internal consistency that defied large-scale logical prediction but demanded granular adherence.

K’lakt-7 found its directives conflicting. *Objective: Assimilate Planet. Obstacle: Form 77B requires notarized proof of waste heat mitigation plan. Objective: Neutralize Obstacle. Method: Filing Form 77B requires data currently sequestered pending completion of Audit Inquiry 14-Sigma.*

After seventy-two Earth hours of relentless, soul-crushing bureaucratic interrogation, compliance checks, and the generation of violation notices that now exceeded the data storage capacity of K’lakt-7’s personal memory crystal, the High Executor made a calculation.

The projected energy and temporal cost of navigating Terran bureaucracy, including potential penalties and mandated retrofits, now exceeded the projected resource value of the entire Sol system by a factor of 3.7. Continued engagement was… inefficient.

“Terran Auditors,” K’lakt-7 transmitted, its crystalline structure resonating with something akin to weariness. “We… require time to collate the requested documentation. We shall withdraw beyond Terran Sovereign Space to compile the necessary data.”

Agnes Periwinkle looked up from a dense printout detailing K’tharr personnel hygiene protocols (or lack thereof). “Very well, Executor. Please note that withdrawal does not negate accrued penalties. We will forward the preliminary invoice to your designated administrative contact within 5-7 standard business days. Do ensure your communication channels remain open for future correspondence.”

*Inevitability’s Embrace*, followed by the rest of the K’tharr fleet, translated out of the Sol system with a haste bordering on undignified.

Back on the TUCD shuttle, Henderson let out a long, shaky breath. “Whew. For a minute there, I thought cross-referencing their FTL emissions against Environmental Protection Mandate 7-Stroke-Omega wasn’t going to work. That K’lakt-7 looked ready to file us under ‘Debris’.”

Ms. Choi managed a weak grin. “You saw its data-ports flicker when Agnes brought up the retroactive docking fees, right? Pure panic, translated into binary.”

Agnes Periwinkle tidied her stack of forms with crisp precision. “Precisely as projected, colleagues. Brute force fails against their logic. But introduce Regulation CC-1099-Sub-Paragraph-Delta, concerning ‘Intentional Failure to Declare Invasive Mental Constructs,’ and their efficiency algorithms short-circuit.” She allowed herself a rare, thin smile. “Some species build planetary shields. We weaponized the multi-part form. Far more effective against beings who think assimilation can be scheduled.”",10,1744471635.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

For context, we have been together for about 2.5 years. Before I met him, he was single his entire life. We met online through mutual friends and quickly connected and shared a lot of common interests. 

Fast forward to present day, we are now recently engaged and living together. His family is very hardcore Christian and do not believe in pre-marital sex, living together pre-marriage and they “require” me to be apart of their church if I marry into the family. After months of back and forth and some drama, his family has become a lot more “chill” with us doing our own thing, however they’re not very supportive/nice about it, they just “allow” it…

Anyways. My boyfriends church is very close, a lot of people in the church have been generational so everybody knows everybody and imo, a lot of it is image related. His family hasn’t told anybody we live together because then people of the church will ask questions they don’t want to answer. To be frank, I’m sure they are “embarrassed” by this as it’s very sinful to them.. 

My boyfriend is planning to leave the church, but he has been getting borderline harassed by elders and deacons from the church asking his whereabouts and to meet up for coffee and chat. He knows they want to ask why he hasn’t been there and he’s been putting it off. Truth be told, he hasn’t told his parents yet he is leaving the church. I believe his parents are hopeful thinking we will just join once we are married but that’s not the case. 

Today, my boyfriend got a call from an elder at the church and said they need to speak with him today so they are calling him after work. He told me he wants to tell his parents first that he’s leaving the church and we are going to find our own place of worship that suits us better. However, this happened once before and his mom was very rude to me and called me all sorts of names and essentially said I was bringing him to hell with me… yeah… Also, we took a break last year due to this drama (when it was all fresh) and his family was telling him he’s better off without me, they’ll hook him up with somebody from their church, and all sorts of rude things. 

Essentially, I’m looking for advice on how to deal with this in a mature and friendly manner. My boyfriend doesn’t want to lose contact with his family and wants everything to work out, but truth be told his family makes me feel uncomfortable because 1) I don’t fit in 2) I know they’re judging me because I’m not in their church group and 3) the past drama is hard for me to overlook. Also, my boyfriend heavily overshared the things his parents said about me behind my back, which have now made me dislike them quite heavily considering all the trash talk directed toward me. 

Another note to make, I am a Christian. I read the bible everyday with my partner, we have a great prayer life & we attend a local church when we have the time or we livestream services…. Apparently, that’s not good enough because their church is the only right way. 

I know this is going to blow up, so I’m seeking advice in advance. I appreciate anybody who took the time to read this all. 

TLDR; partners parents aren’t supportive of our relationship because I won’t join their church. Boyfriend is telling them today that he is leaving the church, I know they will blame me and create drama. Seeking advice! ",2,1744471470.0,relationships,2,1.0,False

I went out with him a few times, nothing EVER happened but we had so much fun, things started going in a romantic way so my friend asked me to decide what to do and I was so attached to my ex that I ended up hurting my friend, he told me he wanted to have some space so I accepted but I was always wondering what could’ve happened if I left my ex and started things with him. I was constantly thinking about him… few years pass and I stumble across my friend, we live in the same town and it’s small so I was weirded out that I never happened to cross paths with him again but I started texting him again, I was still with my ex but at this point this guy and I were not friends, we were just having coffee like once every 5/6 months. He told me he had been doing great but as I was with my ex he wanted to take some time. Another year goes by and he has a girl, i break up with my ex after years and years of suffering and this guy breaks up with his girl. We saw each other in the street and it was so so weird, his eyes started shining, and I felt like I couldn’t breathe. We have been talking on and off and grabbed coffee a few times, he has a lot of work, so do I, but I have to tell you, I still feel something for him. He doesn’t know; I don’t know how I will tell him, I don’t know if I should wait any longer, but I’ve been feeling things for him since I know him, i don’t know what’s happening or if I’m just crazy but i really feel for him, i feel like he’s my person and I don’t know how to proceed 🥲 any help will be appreciated and please don’t judge me I never cheated on my ex and when things got complicated my friend and I always distanced.

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the f*ck out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.


I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. I will probably p*ss you off.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 5 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

Cooking by herself felt a little weird. Before, it had always been a thing they did together. Their bonding time. It was strange not having someone to talk to, so she put on some music and sang along instead. She was still in the Hermes cabin, unclaimed by whoever her father was.

***\[FOREIGN MEMORY SUBJECT DATA SUCCESSFULLY DECOMPILED. INITIATING INTENDED SUBJECT DATA.\]***



**Memory Transcription Subject: Alora of Ferncreek, Order of the Covenant Apprentice**

*Date \[Standardized Human Time\]: September 12, 2136*

My body jerked upright, lungs seizing for air. Before I could stop myself, I flung sideways off the bed, landing hard on the cold floor with a dull *thud*.

My heart was racing. My throat burned. My mind swam.

*That dream…* Except—it hadn’t felt like a dream.

The fear, the pain, the raw panic—it had all felt *real*. Instinctively, I pressed a paw to my throat, half-expecting bruises. I staggered to my feet and rushed to the bathroom, fumbling for the tap. Cold water burst from the faucet, and I shoved my face into it. It was like life itself rushed back into me.

I drank in great gulps, the water icy and pure, as if my body had been parched for hours. Maybe days. I didn’t stop until my chest hurt and my paws trembled.

When I finally looked up into the mirror, I saw it: a faint glow, fading at the edge of my eye. A shiver crawled down my spine.

*That’s going to take some getting used to.*

I leaned over the sink, dripping, catching my breath. The more I thought about it, the more certain I became. That wasn’t just a dream. It was a *memory*.

Someone else’s pain. Someone else’s fight.

The Echo Water hadn’t just connected with me—it had *shown* me something. A life lived long before mine.

I hadn't known what to expect when I stepped into that pool… but it wasn’t *that*.

Those memories… they were harsh. Unfiltered as if I experienced them personally. And they carried terrifying implications.

For all the beauty and harmony the Ascendancy projected, it was clear now that things hadn’t always been so ideal. That life on the fringes—where oversight faded and power turned feral—wasn’t just a blemish in history. It was a truth. A *reality* that someone, somewhere, had lived.

It was easy to forget that. Easy to believe the Ascendancy was perfect as one may have thought the Federation also to be. But what I saw through that pup's eyes painted a much more complicated picture.

The behavior of those thugs—their cruelty, the way they toyed with suffering—validated so many of the fears we’d been taught. *Predators are dangerous.* *Predators cannot be trusted.*

They were predators, weren’t they? Humans. And once upon a time, I would’ve taken that as proof. Proof that the Federation had been right. That the fear drilled into us since childhood wasn’t prejudice—it was *wisdom.*

The Federation would’ve used those memories like fuel. Played them on loop, stripped of context, fed them into classrooms and exterminator seminars. *Look what happens when you let predators in.*

But I knew better now. Those men weren’t symbols of humanity. They were *scum*. Thugs and murderers who took advantage of lawless corners of space. Their evil didn’t stem from forward-facing eyes or omnivorous diets. It came from choice. The same choice available to *anyone*.

And Dare—despite what he suffered, despite being nearly strangled to death by one of them—didn't even think to turn that hatred toward his friend.

He *trusted* her. He didn’t let their violence define her. Or her species. So… I couldn’t either.

Besides, I rather came to like humans I’d come to know. They were strange, yes. Intense, sometimes. But they were also kind. Curious. Just as empathetic. Willing to fight for people who weren’t their own, or rather chose to make them their own. And if that wasn’t worth respecting… what was?

“Up early, are we?”

*Speak of the human.*

I looked up to see Stewart stepping out from the hallway, perfectly composed, his posture straight and that usual unreadable calm on his face. He gave me a sideways glance.

“That would be a first,” he added, adjusting the cuff of his sleeve with meticulous care. “But I suppose miracles do happen sometimes.”

I sighed, dragging a paw down my face as I mentally set aside my philosophical quandaries for now. “Give me a break. *Your* sleeping schedule is insane.”

Stewart raised an eyebrow, but I didn’t let him interrupt. “I still don’t get how you people function on a diurnal cycle. On Skalga, we just took naps every few hours—short rests to stay fresh throughout the waking period. Logical. Efficient.”

I waved a paw vaguely toward the ceiling as if Earth’s sun itself were to blame.

“But on your world? Nooo, you all just… *sleep* for eight, sometimes *nine* straight hours, and then push through the rest of the day in one massive block of consciousness like lunatics. Seventeen hours of being awake? Are you *trying* to die?”

He gave a soft chuckle, and I threw my paws up. “It’s a nightmare. I can’t even get through half your 'normal day' without feeling like I’ve been hit by a freighter. The Skalgans who agreed to that system must’ve been mental.”

“It’s what works for us,” Stewart replied simply before turning away to the kitchen to prepare breakfast.

“Be sure to get ready,” he added over his shoulder. “We have plans for an outing today after basic training.”

My tail gave a curious swish. *Another* outing?

I wondered what kind of crazy thing I’d learn this time. Every trip with these two seemed to shake the foundations of what I thought I knew. At this rate, I half expected them to casually reveal gravity was optional if you believed hard enough.

“Where to?” I asked.

Stewart turned his head, ever composed. “We just got word from the Order’s head. We’ve received clearance to visit Skalga. John wants to take the opportunity to learn more about what’s happened since the original exodus. I’m sure you, as a local, will be able to answer any questions he might have.”

*Back home, huh?* I hadn’t expected to see it again so soon. The thought landed like a stone in my chest—equal parts weight and warmth.

But then another thought struck me, and my ears tilted back as I looked toward Stewart, concern threading through my voice. “Are you going as well?”

“Of course,” Stewart said with a small nod. “Who else is supposed to get John out of trouble when he inevitably *does* get into it?”

I *hoped* he was joking. I *really* hoped he was joking. The last thing we needed back on Skalga was to get caught in some mess. The people there were already on edge—they didn’t need any more reasons to panic. I rubbed my paws together in a nervous tic.

“I’m just… worried,” I admitted. “The people back home are rather… *skittish*.”

He nodded, as if he’d already considered it. “Yes. I was informed that might be a problem. Your Governor wasn’t exactly thrilled about the idea of us exploring the planet.”

Of course he wasn’t.

“But a compromise was reached,” Stewart continued, toasting some oats into a pan with surgical precision. “Humans can visit, so long as they wear face masks and are accompanied by one of *you*.”

He glanced at me, a faint hint of amusement tugging at his mouth. “A bit over the top, if I do say so myself—but given the Federation’s level of fear conditioning, I suppose it's to be expected. *For now*, at least.”

I wasn’t sure if that “for now” was meant to be hopeful or foreboding.

I swiveled my left ear, unease prickling beneath my fur. I knew *exactly* how people would react. Fear did strange things to people—made them irrational, hostile, desperate.

It was obvious now just how much damage fear could cause when left unchecked. *Hopefully,* my presence would help de-escalate things—if it all started to spiral out of paw.

Right then, John emerged from his room with a yawn, stretching his arms overhead. “Breakfast ready yet?” he asked, voice still heavy with sleep. “I could use some much-needed coffee, if you don’t mind.”

Oh *stars*, yes. What *would* I do without that little hot cup of wakefulness?

Stewart was already on it, preparing breakfast like he always did—efficient, silent, focused. Watching him work sometimes felt like watching a symphony of precise movement

With John finally present, I opened my mouth to tell him about the strange dream—or memory—I’d had. The vision from the Echo Water still clung to the edges of my thoughts like morning mist.

But before I could speak, there was a knock at the door. Stewart didn’t flinch. He simply turned off the burner and straightened. “Ah,” he said smoothly, “seems our guests have arrived.”

*“Guest?”* I echoed, confused—but John was already making his way to the door, his steps light and unhurried.

“Ah, you’re all here—and just in time,” he said brightly as he swung the door open. “Stewart’s preparing breakfast for us. Come in, come in!”

“Oh, splendid! You’ve gone on more than one occasion about how excellent a chef your bonded is,” came a familiar voice—laced with good humor and that peculiar refinement.

*Vernon.*

I turned toward the door and spotted him stepping inside, looking as polished as ever despite his age. Beside him was the silent gray-furred Venlil, Cory, and trailing just behind them—

*Kalydia.*

She looked nervous at first—ears slightly back, posture stiff—but the moment her eyes found mine, her expression lit up. Her tail wagged with genuine enthusiasm.

I couldn’t help but return the gesture, offering a happy flick of my ears and a soft trill of greeting. She mirrored it, and in that brief moment, the discomfort melted from her face.

It had only been yesterday when we stood together at the sacred pool—when I’d convinced her to take the plunge, literally and figuratively. She’d emerged from the water looking completely stunned, mystified by what she’d seen. Her eyes, like mine, occasionally shimmered with that eerie, beautiful blue glow.

Apparently, the effect was triggered by elevated emotion—something that took experience to control. She wasn’t alone in that, either.

Terrik had practically radiated with that glow after his own ritual. He was so charged with excitement, it hadn’t stopped for the rest of the night. He practically lit up the street until we all finally parted ways.

Stewart snorted, not even looking up from the pan. “I only got decent at cooking because *this* oaf can’t cook to save his life. Last time he tried, he nearly burned down an entire restaurant.”

John folded his arms with exaggerated indignation. “In case *you* forgot, that restaurant had been completely taken over by its AI systems. The original owner had died and no one thought to shut it down. I was doing everyone a favor.”

“Oh, right,” Stewart said dryly, “by starting a grease fire.”

John raised a finger like he was giving a lecture. “If I *hadn’t* started that grease fire, I would’ve been *on* the menu by evening. That thing had already moved past hospitality and into *culinary experimentation* with the guests.”

Kalydia made a strangled sound halfway between shock and a gasp. “*Excuse me, what?!*”

John just waved a paw—casual and completely unbothered. “A story for another time,” he said cheerfully, as Stewart began plating food with his usual practiced elegance.

“Now then…” John clapped his paws together. “Who’s hungry?”

—

Kalydia and I stood opposite each other in the courtyard, exchanging uncertain glances as our guides called out the next kata. Apparently, after our talk by the sacred pool, she had gone straight to Vernon and Cory and asked for a more focused approach to combat training. While she’d been learning basic self-defense like the rest of us, her curriculum had leaned heavily toward scholarly studies. Physical training had been more of an afterthought in comparison.

Her guides had agreed to the change—but there was a catch. Neither Vernon nor Cory felt confident enough in their own combat instruction to take her to satisfying heights. So they’d turned to John and Stewart, whose experience in that field was in their words... extensive.

And now here we were.

I gripped the wooden sword tightly, the weight of it feeling heavier than usual. Maybe it was the way Kalydia stared at me from my left in the courtyard, her posture stiff, uncertain. Or maybe it was Stewart—silent, unmoving—standing behind us with arms folded neatly behind his back, like a statue carved from command and expectation.

“Ready stance,” he called.

I inhaled, stepping my left foot forward and bringing the blade up to centerline. Kalydia mirrored me, though a beat behind. Her grip was tight—*too* tight. I could see the strain in her fingers, knuckles paling beneath her fur. I probably didn’t look much better.

“Form One. *Laitaru!*”

That one was simple. I stepped forward, raising the blade overhead in a clean arc. My breath came steady, measured. It was getting easier with time. Practice dulled the edge of straining muscles.

Kalydia wasn’t as steady. I could hear her panting already, short sharp breaths as she tried to match the form.

“Strike!”

I brought my blade down in a vertical cut, focusing all my attention on precision—enough force to be decisive, but controlled enough not to swing wild.

My arm burned from the motion, muscles tight from repetition. I held the line but fumbled at the last moment.

“*Stop!*”

I froze mid-motion, the tip of my blade still hovering in the air.

“Alora,” Stewart said, stepping forward with the quiet weight of authority, “your shoulders are too high in your swing.”

He moved behind me, placing a steady hand on my shoulder. His touch was light, but firm enough to guide.

“You’re trying too hard to control the blade,” he said, gently pressing down until I relaxed. “Don’t wrestle with it. You’re not overpowering the sword—you’re *guiding* it.”

I nodded, adjusting my stance, trying to feel the shift. It already felt smoother. Less forced.

Then Stewart turned to Kalydia. “And you—work on your footing. Your stance is too narrow. Without a strong foundation, you’ll trip over your own momentum the moment you try to counter.”

Kalydia’s ears drooped slightly, but she nodded quickly and widened her feet, determined. Suddenly she paused and tentatively raised a paw, her voice uncertain. “Sir… if I may ask, why are we learning to fight in such a pri—archaic manner? Wouldn’t a blaster be more efficient?”

Stewart nodded at the question, seemingly unbothered. “A fair question. Why indeed? Certainly, it’s better to kill your enemy from a distance where they can’t reach you.”

He began pacing slowly, his tone even. “Cold weapons—swords, spears—yes, they are used because they are part of our culture. But there is a more *practical* reason for learning them, as I’ll now demonstrate.”

He reached for a small device clipped to his belt and pressed a button. A faint shimmer flickered around his body before vanishing completely. “If you would, Mr. Shadeland?”

Cory, who had been silently observing from a distance, gave a small nod. In one smooth motion—faster than I thought possible—he drew a compact blaster and fired *three* rapid shots.

Kalydia and I both yelped, ducking instinctively, fear crashing through my chest as I braced for impact.

But Stewart didn’t move.

The blaster bolts sizzled—then dissipated harmlessly against some invisible barrier surrounding him. “Not to worry,” Stewart said calmly, as though we hadn’t just watched him get shot. “I’m perfectly alright.”

“That wasn’t funny!” I shouted, wrapping my tail protectively around Kalydia’s leg. She was trembling, wide-eyed, but after a moment, she flicked her ear in a quiet affirmation—she was okay.

Stewart coughed lightly, his expression vaguely sheepish. “Yes… apologies. That came across more theatrically than intended. I only meant to *demonstrate*.”

“That could’ve been handled better,” John muttered with a sigh, rubbing the bridge of his nose. “But what’s done is done.”

Cory, ever unbothered, simply shrugged and gave his blaster a smooth, almost showy twirl before holstering it with practiced ease.

Kalydia looked over to Stewart, still wide-eyed but steadier now. “T-that was a… shield, wasn’t it? Like the ones on ships?”

“Correct,” Stewart replied, seamlessly slipping back into his instructor’s cadence. “The technology for personal shields was developed using the framework of early Federation vessel shielding. Once our ancestors took the time to study the original ships, they reverse-engineered the system, refining it over generations until it could be scaled down for individual use.”

He paced slightly, hands clasped behind his back. “These shields are primarily calibrated to absorb or deflect *high-velocity* and *energy-based* attacks. Blasters, plasma rifles, kinetic guns—all can be resisted to some degree. But Melee strikes?” He held up a hand. “Those pass through the field completely, untouched.”

Kalydia’s ears tilted forward, fascinated.

“You *also* can’t fire a gun while your own shield is active,” Stewart added with a small shrug. “Unfortunately, the field reacts to outbound projectiles the same as inbound ones. We’ve yet to overcome that particular limitation.”

I caught Kalydia mouthing the word *wow* under her breath.

Stewart’s expression grew more serious. “Shields, however, are not infallible. They can be overwhelmed. Too many hits in a short period—especially from kinetic impacts—can cause the generator to overload and fail.”

He turned to face both of us again.

“Keep that in mind. Never assume you’re untouchable, no matter how advanced your tech is. Overconfidence is the fastest way to get yourself killed.”

Kalydia and I nodded in unison. It all made sense—and it only reinforced my growing belief that the Ascendancy was a force to be reckoned with.

To my knowledge, the Federation didn’t have *anything* like these personal shields. Not even close. The implications were staggering.

Once the Ascendancy ever went to war on a galactic scale… It wouldn’t just *change* the battlefield, It would *redefine* it.

“You’re underselling what’s special about our weapons,” Vernon said, stepping forward with a slight huff, his tone warm but pointed. “To call them simple ‘melee weapons’ is like calling Echo memory a *history lesson.*”

He gave a knowing smile. “Factually true, yes. But it doesn’t quite capture the *significance* of it.”

Kalydia blinked and leaned slightly forward, clearly intrigued. And I had to admit… I was, too.

From beneath his robe, Vernon revealed a long, slender scabbard. My breath hitched instinctively—after the blaster, I couldn’t help but brace myself as he unsheathed the weapon.

But this time, he made no sudden moves. No sparks. No flashes. Just the quiet *whisper* of metal sliding free.

The blade shimmered faintly with a pale blue sheen as he held it before him.

“I’ve never been much of a warrior,” Vernon said softly. “And my fighting days are far behind me… but I know a thing or two about the weapons we wield.”

Despite the frailty of his frame, he lifted the blade with fluid grace—and slashed the air with startling speed and precision. The cut was clean. Effortless. Like the motion came from memory, not muscle.

“As you both learned the other day,” he continued, “memory is power. And that power can be imbued in more ways than one.”

He took a breath, slow and steady. Then—

His eyes began to glow with a faint blue light, and to our astonishment, the blade followed. That same blue hue shimmered across the sword’s edge, brighter, sharper, alive.

Then Vernon moved. He was a flurry of motion, each kata flowing into the next like poetry given form. I couldn’t look away. His body moved with such precision it felt less like combat and more like a sacred ritual—graceful, deliberate, devastating.

And then, at the peak of his display, he was suddenly in front of one of the armored training dummies.

Except—

There were two of him.

For a split second, it looked as though he had *split*, as if the air itself couldn’t decide where he was.

Then, in one clean, decisive motion, his blade passed through the dummy like it was *nothing*. Not metal. Not even flesh.

Just space.

The dummy fell to pieces before I even realized what had happened.

Vernon stood there, panting hard, leaning heavily on the last remaining upright section. Sweat beaded at his brow.

Cory was already at his side in an instant, steadying him with practiced care.

“Whew…” Vernon chuckled weakly, wiping his forehead. “Overdid it a little.”

“You alright?” Stewart asked, brow furrowed with concern as he stepped closer.

Vernon waved him off, still catching his breath.

“Just need a breather,” he said with a chuckle. “I may be a hundred and eight, but it'll take more than that to put me in the ground.”

Then he turned to us with a gleam in his eye. “So… how was that for a demonstration?”

Kalydia and I could only *stare*, still reeling from what we’d witnessed.

“That was *insane!*” I blurted, excitement bubbling up in my chest. “You cut through that thing like it wasn’t even *there!*”

“It was… oddly beautiful,” Kalydia added, her voice soft with awe. “Your movement was almost… I don’t know… like a work of art?”

I nodded vigorously in agreement.

Vernon chuckled, clearly pleased. “Why thank you,” he said, re-sheathing the glowing blade with care. “As I mentioned earlier, our weapons are not simply crude hunks of sharpened metal. They're so much more.”

He lifted the sword again, the blue glow now faint but still present.

“Through specialized forging techniques—first developed in the Asian regions of Earth and later refined across the system—we’ve learned how to create these blades. What we call *Echo-brands.* Weapons imbued with memory. With *Echo.*”

“They're forged to resonate with their wielder,” he continued, “so deeply that they become an extension of the body and mind. A good Echo-brand doesn’t just respond to you—it *remembers* you.”

Kalydia leaned forward, visibly intrigued.

“Each blade develops its own character, its own quirks,” Vernon went on. “Some even exhibit unique properties in combat. Mine, for instance—” he held the sword aloft again “—is *Whisper Wind*. She’s been with me for over seventy years.”

He gave the sword a fond smile.

“Her gift is illusion—tricks of the eye, displacement, misdirection. What you saw just now? That was her at work. But it’s an exhausting technique, and best saved as an ace up your sleeve.”

I nodded, unable to hide the awe in my eyes.

“Will we be getting one of these… Echo-Brands?”

“Eventually,” John replied, hands clasped behind his back, “Almost everyone has one. Though personally, I’ve never been too keen on carrying a weapon. If it came down to a fight, I’d rather rely on martial arts.”

Stewart exhaled softly through his nose—clearly not for the first time—but said nothing in reply.

Instead, he turned to us, posture straightening, tone sharpening. “Now that you’ve seen what a blade is *capable* of, I trust that’ll serve as motivation.”

His eyes narrowed slightly. “From the top. Form Two—*Vetta!*”

Kalydia and I moved at once, falling into stance. Our bodies were aching, our muscles sore—but our spirits burned with renewed determination.

Together, we trained until our limbs trembled, and the courtyard echoed with the rhythm of our blades.",23,1744470983.0,NatureofPredators,1,1.0,False

I don’t play sports and I don’t enjoy going to bars or parties so it’s really hard to meet new people outside of work.

I don’t mind your gender or location, everywhere in the world is welcomed, but I’d like to find people close to my age (+-5). I am happily in a relationship, and looking for platonic friends only. Long calls on discord, sharing youtube videos, gaming together or ranting about the strange world we live in, all that good stuff.

I’m 30F currently living in the US west coast. I like science, art, and a nice long walk on a good day. Despite where I live I’m far from outdoorsy or sporty, more of a cafe, restaurant and friday night on my big couch with blanket kind of person. I’ve lived in several different countries and always curious to learn about other people’s stories.

I’m generally a chill and friendly person. I wouldn’t describe myself as super introvert but I do enjoy alone time at home a bit too much and dislike loud party or huge crowds. I like a little bit of nature, nice beaches or short hikes, but for most of my free time I’m at home watching shows, gaming or occasionally doing something like painting or baking. 

Common hobbies I enjoy as well as many other people (I’ll leave the specifics to private conversations): 
- Movies, tv shows, comedies
- Music, both listening and playing
- Food, coffee, and a nice cup of tea
- Video games, but not competitively
- Books and podcasts 
- Crafty things

Some less common things about me: 
- I travel quite a lot, and I’ve lived in a couple different places across North America, Europe and Asia. I like different cultures and learning new things.
- Bo Burnham is one of my favorite comedians 
- Daniel Sloss is another one
- I don’t really watch anime except attack on titan is one of the best story I’ve ever seen
- I just finished severance and it’s a good show
- Also just finished Project Hail Mary and I really like it
- I don’t follow any sports. Either you are the same or you have to accept I have very little interest and know nothing about it

Potentially controversial:
Here’s things that I really don’t vibe with and I want to put it out there first. You can disagree and that’s okay, it just means I’m not the friend you’re looking for.
- Smoking, vaping, and recreational drugs
- People with messy life or go for excessive drinking when bored
- People who believe in tarot cards, astrology or psychic stuff
- Deeply religious 
Other than the above I generally cool with anything, we can hard disagree on whether it’s legal to put pineapple on a pizza and still be best friends.

If that interests you send me a message! I don’t expect a whole article about you but please at least tell me a little bit about you. Hope to hear from you!",1,1744470936.0,r4r,1,0.67,False

My responses for him. 
1Look, what happened at first I was upset, but the more I thought about it, the more it just left a bad feeling inside me. I chose not to come at you with anger because I care about you and I wanted to understand where you were coming from. I waited for you to explain and I listened.

But the way the story shifted from saying you didn’t know he’d kiss you to saying you kind of expected it to saying it was to help him figure something out, it all felt shaky. Maybe it was just messy, maybe it wasn’t thought through. Still, it didn’t feel small to me. It hit different, especially considering how much we’ve talked about honesty and protecting what we have.

You said you won’t speak to him again and I’m trusting you to hold to that. I’m not perfect but I keep my word and I expect the same from you. Our word is really the only thing that lasts, especially when everything else gets tested. I’m still here and I still feel something strong between us. I just hope we never end up back in a situation like this again.

2 What you did, I’ll be real, at first I was just angry. But the more I sat with it, the more disgusted I became. I didn’t come at you with rage because I know how that can spiral but don’t mistake that for indifference. I waited to see what you’d say, to hear your truth, but even that felt twisted.

You went from saying you didn’t know he’d kiss you to admitting you kind of expected it to justifying it as a way to help him figure out his feelings. That sounds like a string of excuses, not honesty. It may seem like a small moment to you but to me it’s a hit to the trust I put in you. And trust is the foundation of everything between us.

You said you won’t speak to him again and I’m holding you to that. This isn’t about being possessive, it’s about respect. I’ve always stood by my word and I expect the same from you. Our word is all we really have when everything else falls away. If this really was a one-time slip, then prove it. Don’t ever make me question your loyalty again.

I care about you but don’t make me regret that.

3 Look, what you did it upset me at first, but the more I sat with it, the more disgusted I became. I could have reacted with anger, and maybe part of me wanted to, but I chose not to because that would’ve only made things worse. I waited to hear from you, to give you space to explain. And while I appreciate the honesty, I’m left wondering how much of what you said was real, and how much was a carefully told version of the truth?

You said at first you didn’t expect the kiss, then later admitted you had an idea it might happen. Then you said it was to “help him see” if something was there. That logic doesn’t sit right with me. It might seem like a simple thing to you, but it didn’t feel small on my end. It cut into something I thought we were building with trust and care.

Now, you did agree not to talk to him anymore, and I expect you to keep that promise. I’m not holding this over your head, but I am watching what happens next. Because at the end of the day, our word especially when we claim to love someone is everything. If you say this was a one-time mistake, then I’ll give it that weight, and I’ll move forward with you. But next time, don’t let me find out in pieces. Tell me, just as I promised I would if the roles were reversed.

We’re building something real. I still believe in it but belief needs action to survive. I hope you understand that.

1jxjc9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1jxjc9y/i_had_sexual_relations_with_my_uncle_for_16_years/,I had sexual relations with my uncle for 16 years.,"I never thought the first and only man I’ve ever been touched by or involved with would be my uncle. 

So for context I am from sort of an underdeveloped country (South Asia). I grew up in a very loving family as I was the youngest of three daughters. As it is common in the culture, our family was very prejudiced and I was often favored due to being conventionally good looking. All my life since I was young I got complimented and hit on by friends and strangers and people in my family and extended family always admired my looks compared to my sisters. 

I was about 13 years old when my aunt got married (my dad’s first cousin). She was a very beautiful woman as well but was married to a dark skin but very handsome man. People were divided as many thought they weren’t a good match since he is dark skin but many agreed that he was a fit and handsome man as he had military background too. When they first got married my new uncle was very nice and affectionate towards us sisters, particularly me. Whenever they visited he took a particular interest in me and often would come and talk to me and tell me stories about his mission trips overseas. Soon enough my aunt was expecting a baby. 

We had a normal relationship at first but one time he was hugging me and my sisters after seeing us after a long time and slightly pecked my lips. I thought maybe our parents have shown us affection like that in the past so maybe it is normal but he didn’t do that to any of my sisters considering they were older. My oldest sister was already 18 at that time. 

A few years later when I was about 16 we visited them in a different town he was relocated to due to his military position. We stayed at their house which was a very nice house in a nice secured area. I already went through puberty and was more grown and I guess more attractive. But I’ve noticed he changed his behavior towards me a lot. Maybe he was attracted to me. I also in some ways thought that he was a very attractive man (I always liked dark skinned men as my first crush was dark skin as well). I don’t think I had any sexual feelings towards him yet.

One day during that trip. He offered to show me around his base and show me a helicopter. My older two siblings were fighting so they ended up not going. My aunt told my uncle to show me around and so he took me. We went walking and he showed me the beautiful area and we talked laughed and giggled. He then asked me some personal questions about boys or if I have someone in my life which I didn’t. We were hanging by a pool at that time so he leaned by the fences and said why I’m single considering how attractive I look and he kept saying I’m very hot and attractive. He then came in for a hug and I hugged him back. As I was on his chest he slowly held my face and leaned in for a kiss. I moved my face thinking maybe he will kiss my cheeks but he tilted my face back to him and kissed my lips. In a mili second the kiss went from a peck to something very intense. There was some kind of spark of adrenaline that I kind of gave it in too. We were all of a sudden kissing passionately. I felt his wet lips and tongue in my mouth and I gave it in as well. I was very confused but a man was holding me for the first time in that manner and was deep in my mouth. I slowly moved my hands around his neck and back and we finished our sort of long very sexual kiss. He smiled and said I was beautiful. We kept walking and I was very confused as he was my uncle so I didn’t say much. He turned normal as we were closer to the house and went back. I kept it to myself for the rest of the day and we pretended like nothing happened but I felt like some sort of attraction towards him. 

The next morning when the phone rang in the bedroom me and my sisters were sleeping in, I heard a creek on the door and it was him walking into the room to pick up the cordless phone and leave. He was fully shirtless and in shorts and I just couldn’t stop but stare at him. He was dark which I already mentioned and he was hairy, quite hairy. His chest was just rugged in hair down to the stomach as well, which I couldn’t take my eyes off of. I guess I like men who are hairy so I was full blown attracted to him by this point. I thought that wow this hairy man really had his mouth in my mouth this way and was over the moon. I didn’t look at him like an uncle ever since. It ran through my mind that I was only 16 at that time and he was in his early thirties but I was fully visualizing sex and what not with him. 

Since then often times they would visit our town, mostly just my aunt with their kids (they had a few more) and I would babysit my little cousins and often thought how insane that I made out with their dad. The thought of how my uncle had performed sex with my aunt to produce them also went through my mind. I was very loving to them when I took care of them. I saw him less but whenever did it was on family occasions so it was normal which I’m sure he wanted to find a moment to do something with me but he couldn’t. 

About when I was 18, I got accepted to a notable University in Sydney, Australia. My parents were sending me there so I bid all my family including him goodbye and moved to Australia. In between both in my country and in Australia I had boyfriends or sort of boyfriends but I never allowed them to have sex with me. I was still a virgin waiting for marriage and my boyfriend at that time was understanding of that since he also came from a conservative family. Within 6 months of moving there I heard from my parents that my uncle was coming to Australia for a some air force training and will be here for 8-9 months. I didn’t think much of it as I really liked my boyfriend. But when I received a call from him saying that he is in Sydney and would love to see me as my parents also had sent many presents for me. I agreed to meet him and he visited my apartment. The minute I saw him, he did gain a few pounds from maybe the time we kissed but he was still the most attractive man to me. He initiated a very tight hug and was sort of touchy throughout. We sat down had coffee and chit chatted like friends. I told him I had a boyfriend and he was happy to hear but I don’t know if he really was. He showed me photos of his military trainings and family and a trip to Malaysia where there were many photos of him shirtless. The hairy rugged man he is I just couldn’t stop but stare at it. He also asked if I could show him around Sydney so I agreed to show him Bondi beach. I purposely picked that so I could maybe see him take his shirt off once. He insisted that if I go I must wear a bikini there and I agreed. At this point I saw in his eyes that he just wanted to do all kinds of sexual things to me but I stayed composed. 

The next day we went to Bondi beach. Never thought I’d wear a bikini in front of anyone in my family but I wore a laced one which was quite slutty. He couldn’t stop looking at me and was taking every chance to touch me. As I saw him Take his shirt off I knew I got what I wanted. His hairy chest and even armpits I couldn’t stop looking at. He did gain a few pounds since I last saw him shirtless but equally attractive. We played in the water and at one point I was in his arms in the water wrapping my legs around him and I felt his bulge. He hugged me and even gave me a very short kiss in the lips. We tried not giving into it and not speak a word about that then we walked like nothing happened which was even more arousing for me. I offered he could come to my apartment to shower. 
 
At home he showered and I showered separately. He then said how he couldn’t stop thinking about that day we kissed and I said me too. He was in his towels still and he mentions he knows I fancy him and he fancies me too. I said we are uncle and niece and we shouldn’t do anything more. He then holds me and I slowly kissed his lips once and moved away. He then proceeded on saying that if we touch each other like that it’s clear we don’t even look at each other like family should. He then hugged me behind my back and said the 9 months he is in Australia we should live as husband and wives. I was shocked but had an adrenaline rush on me and I said yes. At that moment he kissed me passionately and took me to bed. I was shocked to see how impressive his size was and we went onto having a very passionate sex even though it hurt like crazy as I was a virgin. He started gentle then proceeded to go rough. We didn’t even think of using protection and that night we went several rounds without protection. 

The next two days we both were off so we didn’t leave our apartment once. I don’t know how many rounds and how many we ways we went but all I remember was him inside me and we were all around our bed couch shower and even kitchen naked and all over each other. We both got calls from our family and spoke separately without mentioning a thing. Upon being asked I said how he dropped off the gifts and I saw him for 10 minutes only. I told my boyfriend I wasn’t feeling good so he didn’t come over. I slowly stopped taking his calls.

Since Monday as the week started, he only lived a 10 min train ride from me so every day when he was released at 5 he would come to my house and we would lock our doors and do all kinds of sexual stuff till 9 when he would go home. Then I would proceed to study and what not. I was on birth control so we often did it unprotected. I just couldn’t get enough of him as being held underneath him feeling his chest hair all over my breast and stomach and him penetrating me was the best feeling. We told each other how we loved each other and were fully a couple now. I was 19 at that time and he was 35 or 36. I kept my relationship going with my boyfriend but was very distance and he felt weird but was afraid to lose me so he wasn’t saying much. I got hit on often my men for my looks but I was head over heels in love with my uncle.

Over the months I got pregnant twice. One of my friends helped me get both aborted thinking it was my boyfriends. My boyfriend and I often fought and he ended up dumping me which I didn’t care as I was living my dream. I knew the minute I go home my uncle comes and we will do all kinds of nasty things to each other. I called him by his name by now or “baby” and we were basically dating. When I finally told him I was pregnant again for the third time, he insisted we keep the baby. I was mortified as he was married to my aunt and I even babysat his children. I was scared of how my family would shame me but he insisted we don’t tell anyone yet. I then agreed to keep it and later confessed to my sister when she called me to tell me she was getting married. She called me a whore and all sorts of names and passed the phone to my parents. That was it, my parents disowned me and said not to call ever unless I was ready to fix this and I told them I wasn’t since I wanted him so they said to never call him. I later heard my aunt called me all sorts of names when she heard and was devastated. I was now working a full time job to pay the rest of my tuition as they stopped sending money and my uncle comforted me but he had to go back as his training ended and he promised to make it right. Upon going back my dad apparently tried to attack him and my aunt sent him divorce papers. There 7 year marriage was at an end. People shamed him showing him a photo of 13 year old photo of me sitting between them on their wedding day and asked how I could get this girl pregnant. He stayed firm on his decision. 

He had good contact for his military so he managed to get a 3 year contract to run trainings in Australia so he flew back and we reunited this time as lovers. I didn’t introduce him to my friends as my uncle but more like my boyfriend and they were initially surprised to see our age gap but were happy for me. I gave birth to my daughter a few months later and we got a nice place to stay and we got married. Since he abruptly left our country before divorced finalized so technically he was still married to my aunt as well. We continued to live like husband and wife and shared immense love. We got married religiously but couldn’t marry legally as he was still legally married. We made love like two happy bunnies and soon enough I was expecting my second. After 3 years of working in the base he managed to get a job at a military airplane assembling company and got permanent residency. I graduated and got a job in a bank and got the same, we purchased a small home and lived very happily. Our parents never wanted to contact us even after the baby. He later wrote me an email saying how I let this man groom me. One minute he was smoking cigarettes with him like brothers next thing he knocks his daughter pregnant. I said I was happy and emailed him back how I loved him. Little did I know it was his kink and he was already screwing a teen intern in his office. 

Over the years we both made good money and I had three more children so me and my husband lived in a house in the suburbs with our 5 children. I was 28 now and he was 44. For context all our children came out fine as we weren’t related by blood but through marriage. He had contacts with his 3 children back home who were growing up to become confused teenagers. We travelled around Australia and even visited Europe, the United States and Bali. I first caught him cheating is by reading a text message between him and the intern and we fought. I realized this was my karma as I broke my own aunts marriage so I let it go soon enough when he promised me on my feet that he wouldn’t repeat it. We had another few good years of marriage and when I had my 6th child I decided either I was tying my tubes or he was getting a vasectomy. He disagree so I got a procedure done so I would stop getting pregnant. He had a very high sex drive all through out the years since I’ve practically met him. He couldn’t sleep without having sex with me. In a way I also felt trapped but I loved him so much I thought maybe this is what marriage is. 

On my 34th birthday he invited some of my friends to a surprise birthday party. My best friend who was there during my wedding now brings in his 17 year old sister who for the record was one year old when me and him first kissed and 4 years old when we first started dating. My husband was very nice and friendly to her which didn’t sit right with me as I remembered how he was with me when I was 13-14 and he was already 30. My now 50 year old husband whom I loved but wasn’t the same man I met. He gained quite the weight and had a big stomach, grey hair and obviously aged. So i thought nothing of it after. But soon enough I got a phone call, from my sister stating my mother was in death bed with cancer and wanted to see me once. I decided to take my youngest two with me and bought tickets to back home. I asked my husband if he was going to be alright and he said he will so I left for home. I came home after 14 years and it felt emotional. The whole family was cold and didn’t speak to me but my old parents were sobbing and embraced me. I sat with them alone told them about what a beautiful life we made and they said they couldn’t accept it but were happy to see me have such a beautiful family. My aunt was in a different town so she and her kids refused to meet me which I was fine with. After my mother died and attended his funeral and then I had to fly back to Sydney. When I came back home. My friend was angry and ready to kill my husband. She told me my husband has been sleeping with her 17 year old sister and she was pregnant. My whole life just dropped below me. The same thing he did to my aunt he just did to me. The same thing he did to me he just did to the little girl. So he is basically a pervert who likes grooming attractive looking younger girls. I couldn’t stop crying and I hit my husband as he tried to beg for forgiveness. I said I can’t believe it as he has been a pervert his whole life and I took that as love. I was 13 when he first touched me inappropriately and then only 16 when he first kissed me. He impregnated me when I was 18. This was his thing.

The next bomb that dropped on me shattered me even more. My 15 year old daughter confessed to me that she and her dad have been having sexual relationships as well. He basically had sex with his own BIOLOGICAL daughter. She was very confused and very attracted to him and wanted to stay with him. I immediately reported him to the police and he was arrested. Over the months he was charged with grooming underage girls and many more which I can’t recall. My daughter was furious with me as she said she and her dad were in love. I was shattered and went to therapy with all my children and immediately decided to move back. I told my sister everything and as they said they saw it coming they felt sympathetic so they told me to come back. I cut all contact with my husband and his family in my country tried reaching out to me as they wanted to see their grandchildren. I met my mother in law for the first time since we got married and she berated me for getting him arrested. She said that it was my fault as i was 13 during his wedding and still slept with him while he was married to my aunt. My cousins/stepkids who I once babysat slutshamed me too. I came home and blocked them all as I knew they were right. I am a slut for letting my uncle kiss me sexually and for fantasizing him and purposely taking him to a beach to show him my body and also see his. Also for agreeing to start and sexual relationship and ruin my aunts marriage and tear down our whole family.  But I was a young girl with love and desire and didn’t have the emotional maturity to realize how messed up my actions were.

Therapy isn’t as common in our country. But I moved to a more secluded neighborhood and now am raising my children who are just confused but I’m being there for them every step of the way. I brought them to this world in the most messed up way and I am paying for my actions. My daughter went back to Australia when my husband was released and they lived together despite me begging her not to do that mistake and even told her where my actions landed me and that’s her biological dad. I know they don’t live like father and daughter. Just like how we didn’t. He emailed me saying he was sorry for his actions but I went off on him on the email explaining everything I was feeling. I can never undo what I did, but I have submitted myself to God and changed my lifestyle and praying for forgiveness.
 
Both my sisters are married and have husbands younger than my husband. Both has one child each. They told me what I did was embarrassing but I also didn’t have to pop out 6 children from this man and I told them my kids are my blessing even though I shouldn’t have had them and put them through this. Later they told me that when we confessed about our relationship my aunt was devastated and told us how he had a cheating problem as he slept with other officers wives and daughters too. My husband did tell me about a few encounters when we first got married and had a long nights talk where he shared his past with me. I was just stupid from the beginning by not clocking it as a red flag.

I contacted my husband and threatened him that if he continues grooming my daughter I will send him to jail. His response was that she is now an adult and should make her own decision. I denounced my citizenship so I can not go back to Australia right now. Only praying to god to stop this nonsense.

1jxj9tr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jxj9tr,"Switch Lite water corrosion, could this be preventing the display showing?","This Switch Lite had coffee spilled on it, and as far as I can tell it was left to sit for months.

It powers up, and you can use it as normal with the controllers and touch screen, and it plays sounds but there is no display.

I believe the flex connector in the photos is responsible for the backlight(?), and it has signs of corrosion, so I'm guessing this is the cause of the problem. I have swapped the board into another Switch Lite to rule out any of the other components or flex cables that connect to the board, i.e. screen, joycon, cartridge slot etc. and the same issue persists.

I've tried my best to get good photos, but my microscope isn't great. You can see one of the pins has corrosion and is darkened. As far as I can tell, it's still where it should be and doesn't seem broken in any way, just corroded. I have tried cleaning it with IPA 99.9% using a toothbrush, but this is apparently as good as it's going to get.

Could this be the issue for the screen not displaying, if this pin isn't reading the contact on the flex cable correctly? If so, is there anything I can do to try and clean or fix it?

I'm not very experienced in SMD/soldering but I can get by, is it possible to swap this connector with one from another board without melting it, as it's all plastic?

He only had one note to play this entire season, which was treacly-sweet and amiable, especially toward Misty. I have seen a lot of hate for this handling of Walter this season. However, I view it with the same genius as the 4 minute one note solo Stereolab put at the end of Lo Boob Oscillator. 

Now that the story the writers needed to tell for Van, Lottie, and to move the teen timeline forward, Season 4 will refocus on whatever Walter's deal with the Yellowjackets is. 

It is possible that there is something really wrong with Walter, like, serial-killer wrong. He was overjoyed in S2 to find someone like him and tells Misty as much. 

Misty getting rid of the plaque on Caligula's cage was the final rejection that Walter could not tolerate. Misty telling him to his face was just foreplay and banter. Think of Pepe Le Pew chasing the cat with the White stripe on her back. However, that plaque had a bug in it. This is how Walter knew Misty's next move all the time and was able to keep track of her and stalk her to his liking.

He is also listening to Slayer's ""Raining Blood."" Traditionally a heavy, double-kickdrum masterpiece of rage incarnated into sound.

So we clearly have a lot to worry about now that Shauna is off the chain, but I suspect Walter of being the ""big bad"" of S4. Allowing  a common enemy for the team to come together once again.

This might sound random but I just wanted to put it out there.

I’m 21. Never dated. Not even close honestly.
It’s not like no one ever showed interest… some did. But I never felt that spark. Never felt like “yes, this is it...
And now, I don’t know...
Life feels a little slow. A little empty.

I’m not in college. Not doing coaching either.
My day looks like: gym, cooking, reading, coffee — and then back to just… being with myself.
No parties, no wild friend group, no “how I met her” kinda story.
Just me...and my stuff for my future 

And don’t get me wrong, I actually like my space.
But lately, there’s this strange feeling I can’t shake off.
Like there’s a void inside me — not loud, but constant.
It’s not about being in a relationship just for the tag or attention.
It’s more like… I want someone I can talk to.
Someone I can really be myself with.
Talk about small things, laugh, be weird, send random texts. Someone who just gets it...maybe..

Also, I’m working on a small startup thing on the side — nothing big, but it keeps me going. Just thought I’d share that too...
I’m not expecting anything from this post.
Not trying to act cool or deep.
Just felt like dropping this here. Maybe someone reads it and relates.
Maybe you’re feeling the same way too.

And finally, I find it a bit weird that the transparent plastic that's under the pod holder is always a bit dirty and brown, which I'm also not sure if it should look that way. I've already rinsed it, used the descaling kit but these things keep happening. ",1,1744469042.0,nespresso,3,1.0,False

It did something weird to my immune system. I’ve realised recently that it’s likely due to histamine intolerance, I have some questions.

1 - do you have to react to ALL high histamine foods? For example, chocolate is BAD for me, probably the worst one (I’m an addict too :( ) but coffee I only have a small reaction, and matcha no reaction at all.

2 - which list is the best to go off of to start an elimination diet? Some foods they all share in common, but I’ve seen almonds on some and not on others, olives on some and not on others, etc. 

3 - is it possible to experience histamine intolerance with ONLY skin reactions? I do have indigestion and TMI but the past couple of months since the rash came back with a vengeance bad smelling flatulence which is abnormal for me. 

It’s worth noting that I also have lipoedema, which is highly comorbid with MCAS. I also realise that the periods of fainting that occurred as a teenager with seemingly no explanation were likely POTS, it was always when I stood up from seated. ",1,1744468988.0,HistamineIntolerance,1,1.0,False

It’s such a terrible place to be. Having to walk away from someone you still love does something to you. I know it was the right thing to do, but I thought I’d be feeling a little better by now. It’s been two months, and honestly, I feel worse than ever.

What makes it even harder is feeling like my husband took everything from me—including my freedom. I’m a stay-at-home mom, and I would’ve been back to work weeks ago, but he made sure I couldn’t use the car. I’ve tried everything to find remote work, but I haven’t had any luck. So I’m stuck—physically, emotionally, financially.

I’m staying at my parents’ house, and while I’m incredibly thankful they took us in and have been providing for us, I’m here all day, every day, from morning to night. I don’t have a car to get out of the house—even just to take my daughter to the park or walk around the mall. I have no money at all—not even enough to take her on a little coffee and cookie date, grab a simple lunch, or buy her an Easter basket. That part breaks me the most. 

I left him, and now it feels like he’s punishing me—and our daughter too—without even realizing it. He drained and closed our joint account, and I’ve had nothing since. All I’m left with are bad memories, painful what-ifs, and the constant day-to-day torture of living at my parents’ house, feeling like I’m a burden they don’t really want there—but having no other choice.

Meanwhile, he’s out on weekends—gambling, going to sports games, dating—while my daughter and I are stuck in a living room together, doing our best with what we have. I’m just really struggling this week and needed to vent. I want my freedom back. I’d love to be able to get my mind off things, but it’s hard when I have nothing to do and no way to distract myself. I just feel trapped.

Has anyone else been in a situation like this? How did you get through it? Any suggestions or words of encouragement would really mean a lot right now.

I would often go out for one on one coffees or meals with Koreans, roughly 50 of them by my count, and was frequently struck by the extent to which they did not reciprocate by returning questions to me that I had asked them like 'What do you enjoy most about your job?' or 'What are your hobbies?'.  Back in those days, I could not find any good explanations for this.  On the other hand, I did find a really interesting analysis by a Korean academic and the language (in Korean - I always texted in Korean) that is used when turning down invitations to events, which I found extremely jarring at first (e.g. they would not state whether the invitation was of interest to them or not, even in cases where I knew it was, nor would they propose an alternative like, 'I know of something interesting next week instead').  I learned not to take it personally when I read this article, because it is ubiquitous.

Context may be important: I am male and confess that the majority of these conversational partners were female, with a variety of age ranges (it is now to late for me to try to analyze what age may have had to with it).  It shouldn't be a sheepish confession though, because my academic background is in fields much more frequently pursued by women.

If you're still wondering why I'm asking 10 years later: this is a maladaptive behavior I picked up.  What I mean is, in the US, I will still try to befriend people who are not reciprocating my questions, even though this no longer makes any sense (yet, I almost felt like this was something I had to do to survive in Korea).  I am currently trying to better understand lack of reciprocity from both cultural and psychological standpoints, so I really started wondering about my Korea experiences again.

I visited Picacho Coffee Roasters (Nice spot, by the way!) in NM about few weeks ago and left with a bag of Jairo Arcila Honey Peach Co-Ferment. I cracked open the bag yesterday and brewed a cup on v60. It’s all out peach candy - like a peach jolly rancher or peach fruit cup. I’ve never had a coffee so forward in flavor and I’m pleasantly surprised.  I highly recommend this coffee from Picacho. Looks like they also have a blackberry co-ferment along with other solid beans in their current rotation.

1jxip17,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Midnight_Metanoia/comments/1jxip17/more_than_attached_less_than_certain/,"More Than Attached, Less Than Certain","I went out recently with a friend—just a simple catch-up over coffee. One of those nights where you talk about everything and nothing: life, the world, random thoughts. It was fun, even comforting in its simplicity. But then, as always, my friend—who’s as tactless as she is honest—had to say something that caught me off guard.

“You keep on talking about that guy,” she said, casually sipping her drink. “Maybe you’re not just attached. Maybe you’re in love. People in love are like that.”

I laughed it off at first, but her words lingered.

Later that night, as I walked under the soft glow of BGC’s streetlights and the happy chaos of neon signs and couples holding hands, something in me went quiet. My thoughts went blank, except for one thing—him. I couldn’t stop thinking about how I feel. Or rather, what it is I’m actually feeling.

Have I really spent that much time in a relationship that was so dull, so emotionally flat, that now—outside of it—I can’t even name what’s happening inside me?

Is this love? Or am I just high on attention and connection after years of emotional monotony?

Am I too old for this kind of uncertainty? Too tired to still be questioning what I feel, where I stand, or what’s next? A part of me wants to shut it all down, stop the overthinking, build walls, and just not feel for a while. But I can’t. My emotions don’t work that way. They always find a way to sneak in, soft and loud all at once.

So maybe the answer is to stop trying to figure it all out. Maybe I just need to be—to live for the moments that bring joy, connection, and butterflies, even if they don’t come with guarantees. Maybe it’s okay to let myself feel, even if it scares me.

And maybe that’s what life is really all about—living for a moment, enjoying what is in the present, and soaking it all in until it becomes just a memory.",1,1744468541.0,u_Midnight_Metanoia,0,1.0,False

Her reasoning was she could see a future with someone else and that wasn’t fair to me. She specified it was an actual person but a figurative one. She could still see a future with me as well. She also said she’s only 80% in and needs to be 100% in. She told me this a month and a half ago and then after a month we took a week break but were still Snapchating everyday often. After that week long break she ended things with the same reasons. The day we broke up we did “it” before I left. Over the last three weeks we’ve been on no contact but I’ve asked to see her twice and those meetings were objectively positive. She even said “if I come back, I’ll come back swinging”. Never once have I begged or asked for her back since that I believe in us and I’m working on myself. I also got diagnosed with a semi serious disease and she was worried about me and asked me to keep her updated. My grandmother also called her (which she never does) and she answered and talked to her for 30 minutes. She lives with her sister and she’s been positive when I go over there, she talks to me like and doesn’t avoid me. I also have been doing things for her without her asking and without expecting a response. I’ve gotten her flowers a few times, brought her favorite homemade meals, gotten her coffee before work, cleaned her car, and gotten her a Bible and highlighted some good Bible verses. I just dropped these things off at her house without talking to her. She has never once told me to stop and has thanked me in person a few times. (I am doing this because I do truly love and I’m a fighter, in the end atleast I tried and it will give me peace)

For some more context on why I’m confused is she didn’t tell her mom for 10 days which is off because she tells her mom everything and they talk daily. Also she hasn’t deleted her social posts and we still share locations. She also has talked to my two sisters in laws and my friend’s fiancés. She also has kept all the notes I gave her and the flowers are still out in her apartment. Lastly I never expected this she has always been 100% in and loyal and was the one begging me for a ring for years.

She said she hasn’t been sleeping well and doesn’t have an appetite. When I see her she looks tired and worn down. She’s been hanging out with a lot of people lately which she didn’t do before. I am 100% sure there’s not another guy and all of this is in her head. She loves me and understands that all the things line up: morals, faith, future, family, friends, connection, friendship, and love.

The worst part is I was planning on proposing this summer which I told her when we broke up (which she couldn’t believe). I am literally her best friend and treated her well. I’ve boiled the reasoning down to 5 things:

Her date cheated on her mom of 25 years a year and a half ago and now lives with that woman and doesn’t talk to her much. This really affected her and I was there for her but she never got a professional help.
2.	⁠She’s always been insecure and said things like I’m not good enough for you. She needs a lot of reassurance.
3.	⁠Our friends are all getting engaged and I haven’t asked her yet but we’ve been dating longer than some of them. I think she started to believe she was never getting a ring.
4.	⁠I dropped the ball, I’m not great at showing affection with words and getting defensive at times.
5.	⁠Last summer I started a break for only 2 days and after we got back together, I explained it was because of all the pressure in my life. Biggest mistake of my life.

Why might this generally happen and what should I do if she seemed super interested in me?

First date (valentines) we went to the aquarium and had a seven hour lunch/dinner then I held her hand and walked her back. We hugged goodbye and she was saying she had a great time with me.

Second date we went to the museum then I brought her back to my apartment (she asked me to watch a movie with her though she was super nervous), we watched a movie together and were super touchy/kissing, though there wasn't time to do anything else because she needed to get the bus back. She orgasmed though (thrusted upward bitting her lip and smiling) and said that I should come over as soon as possible. She left looking super happy.

Third date we viewed some more museums, went to the beach, looked at some churches (city with super old churches), then I went back to her apartment and we watched movies again. She was proposing a lot of future plans with me and starting to copy me a lot, showed me she uninstalled tinder, taking my advice for career things etc. We were touchy and kissing all night though I was too exhausted to have sex. She orgasmed again and enjoyed it and didn't mind that we didn't have sex. She was covered in love bites and there was blood on her bed sheet from fingering but she said it was fine. She left looking super happy with me saying she'd keep her hair long for me, etc.

Fourth date seemed okay though there were some problems in retrospect. She had proposed to go on the date with me for her birthday so she was enthusiastic over text. She had been working/getting through deadlines that week. On the date she seemed super exhausted, still in her sleep clothes and mirroring more than usual. I asked over text if she was tired this week before coming and she said that she was ok because she didn't have new deadlines until next month. But on the date she said she was having nightmares about school and that she was accidentally messing up her exam questions, but I figured it was ok because they were only 10% exams/assignments. Sometimes she'd not answer casual questions and she was more sarcastic than usual, though it was playful and she was still touching me a lot, playing with her hair when talking and staring at me, asking to go back to her apartment instead of the coffee shop (we went to the garden first but she wanted to go back to her apartment maybe because she was exhausted). She seemed more apprehensive to touch at her apartment and asked if we could study at the library first. We studied then she said we should go back. So we went back but I could tell she was really exhausted and had other things happening like yeast infection, hadn't shaved her face or back, felt super sensitive to my stubble and her underwear fabric, cramping, frowning sometimes in pain, etc. She was using her phone more than usual, had received donuts from someone (though im not sure who, but she also had a lot of food that she was sharing with me that she got from her hometown so probably celebrated her birthday with caretakers), and was mirroring new words (she mirrors people a lot), which might've indicated that she was seeing someone else but I doubted it given her schedule and texting. She went to bed early and when we woke up she asked when I'd leave because she needed to get to work. She prompted me to kiss her a bit before then and hugged. She said I could come over next week and that we'd figure out what to do over text. Eventually I release from the kiss and she looks at my blankly as I'm packing my stuff. I say bye then she says bye a few seconds after. Things didn't seem irredemable at first but she hasn't replied to my texts in three weeks.",0,1744468464.0,dating_advice,4,0.5,False

Do you want something ultra-detailed, effortlessly cool, or just downright hilarious? Whether you need a profile pic, a gift, or some artsy wall decor, this list breaks down the four most popular portrait styles so you can find your perfect match.

# 1. Realistic Portraits: Because You’re a Walking Masterpiece

Best for: Wedding photos, family keepsakes, corporate headshots

**Vibe:** Classic, timeless, sophisticated

Cost: $$$ (Good art takes time, my friend)

If you want a portrait that looks like it belongs in an art gallery (or your grandma’s living room), realism is the way to go. Artists focus on every tiny detail, from the sparkle in your eye to the stray eyebrow hair you missed this morning. Think of it as a Photoshop filter but in paint or pencil form.

Fun Fact: 65% of commissioned portraits in the U.S. are realistic. Turns out, people really love seeing themselves in HD!

**Who should get this?**

✔️ You appreciate fine art.

✔️ You want a keepsake that lasts forever.

✔️ You think AI filters just don’t do you justice.

# 2. Sketch Portraits: Minimalist, Yet Mysterious

**Best for:** Gifts, casual decor, personal mementos

**Vibe:** Artsy, laid-back, effortlessly cool

**Cost:** $$ (More affordable, still stunning)

Sketch portraits strip away the extra details and focus on the essence of the subject. They’re simple, elegant, and look like something a mysterious artist might have drawn while sipping coffee in a Parisian café.

**Fun Fact:** 40% of art buyers prefer sketches for their aesthetic and affordability. Basically, you can be fancy on a budget.

**Who should get this?**

✔️ You love minimalist art.

✔️ You want a unique but budget-friendly gift.

✔️ You think black-and-white is a peak aesthetic.

# 3. Vector Portraits: The Cool, Digital Sibling 💻

**Best for:** Social media avatars, business branding, modern home decor

**Vibe:** Clean, bold, futuristic

**Cost:** $$-$$$ (Depends on complexity)

Vector portraits are the superheroes of the digital art world. They’re created with clean lines, bright colors, and a modern edge, perfect for Instagram profile pics, YouTube banners, or branding materials. Plus, they scale infinitely, meaning no pixelation!

**Fun Fact:** 50% of graphic designers prefer vector portraits for their versatility.

**Who should get this?**

✔️ You want a slick, digital-friendly portrait.

✔️ You’re a content creator, influencer, or entrepreneur.

✔️ You love bold colors and modern design.

# 4. Caricature Portraits: Because Life’s Too Short to Be Serious 🤪

**Best for:** Gifts, party favors, fun profile pics

**Vibe:** Playful, exaggerated, hilarious

**Cost:** $-$$ (More affordable and full of personality)

Caricatures turn your best (or weirdest) features up to 100. Got big eyes? They’ll be huge. Strong jawline? Say hello to superhero proportions. These portraits are perfect if you don’t take yourself too seriously and love a good laugh.

**Fun Fact:** Caricatures are the most requested style at 75% of corporate and social events. Apparently, everyone loves seeing themselves as a cartoon!

**Who should get this?**

✔️ You love humor and fun art.

✔️ You need a unique, lighthearted gift.

✔️ You don’t mind seeing yourself with an exaggerated fivehead.

# Final Thoughts: Which One’s Your Perfect Match?

👉 Classic and timeless? Go realistic.

👉 Minimalist and artsy? Try a sketch.

👉 Modern and digital? Vector’s your best bet.

👉 Fun and quirky? Caricatures all the way!

https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/s/gD64O9gMRh


A lot has happened 😭

She got sober.
That’s the first thing. The impossible thing.
She told me she was going to stop drinking, and I didn’t believe her,not really. I mean, I wanted to. But I’d seen her drink like the world owed her something. I’d watched her drown herself in alcohol and I just didn’t believed her because it was almost like a part of her.But the she just stopped.

She started therapy. Like real therapy. Weekly sessions. She told me she hated it. Told me her therapist was annoying,but she kept going. She said it made her feel like she'd been underwater for years, and suddenly someone was opening the windows. That maybe she'd never seen herself clearly (or something like that). She said things like that sometimes were 
Pretty intimate but somehow managed to be distant.

And I tried to stay away. I really did 😭

I started going out again. Reconnecting with my friends. My life looked normal. Like something out of someone else’s routine. There were group photos and cafés and loud dinners, I started going to parties again, and simply going out almost everyday because someone else wasn’t stealing my time.I posted Instagram stories almost every day, like the usual.She never posted anything because she didn’t even knew how to use instagram which I still find stupid.
But she’d reply sometimes. Just emojis. That laughing one, the one with the tears. the kind of “texts” your mom sends when she doesn’t really know how else to talk online. It felt sterile. Empty. Like she didn’t know how to reach me anymore.

BUT THEN,she started calling me a lot.

She’d talk about strange things,how the wind moved past her building at night, how the streetlights flickered,how therapy made her remember things she hadn’t thought about in years. She never said anything sweet. Never affectionate. But she asked. Asked if I’d been sleeping. If I’d been eating. If I was writing. She told me she’d read what I recommended her. That she’d listened to Jeff Buckley and liked him. That part almost made me cry. About how sometimes she’d watch me sleep and think, “fuck, I’ve ruined this too.”
We didn’t talk about us, not directly. But it was there. It always was.

And I didn’t really wanted to but my emotions made me, I knew it wasn’t healthy to get close to her again and I was genuinely trying to forget about her, but the difference was that I simply couldn’t because she was actually insanely important for me no matter how aloof and bitter she was.

Eventually, we started seeing each other again. Not dating. Just lingering. Hours spent in half-spoken conversations. Dinners that turned into long drives. Car rides that ended in silence. She told me about her childhood,sharp fragments. It wasn’t bad, she said. Just distant. Secure but cold. No major trauma and a healthy life.She said she didn’t know why she ended up the way she did. That maybe it was something chemical.That she used to think she'd be dead by thirty. Not because she wanted to die,just because she didn’t care and thought that alcohol killed people a lot earlier than they were supposed to.

Sometimes she’d say things like, “I don’t believe in people,” or “I think I don’t really need company to be fulfilled” and then laugh, like it was just a joke. But it wasn’t.

She was lucid. Focused. But still herself. Still cold and cutting. Still brutally honest in a way that made my chest tighten. But something was quieter in her now. Like the screaming had gone inward.

Okay so then,something very heartbreaking happened, it had been some weeks,everything good.
Then one night, I went to her place. And there was a man there.
A short, unremarkable man. Indifferent by me and just stupid looking. His presence hit me like a slap because I didn’t knew what the actual hell he was doing in there,he wasn’t repairing something and looked way to comfortable to be visiting and so just got weirded out,so I entered and I greeted him and then I reached her and asked her who the hell was that 🥱🥱???

She told me to leave. Said it sharply, like I was interrupting something. I went home and cried for hours,I started making up all the possible scenarios ever and assuming they were true.

Later, she showed up at my door,the normal, but when we were calm and just ready to have a conversation,she looked at me a bit serious and said,“That man’s my husband.” Just like that. Flat tone. No drama. Like she was telling me about an old coworker.

Turns out they’d been married for years but hadn’t lived together in a long time. He was in Georgia. She had moved states away. They hadn’t spoken. They hated each other. Cold war silence. But suddenly, he decided he wanted to “try again,” and showed up at her door with his bags. She said she let him stay because she was “too busy to file the papers.”

She told me this while eating fries in my living room. Like it was just gossip. Like it didn’t matter. Like she wasn’t telling me she’d been sharing space—her space—with a man who used to sleep beside her.

I broke.
No, really. I broke.

I started crying, couldn’t stop. Something primal just took over. I barricaded the door with couch cushions. As if I could trap her there, keep her from leaving, keep her from going back to him. My mind spiraled: I couldn’t survive her,MY WOMAN, being that close to anyone else,I couldn’t imagine it. Couldn’t bear it. She screamed at me. She slapped me.
Called me pathetic.
And that I was crazy.

And I just cried. Silent. Shaking. I couldn’t even speak. She said, “Let me fucking go.” I didn’t. She repeated it, louder this time. Her fists clenched. And all I could do was sob.

I don’t know what came over me. I trowed myself at her and kissed her, I wrapped my arms around her neck while my heels lingered in my feet, I pulled her down gently.
She kissed me back very harshly.
I don’t know if her back was hurting lmao,but she grabbed my shoulders and sat me down on the couch that was impeding her to go.
We ended up on the couch, tangled, desperate, half-mad with pain, she cupped my face and roughly grabbed my hair,she wasn’t entirely on top of me but her weight was crushing me, and not only could I feel her mouth perfectly but also grease because of my lipstick, it felt like all my senses were high.

And I have tried enough things to know what I like and whatnot, there are even a lot more things to explore but I know that THAT kiss was probably one of the best things I ever had in my life.

She bit my lip. I cried out and screamed in high bitch out of Inertia.
When I pulled back, there was blood in my mouth, I don’t know how. She looked down and wiped away the blood with her thumbs,I don’t know if she felt guilty or indifferent but she left.

We didn’t talk for weeks after that.But I was so mad and so so soooo disappointed that I promised myself I wouldn’t talk to her ever again,that if she tried to reach me I would snap at her.And I never mentioned too much about her with my friend groups but I was actually so upset and crazy that I just ranted about it to everyone and they were all mad too. it was childish but I couldn’t react in any other way, I just loosed my mind for some moments.

Until one afternoon,she just showed up at my house.

Didn’t knock. Just walked in (she still had a key). I was by the pool just floating and having coffee. She found me there and said, “What the fuck are you doing?” Like I’d insulted her. “Go get dressed.” I obeyed (I liked it).Her voice made my spine straighten. She was furious,God knows why.

When I came back downstairs, she was leaning against my fridge.
I said nothing. She grabbed my arm and pulled me outside. Took me to her car.

I asked where we were going. She didn’t answer.

We drove in silence. She lit a cigarette. Rolled the window down. Eventually, we reached the beach (we are in Florida so it wasn’t hard work lol). We sat in the sand for hours. Just listening. Watching. Talking.

She told me about that man,her husband,and how he tried to sleep in her bed the first night. She locked herself in the bathroom until morning. Said he cried once. She felt nothing. Said she wanted a beer that night. Just one. Said she held the bottle for an hour and couldn’t open it.
And all the things she told me about her marriage were genuinely cold and I thought about how all of our situation was almost movie-like and how her marriage was so brutally real and unsatisfying, it was a harsh contrast.

She told me she thought about us as teenagers. Wondered how different life would be. She told me about her job. Hated him. Hated how exhausted she always felt. She talked and talked and talked.

AND NOW HERE IS THE CRAZY PART

And then, just like that, while we were laying and I was trying to act all cute and calm even tho I wasn’t, she had paid for numerous coffe’s and I was actually having a great time, giggly and fuzzy—she pulled out a ring.

She just turned around and told me she didn’t want anyone else walking into my house. That she didn’t want anyone else touching me. That she didn’t care if I hated her. That she didn’t care if she didn’t deserve me. That she just wanted me to be hers. Permanently.

She didn’t say “I love you.” She never does. But she said things that meant it. Things I can’t repeat. Things too specific, too real. Things you only say when you mean it and when it’s already too late.

She grabbed my hand and put the ring in my finger, it fitted me perfectly and she knew what I liked, it was heavy,elegant and looked like pure gold, the design was insanely perfect and I loved it. She knew that I loved it.
I couldn’t speak. I WAS GENUINELY SHOCKED,I stared. She waited.

I wanted to say YES, I wanted to tell her how much I worshipped her,loved her,adored her, and the thought of us living together forever was almost like a “the little house on the prairie” episode to me.

But I couldn’t. I couldn’t even breathe and It was sort of stupid to say yes from a logical approach, I tried to think sometime, and yeah it wasn’t a good idea.All I could do was whisper, “I have to think.”

She scoffed. 

“You’ve got to be fucking kidding me.”

“Jesus Christ. Get your shit together. Marry me.” 

She got up. Brushed sand off her knees. Didn’t look at me.

“Look, I get it” she said (it was weird because she wasn’t that comprehensible,not at all). “Think.”

And I didn’t knew what else to do or say,so I got up too.We drove back in silence.

I haven’t given her an answer yet.

I don’t know what I’m supposed to do.

I think about it every day 😔 I don’t want to loose her but marrying her is also insane despite how happy it would made me. Please tell me your opinions and what do you think I should do, if I should keep talking to her or not, what should I say to her???",1,1744467581.0,Advice,5,1.0,False

I’m heading to Goa from April 20th to 26th and wanted to ask for some tips. I’ll be staying in Morjim initially, but not sure if I should stick around that area the whole time or explore other parts of North Goa to stay. I’ll be solo from the 22nd onwards, so looking to make the most of it.

I’m taking the Vande Bharat both ways, so that part’s sorted. Now, for the rest:

Any solid bike rental companies you recommend? Preferably ones that allow pick-up in one spot and drop-off in another?

What are some cool, not-too-touristy places to chill, read, or just vibe out around North Goa? I’m okay with secluded spots too—honestly prefer them over crowded beaches.

I’m skipping South Goa this time—cab prices and travel time are a pain.

Any must-try cafes, beach shacks, flea markets, or events happening that week?

And if anyone here’s from or in during that time Goa and doesn’t mind showing a solo traveler around or grabbing a drink/coffee, that’s a huge bonus.
