Hey MaximizeMe community! üöÄ

Ever find yourself staring at your screen with zero focus, like your brain just took a coffee break without you? Yeah, me too. Last week, my brain felt like a cat chasing a laser pointer on a caffeine overload. So, I decided to try something a bit *unconventional*... nasal breathing!

I know, I know ‚Äì sounds weird, right? But hear me out. I gave nasal breathing a shot for 7 days, and it was a total game-changer for my focus and stress levels. üéØ Here's what happened:

**Day 1:** Felt like a fish trying to swim on land. Seriously, who knew breathing was so complicated? üòÖ I had to remind myself constantly: ""In through the nose, out through the nose.""

**Day 3:** Lightbulb moment! I noticed I wasn't reaching for my phone every five minutes. My mind was less scattered, and I was actually *finishing tasks*. Total win!

**Day 5:** Someone at work told me I looked ""serene."" Normally, I'd say they're nuts, but let's be real‚Äîhow often do we hear that in the chaos of office life? ü§î

**Day 7:** Cortisol levels? Can‚Äôt measure them myself, but I felt so chill I could‚Äôve probably meditated through a tornado. üå™Ô∏è My focus was sharp, and I felt more in control of my reactions.

**Some quick tips if you wanna try it too:**

- **Start small:** Do it for just five minutes whenever you remember. Baby steps, folks!
- **Apps help:** Apps like Headspace can guide you through it if you're new.
- **Stay consistent:** Like that trusty morning coffee, consistency is key.

So, ever tried a quirky life hack that transformed your day-to-day? Maybe gave cold showers a shot? Or tried journaling? Let's swap stories! After all, isn‚Äôt that what we‚Äôre here for‚Äîmaximizing the awesome in our lives, one little tweak at a time? üöÄ",1,1747462426.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

He made these super advanced robots, of course, but its alternate 1980s decade was much more advanced than we were back then, with most advanced technology being implemented unto 'human-interest' products (coffee machines, advanced robots, AI, etc.)  In addition to this, the world then already had ball joints the size of a finger tip. 

What I want to ask is his intelligence in regards to crime.  If he did stuff them into the suits, then he is smart in removing evidence in the most unexpected way.  But even that led to customers witnessing literal blood and mucus leaking out the mascots during performance, leading to its official close shortly after the MCI.  Another way is that he was arrested shortly after the MCI was committed, but he was later acquitted because of lack of evidence, which I assume to have happened in the preliminary hearing.  Whatever evidence they had against him, it was enough to convince police he was the culprit, leading to him being charged but not convicted.  But the evidence must be  shown, without doubt, to be related to the crime.

IMO, he could've just been lucky that he found the right moment.

Then, (if it did) the DCI happened, which I assume happened on different days, and Afton got them all there to kill one day, (but that's my head-canon.)

## What is DominionX?

DominionX is an **automated trading platform** that uses smart algorithms to help users trade cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. Think of it like a co-pilot for your trading journey‚Äîit makes decisions based on market trends, data analysis, and pre-set parameters, so you don‚Äôt have to micro-manage every trade.

What stands out is that it‚Äôs built for **both beginners and experienced traders**. If you're new, you can lean on the automated features. If you're experienced, you can adjust settings to fit your strategy. It‚Äôs kind of like autopilot in a Tesla‚Äîyou can let it drive, or take the wheel when you want.

## Who Created DominionX?

Details about the **team behind DominionX** are a bit limited (which is honestly pretty common for platforms like this), but based on what I‚Äôve found, it seems to be developed by a group of fintech professionals and crypto enthusiasts. They‚Äôve positioned DominionX as a response to the growing demand for **accessible trading tools** that don‚Äôt require advanced knowledge.

While it would be nice to see more transparency here, the platform‚Äôs functionality and user reviews suggest it‚Äôs not just some fly-by-night operation. Think of it similar to platforms like **Bitcoin Era**, where the focus is more on performance than personal branding.

### [üî• Start Trading with DominionX Today](https://da.gd/N1hnRD)
## How Does DominionX Work?

DominionX works by using **AI-driven trading bots** that analyze market data in real time. These bots are designed to identify profitable opportunities based on historical trends, volume spikes, and price movements. Once they spot a good trade, they execute it automatically‚Äîno action needed on your part unless you want to customize things.

The platform connects to global exchanges and pulls in live data to make decisions. You can choose between **manual trading** (for more control) or **automated trading** (for convenience). Everything happens through a clean, browser-based dashboard. It‚Äôs kind of like having a virtual assistant who never sleeps and is obsessed with crypto.

## DominionX Pros and Cons

Here‚Äôs the real talk‚Äîno platform is perfect. But DominionX does a solid job in most areas.

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ **Automated trading** makes it beginner-friendly
- ‚úÖ **Real-time analytics** improve trade accuracy
- ‚úÖ **User-friendly interface** with easy navigation
- ‚úÖ Supports **multiple assets**, not just Bitcoin
- ‚úÖ Offers a **demo account** for practice

**Cons:**

- ‚ùå **Lack of transparency** about founders
- ‚ùå You still need to **monitor risk**‚Äîit‚Äôs not magic money

### [üëâ Open Your DominionX Account Now](https://da.gd/N1hnRD)
## What Devices Can be Used to Access DominionX?

You can access DominionX on pretty much **any device with a browser**:

- **Desktop and laptops** (Windows, macOS)
- **Tablets**
- **Smartphones** (iOS and Android)

There‚Äôs no standalone app yet, but the **mobile web version is optimized** and works smoothly. I tested it on an iPhone and didn‚Äôt run into any lag or layout issues. It feels like managing your trades from a mobile banking app‚Äîclean and functional.

## DominionX ‚Äì Supported Countries

DominionX is available in **most countries**, which is a huge plus. That said, there may be **some regional restrictions** due to local crypto regulations. For example:

- ‚úÖ Supported: USA, UK, Canada, Australia, most of Europe
- ‚ùå Possibly restricted: China, North Korea, and a few Middle Eastern countries

If you‚Äôre unsure, you can check during the signup process. The platform will tell you right away if your region is supported or not.

## DominionX ‚Äì Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

DominionX‚Äôs trading engine constantly scans the market for **price movements, volume changes, and trend shifts**. It‚Äôs like having a Bloomberg terminal running 24/7 but with way less complexity.

### User-Friendly Interface

One of the best things about DominionX is the **clean, intuitive dashboard**. Whether you're a total newbie or a trading veteran, it doesn't take long to get the hang of it. You can switch between demo and live mode easily, adjust strategy settings, and view performance metrics all in one place.

### Mobile Accessibility

Even without a dedicated app, DominionX is **fully responsive on mobile browsers**. You can fund your account, monitor your trades, and even withdraw profits from your phone while waiting in line for coffee.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set up **custom alerts and notifications** for price changes, trade executions, or market news. It helps you stay in control even when the bot is doing most of the work.

### Multiple Asset Trading

DominionX doesn‚Äôt just stick to Bitcoin. You can trade:

- **Ethereum**
- **Litecoin**
- **Ripple**
- **Bitcoin Cash**
- And a few **forex pairs and commodities**

This makes it ideal if you want to **diversify your portfolio** without juggling multiple platforms.

## Is DominionX a Scam?

This is the big question, right? Based on my experience and what I‚Äôve read across multiple forums and review sites, DominionX **does not appear to be a scam**. It delivers on its core promises: automated trading, fast execution, and a user-friendly experience.

But like with any trading platform, there are **risks involved**. The market is volatile, and no algorithm can guarantee profits. DominionX helps you manage trades more efficiently, but it‚Äôs not some magic money machine.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on DominionX?

To get started, you‚Äôll need to deposit a **minimum of $250**. This is pretty standard across platforms like Bitcoin Era and Immediate Edge. You can deposit via:

- **Credit/Debit Cards**

- **E-wallets** (in some regions)

I recommend starting with the minimum if you're new‚Äîjust to get a feel for how it works.

### DominionX Customer Support

Support is available **24/7 via live chat and email**. I reached out with a couple of newbie questions and got a reply within 10 minutes. The agent was polite and gave clear answers. No copy-paste replies, which is always a good sign.

## How do you start trading on DominionX?

Starting is super simple‚Äîit takes less than 10 minutes.

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the DominionX homepage and fill in your name, email, and phone number. No lengthy forms or uploads at this stage.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

You‚Äôll get a call or email from a **partner broker** to verify your info. Once that‚Äôs done, you can fund your account with the $250 minimum.

### Step 3: Start Trading

From here, you can go straight to **demo mode** to test things out, or activate **live trading**. You can also tweak settings like trade size, stop loss, and daily limits.

## How to Delete a DominionX Account?

If you ever want to walk away (hopefully with profits), you can delete your account by:

- Contacting **customer support**
- Requesting a **full account closure**
- Withdrawing any remaining funds first

It usually takes **24-48 hours** to process the deletion.

### [üî• Start Trading with DominionX Today](https://da.gd/N1hnRD)
## The Verdict

DominionX is a solid pick if you‚Äôre looking to **dip your toes into crypto trading** without diving headfirst into technical analysis. It‚Äôs not perfect‚Äîno platform is‚Äîbut it nails the basics: ease of use, automation, and flexibility.

I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs great for:

- **Beginners** who want to learn by doing
- **Busy professionals** who don‚Äôt have time to trade manually
- Anyone looking to **diversify** beyond just Bitcoin

Just remember, always start small, and don‚Äôt invest what you can‚Äôt afford to lose. But if you‚Äôre ready to get started, DominionX could be your new favorite tool.

For context, it's not uncommon for Asians to live with our parents even at 25 years old because houses are so darn expensive

Anyway, I had a brutal day. I woke up on the wrong side of bed. A client told me off at the office. I spilled a coffee at my desk. I sprained my ankle

By the time I got home, I just wanted to crawl into bed and not do anything else

Anyway, my parents are out shopping, and my mom calls and asks if I need dinner. For reasons I cannot explain, I **really** wanted a cheese dog from Five Guys. Like, I just couldn't explain it, I just knew that at this very moment, I would have paid $500 bucks if I could make that cheese dog materialize in front of me instantly

My mom said ok. I even sent a message to my dad reminding me explicitly I wanted a Five Guys cheese dog

I lied down in bed and waited an anxious hour before my parents were home

Mom told me she has my food ready: A cheese sandwich from 7-11

I stared at it in horror for a moment, wondering if they were playing a joke. At this point, dad looked at his phone and slapped his forehead. I said nothing, but simply went back into my room and closed the door. I nearly cried

Mom knocked on the door, asking why I was doing this over a damn sandwich. I said I wanted nothing more than the specific food I had asked them both to get. Mom said sorry, but she insisted I am an adult and this was a ""nothing burger"". We both raised our voices and I insisted I wanted nothing more than the cheese dog while she said I was being unappreciative of them buying me dinner

I called my girlfriend. Bless that woman. She came over immediately, picked me up, drove us to the nearest Five Guys which was 30 mins away, bought me the cheese dog and I gobbled it down happily. It seriously made my day

I sometimes ponder over this incident. In hindsight, it was just a damn cheese dog and I could have just bought it myself anytime I like.

Since I am a very slow coffee drinker, the auto-off spoils the fun a bit for me. 

Is it advisable to just turn the machine back on in order to keep the hot plate on for another turn? 

When I do so, there is no sound of the machine trying to suck water. So somehow it seems to understand that there's no water in the tank.

1kolxbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderline/comments/1kolxbt/this_is_really_long_i_am_in_desperate_need_for/,This is really long. I am in desperate need for advice.,"TW: SI, SA, swearing

On 5/4, I (F33 with anxiety, PTSD, and recently diagnosed high-functioning BPD) ideated to commit suicide after getting in a rare and heated fight with my husband (M36, type-I BP) because I could not talk about things that were hurting me without him talking over me. I deeply regret this occurring in the first place--I very well could have communicated things much better, and I feel deeply that I should have contained my frustration and anger.

The talking-over aspect did not affect us early on in our otherwise healthy (at least from my perspective--in his current hypo/manic state he has been saying much differently) and loving relationship, which started in early 2023.

Over the years, I had confided in my partner that I was sexually assaulted from the ages of 8-13, r\*ped by an ex at 23, and then by a date at 26. None of these occasions really affect me unless I am very stressed out. I also confided in him that I have a mother who, though I deeply love her and she provided me a great childhood for the most part, did also frequently verbally and emotionally abuse all of us in my immediate family (which my husband has witnessed himself), and physically abused me in private on about five different occasions. I am twistedly grateful, because this is not nearly as much as others have experienced, and I have tried to bring her to counseling with me, where she did admit to these actions (which was a huge step, as she normally denies they ever happened and accuses me of making things up).

In the interim, my partner has been ideal: supportive, kind, helpful, and wise. He also has spent lots of time with me every day since we have gotten together. He is a person who works from home and is somewhat reclusive, so he appreciated when I would take him outside for walks or encouraged him to bring over friends for a weekly hangout session.

Things started really going south for me early in 2025, because I work for a nonprofit that had its funding cut by DOGE. I was a high school teacher for 8 years, but I now teach refugees and those who were just released from prison. At this point, my husband, who is very involved politically, started acting a little more manic with his words and started talking over everyone, even at his work. I started staying in bed often after work: our couch is very uncomfortable, and my husband works in our small living room. I am also frequently exhausted after a 1.5-hour commute and a day of teaching, and, often, instructions on how to handle ICE at the workplace and/or students not showing up due to being shot or otherwise hurt in their communities on the West/South sides of Chicago.

The political situation affected my husband, myself, and my job critically. I am a teacher by trade, and now there is no federal Department of Education. Each day was a roller coaster as we followed the news. My husband remained supportive.

Then I was SA'd for hopefully the last time on 3/11, this time in public on the way to work. I managed to get to work, call my supervisor about it, and go home. I had to take off work, and it affected my performance thereafter. A nuanced situation involved a superior at work denying this assault occurred, and then my supervisor upbraiding me when I called out the superior and called her unprofessional. I acknowledge that I have been recently diagnosed with BPD (last week in the hospital, actually), and this makes me out to be an unreliable narrator. It kills me. I feel like I know what is true and I try to be honest.

So, dealing with all of this, I needed someone to talk to. I wasn't aware of warm lines yet. I would count to five on my fingers, and before I could get to five, my husband would talk and then not stop monologuing for minutes at a time, anytime I was around him. I was not bothered usually, and I liked hearing him speak, but now I needed someone to talk to.

At the grocery store on 5/4, I couldn't even ask which frozen pizza to get. Every time my mouth opened, his would, and he would override me. I then yelled at him (without cussing at him) all the way home (we live in the city, and the grocery store is a mile away). Then, I ideated to the point where he called crisis, and I was taken to the ER. I was discharged shortly thereafter.

The next day, my mother sent very triggering texts about my SI (basically telling me to blame myself for all that has happened to me), and I spiraled into a panic attack. My husband left while I was panicking to speak to his father, who was waiting downstairs with coffee. They ended up speaking for an hour and a half--later, I learned it was about my SI the day prior. I left our condo, angry at this ""betrayal,"" and ideated to the point where I drove to a different state to carry out s\*icide.

My husband did not call me once during this two-and-a-half-hour drive I took, before I was intercepted by my sister in WI. I, after an hour or so, began calling him and cussing him out, threatening divorce, thinking he did not care that I was about to no longer be living. (This was extreme, verbally abusive, and objectively wrong on my part. It hurts me to admit this because I think of how hurtful it was to my husband and his parents, who heard the whole awful diatribe, and I wish I could take it back.) He refused my calls after this.

I was taken to the hospital again, where I was then admitted to an inpatient BH hospital. My stay there was very helpful, and I received a diagnosis of high-functioning BPD. It explains outbursts I have at my parents, and unnecessary fights and hurtful things I have said to my beloved siblings. I am no longer afraid of being abandoned or cheated on, but I did experience these feelings in past relationships. I do not think my current style of communication with my family members is healthy. I think in the past I have not handled aggression from my students or parents well (I thank extensive therapy for helping with communication over the past decade, but I am clearly not there yet if I have BPD). I have never been physically abusive, but it is clear to me now that I have been verbally abusive. I cannot begin to explain how horrible and regrettable it feels to have hurt people close to me who love me.

At first at the BH hospital, my husband was listed as my support person and main contact. I did not know because I was away, but my awful actions had triggered a breakthrough manic state in my husband. I feel now like I metaphorically shot him in the chest. He did not call me for days, and I felt completely alone at a mental hospital, where I had never been before.

Over these days, my husband called my mother and father, asking them if specific abusive events had occurred when I was a child. My parents are hard to describe as they are very nuanced, and I love them, but they are not the most supportive, and they said detrimental things about me and did not support me during this phone call. Of course they did not cop up to the abuse happening--even my father, who has been abused physically, emotionally, and verbally by my mother. My husband also called all of his family members and even his 95yo grandmother, asking if he should divorce me due to my newly diagnosed BPD and these familial interviews.

When he finally started accepting my calls, I, believing he had been stonewalling me at my lowest point, cussed him out and told him he was treating me like a lab rat because he rattled on and on about how all of my trauma was fabricated, I had a ""shit list"" that included my mother (and no one else), and that I only ever experienced black-and-white thinking with regard to relationships with others. Whenever he could not stop talking and I could not get a word in edgewise, I told him I could not handle it and hung up the phone. I eventually got angry and had another patient blow fart noises into the phone while he would not stop babbling about who I was, how I handled situations he had never witnessed, and how I perceived things (I regret this and am honestly embarrassed about it--it was vindictive). He then called the hospital to tell the nurses I was harassing him. I was gobsmacked and already mad from what I perceived to be his stonewalling me. I had no idea what he was going through.

Upon my release one week after admittance, my husband told me I had to stay at my parents' house while completing PHP/IOP and would not accept me home. He said he could not handle me anymore. He refused my calls and texts and said he did not want to see me.

When I arrived at our home to gather my belongings, his father was randomly outside the door. I said, ""Hello?"" and he said, ""Nice to see you."" He was on the phone with my husband.

When I walked downstairs, there my husband was with his father, minutes after he said that he did not want to see me. I flipped him off in front of his father. (This is embarrassing and awful, but I am trying to be objective and honest in my presentation of what happened.) I thought he had been stonewalling me, and did not know about his mental state. He walked away, saying to his father, ""She's done. I'm done with her."" He canceled all of my credit cards from our joint account and broke off all shared everything on the internet, even down to our NYT subscription.

Later that day, I was able to talk him down and encouraged him to Facetime me. For one hour, he told me how I treat my MAGA parents like shit (I honestly do, but I thought I had good reason--still his point is valid that it doesn't help), how I get angry in fights with my family, how I hyperfocus on arguments--all of this is valid. But he also said some categorically unevidenced and hurtful things, like I was unable to foster positive relationships with anyone, that I didn't care for him enough, that I laid in bed too much and it made him depressed, that I didn't allow him to leave the house or go out with his friends, that the fallout from my SA was petty work drama. I told him he was having a manic episode, and he said, with bulging eyes, ""That's cute.""

I called him after this and he apologized for ""throwing the kitchen sink"" at me, but that he stood by his every word and also stood by not contacting me at the hospital. My heart was broken at the hospital, but now it was getting worse. I told him I wanted to care for him during his episode, and that I would be his Nurse Ratched. We laughed together during this phone call, and reassured each other that we loved each other.

The caring for him at home lasted two days. He said extremely cruel things, told me he ""no longer loved me, just pitied me,"" that he loves and believes my family more than he loves and believes me, that he just feels numb toward me, that he wants a divorce, that his future relationships will be better, that he learned to listen from me and he was thankful he could use that in future relationships, that I didn't allow him any time with his friends (completely false), etc.

Now my husband is telling me that my entire past of trauma was made up. He tells me he believes my family over me, and that I ""split"" my abusive mother, emotionally detached father, and a few random strangers (whom he has not met, and I have just fleetingly complained about over the past years). He also tells me every day now that he is on the fence about our marriage and that he feels no love toward me anymore, just numbness.

I have been trying to go full no-contact with him at his request to give him space. This morning, he sent me half of our savings. My heart is completely shattered. I want to work hard to go into remission for BPD, and I want to stay to support my husband. I love him deeply. I told him I have to block him in order to not text him. I feel this heartbreak viscerally, like physical pain. I do not know what to do to take things back. It has been the worst weeks, months of our lives. We never have spoken to each other like this. I do not know how to proceed. I want to stay with my beloved husband. I feel like he is not himself. This state of not knowing whether or not he really wants to divorce me is nothing short of ghastly.

He told me he needs time to go to therapy, talk about the trauma he endured with his kindergarten teacher (just one of the weird things he has said lately), that he wants to find himself again because he apparently has lost it in codependency on me (I would want him to do that if this is true), and¬†*then, after all that time,*¬†take time to assess our marriage to see if it's right for him, and¬†*then*¬†allow me home. I have had to quit my job in the city due to this uncertainty in where I will live (my 39k income alone honestly does not pay enough for me to have my own apartment in any safe neighborhood). He also told me that I have triggered the first bipolar episode that he has had in 16 years, that I make him emotionally and physically sick, that I trigger him and caused him major trauma, and that he also still feels numb toward me and zero love.

I feel like my life turned into the Jerry Springer show over one week, and that it is absolutely my fault. I don't know what to do. I can't handle staying six months at my parents' house (where they continuously psychoanalyze me and I have to just stay silent because I no longer want to blow up) while he recovers and supposedly rediscovers himself. I blame myself for everything that has happened. I feel awful, and like I have caused my husband major trauma and even damaged his brain with this manic episode. My heart is worse than breaking. I don't know what to do. I would go to hell and back to retrieve my old husband. Our life is a nightmare right now.",1,1747461387.0,Borderline,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a big fan of coffee (and legitimately addicted to caffeine) as is the lady love whom I spend a good amount of time camping with and if I‚Äôm not with her I‚Äôm with the fellas backpacking or camping in between caves. 

I HATE instant coffee and have yet to find any instant coffee I want in my body. I did the MRE instant coffee in the Corps and that was enough instant for a life time of you ask me. I‚Äôve been using Kuju pour over sacks recently as the coffee is pretty okay - good enough for out in the woods and the light roast is a cup of heaven in the cold after a long slough as far as I‚Äôm concerned. My problem with them is what I like most about them. They‚Äôre pour overs. I only bring a single cup with me, the cup I use to heat water over my PocketRocket and to make pour overs you gotta pour over the coffee which is kinda hard to do with one cup, ya dig? This is solved (kinda) when I‚Äôm camping or backpacking with others and can borrow a mug but if I‚Äôm with my GF for example, who also just packs a single Ti cup, one of us can make a cup of coffee just fine but then I‚Äôm is SOL till her cup of coffee is done. She gets her coffee first, I‚Äôm not trying to get mauled, I‚Äôm dumb but not that dumb. 

I don‚Äôt want to add another mug just for my morning coffee. That just seems like a waste of space and weight even if it‚Äôs just another Ti cup. I don‚Äôt want to bring an Aeropress, I‚Äôm not bringing a moka pot, and I‚Äôm not packing a kettle so what‚Äôs the best option coffee wise?

## Key Features Analysis

The 2025 hot water dispenser taps are packed with innovative features designed to enhance user experience and convenience.

**Temperature Control Technology**

Advanced temperature control technology is a crucial feature in modern hot water dispenser taps. The ability to precisely adjust the water temperature is vital for different applications. Premium models now offer temperature settings ranging from lukewarm (around 70¬∞C) for delicate teas to near-boiling (98¬∞C) for cooking and sterilization. Digital displays and intuitive controls allow users to select the perfect temperature for their needs, minimizing wastage and ensuring optimal results. Furthermore, some taps incorporate safety features that prevent accidental scalding, particularly significant in households with children.

**Filtration Systems**

Integrated filtration systems are increasingly common in hot water dispenser taps. These systems remove impurities, chlorine, and other contaminants from the water supply, enhancing the taste and quality of the dispensed water. Multi-stage filtration processes utilize activated carbon filters, sediment filters, and potentially UV sterilization to ensure water purity. Filter replacement indicators are also becoming standard,alerting users when it's time to replace the filter cartridge. The lifespan of these filters typically ranges from three to six months, depending on water usage and quality.

**Safety Mechanisms**

Safety is paramount when dealing with near-boiling water. Modern hot water dispenser taps incorporate various safety mechanisms to prevent accidents. Child safety locks are a common feature, requiring a specific action to activate the hot water dispensing function.Insulated spouts and housings minimize the risk of burns from accidental contact with the tap. Additionally, some models feature automatic shut-off mechanisms that halt the water flow after a certain period of inactivity, preventing potential overflows and conserving energy.

**Tank Capacity and Heating Power**

The tank capacity and heating power of a hot water dispenser tap directly influence its performance and suitability for different households. Tank capacities typically range from 2 to 5 liters, with larger tanks being ideal for families or frequent users. Heating power, measured in watts, determines how quickly the tap can heat the water to the desired temperature. Higher wattage models offer faster heating times, but may also consume more energy. Balancing tank capacity and heating power is essential to ensure the tap meets your hot water needs without compromising efficiency.

key features of the best hot water dispenser taps include:

* Precise temperature control

1kolok1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1kolok1/this_is_really_long_i_need_advice/,This is really long. I need advice.,"TW: SI, SA, swearing

On 5/4, I (F33 with anxiety, PTSD, and recently diagnosed high-functioning BPD) ideated to commit suicide after getting in a rare and heated fight with my husband (M36, type-I BP) because I could not talk about things that were hurting me without him talking over me. I deeply regret this occurring in the first place--I very well could have communicated things much better, and I feel deeply that I should have contained my frustration and anger.

The talking-over aspect did not affect us early on in our otherwise healthy (at least from my perspective--in his current hypo/manic state he has been saying much differently) and loving relationship, which started in early 2023.

Over the years, I had confided in my partner that I was sexually assaulted from the ages of 8-13, r\*ped by an ex at 23, and then by a date at 26. None of these occasions really affect me unless I am very stressed out. I also confided in him that I have a mother who, though I deeply love her and she provided me a great childhood for the most part, did also frequently verbally and emotionally abuse all of us in my immediate family (which my husband has witnessed himself), and physically abused me in private on about five different occasions. I am twistedly grateful, because this is not nearly as much as others have experienced, and I have tried to bring her to counseling with me, where she did admit to these actions (which was a huge step, as she normally denies they ever happened and accuses me of making things up).

In the interim, my partner has been ideal: supportive, kind, helpful, and wise. He also has spent lots of time with me every day since we have gotten together. He is a person who works from home and is somewhat reclusive, so he appreciated when I would take him outside for walks or encouraged him to bring over friends for a weekly hangout session.

Things started really going south for me early in 2025, because I work for a nonprofit that had its funding cut by DOGE. I was a high school teacher for 8 years, but I now teach refugees and those who were just released from prison. At this point, my husband, who is very involved politically, started acting a little more manic with his words and started talking over everyone, even at his work. I started staying in bed often after work: our couch is very uncomfortable, and my husband works in our small living room. I am also frequently exhausted after a 1.5-hour commute and a day of teaching, and, often, instructions on how to handle ICE at the workplace and/or students not showing up due to being shot or otherwise hurt in their communities on the West/South sides of Chicago.

The political situation affected my husband, myself, and my job critically. I am a teacher by trade, and now there is no federal Department of Education. Each day was a roller coaster as we followed the news. My husband remained supportive.

Then I was SA'd for hopefully the last time on 3/11, this time in public on the way to work. I managed to get to work, call my supervisor about it, and go home. I had to take off work, and it affected my performance thereafter. A nuanced situation involved a superior at work denying this assault occurred, and then my supervisor upbraiding me when I called out the superior and called her unprofessional. I acknowledge that I have been recently diagnosed with BPD (last week in the hospital, actually), and this makes me out to be an unreliable narrator. It kills me. I feel like I know what is true and I try to be honest.

So, dealing with all of this, I needed someone to talk to. I wasn't aware of warm lines yet. I would count to five on my fingers, and before I could get to five, my husband would talk and then not stop monologuing for minutes at a time, anytime I was around him. I was not bothered usually, and I liked hearing him speak, but now I needed someone to talk to.

At the grocery store on 5/4, I couldn't even ask which frozen pizza to get. Every time my mouth opened, his would, and he would override me. I then yelled at him (without cussing at him) all the way home (we live in the city, and the grocery store is a mile away). Then, I ideated to the point where he called crisis, and I was taken to the ER. I was discharged shortly thereafter.

The next day, my mother sent very triggering texts about my SI (basically telling me to blame myself for all that has happened to me), and I spiraled into a panic attack. My husband left while I was panicking to speak to his father, who was waiting downstairs with coffee. They ended up speaking for an hour and a half--later, I learned it was about my SI the day prior. I left our condo, angry at this ""betrayal,"" and ideated to the point where I drove to a different state to carry out s\*icide.

My husband did not call me once during this two-and-a-half-hour drive I took, before I was intercepted by my sister in WI. I, after an hour or so, began calling him and cussing him out, threatening divorce, thinking he did not care that I was about to no longer be living. (This was extreme, verbally abusive, and objectively wrong on my part. It hurts me to admit this because I think of how hurtful it was to my husband and his parents, who heard the whole awful diatribe, and I wish I could take it back.) He refused my calls after this.

I was taken to the hospital again, where I was then admitted to an inpatient BH hospital. My stay there was very helpful, and I received a diagnosis of high-functioning BPD. It explains outbursts I have at my parents, and unnecessary fights and hurtful things I have said to my beloved siblings. I am no longer afraid of being abandoned or cheated on, but I did experience these feelings in past relationships. I do not think my current style of communication with my family members is healthy. I think in the past I have not handled aggression from my students or parents well (I thank extensive therapy for helping with communication over the past decade, but I am clearly not there yet if I have BPD). I have never been physically abusive, but it is clear to me now that I have been verbally abusive. I cannot begin to explain how horrible and regrettable it feels to have hurt people close to me who love me.

At first at the BH hospital, my husband was listed as my support person and main contact. I did not know because I was away, but my awful actions had triggered a breakthrough manic state in my husband. I feel now like I metaphorically shot him in the chest. He did not call me for days, and I felt completely alone at a mental hospital, where I had never been before.

Over these days, my husband called my mother and father, asking them if specific abusive events had occurred when I was a child. My parents are hard to describe as they are very nuanced, and I love them, but they are not the most supportive, and they said detrimental things about me and did not support me during this phone call. Of course they did not cop up to the abuse happening--even my father, who has been abused physically, emotionally, and verbally by my mother. My husband also called all of his family members and even his 95yo grandmother, asking if he should divorce me due to my newly diagnosed BPD and these familial interviews.

When he finally started accepting my calls, I, believing he had been stonewalling me at my lowest point, cussed him out and told him he was treating me like a lab rat because he rattled on and on about how all of my trauma was fabricated, I had a ""shit list"" that included my mother (and no one else), and that I only ever experienced black-and-white thinking with regard to relationships with others. Whenever he could not stop talking and I could not get a word in edgewise, I told him I could not handle it and hung up the phone. I eventually got angry and had another patient blow fart noises into the phone while he would not stop babbling about who I was, how I handled situations he had never witnessed, and how I perceived things (I regret this and am honestly embarrassed about it--it was vindictive). He then called the hospital to tell the nurses I was harassing him. I was gobsmacked and already mad from what I perceived to be his stonewalling me. I had no idea what he was going through.

Upon my release one week after admittance, my husband told me I had to stay at my parents' house while completing PHP/IOP and would not accept me home. He said he could not handle me anymore. He refused my calls and texts and said he did not want to see me.

When I arrived at our home to gather my belongings, his father was randomly outside the door. I said, ""Hello?"" and he said, ""Nice to see you."" He was on the phone with my husband.

When I walked downstairs, there my husband was with his father, minutes after he said that he did not want to see me. I flipped him off in front of his father. (This is embarrassing and awful, but I am trying to be objective and honest in my presentation of what happened.) I thought he had been stonewalling me, and did not know about his mental state. He walked away, saying to his father, ""She's done. I'm done with her."" He canceled all of my credit cards from our joint account and broke off all shared everything on the internet, even down to our NYT subscription.

Later that day, I was able to talk him down and encouraged him to Facetime me. For one hour, he told me how I treat my MAGA parents like shit (I honestly do, but I thought I had good reason--still his point is valid that it doesn't help), how I get angry in fights with my family, how I hyperfocus on arguments--all of this is valid. But he also said some categorically unevidenced and hurtful things, like I was unable to foster positive relationships with anyone, that I didn't care for him enough, that I laid in bed too much and it made him depressed, that I didn't allow him to leave the house or go out with his friends, that the fallout from my SA was petty work drama. I told him he was having a manic episode, and he said, with bulging eyes, ""That's cute.""

I called him after this and he apologized for ""throwing the kitchen sink"" at me, but that he stood by his every word and also stood by not contacting me at the hospital. My heart was broken at the hospital, but now it was getting worse. I told him I wanted to care for him during his episode, and that I would be his Nurse Ratched. We laughed together during this phone call, and reassured each other that we loved each other.

The caring for him at home lasted two days. He said extremely cruel things, told me he ""no longer loved me, just pitied me,"" that he loves and believes my family more than he loves and believes me, that he just feels numb toward me, that he wants a divorce, that his future relationships will be better, that he learned to listen from me and he was thankful he could use that in future relationships, that I didn't allow him any time with his friends (completely false), etc.

Now my husband is telling me that my entire past of trauma was made up. He tells me he believes my family over me, and that I ""split"" my abusive mother, emotionally detached father, and a few random strangers (whom he has not met, and I have just fleetingly complained about over the past years). He also tells me every day now that he is on the fence about our marriage and that he feels no love toward me anymore, just numbness.

I have been trying to go full no-contact with him at his request to give him space. This morning, he sent me half of our savings. My heart is completely shattered. I want to work hard to go into remission for BPD, and I want to stay to support my husband. I love him deeply. I told him I have to block him in order to not text him. I feel this heartbreak viscerally, like physical pain. I do not know what to do to take things back. It has been the worst weeks, months of our lives. We never have spoken to each other like this. I do not know how to proceed. I want to stay with my beloved husband. I feel like he is not himself. This state of not knowing whether or not he really wants to divorce me is nothing short of ghastly.

He told me he needs time to go to therapy, talk about the trauma he endured with his kindergarten teacher (just one of the weird things he has said lately), that he wants to find himself again because he apparently has lost it in codependency on me (I would want him to do that if this is true), and¬†*then, after all that time,*¬†take time to assess our marriage to see if it's right for him, and¬†*then*¬†allow me home. I have had to quit my job in the city due to this uncertainty in where I will live (my 39k income alone honestly does not pay enough for me to have my own apartment in any safe neighborhood). He also told me that I have triggered the first bipolar episode that he has had in 16 years, that I make him emotionally and physically sick, that I trigger him and caused him major trauma, and that he also still feels numb toward me and zero love.

I feel like my life turned into the Jerry Springer show over one week, and that it is absolutely my fault. I don't know what to do. I can't handle staying six months at my parents' house (where they continuously psychoanalyze me and I have to just stay silent because I no longer want to blow up) while he recovers and supposedly rediscovers himself. I blame myself for everything that has happened. I feel awful, and like I have caused my husband major trauma and even damaged his brain with this manic episode. My heart is worse than breaking. I don't know what to do. I would go to hell and back to retrieve my old husband. Our life is a nightmare right now.",2,1747460436.0,BPD,0,1.0,False

‚ÄúNo kids,‚Äù I responded with a grunt. I wasn‚Äôt about to let him get to me. He could bat those long eyelashes and flash his perfect teeth at another Alpha. I didn‚Äôt know what his angle was yet, but I knew he wasn‚Äôt getting what he wanted from me. I‚Äôd stayed alive all these years because of my rules. No sexy Omega with a cute ass and gorgeous eyes had made me break them yet, and this one wasn‚Äôt going to make me start that day.

‚ÄúNot at all. No kids involved. I want you to kidnap me,‚Äù he said, and his words were enough to pull my attention away from the swell of his ample cock. Morrison was a pro. He‚Äôd scooted his chair back from the table just enough so that I could see the outline of his erection through his pants. I still wasn‚Äôt going to be tempted. Even if he was hung for an Omega. It would take more than a big cock to make me risk my life, and I didn‚Äôt fuck around with kids.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a crazy little punk,‚Äù I said, just as the waiter brought our lobsters. ‚ÄúLook, baby boy, I don‚Äôt do weirdo sex fantasies. I‚Äôm not a gigolo.‚Äù

Morrison laughed and I wanted to wrap my hands around his throat. It was the most violent thought I‚Äôd had about such an innocent young Omega in a long time, but then my mind shifted. I saw his dark hair against my silk pillow while my cock was buried deep inside his velvet ass.

In my mind, my hands were chocking his moans back while the tip of my cock bottomed out in him. No other Omega had brought out my savage side the way Morrison did. I wanted nothing more than to drag him to the men‚Äôs room and impale him on my cock while he screamed into the palm of my hand. It was my right to take him as hard as I wanted, but what I wanted was him begging for a taste of my dick. Any Alpha could fuck an Omega, but not every Alpha could make them plead for it.

‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm no little boy,‚Äù he spat, and it was just the kind of bratty response I‚Äôd expect from a barely legal mafia prince. My suspicion was that he‚Äôd had whatever he wanted whenever he wanted it. He might as well have been wearing a sign that said I‚Äôm spoiled.

Morrison hadn‚Äôt told me his father was mafia but I could almost smell it on him. It was the way he looked expensive and cheap at the same time. His clothes were tailored and he was in excellent

health, but Morrison had that desperate look about him. He didn‚Äôt belong in those clothes or in this restaurant. It was a costume he wore to get what he wanted. If only I‚Äôd known that I was right about him being out of place but so wrong about why.

‚ÄúEat your lobster,‚Äù I said and dug into mine. I tried to savor every bite. I‚Äôd lived the high life, when I wasn‚Äôt working, with the money I made working for bad men. I knew it was over, though. The finer things were slipping between my fingers. The life I‚Äôd held in my hands was a puddle at my feet, but I wouldn‚Äôt let Morrison see it.

He must have understood the conversation was over for the time being. I liked that he listened to me. I‚Äôd never broken an Omega like him before, but I imagined it would be fun. Most Omegas did what I wanted without putting up a fight. I thought perhaps a challenge could be fun. Making him beg for mercy would‚Äôve been stimulating at the very least. It would be even more fun than having him beg for my cock. I knew I could take his tight little body and make it come until he passed out.

That was the last thing I needed to be thinking about. Although my dick wouldn‚Äôt let me think about anything else. Morrison had a piece of lobster in his fingers and he dipped it into butter and sucked it off. I‚Äôd seen that movie. I was far less impressed with his little show than my dick seemed to be. It twitched and strained against the fabric of my slacks. I tried not to watch him as his tongue darted out of his pink lips and lapped away a drop of butter. It was too easy to imagine that was my cum he tasted.

Damn. Even when I tried to stay strong, I fell into Morrison‚Äôs trap. How was this brat able to get under my skin? It had to be fatigue and worry. I would normally never fall for this little minx‚Äôs bullshit.

# 2- At the rymes of the waves

‚ÄúThis is really good,‚Äù he purred.

‚ÄúYou putting on a show just tells me you really are a child.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm nineteen.‚Äù Morrison pouted.

Well, that was a relief. He was too young for me to be interested in anything more than a bathroom blow job, but at least my cock wasn‚Äôt a criminal pervert. Omegas that young didn‚Äôt even know what to do with an Alpha dick yet, and I wasn‚Äôt interested in running a preschool. Or was I? My treacherous cock was painfully engorged at that point, and Morrison‚Äôs sweet cinnamon scent was overpowering my ability to make rational decisions.

I had to admit that the knowledge he was at least legal changed things a bit in regard to his business proposition. I normally wouldn‚Äôt consider an offer like his but I was desperate for cash. I wouldn‚Äôt fuck him, but I reasoned that perhaps I could work for him. Having him in my control after I‚Äôd ‚Äúkidnapped him‚Äù gave us plenty of opportunity for Morrison to practice his cock sucking skills. Hey, I‚Äôd just vowed not to fuck him. Letting him dick dive a few times was totally different.

Getting out of town was my first priority. The problem was that I was nearly broke and I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about having my cock swallowed. Over the last two weeks, I‚Äôd gone from being wealthy beyond anything I‚Äôd ever imagined to having almost nothing. You‚Äôd think that would keep my mind off Morrison‚Äôs mouth, but the way he kept putting his pretty lips and pink tongue on display meant that it wasn‚Äôt my fault that I had to grip the tablecloth to keep from jumping out of my chair and skull fucking

him in front of the entire restaurant.

Okay, I had to get my mind back on my survival. My last job had done me in. The client didn‚Äôt tell me the hit was on an entire family. I was shocked when I snuck into the house and found the target‚Äôs wife and young son in the room where I‚Äôd been instructed to kill the mark.

There was no way it was a mistake or accident. The client had given me painstakingly specific instructions about how the target was supposed to die and in what room his body should be left for the authorities. This wasn‚Äôt unusual. People often wanted to leave a message.

But I didn‚Äôt mess with kids. Everyone knew that. Not all my rules were public knowledge, but some of them were for the specific reason of avoiding situations like the one I found myself in that night. I didn‚Äôt want to kill the wife either, but when she saw me, the bitch came after me with a knife she had stashed in a hidden sheath under the coffee table. She left me no choice. A double tap to the brain is what she bought herself for making a stupid move.

I did the husband without blinking an eye. He was scum so I wouldn‚Äôt shed a tear over his death. That left me with the kid. He just stood there in the hallway, staring off into space at first.

He began to cry when his mother tried to attack me. It was only later, after the father was dead too, that I discovered the bruises on the little boy‚Äôs neck and arms. His parents were monsters, and I‚Äôd saved him.

I guess I should have known there was something wrong with that household when the wife took out a knife strapped to a coffee table. Some of these motherfuckers had families that were clueless about the shit my marks were into, but in this case, the wife was part of it. I didn‚Äôt even want to think about what the kid had seen or been through up until that point.

There was no part of me that could kill him. I took the boy with me that night. I had one friend in law enforcement that I could trust. Detective Manuel VC was the only police I knew who wasn‚Äôt tied in some way to the mob. I took the boy to him.

He met me at our usual rendezvous point. It was an old, abandoned barn out in the middle of the country. I could never risk being seen with him in the city.

When I arrived with the child, Manuel VCwas shocked. He knew who I was but my work wasn‚Äôt something we discussed. Ever. His job was to put criminals behind bars and my job was to kill them. Our acquaintance was based on my feeding him information on the rival families. The rest was unspoken so that Manuel VCdidn‚Äôt have to attempt to arrest his star informant and I didn‚Äôt have to kill the one good cop in town.

This particular situation was different. I told him the kid needed to go into witness protection and that there was a price on his head. That may not have been true in that moment, but it would be as soon as it got back to my employer that the kid had lived through the night.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt put him in witness protection unless he witnessed something,‚Äù Manuel VCsaid.

‚ÄúHis parents are dead. He saw his mother killed by a hitman. They were both criminals. I‚Äôm sure he witnessed a great deal more than their untimely demise,‚Äù I responded. ‚ÄúThis kid probably has information on his parents‚Äô entire operation. Information their rivals and successors would kill for.‚Äù ‚ÄúWho is he going to tell us killed his parents?‚Äù Manuel VCasked.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving the country. Please don‚Äôt try and contact me again. Forget you knew me,‚Äù I said as I walked away. That was the end of my career and the beginning of the end of my life. I‚Äôd signed my death warrant when I handed that terrified, battered Omega over to Lenny.

‚ÄúHey, jackass. I said I‚Äôm not a kid.‚Äù Morrison‚Äôs voice brought me out of my thoughts. I felt him kick my shoe under the table. That was another spanking. I‚Äôd decided to keep a tally in my head.

‚ÄúWow, you‚Äôre a brat. I should take you into the bathroom and paddle your ass. Maybe that would shut you up,‚Äù I said, and again my traitorous cock hardened at the thought. If I‚Äôd thought a good ass whipping wouldn‚Äôt send Morrison running for another would-be kidnapper, I‚Äôd have done it too.

Something made me leery of letting Morrison put his life in the hands of another criminal. Most of them wouldn‚Äôt have the restraint I‚Äôd built using my rules.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôd like that, wouldn‚Äôt you?‚Äù he asked and licked his lips. ‚ÄúYou want my bare ass across your lap.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis conversation has become unproductive,‚Äù I said in a clinical tone.

‚ÄúDo you even care why I want you to kidnap me. You never asked,‚Äù Morrison said as he crossed his arms across his chest and leaned back against the chair. I studied him for a moment, and for the first time, I saw the slight cracks in his bravado. He was scared.

‚ÄúFine, but I‚Äôm going to finish my dinner while you tell me your little story,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúGo on.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy father is a monster. A lot of men in his position are monsters at work, but they leave it there. They do what needs to be done, but when they come home to their spouses and children, they are loving and devoted husbands and fathers,‚Äù Morrison began. ‚ÄúThat does not describe my father. He is a real fiend. It‚Äôs inside him. It‚Äôs who he is.‚Äù",1,1747460225.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

I work as a grave digger at my local cemetery. I don't make bucket loads but it keeps me fed and provides me with a roof above my head which is all that matters to me. For this past year I've been absolutely exhausted (mentally and physically) but I ignored the warning signs because I want to create the illusion to the boss that I'm a reliable person and prove to society that I am not a failure in this 'you have to stay busy' culture. This all came crashing down one fine day in April and now I'm brunt out. This was later confirmed by not only my general practitioner but also the company doctor (which is required by law to go to). My boss called me up around 2 weeks into my sick leave asking to come into work during break to grab a coffee with colleagues and have a chat with him. I thought why not, sounds harmless enough. I entered our cafeteria fully expecting collegues to react joyfully but it was rather lackluster. It seemed as though they were actively trying to avoid my gaze as if they are annoyed with the fact I am on sick leave. My boss pulled me into a room and it almost felt like an interrogation. Pestering me as to why I am sick and wanting me to go into specifics and what I thought the cause was. I told him I was not comfortable discussing that. Further more your boss isn't even allowed to ask you those questions as it goes against privacy laws. We have very strong privacy laws here in the EU. He then requested I pop into work during break once a week as not to 'lose touch' with my colleagues. I told him 'absolutely not'. He kinda got annoyed but eventually sent me on my way and ended with 'get better soon'. Why should I come into work when my own collegues didn't even wanna talk to me. How the hell would that benefit me. If anything it will give me extra stress and stonewall my recovery process . Anyway I just wanted to get that off my chest. I'm really afraid he will continue pressuring me to come in and now's not the time for added stress when brunt out. Anyone here have some advice ? Thanks for reading, bit of a long post :) 

TLDR: I'm burnt out from work, boss wants me to come once a week  in during the break to chat, he got annoyed I said no. Advice?",17,1747460222.0,antiwork,15,0.95,False

Turns out he recently suffered from losing his father. As the hormonal female I am I felt the desire to cheer him up and share some life advice I‚Äôve gained. We agreed to meet the following week. I invited him to archery. Note that both times I treated him as a friend, even took the patience of an older sister.  Literally doing anything to avoid being weird. Splitting the bill, going to places that‚Äôs not given a hint of being flirty, basically treating each outing as a coffee chat if I could. 

Today we were casually talking and then at midnight he called me and being all curious asking me what my future plans are.

I don‚Äôt understand this guy. He used to go to my work just to see me, he confessed that to me on our first date. He found me on all my social media and wrote me a ‚ÄúHello üòä.‚Äù I ignored him for 8 months because I was hung up on someone else. I decided to follow him again on Instagram and give him a chance to get to know him. He started liking my posts, my stories, until I finally got the courage to write him and say, ‚ÄúHi, I hadn‚Äôt seen your message.‚Äù And from there, we started talking.

A week later, he invited me out to eat and confessed that he had been going to my work just to see me (I work selling breakfasts). But when he talks to me by messages, it seems like he doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me. We had a second date drinking coffee, and we barely talked because I got nervous, but we talked a little.

It‚Äôs been a week now, and he hasn‚Äôt invited me out again. Also, chatting with him through messages is horrible; it‚Äôs like he isn‚Äôt interested. But if I stop answering, the next day he‚Äôs back messaging me ‚ÄúHello darling,‚Äù and he tells me when he gets home from work or where he went.

I tell him things about me, and he just responds with things like ‚ÄúOh okay, that‚Äôs good,‚Äù kind of answers. He doesn‚Äôt ask anything else. When I ask him about himself, he answers very little. I try to keep the conversation going, and he kind of responds, but honestly, I feel like I bother him.

Also, after the first date, someone told me he had a girlfriend. I stalked him, and it looks like he doesn‚Äôt. He told me he doesn‚Äôt have one, but it was suspicious that he sent me a screenshot of a friend talking to him saying, ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs that girlfriend? They never introduced her.‚Äù And I was like, why do you send me all this proof? And guys are experts at hiding girlfriends if they have them.

A few days ago, I told him, ‚ÄúI was hoping to see you,‚Äù and he said, ‚ÄúOh, I want to.‚Äù Then I said, ‚ÄúMaybe another day,‚Äù and he replied, ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù WTF, what do I do with that? I don‚Äôt get it. He confuses me because it seems like I interest him, but at the same time, I don‚Äôt.

Applied through Atlys - terrible choice as they take 1700 INR per person to do nothing but just take an appointment. 
Appointment is free (you can take it yourself from website of GCVW) and Atlys experience is painful to get any further updates. They did absolutely nothing after taking appointment.

Mistakes and learnings:
 
0) Don‚Äôt use Atlys for Schengen Visa. You will regret it. Everyone does. Atlys is good for VISAs of countries like Singapore.

1) Don‚Äôt buy insurance which is offered by make my trip while booking flights. They just give you insurance but don‚Äôt take your passport or age details which is left blank in insurance document. Such an insurance has no use and you will have to rebook insurance.

2) If Greece is where you are applying: make sure you spend maximum nights there in Greece. Else VFS won‚Äôt accept your application and ask you to rebook flights and hotels to adjust nights in EU so as to make sure that you are spending maximum nights there in Greece.

3) At VFS don‚Äôt fall for their trick where they say if you take premium services you will get bla bla bla. You get nothing but free coffee and cheap cookies and a sofa seat (if you are lucky). They also say they keep you posted via SMS and all. They don‚Äôt (or at best its erratic).

4) Book fully refundable hotels. I can‚Äôt stress this enough. You can cancel it all after you get your VISA and book hotels based on your preference and updated plan later.

5) Book fully refundable flights (at least the ones to EU and back from EU to home country). Yes it‚Äôs expensive but totally worth it. 
I had 2 nights less in Greece as compared to France. VFS refused to accept my application. I then rebooked a refundable flight from Paris to Pune on the spot squeezing my days in Paris. 

Once Visa is approved (you can replan your trip) without worries. Normally they approve it for 30 days. So you can adjust your trip accordingly.

Visa itself was approved and delivered at my doorstep in 6 working days. 

Documents I submitted:

1) Full itinerary (just flights and hotel reservations)
2) Cover letter
3) Bank statements
4) Proof of employment; NOC by employer (you can fudge the NOC)
5) Last 2 years ITR (acknowledgement slip and not the lengthy filing)
6) Insurance (had to redo on the spot because Make My Trip offered Insurance was rejected as that insurance document did not have basic details like date of birth or passport number).
7) 2 Photos
8) Old and New Passport 
9) Passport photo copies

Do yourself a favor: do not staple or pin your documents. 
My wife submitted same documents.

I had good travel history (UK, USA, Multiple EU countries, Singapore, Thailand etc).

BOOK ONE: FLAMES OF LOVE

January, 2018

Jaxson Anderson pushed the plate-glass door open, the overhead bell tinkling, announcing his entrance. The warmth, the yeast and sugar smell...it rushed over him, surrounding him, and he almost stopped dead in his tracks, wanting to do nothing but breathe it all in. He hadn't been in an honest-to-God bakery in ages, and had forgotten how damn delicious they smelled.

Before he could make a real ass out of himself by literally drooling just from the smell alone, though, a head popped up from behind the front counter. A cute brunette, her hair in a braid flopped over her shoulder, shot him a smile. ""Welcome to the Muffin Man,"" she called out, pushing some stray tendrils out of her face with the back of her hand. ""You been in here before?""

He'd hardly been in the town of Sawyer more than a couple of hours. ""Nope, first time here,"" he said as he walked closer to the front display case, and the adorable brunette behind it. She looked a little younger than him, with wide, innocent eyes that made her appear even younger as she peered up at him.

She was this tiny little thing that he was sure he could tuck under his arm and run with down the football field. Between her tiny stature and her wide eyes, she gave off the impression that she was twelve.

Except...he gulped. Those curves. No 12-year-old girl had those curves.

""Well then, an extra welcome!"" she said, sending him another dizzying smile. ""I'm glad you stopped by. Are you a...tourist?"" She looked a little puzzled at that idea, giving him a quick up-and-down glance.

No, he probably didn't look a damn thing like a tourist. Most fire chiefs didn't.

""Just new in town,"" he told her. ""What is good he - Sugar?!"" he said. He was staring straight at her delectable chest.

Which was probably not his best move. He knew he was being rude, but hey, she was the one who'd pinned her name tag on it. ""Your name is Sugar?!""

She rolled her eyes at him, which now that he was close enough, he could see they were a deep brown color. Like the color of the chocolate cake sitting in the display case between them. ""Don't bother making a joke,"" she told him pertly. ""I've heard every one of them that is funny, and a whole lot that aren't. I promise you, you won't be original.""

He leaned on the clear glass goodies counter, content for a moment to ignore the copious amounts of sugar underneath his arms, and instead focus on the Sugar in front of him. ""So...basically, your parents hated you.""

""Pretty much!"" she said cheerfully, shooting him a laughing grin. Right then, a guy came through the swinging doors from the back, and Jaxson nodded towards him.

""Is his name Flour?"" he asked dryly.

""No, but I like how you think!"" Sugar looked over at her co-worker and laughed. ""Gage, he thinks you ought to change your name to Flour!""

Gage looked up from off-loading a batch of muffins into a side display case. ""Hey, my parents didn't hate me,"" he drawled in a deep voice, proving that he'd overheard their discussion. ""Don't drag me into this.""

""I think I'm gonna start calling you Muffin,"" Sugar mused, shooting her co-worker a grin. ""Or maybe Baby Cakes.""

Gage rolled his eyes. ""That's just what this town needs to hear,"" he grumbled and disappeared into the back, carrying his empty tray with him.

""Woke up on the wrong side of the bed,"" Sugar said in way of explanation, complete with a shrug, as she turned back to Jaxson. ""So, what can I get for you? Coffee? Donuts? A...muffin, perhaps?"" Her voice was a little too innocent.

Jaxson's eyes shot up to hers. Was she teasing?

Her eyes were glinting with mischief. She was.

""I was thinking that I might be in the mood for some baby cakes,"" he said, his tone as innocent as hers. She burst out laughing.

""I think I like you,"" she said, shooting him a wide grin after she caught her breath.

""You'd like me even more if I had some coffee and a donut in me,"" he informed her. ""I'm a lot more fun to be around when I'm awake.""

""Even more fun?"" she echoed, wrinkling her nose as she turned to grab a to-go cup. ""Damn. I'm not sure if I can handle that much fun. Maybe I shouldn't get your coffee after all.""

""Never come between a man and his coffee,"" he intoned, only three-quarters joking.

More like half, really.

""Fair enough,"" she said, filling the cup from the dispenser. Tendrils of steam encircled her hand and then melted away. ""So what brings you to Sawyer, if you're not a tourist?""

She turned back around, deftly grabbing a lid and pushing it into place even as she was sliding the cup across the counter to him.

Yeah, she had some experience serving up coffee. He wondered for a moment how long she'd worked at the Muffin Man.

""I'm the new fire chief in town,"" he said, pulling the already warm cup towards him to sip at the life-giving liquid inside. He was staring down at the display case as he said it, contemplating which donut was the most deserving of being eaten, but even out of the corner of his eye, he could tell she'd stiffened up. His eyes shot up and caught her look. She was staring at him, mouth open. ""What's wrong?"" he asked, confused. He looked behind him, thinking maybe someone had snuck up behind him who she didn't care for, but no one was there.

He looked back at Sugar and she was smiling again, although it didn't appear nearly as natural as it had before.

""Nothing,"" she said. She cleared her throat. ""What kind of donut did you want?""

""Maple bar, please.""

She nodded, slipping the long, golden donut into a brown paper bag.

""Hold on,"" he said, another sip of coffee helping his brain begin to actually do something useful, ""why don't you make that a dozen donuts? I'm meeting with the guys down at the station for the first time this morning - holding a little get-together, you know? I should probably bring donuts with me. Help break the ice.""

She mumbled something under her breath that sounded suspiciously like, ""You're gonna need more than donuts,"" but when he shot her a questioning look, she just smiled back innocently.

""Do you care which kind?"" she asked.

""Variety,"" he said, shrugging.

She got to work, sliding some bear claws, a cake donut, some more maple bars, and a couple of sugar donuts into a cardboard box stamped ""Muffin Man"" on top. She rang him up quickly and after he slid his card into the machine, entering his PIN, she pushed the box across the counter to him.

""Good luck today,"" she said, sending him an overly brilliant smile. She followed it up by mumbling something else under her breath, and this time, he only caught the word ""need.""

""What?"" he asked, irritated.

""Nothing! Enjoy your donuts, sir.""

""Jaxson.""

""What?""

""I figured I knew your name; you should know mine. Jaxson. Plus, I'm too damn young to be called sir.""

""Enjoy your donuts...Jaxson.""

He slid the box onto his arm and, balancing his coffee cup in his other hand, made his way back towards the door. If every damn person in Sawyer was gonna take up mumbling underneath their breath while they were talking to him, he was gonna be stark-raving mad within the week.

# Chapter 2

""Did I hear him right?"" Gage asked as soon as the front door closed behind the newest resident of Long Valley. Sugar stared after him, the sight of his ass in his tight Wranglers not something she was gonna be able to forget for a long time.

Maybe never.

""Hear what?"" she asked absentmindedly. She hadn't seen a man that hot since

""Is he the new fire chief in town?"" Gage asked, a note of impatience creeping in.

She jerked her head back towards her boss. ""Oh. Sorry. Yeah, he's the new guy."" She wrinkled her nose.

Gage walked up and stood next to her at the front counter, staring out into the early morning, sparkling frost covering every barren tree branch and frozen metal bench in sight. ""Do you think he has any idea what he's in for?"" Gage asked rhetorically, wiping his hands on his apron.

Sugar answered him anyway. ""No clue,"" she said with a shrug, and then nibbled on her lower lip. ""Well, he probably wouldn't have taken the job if he'd known, so I'm gonna say no, he has no idea.""

""People don't tend to take on new jobs where they're the most hated guy in town, before they even start,"" Gage said dryly.

""Not usually.""

""Think you should've warned him?""

""Nope. He'll figure it out on his own soon enough. Plus, this way, he might come back here and let me dry his tears with a jam-filled donut or two."" Sugar winked at Gage and he just rolled his eyes and laughed and sighed. All at the same time.

It was a talent, truly.

""If he wanted to ask you out, you'd just turn him down anyway,"" he said matter-of-factly. ""Poor guy doesn't have a chance in hell.""

Sugar opened up her mouth to protest, and then closed it again with a snap. She hated it when her boss was right. Or anyone was right, when she wasn't also. ""Being wrong"" was on Sugar's Top Ten List of Shit She Hated, right along with throwing up, discussing politics, or eating oysters.

She shuddered.

""You know why I can't date,"" she said tartly. ""Hot, sexy firefighter he may be, but that still doesn't mean I'm gonna do it.""

""So you have a thing for sexy firefighters now, huh?"" Gage drawled, raising one eyebrow as he looked at her.

She sighed. She knew where Gage was going with this, and it broke her heart. Her best friend, Emma, had told her a long time ago that Gage was in love with her. Emma was probably right, considering she was Gage's younger sister. The chances were pretty damn high that she knew what the hell she was talking about.

But still...Gage?

Objectively, Sugar could tell her boss was cute. Maybe even handsome. You know, when she closed one eye and squinted real hard, she could totally tell that her boss was attractive.

For the 517th time, she wondered why she couldn't just fall for him. A lot of her problems would be solved if she could dredge up something more than friendship for the guy standing next to her.

Speaking of closing one eye and squinting real hard at her boss...She reached up to wipe the streak of flour off his nose that she'd just noticed, but he dodged out of reach. ""Hey!"" he protested.

""You had flour on your nose,"" she informed him. ""You look like a chimney sweep, except in your case, the soot is all white.""

Huh. That was probably it. She'd seen him with flour on his nose one too many times to think he was sexy. Otherwise, she'd probably be all over him.

Yeah, that was totally it. She felt better already. She hated not understanding her own mind at times. Mysteries were fun to read, not to live.

""Personal boundaries. They're a thing!"" Gage called out as he headed into the kitchen again, through the swinging doors. Sugar rolled her eyes and looked back out through the front door again, and the large picture windows showing the streets of Sawyer beginning to wake up to another day.

""Good luck, Fireman Jaxson,"" Sugar said softly to the empty bakery. ""You're gonna need all the help you can get.""",1,1747459580.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

1kolejt,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1kolejt/feedback_loop/,Feedback Loop,"Mark Thorne was a creature of the night, not literally, but by habit. He wrote his best horror stories between midnight and dawn, fueled by lukewarm coffee and the unsettling quiet of his small apartment. For months, he'd been posting his most disturbing tales on r/scarystories, watching the upvotes climb and the comments roll in, praise, critique, and the occasional ""Nope, nope, nope, turning off the lights now."" He thrived on the fear he could conjure in others, a strange validation for the anxieties that often clawed at him in the dark.

His latest piece, ""The Man Who Wore My Face,"" was a hit. It detailed a doppelganger who slowly, subtly, replaced the protagonist, starting with mimicking his habits, then his voice, and finally, his very appearance. The final line, ""I saw him in the mirror this morning, and he smiled back with my teeth,"" had earned dozens of chilling emojis and comments like ""Absolutely terrifying, felt like I was looking over my own shoulder.""

That night, Mark felt a strange chill, unrelated to the draft from his window. He was making his usual midnight coffee when he noticed it ‚Äì the sugar bowl wasn't where he always kept it. It was a small thing, insignificant, but it snagged on his attention like a loose thread. He shrugged it off. Maybe he'd moved it absentmindedly while lost in thought, a common occurrence during his writing jags.

The next morning, he reached for his favorite mug, the chipped one with the faded band logo that fit perfectly in his hand. It wasn't there. Instead, a perfectly plain, new mug sat on the drying rack, gleaming under the harsh kitchen light. A flicker of unease. He *never* used plain mugs. He had a collection, each with its own history and comfort. This felt alien. He searched the cupboards, a growing knot in his stomach, but the chipped mug was gone.

Over the next few days, the small, familiar details of his life began to shift with an unnerving frequency. The toothpaste was a different brand, the one he actively disliked. His worn armchair had a new throw pillow he didn't recognize, a floral pattern that clashed horribly with his minimalist decor. The books on his shelf were subtly rearranged, not in the meticulous, genre-sorted order he preferred, but by height, a chaotic, meaningless jumble. Each change was minor, easily dismissed in isolation, but the cumulative effect was like a growing static in his mind, a constant, low-level hum of wrongness.

He started double-checking everything. He'd leave a book on his nightstand, only to find it on the coffee table hours later. He'd put his keys in the bowl by the door, then discover them in his jacket pocket, even though he hadn't worn the jacket. He began to question his own memory, his own sanity. Was he sleepwalking? Was he just incredibly forgetful? The possibilities offered little comfort.

He tried to write, to lose himself in the fictional horrors he controlled, but the words felt wrong, stilted, like a bad imitation of his own style. He looked at his reflection in the dark screen of his laptop, searching for something, anything, out of place. His face seemed‚Ä¶ normal. Too normal, perhaps, lacking the familiar lines of fatigue and the slightly haunted look that usually resided there.

Then came the comments on his story, echoing the growing disquiet in his own life.

* ""Dude, this feels so real. Like, uncomfortably real.""
* ""Are you okay, Mark? This one feels... personal. Everything alright?""
* ""Getting serious uncanny valley vibes from this. Like it's happening to me. Anyone else?""

He dismissed them as readers getting caught up in the fiction, their imaginations running wild. But the feeling persisted. The feeling of being slightly off-key in his own life, a performance where he'd forgotten his lines.

He started avoiding mirrors. The brief, involuntary glimpses were enough to send a jolt of adrenaline through him. He caught sight of himself in a shop window and felt a strange sense of detachment, as if the person looking back wasn't quite him.

One evening, the compulsion became too strong. He stood in his bathroom, the harsh fluorescent light buzzing overhead, and stared at his reflection. He brushed his teeth, his movements precise, deliberate. He finished, rinsed, and then, just as he was about to turn away, he saw it. The reflection in the mirror didn't move immediately when he did. There was a fractional delay, a tiny, almost imperceptible lag, like a poorly synced video feed.

His blood ran cold. He moved his hand; the reflection followed, a beat late. He smiled, a forced, trembling smile that felt alien on his lips. The reflection's smile bloomed a moment later, wider, colder, showing just a little too much tooth, a predatory glint in the eyes that mirrored his own.

He stumbled back, heart hammering against his ribs, the toothpaste foam forgotten on his chin. He looked again, blinking rapidly. The reflection was perfectly synchronized now, his own terrified face staring back, eyes wide with a dawning horror. He must be exhausted. Hallucinating. The stress was getting to him.

He splashed cold water on his face, trying to clear his head. He told himself it was nothing, a trick of the light, a tired mind playing games. He went to bed, but sleep wouldn't come. He lay there, rigid under the covers, listening to the sounds of his apartment. The familiar creaks and groans of an old building settling for the night. But tonight, they sounded different. Deliberate. Footsteps overhead where there should be none. A faint scratching sound from within the walls.

He heard a floorboard creak just outside his bedroom door. He froze, every muscle tensed. He lived alone. There was no one else in the apartment.

Another creak, closer this time. Then another, slow and measured, moving towards his door.

He held his breath, straining his ears, the sound of his own heartbeat deafening in the silence. The doorknob began to turn, slowly, silently, the metal groaning softly in protest.

Panic seized him, a cold, suffocating wave. He scrambled out of bed, fumbling for his phone on the nightstand. He had to call someone. The police. A friend. Anyone.

The door opened a crack, revealing a sliver of impenetrable darkness.

He saw it then. Just a sliver of a face in the gap. It was his face, undeniably his. But the eyes weren't his. They were too bright, too empty, devoid of any warmth or recognition, like polished glass.

He backed away until his back hit the cold wall, the phone slipping from his trembling fingers to clatter on the floor. The door opened fully, revealing the figure standing there. It was him, wearing his pajamas, his messy hair, his face.

The figure raised a hand, his hand, and waved slowly, a chillingly casual gesture.

Then, it smiled.

And Mark Thorne saw his own teeth smiling back at him from the face of the thing that had taken his place. The feedback loop was complete. He had written his own nightmare into existence, and now, it was time for the sequel, a terrifying reality he was trapped in, with no escape, no audience, just the chilling knowledge that the man who wore his face was now living his life.",1,1747459359.0,scarystories,1,1.0,False

It‚Äôs usually just enough for all of us since we have like 10 staff that works daily. As we don‚Äôt really take our breaks at a specific time, we just leave the food in the breakroom for everyone to have on their breaks. 

Today we had a pizza party that had about 16 slices of medium pizza for 10 people to share. We also had a cake and some veggie platter. I was one of the first people to have their lunch so, as a sane person, I took a slice of cake and a pizza. I kinda wanted more but I‚Äôd rather have whatever‚Äôs left at the end of my shift. 


This one coworker though, he eats so much to the point that he doesn‚Äôt really care who hasn‚Äôt eaten yet.  He was probably the fourth person to have their lunch. Assuming 6 people haven‚Äôt had their lunch yet, you‚Äôd leave enough for them to share, right? Wrong. He ate one box leaving about 4 slices for 6 people. Not only that, he had 3/4 of a cake. We were really shocked that he could eat so much. This isn‚Äôt the first time that this happened so we all know that it‚Äôs him who did this. The rest of the staff didn‚Äôt really want to make this a big deal so they settled with veggie platter and some skipped the pizza. 

How do I tell this person that what he‚Äôs doing is wrong without being rude, or in a way that we were watching how much he eats?

I know everyone‚Äôs mentioning about how little the budget is and I totally agree. We have days where we get a lot of lunch money and that often leaves some leftovers. Today was just a coffee and muffin kind of day but everyone suggested a pizza/sweets so we did that. We see it as a little treat than a feast, so everyone expected to have atleast one slice.

**AITAH for telling my niece that the family does not like her fiance and that I won't be at her wedding?**



So for context there is a 21 year age gap between myself and my eldest brother. This made it so me (28 F) and his oldest daughter (23 F) are very close in age and have grown up very close.

I am very much the favorite aunt and have always considered us friends not just family. She comes to me when she has a problem she didn't want to talk to her parents about. She tells me about her boyfriend and friend problems. She would call me when she was in college and needed picked up from a party or bar. And I was the first person she told when her boyfriend proposed calling me at 6 am the morning after because she was so excited to tell me.

Some context on her fiance, they have been together for 3 years and he is one year younger than her. She just graduated college in May 2024 and he is on track to graduate in May of 2025. They have their wedding scheduled for just a week after his graduation He is studying biochemical and micro engineering and is very smart, more on the introverted side with a dry humor. Since she introduced him to the family we could tell they are serious and tried to be as welcoming as possible inviting him to family events and on trips, getting him birthday and Christmas presents and genuinely trying to get to know him. Whenever he is around our family he acts annoyed all the time like its painful to spend time with us, and he expects my niece to stay by his side the whole function getting annoyed if any of the little cousins ask her to play including my children (more context my niece is my children's godmother) and expects her to leave at the same time as him even if they drove separately. My eldest brother is constantly advocating for him saying he's just introverted and the size of our family makes him uncomfortable insisting that he's different when it's smaller groups or one on one but I haven't seen it even when it was just the two of them with myself and my husband. He talks to everyone like we are stupid and is extremely condescending.

When they got engaged things got worse. With how close we are I was expecting to be asked to be apart of the wedding party but she did not ask me. I was a little hurt but I chose to let it go because it's her special day and her choice. Then his family planned the engagement party and didn't invite any of my family. She explained that it was just a small affair (just their parents and siblings) but I later found out she lied to me when I saw pictures on social media. I did confront her about that but she said she didn't plan the guest list so I tried to let that go too. Then she didn't invite myself or my mom to her dress outing saying it was a limited number of people allowed and she wanted to make sure his mom and sisters could come with her. After that I told her that it really seemed like she was trading our family for his family. She said she wasn't but when I asked them later how they planned to spend holidays he said they'd spend them with his family.

My last straw was over December and January. In December she invited me and my husband for dinner. I was excited because she hadn't initiated us hanging out since her engagement. Dinner was nice a little awkward since conversation wasn't smooth with her fiance but pleasant enough. When the check came my husband took care of it after it sat on the table for about 15 minutes and they didn't offer to split or pay even though they invited us. Then when we were ready to go they asked if we could have a serious conversation. I was confused as to why we didn't have it during the meal but they proceeded to ask us for money to pay for their wedding. She said it was turning out to be more expensive then they thought and needed help since their parents don't make enough. I asked why they didn't wait until he was working and not just in an unpaid internship or until she got a full time job instead of a part time job. I said that I wasn't saying no but that I just wanted to understand why they wanted to have their wedding so fast (the wedding is about 8 months after their engagement). That conversation devolved into an argument about financial responsibility where her fiance said if we can help then we should because its family. And then following up with us having plenty of time to resave when my husband explained a lot of our money was invested for our childrens future. After we offered 2g as a little something to help, my niece brought up my savings from my deceased husband's life insurance. I asked if she really thought bringing up my deceased husband was going to help her. We then repeated our offer of 2g and he asked if that was really all we'd give them so we withdrew the offer. We left enraged.

Then before Christmas my mom invited them over to bake because the fiance enjoys baking desserts and bread. He was so rude to her throughout that she came over for some grandkid time and tea because she was so sad. My dad was pissed. And then neither my niece or fiance came to Christmas. We had a family get together around new years and when we were driving two of my brothers and their wives home we had a conversation about how sick everyone was of the fiance and how we wished they weren't getting married.

Finally in January it was my parents 50th wedding anniversary I planned a party for them and then we were going to Mexico which was group financed by myself and my siblings for our parents. Fiance was only coming to party as he couldnt miss school for mexico. The party was fancy, rsvp invitations, private venue, catered, semi-formal dress code. A week before my niece text me and let me know fiance wasn't going to come to the party because of a fraternity event. I told her that this was an important family event and on top of that it was rude to skip out on an event that you've rsvped for without a good reason and made it clear that I didn't consider his fraternity a good reason considering how long he's known about the event. She said she'd talk to him but I never heard back so I was unsure if he was going to come.

Day of he showed up late wearing a t-shirt, jeans, and backward cap. My mom still trying to be nice said she was glad he was there and he responded ""like I had a choice"". He then stayed in his seat not speaking to the people at his table or participating in the activities. About half way through we were taking a family picture and invited him to be in it and he said ""this isn't my family"". My mom started crying and excused herself to the bathroom. I pulled him aside and snapped I told him that if he didn't want to be in this family to get the f- out. That I was tired of dealing with his attitude and disrespect, and pretending to like him and told him to leave. When my niece went to follow him I told her that if she went with him that she should forget coming to Mexico with us. She didn't follow him but she made it clear that she was upset that he'd been kicked out. The adults in the family (about 12 of us) sat down with her to air out our grievances about the fiance with her so that she understood the extent of the problem, but she still defended him said that we just didn't know him as well and that we made him uncomfortable.

After that conversation I told my husband that I just couldn't act like nothing was wrong anymore. So we declined on the RSVP to the wedding. She text me asking why we said no and I met her for coffee. I explained to her that I didn't feel that I could support her marriage that he wasn't a good person and I felt like her independence and everything that was special about her was disappearing behind his expectations. She disagreed and told me that I just didn't understand. She then told me that if I really cared about her that I should suck it up and come to her wedding.

So AITAH? Should we go to the wedding? And was I wrong for telling her in the first place?

UPDATE: My niece was raised in a christian household and she chose to maintain her faith while in college when she did live independently (on scholarship and student subsidized housing with one roommate away from parents for four years) and from what I understand her fiance is too. They dont live together and they dont do overnights by their choice. She has returned to living with her parents because she is broke and unmotivated and he lives in a frat house. Her parents also expect her to follow their rules including a curfew while living at home in respect for the routine that's been established for her special needs sister. So while I agree with the assessment that he's setting her up to be isolated they aren't currently in a situation or the privacy for financial or emotional abuse. I do also think he's a narcissist. She agreed to sit down and talk with me again and I was able to better articulate my concerns for her future and what she is setting herself up for, and my concerns about him.

We are still not going to the wedding. I explained to her that part of it is because I love her. That ultimately it's supposed to be a special day for her and that with the way I feel about him that I would object to the union in front of everyone as opposed to privately. I told her that whatever she chooses that I am always specifically in her corner and that I hope that she will still want to spend time with me and my kids but more than that to know that she can come to me anytime for anything. And that for her sake I do hope that I'm wrong about him. We did get her a few things off the registry that I knew were more for her than for him. She said she would think about everything so we will see what happens between now and then.

And to the person who said they thought I didn't think it through on what this might mean for the future I can assure you I did. My family means the world to me and I don't want to hurt her or my relationship with her but we got to the point where I couldn't stay quiet and pretend like there wasn't anything wrong. Thanks to everyone for the input it really helped me organize my thoughts and think through everything that's happened.

*NTA, but i don't think you are seeing things clearly. The guy made her own grandma cry and she defends him. You all act as if he is the problem here. But SHE is choosing him, she is defending him. He is that way because she allows it to be. He made her grandma cry and she still said you were all in the wrong. She is not some silly child blinded by love. She sees what he does, but still chooses him when he so blantantly disrespects all of you. She is the AH here. (Well the fianc√© too, ofc, but it wouldn't matter if she was not choosing him). Stop believing she is just some misguided child. She's an adult and making very clear choices.*

**Update - 3 months later**



So I honestly wasn't sure if I was going to have anything else to update after my husband and I decided not to go to the wedding, and figured if I did have more to update it wouldn't be until after the wedding. But holy hell was I wrong. I figured I'd share since so many people were invested and gave great advice when I needed it before.

So first off my daughter and I ended up going to the bridal shower at the end of April. My niece asked me repeatedly to come and I figured that things would be relatively drama free since the fianc√© doesn't get to come to that. I asked in advance if she was sure she wanted my daughter to come since she is under 10. I was assured that there would be other children there and that my niece really wanted her goddaughter there. Skip to day of and my daughter was the only child. One of my SIL even told me she was told not to bring her 3 daughters (one older and two younger than my daughter). The maternal aunt kept scolding my daughter for ""touching things"" even though I was keeping an eye on her and she did no such thing. The mother of the groom asked if I was purposely trying ruin the event and the grooms sister said it was rude of me to bring her. I was ready to just walk out but the bride's 19 year old sister took my daughter to play in her room upstairs. My other niece that took her upstairs has special needs and had said she was feeling overstimulated, but the bride was still upset that she didnt stay downstairs for the whole event. The bride never even said hi to my daughter making her feel very sad when we went home. We played those how well do you know the bride games which I won prompting my niece to say that I was ""basically her best friend"" causing an awkward silence as the room became confused as to why I wasn't in her wedding party. Extra special surprise for me when I found out that all the grooms sisters are in her bridal party but her ""best friend"" and her own sister are not ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

About a week later we got together to celebrate my dad's birthday. When my mom invited them the fianc√© responded ""if I don't have anything better to do then I might come."" My mom didn't hear anything else so assumed he wasn't coming and when he showed up she had to set a place for him prompting him to play victim saying we don't want him around. He then had to be asked to put his phone away at the table while we were all eating and no one else had their phones with them.

The final straw for my parents was two-fold. They asked about the rehearsal dinner because you'd think the grandparents of the bride would be invited. They were told it was wedding party only (which basically includes the grooms whole family). I later found out through other people that the grooms grandparents were going to the rehearsal dinner because they came from out of state and wanted as much time with the grandkids as they could get. I kept that tidbit to myself because I didn't want my parents to be more hurt than they were already feeling. They then had the audacity to ask my parents to hang out with the brides sister since she doesn't do well staying at home alone and they would all be busy at the dinner.

The second thing was that the bride asked my mom what she'd be wearing to the wedding specifically asking if she was going to be buying a new dress. My mom said that she wasn't buying something new because she already had a nice dress. My niece responded that my mom dresses old fashion and frumpy and that she didn't think anything she already had would be appropriate for the wedding. (My mom is very stylish for her age (mid 70s) and the dress she had picked out was gorgeous). My mom told her that she was being rude but that she would give her the benefit of the doubt because planning a wedding was stressful and sent her a picture of the dress. She then told my niece that she had gotten it for her best friend's daughters wedding and had only ever worn it that once so my niece hadn't seen it before. My niece responded ""I guess it's ok"". My mom felt very defeated and my dad had had enough. He responded on their behalf with ""from our various interactions it does not seem that you want us to be participants in your special day. Your grandmother and I will no longer be attending your wedding."" They returned their wedding gifts. My husband and I decided to do the same

Now from my side of the family the only ones that are going are two of my five siblings. One because it's his daughter, and one because his wife is playing the guitar during the ceremony and he did not want her going alone. She does piano or acoustic guitar accompaniment for special events professionally and she had committed before the bulk of the drama happened and did not want to harm her professional reputation by backing out last minute. That brother has let everyone know that they will not be staying past the ceremony, that his kids are hanging out with grammy and gramps, and that he is going full petty by wearing jeans, t-shirt, and hat just like the fianc√© did to our parents 50th anniversary celebration.

That's all I've got for now and idk what else could happen at this point but I'll keep you updated. (Wedding is 1 week away!)

*I‚Äôm sorry, but your niece is not a good person. Her fianc√© is the worst, but she‚Äôs right there with him with the way she has been treating you and your family. Unless there are some missing reasons that you haven‚Äôt shared with us, she sounds like she‚Äôs as big of a jerk as he is.*

**Avalon\_Angel525**

*Her fiance made her grandmother cry, and she still defended him. Seriously, that right there would have been the straw that not only broke the camel's back, it also broke all four legs and the concrete beneath it.*

**plantprinses**

*Wow! What a way to start your life together by alienating your own family! From the looks of it, they deserve each other. It's really good to read that you don't let the bride walk all over you just because she's getting married.*

>OOP: So to address a few things I've noticed popping up:

the reason the fianc√© was invited to family dinner was my mom. We (her children) have asked her to stop inviting him to things because he always inevitably ruins the atmosphere but she is a part of the generation where family always gets another chance and you do everything to keep the peace. We are slowly but surely helping her to establish and keep healthy boundaries but she was also holding onto hope that she would be gaining a grandson and not be loosing a granddaughter.

My niece is absolutely contributing to the problem. She did not use to be this way. As I've said before we were good friends, she's the godmother to my kids and was in both my weddings. I noticed her becoming more self centered as she gained independence in college. I hoped it would get better but it's gotten worse contributed to by the dipshit and his family. I'm trying to find the balance in letting her know I love her and that if she's in trouble or needs help that we are here, but that her current attitude and actions are unacceptable and unsupported.

Sometimes she does acknowledge that he's rude but also has a excuse lined up like school stress, internship work load, bad day sort of stuff. Always comes back to he's a good guy and we just don't know him well enough.

I think my brother is in denial and doesn't want to admit that his daughter is getting into a bad thing. He's full of all the excuses too i.e. introverted, not comfortable with large groups, stressed, tired, smart to the detriment of social skills we've heard it all. Kind of hard to ignore when your whole family decides not to show up to the wedding though so maybe it'll kick some sense into him. He was very angry when I sent him screen shots of the texts between his daughter and our mom though so I'll give him props for that one.

Thermostat temperature: 97.4C (this is very stable after warming up for 20 minutes: +/- 0.1C!)

Roast: Dark

Coffee Scale: Maestri House 
Mass of coffee grounds for double shot basket: 15.5g.

The other gauge I‚Äôve used is a 2mm gap between the tamped grounds and the group head. Once you‚Äôve used the basket a few times you‚Äôll see the line to measure from.

Tamper: USEAMI Coffee Tamper 58mm.

After grinding I rest the tamper on the grounds. The friction from the tamper weight is enough to rotate and distribute and level the grounds. I didn‚Äôt want to buy one more tool to add to my routine. Plus, I don‚Äôt think the light tamp (350g) causes an issue before the main tamp.

Next, I time the shot for 25 seconds. This usually yields 30-40mL with a temperature drop of 2-3C. Watching the temperature is another way to monitor the shot quality. If it drops too much then you know the espresso flow rate is too high and you have channeling. 

This setup is consistent! I tried temperature surfing without a scale for a few weeks. I really hoped I could hone
in a process with consistent results through trial and error.  I mean, people do it all the time! I think without a PID controlled thermostat I was in the dark. The PID (knowing the temperature) was the light in the dark in my experience.

My ideal lover would be a guy who is not in a hurry to get laid, loves literature and books, and is polite.

My sister says that such men are extinct in the 21st century. She accused me of always daydreaming about nerd stuff, which is why I still haven‚Äôt cashed in my v-card.

I mean, why should I? I've never been in love before. I‚Äôm just waiting for something more intimate.

But I'm living in a fairy tale now that Daniel has shown up. We've been dating for a few months now after falling in love at first sight at a bookstore.

He's thoughtful and attentive and a good listener, which is often the role I play - after all, my specialty is counseling. He doesn‚Äôt try to push me to go too far too fast, which sets him apart from other guys and suits my own pace perfectly.

Today, in the bookstore where we first met, I take a sip of my cappuccino as I look over my boyfriend‚Äôs tall, lanky form, his curly chestnut hair falling into his green eyes. Daniel always dresses so nicely, today in perfectly-pressed grey pants, a shining silver watch at his wrist.

Wait, I think, narrowing my eyes and looking closer. Are those diamonds below the glass face?

I bite my lip, wondering why my boyfriend has a diamond watch. I mean, I‚Äôm just a broke grad student ‚Äì is he rich?

There‚Äôs movement over Daniel‚Äôs shoulder, and as I look, my eyes go wide. ‚ÄúDaniel, there‚Äôs‚Ä¶a guy over there. And he‚Äôs staring right at us.‚Äù

Daniel turns to look directly at the brawny guy, well over six feet and chorded with muscle. His professional suit does nothing to disguise the roughness of his hands, the cruel scar that runs diagonally over his face, almost splitting his nose in two.

‚ÄúOh, um,‚Äù Daniel says, shrugging. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about him.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about him!?‚Äù I whisper, a little scared. ‚ÄúDaniel, he‚Äôs looking right at ‚Äì‚Äú

‚ÄúNo, I mean, he‚Äôs with me.‚Äù Daniel gives me an apologetic smile as my mouth falls open in shock. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Parker, he‚Äôs‚Ä¶well. He‚Äôs kind of my body guard.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù I say, pulling my mouth shut into an awkward O. I stare at Daniel. He needs a bodyguard? How rich is he?

‚ÄúYeah, just ignore him,‚Äù Daniel says, giving me a cool smile. ‚ÄúMy dad gets overprotective,‚Äù he rolls his eyes at this. ‚ÄúHonestly, he‚Äôs so stressed out about safety that he could use a shrink like you to give him some counseling.‚Äù Daniel laughs at this, lightening the mood.

‚ÄúAnytime,‚Äù I mutter, nervously playing with my long red hair, worrying about the mismatch between Daniel‚Äôs wealth and my church-mouse status. I‚Äôve never met anyone before who has a bodyguard.

‚ÄúCan I get you anything else?‚Äù Both Daniel and I look up at the baristo who smiles down at us, a really handsome blonde-haired guy who has an apron tied around his waist.

‚ÄúNo thanks, Colin,‚Äù I say, giving him a big grin.

‚ÄúActually, can we both get refills?‚Äù Daniel says, giving Colin a slow smile.

‚ÄúOh, actually‚Ä¶‚Äú I say, looking up at the clock and pushing my hair back behind my ears. If I don‚Äôt leave now, I‚Äôm definitely going to be late for my job doing psych evaluations at the state prison.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôll take hers to go then,‚Äù Daniel says, rising from our sofa. ‚ÄúHere, I‚Äôll help you.‚Äù He follows Colin back to the coffee counter.

I start to pack up my bag, intent on catching the next trolly, when I notice Daniel‚Äôs phone vibrating on the table, a call coming in. When the number disappears, Daniel‚Äôs home screen shows a family photo. The tall man in the back is certainly his dad, the other maybe an older brother?

As I try to puzzle it out, the phone rings again ‚Äì the same number. On impulse, I grab Daniel‚Äôs phone and sling my packed bag over my shoulder, heading towards the coffee counter.

‚ÄúDaniel,‚Äù I say, slipping behind the counter, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre getting a phone call ‚Äì‚Äú

But there‚Äôs no one back here. I look around, confused ‚Äì I definitely just saw Colin and Daniel head this way‚Ä¶

I hear a noise from the storage room, a strange and muffled thump and a moan. I take two steps forward and peek around the door, maybe they both ‚Äì

Oh my god. Not two feet from me, my boyfriend presses Colin up against the wall of the storage room, one fist wrapped in the fabric of his shirt ‚Äì kissing him passionately -

Colin‚Äôs eyes are closed, his hands fumbling at the button of Daniel‚Äôs pants, his belt already undone, whispering his name ‚Äì my boyfriend‚Äôs name ‚Äì

‚ÄúAre you kidding me!?‚Äù I yell, not even thinking as I hurl the phone at Daniel and his lover.

Both boys jump, leaping apart. ‚ÄúFay ‚Äì I ‚Äì ‚Äú Daniel‚Äôs face is full of shock. Tears in my eyes, I run from the room and from the coffee shop.

‚ÄúFay!‚Äù Daniel spills out onto the street behind me. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand!‚Äù He grabs my arm, pulling me back to him.

‚ÄúI really like you,‚Äù he says, his eyes filled with apology. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre amazing - it‚Äôs just that my family wouldn‚Äôt understand, wouldn‚Äôt approve ‚Äì‚Äú

‚ÄúSo what,‚Äù I asked, surprised. ‚ÄúYou just want me to be your pretend girlfriend!? Sorry,‚Äù I rip my arm from his hand. ‚ÄúNot interested.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease, Fay!‚Äù Daniel calls after me as I run away. ‚ÄúPlease ‚Äì I can make this right! How much do you want? One million? Three million? I can-"" I see him pull the checkbook out of his pocket.

""I don't want your money!"" I say, my voice mocking. Daniel blinks and I turn away. ""I‚Äôll keep your secret, you don‚Äôt need to pay me off. I just don't want to see you again.""

And just like that, my fairy tale with Prince Charming was over.

I hurry down the street, my eyes filling with angry tears.

Two hours later, I‚Äôm seated at a plastic table in a cinder-block cell, my eyes dried up and my hair tied back in what I hope is a professional look. My leg jitters with nerves and, I think, a little bit of aftershock. I still can‚Äôt believe what Daniel did to me.

But I straighten up in my seat, taking a deep breath. I have to concentrate on my job now, and I‚Äôm incredibly nervous about my next assignment.

I‚Äôve only been assigned basic white-collar criminals thus far, but today I have to make an assessment of Kent Lippert, the man known as our city‚Äôs Mafia King. His unmatched cruelty and the unbelievable lengths he takes to protect his power are infamous in this town.

I hear the hallway door clang open and stand up from my chair, pressing my hands against my blazer to straighten it. This is the most nervous I‚Äôve been since I started this gig.

The guards bring Lippert around the corner and I‚Äôm surprised ‚Äì I expected Lippert to be a fat, old, balding man ‚Äì the kind of greasy lowlife who belongs in our city‚Äôs underworld.

But this man is trim and tall, moving with a kind of dangerous grace. My eyes follow the way his shoulders shift beneath the fabric of his uniform, the way that the guards quail, a little, as they unlock the cuffs on his hands.

I gasp as my eyes finally fall on Lippert‚Äôs face, my mouth going dry. His dark hair falling over his forehead, his square jaw, the deep frown lines etched over green eyes ‚Äì oh my god. I‚Äôve seen this man before. I saw him today, in a picture on my boyfriend‚Äôs phone ‚Äì

And again, younger, etched in the features of my boyfriend‚Äôs own face.

Daniel isn‚Äôt just some rich kid. He‚Äôs the son of the Mafia King.

# Chapter 2

Kent leans his shoulder against the bars of his cell, his well-muscled arms crossed against his chest.

What was he doing in this local prison, created to catch the overflow of the city‚Äôs rampant gangs? He was their king, after all.

And to think, Kent was here by choice.

His lip raises in derision as he shakes his head, wondering if he made the right decision, intentionally getting caught so he could get in here, just for the chance to talk to the warden.

Two blue-uniformed guards walk down the row towards him. ‚ÄúLippert?‚Äù They ask. ‚ÄúWarden wants to see you.‚Äù They cuff him and take him to the warden‚Äôs office.

Kent sits down on a chair in front of him, wordless, waiting for the guards to leave.

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù Sven says, closing his file. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm surprised you had the balls to come to my turn for a negotiation, Lippert. It‚Äôs brave.‚Äù

The public didn‚Äôt know it, but Warden Sven not only runs this prison, but leverages his control over it to take a significant stake in the workings of the city‚Äôs underworld. He is as dirty as the rest of them, and if other bosses go against him? He locks them up.

Quite a trump card in this world where one of the only things that stops a gangster is a stay in prison.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be out soon enough,‚Äù Kent responds, leaning back in his chair. ‚ÄúWe have to talk about Ivan.‚Äù

‚ÄúIvan?‚Äù Sven looks at him closely. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs chicken shit.‚Äù

Kent shakes his head slowly. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just a kid, but he‚Äôs getting a foot in the heroin game. But because he‚Äôs green he doesn‚Äôt have the grit or the resources to handle it.‚Äù He pauses a moment, taking Sven in.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs getting backed into a corner,‚Äù Kent continues, ‚Äúand it‚Äôs making him ruthless. He‚Äôs not coming to meetings of the families, he‚Äôs killing at will ‚Äì made men, as well as wise guys. He has to be stopped, Sven. Or he‚Äôs going to wreck it for all of us.‚Äù

Sven leans back into his chair, considering.

Kent steels himself, staring Sven down. Antony, his cousin and second-in-command, had told him it was foolish to lock himself up for months just for the chance to talk to Sven. But Kent had a gut feeling this was the right call. An alliance with Sven against Ivan was going to pay off. Big time.

‚ÄúI see your point,‚Äù Sven says, breathing out through his nose. ‚ÄúIvan‚Äôs too big for his britches, eh? It‚Äôs a delicate ecosystem,‚Äù he says, holding his hands out like a set of scales to demonstrate the balance. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve all got to play our parts. If he pushes too far, he destroys it for all of us.‚Äù

Sven nods, considering his next words before continuing. ‚ÄúI have to admit, Lippert, I‚Äôm impressed with your persistence in this matter. I‚Äôve done good work isolating myself, protecting myself, but you found a way in. Not everyone would come to my turf, and stay so long, just for a meeting with me. I respect that. You‚Äôre a real capo, a good guy. I‚Äôm glad that I know this.‚Äù

Kent nods, silently confirming this read of him. That‚Äôs exactly how he wanted Sven to feel. ‚ÄúIvan‚Äôs a mad dog,‚Äù Kent says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to put him down. I‚Äôll provide the muscle; all I ask is that you let us. Don‚Äôt interfere. As for the spoils‚Ä¶we split fifty-fifty.‚Äù

Sven eyes him, considering. ‚ÄúI want eighty-twenty, for my agreement to let you handle it.‚Äù

Kent doesn‚Äôt let his frustration show. He doesn‚Äôt care if Sven takes it all, honestly ‚Äì Sven has power, but he‚Äôs notoriously low on cash, a problem Kent doesn‚Äôt have. But he can‚Äôt let himself be bowled over. ‚ÄúSixty-forty,‚Äù he says, stern.

Sven shrugs, not agreeing yet, but not pushing the matter further. ‚ÄúWhat about the other bosses?‚Äù he asks. ‚ÄúAre you anticipating pushback from Alden?‚Äù

Kent shakes his head quickly. ‚ÄúAlden‚Äôs distracted. His guys are running the game, but he‚Äôs got some new clue about his lost kid.‚Äù He waves a hand, dismissing it. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not going to take a side.‚Äù

Sven nods, giving him a small smile, and Kent realizes that Sven already knew this. Sven might not have cash, but he does trade in secrets. Likely, Alden got the clue from him to begin with. Kent narrows his eyes, realizing that question was a test.

He doesn‚Äôt like being tested. ‚ÄúDo we have a deal?‚Äù

Sven shrugs, again noncommittal. He turns in his chair to stare at a calendar on his wall, the picture of a beautiful vineyard somewhere in Europe. ‚ÄúYou know, I had a lovely glass of wine the other day. From Napa. But I gotta tell you, Lippert,‚Äù he turns here, looking Kent directly in the eye. ‚ÄúIt left me a little parched, a little‚Ä¶too dry.‚Äù

Sven‚Äôs lips start to lift in a cold smirk. ‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt happen to know‚Ä¶anywhere else. Where a man could get a finer glass of wine. A really good drink. Would you?‚Äù

Kent flicks his eyes to the calendar again, realizing suddenly that the picture on the wall is a picture of his vineyard, the calendar likely produced as a promotional gift for tourists. Sven knew exactly what Kent would ask even before he set foot in the room, and he knew exactly the price of his cooperation.

‚ÄúFrance,‚Äù Kent says slowly, narrowing his eyes and staring at Sven. Perhaps not such a clean alliance after all. ‚ÄúThe best wine in the world comes from France.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know, I‚Äôd like to try that wine,‚Äù Sven says, turning back to the picture, all innocence. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to get a foot in the industry too. Maybe get some property there, some day.‚Äù

‚ÄúDone.‚Äù Kent said. It‚Äôs worth the price.

A good meeting. Kent leaves satisfied.

As they walk down the hall, one of the guards turns to him. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been ordered to take you along to your psychological assessment before returning you to your cell,‚Äù he informs him. Kent glares at him, but says nothing.

The guard shrugs. ‚ÄúStandard procedure, Lippert. All prisoners gotta do it.‚Äù

Kent stays silent, following. Sven is pushing it, making him undergo psychological testing, when he‚Äôd be out of here tomorrow. He‚Äôs just trying to collect more secrets.

Kent follows the guards to a cinder-block cell at the end of the hallway, noting that his lawyer is standing outside the door. The lawyer rolls his eyes to Kent and points at his watch, indicating that he‚Äôll have him out of here in no time. Kent nods, and then focuses his attention on the door.

He‚Äôs surprised, when it opens, to see a girl inside.

Not a girl, perhaps, a young woman ‚Äì twenty-three, at the most. She stands up, clearly anxious, biting her lip and playing with the long red ponytail that drifts over her shoulder. Her mouth falls open, just slightly, as she takes him in.

God damnit, Kent thinks, his whole body going tense at the sight of her ‚Äì those long legs, knocked at the knees with anxiety, her short white skirt, that ridiculous blazer that she wears so people like him will take her seriously.

He can tell from a single glance that she‚Äôs pure as the driven snow ‚Äì ambitious but poor, eager to prove herself. His eyes rove over her, considering what she‚Äôd look like if he ripped that blazer off of her. He focuses, again, on those red lips, slightly parted.

His breath hisses from his mouth at the sight of those lips, at the thought of what he could do with them.

‚ÄúUm,‚Äù she says, hesitant.

He snaps his attention back to her jewel-blue eyes.

‚ÄúMy name is Fay Thompson? I‚Äôm here to do your preliminary interview for state psychological assessment?‚Äù

Kent grits his teeth, denying his urge to smile slowly at the fact that her statements are presented as questions. God, she‚Äôs perfect, this little angel. The feral, leashed part of him wants to know what she‚Äôd look like with a little bit of the underworld‚Äôs grime smeared all over her.

‚ÄúHello, Fay,‚Äù he says, his voice low and hungry as he moves forward and settles into his chair. ‚ÄúWhere do we begin?‚Äù",1,1747458112.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

So they‚Äôve been together just over three years. 
Every time we hang out, he calls her at least half a dozen times. They live together and talk about marriage etc so it‚Äôs definitely a serious relationship.. but he‚Äôs constantly checking in to ask where she is, what she‚Äôs up to, when she‚Äôs gonna be home etc. If we go out for food - he calls her (he has her location) asking her if she can get him something to bring home. But like.. it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre JUST getting food. It‚Äôs usually coffee/food then hiking/shopping. But it feels like he‚Äôs trying to find a reason for her to come home early?? The only time he‚Äôs not calling her is when he‚Äôs sleeping because he works odd shifts. 
Every time he calls her he does ask her when she‚Äôs gonna be back because he misses her and typically she says something like ‚Äúsoon‚Äù and then we continue on with our time until he calls again. I know it annoys her a little.. she‚Äôs said so herself. He used to try to tag along with our friend dates and I got tired of becoming the third wheel on the occasion that her and I planned and she got tired of him not having or trying to make his own friends. I can‚Äôt explain how manipulative it feels to me when he does these things. 
Recently, we went out for dinner and then came back to my house and watched a movie. He called her that night probably five times. During the movie, she fell asleep on my couch so I texted him letting him know she was safe but fell asleep and I didn‚Äôt want to wake her up. His reply was - ‚ÄúThanks, can you send her home in 30?‚Äù Like bro.. you live three blocks from here. She‚Äôs sleeping. She‚Äôs not in danger. 
Then tonight we had a plan - dinner, shopping, walking and then she would grab him food before heading home. Which of course, he called WHILE we are sitting in the restaurant and asks for her to get him something before we leave. She was like ‚ÄúI‚Äôll pick it up on the way home.‚Äù He says ‚ÄúNo no just get it now.‚Äù So we ate, got his food and went on to the errands and shopping. Before we got to the walking part (which was HER idea because we skipped it last time) he calls to remind her he‚Äôs hungry and waiting for his food because he has work in a couple hours and wants to sleep‚Ä¶ so what don‚Äôt we do? The walking. Suddenly she says ‚ÄúOh I‚Äôm so tired all of the sudden.‚Äù I asked if she wanted to go to the trail, she was talking about it all week. ‚ÄúNo no I actually don‚Äôt want to anymore.‚Äù 
I kinda went off. I don‚Äôt like being that friend, like I don‚Äôt want to be unsupportive of her relationship but he is a stage five clinger and I hate watching him try to run her life. She spends so much money on him that she‚Äôs gone into debt, he hardly contributes to their home and pets AND he can‚Äôt just let her spend a couple hours out of the house without him?? 
I was like ‚ÄúBut you wanted to go walking all week. Are you cancelling now because A can‚Äôt make his own dinner??‚Äù She said no and denied it, but I heard him on the phone asking her when she would be back because of work. We sat awkwardly quiet in the car for a while and then I apologized. We hugged it out and she went home. I could be just sensitive because I had someone similar who would call me every hour asking when I was coming home to him, even if I was just hanging out at my moms place. He would throw a fit if I didn‚Äôt spend all of my time off with him. I will never do that again and do not want that for my best friend. Though her boyfriend seems more like the silent manipulator than a violent one, manipulation is still manipulation.  I know it‚Äôs not really for me to tell her how to live.

The hair showed marks of having been combed in a hasty manner.¬†

‚ÄúIs that your Sunday suit?‚Äù Merulias started teasing at once.

‚ÄúYou might have forgotten that we need an audience and that the church does not look kindly on those using magic even if they stopped persecuting us.‚Äù The Englishman spoke with a warm voice but the familiar seriousness had already infected his bearing from the minute they had talked about the missing angels. Feeling a bit guilty for dragging his friend into this mess, Merulias promised himself to keep their journey short. After all, it shouldn‚Äôt be too difficult to find and stop those responsible with two angels and an occultist.

‚ÄúThey persecuted you, because you summoned demons,‚Äù Michael lectured. A glance at Dean told Merulias that he himself must have had the same expression as his human friend upon hearing the simpleton‚Äôs statement.

‚ÄúWhere have you been?‚Äù They asked in unison, causing the angel to give them yet another moody look. In the blink of an eye the three found themselves in front of the Pope‚Äôs palace.

Nudging the devil with his elbow Dean only asked, ‚ÄúStill want to make the Pope dance a jig?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I would like‚Ä¶‚Äù Both fell silent when Michael cleared his throat audibly and tried to smite them with his eyes. ‚ÄúPerhaps we should do it once Mister Spoil-sport isn‚Äôt around anymore.‚Äù Merulias said, pointing at the angel and rolling his eyes.

‚ÄúWell, you can‚Äôt choose your family,‚Äù Dean retorted, smiling right into Michael‚Äôs face.

‚ÄúOtherwise, there would be no point in making friends.‚Äù A cocky smile spread across the devil‚Äôs face as he adjusted his hat to keep his eyes shaded under Rome‚Äôs setting sun. Strolling forward, Dean approached the Swiss guard at the door. He took a minute to find the right words of the Latin language. At first, he tried to explain that he was expected, but all he got was the gesture refusing him entry. Next, he put emphasis on the fact that it was a dire situation indeed. Still the guard shook his head.

‚ÄúPerhaps we should try your spell‚Ä¶‚Äù Dean proposed to his friend.

‚ÄúEnough of your sinful games,‚Äù Michael thundered, obviously fed up with their way of cheating themselves inside. Going to the guard he looked the man into the eyes.

‚ÄúBe not afraid, dear child. For the Lord has need of your service.‚Äù The two friends were astonished about the sudden gentleness in the angel‚Äôs voice. A faint, silvery light started to surround Michael, resulting in the man gasping and then quickly avoiding his eyes in a manner of respect. Going down on one knee he let them pass.

‚ÄúWell done, brother,‚Äù Merulias commented. ‚ÄúI am sure Father has nothing against you using his name to give us some advantages.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt lie, if that‚Äôs what you mean,‚Äù the angel replied coolly. ‚ÄúFather‚Äôs Will would be for us to save his creations from themselves.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, sure. That must be why he left and never came back.‚Äù

‚ÄúGod, left?‚Äù Dean asked, looking worried at the revelation. Merulias ignored his friend‚Äôs tone and flicked his wrist.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing to worry about, mate. I‚Äôm sure the old man is somewhere around.‚Äù Brushing off another disapproving glare from his brother, the devil remained silent. The Vatican hadn‚Äôt changed even a bit since the last time Merulias and Dean had seen it from the inside. With Michael going on ahead, working his angel magic, the other two had nothing to do but follow.¬†

‚ÄúAm I getting this right?‚Äù Dean whispered to the devil next to him. ‚ÄúThis is Archangel Michael. The one who‚Ä¶‚Äù he motioned at Merulias‚Äô left shoulder where the scar was hidden by the mortal appearance.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he answered his friend‚Äôs unuttered question smoothly, keeping the golden-hazel eyes on the path in front of them.

‚ÄúWhy did he ask for your help?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs desperate. Heaven must be in grave danger otherwise he wouldn‚Äôt have come to me.‚Äù Merulias kept his voice even and calm as he spoke, revealing nothing about his feelings towards his brother.

‚ÄúDo you trust him?‚Äù A long silence followed until the fallen angel managed to answer.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. The burned bridges are as much my fault as they are his. He is still my brother‚Ä¶‚Äù Merulias trailed off, unable to find the answer.

‚ÄúWe are looking for a Father Johnson,‚Äù Michael asked an old cardinal with white hair. The robed man studied them for a moment, the eyes showing confusion and awe.¬†‚ÄúWe are under the impression that he lives in Rome,‚Äù the angel added, still maintaining his soft tone.¬†

‚ÄúJohnson,‚Äù the cardinal echoed thoughtfully. ‚ÄúI think he has been excommunicated by the church.‚Äù Merulias wasn‚Äôt mad to find out about the priest‚Äôs downfall.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Dean asked in shock next to him. Not taking his eyes from the angel the cardinal answered.

‚ÄúI am not allowed to tell you that. Nor is Johnson himself.‚Äù

‚ÄúOur visit has different reasons, far above those earthly rules.‚Äù Michael appeased the old man, whose voice had started to quiver a bit.¬†

‚ÄúI heard he has a vineyard, not far from here.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou shall have my thanks,‚Äù the angel spoke before ushering his two companions out of the building.

‚ÄúEasy, brother,‚Äù Merulias muttered, annoyed by the displayed hastiness.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have time to lose, Lucifer.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll have to.‚Äù Merulias countered. ‚ÄúThere are dozens of vineyards in Rome. It will take some time till I find the right one.‚Äù Turning into a raven, the devil spread his wings.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just leave me here,‚Äù Michael quickly countered, it almost sounded like begging.

‚ÄúThere is a caf√©,‚Äù the raven pointed with his beak. ‚ÄúRelax, have a chat with Dean.‚Äù Not waiting for his brother‚Äôs complaints, Merulias disappeared into the sky.¬†

With the silver eyes blazing like pennies reflecting the sunlight, Michael looked ready to burst. After a few minutes of struggling to keep his composure, he followed Merulias‚Äô advice and went to the caf√©. They found an empty table close to the window. Without a word he took the menu. When a waiter came and asked something in Italian, Dean did the only thing he could.

‚ÄúMichael, I don‚Äôt speak Italian.‚Äù

The angel lowered the menu card and regarded his human companion with a bored expression. Getting the feeling of being a disappointment the Englishman looked out the window whilst Michael spoke. When the waiter came back, he carried two cups of coffee.¬†

A sigh from Dean made Michael abandon the menu.¬†

‚ÄúWhat is it,‚Äù the angel asked, less irritated than he had looked.

‚ÄúI just thought a tea would be nice.‚Äù Passing his hand over Dean‚Äôs cup, Michael turned the coffee into tea. Needing time to understand the compassionate gesture, the Englishman looked at the entity sitting opposite of him. Wearing a dark-blue grey suit and a black coat, Dean almost expected the angel to light a cigarette like Merulias tended to do.

‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù he uttered whereupon something like a smile lit up Michael‚Äôs features. ‚ÄúDo you wear suits in heaven?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, we use garments and robes since the beginning.‚Äù Michael answered in a short but warm tone. ‚ÄúLucifer thought it to be better if I looked like a human.‚Äù Putting his arms on the table he leaned forward.

‚ÄúYou know what my brother did, what he is. How is it that you stay?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean because you left him?‚Äù Dean answered, still angered for his friend. He believed to see a hint of guilt in the silver-grey eyes, regretting his roughness when the angel had tried to be friendly. ‚ÄúWe met when we both were on the run from something. I didn‚Äôt know he was the devil until we had been friends for quite some time already.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut he committed atrocities. He fell.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe is still my friend, Michael. He might have been evil incarnate once. But what I witnessed was someone trying to put things right.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo wonder he trusts you more than me. He is very fortunate to have a friend like you.‚Äù Michael spoke in a low voice, staring at his own hands. It made Dean wonder if the angel felt regret for his actions. For the time he could have been with his brother, and which was now lost.¬†

‚ÄúMichael, being an angel of the Lord might be your purpose. But I think Merulias would appreciate some humanity from you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am no human.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you have to be a human in order to be sincere about your feelings.‚Äù A dangerous glint let Michael‚Äôs eyes flame up before he managed to push down his hurt ego.

‚ÄúI might be punished for being friendly towards the devil.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoing what‚Äôs right sometimes requires to break the rules.‚Äù Dean could feel he had gone too far. Had been too honest about his primitive views. As suddenly as the angel‚Äôs emotional side had broken through as suddenly it was gone again. Locked away and guarded by the all-powerful divine entity.

‚ÄúWhat does a human know about divine rules and punishment?‚Äù He said in a pejorative manner. ‚ÄúLucifer *chose* to defy Heaven and his punishment was to be bereft of the divine light for eternity. Why should I feel pity for someone like him?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy indeed?‚Äù Dean smirked, fully aware of having found the angel‚Äôs weak spot. But Michael turned to the window and ceased talking about aethereal matters to a simple human.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Merulias was astonished to see his brother and his friend sitting in a caf√© without having caused any trouble. Perhaps things would be easier than the devil had assumed after all with his brother. The early evening was already yielding to night when the three, led by Merulias, reached a vineyard outside of Rome‚Äôs busy city. Although the fields seemed healthy, the property itself made a somewhat desolate impression. When he knocked at the worn door, the only response were the slurred words of someone who had indulged in too much wine.

‚ÄúGo away!‚Äù Dean looked uncertain, but Merulias knew it was unmistakably the voice of the priest who had hunted him for several years. Pushing through, he simply entered. Inside stood a candle, a wooden table and a chair supporting the old man. Time had not been kind to the father, and upon scanning the place Merulias found it dirty and neglected.¬†

‚ÄúNow I‚Äôm starting to see ghosts of the past‚Ä¶‚Äù Johnson uttered in his stupor. ‚ÄúWhat do you want, Occultist?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm no ghost, Father,‚Äù Dean replied politely. Still trying to clear the fog, Johnson looked around to see Merulias.

‚ÄúAh, your creature from the abyss is back. Where is your slave trading friend?‚Äù He added as he turned back to Dean.

‚ÄúAt least he didn‚Äôt become a drunk after losing everything.‚Äù The Englishman stated in a voice of prideful grief.

‚ÄúWine is all the Good Lord left me with,‚Äù Johnson raised a glass towards them and emptied it.¬†

‚ÄúI am sure the merciful father would like you to find back to your righteous path.‚Äù Michael suddenly spoke encouragingly to the pathetic man. Seeing his brother going closer, probably to spread some love in the priest‚Äôs heart, Merulias stopped him.

‚ÄúBe an angel, brother, do me a favour and shut up.‚Äù The devil grinned at the, once again, frowning angel. Any more of that selfless ego and he would start to be sick. He was bored about how slow the conversation went. He didn‚Äôt want to employ Dean for too long. And he definitely wanted for his brother to disappear as quickly as he had come. Which was why he simply picked Johnson up by his collar.

‚ÄúLook, mate. You remember that nasty blade you wanted to smite me with?‚Äù A widening of the eyes was the sole response. ‚ÄúI see you do. Well, we have some questions about that. Because that angel it belonged to went missing a while ago. Now my dear brother here,‚Äù Merulias gestured to Michael who still regarded the rough behaviour with disdain.¬†‚ÄúHe isn‚Äôt very quick and noticed that a few centuries late. That is right, is it not, brother?‚Äù Merulias did not wait for an answer and carried on to shove all the information into the semi-delirious priest.¬†‚ÄúSince you now know what we know and what we want, the question is simple. Who of you miscreants is abducting angels?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not part of this anymore,‚Äù Johnson stuttered with a visibly clearer mind.

‚ÄúBut you are, because you are our only lead. And you know I will get you to talk with the right method.‚Äù Johnson swallowed audibly as he realised his situation. Merulias knew he remembered the last time when the fallen angel had made him obey his will.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no need for that. I‚Äôll help.‚Äù Johnson agreed, whereupon Merulias let go of him. Struggling to remain on his feet he sat back down.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a secret organisation, existing for centuries. I was excommunicated for losing the sword. And by the church for being involved in blasphemous activities.‚Äù He looked at Merulias once again. Faint lingering anger glimmered in the old man‚Äôs eyes.

‚ÄúThis would never have happened; had you not taken my sword and made me subject to your foul influence.‚Äù He thundered with the old authority he had displayed while hunting the devil a few years prior.¬†

‚ÄúNo one asked you to hunt me in the first place,‚Äù Merulias countered smoothly.¬†

‚ÄúIf you were a member of that cult, then you must know where they reside.‚Äù Dean chimed in as the devil and priest stared each other down.¬†

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù came the quick answer.

‚ÄúOf course he knows,‚Äù a smile spread on Merulias‚Äô face as the fanatic refused to cooperate. ‚ÄúYou know this time I won‚Äôt even need a spell to get into your head.‚Äù He spread his black wings to put emphasis on the subtle threat.

‚ÄúThere is no need to scare that poor man,‚Äù Michael stepped in front of his brother.

‚ÄúProbably not, but I still enjoy it.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI remember a time when you would never have stooped that low, Lucifer.‚Äù Merulias only shrugged and folded his wings.

‚ÄúYou are an angel,‚Äù Johnson uttered hopefully. ‚ÄúPlease tell me it‚Äôs not too late to redeem myself.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt never is,‚Äù Michael replied. ‚ÄúYou could start by showing us the blasphemers‚Äô residence.‚Äù Seeing the old man sway as he stood up Merulias made a proposal to his annoyingly hasty brother.

‚ÄúI think a night of rest would be a good idea, not just for our drunk lead.‚Äù He cast a glance at Dean who looked fairly exhausted. Michael sighed but said nothing more. When his angelic brother made attempts to follow, Merulias stopped him.

‚ÄúSomeone has to keep an eye on him,‚Äù the devil motioned towards Johnson. When Michael gave him a piqued expression for the second time, Merulias only took his brother‚Äôs shoulder.

‚ÄúI am sure you two have a lot of common ground. Righteous smiting, oblates and wine, catholics and protestants. We‚Äôll be back in the morning.‚Äù Using the moment of dumbfounded unresponsiveness, he took Dean and made for home.¬†

‚ÄúDid you just get rid of your brother?‚Äù Dean asked with as much astonishment as perplexity.

‚ÄúNo, I didn‚Äôt do that. I gave him a few hours in the best company an angel can get. I am sure our drunk priest is falling to his knees as we speak.‚Äù

‚ÄúCould it be that you are not interested in mending any bridges?‚Äù Taking a cigarette, Merulias turned away from his friend.

‚ÄúIs it too much to ask to be able to have a smoke in peace? Furthermore, tomorrow we will find those fools trying to meddle with affairs not meant for them. Once we are done, Brother will climb back on his high horse he came from.‚Äù

When?
This was maybe a couple weeks ago around 11am-12pm?  Feel like it was warm enough to just be in my red hoodie. 

Where?
It was at the intersection of Langdon & North Frances downtown.  You were crossing Langdon and going towards state while I was also crossing Langdon but going away from State.

You?
You were taller than me and had a more lanky build, I'm pretty sure you had glasses and I'm kinda sure you had short curly hair.  You presented masculine and semi-casual.  I also believe you were carrying a cardboard tray of drinks, probably coffee??

Me?
Short, chubby, fem-androgynous, facial piercings, was wearing black pants & a red hoodie and I would have had my brown hair in a mid height lazy bun w/ one side of my head shaved or very short brown hair if it was still a lil grown out again. 

The Moment?
When we were crossing Langdon going different directions you saw me wave at the car waiting at the intersection for us to cross.  When we had crossed paths a second later you said something similar to ""Oh, do you always do that?"" and my response was something like ""Oh! Uhh, Normally!"" Your response was perhaps ""Oh, wow! That's great."" It also could have been more like ""Oh, wow! Really? That's great you do that."" Don't fully remember but it was a positive response to me waving at cars at intersections, lol.  The conversation all occured with us half turned around but still walking in our respective directions.  

But yeah!! You had made my day and it was a very cute lil interaction I still think about.  You seemed real nice n' cute and I kicked myself after thinking I should have tried to get your number. Buuuut, I'm a lil socially awkward. :))

1kokj8s,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1kokj8s/how_to_leave_am_i_overreacting/,"How to leave, am I overreacting?","So, I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend for about seven years. He‚Äôs never been great, except at the very beginning of our relationship and I fell super hard in love with him and I have a hard time giving up on people. 
When Covid hit and closed everything down his family (who we live with) went nuclear - like spraying down all the groceries down with alcohol, all mail had to be sprayed down, no going out whatsoever, and they eventually convinced me to quit the job I had loved and thrived in for almost 8 years. I thought it was worth it, because I could live with him and get my teaching degree. 
Well, when stuff started becoming normal again, he and his family stayed isolated and wouldn‚Äôt let anyone leave the house until about a year and a half ago. 
He‚Äôs become more and more controlling in other ways, especially since we had our first child in January. He and my family don‚Äôt get along, especially my younger brother who won‚Äôt even be in the same room with him. I asked my boyfriend if I could take our daughter for a couple hours on Easter to my moms house, to which he put his foot down and decreed that wherever I took her in public he would have to be involved. He also put his foot down and said he doesn‚Äôt want her anywhere public until she‚Äôs vaccinated for measles, because of the new outbreaks. This apparently includes my sisters house, my friends houses, and any grocery stores and restaurants. 
My sister hasn‚Äôt even met my daughter yet because of his restrictions, as he doesn‚Äôt want anyone over to the house because he‚Äôs not done renovating his old room for us to move in. We‚Äôve been sleeping on the couch ever since we came home with the baby. 
He‚Äôs always been controlling but he‚Äôs gotten worse, he‚Äôs now counting the cups of coffee I have each day and giving me a hard time about it. I keep it to three, since I‚Äôm breastfeeding by the way, but he‚Äôs so nasty to me about it. 
I want to leave, and I have tried to, but he threatens to take custody of my daughter, threatening me that since I take antidepressants it shows that I‚Äôm not going to be a stable environment for her. Meanwhile, he‚Äôs spent exactly $15 on her the whole time she‚Äôs existed - I buy everything and make all of her doctors appointments, etc. He holds her maybe 20 minutes total a day and has never put her to bed. Anytime I ask him to hold her while I go to the bathroom he hands her over to his mom. 
He doesn‚Äôt have a job or a car, he has been taking part time college classes, but spent $2100 on a new gaming PC for himself with his college loan money. 
I‚Äôm terrified to leave cause I‚Äôm worried he‚Äôll get 50/50 custody and it‚Äôll be his mom (who isn‚Äôt super stable) taking care of our daughter. Does it help that he‚Äôs not listed on her birth certificate? 
I don‚Äôt want child support, he wouldn‚Äôt pay it anyway, and he has zero respect for me. I just don‚Äôt feel like I can stay much longer and it‚Äôs just getting worse. He treats me like a bang maid, he demands sex even when I say no he keeps badgering me until I give in. Even when I was super anemic after my c section he still made me ‚Äúhelp him out‚Äù. He doesn‚Äôt kiss me or snuggle me anymore, he just puts me down, questions me about everything and yells at me to do stuff for him. 
I‚Äôve lost 90% of my friends because of this relationship, and my relationship with my brother, who used to be like my best friend. I never thought I would end up in this position and I‚Äôm scared and alone. I want to do what‚Äôs right for my daughter, but it makes me feel sick to think of her stuck here without me to protect her from the yelling and the emotional abuse that they inflict on one another. 
Any advice would really help, I‚Äôm sorry this got so long.

1kokgqa,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kokgqa,DF64 Just Arrived Help!,"So I ordered my DF64 and reading soo many reddit posts and comments. Now I saw mixed reviews about ordering from df64coffee, but had already ordered it, so started praying. It actually arrived pretty quickly once it shipped, and was honestly maybe only delayed a little bit. All in all happy with the purchase experience with no complaints!!

Now the thing is I bought the DF64V V2. Its supposed to come with DLC burrs, but I am not sure what I ended up getting instead. I‚Äôll start with the marker test and go through the dialing process but curious which burr they sent me and what I should do to return or get a new one if I need to change. I have also emailed them asking the same thing.

TIA, I just bought a bambino too so about to figure out how coffee works!!

1kokfl5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kokfl5,Grind size question/ pre-ground coffee?,"I have a Baratza Encore grinder and I‚Äôve been trying to dial in the right grind size for use with my Cup One. I thought if I bought a well known grinder, I would be able to set it to a universally known setting (18-20ish?) and be in the ballpark. I later found out that there is so much variation from grinder to grinder that it‚Äôs pretty much impossible to do so. What I ‚Äúthink‚Äù is 18-20 on someone else‚Äôs machine is possibly more like 10-12 on mine. I‚Äôve been trying my best to get the sea salt/sand size and texture that I‚Äôve seen recommended. I found that going from 18-20 on my machine down to 10 has made the coffee taste better. I kept reading recommendations that say grind finer until it tastes better so I did.

But‚Ä¶ I also saw the ‚Äúwarning‚Äù saying not to use pre-ground coffee because it‚Äôs generally too fine. Being stubborn, I tried it anyway and sure enough, I had the best tasting, easiest to prepare cup of coffee from my Cup One yet! What gives? I know it‚Äôs harder to tell the true grind size from a picture, but I attached a picture of some beans I ground with my Baratza on 10 and another picture of some pre-ground Cameron‚Äôs coffee. Is this Cameron‚Äôs coffee maybe a courser grind than the typical pre-ground coffee that MM was warning against? What size grind would you consider those in my pictures to be? My machine didn‚Äôt come close to overflowing while brewing. I want to try some REALLY good coffee but I don‚Äôt want to keep wasting it by constantly experimenting with grind settings!
